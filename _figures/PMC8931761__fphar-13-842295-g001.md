caption: 'Key molecular targets and related-signaling pathways during the EMT program
  involved in the inhibition of migratory and invasive characteristics of CRC by TCMs.
  Notes: Several cell-intrinsic signalings cooperate to induce the expression of EMT-TFs
  containing Snail, Slug, ZEB1/2, and Twist, the expressions of which are induced
  by the above-mentioned signaling pathways, including TGF-β/Smads, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin,
  PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB, ultimately leading to transformation to the mesenchymal cell
  state. In response to TGF-β, Smad2/3 is activated and forms a protein complex with
  Smad4, and promotes the transcription of EMT-TFs. the expression of which is induced
  by various signaling pathways. The TGF-β molecular pathway also collaborates with
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn triggers the activation of the mTOR complex
  and NF-κB. On the other hand, AKT can restrain the function of GSK-3β, a kinase
  that inhibits nuclear translocation of ß-catenin and EMT-TFs Snail and Slug in Smad-independent
  pathways. Furthermore, MMP-2 expression is positively controlled by Smad2 whilst
  MMP-9 is modulated via NF-κB p65/p50 transcription signaling in tumor tissues and
  cells of CRC. The miR-200 family can down-regulate ZEB1/2 expression, and miR-200
  can be blocked by Akt, which is triggered by most EMT-associated signalings. Wnt
  signaling promotes EMT programme by repressing GSK-3β through DSH to stabilize ß-catenin,
  which translocates into the nucleus to engage the transcription factors TCF and
  LEF and facilitate EMT-related genes expression. Additionally, Notch signaling also
  participates in EMT progression, behaving as interactions of Delta-like or Jagged
  ligands with Notch receptors initiate signaling through the proteolytic release
  of the Notch ICD, and then modulates target gene expression.'
