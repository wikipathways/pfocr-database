caption: Model of enzymatic activities detected at replication forks arrested by (A)
  UV-induced damage or (B) inactivation of DnaB(Ts). (A) (i) Following UV irradiation,
  the leading-strand polymerase is blocked at the site of a lesion. (ii) RecF (F),
  RecO (O), and RecR (R) load RecA (A) at the arrested site, limiting the nascent
  DNA degradation by the RecQ helicase (Q) and RecJ nuclease (J). (iii) Processing
  by the RecF pathway genes restores the region to a form that allows repair enzymes
  to remove the blocking lesion. (iv) Replication can then resume once the replication
  holoenzyme is reloaded. (B) (i) Inactivation of DnaB(Ts) arrests DNA synthesis.
  (ii) RecF, RecO, and RecR load RecA at the arrested site, limiting the nascent DNA
  degradation by the RecQ helicase and RecJ nuclease. (iii) Extensive degradation
  by exonuclease I (ExoI), a 3′-5′ exonuclease, occurs on the nascent leading-strand
  DNA. (iv) The amount of degradation leads to further breakdown and possible collapse
  of the replication fork, requiring recombination in order to restore the replication
  fork.
