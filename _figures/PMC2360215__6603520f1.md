caption: Activation of the RAS–RAF–MEK pathway in thyroid cancer. Constitutive activation
  via gene mutations or rearrangements in RET, RAS and BRAF (highlighted in red) are
  the principal initiators of thyroid cancer development through enhanced nuclear
  translocation of ERK and subsequent transcriptional regulation of target genes.
  Activation of this tumour initiation pathway occurs in ∼70% of thyroid cancers.
  Activation of other pathways that cooperatively activate ERK, as well regulate other
  cell signaling pathways may also be involved with ERK in thyroid cancer progression.
  *Proteins known to be constitutively activated in thyroid cancer.
