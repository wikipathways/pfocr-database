caption: Production of D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate and its metabolism by the FAD‐dependent
  D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. The mitochondrial enzyme D‐2 hydroxyglutarate
  dehydrogenase catalyses the irreversible oxidation of D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate and its
  inactivation by mutations causes D‐2‐hydroxyglutaric aciduria type I. D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate
  can be produced from α‐ketoglutarate by four different enzymes. Hydroxyacid‐oxoacid
  transhydrogenase (HOT) oxidises 4‐hydroxybuyrate using alpha‐ketoglutarate as an
  electron acceptor. 3‐P‐glycerate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pathway
  of serine synthesis (not shown), has a side activity on α‐ketoglutarate due to the
  structural similarity of the latter with 3‐phosphohydroxypyruvate, the normal product
  of this enzyme. Mutated forms of IDH1 and IDH2, as described in various cancers,
  particularly in glioblastomas,,  and in D‐2‐hydroxyglutaric aciduria type II (mutations
  in IDH2) very efficiently catalyse the reduction of α‐ketoglutarate to D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate;
  in this condition, the metabolic capacity of D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
  is exceeded and D‐2‐hydroxyglutarate accumulates
