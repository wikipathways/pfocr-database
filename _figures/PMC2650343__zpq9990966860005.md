caption: A model for a C. elegans innate immune network. (A and B) This model shows
  the integration of signaling from 3 known innate immune pathways. (A) Each pathway
  regulates the induction of a set of effectors in response to P. aeruginosa. The
  FSHR-1 and p38 MAPK pathways regulate partially overlapping sets of pathogen-response
  genes. Specific examples of target genes mentioned in this work are listed for each
  category. (B) These signaling pathways also regulate the basal expression in the
  absence of pathogen of several genes. Examples mentioned here are listed for each
  category.
