caption: Cytosolic reducing equivalents supporting the mitochondrial redox balance
  during metastatic dissemination. Glucose and glutamine metabolisms are attenuated
  during metastatic dissemination to mitigate the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). Glutamine goes through reductive carboxylation, where isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) consumes NADPH from the cytosol, and citrate generated in
  this process enters into the mitochondria to support NAPDH production via isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and fortify the ROS defense. Glucose is metabolized through
  the pentose phosphate pathway to provide cytosolic NAPDH needed by IDH1. Oxaloacetate
  (OAA) produced via reductive carboxylation is metabolized by malate dehydrogenase
  1 (MDH1) in the cytosol to produce NAD+ to support the glycolytic flux. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  Asp, aspartate.
