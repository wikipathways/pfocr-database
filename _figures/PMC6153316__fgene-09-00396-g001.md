caption: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathway view. After a GAGE analysis
  of the gene expression data amongst the highest scored pathways (p < 0.05). All
  the compounds suspected to produce steatosis at middle concentration and time 8
  h are plotted. All the gene expressions have been normalized from –1 to 1, centered
  at 0. Green boxes correspond to a down regulation of the genes by a chemical and
  red box an up-regulation of the genes.
