caption: The IGF-1R/AKT/mTORC1 pathway can be activated in response to DNA damaging
  stress. The IGF-1R/AKT/mTORC1 pathway was less activated in cells where p53 was
  depleted by shRNA, indicating p53 can contribute to IGF-1R/AKT/mTORC1 activation.
  One way in which this might occur is through p53-dependent induction of IGFBP-3,
  which can both inhibit and potentiate IGF1 signaling. AKT activated in response
  to DNA damage can stabilize p53 by phosphorylating GSK3b and inhibiting p53 degradation
  mediated by the MDM2 and GSK3b. mTORC1 can promote p53 protein synthesis.
