caption: In this model, PGAM5 regulates senescence through several mechanisms. First,
  PGAM5 is required for regulating mitochondrial dynamics. PGAM5 deletion leads to
  elevation of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser-637, which tip the balance of mitochondrial
  dynamics toward hyperfusion and less mitochondrial turnover. As result, this results
  in elevated ATP and ROS production, activation of AMPK–mTOR pathway, and accelerated
  senescence. Second, PGAM5 deletion promotes the IRF/IFN-β pathway, which could also
  contribute to cell senescence. PGAM5 deletion leads to resistance to oxidative stress,
  possibly through mitochondrial hyperfusion and/or upregulation of anti-oxidative
  genes. This resistance is lost in aging possibly due to the accelerated senescence
  caused by PGAM5 deletion. Our model highlights a critical role for PGAM5 in regulating
  mitochondrial dynamics, senescence and age-related oxidative response.
