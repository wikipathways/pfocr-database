caption: Proposed mechanisms for β2‐adrenoceptor‐mediated mTOR signalling in skeletal
  muscle. In skeletal muscle, activation of the β2‐adrenoceptor (β2‐AR) coupled to
  Gαs stimulates adenylate cyclase, leading to cAMP accumulation. cAMP activates PKA,
  which then phosphorylates mTORC2. The phosphorylated mTORC2 and GRK2 stimulates
  translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, leading
  to increased glucose uptake. The long‐term stimulation of β2‐adrenoceptors causes
  activation of the Akt–mTORC1–S6K pathway and inhibition of myostatin production
  by PGC1α, which contributes to muscle growth. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor
  (Insulin‐R), resulting in activation of PI3K. PI3K then increases levels of PIP3,
  which activates PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt at Thr308. PI3K also activates mTORC2,
  which phosphorylates Akt at Ser473. Fully activated Akt phosphorylates AS160 to
  promote GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane leading to increased glucose
  uptake. Akt also phosphorylates mTORC1 and thereby promotes protein synthesis
