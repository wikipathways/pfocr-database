caption: The scheme of CD95-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling. Various
  factors contributing to the induction of apoptotic versus non-apoptotic NF-κB pathways
  are shown. CD95 stimulation leads to the formation of the DISC and the FADDosome,
  the latter consisting of FADD, RIPK1, c-FLIP, and caspases -8 and -10. Both the
  DISC and the FADDosome can have proapoptotic as well as antiapoptotic effects. DED
  proteins interact with NEMO, a part of the IKK complex. The interaction with NEMO
  results in the activation of IKK complex, subsequent ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
  degradation of IκBα, and translocation of p50 and p65 into the nucleus, where they
  activate NF-κB target genes. A20 can inhibit activation of the IKK complex. Figure
