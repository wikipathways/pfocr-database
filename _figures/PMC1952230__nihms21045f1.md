caption: SDF binding to CXCR4 leads to the activation of multiple G protein-dependent
  signaling pathways, resulting in diverse biological outcomes such as migration,
  adhesion, and transcriptional activation. Pathways activated and outcomes elicited
  may differ between CXCR4+ cell types. Two potential G protein-independent pathways
  have been described. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CXCR4 results in the recruitment
  and activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, while p38 and ERK activation has been shown
  to be partially dependent on arrestin-3. Following activation, GRK phosphorylation
  results in the recruitment of arrestin 2/3 and subsequent internalization. CXCR4
  is also ubiquitinated by AIP4 at the plasma membrane, which results in its sorting
  to and degradation in lysosomes. However, a portion of the internalized receptor
  may also recycle back to the plasma membrane.
