caption: PRMTs regulate antiviral innate immunity. PRMT1 methylates cGAS to repress
  the DNA sensor cGAS/STING signaling pathway, while methylating TBK1 to promote its
  activation and downstream signals. PRMT1 also methylates STAT1 to promote its nuclear
  DNA binding and IFN response. PRMT2 stimulates the TLR4/IRF3 pathway to enhance
  IFN-β production and methylates TRAF6 to prevent its ubiquitination and interaction
  with MAVS. PRMT3 inhibits RIG-1 activation. PRMT5 methylates cGAS and IFI16 to inhibit
  cGAS/STING, while interacting with nuclear cGAS to promote H3R2me2s and IFN gene
  expression. PRMT5 also negatively regulates the transcription of NLRC5, which is
  required for antigen presentation. PRMT6 sequesters IRF3 to inhibit its activation.
  PRMT7 methylates MAVS to inhibit its interaction with RIG-I, while PRMT9 methylates
  MAVS to inhibit its aggregation and autoactivation. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase;

  description: PRMTs regulate antiviral innate immunity. PRMT1 methylates cGAS to
    repress the DNA sensor cGAS/STING signaling pathway, while methylating TBK1 to

    promote its nuclear DNA binding and IFN response. PRMT2 stimulates the TLR4/IRF3
    pathway to enhance IFN-β production and methylates TRAF6 to prevent its ubiquitination

    and IFI16 to inhibit cGAS/STING, while interacting with nuclear cGAS to promote
    H3R2me2s and IFN gene expression. PRMT5 also negatively regulates the transcription
    of NLRC5, which is required for antigen presentation. PRMT6 sequesters IRF3 to
