caption: Schematic representation of apoptosis induced by TRAIL. Binding of TRAIL
  to its agonistic receptors (DR4 and/or DR5) leads to their oligomerization (1),
  and the subsequent recruitment of the cytosolic adapter protein FADD through DD
  homotypic interactions (2). FADD, in turn, enables recruitment of the initial pro-caspase-8/-10
  through DED interactions leading to the formation of the so-called DISC (death-inducing
  signaling complex (3)). Within the DISC, chains of caspase-8/-10 are assembled (4),
  allowing self-processing of caspase-8/10 and release of their active fragments to
  the cytosol (5), where they activate, by proteolytic cleavage, effector caspases
  (6) to execute the apoptotic program (7). Amplification of the signal through the
  intrinsic pathway is sometimes required when caspase-8 is not sufficiently activated.
  In this scenario activation of mitochondria is induced by caspase-8/-10 through
  cleavage of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein Bid (8), whose truncated version (tBid)
  is able to translocate to mitochondria and induce a change of their outer membrane
  permeability, through Bak and Bax interactions (9), allowing cytochome c release,
  activation of caspase-9, another initiator caspase able to activate the executioner
  caspase-3/-7 (10).
