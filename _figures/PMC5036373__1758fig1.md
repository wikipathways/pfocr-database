caption: Fate of palmitate in hepatocytes. Excess palmitate delivered to hepatocytes
  is converted to palmitoyl-CoA and can induce the formation of ceramide via the de
  novo pathway at the ER and LPC via PLA2 action on phosphatidylcholine (PC), which
  in turn is derived from diacylglycerol (DAG). Though palmitate can activate the
  proapoptotic machinery, palmitate itself and palmitate-derived LPC and ceramide
  all lead to the release of EVs from hepatocytes. Palmitate is buffered in hepatocytes
  by either oxidation or conversion to triglyceride, both of which mitigate palmitate-induced
  lipotoxicity.
