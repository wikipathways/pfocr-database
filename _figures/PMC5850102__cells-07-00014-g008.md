caption: Ras1 and Ras2 are activated upon nutrient availability signaling, glucose
  in particular. The GEF proteins Cdc25 or Sdc25 catalyze the liberation of GDP and
  the binding of GTP. Active RAS proteins activate in turn adenylate cyclase, which
  produces cAMP. This second messenger binds to the inhibitory unit of PKA, releasing
  the catalytic unit, which phosphorylates multiple downstream targets, leading to
  the activation of a variety of cellular processes or to the inhibition of transcription
  factors that control stress response. The pathway can be inactivated by the hydrolysis
  of cAMP by the phosphodiesterases Pde1 and Pde2, and by the GTPase activity of the
  GAPs Ira1 and Ira2.
