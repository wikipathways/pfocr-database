caption: Model for the function of different pathways in creating male sterility during
  HT stress in anther. HT affects the carbohydrate content in the anthers. The enzyme
  starch phosphorylase converts the carbohydrate to sugar and glucose, which disrupts
  the normal sugar balance process and affects the fatty acid and hormone pathways
  such as auxin, gibberellin and jasmonic acid. In the fatty acid pathway, the acyl‐CoA
  oxidase family genes, while in the alpha‐linolenic acid pathway, the acyl‐CoA oxide
  and allene oxide cyclase family genes were suppressed, leading to the reduced amount
  of jasmonic acid. In pollen grains, the disrupted hormones increased the ROS signal,
  which increased the programmed cell death (PCD), affected the pollen grain spikes,
  promoted pollen abortion and caused male sterility. In anthers, during HT stress,
  an increased amount of ROS reduces the antioxidant, disrupts the natural process
  of lignification and promotes the anther indehiscence, which leads to male sterility.
  Moreover, HT also disrupted DNA methylation, which affects the miRNA (miRNA160),
  suppressed the ARF10 and ARF17 gene, decreased the hormone (auxin), increased the
  ROS, promoted the anther indehiscence, pollen abortion and caused male sterility.

  description: Model for the function of different pathways in creating male sterility
    during HT stress in anther. HT affects the carbohydrate content in the anthers.
    The enzyme starch phosphorylase converts the carbohydrate to sugar and glucose,
    which disrupts the normal sugar balance process and affects the fatty acid and
    hormone pathways such as auxin, gibberellin and jasmonic acid. In the fatty acid
    pathway, the acyl‐CoA oxidase family genes, while in the alpha‐linolenic acid

    affected the pollen grain spikes, promoted pollen abortion and caused male sterility.
    In anthers, during HT stress, an increased amount of ROS reduces the antioxidant,
    disrupts the natural process of lignification and promotes the anther indehiscence,
