caption: The transsulfuration pathway connects methionine and glutathione biosynthesis.
  In the methionine cycle, methionine forms S-adenosylmethionine which serves as a
  methyl donor, generating S-adenosyl homocysteine. This is converted to homocysteine,
  which is subsequently converted back into methionine. Homocysteine has an alternative
  fate, however. It can be used to produce cystathionine, which is further converted
  to cysteine. This latter conversion is catalyzed by gamma-cystathionase and inhibited
  by propargylglycine. Cysteine can then feed glutathione biosynthesis through production
  of gamma-glutamylcysteine. This step is catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase
  and inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine.
