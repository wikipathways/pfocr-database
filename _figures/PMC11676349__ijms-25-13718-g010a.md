caption: The MapMan mitochondrial electron transport pathway. The data indicate that
  there are 52 and 23 DEGs in plants treated with the flash (above) and 60 s (below)
  treatments, respectively. Similarly, the mitochondrial apparatus is more profoundly
  activated by the flash than by the 60 s treatment. Twelve genes associated with
  metabolite transporters exhibit differential overexpression in the flash treatment,
  with seven being exclusive to this treatment. For the 60 s treatment, six metabolite
  transporter genes are found. Eight genes associated with cytochrome c are overexpressed
  by the flash treatment, while no gene is altered by the 60 s treatment. For complex
  I of the electron transport, the flash treatment alters 11 genes, with 10 specific
  ones. The genes that are overexpressed are indicated in red, while those that are
  underexpressed are indicated in blue
