caption: Possible mechanism of α7 nAChR modulation of dendritic spine morphology and
  its alteration in Alzheimer disease. The vertical flow diagram on the left shows
  the pathological cascade, in which β-amyloid oligomers activate α7 nAChR and the
  calcineurin–cofilin pathway. The increase in intracellular calcium concentration
  reinforces calcineurin activation. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates cofilin,
  which, in turn, depolymerizes actin filaments, leading to spine shrinkage and dysmorphism.
  Diffusion of cofilin to neighboring spines acts like a chain reaction, spreading
  the shrinkage along the dendrite. The flow diagram on the right illustrates the
  protective action of nicotine, which activates α7 nAChRs leading to intracellular
  calcium increases that activate CAMKII, which, in turn, leads to phosphorylated
  cofilin (p-cofilin), stabilizing actin filaments. The polymerization and stabilization
  of actin filaments is associated with spine enlargement.
