caption: Diverse mechanism supporting resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. JAK-STAT
  is a major pathway involved in resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma.
  In the normal response, T cell-derived IFN-γ binds to its receptor on the tumor
  cells, IFNGR1/2, and then activates the JAK-STAT pathway to induce the transcription
  of downstream genes including ISGs and MHC-I. CCL4 is induced by the transcription
  factor ATF3 to activate DC, and PTEN regulates the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway
  to induce apoptosis. Mutations in JAK1/2, IFNGR1 or regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway,
  including APLNR and USP22, or increases in the negative modulator of JAK-STAT pathway,
  PTPN2, cause the inactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway and resistance to immunotherapy
  [,,,,]. The PBAF complex reduces chromatin accessibility, which decreases the transcription
  of ISGs []. Active β-catenin by the WNT/β-catenin signaling suppresses CCL4 transcription
  from ATF3 leads to inactivation of DCs thereby reducing cytotoxic T cells []. Anti-apoptosis
  is caused by activation of PI3K/AKT due to PTEN mutation [,]. B2M mutation leads
  to unstabilization of MHC-I on the surface of tumor cells, which reduces the activation
  of T cells [].
