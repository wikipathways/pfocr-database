caption: Other pathways involved in the regulation of CD133 and the cell cycle (By
  Figdraw.). CD133 up-regulates BMI1 expression and activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The interaction between DUOXA1 and TP53 can influence the cell cycle by
  affecting the WNT, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways. TP53 suppresses CD133 expression.
  The IL-8 and IL-8 receptor complex, along with STAT, can induce CD133 expression,
  and CD133 itself can influence IL-8 levels and JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Additionally,
  IL-6 and STAT3 bind to the CD133 promoter, increasing CD133 protein levels. Both
  IL-6/STAT3 and NF-κB subunit positively regulate HIF-1α transcription. The relationship
  between these pathways is that NF-κB and JAK/STAT are mutually regulated, with both
  ways regulating IL-8. p53 can activate JAK/STAT, and P21 expression is mediated
  by JAK/STAT activation
