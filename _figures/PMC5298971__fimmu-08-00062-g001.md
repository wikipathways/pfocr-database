caption: The vitamin D synthesis pathway. Vitamin D3 can be acquired both endogenously
  from cholesterol in the skin and exogenously through diet (vitamin D2 and vitamin
  D3). In the skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol precursor, is converted to
  previtamin D3 upon ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. Through a series of cytochrome
  P450 enzyme-mediated reactions, previtamin D3 is converted first into 25(OH)2D3
  in liver hepatocytes and then activated in the kidney by 1α-hydroxylation, to form
  1,25(OH)2D3. The degradation of 1,25(OH)2D3 and intermediate metabolites is mediated
  by negative feedback mechanisms (). Figure created using the SBGN format on VANTED
  (). See Table  for notation.
