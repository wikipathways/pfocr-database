caption: Shift in glycolytic-mitochondrial energetics after T-H. Glucose undergoes
  glycolysis to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate may be either converted to lactate or enters
  mitochondria and is converted to acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA undergoes oxidation in the
  citric acid cycle, and energy-rich electrons are supplied to the electron transport
  chain, leading to the generation of energy-rich ATP molecules. In aerobic respiration,
  pyruvate to acetyl CoA is the major pathway (A). In the deficiency of oxygen, such
  as in hemorrhage, PDK1 is activated, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition
  of PDH, promoting conversion of pyruvate to lactate (B). Dotted lines indicate the
  less active pathway, in the respective conditions.
