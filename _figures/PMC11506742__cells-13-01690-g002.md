caption: Roles of IRAK1 in the metastatic cascade. (1) IRAK1 regulates the epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition. It upregulates the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin,
  and snail), along with endopeptidases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), for degradation and remodeling
  of the extracellular matrix (ECM). (2) IRAK1 promotes angiogenesis. It elevates
  the expression of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, CXCL1, and IL-8), and is involved
  in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. (3) IRAK1 facilitates metastatic
  colonization. It promotes survival through releasing pro-growth cytokines and activating
  mitotic cell cycle-related factors (CDK1 and Cdc45) and cell division pathway factors
  (Cdc7 and MCM2). It facilitates the extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
  through upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM1 and ICAM1). It
  supports cell colonization at secondary sites by modulating the TME through the
  release of pro-growth and pro-survival cytokines, and the promotion of immune evasion.
