caption: 'Top panel: conventional, genome-originated mRNA molecule. Bottom panel:
  Tier One, the chimeric pathway merging with Tier Two, the iPCR process. Boxed line
  – sense strand RNA. Single line – antisense strand RNA. “AUG” – functional translation
  initiation codon (could be other than “AUG”). Yellow circle – helicase/modifying
  activity complex. Blue lines (both single and boxed) – RNA strand modified and separated
  from its complement by a helicase complex. Red arrowhead – position of cleavage
  of the chimeric intermediate. Step 1: synthesis of antisense strand; step 2: strand
  separation; step 3: folding of antisense strand into self-priming configuration;
  step 4: extension of self-primed antisense RNA into sense RNA; step 5: strand separation;
  step 6: cleavage of the chimeric intermediate coupled with 3’polyadenylation of
  the antisense RNA; step 7: end-products of amplification; step 8: RdRp-mediated
  synthesis of the sense strand initiated at the 3’poly (A) of antisense RNA; step
  9: strand separation. Note that each strand constitutes an iPCR template; step 10:
  iPCR products. The antisense can be further amplified whereas the sense strand can
  be used either for amplification or for translation. Note that the iPCR-amplified
  sense strand retains the intact coding content of conventional mRNA. For details
  see main text.'
