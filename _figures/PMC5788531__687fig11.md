caption: Model for RPK1 and TOAD2 interactions in controlling root growth. Diagram
  shows a proposed model of a regulatory network controlling root meristem growth
  by TOAD2, RPK1, CLV2, CRN, and other unknown components. Dotted double arrows indicate
  potential direct interaction, solid double arrows indicate known interactions. Arrows
  symbolize positive regulation and bars indicate negative regulation. Unknown components
  could have both positive and negative regulatory roles.
