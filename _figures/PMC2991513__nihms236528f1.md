caption: JNK signaling pathway. A number of stimuli activate the JNK signaling cascade
  including TNF, free fatty acids (FFA) and extra- or intracellular reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Upstream events are poorly defined but result in the activation of
  one or more MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK), several of which are indicated. MAPKKKs
  activate the JNK MAPK kinases (MAPKK), MKK4 and MKK7, which phosphorylate and activate
  JNK. The level or duration of JNK activation is negatively regulated by phosphatase
  action, and ROS may stimulate JNK activation through the inhibition of phosphatase
  activity. Activated JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms phosphorylate the AP-1 subunit c-Jun,
  increasing its transcriptional activity. As a heterodimer with another subunit such
  as c-Fos, c-Jun binds to AP-1 promoter regions, increasing gene expression. Alternatively,
  JNK may also alter protein levels through the phosphorylation and activation of
  ubiquitin E3 ligase that promotes protein degradation. Black lines indicate stimulatory
  pathways and red lines indicate inhibitory pathways. ASK1, apoptosis signal-stimulating
  kinase 1; MLK, mixed-lineage protein kinases; TAK-1, TGF-β-activated kinase 1, TNFR1,
  TNF receptor 1, TRAF2, TNF receptor associated protein 2.
