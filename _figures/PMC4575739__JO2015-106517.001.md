caption: DEK-mediated regulation of NFκB pathway activity in a dose-dependent manner.
  As DEK expression increases (red), canonical NFκB transcriptional activity decreases
  (blue). (a) In the absence of DEK, there is increased phosphorylation of IκBa, which
  leads to its degradation and the translocation of p65/RelA to the nucleus where
  it is transcribes proinflammatory target genes like MCP-1. (b) In cells with endogenous
  levels of DEK, possibly in both normal and transformed cells, DEK colocalization
  with p65 on target gene promoters is induced by TNFα treatment. This results in
  the expression of potentially oncogenic, prosurvival target genes like c-IAP2. However,
  it is unknown how variations in DEK levels within this group, such as the difference
  between normal and transformed cells, may impact NFκB activity and the subsequent
  expression of various target genes. (c) When DEK is substantially overexpressed
  beyond physiological levels, such as what may occur when overexpressing DEK in already
  high-expressing transformed cell lines, NFκB activity is inhibited, which may trigger
  cell death.
