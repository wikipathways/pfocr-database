caption: Exosomes and important cells involved in diabetic wound healing. Exosomes
  can promote endothelial cell function recovery and angiogenesis through activating
  the Erk1/2signaling pathway or activation of eNOS/AKT/ERK/P-38 signaling pathways,
  inhibition of AP-1/ROS/NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1/IL-1β, and increasing the secretion of
  VEGF, IGF-1, and FGF. Exosomes inhibit inflammation by promoting phenotypic changes
  of macrophages by activating the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Exosomes promote proliferation
  and migration of fibroblasts by activation of PI3K/Akt pathways or activating the
  Rho-YAP signaling pathway exosomes promote the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes.
