caption: Effects of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded products on AHR signaling pathway in
  B cells. Distinct endogenous and exogenous AHR ligands regulate the metabolism of
  B cells. EBV-encoded protein EBNA3 enhances dioxin-induced AHR transcriptional activity,
  which induces the expression of BZLF1. BZLF1 promotes the virus to enter a lytic
  replication state, inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway, and affects the expression
  of PD-L1. EBV-encoded LMP1 can affect the AHR signaling pathway by activating NF-κB
