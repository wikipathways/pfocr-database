caption: Scheme of the Interconnections between Alteration of Cell Wall Integrity
  and Hormone Signaling Pathways in the Regulation of Arabidopsis Resistance to Pathogens
  and Osmotic Stress.Pathogen infection and abiotic stresses lead to the activation
  of signaling pathways (ET, JA, or ABA) that regulate the expression of different
  groups of antimicrobials and osmoprotectant compounds. Antagonistic interactions
  between the ET/JA and ABA signaling pathways have been described (; ). Alteration
  of primary cell walls caused by mutations (ixr1) in the IXR1 protein leads to the
  constitutive activation of the ET/JA pathway, which controls the expression of antimicrobial
  proteins, such as defensins (PDFs) and basic PR proteins (bPRs) (). Modifications
  of the secondary cell walls caused by the impairment of IRX1 and IRX5 proteins,
  as occurs in the irx/cesa mutants, triggers ABA signaling and may lead to the accumulation
  of antimicrobial peptides (e.g., LTPs), secondary metabolites (e.g., glucosinolates),
  and osmoprotectants (e.g., late embryogenesis–associated proteins [LEAs]). Arrows
  indicate activation, and broken arrows indicate negative regulation.
