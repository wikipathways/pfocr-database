caption: Mechanisms of action of commonly used systemic agents in treatment of renal
  cell carcinoma (RCC). Multiple strategies have been developed for the treatment
  of advanced RCC. High-dose IL-2 is still the first-line treatment for the minority
  of patients with intact organ function. If available, protocol treatment with nivolumab
  is another preferred strategy aimed at activating an immune response against RCC.
  It can also be used for patients with progression of disease on molecularly targeted
  therapy that includes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, bevacizumab,
  and multiple small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) active against VEGF
  receptor and, in the case of sorafenib, against members of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) that promote
  endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus, disrupt growth factor signaling
  via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR pathway
  regulating cell proliferation. At present, these agents are recommended for patients
  not responding to first-line anti-VEGF therapy.
