caption: The three metabolic pathways in cells. Fatty-acid synthesis occurs in the
  cytoplasm, with NADPH and acetyl-CoA serving as key precursor molecules. Glucose
  enters the cytoplasm via the GLUT1 transporter and is converted to G-6-P. It undergoes
  a series of reactions to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate can be converted to lactate
  or enter the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation to generate acetyl-CoA,
  which then enters the TCA cycle. Glutamine enters the cell via the ASCT2 transporter
  and undergoes catabolic metabolism. The breakdown of glutamine yields α-KG and glutamate,
  with α-KG entering the TCA cycle. The graphic was created by Adobe Illustrator
