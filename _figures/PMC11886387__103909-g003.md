caption: 'McCullough protocol: Base spike detoxification. A: Dissolution of spike
  protein-induced thrombus. Nattokinase directly degrades fibrinolysis-resistant fibrin
  (from spike protein), and bromelain upregulates fibrinolysis; B: Inhibition of spike
  protein via ACE2 receptors. Bromelain and curcumin block the ACE2 receptor, preventing
  spike protein from binding; C: Proteolytic degradation of spike protein. Nattokinase
  and bromelain degrade spike proteins, rendering them inactive; D: Attenuation of
  spike protein-induced inflammation. Bromelain and curcumin downregulate the nuclear
  factor kappa B signaling pathway induced by spike protein, leading to the suppression
  of inflammatory molecules; E: Base spike detoxification treatment protocol. The
  full treatment regimen and the addition of other compounds based on clinical indication
  are illustrated. TPA: Tissue plasminogen activator; PAI-1: Plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1; ACE2: Angiotensin converting enzyme-2; NF-kB: Nuclear factor kappa
