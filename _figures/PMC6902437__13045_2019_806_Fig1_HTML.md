caption: 'Schematic diagram of the main production and uptake mechanism of exosomes.
  a. The formation of exosomes. Endocytosis encapsulates the substances to form an
  early endosome that continue to mature into MVBs containing ILVs. (I) ESCRT-dependent
  pathway: (1) Ubiquitinated cargo activates nearby ECSRT0 to recruit more cargos
  to the vicinity. (2) Activated ESCRT0 further activates downstream ESCRTI and ESCRTII
  to form a large polymeric complex that further closes the lipid membrane invagination.
  (3) ESCRTII then induces the activation and polymerization CHMP4 subunit of ESCRTIII,
  which can lead to the formation of ILV. (4) The formation of ILV activates the nearby
  Vps-4 complex to dissociate CHMP4 from the lipid membrane into recycling. (II) ESCRT-independent
  pathway: (1) Cargo located close to the endosome lipid membrane enters the lipid
  membrane microdomains enriched in ceramide. (2) Cargo is enveloped in the invaginated
  pocket with the assistance of various tetraspanins, transmembrane proteins and lipids
  and (3) eventually forms ILV. MVB containing ILVs is transported to the vicinity
  of lysosome for degradation. MVB can also be delivered to the vicinity of specific
  plasma membrane, and anchor and fuse to the plasma membrane to secret the ILVs to
  form exosomes. b. Association and uptake of exosomes. (I) Exosomes can recognize
  and bind to the recipient cells and transmit specific signals. (II) Exosomes enter
  target cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. (III) Exosomes enter target cells
  by clathrin-independent macropinocytosis or phagocytosis pathway. (IV) Exosomes
  enter cells by lipid rafts, such as caveolae, mediated endocytosis. Depending on
  the needs of the cells, the exosomal contents are released into the cytosol, the
  exosomes are transported to the lysosome for degradation and digestion, or the exosomes
  fuse with cell membrane again and are released to accomplish the transcellular transport'
