caption: Potential mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming induced by insulin resistance.
  Insulin resistance activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), which inhibit
  the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This suppression reduces the
  conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA through PDC-mediated decarboxylation, thereby
  decreasing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  production. Furthermore, insulin resistance leads to an increase in reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), which not only induces oxidative modifications of key proteins involved
  in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but also results in the inactivation of prolyl
  hydroxylases (PHDs). This causes the dephosphorylation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF1α) and promotes the expression of enzymes associated with glycolysis. Finally,
  insulin resistance induces sustained activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK). On one hand, this disrupts mitochondrial dynamics, leading to mitochondrial
  fragmentation, which is detrimental to OXPHOS. On the other hand, prolonged mitochondrial
  damage activates the PINK1-Parkin pathway, continuously marking damaged mitochondria
  for degradation. This results in excessive mitochondrial autophagy, reducing the
  number of healthy mitochondria and impairing OXPHOS efficiency. I Complex I, II
