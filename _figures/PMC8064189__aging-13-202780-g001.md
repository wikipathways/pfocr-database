caption: The workflow of this study. We first induced IBD mouse model with DSS, and
  then administrated mesalazine by gavage. At the end of the experiment, we collected
  colon tissues and blood from eyes of mice to measure colon length, conducted H&E
  staining, and determined the expression levels of inflammation-related cytokines
  IL-6 and TNF-α in serum. At the same time, we explored the circRNA expression profiling
  of colon tissue using next-generation RNA-seq and then carried out a series of bioinformatics
  analysis and preliminary validation experiments.
