caption: (A) Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and muscle mass wasting. miR-21
  interacts with and activates toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7). TLR-7, through the c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase pathway (JNK) pathway, induces apoptosis of muscle cells, leading
  to atrophy (). Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP90 that compose the membrane
  of exosomes can bind to TLR-4, activating this receptor on muscle cells and induce
  the muscle mass wasting (). Exosomal miR-182 is able to block transcript factor
  Foxo3’s action, inhibiting its action, reducing the expression of several atrophy
  genes, as light chain 3 (LC3), Atrogin-1, and ATG12 (). (B) Exosomal miRNAs, proteins,
  and systemic inflammation. miR-21 and miR-29 are able to interact and activate TLR-7/8–MyD88–nuclear
  factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway, inducing an increased expression and release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and MCP-1
  (, ). This pro-inflammatory state enhances protein degradation and inhibits protein
  synthesis. HSP70 and HSP90 present in exosomes membranes can bind to, and activate
  TLR-2 and TLR-4. When activated, these receptors promote the activation of the NFκB
  pathway, inducing a pro-inflammatory status ().
