caption: Major characteristic pathways activated by VEGF-A/VEGF receptor-2 and in
  part distinct from pathways induced by the IL-1 and EGF receptors in endothelial
  cells are shown. VEGF-A couples via Tyr1175 to PLC-γ (, ) activating the Ca++/calcineurin
  and PKC/MAPK pathways. This leads to the induction of the transcription factors
  NFAT and EGR-1, which are important for part of the VEGF-induced gene repertoire
  and the angiogenic/proliferative response (-, ) (G. Schabbauer and E. Hofer, in
  preparation). Other pathways activated lead via PI3K/Akt, TsAd, Src and p38 to the
  promotion of survival, migration and potentially permeability, respectively (, ,
  , ). The IL-1 receptor induces genes to a large extent via NF-κB (, ). A significant
  fraction of the NF-κB-induced genes appears to be also upregulated by VEGF-A-induced
  NFAT. EGF seems to induce the MAPK pathway via Ras and does not activate NFAT ()
  (Schweighofer B and Hofer E, in preparation). Neither VEGF-A nor EGF trigger NF-κB
  activation to a significant extent ().
