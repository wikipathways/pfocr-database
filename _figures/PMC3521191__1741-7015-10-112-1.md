caption: 'Biological pathways targeted for therapy in renal cell carcinoma based on
  a knowledge of the underlying genetic changes and downstream biological consequences.
  Loss of function of the VHL tumour suppressor gene leads to stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible
  factor alpha (HIFα). Activated HIF translocates into the nucleus and leads to the
  transcription of a large number of hypoxia-inducible genes including vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase within the PI3K/Akt pathway that can promote cell
  growth and survival pathways as well as causing accumulation of HIF. Bevacizumab
  is a monoclonal antibody to VEGF whilst sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib and pazopanib
  are VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These agents are thought to primarily
  function as antiangiogenic agents, inhibiting ligand binding or downstream receptor
  signalling of VEGF and PDGF on endothelial cells. Temsirolimus and everolimus inhibit
  the kinase activity of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Reproduced with permission from
