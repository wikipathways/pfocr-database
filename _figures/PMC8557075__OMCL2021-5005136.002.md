caption: Putative pathway for ferroptosis participates in neuroinflammation to neurological
  disorders. Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules (e.g., ROS, cfDNA,
  HMGB1, ITs, and PGs) produced in the process of ferroptosis activate glial cells
  by activating neuroimmune pathways. Activated glial cells produce a series of inflammatory
  factors which contribute to neuronal damage and a series of neurological disorders,
  such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and stroke.
