caption: Schematic diagram of yeast sphingolipid biosynthesis from endogenous and
  exogenous precursors. Myriocin is a potent inhibitor of SPT (), which is the first
  and rate-limiting enzyme of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway (). Previous studies
  proposed that Orm proteins are dynamic negative regulators of SPT and their activities
  are inversely proportional to sphingolipid levels (). Exogenous sphingoid bases
  (DHS and PHS) can be converted into ceramides in the endoplasmic reticulum after
  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by the indicated enzymes and can then be incorporated
  into complex sphingolipids (; ; ).
