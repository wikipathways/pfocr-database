caption: The five signaling pathways associated with macrophage polarization which
  are highlighted by pink color. The connection of each signaling pathway to the polarization
  to either M1 phase or M2 phase is denoted by brown and blue arrows respectively.
  The black arrows connect the signaling pathway to its key signaling protein(s) which
  are then connected to each activated phase. The complex interrelationship between
  signaling pathway and regulatory network is shown by connecting the pathway highlighted
  in yellow to the signaling pathway in pink by green arrows
