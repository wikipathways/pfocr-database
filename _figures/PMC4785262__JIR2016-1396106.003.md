caption: P. gingivalis can manipulate both complement and TLR signaling to induce
  bacterial persistence. The bacterium P. gingivalis is recognized by the TLR2 on
  neutrophils and activates the adaptor protein MyD88 for bacterial elimination (blue
  arrows). However, P. gingivalis produce gingipains, enzymes that function as complement
  C5 convertases. C5a complement fragment binds to its receptor (C5aR), which induces
  the E3 ligase Smurf1 to ubiquitinate MyD88 and mark if for proteosomal degradation
  (red arrows), effectively inhibiting bacteria killing. Interestingly, binding of
  P. gingivalis to the TLR2 also induces inflammation through a signaling pathway
  involving the adaptor molecule Mal and the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI-3K) (green arrows). Also, the same pathway can prevent actin polymerization
  through inhibition of the small GTPase RhoA and block phagocytosis.
