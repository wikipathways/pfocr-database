caption: 'A better way to slow AD: Co-activation of the Nrf2-ARE antioxidant system
  and neurotrophic signaling pathway. In AD, Aβ peptides and oxidative stress increase
  ROS, attack mitochondrial integrity and overpower antioxidant system. This leads
  to generation of lipid peroxides, DNA, protein and organelle damage, synaptic defects,
  increased ER stress response, and ultimately neuron death. In order to mitigate
  oxidative stress in AD brains, global antioxidant defense system should be upregulated.
  The activation of the Nrf2-ARE antioxidant defense system has been seen via FGFs
  and certain flavonoids. However, unilateral activation of the antioxidant system
  is insufficient in altering AD progression. Activation of neurotrophic signaling
  pathway is also necessary for regeneration of damaged organelles, which has been
  evidenced in various non-flavonoid polyphenols. Synergistic co-activation of the
  Nrf2-ARE system and neurotrophic signaling pathway, however, may provide a greater
  ameliorating effect on AD pathogenesis. Co-activation of these pathways can be achieved
  by either a combination of the Nrf2-ARE activator and neurotrophic signaling activator
  or a multimodal activator such as luteolin, apigenin, 7,8-DHF, harpagoside, taurine,
  and R-α-lipoic acid. Either combinatory treatment or strong multimodal-effect agent
  will have a greater ability of ameliorating or modifying the progression of multifaceted
  AD by co-activating antioxidant and neurotophic signaling pathways. (↑: increase;
