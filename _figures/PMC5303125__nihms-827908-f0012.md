caption: ER stress responses are chronically activated in both quiescent and activated
  PSCs. Under ER stress-free conditions, the PERK pathway plays adaptive roles such
  as attenuating protein synthesis, which is essential for cell survival. However,
  in response to excessive ER stress induced by Tg or PA, activation of the PERK pathway
  upregulates ATF-mediated CHOP, leading to PSC apoptosis.
