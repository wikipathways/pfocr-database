caption: 'Implicated lipids are metabolically linked in Parkinson’s disease risk gene
  pathways. Pathway analysis was performed to generate a metabolic map of the main
  lipid classes implicated in the discrimination of Parkinson’s disease patients and
  LRRK2 carriers from controls. The resulting map indicated that most implicated lipids
  were highly integrated and were in metabolic pathways that included enzymes encoded
  by Parkinson’s disease risk genes (GBA1, GALC, SMPD1, PLA2G6 and DGKQ). GCase =
  glucocerebrosidase; GALCase = galactoceramidase; SMase = sphingomyelinase; CaI-PLA2
  = 85/88 kDa calcium-independent phospholipase A2; PA = phosphatidic acid; PI(4)P
  = phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. #PG is formed from PA in a three-step reaction
  pathway.'
