caption: A Summary of Metabolic Pathways Relating to the CACCarbons derived from amino
  acids contribute to citric acid cycle (CAC) flux (anaplerosis), reducing NAD+ to
  NADH and ultimately yielding ATP. To maintain this energy-yielding flow, especially
  in the context of CAC interruption and during hypoxia/ischemia, carbon moieties
  must exit the CAC, e.g., through succinate and succinyl CoA.
