caption: Schematic diagram illustrating intracellular signaling cascade that may mediate
  feedback inhibition of AT1R expression via inhibition of protein kinase G (PKG)
  pathway. Nitric oxide (NO) stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to generate
  the second messenger 3′,5′ guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP). The soluble cGMP activates cyclic nucleotide-dependent PKG, which leads to
  phosphorylation on PKG consensus sites of target proteins affecting gene transcription.
  On the other hand, superoxide generated by NADPH oxidase reacts with NO to form
  peroxynitrite radicals, which affect the expression of target genes via posttranslational
  modifications viz. nitration or cysteinylation. In the present study, the PKG inhibitor
  Rp-Br-cGMP downregulates the AT1R mRNA as well as protein levels while the peroxynitrite
  scavenger deforxamine (DFO) has no effect in neuronal cell line in response to SNAP
  treatment, suggesting that activation of PKG is the required step in the regulation
  of AT1R gene expression by the cGMP-dependent signaling pathway. Moreover, [Ca2+]i
  changes in response to ANG II are more pronounced with antisense nNOS treatment
  while ameliorated with nNOS upregulation using Ad.nNOS in NG108 cells.
