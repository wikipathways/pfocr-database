caption: Diverse E3 ligases participate in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways
  via the ubiquitination process, playing crucial roles in either immunological activation
  or immune evasion through specific mechanisms. For instance, MARCHF3 - PARP1 - dsDNA
  complex activates the cGAS - STING pathway in dendritic cells, which is essential
  for initiating innate immune responses. NBR1 - associated activation of STING impacts
  Th cells, thereby influencing the balance of the adaptive immune response. TRIM32
  recruits TBK1, leading to the induction of IFN, which is a key cytokine in antiviral
  and antitumor immunity. TAB 182 - CNOT4 interaction affects CD8 + T cells, potentially
  altering their cytotoxic function and tumor - killing ability. Moreover, SPOP -
  PD - L1/PD − 1 axis causes T - cell exhaustion, a major mechanism of tumor immune
  evasion. Evidently, numerous T - cell immune regulation processes are intricately
  associated with PD - L1. Consequently, targeted immunotherapy in combination with
  anti - PD - L1 treatment has emerged as a promising approach in the clinical management
  of HCC, offering new prospects for improving patient outcomes
