caption: Cyclin–CDK complexes display opposing roles in controlling mitochondrial
  function. Whereas their activity promotes the expression of the NRF1 factor through
  the pRB–E2F pathway, cyclin D1-CDK4 can also directly phosphorylate and inactivate
  NRF1, leading to decreased transcription of mitochondrial proteins by mitochondrial
  transcription factor A (mtTFA). Moreover, although the activity of mitochondria
  is directly stimulated by cyclin B1–CDK1, cyclin D1 binding to voltage-dependent
  anion channel protein (VDAC) prevents hexokinase 2 activation and the use of glucose
  in mitochondria. In pancreatic beta cells, cyclin D–CDK4 complexes promote insulin
  secretion through the E2F-mediated expression of the potassium ATP channel component
  Kir6.2. Insulin, in turn, induces the expression of D-type cyclins through a positive
  feedback loop. In adipocytes, adipogenesis is inhibited by the interaction of cyclin
  D1 with the histone acetyltransferase p300, which leads to inhibition of the transcription
  factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Conversely, adipogenesis
  is activated by cyclin D3–CDK4 -mediated PPARγ phosphorylation. Gluconeogenesis
  is inhibited in hepatocytes through the cyclin D1–CDK4-dependent phosphorylation
  and activation of the acetyltransferase GCN5, which acetylates and inactivates the
  transcription factor PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α). In addition, cyclin D1 can bind
  and inactivate the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4α), resulting
  in deficient lipid metabolism.
