caption: 'Role of the proteins and mediators involved in iron homeostasis and impact
  of hereditary hemochromatosis protein mutations in chronic kidney disease. A: Hereditary
  hemochromatosis protein (HFE) wild-type, healthy controls; B: HFE wild-type, end-stage
  renal disease (ESRD); C: HFE mutated, ESRD. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6)
  binds to the co-receptor membrane hemojuvelin (m-HJV) and to the bone morphogenetic
  protein receptor (BMP-R) on the membrane of hepatocytes. This initiates phosphorylation
  of small mother against decapentaplegic (SMAD) proteins and the assembly of heteromeric
  complexes. After nuclear translocation, the heteromeric SMAD complexes stimulate
  transcription of the HAMP gene for hepcidin. Another pathway responsible for hepcidin
  expression involves interleukine (IL)-6/gp130 signaling via signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) nuclear translocation. Negative regulation
  of the BMP-HJV-hepcidin pathway is achieved through the proteolytic processing of
  membrane-HJV by matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6). Additional negative regulation of hepcidin
  transcription is provided by soluble-HJV, which acts as an antagonist of the BMP
  pathway by competing with m-HJV for BMP-6 binding. The hepcidin regulatory signaling
  pathway is also regulated by HFE, which interacts either with transferrin receptor
  1 (TFR1) or transferrin receptor 1 (TFR2) according to serum transferrin saturation:
  in the presence of a high transferrin saturation HFE dissociates from TFR1 and binds
  TFR2 forming an iron sensing complex influencing hepcidin expression via SMAD/ERK
  signaling. Hepcidin secreted by the liver binds to the extracellular region of ferroportin
  1 (Fp-1) on the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes causing Fp-1 internalization,
  ubiquitination and degradation and consequently impaired intestinal iron absorption.
