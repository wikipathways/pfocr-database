caption: 'Glucose metabolic reprogramming in cancer. (A) Glycolytic pathway: c‐MYC
  can promote glycolysis by upregulating GLUT and several glycolytic enzymes. This
  increased process in tumor cells adapts to metabolic changes and promotes growth.
  (B) The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP): the PPP is the main glucose catabolism pathway that links glucose metabolism
  with NADPH production. It provides NADPH and ribose‐5‐phosphate (R5P), which plays
  a key role in the elimination of cellular ROS and reductive biosynthesis. Meanwhile,
  p53 affects PPP by inhibiting the expression of G6PD. Therefore, it is always mutated
  in cancer. For HBP, UDP‐GlcNAc levels are increased by upregulating HBP enzymes.
  (C) The tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway (TCA): pyruvate, one of the intermediates
  in glycolysis, enters the mitochondria and participates in the TCA cycle.'
