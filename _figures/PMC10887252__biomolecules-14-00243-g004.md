caption: The general activation mechanism of the JNK signaling pathway. JNK kinases
  are activated by a series of phosphorylation events in response to extracellular
  stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, environmental stresses, pathogens, GPCR
  agonists, and drugs. These stimuli first result in activation of the STE20 protein
  homologue germinal center kinases, including HPK, NIK, and GCK, which interact with
  and phosphorylate MEKK1, or directly cause the activation of membrane proximal MAP3K
  kinases such as ASK1, TAK1, or MLK3, which then phosphorylates and activates MKK4
  and MKK7. The activated MKK4 or MKK7 further phosphorylates and activates distinct
  JNK isoforms through dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues within
  a conserved tripeptide motif. Notably, DUSPs and PP2A can dephosphorylate JNK and
  inhibit JNK signaling. Upon activation, JNK, on the one hand, phosphorylates several
  nuclear transcription factors such as c-Jun, ATF2, and SP1, causing the transcription
  of target genes. On the other hand, JNK also interacts with and phosphorylates a
  number of non-nuclear proteins, including mitochondrial BCL-2 family members (e.g.,
  BCL-XL and BCL-2) and some cytoplasmic proteins. Finally, these proteins mediate
  a variety of cellular responses, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation,
  survival, apoptosis, inflammation, metabolic stress, and cell death. In addition,
  several protein complexes are also involved in regulating JNK signaling. For instance,
  the complex composed of ACID, JIP1, and JNK1, the complex composed of JIP1 and JNK1/2/3,
  and the complex composed of Sab and JNK1/2/3 are also involved in JNK signaling
  transduction and are critical for the development of neurodegenerative diseases,
  autoimmune inflammatory diseases/glomerulosclerosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,
  respectively. The TAT-JIP1 peptide and Notch 1-IC are used for ameliorating autoimmune
  inflammatory diseases and glomerulosclerosis, respectively
