caption: The role of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways on Atoh1-mediated hair cell
  differentiation and proliferation. (a), Dll1 and JAG2 are both activators of the
  notch signal by binding to the DSL region of the two ligands. Then, the notch signal
  is cleaved into three pieces by γ-secretase, and one piece of notch signal called
  Notch intracellular domain (ICD) is released into the intramembrane. Presenilin
  is the catalytic center of metalloprotease. (b), The Notch ICD translocates to the
  nucleus, where it interacts with CSL (C-promoter-binding factor). The binding of
  the Notch ICD and the recruitment of the co-activator protein Mastermind convert
  CSL from a transcriptional repressor to an activator, which results in the inhibition
  of hair cell death. Wnts binds to the cell surface receptors encoded by the Frizzled
  gene family, which in turn activates Dsh. The precise role of Dsh activation may
  turn off the expression of GSK3β and lead to the accumulation of β-catenin, which
  binds to T-cell factor and recruits other proteins to drive Atoh1-mediated hair
  cell death. Thus, it is necessary to promote the Wnt signaling pathway and inhibit
  the Notch signaling pathway to promote Atoh1-mediated hair cell differentiation
  or proliferation.
