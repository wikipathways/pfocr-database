caption: Effect of miRNAs on the Hippo pathway and the actin cytoskeleton. The cardiomyocyte
  cell cycle is controlled by the YAP transcription co-factor, which, when de-phosphorylated,
  translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the TEAD family of transcription
  factor to drive expression of pro-proliferative genes. YAP phosphorylation is controlled
  by various protein kinases, including TAOK1, STK38L, LATS, and MST1. These are targeted
  by different pro-proliferative miRNAs (in green). Proliferation is also linked to
  the cardiomyocyte actin cytoskeleton, which connects to cell-membrane dystrophin
  glycoprotein complex (DGC) and cell-to-cell junctions. Different pro-proliferative
  miRNAs regulate the rate of polymerized vs. globular actin (F- and G-actin, respectively)
  by targeting one or more of the cellular factors controlling the rate of actin polymerization
  (including Twinfilin, TWF, Profilin, PFN2, thymosin-b4, TMSB4X and Cofilin2, and
  CFL2). For further description, cf. text and references therein.
