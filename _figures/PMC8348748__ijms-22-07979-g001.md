caption: The implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cellular redox status and cellular
  homeostasis, the main therapeutic targets of ALA in this context. The SARS-CoV-2
  infection is initiated by the binding of S protein to ACE2 (the receptor of SARC-CoV-2),
  followed by its priming to the cell membrane (via TMRSS2) and by virus endocytosis.
  During infection, the ACE-Ang II-AT1 receptor signaling pathway is overactivated,
  which in turn activates NADPH oxidase with the increase production of O2•−. The
  enhancement in mtROS synthesis adds to this, both processes influencing the cellular
  redox status, endogenous antioxidant level and, subsequently, cellular homeostasis.
  In addition, the excess of ROS contributes to the activation and nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB factor, increasing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing
  the pro-inflammatory process. Intracellularly, ALA is reduced to DHLA. The ALA/DHLA
  redox system interferes with several signaling pathways of OS, even with the inflammatory
  process, and may present some protection in a SARS-CoV2 infection. Due to its wide
  distribution, ALA can directly scavenge the ROS, or can restore the reduced form
  of glutathione or CoQ10, an important constituent of the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain, thus enhancing endogenous antioxidant protection. Moreover, ALA
  stimulates GSH synthesis by increasing cellular cysteine uptake and by activating
  the NRF2-ARE signaling pathways, increasing glutamate–cysteine ligase activity.
  As cofactor of mitochondrial KGDH, ALA influences the supply with reducing equivalents
  (NAD+/NADH). Dependent on its antioxidant properties, but also independent of them,
  the ALA/DHLA system inhibits NF-kB signaling with the decrease in pro-inflammatory
  cytokine secretion. By preventing the oxidative depletion of BH4, an essential cofactor
  of eNOS, ALA can restore the eNOS activity with an increase of NO bioavailability,
  and thus, it improves the endothelial function. (ACE2—angiotensin-converting enzyme
