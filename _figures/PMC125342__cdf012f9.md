caption: Fig. 9. A model for the integration of different environmental signals through
  distinct functional domains of Msn2. Glucose signals could take two possible routes,
  namely cAMP-dependent and -independent routes, to regulate cAPK via Bcy1. cAPK antagonizes
  nuclear accumulation of Msn2 by targeting two domains. One of the targets, the NLS,
  is directly modified and provides an exclusive regulatory element for cAPK. In contrast,
  the region responsible for Msn2 nuclear export and/or retention is reacting promiscuously
  to signals generated by generic stress, signals from the TOR pathway and cAPK.
