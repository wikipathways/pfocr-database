caption: Seasonal regulation of flowering in winter-annual Arabidopsis. The flowering
  pathways that are active in each season are indicated by green or red boxes; green
  is promotive and red is repressive. Beige indicates inactive. In the summer/fall
  establishment phase, FLC prevents flowering by repressing floral integrators that
  would otherwise be induced by CO in response to long days (left). During the short
  days of winter, the photoperiod pathway is not active and vernalization leads to
  the induction of VIN3 and epigenetic repression of FLC (center). By the spring season,
  FLC repression is complete and is maintained by PRC2 and LHP1 (and VRN1; not pictured);
  in the lengthening days of spring, CO activates floral integrators free of competition
  from FLC and flowering is initiated (right).
