caption: Intracellular insulin receptor signaling. The binding of insulin to its cell
  surface receptor (IR) in the major target tissues results in receptor activation
  associated with its phosphorylation (P) at tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic
  domain of IR. This constitutes the signal for the recruitment of various cytoplasmic
  scaffolding and signaling proteins plausibly controlling two major downstream signaling
  pathways, the PI3-kinase and the MAP kinase pathways. The PI3-kinase pathway mediates
  the metabolic responses of insulin through the activation of the canonical kinase
  AKT controlling the expression and the translocation of the glucose transporter
  GLUT4 thereby glucose uptake as well as the metabolism of proteins and lipids. However,
  the MAP kinase pathway triggers the mitogenic responses of insulin via the activation
  of the canonical Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 cascade controlling the expression of genes involved
  in cell proliferation and growth.
