caption: Proposed model of the inhibitory effects of PI1, PI2, and PI3 on the signaling
  pathway of BL-dependent stomatal opening. The pathway starts from phototropin, followed
  by BLUS1, BHP, PP1, a key enzyme PM H+-ATPase and K+in-channel. PI1, PI2, and PI3
  inhibited BL-induced phosphorylation of PM H+-ATPase. Arrows indicate positive regulation.
  Blunt arrows indicate repression.
