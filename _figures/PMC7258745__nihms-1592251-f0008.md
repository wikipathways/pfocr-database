caption: 'Phosphorylation of TrkB at Y515 promotes synaptic signaling that modifies
  the actin cytoskeleton and promotes memory.This report tests the effects of two
  compounds in Fmr1 KO mice: 7,8-DHF and CX929. 7,8-DHF is a small molecular agonist
  of the TrkB receptor () and CX929 has been demonstrated to increase endogenous BDNF,
  TrkB’s major ligand (; ). The TrkB receptor is phosphorylated at many different
  residues, including Y515, Y816, and Y490. The Y515 site has been demonstrated to
  be crucial for activation of the canonical Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway (). ERK1/2,
  in turn, has many effectors, many of which are related to the modification of the
  actin cytoskeleton. One of these effectors is cortactin, which plays an important
  role in stabilization of actin (; ; ). Actin dynamics are crucial for both LTP and
  many different forms of learning (; ; ; , ; ; ; ).'
