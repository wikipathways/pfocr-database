caption: (A) margin vs. center comparison in ADC. Cellular Movement, Hematological
  Disease, Immunological Disease Network is presented together with Signaling with
  Rho GTPases canonical pathway; (B) center vs. control comparison in ADC. Cellular
  Movement, Hematological Disease, Immunological Disease is presented together with
  Signaling with Epithelial Adherens Junction Signaling canonical pathway and (C)
  margin vs. control comparison in ADC. Cardiovascular Disease, Free Radical Scavenging,
  Small Molecule Biochemistry is presented together with Acute Phase Response Signaling
  canonical pathway.

  protein changes between center, margin, and adjacent non-tumor tissues obtained
  from non-small-cell lung cancer with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma subtype.
