caption: LPS facilitates extracellular calcium entry through plasma membrane Orai
  channels, a mechanism known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (1). SOCE is
  activated through an upstream mechanism involving calcium depletion from intracellular
  stores. Upon ER depletion (2), calcium dissociates from the ER membrane resident
  calcium sensor STIM2, triggering STIM2 translocation to ER-PM junctions where it
  forms a complex with STIM1 and Orai subunits to form an active calcium channel (3).
  SOCE through Orai is tightly coupled to activation of the phosphatase calcineurin
  (4), which triggers activation of downstream substrates and promotes the expression
  of pro-inflammatory genes (5). Our data demonstrate that LPS requires an intact
  SOCE pathway including STIM2, Orai, and calcineurin to trigger pro-inflammatory
  gene expression through undefined, indirect mechanisms. We previously showed that
  RGS10 (R10) suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in a G-protein
  independent mechanism. Here, we show that RGS10 selectively interacts with STIM2,
  and RGS10-mediated regulation of LPS response requires activation of the STIM2-Orai-Calcineurin
  pathway (6). Depletion of intracellular calcium (2) activates SOCE and enhances
  LPS response (7), and RGS10 suppresses SOCE triggered by store depletion (8). In
  addition to G protein-independent regulation of LPS response, RGS10 also mediates
  signaling in microglia through its canonical interaction with Gαi subunits (9).
  The interplay of RGS10 co-regulation of these two critical pathways and the specific
  role of RGS10-STIM2 biochemical interaction is unknown. It is plausible that RGS10
  regulates SOCE and downstream pro-inflammatory response by interacting with and/or
  modulating STIIM2 function such as STIM2 activation, PM translocation, and interaction
  with STIM1/Orai channel (3). Similar to the regulation of TLR4 response, RGS10 also
  suppresses thrombin-stimulated pro-inflammatory genes through a mechanism requiring
  Orai activity, suggesting that RGS10 has the potential to regulate a broad range
  of inflammatory responses that depend on SOCE. The effects of pharmacological agents
  Thapsigargin (TG), YM58483 (YM), and cyclosporine A (CsA) are shown.
