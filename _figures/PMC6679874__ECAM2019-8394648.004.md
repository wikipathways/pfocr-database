caption: The regulation of genes and myomiRs expression in the IGF/PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway during myogenesis. Control senescent myoblast cells demonstrated a significantly
  decreased expression of genes on Day 0 of differentiation, as indicated by red arrow.
  However, the expression of genes and myomiRs was significantly increased in C. vulgaris-treated
  young and senescent myoblasts cells throughout the differentiation day, as indicated
  by green arrows.
