caption: ER Ca2+ dynamics and homeostasis. ER Ca2+ homeostasis is controlled by the
  orchestrated action of SERCA, IP3R, RyR, and Ca2+-regulating proteins. Ca2+ uptake
  into the ER from the cytosol is mainly driven by SERCA. Phosphorylation of phospholamban
  (PLN) activates SERCA through stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor (AR)/protein
  kinase (PK)-A signaling pathway. When the Ca2+ stores in the ER are full, calnexin
  (CNX) and CRT reduce the activity of SERCA. Meanwhile, Ca2+ release from the lumen
  of the ER into the cytosol is mediated mainly by IP3R and RyR. IP3R is activated
  by binding of IP3 that is produced through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated
  activation of PLC. IP3R is inhibited by ER resident protein ERp44, depending on
  ER Ca2+ concentration. RyR activity is modulated by phosphorylation of serine and
  calstabin binding. PKA activation via β-AR stimulation directly phosphorylates RyR
  and increases its activity, inducing dissociation from calstabins. Once Ca2+ is
  depleted in the ER lumen, dissociation of Ca2+ from the STIM proteins leads to STIM
  oligomerization and interaction with the plasma membrane Ca2+ release–activated
  Ca2+ channel protein (Orai) to increase Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu.
  SERCA colocalizes with STIM–Orai complex and pumps Ca2+ directly from the cytosol
  to allow ER Ca2+ store refilling. ERp57 interacts with CNX, CRT, and STIM, regulating
  SERCA activity and SOCE. Furthermore, Ca2+ store in the ER is closely associated
  with ER protein homeostasis. Alteration in ER homeostasis activates unfolded protein
  response through three ER stress sensors [inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE)-1, protein
  kinase RNA–like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF)-6] that
  are inactive and bound to BiP in the absence of stress. AC, adenylyl cyclase; ATF,
  activating transcription factor; Gs, stimulatory G-protein; MCU, mitochondrial Ca2+
  uniporter.

  description: ER Ca2+ dynamics and homeostasis. ER Ca2+ homeostasis is controlled
    by the orchestrated action of SERCA, IP3R, RyR, and Ca2+-regulating proteins.
    Ca2+ uptake into the ER from the cytosol is mainly driven by SERCA. Phosphorylation
    of phospholamban (PLN) activates SERCA through stimulation of the β-adrenergic
    receptor (AR)/protein kinase (PK)-A signaling pathway. When the Ca2+ stores in

    Ca2+ release from the lumen of the ER into the cytosol is mediated mainly by IP3R
