caption: Network of interactions between GWAS candidate genes using ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA). The network shows molecular interactions between the products of
  the candidate genes enriched for significantly associated SNPs (P < 10−4) with large
  tumor suppressor kinases 1 (LATS1) and 2 (LATS2) as the most interesting candidates.
  Relationships were determined using information contained in the IPA repository.
  The blue label indicates the genes that were enriched for significantly associated
  SNPs. The network was obtained using the global gene list determined by combining
  gene lists for all traits
