caption: In the classic nuclear signaling pathway (1) progesterone activates progesterone
  receptor (PR) by binding and inducing conformational changes of the receptor causing
  in turn nuclear translocation, dimerization and binding to progesterone response
  elements (PRE) in the promoters or enhancer regions of PR target genes. Progestin
  treatment rapidly activates extranuclear signaling of a subpopulation of PR localized
  in the membrane or cytoplasm to transiently associate with c-Src through interaction
  with the PR polyproline domain (PPD) leading to activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt), or Janus kinase/signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways. Activated
  MAPK further regulates PR transcriptional activity through phosphorylation of PR,
  co-activators (1) or other transcription factors (2). Rapid progestin activation
  of MAPK can directly phosphorylate PR or co-activators (1) or promote PR phosphorylations
  through CK2 and CDK2 (see text for details). Alternatively, activation of various
  cytoplasmic signaling pathways may phosphorylate and increase transcriptional activity
  of other transcription factors, independent of PREs (2). Rapid extranuclear activation
  of ER/PR complexes by progestins activates MAPK leading to a formation of phospho-PR/MAPK/Msk1
  (Mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase 1), chromatin remodeling and enhanced
  MMTV and PRE-containing gene transcription (3). PR extranuclear activation of Src/PI3K/Akt
  may stimulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) triggering
  actin cytoskeleton remodeling and promotion of cell motility (4). Alternatively,
  PR extranuclear signaling may cross-communicate with growth factor signaling such
  as epidermal growth factor (EGF) leading to activation of MAPK and downstream events
  (5). Membrane localized progestin receptor (mPR) unrelated to the classical PR mediates
  progestin extranuclear signaling through GPCR-like membrane proteins via modulation
  of adenylate cyclase (AC), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase
  A (PKA). mPR has been reported to activate MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
  More work is needed to define the physiological significance of extranuclear mPR
  activation of these several cytoplasmic signaling pathways in BC cells.
