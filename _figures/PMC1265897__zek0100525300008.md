caption: The actin cytoskeleton as a downstream part of signal transduction in regulating
  polarized morphogenesis. A model is presented in which the central pathways to the
  actin cytoskeleton regulating endocytosis and secretion are incorporated via Cdc42
  into the morphogenetic cascade of C. albicans. Ras1-induced signaling activates
  the cAMP pathway and a MAP kinase cascade that activates hypha-specific gene expression
  and may also lead to activation of the Cdc42 module. Defects in the actin cytoskeleton
  machinery affecting either endocytosis (e.g., via Wal1) or polarisome function (e.g.,
  via Bni1 or Spa2) inhibit mycelial development, indicating the relevance of membranous
  vesicle transport and cycling for polarized growth. The dashed arrow connecting
  Cdc42 and Wal1 is to indicate the fact that Wal1 lacks a G protein binding domain
  and can thus be activated only indirectly by Cdc42. Some other pathways regulating
  gene expression upon hyphal induction, e.g., the Tup1/Nrg1/Rbf1 pathway and the
  pH-Rim101 pathway, have been omitted for clarity.
