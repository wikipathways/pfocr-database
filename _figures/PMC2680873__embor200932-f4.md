caption: Model for the coordinated regulatory action of both the miRNA and siRNA pathways
  during the maintenance of AGO1 homeostasis. DCL1 processes MIR168 transcripts to
  produce the mature miR168, which associates with AGO1 protein and mediates cleavage
  of AGO1 messenger RNA (mRNA). AGO1 protein preferentially stabilizes miR168, which
  helps keep the levels of AGO1 mRNA, and thus the miRNA pathway, in check. In addition
  to miR168-directed regulation of AGO1, AGO1 mRNA also gives rise to transcripts
  that are substrates for SGS3, SDE5 and RDR6 and to the production of dsRNA, which
  is processed by DCL2 and DCL4 to produce siRNAs that regulate the level of AGO1
  mRNA. AGO, ARGONAUTE; DCL, DICER-LIKE; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; miRNA, microRNA;
  RDR6, RNA DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6; SDE5, SILENCING DEFECTIVE 5; SGS3, SUPPRESSOR
  OF GENE SILENCING 3; siRNA, short interfering RNA.
