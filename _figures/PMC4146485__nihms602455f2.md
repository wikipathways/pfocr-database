caption: 'After binding to its receptor (1), speract stimulates a membrane guanylyl
  cyclase (GC), which elevates cGMP (2) that activates tetrameric cGMP-regulated K+
  channels (tetraKCNG), causing a membrane potential (Em) hyperpolarization (4) due
  to K+ efflux (3). This Em change may activate a Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE) (5a), remove
  inactivation from voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (CaV), enhance hyperpolarization-activated
  and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN), and facilitate Ca2+ extrusion (5d) by
  K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCKX). sNHE activation increases pHi (5a). HCN
  opening causes Na+ influx (5c) and contributes to depolarize Em activating CaVs,
  which increase [Ca2+]i (6) and enhance asymmetric flagellar bending allowing sperm
  to turn. Possibly, the rise of [Ca2+]i also opens Ca2+-regulated K+ channels (CaKC)
  and Ca2+-regulated Cl channels (CaCC), which then contribute to again hyperpolarize
  Em (7), removing inactivation from CaV channels and opening HCN channels. During
  this period sperm swim in a straighter trajectory whose regulation is ill defined
  but critical for chemotaxis. This succession of events occurs cyclically, generating
  orchestrated transient [Ca2+]i increases (6) that produce a sequence of turns until
  one or more of the second messengers in the pathway are downregulated. The pHi (5a)
  and cAMP increases (5b) stimulate an undetermined Ca2+ influx pathway that contributes
  to the sustained [Ca2+]i increase (6), and possibly to the depolarization that accompanies
  the speract response. It is now worth exploring if CatSper participates in this
  process. Inset: A sperm drifting circular swimming trajectory in a chemoattractant
  gradient (orange shadow surrounding the egg) is stimulated periodically due to changes
  in the rate of chemoattractant capture. When swimming towards the egg in an ascending
  gradient, the onset of [Ca2+]i fluctuations is suppressed until the cell detects
  an ascending to descending gradient inversion. After a ∼200 ms delay, the spermatozoon
  undergoes a transient [Ca2+]i increase just before reaching the gradient minima
  (yellow circles). The rate of change in [Ca2+]i (d[Ca2+]i/dt) controls sperm trajectory.
  As a result, sperm turn (yellow) when they are swimming away from the egg and swim
  in a straighter trajectory (blue) while coming closer to the chemoattractant source
  (i. e., the egg jelly).'
