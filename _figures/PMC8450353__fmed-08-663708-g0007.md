caption: Schematic representation of Ang II/AT1R-induced inflammatory pathway with
  cytokine release. During infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus binds ACE2 reducing
  the ACE2 transcription and inhibiting the capacity of ACE2 to mediate the cleavage
  of angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1–7. The accumulation of Ang II triggers
  signals through its receptor AT1R inducing ROS production. ROS triggers the secretion
  of CyPA that acts as a stress factor activating the ERK1/2 kinase and overproduction
  of ROS through a positive feedback loop. ROS-sensitive 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase (PDK1) activation that contributes to phosphorylation and activation
  of Akt. A parallel pathway involves the NOX-dependent generation of ROS that activates
  the p38 MAP kinase (p38MAPK) which recruits MAPKAPK2 leading to AkT phosphorylation
  on a second amino acid position leading to full activation of the p38 MAPK–Akt complex,
  the activation of IKKαβ inducing the release of IkB from the IκB–NF-κB complexes,
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and the production of cytokines including TNF-α
  and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) via disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)
  followed by the activation of the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 AMP) which, by feedback regulation,
  activates both the NF-κB and STAT3 transcription factors and the production of IL-6.
  SARS-CoV-2 itself activates NF-κB via the TLR3 receptor. Ang II, angiotensin II;
  AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NOX, NADPH oxidase;
  IKK, IkB kinase; CyPA, cyclophilin A; TLR3, Toll-like receptor 3; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor κB.
