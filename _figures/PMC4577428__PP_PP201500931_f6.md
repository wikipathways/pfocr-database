caption: Prokaryotic pathway of glycerolipid synthesis. The normal synthetic pathway
  is indicated by solid arrows; the dotted line indicates the overloading of 16:0-ACP
  as a substitute for 18:1-ACP that occurs in the fab1 mutant. FAD4 is responsible
  for trans-16:1 synthesis; mutations at all the other indicated loci (in red) suppress
  the fab1 mutation to some degree and are described in the text. DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  FA, fatty acid.
