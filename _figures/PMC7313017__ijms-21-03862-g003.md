caption: 'Mechanism of heavy metal imparts endothelial inflammation. ROS generation
  induced by metal exposure from various pathways, which activates an inflammatory
  cascade via NF-kB, mediated signaling, which triggers the inflammatory gene transcriptions
  and augments the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as (TNF-α, IL-1,
  IL-6, and IL-12). Further, TNF-activation phosphorylated IkB and induced activation
  of the NF-kB pathway. Thus aggravates the inflammatory and oxidative cycle leading
  eventually to endothelial dysfunction and promoting CSVD. Abbreviations: TNF: Tumor
  Necrosis Factor, IL-1: Interleukin-1, IL-6: Interleukin-6, IL-12: Interleukin-12,
  ROS: Reactive oxygen species, NADPH oxidase: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  oxidase, IkB kinase: Inhibitor of kB, NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B.'
