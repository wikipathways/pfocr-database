caption: (A) Overview of strategy and process for a mammalian functional screen. Six
  tandem copies of a LEF/TCF response element (6× CCTTTGATC) were positioned upstream
  of an IL-2 minimal promoter to drive expression of the reporter GFP gene. The reporter
  construct was transfected into HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and a stable cell
  line (REP) was selected. The REP cell lines were further modified by transfection
  with an expression vector encoding LEF-1 followed by selection of a stable cell
  line (REP-LEF). The reporter gene is inactive in REP and REP-LEF cells. The REP-LEF
  cells were used to screen a plasmid-based cDNA library prepared from human tumor
  cells, GFP-expressing cells were selected by FACS. (B) Reporter gene evaluation
  by transient transfection with test plasmids. HT1080 cells were cotransfected with
  the wt reporter gene (wt 6×TCF-IL-2-GFP) (bars 1 to 14) or a reporter gene with
  mutations in the LEF/TCF binding site (mu 6×TCF-IL-2-GFP) (bars 7a to 10a) and either
  an empty expression vector (Control Vector) (bars 1, 7, 11, and 7a) or an expression
  vector encoding β-catenin (wt β-catenin) (bars 2, 8, 12, and 8a), an activated mutant
  form of β-catenin (ΔN89β-catenin) (bars 3, 9, 13, and 9a), Wnt-1 (bars 4, 10, 14,
  and 10a), LEF-1 (bar 5), or TCF-4 (bar 6). Bars 1 to 6, cells transfected with the
  indicated individual expression vectors; bars 7 to 10 and 7a to 10a, cells transfected
  with the indicated expression vectors along with a LEF-1 expression vector; bars
  11 to 14, cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors along with a TCF-4
  expression vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the fluorescence level
  of GFP-expressing cells was determined by FACS. The error bars indicate standard
  deviations. (C) Confirmation of protein expression. Protein extracts were prepared
  from the transfected cells evaluated in panel B and analyzed by Western immunoblotting
  with an antibody directed against the HA epitope tag encoded at the amino terminus
  of each protein. LEF-1 comigrates with a background band. (D) Evaluation of the
  REP cell line, containing a stable integration of the reporter gene, with test vectors.
  REP cells were transfected with either an empty expression vector (Control Vector)
  (bars 1, 7, and 11) or expression vectors encoding wt β-catenin (bars 2, 8, and
