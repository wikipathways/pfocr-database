caption: T cell senescence-related signaling pathways. Tumor-derived cAMP can be transferred
  to T cells, activating the PKA-CREB signaling pathway, which in turn activates DNA
  damage and induces T cell senescence. T cell competition for glucose triggers ATM-related
  DNA damage, activates the ERK1/2 and P38 pathways, and interacts with STAT1/3, which
  leads to T cell cycle arrest and aging. Activation of the P38 pathway induces the
  downregulation of TERT, leading to DNA damage. The downregulation of TCR signaling
  can activate the P38 pathway and inhibit the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, thereby
  inactivating autophagy and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production
  in senescent T cells. DNA damage induced by the GATA4-C/EBPβ signaling pathway leads
  to increased secretion of SASP molecules. Similarly, the cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  also leads to increased secretion of SASP molecules
