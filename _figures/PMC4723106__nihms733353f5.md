caption: (A) Reaction mechanism of DOXP reductoisomerase (DXR), which is part of the
  MEP pathway for synthesis of the essential isoprenoids dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Fosmidomycin and FR900098 are competitive
  inhibitors of DXR. (B) Active site of E. coli DXR (PDB 1ONP) bound to fosmidomycin
  (FSM, in green) and manganese (purple). Metal-coordinated water is represented as
  a red sphere.
