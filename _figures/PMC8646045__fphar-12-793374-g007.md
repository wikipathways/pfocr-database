caption: Illustration of the working hypothesis of the role of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway (CAIP) in control and 6-OHDA rats and the role of the α7nAChR in preventing
  inflammation in 6-OHDA rats. At steady state, the strong vagal tone determines the
  shift in the CAIP towards tolerance by causig the release of a sufficient amount
  of ACh, and muscular macrophages exhibit a resident phenotype. In 6-OHDA rats, lesions
  in the SN induce a decrease in vagal tone, and the CAIP shifts towards inflammation
  due to inadequate release of ACh, which induces an increased number of resident/proinflammatory
  macrophages and the subsequent production of inflammatory mediators. Stimulating
  α7nAChR on activated macrophages leads to the inhibition of inflammatory mediator
  production and restoration of intestinal immune homeostasis.
