caption: Kidney cancer is not a single disease; it is made up of a number of different
  types of cancer with different histologies, having different clinical courses, responding
  differently to therapy and caused by different genes (e.g., VHL, MET, FLCN, FH,
  SDHB/C/D, TFE3, TFEB, MITF, TSC1, TSC2 and PTEN)., The PTEN gene, which is frequently
  found to be mutated in the germline of patients affected with Cowden Syndrome, encodes
  for a plasma membrane lipid phosphatase that inhibits the PI3K signaling pathway.
  Loss of PTEN leads to accumulation of phosphatidlyinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3),
  which activates AKT. Activation of AKT affects the TSC1/2 pathway, resulting in
  activation of the mTOR pathway. (Adapted from Linehan.)
