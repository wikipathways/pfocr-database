caption: Integrated grapevine HY5 and HYH community gene co-expression and cis-regulatory
  subnetwork. Square and circle nodes indicate co-expressed target genes and the presence
  of various HY5 consensus CREs predicted in co-expressed target genes. Square nodes
  indicate putative functions of co-expressed target genes; DNA repair, flavonoid,
  HSP and chaperones, jasmonic acid, photosynthesis, terpenes, transporters, and UV
  markers. Circle nodes, shown as pie charts, indicate the type of HY5 consensus CRE
  present in the promoter region of each co-expressed gene. Edges represent significant
  co-expression between each unique and shared HY5 and HYH subnetwork. Edges also
  indicate the nodes supported by one, two, three, four, five, and six co-expression
  networks. Gene IDs can be found in . (This figure is available in colour at JXB
  online.)
papertitle: The photomorphogenic factors UV-B RECEPTOR 1, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5, and
  HY5 HOMOLOGUE are part of the UV-B signalling pathway in grapevine and mediate flavonol
  accumulation in response to the environment.
