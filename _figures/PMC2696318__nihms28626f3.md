caption: The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated either by the p85 PI3K regulatory subunit
  binding to an activated tyrosine residue on the activated growth factor receptor
  or via interaction with Ras. Both result in the membrane localization of PI3K. Some
  of the downstream effects of activation of PI3K pathway are shown. PIP2 is phosphorylated
  by PI3K to create PIP3 which promotes membrane localization of PDK1 through its
  PH domain. PDK1 then phosphorylates and activates Akt. Proteins activated by S/T
  phosphorylation induced by the PI3K/Akt pathway are indicated by a clear circle
  with a black P. Proteins inactivated by S/T phosphorylation induced by the PI3K/Akt
  pathway are shown in black circles with white P. Note that depending on the phosphorylation
  residue, some proteins can either be activated or inactivated by phosphorylation.
  Transcription factors are indicated by diamonds are similarly marked. Phosphatases
  are indicated in squares and those which inhibit activity are indicated in black
  rectangles (PTEN & SHIP) while the PP2A phosphatase which activates Raf is shown
  in a white rectangle. Arrows from phosphatases to the regulatory phosphates are
  indicated in open arrows.
