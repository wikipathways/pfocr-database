caption: The regulatory network of ILC2s in the tumor microenvironment. Influenced
  by the local microenvironment, ILC2s exist the signal and functional cross-talk
  with other immune cells and exhibit inhibitory (left) or facilitating (right) effects
  on tumors. A regulatory network is formed centered on ILC2s, which act as a crucial
  regulator in tumor immunity. Specific tumor types associated with each pathway have
  been marked with colorful spots. M2-TAM M2 tumor-associated macrophages, MDSC myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells, GM-CSF granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, CXCL2
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2, CCL5 C-C motif chemokine ligand 5.
