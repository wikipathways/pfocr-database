caption: 'Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  the resumption of meiosis. LH surge results in the dephosphorylation and deactivation
  of NPR2 via the phosphoprotein of phosphatase (PPP)-family in the cumulus granulosa
  cell [], NPPC production and secretion in the mural granulosa cell. The LH/LHR-induced
  activation of cAMP/PKA increases the following compounds in the mural granulosa
  cell: phosphorylation of the cGMP-PDE5, EGF and EGF-like factors production and
  secretion, and ER expression []. The rapid phosphorylation of the cGMP-PDE5 is responsible
  for converting cGMP into 5’GMP, causes the outward diffusion of intraoocyte cGMP,
  leads to the release of cAMP-PDE activity within the oocyte, in turn, the activated
  cAMP-PDE catalyses the cAMP into AMP, ultimately results in meiotic resumption [];
  The production of EGF and EGF-like factors activates the EGFR signaling elevates
  calcium of cumulus granulosa cells further to inactivate NPR2 []; Furthermore, the
  decrease of ER serves as an augment step []. cGMP-PDE5: cGMP phosphodiesterase 5;
  EGF-like factors: amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and β-cellulin (BTC)'
