caption: 'From the extracellular matrix to HIF and from HIF to the extracellular matrix.
  a The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an essential component of the physicochemical
  environment of the cell, and includes fibrous proteins, glycoconjugates, growth
  factors and hormones. The chemical composition of the ECM can impact on HIF through
  growth factor stimulation. It has been shown that growth factors, by activating
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), can target mTOR and consequently HIF. As discussed
  above, the action of mTOR on HIF is a subject of debate. Essentially two options
  have been proposed: inhibition of HIF translation and/or inhibition of proteasomal
  degradation. Both converge to activate HIF. Growth factors could also activate HIF
  through the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. It has been proposed that
  phosphorylation of HIF by ERK could indirectly increase HIF activity by inhibiting
  the export of this transcription factor from the nucleus. As a consequence the activation
  of HIF target genes would be more efficient when HIF is phosphorylated. Moreover
  the vasoactive hormone angiotensin II has been shown to promote HIF-1α transcription
  through a protein kinase B (PKB) dependent mechanism. Finally, the physical density
  of the ECM could also indirectly influence the HIF pathway by modulating the oxygen
  diffusion length (not shown here). b A variety of HIF-induced genes have been shown
  to directly play a role on cell motility, invasion and extracellular matrix modulation
  (blue). A hypothetical mechanism for the loss of cell junctions under hypoxia could
  implicate the HIF-dependent activation of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) leading to
  stimulation of Snail. This transcriptional inhibitor could then downregulate E-cadherin
  (E-cad) and promote invasion. However, the subject of the ECM is also linked to
  other HIF-dependent actions, for instance, extracellular acidification could participate
  in mechanisms of invasion. Finally, the growth of neo-vessels, under the control
  of HIF, is also a crucial element in the penetration of cancer cells into the circulation.
