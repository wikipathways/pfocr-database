caption: TLR4 receptors are responsible for the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) monomers and partially oxidized LDL (oLDL) on innate immune cells. LPS monomers
  and oLDL bind to sites on the protein, CD14. CD14 promotes the binding of these
  ligands to the TLR4-MD-2 complex, which signals the activation of the nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. NF-κB products enter the nucleus and result in transcription
  followed by the production of cytokines and the activation of multiple inflammatory
  pathways. This figure was adapted from DeFranco et al. .
