caption: Choline metabolic pathway. Choline is an essential biological molecule for
  all cells and is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin,
  which are the major components of the plasma membrane. New cell membrane synthesis
  requires the rate-limiting step of choline uptake, followed by phospholipid biosynthesis.
  Choline is also a precursor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the methyl
  donor betaine, which are involved in several important biological functions. Betaine,
  an oxidized metabolite of choline, is a source of methyl groups for the production
  of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which serves as a substrate for DNA and histone methyltransferases,
  and is thus required for the establishment and maintenance of the epigenome. Epigenetic
  mechanisms play important roles in biology and human diseases. ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
