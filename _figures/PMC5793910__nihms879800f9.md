caption: Schematic diagram of proposed sst2signaling pathway involved in SST-induced
  hyperpolarization of subicular BCs. SST activates sst2 receptors resulting in activation
  of the inhibitory G-proteins (Gαi). Activation of Gαi inhibits the activity of adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) leading to a reduction of intracellular cAMP level from ATP and a decrease
  of the function of Epac2. The downregulation of cAMP/Epac2 activity results in activation
  of K+ channels including GIRK and KCNQ channels and/or tonic inhibition of a Na+-permeable
  cation channel to hyperpolarize subicular neurons.
