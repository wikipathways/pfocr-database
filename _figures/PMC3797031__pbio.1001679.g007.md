caption: Previous studies indicated a role of TORC1 (a known cell size regulator)
  in activity-dependent muscle growth (1). TORC1 regulates growth by inhibiting the
  translation initiation inhibitor eIF4EBP (2) and by activation of S6K (3) , both
  leading to increased translation. In the absence of muscle activity, muscle fibers
  undergo atrophy, a reduction in size and strength. Both the FoxO/Atrogin-1 axis
  (4) and the calcineurin pathway (5) contribute to atrophy. We found that during
  muscle development lack of muscle activity increases the levels of eIF4EBP3L in
  muscle (6) and reduces the activity of TORC1 pathway (1), preventing eIF4EBP3L phosphorylation
  (2) and thereby activating it. High levels of active eIF4EBP3L prevent initiation
  of protein synthesis from specific mRNAs (7). Among mRNAs regulated by TORC1/eIF4EBP3L
  is that encoding the transcription factor Mef2ca, which is also regulated by calcineurin
  and is required for normal myofibrilogenesis and muscle growth (8). We hypothesize
  that other mRNAs are also differentially regulated by the activity/TORC1/eIF4EBP3L
  axis (9) and contribute to muscle homeostasis along with the FoxO and calcineurin
  pathways.
