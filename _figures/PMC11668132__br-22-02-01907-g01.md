caption: Effects of quercetin on cancer cellular biomolecules and functions. (A) Apoptosis
  induction. Quercetin promotes the upregulation of pro-survival proteins such as
  p53, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl while simultaneously downregulating pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bax and Bad. This regulatory shift creates a favorable environment for apoptosis.
  When quercetin induces this expression pattern, it leads to the release of cytochrome
  c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, which is crucial for apoptosome formation.
  The formation of an apoptosome activates a cascade of caspase enzymes, including
  caspase-3, -6 and -9. The activation of these caspases is the final step that initiates
  the execution phase of apoptosis, leading to programmed cell death. (B) Oxidative
  stress. Internalized quercetin can be converted into quercetin radicals such as
  quercetin-semiquinone and quercetin-quinone due to peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation
  in the cytoplasm, which produces the pro-oxidative state in the cell. Then, it activates
  the Nrf2 and Trx in the cytoplasm and the activation of the ARE pathway to trigger
  antioxidant enzyme and protein synthesis. (C) Angiogenesis-related inhibition. VEGF
  and VEGF-R2 are activated to upregulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, which promotes
  the endothelial cell proliferation and migration during cancer cell development.
  Quercetin reduces the availability of these potent angiogenetic factors. Nrf2, nuclear
  factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; Trx, thioredoxin; ARE, antioxidant response
  element; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GSH, glutathione
