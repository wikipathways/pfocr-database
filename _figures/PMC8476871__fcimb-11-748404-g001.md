caption: Schematic representation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The canonical pathway is activated by a plethora of trigger/stimuli that
  includes different pathogens, stress signals, growth factors and inflammatory cytokine
  exposure which converges on the IKK complex. Activation of the NF-κB is tightly
  regulated due to the sequestration of the complex by IκBα in the cytosol. Phosphorylation
  of IκBα via IKK is a signal for its degradation, which is mediated by β-TrCP containing
  SCF-ubiquitin ligase complex. Freed dimers subsequently translocate to the nucleus
  where they bind to κB elements that controls the transcriptions of a variety of
  genes, which includes genes responsible for cytokine, chemokines, cell survival
  and proliferation. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway is dependent on the phosphorylation-induced
  p100 processing triggered by signaling from a subset of TNFR members. This pathway
  is reliant on NIK and IKKα, but not on the trimeric IKK complex, and mediates the
  activation of RelB/p52 complex. The detailed pathway is described in text.
