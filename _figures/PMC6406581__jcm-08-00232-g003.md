caption: 'Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. mTOR1 is triggered by certain
  growth factors and is generally anabolic, making it an important enzyme in both
  cancer and processes related to autophagy. Cellular stressors, such as hypoxia or
  cellular starvation, lead to the inhibition of mTOR, thus, activating the autophagy
  pathway. mTOR1 inhibits specific enzyme subunits in the autophagy pathway, including
  Unc-51-like Kinase 1 complex (ULK1), autophagy related protein 13 (ATG13), and activating
  molecule in Beclin 1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (AMBRA). mTOR1 activation has
  several metabolic downstream effects, including increased lipogenesis, increased
  glycolysis, and increased protein synthesis. mTOR is inhibited by compounds in the
  rapamycin pathway, including everolimus. PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase, AKT: Protein
  kinase B, PRAS 40: proline-rich AKT substrate of 40kd, PRR5: proline-rich protein
  5, AMPK: adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase, SREBP1: sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein 1, PPAR γ: peroxisome proliferatory-activated
  receptor γ, GLUT1: glucose transporter 1, FIP200: focal adhesion kinase family interacting
  protein of 200 kd.'
