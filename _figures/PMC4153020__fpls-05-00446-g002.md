caption: 'Overview of release, homeostatic control, and signaling of extracellular
  ATP. Wounding (i.e., cell breakage) is a good example of the release of ATP molecules
  shown as “lightning” symbols. In addition, a variety of stimuli, e.g., abiotic and
  biotic stresses can induce ATP release (see Table  in detail). These events are
  suggested to be mediated by an ABC transporter (), PM-ANT1 transporter (), or exocytotic
  secretion (). Once cellular ATP (1–10 mM) appears in the apoplast, ATP becomes a
  signal, i.e., a DAMP signal. The released ATP is then recognized by plasma membrane-localized
  purinergic receptor, P2K1 (DORN1; left side), which in turn can elevate cytosolic
  free Ca2+ concentrations, [Ca2+] (). This causes production of nitric oxide (NO)
  or ROS (; ). The second messenger trio, Ca2+, NO, and ROS activates cellular signaling
  pathways that eventually lead to induction of various physiological responses, including
  activation of gene expression. The concentration of extracellular ATP is modulated
  through the action of ectoapyrases (APY; ) and other phosphatases, e.g., purple
  acid phosphatases (PAP; ). After hydrolyses, the end product AMP is further processed
  to adenosine (Ado) by hypothetical 5′-nucleotidases, 5NT () and further to adenine
  (Ade) by nucleoside hydrolases, NSH, e.g., NSH3 (). Both adenosine and adenine can
  be reimported into cells by equilibrative nucleoside transporters, ENT, e.g., ENT3
  () and hypothetical purine permeases (PUP), respectively, and then enter the salvage
  pathway (). In other respects, vacuole nucleosides from RNA degradation are exported
  into cytosolic area by another ENT, e.g., ENT1 (), that also contributes to cytosolic
  nucleotide pools. The figure was reconstructed from several schemes in the previous
  publications (; ; ; ; ). Abbreviations: Cyt, cytoplasm; PM, plasma membrane; ECM,
