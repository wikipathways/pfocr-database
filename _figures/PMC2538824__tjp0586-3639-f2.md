caption: 'A, in this generally accepted scheme (), nucleotide occupancy of the myosin
  (M) active site modifies myosin s binding affinity for actin (A), defining two general
  categories of crossbridges: ‘strong binding states’ (AM, AM.ADP) and ‘weak binding
  states’ (AM.ATP, AM.ADP.Pi); crossbridges in strong states may generate force; crossbridges
  in weak states do not and are mostly detached forms (M.ATP, M.ATP.Pi). The release
  of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is thought to power the working stroke. It is well established
  that crossbridge transitions involved in Pi release and force generation are reversible
  and, in the presence of Pi, both forward (ADP release and ATP binding) and backward
  (Pi rebinding and reversal of the power stroke) transitions of crossbridges from
  force-generating to non-force-generating states occur. However, myofibril slow kREL,
  measured in the absence of Pi, only probes forward detachment transitions that lead
  to ATP hydrolysis steps. B, 2-state crossbridge scheme. AMno force represents all
  weak binding states (mostly detached) and AMforce all strong binding states. The
  transition from the non-force-generating states to the force-generating states has
  an apparent rate constant fapp whereas gapp describes the return to the non-force-generating
  states by means of ADP release and ATP binding. The apparent rate constant for the
  reverse transition f′app that depends on [Pi] can be neglected under the conditions
  of the present study.'
