caption: The pathogenic mechanisms of RIPK1-deficiency and CRIA patients. (A) RIPK1
  is the key switch protein to mediate signal transduction downstream of TNFR1. TNF
  mediated TNFR1 trimerization results in recruitment of TRADD and RIPK1 through death-domain
  interactions to form complex I where post translational modifications (PTMs) by
  E3 ligases such as TRAFs, cIAPs and LUBAC or kinase complexes NEMO/IKK, TAK1/TAB2/3
  determine the cell fate either to activate NF-κB signaling or to execute programmed
  cell death pathways. RIPK1 activates itself through trans-autophosphorylation and
  then interacts with FADD/caspase-8 to form the complex II to undergo RIPK1-dependent
  apoptosis (RDA), or it binds RIPK3/MLKL to form the necrosome and to initiate necroptosis.
  Active caspase-8 can cleave RIPK1 at Asp324 to inhibit complex II formation, and
  the RIPK1 inactivation will shift the balance towards necroptotic signaling. (B)
  In PBMCs of CRIA patients, due to the pathogenic mutations at Asp324, RIPK1 activation
  and all downstream signaling pathways are amplified to promote inflammation and
  cytokine production. (C) In case of the RIPK1 deficiency caused by biallelic LoF
  mutations, complex I-mediated signaling and downstream events will be blocked, leading
  to decreased NF-κB activation and impaired cell death. However, deficiency of RIPK1
  may promote noncanonical TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-Caspase-8 signaling to activate inflammasome
  formation and necroptosis. (D) Non-cleavable RIPK1 in CRIA patients fibroblasts
  causes reduced inflammatory signaling and necroptosis, but almost unchanged levels
  of apoptosis under TNFR1 signaling pathway. Besides, the decreased production of
  ROS in fibroblasts through yet unknown mechanisms leads to reduced ferroptosis.
