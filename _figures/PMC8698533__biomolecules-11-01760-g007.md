caption: Proposed role of C. glutamicum MmpA in trehalose corynomycolate synthesis
  and transport. Corynomycolic acids, synthesized by the FAS-I and FAS-II pathways
  and Pks13, are linked to trehalose to form keto-TMCM and the keto group is subsequently
  reduced by CmrA reductase to form hTMCM. The hydroxylated corynomycolic acid in
  hTMCM is acetylated by the membrane acetyltransferase, TmaT, and AcTMCM transported
  across the IM by CmpL1 or CmpL4. AcTMCM is deacetylated by an unknown enzyme in
  the periplasmic space (dashed arrows) and hTMCM used as a corynomycolic acid donor
  by corynomycolyltransferases (CMTs) to synthesize h2TDCM or mycolated AG. Released
  trehalose is recycled by the LpqY-SucABC importer complex []. Additional acylation
  variants exist of hTMCM, AcTMCM and hTDCM []. Results of the current study place
  NCgl2761 (MmpA, orange) at the same step of the pathway as NCgl2759 (TmaT) [] and
  NCgl2764 (MtrP) [].
