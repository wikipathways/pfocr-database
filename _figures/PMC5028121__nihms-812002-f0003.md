caption: When blood is exposed to a variety of surfaces and natural compounds (often
  with a net negative charge), the plasma zymogens factor XII and prekallikrein (PK)
  bind to the surface and reciprocally activate each other. Binding of PK is facilitated
  by the cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK). The process is probably triggered
  by traces of factor XIIa or α-kallikrein present in plasma. α-kallikrein can cleave
  HK to release the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin. The kallikrein-kinin may have
  several functions, including contributing to the innate immune response to microorganism
  invasion. While factor XIIa can initiate thrombin generation through the intrinsic
  pathway of coagulation (yellow arrows) by activating factor XI, the kallikrein-kinin
  system does not appear to be required for hemostasis. Humans and other animals lacking
  factor XII, PK or HK do not have a bleeding disorder. However, there is mounting
  evidence that contact activation-induced coagulation through the intrinsic pathway
  may contribute to growth of pathologic clots during thrombosis. The nomenclature
  and symbols are the same as those used in Figure 1.
