caption: In order to introduce H3K4me3 methylation around WNT10B promotor, LINC00926
  associates with MLL1 and brings it to the promotor of WNT10B. This presence of MLL1/LINC00926
  complex around WNT10B promotor upstream of TSS, introduces H3K4me3 in this region
  in PTSD. This results in easy access of the transcription complex and thereby increased
  transcription of WNT10B leading to increased WNT signaling in PTSD. Consequently,
  the expression of inflammatory genes like IFNG and IL17A are elevated due to increased
  WNT signaling, leading to inflammatory state in PTSD patients. On the contrary,
  in controls, WNT10B expression is not altered and therefore it is present at physiologically
  favorable levels, and therefore, the expression of inflammatory genes is not affected.
