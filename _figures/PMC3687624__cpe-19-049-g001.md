  ). (A) In the absence of Wnts, β-catenin (β-cat) forms a complex with GSK-3β, Axin
  and APC and is phosphorylated by mainly GSK-3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin is conjugated
  with ubiquitin and then degraded by proteosome. Dkk, sclerostin (SOST) and Sfrp
  are secreted Wnt inhibitors; the two former molecules bind to LRP5/6, and the latter
  associates with Wnts. (B) When Wnts bind to Frizzled and LRP5 or LRP6 in a ternary
  complex at the cell surface, Axin is recruited away from the β-catenin destruction
  machine to LRP5 or LRP6, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin. Accumulated β-catenin
  translocates into the nucleus and activates LEF/ TCF-mediated gene transcription.
