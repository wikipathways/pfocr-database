caption: METTL14 is a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltration in
  rectal cancer. (A) GO analysis of the Arraystar Human m6A-mRNA Epitranscriptomic
  microarray data on the immunology. (B–F) KEGG analysis of the Arraystar Human m6A-mRNA
  Epitranscriptomic microarray data on the immunology (the enriched genes are highlighted
  in red in the signaling pathway map). (G–I) The expression level of METTL14 in the
  tissue array. (J) Log-rank survival analysis of METTL14 in the retrospective cohort.
