caption: Computational modeling combines receptor-ligand interactions with kinase
  signaling to downstream effectors. (a) Ordinary differential equations describe
  trafficking of CXCR4 and EGFR. (b) We constructed the computational model according
  to known mechanisms of EGFR and CXCR4 signaling. Variation in just three pathway
  components, PI3K, Ras, and mTORC1, sets heterogeneous pre-existing states and confers
  distinct Akt and ERK responses in single cells. This variation is described by allowing
  three rate parameters to vary between cells. A full description of the differential
  equations, parameters, and initial conditions can be found in Supplementary Information.
