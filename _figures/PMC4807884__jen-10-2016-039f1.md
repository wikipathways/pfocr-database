caption: Mechanisms of regulation of SMN2 gene expression in SMA. SMA is caused by
  low levels of SMN protein translated from full-length transcripts (5%–10%) generated
  from the SMN2 gene. Increase in the transcription of SMN2 gene generates higher
  levels of full-length SMN protein. Signaling pathways identified in SMA that may
  regulate expression of the SMN2 gene are presented. The MEK/ERK/ELK-1 pathway is
  activated in SMA and negatively regulates SMN2 expression. Inhibition of ERK pathway
  in vivo in SMA mice using MEK inhibitor (U0126) results in the upregulation of SMN2
  expression by the activation of the PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway. Treatment with NMDA also
  results in the activation of the AKT/CREB pathway that results in the upregulation
  of SMN2 expression. The activation of JAK2/STAT5 pathway in vivo by treatment with
  peptide hormone PRL results in an increase in SMN levels in SMA mice. Solid up arrows
  (red box) show increase in phosphorylation and dotted down arrows (yellow box) show
  decrease in phosphorylation.
