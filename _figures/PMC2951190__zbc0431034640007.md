caption: Schematic illustration of how DPAGT1 coordinates Wnt signaling with E-cadherin
  adhesion. In response to Wnt activation, β-catenin is stabilized and translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds to Tcf at the DPAGT1 promoter and activates DPAGT1
  expression. Increased expression of DPAGT1 promotes N-glycosylation of Wnt ligands
  and Wnt activity, which further up-regulates DPAGT1 expression. A Wnt-dependent
  increase in DPAGT1 expression leads to an increased N-glycosylation of E-cadherin
  (E-cad) with complex N-glycans, which interferes with intercellular adhesion.
