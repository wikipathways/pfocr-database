caption: 'Top: Simplified and schematic view of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
  (mAChRs) type M1, M3, and M5 and their signaling pathway. The receptors are coupled
  to trimeric Gq/11 proteins composed of α-, β-, and γ-subunits. Upon ligand binding,
  mAChR undergoes a conformational change, resulting in dissociation of the α-subunit,
  which activates phospholipase C. Activated phospholipase C promotes the hydrolysis
  of phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. One of the hydrolysis products, diacylglycerol,
  promotes the translocation of protein kinase C from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane
  followed by the activation of kinase. Activated kinase mediates the phosphorylation
  of various proteins, which activate several gene transcription factors. The second
  product of the hydrolysis, inositiol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, is translocated to its
  receptors integrated into endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the opening of calcium
  channels. Increasing intracellular calcium promotes several cellular responses.
  Middle: Simplified and schematic view of mAChRs type M2 and M4 including signaling
  pathway of the receptors coupled with trimeric Gi/o proteins. Upon ligand binding
  to the binding site of the receptor, the dissociated α-subunit inhibits adenylyl
  cyclase. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase results in a decreased level of intramolecular
  cAMP. Reduced levels of cAMP as a second messenger decreases an activity of cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of several proteins followed
  by various cellular responses. Bottom: Simplified view of nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors (nAChRs). The receptors are composed of five subunits and act as natural
  ion channels. Channels allow Na+, Ca2+ and K+ ions to flow down their electrochemical
  gradient; some of the channels enable the flow of selected cations only. The function
  of nAChRs can be modulated by neurotransmitters as well as by different toxins and
  drugs. The cross-section of the nAChR indicates binding sites of various modulators
  (colored triangles) and cation flow across the pore (colored arrows). The pentameric
  schematic view of nAChRs illustrates two main groups of the receptors (homomeric
  and heteromeric) with selected examples (α7, α9, α4β2, α4α6β2β3, and α3β4). The
  acetylcholine binding sites on nAChRs are depicted by green triangles. Abbreviations:
