caption: By inhibiting the transcription of erastin-induced protective genes, BACH1
  promotes ferroptosis. These genes, which include Hmox1, Slc7a11, Fth1, Ftl1, and
  Slc40a1, were related to the production of GSH and the intracellular metabolism
  of labile iron. RSL3 is a ferroptosis inducer and works by preventing the expression
  of GPX4. δ-TT-BMSCs reduce lipid peroxidation damage by down-regulating BACH1 expression
  and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit ferroptosis, thereby effectively
  improving wound healing.
