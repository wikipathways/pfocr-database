caption: Overview of the gene-pathway network (annotated network) created by cystoscope.
  The blue nodes represent the CRC candidate genes connected with the pathways and
  other nodes in the network. The orange nodes represent other pathways in connection
  with CRC genes. According to this network, it can be demonstrated that CDK1 is involved
  in all significant first-level pathways; it is associated with related genes in
  each of the pathways and with other most significant CRC-related genes (CCNA2, BUB1B,
  GADD45G, ATF3). The dominant pathway is cell cycle with padj 1.82 × 10−34.
