caption: The internal mechanism that leads to cellular senescence varies depending
  on the triggers and context. Several pathways contribute to the activation of cell-cycle
  inhibitors, inhibition of retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation, and cell-cycle
  arrest which is the main manifestation of cellular senescence. The production of
  various chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix
  remodeling factors which are named “senescence-associated secretory phenotype” (SASP)
  is also another significant manifestation of cellular senescence. Cellular senescence
  can be divided into replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence(SIPS).
  (I) In replicative senescence, telomere shortening may trigger activation of ataxia
  telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR)
  kinases, and result in p53 upregulation, and increased p21. (II) In stress-induced
  premature senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress may activate
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK3 and MKK6) pathway and their downstream
  effector p38, leading to the upregulation of p16, p53, and p21 level. DNA damage
  activates a signaling cascade via ATM/ATR kinases, p53 upregulation, and increased
  p21. In inflammation response, a component of the senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP) pathway named transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), may upregulate
  p21 level through SMAD complexes. Lastly, oncogenic signaling or loss of tumor suppressors
  upregulates p16, p53, and p21 levels, mediated by RAS, MYC, and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and their downstream effectors ATM, ATR, and ARF.
