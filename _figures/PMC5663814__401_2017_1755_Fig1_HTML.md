caption: A-syn oligomers play a central role in the multi-factorial causes of Parkinson’s
  disease. A-syn oligomers, as well as other a-syn variants, actively participate
  in disrupting mitochondrial function, autophagy and lysosomal degradation, membrane
  homeostasis, ER function and synapses, and can induce inflammation. Mitochondrial
  defects/fragmentation have been observed after insult with a-syn oligomers. A-syn
  oligomers can also cause calcium accumulation and complex dysfunction inside the
  mitochondria. ER stress and dysfunction a-syn oligomers associate with ER membranes
  and cause ER stress. Proteasomal dysfunction while the proteasome normally degrades
  proteins, a-syn oligomers can cause proteasomal dysfunction, which in turn results
  in the accumulation of a-syn oligomers. Inflammatory response microglial cells respond
  to a-syn oligomers and produce neuro-inflammatory signals. Membrane damage oligomers
  can interact with the plasma membrane stabilizing previous damage and allowing the
  flow of calcium, which cause cellular distress. Autophagic/lysosomal block blocking
  the lysosomal and autophagic pathway results in oligomeric accumulation of a-syn
  and its detrimental effects. Synaptic dysfunction oligomers can bind to synaptobrevin,
  preventing SNARE complex formation and disrupting synaptic recycling of vesicles.
  They can also impair the interaction between kinsesin and microtubules, impairing
  vesicular transport, and finally, a dopaminergic catabolite has been shown to promote
  oligomerization of a-syn, leading to dopamine leak at the synapse
