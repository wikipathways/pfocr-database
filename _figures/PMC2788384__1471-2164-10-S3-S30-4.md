caption: 'Generation of second messenger pathway. This is the same pathway as the
  one shown in Figure 3, but processed and visualized using cytoscape software [].
  The network of interactions is shown and the proteins that are either targeted by
  HIV-1, are an siRNA gene or are a drug target are highlighted in color: Purple -
  HIV-1 target according to Group 1; Blue - siRNA gene; Red - drug target; Yellow
  - drug, si-RNA and HIV-1 target; Green - si-RNA and drug target; Silver - drug and
  HIV-1 target; Brown - siRNA and HIV-1 target. Highlighted in green is one path leading
  from an input to an output node, and which is intercepted by an HIV-1 interaction.'
