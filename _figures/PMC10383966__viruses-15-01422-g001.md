caption: Major signaling pathways regulated by Pellino proteins. Pellino proteins
  act as intermediate signaling molecules between cytokine, RLR, and TLR in membranes
  or the cytosol, and transcription factors in the nucleus. Upon IL-1 binding, MyD88
  is recruited to the membrane-bound receptor IL-1R1 and IL-1RAP. The IRAK and Pellino
  proteins are further engaged and promote downstream activation of the IKK (IκB-kinase)
  complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκB. IκB becomes ubiquitinated and is degraded.
  This releases the transcription factor NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus
  where it activates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The pathway can branch
  to activate MAP kinases essential for activation of the transcription factors AP1
  and Elk1. The same signaling cascades can be activated by extracellular TLRs, including
  TLR2 and TLR4, which may be involved in the recognition of several viral surface
  proteins. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which bind single- and double-stranded RNA
  and DNA present in endosomes, can activate the same pathways in an MyD88-dependent
  or -independent manner. The latter requires TRIF and results in interactions between
  Pellino proteins and the two kinases IKKε and TBK1. Through phosphorylation, this
  results in the activation of IRFs. The IRFs form homo- and heterodimers that in
  the nucleus bind to promoter regions of genes encoding type I IFNs. The Pellino•IKKε•TBK1•IRF
  pathway is also engaged by RLRs such as RIG-I and MDA5, which recognizes viral RNA
  in the cytosol. These pathways also contribute to activation of the inflammasome.
  Pellino primes the inflammasome through the ubiquitination of NLRP3 and ASC. IL1B
  is among the many immune response genes activated by NF-κB. The gene transcript
  is translated into pro-IL-1β, which is activated through cleavage by caspase-1 in
  the inflammasome. In a similar manner, GSDMD (gasdermin-D) is cleaved. The N-terminal
  fragment N-GSDMD oligomerizes and forms membrane pores through which IL-1β is released.
  These pores can also contribute to pyroptotic cell death. The specific mechanisms
  engaged during viral infection appear to be cell type- and context-dependent (see
  text for details). The individual signaling cascades and the involvement of specific
  Pellino proteins are more comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [,].
