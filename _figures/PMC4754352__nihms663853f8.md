caption: 'Curcumin elevates the enzymes FASD2 and Elov2 in both liver and brain tissues
  and increases DHA levels in these tissues when fed in combination with ALA. In cultured
  liver cells, curcumin + DPA increases DHA production, an action which is prevented
  by inhibiting the FASD2 enzyme. Thus we propose that curcumin enhances DHA synthesis
  by increasing levels of DHA processing enzymes in the liver and brain, though we
  cannot say for sure whether the increased DHA content in the brain is a product
  of elevated DHA synthesis in the brain tissue or whether DHA produced in the liver
  is transported to the brain. FADS2: delta 6 desaturase, Elov2: elongase, ALA: α-linolenic
  acid DPA: Docosapentaenoic acid, DHA: Docosahexaenoic acid.'
