caption: 'The layered EGFR signaling pathway. (a) Ligands and receptors comprise the
  input layer. The respective ligands and their receptors have already been shown
  in Figure 1. The numbers 1, 2, and 4 represent the EGFR1, EGFR2, and EGFR4, respectively.
  (b) Signal processing layer comprises the interactive adaptor/enzyme layer. Two
  receptor dimers: EGFR1-EGFR1 homodimer and HER2-EGFR4 heterodimer are shown. Shc2,
  SHC adaptor protein; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; SOS, son of sevenless;
  Ras, rat sarcoma protein; Raf, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Src, proto-oncogene
  c-sarcoma; JAK, Janus kinase/signal transducers; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription protein family; PLCγ, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate;
  Ca2+, calcium cations; CAMK, calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; p85, regulatory
  subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; Akt, serine/threonine kinases; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  SHP, src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase; Mtor, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; BAD, Bcl2 associated agonist of cell death; 4E-BP1, initiation
  factor 4E binding protein 1; p70S6K, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. Only some of the pathways
  and transcription factors are represented in this layer. (c) Output layer is the
  end of the pathway which results in migration, growth, adhesion, or differentiation
  of the cell. Signaling pathways shown in the figure from left to right are Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, PLCγ- PKC-CAMK cascade, and PIL3-AKT-mTOR cascade. Adapted
