caption: Schematic diagram of TIFA regulating the inflammatory and osteoclast differentiation
  in the RAW264.7 cells. The upregulation of TIFA, which is induced by the treatment
  of HG and LPS or RANKL, promotes the cell inflammation and osteoclast differentiation
  in the RAW264.7 cells through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. TIFA,
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-interacting protein with forkhead-associated
  domain; HG, high glucose; LPS, lipopolysaccharide from Porphvromonas ginaivalis;
  RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; MCP-1, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein
  1; NLRP3, Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3; ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein; NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1; HG,
  high glucose
