caption: The main mechanism of F. nucleatum pathogenesis in CRC is illustrated. The
  adhesion and invasion of  FadA from F. nucleatum to epithelialand endothelial cells
  of human in pathway 1 can be observed while levels of  inflammatory cytokine (IL-6,
  IL-8,IL-10, IL-18, TNF-α, and NF- κB) grow in a proinflammatory microenvironment
  which in turn leads to colorectal tumor progression; FadA interaction with E-cadherin
  in pathway 2 in epithelial cells leads to  activating of  β-catenin signaling, increasing
  NF-κB inflammatory gene expression and enhancing tumor cell proliferation. F.nucleatum-infected
  cells, on the other hand, enhance miRNA expression by Toll-like receptor activation
  and therefore miRNA release development. F.nucleatum in pathways 3 and 4 reduces
  the activity of human T cells in a micro-suppressor of the tumor immune system.
  The interaction between Fap2 from F.nucleatum and the human inhibitor receptor TIGIT
  in pathway 5 leads to the death of lymphocyte cells of human, resulting in a microenvironment
  of immunosuppression that increases the progression of CRC
