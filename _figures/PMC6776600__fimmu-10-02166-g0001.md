caption: Overview on complement activation and cascade progression. Complement activation
  is mediated by the alternative pathway in the fluid phase and on surfaces, and by
  the lectin and the classical pathway on surfaces. Multiple regulators determine
  and adjust cascade progression and subsequence effector action. Thereby discriminating
  the action between intact self, altered self, and non-self. Three initial reactions
  activate the complement cascade and have different initial triggers. The alternative
  pathway (AP) which is initiated spontaneously and continuously in the fluid phase
  and in the absence of regulators is amplified on surfaces. Both the lectin (LP)
  and the classical pathway (CP) are initiated on surfaces. The type of surface influences
  activation and the regulator repertoire decides on cascade progression or inhibition.
  Different regulators control cascade progression in the fluid phase and on surfaces.
  The three pathways form surface bound convertases, the AP allows generation of the
  AP-C3 convertase and the LP/CP trigger CP convertase. The AP C3 convertase also
  triggers a potent amplification loop. The general role of both C3 convertase is
  to cleave the abundant plasma protein C3 (concentration 1,000–1,500 μg/ml) into
  the anaphylatoxin C3a and the opsonic C3b. The enzymatic response on the first enzymatic
  levels is frequently enhanced by the potent self-amplifying amplification loop.
  If activation C5 convertases are generated and again C5 convertases of the AP and
  of the LP/CP pathways do exist. The major role of the C5 convertase is to cleave
  C5 (plasma concentration 350 μg/ml) into the powerful anaphylatoxin C5a and to generate
  C5b. Surface bound C5b initiates terminal complement and formation of the terminal
  complex, C5b-9, also termed membrane attack complex which can form lytic pores.
  Thus, complement acts on two major enzymatic levels, each of which generates a unique
  set of effector components with rather diverse functions. The complexity of this
  cascade is mediated by regulators and inhibitors, which control activation in the
  fluid phase (AP) and which ensure that activation mainly occurs on non-self surfaces
  or modified surfaces. In the physiological setting this coordinated action allows
  to direct the toxic and clearance power to the foreign/modified particles. In case
  of any dysbalance this action can be targeted toward self-structures and this can
  cause pathology at specific sites.
