caption: General features of the HER family. EGFR, HER3, HER4 have intact ligand binding
  sites. HER2 fails to bind any known ErbB ligands and HER3 has impaired catalytic
  activity. Two main strategies to target HER receptors for cancer treatment include
  monoclonal antibody (mAb) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approaches. The HER2-HER3
  heterodimer is considered the most potent HER pair as an oncogenic unit and is illustrated
  as a representative dimer. Two key signaling pathways activated by the HER family
  dimers are the MAPK pathway and the PI3 K/Akt pathway. Activation of HER3 leads
  to transcription of genes that drive cell proliferation, migration, differentiation
  and angiogenesis [, ].
