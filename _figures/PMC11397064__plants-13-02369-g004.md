caption: Changes of DEGs and DAMs in metabolic pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  of Chinese olive under sunburn stress. The pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  referring to the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00940)
  (accessed on 28 August 2023) [20]. Orange and blue colors indicate high and low
  expression levels of DEGs, while red and green colors represent the up- and down-accumulation
  of DAMs, respectively. No color indicates no significant change. Squares, circles,
  and triangles represent the comparisons of CK vs. MSI, CK vs. SSI, and MSI vs. SSI,
  respectively
