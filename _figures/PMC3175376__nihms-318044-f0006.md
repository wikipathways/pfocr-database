caption: Normally, mismatch repair (MMR) machinery removes small loops in DNA (red)
  during replication without mutation (top panels, ‘no mutation’). However, failure
  to remove the loops (‘inhibition of repair’) can result in expansion. In dividing
  cells, the uncorrected loop (shown here as a hairpin with an A mismatch (red circle))
  is copied into DNA during the next round of replication. Therefore the trinucleotide
  repeat (TNR) sequence increases by the size of the DNA (red ‘ladder’). In non-dividing
  cells, loop incorporation is not coordinated with the replication fork. The mechanism
  of de novo loop removal is unknown. However, two models for loop incorporation have
  been proposed, both of which involve a single-strand break (nicking) on the strand
  opposite the hairpin (grey arrow). In the canonical MMR model (centre panels), the
  hairpin recruits catalytically active MutS homologue 2 (MSH2)–MSH3. The MMR machinery
  then introduces a nick on the opposite strand from the hairpin and a polymerase
  (purple oval) incorporates the loop after gap-filling synthesis. In an alternative
  model (right panels) MSH2–MSH3 binds to the mispaired bases in the stem of the hairpin.
  The interaction with the hairpin alters the function of MSH2–MSH3 such that it does
  not successfully carry out canonical MMR. Instead, it acts as adaptor to recruit
  non-MMR machinery to complete loop incorporation through a crosstalk pathway.
