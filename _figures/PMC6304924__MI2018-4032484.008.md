caption: Mechanism of the L-THP action. In ConA-induced autoimmune hepatitis, L-THP
  reduces autophagy by inhibiting the JNK/p-JNK pathway. After ConA injection, TNF-α
  combined with TNFR and TRAF6, which was expressed on the surface of hepatocytes.
  This led to the activation of JNK, which phosphorylated Bcl-2, then promoting the
  release of caspase 9 and caspase 3, causing apoptosis. Inactive Bcl-2 dissociated
  from Beclin-1, enhancing the induction of autophagy. Taking these all together,
  L-THP successfully inhibited the release of TNF-α and ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis
  and autophagy by reducing the phosphorylation of JNK.
