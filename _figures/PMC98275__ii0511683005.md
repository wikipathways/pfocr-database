caption: Possible mechanism for the H. pylori-induced apoptotic signaling pathway.
  The apoptosis-triggering protein(s) attaches to the host cell surface and then stimulates
  the death receptors through unknown systems. Stimulation of the death receptors
  induces apoptosis through sequential induction of caspase-8 activity, proapoptotic
  proteins Bad and Bid, caspase-9 activity, and caspase-3 activity. Under the serum-supplemented
  condition, expression of antiapoptotic factors of H. pylori would presumably increase,
  leading to activation of antiapoptotic pathways of the host cell. Antiapoptotic
  substances, such as growth factors, would also be responsible for inhibition of
  H. pylori-mediated apoptosis.
