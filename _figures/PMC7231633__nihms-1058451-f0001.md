caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and O-GlcNAcylation. A percentage of
  the glucose taken into a cell is converted to the donor sugar UDP-GlcNAc by the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), where it can be used for the O-GlcNAc modification
  of intracellular proteins. This type of glycosylation is particularly sensitive
  to changes in UDP-GlcNAc concentration.
