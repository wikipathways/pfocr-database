caption: Mammalian infection is initiated when metacyclic (‘Meta’) forms are inoculated
  by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. These develop to proliferative bloodstream
  slender (SL) forms that multiply in the blood to establish the infection. As numbers
  increase, a parasite-derived factor, stumpy induction factor (SIF), promotes division
  arrest and the generation of stumpy (ST) forms, commitment to this transition occurring
  while the parasite is still morphologically slender (this intermediate form has
  been termed Stumpy*; []). The experimental induction of cells with stumpy characteristics
  can also be induced by various chemical treatments (8-pCPTcAMP, hydrolysable cAMP
  and troglitazone) although whether these act via the SIF signalling pathway is unclear.
  Once stumpy cells are up taken by tsetse flies they transform to procyclic (PC)
  forms, this being induced in vitro by exposure to citrate/cis-aconitate (CCA), mild
  acid or pronase treatment. Procyclic forms develop initially as early forms (which
  express GPEET procyclin), this being down regulated as they transform to late procyclic
  forms. Asymmetric division of proventricular (PV) forms generates a long and short
  form, the short form of which is believed to attach to the salivary gland and transform
  to proliferative epimastigote (‘Epi’) forms, which express BARP and are believed
  to be capable of sexual exchange. These eventually mature to detached metacyclic
  forms that express a VSG coat and are ready for transmission to a new mammalian
  host. Mitochondrial status is indicated inside the circle in boxes, surface antigen
  expression is indicated outside the circle.
