caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanisms by which exosomal miR-486-5p
  derived from M2 macrophages regulates the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation
  of BMMSCs. miR-486-5p enrichment in M2D-Exos enhances the inhibitory effect on SMAD2,
  resulting in downregulation of the TGF-β signalling pathway and thereby accelerating
  bone remodelling.
