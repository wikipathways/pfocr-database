caption: 'Refinement of phenol meta-degradation pathway in S. solfataricus P2. For
  simplicity, additional Co-substrates and Co-factors were not shown. Proteins predicted
  to be involved in phenol degradation were indicated by the corresponding gene loci.
  Relative metabolite concentrations (squares) were expressed as fold-changes compared
  to the reference D-glucose. Transcript abundance (solid circles) and flux distributions
  (dashed circles) were expressed as Log2 fold-changes compared to the reference D-glucose.
  Hash: Data are only available under phenol conditions. 2-OH-muconate-semialdehyde,
  2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde; 2-OH-muconate, 2-hydroxymuconate; 4-OH-2-oxo-pentanoate,
  4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoate. This pathway is available at MetaboMAPS (accession:
  P100).'
