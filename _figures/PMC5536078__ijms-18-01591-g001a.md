caption: Epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of p16INK4a. (A) Epigenetic regulation
  of p16INK4a—The genomic INK/ARF locus is depicted as a bold line, with exons indicated
  by colored vertical lines (not drawn to scale). The coding regions of INK4b (CDKN2B)
  are shown in red, those of ARF in orange and those of INK4a (CDKN2A) in blue. Epigenetic
  repressors (red) and activators (green) have the opposite function in INK/ARF locus
  regulation; (B) Transcriptional activators and repressors of p16INK4a—The p16INK4a
  promoter is depicted as bold line with binding sites indicated by white rectangles
  (not drawn to scale). Expression of p16INK4a requires the action of transcription
  factors (green) that recruit and/or facilitate RNA polymerase association with the
  promoter. Transcriptional repressors (red) have an opposite function.
