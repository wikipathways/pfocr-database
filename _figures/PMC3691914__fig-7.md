caption: Energy metabolism can gear the cell-death pathway of cancer cells. Cancer
  cells have different susceptibility to death stimulus as a result of their metabolic
  phenotype. A first event to death after priming the cells is the rapid dismantling
  and fragmentation of the mitochondrial tubular network into small mitochondria (blue).
  Tumor cells with relevant oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (i.e., high bioenergetic
  signature) (a) will respond with a burst in ROS production contributing to the oxidation
  of mitochondrial proteins (red dots) and their release from mitochondria to effectively
  swamp the cells into apoptosis (fragmented nucleus in blue). In contrast, cancer
  cells that have a high glycolytic metabolism (i.e., low bioenergetic signature)
  (b) will not respond with ROS production to a conventional chemotherapeutic agent,
  resulting in resistance to cell death. In this situation, it is suggested that metabolic
  inhibitors interfering with glycolysis (b1) (bromopyruvate, BrPy; iodoacetate, IA)
  to produce a metabolic catastrophe by depletion of cellular ATP levels can promote
  cell death by necrosis. Alternatively, treatment of highly glycolytic tumors with
  compounds that could activate the metabolism of pyruvate in mitochondria or the
  overall oxidative phosphorylation (b2) (dichloroacetate, DCA) could revert the metabolic
  phenotype of the cancer cell to produce ROS and the execution of apoptotic cell
  death. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version
