caption: The anti-apoptotic and pro-survival effects of elamipretide. In neurodegeneration,
  both of intrinsic caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and extrinsic caspase-dependent
  apoptotic pathway are overactive, as evidenced by the increased of apoptotic factors
  such as extrinsic death ligand, extrinsic receptor, Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3.
  In addition, survival signaling such as Bcl-2, BDNF, TrkB, PI3K, and AKT are reduced.
  The reviewed studies showed that Elamipretide could reduce the levels of intrinsic
  caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic factors (i.e., Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3) as
  well as enhanced pro-survival factors (i.e., Bcl-2, BDNF, and TrkB), suggesting
  that Elamipretide might reduce neural apoptosis and enhance neural survival against
  neurodegeneration. However, the effects of elamipretide on neural extrinsic caspase-dependent
  apoptotic pathway as well as on the levels of PI3K, AKT have maintained unclear.
