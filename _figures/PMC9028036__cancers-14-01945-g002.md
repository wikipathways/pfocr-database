caption: The intestinal stem cells are at the bottom of the crypt. These cells give
  rise to transit amplifying cells. During their differentiation, these cells migrate
  along the crypt, reaching the surface. Intestine stem cells regulation, as well
  as the proliferation and differentiation processes, are mediated by signals which
  come from the surrounding mesenchymal cells. At the bottom of the crypt, are expressed
  genes (Wnt, R-spondin, EGF) that regulate the cell cycle, and the intestine stem
  cells and progenitors increase, despite the genes inducing apoptosis being downregulated.
  The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways are expressed on the top of the crypt.
  In the meantime, BMP antagonists (noggin, gremlin, and chordin-like 1) are expressed,
  at the bottom of the crypt, by stromal cells. R-spondin is a protein that promotes
  the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway signaling. Adapted from Audrey [,,]. ECM—extracellular
  matrix; EGF—Epidermal growth factor; Wnt—Wingless and Int-1.
