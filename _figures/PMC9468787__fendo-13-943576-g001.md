caption: Lipid Control Over the O-GlcNAc Regulatory System. Protein O-GlcNAcylation
  (blue) is regulated by the activity or localization of the glycoslylation enzymes,
  O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) through direct binding to lipid
  species (e.g. PIP3) or downstream of lipid sensitive proteins and miRNAs. The substrate
  for OGT is UDP-GlcNAc, which is synthesized through an offshoot of glycolysis (green)
  called the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP, purple). Lipid regulation of the
  HBP seems particularly focused on expression of the rate limiting enzyme GFAT and
  control over the metabolic fate of fructose-6-phosphate (P), which represents the
  divergence point between glycolysis and the HBP. Proteins (or microRNA) with an
  altered expression profile in obesity are indicated by asterisk (see main text for
  details). Orange dashed lines indicate agonistic (➔) or inhibitory (–|) relationships
  between lipid metabolites (e.g. Acyl-CoA) or lipid regulated species (e.g. Fatty
  Acid Synthase, FAS). It is important to note that UDP-GlcNAc has multiple utilizations
  in the cell, which might also be influenced by the regulatory relationship indicated.
  Post-translational modifications are not included for the sake of visual clarity.
