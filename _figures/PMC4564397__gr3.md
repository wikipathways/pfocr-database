caption: 'Mechanistic details of the action of membrane-associated catalase of tumor
  cells (A) Tight control of NO/peroxynitrite and HOCl signaling through membrane-associated
  catalase of tumor cells. Membrane-associated NOX1 generates extracellular superoxide
  anions (#1) that form H2O2 after dismutation (#2). H2O2 is decomposed by membrane-associated
  catalase in a two step reaction, involving compound I (CATFeIV=O·+) as intermediate
  (#3 and #4). Thus catalase efficiently inhibits the HOCl signaling pathway as it
  prevents the generation of HOCl by peroxidase (#5) and subsequent HOCl/superoxide
  anion interaction and formation of apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals (#6). The
  activity of arginase (#7), the concentration of its substrate arginine, the activity
  of NO synthase (NOS) (#8) and the activity of NO dioxygenase (NOD) (#9) determine
  the concentration of free NO (#10). Compound I of catalase (CATFeIV=O·+) oxidates
  NO to  (#11) and thus counteracts NO-mediated inhibition of catalase (#12), as well
  as peroxynitrite formation through NO/superoxide anion interaction (#13). Residual
  peroxynitrite is decomposed by catalase in a two step reaction that involves the
  formation of compound I (#14 and # 15). Catalase-mediated oxidation of NO and decomposition
  of peroxynitrite prevent the formation of peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) (#16) and its
  subseqent decomposition into NO2 and apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals (#17).
  Thus catalase establishes a tight control of the NO/peroxynitrite signaling pathway.
  (B) Details of the interactions between NO and catalase. NOX-derived superoxide
  anions (#1) dismutate to H2O2 (#2) which reacts with native ferricatalase (CATFeIII),
  resulting in the formation of compound I (CATFeIV=O·+). Compound I is reduced to
  the inactive compound II (CATFeIV=O) by NO in a one electron transfer reaction (#4).
  The resultant nitrosonium ion (NO+) readily reacts with water (NO++H2O→2H+) (#5).
  Compound II reacts with a second molecule of NO (#6), which leads to the formation
  of  and to the restoration of native ferricatalase. Taken together, the oxidation
  of NO by catalase follows the equation H2O2+2·NO→2H++2. The reaction between NO
  and superoxide anions results in the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (#7), which
  reacts with ferricatalase and leads to the formation of compound I (#8). If the
  concentration of NO is sufficiently high, catalase can be reversibly inhibited by
  NO through formation of an inactive CATFeIIINO complex (#9). Superoxide anions reactivate
  NO-inhibited catalase (#10), but also can cause inhibition of the enzyme (#11) either
  through reduction of compound I to the inactive compound II or through formation
  of inactive compound III (CATFeIIIO2·−).'
