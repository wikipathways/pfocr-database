caption: 'Multiple strategies are currently being employed and explored to inhibit
  the pathological activation of this pathway. Red X indicates a strategy discussed
  in the review as a potential or actively used approach for treating patients with
  disease caused as a result of VHL loss or aberrant HIF activation. These include:
  inhibition of mTOR, preventing protein synthesis of HIF, inhibition of HSP90, an
  important chaperone involved in HIF stability during cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling,
  inhibition of cell growth in cells lacking VHL, inhibition of HIF interaction with
  transcriptional cofactors p300 and CBP, direct inhibition of targets of HIF activation,
  and inhibition of signaling receptors activated downstream of HIF transcriptional
  activation.'
