caption: 'The reactome pathway diagram, demonstrating the primary signaling and functional
  molecular pathways of the complement system on a target cell. In this diagram, multiple
  activation pathways are shown, eventually effecting cell lysis and breakdown of
  the target cell. This also shows secondary signaling pathways for C3a signaling
  for pro-inflammation and cytokine activity with C5a-promoting chemotaxic recruitment
  of inflammatory cells. Retrieved from: http://www.reactome.org/figures/Pathway_Illustrations/Complement_Cascade_72_oicr.png;
