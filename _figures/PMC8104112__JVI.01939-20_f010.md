caption: Model for how m6A methylation invades host innate immunity in NNS RNA viruses.
  The newly synthesized genome and antigenome of NNS RNA viruses are first methylated
  by m6A writer proteins, which are encapsidated by N protein to serve as a template
  for replication and transcription. Some of the genome and antigenome may not be
  encapsidated at an early stage in the virus replication cycle, particularly when
  the concentration of N protein is low. These unmodified antigenomes or genomes would
  be recognized by RIG-I to induce the IFN signaling pathway. m6A methylation in genome
  and antigenome prevents RIG-I binding, conformational change, oligomerization, and
  K63-linked polyubiquitination, which result in lower activation of MAVS and subsequent
  phosphorylation of IRF3, thereby inhibiting type I IFN production. In addition,
  YTHDF2 binds to the m6A-methylated genome and antigenome, which suppresses type
  I IFN signaling.
