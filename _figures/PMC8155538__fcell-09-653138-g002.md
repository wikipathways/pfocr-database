caption: Ciliary GPCR signaling. (A) The vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R) is located
  in the ciliary membrane. When activated, signal transduction via Gs alpha subunit
  (Gαs) leads to increased production of cAMP by adenylate cyclase (AC) and subsequent
  activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates aquaporin 2 (AQP2), which
  translocates to the apical cell membrane leading to increased water reabsorption.
  In addition, PKA phosphorylates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR), leading to transport of Cl– ions and fluid secretion into the lumen, and
  CREB and STAT3, enhancing transcription. Other downstream effects include increased
  CDK signaling. Opening of the polycystin-1/polycystin-2 (PC1/PC2) complex in response
  to urine flow inhibits the cAMP/PKA pathway via inhibition of AC5/6 and through
  PDE4C. (B) Other main ciliary GPCRs are Smo and the constitutively active Shh receptor
  GPR161. In the absence of Shh, Ptch1 excludes and inhibits Smo, leading to repression
  of Gli transcription factors by SuFu, and GPR161 signaling leads to increased cAMP-dependent
  activation of PKA. Elevated PKA further represses Gli transcription factors. Binding
  of a Hh ligand leads to entry of Smo and consequent removal of GPR161 from the ciliary
  membrane, resulting in decreased cAMP/PKA activity and activation of Gli transcription
  factors.
