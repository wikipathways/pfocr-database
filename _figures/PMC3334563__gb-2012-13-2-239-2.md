caption: The malic enzyme metabolic switch. Malic enzyme mediates the conversion of
  malate to pyruvate, which is accompanied by the production of NADPH. NADPH is a
  necessary cofactor for the biosynthesis of fatty acids along with acetyl-CoA, generated
  by the metabolism of ethanol. The diagram highlights auxiliary pathways for the
  biosynthesis of fatty acids. Pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme mediate a cyclic
  metabolic pathway, which via the mitochondrial citrate and pyruvate transporters
  results in the transport of acetyl-CoA across the mitochondrial membrane and generation
  of cytosolic NADPH. An alternative metabolic pathway is the direct conversion of
  pyruvate into acetyl-CoA via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This metabolic
  switch channels excess metabolic energy into the synthesis of fatty acids and contributes
  to the development of fatty liver syndrome during excessive alcohol consumption.
