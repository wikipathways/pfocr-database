caption: Working model for onset of emphysema in Fut8+/− mice upon exposure to CS.
  It was reported previously () that Fut8−/− mice show emphysematous changes in the
  lung due to a lack of core fucosylation of the TGF-β1 receptor. In this study, Fut8
  expression was down-regulated by exposure to CS, resulting a much lower level of
  core fucosylation. This change in N-glycosylation led to more severe impairment
  of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Moreover, CS evoked an up-regulation of Smad7,
  a key inhibitory factor associated with Smad2 phosphorylation. Comprehensively,
  a lower degree of core fucosylation appears to increase the susceptibility to CS-induced
  emphysemas. TβRI and TβRII, TGF-β receptors I and II, respectively; TF, transcription
  factor; ECM, extracellular matrix.
