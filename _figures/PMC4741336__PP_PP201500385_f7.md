caption: Simplified conceptual model for the central metabolism of oilseed rape and
  the regulation of carbon partitioning. The network shown represents the most relevant
  pathways and includes all measured metabolites with strong correlation to flux into
  fatty acid synthesis or starch (P < 2%). Nonmeasured metabolites are added to complete
  pathways and are shown in gray. All color-coded fluxes, enzymes, and metabolites
  have opposite signs in correlation coefficients for lipid and starch, respectively.
  Red color indicates positive correlation to lipid and negative correlation to starch,
  being at least in one case highly significant (P < 2%). ACC, Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase;
  FAS, fatty acid synthesis; G6PDH, Glc-6-P dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; HK-Glc, hexokinase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PGM,
  phosphoglycerate mutase; PPDK, pyrophosphate:pyruvate dikinase; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway.
