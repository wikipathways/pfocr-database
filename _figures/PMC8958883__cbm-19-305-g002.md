caption: Pleiotropic roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumor immunity in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). Wnt signaling regulates many features of components in the tumor
  microenvironment. Activation of Wnt signaling in HCC cells can induce endothelial
  cell proliferation and capillary-like network formation through regulation of angiogenic
  factors. Due to decreased levels of chemokines, CCL4 and IL-10, recruitment of dendritic
  cells is defective. Endogenous β-catenin activation of tumor cells can also result
  in resistance to effector/memory T cells and regulation of liver NKT cell activation.
  The hepatic tumor cells stimulate M2 macrophage polarization by activation of the
  canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In turn, Wnt ligands secreted from macrophage
  can activate the Wnt signaling pathway in tumor cells to promote malignancy, and
  in hepatic progenitor cells to promote specification to hepatocytes. It can also
  drive protumoral activation and cancer stem cell self-renewal.
