caption: (A) A simplified model for a partially conserved nutrient signaling PKA pathway
  in yeast and mammalian cells. Arrows show promotion actions and horizontal bars
  indicate inhibitory actions. GH, growth hormone; AC, adenylate cyclase; PKA, protein
  kinase A; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; Foxo1, Forkhead box protein
  O1; G9a, H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase.(B) A simplified model for PF-induced effects
  on WBC and HSCs. Fasting causes a major reduction in WBCs followed by their replenishment
  after re-feeding, based on effects on HSCs self-renewal resulting in increased progenitor
  and immune cells. These effects of PF can result in reversal of chemotherapy-based
  immunosuppression but also in the rejuvenation of the immune cell profile in old
  mice.
