caption: Regulation of external and internal potassium balance. So-called feed-forward
  control refers to a potassium control pathway that responds to a pre-determined
  signal from the organism and is highly relevant to the mechanism of additional potassium
  regulation. The brain generates a regulatory circuit with the kidney and the colon
  that anticipates the presentation of food. Gastrointestinal-renal signals with a
  kaliuretic effect are generated, which will be able to mediate renal potassium elimination
  independent of changes in serum potassium and aldosterone concentration. Several
  co-transporters and ion channels are involved in the complex regulatory system of
  potassium reabsorption. The distal convoluted tubule mediates reabsorption of 5–10%
  of filtered potassium. Increased plasma K+ concentration depolarizes cells in the
  proximal portion of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT1) through effects dependent
  on the potassium. Increased Na+ delivery and flow to the downstream distal portion
  of the DCT where aldosterone sensitivity begins (DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting
  duct) along with increased aldosterone levels drive potassium secretion.
