caption: '(A) Uricase expression pattern and related metabolic profiling of uric acid
  degradation pathway. (B) GSH synthesis and the alternative OA pathway: levels of
  GSH, pathway intermediates, and related enzymes. (C) KYN pathway and expression
  patterns of related enzymes. Boxes on the right show the localization of putative
  HKT genes in anhydrobiosis-related gene island 5 (ARId 5), where the green and red
  data points indicate RNA-seq coverage at the D0 and D48 time points, respectively.
  Metabolome data are shown as described for . Asterisks indicate significance level
  (*<0.05, **<0.01, ***<0.001). Enzyme expression patterns were obtained by transcriptome
  analysis at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h desiccation (D0, D24, and D48) and 3 h and 24 h after
  rehydration (R3 and R24).'
