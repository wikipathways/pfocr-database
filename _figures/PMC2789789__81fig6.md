caption: Scheme of the biosynthesis pathways for PC, PE, and PS in human P. falciparum-
  and rodent P. vinckei- and P. berghei-infected erythrocytes. Cho entry into the
  infected erythrocyte implies the erythrocytic choline carrier and the New Permeation
  Pathway (NPP) (–). Cho is provided to the parasite by a characterized Organic-Cation
  Transporter (OCT) () encoded by unknown genes. Etn enters RBC mainly by passive
  diffusion. Ser is diverted from the host RBC and transported into the parasite,
  or from hemoglobin degradation in the food vacuole. Pathway steps shared by P. falciparum
  and rodent malaria species are indicated by solid arrows (see text for details).
  PMT and PEMT (unknown genes) activities were only detected in P. falciparum; SD
  activity was only detected in P. falciparum and weakly in P. berghei; and LysoPC
  was recovered only into rodent Plasmodium IRBC (see text for details). These steps
  are marked with dotted arrows. The SDPM pathway is differentiated by gray arrows
  (dotted). Lipids are shaded in gray. Enzymes are in gray italics. DAG, diacylglycerol;
  CDP-DAG, cytidine-diphospho-diacylglycerol; PMME, phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine;
  CK, choline kinase; CCT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; EK, ethanolamine
  kinase; ECT, CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase; CEPT, choline/ethanolamine-phosphotransferase;
  PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine
  N-methyltransferase; PLMT, phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase;
  SD, serine decarboxylase; PMT, phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase.
