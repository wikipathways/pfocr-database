caption: The figure shows selected subnetworks of the differential network for Liver
  tissue in Diabetes. In detail, starting from the differential network, we highlighted
  the genes involved in the pathways resulted from enriched analysis in different
  colours, whereas the genes not involved in pathways are identified in grey. In particular,
  the genes involved in Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction are coloured in purple,
  the genes involved in Inflammatory bowel disease are coloured in green, the genes
  involved in Viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor are coloured
  in pink and the genes involved in Chemokine signaling pathway are coloured in blue
