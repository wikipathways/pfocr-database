caption: Four Notch receptors (Notch1–4) and 5 Notch ligands of the Jagged (Jagged1–2)
  and Delta-like (Dll1,3,4) families have been identified in mammals. Notch receptors
  are modified by Fringe glycosyltransferase, which modulates their interaction with
  Notch ligands. Receptor-ligand binding leads to extracellular cleavage of the receptor
  by the ADAM10 metalloprotease, followed by the intramembrane proteolysis via γ-secretase.
  Cleaved intracellular Notch (ICN) translocates into the nucleus. ICN associates
  with CSL (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1; also known as RBPJ), a Mastermind-like
  (MAML) family coactivator, and other transcriptional co-activators (CoA) to displace
  co-repressors (CoR) and build a large multiprotein complex that activates target
  gene transcription.
