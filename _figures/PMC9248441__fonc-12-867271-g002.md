caption: 'Potential effects and mechanisms of an exogenous siderophore treatment in
  cancer cells. (A) Under normal conditions, cancer cells increase their iron uptake,
  which increases the iron labile pool (Fe2+) and ROS generation, and has been related
  to increased invasion, proliferation and tumor growth. (B) During exogenous siderophore
  treatment, siderophores bind ferric iron (Fe3+) and decrease the levels of free
  iron available for bacteria, LCN2 and cancer cells. As a result, cancer cells display
  reduced proliferation and tumor growth, and induction of apoptosis. Proposed mechanisms
  include: reduction of ferric iron (Fe3+) availability, the intracellular iron pool
  (Fe2+), ROS generation and expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, increasing
  expression of p53 and the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Fas, activating the pro-apoptotic
  pathway through DDIT3, and inhibiting HDAC.'
