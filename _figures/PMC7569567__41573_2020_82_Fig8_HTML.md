caption: NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) itself is regulated at the basal level by a destruction
  complex, and signal-induced non-canonical NF-κB signalling involves NIK stabilization.
  The canonical NF-κB pathway involves activation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IKK) complex
  by TGFβ-activated kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TAK1), IKK-mediated NF-κB inhibitor-α
  (IκBα) phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, resulting in rapid and transient
  nuclear translocation of the NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p50. NIK protein levels remain
  low via active degradation using ubiquitin ligase complex, comprising tumour necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TRAF2 and inhibitor of apoptosis 1
  and 2 (IAP1/2). Receptor activation by agonists recruits this complex to the receptor
  where activated IAP mediates K48 ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of TRAF3,
  resulting in stabilization and accumulation of NIK. Subsequently, NIK activates
  IKKα to trigger p100 phosphorylation and processing to enforce persistent activation
  of RelB/p52 complex to activate gene transcription. BAFF, B cell-activating factor;
  BCR, B cell receptor; LTβ, lymphotoxin-β; P, phosphorus; TCR, T cell receptor; TLR,
  Toll-like receptor; TWEAK, tumour necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis;
  Ub, ubiquitin.
