caption: Schematic representation of the interactions between the Gq and Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathways. As shown in the model, APC promotes β-catenin nuclear export
  and facilitates proteasome-mediated degradation of β-catenin after sequential phosphorylation
  by CKIα and GSK-3β on the Axin-based complex. Wnt binding to coreceptors LRP and
  Frizzled blocks proteasome-mediated degradation, which further leads to nuclear
  localization of β-catenin, gene expression, and cell proliferation. As an alternative
  degradation pathway, Ca2+ activation by Gq signaling pathway promotes nuclear export
  of β-catenin into cytoplasm, where it is further degraded by calpain in a Ca2+-dependent
  manner. Consequently, β-catenin–TCF/LEF-dependent cell proliferation is inhibited.
  LRP, low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome
  system; PLCβ, phospholipase C β; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3R,
  IP3 receptor.
