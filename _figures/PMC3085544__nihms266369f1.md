caption: 'Intracellular signaling by the leptin (LepRb - cyan) and insulin receptor
  (magenta). Leptin binding to its receptor exhibits simple kinetic properties suggesting
  that one molecule of leptin binds to the leptin receptor (left side). Leptin binding
  to the extracellular domain of LepRb dimer induces JAK2 tyrosine kinases, which
  are noncovalently associated proximally with the receptor, to autophosphorylate
  (; ; ). Activated Jak2 subsequently phosphorylates a number of substrates including
  the tyrosine residues (Y985, 1077, and Y1138) on the intracellular domain of the
  leptin receptor. STAT3 is recruited via its SH2 (src homology) domain to the distal
  tyrosine residue (Y1138) and is then phosphorylated by JAK2 (; ; ). STAT3 subsequently
  dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to modify the transcription of several
  genes including SOCS3 (; ). SOCS3 is a negative regulator of cytokine signaling
  and acts as a negative regulator of leptin in a feedback loop (). SOCS3 inhibits
  phosphorylation of the proximal tyrosine residue (Y985) on the leptin receptor and
  to a lesser degree on tyrosine residue (Y1077) (; ). SOCS3 can also inhibit JAK2
  and STAT3 directly (; ; ). In addition to providing a binding site for SOCS3, the
  proximal tyrosine residue (Y985) also binds SHP2 upstream of the ERK/MAPK pathway
  (; ; ; ). PTP-1B is largely associated with the surface of the ER and negatively
  regulates leptin signaling by dephosphorylating JAK2 (). JAK2 activates the IRS-PI3K
  pathway which has been shown to alter gene transcription and modify cellular activity
  via activation of conductances such as the Katp and TRPC channels (; ; ; ; ). Leptin
  also activates the mammalian target of rapamycin-ribosomal S6 kinase (mtor-S6K)
  pathway which are kinases known to regulate transcription and protein synthesis
  (; ; ). In contrast to leptin, insulin binding to its receptor exhibits complex
  kinetic properties suggesting that one molecule of insulin may bind and activate
  the insulin receptor, however another molecule of insulin may bind to a lower affinity
  binding site on the receptor as well (right side). Insulin binding to the extracellular
  alpha subunits of the insulin receptor induces autophosporylation of the intracellular
  beta subunits and is critical for insulin action in vivo (; ). The insulin receptor
  has 8 tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated (). These sites exist in 3 clusters:
  juxtamembrane (Y960,Y950/972), tri-tyrosine (1146, 1150, 1151), and c-terminus (1316,
  1322). The insulin receptor subsequently recruits and activates IRS proteins which
  in turn activate many of the same signaling cascades activated by leptin (cyan/magenta)
  including PI3K-AKT (; ). The negative regulators of leptin receptor activity, SOCS3
  and PTP1B, also feedback directly on the insulin receptor and inhibit signaling
  - both can also inhibit IRS1 directly (; ; ; ; ; ). S6K also inhibits insulin signaling
  by phosphorylating IRS1 at multiple serine residues (; ; ; ).'
