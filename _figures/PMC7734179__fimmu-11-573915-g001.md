caption: 'Cytosolic DNA sensing pathways. cGAS can sense various stress signals of
  cytosolic DNA and trigger a STING-dependent response. Upon activation, STING mainly
  recruits and activates three kinases: TBK1, IKK, and NIK. Besides, the cGAS-STING
  pathway can directly or indirectly activate IRF1, IRF5, IRF7, mTOR, STAT6, and MAPKs.
  TLR9 and AIM2 also recognize cytosolic DNA. The ligated TLR9 interacts with MyD88
  to activate TRAF6 and MAPKs, whereas activated AIM2 associates with ASC and GSDMD
  to form an inflammasome complex.'
