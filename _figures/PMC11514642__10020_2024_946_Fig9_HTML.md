caption: Abnormal expression of MECOM in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and
  its mechanistic involvement in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway and affecting
  cell cycle and apoptosis. In endometrial cancer, decreased methylation levels of
  MECOM lead to increased expression. MECOM regulates cell cycle and apoptosis in
  endometrial cancer by affecting the phosphorylation levels of crucial TGF-beta signaling
  proteins, Smad. Additionally, changes in MECOM expression influence cell migration,
  which may subsequently affect tumor invasion and metastasis
