caption: Graphic abstract. Working model of biphasic effect of modulating RA signaling
  on the enrichment differentiation of atrial-like and sinoatrial node-like cells
  based on the GiWi method. During the cardiac mesoderm stage of pan cardio-myocytes
  differentiation from hiPSCS, activation of RA signaling pathway promotes biased
  differentiation of atrial-like cells. In contrast, enrichment differentiation of
  sinoatrial node-like cells could be enabled by RA inhibition.
