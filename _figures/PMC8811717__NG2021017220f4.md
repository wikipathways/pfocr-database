caption: The ISR is activated by 4 kinases (PKR, HRI, GCN2, and PERK), each a sensor
  for a particular stress type. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response
  (UPR), which has 3 arms, mediated by PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. The PERK pathway is shared
  by the ISR and UPR. Activated kinases phosphorylate eIF2α, which binds and inhibits
  eIF2B. Pathogenic variants in EIF2B1-EIF2B5 also decrease eIF2B activity. Decreased
  eIF2B activity lowers overall mRNA translation and activates the activating transcription
  factor 4 transcription response, which has major effects on cell fates as cell death,
  recovery, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. GADD34 dephosphorylates
  eIF2α, thereby restoring eIF2B activity. C/EBP homologous protein sensitizes the
  ER for stress. eIF2B activators stabilize and activate eIF2B directly. Glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β inhibitors decrease eIF2B phosphorylation, thereby increasing
  its activity. Guanabenz inhibits GADD34, thereby modulating eIF2α phosphorylation
  and thus eIF2B activity. ER chaperones decrease ER stress. Modified from box 1,
  links.lww.com/NXG/A512, Scheper et al., Nat Rev 2007, with permission. eIF2B = eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2B; ER = endoplasmic reticulum; GADD34 = growth arrest and DNA
  damage protein 34; ISR = integrated stress response; UPR = unfolded protein response.
