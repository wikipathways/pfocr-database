caption: A schematic diagram of CBT-ol/CBT-diol synthesis in tobacco. Tobacco GGPP
  could be formed via MEP or MVA pathway. The MEP pathway derived GGPP was shown to
  be the precursor of CBT-ol/CBT-diol, but it is unknown whether GGPP from the MVA
  pathway could act as their precursor. Formation of CBT-ol from GGPP is catalyzed
  by CBTS1, and further synthesis of CBT-diol is catalyzed by CYP450. Both CBT-ol
  and CBT-diol have two structural isomers
