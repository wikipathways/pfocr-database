caption: Summary of data and model of differential control of the β-catenins WRM-1
  and SYS-1 by MIG-5 and DSH-2. (A) Summary of DSH-2 and MIG-5 control of β-catenin
  localization during asymmetric seam cell division. Together, DSH-2 and MIG-5 positively
  regulate SYS-1 levels and negatively regulate WRM-1 levels, while controlling polarity
  of asymmetry of both β-catenins. The SYS-1-regulatory path is marked in red, and
  the WRM-1-regulatory path is marked in blue. In the case of WRM-1 regulation, DSH-2
  and MIG-5 appear to redundantly and negatively regulate WRM-1 levels, but polarity
  of WRM-1 asymmetry appears to be controlled by MIG-5. Conversely, DSH-2 and MIG-5
  are non-redundantly required to positively regulate SYS-1 levels, with MIG-5 again
  having a larger role in controlling polarity. (B) Model of Dvl function in WβA signaling
  pathway. DSH-2 and MIG-5 are likely controlling SYS-1 and WRM-1 nuclear levels by
  controlling the activity of APR-1 in the anterior daughter. MIG-5 controls polarity
  of APR-1, WRM-1 and SYS-1 localization by inhibiting posterior cortical localization
  of APR-1. PRY-1 localizes to the posterior cortex but its function there is unclear.
