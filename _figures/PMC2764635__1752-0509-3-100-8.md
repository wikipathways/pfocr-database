caption: 'Comparison of growth factor receptor signalling: This figure shows a comparison
  of ERK signalling from the EGF and Insulin receptors. At the top, a schematic of
  the EGF induced ERK pathway is shown in (A), with receptor degradation highlighted
  in red as it is the key process in generating a transient response, this is demonstrated
  in (B). All the lines in (B) represent simulated active ERK levels over 60 minutes.
  The blue line represents active ERK levels from the normal EGF model, the green
  line represents active ERK levels when the SOS negative feedback loop is knocked
  out, whereas the red line represents active ERK levels when receptor degradation
  is knocked out. At the bottom, a schematic of the Insulin induced ERK pathway is
  shown in (C), with the SOS feedback loop highlighted in red as it is the key process
  in generating a transient response, this is demonstrated in (D). All the lines in
  (D) represent simulated active ERK levels over 60 minutes. The blue line represents
  active ERK levels from the normal Insulin model, whilst the green line represents
  active ERK levels when the SOS negative feedback loop is knocked out. It should
  be noted that although not shown, both the EGF and Insulin receptor models do include
  the PI3K-Akt pathway.'
