caption: 'Proposed role of putative DREAM-like complexes in the nutrient-dependent
  life-cycle transitions of Chlamydomonas. Although the existence of DREAM-like (DP,
  RB, E2F and Myb-MuvB) complexes has not been confirmed for the algal lineage, the
  repression of genes related to the cell cycle and the cessation of growth and division
  with 1C (one copy) DNA content in the absence of N have been previously observed.
  Furthermore, some components of DREAM-like complexes are conserved in Chlamydomonas,
  including the RB pathway proteins (MAT3/RB, Cre06.g255450; E2F1, Cre01.g052300;
  DP1, Cre07.g323000), three CXC domain-containing proteins (CHT7, Cre11.g481800;
  CXC2, Cre08.g361400 and CXC3, Cre12.g550250; potential orthologs of mammalian LIN54,
  fly Mip120, worm lin-54, and Arabidopsis TCX5), and one Myb protein with three Myb-repeats
  (Myb3R, Cre12.g522400). The model of their hypothetical functions within the putative
  DREAM-like complexes in mediating the nutrient-dependent entry into and exit from
  quiescence (G0) is illustrated. The grey dotted lines are used to denote the hypothesized
  interactions. In line with the literature demonstrating their importance in the
  transcriptional regulation of cell cycle-dependent gene expression in other model
  organisms, the putative Chlamydomonas DREAM-like repressor complex is postulated
  to repress the genes associated with cell cycle progression during the post-mitotic
  or G1 phase prior to the passage of commitment point (CP) in response to N deprivation
  (N−), allowing the exit from active proliferation and entry into quiescence. Conversely,
  upon sensing the replenishment of N, the cells need to reinstate their capacity
  for energy capture and macromolecular synthesis. Once their metabolism is sufficiently
  restored to sustain further growth, the cell cycle-related genes are postulated
  to become activated by the dissociation of a DREAM-like repressor complex and or
  the formation of its activator counterpart, allowing the cells to fully exit from
  quiescence to reenter the cell division cycle. Although these complexes may also
  play a role in the progression of the cell division cycle itself, they are omitted
  from the model for the sake of simplicity. The plus and the minus signs next to
  the energy status represent energy sufficient and deficient states, respectively.
  Cell cycle-dependent steps are represented by black arrow heads, while the nutrient-dependent
  steps are represented by white arrow heads. N+: N-replete growth; N−: N deprivation;
  NR: N refeeding'
