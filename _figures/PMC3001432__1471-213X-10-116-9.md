caption: Model for osteoblast lineage development mediated by the Axin2/β-catenin/cyclin
  D1 regulatory pathway. Growing evidence suggests that Axin2/β-catenin regulates
  the self renewal of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the expansion of skeletogenic
  progenitors during calvarial morphogenesis [-]. This study shows that cyclin D1
  is a downstream modulator, acting in this regulatory axis. Furthermore, canonical
  Wnt signaling promotes specification of osteoprogenitors which are Runx2+ and Osx+,
  but prohibits terminal differentiation of mature osteoblasts expressing high levels
  of Op. Nonetheless, osteoblasts expressing low levels of Op are matrix-secreting
  cells capable of mediating bone synthesis.
