caption: 'Displayed are glucose and FA degradation pathways, including the urea cycle
  (highlighted blue) in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments. Also present
  in the scheme is the impact of different pathways, e.g. polyol, pentose phosphate,
  TCA cycle, β-oxidation, on the redox status (NADPH, ROS). Depicted in red and green
  are the pathway location and relative levels of metabolites in diabetic vs. WT hearts
  subjected to the GIP condition. In db/db hearts subjected to GI, Palm addition elicited
  metabolite accumulation (red: P < 0.05) or depletion (green: P < 0.05) with respect
  to WT. The quantitative assessment of metabolite levels (in mM) is shown in  and
  . GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; Trx, thioredoxin; Trx(SH)2,
  reduced thioredoxin.'
