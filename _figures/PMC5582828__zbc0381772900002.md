caption: Mechanisms by which fusion genes promote kinase activation and cell survival
  and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This figure shows two common gene
  rearrangements in ALL, BCR-ABL1 (left panel) and P2RY8-CRLF2 (right panel). The
  schematics depicting each fusion were produced using a program for visualization
  of gene rearrangements from RNA sequencing data (Clinker https://github.com/Oshlack/Clinker.
  Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance
  of this site or any other third party hosted site.). The Clinker images show, from
  top to bottom, the coverage of reads mapped to each fusion, functional domains,
  and transcript variants. The breakpoint in each gene and associated fusion is also
  shown. The pathways show downstream kinases that are activated as a result of each
  fusion and consequently the impact on expression and/or degradation of mediators
  of cell survival. Therapeutic interventions at each point are shown in the red-shaded
  boxes. Constitutive activation of the ABL1 kinase, mediated by BCR-ABL1, promotes
  activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used
  to either target ABL1 (imatinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib) directly or by MEK inhibitors.
  Phosphorylation of ERK, in turn, decreases BIM expression, blocks MCL-1 degradation,
  and increases BCL-2 expression. This prevents BAX/BAK activation. Pro-survival proteins
  BCL-2 and BCL-XL can be therapeutically targeted with BH3-mimetics (ABT-737, ABT-263,
  or ABT-199). The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion cooperates with JAK2 mutations, the most common
  of which, p.R683G/R683S/R683T/R683K, is depicted to promote cell survival. Activated
  JAK2 can be directly inhibited with ruxolitinib. STAT5 promotes transcription and
  increased expression of BCL-XL, and perhaps BCL-2 and MCL-1 also. Treatment with
  BH3-mimetics may increase the capacity of these cells to undergo apoptosis in response
  to JAK2 inhibition.
