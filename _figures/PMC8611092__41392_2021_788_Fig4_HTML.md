caption: The specific mechanism of circRNAs and PI3K/AKT pathway in different cancers.
  a Circ-0072309 sponges miR-100 to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in kidney cancer.
  CircC3P1 inhibits kidney cancer progression via regulation of miR/PTEN pathways
  and the PI3K/AKT pathway. b Circ0001085 regulates prostate cancer progression through
  the PI3K/AKT pathway by sponging miR-196b-5p and miR-451a. c Overexpression of circ0002577
  enhances the IGF1R/PI3K/AKT axis to increase the migration, invasion, and proliferation
  of endometrial cancer cells. d CircCSPP1 expression inhibits cervical cancer cell
  apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation and migration via the miR-361-5p/ITGB1/PI3K/AKT
  axis in cervical cancer. Image created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
