caption: Schematic presentation of low-dose IR-induced immune effects in the spleen
  of mice, according to Cho et al. [274]. Distinct mitochondria-dependent pathways
  for the activation or suppression of immune effects are indicated. The upregulation
  of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-5 in TH1LTH2 cells leads to the activation of the
  immune response. The downregulation of cytokines TGFβ1, and TGFβ3) in T regular
  cells (Treg cells) leads to the suppression of the immune response
