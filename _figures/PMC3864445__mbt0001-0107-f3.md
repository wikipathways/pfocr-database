caption: Fermentative hydrogen production from glucose by C. acetobutylicum, a strict
  anaerobic bacterium. Hydrogen can be produced through the action of PFOR and NFOR.
  The maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is 4 mol of H2 per mole of glucose, with
  acetate or acetone as the fermentation end‐product. The glucose metabolic pathway
  results in lactate, acetate, ethanol, acetone, butanol and butyrate as fermentation
  end‐products. The proteins shown in bold with an asterisk have been studied in Clostridium
  species through metabolic engineering in order to enhance biohydrogen production.
  G3PDH, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase; PFOR, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase;
  NFOR, NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; NADH, nicotineamide‐adenine dinucleotide;
  red, reduced.
