caption: 'Schematic representation of Thr and 1C metabolism in mammalian and heterotrophic
  plant cells involved in stem cell maintenance. We propose that Thr is taken up by
  a subpopulation of perinuclear mitochondria specialized to metabolize it to formate
  in mammalian ES cells. The mitochondria then release the formate to a compartment
  used specifically for H3K4me di- and tri-methylation via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)
  1-carbon (1C)-dependent metabolism (). When the GDC is inhibited, it is unable to
  complete Thr catabolism. Thus, H3K4me3 formation is suppressed, and the 2-amino
  acetoacetate produced from Thr is instead converted to methylglyoxal which fosters
  ES cell senescence (; ). Expression of enzymes in the serine synthesis pathway in
  TDH-deficient hES cells is up-regulated likely to circumvent the need for Thr metabolism
  via TDH (). This specific pathway in hES cells is shown in green in mammalian cell;
  a similar pathway in plant cell is not shown. In most mammalian ES cells, serine
  derived from glycolytic intermediates acts as a major source of 1C units (). In
  heterotrophic plant cells, Thr is synthesized in undifferentiated and non-photosynthetic
  plastids. Folates (F) and their polyglutamylated forms are accumulated in plastids,
  mitochondria, and the cytosol. Polyglutamylated folates [F-Glu(n)] are the preferred
  cofactors for 1C enzymes, and FPGS mediates the addition of Glu residues to folate
  derivatives. Thr synthesis and polyglutamylated folates are critical for stem cell
  maintenance (; ; see also ). Groups marked in red are 1C units derived from Thr,
  Ser, Gly, and formate, which are eventually used for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 methylations.
