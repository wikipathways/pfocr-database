caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms of the IL-17–TRAF6 pathway. TRAF2 and TRAF5 interact
  with ACT1 and activate downstream MAPK signaling. The TRAF2/5 binding with ACT1
  is dependent on ACT1 S311 phosphorylation by IKKε. IKKε and TBK1 can also be involved
  in the suppression of the association of ACT1–TRAF6 binding. Hsp90 is a chaperone
  protein of ACT1. The binding between Hsp90 and ACT1 is required for the IL-17 signaling
  and is dependent on ACT1 D19. SCFβ−TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes are involved
  in the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of ACT1. TRAF3 is expected
  to inhibit IL-17 signaling by competing with ACT1 to interact with IL-17R. TRAF4
  is also suggested to be a negative regulator for IL-17 signaling, probably due to
  the competition of TRAF4 with TRAF6 for the interaction with ACT1. Peli1 opposes
  to TRAF3, by promoting TRAF6-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of c-IAP, which then
  ubiquitinates TRAF3 with K48 linkage, resulting in TRAF3 proteasomal degradation.
  NDR1 interferes TRAF3–TRAF6 interaction. A20 is a negative regulator for ubiquitin
  signaling via dual activity: () deubiquitinase activity to K63-linked chains and
  () K48-linked ubiquitinase activity mediating proteasomal degradation of substrate
  signaling molecules. ABIN1 promotes A20 activity. CYLD and USP25 are other deubiquitinases.
