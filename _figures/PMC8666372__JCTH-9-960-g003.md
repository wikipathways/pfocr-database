caption: When Wnt signaling is off, β-catenin (in a multiprotein complex with GSK-3β,
  axin, CK1α, β-TrCP and APC) is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and CK1α and ubiquitinated
  by β-TrCP. In the end, β-catenin is degraded by the proteosome. When Wnt signaling
  is on, Dvl inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation by inhibiting GSK-3β activity. The
  Wnt-Fz-LPR5/6 heterotrimer coordinates Dvl activation, dissociating the multiprotein
  complex and resulting in the inactivation of GSK-3β (no phosphorylation anymore).
  Unphosphorylated β-catenin increases, then migrates to the nucleus and links to
  TCF/LEF and CBP. The TCF/β-catenin complex links DNA and leads to transcription
  of Wnt target genes. Antifibrotic compounds that inhibit Wnt signaling and prevent
  liver fibrosis are DKK1, niclosamide, sFRP5, SB-216763, PRI-724, ICG-001, and PSH.
