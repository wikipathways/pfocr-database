caption: Alternative models for the function of presynaptic UNC-31 (CAPS). As indicated
  by our results, both A and B show UNC-31 acting in the same cells as neuronal Gαs,
  in the same molecular pathway as Gαs, upstream of Gαs, with a site of action at
  or near the synaptic active zone, and not directly interacting with the Gαqpathway.
  Both models depict CAPS acting as a dense-core vesicle priming protein as described
  in vertebrate studies (). (A) UNC-31 exerts its effects on the Gαspathway via exocytosis
  of a dense-core vesicle neurotransmitter/neuropeptide that then locally activates
  a G protein-coupled receptor that is already present in the presynaptic membrane.
  (B) UNC-31 exerts its effects on the Gαspathway via exocytotic deposition of one
  or more G protein-coupled receptors in the presynaptic membrane, similar to the
  phenomena described in vertebrate neuronal cell bodies ().
