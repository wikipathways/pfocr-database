caption: 'Model of regulatory pathways involved in female reproductive physiology
  in Rhodnius prolixus: impact of the nutritional states. In R. prolixus, after a
  blood meal, ILP/IGF are release into the circulation and promote a phosphorylation
  cascade mediating the InR signaling activation. By western blot we showed that p-Akt,
  p-GSK, p-FoxO, p-mToR, p-p70S6K and p-4E-BP1 are up-regulated in both fat body and
  ovaries (green boxes) of fed females. The presence of other components of the ILP/ToR
  siganling pathway (gray boxes) were checked by transcriptome analysis or RT-qPCR.
  In the fed condition, we assume that all of them are actively participating in the
  signaling cascade, promoting lipogenesis, glycogenesis and translation regulation,
  along with other events. We suggest that the network of interactions and regulations
  informed by the nutritional state of the CNS, fat body and ovary, including those
  related with nutrient biosynthesis and storage, stimulate oocyte growth. In the
  unfed condition, we demonstrated that in the fat body and the ovaries there is an
  increase in gene expression of molecules related to the ILP/ToR signaling pathway.
  However, it is not possible to find these proteins activated (phosphorylated proteins).
  In unfed females, we suggest that nutrient stores decrease in both tissues and the
  oocyte growth is inhibited. In addition, by immunofluorescence and gene silencing
  assays, we show that FoxO factor is translocated to the nucleus in this state and
  assume that this player a role in increasing the insulin-sensitive pathway and modulating
  longevity signaling.'
