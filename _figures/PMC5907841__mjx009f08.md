caption: Proposed model for FXR regulation by concerted actions of CK2 and RNF4. FXR
  conjugates SUMO2 at accepting Lys-325 following phosphorylation of Ser-327 by CK2
  providing the required negative charge for Ubc9 action and full pSuM activity. This
  process is also optimized with the action of E3 ligase PIAS1 and the presence of
  FXR agonists such as GW4064 and bile acid CDCA. The process by which FXR agonist
  seems to first result in receptor de-ubiquitination is not known but enhancement
  of SUMO2 addition to FXR helps recruiting ubiquitin ligase RNF4 presumably through
  its recognized SIM motifs. Such recruitment of RNF4 is then required for efficient
  FXR activation in response to ligand and to transcriptional coactivators, and also
  promotes FXR ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. It is proposed
  that this CK2–RNF4 interplay coordinates an activation-degradation cycling pathway
  that regulates FXR responsive genes.

  description: Proposed model for FXR regulation by concerted actions of CK2 and RNF4.
    FXR conjugates SUMO2 at accepting Lys-325 following phosphorylation of Ser-327
    by CK2 providing the required negative charge for Ubc9 action and full pSuM activity.
    This process is also optimized with the action of E3 ligase PIAS1 and the presence

    seems to first result in receptor de-ubiquitination is not known but enhancement

    its recognized SIM motifs. Such recruitment of RNF4 is then required for efficient
    FXR activation in response to ligand and to transcriptional coactivators, and
    also promotes FXR ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. It is
    proposed that this CK2–RNF4 interplay coordinates an activation-degradation cycling
    pathway that regulates FXR responsive genes.
