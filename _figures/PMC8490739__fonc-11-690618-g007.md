caption: Schematic model of the role of the SMYD3/ITGB6/TGFβ1 positive feedback loop
  in promoting the invasion and adhesion of ovarian cancer spheroids. In ovarian cancer
  spheroids, SMYD3 can increase the expression of ITGB6. When latent TGFβ1 binds to
  ITGB6 on the cell surface, TGFβ1 is activated and upregulates the expression of
  N-cadherin, Snail, Vimentin as well as downregulates E-cadherin to enhance the invasion
  and adhesion of ovarian cancer spheroids by stimulating the Smad3 pathway. Ovarian
  cancer spheroids can release more latent TGFβ1 at the same time. In addition, TGFβ1
  can also facilitate the expression of SMYD3 and ITGB6 in a feedback manner.
