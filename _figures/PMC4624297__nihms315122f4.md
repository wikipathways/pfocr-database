caption: Comparison of typical innate immune signaling cascades (top panel) with those
  activated by CJD infection (bottom panel). The pathway diagram has been adapted
  from . Dotted lines indicate interactions that are indirect or hypothetical. Typical
  innate immune responses are initiated by recognition of certain foreign protein
  motifs, mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) or other molecules (at A). This leads
  to the activation of NFκB and IRF-3 transcription factors, which induce the expression
  of interferons, RANTES, ISG15, CXCL10, and other genes as part of a primary response
  (at B). Newly synthesized interferons (at C), acting through the type I interferon
  receptor (IFNAR1/2), activate the STAT1/STAT2/IRF-9 transcription factor complex
  and instigate two major effects. First, this complex amplifies the expression of
  some primary response genes (at D). Second, this complex stimulates the expression
  of a distinct set of transcripts, termed secondary response genes (at E). One of
  these secondary response genes, the IRF-7 transcription factor, augments transcription
  of type I interferons and thus completes a positive feedback loop in the innate
  immune response (at F). In comparison to nonspecific stimuli, the CJD agent does
  not appear to follow the same recognition pathway (G) leading to increased interferon
  transcription (H) or synthesis (I). The CJD agent instead elevates certain primary
  (J) and secondary (K) response genes in an interferon-independent manner, which
  may involve IRF family transcription factors. The induction of IRF-7 in CJD microglia
  in principle should result in positive feedback onto the IFNβ promoter (L), priming
  the cells to exhibit a potentiated response to a challenge stimulus such as poly
  I:C.

  description: Comparison of typical innate immune signaling cascades (top panel)
    with those activated by CJD infection (bottom panel). The pathway diagram has
    been adapted from . Dotted lines indicate interactions that are indirect or hypothetical.
    Typical innate immune responses are initiated by recognition of certain foreign
    protein motifs, mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) or other molecules (at
    A). This leads to the activation of NFκB and IRF-3 transcription factors, which
    induce the expression of interferons, RANTES, ISG15, CXCL10, and other genes as
    part of a primary response (at B). Newly synthesized interferons (at C), acting
    through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1/2), activate the STAT1/STAT2/IRF-9
    transcription factor complex and instigate two major effects. First, this complex
    amplifies the expression of some primary response genes (at D). Second, this complex
    stimulates the expression of a distinct set of transcripts, termed secondary response
    genes (at E). One of these secondary response genes, the IRF-7 transcription factor,
    augments transcription of type I interferons and thus completes a positive feedback
    loop in the innate immune response (at F). In comparison to nonspecific stimuli,
    the CJD agent does not appear to follow the same recognition pathway (G) leading
    to increased interferon transcription (H) or synthesis (I). The CJD agent instead
    elevates certain primary (J) and secondary (K) response genes in an interferon-independent

    in CJD microglia in principle should result in positive feedback onto the IFNβ
