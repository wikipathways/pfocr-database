caption: The sphingolipid synthesis pathway. The initial steps occur in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), with the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine, forming 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  (3-KDS), catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. 3-KDS is then reduced to dihydrosphingosine
  (DHS) by 3-keto dihydrosphingosine reductase. DHS can be hydroxylated to generate
  phytosphingosine (PHS). DHS and PHS can be phosphorylated, forming DHS-1-P and PHS-1-P
  respectively, or acylated by distinct ceramide synthases, producing the pool of
  ceramides which will be used for the synthesis of neutral and acid sphingolipids.
  The transfer of inositol-phosphate to phytoceramide, catalyzed by inositol phosphorylceramide
  synthase (Ipc1) in the Golgi, leads to the synthesis of inositol phosphorylceramide
  (IPC). Finally, IPCs are mannosylated into mannosyl-inositol phosphorylceramides
  (MIPC). The final step of the neutral sphingolipid synthesis consists of the addition
  of a glucose moiety to Δ8-C9,Me-Cer and is catalyzed by glucosylceramide (GlcCer)
  synthase (Gcs1) in the Golgi.
