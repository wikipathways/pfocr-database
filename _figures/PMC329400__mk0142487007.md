caption: 'Model for the dynamic exclusion of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane by a retention-retrieval
  mechanism. In the basal state, GLUT4 vesicles preferentially fuse with endosomes
  relative to the plasma membrane, thereby depleting the cell surface of GLUT4. Any
  GLUT4 that is introduced into the plasma membrane is rapidly retrieved by clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis back to endosomes. Insulin increases the exocytic rate of GLUT4 and
  thereby induces an increase of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane. Compartments of the
  insulin-regulated pathway are in gray. The half-time for appearance of GLUT4 at
  the cell surface in the presence and absence of insulin were directly measured,
  as was the equilibration time between endosomes and the specialized compartment
  in the basal state. For kinetic modeling experiments, the following parameters were
  used: a half-time of GLUT4 internalization of 10 min (), and a steady-state distribution
  of GLUT4 in the basal state of 4% in the plasma membrane and 48% each in endosomes
  and the specialized pool. A value of 4% on the surface was calculated from % GLUT4Surface
  = 1/(1 + (kInternalziation/kExocytosis)), with kInternalziation = 0.07 min-1 ()
  and kExocytosis = 0.003 min-1. The values for k2 in insulin and k4 in basal and
  insulin conditions were determined using SAAM II compartmentalization modeling software
  (; ). See text for discussion of the model.'
