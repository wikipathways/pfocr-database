caption: Process and regulation of autophagy. Energy restriction inhibits mTOR and
  promotes autophagy. Under energy constraints, the increased AMP/ATP ratio activates
  the AMPK pathway, which either directly promotes autophagy or promotes autophagy
  by inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Energy restriction also activates CREB protein through
  the protein kinase A signaling pathway and activates transcription factor EB by
  inhibiting mTORC1. These autophagy transcription factors will promote the transcription
  of autophagy-related proteins and lysosomal proteins. Amino acid deficiency activates
  mTOR and Gcn4 signaling pathways, and promotes autophagy. mTOR inhibition and AMPK
  activation promotes the activation of the ULK1 complex upstream of autophagy. The
  ULK1 complex promotes the formation of the PI3K and ATG complexes, and ultimately
  promotes the occurrence of autophagy. After the initiation of autophagy, through
  a series of cascade reactions, the process of expansion and closure occurs, followed
  by consecutive encircle and fusion steps, which finally leads to the formation of
  the autolysosome. ULK1, Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; CREB, cAMP-response element binding; PKA, protein kinase A; mTORC1,
