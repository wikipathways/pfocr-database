caption: Coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway. The dashed arrows indicate decarboxylation
  and hydroxylation steps that are catalyzed by unknown enzyme(s), thus resulting
  in an uncertainty in the order of reactions. Intermediates in the pathway include
  4-HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate; 4-HMA, 4-hydroxymandelate; 4-Hbz, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde;
  4-HB, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate; HPB, 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenyl-benzoic acid; DHPB, 4,5-dihydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoic
  acid; HMPB, 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-polyprenylbenzoic acid; DHP, 4,5-dihydroxy-3-polyprenylphenol;
  DDMQH2, 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone; DMQH2, 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone;
  DMeQH2, 3-methyl-6-methoxy-2-polyprenyl-1,4,5-benzenetriol; n is the number of isoprene
  units in the polyisoprenyl tail. Yeast can also utilize p-aminobenzoic acid as a
  ring precursor, and its prenylation by Coq2 produces the early intermediate 4-amino-3-polyprenyl-benzoic
  acid (HAB, []). Adapted with permission from Wang et al. []. Created with Biorender.com
