caption: Immunological mechanisms of recombinant, protein-based vaccination. (A) PBV
  structure, as illustrated here for the model protein hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg,
  183 aa long, non-truncated form, Accession number P03146), is ultimately determined
  by primary sequence. Vaccine can comprise monomeric antigen (i.e., toxoid protein)
  or multimeric antigen (i.e., virus-like particles), though multimeric antigen is
  used for demonstration purposes here. T cell and B cell antigenic determinants can
  be identified in primary sequence using various in vitro and in silico methods.
  The linear MHC epitopes illustrated here were predicted using Epitope Analysis Resources
  on the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) website. More specifically, MHC epitopes were
  predicted for HLA-A*02:01 (class I molecules) and all heterodimer combinations of
  DQB1*02:01 (class II molecules) using IEDB recommended methods. Linear B cell epitopes,
  on the other hand, were assigned using frequency analysis results from the IEDB
  website (). PBV structures are color coded to represent epitope content. (B) Cell
  processing and activation in response to PBV is generally orchestrated by antigen
  presenting cells, of which the most important are dendritic cells. APCs sample their
  environment via endocytosis, specifically via receptor-mediated endocytosis when
  antigen presents glycan and/or protein pathogen-associated molecular patterns such
  as high mannose glycans or bacterial flagellin. Depending on the structural and
  compositional characteristics of the antigen, APCs will either process antigen via
  MHC class II pathway or MHC class I pathway using a mechanism known as cross-presentation,
  respectively, resulting in activation of either CD4+ (helper) or CD8+ (cytotoxic)
  T cell response. CD4+ T cell activation requires co-activating signals and results
  in the proliferation of effector and memory CD4+ T cell pools. Effector CD4+ T cells
  go on to assist with the activation of B cells (T cell dependent activation) and
  provide survival signals to activated CD8+ T cells, whereas CD8+ T cells have immediate
  effector functionality. B cells can also undergo T cell independent activation when
  antigen cross-links multiple BCRs on B cells surface (TI-2 activation) or co-signals
  via PRR (TI-1 activation) (, ). (C) Activation results in the proliferation of memory
  and effector cytotoxic T cell and B cell pools. Memory CD8+ cells remain dormant
  until they encounter cells presenting MHC class I molecules loaded with cognate
  epitope, upon which they begin mounting an effector response. Effector CD8+ T cells
  go on to instruct apoptosis in cells presenting MHC class I molecules loaded with
  cognate epitope. B cells activated via T cell independent pathway generally proliferate
  into short-lived plasmablasts that express low affinity IgM antibodies (not shown).
  B cells activated via T cell dependent pathway, on the other hand, result in the
  proliferation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells expressing high-affinity
  IgA, IgE, or IgG antibodies. Antibodies secreted by plasms cells (and plasmablasts)
  go on to bind vaccine and pathogen and initiate antibody effector functions. Memory
  B cells remain dormant until they encounter antigen presenting cognate epitope,
  upon which they rapidly proliferate and clones either class switch to become antibody
  secreting plasma cells or re-enter germinal centers and restart affinity maturation
  processes (, ). The 3D protein structure for HBcAg used in this image was rendered
  in PyMOL 2.3.0 and accessed via the Protein Data Bank (, , ).
