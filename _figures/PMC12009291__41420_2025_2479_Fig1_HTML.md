caption: The balance between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis is intricately regulated
  during kidney cancer progression. The reciprocal regulatory interaction between
  FBP1 and EZH2, key components of gluconeogenic pathways, has been identified as
  a potential therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In contrast, the
  glycolysis-associated gene DEPDC1 plays a pivotal role in driving malignant progression
  and drug resistance in RCC, suggesting that glycolysis inhibitors such as 3BrPA
  may offer promising targeted therapeutic options for ccRCC. Additionally, PFKFB4
  has been shown to mediate resistance to sunitinib by enhancing the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). Meanwhile, ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH)
  and circFOXP1 influence RCC progression through their impact on the Warburg effect.
  RCC progression is significantly influenced by key enzymes involved in the fatty
  acid metabolic pathway. Malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase (MLYCD) and E3 ubiquitin
  ligase TRIM21 suppress tumor progression by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and
  promoting fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, the AMPK-GATA3-ECHS1 pathway facilitates
  fatty acid synthesis and supports cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, hypoxia-inducible
  factors (HIFs) inhibit fatty acid oxidation by downregulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1 (CPT1). Created by Biorender.com. RCC renal cell carcinoma, UQCRH ubiquinone-cytochrome
