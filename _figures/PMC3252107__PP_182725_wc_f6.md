caption: Model for the hormonal control of branching in pea integrating the function
  of PsBRC1 in the axillary bud and the auxin transport canalization-based model (Domagalska
  and ). PsBRC1 integrates the SL and CK pathways to control bud outgrowth. CK also
  increases bud growth via a PsBRC1-independent pathway. Auxin maintains RMS1 transcript
  levels, and hence SL synthesis, and down-regulates CK levels. The RMS2-dependent
  feedback, which up-regulates SL biosynthesis and down-regulates xylem CK, is activated
  when there is a lack of SL signaling via RMS4 and may be independent of PsBRC1.
  SLs reduce PIN accumulation to the plasma membrane via RMS4 but independently of
  PsBRC1 and, by reducing the effectiveness of the canalization feedback loop, enhance
  the competition between active buds.
