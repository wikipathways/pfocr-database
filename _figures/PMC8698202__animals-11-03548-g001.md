caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways and functions of Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs). TLRs 2 and 6 use the adaptor protein MyD88 and activate the transcription
  factor NF-κB, which induces inflammatory gene expression. TLR3 uses the adaptor
  protein TRIF, which activates the IRF3 transcription factor and NF-κB. TLR4 uses
  both MyD88 and TRIF, leading to activation of NF-κB and IRF3 pathways, respectively.
  TLRs 7, 8, and 9 in the endosome use MyD88, leading to activation of both NF-κB
  and IRF7, promoting expression of genes whose products mediate inflammation and
  antiviral defense. DNA viruses are sensed in the cytosol by the presence of the
  DNA sensors, the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in the activation of NF-κB and IRFs.
  RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize microbial nucleic acids and initiate the
  MAVs-STING pathways. The pathway targeted by feline coronavirus/feline peritonis
  virus (FeCoV/FIPV) and feline herpesvirus-1 (FeHV-1) are highlighted using  and
  , respectively.  FeCoV infection induced higher gene expression level of TLRs 2,
  4, 8 and 9, but not TLRs 3 and 7, suggesting either lack of an appropriate trigger,
  or virus inhibition of TLR trascripion. The synthesis of accessory proteins 7a and
  3 by FeCoV are probably involved in the inhibition of type I IFN synthesis. The
  FIPV nsp5 produced an inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and suppression of type
  I IFN production.  FeHV-1 infection induced an upregulation of TRL9 expression and
  a downregulation of TLR3. The FeHV-1 US3 protein competitively binds to IRF binding
  domain hindering dimerization of IRF3. TIR, Toll IL-1 receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptors;
