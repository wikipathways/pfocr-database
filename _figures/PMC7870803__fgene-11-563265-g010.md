caption: Diagram depicting the molecular regulation mechanism of the NEAT1/miR-129-5p/PEG3
  axis in liver fibrosis of mice with NASH through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In
  mice with NASH, NEAT1, and PEG3 are highly expressed while miR-129-5p is poorly
  expressed. NEAT1 upregulates PEG3 expression by competitively binding to miR-129-5p
  to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, by which HSC apoptosis is inhibited and
  HSCs are activated to accelerate the process of liver fibrosis. N = 6.
