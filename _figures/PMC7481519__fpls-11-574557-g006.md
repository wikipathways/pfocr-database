caption: A model for the role of βC1 in regulating plant defense reaction. (A) The
  signaling pathway of SCF complex in plants. SCF complex is one kind of E3 ligase.
  E2-Ub complex can interact with E3 ligase via the help from Rbx1, making the E3
  protein substrates (JAZ1) carry with polyubiquitin chain. Then, JAZ1-Ub chain is
  recognized by 26S proteasome, eventually degraded, releasing MYC2 transcription
  factor to activate genes expression in plant defense. (B) The pathway of SCF complex
  when plants were infected by TYLCCNV. βC1 can bind to SKP1 protein and interfere
  the normal function of SCF complex. JAZ1-MYC2 was stable and genes expression in
  plant defense were not activated.
