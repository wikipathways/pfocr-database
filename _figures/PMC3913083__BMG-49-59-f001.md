caption: The signaling pathways involved in the control of skeletal muscle atrophy
  and hypertrophy. Signaling activated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) positively
  regulates muscle mass, primarily via induction of protein synthesis, downstream
  of Akt and mTOR. The myostatin/GDF11/activin pathway negatively regulates muscle
  size, as a result of the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 – primarily by inhibiting Akt.
  IGF1 acts via the IGF receptor (IGFR), and the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1),
  – activating Akt. Akt activates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 is a multiprotein
  complex that requires the protein raptor for its function and is acutely inhibited
  by FKBP/rapamycin. mTORC1 controls protein synthesis by phosphorylating S6 kinase
  1 (S6K) and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). The multiprotein complex mTORC2 includes
  the protein rictor and contributes to the activation of Akt. Downstream targets
  of Akt include glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription
  factors. Inhibition of GSK3β by Akt relieves inhibition onto the initiation factor
  eIF2B, and thereby increases protein synthesis. Activation of Akt also inhibits
  FOXO and decreases expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases Muscle Atrophy Fbox (MAFbx)
  and Muscle Ring Finger1 (MuRF1). Substrates of MAFbx and MuRF1 are the initiation
  factor eIF3-f and myosin chains, respectively. Another more recently discovered
  E3 ligase is Fbxo40, which can ubiquitinate IRS1 upon IGF1 stimulation, short-circuiting
  this pathway unless the muscle is capable of synthesizing new IGF1, via maintenance
  of TORC1/protein synthesis signaling. To induce hypertrophy, in addition to the
  classical IGF-1/Akt pathway, more recently the Galpha-i2 pathway has been shown
  to induce hypertrophy via PKC, bypassing Akt. In addition to the PKC pathway downstream
  of Galpha-i2, there is a PKC-independent pathway which involves inhibition of HDAC4.The
  myostatin/TGFβ pathway acts via several receptors and results in the activation
  of Smad 2,3. Activation of Smad proteins inhibits the function of Akt and the expression
  of MAFbx and MuRF1 by FOXO transcription factors. The function of Smad 2,3 is also
  inhibited by mTORC1. (see colour version of this figure at www.informahealthcare.com/bmg).
