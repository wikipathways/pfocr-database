caption: Proposed unknown sucrose signaling pathway. The abundant presence of SuSy
  protein in whole organs of the transgenic plants leads to unbalanced sucrose status,
  particularly in non-photosynthetic cells, may be the cause of an unknown sucrose
  signaling pathway that targeted to the nuclei of photosynthetic cells. Consequently,
  the nucleus increases photosynthetic efficiency in chloroplasts through an unknown
  mechanism and photosynthetic sucrose synthesis is upregulated so the plant can cope
  with sucrose demand in non-photosynthetic cells. Sucrose becomes abundant, which
  induces increased expression of the WUSCHELL (WUS) and CycD3 genes that regulated
  shoot apical meristem (SAM) development. The increased development of SAM consists
  of an increase in the numbers of stem-cells, leading to faster vegetative growth
  and changes in developmental stages. This proposed pathway fits the pronounced phenotypic
  and morphological changes that occurred in the transgenic tobacco plants.
