caption: 'The biosynthesis of BRs in plants. (A) the generation of brassinosteroid
  precursors, specifically FPP, which includes the following steps: (1) Two molecules
  of A-CoA are condensed to form AA-CoA, a process catalyzed by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase
  (AACT). (2) AA-CoA then combines with another molecule of A-CoA to produce HMG-CoA,
  catalyzed by HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS). (3) HMG-CoA is subsequently reduced to mevalonate
  (MVA) by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), utilizing two molecules of NADPH. (4) MVA undergoes
  three consecutive phosphorylation reactions, catalyzed by mevalonate kinase (MK),
  phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MPD),
  to IPP. (5) IPP is partially converted to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by IPI.
  Finally, IPP and DMAPP are condensed by prenyltransferases (PTS) to form the brassinosteroid
  precursor FPP; (B) The generation of Campesterol, which involves: (1) The condensation
  of two molecules of FPP to form squalene (Sqn), catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS).
  (2) Sqn is then oxidized to 2,3-oxidosqualene by squaleneepoxidase (SQE). (3) 2,3-Oxidosqualene
  is converted to cycloartenol by cycloartenol synthase (CAS). (4) Cycloartenol (Cycloart)
  undergoes a series of demethylation, dehydrogenation, and isomerization reactions
  to ultimately form campesterol (Cmpt); (C) The generation of BRs, which can occur
  through two pathways: (1) The CN-dependent pathway, which includes: (a) Cmpt is
  reduced to CN by 5α-reductase (DET2). (b) CN is hydroxylated at the C-22 position
  by C-22 hydroxylase (DWF4/CYP90B1) to form 22-hydroxycampestanol (22-OH-Cmpt). (c)
  22-OH-Cmpt is further hydroxylated at the C-23 position by C-23 hydroxylase (ROT3/CYP90D1)
  to form 22,23-dihydroxycampestanol (22,23-OH-Cmpt). (d) 22,23-OH-Cmpt is oxidized
  at the C-6 position by C-6 oxidase (BR6ox/CYP85A1/A2) to form CS. (e) CS is further
  modified to form the bioactive R. (2) The non-CN-dependent pathway, which includes:
  (a) CN is directly hydroxylated at the C-22 position by DWF4/CYP90B1 to form 22-OH-Cmpt.
  (b) 22-OH-Cmpt is oxidized at the BR6ox/CYP85A1/A2 to form 22-OHCmpt. (c) 22-OHCmpt
  undergoes a series of modifications to ultimately form the bioactive BR'
