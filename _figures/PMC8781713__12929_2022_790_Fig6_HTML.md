caption: LRG1 signalling pathways. Simplified schematic representation of generic
  signalling pathways known, or speculated, to be modulated by LRG1 in a cell-specific
  manner. LRG1 likely modifies cell behaviour both directly, by altering the cell
  transcriptome, and indirectly by interfering with intermediate steps of the signalling
  cascades. LRG1 has been mainly described as a modifier of the TGFβ canonical pathway.
  While promoting pathogenic angiogenesis in endothelial cells through the ALK1-Smad1/5/8
  pathway [, ], LRG1 may also modulate the ALK5-Smad2/3 arm to favour the formation
  of myofibroblasts [, ] and Th17 lymphocytes [], thus sustaining fibrosis and inflammation,
  as well as glioma cell migration []. TGFβ non-canonical signalling is also likely
  to mediate some of the LRG1-driven biological functions including neutrophil activation
  and wound healing via AKT [, ], as well as the modulation of stem/cancer cell phenotype
  via ROCK1 [] and p38/MAPK [, ]. Activation of the TGFβ-related transcription factors
  HIF-1α [] and RUNX1 [] has also been associated with LRG1 pro-oncogenic functions,
  although the specific upstream pathways subject to LRG1 modification in this context
  remain to be formally clarified. Additional transduction factors involved in LRG1
  signalling include (i) EGFR which promotes pancreatic cancer cell malignancy through
  p38/MAPK [], dissemination of melanoma cells [] and cornea repair through STAT3
  []; (ii) the IL-6/STAT3 axis which modulates neutrophil chemotaxis []; (iii) Wnt/βcatenin
  which, in the heart, inhibit fibroblast proliferation and migration []. Further
  investigations are needed to address whether LRG1 modulates the activity of other
  receptor-mediated signalling pathways including BMPs, and whether other receptors
  may also be directly or indirectly affected by LRG1. BMP bone morphogenic protein,
