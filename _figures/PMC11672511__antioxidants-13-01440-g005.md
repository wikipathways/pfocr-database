caption: 'TNFR1-mediated survival and cell death pathways. Cell death signaling engaged
  by TNFα initiates with the adaptor TRADD protein that binds TNFR1 by its death domain
  and, in turn, serves as a signal to recruit RIPK1. Then, RIPK1 is polyubiquitinated
  by the combined action of TRAFs with c-IAPs and triggers the translocation of different
  ubiquitin-associated proteins and kinases, including OPTN, TAK1, and the serine/threonine-protein
  kinase TBK1. This signaling cascade promotes the stabilization of RIPK1 in complex
  I and the activation of pro-survival NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Conversely, inhibition
  of c-IAPs permits the removal of polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1 by the ubiquitin
  carboxyl-terminal hydrolase CYLD. RIPK1 is released from complex I and binds FADD
  and pro-CASP8 in complex IIa. TRAIL/TNFSF10 and FASL-mediated signaling can also
  participate in the assembly of complex IIa. Then, activated CASP8 can cleave the
  kinase domain of RIPK1, thereby triggering apoptosis; however, when CASP8 is deficient,
  RIPK1 remains active, and the signaling pathway is switched from apoptosis to necroptosis.
  Under necroptotic permissive conditions, RIPK1 interacts with RIPK3 through their
  RHIMs motifs, leading to the formation of a signaling platform, named necrosome
  (complex IIb). Upon necrosome assembly, RIPK3 forms homodimers, which leads to activating
  cis-autophosphorylation of T231/S232 in mouse and S227 in human RIPK3. Then, the
  kinase domain of RIPK3 binds to the C-terminal domain of MLKL and phosphorylates
  S345 in mice and T357/S358 in human MLKL, allowing the assembly of MLKL into oligomers.
  Ultimately, these MLKL polymers form pores in the plasma membrane that drive lytic
  cell death [156]. Abbreviations: CASP8, caspase 8; c-IAPs, cellular inhibitors of
