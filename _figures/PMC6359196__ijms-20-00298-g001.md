caption: 'The hepatic metabolism of lipid and carbohydrate through insulin induced
  transcriptional regulation and circadian clock. Insulin signals and insulin-induced
  regulators: The schematic depicts the synergistic action of insulin and glucose
  in regulating lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue. Most of the insulin-mediated
  metabolic actions are controlled by the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway. Under insulin stimulation,
  glycogenolysis is inhibited by activating PP1 and phosphodiesterase. Insulin activates
  the transcription of Srebp-1c and the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1c protein.
  The insulin-induced Srebp-1c transcription is facilitated by LXR and SREBPs themselves.
  LXR promotes lipogenesis not only primarily by increasing Srebp-1c expression, but
  also directly activate the promoters of Chrebp and some lipogenic genes. ChREBP
  is also activated by glucose signal by multiple mechanisms for the further progression
  of lipogenesis. Metabolism of glucose and lipid: After diet, vascular endothelium
  in adipose tissue absorbs and hydrolyzes triglycerides into non-esterified fatty
  acids by insulin-activated lipoprotein lipase. As released fatty acids are conveyed
  into adipocyte by fatty acids transporters, fatty acids are then re-esterified using
  glycerol 3-phosphate derived from glucose as a backbone to form triglycerides and
  stored as lipid droplets. Whereas fasting will promote lipolysis to convert triglycerides
  within lipid droplets into free fatty acid which is then uptook by hepatocytes for
  energy production. Insulin also promotes the absorption of glucose transporter to
  the plasma membrane of adipocyte for glucose uptake. However, insulin resistance
  causes the accelerated lipolysis in adipose tissue inappropriately and enhances
  hepatic glucose production through glycogenolysis, which further upregulates hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis and contributes to a critical biochemical pathway for the pathogenesis
  of NAFLD. Cross-talk between insulin and circadian clock: Growing evidences show
  a strong link between circadian clock with energy homeostasis. Hepatic circadian
  clock is regulated by insulin and altered by insulin resistance. In turn, circadian
  clock plays an essential role for regulating insulin secretion in the pancreas and
  balancing blood sugar levels. Insulin-induced regulators, such as SREBP-2, ChREBP,
  and lipogenic genes, also are directly targeted by circadian clock that drives the
  rhythmic expression of master regulators and rate-limiting enzymes of key hepatic
  metabolic outputs.'
