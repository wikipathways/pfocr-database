caption: A schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms by which PLK3 regulates
  TEC apoptosis after DNA damage in response to oxidative stress. Renal I/R injury
  causes severe oxidative stress, and ROS attack double-stranded DNA, resulting in
  DSBs, which activate the ATM/PLK3/P53 signaling pathway in response to DNA damage,
  triggering the P53-dependent downstream apoptotic cascade, and thereby promoting
  TEC apoptosis.
