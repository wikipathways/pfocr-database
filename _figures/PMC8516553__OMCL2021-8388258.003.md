caption: Transduction mechanism of the OS-mediated Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway
  in OC. Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm by Keap1.
  Keap1 binds Nrf2 to the Cullin3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes
  the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation of Nrf2 [, ]. Under conditions
  of OS, the cysteine residues exposed on the surface of Keap1 are oxidized, which
  causes Nrf2 to dissociate from Keap1, translocate to the nucleus, form a heterodimer
  with Maf, and then bind with ARE, thereby transcriptionally activating Nrf2-regulated
  antioxidant gene expression and inhibiting OS [, ]. The activation of the Nrf2 pathway
  is a double-edged sword in OC, and it maintains the stability of the normal ovarian
  cell environment and genome in order to prevent OS-induced carcinogenesis [], while
  it also protects tumor cells from OS thus enhancing the invasion and chemoresistance
  of OC [, ].
