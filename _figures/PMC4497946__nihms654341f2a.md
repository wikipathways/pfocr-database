caption: The PKA pathway. A. Ligand activation of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
  leads to activation of the stimulatory G protein (Gs) and its α-subunit; this is
  followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC). AC converts ATP into cAMP. In the
  basal state, PKA consists of two regulatory subunits (R) bound to two catalytic
  subunits (C). cAMP-binding to R causes dissociation from C, which is now free to
  act as a serine/threonine kinase. It can activate cAMP-responsive element binding
  protein (CREB) by phosphorylation, which mediates transcription of genes with cAMP-responsive
  element (CRE)-containing promoters. The PKA pathway contributes to the control of
  cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and hormone secretion. The phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs) hydrolyse cAMP, thereby reducing PKA pathway activity. B. In Carney complex,
  R1α levels are reduced, leading to increased PKA activation, reduced transforming
  growth factor β (TGFβ)-mediated apoptosis, increased mitogen activated protein kinase
  (MAPK)-dependent proliferation and a stimulated Wnt signalling pathway.
