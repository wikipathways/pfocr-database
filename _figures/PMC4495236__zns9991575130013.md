caption: Proposed scheme of Fyn-mediated neuroinflammatory signaling pathway in microglia.
  LPS and TNFα bind to their receptors, TLR4 and TNFR1, respectively, leading to early
  Fyn activation. Fyn then phosphorylates and activates PKCδ, which leads to the downstream
  activation of the MAP kinase and NFκB pathways. The p65 component of the NFκB complex
  enters the nucleus and binds to the promoter of various proinflammatory cytokine
  genes. Fyn is also upregulated to sustain the heightened inflammatory response during
  prolonged stimulation of microglia, possibly contributing to progressive neurodegeneration
  in PD.
