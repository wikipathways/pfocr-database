caption: ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in metabolic disorders. The color of the first
  arrow in each pathway indicates the mechanism (refer to Figure ) by which ADAR1
  regulates its direct targets, depicted in pink shapes. Additional activators of
  specific pathway steps are depicted in red rounded rectangles. Specific diseases
  and phenotypes/functions affected by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing are only labeled
  in the first appearance (ex. CVD). CVD, cardiovascular disease; SMC, smooth muscle
  cell. The figure was created with BioRender.
