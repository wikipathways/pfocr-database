caption: Relationships between neutral and anionic amino acid transporters and metabolism.
  The main amino acid-related metabolic fluxes in cancer cells, such as glycolysis
  (pink), glutaminolysis (green), nucleobase biosynthesis (red), hexosamine pathway
  (blue), glutathione biosynthesis (orange), and pentose–phosphate pathway (brown),
  are shown. Amino acids are depicted in rounded frames. Transporters that feed into
  these pathways are depicted as blue spheres and their names are shown in italics.
  Adaptive changes caused by GCN2 activation are shown as double arrows. Reduced flux
  of carbon from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is indicated by a dashed arrow. For more detailed
  depictions of transport mechanisms, see .
