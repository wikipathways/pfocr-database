caption: Glycosylation of MeSA negatively regulates plant systemic defense. At the
  site of primary infection (local tissue), the salicylic acid (SA) pathway is activated
  and SA (blue spheres) and MeSA (red spheres) levels increase. As a mobile signal,
  MeSA reaches the systemic tissue, where it is converted to salicylic acid. UGT71C3
  is up-regulated in response to the pathogen and MeSA accumulation, and in turn accelerates
  the glycosylation of MeSA. The Glc conjugates of MeSA glucoside (MeSA-glc [dark
  purple spheres]) are not active or mobile and affect the steady-state levels of
  free SA. Any MeSA that reaches the systemic tissue is further glycosylated by UGT71C3,
  thus preventing the accumulation of MeSA and competing with methyl esterase (MSE),
  which ensures its subsequent demethylation to form SA. The homeostasis of MeSA and
  SA is thus disrupted and the SA-dependent gene expression is attenuated, leading
  to defective defense. The reactions in the systemic tissue simulate a scenario where
  UGT71C3 acts as a defense switch-off strategy. The chemical structures and bioactive
  status are given for all three metabolites. BSMT1, Benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl
