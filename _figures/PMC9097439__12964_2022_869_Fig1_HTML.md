caption: Dietary fiber is digested by intestinal microorganisms to form short-chain
  fatty acids, which exert anti-inflammatory activities through the G protein-coupled
  receptor pathway and histone acetylase. The cytokines refer to interleukin 23, interleukin
  17 and interleukin beta, etc. They are produced by activation of innate and adaptive
  immunity after the microbiota is recognized by the immune system and are important
  contributors to the development of IBD. The Figures in this review were created
