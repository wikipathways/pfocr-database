caption: The virus engages the internalizing receptor Coxsackie-Adeno Receptor (CAR)
  whose tyrosine kinases Fyn and Abl can facilitate viral remodeling of cytoskeleton
  to gain entry, further aided by co-receptor decay accelerating factor (DAF), associated
  with tyrosine kinase p56lck. The viral components can interact with MDA5/RIG-I to
  activate NF-kB, or engage the cell surface toll-like receptors (TLR) through adaptor
  MyD88 and downstream signal intermediates such as IRAK-4 and TRAF6. These pathways
  facilitate viral proliferation and host immune tissue damage. On the other hand,
  activation of TRIF-IRF3/IRF7 pathway leading to type I interferon (IFN) production
  is protective. There is mutual counter-regulation of the MyD88 –IRAK4 and TRIF-IRF3
  pathways. The subsequent maturation of CD4+ / CD8+ T cell subsets is also detrimental
  for the host, in contrast to the T regulatory cells which are host-protective. Cross
  talk between acquired and innate immune signaling pathways modulate the host response
  to viral infection.
