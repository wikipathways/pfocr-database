caption: Hh pathway. (1) Canonical signaling. A. The production and secretion of Hh
  ligands/proteins. After translation, the precursor of the Hh protein is transported
  to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for autoclaved and dual-lipid modification. The
  first modification replaces the C-terminal domain from Hh-N with cholesterol at
  the C terminus; then, a palmitate molecule is attached to the N-terminal Hh-N by
  the Hh acyltransferase (Hhat). Disp1 on the cell surface and Scube2 regulates Hh-N
  secretion and distribution into the extracellular space of the producing cells.
  B. In the absence of the Hh ligands, Ptch functions to suppress any inactive Smo
  that is inside the cell and inhibits the migration of Smo to the membrane. Sufu
  restrains the GliFL protein in the cytoplasm, and GliFL is then phosphorylated at
  multiple sites in the C-terminal region by PKA, GSK3, and CK1. Next, the truncated
  GliR (Gli3) translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Hh target gene (target
  gene off). C. Ptch1 binds to the Hh ligand and releases the Smo that has been inhibited
  by Ptch. Active Smo induces the release of GliFL from cytoplasmic retention. The
  Hh–Ptch1 complex is then internalized and is degraded in the lysosomes. In the end,
  GliFL is converted to its active form GliA (Gli1 and Gli2) and migrates to the nucleus
  to activate several target genes (target gene on). Coreceptors for the Hh ligand
  pathway activate positive regulators (Gas1), negative regulators (Hhip), and dual
  functions (Glypican). (2) Non-canonical signaling. Type I, in the absence of Hh
  ligand, Ptch recruits complex proteins Dral, Tucan-1, and caspase-9 that followed
  by caspase-3 activation, which further amplifies cell apoptosis. The binding of
  Hh ligand to Ptch disorganizes the interaction of Cyclin B1 and the proapoptotic
  complex, leading to increased proliferation and survival. Type II, activation of
  Smo leads to dissociation of Gi, activation of PI3K and RhoA and Rac1, which then
  modulate the actin cytoskeleton and induce elevation of intracellular calcium.
