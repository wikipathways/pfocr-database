caption: In addition, activation of the TGF-β canonical pathway can induce transcriptional
  regulation of Snail1 and Twist1 target genes, resulting in increased contractility
  of CAFs. Activation of both pathways leads to an altered ECM environment that enhances
  cell migration and invasion of cancer cells.
