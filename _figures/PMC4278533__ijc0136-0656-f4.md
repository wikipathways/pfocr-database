caption: Gene set variation analysis of the antigen processing and presentation pathway
  (APP) and the natural killer (NK) cell gene set. (a) The APP from KEGG. Overlapping
  core genes driving the observed association of the APP with the presence of BC within
  CC1 and CC2 are colored according to their over- (red) or under- (green) expression
  in BC patients. (b) Boxplot indicating the enrichment scores from gene set variation
  analysis for the NK cell gene set associated with the gene expression profiles from
  BC patients (red) and controls (pink) included in CC1, CC2 and CC3 (left). List
  of genes included in the NK gene set significantly associated to disease status
  in paired linear analysis with FDR < 0.10 in at least two of the three datasets
  and their corresponding median fold-changes over all datasets (right). [Color figure
