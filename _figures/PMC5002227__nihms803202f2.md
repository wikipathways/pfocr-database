caption: 'Left panel: Palmitoyl-LIMK1 on the dendritic spine membrane is phosphorylated
  and activated via a pathway that involves membrane-bound upstream activators such
  as Rac, Cdc42 (which is also palmitoylated) and PAK. In contrast, any non-palmitoylated
  LIMK1 in the spine ‘core’ remains inactive. This palmitoylation-dependent control
  of LIMK1 localization and activity may facilitate juxtamembrane phosphorylation
  and inactivation of cofilin, thus allowing spine-specific, and perhaps even sub-spine,
  control of actin dynamics. Right panel: Elevated synaptic activity triggers Rac/Cdc42/PAK
  activation and recruitment of additional cofilin to spines (, ). Both these events
  are required for activity-dependent spine enlargement, which also depends on palmitoyl-LIMK1
  (). Control of sub-spine actin polymerization by this signaling pathway may provide
  the force required for the enlargement of specific spines that is frequently observed
  during LTP.'
