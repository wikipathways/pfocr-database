caption: Model depicting the dual role of cGKI in BMP signalling pathway cGKI regulates
  BMP signalling through (light blue) modulation of BMP receptors at the cell surface
  and enhancement of R-Smad phosphorylation and thus Smad activation. After BMP-2-induced
  association with activated Smad complexes and shuttling into the nucleus, cGKI (dark
  blue) further controls Smad-mediated transcriptional activation as a nuclear co-factor
  for Smads, which at least recruits TFII-I. For details, see text.
