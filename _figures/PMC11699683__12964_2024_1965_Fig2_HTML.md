caption: Role of UA in antioxidative stress and anti-inflammation. UA plays a vital
  role in antioxidative stress and anti-inflammation. Its antioxidant properties involve
  scavenging singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, hydroxyl peroxide, and peroxynitrite.
  Soluble UA and MSU impact monocytes through various signaling pathways such as NF-κB/NLRP3
  and SLC2A9/GLUT9, influencing the expression of inflammatory factors. Monocytes
  uptake soluble UA intracellularly via SLC2A9/GLUT9. This intracellular presence
  of soluble UA inhibits MSU crystal-induced monocyte activation and suppresses the
  monocyte TLR signaling pathway. MSU, monosodium urate; ONOO−, peroxynitrite; NLRP3,
  nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3; TLR2/4, Toll-like
  receptor 2/4; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells;
  IL, interleukin
