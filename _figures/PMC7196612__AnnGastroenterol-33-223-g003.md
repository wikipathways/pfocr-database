caption: Virulence factors of Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum. (A) F. nucleatum has virulence
  factors, FadA, LPS and Fap2. (B) FadA binds E-cadherin, resulting in Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling and tumorigenesis, as well as activation of NF-κB and production of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Annexin A1, upregulated in colorectal cells, complexes with FadA and
  E-cadherin to further accelerate this pathway. (C) Fap2 interacts with the TIGIT
  receptor on NK and T-cells, inhibiting their ability to attack tumor cells. (D)
  Fap2 also binds to the Gal-GalNac polysaccharide expressed by tumor cells, which
  localized the F. nucleatum to tumor cells. (E) Binding of LPS to TRL-4 results in
  modulation of mi-RNA expression, in particular miR-18a and miR-4802, thereby disrupting
  autophagy Created with BioRender.comLPS, Lipopolysaccharide; Fap2, Fusobacterium
