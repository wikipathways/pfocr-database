caption: Links between the DNA damage response, autophagy, and senescence in response
  to G-quadruplex ligands. The G-quadruplex ligand 20A causes global DNA Damage that
  results in the activation of the DNA Damage Response pathways (DDR). (a) In particular,
  the activation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) leads to the induction of
  autophagy which, in turn, controls DDR by regulating Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1).
  The ATM/autophagy axis is responsible for the induction of senescence and the protection
  of cells against death. (b) Conversely, disruption of either ATM or autophagy following
  20A treatment impairs the induction of senescence and drives cells to apoptotic
  cell death highlighting the potential therapeutic interest of targeting this pathway
  to achieve the optimal efficacy of the G-quadruplex ligand 20A.
