caption: Schematic diagram of the pathways activated by HDL in skeletal muscle that
  modulate glucose metabolism. Both human and rodent studies have demonstrated that
  HDL can increase glucose uptake through an ABCA1/AMPK-dependent mechanism (). Chronically
  elevating HDL levels pharmacologically or via genetic approaches in mice increases
  Akt phosphorylation, suggesting activation of an additional signaling pathway ().
  There is also more recent evidence in mouse muscle cells showing that HDL can directly
  stimulate anaerobic glycolysis and glucose oxidation.
