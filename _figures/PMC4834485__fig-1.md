caption: Signaling pathways in serum-free on feeder culture systems. BSA acts as a
  nutrient for MEFs. MEFs secrete heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), fibronectin,
  TGF-β, IGF1, and IGF2. HSA acts as a nutrient for hiPSCs. Albumin in the culture
  medium promotes expression of collagen I, collagen IV, and HSPG that detoxify β-mercaptoethanol.
  Collagen I binds to α2β1 integrin and transduces Ras function to activate PI3K binding
  to AKT; activation of the latter pathway promotes self-renewal in hiPSCs. Collagen
  IV binds to α2β1 integrin and transduces a RhoGAP function to activate PI3K binding
  to AKT; activation of the latter pathway promotes cell growth in hiPSCs. With regard
  to downstream functions in the IGF1R and ALK5 pathways of hiPSCs, activation induces
  E-cadherin transcription that recruits the PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK. This suggests
  that both PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling are required for insulin- and TGF-β-induced
  E-cadherin upregulation on the cell membrane. Glucose promotes fibronectin and TGF-β
  manifestation through c-Jun signaling. TGF-β is activated by αVβ6 integrin. The
  pathways that IGF1R and ALK5 activate through unidentified growth factors, which
  are present in the culture medium for hiPSCs, are sufficient to maintain pluripotency
  in hiPSCs. Transferrin regulates cellular iron uptake and, thus, is an essential
  culture medium ingredient. Selenium is a component of some glutathione peroxidases;
  these enzymes prevent oxidative damage in cells by inducing the reduction of lipid
  hydroperoxides. With regard to downstream functions in the FGFR and ALK4 pathways
  of hiPSCs, the induction of α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 integrin transcription requires
  the FGF2-FGFR signal pathway and is reinforced by ALK4-activin A signal pathway.
  Collagen I and HSPG concentrate on FGF2 in the vicinity of FGFR to activate laminin-332,
  -511, -521, and collagen IV transcription through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  Fibronectin is secreted by hiPSCs and binds with α8β1 integrin to promote cell survival
  of hiPSCs through PI3K/AKT signaling. In addition, fibronectin can also bind to
  αVβ1 integrin and α5β1 integrin to promote secretion of laminin-332, -511, -521,
  and collagen IV from hiPSCs. The pathways activated by fibronectin-integrin signaling
  are responsible for the secretion of ECM, which maintains pluripotency of hiPSCs.
