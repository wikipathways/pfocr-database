caption: Components of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR chaperone, BiP,
  is recruited to misfolded proteins, resulting in activation of three key ER stress
  mediators, IRE-1, ATF6, and PERK. Activated IRE-1 results in splicing of the mRNA
  encoding XBP-1, producing a mature transcription factor that translocates to the
  nucleus and upregulates expression of molecular chaperones. Activated ATF6 is transported
  to the Golgi, where it is cleaved to produce a mature transcription factor that
  also upregulates chaperone expression. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which
  transiently decreases global protein synthesis to ease the burden in the ER. TorsinA
  is believed to function at some level in this cascade, while torsinAΔE may impair
  the cell's ability to respond to misfolded proteins. PACT responds to cytosolic
  and ER stresses to activate PKR, which also phosphorylates eiF2α to decrease protein
  synthesis. Mutations in PACT which prevent PKR activation would also impair the
  cell's ability to respond to ER and other stress stimuli. PKR is normally inhibited
  by p58IPK (p58), although this inhibition is removed during stress signaling by
  THAP0, a close relative of THAP1. It is not yet known whether THAP1 itself participates
  directly in the p58IPK/PKR pathway.
