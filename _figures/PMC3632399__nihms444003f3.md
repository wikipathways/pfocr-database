caption: Oncogenic RAS may have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions depending
  on the status of RAS effector pathways and the apoptotic machinery. In many cases
  oncogenic RAS signalling through the RAF pathway engages an apoptotic response that
  is mediated by p53. Also, signalling through the RAS effectors RASSF1, NORE1, mammalian
  STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1) and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) can lead to apoptotic
  death via the activation of caspase 3 and the pro-apoptotic proteins BCL-2-associated
  X protein (BAX) and BCL-2-homologous antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1). Acquisition of
  a tumorigenic phenotype is marked by the suppression of such mediators of RAS-induced
  apoptosis. In this context, the anti-apoptotic activity of RAS takes a stronghold.
  The anti-apoptotic function of oncogenic RAS is mediated by several effector pathways,
  including the RAS–PI3K effector pathway, which regulates the levels of pro-apoptotic
  protein BAK1 and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), and the RAS–RAF pathway, which
  downregulates the pro-apoptotic transcriptional repressor prostate apoptosis response
  4 (PAR4) while upregulating the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and apoptosis repressor
  with caspase recruitment domain (ARC). Both pathways have been implicated in phosphorylating
  and inactivating the pro-apoptotic protein BCL-2-associated agonist of cell death
  (BAD). The mechanism through which RAS induces the epigenetic silencing of the pro-apoptotic
  CD95 gene remains to be uncovered. The asterisk represents the mutational activation
  of RAS protein. P, phosphorylation.
