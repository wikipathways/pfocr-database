caption: 'Integrated view of translesion synthesis (TLS) pathways. Step 1: the replicative
  DNA polymerase dissociates from the primer template after encountering noncoding
  template base. Step 2: vacant primer template becomes the substrate for binding
  by specialized DNA polymerases; there appears to be no active selection process
  for the binding of a specific polymerase; i.e., binding is stochastic and follows
  classical mass-action laws. Step 3: a successful specialized polymerase is one that
  can synthesize a patch long enough to resist proofreading (TLS patch in dotted red)
  in a single binding event. Interaction of TLS polymerase with the β-clamp left behind
  on the template following dissociation of replicative DNA polymerase is essential
  to confer limited processivity to TLS polymerase that are otherwise highly distributive.
  For all three SOS polymerases (Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V), mutations that inactivate
  the β-clamp binding motif abrogate their TLS activity in vivo (). Step 4: following
  dissociation of the TLS polymerase, the “TLS patch” is extended after reloading
  of the replicative polymerase, leading to complete TLS (Step 5). If the TLS patch
  is too short, the proofreading activity of the replicative DNA polymerase may abort
  the TLS pathway back to step 1. The balance between exonucleolytic degradation and
  polymerization by the replicative DNA polymerase is modulated by the dNTP pool size
  (). Increased dNTP pools arising because of genotoxic stress favor elongation over
  proofreading. Recently, deep sequencing of numerous Pol V-mediated TLS events have
  revealed the fine structure of the post replicative gap-filling process in vivo
  (). Pol V synthesis was tracked by an increase in mutation events and, unexpectedly,
  revealed that after completing the canonical TLS reaction, Pol V reaccessed the
  undamaged DNA template downstream from the lesion to synthesize other patch(es)
  of low fidelity DNA synthesis [referred to as error-prone post-TLS patch(es)] over
  a distance of up to 400 nt downstream of the lesion.'
