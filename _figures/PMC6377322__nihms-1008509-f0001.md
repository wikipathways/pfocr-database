caption: 'Legend: Poor cardiac output in heart failure results in intestinal ischemia,
  edema, and inflammation which leads to a “leaky” intestinal barrier. This allows
  for increased passage of inflammatory bacterial products to enter the bloodstream
  causing chronic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, this alters the intestinal
  environment and impacts both the normal microbial community which resides in the
  gut and subsequently, the metabolic products from these bacteria. The metabolic
  pathways include fermentation of indigestible fiber to short chain fatty acids which
  have protective properties reducing inflammation and improving vascular tone. Dietary
  sources including choline, phosphatidylcholine, l-carnitine and other methylamine-containing
  nutrients provide substrates for microbiota mediated production of trimethylamine
  (TMA). TMA then enters the portal circulation and is converted by the hepatic host
  flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) family of enzymes to trimethylamine n-oxide
  (TMAO). TMAO can promote the development of atherogenesis, thrombosis, kidney disease,
  and heart failure. Additionally, the bacterial transformation of bile acids can
  result in altered bile acid profiles which then can affect systemic inflammatory
  and fibrotic processes. Collectively, these processes can influence the individual
  susceptibility, severity of heart failure.'
