caption: cGAS-STING pathway apart from being active in cancer cells, can also be activated
  in other cells in the tumor microenvironment through paracrine mechanisms. These
  include transfer of dsDNA or cGAMP from tumor cells to host cells. cGAMP can be
  transferred from the tumor cells via exosomes or through gap junctions to the adjacent
  bystander cells, or directly exported to the extracellular space through a yet-uncharacterized
  transporter, where it can be taken up by other cell types such as antigen presenting
  cells through the SLC19A1 folate transporter. Paracrine cGAS-STING activation can
  lead to type 1 IFN production which in turn is critical for the infiltration and
  activation of NK Cell and CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. However the
  same phenomenon was also found to promote brain metastasis through a yet-to-be-elucidated
  mechanism.
