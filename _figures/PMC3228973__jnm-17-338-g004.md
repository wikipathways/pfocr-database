caption: Proposed signal transduction pathways in nodose ganglia following receptor
  activation with leptin and cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8). There are 2 potential pathways
  for phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
  Leptin activates Janus kinase-2 phosphorylation at tyrosine 1138, which directly
  phosphorylates STAT3, or leptin activates phophoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) via the
  insulin receptor substrate, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation. CCK-8 activates PI3K
  via SRC and RhoA, which leads to phosphorylation of STAT3, suggesting that PI3K
  is central to the synergistic leptin/CCK STAT3 phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on leptin and CCK-8 synergism,
  suggesting that the leptin/CCK-8-stimulated MAPK/ extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 pathway was not involved in STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 usually acts
  by stimulating the transcription of target genes, but the rapid electrophysiological
  effects suggest STAT3 may be involved in modifying the activity of K+ channels.
