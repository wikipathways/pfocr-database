caption: The canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Binding of TNFα trimers to TNFR receptors
  initiates the canonical signaling pathway by activating the upstream kinase IKK.
  IKK phosphorylates the IκB inhibitor that is bound to NF-κB in the resting state.
  This targets IκB proteins for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which leads to IκB
  destruction by the 26S proteasome and release of NF-κB. Free NF-κB enters the nucleus
  and activates gene expression of many target genes and induces negative feedback
  regulation by synthesizing IκB and A20. IκB proteins inhibit NF-κB activity by sequestering
  NF-κB from the nucleus to form an inner feedback loop, while A20 attenuates stimulus
  induced IKK kinase activation further upstream in an outer negative feedback loop.
