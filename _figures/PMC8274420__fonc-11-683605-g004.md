caption: Graphical presentation of the various cellular cascades implicated in hTERT
  expression, telomerase activity, and telomere length. During transcription of hTERT
  gene, positive regulation is exerted via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  1/2, and the JAK/STAT pathways primarily on hTERT’s promoter. Another step of positive
  regulation is found during the translation and post translation phase of hTERT mRNA
  since the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is described to regulate hTERT mRNA translation,
  while the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway seems to be involved post-translationally via direct
  phosphorylation of hTERT by AKT and HIF-1α. RAS, rat sarcoma; RAF, rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma; MEK also known as MAP2K, MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase;
  ERK, also known as MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PKB, also known as Akt, protein kinase B; Mtor, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin kinase; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. Created with BioRender.com.
