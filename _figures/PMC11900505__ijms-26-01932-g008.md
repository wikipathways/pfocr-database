caption: Molecular signaling pathway underlying the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  effects of SME in LPS-stimulated microglial cells. LPS and other stressors induce
  neuroinflammation by activating the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [87,88,89].
  This study demonstrated that SME exerted its antioxidant effects by activating the
  Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In contrast, its anti-inflammatory effect was achieved
  by inhibiting the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells.
  Additionally, treatment with SnPP, a specific HO-1 inhibitor, reversed the suppression
  of inflammatory mediators such as NO and proinflammatory cytokine in LPS-stimulated
  BV2 cells. Notably, when SnPP inhibited HO-1 expression in the LPS-stimulated cells,
  SME treatment failed to inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation in these cells. In summary,
  SME exhibited both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on the LPS-activated
  microglial cells, with its antioxidant effect partially contributing to its anti-inflammatory
  activity
