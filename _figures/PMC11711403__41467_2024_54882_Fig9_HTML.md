caption: Upon viral infection, PBLD interacts with TRIM21, thereby blocking the degradation
  effect of TRIM21 on phosphorylated IKKβ, promoting IKKs complex activation, and
  ultimately activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and enhancing the IFN-I-mediated
  antiviral defense. Furthermore, Cedrelone effectively promotes antiviral IFN-I immune
  response by increasing the PBLD protein expression and activating the NF-κB pathway
