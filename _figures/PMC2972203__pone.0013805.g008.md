caption: Among the most prominent responses was activation of MAP kinases (p38, JNK
  and ERK) and the downstream transcriptional factors [STAT1 (Y701), ATF2 (T69–71),
  MSK1 (S360), and CREB (S133)]. STAT3 and NF-κB phosphorylation were also increased.
  Activation of p53(S15, S46), which typically accompanies transcriptional upregulation
  of the apoptotic genes correlated with the increased levels of cleaved effector
  caspase-3, -6 and -7 indicating activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. RVFV
  infection also downregulated phosphorylation of a major anti-apoptotic regulator
  of survival pathways, AKT (S473). Consistent with this, the level of apoptosis inhibitor
  XIAP100 was decreased. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway marker, caspase-9, demonstrated
  only a marginal activation accompanied by increased level of the inhibitor of apoptosome
  formation, HSP27.
