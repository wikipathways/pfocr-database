caption: The enzymatic pathway of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB)
  cycle as characterized in Metallosphaera sedula. Enzyme names are contained within
  the yellow oval with arrows indicating reactions for which they have known catalytic
  activity. Enzymes in pink have shown activity for only a single reaction in the
  3-HP/4-HB cycle; enzymes in green exhibit activity on multiple steps in the cycle.
