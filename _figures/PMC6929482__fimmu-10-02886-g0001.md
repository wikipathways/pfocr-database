caption: 'The antimicrobial mechanism of the vagina during pregnancy. The mechanism
  mainly consists of the following three parts: (1) The first barriers: tight junctions
  of epithelial cells, movement of microvilli, and the package of mucus, as well as
  natural antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells; (2) Exclusive effect of Lactobacillus
  on other pernicious biota: lactic acid, acidolin, lactacin, H2O2; (3) The pathway
  including innate immune cells in the vagina, innate immune response, and acquired
  immune response. To be exact, antigen-derived cells, which make a sense by innate
  immunity, present pathogen antigens to acquired immune cells to kill, and crack
  pathogens.'
