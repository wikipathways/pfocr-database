caption: A Model of the mechanism through which WTAP regulates SMC proliferation.
  The balance between WTAP and WT1 influences the state of SMCs. When the expression
  of WTAP is reduced, WT1-mediated transcriptional events proceed. Amphiregulin is
  a direct transcriptional target of WT1 that drives SMC proliferation by upregulating
  the EGF pathway. Thus, SMCs switch to a proliferative state. When the balance of
  WTAP and WT1 is reversed, WT1-mediated transcription may be blocked, and the transcription
  of Bcl-2, which is suppressed by WT1, is activated. SMC apoptosis is increased,
  and the cells switch to a nonproliferative state. B WTAP in the antiviral immune
  response. WTAP is degraded in virus-infected cells. After viral infection, degradation
  of WTAP leads to a decrease in the m6A level of IRF3 mRNA and IFNAR1 mRNA, which
  leads to IRF3 mRNA translation blockade and accelerated IFNAR1 mRNA degradation.
  This biological process restricts the antiviral immune response and maintains homeostasis.
