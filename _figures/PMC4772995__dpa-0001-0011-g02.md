caption: 'The illustration of genes in a pathway associated with dermatological diseases
  and conditions, immunological disease and inflammatory disease (table ) (filter
  set to p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction) in vitiligo patients compared
  to controls. Gene expression profiles were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software and based on the differential expression of these genes, the most relevant
  biochemical network with functional links is found. Green: decreased expression
  level in patients vs. controls; red: increased expression level; gray: similar expression
  level; white: no associations between vitiligo and the gene were found. The numbers
  reflect the t value of the statistical comparison with the Bayes moderated t test.
  The figure was generated through the use of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA,
