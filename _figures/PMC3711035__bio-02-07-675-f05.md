caption: Wnt7a/Fzd9 signaling leads to induction hsa-miR29b, which is mediated by
  ERK5 and PPARγ. The hsa-miR29b expression targets MDM2 mRNA to degradation, which
  results in increased p53 levels and reduced cell proliferation. In NSCLC, on the
  contrary, absence of Wnt7a fails to activate Wnt7a/Fzd9 pathway, which blocks induction
  of hsa-miR29b expression. Loss in hsa-miR29b expression results in increased MDM2
  levels reduced p53 expression and increased cell proliferation.
papertitle: hsa-miR29b, a critical downstream target of non-canonical Wnt signaling,
  plays an anti-proliferative role in non-small cell lung cancer cells via targeting
  MDM2 expression.
