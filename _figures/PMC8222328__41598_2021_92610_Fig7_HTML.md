caption: Gene regulatory networks produced by triple-gene mutual interaction (TGMI)
  (A) and sparse partial least squares (SPLS) (B) for Arabidopsis thaliana light reaction
  pathway using the RNA-seq data generated from leaf tissues. The yellow nodes represent
  light reaction pathway genes. All other nodes are the top 50 transcription factors
  that have the highest connectivity to pathway genes regardless of their colors.
  The red nodes represent known positive regulatory genes that affect light reaction
  pathway while the red edges are to show the connections of a true positive known
  pathway regulator with pathway genes.
