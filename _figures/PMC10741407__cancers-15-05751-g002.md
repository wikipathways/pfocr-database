caption: 'How target therapy works: (a) MAPK pathway normal signaling: The BRAF and
  MEK pathways initiate signaling through the extracellular RTK domain. RAS family
  members are activated through an RTK ligand domain, and the activation of RAS proteins
  binds BRAF isoforms, leading to the activation of BRAF, followed by MEK, and the
  final step of phosphorylation of ERK. The net effect leads to increased cell survival
  and decreased apoptosis. (b) BRAF or N-RAS mutant pathway: In the presence of an
  activating BRAFV600E mutation, BRAF no longer requires dimerization with RAS, and
  therefore remains constitutively active, similar to NRAS mutations, keeping this
  pathway constitutively activated and leading to enhanced tumor cell proliferation
  with apoptosis abrogation. (c) Inhibition of the BRAF or N-RAS mutant pathway: The
  targeted therapy inhibits mutant BRAF or MEK, thereby stopping the downstream activation
  of the MAPK pathway, decreasing cellular proliferation, and inducing apoptosis.
  (d) N-RAS: The N-RAS mutation turns the protein that is constantly activated (GTP
  bound) and irresponsive to the GTP exchange factor. Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BRAF, rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma B type; RAS, rat sarcoma virus; and RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases'
