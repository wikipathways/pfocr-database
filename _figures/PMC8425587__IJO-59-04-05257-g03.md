caption: Molecular mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 in regulating hematological malignancy.
  The presence of TNF-α, del(5q) and miR-146a deletions may lead to the sustained
  expression of SQSTM1/p62. By interacting with TRAF-6, RIP1 and αPKCs via its TB,
  ZZ and PB1 domains, respectively, SQSTM1/p62 may activate the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  which in turn promotes SQSTM1/p62 expression. ATRA may also trigger the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, thereby forming a positive feedback loop with SQSTM1/p62 and NF-κB. By
  interacting with p38MAPK via the P38 domain, SQSTM1/p62 can function in conjunction
  with the activated autophagy/ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as triggered by the interaction
  between SQSTM1/p62 and KLF4 through the SQSTM1/p62 UBA domain, and SQSTM1/p62 can
  ultimately promote cell proliferation, malignant transformation and drug resistance.
  By contrast, SQSTM1/p62 may function as a tumor suppressor by driving the oncogene
  BCR-ABL into autophagosomes, and it is degraded by cathepsin B in autolysosomes.
