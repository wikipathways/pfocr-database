caption: The interactions between chronic inflammatory pathways, MetS, and various
  skin diseases. These interactions are primarily influenced by dietary habits, immune
  responses, IR, and metabolic complications. High consumption of sugar, carbohydrates,
  and dairy activates the PI3K/AKT and mTORC1 pathways, leading to gut microbiota
  dysbiosis, particularly affecting Akkermansia muciniphila. Th17 and Th1 cell activation
  increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-22, IL-17, IFN-γ,
  and IL-2/4/6/10), worsening psoriasis through the JAK-STAT and NF-κB pathways, which
  inhibit apoptosis and promote angiogenesis. NF-κB activation leads to IR, higher
  insulin and C-peptide levels, and increased androgen levels, intensifying sebaceous
  gland activity and promoting acne. Obesity is associated with Th1/Th22 cell activation
  and elevated IL-3/4 levels, resulting in adipokine changes (abnormal adiponectin
  and elevated resistin) and endothelial inflammation (McP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1),
  indicating autoimmune dysfunction. Dysregulated lipid production promotes Cutibacterium
  acnes colonization, exacerbating acne. Enhanced IGF-1 and increased EGF and TGF-β2
  levels cause excessive cell differentiation and proliferation, contributing to psoriasis
  and SLE. Oxidative stress damages intracellular proteins and DNA, increasing the
  risk of autoimmune disorders, including vitiligo and SLE. CVD risk is elevated because
  of TLR4/JNK/MAPK pathway activation, increasing TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction leads to diabetes, with lipid ROS causing further cellular damage. This
  overview highlights the complex relationship between diet, immune response, MetS,
  and skin diseases, providing a foundation for future research and targeted therapeutic
  strategies
