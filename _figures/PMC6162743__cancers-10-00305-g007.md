caption: Prx II regulates CSC properties of colorectal cancers via PI3K/AKT, Hedgehog
  and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. (A) Induced PI3K/AKT signaling by overexpressed Prx
  II in colorectal cancer cells to increase cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis.
  (B) Prx II-mediated overactivation of Hedgehog pathway by increasing the expressions
  of PTC, SMO and Gli zinc finger transcription factors to promote stemness-associated
  properties. (C) Activation of Wnt pathway by overexpressed Prx II. Wnt signaling
  induces translocation of β-Catenin to nucleus by activated Dishevelled and inactivated
  GSK-3β activities. Translocated β-Catenin induces the transcription of LEF/TCF complex
  target genes such as survivin and c-Myc. Activation of these genes and deactivation
  of degradation signals maintains the stemness-associated properties of colorectal
  cancers.
