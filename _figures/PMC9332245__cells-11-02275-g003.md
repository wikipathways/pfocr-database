caption: 'FHB-resistant signaling pathways in fungus–plant interactions. There are
  three resistant pathways: first, the detoxification pathway, in which the members
  of (UDP)-glucose transferase TaUGT1~6 can enhance plant tolerance to FHB by converting
  the fungal mycotoxin DON to the less toxic DON-3-O-glucoside, D3G (❶). In addition,
  another gene, Fhb7, encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST), from a distant variety
  of wheat, Elytrigia elongata, confers broad resistance and tolerance to Fusarium
  species by detoxifying trichothecenes, such as NIV, through conjugating GSH to the
  epoxy group of NIV. Second are CERK1-mediated metabolic pathways to thicken the
  plant walls. It is well known that the first layer of innate immunity in plants
  is initiated by the surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), in which
  the leading role is played by chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1), which mainly
  participates in chitin-induced immunity []. Meanwhile, chitin is a typical component
  of the fungal cell wall and can trigger the plant innate immune response by activating
  PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). Here, a transcription factor, HvWRKY23,
  can be induced by HvCERK1 with some unclear methods upon infection with Fg. HvWRKY23
  subsequently regulates downstream genes, such as HvPAL2, HvCHS1, HvHCT, HvLAC15,
  and HvUDPGT, to biosynthesize HCAAs, flavonoid glycosides, lignin, and so on, which
  reinforces the cell walls to contain the spread of Fg in plant cells. Similarly,
  TaWRKY70 was also identified as having a potential role against Fg in the early
  stages of defense through physically interacing with and activating the downstream
  genes TaACT, TaDGK, and TaGLI, among which TaACT is the rate-limiting enzyme in
  the biosynthesis of HCAAs and TaDGK and TaGLI are the crucial enzymes in the biosynthesis
  of PAs (phosphatidic acids) in plants []. Moreover, HCAAs and PAs have functions
  during fungus–plant interactions; PAs contribute to the plant defense response through
  translocation and catabolism in the apoplast, leading to the production of H2O2,
  which has several roles, such as directly eliminating pathogens and assisting in
  cell wall strengthening; HCAAs were identified as biomarkers during fungus–plant
  interactions and support a functional role in plant defense []. What is more, a
  guanidine cinnamyl transferase gene, TaACT, was confirmed as having a role involved
  in FHB response in plants []; another potential downstream gene, TaLAC4, encoding
  a wheat laccase, was also reported to restrain FHB infestation by promoting the
  synthesis of lignin in the secondary cell wall of plants in order to thicken the
  cell wall []. Therefore, this indicated that a signaling pathway of WRKY-mediated
  RRI metabolite accumulation in cells perhaps plays an important role in the plant
  response to FHB stress (❷). The second is an energy-related metabolic pathway. It
  is known that many pathogens have acquired the ability to inject virulence effector
  proteins into host cells to achieve more effective infection. As shown in ❸, FHB-causing
  fungi secrete a virulence effector protein, Osp24 (an orphan protein), which promotes
  mycelium growth and toxin accumulation in plant cells. At the same time, Osp24 can
  combine with TaSnRK1α, a FHB-resistant protein, resulting in TaSnRK1α being ubiquitinated
  and degraded. There is always an arms race between the pathogen and its host. For
  plants, the second layer of immune recognition is intracellular immune receptor
  forms, and the intracellular immune receptors are most often the nucleotide-binding
  proteins, which can recognize those effectors and elicit a second layer of defense.
  From this, it is not difficult to speculate that the N-acetylcysteine-like transcription
  factors, TaNACs (TaNACL-D1/TaNAC032), as the intracellular immune receptors, perhaps
  can recognize Osp24 or its analogs, and then are activated by them. Subsequently,
  the activated TaNACs regulate the expresion of the downstream gene TaFROG, which
  encodes a wheat orphan protein (an analog of Osp24). Thus, TaFROG can compete against
  Osp24 to combine with TaSnRK1α, preventing TaSnRK1α from being ubiquitinated and
  increasing plant resistance to FHB. However, the resistance mechanism of TaSnRK1α
  to FHB in plants still remains unclear. In addition, Han et al. found that SnRK1
  interacts with and phosphorylates WRKY3 repressor in barley, leading to the degradation
  of WRKY3 and enhanced barley immunity []. Consequently, there may be molecular crosstalk
  between pathway ❷ and ❸ mediated by phosphorylation. PLD: phenylpropanoid; HCAAs:
  hydroxycinnamic acid amides; PAs: phosphatidic acids; TaACT: agmatinecoumaroyl transferase;
  TaDGK: diacylglycerol kinase; TaGLI: glycerol kinase.'
