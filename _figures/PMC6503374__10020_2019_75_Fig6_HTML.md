caption: Molecular mechanism map of SAA1 involved in insulin resistance by activating
  the NF-κB pathway. SAA1 mediates PA- or HFD-induced insulin resistance though the
  activation of the NF-κB pathway. In PA-or HFD-induced insulin resistance models,
  up-regulation of SAA1 could inhibit the activation of IRS1 signaling by activating
  the NF-κB pathway, which contributes to insulin resistance. The silencing of SAA1
  or treatment with BAY 11–7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) can relieve PA- or HFD-induced insulin
  resistance by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and IRS1 signaling. SAA1, serum
  amyloid A protein 1; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  PA, palmitate; HFD, high-fat diet
papertitle: Silencing of SAA1 inhibits palmitate- or high-fat diet induced insulin
  resistance through suppression of the NF-κB pathway.
