caption: Molecular mechanism of NR4A1 implicated in the hepatic I/R injury. NR4A1,
  highly expressed in hepatic I/R injury, elevates CYR61 expression and activates
  the NF‐κB signalling pathway. Afterwards, NF‐κB p65 binds to the TGFβ1 promoter
  to activate TGFβ1 transcription, thus eventually exacerbating hepatic I/R injury
