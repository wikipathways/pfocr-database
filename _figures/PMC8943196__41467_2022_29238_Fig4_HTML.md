caption: a Visual representation of the biosynthesis pathway from tryptophan to staurosporine
  (obtained from KEGG, steps numbered in bold black) has been expanded for one generation
  around the native intermediates. b The molecular structure of staurosporine. c Network
  of potential staurosporine biochemistry expanded four generations around the target
  compound. The size of each compound nodes decreases with each generation. When no
  compound is indicated, the LCSB compound ID is provided.
