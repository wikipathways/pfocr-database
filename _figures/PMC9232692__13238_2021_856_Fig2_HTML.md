caption: U2-dependent (major) spliceosome versus U12-dependent (minor) spliceosome.
  (A) The main determinants for distinguishing U2- and U12-type introns are the 5′
  splice site (5′SS) and branch point sequence (BPS). U12-type introns are subdivided
  into AT-AC or GT-AG minor introns based on their terminal dinucleotides. (B) U2-
  and U12-type introns are recognized differently by their respective spliceosomes.
  U2-type introns are initially recognized by the U1 snRNP binding to the 5′SS, splicing
  factor 1 (SF1) binding to the BPS and U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF2/1) heterodimer
  binding to the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) and 3′SS, respectively. Subsequently,
  the U2 snRNA associates with the BPS and displaces SF1, converting the E complex
  to A complex. In contrast to the U2-type introns, the 5′SS and BPS of U12-type introns
  are recognized cooperatively by the U11 and U12 snRNAs of the di-snRNP, respectively,
  thereby forming the U12-type A complex. The following steps in the splicing process
  are similar between the U2- and U12-dependent pathway, and lead to similar catalytic
  structures and catalytic reactions of splicing
