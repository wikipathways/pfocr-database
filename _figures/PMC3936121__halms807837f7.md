caption: 'Left panel: MUC4-dependent mechanisms involving either decrease of hCNT1
  nucleoside transporter expression via the NF-κB pathway or modification of the Bax/BclXL
  ratio (up-regulation of BclXL and down-regulation of Bax expression). Right panel:
  MUC4-independent mechanisms. MRP4 channel increases cell sensitivity to gemcitabine
  by an unknown mechanism while MRP3 is not involved. MRP5 is known to decrease cell
  sensitivity to gemcitabine as well as modification of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)
  and ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1/2) (, , ).'
