caption: 'The role of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in RTEC death during IRI-induced
  AKI. The hypoxic conditions and proinflammatory cytokines released into the intrarenal
  environment, following the ischemic phase of IRI, induce IDO1 expression and KYN
  synthesis with simultaneous depletion of TRP in RTECs. The reduction of TRP in the
  microenvironment results in activation of GCN2K and apoptosis-mediated death of
  RTECs. After reoxygenation, IDO1-dependent activation of the kynurenine pathway
  in addition to the production of KYN and KYNA activates AhR, which triggers ROS
  generation, leading to AhR-mediated ferroptosis of RTECs. Abbreviations: RTECs—renal
  tubular epithelial cells; IRI—ischemia-reperfusion injury; TNF-α—tumour necrosis
  factor alpha; IFN-γ—interferon gamma; HIF-1α—hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha; TRP—tryptophan;
  KYN—kynurenine; KYNA—kynurenic acid; GCN2K—general control nonderepressible 2 kinase;
  ROS—reactive oxygen species; AhR—aryl hydrocarbon receptor.'
