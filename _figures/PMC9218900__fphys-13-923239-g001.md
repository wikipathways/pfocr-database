caption: The most common causes of AKI include sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion, and nephrotoxic
  drug injury. It is involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes, of which
  inflammatory response is one of the most important pathological features. When AKI
  occurs, the damaged renal tubular epithelial cells increase the permeability of
  vascular endothelial cells by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas activated
  renal tubular epithelial cells and dendritic cells secrete chemokines such as CCL10
  and CXCL1, followed by a large number of immune effector cells into circulation.
  These include neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, which are recruited to the site
  of injury. The resident and recruited immune cells simultaneously secrete pro-inflammatory
  mediators such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-1β, and the induced inflammatory cascade
  further aggravates the damage of renal tubular epithelial cells.Many signal transduction
  pathways are involved in the regulation of inflammation-related genes at the transcription
  level. The most important is the NF-κB pathway. NcRNAs play an important role in
  regulating the inflammatory response of AKI, and regulate the acute inflammatory
  response in the kidneys via a variety of targets as enhancers or inhibitors.
