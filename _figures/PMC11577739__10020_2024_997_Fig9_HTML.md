caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective
  effect of Elabela in vascular calcification Upregulation of FDX1 and Slc31a1 during
  vascular calcification pathology leads to cuproptosis in VSMCs, thereby triggering
  mitochondrial damage and accelerating the process of osteogenic transition of VSMCs.
  More importantly, Elabela alleviates cuproptosis and vascular calcification, as
  well as the subsequent mitochondrial damage and cellular senescence by facilitating
  the PPAR-γ/ATP7a signaling pathway. FDX1, ferredoxin 1; Slc31a1, solute carrier
  family 31 member 1; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; BMP2, bone morphogenetic
  protein-2; Acta2, alpha-smooth muscle actin; SM22α, smooth muscle 22 alpha; Slc31a1,
  solute carrier family 31 member 1; ATP7a, ATPase copper transporting alpha; PPAR-γ,
  peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma
