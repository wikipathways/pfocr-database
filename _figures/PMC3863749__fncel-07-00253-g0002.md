caption: The putative normal function of the native WT SOD1 protein. (1) SOD1 is responsible
  for converting the toxic superoxide anion (O2•−) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), the latter of which is involved in the modulation of multiple pathways through
  oxidation of exposed thiols. (2) SOD1 binds and stabilizes Rac1 in its active, GTP
  bound state, resulting in Nox2 (Nox) activation and superoxide production. The hydrogen
  peroxide by-product of the dismutase reaction of SOD1 and superoxide anion promotes
  the disassociation of SOD1 from the Rac1 complex, resulting in Nox inactivation.
  (3) Secreted SOD1 plays a role in extracellular signaling processes. The presence
  of extracellular SOD1 leads to an increase in intracellular calcium via a mechanism
  involving the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway.
