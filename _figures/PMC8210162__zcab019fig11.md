caption: Proposed model of action for GPS167. The diagram illustrates the possible
  pathways through which GPS167 promotes stabilization, production and activation
  of p53. The model is based on GPS167-mediated alternative splicing shifts and the
  noted increased and potentially sequestering interaction of SRSF10 on TRIM28, which
  is known to interact with MDM2 to downregulate p53. GPS167 also increases the level
  of DNA damage, possibly by affecting the impact of SRSF10 on the alternative splicing
  of transcripts encoding components of the DNA repair and cell-cycle machinery ().
  This pathway may activate p53 to promote apoptosis.
