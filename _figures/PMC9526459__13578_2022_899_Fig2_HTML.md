caption: Schematic depiction of hyperinflammatory condition and cytokine storm induced
  by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential antitumor drugs to control excessive inflammation.
  SARS-CoV-2 infection activates macrophages, neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Macrophages
  and neutrophils produce and release a vast set of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1
  beta (IL-1β). These cytokines lead to the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  in normal cells and ultimately contribute to the expression of inflammatory genes,
  further exaggerating the inflammatory responses. Several antitumor drugs target
  those cytokines and their downstream signaling pathways are considered as potential
  antiviral agents to control cytokine storm and excessive inflammation. Besides,
  the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with COVID-19
  exacerbates tissue hypoxia. Bevacizumab, one of the anti-angiogenic drugs, blocks
  the interaction of VEGF-A and its receptor, thus suppressing angiogenesis and increasing
  tissue perfusion. (Created with the assistance of smart.servier.com)
