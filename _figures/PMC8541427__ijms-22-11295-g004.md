caption: The Drosophila insulin signaling pathway, a simplified schematic representation.
  The Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILP1-7) bind to insulin-like receptor (InR),
  which recruits the docking proteins Chico and Lnk. These proteins activate PI3K
  which converts PIP2 to PIP3 in the plasma membrane. The production of PIP3 is negatively
  regulated by PTEN and Susi. PIP3 recruits two kinases, PDK1 and Akt, to the plasma
  membrane enabling PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt. Akt mediates several signaling pathways
  essential for cell growth and survival, by acting on several downstream substrates,
  such as the transcription factor Foxo involved in metabolism and stress responses,
  the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex, an inhibitor of the Tor signaling pathway and essential regulator
  of growth and metabolism, and Sgg whose inactivation promotes the activity of glycogen
  synthase (GS).  was created with BioRender.com (https://app.biorender.com, accessed
