caption: L-carnitine Synthesis. Endogenous L-carnitine synthesis. L-carnitine is biosynthesized
  from trimethyl-lysine (TML). At least four enzymes are involved in the overall biosynthesis
  pathway. These are trimethyl-lysine dioxygenase (TMLD), 3-hydroxy-N-trimethyllysine
  aldolase (HTMLA), 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH) and γ-butyrobetaine
  dioxygenase (BBD). * The double arrow represents additional steps between HTML and
  γ-butyrobetaine, which are 3-hydroxy-N-trimethyllysine aldolase (HTMLA) that catalyzes
  4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde, which then is catalyzed by 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde
  dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH) into γ-butyrobetaine.
