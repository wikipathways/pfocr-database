caption: Changes in Akt signaling with differentiation of CD8+ T cells and co-inhibitory
  receptor killer-cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG1)-blocked highly differentiated
  CD8+ T cells. An undifferentiated cell signals through CD28, initiating the Akt
  signalling pathway, which results in a broad range of cellular functions, including
  the initiation of proliferation. Upon differentiation, CD8+ T cells lose CD28 and
  gain the inhibitory molecule KLRG1, which acts through SHIP-1 and SHP-2 to degrade
  PIP3 to PIP2 (Tessmer et al. ), preventing phosphorylation of Akt(ser473), thus
  regulating the function of PI3K. Blocking KLRG1 signals in highly differentiated
  CD8+ T cells causes the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 leading to a restoration of pAkt(Ser473)
  to the levels seen after activation in the less differentiated CD8+ subsets, enhancing
  proliferation in otherwise dysfunctional cells (Henson et al. )
