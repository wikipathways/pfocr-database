caption: 'Model for APOBEC3B mutagenesis in cancer. The central pathway goes left
  to right and then circles back to depict error-free base excision repair of two
  C-to-U lesions catalyzed by APOBEC3B (A3B). Most genomic uracils are probably repaired
  in this manner. However, intermediates in this repair process can lead to a variety
  of mutagenic outcomes. Top left: C-to-T mutations can result from DNA synthesis
  over uracilated templates (as in Figure ) or from synthesis over an abasic site
  because most DNA polymerases insert deoxy-adenosine opposite this non-instructional
  lesion. Bottom left: C-to-G transversions most likely occur when REV1 inserts deoxy-cytidine
  opposite an abasic site followed by repair of the original lesion or a round of
  DNA synthesis. Top right: a single-stranded DNA break (SSB) can result from cleavage
  of the phosphodiester backbone by APEX (normal component of BER). Bottom right:
  A double-stranded DNA break (DSB) can result from opposing APEX-mediated endonucleolytic
  cleavages, or from a DNA replication fork hitting a single-stranded break. Both
  single- and double-stranded breaks can lead to additional mutagenic outcomes such
  as kataegis (A3B-catalyzed deamination of exposed single-stranded DNA) and insertions,
  deletions, amplifications, inversions, and translocations. LIG, DNA ligase; POL,
  polymerase; UDG, uracil DNA glycosylase.'
