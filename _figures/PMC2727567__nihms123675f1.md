caption: 'The complement system can be activated through three distinctive pathways:
  The classical pathway (CP) is initiated when C1q binds to its various targets. Bound
  C1q activates C1r and C1s within the C1 complex, and C1s then cleaves C2 and C4.
  The lectin pathway (LP) begins with the binding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
  or ficolins to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or apoptotic host
  cells. This binding activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which cleave
  C4, generating C4a (which is released) and C4b. As a result of the cleavage of C2
  and C4 by the CP or LP, C4b combines with C2a to form the CP C3 convertase, which
  cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. The alternative pathway (AP) is initiated by low-grade
  cleavage of C3 in plasma and the generation of a small amount of C3b. This C3b binds
  factor B (fB), which is then cleaved into Ba and Bb. This cleavage leads to the
  formation of the “initial” AP C3 convertase, which, like the CP convertase, cleaves
  C3 into C3a and C3b. C3a is released, and C3b binds to activating surfaces. Surface-bound
  C3b binds additional fB, which is cleaved within this complex, leading to the formation
  of the AP C3 convertase. The C3 convertase can amplify complement activation induced
  by the CP or LP. C3b can bind to C4b2a or C3bBb to form the CP or AP (not shown)
  C5 convertase, respectively, which cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. The C5a is released,
  and C5b contributes, together with C6–C9, to the formation of the terminal complement
  complex (TCC). Complement effectors generated during activation can limit tumor
  growth. The C3b cleavage product iC3b binds to tumor cells, and through its interaction
  with complement receptor (CR) 3 on mononuclear phagocytes and natural killer (NK)
  cells enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The TCC is thought
  to contribute to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which is one of the mechanisms
  for eliminating tumor cells by means of therapeutic antibodies. Some complement
  proteins accelerate tumor growth. C5a probably generated through the CP, recruits
  neutrophil-like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) to tumors. PMN-MDSCs
  migrate to tumors and produce highly immunosuppressive reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that inhibit the anti-tumor T-cell response.
  In addition, C5a enhances the production of ROS and RNS by monocyte-like myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MO-MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells are protected
  from complement attack by membrane complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) and soluble
  complement inhibitors, secreted in the tumor microenvironment, such as factor H
  (fH) and factor I (fI). Factor H is a cofactor for fI-mediated cleavage of C3b to
  iC3b and accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase.'
