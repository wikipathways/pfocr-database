caption: Figure 2. Top associated networks with their linked canonical pathways (CP)
  in ileum on PBCD1. In the graphical representation of a network, genes or gene products
  are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented
  as an edge (line). Human, mouse, and rat orthologs of a gene are represented as
  a single node in the network. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree
  of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation, and more confidence predicted activation
  (blue) or inhibition (brown) of a given gene. Edges are displayed with various labels
  that describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes. Both LA and LGG
  were associated with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling canonical pathway. The
  connecting sky blue line indicates the associated molecules with their predicted
  biological status, whereas the pink lines highlight the direct relation (solid line)
  between the genes. Only genes that are involved in canonical pathway are shown,
  and indirect interactions are depicted in dashed arrows with different colors representing
  the predicted biological status as indicated in the legend.
