caption: The potential mechanisms of aspirin action in N-ERD. (A) Aspirin acetylates
  and completely inhibits COX-1. As a result of long-term, high-dose aspirin treatment,
  there is a reduction in the level of PGD2. (B) Aspirin acetylates COX-2. Acetylation
  of COX-2 results in the production of 15(R)-HETE, leading to generation of 15-epi-lipoxins
  from arachidonic acid and resolvins from DHA and EPA. Lipoxins and resolvins bind
  to ALX/FPR2 on ILC2, T, B, and NK cells leading to decreased inflammation. Lipoxins also
  exert antifibrotic effects by reducing the expression of VEGF.  Resolvins act on
  ALX/FPR2 on macrophages and PMN and promote the resolution of the allergic reaction.
  (C) Aspirin may inhibit the activation of NF-κB. Aspirin potentially binds to IKK-β
  (IκB Kinase) and inhibits the degradation of IκB, resulting in inhibition of the
  NF-κB pathway.  (D) Inhibition of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). Aspirin
  directly binds and inhibits HMGB1 and subsequently leads to the inhibition of the
  downstream pro-inflammatory activating signaling pathway via NF-ĸB. DHA, Docosahexaenoic acid;
  EPA, Eicosapentaenoic acid; ILC2, innate lymphoid type 2 cells; M, macrophage; L, lymphocyte;
  NK. Natural Killer; PMN, Polymorphonuclear; UB, ubiquitin; P, Phosphate.
