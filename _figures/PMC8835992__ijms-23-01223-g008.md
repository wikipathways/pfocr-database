caption: 'TR-binding and regulation of genes in the pathway for positive regulation
  of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling in the nucleus based on ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data.
  The pathway for positive regulation of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling was visualized
  with regard to genes regulated by T3 based on RNA-seq or bound by TR based on ChIP-seq.
  The arrows show functional interaction: green for activation. The red histograms
  labeled ① and ② show the genes upregulated by T3 in the wild-type- and TRα (-/-)-
  hind limb, respectively. The blue histograms labeled ① and ② show the genes that
  were downregulated by T3 in wild-type and TRα (-/-) hind limb, respectively. Green
  circles indicate genes bound by TR uniquely in wild type hind limb without or with
  T3 treatment. Red circles indicate genes bound by TR uniquely in TRα (-/-) hind
  limb without or with T3 treatment. The black circle indicates genes bound by TR
  in both wild type and TRα (-/-) hind limb. Note that like the cycle pathway in ,
  most of the genes in the Wnt signaling pathway that were upregulated by T3 and bound
  by TR in wild type hind limb were not regulated by T3 in TRα (-/-) hind limb, suggesting
  that TRα plays an important role in mediating T3 regulation of this pathway during
  hind limb metamorphosis.'
