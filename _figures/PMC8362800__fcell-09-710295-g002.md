caption: A simplified diagram of the vertebrate HH signaling pathway. In the off state
  (left), Patched1 (PTCH1) represses Smoothened (SMO) by inhibiting its entry into
  the primary cilium (PC). GLI2/3 effectors are targeted for partial processing into
  repressor forms (GLI2/3R) following sequential phosphorylation via PKA, GSK3(β),
  and CK1. SUFU binds GLI2/3FL in the cytoplasm and nucleus. SHH binding to PTCH1
  (right) triggers its endocytosis, enabling SMO to oligomerize and enrich in the
  PC. GLI2/3 proteins are activated (GLI2/3A) through alternate phosphorylation events
  (PKA, CK1), causing dissociation from SUFU and entry into the nucleus to induce
  target genes (including Gli1 and Ptch1). CRL3-SPOP tunes the GLI response by targeting
  nuclear GLI2/3A for degradation.
