caption: NDRG1 expression inhibits c-Src phosphorylation at its activating site (Tyr416).
  This occurs through NDRG1-induced reduction in EGFR expression, abrogation of EGF-mediated
  EGFR activation, and thus preventing the EGFR-c-Src interaction. Moreover, NDRG1
  is shown to suppress Rac1 activity by modulating the phosphorylation of a c-Src
  downstream effector, namely p130Cas and its association to CrkII, which acts as
  a molecular switch to activate Rac1. Additionally, NDRG1 also affected another signaling
  molecule involved in modulating Rac1 signaling, namely c-Abl activation, which inhibited
  the phosphorylation of CrkII which is required for activation of Rac1 signaling.
