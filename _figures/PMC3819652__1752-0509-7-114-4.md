caption: UM2 scheme. Schematic representation of the UM2 that corresponds to the Nucleotide
  Salvage Pathway. Reactions and metabolites are represented as in Figure  . However,
  in this case the reactions with no gene association (i.e. orphan reactions), or
  wrong EC assignations, are represented with rounded rectangles and highlighted in
  yellow.
