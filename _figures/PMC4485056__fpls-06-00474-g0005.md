caption: Simulated predictions resulting from flux balance analysis were mapped onto
  reactions belonging to the Calvin-Benson cycle and photosynthetic reactions for
  mixotrophic growth. Absolute fluxes (mmol gdw−1 h−1) were categorized as low (<5
  mmol gdw−1 h−1, thin blue arrow), medium, (>5–10 mmol gdw−1 h−1, red arrow) and
  high (>10 mmol gdw−1 h−1, thickest black arrows). The simulations revealed an input
  of flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Calvin-Benson cycle, and flux
  being diverted away from CO2 and into ribulose 5-phosphate. Calvin-Benson cycle
  fluxes were further maintained by triose phosphate entry into the cycle, originating
  from within the mitochondrion. Upon inspection of photosynthetic fluxes, a cycling
  of electrons around photosystem I into the plastoquinone pool was active, resulting
  in flux diversion from the production of NAPDH back into the electron transport
  chain at plastoquinone. As a result of electron re-direction, ATP production is
  increased. 1,3DPG, 3-Phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate; 3PG, 3-Phospho-D-glycerate;

  description: Simulated predictions resulting from flux balance analysis were mapped
    onto reactions belonging to the Calvin-Benson cycle and photosynthetic reactions
    for mixotrophic growth. Absolute fluxes (mmol gdw−1 h−1) were categorized as low
    (<5 mmol gdw−1 h−1, thin blue arrow), medium, (>5–10 mmol gdw−1 h−1, red arrow)
    and high (>10 mmol gdw−1 h−1, thickest black arrows). The simulations revealed
    an input of flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Calvin-Benson cycle,
    and flux being diverted away from CO2 and into ribulose 5-phosphate. Calvin-Benson
    cycle fluxes were further maintained by triose phosphate entry into the cycle,
    originating from within the mitochondrion. Upon inspection of photosynthetic fluxes,
    a cycling of electrons around photosystem I into the plastoquinone pool was active,
    resulting in flux diversion from the production of NAPDH back into the electron
    transport chain at plastoquinone. As a result of electron re-direction, ATP production
