caption: Regulation of FGF signaling. The stimulation of FGFR by FGF ligands results
  in the activation of specific downstream target genes. Among the targets of the
  FGF signaling pathway are several feedback inhibitors, which are involved in the
  attenuation of FGF signaling and are part of the FGF synexpression group. Spry acts
  at the level of Grb2 and/or the level of Raf. Sef and XFLRT3 are both located at
  the membrane and can interact directly with FGFR. Sef functions as a negative regulator,
  whereas XFLRT3 enhances FGF signaling resulting in the phosphorylation of the MAPK
  ERK. Sef has also been shown to affect the phosphorylation of the MAPK cascade,
  either at the level of ERK or by preventing the phosphorylation of ERK by MEK ().
  MKP3 negatively regulates FGF signaling by dephosphorylation of activated ERK. P,
