caption: Blockade of the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway initiates an adaptive immune
  response to kill tumor cells. Blockade of the CD47-SIRPα signaling axis inhibits
  the degradation of tumor-derived mtDNA through the activation of NOX2, which, once
  in the cytoplasm of the DC, is recognized by cGAS, further activating the cGAS-cGAMP-STING
  signaling pathway to release INF-γ, thus promoting T cells to initiate adaptive
  immune response and kill tumor cells (schematic generated with figdraw). mtDNA,
  mitochondrial DNA; DC, dendritic cell; NOX, NADPH oxidase; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP;
  cGAS, cGAMP synthase; INF, interferon; STING, INF gene stimulating factor
