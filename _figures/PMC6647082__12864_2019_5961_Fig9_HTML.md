caption: 'Regulatory changes in monolignol biosynthetic pathway during stem bending
  process. The enzymes are listed as follows: PAL, C4H (cinnamate 4-hydroxylase),
  4CL, HCT, C3’H, CCoAOMT, CCR, CAD, F5H, COMT (caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase),
  PER, and LAC (laccase). DEGs with |log2FC| ≥ 1 at least at one stage and FDR ≤ 0.05
  are included. Black, genes involved in the pathway but undetectable in our data;
  orange, some of the genes up-regulated and the others down-regulated; green, down-regulated
  genes. Numbers in brackets represent numbers of DEGs. The monolignol biosynthetic
  pathway refers to pathway mentioned by Zhao and Dixon []'
