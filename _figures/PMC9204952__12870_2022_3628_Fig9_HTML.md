caption: 'The KEGG pathway of hormone signal transduction (The pathway map without
  coloring is the original version that is manually drawn by in-house software called
  KegSketch. The other pathway maps with coloring are all computationally generated
  as summarized below). • Reference pathway: this is the original version; white boxes
  are hyperlinked to KO, ENZYME, and REACTION entries in metabolic pathways; they
  are hyperlinked to KO entries in non-metabolic pathways. • Reference pathway (KO):
  blue boxes are hyperlinked to KO entries that are selected from the original version.
  • Reference pathway (EC): blue boxes are hyperlinked to ENZYME entries that are
  selected from the original version. • Reference pathway (Reaction): blue boxes are
  hyperlinked to REACTION entries that are selected from the original version. • Organism-specific
  pathway: green boxes are hyperlinked to GENES entries by converting K numbers (KO
  identifiers) to gene identifiers in the reference pathway, indicating the presence
  of genes in the genome and also the completeness of the pathway'
