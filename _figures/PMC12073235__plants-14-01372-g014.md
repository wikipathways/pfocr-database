caption: General biosynthesis pathway of Cannabis stilbenes. (A) Enzymatic reaction
  for the production of resveratrol. Arrow represents one biochemical reaction. STS,
  stilbene synthase. Stilbene synthase (2.3.1.95) produces resveratrol and CO2 from
  p-coumaroyl-CoA by subsequent addition of three malonyl-CoA molecules, and their
  cyclization, releasing four CO2 molecules. (B) Enzymatic reactions carried out in
  Cannabis for the production of stilbenes. DBR, double bond reductase. BBS, bibenzyl
  synthase. Note that the resulting structures of the oxidative coupling reactions
  (i.e., phenanthrenes and spiroindans) were conceived using the structure of dihydroresveratrol
  for simplicity. Double bond reductase (E.C. 1.3.1.117) produces dihydro-p-coumaroyl-CoA
  from p-coumaroyl-CoA and dihydrocaffeoyl-CoA from caffeoyl-CoA through NAD(P)H oxidation.
  BBS (E.C. 1.3.1.74) produces dihydroresveratrol from dihydro-p-coumaroyl-CoA and
  dihydropiceatannol from dihydrocaffeoyl-CoA, through addition and cyclization of
  three subsequent malonyl-CoA molecules, releasing four CO2 molecules. From dihydrostilbenes,
  different oxidative coupling reactions can take place, producing phenanthrenes (o-o
  coupling) and spiroindans (o-p and p-p coupling)
