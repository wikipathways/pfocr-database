caption: Proposed model of hypoxia-induced cellular processes presumably leading to
  antifolate resistance. Representation of the cellular proteins in the biosynthesis
  of nucleotides and folate metabolic pathway that are affected (i.e., silenced or
  inactivated) by oxygen deprivation. These alterations presumably result in a decreased
  intracellular pool of (deoxy)nucleotides leading to inhibition of DNA replication
  and cell cycle arrest. Consequently, these non-dividing cells become refractory
  to antifolates
