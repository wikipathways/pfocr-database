caption: Schematic diagram of carotenoids metabolic pathway and omics in plant plastid.
  Plastids can be isolated for futher biochemical and molecular characterization via
  omics, including chromoplast with diverse structures. Plastids possess unique crosstalk
  mechanisms to synthesize and accumulate massive amounts of carotenoids. Mutants
  or varieties associated with genes for carotenoid biosynthesis are indicated next
  to the gene. G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAP,
  dimethylallyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate. The yellow ellipses
  represent carotenoid pathway genes localized in plastids. GGPPS, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase; PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO,
  ζ-carotene isomerase; CrtISO, carotene isomerase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; LCYE,
  lycopene ϵ-cyclase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; NXS,
  neoxanthin synthase gene; ‘Baisha’, loquat (Eriobotrya japonica); ‘MBRA253’, cassava
  (Manihot esculenta); ‘Pinalate’, sweet orange (Citrus sinensis); ‘SunUp’, Papaya,
  (Carica papaya).
