caption: 'Conceptual illustration of the proposed primary mechanism by which oxysterols
  exert their osteoinductive effects. It is believed that oxysterol-mediated osteoinduction
  occurs via activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is known to
  be essential for normal bone development. In canonical Hh signaling, the transmembrane
  protein Patched (Ptc) inhibits Smoothened (Smo) activity. However, upon binding
  Hh ligand, Ptc is inactivated, allowing for Smo activation. Activated Smo increases
  levels of the active forms of Gli transcription factors, which translocate to the
  nucleus and upregulate multiple genes, including those keys for bone formation.
  In a stereoisomer-specific manner, it is believed that oxysterols may directly activate
  Smo, thereby promoting Hh signaling and osteoinduction. Ptc: Patched; Smo: Smoothened;
  Hh: Hedgehog.'
