caption: Schematic illustration of UV-B perception, signaling and responses in Arabidopsis
  (scheme adapted for UV-B from ).Plants sense UV-B with the UVR8 photoreceptor. Activation
  of UVR8 leads to interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 and stabilization
  of the bZIP transcription factor HY5 that relays the UV-B signal resulting in changes
  in gene expression. Among the suite of UV-B-responsive genes are those that encode
  proteins that function in UV-B-induced photomorphogenesis and acclimation. These
  include proteins involved in UV protection (e.g. phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway
  contributing UV-B-absorbing sunscreen pigments), scavenging of reactive oxygen species
  (antioxidants), DNAdamage repair (e.g. photolyases) and hypocotyl growth inhibition.
  Also, the WD40-repeat proteins RUP1 and RUP2 are induced upon UV-B, which facilitate
  negative feedback of the UV-B signalling pathway by directly inactivating UVR8.
