caption: 'Functional proteins association networks identified by differential proteomic
  analysis and relative Venn diagrams. Interaction networks identified between under-expressed
  (panel a) and overexpressed (panel b) proteins in T24 cells after 3 days (72 h)
  of 10 µM ATRA treatment in comparison to vehicle treatment (DMSO). All the proteins
  identified by the proteomic analysis are reported; only the actions (lines between
  nodes) of the selected pathways are highlighted with the colors reported in the
  figure’s legend. Different colors of nodes indicate the following different functional
  relationships, according to STRING database and referring to Gene Ontology (GO),
  KEGG Pathway (hsa), and Reactome Pathways (HSA); identifier number is reported in
  the brackets. Nodes of multiple colors indicate belonging to multiple pathways.
  Venn diagrams summarize the affiliation of proteins to different molecular pathways.
  (a) Yellow nodes: regulation of apoptosis process (GO:0042981); red nodes: apoptosis
  (hsa04210); blue nodes: hippo signaling pathway (hsa04390). (b) Red nodes: metabolism
  of proteins (HSA-392499); blue nodes: post-translation protein modification (HSA-597592);
  green nodes: regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and uptake
  by insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) (HSA-381426); yellow nodes:
  RAF/MAP kinase cascade (HSA-5673001).'
