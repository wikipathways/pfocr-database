caption: The liver is an essential organ for controlling many physiological metabolic
  processes, including the metabolism of glucose, lipids, and amino acids. After a
  meal, glucose rapidly enters the liver and is sequestered as glycogen. Glucose produces
  energy via glycolysis and generates NADPH the PPP pathway. Two other major pathways
  also participate in the generation of NADPH by ME1 and IDH1. In addition, excess
  glucose stimulates de novo lipogenesis in the liver. During fasting, the liver secretes
  glucose both by breaking down glycogen (glycogenolysis) and by de novo glucose synthesis
  (gluconeogenesis). With respect to lipid metabolism, glycolytic products are used
  to synthesize fatty acids through de novo lipogenesis. The majority of chylomicrons
  are delivered to the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, while chylomicron remnants
  are cleared by the liver. VLDL cholesterol is also assembled in the liver from triglycerides,
  cholesterol, and apolipoproteins, and used to transport endogenous TG to other peripheral
  organs. The liver is also the site of deamination, amino acid transamination, and
  urea synthesis. SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake is essential for GSH synthesis,
  which inhibits ferroptosis. As a sensor of amino acids, mTORC1 activation can suppress
  ferroptosis by increasing GPX4 levels. Finally, altered glucose, lipid, and amino
  acid metabolism can lead to insulin resistance, NAFLD, and cholestasis. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
