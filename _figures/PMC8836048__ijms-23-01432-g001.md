caption: 'Overview of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Arachidonic acid, the substrate
  of the cyclooxygenase, (COX) biosynthetic pathways, is derived from diet or synthesized
  from linoleic acid and is released from membrane phospholipids through a series
  of reactions requiring phospholipases. The enzyme prostaglandin H2 synthase catalyzes
  the committed step. It exhibits two catalytic activities, cyclooxygenase and peroxidase.
  The enzyme expressing both activities is referred to as COX. There are two isoforms
  of PGH2 synthase, designated COX-1 and COX-2. The cyclooxygenase component of PGH2
  synthase, produces the unstable intermediate PGG2, which is rapidly converted to
  PGH2 by the peroxidase activity of PGH2 synthase; this requires 2 equivalents of
  GSH. Specific isomerases convert PGH2 to various PGs and TxA2. Steroids have powerful
  anti-inflammatory properties because they inhibit phospholipases, thus limiting
  the bioavailability of arachidonic acid. Abbreviations: prostaglandin H2 synthase,
  PGH2 synthase; prostaglandin G2, PGG2; prostaglandin H2, PGH2; phospholipases A2,
  C, and D, PLA2, PLC, PLD; glutathione, GSH; prostaglandins (respective receptors),
  PGE2 (EP1-4), PGF2α (FP), PGD2 (DP, CRTH2); prostacyclin, PGI2 (IP); thromboxane
  A2, TxA2 (TP).'
