caption: A TCA cycle and related amino acid pathways. B Linoleic acid metabolism.
  Red and blue arrows/text indicate increased or decreased metabolite levels in AML
  cells versus their CTRL, respectively (|fold change | ≥ 2, q ≤ 0.05) and in the
  serum or urine of patients compared with CTRL (p < 0.05). Gray metabolite boxes
  indicate the ones that were not detected by MS analysis. The schemes report the
  most relevant metabolites in the pathway according to metabolomic data (HETE hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid, NAA N-acetylaspartate, poly-UFA polyunsaturated fatty acids, TCA trycarboxylic
  acid cycle).
