caption: The fungal pathogen C. neoformans has conserved many of the Cu homeostasis
  proteins found in other fungi and humans, but exhibits unusual regulation of gene
  expression in response to Cu. Melanin is synthesized by Lac1, which receives Cu
  in the secretory pathway through the action of the cytosolic Atx1 Cu chaperone and
  the Ccc2 Cu+ transporting ATPase. The Clc-A chloride channel facilitates Cu loading
  in the secretory compartment of S. cerevisiae. Ctr1 and Ctr4 are two partially redundant,
  high affinity Cu+ transporters largely localized to the plasma membrane. MT1 and
  MT2 are predicted to bind Cu+ and which have been shown to be essential for Cu detoxification.
  Sod1 mutants are sensitive to oxidative stress, have reduced melanin production
  and attenuated virulence in mice. The Cuf1 transcription factor is required for
  the activation of Ctr1 and Ctr4 expression in response to Cu deficiency and for
  MT1 and MT2 expression during Cu excess.
