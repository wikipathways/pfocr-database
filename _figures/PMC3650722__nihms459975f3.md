caption: The network was generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems,
  www.ingenuity.com). A data set containing 80 genes associated with coronary heart
  disease in GWAS was uploaded and overlaid onto the molecular networks developed
  from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Networks of Network
  Eligible Molecules were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity.
  The most significantly enriched network, as shown, is comprised of 36 genes, of
  which 20 are coronary heart disease genes.
