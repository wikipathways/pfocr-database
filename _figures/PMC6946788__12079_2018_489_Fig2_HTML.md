caption: 'Decorin and biglycan participate in multiple signaling pathways of innate
  and adaptive immune responses. As endogenous ligands for TLR 4 and TLR 2, decorin
  and biglycan stimulate macrophages to produce TNF α, IL-12, and MIP 2. In addition,
  biglycan itself can activate macrophages and activated macrophages will synthesize
  and secrete biglycan. Via the cooperativity of TLR2/TLR4 and P2X receptor biglycan
  is involved in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome leading to the secretion of
  mature IL-1 β. IL-1 β production is also fine-tuned by biglycan through TLR 2/4-NOX
  1/4 -ROS and TLR 4-TRIF/MyD88-NOX 2 axes. Also through TLR2 biglycan induces HIF-2α
  expression resulting in increased erythropoietin production and subsequent enhanced
  production of erythrocytes. Recent studies indicated that TGF-β-miR 21- PDCD 4-IL
  10 signaling pathway participated in the post-transcriptional inhibition of IL-10
  expression by biglycan. By inducing the secretion of RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-1 α
  biglycan chemoattracted T cells to the sites of inflammation through TLR 2/4 signaling.
