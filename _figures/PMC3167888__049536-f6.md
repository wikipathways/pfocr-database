caption: Pathways of CDT-mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells. Following CDT-induced
  DNA double strand breaks, the ATM-mediated DNA damage response is activated, which
  (directly or through Chk2) phosphorylates and activates p53 leading to activation
  of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Accumulation of fully phosphorylated active
  p53 overrides anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 while promoting the formation of pro-apoptotic
  Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak) protein oligomers
  on the mitochondrial outer membrane by transcriptional upregulation of pro-apoptotic
  BH3-only proteins. These interactions result in the release of cytochrome c from
  mitochondria and activation of caspase-9 within the apoptosome. Activated caspase-9
  in turn activates the executioner caspases-3 and -7 leading to apoptotic cell death.
  Activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway following DSB through caspase-8 has
  been suggested in human B lymphoblastoid JY and monocytic 28SC cell lines (; ).
  In a p53-mutated background, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway may be activated by
  either caspase-2-mediated Bax/Bak translocation, Chk2 causing E2F1/p73-mediated
  transcriptional upregulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and leading to Bax/Bak
  mitochondrial translocation, or degradation of Bcl-2 (putative interactions are
  drawn as dotted lines).
