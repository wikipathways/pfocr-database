caption: Model of response to aging in the mouse somatosensory nervous system. Damage
  to nerves and demyelination due to age‐related degenerative diseases including intervertebral
  disc degeneration induces Atf3, possibly mediated by increased TRPA1 expression,
  which promotes expression of Npy and Bdnf. Nearby intact small diameter nerves respond
  to nerve damage by inducing Calca, resulting in increased CALCA expression which
  is transported to the SCDH which may induce further Calca expression in SCDH neurons,
  leading to central sensitization. Additionally, increased presence of TNFalpha in
  aging tissues or the circulatory system acts on its receptors, TNFR1/2, to induce
  NFκB pathway components, Rela and Nfkb1, which in turn increases expression of nociceptive
  sodium channels, NaV1.8 and NaV1.9. Higher sodium channel expression reduces thresholds
  and increases the stimulation of SCDH neurons
