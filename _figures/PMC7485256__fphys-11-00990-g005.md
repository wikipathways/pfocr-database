caption: 'Liver disease follows a common pathway of progression which results in fibrogenesis
  that is both preceded and driven by LSEC capillarisation and dysfunction. This figure
  summarises the common disease pathways discussed in this review, highlighting various
  approaches for potential therapeutic intervention. These include: (1) molecules
  which maintain LSEC homeostasis, such as BMP9, statins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors;
  (2) anti-angiogenics which are also anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic, such as
  L1-10, AT-II inhibition and sorafenib; (3) anti-fibrotics, including anti-VAP1 and
  Hh inhibition; (4) and targets involved in leukocyte recruitment. LSEC, liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cells; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; BMP9, bone morphogenic protein
  9; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; NO, nitric oxide; sGC, soluble guanylate
  cyclase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; AT-II, angiotensin II; VAP-1, vascular adhesion
  protein 1; Hh, hedgehog; HSC, hepatic stellate cell.'
