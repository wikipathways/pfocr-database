caption: Schematics of the IFNγR signaling pathway was required for sufficient cell
  adhesion between CAR T and solid tumor cells. a A schematic of the functional IFNγR
  signaling pathway mediates sufficient cell adhesion by modulating CAR T cell-binding
  duration and avidity. High-frequency interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 stabilizes
  the immunologic synapse, which induces effective cytotoxicity of CAR T cells against
  solid tumors. b A schematic of the dysfunctional IFNγR signaling pathway renders
  solid tumors more resistant to CAR T cell killing due to insufficient cell adhesion.
  Reduced ICAM-1 expression leads to the suboptimal immunologic synapse formation,
  which reduces CAR T cell killing against solid tumors
