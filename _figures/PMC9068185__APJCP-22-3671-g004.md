caption: Propose a Potential Mechanism of LIN28B Induces Reactive Cholangiocytes.
  The diagram can be drawn by following the molecular cholangiopathy together with
  our findings. LIN28B would be activated follow by quiescence cholangiocyte exposed
  oncogenic inducing factors. The let-7 targets, IL-6 was subsequently upregulated
  in the context of LIN28B expression. The activated STAT3 signaling pathway resulted
  in transcription of IL-6 and it would turn to activate and create the inflammatory
  feedback loop, LIN28B/let-7/IL-6/STAT3. The effects of inflammatory cytokines on
  chemoresistance can be applied in LIN28B-overexpressing cholangiocytes by which
  their effects have been suggested to be involved in the promotion of chemoresistance
  by inducing pro-survival signals. Moreover, as a function of STAT3 could be applied
  in our context by which STAT3 primarily confers the chemotherapeutic resistance
  by inducing expression of several genes that play important functions in anti-apoptosis,
  cell proliferation, and as well as detoxifying ALDH enzyme
