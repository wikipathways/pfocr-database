caption: Positive feedback loops in ABA biosynthesis in seeds. (A) In Positive Feedback
  1, ABA produced by NCED, a rate-limiting ABA biosynthesis enzyme, induces ABIs.
  ABI3, and ABI5 interacts with each other while ABI4 induces ABI5 by binding its
  promoter region. ABI5 binds to the promoter region of a DELLA gene, such as RGL2,
  and up-regulates its expression. DELLA then promotes expression of XERICO, which
  increases ABA biosynthesis through unknown mechanism(s). In this way, the originally
  produced ABA in seeds enhances ABA biosynthesis through positive feedback. (B) In
  Positive Feedback 2, ABI5 down-regulates GA3ox, a GA biosynthesis gene, and reduces
  GA and GA response by GID1, a GA receptor. Reduced GA levels stabilize DELLA protein,
  such as RGL2, and increases ABA biosynthesis through XERICO, as described above.
  (C) In Positive Feedback 3, ABI4 up-regulates GA2ox, a GA deactivation gene, resulting
  in the same outcome as Positive Feedback 2. (D) ABI4 down regulates CYP707A, an
  ABA deactivation gene. Therefore, ABA starts to accumulate in seeds, which further
  enhances the same pathway through positive feedback. In these schemes, many other
  components, which may be participating in the pathways, and negative feedback loops
  are omitted. ABI, ABA INSENSITIVE; CYP707A, CYTOCHROME P450 707A; DELLA, D (aspartic
  acid) E (glutamic acid) L (leucine) L (leucine) A (alanine) protein; GA, gibberellin;
  GA2ox; GA 2-oxidase; GA3ox, GA 3-oxidase; GID1, GA INSENSITIVE DWARF; NCED, nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase; RGA, REPRESSOR OF GAI; RGL2, RGA-LIKE 2; XERICO, “XERICO” (Greek for
  drought tolerant). The schemes are based on Ko et al. (), Zentella et al. (), Ariizumi
  et al. (), Piskurewicz et al. (), Bossi et al. (), Lee et al. (), Cantoro et al.
