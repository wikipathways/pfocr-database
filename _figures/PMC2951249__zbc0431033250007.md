caption: A proposed model for oncogenic Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis.
  Oncogenic Ras simultaneously activates several downstream molecules including Raf,
  PI3-K, and p38 MAPK. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway mainly transduces proliferation and
  survival signals, while the remaining pathways commonly induce growth arrest (senescence)
  through cell cycle regulatory molecules such as p16INK4a, p19ARF, p21CIP1/WAF1,
  and p53. So, oncogenic Ras is supposed to induce proliferation or senescence dependently
  on the balance between these two signals. In this study, we found that GATA-1 inhibits
  mitogenic signal from Ras through its interaction with MEK1 in erythroid cells,
  which resulted in their growth inhibition due to the dominance of senescence-inducing
  signals. In addition, we found that p21CIP1/WAF1 is a crucial regulator of oncogenic
  Ras-induced senescence of erythroid cells.
