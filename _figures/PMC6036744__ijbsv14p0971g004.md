caption: The common genes between enriched pathway sets of drugs and breast cancer.
  The purple hexagon nodes represent the enriched pathways of a drug. The light green
  circular nodes represent breast cancer enriched pathways. The width of edges represents
  the number of common genes between two pathway sets. The wider the edge, the more
  the number of common genes. A. The common genes between enriched pathway sets of
  Eribulin mesylate and breast cancer. B. The common genes between enriched pathway
  sets of Tenecteplase and breast cancer. C. The common genes between enriched pathway
  sets of Pralatrexate and breast cancer.
