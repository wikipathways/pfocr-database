caption: 'Summary of mechanisms and pathways of HIF-1α mediated drug therapy failure
  in breast cancer. The pathways of resistance to conventional treatment of HIF-1α
  include: increasing expression of drug efflux protein leads to drug efllux, increasing
  expression of anti-apoptotic protein and decreasing expression of pro-apoptotic
  protein enhance anti-apoptotic effect; phosphorylated Akt/β-catenin pathway and
  increased cytokine levels promote survival and self-renewal of breast cancer stem
  cells; promoting the expression of PTP-PEST to activate AMPK, increasing the expression
  of BNIP3 to interfere the interaction between Beclin1 and Bcl-2 and inducing the
  acetylation of PAK1to phosphorylate ATG5 promote the upregulation of autophagy.
  MDR1, multidrug resistance protein 1; MRP1, MDR-related protein 1; BCRP, breast
  cancer resistance protein; IL, interleukin; ATG5, autophagy-related 5; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; Beclin1, a protein for regulating the formation of autophagosome
  membranes; Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, antiapoptotic proteins; Bid, a pro-apoptotic protein;
  PAK1, p21 activated kinase 1; PTP-PEST, the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST.'
