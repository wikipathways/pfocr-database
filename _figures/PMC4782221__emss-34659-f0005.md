caption: 'a ∣ The role of DAP12 and FcRγ in osteoclasts. In addition to a RANK–RANK
  ligand interaction, osteoblasts also express yet unidentified ligands that engage
  a putative FcR-associated receptor (most likely OSCAR or PIR-A) on the osteoclast
  surface. Osteoclasts also express putative DAP12-associated receptors (most likely
  TREM2) which bind to yet unidentified ligands that are not expressed by osteoblasts.
  Both FcRγ and DAP12 promote osteoclast development and function through ITAM-mediated
  SYK activation and the PLCγ2-Calcineurin-NFATc1 pathway. Inset: Mechanism of osteoclast
  development. Osteoclasts develop from myeloid progenitors re-programmed by osteoblast-derived
  RANK ligand, leading to biochemical differentiation. Pre-osteoclasts then fuse to
  generate mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts and resorb the bone surface. αVβ3 integrins
  are required for sealing the resorption area. b ∣ SYK-mediated signaling in platelets.
  Collagen activates the FcRγ-associated GpVI receptor on platelets and triggers Syk
  activation by an ITAM-mediated manner. The snake venom rhodocytin, the endogenous
  podoplanin and possible other platelet agonists activate the CLEC2 receptor which
  recruits SYK to phosphorylated tyrosine in the CLEC2 hemITAMs at a 2:1 stoichiometry.
  Fibrinogen engages the αIIbβ3 integrin which associates with the ITAM-containing
  FcγRIIA receptor. This complex likely activates SYK through both conventional ITAM-mediated
  SYK activation pathways and by binding of the integrin β-chain to the N-terminal
  SH2-domain of SYK in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. All three cases of SYK
  activation lead to platelet activation through PLCγ2. c ∣ The role of SYK in separation
  of blood and lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels express podoplanin which trigger
  platelet activation and aggregation. This and possible other mechanisms (“?”) lead
  to closing off any blood-lymphatic shunts. The mechanism of podoplanin-mediated
  platelet activation involves the CLEC2 receptor which activates SYK through hemITAM
  phosphorylation, as well as SLP76 and PLCγ2 acting downstream of SYK.'
