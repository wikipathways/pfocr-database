caption: Roles of the lncRNA H19 in osteogenic differentiation. H19 regulates the
  osteogenesis of MSCs through different regulatory mechanisms, including classical
  mechanisms and signal pathways in the presence or absence of external stimuli. (a)
  H19 downregulates TGF-β1 through miR-675 and inhibits the phosphorylation of Smad3,
  suppressing the targeting of HDAC4/5 to the promoter of Runx2. (b) H19, as a precursor
  of miR-675, produces two mature miRNAs (miR-675-5p and miR-675-3p), which regulate
  osteogenic differentiation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (c) H19
  sponges with miR-22 and miR-141 to promote Wnt/β-catenin/Runx2 expression, thereby
  enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. (d) H19 binds directly to p53
  protein, inhibits the activity of downstream targets of p53, and promotes the proliferation
  of MSCs. (e) The miR-138 sponge, through competitive binding with H19, reduces the
  inhibition of the PTK2 gene to promote FAK expression and induce the osteogenic
  differentiation of MSCs
