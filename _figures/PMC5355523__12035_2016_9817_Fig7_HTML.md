caption: 'A putative mechanism for the interaction between miRNA and the Ago2, Pum2,
  and REST proteins. Transcription: (i) REST interacts with mSin3A and CoREST, which,
  in turn, recruits the HDAC complex (HDAC1 and HDAC2). Additionally, CoREST recruits
  LSD1. The HDACs deacetylate and LSD1 demethylates the lysine residues of the nucleosomal
  histone core; these events condense the chromatin and limit the accessibility to
  the DNA, resulting in the inhibition of translation (indicated schematically by
  an X) []. (ii) REST recruits TET3 and stimulates its hydroxylase activity to form
  5hmC. Subsequently, TET3 interacts with histone writers (e.g., NSD3, NSD2, and SETD2)
  and mediates histone H3 methylation []. This mechanism may be involved in the expression
  of either miR-212/132 cluster or miR-132 alone. miRNA biogenesis and function: (i)
  Ago2 interacts with Dicer and TRBP to efficiently catalyze pre-miRNA cleavage; (ii)
  Pum2 mediates the activity of the RISC complex in neurons [], and, together with
  RISC and miRNAs, Ago2 participates in gene silencing. Neuronal activity: (i) Under
  low-activity conditions, Ago2 and its associated RNA-binding proteins (FMR1 and
  Pum2) suppress protein production by blocking cap-dependent translation. (ii) Following
  synaptic stimulation, posttranslational modifications of Ago2, FRM1, and Pum2 (?)
  are involved in the remodeling of the miRISC complex, leading to efficient mRNA
  translation []. Protein relocalization: (i) P-bodies may regulate local transcription
  in the synapses by managing miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA transcription. In
  the P-bodies, the mRNAs are targeted for storage and/or degradation. Upon synapse
  activation, a portion of the mRNAs stored in the dendritic P-bodies may reenter
  the translational pathway []. Phosphorylation of the Ago2 protein (at Ser-387) facilitates
  its localization to the P-body []. (ii) Stress granules (SGs) are generated in response
  to stressful environmental conditions and are another reservoir of mRNAs. SGs contain
  mRNAs, translation initiation factors (e.g., eIF3, eIF4A, and eIF4G), small ribosomal
  subunits and poly(A) binding protein (PABP) proteins as well as the mRNA decay machinery.
  OS represses the translation of important neuronal genes and influences Ago2 and
  Pum2 accumulation in the SGs'
