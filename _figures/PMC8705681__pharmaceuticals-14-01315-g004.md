caption: Resveratrol (Res) can trigger various mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer
  treatment. Res can stimulate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1
  (MKP-1) that leads to inhibition of NF-ĸB pathway and subsequently contributes to
  inflammation suppression and ovarian cancer improvement. Furthermore, the administration
  of Res can stimulate apoptosome complex formation, caspase activation, and mitochondrial
  secretion of cytochrome c, which all end in inhibition of growth and stimulation
  of cell death. In addition, Res suppresses glycolysis in ovarian cancer cells that
  can be effective in ovarian cancer treatment. Res can act against ovarian cancer
  through AMPK activation, downregulation of the protein cyclin D1, and inhibition
  of EMT, STAT3, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways, leading to ovarian cancer treatment.
  Moreover, consumption of Res—(Zinc oxide) ZnO nanohybrid can lead to the generation
  of ROS in ovarian cancer cell lines and exert anti-cancer effects on ovarian cancer.
  In addition, Res–bovine serum albumin (BSA) NPs induce ovarian cancer cell necrosis
  and cellular apoptosis, attenuating tumor growth in ovarian cancer. EMT, Epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition; Cyst C, Cytochrome c; STAT3, Signal transducer, and activator of transcription
  3; NF-ĸB, Nuclear factor-kappaB.
