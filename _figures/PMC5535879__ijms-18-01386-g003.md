caption: 'Effects of alcohol on one carbon metabolism and DNA methylation. Folic acid
  starts the folate cycle by converted itself to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is then
  converted to 5-methylene-THF (5-MTHF) to donate one carbon through the methylation
  of homocysteine (HCY) by methionine synthase (MS). The methionine cycle starts with
  the acceptation of the carbon from the folate cycle to form methionine (MET). s-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) is formed from MET through the action of methionine adenyltransferase (MAT).
  SAM is further demethylated by donating the methyl group to Cytosine residue of
  DNA (in presence of DNMTs) and form s-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). After deadenylation
  of SAH by s-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), SAH is returned back to homocysteine
  and completes a full turn of the methionine cycle. HCY can also enter in to the
  transsulfuration pathway to form glutathione (GSH). Maternal heavy drinking reduces
  folate level (1), and cause inhibition of MS (2) and MAT (3), resulting low level
  of SAM. Reduction of SAM may cause induction of SAH which inhibits DNMTs (4) and
  causing global hypomethylation of DNA. Elevated HCY level produces GSH which is
  rapidly depleted by ethanol (5) and shifts the reaction from homocysteine cycle
  to transsulfuration pathway, causing further global hypomethylation of DNA. BHMT:
  betaine homocysteine methyltransferase.'
