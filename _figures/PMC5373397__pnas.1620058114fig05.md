caption: Schematic model illustrating potential routes for electron transfer to nitrogenase
  in engineered plant organelles. The diagram depicts an artificial plant cell in
  which a chloroplast and root plastid coexists in the same cell. The main components
  or processes for generation of reducing power are shown. Components within organelles
  with solid outlines represent existing proteins present in plants, whereas components
  with dashed outlines represent those required to engineer nitrogenase activity as
  suggested by our results. The red arrow in the root plastid represents RFNR–ferredoxin-mediated
  electron transfer from NADPH to nitrogenase, with reducing equivalents being supplied
  by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxPPP). In mitochondria, the red arrow
  indicates the election transfer pathway from MFDR to nitrogenase, which can function
  if a heterologous ferredoxin such as AsFdxH or AsFdxB is introduced. NADPH can be
  supplied either through glycolysis or via the oxidative TCA cycle by isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (ICDH). In chloroplasts, light-activated photosystem II (PSII) extracts
  electrons from water and transfers them to plastoquinone (PQ), and then through
  cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) to plastocyanin (PC), which then feeds electrons to the
  light-oxidized photosystem I (PSI). PSI-derived electrons are used to reduce ferredoxin,
  which then transfers reductant to either LFNR, for NADPH production, or to nitrogenase,
  for nitrogen fixation. The NADPH generated can also promote reverse electron transfer
  to nitrogenase via ferredoxin, catalyzed by LFNR. The bottom lighter half of the
  chloroplast represents the light condition, with the blue arrow representing the
  photo-coupled “charging” process for accumulating NADPH; the darker half of the
  chloroplast represents the dark condition, with the yellow arrow representing the
  LFNR–ferredoxin mediated “discharging” process for transferring electrons from NADPH
  to nitrogenase (N2ase). As the major site for ammonia assimilation, ammonia produced
  in the chloroplast can be immediately assimilated by glutamine synthetase (GS) ().
