caption: The 6-MITC induced apoptosis on transformed cells results statistically significant
  at 24 h and dose and time related. Moreover apoptosis is triggered by an extrinsic
  pathway increasing activated caspase-8 level (orange arrows). 6-MITC is able to
  limit tumour growth by slowing down the cell cycle of Jurkat cells after 24 h treatment
  and it blocks HL-60 cell cycle by modulating Cyclin D3 expression level after 48
  and 72 h (red arrow). Finally, 6-MITC showed the ability to induce cytodifferentiation
  of promielocytic HL-60 cells into macrophage and granulocytic phenotypes after 72
  h treatment (purple arrow).
