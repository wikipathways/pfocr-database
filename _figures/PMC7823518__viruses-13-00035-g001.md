caption: Effect of alphavirus infection on cholesterol biosynthesis. The mevalonate
  pathway (MVA) is a critical anabolic pathway to cholesterol biosynthesis. MVA pathway
  metabolites are shown in blue boxes. Dashed arrows represent multiple steps in the
  MVA pathway. The green symbol (+) denotes a stimulated pathway. The red symbol (-)
  denotes a blocked pathway. In order to simplify the scheme, many reactions and their
  reversibility are omitted. FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  coenzyme A; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; SFV, Semliki
  forest virus; CHIKV, Chikungunya virus; SPDV, Salmon pancreas disease virus.
