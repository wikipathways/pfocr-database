caption: 'Schematic view of M1 and M2 macrophage metabolism.Left side, M1 macrophage
  triggers a pro-inflammatory response. The Warburg effect is activated by PI3K/AKT/mTor
  signaling pathway, which concomittantly activates FAS sustaining proinflammatory
  molecules synthesis (leucotriens and arachidonic acid). OAA sustains arginosuccinate
  (not figured) and arginine production, leading to NO formation by iNOS. The expression
  of PK in its embryonic form promotes the functioning of branched pathways on glycolysis
  upstream, as PPP furnishing NADPH,H+ for iNOS functioning (not figured). ACO2 inhibition
  by NO, results in a “truncated” TCA cycle: citrate is exported in the cytosol, further
  sustaining ACLY functioning and the production of pro-inflammatory lipids. In mitochondria,
  decarboxylation of aconitate in itaconate, results in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)
  inhibition, a process favoring HIF-1α activation promoting glycolysis.Right side,
  M2 macrophage triggers an anti-inflammatory response. AMPK inhibits PI3K/AKT: glycolysis
  and FAS are thus downregulated or blocked. AMPK also inhibits ACC, the first enzyme
  of FAS. FAO is promoted and feeds the TCA cycle, providing great amount of acetyl-coA,
  ATP and NADH,H+. PDH is blocked by NADH,H+ and acetyl-CoA, while pyruvate carboxylase
  (PC) is activated, regenerating OAA for TCA functioning. Cytosolic pyruvate (derived
  from glycolysis or OAA transformation) sustains PC activity. In mitochondria, OAA
  condensates with acetyl-coA to form citrate. High amount of citrate is produced
  and exported in the cytosol. Citrate sustains the production of itaconate, an anti-inflammatory
  molecule promoting activation of NRF2 and ATF3. Concomitantly, the break exercised
  by NO on ACO2 is released, allowing complete TCA functioning. The urea cycle – coupled
  with TCA –sustains the production of arginine, transformed by ARG1 into ornithine
  required for repairing (proline and polyamine synthesis).ACLY: ATP citrate lyase,
