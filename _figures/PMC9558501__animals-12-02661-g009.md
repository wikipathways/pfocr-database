caption: PD-L1 expressed by a macrophage (M, as depicted), tumor cell, or regulatory
  T cell can also bind to CD80 of a lymphocyte (L). This results in inhibition of
  the functional activity of the PD-1-bearing target cell (A). The “cis” interaction
  of PD-L1 and CD80 molecules on the same cell, e.g., a macrophage or lymphocyte,
  prevents their binding in “trans” and thus counteracts their inhibitory function
  (B). TCR = T cell receptor; MHC = major histocompatibility complex class I or II
  molecule; PD-1 = programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1 = programmed death-ligand
