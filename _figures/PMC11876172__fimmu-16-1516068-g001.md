caption: Signaling pathways and associated genes with mutations linked to hyper-IgE
  syndrome. (A) Components of cytokine signaling such as STAT3, ZNF341, STAT6, IL6R,
  and IL6ST; (B) TGF-β signaling pathway genes, including TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and ERBIN;
  (C) the antigen receptor signaling molecule CARD11; and (D) the actin cytoskeleton
  signaling molecule DOCK8. These pathways highlight the major molecular mechanisms
  currently identified which contribute to the clinical phenotypes of hyper-IgE syndrome.
  HIES genes are highlighted in red boxes or in red font and phosphorylation is indicated
  by yellow circles. JAK, Janus Kinase; STAT, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription;
