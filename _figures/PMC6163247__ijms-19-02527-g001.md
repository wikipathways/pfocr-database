caption: 'Metabolic implications associated to ceramide synthesis. Free fatty acid
  (FFA) such as palmitic acid is internalized through CD36, and ceramide synthesis
  is stimulated by serin-palmitoyl acyltransferase (SPT) through the addition of serine
  to produce sphinganine. Then, is converted into dihydroceramide by CerS and finally
  to ceramide by Des. Ceramides promote inhibition of Akt/PKB signaling by PKC function.
  Ceramides can be turned to GM3 which inhibits INRS, blocking insulin signaling.
  GM3 accumulation promotes the dissociation of IR/Cav-1 complex. Likewise, palmitic
  acid can function as a ligand for TLR-4, activating its signaling cascade that leads
  to the expression of genes encoding enzymes such as SPT, CerS, and Des. On the other
  hand, palmitic acid can be metabolized to DAG, which stimulates PKCε, activated
  PKCε phosphorylates Thr 1160 of INSR, causing its inhibition. Finally, ceramides
  could activate NLRP3 and lead to apoptosis by Caspase-1-dependent pathway. Image
