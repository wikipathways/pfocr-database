caption: The anti-tumor activity of DXR is mediated by its ability to activate DDR,
  especially the ATM-p53 pathway, which ultimately leads to apoptosis of severely
  damaged cells. Our study reveals an essential role of RGS6 in DXR-induced activation
  of the ATM-p53 pathway. RGS6 promotes DXR-induced generation of ROS, which directly
  activates the ATM-p53 pathway. RGS6 might also promote ROS-induced activation of
  ATM as loss of RGS6 in MEFs had a greater effect on DXR-induced ATM activation than
  DXR-induced ROS generation. In contradiction to the canonical theory that DXR activates
  ATM primarily by promoting DNA damage (DSBs) either directly or indirectly (via
  ROS), our study shows that the major mechanism by which DXR activates ATM DXR is
  via ROS (black arrows) and that DNA damage has only a minor effect (grey arrow)
  on ATM activation.
