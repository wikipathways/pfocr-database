caption: A scheme of CerS-interacting proteins. The upper branch shows the proteins
  involved in the pathway by which acyl-CoAs are supplied to the CerS, with enzymes
  encircled in blue and metabolic intermediates in black. The lower branch shows the
  enzymes (encircled in yellow) involved in ceramide synthesis. CerS are shown as
  a dimer (), with a related protein, FAM57B, indicated due to its ability to regulate
  CerS activity and levels (). For further details, see text. ACBP, acyl-CoA-binding
  protein; ACSL, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; CerS, ceramide synthase; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  DEGS, dihydroceramide desaturase; ELOVL, elongation of very long-chain fatty acids
  protein; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; KDSR, 3-ketosphinganine reductase;
  LC, long-chain; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; TAG, triacylglycerol; VLC, very
  long-chain.
