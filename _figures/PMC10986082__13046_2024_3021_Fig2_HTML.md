caption: Multiple mechanisms of environmental stress regulating CSC transcription
  A The immune cells in TME activate the STAT, Wnt, AKT and Notch pathway of CSC by
  mainly releasing cytokines (IL-6) and inducing contact. CAFs secrete various substances
  (cytokines, POSTN, miRNA) to stimulate distinct pathways of CSC (Wnt/β-Catenin,
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR, STAT). ECM exerts effect on the PI3K and Hh pathways, as well as
  transcription of pluripotent TFs through mechanical stress and CSC markers (CD44).
  B Hypoxia causes the production of HIF and ROS. HIF-1 secretes miRNAs and activates
  the Wnt, Notch, PI3K/mTOR pathways, as well as acts on histone modifications. HIF-2
  tends to directly regulate the gene expression of various TFs. Hypoxia induced ROS
  may support a transcription promoting role of CSCs. C OXPHOS occurring in the mitochondria
  of CSC can indirectly affect (through the release of ROS) or directly bear on the
  expression and effect of TFs. The alterations of mitochondrial function and state
  (mitochondrial fission and mitophagy) regulate the expression of TFs. The key enzymes
  in the CSC glycolysis process act on TF through the Hippo pathway and cell marker
  (CD133). Lactate metabolism plays a role in histone modification (lactylation) of
  CSC and ubiquitination of TF proteins. Lipid metabolism (LDs and FAO) is associated
  with the Wnt, Notch, Hippo, Hh and PI3K/AKT pathways and makes a difference in histone
  modifications (acetylation). Gln deprivation promotes pluripotent gene silencing
  and increases histone trimethylation
