caption: Targeting checkpoints of T cell in Lum 3 breast cancer. TILs recognizing
  small peptide presented through MHC class I/II, with costimulatory signals necessary
  to modulate T cell activation. Indeed, the interaction between B7 and CD28 on TILs
  is a positive activation signal; however, in Lum 3 BC, the CTLA-4 (CD28 competitive
  receptor) and PD1/PD-L1 pathway (immune and endothelial cells) delivers an inhibitory
  signal. Targeting immune checkpoints CTLA4 and PD1/PDL-1 can be used for different
  cancer treatments, including BC [–].
