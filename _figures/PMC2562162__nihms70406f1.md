caption: S1P metabolism and receptor signaling. De novo sphingolipid metabolism begins
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine
  to produce 3-ketosphinganine (3-KS). Next, conversion to dihydrosphingosine (DH-Sph)
  occurs, followed by acylation to form dihydroceramide (DH-Cer). Ceramide (Cer) is
  derived by desaturation and is transported to the Golgi for conversion to sphingomyelin
  (SM). Ceramide, generated either from the de novo pathway or from degradation of
  plasma membrane sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin, is deacylated to yield sphingosine
  (Sph), which is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (Sphk1, 2) to produce
  S1P. S1P can be secreted from cells (dashed line) and can stimulate one of the members
  of the S1P receptor family (S1P1–5), which transmit signals through heterotrimeric
  G proteins. In addition, S1P and dihydroS1P (DH-S1P), from the phosphorylation of
  dihydrosphingosine, can be degraded to yield ethanolamine phosphate (Eth-P), which
  is utilized for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis.
