caption: The mechanism by which PCSK9 regulates lipid metabolism. The level of PCSK9
  on the cell surface is influenced by blood cholesterol levels. After undergoing
  maturation through Golgi modifications, PCSK9 becomes active on the cell membrane
  surface. It then binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and facilitates
  its degradation via lysosomal pathways. Additionally, PCSK9 plays a role in modulating
  the expression of SREBP-2, ApoER2, and HMG-CoA reductase, thereby impacting the
  accumulation of lipids within cells
