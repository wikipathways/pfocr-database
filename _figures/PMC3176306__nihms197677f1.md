caption: PCa cells are characterized by exacerbation of lipogenesis associated with
  hyperactivation of mTOR pathway. Activation of AMPK can inhibit these pathways by
  direct phosphorylation of key lipogenic enzymes [ACC, in particular isoform 1, HMG-CoA
  reductase} and key kinases (the complex TSC1/TSC2 and the mTOR-associated factor
  Raptor) or by regulating transcription through SREBP1c. Red and black arrows indicate
  activation and inhibition, respectively. Tumor suppressor genes are represented
  in violet hexagonal boxes. AMPK= AMP-activated protein kinase, SREBP1c= Sterol regulatory
  element binding protein-1c, ACLY=ATP citrate lyase, ACC= Acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
  FASN= Fatty acid synthase, HMG-CoA reductase=3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase,
  MAPK= mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K= phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, PTEN=
  phosphatase and tensin homolog, TSC2/TSC1= tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, RHEB=
  Ras homolog enriched in brain, mTOR= mammalian target of rapamycin, 4EBP1= 4E-binding
  protein 1, S6K1= S6 kinase 1, eiF4E= Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4,
  GF=growth factors.
