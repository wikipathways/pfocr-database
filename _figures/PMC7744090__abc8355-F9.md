caption: Models for the molecular mechanisms of local KIF17 degradation and synthesis.
  (A) Model for the molecular mechanism of local KIF17 degradation. (A1) KIF17 unloads
  NR2B in response to Ca2+ influx through NMDAR activation. (A2) KIF17 is polyubiquitinated
  in an activity-dependent manner. (A3) The proteasome proteolyzes polyubiquitinated
  KIF17. (B) Model for the molecular mechanism of local KIF17 synthesis. (B1) PAIP2A
  is degraded by calpain in the NMDAR-mediated pathway, leading to augmented binding
  of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to Kif17 mRNA. (B2) PABP binding to Kif17 mRNA
  facilitates translation initiation. (B3) Kif17 mRNA is locally translated at the
  dendritic shaft. (B4) Newly synthesized KIF17 participates in cargo transport along
  microtubules, suggesting the regulation of local deposition of NR2B along a dendritic
  shaft that is crucial for cognitive flexibility.
