caption: We have also ruled out the possibility of electrophilic palladation mechanism.
  A secondary, instead of the observed primary KIE () with 1 is expected for the electrophilic
  pathway. The regioselectivity of 8 () is also opposite to that of the electrophilic
  reactions. Only the C-H insertion mechanism () is consistent with all the experimental
  data. Our DFT calculations (B3LYP/LACVP**++) support the acetate ligand-assisted
  C-H insertion pathway.
