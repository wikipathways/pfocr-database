caption: Genomic mechanisms, including gene transactivation (A) and transrepression
  (B), are the best characterized means of LXR activity in cells, whereas recently
  described non-genomic mechanisms (C) remain somewhat less well understood. In transactivation,
  two general models, represented by induction of the target genes ATP Binding Cassette
  (ABC)A1 and ABCG1, have been identified. For ABCA1, it is thought that LXR bound
  to promoter LXR response elements (LXREs) in the steady state tonically represses
  gene expression by recruiting co-repressors such as nuclear receptor co-repressor
  1 (NCoR). Upon LXR ligand binding, co-repressors are shed in exchange for co-activators,
  driving gene expression. More recent studies suggest that for a majority of LXR
  targets including ABCG1, LXRs bind to LXREs only after ligand-induced activation
  and histone demethylation. In both of these models, LXR binds LXREs directly in
  the form of a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the case of transrepression
  of pro-inflammatory genes (B), two general mechanisms of LXR action have been identified
  in macrophages/hepatocytes and astrocytes. In both cases, lysines in the ligand-binding
  domain of LXR are SUMOylated after LXR ligation. In the case of LPS-stimulated macrophages
  or cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes, SUMOylated LXR binds in monomeric form to a
  multimolecular co-repressor complex, inhibiting release of co-repressors from gene
  promoters, thereby blocking gene expression. In astrocytes, SUMOylated LXRs inhibit
  transcription by blocking the binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 (STAT1) to promoters. Recently, examples of non-genomic (extranuclear) LXRβ action
  have been identified, as shown in panel C. In colon cancer cells, cytoplasmic LXRβ
  drives NLRP3- and caspase-1-dependent pyroptotic cell death by inducing pannexin-1-mediated
  ATP release. In platelets, LXRβ inhibits kinase signaling to degranulation and aggregation
  downstream of the GPVI receptor. In endothelial cells, lipid raft-localized LXRβ
  mediates a signaling pathway to cell migration involving estrogen receptor (ER)-α
  and the kinase AKT. The relative importance of genomic and non-genomic mechanisms
  remains poorly understood. The distinct binding partners of LXRs in these various
  contexts, however, creates the exciting potential for targeted, potentially cell
  type- and gene-specific, pharmacologic interventions. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
