caption: The myriad and varied interactions between NF-κB signaling in cancer and
  the tumor microenvironment (TME). (A) Increased NF-κB activation in cancer cells
  can result in the release of proinflammatory cytokines into the TME. This results
  in stimulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cell infiltrates
  (such as macrophages) and noncancerous cells to release IL-6 and TNFα, as well as
  promoting STAT3 activation. Release of these factors back into the TME further enhances
  NF-κB activation in cancer cells. (B) Mutations of proteins in other pathways or
  lack of expression of those proteins have been shown to enhance NF-κB activation.
  These include mutant EGFR and KRAS in the RAS-RAF signaling pathway as well as miRNAs
  in numerous signaling pathways. Dysregulation of key regulators in NF-κB signaling
  such as PRMT5 can also contribute to upregulation of NF-κB activity. (C) NF-κB downstream
  target genes can act to promote a proinflammatory microenvironment by promoting
  the release of antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, proinflammatory factors
  TNFα and IL-6, angiogenic factors VEGF and IL8 and proinflammatory chemokines. Furthermore,
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines can restimulate NF-κB activation. All these
  factors contribute to a continual stimulation of NF-κB signaling and an increasingly
  pro-inflammatory environment.
