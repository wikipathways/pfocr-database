caption: Effect of antifungal drugs (I), resistance mechanisms against antifungals
  (II) and the effect of resistance on virulence (III). Azoles inhibit the ergosterol
  biosynthesis in fungi, which leads to toxic sterol accumulation (I-A). Resistance
  against azoles can occur via efflux pump overexpression by transportation of drug
  molecules out of the cell (II-A/1), via ERG3 loss-of-function (LOF) mutation leading
  to decreased toxic sterol production (II-A/2) or via mutation/overexpression of ERG11 (II-A/3).
  The effect of overexpression of efflux pumps on the virulence is controversial as
  it caused increased virulence in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis fluconazole-resistant
  strains but led to the reduction of virulence in C. tropicalis and voriconazole-resistant C.
  parapsilosis strains in mice model (III-A/1). In most of the studies, ERG3 LOF mutation
  caused decreased virulence in posaconazole-resistant C. parapsilosis and C. albicans strains;
  however, in some special cases erg3 mutant C. albicans isolates showed increased
  virulence in mice (III-A/2). Overexpression and point mutation in ERG11 caused decreased
  virulence in C. auris isolates (III-A/3). Echinocandins block β-glucan synthesis
  by inhibiting the Fks1p glucan-synthase subunit (I-B). Resistance to echinocandins
  can occur via point mutations in the FKS1 (II-B/1) or by the accumulation of chitin
  in the fungal cell wall instead of β-glucan (II-B/2). Both resistance mechanisms
  against echinocandins caused attenuated virulence in C. parapsilosis and C. albicans in
  mice, Drosophilamelanogaster, and Galleria mellonella models (III-B/1-2). Polyenes
  form pores on the plasma membrane on fungal cells as these antifungals couple with
  ergosterol, which causes cell death (I-C). Resistance to polyenes can occur by LOF
  mutations in different genes playing role in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway
  that leads to accumulation of alternative sterols, which has no toxic effect on
  the fungal cell membrane (II-C). These alterations in the ergosterol biosynthesis
  pathway cause attenuated virulence in C. tropicalis and C. albicans, regularly (III-C).
