caption: Rbf1 pathway expression is altered in ter1::hph mutants. Schematic diagram
  of the response cascade controlled by the master regulator Rbf1. The logFC values
  were obtained using the EdgeR analysis, shown below each gene. Values on the left
  correspond to the ter1-02 strain. Values on the right correspond to the ter1-24
  strain. DEGs are represented in red. Genes with an increase in transcriptional expression
  greater than two-fold are in yellow. ter1-24 shows a significant increase in the
  expression of Rbf1, independent bWx/bEy heterodimer formation (dotted lines); an
  increase in mainly the expression of Rbf1-target genes is observed in ter1-02. It
  is tempting to suggest that due to losing TPE as the telomere shortens, an unidentified
  transcriptional factor (TF X) upregulated its expression. That TF X may have upregulated
  Rbf1 and promoted the expression of genes downstream of the regulatory cascade.
  Alternatively, Ter1 could be the negative regulator of Rbf1 or the unidentified
  TF X (gray arrows with blunted-end heads and question marks).
