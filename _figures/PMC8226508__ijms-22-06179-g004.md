caption: Scheme of JNK and CREB participation in the signaling pathways identified
  by us previously [,] and associated with ischemia–reperfusion and Semax action in
  the subcortical structures of the brain at 24 h after tMCAO. The network was constructed
  using the Cytoscape 3.7.0 program. The oval blocks at the nodes represent proteins.
  The gray rectangular boxes represent signaling pathways. The lines connecting the
  oval and rectangular blocks indicate the participation of the protein in the signaling
  pathway.
