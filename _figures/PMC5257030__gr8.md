caption: Scheme of the interaction between the intrinsic apoptosis, autophagy and
  stress response pathways governing the HepG2 response to CdS QDs. Up-regulation
  is indicated by red arrows and down-regulation by green arrows. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  is linked to oxidative stress, as the mitochondria are both generators of, and targets
  for ROS. CdS QDs may undergo autophagic sequestration and then selective compartmentalization
  in autophagosome, leading to a dysfunctional autophagic pathway due to the inhibition
  of autophagic flux. The effect could also be associated with an accumulation of
  ubiquitinated proteins.
