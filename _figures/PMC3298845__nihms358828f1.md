caption: '(A) In the absence of Wnt signaling and in the presence of inhibitors such
  as Dikkopf, β-catenin is complexed with the degradation complex consisting of Axin,
  adenomatous polyposis coli protein and glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Phosphorylation
  of β-catenin by CK and GSK3β targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. At the
  cell membrane, β-catenin participates in the formation of adherens junctions by
  binding to E-cadherin, and also binds to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met
  (not shown). (B) Wnt signaling is activated by binding of the Wnt ligand to its
  receptor Frizzled and coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  5/6, which recruits the protein disheveled and the β-catenin degradation complex.
  As a result, β-catenin remains unphosphorylated and accumulates in the cytoplasm
  and is available for translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus, it binds to the
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family of transcription factors to activate
  target gene expression.APC: Adenomatous polyposis coli protein; LRP: Lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; TCF: T-cell factor.'
