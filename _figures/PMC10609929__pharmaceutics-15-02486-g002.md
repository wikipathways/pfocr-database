caption: Overview of the modeled DDIs for phenytoin. Black arrow means sensitive victim
  in the specific metabolic pathway for phenytoin (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) and itraconazole
  (CYP3A4). Red curve line means inhibition, e.g., fluconazole is a competitive inhibitor
  of phenytoin’s CYP2C9- and CYP2C19-mediated metabolism. Omeprazole inhibits the
  CYP2C19-mediated enzymatic conversion of phenytoin via competitive inhibition and
  mechanism-based inactivation (MBI). Green curve means the induction, e.g., phenytoin
  induces the CYP3A4-mediated enzymatic biotransformation of itraconazole.
