caption: IL-17A induces gene expression by activating IKK-α. Schematic show the pathway
  of inflammation-associated gene expression directly regulated by activated IKK-α
  through direct translocation into nucleus after receiving the stimulation of increased
  IL-17A. After phosphorylation and acetylation of H3, the target genes’ chromatin
  will be recombined and bind to NF-κB to promote TSLP expression. Then TSLP will
  combine with its receptor on immature dendritic cells and T helper cells to promote
  the differentiation and immune response of Th2 in COPD lung tissue.
