caption: (A) In epithelial cells, the major pathway that stimulates host gene expression
  following translocon insertion results from activation of Rho GTPases. Invasin-β1
  integrin signaling cooperates with translocon insertion to activate Rho. Activated
  Rho stimulates actin polymerization, leading to pore formation. Two possible pathways
  of pore formation are shown, one leading to opening of translocons and the other
  leading to opening of host-derived pores. YopE and YopT directly inhibit Rho. YopH
  and YopJ inhibit steps in the gene expression response pathway downstream of Rho.
  (B) In macrophages, insertion of translocons leading to perturbation of the plasma
  membrane or translocation of a PAMP are alternative but not mutually exclusive pathways
  leading to host gene expression and production of TNFα. YopJ dampens TNFα expression,
  suggesting that direct YopJ targets such as MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK) or IκB kinases
  (IKK) transmit signals in the gene expression response pathway.

  description: (A) In epithelial cells, the major pathway that stimulates host gene
    expression following translocon insertion results from activation of Rho GTPases.
    Invasin-β1 integrin signaling cooperates with translocon insertion to activate

    Two possible pathways of pore formation are shown, one leading to opening of translocons
    and the other leading to opening of host-derived pores. YopE and YopT directly
    inhibit Rho. YopH and YopJ inhibit steps in the gene expression response pathway

    of the plasma membrane or translocation of a PAMP are alternative but not mutually
    exclusive pathways leading to host gene expression and production of TNFα. YopJ
    dampens TNFα expression, suggesting that direct YopJ targets such as MAP kinase
    kinases (MAPKK) or IκB kinases (IKK) transmit signals in the gene expression response
    pathway.
