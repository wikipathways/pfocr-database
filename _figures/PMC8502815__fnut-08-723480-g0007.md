caption: Graphical representation of proposed pathway in which β-carotene impacts
  colonic epithelial cells. β-Carotene effectively inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory
  response within HT-29 colonic epithelial cells by downregulating TLR4, which may
  block the activation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit and related
  downstream signaling. Thus, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β,
  TNF-α) is compromised. The β-carotene induced downregulation of TLR4 may also alleviate
  the inhibition of its co-receptor CD14. Enhanced CD14 levels by β-carotene may upregulate
  tight junction proteins (claudin-1 and occludin), leading to decreased intestinal
  permeability and enhanced barrier integrity.
