caption: The diagram illustrates components and interactions in the mGluR pathway
  . Genes encoding proteins highlighted in yellow were sequenced in this study. Activation
  of postsynaptic group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) stimulates protein synthesis by
  signaling through the Ras/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. Group 1 mGluR function is
  modulated by interaction with Homer1, which interacts in turn with Shank3 and links
  mGluRs to the network of postsynaptic density-localized proteins. FMRP regulates
  synaptic protein synthesis by binding to target mRNAs and repressing their translation.
  Arc regulates mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity, and its levels are regulated
  by FMRP-dependent translation and Ube3a-dependent degradation. The activity of the
  mGluR pathway is regulated by several pathway components responsible for syndromic
  ASDs (indicated by asterisks), including NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), Ras/ERK
  cascade members (cardiofaciocutaneous/Noonan syndromes), PTEN (ASD with microcephaly),
  TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex), FMRP (fragile X mental retardation syndrome),
  and Ube3a (Angelman's syndrome). Mutations in Shank3, Nrxn1, Nlgn3, and Nlgn4 cause
  rare non-syndromic ASDs, and structural variants in SynGAP1 and DLGAP2/SAPAP2 have
  been associated with autism (indicated by asterisks) , , .

  description: The diagram illustrates components and interactions in the mGluR pathway
    . Genes encoding proteins highlighted in yellow were sequenced in this study.
    Activation of postsynaptic group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) stimulates protein

    function is modulated by interaction with Homer1, which interacts in turn with

    FMRP regulates synaptic protein synthesis by binding to target mRNAs and repressing

    The activity of the mGluR pathway is regulated by several pathway components responsible
