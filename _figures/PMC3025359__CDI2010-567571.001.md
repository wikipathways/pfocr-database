caption: Mincle- and Dectin-1-mediated signalling in response to mycobacteria. Upon
  recognition of their mycobacterial ligands, Dectin-1 and Mincle signal via the Syk/CARD9
  pathway for the production of inflammatory cytokines and the induction of Th1 and
  Th17 responses. There is also evidence that Dectin-1 signalling can cooperate with
  TLR2 to induce protective immunity.
