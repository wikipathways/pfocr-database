caption: Metabolic reprogramming supports the inflammatory response induced by D-lactate
  in bFLS. D-Lactate induces the PI3K/Akt pathway activation and downstream activation
  of NF-κB and HIF-1. Through this signaling pathway, D-lactate induces the gene expression
  of IL-6, with the pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the synovial inflammatory
  response. HIF-1 activation also increases the expression of the Glut-1 transporter,
  which increases glucose uptake for use in glycolysis. Glycolysis is also favored
  by the HIF-1-dependent overexpression of L-LDH, which oxidizes pyruvate to L-lactate.
  In addition, an increased PDK-1 expression blocks the mitochondrial utilization
  of pyruvate through the TCA cycle, contributing to the glycolytic fate of glucose.
  Overexpression of the HIF-1α subunit would favor the accumulation of HIF-1 heterodimers,
  maintaining glycolytic metabolic reprogramming. IL-6, interleukin 6; Glut-1, solute
  carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 1; L-LDH, L-lactate dehydrogenase;
  PDK-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit
  alpha; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; PI3K, phosphatidyl
  inositol 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; HIF-1,
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1.
