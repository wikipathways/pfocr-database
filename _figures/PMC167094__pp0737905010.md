caption: Regulation and hypothetical roles of the SnRK1 complex during seed  maturation
  and germination. This scheme combines recent models (e.g.  ;  ) with data  presented
  here for the tomato SnRK1 complex. ABA synthesis during seed  development or in
  response to high sugar levels during germination results in  ABA accumulation, inducing
  LeSNF4 expression. Additional factors promoting  LeSNF4 expression are shown on
  the left of the ABA signaling pathway, whereas  those inhibiting expression are
  shown on the right. Dashed lines both above  and below LeSNF4 are shown because
  it is unclear where each of these factors  acts in influencing expression. When
  LeSNF4 is present, it binds with  LeSNF1/LeGAL83, potentially altering the kinase
  activity or its interaction  with other regulatory factors or substrates, resulting
  in the maintenance of a  “maturation/dormancy” metabolic state and inhibiting reserve  mobilization.
  When LeSNF4 is absent, LeSNF1 may have altered activity,  specificity, or interactions
  with other SIPs, resulting in transition to the  “germination/growth” mode required
  for reserve mobilization and  seedling growth. In either of the metabolic modes,
  the activity of the LeSNF1  complex may be sensitive to regulation by sugars (indicated
  by the broken  lines) and could be involved in the regulation of ABI3, ABI4, and
  ABI5 and  other proteins that are known to influence the transition from seed maturation  and
  dormancy to germination and growth. (Arrows indicate promotion; bars  indicate inhibition.)
