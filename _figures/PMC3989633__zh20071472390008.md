caption: Summary of the proposed mechanism in renal tubular epithelial cells in obesity
  and metabolic syndrome. An increased FA load on albumin presents increased FA load
  to the mitochondrial β-oxidation cycle after endocytosis. This, together with other
  cellular sources, will increase peroxide production and exhaust cytosolic Prdx2
  defense by overoxidation. Increased peroxide levels will activate the redox-sensitive
  pJNK/caspase-3 apoptotic pathway leading to cell death. Blocking mitochondrial FA
  entry with etomoxir or overexpressing Prdx2 will provide defense against the activation
  of the redox-sensitive apoptotic pathway.
