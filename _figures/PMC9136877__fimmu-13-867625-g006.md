caption: VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway disrupts endothelial barrier function in sepsis. VEGFR2
  is well-known for its role in angiogenesis, but it is also thought to play a key
  role in sepsis-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. VEGF binds to VEGFR2, leading
  to activation of Src kinase. Src then binds to and activates FAK1, which induces
  activation of Ras/ERK/SK1 through both Src and FAK1. In addition, Src activates
  PI3K/AKT via Axl, and Rac1/PAK. PAK phosphorylates VE-cadherin, leading to its internalisation
  and subsequent disassembly of adherens junctions, which results in disrupted endothelial
  barrier function. This process is inhibited by VE-PTP, which closely associates
  with VE-cadherin, hereby preventing its phosphorylation. VE-PTP also dephosphorylates
  VEGFR2, a process that is promoted by the vicinity of Tie2. Tie2 activation induces
  activation of mDia, which sequesters Src and prevents its involvement in the VEGF/VEGFR2
  pathway. AKT, protein kinase B; Angpt1, angiopoietin-1; Axl, Axl receptor tyrosine

  description: VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway disrupts endothelial barrier function in sepsis.
    VEGFR2 is well-known for its role in angiogenesis, but it is also thought to play
    a key role in sepsis-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. VEGF binds to VEGFR2,
    leading to activation of Src kinase. Src then binds to and activates FAK1, which
    induces activation of Ras/ERK/SK1 through both Src and FAK1. In addition, Src
    activates PI3K/AKT via Axl, and Rac1/PAK. PAK phosphorylates VE-cadherin, leading
    to its internalisation and subsequent disassembly of adherens junctions, which
    results in disrupted endothelial barrier function. This process is inhibited by
    VE-PTP, which closely associates with VE-cadherin, hereby preventing its phosphorylation.
    VE-PTP also dephosphorylates VEGFR2, a process that is promoted by the vicinity
    of Tie2. Tie2 activation induces activation of mDia, which sequesters Src and
    prevents its involvement in the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway. AKT, protein kinase B; Angpt1,
