caption: 'Schematic representation of insulin signaling with highlighted in red pathways
  found to promote brain insulin resistance in AD and DS. Under physiological conditions,
  the activation of insulin signaling requires the binding of insulin to the insulin
  receptor (IR), which auto-phosphorylates on Tyr residues (e.g., Tyr1158/1162/1163)
  and promotes the receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of its substrate
  (IRS1) on specific Tyr residues (e.g., 632). In parallel, IR phosphorylates BVR-A
  on specific Tyr residues and activates BVR-A to function as Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase.
  Then, as part of a regulatory loop, BVR-A phosphorylates IRS1 on inhibitory Ser
  residues (Ser307/312/616) to avoid IRS1 aberrant activation in response to IR. Once
  activated, IRS1 works as a scaffold protein, driving the activation of the two main
  harms of the insulin signaling: (1) the MAPK pathway (ERK1/2) mainly involved in
  gene transcription and (2) the PI3K/Akt axis that is critical for linking upstream
  effectors (IR and IRS1) with downstream proteins mediating insulin neurotrophic
  outcomes. Activation of the PI3K/Akt axis is regulated by the phosphatase PTEN,
  which reduces PIP3 levels required for Akt activation as well as for increasing
  the expression of PKCζ. Akt promotes the phosphorylation of several targets, among
  which are: (1) GSK3β (on Ser9, inhibitory site), which has a role energy production;
  (2) mTOR (on Ser2448, activating site), which regulates protein synthesis and autophagy;
  and (3) AS160 (on Thr642, activating site). This latter, together with PKCζ, is
  responsible for the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane
  to mediate glucose uptake. Furthermore, Akt stimulates the upregulation of HKII,
  which is a pivotal enzyme involved in glucose metabolism and thus energy production.
  During the development of brain insulin resistance, a dysregulation of a number
  of these proteins was observed. In particular, brain insulin resistance phenomenon
  is characterized by key events such as reduced IR protein levels and/or increased
  IRS1 inhibitory phosphorylation levels (e.g., Ser307, Ser636), that are responsible
  for the uncoupling between IR and IRS1. As result, despite insulin binding to IR,
  IR-mediated activation of IRS1 does not occur. Downstream from IRS1, the aberrant
  activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis was observed. This event promotes the uncontrolled
  activation of mTOR able to phosphorylate IRS1 on inhibitory sites. Moreover, brain
  insulin resistance was associated with increased Aβ production, which was in turn
  responsible for IR internalization and thus reduced IR protein available at the
  plasma membrane to bind insulin. Furthermore, increased inflammatory processes promote
  a rise of TNFα levels, which favors the activation of stress-induced kinases (i.e.,
  JNK, IKK, PKR) and ER stress, which are all events known to favor IRS1 inhibition.
  Finally, many of the above described pathways are associated with increased oxidative
  stress levels, which further contribute to IRS1 inhibition and thus insulin signaling
  deregulation. Red plain lines/arrows: increased during AD and DS; red dotted lines/arrows:
  reduced during AD and DS.'
