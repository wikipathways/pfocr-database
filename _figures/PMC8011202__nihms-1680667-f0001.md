caption: Shown are the effects of Insulin, TZDs, Metformin, and Vildagliptin on endothelial
  insulin signaling and downstream vasorelaxation, vasoconstriction, and glucose uptake.
  Question marks represent places in which mechanisms are unknown throughout the available
  literature. Illustrated here is the PI3K signaling pathway downstream of insulin
  receptor activation resulting in NO production and vasodilation. Shown in tandem
  is the metabolic and mitogenic pathway of insulin receptor activation which controls
  the secretion of endothelin-1 and leads to vasoconstriction. Also displayed are
  the molecular targets of metformin acting as an activator of AKT downstream of PI3K
  as well as stimulating AMPK. TZDs are shown here also stimulating both PI3K as well
  as PPARγ which in conjunction increase glucose uptake and NO production. Vildagliptin
  is presented as a DPP-4 inhibitor with downstream effects on eNOS, subsequently
  increasing NO levels which result in vasorelaxation.
