caption: The monolignol biosynthetic pathway. All the enzymatic reactions presented
  in the pathway have been demonstrated at least in vitro. Because of the variety
  in isoenzymes and kinetic properties, alternative routes through the metabolic pathway
  may exist. A question mark after an enzyme name means that the substrate has not
  been tested yet with this enzyme. For reactions with a single question mark, direct
  conversion has been detected, but the respective enzyme is unknown, whereas for
  those with a double question mark, no direct conversion has been detected.
