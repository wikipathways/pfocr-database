caption: A) Overview of the potential mechanisms linking ischaemic postconditioning
  (IPOC) to the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). These can be divided
  into direct and indirect effects of IPOC. The direct effects start with a number
  of autocoids including adenosine, bradykinin and opioids accumulating in the postconditioned
  myocardium and acting on their cell-surface receptors. The activation of cell-surface
  receptors recruits signalling cascades including the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK1/2) components of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway.
  Activated Akt phosphorylates multiple substrates, including endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). Phosphorylation of eNOS
  activates the protein kinase G (PKG) through elevated guanosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate
  (cGMP), thereby recruiting protein kinase C (PKC) and possibly inhibiting the mPTP.
  The ERK1/2 pathway may be crucial in inactivation of GSK-3β (through phosphorylation)
  and thereby preventing mPTP opening, an effect that may also be activated by Akt.
  The indirect effects of IPOC include calcium regulation, attenuation of oxidative
  stress and delaying pH correction at reperfusion. Ultimately, mPTP opening during
  early reperfusion is inhibited by these various effects, leading to ATP preservation
  and cell survival. B) Abrupt restoration of the blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium
  can cause irreversible damage through effects such as calcium overload, oxidative
  stress and a rapid restoration of neutral pH, among others, which are factors known
  to induce mPTP opening at the time of reperfusion. Ultimately, mPTP opening during
  early reperfusion is induced by these various effects, resulting in ATP depletion
  and cell death. GC=guanylyl cyclase, MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase, NO=nitric
  oxide, PI3K=phosphoinositide 3 kinase.
