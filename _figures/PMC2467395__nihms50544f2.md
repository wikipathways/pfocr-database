caption: 'Ginseng is able to improve glucose metabolism through multiple pathways:
  1) Glucose disposal is increased partially due to activation of insulin signaling
  pathway and GLUT4 translocation by ginseng; 2) Ginseng is able to suppress food
  intake through inhibition of NPY expression in hypothalamus; 3) Physical activity
  is increased with ginseng through improvement of mood and psychophysical performance;
  4) Fat composition and body weight are reduced partially related to up-regulation
  of thermogenesis and energy expenditure; 5) Antioxidant and anti-inflammation of
  ginseng may be involved in the mechanisms of insulin sensitization; 6) Ginseng protects
  islet function through antioxidant and inhibition of β cell apoptosis.'
