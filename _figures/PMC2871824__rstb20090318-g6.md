caption: 'The ping-pong model: piRNA generation process is coupled with RNA interference
  mediated by Piwi proteins (PIWI, AUB and AGO3) (redrawn from fig. 2 of ). PIWI and
  AUB preferentially bind to antisense piRNAs. Guided by piRNAs, PIWI and AUB cleave
  TE transcripts having complementary sequences to the piRNA sequences, which lead
  to the inactivation of TE transcript as well as the generation of new sense piRNAs.
  AGO3 mainly binds sense piRNAs to target antisense TE transcripts, generate new
  antisense piRNA and complete the other half of the amplification cycle. The source
  of the primary piRNAs that initiate the amplification cycle may be maternally inherited
  (; ; ). Recent studies suggest a modified picture, namely that PIWI is responsible
  for piRNA generation through another pathway in the somatic tissue of Drosophila
  ovaries, while AUB and AGO3 are involved in the above ping-pong model in germline
  tissues (; ).'
