caption: The role of CAMs in chemoresistance and the formation of immunesuppressive
  microenvironment. (A) CAMs secret HA and OPN to promote the chemoresistance of OC
  cells. The binding of HA to CD44-Nanog complex activated the expression of Nanog-special
  target genes Rex1 and Sox2. Some activated Nanog interacted with STAT3 to upregulate
  the expression of multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene. OPN activated HA/CD44/PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway to promote the expression of ABC transporter proteins. (B) CAMs
  interact with other cells in the microenvironment to promote the formation of immunesuppressive
  microenvironment in OC. CAMs can secrete Wnt5a to regulate macrophage polarization
  and increase T regulatory cell infiltration. M2 macrophages promote the adhesion
  of CAMs and OC cells by overexpressing MIP-1β. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
