caption: 'Simplified diagram showing the metabolomic pathways modulated during normothermic
  machine perfusion (NMP) and their interactions. Metabolites typed in red fonts are
  upregulated in the NMP groups compared to the Native group, while those typed in
  green fonts are downregulated. Metabolites typed in black fonts had a similar concentration
  across ex vivo perfused and native livers. Metabolites detected only in perfusate
  sample are typed in italics, those detected only in bile samples are in italics
  and underlined. Metabolites which were undetectable by NMR-based spectroscopy are
  indicated in gray fonts. Differences across experimental groups were investigated
  by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. p-values are indicated as follows:
  all the NMP groups vs. Native: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001, **** p <
  0.0001; only OxC-NMP vs. Native: § p < 0.05; §§ p < 0.01; §§§§ p < 0.0001. Black
  arrows indicate a direct relationship between two metabolites; black dotted arrows
  denote multiple enzyme reactions to convert one metabolite into another; red arrows
  link one specific metabolic pathway to a different pathway; orange dotted arrows
  indicate metabolite translocation from mitochondria to cytoplasm and vice versa.
