caption: The mechanisms of TERT promoter mutations in occurrence, development, invasion,
  and therapeutic potentials in melanoma. The wild-type TERT promoter is enriched
  with repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3. In the context of C250T TERT promoter
  mutation, a proximal ETS binding motif is created next to a p52 half-site, which
  facilitates cooperative binding of ETS1 and p52. Next, during deregulated noncanonical
  NFκB signaling in C250T mutant cancers, stabilization of ETS-p52 dimer on mutant
  TERT promoter results in elevated TERT expression. The critical residues (in blue)
  required for dimerization of ETS and p52 are absent in both WT and C228T TERT promoters.
  C228T mutation will lead to an epigenetic switch that occurs resulting in the association
  of active H3K4me2/3 marks and GABP recruitment on the mutant allele. Stabilization
  of GABP on mutant TERT promoter leads to TERT reactivation. Besides, BRAF V600E/MAPK
  pathway phosphorylates and activates FOS, which in turn acts as a transcription
  factor to bind and activate the GABPB promoter, increasing the expression of GABPB
  and driving the formation of the GABPA-GABPB complex. The formation of the GABP
  complex selectively binds and activates the mutant TERT promoter, upregulating TERT
  expression. Next, TERT promoter mutations will increase TERT transcription activity.
  Telomerase activity mainly depends on the amount of TERT. Increased telomerase activity
  will maintain telomere length and promote cell immortalization and melanoma growth.
