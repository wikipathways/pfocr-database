caption: (1) The presence of therapeutic recombinant antibodies that block the PD-1/PD-L1
  axis allows for signalling of the TCR of a CD8+ T-cell with its associated antigen
  presented by the cancer cell through a MHC-I molecule. Concurrent depletion of the
  IAPs through SMC treatment can enhance T-cell activation, likely by providing a
  tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) co-stimulatory response (similar
  to 4-1BB or OX40 activation), resulting in enhanced activation and expansion of
  tumour-specific CD8+ T-cells. As a result, Granzyme B (GrzB) and Perforin (Pfn)
  are secreted to kill target cells. (2) SMC-mediated antagonism of the casp-3 inhibitor,
  XIAP, can result in enhanced death of tumour cells by GrzB. (3) The depletion of
  cIAP1 and cIAP2 by SMCs leads to increased local production of TNF-α by T-cells
  in the tumour microenvironment, an effect that is likely mediated by activation
  of the alternative NF-κB pathway. (4) As a result of cIAP1/ 2 loss, SMC-treated
  cancer cells are sensitized to cell death induction in the presence of proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α.
