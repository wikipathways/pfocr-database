caption: (a) Prostate cancer at a glance- represents some basic facts around current
  prostate cancer treatment approach, its limitations and its associated post therapeutic
  complications. (b) Achilles’ heel in cancer- depicts three important factors and
  their underlying features that most fundamentally challenges and dampens current
  molecularly targeted therapies in cancer. (c) ‘Clausewitzian Dictum’ in cancer biology-
  Here we propose for a multi target strategy, ‘Clausewitzian Dictum’ that essentially
  calls for a three level targeting- attack at the network level, attack at the cancer
  hallmark level, and for functional modular level. On the other hand, these three
  factors-cancer protein interactome network, cancer hallmark functional ability and
  its modular signaling network architecture together comprises the Achilles’ heel
  in cancer. (d) Our Bottom Up Approach- Adaptor protein comprises our initial seed
  protein. Binary protein interaction database [Human Protein Reference Database (HRPD)]
  provides information for adaptor protein and its physical interacting partner. For
  accessing the role of adaptor protein and its binary interacting partner in the
  context of prostate cancer, we manually curated the literature for each of adaptor
  protein and its corresponding interacting partner. Based on these information, we
  reconstruct adaptor centric molecular interactome in human prostate cancer. For
  gaining a functional organizational view, we then extracts various oncogenic signaling
  pathways maps, subnetworks and modules associated with diverse cell biological events
  and hallmark related phenomenon with other literature mined information’s (detailed
  in the material and methods section). (e) Human Prostate Cancer Hallmarks Map Features-
  It provides a comprehensive resource for revealing molecular architecture of human
  prostate cancer at four specific levels namely, prostate cancer hallmark & its underlying
  feature based phenomenon, prostate cancer hallmark based and cell biological function
  based molecular connectivity map, hallmark based and its underlying events related
  oncogenic signaling pathway map, hallmark and inter hallmark related pathway based
  functional connectivity map.
