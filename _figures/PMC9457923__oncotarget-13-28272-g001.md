caption: (A) A diagram of the SHH signaling pathway with its current inhibitors and
  therapeutics against SHH-MB (black boxes), and potential strategies to inhibit ABCC4
  (red box). (B) A scheme depicting how to achieve efficacy of an ABCC4 inhibitor.
  After diagnosis, ABCC4 expression profiling would be recommended to ensure that
  the treatment of SHH-MB with an ABCC4 inhibitor only targets those patients with
  elevated ABCC4 level. This strategy may be applicable to other cancers arising from
  dysregulated SHH signaling (purple ellipses) or other malignancies in which high
  ABCC4 expression is a hallmark of poor prognosis (yellow ellipses). Among these
  diseases, black font indicates cancers in which ABCC4 has been suggested as a therapeutic
  target whereas white font indicates diseases in which ABCC4’s impact is still unclear.
