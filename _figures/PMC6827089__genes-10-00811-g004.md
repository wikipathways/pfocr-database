caption: 'GA biosynthesis (A) and signaling (B) pathways in A. thaliana. GAs are synthesized
  in plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the cytosol. There are several
  steps in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway: geranyl geranyl diphosphate
  (GGDP) is converted to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate
  synthase (CPS); ent-CDP is converted to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase (KS);
  ent-kaurene is converted through ent-kaurenol, ent-kaurenal to ent-kaurenoic acid
  by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO); ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to GA12-aldehyde (through
  the ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid) by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO). GA12-aldehyde
  is converted to GA12 by KAO and GA12 to GA53 by gibberellin 13-oxidase (GA13ox).
  GA12 and GA53 are processed to the bioactive GAs by oxidations on C-20 and C-3,
  which is accomplished by GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox) and GA 3-oxidase (GA3ox). The binding
  of DELLAs by the GA-GID1 (GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1) complex increases their affinity
  for the SCFSLY1 E3 ubiquitin ligases, and polyubiquitin chain-labeled proteins are
  degraded by 26S proteasome. These events lead to the activation/unblocking of specific
  transcription factors that interact with the promoters to regulate GA-response genes.
