caption: Pathway analysis of commonly dysregulated genes. (A) Overlapping canonical
  pathways map with annotated P-values representing shared biology among the 25 commonly
  up-regulated mRNAs/proteins, as determined through IPA. Connected canonical pathways
  share one or more genes in common. The brighter the red of the node, the more significant
  the canonical pathway in the gene set. The yellow star highlights the overlapping
  pathway between 25 commonly up-regulated gene set enriched pathways and 10 commonly
  down-regulated gene set enriched pathways. (B) Overlapping canonical pathways map
  with annotated P-values representing shared biology among the 10 commonly down-regulated
  mRNAs/proteins by IPA. (C) Details of Acute Phase Response Signaling pathways. Eight
  commonly up-regulated mRNAs were highlighted with yellow stars and two down-regulated
  mRNAs with green stars.
