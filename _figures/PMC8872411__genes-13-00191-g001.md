caption: miRNAs biogenesis pathway. Canonical biogenesis pathway begins in the nucleus,
  where miRNA genes are transcribed as an extended hairpin shape called primary miRNA
  (pri-miRNA) by the RNA polymerase II. Later, a microprocessor complex composed by
  Drosha, DiGeorge syndrome critical region eight genes (DGCR8), and associated proteins
  cleaves both strands of the loop, yielding a shorter stem-loop structure of 60 to
  70 nucleotides called precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). Following that, the pre-miRNA
  is exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5, where it is processed by the RNase III
  endonuclease Dicer and the RNA-binding protein TRBP, which trim the loop to form
  a miRNA/miRNA* duplex. The duplex is then inserted into the RNA-Induced Silencing
  complex (RISC) under the guidance of an argonaute (AGO) protein, where helicase
  separates the strands, and one of them constitutes the mature miRNA. Finally, the
  RISC–mRNA complex recognizes specific mRNA by sequence complementarity, resulting
  in mRNA degradation or translational inhibition.
