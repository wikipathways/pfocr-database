caption: Model for the control of fimB expression and type 1 fimbriation by RfaH and
  MicA. (a) Misfolded outer membrane proteins (MOMP) activate protease DegS to cleave
  RseA, releasing σE to activate micA transcription (, ). (b) Procaine (Pc) activates
  EnvZ/OmpR to also induce σE and hence micA expression (). (c) Mutation of rfaH also
  leads to changes in LPS core biosynthesis that cause misfolding of outer membrane
  proteins and hence induction of σE and hence micA expression. (d) Procaine activates
  an alternative envelope stress pathway (Sx-Rx). (e) RfaH is postulated to inhibit
  fimB transcription indirectly by activation expression of Sx and/or Rx. (f and g)
  SlyA enhances fimB expression directly () (f) but is also postulated (g) to enhance
  expression of an unknown factor (Fx) that prevents Sx-Rx signaling in the absence
  of procaine. (h) FimB catalyzes off-to-on inversion of fimS to enhance expression
  of type 1 fimbriae (T1F). (i) Type 1 fimbriae stimulate inflammation by enhancing
  LPS-activated host signaling pathways (). Stimulatory and inhibitory interactions
  are indicated by arrows and diamonds, respectively. Dotted lines represent speculative
  pathways. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.
