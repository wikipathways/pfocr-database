caption: Schematic representation of the fundamental and functional differences between
  APC and thrombin-mediated PAR1 activation. APC cleavage of PAR1 at Arg46 and the
  tethered-ligand sequence generated by this cleavage starting at Asn47 (TR47) induces
  a subset of PAR1 conformations that prefer signaling mediated by β-arrestin-2 involving
  activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and that result in activation of barrier protective
  Rac1. In contrast, thrombin cleavage of PAR1 at Arg46 and the tethered-ligand sequence
  generated by this cleavage starting at Ser42 (TRAP) induces a subset of PAR1 conformations
  that prefer G protein-mediated signaling involving activation of the ERK1/2 and
  that result in activation of barrier disruptive RhoA. Thus, depending on the activating
  ligand, PAR1 can recruit different signaling pathways that result in different functional
  outcomes, which has been labeled “biased agonism.” The agonist bias is thus directly
  related to the cleavage sites of the tethered-ligand and the new N-terminal sequence
  as represented by the TRAP peptide that exists after cleavage at Arg41 or the TR47
  peptide that exists after cleavage at Arg46. This figure was originally published
  in Blood. L.O. Mosnier, R.K. Sinha, L. Burnier, E.A. Bouwens, J.H. Griffin. Biased
  agonism of protease-activated receptor 1 by activated protein C caused by noncanonical
