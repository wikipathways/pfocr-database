caption: Each reaction in the pathway from glucose (Glu) to lactate is represented
  with an arrow indicating whether it is fully reversible and near equilibrium (↔)
  or irreversible (→). There are three irreversible steps responsible for regulating
  the pathway, hexokinase (HK) or glucokinase (GK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and
  pyruvate kinase (PK). All of the other reactions are freely reversible (free energy
  change near zero) and operate either in the forward (glycolysis) or reverse (gluconeogenesis)
  direction as needed. Each of the irreversible reactions is accompanied by an energy
  loss (−free energy change) of more than 12.5 kJ mol1 as heat. The irreversible steps
  determine the net forward flux through that part of the pathway and act as valves
  controlling the direction of the flux, i.e. PFK determines whether carbon from glucose
  is stored as glycogen or metabolized to pyruvate for oxidation by the citric acid
  cycle (CAC) or exported as lactate.
