caption: Phagocytosed Aβ fibrils can be retrograde transported into aggresome and
  then refolding occurs with the help of chaperone molecules such as Hsp70; later
  they can be degraded by IDE or lysosomal enzymes, or excytosed. Endocytosed Aβ fibrils
  can also be degraded via endosome-lysosome pathway. HIV might impair Aβ fibrils
  degradation in macrophage through elevating TNF-α and IFN-γ (inhibitory for Aβ fibrils
  degradation), decreasing IL-4 and IL-10 (stimulatory for Aβ fibrils degradation),
  and blocking endosome-lysosomal pathway, raising a possibility that Aβ may be co-leased
  with virions into extracelluar space where it can serve as a seed for fibrillogenesis.
