caption: A model of cell fate decision by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in NSPCs. In normal
  conditions, both ATM and ATR are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated and inactivated, leading
  to dephosphorylation of p53 at Ser18. The resulting inactivation of p53 promotes
  the self-renewal of NSPCs and neurosphere formation. Under PARP inhibition, ATM
  and/or ATR without poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are activated, leading to the phosphorylation
  and activation of p53. The activated p53 signaling pathway delays cell cycle progression
  and induces apoptosis by different mechanisms
