caption: 'Mitochondrial quality control: regulating mitochondrial turnover and homeostatic
  mtDNA repair mechanisms and ROS scavenging (A). Various mechanisms can be activated
  to either prevent or eliminate mtDNA damage. The first line of defence involves
  ROS scavenging factors such as antioxidants, SOD, the thioredoxin system, and glutathione
  peroxidase (1). Repair mechanisms become activated after damage is sensed on the
  mtDNA. Among these, the mitochondrial BER pathway is the most well-characterised,
  but in the last decades, other common proteins of nDNA repair mechanisms have also
  been identified in mitochondria, shedding light on the possibility that these pathways
  have a role in mtDNA repair as well (2) [,]. If all these damage responses are not
  able to fully repair the lesion, then a single molecule of mtDNA can be degraded.
  This does not impact organelle physiology since each mitochondrion owns multiple
  copies of the same nucleic acid (3). Finally, if the damage is extensive, the whole
  mitochondrion can be degraded through mitophagy. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)
  (B). Dysfunctional mitochondrial proteins can be degraded by the UPS, a specific
  degradation system which relies on the covalent binding of ubiquitin to lysine residues
  within target proteins. Ubiquitin is translocated via the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes
  (1) before reaching the damaged protein (2). The polyubiquitin-tagged protein is
  then translocated to the cytosolic proteasome for degradation (3), where the ubiquitin
  is recycled, ready for another round of polyubiquitination (4). UPS is crucial in
  preserving mitochondrial integrity and vice versa. Indeed, dysfunctional mitochondria
  with an increased number of damaged proteins could not only overflow the proteasome
  but also affect the proteasomal subunits themselves, thereby affecting the catalytic
  activity of the UPS. Once mitochondrial dysfunction and proteasomal impairments
  develop, a vicious cycle may start, leading to a progressive failure of the UPS
  and, consequently, to ageing or, in the worst scenario, to neurodegenerative diseases.
  Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) (C). The UPRmt system can be activated
  in response to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in mitochondria. The crucial
  role of the UPRmt protein ATF5 is explicated through its nuclear localisation sequence
  (NLS) and mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS) (1). Under physiological conditions,
  ATF5 is localised in mitochondria (red dashed arrow) and likely degraded by a protease
  (2) such as the one characterised in C. elegans []. If mitochondrial import is dysfunctional,
  ATF5 accumulates in the cytosol and is translocated into the nucleus (blue arrow),
  where it can influence the activation of the transcriptional factors c-Jun and CHOP,
  which in turn regulate the activation of genes able to restore mitochondrial functions
  (3). Mitochondrial dynamics (D). Mitochondria can orchestrate cycles of fusion and
  fission as part of their dynamic network, allowing the maintenance of shape, distribution,
  and size. This mechanism can also be used to cope with unrepairable damages such
  as inter-/intrastrand and DNA-protein cross-links through the removal of the damaged
  section of the mtDNA by mitophagy []. Fusion ((1), red arrows) is mediated by Mfn1,
  Mfn2, and Opa1 (2) and allows the mitochondria to bond together to respond to damage
  (3). Fission (blue arrows) can also mediate the response to an external stress (3)
  that causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Fission is mediated by dynamin-related protein
  1 (Drp1) (4) and, opposite to fusion, acts to isolate the damaged area of the organelle
  for clearance by mitophagy (5). Mitophagy (E). Defective mitochondria can be cleared
  in a process called mitophagy. The whole organelle is isolated from the rest of
  the cell owing to the generation of an autophagosome (1). The fusion of the autophagosome
  with a lysosome gives rise to the autolysosome (2) containing a set of enzymes in
  an acidic environment which drives the degradation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic
  acids in a controlled manner (3). BER = base excision repair; DSB = double strand
  break; MMR = mismatch repair; ROS = reactive oxygen species; SOD = super oxidase
  dismutase; Ub = ubiquitin; UPRmt = mitochondrial unfolded protein response; UPS
  = ubiquitin proteasome system.'
