caption: The schematic diagram of drug-loaded microneedles for the treatment of HS.
  Microneedles were prepared using biological materials and botanical drugs, which
  could establish many micro-dermal channels to accurately promote the penetration
  of drugs into the dermis and hypodermis. The Wnt ligand is a secreted glycoprotein
  that binds to Frizzled receptors, leading to the formation of a cell surface complex
  (Wnt-bound Frizzled combined with coreceptor LRP5/6), and β-catenin is subsequently
  activated and stabilized. The activated β-catenin can stimulate the transcription
  of Wnt target genes and the expression of fibrosis-related genes and promote the
  formation of collagen Ⅰ and Ⅲ to increase the HS formation. JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway is essential in inhibiting apoptosis and tissue fibrosis. STAT3 is highly
  expressed in HS tissues. The application of Shikonin soluble hyaluronic acid microneedle
  could enhance the therapeutic effect of HS by down-regulating fibrosis-related genes
  to reduce the viability and proliferation of fibroblasts. The quercetin-loaded microneedle
  complex could improve the therapeutic effect on HS potentially by inhibiting the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reducing STAT3 expression, and inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway. The above microneedles could improve the anti-HS efficacy of
  the botanical drugs.
