caption: Our results suggest that AZD6244-induced up-regulation of Bim is mediated
  by FOXO3a, which is regulated through both the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. In
  sensitive cells, MEK inhibition is sufficient to induce expression of the downstream
  molecule, Bim, and to induce apoptosis. However, in resistant cells, in which the
  PI3K/AKT/FOXO3a pathway is constitutively activated, suppression of ERK is insufficient
  to induce apoptosis because of suppression of Bim expression.
