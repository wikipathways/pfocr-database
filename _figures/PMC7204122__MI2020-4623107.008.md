caption: Merged network showing the interplay between IL6-mediated signaling and interaction,
  binding, and adhesion of endothelial cells. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA),
  a merged network was generated by connecting genes known to be central for IL6-mediated
  signaling (IL6, IL6R, IL6ST, STAT3, JAK1, JAK2, and SOCS3) with 42 differentially
  regulated genes extracted from the enriched functions related to binding, adhesion,
  and interaction of endothelial cells which were predicted to be activated by IL6
  knockdown. Downregulated genes are indicated in green while upregulated genes are
  indicated in red using a fold change of 1.5 and Benjamini-Hochberg's estimated false discovery rate
  < 0.05. Grey symbols indicate expressed genes which were not differentially regulated
  after IL6 knockdown, while white symbols indicate nonexpressed genes. Purple lines
  indicate the interaction between genes known to be central for IL6 signaling.
