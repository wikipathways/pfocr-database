caption: IL-6 pathway promotes RCC development. IL-6 (pink stars) binds first to the
  membrane-bound non-signaling IL-6R (green diamonds). Non-signaling IL-6R is activated
  as IL-6R (green square), which can be signal transduced. After recruitment of 2
  gp130 (brown-colored rectangular squares) molecules, the signaling complex is formed
  and signal transduction is induced (brown-colored squares represent ‘dimerization
  of gp130’). Signaling via membrane-bound IL-6R can promote the development of RCC
  by activating STAT3, a potential regulator of HIF-1-mediated VEGF expression transcription.
  This may be associated with the proliferation of RCC. Human NEU3 plays an important
  role in cell differentiation and transmembrane signal transduction, and its expression
  is associated with IL-6. NEU3 is sensitive to IL-6 signaling via the PI3K pathway.
  Overexpression of NEU3 can enhance the action of IL-6, inhibit apoptosis and promote
  cell migration. IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-6R, IL-6 receptor; RCC, renal cell carcinoma;
