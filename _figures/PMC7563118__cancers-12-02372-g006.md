caption: 'A working model illustrating the role of CXCR4-LASP1 axis in promoting the
  stabilization of nuclear Snail1. Left panel: A proposed model illustrating the cellular
  situation when CXCL12 is absent—In the absence of any activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12,
  the constitutively phosphorylated LASP1 at S146 (pS146-LASP1) is bound to inactive,
  unliganded CXCR4 at the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of Snail1 by GSK-3β on
  specific residues results in cytosolic localization of Snail1. Cytoplasmic Snail1
  undergoes additional phosphorylation by GSK-3β, which marks Snail1 for ubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Gene expression of E-cadherin is not repressed
  by Snail1, though repression by other transcription factors such as ZEB1 is not
  ruled out. This happens in epithelial cancer cells. Right panel: Activation of CXCR4
  by CXCL12 leads to the phosphorylation of LASP1 at Y171 and translocation of LASP1.
  Additionally, active CXCR4 induces phosphorylation/activation of Akt (pS473-AKT)
  through the PI3K pathway, which traverses to the nucleus and initiates the phosphorylation/inhibition
  of nuclear GSK-3β (pS9-GSK-3β). Concurrently, the CXCR4 signaling increases the
  nuclear levels of A20 and LSD1. Each of these proteins induces the stabilization
  of Snail1 in a variety of ways. A20 mediates monoubiquitination of Snail1 thus reducing
  its affinity for GSK-3β. Nuclear shuttled LASP1 and elevated LSD1 level may physically
  shield Snail1 and prevent access of GSK-3β to Snail1. The association of pLASP1
  with Snail1, pAKT, A20 and LSD1 in the form of several complexes of differing compositions
  will protect and stabilize Snail1. The stabilized Snail1 represses the promoter
  region of E-cadherin. This happens in mesenchymal cancer cells. Snail1: Snail family
  transcriptional repressor; LASP1: LIM and SH3 protein 1; Akt: Protein kinase B;
  GSK-3β: Glycogen synthase kinase-3β; LSD1: lysine-specific histone demethylase 1;
  A20: TNF-α induced protein 3; E-cad: E-cadherin; Ub: Ubiquitination.'
