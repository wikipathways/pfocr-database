caption: 'Signaling cascades initiated via TLR2- and TLR4-dependent activation. Engagement
  of TLR2 on the cell surface as a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6 leads to the
  recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88 and interaction with TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein (TIRAP) via death-domain interactions. Subsequently, IL-1-receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK) and tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) are recruited,
  leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory-κB (IκB), allowing
  the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and subsequent induction of target genes such
  as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2).
  The adaptor molecule MD-2 is involved in TLR4-mediated activation, which can lead
  to the recruitment of either of two adaptor proteins: the MyD88-dependent pathway
  occurs as described for TLR2; however, an alternative pathway has recently been
  identified. Upon TLR4 activation, the adaptor protein TRIF-related adaptor molecule
  (TRAM) can be activated, which associates with TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  IFN-β (TRIF). This complex activates IKKε and interacts with TBK-1 to induce translocation
  of the IFN-inducible transcription factor interferon response factor-3 (IRF-3) to
  the nucleus, where it transcriptionally activates IFN-inducible genes, such as IFN-β
  and IFN-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10). Figure adapted from Microbes and Infection,
