caption: 'Visualization of metabolites that are significantly changed (adjusted p-value
  < 0.05) in the salt-stressed sample NaCl on the KEGG metabolic pathway map using
  Pathway Projector (Kono et al., ). Color code for pathway categories: aqua represents
  glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, blue represents carbohydrate metabolism, green
  represents lipid metabolism, red represents nucleotide metabolism, purple represents
  energy metabolism, yellow represents amino acid metabolism, pink represents metabolism
  of cofactors and vitamins, dark red represents biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
  orange represents metabolism of other amino acids, and magenta represents biodegradation
  and metabolism of xenobiotics. Blue circles indicate a decrease and red circles
  an increase in the salt-stressed sample compared to the control. Orange circles
  depict metabolites only found in the salt stress sample, whereas cyan circles depict
  metabolites only found in the control sample. Size indicates the relative increase
  but is cut off at 3 due to overlay issues. Pairwise comparison of (A) control and
  NaCl relative to control, (B) control and MgSO4 relative to control, and (C) NaCl
  and MgSO4 relative to NaCl.'
