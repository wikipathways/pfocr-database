caption: Colorectal cancer metastasis signaling pathway. This pathway ranked fifth
  and second significantly affected canonical pathway in Dukes’ B and C, respectively.
  The key altered genes identified in both groups were circled in red, genes only
  altered in Dukes’ B were circled in blue and gene only altered in Dukes’ C was circled
  in yellow. Data were analyzed through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis
  (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen. com/ingenuity).
