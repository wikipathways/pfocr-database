caption: Pathways involved in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) osteogenic differentiation.
  Wnt/β-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β) cascades are the main signaling pathways leading to MSCs osteogenic differentiation.
  Wnt/β-catenin induces MSCs osteogenic differentiation through β-catenin translocation
  into the nucleus, leading to the expression of target genes, including RUNX2. TGF-β
  and BMP through the binding with their respective receptors lead to the activation
  of Smad-dependent and -independent cascades. In TGF-β Smad-dependent signaling,
  Smad2/3 is phosphorylated upon ligand-receptor binding and interacts with Smad4,
  leading to its migration into nucleus. Here, this complex induces RUNX2 expression
  interacting with CBP and P300 co-activators. Smad2/3 without Smad4 interaction,
  forms a complex with HDAC4/5, blocking RUNX2 expression. Unphosphorylated Smad2/3
  is degraded by ubiquitination. In BMP Smad-dependent pathway, BMPs receptors of
  type I and II (BMPR-I and BMPR-II) are activated by their ligands and lead to Smad1/5/8
  phosphorylation. These molecules form a complex with Smad4 and move into the nucleus,
  acting as transcriptional regulator of target genes, including RUNX2 and Osterix
  (OSX). Unphosphorylated Smad1/5/8 is degraded by ubiquitination. This Smad-dependent
  cascade also comprises Smad6/7 and Smurf1/2, which are negative regulators of this
  pathway. In Smad-independent cascade, TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways promote the maturation
  and proliferation of osteoblasts inducing DLX5, RUNX2 and OSX phosphorylation through
  a cascade that comprises TAK1-TAB complex, ERK and p38. This figure was made by
  using the BioRender online tool (www.biorender.com).
