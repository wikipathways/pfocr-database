caption: Unified biosynthetic pathway for the anthraquinone-fused enediynes and the
  post-enediyne polyketide synthase tailoring steps for TNM A (3) biosynthesis as
  revealed by the isolation of TNM B (8) and TNM E (9), from the ΔtnmL mutant strain
  S. sp. SB20020, TNM F (10) and TNM C (11), from the ΔtnmH mutant strain S. sp. SB20002,
  and TNM D (13), as well as shunt metabolites supporting the intermediacy of TNM
  G (12), from wild-type S. sp. CB03234. Paths I and II highlight different timing
  of TnmL in installing the hydroxyl groups at C-6 and C-7 and of TnmH in installing
  the methyl group at the hydroxyl group of C-7, respectively, and in vitro characterization
  of TnmH in the current study supports path I.
