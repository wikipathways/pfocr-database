caption: After hepatic uptake through OCT1, the mitochondria is the primary target
  of metformin which exerts specific and AMPK-independent inhibition of respiratory-chain
  complex 1. The resultant mild decrease in energy status leads to acute and transient
  inhibition of energy-consuming gluconeogenic pathway. In addition, through AMPK-dependent
  and -independent regulatory points, metformin can lead to the inhibition of glucose
  production by disrupting gluconeogenesis gene expression. In parallel, the LKB1-dependent
  activation of AMPK triggered by ATP depletion could reduce hepatic lipogenesis and
  exert an indirect effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity to control hepatic glucose
  output.
