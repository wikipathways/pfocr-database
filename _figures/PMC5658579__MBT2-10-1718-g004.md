caption: 'Metabolic pathway for pyomelanin production in Pseudoalteromonas. Four genes
  participating in the l‐tyrosine catabolic pathway were found in the Pseudoalteromonas
  genome: two of these genes, melA and fahA, are located on chromosome I, and the
  other two, hmgA and maiA, are located on chromosome II. Inactivation of the hmgA
  gene could lead to accumulation of the intermediate homogentisic acid, and auto‐oxidization
  of homogentisic acid would lead to the production of extracellular pyomelanin.'
