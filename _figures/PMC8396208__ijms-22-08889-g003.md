caption: 'Molecular pathways for the action of GDF15 in myocardial protection as a
  result of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. GDF15
  has a local cardioprotective role due to its autocrine/paracrine functions. GDF15
  expression is highly induced in cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion. GDF15
  is an inhibitor of leukocyte activation and recruitment by direct interference with
  chemokine signaling and integrin activation. GDF15 activates nitric oxide: NOS/NO/nuclear
  factor κB (NFκB) pathway and among the forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors:
  Foxo3. This induces an antioxidant action and promotes neovascularization. The development
  of atherosclerotic plaques is driven by endothelial dysfunction, oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein (oxLDL) in association with recruitment of monocytes. GDF15 is highly
  expressed in plaques. GDF15 protects the vessel against injury and oxidative stress
  thanks to its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties (+: activation; ↓:
