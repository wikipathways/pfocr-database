caption: Working model describing the regulative and functional pathway linking R120GCRYAB,
  thioredoxin system (TS), and aggregate growth. CRYAB, a small heat shock protein,
  is found in the supernatant/soluble (S) fraction of protein tissue extract while
  R120GCRYAB, a mutant form of CRYAB that is responsible for aggregate-prone cardiomyopathy,
  is found in addition in the insoluble/pellet (P) fraction (45%), where the aggregates
  accumulate. R120GCRYAB was shown to cause Nrf2 activation (46), which, in turn,
  could explain the elevated expression of Trx1. ICAT data revealed an increased reduced/oxidized
  peptide ratio, which also impacted the redox status of Trx1 ratio. Elevated TrxR1
  activity was likely involved in this phenomenon. The present study identified acetylation
  modification of TrxR1 as a key mechanism of regulation under the control of HDAC3.
  HDAC3 interacts with TrxR1, which itself interacts with the mutant R120GCRYAB. HDAC3
  expression was increased by regulatory mechanisms that remain to be discovered.
  TrxR1 activity is continuously stimulated and required to counter aggregate development.
  The underlying molecular mechanism could involve potential TrxR1 substrates, such
  as BAG3, which is much more reduced in hR120GTg samples and is known to exert an
  inhibiting effect on aggregate growth (20). Inset recapitulates the protein–protein
  interactions identified experimentally by IP and yeast two hybrid, which are built
  from the R120GCRYAB soluble fraction and could occur simultaneously or sequentially.
  Nrf2, nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2. To see this illustration in color,
