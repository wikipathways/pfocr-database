caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway. In the presence of various cytoplasmic
  DNAs, as a natural immunosensor, cGAS can bind to dsDNA to form a 2:2 cGAS-dsDNA
  complex, generating a second messenger cGAMP, which activates the STING protein
  at the endoplasmic reticulum. STING is then transferred from the endoplasmic reticulum
  via ERGIC to the Golgi apparatus, palmitoylated at two cysteine residues Cys88 and
  Cys91. Modified STING recruits TBK1 and IRF3. At the same time, STING also binds
  and stimulates IKK, triggering the transcriptional activation of NF-kB. Ultimately,
  it regulates the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
  IFN. Binding of IFN to IFNAR1/IFNAR2 activates JAK1, phosphorylates STAT, and induces
  the expression of ISG. Created with BioRender.com.
