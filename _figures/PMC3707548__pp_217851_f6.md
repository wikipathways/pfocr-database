caption: 'Pathway map of the primary metabolism showing genetic correlations between
  metabolites detected in the  population. Edges with positive genetic correlations
  are displayed in red, whereas edges with negative genetic correlations are displayed
  in blue. Corresponding correlation values are placed next to the edges, and significant
  correlations (P < 0.05) are marked with asterisks. Metabolites colored in pale gray
  were not measured in this study. Metabolites with mapped  are displayed in boldface,
  and colocalizations with agronomic traits are visualized using boxes A to F; red
  boxes indicate a positive genetic correlation, and blue boxes indicate a negative
  genetic correlation, of the metabolite with the agronomic traits of this particular
  cluster (according to the clusters of agronomic traits in ). Boxes are as follows:
  A, leaf rolling, screening L2.2, grain size G2.2, glaucousness, thermal time to
  heading, days to senescence; B, tiller number, number of aborted tillers, head length,
  crown rot symptom severity; C, chlorophyll content, fertile spikes per seed, grain
  size G2.8, total seeds per spike; E, grains per m2, grain yield; F, harvest index,
  peduncle length, flag leaf length, test weight, thousand grain weight, spikes per
  m2. The image was made using a modified author-created pathway map in VANTED ().'
