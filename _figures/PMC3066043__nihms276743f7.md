caption: Muscle aging is characterized by protein damage and accumulation of cytoplasmic
  aggregates. Loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) associates with the progressive
  decrease in muscle strength and can affect the lifespan of the organism. Pten/FOXO
  signaling induces multiple targets, including several folding chaperones and the
  regulator of protein translation 4E-BP. FOXO/4E-BP activity regulates muscle proteostasis
  at least in part via the autophagy/lysosome pathway of protein degradation, preserves
  muscle function, and extends lifespan. In addition, FOXO/4E-BP signaling in muscles
  decreases feeding behavior that, similar to fasting, results in reduced Insulin
  release from producing cells. This in turn promotes FOXO and 4E-BP activity in other
  tissues, preserving proteostasis organism-wide and mitigating systemic aging.
