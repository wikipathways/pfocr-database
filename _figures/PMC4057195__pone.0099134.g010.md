caption: 'VitC activates the classic ERK1/2 signaling pathway and causes the dissociation
  of Nrf2 from Keap1, which activates HO-1 gene expression after nuclear translocation
  by binding to the HO-1 AREs. The over-expression of HO-1, known as “preconditioning”,
  protects against HS related intestinal injury by inhibiting the inflammatory response,
  neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis. Legend: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; RAS,
  synaptic Ras-GTPase-activating protein; RAF (known as MAPK3), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK); MEK (known as MAPK2); MAPK kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; Nrf2, NF-E2-related
  factor 2; ARE, antioxidant response element; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; Znpp-IX, zinc
  protoporphyrin-IX.'
