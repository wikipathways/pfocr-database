caption: Interconnection between ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TRPV-1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for entry into lung epithelial cells and the host
  cell serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming the S protein. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may interact
  with TRPV-1 through the activation of COX-2 and kininogen pathways. - COX-2 pathway
  (green pathway). TRPV-1 sensitization is due to the interaction between TRPV-1 and
  EP receptors (i.e., EP1 and EP3) stimulated by the increase of PGE2 levels in the
  lungs of affected COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 interaction with neuroinflammatory
  cells increases levels of PGE2 a potent inflammatory mediator that is generated
  by COX-2 conversion of arachidonic acid.- kininogen pathway (red pathway). TRPV-1
  sensitization is due to the interaction between TRPV-1 and BK receptors (i.e,. BKB1
  and BKB2) stimulated by the increase of BK levels in the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 interaction
  with neuroinflammatory cells increases levels of BK, referred to as a “Bradykinin
  Storm.” BK is produced from an inactive pre-protein kininogen through activation
  by the serine protease kallikrein. The upregulation of ACE2 in patients with severe
  symptoms of COVID-19 increases Angiotensin 1–9 levels that in turn raise the levels
  of BK. High levels of PM in air pollution, such as DEP, directly interact with TRPV-1
  (gray arrow) by modulating its activity and increasing its sensitization. This interaction
  could worsen the outcome of COVID-19 disease in affected patients. Adapted from
