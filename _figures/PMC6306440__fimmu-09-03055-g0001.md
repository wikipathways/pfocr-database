caption: Abnormalities in the DNA damage repair pathway in T cells of rheumatoid arthritis
  patients. DNA stability is critical for the function of T cells. Na誰ve T cells from
  RA patients have ATM deficiency, which impairs the cells' ability to detect and
  repair DNA lesions. T cells alternatively upregulate DNA-PKcs. The activated DNA-PKcs-JNK-Bim
  axis eventually forces na誰ve T cells into apoptosis. Moreover, there is insufficient
  activation of the ATM kinase, hTERT, and MRE11A in RA-associated T cells after T
  cell receptor stimulation, which accelerates the G2/M checkpoint bypass and hyperproliferation.
  Unrepaired DNA breaks and telomere erosion finally induce T cell death and senescence.
  To compensate for the T cell pool, naive cells are forced into homeostatic clonal
  expansion, which facilitates the section of autoreactive T cell.
