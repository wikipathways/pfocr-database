caption: 'Intermediates or initiators for the three major hypotheses for AD are shown
  in color: purple for the amyloid hypothesis, green for the tauopathy hypothesis
  and fuscia for the neuroinflammatory/cytokine hypothesis. Sites where reactive oxygen
  species are thought to be directly involved are in blue. In cognitively normal individuals,
  Aβ produced in endosomes is cleared or it may form fibrils and be sequestered into
  extracellular plaques in the brain. Although found in familial and sporadic AD,
  plaques may also be found in cognitively normal subjects and thus by themselves
  do not cause dementia. Changes in the form of soluble Aβ, arising from oxidation
  or other modifications, produce a more rod-inducing and synaptotoxic form. Other
  initiators of sporadic AD, such as neuroinflammatory cytokines, initiate a moderate
  ROS response that leads to rods and greater amounts of Aβ production in a feed-forward
  pathway. We hypothesize that rod-induced microtubule disruption releases tau for
  phosphorylation and initiation of PHF-tau formation, although this could be directly
  mediated by altered signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from many possible
  sources eventually produces high ROS levels that contribute to cofilin oxidation
  (two internal disulfide bonds) that target it to mitochondria and cause release
  of cytochrome c, initiating apoptosis. Since rods are reversible, cofilin-induced
  apoptosis may gradually increase during cycles of rod reversal and acute high ROS
  levels.'
