caption: Schematic illustration of the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. The entry
  of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells starts with the binding of S proteins with the receptor
  ACE2. The host cell surface protease TMPRSS2 activates S protein, which triggers
  fusion of the viral and host plasma membranes. SARS-CoV-2 can also enter the cell
  via endocytosis. In this pathway, the fusion of viral and lysosomal membranes is
  triggered by cathepsins. The autoproteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins pp1a
  and pp1ab generates 16 Nsps with various functions. The RTCs anchor on DMVs, which
  appear to originate from the ER. The viral RNAs are stored in DMVs and transported
  to the cytosol for translation or viral assembly via double-membrane–spanning pores.
  Viral particles are assembled in the ER and/or ERGIC. The virions traffic to late
  endosomes/lysosomes and egress via the lysosomal exocytosis pathway.
