caption: 'Events after colorectal surgery leading to AL. Surgical injury following
  colorectal resection in combination with perioperative interventions (MBP, opioids,
  and radiotherapy) trigger the release of various host-derived factors. These factors
  interfere with the intestinal microbiota at the anastomotic site causing shifts.
  Physiologically, microbiota promotes colonic cell proliferation and epithelial healing
  and enhances the integrity of the intestinal barrier, mainly through the stimulation
  of TLRs, release of SCFAs (e.g. butyrate), and interaction with FPR1 and NOX1 causing
  the release of ROS and upregulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. However, the deleterious
  effects of the aforementioned factors result in reduction of beneficial members
  of microbiota, thus suppressing normal wound healing. Moreover, several pathogens
  are increased demonstrating virulence activation and altered genotype. These effects
  lead to bacterial invasion through failure of epithelial tight junctions, collagenolysis
  through the activation of MMP-9, and cytotoxicity. The transformation of the intestinal
  microbiota into a “pathobiome” results in aberrant immunity and inflammatory response,
  which impair the proper epithelial restitution, eventually leading to the pathogenesis
  of AL. AL: anastomotic leakage; Col: collagen; EC: epithelial cell; ERK: extracellular
