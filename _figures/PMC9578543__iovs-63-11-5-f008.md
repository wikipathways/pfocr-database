caption: The RASA1 signaling pathway mediates apoptosis. RASA1 signaling has anti-apoptotic
  and cell death-inducing effects. The specific mechanism of action leads to the partial
  cleavage of RasGAP into fragment C and fragment N. When an organism suffers from
  mild stress, fragment N activates BCL-2, which generates an anti-apoptotic response
  and inhibits the further response to apoptosis. However, when an organism suffers
  from stronger stress, fragment C will be activated, leading to an apoptotic response
  in the downstream BAD and cell death.
