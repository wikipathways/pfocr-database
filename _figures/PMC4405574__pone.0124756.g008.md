caption: Individual antagonist treatments evidenced PR and ER gene regulation pathways,
  meanwhile combined antagonist treatment highlights the existence of P and E receptors
  pathways interaction. ONA +ICI treatment restores ISs development by the activation
  of ¨compensatory pathways¨. This failsafe road could include regulation of Hand2,
  Bmp2 expression, ERK activation and/or unidentified signaling molecules (X). Arrows
  heads, positive regulation; blunt heads, negative regulation; point head; undefined
  regulation; black fill line, interactions evidenced in this work; red dot line,
  pathways proposed.
