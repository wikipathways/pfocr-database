caption: Functions of FSH signaling in SC proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
  Binding of FSH to FSHR recruits Gɑs to FSHR, activating AC. AC transforms ATP into
  cAMP, and cAMP binds to regulatory subunits of PKA to release catalytic subunits
  of PKA. Activated PKA induces the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 to promote SC
  proliferation (red). c-Myc expression is also upregulated by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  The cAMP/PKA/ERK pathway leads to the expression of Cyclin D1 only during SC proliferation.
  Through an unknown pathway, FSH induces the expression of HIF2 to promote c-Myc
  and Cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, inter-SC junction dynamics are also mediated
  by FSH signaling (green). FSH induces tPA expression via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway
  and three components of the BTB, N-cadherin, ɑ6β1-integrin and claudin 11, through
  an unknown pathway. Combined with testosterone, FSH stimulates Gja expression via
  the Wnt3 pathway. Additionally, FSH participates in SC differentiation (blue). Klf4,
  NF-κB and ASNS expression are mediated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. HIF1 and
  Aqp8 expression are mediated by an unknown pathway. HIF1 mainly participates in
  the glycolytic pathway, and Aqp8 is important for water balance. Finally, the cAMP/PKA-mediated
  balance of FAAH and DAX1 maintains normal SC apoptosis (orange). The dotted line
  represents an unknown mechanism. For more information, please see the main text
