caption: 'Frizzled receptors can form complex with LRP in a manner of transmembrane
  protein and then the extracellular Wnt protein is combined with the complex, making
  the signal transmitted into cells. Following this, Axin/APC/GSK-3β complex is formed
  and combined with β-catenin, which leads to the activation of β-catenin through
  phosphorylation. Activation of β-catenin (transferring from cytoplasm to nucleus)
  thereby commits to the transcription of the target genes in the downstream, such
  as PPAR-γ and CEBPα. For the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway, Wnt binds to Frizzled receptors
  on the surface of cells and subsequently delivers signals into the cells to activate
  the downstream GTPase Rho and JNK, thus participating in the cytoskeleton and regulation
  of downstream genes of JNK signaling. SFRPS is capable of preventing the binding
  of Wnt and Frizzled proteins through its combination with Wnt protein, thus blockading
  the Wnt signaling, inhibiting the phosphorylation activation of β-catenin, and the
  transcription of the target genes (PPAR-γ and CEBPα) in the downstream. In addition,
  SFRPS has the ability to repress the JNK signaling via its combination with Wnt5a,
  leading to the suppression of TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6; as a result, the pro-inflammatory
  response and insulin resistance are reduced. Abbreviation: IL-6, interleukin-6.'
