caption: In the absence of a Wnt signal, the destruction complex containing adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and casein kinase 1α/ε
  (CK1α/ε) on an axin-conductin scaffold targets the degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin
  in a proteasome-dependent manner. In the nucleus, Wnt target genes are also kept
  silent by the repressor Groucho interacting with DNA-bound T cell factor (TCF).
  In the presence of a Wnt ligand, occupancy of the receptors Frizzled (Frz) and coreceptor
  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) triggers the phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic tail of LRP by CK1 and GSK-3β as well as the disheveled (Dsh)-dependent
  recruitment of axin on phosphorylated LRP. Phosphorylation of β-catenin no longer
  occurs, and the increased cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin translocate to the nucleus,
  where the transcription of multiple genes is initiated through displacement of Groucho
  and the interaction of β-catenin with the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (LEF) family of transcription factors.
