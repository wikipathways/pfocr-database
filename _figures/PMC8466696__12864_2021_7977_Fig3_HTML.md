figtitle: Comparison of the transcriptome in circulating leukocytes in early lactation
  between primiparous and multiparous cows provides evidence for age-related changes
organisms:
- Mus musculus

- Drosophila melanogaster
- Caenorhabditis elegans
- Homo sapiens
- Bos taurus

caption: David functional annotation Cluster 4 contained many genes (shown in blue)
  in the Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis KEGG pathway which were more highly expressed
  in MP > 3 vs PP cows (figure drawn by the authors). This would potentially maximise
  the use of glucose as a precursor of acetyl CoA for use in the TCA cycle
