caption: 'Testosterone, the major driver of prostate cell proliferation and survival,
  is synthesized by the testis under the control of LH, which is regulated by the
  hypothalamus/pituitary axis. De novo testosterone then reaches the prostate and
  is converted into more potent DHT form by the enzyme 5-α reductase. Either T or
  DHT forms a complex with AR, which then binds with an AR-specific DNA sequence and
  induces transcription of genes. Since 1941 various strategies were developed to
  inhibit the AR signaling axis in prostate cancer. A surgical procedure to remove
  the testis, to eliminate the source of T. The drugs which act on various organs
  are indicated in red. Part of the figure icons are obtained from Servier Medical
