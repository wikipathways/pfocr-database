caption: Hypothetical model of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle arrest gene
  p21 by ZBTB5. A, p53 pathway and ZBTB5 targets. ZBTB5 represses transcription of
  the HDM2 and p21 genes. Solid line with arrowhead (→), transcriptional activation;
  solid line with ⊥, transcriptional repression. Solid line with double arrowhead
  (↔), molecular interaction. B, hypothetical model of transcriptional repression
  of p21 by ZBTB5 under three different cellular conditions. ZBTB5 represses transcription
  of cell cycle arrest gene p21 by binding to the two distal p53 binding elements
  by competition with p53. ZBTB5 also binds to the proximal Sp1 binding GC-box 5/6,
  with an unclear function in the transcriptional repression of the endogenous p21
  gene by ZBTB5. ZBTB5 recruits co-repressor-HDAC complexes, which deacetylate histones
  Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 at the proximal promoter to repress transcription. Tsp +1, transcription
  start site. ZF, zinc finger DNA binding domain. ×, transcription repression.
