caption: (A) MiR-184 regulates human module gene through TF and ncRNA, then participates
  in hydatidosis-related signaling pathways. The diamond represents ncRNA, the arrow
  represents TF, the circle represents target gene, and the square represents pathway.
  (B) MiR-184 regulates canine modules gene through TF, then participates in hydatidosis-related
  signaling pathways. The diamond represents ncRNA, the arrow represents TF, the circle
  represents target gene, and the square represents pathway. (C) Box plot showing
  qPCR validation of key genes. Red represents case group, blue represents control
  group.
