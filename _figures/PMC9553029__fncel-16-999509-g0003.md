caption: The biological mechanisms of NMDARs in the TG underlying regulating peripheral
  sensitization of orofacial pain. NMDARs are involved in the activation of chronic
  orofacial pain-related intracellular signaling pathways and the communication among
  the neuronal and satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the TG. NR1 forms a complex with
  α2δ-1 in the TGNeurons (TGNs) and activates SGCs, and the α2δ-1-NR1 complex is upregulated
  after trigeminal nerve injury, α2δ-1 may regulate NR1 expression through PKC. NR1-Src-Panx1
  signal pathway distributes in the TGNs and SGCs contributes to orofacial neuropathic
  pain following trigeminal nerve injury. Activation of NMDARs results in phosphorylation
  of TRPV1, primarily at serine residues through the activation of PKC and CaMKII
  pathways in rat trigeminal sensory neurons, and NMDAR and TRPV1 interactions are
  essential for the development of mechanical hyperalgesia in the masseter muscle
  after inflammation. NR2B/CaMKII acts as an upstream cascade to facilitate cAMP production
  and ERK-CREB activation in the TG after inflammatory and nerve injury.
