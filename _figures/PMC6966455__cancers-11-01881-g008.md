caption: The signaling pathway involved in GR cells with ROCK2 inhibition. In GR cells,
  phosphorylated ROCK2 activated p38 and promoted p-p38 translocated into the nucleus.
  P-p38 enhanced ZEB1 transcription through phosphorylating sp1 and promoting sp1
  binding to the ZEB1 promoter region. ZEB1 decreased sensitivity of pancreatic cancer
  cells by repairing gemcitabine-mediated DNA damage. However, when ROCK2 signal was
  inhibited, p38/sp1/ZEB1 signaling was blocked, and ZEB1-induced gemcitabine resistance
  of GR cells was reversed.
