caption: 'Hypothetical mechanisms of the intracellular pathways underlying the results
  found in this study. Schematic model showing possible intracellular mechanisms for
  the neuroprotective effects of 5-HT1A receptor activation. In our study, the mechanism
  underlying the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in the glaucoma condition is as follows:
  adenylate cyclase is activated, which increases cAMP formation and consequently
  increases PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation, thus reducing fast neurotransmitter
  GABA release. Activation of the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor by 8-OH-DPAT inhibits
  this cascade reaction via the Gi/o protein, increasing GABA release from presynaptic
  GABAergic amacrine cells. Therefore, the release of GABA can neutralize the activity
  of excitotoxicity in glaucoma.'
