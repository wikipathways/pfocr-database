caption: 'BACH1 regulates key genes involved in central carbon metabolic pathways
  of cancer cells. BACH1 enhances glycolysis pathway by activating expression of HK2
  and GAPDH mRNA, while it suppresses mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting PDH activity
  through PDK regulation and expression of the subunit’s genes of mitochondrial ETC
  complex (I–V) that are coupled to the TCA cycle. (Abbreviations: Gly-3P; glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, 1,3-BPG; 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, PEP; phosphoenol pyruvate, PDK;
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, PDH; pyruvate dehydrogenase, aKG; alpha ketoglutarate,
  HK2; hexokinase, GAPDH; glyceraldehyde 3-phospho dehydrogenase, ETC; electron transport
