caption: 'Complement activation pathways. There are three routes by which the complement
  system can become activated: the classical, the lectin and the alternative pathways.
  Classical pathway activation is initiated primarily by antigen-antibody immune complexes.
  C1q of the C1 complex (C1q, C1r and C1s) interacts with the fragment crystallistion
  (Fc) portion of antigen-bound immunoglobulins, activating C1r, which subsequently
  cleaves and activates C1s. Activated C1s cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b, and C2 into
  C2a and C2b leading to assembly of C4bC2a, the C3 convertase. Carbohydrate-based
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) trigger activation of the lectin
  pathway. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins or collectins recognise PAMPs, activating
  MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Similar to the classical pathway, C4 and
  C2 are cleaved to generate C4bC2a. The classical and lectin complement activation
  pathways converge at this point to cleave C3 into the potent anaphylatoxin C3a,
  and C3b, which joins the C3 convertase to form C4bC2aC3b, the C5 convertase. Cleavage
  of C5 yields the C5a anaphylatoxin and C5b, which polymerises with C6, C7, C8 and
  C9 to form the membrane-attack complex (MAC). This inserts into target cell membranes
  to induce lysis. Spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 into C3H2O occurs in the alternative
  pathway. Cleavage of factor B (FB) by factor D yields Bb, which associates with
  C3H2O to form a C3 convertase. Cleavage of C3 and FB produces C3b and Bb, respectively.
  The binding of properdin to microbial surfaces recruits C3b, facilitating the assembly
  of the C3 convertase (C3bBb), and initiating pathway activation. Subsequent cleavage
  of C3 produces C3b, which combines with the C3 convertase to form a C5 convertase
  (C3bBbC3b). From this point, the terminal pathway is initiated to assemble the MAC,
  similarly to the classical and lectin pathways. Complement activation is regulated
  at various stages of the pathways by several membrane-bound complement regulatory
  proteins (Complement receptor 1 (CR1), CD46, CD55 and CD59) and circulating factors
  (C1-inhibitor (C1-INH), factor H (FH), factor I (FI), C4-binding protein (C4BP),
  clusterin and vitronectin), which are depicted in red, and properdin, which stabilises
  the alternative pathway C3 convertase.'
