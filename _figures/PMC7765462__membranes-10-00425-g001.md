caption: The CRAC channel activation pathway and downstream signaling processes. The
  scheme represents the activation pathways in the mast cell subsequent to the binding
  of a ligand to a receptor at the extracellular side. Activation of phospholipase
  C and generation of IP3 leads to store-depletion, activation of STIM1 and subsequent
  STIM1/Orai1 coupling. Ca2+ influx that occurs upon Orai1 opening mediates downstream
  signaling cascades that can lead to gene transcription or release of inflammatory
  mediators such as histamines, eicosanoids, and cytokines.
