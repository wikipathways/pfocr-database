caption: Conceptual diagram of the meta‐ethnography. The couples’ relationship dynamic
  provides the contextual background against which their decision is being made and
  how key decisions are negotiated; this must be weighed up against their attitudes
  to potential treatment side‐effects whilst, at the same time, considering the impact
  of these changes on their everyday lives. This is likely to be affected by access
  to information, quality and robustness of information and the impact of information
  provision. Different types of media may be privileged by couples and differentially
  accessed and weighted even between men and their partners at different stages of
  the disease pathway. The way in which couples seek, identify and potentially share
  information is also intimately linked to the communication styles that already exist
  within the relationship dynamic.
