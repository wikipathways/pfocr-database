  Further down the glycolysis pathway, TAp73 transcriptionally regulates liver type
  phosphofructokinase-1 (PFKL) that enhances glycolysis rate [] and enzymes of the
  serine/glycine biosynthesis [] necessary for cell growth in serine deprivation and
  regulation of pyruvate kinase (PMK2) which activity is associated with lactate production
  and cancerogenesis [, ]. Further, p73 regulates expression of the glutaminase-2,
  which converts glutamine to glutamate influencing glutathione synthesis []
