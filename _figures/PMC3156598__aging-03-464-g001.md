caption: 'Amino acids are degraded to compounds that can be metabolized to CO2 and
  H2O, or used in gluconeogenesis. Indeed the oxidative degradation of amino acids
  produces 10 – 15% of total metabolic energy in animals. The standard amino acids
  are degraded to one among the seven metabolic intermediates (pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate,
  succinyl-CoA, fumarate, oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate). Thus, amino acids
  may be divided into two groups, on the basis of their catabolic pathways: 1) gluconeogenic
  amino acids, which are catabolized to pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate
  or oxaloacetate, and are glucose precursors; 2) ketogenic amino acids, which are
  catabolized to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate, and, thus, may be transformed into fatty
  acids or ketone bodies. Some amino acids are precursors both of carbohydrates and
  ketone bodies. Because mammals have no metabolic pathway which allows a net transformation
  of acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate to gluconeogenic precursors, no net synthesis of carbohydrates
  is possible from lysine and leucine, exclusively ketogenic amino acids. BCAAs, branched-chain
  amino acids.'
