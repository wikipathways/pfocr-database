caption: Combinatorial strategy for therapeutic T cell that integrates activation
  signaling pathway and inhibitory signaling pathway. In the promotion of the activation
  signaling pathway, this design conformation of the modified-T cell can yield safer
  therapeutic function upon the safe platform, including the dual receptor engineering
  T cell and bifunctional molecules. In this system, the T cell that carry two receptors
  can engage the molecules and tumor surface antigens, and the bifunctional molecule
  can target T cells and cancer cells. On the other hand, blocking the inhibitory
  signaling pathway by adding some monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and
  nivolumab with specificity for CTLA-4 and PD-1, respectively, was also found to
  improve the efficacy and persistence of the infused CAR-T cell in vitro and in vivo
