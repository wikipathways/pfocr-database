caption: (A) Co-regulated functions of E2F [14–16, this work], HCF1 , , NRF1/2 ,  are
  associated with cell proliferation (B) E2F, WNT and FGF activities are deeply integrated
  in a self-renewal module of interplay between gene regulation and signal transduction.
  Besides directly targeting genes with the canonical functions of proliferation,
  differentiation and apoptosis, E2F transcriptionally regulate the component genes
  of these signaling pathways with the same functions. Remarkably, WNT pathway is
  engaged in a positive feedback with cell cycle progression . With mitogens and intracellular
  regulators (such as E2F) driving cell cycle progression in hPSCs, a self-feeding
  state of high cell-proliferation may be programmed into hPSCs via the WNT pathway.
  (C) Key components of WNT and FGF pathway are regulated by E2F. The ovals and blocks
  represent key components of the pathways while the black arrows depict direction
  of information flow. E2F target-cohorts (red) and known target genes (black) encoding
  signaling components, are listed beside them. If a gene is both a known target and
  a target-cohort, it is colored red. Known targets include WNT2B, SMARCA3, SMARCA5,
  RRAS, MAP2K7, YHWAE (BIND database), FGF1 , FGF2 , FGF7, PRKCL2, MAP3K7, MAPK3 (ERK1),
  , , SOX2, OCT4, NANOG . Genes denoted with ‘**’ are experimentally verified in this
  study to be regulated by E2F (Luciferase-based assay) while those with ‘*’ are experimentally
  shown to be differentially expressed (RT-QPCR).
