caption: Model of the ExoR-ExoS/ChvI signal transduction pathway. It is hypothesized
  that the active mature form of ExoR, ExoRm, is digested via slow proteolysis in
  wild-type cells. An increase in ExoR proteolysis triggered by environmental or plant
  signals or mutations in the exoR genes reduces the amount of ExoRm binding to the
  ExoS sensing domain, leading to the activation of ExoS sensor and the activation
  or suppression of expression of the genes regulated by the ExoS/ChvI two-component
  regulatory system.
