caption: The mechanisms of action and signaling pathways of SIRT1 in diabetic nephropathy.
  Diabetes mellitus (DM) can inhibit SIRT1 expression by increased expression of miR-34a-5p,
  miR-221, miR-9, miR-133b, miR-155-5p, and miR-199b. HIC1 can repress SIRT1 transcription
  in response to HG stimulation via an interaction with EZH2 and Dnmt1. Overexpression
  of SIRT1 can blunt CLDN1/β-catenin-Snail-mediated albuminuria in DN via the deacetylation
  of histones H3 and H4 with subsequent CpG methylation of Cldn1 by recruiting Dnmt1.
  SIRT1 activation can inhibit p66Shc expression to improve oxidative stress in DN
  by deacetylation of acetyl-H3. SIRT1 activation can upregulate miR-29 expression
  by reduction of NF-κB binding to its promotor. Overexpression of miR-29 directly
  targets Keap1 mRNA to decrease Keap1 expression and subsequently increase Nrf2 expression.
  Free Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes with members of the sMaf
  family and binds to ARE within regulatory regions of a wide variety of cell defense
  genes, including GST and NQO1. LincRNA 1700020I14Rik can interact with miR-34a-5p
  to inhibit cell proliferation and fibrosis in DN though the SIRT1/HIF-1α signaling
  pathway. LncRNA GAS5 and SOX2OT can upregulate SIRT1 expression by sponging miR-221
  and miR-9, respectively. SIRT1 can inhibit TGF-β1-induced renal fibrosis and NOX4-induced
  oxidative stress, and stimulate PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis to improve
  DN. Finally, SIRT1 can deacetylate and activate FOXO1 to upregulate the level of
  autophagy, and deacetylate and inhibit p53 to inhibit apoptosis, thus improving
  DN. SIRT1, Sirtuin 1; DM, diabetes mellitus; miR, microRNA; HIC1, hypermethylated
