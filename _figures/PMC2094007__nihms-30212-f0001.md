caption: A. Primary sequence and domain structure for human dysadherin. Dysadherin
  is a single-pass transmembrane protein of 178 amino acids, with a long extracellular
  domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. The highest conservation
  between FXYD family members lies in the region of the FXYD motif and the transmembrane
  domain. Residues that are absolutely conserved between all family members are shown
  in red. The extracellular domain is heavily and heterogeneously glycosylated, carrying
  up to 30KDa of O-linked carbohydrate in some tumor cells. B. Model for dysadherin
  action. Dysadherin predominantly resides in the plasma membrane. There is convincing
  evidence that dysadherin can reduce cell-cell adhesion by blocking expression of
  E-cadherin at a post-transcriptional level, and/or by down-regulating the association
  of E-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton. Dysadherin can also affect invasion and
  metastasis by E-cadherin-independent mechanisms. One such mechanism involves upregulating
  expression of the chemokine CCL2, which then exerts autocrine and paracrine tumor-promoting
  effects in the tumor bed. The detailed molecular mechanisms that couple dysadherin
  expression to down-stream events that promote tumor progression are currently not
  known. However, dysadherin expression is associated with enhanced activity of the
  NFκB pathway in a breast cancer model system. In non-transformed cells, dysadherin
  interacts with and modulates the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase. It remains to be
  determined whether this interaction occurs in tumor cells or what the functional
  consequences may be. Finally, it is likely that dysadherin also regulates the activity
  of additional downstream effector molecules (indicated by X) that have yet to be
  identified.
