caption: Overview of selection strategy. (A) The Dictyostelium UMP synthase, Pyr56,
  is an essential component of the de novo uracil synthesis pathway. However, Pyr56
  also catalyzes the conversion of the prodrug 5-FOA to toxic 5-FU, leading to cell
  death. (B) A fusion protein containing the UMP synthase Pyr56 fused to a polyglutamine-expanded
  fragment of Htt exon 1 and a fluorescent reporter GFP will remain soluble in pyr56-KO
  cells. Following chemical mutagenesis, cells which lose function of a polyglutamine
  aggregation suppressing factor will demonstrate aggregation of the fusion protein.
  Sequestration of Pyr56 activity by protein aggregation confers resistance to 5-FOA,
  allowing for selection of polyQ aggregation mutants.
