caption: Aldh1a2 is the main RALDH isoform expressed in gut-associated DC, although
  Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a3 have also been described in other gut-associated cell types,
  such as IEC and stromal cells. Whereas the mechanisms controlling the expression
  of the latter RALDH isoforms remain to be determined, recent literature show that
  the expression of Aldh1a2 in DC can be modulated by several microenvironmental stimuli.
  In particular, recent evidence indicates that RA itself is necessary and sufficient
  to induce its own synthesis by upregulating Aldh1a2 in DC as a positive feedback
  loop. IEC are among the potential sources of RA to educate DC in the gut, although
  this remains to be demonstrated. In addition, several other factors have been proposed
  to induce Aldh1a2 in DC, including MyD88-dependent TLR2 signals, Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  GM-CSF, and PPARγ-agonists (the latter not shown in the figure). In contrast, PGE2
  acting on EP4 receptor inhibits Aldh1a2 induction in skin-associated DC. However,
  although the critical role of RA in Aldh1a2 induction in gut-associated DC has been
  consistently shown by several groups, the contribution of other factors in physiological
  gut-associated DC education and the intracellular signaling pathways mediating these
  effects (including MyD88, ERK and JNK) are currently less clear. Green and red lines
  indicate induction or inhibition of Aldh1a2 expression, respectively.
