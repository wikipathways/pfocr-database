caption: NLRP3 inflammasome activation and priming. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein
  oligomers of the innate immune system, and their main function is to activate inflammatory
  responses. The Nod-like receptor family, pyrin containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
  pathway is activated by priming and activation, respectively. Binding of PAMPs/DAMPs
  to TLRs results in the activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκβ), caspase-1
  activation and gene transcription. Once the priming step is completed, activation
  of the inflammasome can occur in response to several pathogens or endogenous DAMPs.
  Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 can bind to these receptors to induce an inflammatory response.
