caption: 'Upper panel: In resting conditions, the stress sensors IRE1 and PERK and
  ATF6 interact with Bip/GRP78. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen
  separates the chaperone from each sensor. IRE1α and PERK activation involves oligomerization
  and transphosphorylation of their cytosolic effector region. ATF6 activation, on
  the other hand, requires its transport to the Golgi, where it is sequentially cleaved
  by S1P and S2P. A recent model for IRE1α activation, involves an initial dissociation
  of BiP/GRP78 that drives sensor oligomerization, while subsequent binding to unfolded
  proteins leads to activation. Lower panel: The signaling engaged by the three sensors
  activates several transcription factors (XBP1, ATF4, p50ATF6, NF-κ B, CHOP) and
  protein kinases (JNK, AKT), leading to the establishment of a genetic program termed
  unfolded protein response. This adaptive response involves chaperone induction,
  activation of degradation pathways like the proteasome and autophagy, ER expansion
  and increased antioxidant defense. Also, the PERK pathway inhibits general mRNA
  translation, through eIF2α phosphorylation. If the cell does not reduce the mis-folded
  protein overload, apoptosis is triggered.'
