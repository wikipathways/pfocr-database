caption: Flux distribution in D. vulgaris. Fluxes were estimated from measurements
  taken at mid-log phase (30 to 40 h) and normalized by the average lactate uptake
  rate in log phase (13.8 ± 1.8 mmol h−1 g [dry weight]−1). Solid arrows indicate
  reactions that are active. Dashed arrows indicate that the reaction has zero flux
  based on enzyme and isotopomer data. An “x” indicates the absence of an annotated
  gene for the step. Data in brackets are the exchange coefficients of reactions that
  are significantly reversible based on isotopomer model analysis. Based on the flux
  distribution, partial oxidation of 1 mol of lactate produces ∼2.0 mol of NADH/NADPH
  and ∼0.9 mol of ATP; sulfate reduction () (mol/mol) consumes 1.6 mol of NADH and
  uses 0.8 mol of ATP per mol of lactate to activate sulfate groups.
