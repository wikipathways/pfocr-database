caption: CTLA4 insufficiency may lead to autoimmune tumorigenesis through type 2 inflammatory
  pathways. Professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) activate T cells by providing
  co-stimulation through antigen-loaded MHC and CD80/CD86. CTLA4 negatively regulates
  of T cell activity through at least three mechanisms. CTLA4 can bind to CD80/CD86
  with high affinity and sequester CD80/CD86 from CD28-mediated co-stimulation. Alternatively,
  CTLA4 binding to CD80/CD86 may initiate intrinsic inhibitory signaling in T cells.
  Furthermore, CTLA4, especially with constitutive expression by regulatory T cells,
  binds to CD80/CD86 and removes them from the APC by transendocytosis. CTLA4 insufficiency
  impairs the regulation of T cells, leading to dysregulated type 1, type 2, and type
  3 immunity. The proposed pathway for tumorigenesis focuses on dysregulated IL4/IL13-driven
  type 2 immunity. In secondary lymphoid organs, dysregulated Th2 cell-B cell interaction
  may lead to the development of lymphoma. In mucosal epithelia, type 1 and type 3
  immunity may inflict epithelial damage while type 2 immunity initiates a Th2 cell-epithelial
  cell crosstalk that potentially leads to epithelial cell transformation.
