caption: Multiple signaling pathways are stimulated via circulatory factors as well
  as intrinsic (paracrine and autocrine) cytokines during liver regeneration. After
  an injury, Kupffer cells are stimulated by circulating LPS as well as the complement
  system. Kupffer cells play a major role in initiating hepatocyte transition from
  G0 to G1 phase via induction and release of TNF-α and IL-6. These factors eventually
  initiate multiple pathways within hepatocytes, including NF-κB, JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt,
  and AP1 signaling leading to transcriptional activation. Additionally, Kupffer cells
  also release the activated Wnt ligand that initiates Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. Hepatocyte
  growth factor receptor signaling is initiated via both HGF released from ECM by
  urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), as well as secreted HGF from hepatic stellate
  and endothelial cells. EGF receptor signaling is initiated by EGF primarily derived
  from the Brunner’s gland. EGFR and HGFR signaling feed into the NF-κB and mTOR pathways
  via PI3K-Akt signaling which can be regulated by miR-382. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling
  is initiated by Shh secreted from Stellate cells, which in turn inactivates the
  inhibition of Smo receptor by the Ptch1 receptor. Activation of Smo leads to increased
  accumulation and localization of Gli to the nucleus and transcriptional response.
  Also, during regeneration, YAP predominantly localizes to the nucleus interacting
  with TEAD and β-Catenin proteins to activate transcription of target genes. In the
  regenerating phase, ESRP2 inhibition leads to depletion of the adult and accumulation
  of fetal splice isoforms of core Hippo pathway components (e.g., Yap1, Tead1, Nf2,
  Csnk1d), which suppress Hippo signaling, while promoting nuclear YAP-TEAD interactions
  and transcriptional activities.
