caption: Schematic representation of the epigenetic modification and a hypothetical
  complex transcription. (A) Chromosome, (B) Nucleosome (DNA), (C) Histone, (D) Different
  components involving enzymes, co-activator, repressor and transcription factors
  essential for the histone modification. (E) H3 histone tail and their major component
  of epigenetic factors acetylation (a), methylation (m), and phosphorylation (p).
  (F) Schematic diagram shows pathway involved in the ethanol-induced epigenetic changes
  and role of methylation and leading to the expression of genes and proteins. (1)
  Ethanol exposure of nerve cells (environmental stimuli), (2) these external stimuli
  result in changes in downstream genes and kinase signaling pathway. (3) Histone
  Modification (Acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and their responsible
  enzymes. (4) Transcriptional regulation and gene expression, (5) translation (protein
  expression), (6) altered cellular function. HAT- histrone acetyl transferase; HDAC-
  histone deacetylase; HDM-histone demethylase; HMT-histone methyl transferase. The
  model was adapted and modified from Shukla et al. ().
