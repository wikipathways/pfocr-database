caption: Initiation and mechanisms regulating ferroptosis. Several key factors, including
  cystine uptake, levels of GSH, and activities of Gpx4, act as crucial regulators
  counteracting iron-dependent generation of lipid peroxidation products and preventing
  ferroptosis and plasma membrane damage. One molecule of cystine across plasma membrane
  with an exchange of one molecule of glutamate through cystine-glutamate antiporter
  (System Xc-). Inside the cell, cystine is reduced to cysteine for GSH synthesis.
  GSH is easily oxidized to the disulfide dimer GSSG (oxidized form of glutathione).
  Extracellular iron can be transported to intracellular through transferring protein
  1. Iron as an electron carrier also functions as a redox catalyst in the Fenton
  and Haber-Weiss reactions resulting in the generation of ROS. Mitochondria are critical
  organelle containing ferroptosis-related genes and regulate generation of lipid
  peroxides through the electron-transporting chain. Ferroptotic pathway can be initiated
  by activation of cytokines such as IFN-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 or serum IgG (e.g. in SLE
  patients) leading to the activation of CaMKIV/CREMα axis as an example demonstrated
  in SLE. Binding of CREMα to Gpx4 promoter resulted in suppression of Gpx4 expression
  which regulates biosynthesis of GSH. Gpx4 also catalyzes the reduction of oxidized
  biolipids, that converts toxic lipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols
  through its cofactor GSH. Dysregulation of these factors leads to ferroptosis with
  release of damage-associated molecular patterns like HMGB1 and membrane rupture.
