caption: Schematic illustrating starch synthesis reactions in cereal source and sink
  tissue.(a) Sucrose is produced in source tissues and then transported by SWEETs/SUTs
  transporters into the phloem for delivery to sink tissues. Sucrose controls its
  production by inhibiting trehalose‐6‐phosphate (T‐6‐P) phosphatase, which inhibits
  sucrose synthase. Sucrose non‐fermenting‐1‐related protein kinases (SnRKs) play
  a key role by either directly or indirectly interacting with the ABA signaling pathway
  to activate transcription factors bZIPs or AREB/ABFs, respectively, for T‐6‐P phosphatase
  production. SnRKs influence the flux of sucrose into the sink tissues by regulating
  SWEETs/SUTs expression.(b) In the sink tissue, the sucrose gives rise to glucose‐6‐phosphate
  through the activity of invertase and hexokinase. Conversion of glucose‐6‐phosphate
  into glucose‐1‐phosphate by phosphoglucomutase initiates the starch synthesis pathway.
  Glucose‐1‐phosphate is transported into the amyloplast, where it becomes amylose
  via APGase. Starch is produced from amylose by the starch‐branching enzymes. Black
  arrows represent the general flow of the pathway. Red arrows represent potential
  upregulation, and blue lines show potential inhibition. Enzymes and proteins are
  highlighted in green, and metabolites are highlighted in blue. The red block icon
  shows that the PP2Cs are not interacting with SnRKs in the presence of ABA, rendering
  the SnRKs active. ABFs, ABA‐responsive elements binding factors; bZIP, basic leucine
  zipper family of transcription factors; PP2Cs, A type 2C protein phosphatases; PYL,
  Pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1)/PYR1‐like receptor protein; SnRKs, sucrose non‐fermenting
  1‐related kinases; SUT, sugar transporter/sugar carrier; SWEET, sugars will eventually
  be exported transporter; TPP, trehalose‐6‐phosphate phosphatase; TPS, trehalose‐6‐phosphate
