caption: Recent work has identified a pathway for cytosolic oxidized dopamine (DA)
  and αSynuclein accumulation due to dysfunction in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in
  human-derived dopaminergic neurons []. These byproducts can further inhibit mitochondrial
  function by impairing ATP production and increase reactive oxygen species production
  via mitochondrially mediated metabolism of cytosolic DA. In addition, they can contribute
  to lysosomal dysfunction, which may further involve defective proteolytic turnover
  of synaptic proteins and the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. It is
  conceivable that the convergence of synaptic, mitochondrial, and lysosomal dysfunction
  may exacerbate cytosolic DA and αSynuclein accumulation and ultimately result in
  cell death in Parkinson’s disease.Key Figure Deficits in Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis
