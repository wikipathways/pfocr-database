caption: (A) Eukaryotic modification network of uridines at the wobble position 34.
  The weave results from the overlay of independently operating modification pathways,
  which modify at positions 2’-O of the ribose, C5 of the uridines, or O2 of the uridines.
  The lack of a fixed order of action generates a multitude of permutations. (B) Biosynthesis
  pathway of wybutosine derivatives. Note that transformations occur in a defined
  serial manner. Since branching pathways do not reunite, the pathway by which a given
  modification is generated is unambiguous. Numbers in parentheses refer to the TYW1-5
  enzymes involved in each step and referred to in the main text. Question marks (?)
  indicate reactions for which the given enzyme is not known.
