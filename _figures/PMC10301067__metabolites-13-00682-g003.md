caption: Bile acid synthesis pathway (abbreviated) in SLS. Thirty-one metabolites
  were measured. Statistically significant metabolites in SLS are indicated by a number
  in parentheses corresponding to the ratio of mean SLS to mean control. Metabolites
  that lack an associated number were either not measured or did not differ between
  the groups. Red arrow indicates a feedback effect of bile acids on CYP7a1 gene expression.
