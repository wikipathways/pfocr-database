caption: SARS-CoV-2 intracellular signaling and potential targets for immunoevasion
  and host cells particularly macrophages elicit a variety of antiviral immunity genes
  shown above.The induction of TLR2 (via S protein), TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 (via virus-derived
  RNA following internalization process) leads to the expression of the pro-inflammatory
  mediators and IFNs through induction of the transcription factors NF-κB, IRF3, and
  IRF7. Viral-derived RNAs activate PKR- and OAS-related anti-viral pathways. The
  cytoplasmic sensors such as MAD-5 and RIG-1 also recognize various types of virus-derived
  RNAs and signal through adaptor MAVS/ISP-1 (located on our membrane of mitochondria).
  SARS-CoV-2 affects the cells of the innate immune system in particular monocytes,
  macrophages, and dendritic cells. These cells of the innate system play a crucial
  role in curbing the viral replication through the induction of Type-I IFNs assisted
  with the complement proteins and natural immunoglobulins against viral epitopes.
  These cellular responses (induction of proinflammatory mediators and IFNs Type-I,
  III) are tightly regulated by a series of intracellular signaling pathways elicited
  by surface receptors like TLRs, DC-SIGN, FcRs, and ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Upon the viral
  entry into the host cells (via the clathrin-dependent internalization or ACE-2 mediated
  internalization) the spontaneous unloading of viral RNA is a subsequent step that
  follows. The viral RNA triggers the activation of intracellular RNA sensors like
  RIG-1 and MDA-5 each operating with distinct RNA conformations. RNA sensors then
  interact with MAVS that initiates Type-1 IFN signaling by activating the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB and IRF3. The oligomeric RIG-1-CARD assembly and the polymeric
  formation of MAVS act as a signalosome for conducting the viral sensing signals
  further, which bifurcates into the activation of TRAF-2/6 to activate IKK complex
  and NF-κB activation. The other branch signals through TRAF-3 and activates the
  TANK/IKKγ/IKKε/TBK1 complex that acts as activators of IRF-3/7. Altogether the IRF-3/7
  activation along with NF-κB drives the IFN and proinflammatory gene expression with
  the help of CREB-binding protein/p300 and transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2.
  The IFN synthesized and secreted this way acts on the distant cells (paracrine)
  mode for spreading anti-viral immunity and in autocrine modes to fortify the intracellular
  viral clearance. SARS-CoV-2, however, attenuates these signaling pathways at various
  interception nodes. SARS-CoV proteins like ORF-9b may attenuate this antiviral response
  through targeting of MAVS by seizing poly (C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and the
  HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 to trigger the degradation of MAVS (not shown) along
  with TRAF-3 and TRAF-6. While ORF6 is reported to antagonize the STAT-1 function
  by sequestering its nuclear import factors. SARS-ORF-3b, ORF-6, and nucleocapsid
  protein function to antagonize interferon production. Besides this, the host mRNA
  destabilizing functions of NSP-1 are also reported. However, Nsp1 protein suppresses
  IFN-β mRNA accumulation without inhibiting IRF3 dimerization. Similarly, SARS-CoV
  NSP-15 inhibits MAVS-induced apoptosis sustaining the intracellular viral presence.
  SARS-CoV N protein can activate AP-1 but not the NF-κB signaling pathway. SARS-CoV
  proteins have been shown to inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway in the infected cell that
  responds to the Type-I IFNs secreted from bystander/neighboring cells. STAT-1-STAT-2-heterodimers
  combines with the IRF-9 to form the ISGF3 complex. This complex is crucial for the
  activation of genes harboring ISRE in their promoter regions. Viral protein ORF-6
  blocks the nuclear import of ISGF3 by reducing the available import factor KPNB1
  (Kβ1). Accordingly, various types of the IFNs are secreted from viral-infected cells
  that may induce various anti-viral restriction factors (such as OAS, PKR, viperin
  tetherin, IFITM, RNase L, GTPase, TRIM, ADAR1, APOBEC, and others) following binding
  to their receptors. Coronavirus-derived nonstructural protein also contributes to
  abrogate IFN expression or IFN-related signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-derived N protein
  can inactivate anti-virus restriction factor TRIM25 (RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase
  that controls RIG-I ubiquitination and IFN-β production). MAVS/ISP-1-related pathways
  may cause apoptosis through the induction of the caspases-mitochondria-mediated
  pathway.
