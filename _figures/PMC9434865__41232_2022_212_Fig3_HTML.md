caption: Potentially therapeutic skin microbiota by pathogen elimination. Engraftment
  of specific skin microbiota that play a role in killing the pathogen is a therapeutic
  strategy for skin inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis and acne. Colonization
  of Staphylococcus aureus is inhibited by bacterial metabolites such as antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs), autoinducing peptides, and antibiotics. Bacteriophages kill and
  lyse the bacteria that they infect. Staphylococcus epidermidis promotes the production
  of AMPs from host cells through the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) response. Dendritic
  cells (DCs) capture S. epidermidis and induce IL-17A+ CD8T cells via a nonclassical
  MHC I-restricted pathway. Induced IL-17A+ CD8T cells produce cytokines that stimulate
  keratinocytes to produce AMPs against pathogens
