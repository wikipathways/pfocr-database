caption: Mechanistic diagram illustrating the detrimental effects of TRMT10C in the
  nucleus under hypoxic conditions via m1A modification. CPT1A is a succinyltransferase
  responsible for protein succinylation. The reduction in CPT1A and succinyl-CoA levels
  inhibits the succinylation of TRMT10C in cardiomyocytes during CME. This suppression
  of TRMT10C succinylation enhances its binding to KPNA4, facilitating the transport
  of TRMT10C from the cytoplasm to the nucleus instead of to the mitochondria. In
  the nucleus, TRMT10C promotes the decay of TAFAZZIN and NLRX1 through m1A modification.
  The reduction of TAFAZZIN and NLRX1 is associated with impaired mitophagy, which
  may lead to increased apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally,
  the decrease in TAFAZZIN and NLRX1 facilitates the activation of inflammatory signaling
  pathways, such as NF-κB and NLRP3. The reduced levels of NLRX1 promote the interaction
  between ASC and NLRP3, thereby activating the NLRP3 signaling pathway and inducing
  the production of inflammatory factors
