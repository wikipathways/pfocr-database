caption: 'Pictorial representation of the role of intracellular calcium in the pathophysiology
  of ADPKD. ADPKD: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.
  In a normal kidney epithelial cell, there is an increased level of intracellular
  calcium due to the proper functioning of polycystin-2 at the basolateral membrane
  and endoplasmic reticulum (not shown in the figure) along with other calcium ion
  channels. Increased calcium leads to the activation of PI3K that further activates
  the Akt. Akt leads to the inhibition of the proliferative factor; B-Raf and therefore
  abate the activation of other factors of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (shown by the dashed
  line). In a renal epithelial cell with mutated polycystin-2, there is a low intracellular
  calcium level due to which B-Raf cannot get inhibited by the decreased formation
  of Akt that consequently leads to unabated cell proliferation (Mitobe et al. ; Li
  et al. )'
