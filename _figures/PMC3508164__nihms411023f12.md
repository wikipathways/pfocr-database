caption: Proposed model of Cripto-1 modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Cripto-1 can regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through the binding of
  LRP5/6, which also bind to caveolin-1 in the lipid raft as well as Cripto-1. Cripto-1
  facilitates the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 induced by Wnt3a. The phosphorylated LRP6
  leads to recruitment of the Axin complex (Axin, APC and GSK3β) to the Wnt receptor
  complex. The receptor complex is then internalized via a caveolin-mediated route
  to induce the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin can then form a complex
  with Tcf/Lef and activate the transcription of target genes after translocation
  to the nucleus. Cripto-1 also might interfere with the internalization of LRP5/6
  that is facilitated by Dkk1, which is a potent inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway.

  to LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors.
