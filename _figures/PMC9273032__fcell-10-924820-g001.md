caption: 'Comparison of the roles of zinc and manganese in immune-mediated host defence
  against infection. Zn deficiency is common worldwide and physiological Zn concentrations
  protect against infections by: triggering a variety of transcription factors involved
  in the immune response, preventing apoptosis of B cells and inhibiting the NF-κB
  pathway following intracellular transcript via ZIP8. In contrast Mn deficiency is
  rare and it helps protect against infection but different mechanisms that include
  acting as cofactor for glycosyltransferase enzymes essential for post translational
  protein glycosylation, enhancing apoptosis of B cells and activating the NF-κB pathway.
  Whereas each metal has contrasting and distinct functions, they both have antioxidant
  properties and help facilitate T cell receptor (TCR) signalling. Stars indicate
  the common polymorphic variants of ZIP8. Red arrows indicate inhibition, black arrows
  indicate activation.'
