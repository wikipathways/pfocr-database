caption: This figure displays a suggested relationship between coagulation and inflammation
  in patients with a SARS-CoV-2-infection. Spike proteins in the coronavirus’ envelope
  first bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the surface of
  epithelial cells (e.g., EC, endothelial cell). Type II transmembrane serine protease
  (TMPRSS2) then cleaves the spike protein in order to facilitate viral entry. The
  SARS-CoV-2 virus damages EC and promotes activation of the coagulation cascade (see
  ) via the TF-FVIIa (tissue factor pathway) and boosts fibrin generation (hyper-coagulation
  state). This hyper-activation of the fibrinolytic system results in increased plasmin
  production. Plasmin binds to the EC-plasmin receptor and degrades fibrin that leads
  to high plasma DDI levels. Membranous plasmin, which is a potent serine protease,
  could cleave the virus’ protein S hereby aiding its entry into host cells. This
  shared viral cleavage function with TMPRSS2 contributes to the increased infectivity
  of the virus and facilitates its spread (this function has been established in many
  viral infections, see text). In addition, over-production of plasmin (increased
  plasmin-receptor occupancy) activates the protease-activated receptor 1 and 2 (PAR
  1, 2) signaling pathways which are involved in inflammation and immune responses.
  The EPCR-protein C complex is probably overwhelmed by hypercoagulability, thereby
  losing its cytoprotective activity. This virus-related pro-coagulation-inflammatory
  state also involves macrophages. This pathophysiologic paradigm explains the increased
  infectivity (and replication?) of the virus and the association between high D-dimer
  production and the cytokine storm (mainly IL-6, IL-10, and TNF) in COVID-19.
