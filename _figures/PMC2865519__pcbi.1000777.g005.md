caption: The figure shows the consensus tree of sarcoma subtypes. We use expression
  data of 251 sarcoma samples classified into the types shown in . The tree is rooted
  with expression data of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We also include expression
  data of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and of fully differentiated normal adipocytes.
  The differentiation pathway from hESC to fully differentiated adipocytes is indicated
  in purple, and the pink dots represent the common ancestors of (sets of) subtypes.
  The boxed numbers specify the bootstrap values of branches. The phylogeny ranks
  the sarcoma subtypes according to their dissimilarity from stem cells as leiomyosarcoma,
  malignant fibrous histiocytoma, myxofibrosarcoma, followed by the liposarcoma subtypes
  dedifferentiated liposarcoma, pleomorphic, myxoid/round-cell, and well-differentiated
  liposarcoma. Lipoma is identified as the subtype most dissimilar from stem cells.
