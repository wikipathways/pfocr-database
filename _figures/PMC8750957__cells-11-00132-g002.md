caption: NF-κB signaling pathway. (1) Canonical NF-κB activation. Cytokines, such
  as RANKL and TNFα, induce canonical signaling by recruiting TRAF6 and TRAF2/5, respectively,
  to their receptors to activate a complex consisting of IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ (NEMO),
  which induces phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α, and the release of p65/p50
  heterodimers, which translocate to the nucleus to activate the target gene expression.
  (2) Non-canonical NF-κB activation. In unstimulated cells, the TRAF3–TRA2 complex
  results in constitutive NIK degradation, and thus, p100 binds RelB to be remained
  trapped in cytoplasm. Cytokines, such as CD40L and RANKL, recruit cIAP to the TRAF2–TRA3
  complex, resulting in TRAF3 ubiquitin degradation, and allowing newly synthesized
  NIK accumulation. NIK then phosphorylates IKK-α, which leads to proteasomal processing
  of p100 to p52, releasing RelB:p52 heterodimers for translocation to the nucleus.
  TNFα does not degrade TRAF3, and thus, NIK is degraded, leading to the accumulation
  of p100 in the cytoplasm of osteoclast precursors to limit their differentiation.
