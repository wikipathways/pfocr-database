caption: Schematic representation of experimental design. The transcriptional signature
  associated to AD or T2DM was extracted from transcriptomic data of post-mortem cerebral
  cortices of AD or T2DM affected individuals as compared to controls. Network analysis
  was then performed with the reference protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
  derived from Biogrid data. The functionality analysis of the networks was then performed
  by testing over-represented Gene Ontology biological process terms and pathways.
  The relevance of autophagy, the most significant pathway identified by network analysis,
  was further validated in two animal models of AD.
