caption: DEGs that are located in the neighborhood (putative cis-targets) of DELs
  and that are associated with Notch signaling pathway and stress granule formation.
  (A) Some DEGs including Numb, Deltex, CBP, Epsin-2 and lysine-specific demethylase
  lid (lsdl) that are associated with Notch signaling are increased in expression
  during ApNPV infection. As also shown in , epsin-2 (evm.TU.AY_261.18) and lysine-specific
  demethylase lid (XLOC_008622) are considered as putative cis-targets of AY_261_133645_148170
  and AY_225_415711_427236, respectively, in A. pernyi. Therefore, we speculate that
  AY-261 and AY-225 might participate in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway
  by regulating the expression of epsin-2 and lysine-specific demethylase lid by a
  mechanism in cis. (B) Stress granule formation can occur as a result of eIF2α phosphorylation
  caused by eIF2a kinase. eIF2a kinase expression was activated during ApNPV infection
  in A. pernyi. Ataxin-2-like protein, a neighboring gene and potential cis-target
  of AY_545, is a component of stress granules and could possibly function as a regulator
  of stress granules during ApNPV infection. (C) Heat map of the relative expression
  of epsin-2, lsdl, Numb, Deltex, CBP, ataxin-2-like protein and eIF2a kinase in ApNPV-infected
  A. pernyi compared with uninfected controls.
