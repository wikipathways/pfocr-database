caption: 'Role of placenta in the immunoendocrine dysregulations occurring in gestational
  diabetes mellitus. Hyperglycemia during pregnancy compromises the correct physiology
  of diverse organs, and particularly the placenta. Pregestational obesity is characterized
  by an excessive TG accumulation and changes in IR expression and signaling in adipose
  tissue, as well as in skeletal muscle cells. These changes in insulin-dependent
  tissues lead to insulin resistance. Then, adipose tissue secretes high levels of
  leptin and inhibits those of adiponectin. Leptin activation of JaK-2/STAT 3/5 pathway
  results in increased cytokine production contributing to peripheral metainflammation.
  Due to insulin resistance and altered IR signaling, women suffer chronic hyperglycemia.
  Clinical and biomedical studies indicate there is a positive regulatory loop between
  hyperglycemia and metainflammation, in which hyperglycemia induces placental and
  peripheral synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines.
  Metainflammation also alters GLUT and IR expression which worsen hyperglycemia status.
  The synthesis of placental hormones is altered by hyperglycemia. Deficient synthesis
  of PRL and calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) has been reported in GDM placentae,
  whereas hPL synthesis is increased. These placental hormonal changes, and probably
  estrogens and progestins, compromise pancreatic gene expression of GLUT2, glucokinase,
  insulin, survivin, cyclin D2, and Bcl6; all these genes are related to b-cells proliferation
  and survival. Because of reduced b-cells expansion, hyperglycemia worsens. Additionally,
  deficient synthesis of calcitriol abates placental expression of antimicrobial peptides
  related to innate defense, increasing mother and fetus vulnerability to infections
  in the perinatal period. Another endocrine dysregulation is derived from IGF-I overactivation
  in the placenta, which explains increased placental growth and glucose uptake. The
  establishment of a chronic inflammatory milieu in the placenta results in: (i) Increased
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adipokines; (ii) Increased
  placental infiltration of M1 macrophages, cytotoxic neutrophils, and T cells; (iii)
  Deregulated production of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors; and (iv) Increased
  lipid peroxidation and synthesis of ROS precursors. Even if angiogenesis is induced,
  vessels in the placenta are thickened and immature. Overall, altered vessels formation,
  hyperglycemia, and oxidative stress induce endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore,
  the serum inflammatory profile is evidenced by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines, and adipokines as well as a higher presence of cytotoxic monocytes,
  neutrophils, and T cells. Hyperglycemia and over-activation of IGF-I signaling results
  in increased fetal growth which may contribute to macrosomia. Finally, hyperglycemia
  and oxidative stress produce pancreatic overstress in the fetus, causing an increased
  risk for T2DM development later in life. Experimental and clinical evidence indicates
  that GDM fetuses present a marked neural pro-oxidative environment which may lead
  to neural, motor and behavior disturbances. AMPs: antimicrobial peptides; GDM: Gestational
