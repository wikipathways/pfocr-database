caption: The proposed mechanism elucidating the involvement of EBV in oral cancers
  encompasses the regulation of host cellular lncRNA LINC00944. EBV infection modulates
  the expression of host genes, including up-regulation of LINC00944, which is associated
  with TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway. The LINC00944 interacts with miRNAs targeting
  NFKB1 (hsa-miR-340-5p, hsa-miR-9-5p, and hsa-miR-338-3p) and RELA (hsa-miR-506-3p)
  in a competitive manner, inhibiting their regulation. This leads to elevated levels
  of NFKB1 and RELA, promoting the formation of the NF-kB/RELA complex, which translocates
  to the nucleus and increases transcription of downstream genes (TNF, IFN, IRF1,
  IRF5, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL3) associated with inflammation and cancer progression. These
  targets also activate STAT1, enhancing macrophage polarization toward the M1 subtype
  and further supporting cancer progression. Additionally, LINC00944 is secreted by
  cancer cells, influencing neighboring cells and immune cells within the TME, promoting
  macrophage polarization to M1, and contributing to the cancer-promoting microenvironment.
  In summary, EBV infection increases LINC00944, affecting TNF-α/NF-κB signaling via
  the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis, driving cancer progression and immune cell regulation
