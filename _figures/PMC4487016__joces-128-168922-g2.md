caption: Schematic representation of amino acid sensing in yeast and mammals at the
  vacuole or lysosome. Yeast and mammalian orthologs are designated with the same
  color. Functions of different TORC1 regulators, which are currently controversial
  in the field, are indicated with ‘?’ and dashed arrows (see also ). (A) TORC1 regulation
  during amino acid starvation. In yeast, SEACIT is involved in the maintenance of
  TORC1 at the vacuole membrane (blue arrow and brackets). Mammalian TORC1 is diffused
  throughout the cytoplasm. Mammalian-specific sestrins inhibit GATOR2. SEACAT (GATOR2)
  inhibits SEACIT (GATOR1). SEACIT (GATOR1) act as GAP for Gtr1 (RagA or RagB in mammals),
  preserving it in inactive form. Both yeast and mammalian TORC1 are inactive during
  amino acid starvation. Schematic representations of the composition of the SEA and
  GATOR complexes are also shown. (B) Activation of TORC1 upon amino acid stimulation.
  In yeast, SEA acts in the form of a stoichiometric SEACIT–SEACAT complex (shown
  on the left), whereas the GATOR subcomplexes GATOR1 and GATOR2 appear to act separately
  from each other. In mammals, Ragulator and v-ATPase undergo conformational changes
  that result in GEF activity by Ragulator towards RagA or RagB. Active Ragulator–Rag
  then promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane, where mTORC1
  becomes fully activated by Rheb-GTP. LeuRS and FLCN–FNIP are also involved in the
  interaction with Gtrs/Rags (see ), but their exact molecular functions (GEF or GAP,
  and for which Gtr or Rag) is currently a subject of controversy in the field. In
  yeast, TORC1 is activated by the EGO complex which is comprised of Gtr1-GTP and
  Gtr2-GDP.
