caption: Selective autophagy in respiratory infection and sepsis. (A) The role of
  autophagy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. IFN-γ induced IRGM activates
  autophagy and eliminates Mtb to outstrip the interference of fusion between phagosomal
  compartments containing Mtb and lysosomes. (B) The role of selective autophagy in
  Mtb infection. The bacterial ESX-1 secretion system mediates phagosomal permeabilization
  to enable the ubiquitin-mediated autophagy pathway to access phagosomal Mtb. Ubiquitinated
  Mtb is recognized by p62 and NDP52 as a target of selective autophagy. (C) The role
  of mitophagy in sepsis. The release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol
  depends on the NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondrial ROS. Cytosolic mtDNA contributes
  to the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in response to LPS and ATP. Mitophagy limits
  the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 by targeting impaired mitochondria.
