caption: 'Model of derivative #5-mediated downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  Under normal conditions or in the absence of Wnt ligand, Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  is downregulated, as β-catenin is degraded in the following sequential fashion:
  i) The phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK-3β induces the formation
  of a complex containing β-catenin, Axin and APC; ii) the polyubiquitination of the
  phosphorylated β-catenin by E3 ubiquitin ligase; and iii) the degradation of polyubiquitinated
  β-catenin by the 26S proteasome. In the presence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is stabilized
  by Dvl- and LRP-mediated disassociation of a complex containing GSK-3β, Axin and
  APC. In KSHV-infected cells, KSHV LANA interacts with GSK-3β in the nucleus, leading
  to β-catenin stabilization and subsequent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  Derivative #5 induces the phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of β-catenin,
  leading to downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. APC, adenomatous polyposis
