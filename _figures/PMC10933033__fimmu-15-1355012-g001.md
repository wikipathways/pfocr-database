caption: 'Adaptor proteins mediating the signaling of TLR receptors. TLR signaling
  is mediated via two pathways: MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathway. In the
  MyD88-dependent pathway, TIRAP mediates the interaction of MyD88 with TLR2/4 for
  the initiation of the signaling cascade. The adaptor proteins SOCS-1, IRAK1/4, CLIP170,
  and Triad3A inhibit the function of TIRAP. MyD88 recruits IRAK-1, which will be
  phosphorylated and bind to TRAF6. Once activated, TRAF6 acts as an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, ubiquitinates, and activates NEMO, IKKα, and IKKβ to induce the phosphorylation
  of IκB and subsequent dissociation from NF-κB, resulting in the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB. SOCS-1, Ub-DOK-3, NLRC5, and IRF7 inhibit the activation of IKKα/β, downregulating
  the NF-κB pathway. In parallel, MyD88 induces the p38, MAPK, and JNK/ERK signaling
  for the activation and translocation of AP-1 in the nucleus. In the TRIF-dependent
  pathway, TRIF indirectly interacts with TLR4 via TRAM and activates IRF3 via TRAF3,
  which translocates in the nucleus and induces the expression of IFN-β. The role
  of TRIF is inhibited by SARM. DAP12 associates with TREM2 upon stimulation and induces
  the phosphorylation and translocation of DOK-3 on the cell membrane, resulting in
  the inhibition of MAPK and ERK pathways. Meanwhile, ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  of DOK-3 leads to SOS1 degradation and inhibition of ERK pathway. TLR2/4, Toll-like
