  activators and inhibitors in the gastrulating embryo. Expression patterns are based
  on mouse expression data from in situ hybridization and scRNA-Seq studies (). For
  all pathways except Retinoic Acid (RA), pathway activators were defined as protein
  products that have been shown to increase pathway activity, typically by binding
  and activating pathway receptors. Inhibitors were defined as endogenous protein
  products that have been shown to reduce pathway activity, typically by binding and
  inhibiting receptor activation or by binding and sequestering pathway activators.
  Because RA is not a protein but a metabolite, activators for this pathway include
  all-trans RA (ATRA) synthesis enzymes whereas inhibitors include enzymes that convert
  ATRA to other species. Regions marked by solid colors indicate areas of activator
  expression and regions marked with the outlined diamond pattern indicate areas of
  inhibitor expression. See also .(C) Soluble factors used to modulate pathway activity
