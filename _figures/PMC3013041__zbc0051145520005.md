caption: 'Relationship between transcription factors and their regulatory factors.
  Transcription factors (TF, rectangles) show different motif activity scores between
  WT and TamR cells and their regulatory genes (triangles), and signal mediators (circles)
  are visualized as a network (A, E2; B, HRG). Node color represents phosphorylation
  and TF activation differences between the two cell lines: red, higher activity in
  TamR than in WT; blue, higher activity in WT than in TamR; green, phosphorylation
  change was observed in only one cell or down-regulation only was observed; gray,
  no change. The edges were color-coded according to TF and regulator activation level
  in WT and TamR: red, higher activation of TFs and their regulators in TamR than
  in WT; blue, higher activation of TFs and their regulators in WT than in TamR; black,
  others. TFs with differential motif activity were inferred from gene expression
  data (see the supplemental materials for detail), and then factors regulating the
  predicted TFs were investigated by the KEGG pathway, PhosphoSitePlus, and NetworKIN
  databases. Relationships extracted from KEGG and PhosphoSitePlus are shown.'
