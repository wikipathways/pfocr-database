caption: TEV as immunosuppressive shuttles. TEV from tumour cells carry various immune
  checkpoint molecules, which impair the antitumour immune response. In particular,
  activated T-cell producing IFNγ and TNFα enhance PD-L1 expression in tumour cells,
  which in turn secrete TEV expressing PD-L1, which interacting with PD-1, interferes
  with effector T-cell activity and drives Treg expansion. As PD-1, CTLA4 after binding
  to TEV expressing CD80/CD86 suppresses the immune response and T-cell-mediated cytotoxic
  activity. On the other hand, TEV carrying CTLA4 boost CD80/CD86 scavenging and induce
  proliferation of targeted tumour cells. Moreover, TIM-3+ TEV are uptaken by TAM
  and induce M2 polarisation. Similarly, CD73+ TEV upregulate the expression of immunosuppressive
  factors in TAM by activating the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, FasL and TRAIL TEV
  content has immunosuppressive factors, by binding receptors Fas and TRAIL-R1/2,
  respectively, to immune cells, thereby promoting target cell apoptosis. In addition,
  FasL interaction with c-FLIP expressed by tumour cells promotes tumour invasiveness
  and metastasis formation. The so-called “Protein corona” describes the presence
  of TEV membrane proteins artificially linked to the membrane of TEV or naturally
  linked to their receptors. IL-10 and TGFβ expressed by TEV boost the immune suppression.
