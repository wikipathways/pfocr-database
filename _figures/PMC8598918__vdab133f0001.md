caption: Critical RTK structure and signaling pathways in GBM. (A) RTK structure.
  The 5 RTK families most studied in GBM are shown. The variants with GBM genetic
  alterations are listed below the family names. All RTKs have a similar molecular
  architecture, which is characterized by an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane
  region and a cytoplasmic region consisting of a juxtamembrane domain, a tyrosine
  kinase (TK) domain and the carboxy terminal (modified from Lemmon, et al., with
  permission). (B) RTK signaling pathway. RTKs can be activated through ligand-dependent
  or ligand-independent mechanisms, leading to receptor dimerization and phosphorylation
  at the TK domains. RTK phosphorylation further triggers downstream signaling pathways
  that activate or repress genes involved in proliferation, invasion, survival and
  carcinogenesis. An elevation of the RTK-mediated RAS and PI3K signaling pathway
  (RTK/RAS/PI3K) is the most frequent signaling alteration, occurring in about 90%
  of GBM patient specimens. As in other cancer types, additional mutation, or deletion
  of tumor suppressor genes such as NF1 and PTEN further accelerates RTK/RAS/PI3K
  activity, promoting glioma initiation and malignant progression.
