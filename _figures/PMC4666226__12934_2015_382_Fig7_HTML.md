caption: 'Metabolic strategy in evolved strains lacking the aas-lplT operon. Proposed
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) metabolism model in PB12 and PB13 strains where
  the deletion of aas-lplT operon is responsible of the lack of the 2-acyl-GPE cycle
  that in turn was apparently replaced with the utilization of the degradation pathway.
  In these evolved strains two additional mutations were detected: in the glpT and
  dhaM genes. At least the glpT mutation could be playing a role in these strains
  for PtdEtn utilization and faster growth on glucose. The abbreviations are as follows:
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), 2-acyl-glycerophosphatidylethanolamine (2-acyl-GPE),
  fatty acid (FA), Lipoprotein (Lpp), acylated lipoprotein (Acyl-Lpp), Apolipoprotein
  N-acyltransferase (Lnt), phospholipase A type 2 (PLA2), phosphatidylethanolamine
  transporter in the 2-acyl-GPE cycle (MsbA), lysophospholipid transporter (LplT),
  1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (PlsC), 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine
  acyltransferase/acyl-ACP synthetase (Aas), acyl-ACP synthetase activity (ACP), 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine
  acyltransferase activity (ACS), glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ),
  fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD), glycerol-3-phosphate:phosphate antiporter (GlpT)'
