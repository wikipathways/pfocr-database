caption: Major and other possible molecular pathways associated with NLRs in IBD.
  NOD2 recognize the bacterial peptidoglycan MDP. NOD2 monomers are oligomerized by
  CARD-CARD interactions to recruit RIPK2, which further activates NF-κB or MAPK signaling
  pathway. Meanwhile, the NOD2 signalosome promotes the production of cytokines and
  activates autophagy pathway via ATG16L1. Both the NOD2-induced priming and environment
  factors like ATP activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The maturation of CASP1 is induced
  by inflammasomes of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7 and NLRC4, which assists the production
  of IL-1β and IL-18. With the help of NEK7, NLRP3 inflammasome further promotes the
  pyroptosis pathway. In addition, NLRP12 inflammasome and NLRX1 inhibit the TLR4
  signaling pathway which is associated with the production of interferons. ATG16L1,
