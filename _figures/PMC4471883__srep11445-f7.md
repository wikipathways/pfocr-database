caption: After 24 h of TLR4 DNA and Con DNA transfection, the expression of TLR4 in
  microglia was detected by IF staining. The staining intensity in the TLR4 DNA transfection
  group was higher than the Con DNA transfection group (). TLR4, MyD88 and IκB-α expression
  was also tested. The TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels in the OGD group or IP + OGD + TLR4
  DNA group were higher than those in the IP + OGD group or IP + OGD + Con DNA group
  (P < 0.05). In contrast, IκB-α expression was lower in the OGD group or IP + OGD + TLR4
  DNA group than that in the IP + OGD group or IP + OGD + Con DNA group (P < 0.05)
  (). Moreover, the MTT assay showed that neuron viability was lower in the OGD group
  or IP + OGD + TLR4 DNA group than in the IP + OGD group or IP + OGD + Con DNA group
  (P < 0.05) (). These findings suggested that TLR4 overexpression following TLR4
  DNA transfection abrogated the effects of IP on TLR4, MyD88 and IκB-α expression
  in microglia and on neuron survival. Therefore, this study suggested that IP exerts
  neuroprotection by inhibiting the function of TLR4 and its downstream signalling
  molecules, which can evoke inflammatory reactions and regulate the expression of
  apoptosis-related proteins ().
