caption: Fasting can affect the regeneration and differentiation of tissue and cells.
  A) FMD inhibits cell growth by regulating the AMPK‐mTOR signaling pathway; B) FMD
  modulates increased expression of Ngn3 which is an early developmental marker and
  leads to the regeneration of insulin‐producing β cells; C) FMD improves neuronal
  survival and differentiation neuronal survival and differentiation in brain tissue
  via inducing NeuroD1 expression; D) FMD stimulates regeneration and differentiation
  of oligodendrocytes and protects OPCs from apoptosis; E) FMD drives muscle differentiation
  via activating the expression of Pax‐7, which is a stem cell marker mainly expressed
  by muscle satellite stem cells; F) FMD promotes ISCs regeneration and division in
  part by increasing the numbers of crypt base columnar and enteroendocrine cells
  in intestinal tissue.
