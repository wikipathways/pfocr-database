caption: 'Fatty acid metabolism of E. coli and the “pull-push-block” strategy for
  fatty acid production. Overexpression of tesA and fadR pulls and pushes the carbon
  fluxes to fatty acid production, while knockout of fadE blocks fatty acid degradation.
  Red-boxed genes are positively regulated by FadR. Green-boxed genes are negatively
  regulated by the fadR gene product, FadR. Bolded arrows represent reactions enhanced
  by overexpressing the indicated genes. × represents inactivation of the corresponding
  pathway by knocking out the indicated gene. ⊤ represents repression or activation
  exerted by FadR. Full names of genes: accABCD, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ackA, acetate
  kinase A; fabA, beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase; fabB, 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase
  I; fabD, malonyl-CoA ACP transacylase; fabF, 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase II; fabG, 3-oxoacyl-ACP
  reductase; fabH, 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase III; fabI, enoyl-ACP reductase; fabZ, (3R)-hydroxymyristol
  acyl carrier protein dehydratase; fadA, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; fadB, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; fadD, acyl-CoA synthetase; fadE, acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; plsB,

  acyl-ACP thioesterase.'
