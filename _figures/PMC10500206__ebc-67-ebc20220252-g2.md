caption: (A) All hydroxamate-type siderophores share common building blocks, N5-hydroxyornithine
  (in blue) and acyl/acetyl groups (in green), which together constitute the hydroxamate-groups
  (boxed in gray; middle panel). Hydroxamate groups are shaded in gray. In FsC, TAFC,
  and coprogen, the acyl group is anhydromevalonyl; in rhodotorulic acid and FC, it
  is acetyl. The acetyl groups lacking in FsC compared with TAFC are shown in black.
  (B) The siderophore biosynthetic pathway is described in detail in the text. Enzymes
  exclusively dedicated to siderophore biosynthesis are shaded in gray; siderophore
  pathway intermediates are in black; red arrows mark steps that are transcriptionally
  up-regulated by iron limitation. This figure was reproduced in part from Figure
  2 of [5].
