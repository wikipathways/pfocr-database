caption: Paxillin participates in MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Paxillin is
  transferred to the nucleus through the MAPK pathway and promotes the combination
  of nuclear ERK and ELK1 to activate the expression of cyclin D1. Paxillin can also
  affect tumor cell EMT through the ERK signaling pathway. MC-LR promotes paxillin
  phosphorylation through the MAPK pathway. Ropivacaine reduces the activity of small
  GTPases, thereby inhibiting the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway to reduce the phosphorylation
  level of paxillin. GDP-9 promotes paxillin expression and paxillin phosphorylation
  through Smad-dependent pathways. CX-4945 can reduce paxillin expression and paxillin
  phosphorylation by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway. Hesperetin can inhibit
  TGF-β-mediated Fyn activation by reducing paxillin phosphorylation to inhibit RhoA
  expression and rock activation, which affects tumor migration and invasion. IGF-IR
  increases paxillin phosphorylation by activating Akt and MAPK signaling cascades.
  PTPRT can dephosphorylate paxillin tyrosine-88 residue to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway
  and thus inhibit tumorigenesis. P50 and P65 can regulate the transcription and expression
  of paxillin, and PTEN can reduce the expression of paxillin by dephosphorylating
  PIP3 to inhibit the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway
