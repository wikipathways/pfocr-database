caption: 'In the methionine cycle, homocysteine is remethylated to methionine through
  the methionine synthase enzyme (MTR) with vitamin B12 as a cofactor, or necessary
  catalyst for MTR activity. Methionine is then converted to SAM, which donates a
  methyl group and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is then converted
  back to homocysteine. Histone and DNA methyltransferases transfer the methyl group
  from SAM to amino acids and bases on histone amino-terminal tails and to the 5 position
  of cytosine residues in DNA []. When MTR enzymatic activity is inhibited by reactive
  oxygen and nitrogen species, BHMT uses betaine to remethylate homocysteine to methionine.
  Betaine can be taken in through the diet or synthesized through the oxidation of
  choline in mitochondria. Abbreviations: Hcy, homocysteine; Met, methionine; SAM,
  S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; BHMT, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; HMTs, histone methyltransferases;
  DNMTs, DNA methyltransferases.'
