caption: Fig. 7. A model for the role of C3G–Rap1 signaling pathway in cell attachment
  and cell spreading. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Rap1 is activated by C3G upon
  cell attachment, irrespective of the substratum. The activated Rap1 triggers an
  inside-out signal of integrin to induce cell adhesion, which requires specific interaction
  between integrin and extracellular matrices. SH2, SH3, Pro and CDC25 indicate Src
  homology 2, Src homology 3, proline-rich and yeast CDC25 homology domains, respectively.
