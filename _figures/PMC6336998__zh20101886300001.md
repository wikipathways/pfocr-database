caption: 'Sources of NAD(P)H and flavoprotein (FP) autofluorescence in mitochondria.
  A: NADH is generated from NAD+ in the cytosol from the conversion of lactate (Lac)
  to pyruvate (Pyr) and in mitochondria by beta oxidation of fatty acids (FAs) and
  the citric acid (TCA) cycle. NADH is oxidized back to NAD+ by complex I in the respiratory
  chain (RC). NADPH is generated in the cytosol by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  B: FPs are present in many different enzymes and in most cases are not fluorescent.
  Previous studies in isolated kidney mitochondria have suggested that the main sources
  of FP fluorescence are the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), which transfers
  electrons released from beta oxidation to the RC, and lipoamide dehydrogenase (LipDH),
  which is incorporated into the enzyme complexes α-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase (OGDH)
  and pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH). OGDH is involved in the metabolism of glutamine
  (Glut) and converts α-ketoglutarate to succinate in the TCA. OGDH, oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase.'
