caption: Map of molecular mechanisms involved in GREM2 regulation in migration, invasion
  and apoptosis of GCSCs. In GC, the expression of GREM2 was significantly increased,
  which therefore accelerated the activation of the JNK signaling pathway, and increased
  expression of JNK, c-jun phosphorylation to promote the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9,
  Bcl-2 and inhibit the expression of Bax. Ultimately, the migration and invasion
  of GC would be promoted and the apoptosis of GCSCs would be inhibited.
