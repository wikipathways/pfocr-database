caption: DAF-2 signaling (red pathway) opposes degradation-promoting signal from FGFs
  (green pathway). All animals were grown to mid-adulthood at 15°C, then treated for
  48 h at 25°C with the PtdIns-3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 (160 μM). This causes
  LacZ degradation in wild-type animals (Inset). Mutations that increase signal downstream
  of AGE-1 (pdk-1(mg142), daf-18(e1375), or akt-1(mg144), animals at left) block protein
  degradation triggered by LY treatment. Mutations that decrease signal at Raf (lin-45(sy96)),
  MEK (mek-2(ku114)), or MAPK (mpk-1(n2521)) also block protein degradation during
  LY treatment (lower right), but degradation is not prevented by reduction-of-function
  mutations affecting FGFR (egl-15(n1783)), GRB-2 (sem-5(n1779 or n1619)), or Ras
  (let-60(n2021)). Degradation is also blocked in a double mutant (egl-17(n1377);
  let-756(s2613)) deficient in both FGF homologs, but not in either single mutant.
  Quantitative data for rates of degradation in FGFR pathway mutants have been published
  (; ).
