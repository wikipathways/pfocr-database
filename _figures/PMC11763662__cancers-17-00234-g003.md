caption: Culmination of signaling pathways in the tumor stroma microenvironment involving
  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), adipocytes, and mast cells. CAFs release growth
  factors like TNF, SDF-1, VEGF, EGF, FGF2, and IGF, resulting in breast cancer progression.
  Secretion of several MMPs by CAFs such as MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, MMP13, and
  MMP14 are responsible for breast cancer advancement. Cytokines and chemokines released
  from CAFs include IL4, IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL16, and CXCL8, which enhance
  breast cancer cell motility and aggressiveness. CAAs secrete inflammatory adipokines
  such as TNFα, leptin, CCL2, CCL5, and IL6, which modulate breast cancer progression.
  Mast cells contribute to angiogenesis in breast cancer by releasing growth factors
  such as VEGF, FGF2, and PDGF, along with proteases such as tryptases and chymases
