caption: Proposed lactate signaling pathways.  Endothelial cells . Lactate activates
  NF-κB pathway through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lactate-induced
  HIF-1α stability is dependent on prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD).  Neutrophils . Lactate
  induces NETosis through MCT1-dependent PAD4 activation and glycolysis.  Macrophages.
  Lactate has an anti-inflammatory effect through the activation of the GPR81 receptor
  and the inhibition of the inflammasome and the NF-κB pathway.  Lymphocytes . Lactate
  induces IL-17 expression in a MCT1-dependent manner and decreases migration through
  indirect inhibition of glycolysis.  FLS . Lactate regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines through MAPK and NF-κB pathways dependent on lactate input by MCT1. Created
