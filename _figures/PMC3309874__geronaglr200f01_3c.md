caption: Insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) is a major candidate
  pathway in human longevity. Binding of IGF-1 or insulin (INS) initiates the evolutionarily
  conserved IRS–PI3K–AKT signaling cascade to phosphorylate Forkhead transcription
  factor FOXO. When phosphorylated, FOXO is retained in the cytoplasm. Mutations perturbing
  the IIS pathway reduce phosphorylation of FOXO, enabling it to enter the nucleus
  and regulate transcription of diverse genes that collectively contribute to the
  extension of life span. The role of reduced IIS in life-span extension is well-established
  in model organisms from yeast to mammals, suggesting that altered IIS may also influence
  human life span. Human population studies established genetic associations between
  some of the IIS genes (,), for example, IGF1R, AKT, FOXO3a, and longevity, supporting
  the role of IIS pathway in human longevity.
