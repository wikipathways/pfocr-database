caption: Diagrammatic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of labdane-type diterpenes
  and its reconstruction in yeast. Starting from the common precursor geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate (GGPP), different class II diTPSs synthesize copalyl diphosphate (CPP)
  or 8-hydroxy-copalyl diphosphate (8-OH-CPP). Miltiradiene synthase (MilS) can accept
  either CPP or 8-OH-CPP to produce miltiradiene or manoyl oxide, respectively (refs
  , ). Subsequently, the promiscuous enzyme, CYP76AH24, oxidizes miltiradiene, abietatriene,
  ferruginol and manoyl oxide, to synthesize the corresponding oxygenated molecules
  in position C-12 or C-11 (the biosynthetic pathways are described in details in
  the main text). Different CYPs perform additional oxidations to produce carnosic
  and/or pisiferic acid (CYP76AK6), or salviol (CYP71BE52). Arrows describe the fluxes
  through the yeast reconstructed pathway before (blue arrows) or after engineering
  (red arrows) for the specific production of pisiferic acid or salviol (Figure produced
  using ChemDraw Professional 15.1 and Microsoft Powerpoint).
