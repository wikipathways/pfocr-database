caption: Model of the PPARγ signaling pathway in human macrophages in response to
  virulent M. tuberculosis or ManLAM. Shown is a schematic based on our results along
  with those in the literature of how virulent M. tuberculosis infection or ManLAM
  stimulation induces PPARγ-mediated immunosuppression in macrophages. M. tuberculosis
  or ManLAM binds to the MR, which leads to upregulation of PPARγ expression through
  an MR-dependent signaling pathway and, simultaneously, to activation of MAPK-p38-mediated
  cPLA2, which leads to the release and hydrolysis of AA from the plasma membrane
  to generate the ligand for PPARγ (15-d-PGJ2). Activated PPARγ heterodimerizes with
  RXR, and they bind to PPREs in the IL-8 and COX2 promoters, thereby inducing their
  expression as well as expression of the MR. Activation of PPARγ leads to transrepression
  of NF-κB activity but promotes the generation of Th2 cytokines through PGE2 production.
