caption: Hippo signaling in tumor immunity. YAP/TAZ promotes the transcription of
  target genes, and its products include regulatory factors and receptors, which can
  promote the polarization of immune cells, recruit and enhance the stability of YAP/TAZ-TEAD
  complex, and finally inhibit the activity of CTLs. CTLs can be restarted by blocking
  the binding of receptor ligands. The solid arrow represents promotion, the solid
  dot represents inhibition.
