caption: 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma complexity: untangling the networks underlying
  genetic subtypes. Schematic view of the most relevant genetic events in B-cell physiology
  pathways for each genetic subtype (GS) highlighted in purple (MCD), light blue (BN2),
  yellow (EZB), green (N1), or red (ST2), as described in the figure key. Mutations
  in CD79A and CD79B and SYK lead to chronic activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR;
  of special importance in the MCD GS), which triggers the activation of SYK, BTK,
  and PKC promoting the formation of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex. Mutations in
  genes that encode all the components in this complex can be identified in a subset
  of DLBCLs and are especially relevant for the BN2 GS. Mutations in genes that encode
  MYD88, IRAK1, and IRAK4 activate Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is further
  promoted by alterations in positive regulators downstream TLR, such as TRAF6. Alterations
  in Notch signaling, binding of CD27 to CD70, and BCR activation also lead to abnormal
  activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which also presents genetic alterations in
  this disorder. Most of these pathways converge in the activation of IKK and downstream
  NF-κB signaling, promoting lymphomagenesis. Tumor cell survival is boosted by alterations
  in the BLC2 and BCL6 axis, TP53, and imbalances in cytokine related pathways: interleukins
  (IL), interferon gamma (IFNγ), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which overall lead
  to increased survival and decreased apoptosis in these cells. Alterations at the
  nuclear level are also common in all genetic subtypes (except for the N1 subtype),
  and involve p53, DNA damage pathway, epigenetic regulators, and other components
  involved in proliferation and survival cell processes. Currently, there are targeted
  therapies against several components downstream these pathways (tagged with a pill
  icon). Activating genetic events are highlighted with a star, while those involving
  inactivation are flagged with a hexagon.'
