caption: The mechanism of in vitro reduction of N2O by N2OR at its CuZ* center, showing
  the intermediates and the proton coupled electron transfer events from CuA center.
  The catalytically competent cycle is shown using solid arrows while the dashes indicate
  the slow alternative pathway in the absence of reductants. The conserved amino acid
  residues are labeled according to M. hydrocarbonoclasticus N2OR mature primary sequence.
  The scheme was adapted from reference [].
