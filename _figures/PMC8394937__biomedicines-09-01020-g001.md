caption: Schematic representation of metformin’s possible mechanism of action in OvCa
  therapy. Metformin, a first-line anti-diabetic drug, is likely to be associated
  with a reduced risk of cancer for those with T2DM. The most common pathway involves
  the activation of AMPK, which regulates energy metabolism by modulating complex
  1 of the respiratory chain in mitochondria by changes in the AMP/ATP ratio. Activated
  AMPK upregulates the tumor suppressor gene p53, which induces apoptosis and cell
  cycle arrest. Metformin binds with insulin, IGF, and cytokine receptors and modulates
  pathways involved in tumor progression. Upon binding, metformin inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and Ras/Raf/ERK pathways, leading to reductions of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation,
  thereby causing tumor cell death. Metformin, through AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition,
  could increase glucose uptake and glycolysis. Overall, metformin promotes phosphorylation,
  blocking nuclear translocation and impairing gene transcription, processes involved
  in cell survival, gluconeogenesis, and protein synthesis. The arrows ↑ and ↓ indicates
  upregulation and downregulation, respectively.
