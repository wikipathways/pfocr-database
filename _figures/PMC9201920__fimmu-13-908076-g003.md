caption: Effect of inflammatory miRNAs on AD inflammation. Multiple inflammatory miRNAs
  may play a synergistic or antagonistic role in different inflammatory pathways.
  For example, mir-146a targets the MyD88-related pathway by binding to TLR-4. At
  the same time, NF-κB is inhibited, preventing release of inflammatory factors. Meanwhile,
  miR-155 and miR-181a regulate a variety of inflammatory mediators. Microglial activation
  is important in various inflammatory processes and is stimulated by miR-34a and
  miR-486. Apoptosis, as the terminal link in the inflammatory response, also plays
  a significant part in the progression of AD and is regulated by miR-150.
