caption: 'Schematic representation of the SD and ED metabolic pathways in PHB accumulation
  recombinant E.coli . Dashed lines indicate multiple enzymatic steps. The bold lines
  indicate the enzymes of SD pathway including reactions catalyzed by SerACB and SdaA.
  The enzymes that had been overexpressed in this work were shown in boldface. G6P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; G3P, glycerahyde-3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphate-gluconate. Enzymes are as follows:
  Zwf, glucose 6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase; Edd, phosphogluconate dehydratase; Eda,
  2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 6-phosphate aldolase; Pgk, phosphoglycerate kinase; SerA,
  D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; SerB, phosphoserine phosphatase; SerC, 3-phosphoserine
  aminotransferase; SdaA, L-serine deaminase I; PoxB, pyruvate oxidase; Pta, phosphate
  acetyltransferase; Ack, acetate kinase; PhaA, β-ketothiolase; PhaB, NADPH-dependent
  acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; PhaC, PHB synthase.'
