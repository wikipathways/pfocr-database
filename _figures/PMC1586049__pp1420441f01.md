caption: 'Isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis via the MEP pathway. Intermediates involved
  in the biosynthesis are as follows: 1, pyruvate; 2, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  3, DXP; 4, MEP; 5, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol; 6, 2-phospho-4-(cytidine
  5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-d-erythritol; 7, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  8, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate; 9, isopentenyl diphosphate; 10,
  dimethylallyl diphosphate; 11, DX; and 12, ME. Genes encoding the enzymes of the
  pathway are as follows: dxs, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; dxr, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase; ygbP, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol synthase;
  ychB, 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; ygbB, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; gcpE, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate
  synthase; lytB, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase; and idi,
  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.'
