caption: CXCR2 activated JAK3/STAT3 signaling pathway exacerbating hepatotoxicity
  associated with tacrolimus. The red and green arrows represented the expression
  of proteins after tacrolimus intervention, where the red arrows facing up meant
  the expression of proteins were up-regulated, the green arrows facing down meant
  the expression of proteins were down-regulated. The brown arrows represented the
  expression of proteins after CXCR2 antagonist intervention, where the arrows facing
  up meant the expression of proteins were up-regulated, the arrows facing down meant
  the expression of proteins were down-regulated. JAK3 and STAT3 referred to their
  phosphorylated forms (p-JAK3 and p-STAT3)
