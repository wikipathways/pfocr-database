caption: Pin1 is highly expressed in adult neurons where it helps to keep tau and
  APP in healthy shape. Tau plays a key role in stabilizing microtubular structures.
  While the role of APP is poorly understood, it may have important neurotrophic properties.
  Once phosphorylated by protein kinases on specific sites, tau and APP can exist
  in –cis- and trans- conformations. The trans- isomer is still retains its physiological
  function and can be dephosphorylated and degraded. The cis- isomer is non-functional
  and is resistant to both dephosphorylation and degradation. Cis-APP is processed
  by the amyloidogenic pathway into pathogenic Aβ42. Pin1 protects ptau and pAPP by
  catalyzing their conversion from cis to trans as well as promoting their dephosphorylation.
  If Pin1 is absent or deficient, the GSK3 hyperphosphorylates tau and the cis conformation
  accumulates, eventually leading to plaque and tangle formation, neurodegeneration
  and cell death.
