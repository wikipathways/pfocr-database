caption: (A) Engineering levopimaradiene synthesis in E. coli. A plant-derived pathway
  was constructed by introducing T. chinensis ggpps and G. biloba lps codon-optimized
  genes. To amplify the endogenous precursor pools of GGPPS substrates (IPP and DMAPP),
  copy numbers of rate-limiting steps (dxs, idi, ispD, ispF) in the MEP pathway were
  amplified by additional episomal expression. (B) General reaction mechanism of “LPS-type”
  enzymes. Levopimaradiene, the major product of G. biloba LPS is the gateway precursor
  of ginkgolides. Coproducts of LPS include abietadiene, neoabiatadiene, and sandaracopimaradiene
  that stem from the different deprotonation patterns throughout intermediates in
  the reaction cascade.
