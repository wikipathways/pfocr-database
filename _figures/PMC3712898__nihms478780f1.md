caption: (A) S-Nitrosylation plays a dynamic role in both normal and aberrant neuronal
  signal transduction pathways. Initially, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase,
  with consequent increase in production of cGMP, was identified as an NO-mediated
  signal transduction pathway. Additionally, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), derived from reaction
  of NO· and superoxide anion (O2−·), can mediate neurotoxicity in part via a protein
  posttranslational modification of tyrosine residues termed nitration. However, emerging
  evidence suggests that NO species mediate signal transduction predominantly via
  protein S-nitrosylation, a posttranslational redox modification of critical cysteine
  residues that affects protein activity and function. Under physiological conditions,
  NO is produced in neurons predominantly by nNOS, which is activated by calcium influx
  through NMDAR-associated ion channels. Extrasynaptic in addition to synaptic NMDARs
  can lead to NO production, particularly during excitotoxic injury when excessive
  NO is generated. This can lead to aberrant protein S-nitrosylation whereby cysteine
  residues, which would not ordinarily be S-nitrosylated by physiological levels of
  NO, undergo S-nitrosylation because of the high levels of NO generated in disease
  states.(B) S-Nitrosylation as a determinant of CNS disease progression. Physiological
  (normal) levels of NO can mediate neuroprotective effects, at least in part, by
  S-nitrosylating caspase and HDAC2. Additionally, during periods of moderate stress,
  NO can still facilitate protection of neurons, for instance, via S-nitrosylation
  of NMDARs to downregulate excessive activity, representing a negative feedback mechanism.
  However, persistent hyperactivation of neuronal NMDARs (predominantly extrasynaptic
  receptors) induces excessive stimulation of nNOS and thus increased production of
  NO that contributes to synaptic injury and cell death. Glial cells (astrocytes and
  microglia) can also generate high levels of NO via iNOS activity. We and others
  have reported evidence that overproduction of NO can be neurotoxic via aberrant
  S-nitrosylation of parkin, PDI, GAPDH, MMP-2/9, Cdk5, Drp1 and other proteins that
  contribute to accumulation of misfolded proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic
  damage, and neuronal cell death.
