caption: AD is an extremely heterogeneous neurological disorder. Just as there are
  multiple factors that have significant potential to contribute to AD type and AD
  symptomatic and molecular-genetic heterogeneity, the neuropathological pathways
  and pathway biomarkers encompassing these factors can be intercepted and interrogated
  to obtain extremely useful diagnostic information which more clearly define the
  prodrome, onset and course of AD as well as related progressive neurodegenerative
  disorders. The pervasive and modulatory nature of miRNAs in both brain tissues and
  multiple biofluid compartments (such as the ECF, CSF, and blood serum) make miRNAs
  ideal candidates to expand our understanding of the diagnosis of temporal aspects
  of the AD pathophysiology.
