caption: Schematic diagram shows the role of miR-132/212 in Ang II-induced VSMC dysfunction.
  Ang II signaling through AT1R activates CREB (Ser-133 phosphorylation) and increases
  levels of miR-132 and miR-212 cluster. Increased levels of miR-132 inhibit the expression
  of PTEN via targeting its 3′-UTRs. PTEN inhibition increases key proinflammatory
  gene MCP-1. On the other hand, down-regulation of RASA1, an inhibitor of Ras/Raf/MAPK
  pathway, leads to activation of CREB, a key regulator of VSMC dysfunction. CREB
  activation can also promote a positive feedback mechanism by further increasing
  miR-132 and miR-212 levels.
