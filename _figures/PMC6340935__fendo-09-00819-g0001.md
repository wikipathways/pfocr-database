caption: 'The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) leads to UDP-GlcNAc formation
  and regulates O-GlcNAcylation. This pathway is regulated by only three enzymes:
  GFAT (glutamine fructose-6P aminotransferase), OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase) and OGA
  (O-GlcNAcase). These three enzymes can be targeted by pharmacological compounds
  to modulate O-GlcNAc levels. Some of them decrease O-GlcNAc levels such as DON and
  azaserine inhibiting GFAT or Alloxan, BZX and BADGP inhibiting OGT. OGA inhibitors
  like PUGNAc, NButGT, Thiamet-G and GlcNAcstatin increase protein O-GlcNAcylation.'
