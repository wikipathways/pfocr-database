caption: De novo serine–glycine biosynthesis. ATF4 leads to an increase in the expression
  of enzymes involved in serine–glycine synthesis. 3-PG is converted into serine and
  glycine by four enzymatic reactions. 3-PG (3-phosphoglycerate); PHGDH (phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase); 3-PHP (3-phosphohydroxypyruvate); PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase
  1); 3-PS (3-phosphoserine); PSPH (phosphoserine phosphatase); SHMT1/2 (serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  1/2).
