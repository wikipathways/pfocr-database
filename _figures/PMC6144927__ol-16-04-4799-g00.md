caption: TGF-β signaling maintains homeostasis between the proliferation and apoptosis
  of normal epithelial cells by Smads or other Smad-independent downstream pathways.
  Increased levels of TGF-β contribute to angiogenesis, thus shaping a tumor microenvironment
  that allows uncontrolled epithelial proliferation. Increased DAB2 and activated
  Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, as well as defective TGF-β signaling, which includes
  changes in Smad4, TβRI and TβRII, are in favor of uncontrolled proliferation of
  transformed cells. In addition, TGF-β induces increased MMP-9 and decreased E-cadherin
  levels, which are hallmarks of EMT. Furthermore, tumor and stromal cells produce
  increased TGF-β levels, forming a vicious cycle. TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;
  DAB2, disabled homolog 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TβR, TGF-β receptor;
  MMP-9, matrix metalloprotease 9; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; TAK1-p38/JNK, TGF-β-activated kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; SBE, Smad-binding element.
