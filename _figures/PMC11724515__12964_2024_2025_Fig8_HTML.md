caption: 'Sirtuins 1/3/4/6 exert disparate influences on stem cell differentiation
  and insulin secretion. The positive and negative roles of Sirtuins 1/3/4/6 in stem
  cell differentiation and insulin secretion were summarized. It was demonstrated
  that miR-132/155/449 and VK2 downregulate SIRT1 through multiple pathways, which
  in turn affects the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. SIRT3 overexpression has
  been demonstrated to attenuate ERS, thereby weakening the inhibitory effect of ERS
  on insulin secretion. SIRT4 inhibits GDH activity through ADP-ribosylation, thereby
  downregulating insulin secretion. Additionally, SIRT4 reduces lipid acetyl-coenzyme
  α oxidation in the mitochondria, which collectively downregulates insulin secretion.
  SIRT6, on the other hand, promotes insulin secretion through the FoxO1-Pdx1-Glut2
  pathway in pancreatic β cells, which secrete insulin. Abbreviation: VK2, vitamin
  K2; AMPK, the serine/threonine kinase AMP-activated protein kinase; FRA-1, fos-related
  antigen-1; BMSCs, bone mesenchymal stem cells; ADP-Ribose, rapid synthesis of poly;
  GDP, guanosine 5’-diphosphate; Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum
