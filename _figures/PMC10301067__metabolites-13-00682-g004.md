caption: Tryptophan metabolism pathway in SLS. Twenty-three metabolites were measured.
  Statistically significant metabolites in SLS are indicated by a number in parentheses
  corresponding to the ratio of the mean SLS to the mean control. Metabolites that
  lack an associated number were either not measured or did not differ between the
  groups. Note that oxindolylalanine (SLS/control = 0.58, Supplementary Table S2),
  which is a product of bacterial tryptophan metabolism in the intestine, is not shown
