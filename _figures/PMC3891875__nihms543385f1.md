caption: Wnt signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is targeted for
  degradation by a protein complex that contains axin and glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3). Binding of Wnt ligand to the frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) receptors leads to stabilization of β-catenin and its translocation
  to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. Noncanonical/Wnt signals
  are transduced through frizzled family receptors and Ror2/RYK coreceptors to Dsh-dependent
  (Rho family guanosine-5'-triphosphate [GTP]ases and Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK])
  or Ca2+ -dependent signaling cascades. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has a major role
  in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development and
  after birth. Wnt pathway in osteoblasts is also controlled by osterix, an osteoblast-specific
  transcription factor. Mechanical loading and unloading of bone is perceived by the
  osteocyte, triggering release or inhibition of biochemical signals including sclerostin.
  Negative regulators of Wnt signaling including secreted frizzled-related proteins
  (sFRP), Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), Wnt-inhibitory factor-1 (WIF), Cerberus (Cer), Wnt modulator
  of surface ectoderm (Wise), and bone-specific sclerostin all act extracellularly.
  The binding of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 results in the formation of Dkk1-LRP5/6-Kremen
  complex and endocytosis and degradation of LRP5/6, making it unavailable to interact
  with Wnt and frizzled. The Wnt inhibitor Wise also binds to the Wnt coreceptors
  LRP. In contrast to broadly expressed Dkk1, expression of sclerostin is restricted
  to osteocytes. Sclerostin binds to LRP5 and prevents the formation of a Wnt-LRP–frizzled
  complex. sFRPs may bind Wnts or frizzleds. sFRP also has been shown to bind to receptor
  activator for nuclear factor-κB (RANKL) and prevent osteoclastogenesis. APC—adenomatous
  polyposis coli; NFAT—nuclear factor of activated T cells; NLK—nemo-like kinase;
  OPG—osteoprotegerin; PKC—protein kinase C; TCF—T-cell factors.
