caption: 'Model of Adamts1-mediated impairment of MSCs adipocyte commitment. Adipogenesis
  is a bi-phasic process: lineage commitment into preadipocytes, and terminal differentiation
  into mature adipocytes. Adamts1 is predominantly implicated in adipocyte lineage
  commitment and contributes to the development of obesity. Adamts1 impairs adipocyte
  lineage commitment through ECM remodeling following by activating FAK–ERK signaling
  pathway. Additionally, miR-181d, upregulated by BMP4, dominated Adamts1-ECM-FAK–ERK
  axis during adipocyte lineage commitment'
