caption: TGF-β signaling pathway in gene expression regulation. Upon TGF-β ligand
  binding, TGF-β receptor is activated. Then it phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 (receptor-regulated
  SMADs). These R-SMADs form a complex with SMAD4 (common mediator SMAD), which translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. SMAD7 acts as a negative
  feedback regulator by inhibiting this pathway. Parts of the figure were drawn using
