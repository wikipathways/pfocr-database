caption: (A) Neurons of the first olfactory synapse prior to odor exposure. (B) Chronic
  odor exposure induces synaptic vesicle release by ORNs as well as the activation
  of a non-canonical N pathway in ORNs that is required for an increase in glomerular
  volume. This non-canonical pathway does not require the N ligand Dl or Aph-1 dependent
  N cleavage, suggesting that in its non-canonical role N is acting at the membrane.
  (C) Neurotransmitter release by ORNs activates both PNs and LNs and in the simplest
  hypothesis activates Dl in the PNs. (D) Dl in PNs signals back to the ORNs, activating
  the canonical N signal transduction pathway to limit the increase in glomerular
  size. This feedback loop could be thought of as a homeostatic mechanism to regulate
  glomerular volume in the presence of chronic odor. (E) N activity in ORNs also alters
  the physiological response of ORNs to odor, resulting in changes in the activity
  of their cognate PNs. The change in ORN physiology persists for at least one day
  after exposure to chronic odor ceases.
