caption: 'Drug targeting on skin cancer stem cell niche. The figure depicts the principal
  signaling pathways involved in the regulation of the skin cancer stem cell niche,
  alongside an overview of FDA-approved drugs and those currently undergoing clinical
  trials for the treatment of skin cancer. These therapeutic agents encompass: A inhibitors
  targeting SMO and GLI expression within the Shh signaling pathway; B suppressors
  of porcupine and promoters of β-catenin degradation complex activity within the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade; C inhibitors targeting YAP/TAZ signaling activity;
  D γ-secretase inhibitors targeting Notch signaling; and E inhibitors blocking integrin-related
  signaling pathways, such as FAK/Src, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways,
  and those targeting integrins, which are typically absent in the skin stem cell
  niche. FDA, Food and Drug Administration; SMO, Smoothened; PTCH, Patched; Gli, Glioma-associated
  oncogene homolog; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; YAP/TAZ, Yes-associated
  protein/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD, TEA domain transcription
  factor; ECM, Extracellular matrix; FAK, Focal adhesion kinase; PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/AKT/Mammalian target of rapamycin; JAK/STAT3, Signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; NF-κB, Nuclear factor-kappa B; PAX3, Paired Box 3; MITF, Microphthalmia-Associated
  Transcription Factor. Some figure components were created in BioRender. Pham, Q.
