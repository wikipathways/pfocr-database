caption: Targeting cytokine storm via the JAK-STAT pathway. During a cytokine storm,
  there are increased levels of IL-6 which can form a complex with mIL-6R to act on
  gp130. Gp130 regulates levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and GM-CSF via the JAK-STAT pathway.
  This could facilitate the cytokine storm. Inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway, potentially
  using IL-6 inhibitors or direct inhibition of signaling, can be a therapeutic strategy
  (depending on the timing—indicated preferably at later stages of illness, not in
  early phase, or at clinical signs of cytokine storm). SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IL, interleukin; mIL-6R,
  membrane bound interleukin-6 receptor; gp 130, glycoprotein 130; MCP-1, monocytes
  chemoattractant protein-1; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
  JAK-STAT, janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription.
