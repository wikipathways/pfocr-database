caption: Regulation of apoptosis by IRFs. IRF-1 is a tumor suppressor and a regulatory
  factor of the IFN-γ system, with IFN-γ promoting the expression of IRF-1. IFN-α
  also induces the rapid phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT-1, followed
  by the accumulation of IRF-1 and IRF7. These two transcription factors bind to the
  TRAIL promoter and induce TRAIL expression. TRAIL is a key participant in the apoptotic
  pathway and plays a significant role in IFN-induced cell killing. IRF-3 is also
  involved in the transcriptional induction of TRAIL, where it transactivates the
  TRAIL promoter upon viral infection, upregulating TRAIL transcription. Conversely,
  IRF4 actively inhibits the transactivation mediated by IRF1. IRF3 triggers apoptosis
  through the RIPA pathway, which depends on the linear ubiquitination of specific
  lysine residues of IRF3. Within the RIPA signaling pathway, IRF3 interacts with
  the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to form the IRF3-Bax complex and translocates to the
  mitochondria, catalyzing the release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm, subsequently
  activating Caspase, and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Otulin, a deubiquitinase
  that removes linear ubiquitin chains, inhibits RIPA by deubiquitinating IRF3 in
  virus-infected cells
