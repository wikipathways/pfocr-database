caption: Thiamine in the form of thiamine diphosphate (TPP) is an important cofactor
  for three key enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolic pathways. The first is transketolase
  of the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts glucose metabolites to pentose
  nucleic acids for nucleotide synthesis and generates NADPH for reductive biosynthesis
  including that of fatty acids, cholesterol, and steroid hormones. The second is
  pyruvate dehydrogenase in the glycolysis pathway that converts pyruvate to acetyl
  coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) with subsequent entry into the Krebs cycle. During thiamine
  deficiency, conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA is blocked and pyruvate is converted
  to lactate. This may result in lactic acidosis that can be reversed with repletion
  of thiamine. The third enzyme is α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes
  the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl coenzyme A in the Krebs cycle and
  produces NADH utilized for ATP synthesis. Thiamine deficiency compromises NADPH,
  NADH and ATP production as well as reductive biosynthetic reactions, which together
  ultimately leads to organ dysfunction.NADP+, oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-phosphate;
  NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-phosphate; NAD+, oxidized nicotinamide
