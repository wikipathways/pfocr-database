caption: Interactions of endocannabinoid with arachidonic acid metabolism and effects
  of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Main endocannabinoids in humans
  include arachidonyl‐ethanolamide (AEA) and 2‐arachidonoyl‐glycerol (2‐AG). AEA can
  be obtained from N‐acyl‐phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) via hydrolysis or by conjugation
  of ethanoloamine and arachidonic acid (AA). AEA can be also hydrolyzed to AA by
  the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). FAAH might be inhibited by NSAIDs. 2‐AG comes
  from diacylglycerol (DAG) through the actions of DAG lipase (DAGL). 2‐AG can be
  also hydrolyzed by monoacylglyserol lipase (MGL) to AA. Endocannabinoids also metabolized
  by eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes including COX2, 12‐LOX, 15‐LOX, and cytochrome
  P450. The NSAIDs inhibiting COX2 can enhance endocannabinoid levels and reduce AEA‐
  and 2‐AG‐derived prostaglandins. COX—cyclooxygenase; Cyt—cytochrome; EET—epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acid; HETE—hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; LOX—lipoxygenase; PLA—phospholipase; and
  PG—prostaglandin
