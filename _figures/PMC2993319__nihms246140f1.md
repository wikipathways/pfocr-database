caption: Measures of positive selection are typically calculated by dividing the number
  of non-synonymous changes (depicted in red) by the number of synonymous changes
  (depicted in blue); a value greater than one is used as evidence for positive selection.
  Screening genomes for genes under positive selection is one important step; however,
  other measures such as links to behavior and expression need to be incorporated.
  Furthermore, a gene does not have to have undergone positive selection to be a disease-susceptibility
  gene. Other changes in evolution such as timing or location of expression could
  make a gene or signaling pathway vulnerable in disease.
