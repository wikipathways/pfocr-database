caption: The pivotal role of DNA methyltransferase in DNA methylation and HCC progression.
  First, osteopontin increases the expression of DNMT1 in HCC stem cells, then induces
  the DNA methylation of RASSF1A, GATA4 and cyclin‐dependent kinase‐like 2 (CDKL2)
  gene promoters and decreases their protein expressions to activate HCC tumour stem
  cells. Besides, under the influence of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c‐Met
  axis, upregulated DNMT1 expression leads to DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor
  genes myocardin (MYOCD), pannexin 2 (PANX2) and LIM homeobox 9 (LHX9), decreasing
  related protein expression and promoting the malignant progression of HCC. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS)‐induced high expression of Snail via activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β
  pathway also contributes to the methylation of E‐cadherin promoters by recruiting
  DNMT1, which lowers E‐cadherin expression and ultimately increases invasion and
  metastasis of HCC. Meanwhile, zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) recruits DNMT1 to miR‐16‐5p
  DNA promoter, inhibiting the transcription of miR‐16‐5p through DNA methylation,
  thereby regulating HCC progression. mTOR signalling activation also promotes DNA
  methylation by inducing DNMT1 translation, contributing to the malignant development
  of HCC. At last, the HBV‐X protein can induce methylation of CpG island in the MAT1
  promoter, promote the transcription of the MAT1 gene by recruiting DNMT3a and DNMT3b,
  then interfering with the DNA binding of p53 in a specific DNA region and inhibiting
  p53 transcription. Subsequently, MAT1 significantly promotes the malignant progression
  of HCC. These studies demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase directly affects the
  DNA methylation level of various essential genes, thereby contributing to the rapid
  progression of HCC
