caption: ① Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and advanced glycation end‐products lead
  to sorbitol accumulation through the polyol pathway; ② increase metabolic stress,
  and induce anaerobic metabolism and energy failure with decreased adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) production; resulting in ③ Na+/K+ pump dysfunction; which ④ reduces the transmembrane
  concentration gradients of both sodium and potassium; consequently, there is ⑤ a
  decrease in potassium conductance by hypoactive K f channels, resulting in increased
  superexcitability.
