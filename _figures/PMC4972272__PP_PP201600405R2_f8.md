caption: Model for the modulation of hypocotyl growth by SOB3. Increased temperature
  leads to hypocotyl elongation through a pathway that is at least partially mediated
  through YUC8 and SAUR19 subfamily members. Heat induces the expression of YUC8,
  which leads to enhanced auxin production. Auxin promotes physical interactions between
  SCFTIR1 and AUX/IAA repressors, inhibiting the activity of AUX/IAAs by promoting
  their degradation. This leads to the attenuation of posttranslational repression
  of ARF activity by AUX/IAAs, which in turn promotes the transcription of growth-promoting
  SAUR19 subfamily members. Based on the results of this study, we propose that SOB3
  inhibits hypocotyl elongation by some combination of direct and indirect repression
  of SAUR19 subfamily member expression. SOB3 inhibits production of the hormone signal,
  auxin, by binding to the promoter of YUC8 and repressing its expression, which in
  turn leads to the inhibition of SAUR19 to SAUR24 transcription via the SCFTIR1-mediated
  auxin signaling pathway. Additionally, SAUR19 to SAUR24 are repressed directly at
  the transcriptional level by SOB3.
