caption: 'A simplified diagram of the key type-1 cytokine/receptor interactions relevant
  for immunity against intracellular bacteria, derived from published gene knockout
  mouse studies. Following infection with mycobacteria, macrophages/dendritic cells
  become activated via ‘toll’ receptors which result in secretion of biologically
  active IL-12, a heterodimeric molecule (IL-12p70), comprising a p40 and a p35 subunit.This
  acts on NK cells and antigen-stimulated CD4 T cells to secrete IFNγ. Both cell types
  express dimeric IL-12 receptors comprised of β1 and β2 chains. IL-12 also promotes
  responding CD4 T cells to develop along the TH1 pathway. IFNγ homodimers stimulate:
  (a) macrophage/dendritic cells enhancing their antimicrobial activity and (b) T
  cells and NK cells in an autocrine fashion, via ligation of IFNγ receptors comprised
  of paired γR1/R2 chain dimers. Patients with Type-1 cytokine pathway defects demonstrate
  the relevance of this cascade for human immunity to mycobacteria and salmonella
  infections. (Modified from .'
