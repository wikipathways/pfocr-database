caption: A. Proposed model of noncanonical HIF-1 inhibition lifting HIF-1-mediated
  repression of host defense genes. Infection by S. aureus causes induction of host
  defense genes. Some of these genes are also induced by HIF, while others are repressed
  by HIF. Genes induced by HIF include genes that mediate resistance to pore-forming
  toxins (PFT) and P. aeruginosa. Genes that are repressed by HIF include genes that
  mediate resistance to S. aureus. Canonical HIF regulation mediated by VHL-1 requires
  EGL-9 catalytic activity and controls the gene-inductive activity of HIF. O2 is
  a signal driving HIF inhibition by the canonical pathway. Noncanonical HIF regulation,
  which is independent of EGL-9 catalytic activity but requires SWAN-1, controls the
  gene-repressive activity of HIF. The signal(s) that regulate noncanonical signaling
  are currently not known. B. Diagram of predicted and observed phenotypes in mutants
  defective in canonical or noncanonical HIF signaling.
