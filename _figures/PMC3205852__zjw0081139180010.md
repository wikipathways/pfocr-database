caption: Schematic illustrating the potential role of integrin β3 (ITGB3) in ROS-induced
  migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. The accumulation of ROS could
  up-regulate the expression integrin β3, which may alter the expression of the αvβ3
  integrin heterodimers. This change may increase the activity of proliferation, migration,
  and invasion of colorectal cancer cells directly or by activating the downstream
  targets such as STMN1 through PI3K or MAPK pathways. Integrin signaling is predominantly
  initiated through the recruitment of focal adhesion complexes, which are composed
  of integrins, Src-family kinases (SFKs), and focal adhesion kinase. SOD-1 is an
  antioxidase that can reduce the accumulation of ROS. GRB2 is an important adaptor
  protein in integrin signaling. DJ-1 is a suppressor of PTEN, which antagonizes PI3K-Akt
  pathway. ECM, extracellular matrix.
