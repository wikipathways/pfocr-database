caption: Most univariate and multivariate probability theories were derived for data
  space where N (number of samples) > D (number of dimensions). Expression data are
  usually very different (D>>>N). A study of 100 mRNA populations (one from each of
  100 tumours) arrayed against 10,000 genes can be viewed as each of the 100 tumours
  existing in 10,000-D space. This data structure is the inverse of an epidemiological
  study of 10,000 subjects (samples) for which there are data from 100 measurements
  (dimensions), yet both data sets contain 106 data points. A further concern arises
  from the multimodal nature of high-dimensional data spaces. The dynamic nature of
  cancer and the concurrent activity of multiple biological processes occurring within
  the microenvironment of a tumour create a multimodal data set. Genes combine into
  pathways; pathways combine into networks. Genes, pathways and/or networks interact
  to affect subphenotypes (proliferation, apoptosis); subphenotypes contribute to
  clinically relevant observations (tumour size, proliferation rate). Genes in pathway
  2 are directly associated with a network (and with pathway 1) and a common subphenotype
  (increased proliferation). Genes in pathway 2 are also inversely associated with
  a subphenotype (apoptosis). Here, multimodality captures the complex redundancy
  and degeneracy of biological systems and the concurrent expression of multiple components
  of a complex phenotype. For example, tumour growth reflects the balance between
  cell survival, proliferation and death, and cell loss from the tumour (such as through
  invasion and metastasis), each being regulated by a series of cellular signals and
  functions. Many such complex functions may coexist, such as growth-factor or hormonal
  stimulation of tumour cell survival or proliferation, or the ability to regulate
  a specific cell-death cascade. A molecular profile from a tumour may contain subpatterns
  of genes that reflect each of these individual characteristics. This multimodality
  may be problematic for statistical modelling to build either accurate cell signalling
  networks or robust classification schemes.
