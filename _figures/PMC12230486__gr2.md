caption: Address Drugs and Treatment Measures Targeting Different Metabolic Pathways
  to Better Achieve Cardiac Protection Through Metabolic Pathway InterventionThis
  figure illustrates the intricate network of metabolic pathways and regulatory factors
  involved in cellular energy homeostasis, particularly in cardiac metabolism. The
  diagram highlights the interactions between glucose and fatty acid metabolism under
  various physiological and pharmacological conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha
  (HIF-1α) is activated under hypoxic conditions, leading to increased expression
  of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and enhanced glucose uptake. HIF-1α also regulates
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex, thereby reducing glucose oxidation and promoting glycolysis. The AMPK pathway
  intersects with HIF-1α, further enhancing glucose uptake and glycolysis. The phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT pathway is upregulated by AMPK, leading to increased glycolysis
  and energy provision. This pathway is essential for cellular survival and metabolism,
  especially under stress conditions. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
  (PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARδ) are key regulators of fatty acid metabolism. They control
  fatty acid uptake, oxidation, and overall lipid homeostasis. The PGC-1α/PPARα pathway
  is particularly important in promoting fatty acid oxidation, thereby enhancing energy
  supply. βOHB = β-hydroxybutyrate; AcAc = acetyl-CoA; CAT-1 = carnitine acylcarnitine
