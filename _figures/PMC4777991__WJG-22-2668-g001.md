caption: Regulation of insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway by microRNAs in
  hepatocellular carcinoma. A schematic representation indicating the insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway with its different members. MicroRNAs were
  shown to impact differentially IGF members. Some microRNAs induce the expression
  of their downstream IGF target (showed as an arrow), while others inhibit the expression
  of their downstream targets (showed as dash-ended line). Interestingly, some microRNAs
  showed an inhibitory effect on their downstream target directly as well as indirectly,
  such as miR-1275 and Let-7a.
