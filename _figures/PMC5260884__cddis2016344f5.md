caption: Schematic figure summarizing the critical roles of sperm-specific NHEs and
  CatSper. Upon ejaculation, sperm stored in the male reproductive tract enter the
  uterine cavity where they experience a natural decrease of pH and HCO3−. Normally,
  sperm adapt quickly to the environment of the female reproductive tract, particularly
  via Na+/H+ exchangers that are localized to the principal piece of of the sperm
  flagellum. However, in spermNHE-null and Nha1/2-null mice, sperm show attenuated
  sAC-cAMP signalling and reduced motility, resulting in failure of movement towards
  the ampulla of the uterine tubes to fertilize eggs. The increase in pHi activates
  a sperm-specific Ca2+ permeable channel complex known as CatSper, which allows an
  intracellular Ca2+ increase and activation of the Ca2+/CaM/kinase signalling pathway
  essential for hyperactivation
