caption: At least three different mechanisms could account for the neuroprotective
  effect of increased glutathione (GSH) release from astrocytes. (a) First, GSH reacts
  non-enzymatically with a variety of radicals and might function as a first line
  of defence against ROS/RNS in the extracellular space. (b) Second, it has been proposed
  that GSH might be a glia-derived neuromodulator and/or neurotransmitter. (c) Third,
  released GSH is hydrolysed by the γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) present on the
  external surfaces of astrocytes. The GGT produces the dipeptide cysteinyl-glycine,
  which then can be hydrolysed by the aminopeptidase N (APN) to release cysteine and
  glycine. (d) Astrocytes also release glutamine and hence make available all the
  necessary precursors for neuronal GSH synthesis. X, any acceptor of the γ-glutamyl
  moiety; MRP1, multidrug-resistance-associated protein 1; GCL, glutamate cysteine
  ligase; GS, glutathione synthase.
