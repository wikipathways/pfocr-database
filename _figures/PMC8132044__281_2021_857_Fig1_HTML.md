caption: Identified molecular mechanisms underlying TARC/CCL17 synthesis in selected
  cell types. Mechanisms involved in induction of TARC/CCL17 synthesis are shown schematically
  for a human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT) and b human monocytes and murine bone
  marrow–derived macrophages. In HaCaT cells, TNF-α and IFN-γ induce JAK2, p38 MAPK,
  and Raf-1 activation by phosphorylation after ligation to their dedicated receptors
  [, ]. Subsequently, activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates STAT1 and NFκB, inducing their
  activation and translocation into the nucleus to trigger TARC/CCL17 synthesis [].
  b In human monocytes and murine macrophages, IL-4 and IL-13-induced phosphorylation
  and homodimerization of STAT6 (following engagement of both types of IL-4 receptors)
  triggers TARC/CCL17 expression directly by binding the TARC gene promoter [, ].
  In addition, activated STAT6 increases transcription of IRF4 and JMJD3, and the
  latter induces the demethylation of repressive H3K27me3 in the IRF4 promoter region,
  resulting in enhanced expression of the transcription factor IRF4 that binds directly
  to the TARC/CCL17 promoter (*the latter mechanism is demonstrated after IL-4 but
  not IL-13-induction of STAT6) []. A similar pathway is involved in GM-CSF-induced
  TARC/CCL17 transcription, probably through STAT5 activation []. Engagement of the
  type 1 IL-4Rα/common-γ chain heterodimeric receptor by IL-4 also recruits IRS2,
  inducing its phosphorylation and activation. In turn, IRS2 phosphorylates/activates
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, ultimately leading to TARC/CCL17 transcription []. SOCS1 expression
  is also induced by IL-4 in healthy human monocytes and has been shown to interact
  directly with IRS2 and downregulate its activity, through ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation []. This figure was created with BioRender.com. IFN interferon, IL interleukin,
  IRF interferon regulatory factor, IRS insulin receptor substrate, JAK Janus kinase,
  JMJD3 Jumonji domain-containing protein D3, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinases,
  NFκB nuclear factor-kappa B, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, STAT signal transducer
  and activator of transcription, SOCS suppressor of cytokine signaling protein, TNF
