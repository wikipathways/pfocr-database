caption: Contribution of Sox17-induced gene products to the maintenance of the hematopoietic
  capacity and cluster formation. In the hemogenic endothelial cells (the lower part
  of the figure), Sox7 and Sox17 activate the genes encoding endothelial cell marker
  proteins and Sox18 induces expression of the GATA1 and Scl genes. Moreover, Sox7
  inhibits the interaction of Runx1 with its cognate DNA sequence by direct binding
  of Sox7 to Runx1. In the hemogenic endothelial cells, Sox17 decreases the expression
  of Runx1 and GATA1, which are essential transcription factors for definitive hematopoiesis,
  by binding to the Runx1 and GATA2 promoter regions and inhibiting transcription.
  In the IAHCs (the upper part of the figure), Sox17 directly activates the gene expression
  of Notch1. Notch intra-cellular domain (NICD), which is an activated form of Notch1,
  induces the expression of Hes1, and Notch1- and Hes1-induced gene products are involved
  in the inhibition of differentiation. Adherent molecules VEC and ESAM, which are
  directly induced by Sox17, have roles in forming cell clusters with hematopoietic
  capacity. The reduced expression of Sox17 in IAHCs leads to the increased expression
  of Runx1 and GATA2. The TPO/c-Mpl signaling pathway is required for the proliferation
  of Sox17-transduced cells. The involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway and the
  TGF-β signaling pathway in maintaining the hematopoietic capacity of IAHCs by Sox17
  is reported. Sox18 target genes in IAHCs have not been identified
