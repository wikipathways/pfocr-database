caption: Partial pathway reconstruction of genes involved in lipids, nucleotides and
  vitamins metabolism. Only metabolic enzymes with significant differences in relative
  abundance (q < 0.05) between male and female ticks and KEGG annotation were included
  in this analysis. Continuous lines represent reactions catalyzed by the enzymes
  with significant differences in relative abundance between male and female ticks.
  Dashed lines represent pathway reconstruction based in KEGG. DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone
