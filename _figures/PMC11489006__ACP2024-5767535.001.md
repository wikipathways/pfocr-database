caption: The Hippo signaling pathway. The core mechanism of the Hippo signaling pathway
  involves the intricate orchestration of phosphorylation driven by several upstream
  signals. Upon pathway activation, MST1/2 kinases and SAV1 collaborate to form a
  complex that executes phosphorylation and activates LATS1/2. Subsequently, the downstream
  actors of this pathway, namely YAP/TAZ proteins, undergo phosphorylation by LATS1/2
  kinases. This triggers the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins, facilitating their sequestration
  in the cytoplasm or triggering their degradation. When the Hippo signaling pathway
  deactivates, YAP/TAZ undergo dephosphorylation, facilitating their movement into
  the nucleus, where they form a partnership with the TEADs transcription factors.
  Together, this assemblage regulates the genes essential for endothelial cell proliferation,
  migration, and survival. The constituents include MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like kinase),
  SAV1 (scaffold protein salvador), LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinase), TAZ (transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), YAP (yes-associated protein), and TEAD (TEA
  domain family member)
