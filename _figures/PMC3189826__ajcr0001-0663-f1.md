caption: p130Cas and p140Cap signalling involved in migration and invasion. Upon extracellular
  matrix binding or growth factors stimulation, integrins and Receptor Protein Tyrosine
  Kinases (RPTK) represent the major upstream regulators of p130Cas and p140Cap, mainly
  through the regulation of Src kinase activity. Once tyrosine phosphory-lated by
  Src, p130Cas recruits proteins that activate downstream pathways, resulting in actin
  cytoskeleton reorganization, increased cell motility and migration. p130Cas by acting
  on metalloproteinases (MMPs) promoter is also required for the invasive program.
  Upon cell matrix adhesion or mitogen stimulus, p140Cap inhibits Src kinase activity
  and p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and p130Cas/Crk complex formation. As a consequence,
  the effect of p130Cas on actin cytoskeleton re-organization is impaired and cell
  migration and invasion are inhibited. Moreover, by inactivating Src, p140Cap also
  regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway through E-cadherin-dependent
  inactivation of EGFR signalling. p140Cap by interacting with E-cadherin and EGFR
  at the cell membrane, immobilizes E-Cadherin at the cell membrane thus preventing
  cell migration and invasion.
