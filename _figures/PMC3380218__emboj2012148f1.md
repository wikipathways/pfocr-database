caption: 'Model of the Drosophila IMD and mammalian TNF signalling pathways. Ligand
  binding causes clustering of PGRP receptors (Drosophila) or TNF-R1 receptors (mammals)
  followed by recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Imd and dFADD or RIP1 and TRADD.
  In IMD signalling Dredd binds to dFADD and is autocatalytically activated to cleave
  IMD, generating a newly exposed N-terminal residue that in turn binds the E3-ligase
  DIAP2. DIAP2 adds K63-linked ubiquitin chains to IMD and Dredd, which are necessary
  for downstream signalling, ultimately leading to cleavage of Relish and induction
  of AMP genes. Mammalian TNF-R1 signalling involves assembly of two molecularly and
  spatially distinct complexes: complex I and II. The initial membrane-bound complex
  I consists of TRADD, RIP1 and TRAF2 and rapidly transduces inflammatory signals
  via NF-κB, similar to the Drosophila IMD pathway. In a second step, TRADD, RIP1
  and TRAF2 dissociate from the TNF-R1 and, together with FADD and caspase-8, form
  complex II. In the absence of NF-κB activity from complex I, complex II can initiate
  caspase-8 activation and cell death.'
