caption: Epithelial PGR regulates multiple signaling pathways in the endometrium and
  transuduce signals via uterine epithelial-stormal inteactions. Epithelial PGR regualtes
  transcription of Ihh, which acts on stromal cells via its receptors, PTCH1 and PTCH2,
  as well as its downstream mediator COUP-TFII and stromal PGR. This pathway primes
  stromal cells for decidualization via BMP2 and WNT4. Induction of BMP2 and WNT4
  also requires EGFR siganling. In addition, HAND2 expression is promoted directly
  by stromal PGR and COUP-TFII. HAND2 then inhibits prodution of FGF ligands, thereby
  stop proliferative signaling to the uterine epithelial cells. PGR, progesterone
  receptor; GATA2, GATA binding protein 2; IHH, indian hedgehog; PTCH1, patched 1;
  PTCH2, patched 2; COUP-TFII, chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor II;
  BMP2, bone morphogen protein 2; WNT4, Wnt family member 4; EGFR, epidermal growth
  factor receptor; HAND2, heart- and neural crest derivative-expressed protein 2;
  FGF, fibroblast growth factor.
