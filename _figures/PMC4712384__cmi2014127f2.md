caption: HCV replication cycle. As shown, the HCV LVP is coated with ApoB and ApoE,
  which are marked by light green and light blue stripes, respectively, on its surface.
  The LVP attaches to SRB1 and to CD81 and further interacts with the tight junction
  protein claudin-1 and with occludin. Virus entry into cell proceeds through receptor-mediated
  endocytosis at the cell surface. Subsequent to internalization, the viral envelope
  fuses with the endosomal membrane under acidic pH, and the viral genome is uncoated
  and released into the cytoplasm. To dissect these two events, internalization and
  fusion are conventionally depicted as two seemingly separate steps in the cytoplasm.
  Viral RNA is translated at the ER to produce the polyprotein, which is subsequently
  processed into mature structural and non-structural proteins. Viral non-structural
  proteins, in conjunction with host factors, form a membranous web where viral RNA
  replication occurs. HCV particle assembly most likely initiates near the ER and
  LD where core protein and viral RNA accumulate. Finally, HCV particles are secreted
  into the extracellular milieu via the secretory pathway. Viral replication and assembly
  occur in the proximity of LDs and in lipid raft microdomains, which are shown in
  the inserted dashed rectangle. Apo, apolipoprotein; CD81, cluster of differentiation
  81; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HCV, hepatitis C virus; LD, lipid droplet; LVP, lipoviral
  particle.
