caption: Schematic representation of PPARs-dependent oncosuppressive metabolic pathways
  highlighted in this review. The representation concerns the metabolic mechanisms
  that are activated/inhibited in tumor cells under the transcriptional control of
  PPARs. These hypotheses of molecular mechanisms are based on evidences obtained
  by different cancer types. For each PPAR isotype, the specific activated/inhibited
  metabolic pathways are reported together with some PPAR target genes. (A) Aerobic
  glycolysis is inhibited by the PPARα’s transcriptional repression of glucose transporter
  1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase II (HKII) genes. Meanwhile, the complex between the voltage-dependent
  anion channel (VDAC) complex and HKII is destroyed by PPARα activity, thus adversely
  affecting glycolysis and increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In addition,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is upregulated by PPARα to promote OXPHOS. Impairment
  in fatty acid synthesis by the downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and impairment
  of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway are due to effects adversely exerted by PPARα on
  specific target genes. Conversely, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) is upregulated
  by PPARα; this condition promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Despite the reduced
  activity of fatty acid synthesis, FAO depletes insufficient lipid reserves and impairs
  cancer cells for life. (B) PPARγ downregulates the c-Myc/Wnt/β-catenin axis and
  stimulates β-catenin proteasome degradation. Further downregulation of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and upregulation of pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M1 by
  PPARγ promotes OXPHOS and impairs aerobic glycolysis. Fatty acid synthesis, amino
  acid uptake, and anaplerosis are adversely affected by PPARγ activity in concert
  with increased levels of FAO. High FAO levels are related to the upregulation of
  PDK4 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Moreover, PPARγ activity negatively
  affects ATP binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) and prevents chemoresistance; this is associated
  with the high sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS, whose levels are increased through
  FAO and OXPHOS metabolic pathways. In addition, there is glutathione (GSH) downregulation,
  while hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is able to inhibit PPARγ activity. (C)
  In the absence of ligands, PPARβ/δ acts as a repressor, which is probably due to
  the strong interaction between PPARβ/δ/RXR heterodimer and a co-repressor. However,
  the repressor complex is able to downregulate the genes involved in FAO, this condition
  is abolished in the presence of exogenous or endogenous PPARβ/δ ligands. The thin
  black continuous lines with arrows indicate upregulation events. The thick black
  continuous lines with arrows indicate the stimulation of a metabolic pathway. The
  thin black dashed lines with arrows indicate a reduction activity of metabolic pathways.
  The thin blue continuous lines with bars indicate inhibition events. The thin blue
  dashed lines with bars indicate a reduction of the inhibition of the metabolic pathway.
  The HIF-1-mediated downregulation of PPARs is represented by a grey dash dotted
  line with a bar at the end, while the FABP-mediated ligand-dependent activation
  of PPARs is represented by a gold dash dotted line with an arrow at the end.
