caption: PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in microglia. PI3K is comprised of a p85 regulatory
  subunit that directs its location and a p110 catalytic subunit that phosphorylates
  phospholipids to mediate downstream signaling. In response to activation signals,
  PI3K is recruited to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in cell surface receptors
  via the SH2 domain in p85, whereupon it acts on the membrane phospholipid, PI(4,5)P2,
  generating the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4,5)P3 recruits protein kinase
  B (AKT) to the membrane resulting in its activation, where it can phosphorylate
  numerous downstream substrates, leading to changes in gene transcription and biological
  responses. Upon receiving an inhibitory signal, the lipid phosphatase SHIP-1 is
  recruited to the membrane, where it converts PI(3,4,5)P3 into phosphatidylinositol
  3,4 bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) to downmodulate signaling. PTEN is a direct antagonist
  of PI3K, converting PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2. SFK Src family tyrosine kinase; Lyn Lck/yes-related
  novel tyrosine kinase; PH Pleckstrin homology domain
