caption: Molecular mechanisms of TLR4 in osteoporosis development. Multifactorial
  proteins and signaling cascades-mediated by TLR4 are involved in osteoporosis development.
  Various molecules directly or indirectly involve TLR4-mediated bone remodeling process
  via cross-talking interaction. For example, E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4A promotes osteoclast
  differentiation by upregulating ZEB1 to repress miR-340-5p expression, causing HMGB1
  upregulation and the TLR4 activation. Circ_0134944/miR-630 and miR-137/KDM4A elevate
  the TLR4 expression, together contribute to the pathophysiologic mechanism of osteoporosis.
  TLR4 induces osteoblast dysfunction by inhibiting the expression of RUNX2 and activating
  the S100B/ERK signaling pathway. TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling induces the production
  of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. TLR4, Toll-like
