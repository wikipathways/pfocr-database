caption: Two different views of transport. (A) Original model of phosphate exchange
  proposed by Peter Mitchell in the 1950s (). The transporter (dark hash marks) alternates
  between outward- and inward-facing transitions with phosphate being delivered along
  the vertical transition on the right and the protein resetting along the left vertical
  transition. The reaction can only occur in a single file manner along this linear,
  closed pathway. In this drawing, the transporter creates an internal bond with itself
  (white rectangle) to satisfy the lack of the bound substrate, but the possibility
  of an effluxed substrate on the resetting step is mentioned in the paper making
  the model valid as an antiporter. (B) Free-exchange model of EmrE transport proposed
  by the Henzler-Wildman laboratory. EmrE is suggested to adopt many more states than
  the exchanger in A, and these states are more highly connected. Hence, there is
  not just one linear reaction path through this state space, but instead, many reaction
  cycles exist with different stoichiometries and varying amounts of “leak.” The red
  circle is a proton, and the green hexagon is a drug molecule. EmrE is denoted by
  Eext (external facing) or Eint (internal facing). The symbols E, ED, EHD, EH, and
  EHH denote EmrE only, drug bound, drug bound with a single proton, and single- and
  double-bound proton states, respectively.
