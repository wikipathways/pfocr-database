caption: Pattern diagram of immune cell response process triggered by PRR signal triggered
  by HSV-1 infection. Inducing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines or IFN through
  the TLR signaling pathway (left, middle) or RLR signaling pathway (right). In the
  TLR signaling pathway, TLR2 recognizes signals induced by HSV-1 envelope proteins,
  such as gB or gD. The signal is transmitted to the cytoplasm, where MyD88 binds
  to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR2, leading to the activation of transcription factors
  like NF-κB. This activation promotes the translocation of P50/P65 into the nucleus
  and increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines and IFN-1. Additionally,
  TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 signaling are activated by dsRNA, ssRNA, or CpG DNA, respectively,
  in endosomes. These signals activate IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-κB, ultimately resulting
  in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-1, IFN-III, and interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs). In the RLR signaling pathway, RIG-I and MDA5, which contain N-terminal
  caspase activation and recruitment domains, recruit and activate the mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein to mediate signal transduction. The activated
  MAVS protein further activates downstream signaling, promoting the expression of
  inflammatory cytokines and IFN. Both pathways contribute to the immune response
  against HSV-1 infection by triggering the production of inflammatory cytokines and
  interferons, which play crucial roles in controlling viral replication and coordinating
  innate and adaptive immune responses
