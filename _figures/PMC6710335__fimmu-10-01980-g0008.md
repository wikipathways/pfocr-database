caption: The working model of Tpl2 in protecting against fulminant hepatitis. During
  the pathogenesis of P. acnes/LPS-induced FH, high levels of IL-25 in the liver microenvironment
  activated the signaling pathway mediated by IL-17RA/IL-17RB heterodimer receptor
  in hepatocytes, which were induced the expression of Cxcl1/2 on a Tpl2-dependent
  manner. Increased CXCL1/2 production promoted the liver recruitment of the immunosuppressive
  MDSC, which further impaired the proliferation of liver-infiltrated pathogenic CD4+
  T cells, and finally suppressed the inflammation-induced acute liver injury.
