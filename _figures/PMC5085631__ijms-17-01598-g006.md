caption: 'The model showing how decreased expression of SRSF2 affects apoptotic pathways
  in renal cancer cells. The changes introduced by the depletion of SRSF2 are shown
  with the following colours: green, decreased expression; and red, increased expression.
  The arrows indicate activation, bar-headed lines indicate inhibition. Grey dotted
  arrow indicates release of cytochrome c. Black dotted arrows indicate final effect
  on apoptosis. In the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (left side of the drawing) depletion
  of SRSF2 results in downregulated expression of genes coding for death receptors
  (TNFRSF1B and TNFRSF9) and CRADD that recruits caspase-2 to complex with death receptors.
  Additionally, the expression of TRAIL-β, a non-active splice variant of a ligand
  of the TNFRSF10 receptor [] is decreased. Overexpressed caspase-8L interferes with
  the binding of caspase-8a to FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein)
  and counteracts its activation []. Likewise, caspase-8 activation is probably hindered
  by overexpression of the new splice variant of CFLAR, coding for Usurpin β []. In
  the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (right side of the drawing) BAX and BAK oligomerize,
  trigger permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome
  c. The proapototic activity of BAX and BAK is counteracted by antiapoptotic proteins
  of BCL-2 family (MCL-1L, BCL-XL, BCL-2, BCL2L2, and BCL2A1) []. In cells with lowered
  expression of SRSF2, the concurrent decrease of antiapoptotic BCL2A1 and BCL2L2
  might be overcome by diminished expression of proapoptotic BimS (the most powerful
  pro-apoptotic isoform of BIM variants) that inhibits the activity of antiapoptotic
  BCL2 proteins and directly activates BAX [,,]. A decrease of BimS may, thus, lead
  to, on one hand, diminished activation of BAX, and on the other hand, to inefficient
  inhibition of BCL-2 proteins, allowing them to inhibit BAX and BAK. A similar effect
  is exerted by decreased expression of proapoptotic MCL-1S that acts as an inhibitor
  of antiapoptotic MCL-1L []. The antiapoptotic effect of SRSF2 depletion is possibly
  executed by diminished activity of caspase-9, resulting from: (1) decreased expression
  of caspase-9a; (2) increased expression of caspase-9b that inhibits Apaf-1-mediated
  activation of caspase-9a [,]; (3) decreased expression of Smac3 which inactivates
  XIAP that acts as caspases’ inhibitor; and (4) decreased expression of proapoptotic
  Surv-2B that acts as an activator of caspase-9 []. Notably, the expression of antiapoptotic
  survivin is not changed by SRSF2 silencing. Finally, decreased expression of SRSF2
  results in upregulation of TP53, which inhibits apoptosis in renal cancer cells
  [,,,,].'
