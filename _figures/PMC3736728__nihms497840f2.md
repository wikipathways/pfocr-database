caption: After passage through intestine to the liver, dietary folate is metabolized
  to dihydrofolate (DHF) and then tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is substrate for production
  of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF). This compound then interacts either
  with thymidine synthetase (TS) for regulation of nucleotide metabolism in DNA synthesis,
  or with methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MHFR), for production of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTHF), which is the initial methyl donor for methionine metabolism. Homocysteine
  and 5-MTHF are substrates for vitamin B12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) for
  production of methionine and THF. In the transmethylation cycle, methionine is substrate
  for methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
  which is the principal methyl donor for all histone and DNA methyltransferases (MTsS-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) is the both product and inhibitor of all MT reactions, and is subsequently
  metabolized to homocysteine by the bidirectional enzyme SAH hydrolase (SAHH). Through
  the transsulfuration pathway, homocysteine is metabolized by vitamin B6 regulated
  pathways, cystathionine beta synthase (CβS) and cystathionase to cysteine and subsequently
  to the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). In addition to its role as principal methyl
  donor, SAM regulates both folate metabolism as an inhibitor of MTHFR and transsulfuration
  of homocysteine as a facilitator of CβS.
