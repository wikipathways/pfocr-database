caption: Cellular pathways involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress response activation. At resting state, the UPR stress sensors,
  protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE-1α)
  and activating transcription factor (ATF-6) are kept in place by the chaperone immunoglobulin
  heavy chain binding protein (BiP). During metabolic stress conditions, such as in
  obesity and diabetes, accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER lumen
  leads to dissociation of BiP from UPR stress sensors to fix the unfolded/misfolded
  proteins inside the ER, while the stress sensors of UPR become available to activate
  downstream signaling. (i) PERK autophophorylates and dimerizes to become active
  and activates eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-2α) through phosphorylation. Active
  eIF-2α attenuates general translation of proteins but selectively enhances the translation
  of ATF-4, which is then moved to the nucleus to promote transcription of genes involved
  in amino acid synthesis and apoptosis. ATF-4 is also involved in the negative feedback
  of PERK signaling by enhancing transcription of growth arrest and DNA damage inducible
  protein (GADD34) that activates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) leading to PERK dephosphorylation
  and hence inactivation; (ii) IRE-1α autophosphorylates and dimerizes to be activated,
  then it splices X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA to the active XBP-1s. XBP-1s
  then translocates into the nucleus; (iii) ATF-6 is cleaved by proteases in the Golgi
  apparatus to become active. Both XBP-1s and cleaved ATF-6 move to the nucleus and
  facilitate the transcription of genes involved in protein folding and degradation
  (ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery). c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) proinflammatory
  and proapoptotic pathway is closely related to IRE-1α and can be activated after
  prolonged ER stress response [,].
