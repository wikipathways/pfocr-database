caption: Molecular pathways that promote lymphangiogenesis in liver cancers. Under
  hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1⍺ (HIF1⍺) increases the transcription of lymphangiogenic
  factors, such as angiopoietin-1/2 (ANG1/2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C/D,
  platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B, and PDGF-D. PDGF-D secreted from hepatic
  cancer cells bind to PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-B expressed on the surface of cancer-associated
  fibroblast (CAFs), which, in turn, leads to increased transcription of VEGF-C from
  CAFs. The VEGF-C secreted from CAFs binds to VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-3 on lymphatic
  endothelial cells (LECs) and induces lymphangiogenesis. In the background of preexisting
  liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, NF-κB pathway is stimulated in LECs, which increases
  transcription of Prospero homeobox 1 protein (PROX1) and VEGFR-3, thus up-regulating
  LEC proliferation and lymphangiogenesis. All these processes lead to a high degree
  of lymphangiogenesis in the hepatic tumor microenvironment, ultimately aggravating
  lymph node metastasis. Generated with BioRender.com (Toronto, ON, Canada).
