caption: Predicted targets of host miRNA responsive to HSV-1 infection. (A) Targets
  of mice miRNAs miR-184-3p, let7d-5p, and miR-329 in toll-like receptor pathway.
  (B) Targets of the said miRNAs in anti-viral interferon pathway. All these targets
  were identified through IPA's miRNA Target Filter Analysis. These potential mRNA
  targets are moderately predicted, or highly predicted or experimentally validated.
  Target genes are highlighted in various colors specific to miRNA
