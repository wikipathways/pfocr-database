caption: 'DHEA is synthesized from pregnenolone through the Δ5pathway (red arrows)
  thanks the activity of the enzyme CYP17A1. DHEA synthesis occurs in two steps, which
  are both mediated by CYP17A1, which compete for pregnenolone with HSD3B2, the initiator
  of the Δ4pathway necessary for mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production.
  DHEA can be interconverted into DHEAS and metabolized in several extra-adrenal and
  extra-gonadal tissues to give rise to biologically active metabolites such as androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol
  and oxygenated metabolites (in gray). The ability of a steroidogenic tissue to synthesize
  DHEA depends on the expression and activity of CYP17A, its interaction with CYB5,
  and the expression of HSD3B2, which competes with CYP17A for substrates. This figure
  describes the general pathways involved in DHEA synthesis and metabolism, and pose
  some emphasis on the main enzymes involved. CYP11A1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane
  enzyme, also known as cytochrome P450scc (side chain cleavage), which converts cholesterol
  to pregnenolone. CYP17A, also known as cytochrome P450c17, is the key enzyme of
  the Δ5pathway that catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to DHEA in two steps:
  (a) 17α-hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone; (b) 17,20-lyase reactions
  required to break the C17–C20 bond of 17-OH-pregnenolone and 17-OH-progesterone
  and produce C19-androgens (i.e., DHEA and androstenedione). CYB5A, also known as
  cytochrome b5, is an allosteric enhancer of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A.
  HSD3B2, also known as 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, Δ4/Δ5-isomerase (3βHSD) type
  2, is the key enzyme of the Δ4pathway, which catalyzes the oxidation of the hydroxyl
  group on carbon 3 of steroids to a keto group and, simultaneously, the isomerization
  of the double bond from the B ring (Δ5 steroids) to the A ring (Δ4 steroids). 17βHSD
  (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) converts androstenedione to testosterone, and
  DHEA to androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol. CYP19A1, also known as cytochrome P450aro (aromatase),
  converts testosterone to 17β-estraidiol and androstenedione to estrone. SULT2A1
  (DHEA sulfotransferase) converts DHEA in DHEAS. STS (steroid sulfatase) is the primary
  enzyme involved in steroid desulfation. CYP7B is the main responsible for the generation
  of 7α-hydroxylated steroids in diverse extra-hepatic tissues.'
