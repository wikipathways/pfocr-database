caption: Schematic summary of findings. Leucine supplementation promotes hepatic cell
  glucose uptake by upregulating solute carrier family member2 (SLC2A2) expression
  via myostatin (MSTN). MSTN activity leads to the activation of AMP- activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, activation of MSTN
  leads to overexpression of genes involved in glucose uptake, which is further responsible
  for triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, leucine supplementation alters the expression
  of several small RNA species including miR-143, miR-335 and miR-92b*, which target
  main gene regulators of these effects.
