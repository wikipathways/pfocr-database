caption: Bile acid regulation of the autophagy-lysosome axis. Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent
  cellular degradation pathway that plays a key role in cellular nutrient homeostasis,
  organelle homeostasis and lipid homeostasis. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a
  nutrient and stress-sensing transcriptional factor that is activated in response
  to nutrient starvation and lysosome stress. In turn, TFEB induced genes that promote
  autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. Postprandial circulating bile acids and fibroblast
  growth factor 15 or 19 (FGF15/19) increase in response to food intake. Bile acids
  activated hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) represses autophagy genes. In addition,
  FGF15/19 signalling inhibits TFEB nuclear translocation via activating intracellular
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) signalling. As a result, bile acids contribute to the postprandial repression
  of the hepatic autophagy-lysosome axis. In cholestasis, bile acid accumulation may
  contribute to impaired hepatic autophagy-lysosome axis, which in turn exacerbates
  cellular dysfunction and injury in hepatocytes
