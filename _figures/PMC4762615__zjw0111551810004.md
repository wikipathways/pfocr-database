caption: 'Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. (A) Simplified
  scheme of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum showing genes/proteins
  differentially expressed/represented and biological processes affected in response
  to A. phagocytophilum infection of tick cells. Differences refer to infected versus

  Bap31, B-cell receptor-associated protein; sHSF, heat shock protein; Hsp70, heat
  shock protein 70; Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; DUB, ataxin. (B) Some of the genes
  differentially expressed in response to A. phagocytophilum infection of tick cells
  directly correlated with the metabolomics results for certain amino acids. Gene
