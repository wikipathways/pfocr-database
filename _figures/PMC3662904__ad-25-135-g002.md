caption: 'Autocrine and paracrine effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β on
  melanoma cells and tumor microenvironment. Melanoma cells express and secrete high
  levels of TGF-β that are self-perpetuating, notably through enhanced protease activation
  of latent TGF-β and recruitment of TGF-β-secreting cells such as stromal fibroblasts.
  TGF-β, which exerts cytostatic effects on early stage tumor cells, switches to tumor
  promoter in advanced melanoma where it promotes invasion, mesenchymal transition
  and dissemination of tumor cells. TGF-β secretion by melanoma cells also affects
  the tumor microenvironment. TGF-β stimulates stromal fibroblasts and endothelial
  cells to promote tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis, and inhibits the proliferation
  and activation of key immune cells, thus allowing melanoma cells to evade from immunosuppressive
  actions. ECM: extracellular matrix, EndMT: endothelial to mesenchymal transition,
  NK: natural killer.'
