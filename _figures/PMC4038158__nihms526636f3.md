caption: Signaling pathway initiated by Edn1-induced Ednra signaling. A. A schematized
  depiction of the first pharyngeal arch, with dorsal (proximal), intermediate and
  ventral (distal) aspects of the arch labeled on the left. Edn1 from the overlying
  ectoderm binds to the Ednra on the underlying neural crest-derived mesenchyme, initiating
  a signaling cascade that includes both positive and negative components. Part of
  this pathway includes additional activation potential for Bmp signaling in the ventral
  arch and repression of this activity by Grem2, found in the dorsal arch. Each of
  the listed signaling or transcription factors is color coded to depict the species
  from which genetic evidence was obtained to support its function. B. The putative
  intracellular signaling pathway induced by Ednra. PLCB4 is activated downstream
  of Gnaq/Gna11 to induce gene expression. Also shown is GNAI3, though its actual
  function downstream of EDNRA is not clear.
