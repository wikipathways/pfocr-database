caption: Agents that could overcome drug resistance and increase the sensitivity of
  chemotherapy drugs by promoting cancer cell apoptosis. Cisplatin, mitomycin, and
  paclitaxel are three kinds of drugs commonly used clinically. Gene intervention
  is a pivotal technology used for cancer research. Regulation of crucial oncogene's
  expression is reported to be involved in apoptotic process of cancer cells and thus
  enhance the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs. Besides, inhibitors of key pathway
  molecules like Notch1 or PI3K are also reported to promote the anticancer effect
  of cervical cancer chemotherapy drugs. Many agents like substances derived from
  plants and protease inhibitors or proton pump inhibitor are found to possess a remarkable
  sensitization effect on cervical cancer cells to paclitaxel, cisplatin, or other
  conventional drugs by affecting the apoptotic process of cancer cells.
