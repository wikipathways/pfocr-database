caption: 'A, General schematic of the classical view of cell surface receptor-mediated
  intracellular signaling. Following the binding of an agonist to its cell surface
  receptor, the receptor activates several cytoplasmic signaling cascades (A, B, C,
  and X, Y, Z, respectively) that lead to the activation of transcription factors
  (TF1 and TF2, respectively), which in turn stimulate the transcription of target
  gene(s) in the nucleus. B, Schematic representation of the GnRH receptor intracellular
  signaling network. This simplified view illustrates the activation of multiple intracellular
  signaling cascades by the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) in response to GnRH stimulus, ultimately
  resulting in the induction of gonadotropin subunit gene expression in the nucleus
  via various transcription factors, as shown. The GnRHR is coupled to Gαq and Gαs
  proteins, which subsequently activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) and adenylate cyclase
  (AC), respectively. Stimulation of AC leads to protein kinase A (PKA) activation,
  which notably phosphorylates cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). Stimulation
  of PLCβ leads to activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
  (CaMKII)-dependent pathway and of protein kinase C (PKC), which itself mediates
  the activation of various mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. Caln, calcineurin;
