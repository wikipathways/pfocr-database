caption: Changes in the methylation state of parentally imprinted genes lead to attenuation
  of GH/INS/IGF signaling in VSELs. VSELs are deposited in adult tissues as a backup
  population for tissue-committed stem cells (TCSCs). Due to erasure of paternal imprinting
  at the Igf2-H19 locus, VSELs do not express endogenous IGF-2 and, through the activity
  of H19 gene-derived miRNA675, downregulate expression of the IGF-1 and INS receptors,
  which decreases their sensitivity to the circulating IGF-1, INS and IGF-2 activating
  GH/INS/IGF signaling axis. At the same time, due to hypermethylation of the DMR
  at the Igf2R locus by upregulating expression of the non-signaling IGF-2 receptor
  (which serves as molecular bin for IGF-2), these cells additionally attenuate responsiveness
  to circulating IGF-2. During aging, gradual hypermethylation at the Igf2-H19 locus
  is observed, which leads to an increase in expression of autocrine IGF-2 and a decrease
  in H19-expressed miR675, which leads to an increase in expression of the IGF-1 and
  INS receptors. This results in age-related increased sensitivity to GH/INS/IGF signaling
  and age-mediated VSEL depletion. As a consequence, there is a decrease in VSEL-generated
  TCSCs, which impairs tissue and organ rejuvenation. Moreover, VSELs deposited in
  adult tissues may, over time, become more quickly depleted by chronically elevated
  circulating levels of IGF-1 and INS, which engage the IGF1R and INSR expressed by
  these cells. This mechanism may contribute to accelerated aging observed in situations
  with high circulating levels of IGF-1 and INS (e.g., high calorie uptake)
