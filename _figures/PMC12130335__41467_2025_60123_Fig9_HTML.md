caption: 'MIRI-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates the RIG-I signaling
  cascade - at least in part - by RNA generated during myocardial death, in which
  MAVS plays the role of a hub to regulate downstream signaling: MAVS recruits and
  interacts with transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and tumor
  necrosis factor-associated factor family 6 (TRAF6), and participates in the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/JNK signaling pathway, which triggers apoptosis-related pathways
  that induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis, immune cell infiltration and adverse ventricular
  remodeling such as increased fibrosis and impaired angiogenesis in vivo. MAVS deficiency
  prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reduces immune cell infiltration and fibrosis,
  while promoting angiogenesis. JNK inhibition protects against MIRI. The graphics
