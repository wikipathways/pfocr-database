caption: Role of TK signaling in food odor sensing in the antennal lobe of Drosophila.
  (A) TK peptides are expressed in local neurons (LN) of the antennal lobe and innervate
  most glomeruli. Two glomeruli are shown here (DM1 and DM5). Of these DM1 is mediating
  food odor attraction (Or42b) and DM5 food odor aversion (Or85b). (B) Image of TK
  immunoreactive LNs (green) in the clusters DC1 and DC2 innervation antennal lobe
  (AL). (C) Role of TK signaling in the DM5 glomerulus, which relays aversive odor
  signals from olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) that express odorant receptors Or85b
  to DM5 projection neurons (PN) which in turn signal to higher order neurons that
  control food search. In the fed fly the circulating level of insulin-like peptide
  (DILP) is high, which suppresses expression (transcription) of the TK receptor DTKR.
  When DTKR signaling is low there is no suppression of Ca2+ channel activity and
  therefore release of acetylcholine (ACh) is strong when the OSN is activated and
  as a consequence the DM5 PN relays strong aversive signals and food search is reduced.
  (D) In the hungry fly the DILP level is low, DTKR expression is high and therefore
  TK signaling activates DTKR and the OSN releases less ACh resulting in suppressed
  activation of the aversive DM5 PN and therefore increase food search. (E) A scheme
  showing the combined signaling from the DM1 and DM2 signaling pathways that increase
  food search in hungry flies with low circulating insulin. In hungry flies the aversive
  DM5 odor pathway is inactivated resulting in increased food search (as detailed
  in ). In the DM1 pathway (food odor attraction) signaling with short neuropeptide
  F (sNPF) and its receptor sNPFR is increased in hungry flies due to low insulin
  and increased expression of the sNPFR. This leads to presynaptic potentiation of
  the ACh signaling and increased activation of DM1 PNs, resulting in increased food
  search. The panels (A,C–E) were redrawn from figures in  and .
