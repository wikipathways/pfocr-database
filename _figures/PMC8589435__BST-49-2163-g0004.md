caption: Non-canonical Wnt (eg Wnt 5a) bridges frizzled receptors with Ror to activate
  Rho kinase that prevents Lats1/2 inhibition of Yap1 resulting in the suppression
  of β-catenin nuclear translocation and canonical Wnt pathway inhibition. Hippo signalling
  is modulated by G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
  and by cell-cell adhesion. When Hippo signalling is active, cytosolic Yap1 is also
  high and inhibits β-catenin translocation. When Hippo signalling is supressed, Yap1
  can translocate to the nucleus and binds to TEAD transcription factors which results
  in the production of non-canonical Wnt 5a, Bmp4 and Dkk1 and also stimulates the
  nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thus activating canonical Wnt signalling. Nuclear
  Yap1 also stimulates the activation of Notch signalling by promoting the cleavage
  of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) which can bind the CSL transcription factor
  in the nucleus resulting in production of Hes1. Hes1 represses Atoh1 and modulates
  whether cells become secretory or absorptive populations.

  description: Non-canonical Wnt (eg Wnt 5a) bridges frizzled receptors with Ror to
    activate Rho kinase that prevents Lats1/2 inhibition of Yap1 resulting in the
    suppression of β-catenin nuclear translocation and canonical Wnt pathway inhibition.
    Hippo signalling is modulated by G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), receptor
    tyrosine kinases (RTK) and by cell-cell adhesion. When Hippo signalling is active,
    cytosolic Yap1 is also high and inhibits β-catenin translocation. When Hippo signalling
    is supressed, Yap1 can translocate to the nucleus and binds to TEAD transcription
    factors which results in the production of non-canonical Wnt 5a, Bmp4 and Dkk1
    and also stimulates the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thus activating canonical
    Wnt signalling. Nuclear Yap1 also stimulates the activation of Notch signalling
    by promoting the cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) which can bind
    the CSL transcription factor in the nucleus resulting in production of Hes1. Hes1
    represses Atoh1 and modulates whether cells become secretory or absorptive populations.
