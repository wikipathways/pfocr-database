caption: Role of the FGF/FGFR signalling pathway in the development and progression
  of pancreatic cancer. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling pathway regulates
  numerous cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
  migration, invasion and metastasis. FGF/FGFR could be regulated by Notch, N‐CAM
  and miRNAs. FGF/FGFR exhibits its physiological functions via regulation of its
  downstream targets. The chemical inhibitors of FGF/FGFR, antibodies and natural
  agents could block FGF signalling pathway. Thus, targeting FGF/FGFR could be an
  effective approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients
