caption: The lifecycle of hepatitis B virus (HBV) focusing on viral genome replication.
  HBV polymerase has several crucial roles in viral replication. Polymerase inhibitors
  block the reverse transcription pathway, namely RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis;
  they also block DNA-dependent plus-strand DNA synthesis, thereby suppressing the
  recycling step for cccDNA amplification.
