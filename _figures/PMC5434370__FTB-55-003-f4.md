caption: 'Schematic presentation of: a) the gene cluster encoding for OTC biosynthesis
  from S. rimosus. The enzymatic activity of each putative gene is marked with different
  symbols and corresponds to the legend. The function of each gene product in the
  OTC gene cluster (in a) corresponds to the proposed OTC biosynthetic pathway (in
  b); and b) the biosynthetic pathway of oxytetracycline (OTC) and chlortetracycline
  (CTC), based on the biosynthetic gene clusters of OTC and CTC from S. rimosus and
  S. aureofaciens, respectively. The position on the tetracycline backbone of each
  proposed tetracycline precursor modified by the corresponding enzyme from the OTC
  (CTC) enzyme complex at each proposed biosynthetic step is shadowed. For colour
