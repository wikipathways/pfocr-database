caption: 'Through a putative GPCR (mER), E2 (and STX) activates a PLCβ-PKCδ-AC-PKA
  pathway in POMC neurons that attenuates the coupling of μ-opioid and GABAB receptors
  to GIRK channels (heterologous desensitization) and triggers the release of Ca2+
  from intracellular stores. This novel pathway also activates PKA-pCREB mediated
  transcription and in tandem with ERE-mediated transcription will alter the mRNA
  expression of relevant genes (channels and signaling molecules, etc.). Leptin binds
  to LRb to activate PI3 kinase and PLCγ1 to augment TRPC-channel currents and POMC
  neuronal excitability. Leptin will also activate JAK2-STAT3 transcriptional pathways.
  Note: The guinea pig, similar to the primate, has all of the key cellular elements
  in the mediobasal hypothalamus for controlling reproduction and energy homeostasis.'
