caption: 'Inflammation linked to elevated insulin concentrations via portal circulation
  is one hypothesis that may help explain why patients with diabetes likely than others
  to develop extreme types of coronavirus disease 2019 diabetic patients[,]. The angiotensin
  converting enzyme (ACE) Protein is used by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 to enter the host. The pathogenesis of diabetes is linked to hyperactivity
  of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway caused by increased reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). In order to maintain insulin secretion, ACE2 can modulate blood flow
  and morphology in the islets. A higher level of circulating insulin changes the
  balance from vasodilator to vasoconstrictor effects, disrupting cardiovascular homeostasis
  and increasing the risk of thromboembolism and multiple organ failure. COVID-19:
