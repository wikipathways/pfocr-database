caption: Association network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the MAPK
  pathway in the organ of Corti in Fkbp5−/− mice following acoustic overexposure (AO).
  The network of DEGs in the MAPK pathway in Fkbp5−/− mice following AO as compared
  to wild-type mice following AO. The major proinflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL1B,
  are recognized as key regulators in the protein-protein interaction network of MAPK
  signaling in Fkbp5−/− mice following AO. The STRING database (https://string-db.org)
  computed the graphical analysis of the mutual relationships of DEGs as evidenced
  by experimentally verified interactions, co-expressions, and co-citations in curated
  databases and PubMed abstracts. The figure downloaded from STRING is freely available
