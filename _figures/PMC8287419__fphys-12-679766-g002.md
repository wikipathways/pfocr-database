caption: Toll receptors can regulate cell survival, death, quiescence, or proliferation
  via alternative signaling pathways. Toll receptors share common functions, but they
  can also each elicit distinct cellular outcomes. This is a summary of data evidence
  on signaling by Toll-1, −2, −6, and −7 in the central nervous system in embryonic,
  larval, and/or pupal development and Toll-2 in the adult brain. (A) During development,
  Toll receptors can promote cell apoptosis via Wek, Sarm, and JNK, (B) but in the
  adult brain, Toll-2 receptors can also function via Wek and Yki to promote cell
  proliferation. Question marks denote how or whether Wek signals remain unknown.
  (C) Toll receptors can promote cell survival via MyD88-NFkB signaling both throughout
  development and in the adult. Moreover, adult progenitor cells are normally kept
  quiescent via MyD88. In other contexts, the activation of Toll by gram-positive
  bacteria prevents proliferation by activating the Hippo pathway, thus inhibiting
  Yki, although whether this is also the case in the brain is unknown.
