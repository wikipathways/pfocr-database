caption: 'The general mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy.Schematic diagram of the
  protective function of melatonin against diabetic neuropathy by improving oxidative
  stress and inflammatory responses. Hyperglycemia activates many metabolic pathways
  like polyol pathway, and turnover of the mitochondrial energy-production complexes,
  leading to release of reactive intermediates. High glucose condition activates also
  PKC pathway, which lead to NF-kB activation. Melatonin inhibits reactive intermediates
  and NF-kB, and activates Nrf2, and as well as up regulates proteins expression of
  antioxidant enzymes, resulting in inhibits the oxidative stress and inflammation,
  and ultimately alleviating the development of diabetic neuropathy. ETC: electron
  transport chain; PKC: protein kinase c.'
