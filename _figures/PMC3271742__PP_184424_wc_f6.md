caption: Model of the influence of the NRT2.1 gene on the SA, JA, and ABA defense
  signaling pathways. In the absence of a functional NRT2.1 gene, the plant is less
  sensitive to coronatine; therefore, the manipulation of the plant’s defensive metabolism
  by the bacterium is less efficient. In the mutant, JA- and ABA-dependent signaling
  display irregular activation, and SA-dependent responses are primed in the presence
  of the pathogen. Thus, the mutation affects the SA pathway directly and also the
  negative cross talk between the ABA and JA pathways. Only those signal transduction
  elements that are affected in nrt2 are represented. Green indicates down-regulated
  processes, and red represents up-regulated processes. Black crosses indicate the
  altered processes in the nrt2 mutant. [See online article for color version of this
  figure.]
