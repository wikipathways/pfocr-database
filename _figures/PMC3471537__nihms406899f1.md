caption: 'HER2 activation. A, receptor dimerization is required for HER2 function
  (). In the absence of a ligand, EGFR (represented in blue), HER3, and HER4 assume
  a tethered conformation. In tethered receptors the dimerization site from extracellular
  domain II is hidden by intramolecular interactions between domains II and IV. Growth
  factors alter the conformation of these receptors by binding simultaneously to two
  sites on extracellular domain domains: I and III (). HER2 (represented in purple)
  occurs in an open position and is naturally ready for dimerization. Although no
  ligand has been identified for HER2 (), the receptor may become activated by homodimerization
  (HER2/HER2 pair) or heterodimerization (represented in figure by EGFR/HER2 and HER2/HER3
  dimers). The role of HER4 in oncogenesis is less defined (HER2/HER4 dimer not represented).
  The activation of the HER2 receptor triggers a number of downstream signaling steps
  through cytoplasm and nucleus, culminating with increased cell growth, survival,
  and motility (for reviews see refs. , –). B, activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is one
  of the most studied processes involved with HER2 activation. PI3K is composed of
  an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit, stably bound to each
  other and inactive in quiescent cells. Upon activation by the TKs from HER2, p85
  binding to the receptor TKs relieves p110α catalytic unit to relocate at the plasma
  membrane. There p110α phosphorylates and converts phosphatidylinositol (,)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (,,)-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a docking
  site for pleckstrin homology (PH)-containing proteins, such as Akt and phosphatidylinositol-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1). At the membrane, Akt bound to PIP3 becomes phosphorylated at threonine
  308 and serine 473. PDK1 also contributes with Akt activation. Activated Akt activates
  mTOR and has several other intracellular effects, including interaction with transcription
  factors, metabolic pathways, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, resulting in cell proliferation,
  invasion, and survival (). PIP3 in turn is dephosphorylated back to PIP2 by PTEN.
  PTEN is therefore a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling and functions as a
  tumor suppressor. C, the RAS/Raf/MAPK signaling cascade is also triggered by HER2
  activation. Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein 2 (GRB2) is an adaptor protein
  that contains one Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain, which recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated
  sites on the activated receptor for binding. GRB2 binds to the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor Son of Sevenless (SOS) by one of its SH3 domains. When the GRB2/SOS
  complex docks to the activated receptor, SOS becomes activated and removes guanosine
  diphosphate (GDP) from inactive RAS. Free RAS can then bind guanosine-5′-triphosphate
  (GTP) and become active. RAS/GTP binds efficiently to Raf-1 (MAP3K), which becomes
  activated. Raf-1 can then activate MEK1 (MAP2K1) and MEK2 (MAP2K2), which are essential
  signaling nodes downstream RAS and Raf-1. MEK phosphorylates and activates the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. Activation of ERK results in a broad spectrum
  of effects relevant to the cell physiology, including cell cycle control, differentiation,
  and migration, as well as apoptosis and angiogenesis.'
