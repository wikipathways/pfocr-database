caption: M3G known and possible intracellular pathways resulting in hyperalgesia.
  M3G administration causes hyperalgesia in rodents. (1) M3G has low affinity for
  MOR and has been shown to induce a weak MOR Gi-dependent signaling, although it
  does not seem to stimulate β-arrestin recruitment. (2) In a MOR– /– mouse strain,
  M3G hyperalgesia is abolished. (3) M3G can bind MD-2 and has been shown to induce
  the activation of the MAPK, NF-κB and AKT pathways in TLR4 signaling studies. (4)
  M3G has been described to cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines known to
  be powerful modulators of nociception counteracting morphine-induced antinociception.
  (5) M3G-induced hyperalgesia is also abolished in a TLR4– /– mouse strain. (6) Interestingly,
  both MOR and TLR4 signaling involves the MAPK pathway. This pathway is involved
  in morphine-induced hyperalgesia as well as in proinflammatory cytokine release
  following TLR4 activation. Antagonism of the MAPK pathway components results in
  inhibition of M3G-induced hyperalgesia. MOR-TLR4 crosstalk might thus be involved
  in M3G-induced hyperalgesia. (7) An interesting alternative assumption suggests
  the existence of a yet unknown receptor that could mediated M3G effects.
