caption: The apoptotic pathways regulated by the UPR. In response to ER stress, PERK,
  and IRE1α are activated through their homodimerization and autophosphorylation.
  Activated PERK phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2α, which can selectively
  induce expression of proapoptotic transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP. CHOP induces
  expression of numerous proapoptotic factors including DR5, TRB3, CAVI, and BCL2
  family proteins. CHOP can also induce expression of GADD34 and ERO1α, leading to
  apoptosis by increasing protein synthesis and oxidation in the ER of stressed cells.
  On activation of the UPR, IRE1α serves as a scaffold protein to form a complex with
  TRAF2 and ASK1, which subsequently activates the JNK-mediated apoptotic pathway.
  Furthermore, ER stress can induce BAX and BAK localization and oligomerization at
  the ER, which promotes calcium release from the ER to the cytosol. Increased cytosolic
  calcium concentration stimulates calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, which
  can result in depolarization of the inner membrane and transition of the outer membrane
  permeability pore. This causes cytochrome c release and Apaf-1-dependent activation
  of the apoptosome leading to apoptosis. In addition, ER stress may also promote
  dissociation of TRAF2 from ER membrane-resident procaspase-12, allowing caspase-12
  activation to mediate apoptosis. Mito Mitochondria, Cyt-c Cytochrome c, pCP12 Procaspase-12,
  CP12 Caspase-12, CP9 Caspase-9, CP-3 Caspase-3.
