caption: 'The mechanisms of fermented vegetables. PTS: Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
  sugar phosphotransferase system. The homotypic lactic fermentation pathway is indicated
  by the blue arrow. The heterotypic lactic fermentation pathway is indicated by the
  yellow arrow. The malate metabolic pathway is indicated by the red arrow. The citrate
  metabolic pathway is indicated by the purple arrow. The ethanol metabolic pathway
  is indicated by the green arrow.'
