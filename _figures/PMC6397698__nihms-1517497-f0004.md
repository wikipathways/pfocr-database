caption: Both TGFβ and PD-L1 are known to repress the function of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells
  in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, our data appears to suggest that TGFβ
  negatively regulates the expression of PD-L1 on the neoplastic epithelium, either
  directly (as shown) or indirectly, potentially through IFNγ as shown. Hence, pharmacologic
  ablation of TGFβ signals via the drug Galunisertib leads to the accumulation of
  PD-L1 in the cancer epithelium, failing to promote a substantial anti-tumor immune
  response. Hence, combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 antibody and a TGFβ pathway
  inhibitor is necessary to have therapeutic efficacy, and such a combination regimen
  warrants clinical consideration.
