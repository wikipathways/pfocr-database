caption: To interrogate known interactions amongst the 25 lipid metabolic process
  genes that are co-regulated in PN and NN skin and the three transcription factors
  that show enriched numbers of binding sites in the promoters of these genes, we
  utilized Genomatix BiblioSphere to build gene interaction networks. Two of the enriched
  transcription factors, PPARA and ESR, connected most (17/25) of the genes in an
  extended network.
