caption: (a) 9AAzNeuAc is a photocrosslinking analog of sialic acid. The aryl azide
  crosslinker is shown in red. Cells are cultured with 9AAzNeuAc, which enters cells
  and is activated to CMP-9AAzNeuAc by endogenous enzymes. CMP-9AAzNeuAc is transported
  into the secretory pathway where endogenous sialyltransferases transfer 9AAzNeuAc
  onto glycoproteins. Although there is currently no direct evidence, it is likely
  that 9AAzNeuAc is also transferred onto glycolipids. (b) SiaDAz is another photocrosslinking
  analog of sialic acid. The alkyl diazirine crosslinker is shown in red. Cells cultured
  with a cell-permeable precursor to SiaDAz, Ac4ManNDAz, use endogenous enzymes to
  metabolize this compound to CMP-SiaDAz. CMP-SiaDAz is transported into the secretory
  pathway where endogenous sialyltransferases transfer SiaDAz to glycoproteins and
  glycolipids. (c) GlcNDAz is a photocrosslinking analog of GlcNAc, containing an
  alkyl diazirine photocrosslinker (red). Cells are cultured with a cell-permeable
  analog of GlcNDAz-1-P, which is converted to UDP-GlcNDAz by intracellular enzymes.
  The endogenous O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) transfers GlcNDAz to serines and threonines
  of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. More detail given in .
