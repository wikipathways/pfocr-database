caption: 'AOP network for steatosis. The high level of crosstalk between the different
  receptors and associated signaling pathways complicates the use of existing high-throughput
  screening data as predictors of a steatotic outcome. This challenge was overcome
  by identifying a network topology converging into four key events (i.e., lipogenesis,
  and fatty acid uptake, efflux and oxidation) that were viewed as critical paths
  leading to steatosis. Assays measuring these points of convergence integrate the
  complex interplay of upstream events and translate them into measures that are more
  directly related to the adverse outcome. FA: fatty acid, TAG: triacylglycerol, PI3K:
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, AKT: protein kinase B, PPAR: peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor, LXR: liver X receptor, CAR: constitutive androstane receptor, PXR: pregnane
  X receptor, FXR: farnesoid X receptor, RXR: retinoid X receptor.'
