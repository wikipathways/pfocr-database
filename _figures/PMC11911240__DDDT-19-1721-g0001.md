caption: The cGAS-STING-TBK1 signaling pathway. DNA derived from dead cells, viruses,
  tumor cells, bacteria, and self-damaged DNA binds to the cytoplasmic DNA sensor
  cGAS. In the presence of ATP and GTP, cGAS produces the second messenger cGAMP,
  which then binds to STING on the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, STING undergoes
  a conformational change and translocates to the Golgi apparatus, where it associates
  and activates kinases IKK and TPK1, leading to the phosphorylation of NF-κB and
  IRF3, respectively. Phosphorylated NF-κB and IRF3 translocate to the nucleus, where
  they initiate transcription and trigger the immune response
