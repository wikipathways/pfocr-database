caption: An abridged schematic of the gliotoxin biosynthetic pathway, demonstrating
  GliG, GliK, and GliT activity. L-Phe and L-Ser are processed by GliP and GliC to
  form intermediate (1). (1) Is then doubly thiolated using 2 GSH molecules by GliG,
  to form a sulphurised intermediate (2). (2) Then undergoes bis-glutamyl elimination,
  catalyzed by GliK, to yield (3). (3) Then undergoes several more enzymatic reactions
  to yield (4). The final product, gliotoxin, is then formed from (4) by the closure
  of the disulfide bridge via GliT (; ; ).
