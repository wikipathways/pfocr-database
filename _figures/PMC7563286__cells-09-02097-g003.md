caption: 'Schematic diagram representing the analysis of simulated metabolic flux
  of (i) the cells were grown at a low temperature (22 °C) and high temperature (40
  °C), in comparison to that of the control, and (ii) the in silico overexpression
  of isocitrate dehydrogenase (iCDHy) and GlsF, in comparison to that of the control.
  The control is the simulated flux of the wild-type strain under optimal growth temperature
  at 35 °C. The central metabolic pathways, including those at the interconnection
  of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, were identified. The bar graphs illustrate the
  relative % of the affected reactions over the total reactions (100%) of each condition/mutant
  in the designated pathway. Note: Eight boxes in a row located over the reaction
  arrow represent the up and downregulated flux level compared between the treated
  and the control. The legends to up and downregulated flux (i) under the designated
  growth temperatures and (ii) of the in silico mutants are shown in the lower-left
  corner of the figure.'
