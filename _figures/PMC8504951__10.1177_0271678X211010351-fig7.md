caption: 'Graphic summary of endothelial miR-15a/16-1 in the regulation of post-stroke
  angiogenesis. In the stroke brain, endothelium-targeted deletion of the miR-15a/16-1
  cluster (EC-miR-15a/16-1 cKO) abolishes the brain endothelial miR-15a/16-1 expression,
  allowing release from its translational repression of downstream key pro-angiogenic
  factors. This release results in the upregulation of VEGFA, FGF2 and their receptors
  VEGFR2 and FGFR1. The enhanced VEGF-VEGFR2, and FGF2-FGFR1 signaling cascades trigger
  the phosphorylation of Src and its downstream mediators, such as Akt, Stat3, p38
  MAPK, p44/42 MAPK, and FAK, and promote endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis.
  AZD0530, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Src, blocks the Src phosphorylation
  and the downstream signaling pathway, obstructing the improvement in angiogenesis
  in the ischemic brains of EC-miR-15a/16-1 cKO mice. VEGFA: vascular endothelial
  growth factor; FGF2: fibroblast growth factor 2; VEGFR2: vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2; FGFR1: fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; Akt: protein kinase
  B; Stat3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; FAK: focal adhesion kinase.'
