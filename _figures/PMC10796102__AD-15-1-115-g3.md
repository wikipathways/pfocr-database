caption: Possible mechanisms of co-occurring neuroinflammatory response and brain
  edema in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets
  for hepatic encephalopathy. Decreased detoxification of the liver in patients with
  cirrhosis leads to the accumulation of NH3 and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6,
  TNF-α) in their bodies. These substances can accumulate in the brain tissue with
  blood circulation and subsequently induce hepatic encephalopathy. (A) On the one
  hand, excess NH3 in the brain is converted to Gln by GS, causing a hyperosmotic
  environment in astrocytes. On the other hand, it can increase the activity of iNOS
  by activating NF-kB pathway, which makes the level of NO elevated. This can lead
  to astrocyte swelling and eventually brain edema. Meanwhile, targeted regulation
  of AQP-4 expression levels has a dual role. Increased AQP-4 expression not only
  promotes the drainage of metabolic waste from glymphatic system, but also mediates
  the entry of water into the astrocytes thus causing brain edema. (B) Increased inflammatory
  factors can activate microglia and astrocytes. Activated microglia and astrocytes
  in turn further promote the release of inflammatory factors. Positive feedback is
  formed between the two. Exogenous injection of VEGF-C may inhibit the NF-kB signaling
  pathway by upregulating the expression of Sik-1, which in turn reduces the inflammatory
  response. At the same time, VEGF-C may also promote the clearance of metabolic wastes
  such as NH3 by inducing the proliferation of meningeal lymphatic vessels
