caption: Summary of PAX5 alterations in B-ALL. Deletion is the most common type of
  PAX5 alteration in B-ALL, but generally considered as a secondary driver event.
  Focal deletion can lead to the concatenation of PAX5 to its adjacent gene ZCCHC7,
  a genetic lesion frequently observed in Ph-like and other B-ALL subtypes. PAX5 fusions,
  iAmp (most commonly targeting exon 2 to 5 (e2-5)), and point mutations are highly
  enriched in the PAX5alt subtype (). PAX5 fusions and iAmp of e2-5 driven B-ALL harbor
  biallelic CDKN2A/B loss and RAS or JAK/STAT pathway mutations (, , ). PAX5::JAK2,
  a signature fusion of the Ph-like subtype, can act as a dual hit for B-ALL without
  cooperating lesions (). PAX5-mutation-driven cases normally have deletion of the
  remaining WT allele and total loss of CDKN2A/B. They also frequently acquire mutations
  in the RAS signaling pathway. PAX5 P80R mutation defines an independently subtype
  with a distinct GEP ().
