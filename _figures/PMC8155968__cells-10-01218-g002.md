caption: Activated oxidative stress signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis
  of ALL. Increases in oncogene-, chemical drug-, or radiation-induced ROS production
  or abnormal expression of relevant genes leads to activation of three major oxidative
  stress signaling pathways, PI3K, MEK, and JAK, thus promoting the differentiation
  and proliferation of leukemia cells. Additionally, activation of oxidative stress
  signaling pathways promotes mitochondrial ROS production through enhanced oxidative
  metabolism, which further activates the three oxidative stress signaling pathways,
  thereby forming a positive feedback signaling pathway. A series of mechanisms in
  leukemia cells prevent excessive ROS production, thus avoiding cell injury or death
  (see the text for details). This figure was drawn based on existing research data;
  its accuracy and more precise signaling mechanisms must be confirmed and supplemented
  by extensive, in-depth studies. mitoKATP, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel.
