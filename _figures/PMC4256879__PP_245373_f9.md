caption: Simplified model showing the interaction of DES1/ with the core  signaling
  pathway in guard cells.  enters in the guard cells through ATP-binding cassette
  transporters. Once in the guard cells, it binds to the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor (Rc).
  The  PYL/PYR/RCAR receptor binds the clade A PP2C inhibiting its phosphatase activity
  and, through it, releases the SnRKs protein kinases and the signaling elements downward.
  DES1 is up-regulated by , releasing , which increases endogenous  via nitrate reductase
  (NR) activity.  might regulate the binding of ABI1 to the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor
  and through the downstream response. Arrow lines indicate activation, blunt lines
  indicate inhibition, dashed red lines indicate cross talk proposed in this work
  (hypothetical), gray lines indicate already published. K+, Potassium uptake; A–,
  anion efflux; ABRE, -responsive element transcription factors.
