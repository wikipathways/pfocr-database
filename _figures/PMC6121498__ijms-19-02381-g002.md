caption: Mechanisms of the favorable effects of carbon monoxide in cardiovascular
  diseases. Carbon monoxide (CO) can exhibit inhibitory effects on the initiation
  and progression of cardiovascular disease. (1) CO could suppress the formation of
  atherosclerosis in the coronary artery and prevent the initiation of coronary artery
  obstructive disease by the inhibition of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells
  in the coronary artery. (2) Through anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties,
  CO could diminish the loss of myocyte following acute coronary syndrome. (3) The
  vasodilatory effects of CO can prevent the vicious cycle of heart failure by inhibiting
  vasoconstriction as a result of the activated renin/angiotensin system and the sympathetic
  nervous system to compensate for low cardiac output and systemic hypo-perfusion
  in heart failure. The upward pointing arrow and the downward pointing arrow mean
  activation and inhibition for each pathway, respectively.
