caption: TRAFs in TLR signaling pathways. (A) Domain organization of TRAF proteins.
  Domains shown include Ring, Zinc (Zn) finger, coiled-coil (CC; TRAF-N), and MATH
  (TRAF-C) (B) Plasma membrane TLRs, upon ligand binding, recruit various intracellular
  signaling elements including TRAF6 to activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways. TRAF1, TRAF3,
  TRAF4, and TRAF5 can negatively regulate this pathway by different means. (C) Following
  ligand binding, TLR4 translocates to the endosomal compartment and recruits TRIF
  and TRAF3 to induce the TBK1/IKKε/IRF3 axis, or TRAF6 to induce NF-κB and AP-1 via
  late phase (slower) kinetics. TLR3 and RLRs can also induce the TBK1/IKKε/IRF3 axis
  by recruiting TRAF3.
