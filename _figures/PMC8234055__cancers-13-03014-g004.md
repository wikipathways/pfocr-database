caption: 'WNT pathway disruption by DNA methylation alterations in ESCC, LSCC, OSCC
  and OPSCC. Schematic representation of the WNT pathway showing the genes involved
  and their DMR alterations in: (A) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); (B)
  laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC); (C) oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma
  (OSCC); (D) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Each rectangle represents
  a gene involved in the pathway and is divided into two halves: the left halves represent
  the DMRs annotated to promoters; and the right halves represent the DMRs annotated
  outside promoters. The colors indicate whether the region was found to be hypermethylated
  (red) or hypomethylated (blue) in each tumor relative to their respective non-tumor
  tissue. When more than one DMR was differentially methylated in a given region,
  the mean delta beta of all DMRs was represented.'
