caption: HNF6 is involved in the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism,
  and bile acid metabolism. (1) Role of HNF6 in glucose metabolism. CBP/P300 is essential
  to enhance the ability of HNF6 to respond to the transcription of glucose metabolism-related
  genes. HNF6 directly regulates the expression of glucose genes involved in glucose
  metabolism. HNF6 regulates glucose metabolism through major urinary protein (MUP).
  HNF6 regulates glucose metabolism through MUP. This regulatory pathway may serve
  as a new mechanism by which MUP acts as an intermediate molecule to indirectly regulate
  glucose. HNF6 may regulate glucose metabolism-related enzyme synthesis through HNF3.
  Small heterodimer partner (SHP), an atypical orphan nuclear receptor, is a new target
  for HNF6 to regulate glucose metabolism-related gene production. (2) Role of HNF6
  in lipid metabolism. HNF6 regulates the expression of the CYP7A1 gene and is involved
  in cholesterol metabolism. HNF6 and Rev-erbα coordinate to regulate hepatic lipid
  metabolism. MUP regulates lipid metabolism by repressing the expression of lipogenic
  genes. (3) Role of HNF6 in bile homeostasis. HNF6 controls bile acid metabolism
  through the regulation of sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein (NTCP), organic
  anion transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1), and multidrug resistance-associated protein
  2 (MRP2)
