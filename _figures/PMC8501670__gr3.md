caption: Fat synthesis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans versus human.C. elegans obtains
  fatty acids from its bacterial diet or via de novo synthesis, and the related genes
  are functionally conserved in mammals. The de novo synthesis starts by converting
  acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC/POD-2 in C. elegans), which
  is further catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS/FASN-1 in C. elegans) to form fatty
  acids with different lengths, mainly palmitic acid (C16:0). Palmitic acid can either
  be incorporated into triglyceride/phospholipids or serve as the substrate that undergoes
  desaturation and/or elongation to generate a variety of fatty acids. Compared with
  human, there are three Δ9 desaturases, FAT-5, FAT-6, and FAT-7, other desaturases,
  FAT-1 to FAT-4, elongases, ELO-1 and ELO-2, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase LET-767
  in C. elegans. Notably, C. elegans can de novo synthesize all its polyunsaturated
  fatty acids from palmitic acid, whereas mammals need to obtain linoleic acid (C18:2
  n-6) and linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) from the diet ().

  description: Fat synthesis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans versus human.C. elegans
