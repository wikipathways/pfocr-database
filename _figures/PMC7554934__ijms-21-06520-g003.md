caption: Working model of bladder dysfunction in PD. A hypothetical diagram demonstrates
  a working model of bladder dysfunction in PD. Micturition reflex is controlled by
  spinobulbospinal pathways through PAG in the midbrain and PMC in the brainstem.
  This neural circuit is under the control of higher centers, including the anterior
  cingulate cortex (ACC) and other cortex regions. (Intact) Under normal conditions,
  tonic inhibition from ACC suppresses the micturition reflex. Tonic firing (+) of
  dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) activates the dopamine
  D1 receptors expressed on GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum to induce
  tonic GABAergic inhibition (−) of the micturition reflex at the level of PAG. At
  the same time, D1 receptor stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic
  neurons, which exert an excitatory effect on micturition via adenosine A2A receptors
  (+). (Parkinson‘s disease) In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the SN are lost (lesion),
  leading to the loss of dopamine D1 receptors activation (D1 (loss of activation)),
  which results in reduced activation inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the striatum
  (GABA (loss of inhibition)). At the same time, reduced D1 receptor stimulation enhances
  the adenosinergic mechanism to stimulate adenosine A2A receptors (A2A stimulation
  (++)), leading to facilitation of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition
  reflex pathway. Administration of dopamine D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) can restore
  the GABAergic nerve activity and suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation to reduce
  bladder overactivity in PD. Furthermore, administration of adenosine A2A antagonists
  (ZM241385 or istradefylline) can suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation of the
  micturition reflex to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2
  (+)) expressed in the spinal cord enhances the micturition reflex.
