caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of indole–sulfur phytoalexins in cruciferous
  plants. Enzymes conserved between Arabidopsis and Brassica species synthesize indole
  glucosinolate from tryptophan (Trp). Following myrosinase-catalyzed activation of
  indole glucosinolate, an unknown reaction sequence generates brassinin from indole
  isothiocyanate (highlighted in yellow; formal methanethiol equivalent shown in red).
  Different Brassica crops accumulate a characteristic subset of the phytoalexins
  derived from brassinin. The names of representative phytoalexin producers are given
  in italics. Solid arrows represent known enzymatic reactions, and dashed arrows
  signify proposed biosynthetic relationships, many supported by previous isotope
  feeding studies (). *The feeding studies suggest that 1-methoxybrassenin B, sinalbin
  A, and erucalexin are derived from the 1-methoxy derivatives of brassinin and cyclobrassinin.
  †White mustard and hairy rocket belong to the genera Sinapis and Erucastrum, respectively,
  which are each closely related to Brassica.
