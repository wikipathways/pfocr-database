caption: Ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) synthesize and secrete LPA into the ascites of
  the peritoneal cavity. LPA in the ascites stimulates LPA-receptors (LPAR) in the
  resident normal fibroblasts (NF) and induces metabolic reprogramming towards aerobic
  glycolysis via HIF1α. This early priming event is followed by the completion of
  NF to cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) conversion involving LPA-mediated induction
  of other CAF-specific phenotypic changes such as the expression of α-smooth muscle
  actin (αSMA). OCC-derived LPA is also involved in the maintenance of the reprogrammed
  aerobic glycolysis in CAFs via HIF1α. Lactate and other oncometabolites generated
  through this pathway provide metabolic support to OCC, thus contributing to the
  aggressive growth and progression of ovarian cancer.
