caption: RTKs are transmembrane receptors containing extracellular, transmembrane
  and intracellular portions. The extracellular domain interfaces with the extracellular
  milieu allowing expressing cells to react and adapt to extracellular signals. Upon
  binding their cognate ligands, RTKs undergo autophosphorylation leading to downstream
  signalling []. In this way, RTKs transduce extracellular cues as signals into a
  cell. EGF signalling is a prototypical example of altered RTK signalling in GB.
  Activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation of c-terminal residue tyrosines,
  facilitating the docking of Src homology (SH) domain-containing proteins and activation
  of several pathways, including the MAPK pathway, signal transducers and activators
  of transcription (STAT) signalling and Src-dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  signalling []. At the membrane, E3s such as c-CBL can decrease oncogenic signalling
  by promoting EGFR ubiquitylation and turnover. RTK signalling converges on several
  pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Activation-dependent
  phosphorylation of RTKs (such as EGFR) facilitates the binding of class 1a PI3K
  via SH2 domains. This leads to the activation of PI3K and subsequent phosphorylation
  of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) []. Via pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, Akt binds PIP3 where it is phosphorylated
  by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1). An important negative regulator
  of this pathway is the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a protein whose
  gene is mutated/deleted in 41% of GB cases. Akt signalling can also be modulated
  via negative feedback loops with phosphatases including PH domain leucine-rich repeat
  protein phosphatase (PHLPP) [, ]. The MAPK pathway is an important downstream signalling
  pathway activated by RTKs. As  one of the most commonly mutated pathways in human
  cancer, it translates  extracellular signals into cellular phenotypes such as proliferation,
  differentiation, migration and invasion []. Following RTK activation, son of sevenless
  (Sos) is recruited to the plasma membrane via interaction with Grb2. Sos is a guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which promotes the activation of membrane-bound
  RAS via binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) with Ras. Active Ras can then promote
  multiple oncogenic cellular responses. In contrast, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)
  accelerate Ras-mediated GTP hydrolysis and act as negative regulators of Ras signalling
  and are therefore tumour suppressors []. Red icons represent E3 ligases and their
  functions as observed in GB models. Where specific substrates are yet to be identified,
  E3 ligases appear as pink icons.
