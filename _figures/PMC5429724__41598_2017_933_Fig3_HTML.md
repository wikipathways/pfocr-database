caption: 'Graphical summary of inter-variable connections for the entire BiliHealth
  study population. Figure 3 illustrates statistical connections of variables of interest.
  Bivariate correlations were calculated for the entire study population using the
  model of Spearman’s rho. R coefficients and p-values (p ≤ 0.05) are presented in
  the box and are summarised in a graphical model. (f): effect valid for female subjects
  only; (m): effect valid for male subjects only. Abbreviations: UCB: unconjugated
  bilirubin; UGT1A1: UGT1A1 genotype; IL-6/IL-1β: interleukins 6 and 1β; BLVRA expr.:
  genetic expression of biliverdin reductase; HMOX expr.: genetic expression of heme
  oxygenase; HMOX (GT)n: heme oxygenase GT fragment lengths expressed as genotype
  (short, medium, long) or as mean fragment length of the two alleles; Hpt: haptoglobin;
  Hpx: hemopexin; CRP: C-reactive protein; SAA: serum amyloid A; BV: biliverdin IXα;
  CO: carbon monoxide; Fe2+: ferrous iron; BMI: body mass index.'
