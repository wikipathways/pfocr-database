caption: 'Effect of uridine on disease through O-GlcNAcylation. Uridine can impact
  diseases by increasing O-GlcNAc of important functional proteins. Current research
  focuses mainly on diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. Elevated O-GlcNAc levels
  of specific proteins can worsen blood glucose status by promoting βcell apoptosis,
  exacerbating insulin resistance, inhibiting glycogen synthesis, promoting gluconeogenesis,
  among other mechanisms. However, in the short term, it can also promote insulin
  secretion, partially explaining the differences in the effects of urinary nucleosides
  on diabetic patients in the short and long term. The typical pathological manifestation
  of Alzheimer’s disease is hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein and deposition of
  β-amyloid protein. Supplementation with uridine can provide neuroprotection by increasing
  O-GlcNAc of Tau protein, reducing Tau phosphorylation, and preventing Tau aggregation.
  It can also shift the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) towards the
  non-amyloidogenic pathway mediated by α-secretase and away from the amyloidogenic
  pathway mediated by β-secretase, reducing the production and deposition of β-amyloid
  protein-induced neurotoxicity. However, high levels of O-GlcNAc can promote tumor
  development by promoting tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis,
  and promoting tumor cell migration. PDX-1:pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1; NeuroD1:neurogenic
