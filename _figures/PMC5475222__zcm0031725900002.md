caption: Secreted T. gondii effectors from dense granules transform host cell signaling
  pathways. After invasion of the host cell, T. gondii uses a large variety of effector
  proteins originating from dense granule organelles to manipulate host signaling
  pathways and gene expression. Some of these proteins translocate to the host nucleus
  (TgIST, GRA24, and GRA16), while others localize to the PV membrane (GRA15) or only
  partially interact with the host cell cytosol while residing in the PV (GRA6). Present
  in all T. gondii type stains, the dense granule protein TgIST globally blocks the
  interferon (IFN) response by the recruitment of the Mi-2/NuRD repressor complex
  to STAT1 binding sites in promoter regions of responsive genes. GRA24 bypasses the
  classical MAPK phosphorylation cascades by forming a complex with p38α, which is
  able to activate transcription factors such as EGR1 and c-Fos. GRA16 shuttles to
  the host nucleus while bound to a high-molecular-weight complex, including PP2A-B55
  and HAUSP, to control p53 levels. In type 2 strains, GRA15 activates the NF-κB pathway
  by the activation of TRAF6, which subsequently activates IKK, leading to the phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκB. GRA6 has a vacuole-restricted location, and its cytosolic
  region interacts with CAMLG to activate calcineurin and stimulate the transcription
  factor NFAT4.
