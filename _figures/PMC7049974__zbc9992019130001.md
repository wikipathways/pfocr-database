caption: Sterol reductases in cholesterol biosynthesis. Four sterol reductases, DHCR24,
  DHCR7, DHCR14, and LBR, catalyze three distinct reactions in cholesterol synthesis.
  In the Bloch pathway, LBR or DHCR14 first reduces the C(14–15) double bond. Then
  DHCR7 and DHCR24 act consecutively to form cholesterol. In the Kandutsch–Russell
  pathway, DHCR24 acts first, followed by LBR or DHCR14 and DHCR7 as the terminal
  enzyme. In addition to these two defined pathways, DHCR24 can shunt intermediates
  from the Bloch pathway into the Kandutsch–Russell pathway at any point. Dashed arrows
  represent multiple enzymatic steps. The purple box indicates the C(14–15) bond on
  FF-MAS and T-MAS, the reaction catalyzed by DHCR14 and LBR. The green box indicates
  the C(24–25) bond on sterol intermediates, the reaction catalyzed by DHCR24 at numerous
  steps in the pathway. The red box indicates the C(7–8) bond on 7DHC and cholesterol,
  the reaction catalyzed by DHCR7.
