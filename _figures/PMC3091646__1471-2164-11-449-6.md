caption: Pontetial metabolic complementation between W. glossinidia and S. glossinidius
  at thiamine biosynthesis level. Thiazole phosphate carboxylate (THZ-P) is synthesized
  by S. glossinidius from exogenous thiamin through salvage pathway (tenA2, thiM),
  whereas hydroxymethyl pyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) is synthesized by W. glossinidia
  from 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) (thiC, thiD). THZ-P and HMP-PP are shared
  between both bacteria to produce the functional thiamine diphosphate that is provided
  to the tsetse host.
papertitle: Mobile genetic element proliferation and gene inactivation impact over
  the genome structure and metabolic capabilities of Sodalis glossinidius, the secondary
  endosymbiont of tsetse flies.
