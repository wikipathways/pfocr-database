caption: SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that catalyses the removal
  of acetyl (Ac) groups from a number of non-histone targets. The downstream effects
  of target deacetylation include changes in cellular metabolism (lipid metabolism,
  insulin sensitivity, reverse cholesterol transport and gluconeogenesis) as well
  as cell survival and senescence effects (cell survival and DNA repair). Several
  protein regulators and small-molecule compounds that can activate or inhibit SIRT1
  function have also been described. AROS, active regulator of SIRT1; DBC1, deleted
  in breast cancer 1; FOXO, forkhead box; HIC1, hypermethylated in cancer 1; LXR,
  liver X receptor; PGc1α, PPARγ coactivator 1α; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B.
