caption: Impaired chloroplast proteostasis triggers an unfolded protein response.(A)
  ROS-driven PSII damage (PSIIoxi) is inevitable during photosynthesis. The thylakoid
  membrane FtsH protease, a heterohexameric complex, degrades damaged PSII core proteins,
  promoting PSII reassembly. The Arabidopsis var2 mutant, which lacks the major subunit
  of the FtsH hexamer FtsH2, accumulates oxidized PSII core proteins with a concurrent
  expression of genes required for chloroplast protein quality control (PQC) and ROS
  detoxification, a signaling pathway dubbed the chloroplast UPR (cpUPR). The var2-evoked
  cpUPR facilitates the removal of damaged chloroplast proteins, thereby restoring
  chloroplast proteostasis to a certain extent. Impaired PSII proteostasis causes
  accumulation of SA via the chloroplast isochorismate (ICS) pathway, resulting in
  the enhanced expression of SA-responsive genes.(B) A similar molecular response
  has also been shown in Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas mutants with reduced stromal
  Clp protease activity. The cpUPR restores the aggregated enzyme DXS∗ in the MEP
  pathway in both the Arabidopsis clp mutant and WT plants treated with lincomycin
  (Lin, a prokaryotic translation inhibitor). Treating WT seedlings with Lin impairs
  the expression of plastid-encoded Clp protease subunits, thereby repressing Clp
  protease activity and inducing the cpUPR. The cpUPR-induced HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION
  FACTOR A-2 (HsfA2) positively regulates the expression of PQC-related nuclear genes.
  Among them, chaperones Hsp70 and ClpB3 refold the aggregated DXS enzyme. Increased
  levels of both chaperones are also observed in the var2 mutant, suggesting that
  var2-driven oxidative stress may lead to aggregation of the DXS enzyme in the MEP
  pathway.
