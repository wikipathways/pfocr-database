caption: The interaction between intestinal inflammation and metabolic reprogramming
  in colorectal cancer (CRC). Chronic inflammation, caused by immune cell infiltration
  and cytokine secretion, activates critical oncogenic pathways including nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These
  pathways initiate and maintain metabolic changes, including increased glycolysis,
  disrupted amino acid metabolism, and lipid reconfiguration. The resultant metabolic
  environment facilitates tumor proliferation and establishes a feedback mechanism
  that supports inflammation, thereby advancing CRC progression
