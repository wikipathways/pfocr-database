caption: Schematic representation of the putative mechanism of the regulation of MnSOD
  via Ser106 phosphorylation by mitochondrial CyclinB1/Cdk1 complex in mammalian cells
  under LDIR. CyclinB1 and Cdk1 translocates into the mitochondria upon radiation
  and phosphorylates MnSOD at Ser106. The phosphorylation of MnSOD enhances its tetrameric
  conformation, stability and enzymatic activity, resulting in decreased ROS levels
  and apoptosis. By this pathway, cells are able to sense a low level genotoxic stress
  and induce an adaptive radioprotection by Cdk1-mediated MnSOD activation.
