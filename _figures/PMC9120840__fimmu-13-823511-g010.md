caption: The proposed model shows that NETs induce M1 polarization of Kupffer cells
  and HMGB1 translocation via HMGB1/TLR-4/MAPK signaling pathway during AR following
  liver transplantation. HMGB1 promotes NET formation by activating the HMGB1/TLR-4/MAPK
  signaling pathway. NETs stimulate M1 polarization of Kupffer cells and HMGB1 intracellular
  translocation. Subsequently, HMGB1 is released into the extracellular milieu to
  aggravate liver injury. HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1 protein; TLR-4, toll-like
  receptor 4; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AR, acute rejection.
