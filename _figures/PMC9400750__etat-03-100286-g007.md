caption: 'The role of Notch signaling in ET resistance. The Notch receptor is activated
  by binding to a ligand (JAG/DLL) presented in a neighboring cell. This interaction
  removes the extracellular portion of Notch from the transmembrane portion, resulting
  in its endocytosis followed by cleavage events by a disintegrin and metalloprotease
  (ADAM) and then by γ secretase, which allows the release of the intracellular Notch
  portion. This intracellular portion translocates to the nucleus, where it binds
  to DNA-binding protein CSL and recruits transcriptional coactivator Mastermind-like
  proteins (MALM) and other transcriptional coactivators to initiate transcription
  of Notch target genes. Notch regulates several cellular processes, and dysregulation
  of this pathway (e.g., through Notch receptor mutations, overexpression of ligands
  and/or receptors, and/or overexpression of target genes) contributes to increased
  cell transformation, proliferation, EMT, BCSCs population, and drug resistance,
  namely ET resistance. Notch signaling inhibition can be accomplished by using different
  molecules, such as γ-secretase inhibitors and antibodies anti-Notch ligands, and/or
  receptors. Co-A: coactivator'
