caption: The relevant signaling pathways of RGS12 in arthritis. RGS12 promotes the
  degradation of IκB by enhancing the ubiquitination. Due to the degradation of IκB,
  NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and further promotes the gene expression of
  cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α during inflammation. RGS12, regulator of
  G protein signaling 12; IκB, inhibitory kappa B; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; IL, interleukin;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This figure was drawn using Figdraw
