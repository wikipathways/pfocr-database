caption: Central carbon metabolism model for M. extorquens AM1 methylotrophic growth.
  Metabolites with * are precursors for biomass. Metabolites in bold are branch points.
  The model includes 114 reactions with 9 reversible reactions and 2 scramble reactions.
  71 intracellular metabolites are included in the model. Methanol is oxidized to
  formate via the H4MPT pathway. Part of the formate pool is converted to CO2 by formate
  dehydrogenase. The other part is converted into methylene H4F via the H4F pathway,
  entering the serine cycle. The serine cycle is the main assimilation pathway, with
  the EMC pathway regenerating glyoxylate in an anaplerotic function. Portions of
  the TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose-phosphate cycle were also operating
  to provide intracellular metabolites for biomass
