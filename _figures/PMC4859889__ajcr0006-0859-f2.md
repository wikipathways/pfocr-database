caption: 'CE-TOFMS analysis of intracellular metabolites related to the main energetic
  metabolic pathways after 24 h of exposure to acidosis: Bar graphs show the relative
  intracellular amount of metabolites. The bars correspond to the mean values of the
  three OS cell lines included in this study, under neutral (blue) and acidic (red)
  conditions, and to the mean of the two normal Fb cultures under neutral (green)
  and acidic conditions (orange), mean ± SD. Metabolic pathway maps were first written
  by VANTED software at HMT, and the copyright has been provided to the authors. A.
  Glycolysis/glycogenesis, pentose-phosphate, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolic
  pathways; B. TCA and urea cycles, Glu/Gln metabolic pathway.'
