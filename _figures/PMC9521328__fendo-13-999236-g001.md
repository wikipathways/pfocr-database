caption: Summary diagram of the classical and non-classical modes of estrogen action.
  In the classical pathway, E2 crosses the plasma membrane by diffusion and binds
  to the estrogen receptor (ER) and forms an E2-receptor complex, which dimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription through an estrogen
  response element (ERE) dependent manner. In the non-classical pathway, E2 interacts
  with membrane bound estrogen receptors (mER), G-protein coupled estrogen receptors
  (GPER), ER-X, or classic ER (ERα/β) and activates kinases and second messenger signaling
  pathways to phosphorylate transcription factors (TF) or coactivators to influence
  gene transcription in the nucleus via a non-ERE-dependent manner. The resultant
  effect of activating these pathways is neuroprotection, modulating plasticity and
  cognition as well as maintenance of homeostasis. However, the extent to which the
  non-classical and classical pathways crosstalk or interact with each other is not
  known. It is likely that both pathways contribute to neuroprotection and homeostasis.
