caption: Predicted pathway and network of all the 11 miRNAs. The potential targets
  of these 11 miRNAs, including genes, molecular and physiological functions, and
  ME/CFS related diseases or symptoms, are shown in one integrated network. The miRNAs
  are represented in blue; the genes that are predicted to interact are in green;
  the diseases that are associated with miRNAs or genes are in light pink; and the
  molecular and physiological functions are in yellow. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software (QIAGEN Inc. software version 51,963,813) and manual curations were
  applied to construct the network.
