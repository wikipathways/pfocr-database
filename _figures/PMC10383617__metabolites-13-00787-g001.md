caption: The metabolic scheme depicts the pathways involved in the catabolism and
  salvage of purine nucleotides. Inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP) represents the branching
  point from which both guanylate and adenylate pools are generated. IMP dehydrogenase
  (4) converts IMP into xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), and adenylosuccinate lyase
  (3) converts succinyl-adenosine 5-monophosphate (S-AMP) into AMP. Purine nucleotides
  are converted to the corresponding nucleosides by 5′-nucleotidases (cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase
  I, 5, and cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II, 6). Guanosine (Guo) and Inosine (Ino) are
  phosphorolytically cleaved into the bases guanine (Gua) and hypoxanthine (Hyp),
  through purine nucleoside phosphorylase (11). Adenosine (Ado) is deaminated to Ino
  by adenosine deaminase (9). Gua, Hyp, and Adenine (Ade) can be salvaged to the corresponding
  nucleotides by phosphoribosyltransferases (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase,
  2, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, 12). Phosphoribosylpyrophospate (PRPP),
  necessary for the salvage of purine bases, is generated by phosphoribosylpyrophosphate
  synthetase (1), starting from ATP and ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5-P). Ado can be generated
  from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), through methyltransferases (13) and S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) hydrolase (10). Ado can be converted into AMP by adenosine kinase (8). Ade
  can be generated from SAM, through the polyamine synthesis pathway (14) and methylthioAdo
  phosphorylase (15). AMP is deaminated to IMP by AMP deaminase (7) and Gua is converted
  to xanthine (Xan) by guanase (16). Eventually, purine bases are converted to uric
  acid (UA) through xanthine oxidoreductase (17).
