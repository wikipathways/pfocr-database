caption: The SARS-CoV-2 entry and life cycle in human lung cells. The S proteins of
  SARS-CoV-2 bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the cellular
  membrane and enters the target cells through an endosomal pathway (1). Then, viral
  components such as RNA are uncoated in the cytoplasm (2). In keeping, the genome
  encodes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (3), which, in turn, participates to
  producing full-length (+) RNA and full length (−) RNA copies (4). During replication,
  genome RNA and RNAs which belong to viral structural components are produced. Then,
  RNAs are translated into viral components and processed by the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER)–Golgi apparatus (GA) (5). Once SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are formed, nucleocapsids
  initially are assembled in the cytoplasm, and then they are budding into the lumen
  of the ER and GA (6). Finally, mature viruses are secreted out of the infected cell
  via exocytosis (7). EE, early endosome
