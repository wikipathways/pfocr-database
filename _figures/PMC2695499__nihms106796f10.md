caption: Changes in OSM signaling. (a-c) Microarray data analysis of OSM signaling
  in PP cells versus cultured cells. Genes with higher expression in PP cells are
  in pink, those expressed less well in PP cells are in green, those not expressed
  are in grey (IL6ST, interleukin-6 signal transducer). The OSM signaling pathway
  was intact, although STAT3 was upregulated in cultured cells, probably explaining
  the responsiveness of P3 cells to added OSM.
