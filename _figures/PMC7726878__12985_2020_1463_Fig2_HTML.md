caption: Mechanism of responses of TLRs to EBV and HCMV. EBV activates the MyD88 pathway
  or the MyD88-independent pathway via the viral envelope and products. Upon EBV stimulation,
  TLR2, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 inside and outside the cells induce NF-κB or IRF-5/7
  by a series of protein kinases to produce cyto-inflammatory factors. MyD88 recruits
  TRAF6 and IRAKs to activate the IKK complex composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO. Besides
  acting as an inflammatory mediator, NF-κB also upregulates the expression of LMP1
  to trigger moderate inflammation. Similarly, HCMV reacts with TLRs, including TLR2,
  TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9, through the viral envelope or products. MyD88-NF-κB is the
  main pathway. However, dsRNA from CMV also activates IRF-3 and TLR3 to promote the
  expression of inflammatory factors. Meanwhile, the CMV-encoded miR-UL112-3p inhibits
  activation of the TLR2/NF-κB pathway, as well as the expression of various cytokines
