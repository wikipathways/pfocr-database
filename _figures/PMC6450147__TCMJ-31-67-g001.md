caption: The transcriptional regulation circuit of clock genes in mammal. Circadian
  rhythm is mediated by the genes Brain muscle ARNT-like1 and circadian locomotor
  output cycles kaput act in a positive feedback loop to regulate expression of the
  transcriptional-translational feedback loop of core clock genes during late night
  and early morning. They form a heterodimer and binds to enhancer box elements, DNA
  response element with protein-binding site, within the promoter regions of Period,
  CRY, REV-ERB, and RORs. Period and CRY accumulate in the cytoplasm and form complexes
  that translocate back into the nucleus and inhibit brain muscle ARNT-like1/circadian
  locomotor output cycles kaput -mediated transcription during late day and nighttime.
  In addition, reverse-related erythroblastoma proteins exert a negative feedback
  by inhibiting Bmal1 transcription, while related orphan receptor proteins are positive
  regulators of Bmal1 transcription. Related orphan receptors compete with reverse-related
  erythroblastoma for related orphan receptor element binding sites of Bmal1 promoter.
  The genes highlighted in yellow are also involved in depression, however, the pathway
  that links depression and circadian rhythm disturbance is not delineated yet
