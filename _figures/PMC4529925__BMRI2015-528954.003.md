caption: Model of SAM68 interaction with pre-mRNAs and splicing regulation. (a) SAM68
  recognition of A/U-rich bipartite sequence in the pre-mRNA homodimerization allows
  simultaneous binding to the pre-mRNA and to U2AF65 [–]. Tyrosine phosphorylation
  of SAM68 reduces the RNA binding affinity and thus releases SAM68 from the pre-mRNA.
  (b) Model of alternative splicing events regulated by SAM68 in cancer cells. (A)
  SAM68 promotes inclusion of CD44 variable exon v5. Inclusion of variable exons in
  the CD44 pre-mRNA is specific to cancer cells and correlates with cancer progression
  and invasiveness []. (B) SAM68 promotes splicing events that regulate cell proliferation.
  Binding of SAM68 to CCND1 intron 4 interferes with the correct recruitment of U1
  snRNP at the exon 4 5′ splice sites, thus enhancing retention of intron 4 and generating
  the Cyclin D1b isoform. In prostate cancer, the expression of Cyclin D1b interrupts
  a negative feedback in the regulation of androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional
  activity, thereby promoting cell proliferation []. (C) As for CCND1, SAM68 promotes
  retention of SRSF1 intron 4, thus stabilizing SRSF1 pre-mRNA and inhibiting its
  degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) []. Accumulation of SRSF1 in turn favors
  the splicing of ΔRON, an oncogenic variant of RON that triggers epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). (D) SAM68 regulates the alternative splicing of BCL2L1 leading
  to the short (BCL-X(s)) proapoptotic isoform []. This activity can be reverted by
  tyrosine phosphorylation of SAM68 from SRC family kinases, thereby switching the
  role of SAM68 from being proapoptotic to being antiapoptotic and allowing cells
  to differentially react to external cues. (E) SAM68 regulates mTOR alternative splicing
  thus leading to the correct mRNA isoform and avoiding retention of intron 5 that
  generates a premature termination codon and the consequent reduction of mTOR protein
  levels []. Notably, mTOR is a critical effector in cell-signalling pathways commonly
  deregulated in human cancers and overexpression of the components involved in the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been shown to induce malignant transformation.
