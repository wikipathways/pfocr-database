caption: Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) mutations
  in the cytoplasmic region of the cysteine-X-cysteine chemokine receptor CXCR4 result
  in gain-of-function. Upon CXCL12 binding, CXCR4 undergoes conformational changes
  and the intracellular trimeric G-protein is activated. The Gα subunit dissociates
  from the βγ-subunit and various pathways including the Ras/Raf/ERK (extracellular
  regulated kinase), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), PLC (phospholipase C), PKC
  (protein kinase C), and mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are activated.
  These subsequently result in chemotaxis, increased proliferation, and cell survival
  []. β-arrestin 2 also augments chemotaxis by enhancing p38 MAPK activation [,].
  Inhibition of CXCR4 signaling occurs by the β-arrestin pathway. CXCL12 binding recruits
  GPCR kinase (GRK), which induces site-specific phosphorylation at the C-terminus
  of CXCR4. β-arrestin associates with CXCR4 and triggers receptor internalization.
  Subsequently, either the chemokine receptor is recycled back to the cell surface
  or it is degraded by the proteasome. In WHIM syndrome, most mutations cause truncation
  of the C-terminus of CXCR4 and the phosphorylation sites of GRK for β-arrestin docking
  are no longer available, leading to reduced desensitization and prolonged signaling
  [,]. The blue arrows indicate induction, while the red “T” bar denotes inhibition.
