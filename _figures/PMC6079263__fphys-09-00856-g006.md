caption: One of the main mechanotransduction pathways in VSM cell contractility is
  the RhoA/ROCK regulated integrin-actomyosin axis. Mechanical signals (e.g., pressure,
  matrix stiffness) presented to VSM cells through integrins stimulate the activity
  of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) which in turn activate RhoA pathway,
  including ROCK which enhances actomyosin contractility. Consequently, actomyosin-induced
  contractility promotes VSM cell stiffening. This effect feeds back (dashed arrow)
  into changing cytoskeletal tension and integrin mechanosensing at the membrane level.
  Integrin α5β1 is known to be involved in regulating cellular and vessel contractility
  (). In young cells, actomyosin apparatus is strong and the VSM cell is able to properly
  regulate its stiffness and adhesion to the matrix in response to mechanical signals.
  In aging, however, the decrease in SMα-actin stress fiber formation and alteration
  of cell-matrix adhesions induces a reduced VSM cell contractility and deficient
  mechanosensing. We suggest that this dysregulation induces compensatory effects
  by up-regulating ROCK and SMγ-actin which increases cell stiffness without regaining
  contractile properties of the cell (see table inset).
