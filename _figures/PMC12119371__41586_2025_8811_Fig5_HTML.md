caption: a, Model comparing classical ligand-induced activation of GCGRs (right) and
  constitutive GCGR activity controlling hepatic glucose output. In birds and Agamidae,
  constitutively active GCGR is highly expressed in liver, activating the Gs signalling
  pathway and enhancing glucose and lipid metabolism even in the absence of ligand
  stimulation. Red arrows show constitutive activity and dashed arrows show ligand-regulated
  (transient) activity. b, Proposed model for the putative role of GCGR in flight
  adaptation in birds. High expression of constitutively active GCGR in liver upregulates
  downstream glucose and lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. This is one of the
  potential factors that facilitated flight in birds. Cartoons created in BioRender;
