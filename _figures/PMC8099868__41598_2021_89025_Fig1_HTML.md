caption: Deuterium incorporation into triglycerides occurs during de novo fatty acid
  synthesis. Different tissue compartments are represented (crop, midgut, hemolymph,
  ovary and fat body). The TG synthetic pathway utilizes substrates that have been
  labelled with deuterium, including acetyl CoA, NADPH and water. Hydrogen atoms (H)
  highlighted in red indicate the location where deuterium (D) may have replaced hydrogen
  in a newly synthesized molecule. TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle, CoASH coenzyme
  A, RCO-S-CoA acetyl-coenzyme A, malonyl-CoA malonyl coenzyme A, NADPH nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate, LTP lipid transfer particle, LP lipophorin, DG diglyceride,
  TG triglyceride.
