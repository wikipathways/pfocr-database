caption: Altered signaling pathways and mouse models of thyroid cancer. Mouse models
  are indicated by an (*). Aberrant signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
  such as the RET and NTRK1 receptors induce papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Overactivation
  of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (or MAPK signaling pathway) leads to PTC. The BRAFV600E
  mutation results in constitutive activation of BRAF and is commonly found in PTC.
  RAS overactivation is common to both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)
  models. TSH receptor (TSHR) signaling via adenyl cyclases/cAMP/protein kinase A
  (PKA) is important for normal thyroid growth, but only a few models of TSHR overactivation
  develop thyroid cancer (Prkar1aΔ2/+, Rap1bG12V). The adrenergic receptor may also
  contribute to thyroid cancer development also through increased cAMP and signaling
  via pathways such as MAPK and protein kinase C (PKC). Overactivation in the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway via cell-surface receptors such TSHR or inactivation of the phosphatase,
  PTEN, are important for FTC tumorigenesis. TRßPV/PV mice also have PI3K-AKT overactivation
  and develop FTC. Please see text for additional details regarding these mouse models.
