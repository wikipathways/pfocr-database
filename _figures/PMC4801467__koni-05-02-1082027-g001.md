caption: 'Mechanisms and immunotherapeutic targets for glioblastoma (GBM). GBM cells,
  tumor-resident dendritic cells (DC) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
  express indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). IDO1 expression is regulated by the
  Jak/STAT and NF-κB pathways, which is induced by IFNγ- and TGF-β-receptor activation,
  respectively. IDO1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that metabolizes tryptophan (Trp) to
  kynurenine (Kyn). Within the GBM cell, Kyn complexes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (Ahr), cytoplasmically, facilitating the nuclear translocation and further docking
  with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to transcriptionally
  regulate IL-6, acting as an autocrine loop that amplifies and sustains IDO1 expression.
  Simultaneously, extracellular Kyn suppresses T effector responses while activating
  regulatory T cell (Treg; CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) function through a presumably overlapping
  mechanism. IDO1 directly activates NF-κB signaling which maintains and/or upregulates
  TGF-β expression. Increased TGF-β levels upregulate CTLA-4 and GITR expression by
  Treg. CTLA-4 interacts with B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) on DC, resulting in the
  induction of IDO1 (in DC) and commensurate downregulation of antigen presentation
  to T cells. Both GBM and MDSC express TGF-β, which synergizes with PD-L1 to suppress
  the T cell effector response via interaction with PD-1. Moreover, interleukin-10
  (IL-10)- and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-expressing MDSC act on their cognate receptors
  expressed by GBM to ramify Jak/STAT and NK-κB-mediated signaling. DNA released by
  dead/dying GBM cells is phagocytized by resident DC to activate the STING pathway
  leading to Type 1 interferon (α/β) expression, supporting increased effectiveness
  of anti-GBM immunity. PD-1 is highly expressed by tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T
  cells and PD-L1 is upregulated on cancer/stromal cells in response to T-cell-secreted
  IFNγ. Blocking the interaction of PD-1-expressing T cells with PD-L1 leads to increased
  effector function and enhanced GBM immunity. Targets for immunomodulation are shown
  in red. Note: Although IDO1 expression and signaling are shown in GBM cells, shared
  signaling patterns are presumed to be present in DC and MDSC as well. TCON: conventional
