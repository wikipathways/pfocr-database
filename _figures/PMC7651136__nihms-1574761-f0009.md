caption: 'Targeting the ATR pathway to prevent cancer development. (A) ATR inhibition
  prevents UV-induced skin cancer development. After UV exposure, ATR induces cell
  cycle arrest that allows time for DNA repair, resulting in limited apoptosis. However,
  when DNA replication is ongoing before completion of DNA repair, mutations may be
  incorporated via DNA damage tolerance mechanisms (‘mutagenic survival’), leading
  to skin cancer development. In contrast, inhibition of the ATR pathway that is essential
  for surviving UV damage leads to augmented apoptosis. This contributes to elimination
  of DNA-damaged cells that are at increased risk of malignant transformation, thereby
  inhibiting skin cancer development. (B) ATR inhibition sensitizes p53-defective
  cells to DNA-damaging agents. Normal cells have two major pathways that respond
  to DNA damage: the ATM-CHK2-p53 and ATR-CHK1 pathways, which induce cell cycle arrest
  and DNA repair. However, precancerous cells are often defective in p53 and thus
  rely on the ATR-CHK1 pathway to survive DNA damage. When p53-defective precancerous
  cells are treated with an ATR inhibitor in the presence of a DNA-damaging agent
  (e.g., UV or chemotherapeutic drug), these cells will have no intact DNA damage
  response pathway to survive the DNA damage (synthetic lethality of defective p53
  and ATR inhibition). As a result, precancerous cells will undergo apoptosis, and
  cancer development will be suppressed. This synthetic lethality provides the molecular
  basis for the use of ATR inhibitors to prevent cancer development from p53-defective
  cells.'
