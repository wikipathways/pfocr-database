caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of the immune response are involved in the progression
  of ALD. 1) Immune cells recognize PAMPs and DAMPs triggered by ALD through PRRs,
  initiating responses to clear pathogens and dead cells, which may also trigger immune
  cells to attack the liver, exacerbating liver damage. 2) Alcohol intake increases
  gut permeability and LPS leakage, LPS is translocated into the liver, activating
  the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway of liver Kupffer cells, and promoting the production
  of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. 3) Chemokines CXCL1 and
  CXCL8 promote neutrophil adhesion to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and migration
  to the liver, exacerbating liver inflammation. In addition, LCN2 promotes the chemotaxis
  of neutrophils. 4) In AAH patients, high expression of immune checkpoints PD1 and
  TIM3 on T cells may lead to impaired antibacterial immune response and decreased
  antibacterial activity of T cells and neutrophils. 5) Alcohol downregulates the
  expression level of CRIg on the surface of Kupffer cells, weakening the liver’s
  ability to phagocytize pathogens, thereby accelerating the progression of ALD. 6)
  Alcohol causes NK cell apoptosis, disrupts the balance between NK cells and ILC1
  cells, increases the expression of IL-17A, and further aggravates liver inflammation
  and fibrosis. 7) Alcohol affects the intestinal immune balance, reduces mucosal-associated
  invariant T cells, increases intestinal susceptibility and causes intestinal damage,
  thereby destroying the intestinal-liver axis and aggravating ALD. Abbreviation:
