caption: 'APC activity is decreased under nutrient conditions, and increased when
  nutrients are limiting. Inhibition of APC activity by glucose is mediated by the
  Ras/PKA pathway [,,,]. Recent work suggests that this is accomplished by driving
  the activity of the SCF ubiquitin ligase by the phosphorylation and activation of
  the SCF E2 component Cdc34 by the nutrient response kinases PKA and Sch9 (AKT/S6K)
  []. This could mediate APC inhibition, as it has been shown that the SCF targets
  the degradation of CDH1 during mitosis [,]. Our unpublished data also reveals that
  Sch9 likely inhibits Fkh1 function, and the subsequent induction of the stress pathways.
  Upon encountering stress, SIRT2 deacetylates and activates FOXO proteins [], and
  in yeast, Sir2 physically associates with Fkh1 to facilitate inhibition of CLB2
  transcription in late M/G1 []. Fkh1 transcribes stress response genes (depicted
  by a a blue shaded “Tr”), including SNF1, which encodes the catalytic component
  of the SNF1 kinase, the yeast AMPK [,]. FOXO and AMPK interact across evolutionary
  boundaries to deal with stress [,,]. The SNF1 kinase then enters the nucleus and
  inhibits the glucose responsive repressor Mig1, which represses the expression of
  the APC subunits APC4 and APC9 under nutrient conditions []. DNA repair is likely
  mediated, at least in part, by the APC, which controls the deposition and modification
  of histones during mitosis, which plays a pivotal role in DNA repair [,,,,,]. Inhibition
  of SCF-Cdc34 following APC activation is accomplished in two ways: first, the APC
  targets the SCF F-box protein Skp2 for degradation in G1 [,], and second, our unpublished
  data shows that the APC targets Sch9 for degradation once nutrients are depleted.
  Preliminary unpublished data is shown using dashed lines.'
