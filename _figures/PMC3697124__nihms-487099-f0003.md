  burgdorferi (10 MOI-equivalent) for 2 or 12 h. Pathway analysis was performed using
  Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software, version 5.0. Two pathways with high
  significance of genes regulated by doxycycline in THP-1 cells at 2 h (A) and 12
  h (B) were identified and merged. Color indicates the degree of up- (red) or down-regulation
