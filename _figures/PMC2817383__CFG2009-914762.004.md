caption: Putative host signaling pathway induced by Y. pestis bacterial effectors,
  LPS and Lpp. TLR-2, TLR-4, CD14, and INF-γ were transcriptionally upregulated in
  host tissues in response to WT Y. pestis infection. Binding of TLR-4 by LPS and
  TLR-2 by Lpp is inferred from literature and canonical pathway databases (e.g.,
  Biocarta). Myd88 and IRAK, which are TLR adaptor molecules, were upregulated by
  WT. Y. pestis, resulting in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPKs), three of which (Map3k6, Map3k8, and Map4k5) were transcriptionally upregulated
  in WT Y. pestis-infected mice based on microarray analysis results. MAPKs are known
  to phsophorylate and activate nemo-like kinase (Nik), which was upregulated in WT
  bacteria-infected mice but not in animals infected with the Δlpp mutant. Phosphorylation
  of Nik is known to cause activation of NF-κB, which was also transcriptionally upregulated
  in WT Y. pestis-infected mice. Engagement of IFN-γ to its receptor also leads to
  NF-κB activation via STAT 2 and 3, which were upregulated in WT Y. pestis-infected
  animals. NF-κB activation results in transcription of proinflammatory cytokines,
  which were indeed upregulated based on microarray analysis (examples are listed
  in the diagram). The three MAPKs that were transcriptionally upregulated based on
  microarray analysis are known activators of c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) which
  leads to activation of Elk-1 and AP-1 transcription factors. AP-1 is composed of
  c-Jun and Fos subunits, both of which were upregulated in WT infected mice. Leukemia
  inhibitory factor (Lif) was uniquely upregulated in mice infected with the mutant
  and thus is likely inhibited in the presence of lpp, as shown. Cyclin D3 (Ccnd3)
  was uniquely upregulated in the spleen of WT-infected mice and the lung of Δlpp
  mutant infected mice and leads to increased cell proliferation. Prostaglandin E
  synthase (Ptges), Bak1, Bcl2l1, and hexokinase 1 (Hk1) are all known to regulate
  apoptosis. Each of the genes encoding these proteins was differentially expressed
  in Δlpp mutant-infected animals, compared to those infected with WT Y. pestis. Most
  likely, Lpp contributes to inhibition of host cell apoptosis and modulates inflammatory
  responses in coordination with LPS [].
