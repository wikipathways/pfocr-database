caption: 'Importance of the type I IGF receptor and PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in the
  IGF-protection from anoikis. Representations of the alpha and beta integrins (cyan
  and light purple) and their activation of Akt via the focal adhesion and FAK signal
  transduction pathway (green) (a). The homo-tetrameric type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR,
  pink) has the α-chains of each receptor coloured lighter than the β-chains. The
  extracellular ligands: insulin (orange), IGF-2 (ochre) and IGF-1 (pale yellow) are
  shown. Signal transduction from the activated receptor is depicted through IRS-1
  via the PI3-kinase, PIP3, mTOR2, PDPK1 and Akt pathway (pink) or the Grb2, SOS,
  Ras, Raf, MEK1 and MEK2, ERK1 and ERK2 pathway (purple). The downward pointing grey
  arrow indicates constitutive activation of ERK1 and ERK2. The downward pointing
  metallic blue arrows indicate that a signal has been transduced from each pathway.
  The pale gold spheres represent phosphorylated moieties. The GTP on activated Ras
  is a light yellow sphere and the GDP on inactive Ras an ivory sphere. Uncleaved
  inactive caspase 3 is shown as a small bright yellow sphere and uncleaved active
  PARP as a large bright yellow sphere. Cleaved active caspase 3 and cleaved inactive
  PARP are shown as the equivalent fragmented spheres. Downward pointing larger blue
  arrows indicate that cell survival and downward pointing red arrows indicate that
  cell death ensues. Kinase inhibitors (brick red) that inhibit PI3-kinase, LY294002,
  or Akt, GSK 690693, abrogate the protective effect of IGF on cell survival of unattached
  cells (b) whereas the MEK1 and MEK2 kinase inhibitor, U0126, does not (c). Inhibition
  of the type I IGF receptor with the specific inhibitory antibody, figitumumab (brick
  red), induces anoikis in IGF-stimulated cells or in cells grown in serum (d)'
