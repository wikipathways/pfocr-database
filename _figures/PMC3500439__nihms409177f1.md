caption: Several signaling pathways relevant to cancer pathogenesis have been shown
  to converge upon and regulate the expression and activity of PGC-1α and β, two key
  ERRα coactivators. It has been demonstrated recently that activation of HER2 and
  IGF-1R signaling pathways increase the expression of PGC-1β through induction of
  c-MYC. Similarly, activation of the mTOR/YY-1 pathway secondary to PI3K-Akt activation
  can induce the expression of PGC-1α. In addition, hypoxia and nutrient stress are
  also known inducers of PGC-1α whereas saturated fatty acids and cytokines have been
  shown to induce PGC-1β expression under physiological/pathological conditions. The
  resulting ERRα/PGC-1α/1β complex induces the expression of genes involved in the
  TCA cycle, OXPHOS and other processes involved in energy metabolism. ERRα has also
  been shown to interact with the β-catenin/TCF complex and with HIF-1 and reciprocally
  modulate each others’ transcriptional activities to effect cell migration and angiogenesis.
  ERRα activity has also been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation downstream
  of the HER2 signaling.
