caption: 'Mechanisms of extrinsic apoptotic pathways in stem cells. The extrinsic
  apoptotic pathway (also known as the death receptor-dependent pathway) is induced
  by the connection between death receptors exposed on the cell surface [tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor] and the specific TNF family ligands. Subsequently, this signaling
  causes a conformational change leading to the recruitment of Fas-associated death
  domain (FADD) and allows interactions between FADD and casp-8 and/or the casp-10,
  resulting in the cleavage and activation of casp-3 and casp-7 through their death
  domain. Finally, the active and cleaved casp-3 induces changes in phosphatidylserine
  exposure, DNA fragmentation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Also, casp-8
  can target the BH3-only protein Bid and cleave Bid to a truncated fragment t-Bid,
  which could connect to the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The T-shaped lines indicate
  inhibitory interactions involved in this pathway, while the solid arrows indicate
  activating interactions. FADD: Fas-associated death domain.'
