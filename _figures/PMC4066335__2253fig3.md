caption: All diabetes drugs are likely to have indirect effects in the CNS by affecting
  circulating concentrations of glucose and insulin. However, the especially intimate
  relationship between brain insulin resistance and AD, and the relative “paralysis”
  of brain insulin signaling through the IRS-1 → AKT pathway (pink) in MCI and AD,
  suggests that restoring signaling through this pathway with therapeutic agents originally
  developed for the treatment of diabetes may be of particular benefit. One approach
  is to overcome brain insulin resistance with exogenous insulin, but a theoretical
  concern of this approach is that in the long-run the chronic hyperinsulinemic environment
  will actually perpetuate brain insulin resistance. Other therapies, including GLP-1
  agonists (e.g., exenatide, liraglutide), metformin, leptin analogs (metreleptin),
  amylin analogs (pramlintide), and PTP1B inhibitors may circumvent insulin-signaling
  impairment and reestablish signaling through the IRS-1 → AKT pathway. Peroxisome
  proliferator–activated receptor-γ agonists, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone,
  which reduce blood glucose by increasing GLUT-4 translocation but have been unsuccessful
  in improving outcomes in well-powered studies of AD, are somewhat removed from this
  impaired insulin-signaling pathway. NFT, neurofibrillary tangles.
