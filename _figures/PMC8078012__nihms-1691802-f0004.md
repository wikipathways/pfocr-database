caption: Axin accelerates the β-catenin reaction when competing substrates are present.(A)
  Prediction for the effect of Axin on pS45-β-catenin phosphorylation when a competing
  substrate is present. When a competitor is present at saturating concentrations
  and pS45-β-catenin is present at subsaturating concentrations, the competitor forms
  a complex with GSK3β and inhibits the reaction with pS45-β-catenin. Axin disrupts
  the interaction of GSK3β with the competitor, preventing buildup of the GSK3β•competitor
  complex. Using a Michaelis-Menten model with a pS133-CREB127-135 competitive inhibitor
  present at 1 μM concentration (), we predict that Axin should produce a 15-fold
  increase on the β-catenin phosphorylation rate in the presence of pS133-CREB127-135,
  much larger than the 3-fold increase in the absence of competitor. A similar analysis
  with pS657-GS634-666 as the competitor predicts an 8-fold increase in β-catenin
  (); the predicted effect is smaller than for CREB because the KM of GSK3β for GS
  is larger () and 1 μM GS is not fully saturating. (B) β-catenin phosphorylation
  rates (Vobs) measured at 20 nM GSK3β and 50 nM pS45-β-catenin (subsaturating) in
  the presence and absence of 500 nM miniAxin with either no competitor, 1 μM pS133-CREB127-135,
  or 1 μM pS657-GS634-666. Values are mean ± SD for at least 3 measurements. In the
  absence of competitor, Axin produces a 3-fold rate increase. In the presence of
  CREB or GS competitors, Axin produces 20-fold or 8-fold rate increases, respectively,
  similar to the predicted values.
