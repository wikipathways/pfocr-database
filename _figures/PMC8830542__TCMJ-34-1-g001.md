caption: Schematic summary of the molecular mechanisms involving the formation of
  nevi, dysplastic nevi and melanoma from a normal melanocyte. In skin, keratinocytes
  and melanocytes function together as epidermal melanin unit to respond to ultraviolet
  irradiation, the well-known environmental risk factor for skin cancers. In normal
  skin, ultraviolet induces p53/proopiomelanocortin signaling pathway activation in
  keratinocytes to stimulate α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone production, which binding
  to melanocortin 1 receptor on melanocytes to enhance eumelanin formation (the natural
  sunscreen) in one way, and to induce tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homologs,
  which inhibits the PI3k/Akt pathway in the other way. Wild-type BRAF in melanocytes
  can be activated by binding of kit ligand from ultraviolet-irradiated keratinocytes
  to receptor c-kit or binding of other growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinase,
  to promote normal melanocyte growth and proliferation. Therefore, α-melanocyte-stimulating
  hormone/melanocortin 1 receptor/phosphatase and tensin homologs signaling pathway
  plays an important role to counteract BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway activation
  induced melanocyte proliferation to prevent melanoma formation. Once the BRAFV600E
  mutation occurs (mostly with ultraviolet signature), if p53 is intact, ultraviolet
  will induce p16 expression which in turn induces melanocyte senescence, that is
  nevi. If phosphatase and tensin homologs loss or p53 mutated or p16 suppressed,
  the BRAFV600E mutation induced proliferation will become exaggerated, that is melanoma.
  If phosphatase and tensin homologs partial loss, BRAFV600E mutated nevi may become
  dysplastic nevi. Abnormal melanocytes may secret exosome carrying programmed cell
  death ligand-1, which binding to programmed cell death-1 receptor on T cells to
  escape immune surveillance. Therefore, BRAFV600E mutation is frequently detected
  in nevi, the senescence status and also with the potential to develop melanoma,
  if together with melanocortin 1 receptor deficiency, phosphatase and tensin homologs
  loss, p53 mutation, or p16 suppression. Immune suppression in endogenous environment
  may impact a lot on the behavior of nevi, dysplastic nevi or melanoma. CK1α inhibition
  is an ultraviolet-sparing approach to activate p53/kit ligand/Kit pathway to stimulate
  eumelanin formation, which may provide a rescue for α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone/melanocortin
  1 receptor deficiency associated with pheomelanin formation
