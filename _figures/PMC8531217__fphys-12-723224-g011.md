caption: Cartoon representation of the inhibition by 25-HC of bacterial spread between
  epithelial cells. Upper panel, plasma membrane accessible cholesterol is required
  for bacterial cell–cell transmission. Lower panel, activated macrophages secrete
  25-HC which stimulates the endoplasmic reticulum-located enzyme ACAT/SOAT to rapidly
  esterify cholesterol for storage in lipid droplets leading to reduced accessible
  cholesterol in the plasma membrane, this prevents bacterial spread across neighboring
  cells. A supporting role in reducing accessible cholesterol is played by inhibition
  of the SREPB-2 pathway but over a longer timeframe.
