caption: Schematic diagram of the most probable 3OC12-HSL signaling pathway. Because
  inhibition of tyrosine kinases (by Gefinitib), of phospholipase C (PLC) (by U73122),
  of protein kinase C (PKC) (by Staurosporin), and of mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MEK) (by SB203580) inhibited the chemotaxis induced by 3OC12-HSL, we propose that
  the putative 3OC12-HSL receptor binds to a tyrosine kinase and induces the signaling
  pathway indicated on the left. This pathway differs from that for IL-8 because the
  IL-8 receptor is associated with G protein (the signal can be inhibited by pertussis
  toxin) (signaling pathway shown on the right). Triggering of the IL-8 receptor also
  leads to activation of phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).
  The latter presumably activates mitogen-activated protein kinase and thus could
  represent an alternative or additional signaling pathway for IL-8, and this explains
  why preincubation of PMN with 3OC12-HSL reduced the chemotaxis toward IL-8 and not
  vice versa. On the right, the well-established signaling pathway for the IL-8-receptor
  (IL-8-R) is shown; activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) leads to upregulation of
  cyclic AMP (cAMP) and eventually upregulation of protein kinase A (PKA). DAG, diacylglycerol,
  Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
