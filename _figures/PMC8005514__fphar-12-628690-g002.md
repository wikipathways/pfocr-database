caption: PI3K/AKT pathway and hormone therapy resistance. The interaction between
  ER signaling and the RTK pathway is considered a major mechanism of resistance to
  hormone therapy. Upregulation of both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways
  activates the ERα-independent pathway in the absence of estrogen though extranuclear
  ER signaling, thus causing estrogen-regulated gene activation that ultimately promotes
  cancer cell survival and leads to hormone therapy resistance.
