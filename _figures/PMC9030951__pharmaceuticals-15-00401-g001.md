caption: '(a,b): Scheme showing adaptive (homeostatic) and maladaptive unfolded protein
  response (UPR) in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Adaptive UPR: Accumulation of misfolded
  proteins within the ER causes ER stress, which is sensed by the three major ER-transmembrane
  proteins IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. IRE1 pathway: Upon activation, IRE1 through its endoribonuclease
  activity induces the splicing of ER-transcription factor XBP1. The spliced XBP1
  (sXBP1) translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of genes that encode
  proteins involved in mitigation of ER stress. Independent of IRE1 activation, the
  nuclear translocation of sXBP1 is mediated by insulin and coagulation protease activated
  protein C (aPC). Within the insulin sensitive renal podocytes, insulin signaling
  via insulin receptor and the downstream regulatory subunits of PI3Kinase, p85α,
  and p85β promotes nuclear translocation of sXBP1. Akin to insulin, aPC signaling
  via protease activated receptors promotes nuclear translocation of sXBP1 in a p85α
  and a p85β dependent fashion. Both insulin and aPC signaling in glomerular cell
  types (podocytes and endothelial cells) specifically activates sXBP1 dependent proteostasis
  pathway, without inducing PERK or ATF6 pathways. During severe or unmitigated ER
  stress, IRE1α-RNase can also cleave ER-localized mRNAs or non-coding functional
  RNAs, leading to their degradation through regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD).
  RIDD not only reduces the ER protein folding load, but also modulates inflammation,
  metabolism, and inflammasome signaling pathway. Additionally, the cytoplasmic domain
  of IRE1α serves as a scaffold, which recruits adaptor proteins (e.g., tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF). The IRE1/TRAF complexes activate inflammatory
  responses under non-canonical ER stress conditions. PERK pathway: Upon activation,
  PERK induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α which transiently attenuates the translation
  in order to reduce protein synthesis. Concomitant activation of stress inducible
  transcription factor ATF4 induces the expression of genes that are involved in redox
  homeostasis, amino acid metabolism, autophagy, ER-protein folding, and apoptosis.
  Additionally, ATF4 participates in a feedback loop mediated by PPI and GADD34 to
  dephosphorylate eIF2α and to restore protein synthesis. However, severe ER stress
  may trigger ATF4-dependent cell death program by activation of CHOP. Thus, the magnitude
  of ER stress and the disease-specific stimuli may disparately modulate PERK-ATF4
  dependent adaptive and maladaptive cellular responses. ATF6 pathway: Upon activation
  ATF6 relocates to the Golgi-complex. Within the Golgi-complex the full length ATF6α-p90
  undergoes proteolytic cleavage mediated by site1 and site2 proteases (S1P and S2P),
  resulting in a highly active transcription factor ATF6α-p50, which translocates
  to the nucleus to induce gene expression. ATF6 induces the expression of genes that
  are involved in ER-protein folding, protein secretion, ERAD, autophagy, and apoptosis.
  b: Maladaptive UPR in diabetic nephropathy (DN). The disease-specific stimuli (for
  e.g., hyperglycemia) in chronic DN coupled with loss of insulin or insulin resistance
  diminishes the nuclear translocation of sXBP1. Subsequently, chronic hyperglycemia
  specifically activates ATF6 pathway, which promotes the expression of proapoptotic
  CHOP and DN. Of note, activation of the PERK-ATF4 pathway was not observed in DN,
  suggesting cell- and disease-specific regulation of the UPR. The loss of the sXBP1
  function often results in hyperactivation of IRE1α. The IRE1α-TRAF2/JNK and IRE1α-RIDD
  axis activates BAX/BAK mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by activating
  caspase-2 or caspase-8 dependent activation of BH3-interacting domain death agonist
  (BID). Additionally, the IRE1α-RIDD axis promotes degradation of microRNA-17(miR-17),
  which stabilizes the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and promotes inflammasome
  activation. Inflammasome activation mediated by TXNIP or mitochondrial reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) promotes caspase-1/IL-1β/IL-18 dependent sterile inflammation.
  The IRE1α-TRAF2/JNK signaling also modulates autophagy. Additionally, persistent
  activation of ATF6α in DN may promote a CHOP-dependent apoptosis program. CHOP promotes
  ER stress induced apoptosis by activating death receptor 5 (DR5) dependent caspase-8
  activation or by activating the Bcl-2 and BH3-only family members NOXA, PUMA, BID,
  BAX, and BAK.'

    The IRE1α-TRAF2/JNK and IRE1α-RIDD axis activates BAX/BAK mediated mitochondrial
    dysfunction and apoptosis by activating caspase-2 or caspase-8 dependent activation
    of BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID). Additionally, the IRE1α-RIDD axis
    promotes degradation of microRNA-17(miR-17), which stabilizes the thioredoxin-interacting

    mediated by TXNIP or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) promotes caspase-1/IL-1β/IL-18
    dependent sterile inflammation. The IRE1α-TRAF2/JNK signaling also modulates autophagy.
    Additionally, persistent activation of ATF6α in DN may promote a CHOP-dependent
    apoptosis program. CHOP promotes ER stress induced apoptosis by activating death
    receptor 5 (DR5) dependent caspase-8 activation or by activating the Bcl-2 and
    BH3-only family members NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAX, and BAK.'
