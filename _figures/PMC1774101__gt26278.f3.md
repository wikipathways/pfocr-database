caption: Proposed framework for continuous recruitment of T cells into the gut mucosa
  through CD40/CD40L dependent mechanisms. In the early stages of mucosal inflammation,
  local T cells become activated and express CD40L, binding to and activating CD40+
  mesenchymal (HIF) and endothelial (HIMEC) cells. HIF and HIMEC start secreting chemokines
  that attract more T cells that transmigrate into the interstitial space, become
  activated, and express CD40L, initiating a new cycle of chemokine secretion by non-immune
  cells which results in additional T cell recruitment. Activated T cells and platelets
  in the circulation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients contribute to this
  process through expression of CD40L on their surface. This framework supports the
  notion of a non-immune, cell mediated, antigen independent mechanism perpetuating
  IBD.
