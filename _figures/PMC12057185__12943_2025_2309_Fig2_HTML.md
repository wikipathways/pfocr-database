caption: 'Processes of the three major classes for protein lipidation. a N-myristoylation
  is a co-translational lipid modification involving the irreversible covalent attachment
  of a myristoyl group (a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid derived from myristoyl-CoA)
  onto the N-terminal glycine residue of target proteins. During translation, the
  initiator methionine is typically removed by Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2),
  exposing a glycine suitable for lipidation. This reaction is catalyzed by two closely
  related enzymes, N-myristoyltransferase 1 and 2 (NMT1/2), which display high catalytic
  efficiency (k_cat/K_M ~ 1.33 × 10^4 M⁻1 s⁻1), depending on the substrate peptide
  sequence context. Mechanistically, upon substrate binding, NMT1/2 enzymes undergo
  conformational transitions from an open, ligand-free state to a closed, catalytically
  competent state, precisely aligning peptide substrates and myristoyl-CoA for effective
  acyl transfer. The resultant irreversible lipid modification ensures stable membrane
  anchoring, thereby critically regulating protein trafficking, localization, and
  signaling pathways. b S-palmitoylation is a reversible, post-translational modification
  that typically occurs at the Golgi apparatus through a two-step enzymatic process.
  Initially, zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs) undergo auto-palmitoylation,
  covalently attaching a 16-carbon palmitate derived from palmitoyl-CoA to their own
  cysteine residue. Subsequently, this palmitate moiety is transferred onto specific
  cysteine residues of substrate proteins. ZDHHC family members, such as ZDHHC20,
  exhibit high catalytic efficiency (k_cat/K_M ~ 1.13 × 10^5 M⁻1 s⁻1), facilitating
  rapid and selective protein S-palmitoylation. S-palmitoylated proteins typically
  display an enhanced affinity for plasma membrane localization, particularly within
  lipid rafts, influencing their trafficking, membrane partitioning, and downstream
  signaling dynamics. The reversible nature of this modification is mediated by depalmitoylation
  enzymes, predominantly acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) and α/β hydrolase domain-containing
  proteins (ABHDs). These enzymes remove the palmitoyl group, enabling dynamic and
  reversible cycling of substrate proteins between intracellular compartments and
  the plasma membrane, thus fine-tuning protein function in response to cellular cues.
  c S-prenylation is a form of irreversible lipid modification initiated by the enzymatic
  attachment of either a farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoid
  lipid group to cysteine residues located within the conserved C-terminal CAAX motif
  (where C is cysteine, A an aliphatic amino acid, X determines prenylation specificity).
  Farnesyltransferase (FTase, catalytic efficiency k_cat/K_M ~ 1.8 × 10^5 M⁻1 s⁻1)
  and geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) catalyze these reactions, utilizing prenyl
  donors derived from intermediates of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively. Prenylation markedly
  increases protein hydrophobicity, facilitating initial association with the cytosolic
  leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequent post-prenylation modifications
  occur at the ER membrane, involving two sequential enzymatic steps to further enhance
  membrane affinity: Ras-converting enzyme 1 (Rce1) cleaves off the terminal -AAX
  amino acid residues. Isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) then carboxymethylates
  the newly exposed C-terminal prenylcysteine residue. Different prenylated proteins
  exhibit distinct membrane-targeting strategies. NRAS and HRAS undergo additional
  S-palmitoylation by ZDHHC, which stabilizes their plasma membrane association within
  lipid rafts. In contrast, KRAS4B membrane localization primarily depends on electrostatic
  interactions facilitated by Phosphodiesterase δ (PDEδ) shuttle proteins. Meanwhile,
  prenylated small GTPases of the Rho and Rab families initially bind to guanine nucleotide
  dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) in the cytosol, before their transfer to the plasma
  membrane, regulating membrane cycling and signaling dynamics. ABHD: α/β-Hydrolase
