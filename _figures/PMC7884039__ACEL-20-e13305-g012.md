caption: The molecular mechanism of p75NTR in regulating age‐associated changes in
  the homeostatic of synaptic plasticity. This cartoon depicts the signaling pathway
  by p75NTR in mediating synaptic plasticity changes in aging. Aging increases proBDNF
  without affecting mature BDNF. ProBDNF has been implicated in facilitating LTD.
  Aging also modulates MAPK pathway by upregulating p38 activity while downregulating
  ERK1/2 activity. Both p38 and ERK1/2 pathways are important in regulating Arc gene
  transcription. Aging decreases Arc protein and thus, affecting the maintenance of
  LTP and LTM consolidation through regulation of actin dynamics. In addition, aging
  increases RhoA level leading to an increase in ROCK2 activity. This reduces both
  LIMK1 and cofilin phosphorylation. Modulation of cofilin activity is essential for
  the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and influences synaptic plasticity.
  As a whole, p75NTR responsible for the age‐mediated disruption of hippocampal homeostatic
  long‐term plasticity by modulating several signaling pathways, including BDNF, MAPK,
  Arc, and RhoA‐ROCK2‐LIMK1‐cofilin, leading to deficits in STC and associative memory.
