caption: Wnt/β-catenin pathways in obesity pathogenesis. In the canonical Wnt pathway,
  upon activation by Wnt proteins, β-catenin is released and enters the nucleus as
  a transcription coactivator of TCF to regulate the transcription of target genes.
  The activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to, (1) the supersession of adipogenesis
  by down-regulating the expression of PPARγ, C1EBPα, Add1, APM, etc.; (2) the inhibition
  of BAT-related thermogenesis by down-regulating UCP-1; and (3) the increase of insulin
  sensitivity by down-regulating GSK3β expression in CNS while up-regulating incretins
  within the small intestinal epithelium. The canonical Wnt signaling can be stimulated
  by factors including leptin, OSBPL2, and miRNAs like miR-23b, miR-148b miR-4269,
  and miR-4429. It can also be inhibited by JAK/STAT3 pathway, CXXC5, and NOTUM. These
  factors are all involved in the pathogenesis of obesity by regulating Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. Additionally, Wnt5a, a part of the non-canonical Wnt pathway,
  induces obesity-associated inflammation in WAT in a JNK-dependent manner, which
  further contributes to the occurrence of insulin resistance in adipose tissue
