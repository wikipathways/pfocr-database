caption: IL-6 mediated drug resistance in RCC cells. Following anti-RCC drug stimulation,
  IL-6 is secreted by RCC cells. It then binds IL-6 receptor and results in activation
  of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to the transcription of STAT3 target
  genes, i.e. VEGF or SOCS3. SOCS3 suppresses STAT1 activation. STAT3 and NF-κB interact
  at multiple levels, and promote inflammation, increasing tumor cell proliferation
  and survival as well as tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. IL-6 can also activate
  the AKT/mTOR pathways.
