caption: Deregulation of TRPC6-involved signalling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma
  metastasis and drug resistance. Schema of key actors involved in the retrograde
  signalling pathway from mitochondria to nucleus that promote HCC metastasis and
  drug resistance. TGFβ can stimulate the activation of the TRPC6/NCX1 complex to
  increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. At the same time, TGFβ ligands activate their
  receptor complexes. Both Ca2+ concentration increase and TGFβ receptor activation
  stimulate the phosphorylation of Smad2, leading to the transcriptional upregulation
  of EMT-related genes that promote HCC metastasis, and of NCX1 and TRPC6 that create
  a positive feedback loop. The TRPC6-mediated high level of cytosolic Ca2+ can also
  induce the phosphorylation of STAT3, thus stimulating Twist/HIF-1α/H2A.X-related
  MDR mechanisms. Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed on 20 January 2022).
