caption: General tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling pathway of TNFR1 and
  TNFR2. The TNFR1 signaling pathway is activated by the ligation of sTNF-α and tmTNF-α,
  and the death domain of TNFR1 recruits TRADD. Complex I activates NF-κB and MAPKs,
  which results in inflammation, tissue degeneration, host defense, cell proliferation,
  and cell survival. Complexes IIa and IIb activate caspase-8 and induce apoptosis.
  Complex IIc is known to induce necroptosis and inflammation via the activation of
  MLKL. The TNFR2 signaling pathway is mainly activated by tmTNF-α. TNFR2 does not
  possess a death domain and recruits TRAF via its TRAF domain, which activates the
  formation of complex I, resulting in NF-κB and MAPKs and AKT activation. TNFR2 activation
  is associated with homeostatic bioactivities such as tissue regeneration, cell proliferation,
  and cell survival, as well as host defense and inflammation.
