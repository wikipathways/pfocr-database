  expressed (DE) genes between Muc1−/− vs. wild type gastric tissues at 8 h H. pylori
  infection showed PPARG up-regulated transport of molecule pathway. Log ratio fold
  changes of DE genes is shown underneath each gene (red color symbol indicates increased
  expression). Prediction legend is the same as for .
