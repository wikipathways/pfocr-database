caption: Model for p53-mediated resolution of replication barriers. When encountering
  replication barriers, the replication machinery stops, triggering PCNA monoubiquitination
  (U) and recruitment of p53, which is followed by POLι. The p53–POLι complexes favor
  continued idling, leading to polyubiquitination of PCNA (chain of U’s) via HLTF;
  subsequently, to error-free resolution/bypass via HLTF and ZRANB3; and, finally,
  to replication restart. Current models of the ZRANB3-mediated DNA damage tolerance
  pathway (, ) suggest that the structure-specific endonuclease of ZRANB3 introduces
  a nick into the unreplicated template strand ahead of the fork, which serves as
  a primer end for displacement DNA synthesis (green arrow). Concomitantly, ZRANB3,
  together with HLTF, promotes fork reversal. As a result, the replication-blocking
  lesion is replaced by a patch of newly synthesized DNA (green line), thus permitting
  unrestricted progression of the restarted fork. Persistent replication stress can
  alternatively lead to MRE11-dependent ssDNA formation, which is coated by RPA.
