caption: 'Intracellular effects of estrogen are exerted through two main pathways,
  genomic and non-genomic. Interaction of the estrogen receptor and ligand with DNA,
  through estrogen response elements (ERE) or other transcription factors such as
  C-Fos/C-Jun/AP1, results in transcriptional alteration of genes and is the main
  genomic mechanism of estrogen in cells. The genomic effects can also be achieved
  from interactions of the receptor, without the ligand, through ligand independent
  pathways, where ERs are phosphorelayted through activated kinase pathway.The non-genomic
  effects are achieved through several intracellular pathways, including protein kinase
  C (PKC), Intracellular ca++, Cytosolic CAMP, Nitric oxide, and MAPK.Abbreviations:
  ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen receptor element; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; NFkB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chaine-enhancer
  of activated B-cells; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase; TF, transcription factor.'
