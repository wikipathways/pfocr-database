caption: Schematic representation of the VEGF signaling pathway. VEGF-A binds to the
  tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR), which are present
  on the endothelial surface of blood vessels. This leads to the activation of several
  signaling pathways, including PL-Cγ, PI3K, Akt, Ras, Src, and MAPKs. The phosphorylation
  of PL-Cγ triggers the release of Ca2+ and PKC, which further activates the Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathway, promoting cell proliferation. Additionally, VEGF-A-induced signaling enhances
  cell proliferation and increases vascular permeability by activating eNOS. Src activation
  also stimulates p38 MAPK activity, which enhances the migration and motility of
  endothelial cells.
