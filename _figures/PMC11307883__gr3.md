caption: Metabolic pathways of the microRNAs and their target genes. (A) Alanine,
  aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway with the role of microRNA 650 target
  genes, GFPT2 and ALDH4A1, which were downregulated in mesenteric adipose tissue
  (MAT) in Crohn's disease (CD). (B) Cancer-related metabolic pathway with the role
  of microRNA 29c target gene, E2F1, which was downregulated in mesenteric adipose
  tissue (MAT) in Crohn's disease (CD).
