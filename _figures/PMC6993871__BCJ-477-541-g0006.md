caption: The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway contains over 20 enzymes and multiple
  branch points have been suggested between the Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell pathway.
  MARCH6 targets are indicated in purple, and enzymes that are not MARCH6 targets
  in grey, with discoveries from this paper outlined in red.
