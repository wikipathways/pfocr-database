caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the protective effects of TFDM against H2O2-induced
  astrocyte apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. Proposed protective
  mechanisms of TFDM against H2O2 injury via CaMKII-dependent mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in astrocytes. H2O2 induces an increase
  in [Ca2+], and H2O2 exposure induces an increase in ROS levels, which might contribute
  to an elevation of the resting [Ca2+], possibly leading to neurotoxicity in the
  hippocampus. TFDM relieves CaMKII-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, including
  the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3/9 and the activation of p38MAPK and
  ERK1/2, following cellular H2O2 injury
