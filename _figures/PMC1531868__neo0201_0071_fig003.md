caption: 'Four-factor model of thymidine utilization (adapted from Ref. []). The chemical
  species entering and leaving the precursor pool are shown. Abbreviations in parentheses
  refer to enzymes at control points in the model: TS: thymidylate synthetase; TP:
  thymidine phosphorylase; TK: thymidine kinase. The line following the exogenous
  pathway into DNA indicates exogenous thymidine flux measured by labeled thymidine.'
