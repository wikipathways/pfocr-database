caption: Gene-Silencing Mechanism(A) Modulation of HIV replication. LysUUU 3′tsRNA
  binds to the HIV-1 primer-binding site (PBS) associated with the Ago2 protein. (B)
  Modulation of DNA damage response is shown. GlyGCC 3′tsRNA modulates the molecular
  response to DNA damage by repressing endogenous RPA1. (C) Suppression of Notch signaling
  and tumorigenesis is shown. LeuAAG 3′tsRNA (tRF/miR-1280 fragment) binds to the
  JAG2 mRNA 3′ UTR and induces its degradation, which inhibits the activation of the
  Notch pathway in colorectal cancer cells. (D) Trans-gene silencing of 5′ tRNA halves
  is shown. 5′GluCUC tRNA halves recognize the 3′ UTR of apolipoprotein E receptor
  2 (APOER2) mRNA and suppresses its expression.
