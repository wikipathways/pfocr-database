caption: 'Red crosses display domains or entire proteins that are present in vertebrates,
  but have been lost from flatworms, including RIOK-3. The top part of the figure
  displays gene loss in a simplified representation of the tumour necrosis factor
  (TNF) pathway. The tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1) is conserved among
  flatworms, but lacks death domains (DDs) that interact with the signalling molecules:
  tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD), Fas-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK).
  The downstream caspase-10 enzyme activates apoptosis through a catalytic reaction
  with other caspases (including caspase-3), and activates growth and differentiation
  by interacting with NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) through its Death Effector Domains
  (DEDs) via the NF-κB pathway. The bottom part of the figure illustrates the presence
  of the premature small subunit (SSU, 18S or pre-40S) of nuclear ribosomal RNA and
  ribosomal proteins as well as the SSU associating proteins (LTV-1, EMP-1, TSR-1,
  RIOK-2, RIOK-3, DIM-1, PNO-1 and NOB-1) that associate with SSU (pre-40S) in the
  cytoplasm.'
