caption: 'Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by cytochrome P450scc inside steroidogenic
  mitochondria. The transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membranes is
  a limiting step, and it involves the transport protein (TSPO). Ligands of TSPO can
  stimulate the passage of cholesterol into the mitochondria and, as a consequence,
  the synthesis of pregnenolone. The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by
  different isoforms of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) also takes place
  inside the mitochondria or within the cytoplasm.Notes: Progesterone regulates gene
  transcription by binding to intracellular receptors (PR), which interact as dimers
  with DNA progesterone-response elements (PREs). In addition, PR can also directly
  interact with extranuclear signaling proteins of the Src/Ras/Erk pathway. At the
  level of the plasma membrane, progesterone binds to the recently identified membrane
  receptors of progesterone (mPR, comprising a, b, and g isoforms), progesterone receptor
  membrane component 1 (PGRMC1, the former protein 25Dx) and the s1 receptor. Major
  signal transduction pathways which have been shown to be activated by the mPRs are
  ERK and p38. The mPRs also inhibit adenylate cyclase (AC), and as a consequence
  the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, and they stimulate Ca2+ release from internal
  stores. Likewise, PGRMC1 and s1 receptors increase intracellular Ca2+ release. Both
  receptors are also located on membranes inside the cytoplasm, but they may translocate
  from them to the plasma membrane. In addition, PGRMC1 has been shown to activate
  protein kinase G (PKG), and s1 receptors function as amplifiers of ion channels
  (eg, voltage-gated K+ channels). Progesterone also activates γ-aminobutyric acid
  type A (GABAA) receptors via its metabolite allopregnanolone. Copyright © 2008,
