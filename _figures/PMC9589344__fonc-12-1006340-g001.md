caption: 'Signaling pathways that associate with ALDHs directly.① RA signaling pathway:
  ALDHs oxidize retinal to generate RA. Meanwhile, the transcription of ALDH is also
  regulated by RA. As a feedback loop, increased levels of ALDH promote the synthesis
  of RA; ② and ③ PI3K/AKT pathway and WNT signaling pathway regulate the transcription
  of ALDH through β-catenin; ④ TGF-β signaling pathway: TGF-β inhibits the transcription
  of ALDH through Smad4; ⑤ MUCI-C pathway: The protein complex of MUC1-C and C/EBPβ
  binds to the promoter of ALDH and promotes its transcription; ⑥ NOTCH/DLL4 pathway:
  Notch signaling promotes ALDH activity by inducing SIRT2 and triggering ALDH1A1
  deacetylation. The regulators in red refer to those promoting PCSCs, and the regulators
  in green refer to those inhibiting PCSCs. This figure is generated by BioRender
  with an agreement number of QR24HA6NER.'
