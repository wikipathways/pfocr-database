caption: Dimerization of ErbB2 receptors leads to phosphorylation and activation of
  several intracellular catalytic substrates, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk, PI3K/Akt
  and other important signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis, protein synthesis
  and cellular proliferation. Our experimental results summarized in this Extra View,
  demonstrate that ErbB2 signaling activates a Rac-Pak signaling pathway that contributes
  to ErbB2 mediated transformation through the Erk and Akt pathways.
