caption: Intermediates of TCA measured in the plasma of hypogonadal patients, revealing
  that this metabolic pathway was strongly reduced. Metabolite levels are expressed
  as the mean ± SD (n = 15) of the fold change in the metabolite concentration over
  hypogonadal plasma. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 against hypogonadal men
