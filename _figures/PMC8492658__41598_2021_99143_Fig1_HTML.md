caption: 'The myocardium reacts to MetS with altered expression of genes and content
  of metabolites associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. RNA-seq, proteomics
  and targeted polar metabolites LC/MS–MS were applied to identify and compare contents
  of gene products and metabolites that change in response to diet. Myocardial mRNA,
  proteomic, and targeted polar metabolites libraries from LD (n = 4) pigs and MetS
  (n = 4) pigs were compared for relative content of genes and metabolites that change
  expression in response to diet. Metabolites availability is compared in tissue and
  in blood (a) Proinflammatory factors from the arachidonic acid pathway that are
  significantly altered in response to diet are gated in blue: COX1, COX2, prostaglandin
  E synthase 2 (PTGES2), prostaglandin E2 receptor (PTGER2), thromboxane synthase
  1 (TBXAS1), phospholipase A2 (PL2G4A), phospholipase C Beta 4 (PLCB4), and prostacyclin
  synthase (PTGIS). All factors are compared at the RNA level. PTGES2 is compared
  at both the protein and RNA levels. The oxidative stress related xanthine dehydrogenase,
  (XDH2/XO) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) are in yellow. The RNA and protein content
  of the myocardial inflammation marker myocardial troponin 2 (TNNT2) is in pink.
  The individual factors are shown at the top of the diagrams. Values in relative
  units (R.U.) are mean ± SD, p ≤ 0.050, p > 0.050; LD n = 4, MetS n = 4; 2-tailed
  Student’s t-test. (b) The XDH2/XO related metabolites hypoxanthine and uric acid
  are gated in gray: uric acid content in the myocardial tissue (p = 0.029), in the
  corresponding blood sample (p = 0.431); hypoxanthine in tissue (p = 0.039) and in
  blood (p = 0.792) as shown below the bars. Oxaloacetate (LD, p = 0.778; MetS p = 0.914)
  content did not significantly alter in tissue and blood and was used as a control
  for the equal loading of metabolites. Values in relative units (R.U.) are mean ± SD,
  p ≤ 0.050, p > 0.050.; 2-tailed Student’s t-test (c) The Arachidonic acid pathway
  diagram shows the enzymes (black) that respond to diet. The single black up-arrows
  show upregulated enzymes and the down-arrows downregulated enzymes. The enzyme’s
  products are shown in red: prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin
  (PGI2), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). The effect of altered arachidonic pathway activity
  is shown at the bottom of the diagram: inflammation and pro-thrombotic platelet
  activity in the endothelium.'
