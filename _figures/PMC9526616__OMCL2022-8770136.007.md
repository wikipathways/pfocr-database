caption: Effect of older paternal age at conception on the exacerbation of cardiac
  remodeling and development of myocardial fibrosis in the young rat progeny, through
  activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, particularly in the case of chronic circulatory
  stress. The early development of cardiac remodeling associated with paternal age
  in the young progeny appears to be transmitted intergenerationally. Clinically,
  the early onset of heart failure in young hypertensive offspring may be correlated
  with advanced paternal age during conception.
