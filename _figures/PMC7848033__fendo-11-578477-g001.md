caption: Role of Osteocytes in Modifying Bone Matrix Properties. (A) Mechanical loading
  and wearing are known to increased bone formation, and osteocytes are known to play
  a critical role in each. While a definite pathway leading to bone formation by osteocytes
  remains to be discovered, a small amount of bone formation by osteocytes could have
  a profound effect on bone material properties. (B) Perilacunar remodeling by osteocytes
  occurs in response to unloading and lactation, processes in which PTH is a major
  player. This results in decreased pH in the perilacunar space and increased expression
  of collagenolytic enzymes. Figure created with BioRender.com.
