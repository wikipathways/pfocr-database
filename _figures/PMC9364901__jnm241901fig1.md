caption: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway containing RAS and BRAF. MEK is found
  in receptor tyrosine kinase pathway downstream of both KRAS and BRAF. Trametinib
  is MEK1/2 inhibitor and Food and Drug Administration–approved for BRAFV600E mutant
  cancers. By inhibiting MEK activity, trametinib can reduce hyperproliferative signaling
  from KRAS or BRAF mutants, though on-target toxicity is observed even with wild-type
  KRAS and BRAF cells.
