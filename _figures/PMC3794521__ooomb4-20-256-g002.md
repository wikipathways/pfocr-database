caption: Metabolic activation of tamoxifen. Phase I metabolism of tamoxifen produces
  phenolic metabolites that have a high bindingaffinity for the ER and thus exerts
  potent antiestrogenic activity. Metabolic pathways mainly include cytochrome P450
  3A4/5 and 2D6. Further oxidative metabolism may contribute to formation of reactive
  intermediates such as quinone methides. The thickness of each arrow indicates the
  relative contribution of the respective pathway to the formation of a specific metabolite.
  The principal metabolizingenzymes responsible for biotransformation are indicated
  next to the arrow.
