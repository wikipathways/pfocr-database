caption: Mechanistic model for the zir antivirulence pathway. Schematic representation
  of the structural and biochemical data presented in –. Proteins are represented
  by colored ellipse and labeled by structural domain. The zir operon and surrounding
  genes are represented by a block arrow at the bottom of the figure. ZirRTSU are
  expressed during shedding and infection of the host gastrointestinal tract to regulate
  Salmonella growth. ZirT (orange) secretes both ZirS (blue) and ZirU (green), which
  are released into the extracellular space and can self-associate. ZirT maintains
  an equlibrium in the outer membrane, forming an Ig-rich adhesion surface for ZirS
  and ZirU. Upon the build up of enough ZirT, ZirS, and ZirU from infecting Salmonella
  a regulatory signal is engaged. This event may involve unknown protein targets (light
  brown) from Salmonella or the host that interact with the ZirS N-terminal domain
  or ZirU. Expression of the zir genes is negatively regulated by OxyR and zinc and
  may involve the thioredoxin protein ZirR (red). The adjacent genes STM1666, STM1665,
  and STM1671 encode predicted redox pathway proteins (see text) making them candidates
  for the cytoplasmic signaling events of the zir pathway.
