caption: Metabolism of a cell infected by HCMV. A cell infected by HCMV has its metabolism
  heavily modified. Glucose importation is up-regulated due to up-regulation in the
  expression of GLUT-4. Glucose imported is converted to pyruvate, which can be oxidised
  to lactate for the generation of two molecules of ATP. Some of the pyruvate can
  be imported in the mitochondria and converted to citrate and instead of being used
  in the TCA is rapidly shuttled out where it is employed for fatty acid biosynthesis.
  Glutamine importation is required in order to support the TCA cycle through anaplerosis,
  which is vital to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential. If the mitochondrial
  membrane potential is lost, cytochromes get released in the cytosol and caspases
  are activated leading to apoptosis. The arachidonic pathway is also up-regulated,
  and there is increased release of arachidonic acid from membranes by lipases, which
  COX-2 converts to PGH2 a precursor for prostanoids. Repression arrows indicate specific
  drug inhibitors. TLR Toll-like receptor, IFN interferon, GLUT glucose transporter,
  TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle, HK-II hexokinase-II, Akt protein kinase B, NO
  nitric oxide, NSAIDS non-steroidal anti-inflammatory inhibitory drugs, PPP pentose
  phosphate pathway
