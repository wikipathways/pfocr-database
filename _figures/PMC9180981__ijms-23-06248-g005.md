caption: 'Integrated pathway of starch and sucrose metabolic process, glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, and respiratory chain pathway based on DEGs and DAPs identified in flower
  buds of B. juncea. (A) DEGs and DAPs involved in the integrated pathway in 09-05A/B
  lines at the TE stage. (B) DEGs and DAPs involved in the integrated pathway in 09-05A/B
  lines at the BI stage. DEGs and DAPs involved in these pathways in 09-05A were compared
  with those in 09-05B at the TE and BI stages, respectively. Red circle, blue circle,
  red square, and blue square indicate upregulated gene, downregulated gene, increased
  protein, and decreased protein, respectively. Abbreviations are as follows: ACO—aconitase;
  ADPG—adenosine diphosphate glucose; AGPase—ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; CA—citric
  acid; CS—citrate synthase; F-1-6-Bisp—Fructose-1-6-bisphosphate;—; F-6-P—fructose-6-phosphate;
  GAPD—glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; G-1-P—glucose-1-phosphate; G3P—glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; G-6-P—glucose-6-phosphate; GPI—glucose-phosphate isomerase; HK—hexokinase;
  IDH—isocitrate dehydrogenase; MDH—malate dehydrogenase; PA—pyruvic acid; PDH—pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PEP—phosphoenolpyruvate; PGK—phosphofructokinase; PK—pyruvate kinase;
  SDH—succinate dehydrogenase; SPPase—sucrose phosphate phosphatase; SS—starch synthase;
  Suc-6-P—sucrose-6-phosphate; SUS—sucrose synthase; Susy—succinyl-CoA synthases;
  UDPG—uridine diphosphate glucose; UGPase—UDP-glucosepyro phosphosphprylase.'
