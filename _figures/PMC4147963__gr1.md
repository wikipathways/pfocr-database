caption: Mechanisms of natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC). NK cells directly
  eliminate transformed cells through one of two contact-dependent mechanisms. (A)
  The granule exocytosis pathway. Following target cell recognition and activation,
  NK cells secrete an array of lytic effector molecules into the immunological synapse.
  These molecules include the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of serine
  proteases termed granzymes. Binding of these proteins to the target cell surface
  triggers their uptake into endosomes, which are subsequently lysed by perforin,
  resulting in the release of apoptosis-inducing granzymes into the cytoplasm ().
  Shown in the figure are the 3 pathways by which granzyme B mediates target cell
  death. (1) As an aspase, granzyme B cleaves and directly activates effector caspases
  (e.g. caspases 3 and 7), which subsequently induce target cell apoptosis by degrading
  proteins involved in DNA repair (e.g. poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)) and activating
  the endonuclease caspase-activated DNase (CAD) by degrading its inhibitory binding
  partner, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (iCAD). (2) As well as activating
  caspases 3 and 7 directly, granzyme B can indirectly activate these proteases by
  cleaving the BH-3 family protein BH3-interacting domain (BID) death agonist into
  its truncated form (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, where it induces
  permeabilisation, leading to the release of cytochrome c. The presence of cytochrome
  c along with other pro-apoptotic proteins in the target cell cytosol results in
  the activation of the initiator caspase, caspase 9, which mediates cell death by
  cleaving and activating caspases 3 and 7. (3) In addition to inducing caspase-dependent
  target cell death, granzyme B can trigger caspase-independent cell death by directly
  cleaving proteins involved in DNA repair and maintenance. These proteins include
  PARP, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (iCAD) and the nuclear protein lamin
  B. (B) Death receptor ligation. Activated NK cells express on their surface Fas
  ligand (FASL) and TNF-related apoptotic inducing ligand (TRAIL), which bind their
  cognate receptors, Fas and TRAIL-R respectively on the target cell surface. Ligand
  binding leads to receptor oligomerisation and the recruitment of the cytosolic adaptor
  protein Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) along with the initiator
  caspases, pro-caspase 8 and 10 to the target cell membrane. Formation of this complex,
  referred to as the death-induced signalling complex (DISC), triggers the activation
  of caspases 8 and 10, which subsequently induce apoptosis by activating caspase
  3 either directly via cleavage or indirectly by generating tBID, which leads to
  cell death by driving mitochondrial permeabilisation, cytochrome c release and caspase
  3 activation.
