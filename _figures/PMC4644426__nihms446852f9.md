caption: Syncytin-1 alterations triggered placental trophoblast cell cycle changes.
  The left side illustrates the nonfusogenic pathway of interest in the current study.
  Increased syncytin-1 expression, through downregultion of p15 and upregulation of
  CDK4, promotes the G1/S transition, resulting in augmented DNA synthesis and cytotropoblast
  proliferation. Via the nonfusogenic pathway, syncytin-1 plays a role in the regulation
  of “input” to the cytotrophoblast “pool”. The fusogenic function of syncytin-1 is
  illustrated on the right. Syncytin-1 has been known to mediate cytotrophoblast fusion
  into syncytiotrophoblast, thereby regulating “output” of the cytotrophoblast “pool”.
  We hypothesize that co-regulation of these two opposing processes by syncytin-1
  may serve as an efficient mechanism to achieve an optimal balance of the cytotrophoblast
  “pool”, which ensures syncytium homeostasis and normal placental functions during
  pregnancy.
