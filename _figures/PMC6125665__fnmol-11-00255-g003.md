caption: CREB as an integrative signaling molecule involved in schizophrenia. Dopamine
  stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB through D1R-mediated cAMP/PKA pathway or
  inhibits it through the D2R-mediated cAMP/PKA pathway. The CREB may also affect
  neurotrophins (BDNF) and other protein expressions and susceptibility genes associated
  with schizophrenia. The GWAS indicated that gene sets related to calcium channels,
  activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein, FMRP, PSD-95, NMDA
  receptor, and synaptic proteins were potential candidates altered in the schizophrenic
  patients. The CREB-induced dysregulation in neuronal signaling may lead to neurodevelopmental
  deficits followed by schizophrenic behavior.
