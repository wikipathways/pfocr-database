caption: Upon activation, sphingosine kinase (SPHK1) synthesizes S1P from sphingosine
  (SPH). S1P is transported through the transporter, SPNS2, and ligates S1PR1, S1PR2
  or S1PR3. S1PR1 stimulates Gi which in turn induces a barrier protective signaling
  including Ca2+ mobilization and PI3-kinase activity leading to activation of small
  GTPase Rac1. Rac1 anneals adherens junctions enhancing barrier function. S1P also
  ligates S1PR2 and S1PR3, which in contrast to S1PR1, induces G12/13 activity. Activated
  G12/G13 stimulates Rho and ROCK signaling which destabilize adherens junctions in
  part by counteracting Rac1 activity through Rac1GTPase (Rac1GAP) hence disrupting
  barrier function. S1PR3 interacts with Gq leading to induction of Ca2+signaling
  pathway that in addition to inducing Rho/ROCK pathway activates endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase (e-NOS). eNOS leads to NO generation which disrupts adherens junctions
  by nitosylating p190RhoGAP, a GTPase that blocks RhoA activity.
