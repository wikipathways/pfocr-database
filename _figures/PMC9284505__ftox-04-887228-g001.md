caption: Proposed scenario in silica-induced lung acute inflammation. The classical
  mechanism explaining particle-induced inflammation is based on the recognition of
  silica particles by PRR receptors (SR) expressed on the surface of naïve alveolar
  macrophages. This sensing activates the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1, which
  induce the expression, production, and release of several proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL10). These molecules
  orchestrate a proinflammatory environment, characterized by the influx of additional
  immune cells. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) also participates in the development
  of inflammation, and represents an additional pathway characterized by silica engulfment,
  ROS generation, lysosome destabilization, and macrophage hyper-activation. This
  process results in the continuous release of self-DAMPs (mature IL-1, alarmins,
  DNA) and contributes to the inflammatory response to silica. Besides necrotic ICD,
  silica also induces apoptosis. This cell death modality progresses to proinflammatory
  secondary necrosis if apoptotic macrophages are not efficiently removed by phagocytic
  cells during efferocytosis, which can be impaired by silica particles.
