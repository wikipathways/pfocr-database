caption: 'A schematic diagram summarizing factors influencing the signaling efficacy
  of the TLR2/1-VDR pathway in response to TLR2/1 elicitation. Pam3CSK4 (Pam3CysSerLys4),
  a synthetic tripalmitoylated lipopeptide, mimics the acylated amino terminus of
  bacterial lipoproteins and is recognized by TLR2, cooperating with TLR1 to induce
  signaling that activates the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, inducing
  CYP27B1 and VDR. Factors found to influence VDR expression are indicated in red.
  UVI correlated with 25(OH)D3, known to autoregulate VDR. Individuals who responded
  with an above average level of VDR protein upon TLR2/1 elicitation were hypermethylated
  at CGI 1066 (CpG 1 and 3) and CGI 1062 (CpG 3), while hypomethylated at CGI 1061
  (CpG 9) and CGI 1060 (CpG 1–4). With in vitro 1,25(OH)2D3 supplementation CGI 1062
  CpG 3 was slightly less discriminatory upon TLR2/1 elicitation, but remained a significant
  variable to discriminate above/below average VDR protein level. However, with supplementation
  the population clustered by race and all genetic variants indicated (TLR1 SNP I602S,
  TIRAP SNP S180L, and VDR SNPs BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI, see Table ), compared to clustering
  by vitamin D status and TaqI alone, without supplementation. Methylation at CpG
  6 of CGI 1060 (dictated by TaqI, with which it overlaps) together with UVI and circulating
  25(OH)D3, significantly discriminated a 1.2-1.5-fold change in VDR mRNA with supplement
