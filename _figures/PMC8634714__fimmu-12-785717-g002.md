caption: Diagram shows the main mechanism of intrauterine adhesions, the damaged endometrium
  is affected by long-term antibiotic treatment, frequent sexual intercourse, vaginal
  flushing, decreased estrogen and other factors, which lead to the homeostasis of
  the internal environment changing. Broken rings in the microenvironment make bacteria
  easier to invade, and the damaged endometrium has an inflammatory response. On the
  one hand, it can release inflammatory cytokines IL-25, IL-33, TSLP, activate helper
  Th2 cells, and promote endometrial fibrosis. On the other hand, it can also release
  inflammatory cytokines TGF-β, IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, etc. Among them, TGF-β can be
  through TGF-β-Smad5 pathway, and TNF-α and NF-κB jointly promote endometrial fibrosis,
  thereby forming intrauterine adhesions.
