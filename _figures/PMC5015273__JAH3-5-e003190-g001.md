caption: Proposed model for plasma long‐chain acylcarnitine contributions to the heart
  failure phenotype. Long‐chain acylcarnitines accumulate in tissues and plasma in
  states of inefficient ß‐oxidation. Such accumulation causes electrophysiological
  disturbances, cell stress, and release of circulating inflammatory mediators., ,
  , , ,  These may, in turn, activate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein kinase
  G pathway, previously implicated in the genesis of ventricular fibrosis and hypertrophy
  as well as vascular stiffness and impaired vasodilation.,  Through these mechanisms,
  long‐chain acylcarnitines may contribute to the heart failure phenotype. Ca++ indicates
  calcium; CMC, cardiomyocyte; COX, cyclooxygenase; IL, interleukin; IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate; K, potassium; MAPK, mitogen‐associated protein kinase; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid.
