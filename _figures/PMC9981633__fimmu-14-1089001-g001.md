caption: Roles of MMPs in regulating inflammation-related cross-talks among keratinocytes,
  macrophage, and fibroblast during diabetic wound healing. (AGEs stimulates the activation
  of Notch-1/NICD/NF-κB, RAGE/ERK1/2, and MAPK signaling pathways in keratinocytes,
  which gives rise to the up-regulation of MMP-9. MMP-9 released by keratinocytes
  suppresses the recruitment of EPCs through down-regulating the expression of CXCL-12.
  In addition, TNF-α, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines secretes by M2 macrophage
  elevate TIMP-1 and reduce of MMP-1, resulting in the suppressed migration of keratinocytes.
  Intriguingly, IL-6 also inhibits the migration as well as proliferation of fibroblast
  via promoting the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, while decreasing the levels of
  TIMP-2 through activating IL-6R/p38 pathway.).
