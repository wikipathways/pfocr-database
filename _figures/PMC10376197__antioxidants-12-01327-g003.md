caption: Intracellular pathways activated by redox TRP channels triggering apoptosis
  in cancer cells. (1) TRPC3 stimulates nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor
  of activated T cell 2 (NFATc2) by calcineurin Ca2+-binding subunits (CNB2) signaling,
  and consecutively activates ROS. (2) Calcium entry through TRPA1 inhibited apoptosis
  upon ROS activation. The process involves the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor (Nrf2). The model is valid for breast cancer cells. (3) Temozolomide (TMZ)
  activates ROS, TRPA1, and apoptosis in glioblastoma. The process is related to TMZ
  resistance. (4) Concomitant application of TRPV1 agonists (MRS1477 and capsaicin)
  increased apoptosis and ROS production. (5) Capsazepine, a TRPV1 antagonist, upregulates
  proapoptotic proteins p53 and Bax, which augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The activation
  of TRAIL receptors triggers the ROS–JNK–CHOP pathway. (6) after irradiation (IR),
  TRPM2 promotes apoptosis and G2M cell cycle arrest in leukemia T cells.
