caption: Central role of Pho85 in phosphate regulation of the PHO pathway. (a) When
  present in high levels, external phosphate is imported by the low-affinity phosphate
  carriers Pho87 and Pho90, which raises the intracellular phosphate level. This activates
  the Pho85 complex, which phosphorylates the transcriptional activator Pho4, causing
  its sequestration in the cytosol. As a result, the PHO genes, encoding, for example,
  the secreted phosphatases Pho3 and Pho5, are not expressed. Active Pho85 also phosphorylates
  cyclin Cln3, which aids in progression over start in G1 of the cell cycle. (b) Upon
  intracellular phosphate limitation, inositol pyrophosphate (IP7) levels increase.
  IP7 promotes Pho81-dependent inhibition of the Pho85–cyclin Pho80 complex. This
  inhibition results in dephosphorylation of Pho4, which then migrates to the nucleus
  where it activates transcription of the PHO and VTC genes. Inactivation of the Pho85
  complex also dephosphorylates Cln3, which is then degraded by the proteasome leading
  to cell cycle arrest.
