caption: Single and combinatorial treatments of inhibitors were added to rat OPCs
  upon the addition of T3 and cells were collected 1 day post treatment. (A) Representative
  western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total Erk 1/2, Akt and S6RP expression
  levels. Increased pErk1/2 was observed after 24 h treatment with LY294002, Rapamycin
  or Torin1 (red asterisks). Combined treatment with Rapamycin and LY294002 reduced
  Rapamycin-mediated Erk1/2 activation (green asterisk); in contrast, LY294002 and
  Torin1 increased the Torin1-mediated Erk pathway activation (green asterisk). (B)
  A schematic of the crosstalk between the pathways upon inhibitor treatments. Single
  or multiple drug treatments resulting in inhibited protein kinases (red) or activated
  protein kinases (green) are represented. Increased size of the kinase represents
  an increase in activation (larger circle = dramatic increases) and the thick arrows
  represent a strong feedback mechanism (e.g., arrow from S6K to IRS-1).
