caption: This putative pathway suggests that nilotinib improves mitochondrial function
  through nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB)-dependent signaling in 3xTg-AD astroglia. It
  is hypothesized that nilotinib activates CAMKII as well as a signal cascade resulting
  in degradation of the NF-κB subunit IκB. The NF-κB dimer then translocates from
  the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it binds to a DNA consensus sequence of target
  genes. It is also hypothesized that nilotinib triggers the NF-κB complex (downstream
  target of CAMKII) to move into the mitochondrion, where is thought to interact with
  OXPHOS genes that leads to bioenergetic improvement (ATP, oxygen consumption rate
  (OCR)), as well as an increase in the expression of mitochondrial complex proteins
  subunits (Complexes I, III, IV, and V), cytochrome c oxidase (COX), mitochondrial
  biogenesis (PGC1-α and Nrf2), and mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn1). Findings from our
  current study importantly show that mitochondrial OCR and ATP levels were significantly
  reduced in the presence of the IKK inhibitor (Bay11-7082). This figure was developed
  using the BioRender online software tool.
