caption: SIC is generally thought to be initiated by the activation of the cardiomyocytes
  receptors for LPS (Toll-like receptor, TLR) and cytokines, such as TNF (TNF-R),
  IL-1 (IL-1R) and IL-6 (IL-6R), among others. At the other end of the chain of events,
  the decrease in cardiac contractile force is known to be largely due to the dysregulation
  of intracellular Ca2+ handling (). This includes the dysfunction of LTCC (, ), SERCA
  (, ), SR ryanodine receptors, that together conspire to decrease CaSR and ΔCai.
  Added to the decrease in ΔCai, myofilament dysfunction (, ) contributes to the decrease
  in cardiac contractile force. In contrast, inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange (,
  ) may play a partially compensatory role, by increasing CaSR and ΔCai () in SIC.Little
  is known however, about the signaling pathways that mediate Ca2+ handling dysregulation.
  A number of specific pathways have been incriminated, such as activation of the
  nitric oxide (NO) pathway (), radical oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RONS) stress (),
  increased () or decreased () cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, NO-induced activation
  of cGMP synthesis (), changes in protein expression (, ), etc. However, little specific
  information currently exists. We know that SERCA inhibition may be due to RONS ()
  and/or a decrease in PLB phosphorylation (), and that myofilament desensitization
  is due to cAMP-dependent hyperphosphorylation of troponin I (). Apart from this
  fragmentary information, practically nothing is know about what causes LTCC and
  RyR dysfunction, as well as Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibition.The novel in vitro model
  described here would greatly aid in elucidating these remaining aspects of SIC patho-physiology,
  as well the screening and development of effective drugs.
