caption: A model for transcriptional regulation of RGC differentiation. (A) Loss of
  DLX2-expressing cells in E13 Atoh7 KO supports Dlx1/Dlx2 participation in a regulatory
  pathway downstream of Atoh7, where, along with Brn3b and Isl1, Dlx1/Dlx2 then co-regulates
  the genes required for RGC differentiation and survival. In addition, cross-regulation
  of these factors is observed. Loss of Dlx2, Brn3b or Isl1 individually does not
  affect initial RGC genesis, suggesting that a combination/co-regulation of these
  factors and/or other unidentified factors are responsible for RGC fate specification.
  In later development, loss of Dlx2, Brn3b and Isl1 all result in increased RGC death,
  supporting the requirement of these factors for RGC survival by controlling the
  expression of genes necessary for this process, including transcriptional control
  of Brn3a by DLX2 (Q.Z. and D.D.E., unpublished), ISL1 and BRN3B (), and DLX2-mediated
  regulation of Trkb (). Solid lines, established regulation; broken lines, proposed
  regulation. (B) Atoh7 expression begins at ∼E11, preceding Dlx1/Dlx2 and Brn3b.
  Atoh7 and Dlx1 expression are both downregulated after E16.5, with neither detected
  after P0. Dlx2 and Brn3b expression starts at E11.5 and persists to adulthood.
