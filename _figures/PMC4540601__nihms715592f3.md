caption: Examples of oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways in C. difficile. NADH
  produced during glycolysis and other oxidative pathways is converted back to NAD+
  by a series of reductive pathways. The proline pathway, catalyzed by proline reductase,
  appears to be the favored pathway. When proline is available, the other pathways
  shown are repressed by Rex. Repression by Rex is relieved when the ratio of NAD+
  to NADH indicates the need for increased regeneration of NAD+. Additional repression
  by CcpA and CodY restricts maximal expression of the alternative pathways to conditions
  in which CcpA and CodY are relatively inactive. The bottom three pathways (effectively,
  acetyl-CoA to butyrate) are encoded in a single eight-gene operon. doi:10.1128 /microbiolspec.MBP-0004-2014.f3

  description: Examples of oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways in C. difficile.
    NADH produced during glycolysis and other oxidative pathways is converted back
    to NAD+ by a series of reductive pathways. The proline pathway, catalyzed by proline
    reductase, appears to be the favored pathway. When proline is available, the other
    pathways shown are repressed by Rex. Repression by Rex is relieved when the ratio
    of NAD+ to NADH indicates the need for increased regeneration of NAD+. Additional
    repression by CcpA and CodY restricts maximal expression of the alternative pathways
    to conditions in which CcpA and CodY are relatively inactive. The bottom three
    pathways (effectively, acetyl-CoA to butyrate) are encoded in a single eight-gene
    operon. doi:10.1128 /microbiolspec.MBP-0004-2014.f3
