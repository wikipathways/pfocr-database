caption: 'Gene interaction network. Using 9 of the 12 early response genes detected
  in the responders that were mapped to pathways in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  canonical database, molecular networks were generated. Colored nodes represent genes
  that are part of the 12 early response genes. Red represents increased expression,
  green, decreased expression. Shapes representations: Circles, protein-coding genes;
  diamond, enzyme; square, cytokine; horizontal ovals, transcription regulators; vertical
  oval, transmembrane receptor. A solid line represents a direct interaction whereas
  a dashed line represents an indirect interaction. A line with an arrow denotes activation
  whereas a line with an arrow and a pipe (|) denotes acts on and inhibits respectively.
  A line without an arrow or pipe (|) denotes a protein-protein interaction.'
