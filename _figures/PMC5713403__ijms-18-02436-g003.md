caption: CDPKs involve ABA-induced stomata movements and phosphorylate ABFs. CDPKs
  participate in ABA signal transduction by affecting the activity of ABA-responsive
  element-binding factors/proteins (ABFs) and are involved in ABA-dependent stomata
  movement. Many CDPKs in Arabidopsis have been found to phosphorylate ABFs in vitro,
  but evidence in vivo is lacking. CDPKs phosphorylate K+ channel (AtTPK1) and anion
  channels (SLAC1 and SLAH3), triggering the release of K+ and anions from guard cells,
  resulting in stomatal closure. Some phosphorylate two inward K+ channels (AtKAT1
  and AtKAT2) and inhibit their activity, leading to stomatal opening. PYR/PYL/RCAR–PP2Cs–SnRK2s
  is the core signaling pathway of ABA from ABA perception to ABA-regulated gene expression.
  The dashed lines represent that there is only evidence in vitro. Arrows indicate
  promotion, and T bars indicate suppression.
