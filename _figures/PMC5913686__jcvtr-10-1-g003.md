caption: 'Final infarct size is due to injury conferred during ischaemia and also
  the injury incurred as a result of ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The damage
  occurring on reperfusion is largely determined by a massive burst of ROS production
  originating from ischaemically damaged mitochondria. During ischaemia intracellular
  ATP levels and pH drop due to impaired OXPHOS and a switch to anaerobic glycolysis
  with lactic acid production. The intracellular proton accumulation activates the
  Na/Hantiporter and sodium enters the intracellular space. The ATP dependent Na/K
  antiporter is now unable to remove the intracellular Na and excess Na leads to a
  reversal of the Na/Ca antiporter with a resultant increase of intracellular calcium
  and mitochondrial swelling. The Influx of calcium into the mitochondria and an increase
  in ROS production both favour the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP), but the associated low pH prevents its opening (). ROS production during
  ischaemia is promoted by the accumulation of electrons within the ETC as hypoxia
  halts, or even reverses the electron flow. ETC complexes are in a reduced state
  which promotes acceptance of the electrons by the remaining oxygen to form superoxide.
  Following reperfusion pH recovers quickly towards normal and these results in opening
  of the mPTP within a few minutes of reperfusion., During early reperfusion and reoxygenation
  the ischemia damaged ETC in the presence of an abrupt increase in flow of accumulated
  electrons and an associated increase in electron leak (mainly at complex I and III)
  is responsible for a burst in superoxide production ().- Opening of the non-specific
  mPTP results in sudden dissipation of the electrochemical gradient across the inner
  mitochondrial membrane causing hydrolysis rather than synthesis of ATP and perpetuation
  of further ROS production which leads to irreversible oxidization of proteins, DNA,
  and lipids, release of cytochrome c and activation of apoptotic pathways., Reperfusion
  also results in local and systemic inflammatory reactions involving activation of
  neutrophils and platelets. The inhibition of mPTP opening has become a common final
  target for cytoprotective strategies in ischaemia-reperfusion injury.,, Cyclosporine
  A is a direct mPTP opening inhibitor and has been shown to decrease the infarct
  size following reperfusion in a pilot study of 58 patients presenting with acute
  STEMI ()., Another promising agent which is scavenging excess ROS and appears to
  inhibit mPTP opening is edaravone (MCI-186) (). This antioxidant, approved for treatment
  of acute ischaemic stroke in Japan and China, was evaluated in a clinical trial
  in which it was administered 10 minutes before reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction
  and decreased size and preserved cardiac function (n = 80). TRO40303 is another
  novel cytoprotective agent acting via inhibition of mPTP opening which is currently
  being investigated for clinical use in acute myocardial infarction. Other experimental
  strategies comprise induction of upstream endogenous protective mechanisms by ischaemic
  conditioning or pharmacological targeting of upstream conditioning cascade of cytosol
  located pro-survival enzymes which inhibit mPTP opening such as RISK (Reperfusion
  Injury Salvage Kinase), SAFE (Survivor Activating Factor Enhancement) pathways by
  adenosine, opioids, ANP, PDE5 inhibitors and others and are reviewed in detail elsewhere.,,
  Activation of AMPK (adenosine mono-phosphate activated protein kinase) which beneficially
  modulates substrate transport and substrate oxidation in the reperfusion phase is
  another recognized pathway to prevent IRI. A novel strategy is modulation of the
  ETC and related mitochondrial ROS production to confer cytoprotection against myocardial
  injury on reperfusion and is discussed below. Ischaemic conditioning is a strategy
  to limit myocardial infarction size by induction of ischaemia either locally (by
  intermittent occlusion of the affected coronary vessel) or remotely in a distant
  organ (typically a limb) inducing myocardium cytoprotection. Ischaemic conditioning
  can be applied at different time points: before begin of ischaemia (PRE- conditioning,
  IPC), during ongoing myocardial ischaemia (PER-conditioning, IPerC) or at onset
  of reperfusion (POST-conditioning, IPostC). The ischaemia or pharmacological IPerC
  and IPostC strategies are clinically relevant in the setting of acute myocardial
  infarction,; whereas IPC has been successfully used in elective cardiac surgery
  or elective PCI setting where it reduced infarct size and improved post-ischaemic
  function.- One of the cytoprotective mechanisms of IPC is an induction of a slight
  degree of MIM depolarization which protects against ROS induced damage. This mild
  proton leak induced by acute IPC is mediated mainly by UCPs (UCP 2 and 3). Late
  IPC leads to an increase in UCP2 expression. On its own the augmented uncoupling
  should impair energetic efficiency, however IPC also increases expression of complex
  IV and ATP synthase supporting ATP production with a favourable energetic profile
  during repeated hypoxia. Inhibition of complex I (a major ROS source) by acute IPC
  mediated by reversible s-nitration is another mechanism protecting from damage on
  reperfusion (). There has been a surge in interest in the potential use of nitrite
  (NO2-) in the treatment of IRI. Under hypoxic conditions nitrite can be reduced
  to nitric oxide (NO), and is thought to act as the largest storage pool for the
  metabolically active NO., Cardioprotection is conferred during ischaemia by NO donors
  inhibiting both complex I (decreasing ROS production) and complex IV ()., Under
  hypoxic conditions, nitrite is reduced to NO and similarly to ischaemic preconditioning
  confers cytoprotection via blockade and S-nitrosation of complex I in mouse heart
  during ischaemia and reperfusion.,,, We and others are currently undertaking phase
  II trials investigating the cytoprotective effects of iv nitrite in early reperfusion
  phase in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction ()., Amobarbital, a complex
  l inhibitor, preserves mitochondrial respiration and decreases myocardial injury
  both during ischaemia, and during early reperfusion. It attenuates ROS generation
  with consequent decrease in infarct size ()., Unfortunately despite strong animal
  experimental evidence of its cytoprotective properties, exerting its action even
  in aged hearts lacking upstream signalling pathways of post-conditioning, this barbiturate
  narcotic historically used as a “truth serum” has not found its way to human IRI
  studies yet. Multiple other therapies are currently developed for the treatment
  of ischaemic heart disease and IRI; however they often do not target the RC directly
  and are reviewed elsewhere.'
