caption: Working hypothesis on the distinct mechanisms by which TNF-α/IL-1β and IL-6
  inhibit the hepatic GH-IGF-I pathway during inflammation. TNF-α and IL-1β inhibit
  GH signaling via inhibition of GHR expression, while IL-6 inhibits GH signaling
  via stimulation of SOCS3 (left). When GHR expression is maximally inhibited by TNF-α
  and IL-1β and perhaps some other factors, the IL-6-SOCS3 pathway no longer plays
  a role in regulating the hepatic GH-IGF-I pathway (right).
