caption: Model illustrating the dynamic overlapping phases of early events of KSHV
  infection in endothelial and fibroblast cells and KSHV-induced signal pathways and
  their role in infection. In phase 1, KSHV infection is initiated by binding to the
  cell surface via interactions with heparan sulfate (HS) followed by temporal interactions
  with αVβ5, α3β1, and αVβ3 integrins and xCT (CD98) molecules which overlap with
  the induction of host cell preexisting signal molecules (phase 2) that play roles
  in actin remodeling, the formation of endocytic vesicles, virus entry, movement
  in the cytoplasm, delivery into the nucleus, and viral and host gene expression.
  KSHV interactions with cell surface integrins leads to autophosphorylation of FAK
  at tyrosine 397, which creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src family kinases
  and leads to the subsequent phosphorylation of PI3-K and Rho GTPases. FAK, Src,
  PI-3K, and Rho GTPases play roles in KSHV entry. In the absence of FAK, Pyk2 is
  induced to compensate for the function of FAK. In phase 3, overlapping with phase
  2, the virus enters the cells by endocytosis, and in phase 4, viral capsid/tegument
  moves in the cytoplasm. RhoA activates Dia2, which in turn augments Src activation,
  all of which are probably essential for the formation of endocytic vesicles and
  their movement in the cytoplasm. Capsid is released from the endocytic vesicles
  via fusion of the viral envelope with the endocytic vesicles. The role of signal
  pathways in the acidification of endosomes and changes in viral envelope architecture
  are poorly understood. RhoA GTPase facilitates the transport of capsid toward the
  nucleus by inducing MT stabilization and regulating MT dynamics via Dia2. The endocytic
  vesicles with virus or released capsid/tegument complexes bind to dynein motor components,
  transported along the MT to reach the nuclear vicinity, and deliver the viral DNA
  into the nucleus. RhoA GTPases facilitate the transport of the capsid toward the
  nucleus by inducing microtubule stabilization and regulating microtubule dynamics.
  KSHV-induced ERK and NF-κB play roles in the modulation of both viral and host gene
  expression and to overcome the host restriction on transcription. Nuclear delivery
  of the KSHV genome into the infected cell nucleus is followed by simultaneous induction
  of viral gene expression (phase 6a) and host gene expression (phase 6b). The overlapping
  viral gene-induced host cell gene expression may exert an influence on subsequent
  viral and host gene expression. These studies demonstrate that KSHV interactions
  with host cell receptors play vital roles in manipulating the host cell signaling
  pathway to create a conducive intracellular environment for the establishment of
  a successful infection. The arrows indicate the stage of KSHV infection in which
  the induced signal pathways are shown to play roles.
