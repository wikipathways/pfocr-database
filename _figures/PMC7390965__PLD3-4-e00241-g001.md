caption: Differences between the UPR in mammalian and plant cells. (a) Mammalian cells
  have three arms of the UPR signaling pathway including an arm involving Protein
  Kinase RNA‐Like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) which phosphorylates eIF2α in
  response to ER stress, thereby inhibiting translation initiation. (b) Plant cells
  have two arms of the UPR signaling pathway and do not have a PERK homolog leaving
  open the question as to whether translation is attenuated in response to ER stress
  in plants. Not shown is the RIDD activity of IRE1 in which this factor attacks other
  mRNAs on the ER membrane. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RIDD, regulated IRE1‐dependent
  decay; UPR, unfolded protein response
