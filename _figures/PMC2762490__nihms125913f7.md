caption: LMO4 is an essential intermediate of ErbB2-induced proliferation. LMO4 is
  target of ErbB2 signaling that induces proliferation. This pathway begins with ErbB2
  regulation of PI3K activity, which controls expression of the transcriptional modulator
  LMO4 and ultimately leads to induction of cullin-3 gene expression. Cullin-3 in
  turn modulates cell cycle progression through G2/M. By regulating progression through
  G2/M, LMO4 also indirectly regulates expression of the G1 cyclins, Cyclin D1 and
  Cyclin E.
