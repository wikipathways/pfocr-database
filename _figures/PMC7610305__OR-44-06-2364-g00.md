caption: Upregulated AspH activates the Notch signaling pathway. HIF-1α controls AspH
  expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with the HRE. AspH upregulation
  promotes the release of the NICD from the Notch receptor. NICD enters the nucleus
  and forms a Notch transcription activation complex with RBPJ and MAML. Subsequently,
  the downstream Notch-responsive genes are activated. AspH, aspartate β-hydroxylase;
  NICD, Notch intracellular domain; NECD, Notch extracellular domain; HRE, hypoxia
  response element; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; MAML, mastermind-like; ADAM,
  a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; HES1, hairy and enhancer of split-1; HEY1,
  hairy-related transcription factor-1; EpCAM, epithelial cell adhesion molecule;
  PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; JAG, Jagged; RBJP, recombination signal
  binding protein Jκ; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase.
