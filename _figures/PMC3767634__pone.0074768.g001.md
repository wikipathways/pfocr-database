caption: Rate-limiting enzyme, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), condenses serine
  and palmitoyl-CoA to 3-ketosphinganine, which is subsequently reduced to sphinganine.
  Dihydroceramide synthases 1-6 (CerS 1-6), each utilizing a preferred subset of fatty
  acid-derived acyl-CoAs, add a fatty acyl chain (green) to sphinganine to produce
  dihydroceramides. Dihydroceramide desaturase (DES1) converts dihydroceramides to
  ceramides by introduction of a 4,5-trans double bond into the sphinganine backbone
  of dihydroceramide. 4-HPR stimulates both SPT and CerS in certain cancer cell lines.
  Both 4-HPR and GT-11, a synthetic ceramide derivative, inhibit DES1. Asterisks (*)
  indicate variable carbon length and saturation.
