caption: Schematic drawing depicting the mechanisms by which EGFRAP could limit EGFR/Ras
  activity in normal (A) and RasV12-dependent oncogenic cells (B). (A) In normal cells
  EGFRAP and PVRAP act as negative regulator of the EGFR. Expression of EGRAP is confined
  to cells with high levels of EGFR activity via the Notch pathway. EGFRAP elimination
  results in a slight increase in EGFR activity, which does not seem to affect normal
  morphogenesis. However, the simultaneous elimination of EGFRAP and PVRAP leads to
  a further enhancement of EGFR signaling with consequences in normal morphogenesis.
  (B) Oncogenic EGFR/Ras activity promotes, via activation of the Notch pathway, an
  increase in EGFRAP expression that, in turn, restrains both EGFR activity and its
  capacity to induce hyperplasia. Downregulation of EGFRAP releases this restraint
  leading to a further increase in EGFR/Ras pathway activity and tumor growth, which
  is enhanced by elimination of PVRAP.
