caption: Mechanisms of NNRTI-induced liver toxicity suggested by in vitro and in vivo
  studies for (a) Nevirapine (NVP) and (b) Efavirenz (EFV). NVP leads to the release
  of danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) by hepatocytes, and to
  the formation of hepatocytic inclusions composed of lipid droplets surrounded by
  smooth endoplasmatic reticulum cisternae (LSER), which are deposited in sinusoids.
  These two events presumably contribute to triggering the immune response. NVP is
  also proposed to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and to increase bile acid synthesis,
  while at supra-therapeutic concentrations, this drug induces hepatocyte apoptosis.
  EFV inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain, which diminishes oxygen
  consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, and increases reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, this
  drug produces ER stress, since it activates inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α) and, consequently,
  IRE1α-catalyzed splicing of X-box binding protein 1(XBP1) mRNA. EFV-induced mitochondrial
  dysfunction and ER stress are thought to be interconnected, to alter autophagic
  flux and to promote lipid accumulation inside hepatocytes. c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) pathway is also activated in response to EFV, possibly related to alterations
  in mitochondrial and ER function. In addition, EFV also inhibits bile acid transport.
  All these events have been shown to promote hepatocyte death.
