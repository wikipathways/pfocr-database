caption: (A) 2-Aminoadipic Acid as a Marker of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases.2-AAA
  is positively correlated with glycoxidative damage, insulin release, and body mass
  index (BMI), and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
  (HDL-C) and insulin sensitivity. (B) Potential Mechanisms of 2-AAA in Insulin Secretion
  and Lipolysis. This schematic illustrates the proposed pathways by which 2-AAA affects
  insulin secretion and lipolysis. The primary sites of 2-AAA action are pancreatic
  β-cells and adipocytes. In pancreatic β-cells, 2-AAA facilitates insulin secretion
  by regulating the transcription of crucial genes involved in insulin production
  (Ins1 and Ins2), glucose uptake (Glut2), glucose metabolism (Gck, Pcx), and insulin
  biosynthesis. Additionally, in adipocytes, 2-AAA overstimulates β3-adrenergic receptor
  signaling, leading to enhanced lipolysis and thermogenesis
