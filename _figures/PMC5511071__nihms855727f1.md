caption: A schematic overview of hippocampal signaling pathways whose modulation by
  sleep deprivation may contribute to effects on memory formation. Sleep deprivation
  has been reported to reduce glutamatergic signaling while increasing adenosine levels.
  Sleep deprivation also attenuates cAMP signaling, CREB-mediated gene transcription,
  translational processes through mTOR signaling, and structural plasticity through
  modulation of the PKA-LIMK-cofilin pathway. All of these molecular events are shown
  in a single connected pathway in order to demonstrate how the effects of sleep deprivation
  could potentially interact to impact learning and memory. Dashed black lines and
  blue arrows pointing down indicate attenuation of the signaling pathway. Red lines
  and upward pointing arrows indicate an increase of the signaling pathway.
