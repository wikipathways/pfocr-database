caption: HUWE1 regulates mediators of the ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway that is activated
  at stalled RFs. (1) Upon RF stalling at intra- or interstrand crosslinks, ATR is
  recruited to the lesion and activated by TOPBP1. Cdc6 functions as a chromatin receptor
  for ATR. Chk1 is phosphorylated by ATR and triggers a response cascade to mitigate
  replication stress. This includes modulation of the cell cycle, DNA damage repair,
  inhibition of global origin firing and RF stabilization/remodeling. Pol β is responsible
  for TLS at stalled RFs. (2) HUWE1 negatively regulates Cdc6, TOPBP1 and Chk1 via
  polyubiquitination. Alternatively, Chk1 is activated to lesser extend by HUWE1-mediated
  polyubiquitination. Pol β is monoubiquitinated by HUWE1 prior to Hsc70-interacting
  protein-mediated polyubiquitination for proteasomal degradation. HUWE1 depletion
  could hyperactivate the ATR-Chk1 axis via enhancement of its targets.
