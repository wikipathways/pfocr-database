caption: Outline of the predicted and confirmed UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc biosynthetic
  pathways. The chemical names within boxes are sugar compounds in these metabolic
  pathways. The enzymatic activity required for each step is shown within parentheses
  as a roman numeral. Arrows labeled a and b are the predicted reactions required
  for the construction of the distinct UDP-GalNAc biosynthetic pathway (shown on the
  left) and analyzed in this work. The dashed arrow labeled c indicates the known
  UDP-GalNAc biosynthetic pathway. The stippled background indicates the UDP-GalNAc
  biosynthetic pathway present in S. tokodaii identified in this study. Each cofactor
  used for each reaction is shown alongside the reaction. The ST designations indicate
  the protein catalyzing the corresponding reaction identified from S. tokodaii, and
  the underlined designations indicate the proteins characterized in this study.
