caption: A schematic diagram of the mechanism underlies miR‐155 function in chondrocyte
  apoptosis and catabolic activity. In chondrocytes, the PI3K/Akt pathway normally
  functions to suppress apoptosis and catabolism once upon stimulation of IL‐1β through
  signalling transduction and indirect transcriptional control of collagen Ⅱ, aggrecan,
  MMP3 and MMP13. However, the IL‐1β secreted in the surroundings binds to its cognate
  receptor IL‐1R on the membrane of chondrocytes, leading to up‐regulation of miR‐155
  via an unknown mechanism, which in turn inhibits PI3K/Akt pathway through targeting
  PIK3R1, one regulatory subunit of PI3K complex, and thus exacerbating IL‐1β adverse
  effects to induce chondrocyte apoptosis and catabolism

  activity by targeting PIK3R1‐mediated PI3K/Akt pathway.
