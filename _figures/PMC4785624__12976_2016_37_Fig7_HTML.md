caption: 'This signal transduction model is general. There will be replacement or
  alternate proteins for some of the proteins in our model in some tissues or organisms.
  As embryogenesis proceeds there will be more feedback loops amplifying the contraction
  and expansion signals and additional inhibitory or excitatory interactions down
  the signal transduction pathways. In some cellular differentiations, highly specialized
  versions of these signal transduction pathways will exist such as where cells only
  one cell state splitter reaction can actually take place. Nuclear State Splitter
  Participants: wnt- Name is derived from “Wingless” and formerly considered “The
  Morphogen”, wnt acts primarily as an autocrine protein which binds one or more transmembrane
  protein and affects their conformation and phosphorylation and thereby affects signal
  transduction pathways, often amplifying other signals. FzR-Frizzled transmembrane
  protein. Cdc42 –a cell cycle protein that takes part in signal transduction pathways
  and can signal the cell to enter mitosis. It is a member of the small Rho-kinase
  family that is known to affect microfilament contraction and also can stimulate
  pathways promoting cell division. A round of determination is often followed by
  cell proliferation as part of differentiation and this could be via Rho-kinase.
  PKC – Protein Kinase C is a protein normally found in the cytosol of the cell in
  an inactive form but when phosphorylated by other signaling molecules, in particular
  calcium ions and diaglycerols, translocates to the cell membrane where it interacts
  with other kinases, especially RACK (receptor for activated C Kinase). PKC continues
  to signal long after the calcium flux has faded and the diaglycerol signal has ended
  and so can be considered a signal amplifier. CaN- Calcineurin which is known to
  dephosphorylate the transcription factor NFAT. This causes a conformation change
  which exposes the NFAT nuclear import signal allowing it move to the nucleus and
  bind to specific DNA sequences and change gene expression. β-catenin -Caderin associated
  protein beta one, a dual function protein that is active in cell to cell adhesion
  as well as gene expression. JNK-c-Jun terminal kinase first found because they bind
  and phosphorylate c-jun forming a transcriptional activator domain on DNA. JNK is
  a form of mitogen activated protein. PLC-An enzyme which cleaves PIP2 to form two
  products, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diaglycerol both of which are second
  messengers that commonly affect opening and closing of membrane channels. Diaglycerol
  and calcium combined can trigger Protein Kinase C translocation. PIP2 -Phosphatidyinositol
  4,5-biphosphate, a phospholipid that is the major constituent of membranes that
  is cleaved by PLC. Such cleavage can activate PKC. Dvl – Dishevelled, cytoplasmic
  phosphoprotein that is required for canonical and noncanonical wnt pathway signal
  transduction and wnt signaling. CK1- Casein Kinase 1 involved in phosphorylation
  of Dishevelled. Axin- A dual domain cytoplasmic protein, with one domain binding
  the disheveled receptor and the other binding G proteins. APC-Adenomatous polyposis
  coli, so called because when one version is mutated in humans it is connected to
  development of colon cancer. It is a negative regulator which reduces β-catenin
  response and is also directly connected to e-cadherin. GSK3- glycogen synthase kinase
  3, phosphorylates β-catenin (thereby signaling for it to be degraded) in response
  to signaling from Axin. DAAM1-Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1,
  a protein associated with microfilament polymerization, possibly by acting as a
  scaffold protein. It is activated by Rho. Rho – A member of the Ras homolog gene
  family, Rho is a kinase that is activated during microfilament contraction by directly
  stimulating microfilament polymerization undertaken by the formins. Formins recruit
  free actin monomers which are then used to elongate microfilaments. (They also capture
  and stabilize free ends of microtubules required for ruffling in forward movements
  of cells.) ROCK – Rho associated protein kinase, this protein works downstream to
  Rho and can either trigger stabilization or destabilization of microfilaments. It
  can also trigger contraction by activating specific myosins. Rac - a serine/threonine-protein
  kinase that interacts with multiple other kinases. MAPK – Mitogen activated protein
  type K. MAPs were originally called microtubule associated proteins because when
  they phosphorylate another set of proteins, MAP, that bind to microtubules. MAP-
  microtubule associated protein, bind to microtubules and can either stabilize or
  destabilize microtubules depending on phosphorylation signals from other proteins.
  When signalled by wnt signal transduction they generally stabilize and elongate
  microtubules'
