caption: 'Schematic representation of major biochemical pathways involved in the formation
  of myofibroblasts (myoFBs), activation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), profibrotic
  signaling, and key readouts for in vitro assays. (A) In vivo formation of myoFBs
  occurs from different cell types including resident fibroblasts, pericytes, fibrocytes,
  or mesenchymal stem cells, stimulated by mediators such as TGFβ1, ET1 (endothelin
  1), AngII (angiotensin II), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), SLC (secondary
  lymphoid chemokine), IL8 (interleukin-8), CTGF (connective tissue factor), or aldosterone.
  (B) Activation of CFs is triggered by a myriad of cytokines and growth factors,
  such as TGF-β, CCN2 (connective tissue factor 2), PDGFs, AngII, aldosterone, endothelin-1,
  TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α), IL1-β (interleukin-1 β), or IL6 (interleukin-6).
  Activation of TGF-β receptor (TβR) leads to activation of downstream canonical SMAD
  and noncanonical pathways. The majority of cardiac fibrosis assays rely on measuring
  one of four major readouts: () TGF-β pathway activation/TGF-β-dependent gene expression;
  () α-SMA expression; () (mature) collagen detection; and () fibroblast proliferation
  or migration. Angiotensin II receptor type 1-mediated (AT1R) signaling and endothelin
  receptor-mediated (ETA/ETB) signaling also contribute to cardiac fibrosis. As an
  excellent, in-depth review of signaling for the formation of myoFB and activation
  of CF, the reader is referred to the study of . Figure created using Servier Medical
