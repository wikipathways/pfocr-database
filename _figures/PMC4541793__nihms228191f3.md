caption: Small molecule inhibitors of TßR1 such as ALK4 blocks Smad2/3 activation
  by preventing their binding to the kinase domain of ALK5. Inability to phosphorylate
  Smad2/3 results in abrogation of Smad-dependent TGF-ß responses such as collagen
  synthesis and myofibroblast transformation. Peptide aptamers displaying the Smad-binding
  domains of particular Smad-interacting proteins such as SARA (Trx-SARA) prevent
  recruitment of essential cofactors to the activated Smad complex, and selectively
  prevent Smad-mediated transcriptional responses. Commonly used drugs such as the
  PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone, and the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
  mesylate block signal transduction downstream from TßR1.
