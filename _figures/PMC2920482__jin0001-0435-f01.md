caption: Detection of WNV and activation of IFN-α/β genes and ISG according to the
  2-step model. Infection by WNV produces dsRNA intermediates in the cytosol that
  are detected as non-self by the host. RIG-I acts as the main sensor for WNV during
  the early steps of infection. RIG-I activation promotes interaction with IPS-1 that
  leads to the recruitment of TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε, which phosphorylate and activate
  IRF-3. Very small amounts of constitutively produced IRF-7 may be activated via
  this pathway. IRF-3 then translocates into the nucleus, binds the IFN-β gene promoter
  and promotes transcription and translation. Secretion of IFN-β by the infected cells
  results in paracrine type I IFN signaling through the IFNAR receptor. Activation
  of IFNAR induces phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyk2, which can promote the formation
  of the heterotrimer IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 formed by STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9.
  Ultimately, translocation into the nucleus of IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 induces
  hundreds of ISGs, including IRF-7. During late phases of infection, detection of
  WNV also relies on MDA5. Induction of the IFN-α and IFN-β genes then occurs mainly
  via the transcriptional activity of IRF-7. Detection of WNV during the late phase
  may also involve PKR, which induces the IFN-α and IFN-β genes via an unknown mechanism
  (potentially via NF- κβ activation and/or TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε recruitment). In
  MΦ and mDC, IFN-β is induced at least partially through IPS-1-dependent yet IRF-3
  and IRF-7-independent pathways. In MΦ, IRF-3 regulates the basal expression of host
  defense genes as described in the text. X = Sites in the recognition and signaling
  cascade at which WNV has developed specific mechanisms to counteract IFN. These
  are described in detail in the text.
