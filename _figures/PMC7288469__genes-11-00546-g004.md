caption: CFTR Proteostasis Interactors. Selected proteins active in the CFTR proteostasis
  pathway are shown. Octagons represent E3 ubiquitin ligases; trapezoids indicate
  kinases; circles represent chaperones; pentagons indicate deubiquitinases; co-chaperones
  and all other proteins are represented as squares; proteostasis modulators are represented
  as stars. Red arrows indicate degradation interactions; green arrows represent activation
  or maturation interactions; yellow arrows indicate that the protein can have degradative
  or activation interactions. In most cases, these proteins degrade Phe508del, while
  promoting wtCFTR maturation. Proteins shaded in purple primarily interact with co-factors
  or CFTR at the ER; orange at the cell surface; yellow at the Golgi apparatus. Proteins
  shaded in blue can interact with co-factors or CFTR at the ER or cell surface. Underlined
  proteins are primarily only found in the Phe508del proteostasis pathway, whereas
  italicized proteins are usually found in the wtCFTR pathway. Curved lines indicate
  that pyridostigmine and biperiden are believed to act by mimicking the transcriptional
  changes resulting from downregulation of SIN3A. Please note that the most common
  interactions and locations for each protein are shown. Some proteins are active
  at multiple locations.
