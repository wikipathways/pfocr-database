caption: RNA modification and related regulators involved in TMZ resistance. (A) RNA
  m6A modification and its “writers”, “erasers” and “readers”, each color represents
  one individual pathway related to m6A modification regulators, and these pathways
  may finally cause different effect to TMZ treatment; (B) m5C modifications in rRNAs
  or lncRNAs may play a potential role in TMZ chemoresistance but the mechanisms still
  remain unclear; (C) RNA m1A modification related genes expression pattern has been
  proved to be associated with TMZ resistance; (D) A to I editing may effect TMZ resistance
  by participating in GSC self-renewal and stemness, and the important role of NF–kB
  pathway has also been realized.
