caption: Intracellular DNA sensors involved in the activation of IFN signaling and
  the NF-κB pathway. The cGAS/STING pathway is a major cytosolic dsDNA-sensing pathway.
  Upon viral infection, cGAS dimerizes and binds to two dsDNA strands, which induces
  a conformational change allowing the synthesis of cGAMP from GTP and ATP. cGAMP
  binds to STING and recruits TBK1 to activate IRF3 for type I IFN production. In
  addition to cGAS, several DNA sensors, including the receptors IFI16, DNA-PK, DDX41,
  DAI, and hnRNPA2B1, also induce type I IFN production through the STING–TBK1–IRF3
  axis. However, RNA Pol-III regulates type I IFN induction through the RIG-1/MAVS
  signaling pathway. Once bound to AT-rich dsDNA, RNA Pol-III will convert this DNA
  to 5′-triphosphate dsRNA (5′-ppp-dsRNA), which is recognized by RIG-I and interacts
  with MAVS to mediate type I IFN production. Aside from their role in activating
  IRF3, a few sensors are also involved in activating IRF7. DHX36 binds to CpG-DNA
  via its DEAH domain and leads to the activation of IRF7 and the release of IFN-α.
  In addition to IFN signaling, the cytosolic sensors cGAS and DHX9 and the endosomal
  receptor TLR9 can activate NF-κB signaling. After viral invasion and DNA recognition,
  TLR9 recruits MyD88, which induces the formation of the IRAK4/IRAK1/TRAF3/IKKα complex.
  This complex then triggers the activation of the NF-κB pathway and IRF7, which in
  turn promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-α. DHX9 binds to
  CpG-DNA and activates the IRF7 pathway, promoting the release of IFN-α
