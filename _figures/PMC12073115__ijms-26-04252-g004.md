caption: 'Mammalian RNA-dependent mRNA amplification is enabled by the integrated
  stress response. Distinct stressors selectively named in the Figure activate, in
  a stressor-specific manner, a subset (one or more) of eIF2α kinases: PKR, GCN2,
  PERK, and HRI; the activation process entails autophosphorylation and dimerization
  of the kinases. When activated, kinases phosphorylate eIF2α at its Ser51 residue;
  this is the event, which integrates a multitude of signaling pathways into a single
  outcome; it is the essence of the integrated stress response pathway. When elicited,
  the ISR radically rearranges the transcriptional and translational landscapes of
  the cell. Global cellular protein production is severely inhibited, primarily through
  suppression of cap-dependent initiation of translation. Concurrently, the ISR activates
  cap-independent translation of a small set of selected mRNA species, including those
  that encode various transcription factors. Among the proteins whose production was
  enabled by the ISR are essential components of RdRp, not present under regular,
  non-ISR, conditions. Thus, ISR enables the operation of the mammalian RNA-dependent
  RNA amplification pathway'
