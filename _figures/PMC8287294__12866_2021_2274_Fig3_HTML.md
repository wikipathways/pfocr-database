caption: Some of the underlying molecular mechanisms for colorectal cancer bacteriotherapy.
  The whole cell bacteria (especially Lactic acid bacteria known as LABs) may lead
  cancer cells to apoptosis through intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. Bacterial peptides
  such as arenamides can prevent TNF-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
  by NF-κB pathway blockage. Bacterial toxins such as C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE)
  can directly interact with claudin-3 and claudin-4, which are over-expressed in
  colorectal cancerous cell membrane. This attachment results in pore formation through
  the membrane and cell death due to loss of cellular osmotic equilibrium. Another
  mechanism for bacterial toxins’ anti-cancer effect is cytotoxicity through apoptosis
  intrinsic pathway. Bacteriocins such as nisin are able to form membrane-pores when
  they bind to special type of cell surface receptors which cause leakage of cellular
  content and cell death. Besides pore formation activity, bacteriocins may act as
  apoptosis initiator through the intrinsic pathway [, , , , , , ]
