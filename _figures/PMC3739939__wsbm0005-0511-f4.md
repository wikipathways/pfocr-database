caption: Pathway analysis showing integration between signaling pathways, transcription
  factors, and adhesion genes. Wnt and BMP act at the top of the hierarchy to initiate
  the induction of EMT cascade. The transcriptional network, including Twist1/2, Zeb1/2,
  Snail1/2, Sox10, and Mitf, is active both in neural crest development and cancer.
  The transcription factors then interact with adhesion genes on the cell surface
  including N-cadherin (N-cad), E-cadherin (E-cad), Occludins (Ocln), Claudins (Cldn),
  and extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN) and intermediate filament
  proteins such as vimentin (Vim). (The network was built with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis,
  Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA and modified in Adobe Illustrator).
