caption: 'Summary of the mechanism of several important drug candidates for anti-cancer
  metabolism therapies. Phloretin inhibits the import of glucose, a major source of
  nutrient for cancer cells. 2DG, 3BrPA, and Lonidamine inhibit HK2, a rate-limiting
  step of glycolytic pathway. 3PO blocks PFK1 activation by inhibiting PFKFB3 (PFK2).
  FX11 selectively inhibits LDHA, a major metabolic enzyme of cancer. BPTES and 968
  suppress the function of GLS1. GLS1 is a glutaminolytic enzyme that is highly and
  selectively upregulated in cancer. DCA inactivates PDH kinase (PDK), thereby increasing
  PDH activity and enhances the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and decreases
  cancer glycolysis. Metformin blocks energy production of cancer cells by inhibiting
  mitochondrial complex I, suppresses lipid and protein synthesis, modulates glycolysis.
  At the organism level, by lowering blood glucose concentration, metformin decreases
  glucose supply, as well as insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling availability
  for tumor cells. MCT inhibitors impair the metabolic lactate-based symbiosis of
  cancer cells. Many other anti-cancer metabolism compounds are under development.
  Targeting cancer metabolism is a very promising direction for anti-cancer therapies.
  It is expected that inhibitors of tumor metabolism will play an important role in
  clinical oncology within five or ten years. These medications could be used alone
  or in combination with other current anti-cancer therapies to increase efficacy.
