caption: Overview of ER-induced UPR stress signaling pathway. The UPR is an adaptive
  mechanism activated in response to ER stress. The three UPR stress sensing proteins
  that are activated are IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, which work independently with an aim
  to maintain protestatic balance via decreasing the load of misfolded proteins and
  restoring ER protein homeostasis.
