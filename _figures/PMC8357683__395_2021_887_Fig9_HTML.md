caption: A working model summarizing the mechanism of LncHrt function in myocardial
  infarction. In the infarcted heart, LncHrt is repressed through an increased interaction
  between CDK5 and SIRT2 accompanied by inhibition of LKB1-AMPK signaling. Under compensated
  LncHrt gene expression, SIRT2 activity is preserved by interfering with CDK5 inhibition
  of catalytic activity, then SIRT2 deacetylates LKB1 and enhances phosphorylation
  of LKB1, which activates LKB1-AMPK signaling. This, in turn, preserves heart function
  and prevents adverse cardiac remodeling by modulating metabolic homeostasis
