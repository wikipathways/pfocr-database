caption: Pathway for barrier regulation in the perineurium (P). Pain arising in the
  periphery is transmitted via nociceptors (yellow, peripheral sensory neuron) to
  the spinal cord. Peripheral neurons are surrounded by the perineurium, which is
  composed of perineurial cells (orange). Perineurial application of hypertonic saline
  (NaCl) activates MMP9. The hemopexin domain of MMP9 binds to low-density LRP-1.
  Activation of LRP-1 triggers phosphorylation of ERK, which finally leads to down-regulation
  of claudin-1 and opening of the perineurial barrier. This allows sodium channel
  blockers (Nav) or opioids to pass paracellularly, bind to their receptors, and inhibit
  transmission of painful signals from the periphery to the spinal cord.
