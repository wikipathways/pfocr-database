caption: Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) signaling pathways, intra-, and inter-signaling
  crosstalk circuits, and their regulatory loops. Cell surface expressed TLRs, including
  TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11, and intracellularly expressed TLRs on endosomal membranes,
  including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9, recognize their specific pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) to activate their signaling pathways. Small molecules and/or microbial
  ligands, depicted on the top of the cell surface expressed TLRs, occupy the extracellular
  domain of the TLRs. Upon activation, they induce conformational changes in the intracellular
  domain to induce a signaling pathway by recruitment of the adaptor molecules (i,e.,
  MyD88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM) followed by downstream signals leading to the activation
  of sevral transcriptions factors (i.e., AP-1, NF-κB, IRF-3 or IRF-7). These key
  transcription factors drive the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines
  as well as antiapoptotic factors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can promote cancer
  progression in three ways; firstly through facilitating immortalization by activating
  the proapoptotic factors, secondly recruiting the immune cells for creating a tumor-friendly
  microenvironment, and lastly by expanding the blood vessel to maximize the chances
  of metastasis (52–55). The image has been created with Biorender.com (56).
