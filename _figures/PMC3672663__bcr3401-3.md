caption: Small-molecule Hedgehog pathway inhibitors and effects on the Hedgehog signalling
  pathway. Currently, all of the small-molecule Hedgehog (Hh) pathway therapeutics
  in clinical trial target Smoothened (SMO). Several compounds targeting the Hh pathway
  either upstream or downstream of SMO are under development and could be an alternative
  strategy to overcome acquired resistance to Smo-targeting therapies. GLI, Glioma-associated
  oncoprotein;HHIP, Hh-interacting protein; PTCH, Patched.
