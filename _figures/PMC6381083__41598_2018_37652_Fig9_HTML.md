caption: Schematic representation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Proteins
  of these pathways are up regulated once the TLRs on cells are stimulated in the
  presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The TLRs-activation culminates with the translocation
  of NF-κB into the nucleus followed for the pro-inflammatory cytokines genes. In
  the presence of nFhGST a large number of proteins participating in these signaling
  cascades are down regulated, which blocks the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus
  and the cytokine synthesis. Red arrows indicate proteins that were downregulated
  by nFhGST.
