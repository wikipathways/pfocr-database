caption: Acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA
  synthase (HMGS) are converted to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which
  is then converted to mevalonate through the action of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) and
  the cofactor NADPH. This reaction is the rate-limiting step for cholesterol synthesis,
  and statins are a substrate for HMG-CoA reductase. Through a series of reactions,
  mevalonate is converted to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by farnesyl pyrophosphate
  synthase (FPPS). FPP is a key branch point for synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP), cholesterol, ubiquinone, and dolichol. Both FPP and GGPP are required for
  prenylation of GTP-binding proteins such as Rho, Rac, and Ras, enabling those proteins
  to be inserted in membranes. FPP is also the precursor of squalene. Conversion of
  squalene to cholesterol requires over 19 reactions. Cholesterol is subsequently
  converted to oxysterols such as 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 25S-hydroxycholesterol.
