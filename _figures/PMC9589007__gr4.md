caption: Biological pathway of pyruvate metabolism and the TCA cyclePathway visualization
  based on Reactome and complemented with details from KEGG and the literature. Tiles
  illustrate log-fold change values of T2D compared with CTRL in VAT (left-hand side
  of tile) and skeletal muscle (right-hand side of tile). Proteins leading the decrease
  of the pathway are marked as driving and are shown in black font and colored tiles.
  Proteins participating in the pathway and identified from MS proteomics, but not
  marked as leading edges, are in white tiles, whereas those in gray were not identified
  in this analysis.
