caption: The GC reaction as the normal counterpart of most B cell lymphomas. Formation
  of a GC begins when a naïve B cell encounters an antigen in the presence of co-stimulatory
  molecules, provided by a T helper cell. The GC is functionally and histologically
  divided into two main compartments, the dark zone (DZ) and the light zone (LZ).
  Within the DZ, cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) of their immunoglobulin
  genes and rapid proliferation, whereas in the LZ, B cells are intermingled with
  follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which provide
  positive selection signals to B cells with high affinity to the antigen. The LZ
  is also the site of CSR. By repeatedly cycling between the DZ and the LZ, B cells
  undergo several rounds of proliferation, SHM and affinity maturation before being
  positively selected. In contrast, B cells with low affinity for the antigen are
  eliminated by apoptosis. High affinity B cells that exit the GC differentiate into
  long-lived memory B cells or antibody-secreting plasma cells. Based on molecular
  profiling, Burkitt lymphoma is postulated to derive from DZ B cells, FL and GCB-DLBCL
  from LZ B cells, and ABC-DLBCL from B cells poised to undergo terminal differentiation
  (plasmablasts) or, in a subset of cases, pre-memory B cells. Genetic lesions that
  have been successfully modelled in the mouse and recapitulate key features of the
  human disease are indicated. Red, gain of function events; blue, loss of function
  events. M, mutation; Tx, translocation; Amp, copy number gain/amplification; *,
  pathway activation by use of a constitutively active protein.
