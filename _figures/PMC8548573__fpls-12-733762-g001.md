caption: 'Simplified scheme of flavonoid biosynthesis. The flavonol biosynthesis pathway
  (highlighted via an orange arrow) is part of the flavonoid biosynthesis, which also
  includes the anthocyanin pathway (highlighted via a violet arrow) (modified after
  ). The metabolic flux into the flavonol biosynthesis is influenced by dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR) as it competes with FLS for substrates. Enzyme names are abbreviated
  as follows: chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase
  (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), anthocyanidin synthase
  (ANS).'
