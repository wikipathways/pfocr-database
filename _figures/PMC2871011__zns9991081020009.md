caption: Proposed model for the role of fibrinogen-bound latent TGF-β activated by
  reactive astrocytes after injury. In the uninjured CNS, fibrinogen-bound latent
  TGF-β circulates within the blood stream. BBB disruption or vascular rupture after
  trauma leads to leakage of fibrinogen-bound latent TGF-β into the CNS. Fibrinogen-bound
  latent TGF-β interacts with local perivascular astrocytes, leading to active TGF-β
  formation, which induces reactive astrocytosis by regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathway, resulting in scar formation. Local provisional fibrin matrix thus functions
  as a primary astrocyte activation signal initiating scar formation in the CNS by
  regulating the bioavailability of active TGF-β at sites of vascular damage.
