caption: After an inciting event, inflammatory or angiogenic activity (MMP, VEGF)
  initiates microvascular growth and remodeling, which are stabilized through interplay
  of pathways including TIE-2/ANG and TGF-β or BMP-9 signaling through the ALK-1/ENG
  pathway. Lack of Integrin β8 and Hox A5, an anti-angiogenic transcription factor,
  may also play a role. Normal vessels stabilize, but an incipient AVM undergoes a
  dysplastic response. Arteriovenous (A-V) shunting and high flow rates synergize
  with the dysplastic response and with inflammatory signals, causing a vicious cycle
  in a localized area destined to become the nidus. Eventually, the human disease
  phenotype emerges. Genetic variation can influence any step of the cycle.
