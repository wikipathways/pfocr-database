caption: Hierarchical control of GLP-1 secretion. SGLT1 is responsible for glucose
  sensing in the triggering pathway (solid arrows) involving electrical activity and
  Ca2+ elevations, which trigger exocytosis and GLP-1 release. In the amplifying pathway
  (dashed arrows), GLUT2 promotes glucose influx that increases metabolic factors,
  e.g., ATP, that augment the secretory response at a given Ca2+ level.
