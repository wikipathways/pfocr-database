caption: Integrated view of regulatory pathways involved in cell wall biology. Five
  levels of regulation are represented (cell wall synthetic machinery, brown; surface
  signaling, blue; cell cycle, red; cell polarity, purple; secretion/endocytosis,
  black). Interconnections among processes are indicated by arrows, which are numbered
  from their starting points and colored according to the type of interconnection
  (regulation of activity, green; expression regulation, gray; spatial regulation,
  yellow; vesicular transport, blue; undefined regulatory event, pink). Protein transport
  and glycosylation through the secretory pathway and protein recycling through the
  endocytic pathway affect the synthesis of glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein (1).
  The PKC cell integrity pathway is activated by glucan and chitin defects (2). β-1,3-GS
  and mannoprotein expression is regulated by glucose, nutrients, and oxygen (3).
  Nutrient availability affects filamentation through Kss1 and cyclin regulation (4).
  Sporulation regulates GSC2 and CHS3 expression through Ndt80 (5) and affects polarisome
  function through Kss1 (6). Slt2 acts through Rlm1 on glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein
  synthesis (7) and on the actin cytoskeleton (8). Pkc1 plays a role in the cell cycle
  (9). Slt2 acts on the SBF transcription factor (10). Slt2 affects calcineurin signaling
  through Cch1-Mid1 (11). Pkc1 phosphorylates Chs3 (12). Rho1 is the regulatory subunit
  of the β-1,3-GS (13). The chitosome is mobilized by the action of Rho1 and Pkc1
  on the exocyst and on the secretory pathway, respectively (14). Bni1 is a Rho1 effector
  (15). The Rho1 effector Skn7 has a role in OCH1 expression (16). GSC2 expression
  is controlled by the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor Crz1 (17). Pkc1
  and Rho1 are recruited at the shmoo tip (18). Pheromone exposure induces CHS1 (19),
  leads to recruitment of the cell polarity machinery at the shmoo tip (20), and induces
  a cell cycle arrest (21). The PIR genes are cell cycle regulated (22). Many cell
  wall genes are expressed in G1 (23). Cdc28 regulates the function of Cdc42 under
  vegetative growth (24), during mating (25), and during filamentation (26), respectively.
  The morphogenesis and the cell wall checkpoints affect the cell cycle through the
  septins and dynactin, respectively (27). Slt2 is regulated by the polarisome (28).
  Bud neck assembly regulates Chs2 function (29), and cell polarity directs secretion
  (30). CNR, calcineurin pathway; FIL, filamentous growth program; Fus3, mating pheromone

  description: Integrated view of regulatory pathways involved in cell wall biology.
    Five levels of regulation are represented (cell wall synthetic machinery, brown;
    surface signaling, blue; cell cycle, red; cell polarity, purple; secretion/endocytosis,
    black). Interconnections among processes are indicated by arrows, which are numbered
    from their starting points and colored according to the type of interconnection
    (regulation of activity, green; expression regulation, gray; spatial regulation,
    yellow; vesicular transport, blue; undefined regulatory event, pink). Protein
    transport and glycosylation through the secretory pathway and protein recycling
    through the endocytic pathway affect the synthesis of glucan, chitin, and mannoprotein
    (1). The PKC cell integrity pathway is activated by glucan and chitin defects
    (2). β-1,3-GS and mannoprotein expression is regulated by glucose, nutrients,
    and oxygen (3). Nutrient availability affects filamentation through Kss1 and cyclin
    regulation (4). Sporulation regulates GSC2 and CHS3 expression through Ndt80 (5)
    and affects polarisome function through Kss1 (6). Slt2 acts through Rlm1 on glucan,
    chitin, and mannoprotein synthesis (7) and on the actin cytoskeleton (8). Pkc1
