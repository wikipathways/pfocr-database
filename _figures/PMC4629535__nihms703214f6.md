caption: Canonical pathway and gene network analysis of the 26 identifiers that were
  expressed in the lungs of PQ-treated rats. The 26 identifiers were analyzed using
  IPA and the identifiers were grouped to 14 canonical biological process pathways.
  The synaptic long term depression, glutamate receptor signaling, SAPK/JNK signaling,
  neuropathic pain signaling in dorsal horn neurons and synaptic long term potentiation
  were found to be the dominant canonical pathways represented by the identifiers.
  A representative protein network of the dominant canonical pathways was then generated.
  The network was obtained by merging the 2 highest scored networks into one overall
  network; cell-to-signaling and interaction, nervous system development and function,
  cell cycle. C1orf38 was not involved in the highest scored network. Solid grey lines
  and dotted grey lines indicated direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
  Arrow-headed lines and simple lines without arrows indicated ‘acts on’ and ‘binding
  only’, respectively. Solid orange lines and dotted orange lines indicated highlighted
  direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
