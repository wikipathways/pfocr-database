caption: Routes to acquiring antifungal drug resistance and/or tolerance vary depending
  on the mode of action (MOA). a | Azole drug resistance is primarily due to increased
  efflux of the drug from the fungal cell (particularly in Candida spp.) and modifications
  to the sterol biosynthesis pathway caused by point mutations and promoter insertions
  in CYP51A (Aspergillus fumigatus). In other fungal species, such as Cryptococcus
  neoformans, overexpression of the drug target and efflux pumps caused by chromosomal
  aneuploidy and hypermutation is common. b | Polyenes alter cell membrane permeability
  by forming a complex with ergosterol, and resistance is caused by loss-of-function
  mutations in ergosterol biosynthesis genes (particularly in Aspergillus and Candida
  spp.). In Candida albicans in particular, double loss of ERG3 confers resistance.
  However, drug tolerance is common, via upregulation of ERG5, ERG6 and ERG25 in C.
  albicans. c | Cell membrane stress can also impact regulators of HSP90, conferring
  drug tolerance. Echinocandins inhibit 1,3-β-d-glucan synthase (FKS1), and mutations
  in this gene cause resistance in Candida and Fusarium spp. Echinocandin exposure
  can also lead to cell wall stress through inhibition of β-glucan synthase, with
  indirect downstream activation of Ca2+/calcineurin or HSP90/mTOR pathways, which
  are involved in drug tolerance. d | Pyrimidine analogues such as 5-flucytosine inhibit
  DNA and RNA synthesis. Resistance can arise via point mutations in the target gene
  FCY1, and is common in Candida spp. Hypermutation in Cryptococcus spp. is also known
  to cause resistance to this drug class. TR, tandem repeat.
