caption: Binding of TNFα (or IL-1β) to their respective receptors triggers canonical
  NF-κB signaling. Signaling is initiated by activation of an IκB kinase (IKK) complex
  consisting of catalytic kinase subunits (IKKα and/or IKKβ) and the regulatory scaffold
  protein IKKγ. IKK-mediated phosphorylation results in proteasomal degradation of
  the IκB inhibitor enabling the active NFκB transcription factor subunits to translocate
  to the nucleus and induce target gene expression. One of the target genes is IκBα
  gene itself, which re-sequesters NFκB subunits and terminates transcriptional activity,
  unless a persistent activation signal is present. NF-κB is activated also through
  TLR signaling via Myd88 dependent pathway. Receptor induced association of MyD88
  with the TIR domain allows the formation of a complex, including IRAK1 and TRAF6,
  resulting in activation of TAK1, which phosphorylates and activates IKKβ. TLR3 can
  also induce NFκB in a MyD88 independent manner (not shown).
