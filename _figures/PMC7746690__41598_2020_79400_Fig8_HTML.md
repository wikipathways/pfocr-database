caption: Schematic diagram of arachidonate metabolic cascade in liver inflammation
  and the intervention strategies. CCl4 activates AA metabolism and leads to increased
  M1-type macrophages and neutrophils, as well as elevated cytokines, chemokines and
  ROS levels in the liver. Oral administration of gigantol alleviates liver inflammation
  partly through inhibiting the JNK/cPLA2/12-LOX pathway. The image was created by
  using Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 (https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).
