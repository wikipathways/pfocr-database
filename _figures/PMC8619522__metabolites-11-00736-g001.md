caption: Potential T cell metabolism therapeutic targets in GvHD. Alloreactive T cells
  undergo a shift in metabolism characterized by an upregulation of glycolysis, along
  with increased reliance on glutamine and fatty acid metabolism. Regulators of these
  metabolic pathways serve as promising drug targets for the treatment of GvHD. The
  upregulation of glycolysis is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1α and the
  nutrient sensor mTOR, which may be targeted by echinomycin and rapamycin, respectively.
  The drugs PFK15, 3PO, and 2-DG also interfere with glycolysis. PFK15 and 3PO are
  both inhibitors of PFKFB3, and 2-DG inhibits the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and
  glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Fatty acid metabolism is regulated by the acetyl
  CoA carboxylases and the nutrient sensor AMPK. Soraphen A is an ACC1inhibitor, which
  promotes FAO while suppressing fatty acid synthesis. Metformin is an AMPK agonist,
  which similarly upregulates fatty acid oxidation. Etomoxir is an inhibitor of fatty
  acid oxidation and may offer therapeutic benefits in GvHD. Glutamine metabolism
  may be another promising pathway for therapeutic targeting in GvHD. DON, an inhibitor
  of glutamine-utilizing enzymes, has been shown to suppress Th17 proliferation in
  mice, but its therapeutic benefits have yet to be tested in the context of GvHD.
