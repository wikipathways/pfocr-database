caption: Schematic image of vascular contractility pathways in the endothelial cells
  (ECs). Purple labels indicate the nitric oxide (NO) signaling cascade, blue labels
  indicate the prostacyclin (PGI2) cascade, red labels indicate the thromboxane (TXA2)
  cascade and green labels indicate the endothelin-1 (ET-1) cascade. The main pathway
  of NO production starts with the activation of the endothelial enzyme nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS) by an intracellular influx of calcium (Ca+) and/or an agonist signal
  to release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ is then modified by calmodulin
  (CaM) so that it can bind to eNOS, which then results in the production of NO. Once
  Ca2+ levels are generally depleted and more long-term vasodilation is needed, an
  alternative pathway is activated to stimulate NO production directly. Namely, the
  phosphorylation of eNOS via protein kinases (PK) in response to sheer stress on
  the cell surface. Both pathways culminate in sending NO to the smooth muscle cells
  (SMCs), which stimulates a decrease in Ca2+ levels and promotes relaxation; The
  PGI2pathway, a vasodilatory pathway that compensates for low NO levels, is mediated
  and catalyzed by cyclooxygenase enzyme 2 (COX-2), which is activated by sheer stress
  and ECs are damaged and exposed to inflammatory cytokines. The conversion of arachidonic
  acid (AA) into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by COX-2 is the initial step to synthesize
  PGI2. PGI2 then activates platelets and SMCs by binding to a prostacyclin receptor
  (IP). In response, SMCs produce adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and activate protein
  kinase (PKA), which, in turn, relaxes the SMCs in the same way as NO. The binding
  of circulating PGI2 to their EC IP receptor can also promote vasodilation by stimulating
  eNOS; In contrast, the production of TXA2 induces vasoconstriction and platelet
  aggregation. Cyclooxygenase enzyme 1 (COX-1) converts AA into PGH2, which stimulates
  the isomerization of TXA2. In sequence, TXA2 binds to thromboxane-prostanoid receptors
  (TP) located in SMCs and platelets, therefore inducing platelet aggregation. Vasoconstriction
  by TXA2 can also occur by stimulating CA2+ release by the endoplasmic reticulum
  in SMCs. Lastly, the ET-1 pathway is regulated by inflammatory cells (interleukins
  and TNF-α) stimulation and reduction in NO and PGI2 levels. ET-1 receptors are present
  both in ECs (ETB1) and SMCs (ETA and ETB2). When SMC ET-1 receptors are activated,
  there is an influx of calcium due to the opening of the Ca2+ channels, causing vasoconstriction
  in a similar way as TXA2. In contrast, activation of ETB1 receptors in ECs causes
  vasodilation by stimulating the release of PGI2 and NO. When endothelial dysfunction
  occurs, EC ET-1 receptors are downregulated, and SMC ET-1 receptors are upregulated,
  therefore enhancing a vasoconstrictive environment. Image created with BioRender.
