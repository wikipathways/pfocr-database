caption: Amino acid metabolism in chondrocytes.Glutamine protects OA chondrocytes
  by inhibiting the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling
  pathways to promote the expression of proteoglycans and inhibit the expression of
  MMP-1, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5. ADMA affects the metabolism of chondrocytes through
  the ubiquitin‒proteasome pathway, reducing anabolic factors (COL2A1 and aggrecan)
  and increasing catabolic factors (MMP3 and MMP13), inducing degeneration and senescence
  of chondrocytes, and reducing extracellular matrix deposition, thus accelerating
  the progression of OA. Downregulation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1
  (DDAH1) leads to increased ADMA levels in OA patients
