caption: The intricate iron uptake system, often referred to as iron uptake system
  engages in a competitive struggle against nematodes, which are small, elongated
  worms, as they vie for resources with bacteria present in the environment. In nematodes,
  DAF-16 modulates transcription, boosting immunity against stress caused by pathogens
  and their byproducts. Mammalian Nrf2 is essential for regulating innate immune responses
  in alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Despite the presence of PMK-1 phosphorylation
  sites on DAF-16, there is minimal overlap in the immune-related gene expressions
  regulated by PMK-1 and DAF-16, as well as PMK-1, suggesting distinct target effectors
  (1, 9). The p38 MAPK pathway plays a key role in the increased lifespan seen in
  daf-2 mutants. When nematodes begin their defense mechanisms against pathogens,
  P. aeruginosa has already established itself in the intestines, disrupting vital
  cellular processes such as translation and mitochondrial function (2, 3). The key
  sign of infection is ExoA toxicity, which displays common traits in mammals and
  nematodes (4). The inhibition of translation by ExoA promotes ZIP-2 expression via
  translational reduction. The unique and specific characteristics of the ZIP-2 transcriptional
  pathway have effectively enabled the coevolution of a highly accurate neuronal upregulation,
  which is crucial for the rapid behavioral avoidance response, in addition to a ZIP-2-dependent
  antimicrobial reaction that is initiated by the ASJ chemosensory system’s recognition
  of 1-undecene produced by the PA14 strain (5, 6, 7). In reaction to the harmful
  impact caused by the pyoverdines secreted by P. aeruginosa, there is a notable upregulation
  of the ESRE network, indicating its heightened activity in the presence of such
  damage. The increase relies on the transcriptional control of ZIP-2 and various
  bZIP factors. Monitoring mitochondrial equilibrium is the main function of the ESRE
  network, which does not engage in direct mediation of antimicrobial effects (8).
