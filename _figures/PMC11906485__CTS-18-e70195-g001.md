caption: Biosynthetic pathway of plasmalogens and RCDP types based on gene mutation.
  Plasmalogen biosynthesis primarily occurs in the peroxisome. The type of RCDP is
  defined by which gene is mutated. Approximately 80% of RCDP is RCDP1, containing
  mutations in the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7 (PEX7) gene that is responsible
  for importing alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS) into the peroxisome in complex
  with PEX5. Mutations in PEX5 are rare, but result in RCDP5. Mutations in the fatty
  alcohol reductase 1 (FAR1) gene, involved in the conversion of fatty acids to fatty
  alcohols needed for ether synthesis, result in RCDP4 which is also rare. Mutations
  in the genes dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) or AGPS result
  in RCDP types 2 and 3, respectively. Once the 1‐O‐alkyl‐DHAP plasmalogen precursor
  is synthesized in the peroxisome, it is exported to the endoplasmic reticulum where
  a series of enzymes, including TMEM189, complete the remaining enzymatic steps resulting
  in vinyl‐ether plasmalogens. PPI‐1011 was engineered to be an orally bioavailable
  plasmalogen precursor that bypasses the peroxisomal portion of the biosynthetic
  pathway, entering downstream of all known RCDP mutations where it can be converted
  to target plasmalogens by the endoplasmic reticulum
