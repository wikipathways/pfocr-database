caption: Metabolites, metabolic pathways and related metabolic genes that play the
  roles in ferroptosis. Lipid oxidation is an important process in ferroptosis and
  requires the participation of iron. Upregulation of ROS levels by CARS promote ferroptosis,
  while downregulation of iron ion levels by SREBP2 and TF inhibit ferroptosis. Besides,
  PI3K/AKT/mTORC signaling pathway activates lipid synthesis-related SREBP1 and SCD1,
  then affect lipid synthesis to inhibit ferroptosis. While inhibition of SCD1 can
  influence CoQ10 which locate on the mitochondrial electron transport chain and promote
  ferroptosis. BAP1 promotes ferroptosis by inhibiting the cystine transport-related
  SLC7A11, while OTWB1 exerts the opposite effect. Energy stress regulates ACC1 via
  AMPK, reducing ACC1 activity and inhibiting ferroptosis. The red boxes represent
  negative regulators and the green boxes represent positive regulators
