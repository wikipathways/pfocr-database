caption: Proposed origin of accumulating ether lipids in SLS. A, Etherphospholipid
  metabolism in the control brain (upper panel), and the SLS brain (lower panel).
  Dihydroxyacetone phosphate and a fatty alcohol is converted to alkylglycerol in
  the peroxisome after which alkylglycerol is acylated to form 1‐alkyl‐2‐acylglycerol
  (DG[O]). DG[O] can be converted to PE[O] and PC[O] by condensation with CDP‐ethanolamine
  and CDP‐choline, forming plasmanyl‐PE and plasmanyl‐PC. Creation of a vinyl‐ether
  by desaturation, yields plasmenyl‐PE/PC. Collectively the plasmanyl‐ and plasmenyl
  forms are referred to as plasmalogens. DG[O] can also be acylated yielding 1‐alkyl‐2,3‐diacylglycerol
  (TG[O]). Catabolic aldehydes are shown which normally are converted to fatty acids
  by FALDH. In case of FALDH deficiency in SLS, accumulating fatty aldehydes are converted
  to fatty alcohols which are then incorporated in the ether‐(phospho)lipids DG[O],
  TG[O], PC[O], and PE[O]. B, Hypothetic metabolic pathway explaining the formation
  and accumulation of odd chain fatty alcohols and odd‐chain etherlipid and etherphospholipid
  species in the SLS brain. The accumulation of these odd chain lipid species is explained
  using the example of the conversion of a C24‐2‐hydroxy containing sphingolipid.
  After liberation of its fatty acyl chain and activation by CoA‐addition a C24‐2‐OH‐CoA
  results. It is subsequently cleaved by 2‐hydroxyacyl‐CoA lyase 1 yielding formyl‐CoA
  and a C23‐aldehyde. Due to the FALDH deficiency, this C23‐aldehyde is reduced to
  its corresponding alcohol and incorporated into etherlipids and etherphospholipids.
