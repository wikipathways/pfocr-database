caption: Inflammation and ROS. Elevated ROS production as a result of inflammatory
  signaling can mediate canonical NF-κB activation and downstream inflammatory gene
  induction, proteasome activity, antioxidant gene transcription, inflammasome activation,
  and cytokine secretion. The intricate balance between cell death and cell survival
  is largely modulated by intracellular ROS generation. In general, high intracellular
  ROS generation causes cell death by activation of cell death pathways (mitochondrial-dependent
  and -independent), whereas low levels of ROS act as signaling molecules that facilitate
  cell survival. Death receptors such as TNFR1 cause cell death by inducing high intracellular
  ROS production. The binding of TNF-α to TNFR1 recruits proteins such as TRADD and
  TRAF2 to activate TNFR1 signaling. The associated TRADD further recruits FADD and
  pro-caspase-8, and this whole signaling complex known as DISC is endocytosed, resulting
  in caspase-8 activation. Similar to TNFR1, the extent of caspase-8 activation determines
  whether a cell will follow a mitochondrial-dependent pathway or an independent pathway.
  Low caspase-8 activation follows a mitochondrial-dependent amplification loop which
  causes Cyt-C release. The released Cyt-C then subsequently binds Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  and activates effector caspases such as caspase-3, which causes cell death. In the
  event of significant caspase-8 activation, it directly activates caspase-3 independent
  of mitochondria. High intracellular ROS induce sustained JNK activation and causes
  mitochondrial Cyt-C-dependent cell death. TNFR1 signaling also activates the NF-κB
  transcription factor by recruiting TRAF-2 and RIPK1 proteins. NF-κB activation is
  involved in the transcription of anti-apoptotic signaling proteins such as cIAP-2
  and Bcl-xL. On the other hand, TNF can activate the NOX1 (neutrophilic) or NOX2
  (epithelial) complex. The first step of NOX1/2 activation is the interaction of
  the cytosolic domain of TNFR1 with RFK and p22phox. The activated NOX complex converts
  extracellular O2 into O2-•, which extracellular SOD3 then converts into extracellular
  H2O2. The generated H2O2 passes freely through the plasma membrane and acts as a
  major source of intracellular ROS. Furthermore, TNF-induced formation of complex
  II leads to interactions between activated caspase-8, ROMO1 and Bcl-XL in the outer
  mitochondrial membrane, which reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, triggering
  MOMP and the production of MtROS. Conversely, if the levels of caspase-8 are high,
  TNF can activate directly caspase-3 independent of mitochondria, leading to apoptosis.
  Additionally, Ca2+-activated DUOX produces even more H2O2, which joins the cycle.
  Another important role of MtROS is the regulation of the inflammasome. MtROS are
  involved in immune cell activation during inflammation and are primary regulators
  of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These high-molecular-weight complexes activate
  inflammatory caspases (caspase-1 and −11) and cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18). Also
  illustrated are ROS activating NF-κB directly or indirectly by inhibiting IKK phosphatases,
  and JNK stimulating mitochondrial ROS production through SAB.
