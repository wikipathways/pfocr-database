caption: A simplified diagram of the KP. Majority of TRP in the body is catabolized
  through KP to synthesize the vital energy cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
  This pathway is frequently elevated in the inflammatory environment such as cancer
  and has been shown to promote immune evasion. This immune modulation results from
  the overactivation of IDO1/trytophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 that leads to the depletion
  of local TRP, an essential amino acid for T cell proliferation, and production of
  bioactive metabolites (KYN, 3HK, AA, and 3HAA) that promotes selective apoptosis
  of tumor-targeting T cells
