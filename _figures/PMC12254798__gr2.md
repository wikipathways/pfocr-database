caption: Immune cell metabolism and hypoxia drive cancer progression. During obesity,
  adipocytes and resident immune cells in the obesogenic microenvironment become deprived
  of oxygen (hypoxic), as do macrophages, T-cells, and tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment,
  leading to hypoxia-driven metabolic reprogramming. For tumor cells, these metabolic
  changes contribute to tumor progression. Under hypoxic conditions in the AT, IFN-γ
  activates the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway to induce expression of hypoxia inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α), which promotes metabolic reprogramming in M1 macrophages and
  activated T cells. This process contributes to T-cell exhaustion and inflammation,
  thereby affecting immune cell function. In tumor cells, HIF-1α secreted by these
  immune cells activates PI3K/AKT pathways to increase HIF-1α levels and triggers
  expression of angiogenic genes like VEGF. HIF-1α also recruits growth factors (e.g.,
  IGF2) to tumor cells, increasing their proliferation. HIF-1 is also associated with
  decreased adiponectin and elevated leptin expression
