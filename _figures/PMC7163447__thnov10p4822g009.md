caption: A proposed model for the role of mitochondrial biogenesis process in developmental
  fluoride neurotoxicity and protective action of RSV. Mitochondrial biogenesis process
  plays a vital role in developmental fluoride neurotoxicity. Improvement in mitochondrial
  biogenesis by TFAM overexpression causes restoration of mitochondrial function,
  thus alleviating neurotoxic effects of fluoride. Importantly, RSV protects against
  developmental fluoride neurotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function
  activated by SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM signaling pathway, which is suppressed
  by SIRT1 antagonist NIC. Images of hippocampus, vacuum blood-collection tubes and
  developmental children were modified from http://p.ayxbk.com/image s/5/5b/Hippocampus_and_seahorse_cropped.JPG;
