caption: Model for p53 level-dependent DDT pathway choices. Identified by key molecular
  components as outlined in the text. Briefly, high p53 levels (0 and 0.25 ng/ml)
  slow down DNA replication by complex formation with POLι and idling () triggering
  HLTF- and ZRANB3- mediated fork remodeling at the highest p53 level (0 ng/ml). Low
  p53 levels (2.5 ng/ml) unleash fast DNA synthesis through TLS activities e.g. by
  POLι or POLη. At minimal p53 levels (4500 ng/ml) and reduced level of its target
  gene product POLη, PRIMPOL plays a key role in elongating DNA replication tracks.
  Such unrestrained repriming entails DNA replication stress and sensitizes cells
  to exogenous replication stress. An additional role of PRIMPOL in fork slow-down
  at high p53 levels (0 and 0.25 ng/ml) may involve repression of fast TLS such as
  initiated by POLη and/or gap formation promoting recombination-mediated template
  switch (). REV1 as TLS-POL loader, REV3L as TLS extender of TLS-POLs () and gap
  filler post-PRIMPOL (,) as well as HLTF promoting mono- and poly-ubiquitination
  of PCNA (,,,) are epistatic with multiple activities.
