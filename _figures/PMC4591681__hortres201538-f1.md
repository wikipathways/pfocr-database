caption: Simplified ethylene pathway. (a) Basal production of ethylene in the flowers
  during development before senescence. (b) The ethylene pathway upon triggering.
  The stimulus is translated to elevated ethylene synthesis producing higher levels
  of ethylene which inactivates the receptors initiating the signaling cascade which
  changes gene expression and finally induces physiological processes in the flower
  which may include the initiation of an autocatalytic loop. (c) Simplified molecular
  events of the ethylene pathway. Methionine is enzymatically converted to S-adenosyl-l-methionine
  (SAM) by SAM synthase (SAS). SAM is partially converted back to methionine via several
  steps, but it also produces 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase
  (ACS). ACC is transformed to ethylene by ACC oxidase (ACO). Ethylene binds to receptors
  and stops their signal to CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1), which then stops
  its suppressing signal to ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). The released EIN2 is then
  cleaved and part of it is transported into the nucleus where activation of the ETHYLENE
  INSENSITIVE3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE (EIN3/EIL) transcription factor family occurs.
  This initiates a transcription cascade by activation of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORs
  (ERFs) which eventually leads to differential gene expression and a physiological
  response.
