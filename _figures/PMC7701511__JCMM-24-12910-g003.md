caption: VEGFA/VEGFR2 system differentially modulates the UPR activation in condition
  of transient or sustained ER stress. A, In physiology, UPR is activated by the VEGF/VEGFR2
  system in the absence of ER stress. The VEGF/VEGFR2 system activates both PERK and
  ATF6 resulting in cell survival and inhibition of the pro‐apoptotic pathway CHOP
  favouring a cells’ survival. B, AKI mediates (transient) ER stress and PERK and
  ATF6 activation, which, in turn, drive an up‐regulation of VEGFA. VEGFA, with an
  autocrine/paracrine mechanism, activates PERK and ATF6 via VEGFR2 activation. The
  balance between VEGFA/VEGFR2 system and transient UPR‐mediated PERK and ATF6 activation
  results in lack of stimulation of CHOP‐mediated cell apoptosis, cell survival and
  tissue repair. C, CKD after AKI or CKD is characterized by sustained ER stress and
  UPR stimulation. Sustained ER stress‐mediated UPR activation results in CHOP‐mediated
  cell apoptosis. The sustained stimulation of PERK up‐regulates the VEGFA/VEGFR2
  system resulting in a synergistic (VEGFA/UPR) activation of CHOP and cell apoptosis
  resulting in tissue injury
