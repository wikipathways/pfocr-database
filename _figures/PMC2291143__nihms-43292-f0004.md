caption: a | After fertilization, parallel arrays of cortical microtubules extend
  from the centriole and the large aster at the sperm entry point towards the dorsal
  side (where the plus end lies), and transport small membrane vesicles from the vegetal
  towards the dorsal animal pole. The inset shows that the dorsal determinant vesicles
  are associated with Dishevelled (Dsh), a component of the Wnt signal transduction
  pathway. The Wnt receptor Frz7 is required for dorsal axis formation, but the Wnt
  molecules shown inside the vesicles are entirely hypothetical. Kinesins are molecular
  motors that can transport vesicles towards the plus ends of microtubules. β-Catenin
  is found in a large cytoplasmic complex that includes Axin, APC (adenomatous polyposis
  coli) and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). GSK-3 negatively regulates β-Catenin
  through phosphorylations that target β-Catenin for degradation by the proteasome.
  GSK-3 can be inhibited by treatment with lithium chloride (LiCl). On stimulation
  of the Wnt pathway, β-Catenin is stabilized on the dorsal side and can be found
  in the nucleus, where, together with TCF-3, it activates various target genes, including
  homeobox and Nodal-related genes (Xnrs). Further molecules that participate in this
  canonical Wnt signalling pathway are not shown in this simplified diagram. b | Irradiation
  of embryos with ultraviolet light disrupts cortical microtubules and prevents the
  transport of the membrane vesicles to the prospective dorsal side.
