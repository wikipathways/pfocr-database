caption: 'Number of annotated genes and DEGs related to terpenoid biosynthetic pathway
  in German chamomile (green) and Roman chamomile (yellow) Compound names are shown
  below each arrow. Abbreviations beside the arrows indicate the enzymes catalyzing
  the reaction. The numbers written in black indicate the total number of genes in
  this pathway; numbers in red show the number of up-regulated (green: MC_DF vs MC-RF;
  yellow CN_DF vs CN -RF) genes, and those in green show the number of down-regulated
  (green: MC_DF vs MC-RF; yellow CN_DF vs CN -RF) genes'
