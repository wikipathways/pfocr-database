caption: 'The figure displays the putative biosynthetic pathway of plumbagin. (SCOT
  = succinyl-CoA: 3-ketoacid CoA transferase; CYP = cytochromes, CO2 = carbon dioxide,
  CoA = coenzyme A). Pathway is not completely illustrated, and all the corresponding
  genes have not been revealed. While the aromatic amino acid tyrosine appears as
  the remote precursor for the biosynthesis of plumbagin, isoshinanoline is the immediate
  precursor. Dotted lines indicate that the exact steps and enzymes for the conversion
  of isoshinanolone to plumbagin are unclear. However, oxidation reaction occurs in
  the final step of the pathway. Alanine, another amino acid (not shown in the pathway),
  may also participate in some plants in which plumbagin biosynthesis occurs'
