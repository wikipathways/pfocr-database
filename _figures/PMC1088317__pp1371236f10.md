caption: Schematic view of the proposed pathway of carbohydrates and amino acids in
  growing embryos. Suc imported into seeds is cleaved by Suc synthase or invertase.
  Hexose phosphates are either metabolized in the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate and/or
  imported as Glc-6-P into the amyloplasts toward starch synthesis. It is proposed
  that Asn and Gln are taken up from the apoplast. PEP carboxylase catalyzes the conversion
  of PEP and CO2 to oxaloacetate. 2-Oxo-glutarate and oxalacetate are used as the
  main carbon acceptors for amino acid biosynthesis. Changes in carbohydrate metabolites,
  amino acids, and enzymes are indicated by color code for embryos of the line AAP-12.
  Values, which are decreased in transgenic embryos compared to the wild type, appear
  in red. Metabolites, which are increased, are shown in green, based on the data
  from .
