caption: Tryptophan metabolic pathways. Tryptophan is metabolized by three pathways.
  More than 90% of dietary tryptophan is metabolized via the main kynurenine pathway
  mediated by the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-deoxygenase
  (TDO) leading to the production of important metabolites, such as kynurenine, kynurenic
  acid, quinolinic acid, and eventually nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+),
  and picolinic acid; the minor serotonin (5-HT) pathway via tryptophan hydroxylase
  (TPH), and the third the microbiota-dependent pathways to produce several key metabolites
  including ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated signaling, indole
  and its derivative.
