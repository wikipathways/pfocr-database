caption: Overlap of transcriptional reprogramming associated with secondary metabolism
  in basal and systemic defense. (A) Schematic showing commonality and differences
  in transcriptional induction of secondary metabolism pathways associated with defense.
  Arrows represent enzymes corresponding to transcripts significantly induced by DC3000hrpA
  (blue arrows), determined 12 hpi, and the systemic transcriptional reprogramming
  4 h after local challenge with DC3000(avrRpm1) (red arrows). Black arrows represent
  transcripts with no detectable change. PAL, phenylalanine ammonium lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate
  ligase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase. (B) Transcriptional
  induction of the JA biosynthetic pathway. Transcripts encoding JA biosynthesis enzymes
  were strongly induced systemically at 4 hpi with DC3000(avrRpm1). PLA, phospholipase
  A; AOS, allene oxide synthase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; OPR, 12-oxophytodienoate
  reductase 3; PKT, 3-keto-acyl-CoA-thiolase; ACX, fatty acyl-CoA oxidase; JMT, jasmonic
  acid methyl transferase.
