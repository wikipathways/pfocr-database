caption: A model for the function of RAN1 in the ethylene signaling pathway. RAN1
  is presumed to be localized in the membrane of a post-Golgi compartment. Copper
  ions received from CCH, a putative copper chaperon, is transported by RAN1 into
  a post-Golgi compartment, delivering the metal to membrane-targeted ethylene receptor
  apoproteins that become able to coordinate ethylene after the incorporation of copper
  ions. In the absence of the hormone, the receptors are active and negatively regulate
  downstream signaling components, preventing hormone-response phenotypes. Ethylene
  is expected to inactivate the receptors upon binding, presumably by causing a reduction
  in histidine kinase/phosphatase activity. This, in turn, results in derepression
  of downstream signaling components (EIN2, EIN3) and activation of hormone-response
  phenotypes. The metal-deficient ethylene receptors are nonfunctional, resulting
  in a constitutively activated signaling pathway.
