caption: Cross-talk between muscle (pink) and tendon (dark grey) cells in Drosophila.
  The MTJ (light grey) is formed through muscle-specific αPS2βPS integrin interaction
  with the tendon-secreted ECM component TSP and its regulator Slow. Laminin binds
  the αPS1βPS tendon-specific integrin via the molecular adaptator TSP. The αPS2βPS
  integrin intracellular signal is mediated by FAK and induced the expression of vein
  gene in muscle cell. Vein protein is deposited in intercellular space and links
  the tendinous EGF-receptor. Vein expression and deposition of the corresponding
  protein are regulated by moleskin. Interaction of Vein on EGF-R leads to the stripe
  gene expression via MAPK signaling. Stripe, which expression is also induced by
  wingless (wg) hedgehog (hh) pathway activation, is a central actor of tendon cell
  differentiation. This transcription factor induces the expression of tsp and slit
  genes. Slit binds ROBO at the muscle cell surface and LTR at the tendon cell surface.
  Wnt5 also provides a structural link between the muscular receptor ryk and the frizzled/LRP
  co-receptors.
