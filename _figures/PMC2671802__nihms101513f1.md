caption: 'ALPS and CEDS illustrate signaling pathways for lymphocyte apoptosis and
  activation. In the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (center of figure), death
  receptor stimulation, here typified by trimerized Fas, leads to recruitment of FADD
  adapter molecules, which in turn recruits the initiator caspases-8 (and/or caspase-10).
  Oligomerization causes caspase-8/-10 activation and cleavage of downstream effector
  caspases. Caspase-8 cleavage of BID, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family,
  feeds into a mitochondrial amplification loop in which apoptosome formation oligomerizes
  and activates caspase-9. During cytokine-withdrawal-induced apoptosis (left side
  of figure), interruption of IL-2-stimulated signaling leads to decreased activation
  of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This causes increased expression of BIM, another pro-apoptotic
  member of the BCL-2 family, which in turn triggers mitochondrial depolarization.
  Released cytochrome c from depolarized mitochondria assembles with Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  to form the apoptosome. Both the death receptor- and cytokine withdrawal-induced
  apoptosis pathways converge following activation of initiator caspases: these cleave
  and activate downstream effector caspases, which in turn cleave intracellular substrates,
  causing cell death. In the activation receptor induced signalosome (ARIS) (right
  side of figure), immunoreceptor stimulation leads to caspase-8-dependent recruitment
  of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex with the IKK complex. Caspase-8 linker and
  enzymatic function are required for optimal downstream NF-κB induction for lymphocyte
  activation. Mutations in the indicated signaling components that cause ALPS or CEDS
  are indicated. Death domains (DD), death effector domains (DED), and caspase recruitment
  domains (CARD) in relevant proteins containing these structures are as indicated.'
