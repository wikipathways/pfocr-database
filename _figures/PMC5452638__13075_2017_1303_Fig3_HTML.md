caption: 'Metabolic alterations involved in activated cells. Activated cells take
  up large amounts of glucose and glutamine and divert them to the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and lipid biosynthesis, respectively. Coupled to increased uptake
  of glycine, serine, and branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine),
  which are required for protein synthesis, this generates sufficient building blocks
  (nucleic acids, proteins, and membranes) for proliferation. The increased generation
  of reactive oxygen species requires appropriate levels of antioxidants, most of
  which originate from the PPP. These metabolic changes generate bioactive metabolites
  that are secreted, and that also contribute to cell activation. Abbreviations: 3-PG
  3-phosphoglycerate, A-KG α-ketoglutarate, CoA coenzyme A, G6P glucose-6-phosphate,
  LPA lysophosphatidic acid, L-AA L-amino acids, R5P ribose-5-phosphate, S1P sphingosine-1-phosphate,
