caption: 'Signaling pathways regulating EMT. The encounter between specific ligands
  and epithelial cells results in the activation of several intracellular signaling
  pathways that ultimately lead to the expression of core EMT-TFs such as ZEB1/2,
  SNAI1/2, and TWIST1 that act pleiotropically to induce EMT. These pathways are not
  well compartmentalized, and some overlap exists to a certain extent between them.
  The canonical WNT pathway is activated upon the binding of WNT ligands to the Frizzled
  family of membrane receptors, ensuing the release of β-catenin from the GSK3β–AXIN-APC
  complex. This enables its translocation to the nucleus, thereby activating TCF and
  LEF-1 TFs, which promotes the expression of EMT-associated genes. The NOTCH pathway
  is activated upon binding of DDL or JAG ligands to the NOTCH receptor, leading to
  the release of the active NOTCH-ICD, which translocates to the nucleus to function
  as a transcriptional co-activator. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is activated by
  members of the Hedgehog (HH) ligand family that bind to PTCH receptor and activate
  SMO, which recruits GLI TFs, further entailing the transcription of EMT target genes.
  TGFβ activates the TGFβ family of receptors that trigger the phosphorylation and
  activation of cytoplasmic SMAD2 and SMAD3, which further assemble with SMAD4 to
  migrate to the nucleus, where they activate the transcription EMT-TFs. SMAD also
  interacts with β-catenin and NOTCH-ICD, enabling cross-talk between the TGF-β, WNT,
  and NOTCH pathways. The TGFβ pathway also collaborates with the PI3K–AKT pathway,
  which in turn triggers the activation of the mTOR and NF-κB and the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK
  signaling axis. These pathways are also triggered by the binding of several growth
  factors to their cognate receptors. The binding of several cytokines to their receptors
  triggers the phosphorylation and activation of JAKs and STATs. STAT dimers activate
  the transcription of genes encoding core EMT-TFs. Abbreviations: AKT: protein kinase
