caption: WNT plays stage-dependent contrary roles in both bone (A) and lung (B) metastasis.
  In osteolytic bone metastasis (of breast cancer, for example) and the early stage
  of osteoblastic bone metastasis (of prostate cancer, for example), tumor-derived
  transient high level of WNT inhibitor DKK1 suppresses osteoblast differentiation
  to osteocytes but enhances osteoclast differentiation. Bone matrix degradation ensues
  that releases growth factors to nurse disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) (A, left panel).
  In the late stage of osteoblastic bone metastasis, DKK1 level is tuned down to unleash
  osteoblast differentiation, leading to full-blown osteoblastic colonization (A,
  right panel). Similarly, in the early stage of lung metastasis (B, left panel),
  the transient high level of DKK1 maintains the quiescence of DTCs to allow evasion
  from immune surveillance by natural killer (NK) cells. Later, DKK1 level is tuned
  down and the activation of WNT signaling pathway supports outgrowth of lung metastasis
  (B, right panel).
