caption: Cellular sources and targeting of interleukin (IL)‐17. IL‐17A and IL‐17F
  are the signature cytokines of the T helper type 17 (Th17) cell subset. They may
  also be produced by CD8 T cells and innate‐like lymphoid cells, including innate
  lymphoid cells (ILC), invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and γδ T cells. IL‐17
  expression by myeloid cells including neutrophils and mast cells is suggested but
  not universally accepted. Dimers of IL‐17A, IL‐17F or IL‐17A/F bind to their IL‐17
  receptor (IL‐17RA/RC), which is expressed on epithelial cells. IL‐17C is produced
  by epithelial cells and binds to IL‐17RA/RE. IL‐17R signalling results in the expression
  of anti‐microbial peptides, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that promote inflammation
  via the recruitment of neutrophils and other immune cells. The inflammatory effects
  of IL‐17 signalling have been targeted directly via monoclonal antibody blockade
  of IL‐17A (secukinumab, ixekizumab), IL‐17A/F (bimekizumab) or the IL‐17 receptor
  IL‐17RA (brodalumab). Alternatively, the pathway can be targeted upstream of Th17
  cells by blocking IL‐23 alone via its specific p19 subunit (guselkumab, tildrakizumab,
  risankizumab), or both IL‐23 and IL‐12 via the common p40 subunit (ustekinumab).
