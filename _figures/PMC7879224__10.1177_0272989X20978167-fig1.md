caption: 'The disease model (ovals) interacts with the clinical pathway (rectangles).
  Death states are shown with triangles. This combination determines the timing of
  detection on a scan or symptomatic detection of metastases and second primary tumors.
  There are 4 parallel chains that operate simultaneously: 1) recurrences of the primary
  tumor, 2) the hazard of developing a second primary tumor (SPLC), 3) the hazard
  of becoming ineligible for surgery or chemotherapy, and 4) the hazard of death from
  other causes (DOC). As a result, patients can for instance simultaneously have recurrences,
  and a second primary tumor, and be untreatable. Patients can also die of cancer
  (DOD), or from the treatment (excess mortality). Death states are mutually exclusive.
  Example life histories are shown in Appendix 1.1.'
