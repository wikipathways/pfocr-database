caption: Effect of sphingolipids on the PI3K/AKT pathway. Upon phosphorylation of
  PIP2 to PIP3 in response to growth stimulatory signals, Akt and PDK1 (not shown)
  are recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of their pleckstrin homology domains.
  Once there, PDK phosphorylates and activates Akt, which in turn either activates
  or inhibits a large number of substrates by phosphorylating them, thus exerting
  influence over various cell functions. The schematic focuses on the role of Akt
  in inhibition of apoptosis. The Akt substrates that have an inhibitory role on apoptosis
  are depicted in dark blue rectangles and those that exert a positive influence (which
  phosphorylation by Akt abrogates) are shown in light blue ovals. The figure also
  illustrates how different sphingolipids might influence the pathway both negatively
  (Ceramide) or positively (S1P).
