caption: Androgen receptor structure and signaling pathway in PCa. (A) Representation
  of protein domains of AR. It comprises domains for transcription factor binding,
  DNA recognition, hormone binding/chaperone binding, and a nuclear localization signal
  (NLS). (B) Example crosstalk between AR and SPDEF. Interaction of DHT and AR leads
  to activation of SPDEF and its transport to the nucleus. The complex AR/SPDEF interacts
  with RNApol, thus activating the transcription of target genes, such as ZBTB46,
  TGFBI, and CCL2. In turn, SPDEF targets genes, such as ZBTB46, leading to upregulation
  of PTGS1, LIF, Snail, and CCL2 proteins involved in certain processes, such as tumor
  progression and metastasis. SPEDF activation leads to the activation of inflammatory-associated
  gene and cancer pathophysiology, cell proliferation, EMT, and metastasis that result
  in CRPC-NE differentiation and progression
