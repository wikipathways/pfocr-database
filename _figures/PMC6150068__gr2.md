caption: Proposed feedback loop mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Shown is the
  fragment of PDGF signaling that is mediated by PI3-kinase and PTEN and leads to
  PIP3 production. In addition to conventional chemotactic pathway to Rac GTPase and
  actin dynamics, PIP3 activates NOX assembly on the plasma membrane both directly
  and via Rac. NOX produces a superoxide anion radical, which is further converted
  to H2O2 as the final metabolite. H2O2 mediates potential feedback loops to the PDGF
  receptor, PTEN and cytoskeletal proteins, leading to maintained PDGF signaling and
  sustained migration. See the text for details.
