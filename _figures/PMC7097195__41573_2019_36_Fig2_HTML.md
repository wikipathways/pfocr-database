caption: After their synthesis in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), the substrates
  (cargo) that are intended to be degraded through the endo-lysosomal pathway are
  transported to lysosomes via the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Among the key enzymatic
  systems that are involved in the lysosomal enzyme transportation of cargos from
  Golgi to lysosomes, the best studied is the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (MPR)
  system, which binds newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases in the TGN and delivers
  them to pre-lysosomal compartments. A few components synthesized in the late Golgi
  compartment are delivered directly to lysosomes via the 3-alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
  pathway. Lysosomal components, such as enzymes (lytic enzymes and kinases), membrane-bound
  proteins/complexes (mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)), transporters and ion
  channels (vacuolar-type proton adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase), TRPML1 and osteopetrosis
  associated transmembrane protein 1 (Ostm1)) and chaperone-mediated transportation
  are the best-known targeting sites for lysosomal dysfunction. As depicted in the
  figure, many pharmacological antagonists and agonists exert activities that potentially
  correct lysosomal dysfunction and therefore represent potential effective pharmacological
  tools. CLEAR, coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation; CQ, chloroquine;
  HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; PtdIns(3,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate;
  RAPTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum;
  TFEB, transcription factor EB.
