caption: Proposed Natural Killer (NK) Cell developmental pathway in Humans. In the
  bone marrow, HPCs differentiate to form pro-NK cells which are able to differentiate
  into dendritic cells (DC), T cells and NK cells. It is proposed that some of these
  then migrate to the lymph nodes and tonsils, where they undergo further differentiation,
  whilst others remain and mature in the bone marrow. As pro-NK cells differentiate
  they gradually lose their ability to self renew and become more restricted in lineage
  potential. Immature NK (iNK) cells are restricted to form mature NK (mNK) cells
  but are themselves not functional. iNK cells differentiate into CD56bright CD16-
  mNK cells in vitro; however the precursors of CD56dim CD16+ remain uncertain. Following
  maturation, both CD16+ and CD16- mNK cells migrate to the blood. Here they play
  important roles in the immune response with CD16+ mNK cells being the main mediators
  of cytotoxicity and ADCC, and showing modest secretion of cytokines; whilst CD16-
  mNK cells appear to have a more immunoregulatory role, producing copious amounts
  of interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and other cytokines, but showing limited cytotoxic capabilities
  and an inability to perform ADCC.
