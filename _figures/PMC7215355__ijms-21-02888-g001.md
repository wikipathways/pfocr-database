caption: Modulation of lipid metabolic processes during HCV RNA replication, assembly,
  and egress. HCV alters cellular FA levels and changes lipid biosynthesis. Lipid
  transfer proteins are utilized to change the membrane lipid composition in order
  to efficiently establish vesicular replication compartments. Besides replication
  vesicles, phagophore membranes also support HCV RNA replication, connecting autophagy
  to HCV RNA replication. Different lipid-modulating host proteins localize to HCV
  assembly sites in close proximity to LDs and shape the emerging virions. HCV particles
  exit the cell at least partially via the canonical secretory pathway. Alternatively,
  secretion occurs via late endosomes/MVBs. See text for details.
