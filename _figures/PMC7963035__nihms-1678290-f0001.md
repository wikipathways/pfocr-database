caption: a | Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic pathways. NAD+
  levels are maintained by three independent biosynthetic pathways. The kynurenine
  pathway (or de novo synthesis pathway) uses the dietary amino acid tryptophan to
  generate NAD+. Tryptophan enters the cell via the transporters SLC7A5 and SLC36A4.
  Within the cell, tryptophan is converted to N-formylkynurenine by the rate-limiting
  enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or the rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan
  2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). N-Formylkynurenine is transformed into l-kynurenine, which
  is further converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
  (KMO) and to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (KYNU).
  The next step is performed by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3HAO) to generate
  α-amino-β-carboxymuconate ε-semialdehyde (ACMS). This compound can spontaneously
  condense and rearrange into quinolinic acid, which is transformed by quinolinate
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NAMN), at which
  point it converges with the Preiss–Handler pathway. The Preiss–Handler pathway uses
  dietary nicotinic acid (NA), which enters the cell via SLC5A8 or SLC22A13 transporters,
  and the enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to generate NAMN,
  which is then transformed into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) by nicotinamide
  mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNAT1, NMNAT2 and NMNAT3). The process is
  completed by the transformation of NAAD into NAD+ by NAD+ synthetase (NADS). The
  NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide (NAM) generated as a by-product of
  the enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes (sirtuins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases
  (PARPs) and the NAD+ glycohydrolase and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases CD38, CD157
  and SARM1). Initially, the intracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (iNAMPT) recycles NAM into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then converted
  into NAD+ via the different NMNATs. NAM can be alternatively methylated by the enzyme
  nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and secreted via the urine. In the extracellular
  space, NAM is generated as a by-product of the ectoenzymes CD38 and CD157 and can
  be converted to NMN by extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT). NMN is then dephosphorylated
  by CD73 to nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is transported into the cell via an
  unknown nucleoside transporter (question mark). NMN can be imported into the cell
  via an NMN-specific transporter (SLC12A8 in the small intestine). Intracellularly,
  NR forms NMN via nicotinamide riboside kinases 1 and 2 (NRK1 and NRK2). NMN is then
  converted to NAD+ by NMNAT1, NMNAT2 and NMNAT3. b | NAD+ metabolism in different
  subcellular compartments. The NAD+ homeostasis is a balance of synthesis, consumption
  and regeneration in different subcellular compartments, which are regulated by subcellular-specific
  NAD+-consuming enzymes, subcellular transporters and redox reactions. NAD+ precursors
  enter the cell via the three biosynthetic pathways (part a). In the cytoplasm, NAM
  is converted to NMN by intracellular NAMPT (iNAMPT). NMN is then converted to NAD+
  by NMNAT2, which is the cytosol-specific isoform of this enzyme. NAD+ is utilized
  during glycolysis, generating NADH, which is transferred to the mitochondrial matrix
  via the malate/aspartate shuttle and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate shuttle. The
  mitochondrial NADH imported via the malate/aspartate shuttle is oxidized by complex
  I in the electron transport chain (ETC), whereas the resulting reduced flavin adenine
  dinucleotide (FADH2) from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate shuttle is oxidized by
  complex II. Recently the mammalian NAD+ mitochondrial transporter SLC25A51 was identified,
  and it has been demonstrated to be responsible for intact NAD+ uptake in the organelle.
  The salvage pathway for NAD+ in mitochondria has not been fully resolved, but the
  role of a specific NMNAT isoform (NMNAT3) has been proposed. In the mitochondria,
  NAD+ is consumed by NAD+-dependent mitochondrial SIRT3–SIRT5, generating NAM. It
  is still unknown whether NAM can be converted back to NMN or can be converted to
  NAD+ within the mitochondrion, or whether other precursors can be transported through
  the mitochondrial membrane to fuel NAD+synthesis. The nuclear NAD+ pool probably
  equilibrates with the cytosolic one by diffusion through the nuclear pore; however,
  the full dynamics are still largely unexplored. A nuclear-specific NMNAT isoform
  (NMNAT1) has been described and is part of the nuclear NAM salvage NAD+pathway.
