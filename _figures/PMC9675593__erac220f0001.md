caption: Phytochromes (phys), cryptochromes (CRYs), and HY5 integrate light and retrograde
  signals from the chloroplast to tune nuclear genome responses to a changing environment.
  (A) MEcPP tuning of phyB-modulated growth responses. Chloroplast stress-induced
  MEcPP accumulation increases the abundance of phyB-Pr protein. Red light-activated
  phyB-Pfr translocates to the nucleus to inhibit PIF activity, and target hormonal
  pathways to halt hypocotyl elongation. In addition to inhibiting PIF activity, phyB
  promotes HY5 accumulation. In a feedback loop, HY5 and PIFs antagonistically regulate
  the transcriptional accumulation of DXS and DXR, two of the rate-limiting steps
  in the MEP pathway from which MEcPP derives. (B) High light- (HL) induced stress
  responses are dependent on photoreceptor and HY5 activity. HL stress induces damage
  to the photosynthetic apparatus, triggering the release of retrograde signalling
  molecules including H2O2 and oxylipins, which target the phy-, CRY-, and HY5-dependent
  activation of PhANG expression and photoprotective responses including chlorophyll
  and carotenoid biosynthesis. (C) A GUN1-dependent pathway inhibits PhANG accumulation
  to halt photomorphogenesis in response to chloroplast stress. GUN1 antagonistically
  inhibits phy-mediated photomorphogenesis through a GUN1:GLK1 complex that down-regulates
  BBX16-mediated PhANG expression. CRY1 and HY5 also co-target GUN1-dependent PhANG
  accumulation in a converging pathway, contributing to the responsiveness of PhANGs
  to chloroplast stress.
