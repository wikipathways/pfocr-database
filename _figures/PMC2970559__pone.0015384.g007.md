caption: The canonical signaling pathway of LPS-TLR engagement leads to NFκB dependent
  pro-inflammatory cytokine production through the interaction of CBP with NFκB. However,
  TLR signaling has also been shown to weakly activate alternative signaling through
  PI3K, resulting in phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, subsequent sequestration
  of CBP from NFκB to phospho-CREB, and resultant anti-inflammatory (IL-10) production.
  Our results show that the presence of HGF enhances the IL-10 pathway. We postulate
  that in order to resolve inflammation, the generation of IL-6 by LPS-TLR signaling
  leads to the production of HGF, ultimately leading to the inhibition of inflammation.
  Hence, we propose HGF acts as an internal rheostat for resolving acute phase inflammatory
  responses.
