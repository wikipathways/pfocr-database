caption: DSB repair pathways. Repair pathway choice is influenced by blocking or initiating
  end resection. Typical regulatory proteins of these pathways are indicated. At the
  molecular level, pathway choice is determined by either 53BP1 or BRCA1 and CtIP.
  CtIP and the MRN complex are involved in extensive 5′ to 3′ resection of the duplex-DNA
  to generate stretches of single-stranded (ss)-DNA at DNA ends for HR, SSA, and MMEJ.
  In HR repair, the ssDNA overhangs resulting from DNA end resection are coated with
  RPA, which is subsequently replaced by RAD51 in a BRCA2-DSS1 complex-dependent manner.
  RAD51 mediated strand exchange and its association with BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD54
  are essential for the further promotion of the HR pathway.
