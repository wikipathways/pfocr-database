caption: Model of regulatory role of cholesterol dynamics in the insulin secretory
  pathway. During proinsulin synthesis and vesicular transport from the ER, there
  is parallel nonvesicular transport of cholesterol from the ER to the TGN that is
  mediated by OSBP acting at interorganellar contacts. Cholesterol transport along
  this pathway simultaneously aids in maintaining the low cholesterol content of the
  ER and provides cholesterol that is essential for supporting the normal level of
  stable insulin granule formation. At the TGN, ABCG1- and ABCA1-driven phospholipid
  translocation and cholesterol redistribution to the inner membrane leaflet promotes
  formation of new cholesterol-enriched membranes of nascent insulin granules. Deficiency
  in either OSBP or ABCG1 augments lysosomal degradation of young insulin granules,
  whereas deficiency of ABCA1 has a smaller effect at this level. The possible pathways
  of granule degradation (1 vs. 2) are discussed in the text. Exogenous cholesterol
  suppresses degradation in ABCG1-deficient cells but not in OSBP-deficient cells.
  The total granule pool that has escaped lysosomal degradation is nevertheless still
  affected by deficiency of ABCG1, ABCA1, or OSBP as indicated by their diminished
  exocytosis upon glucose stimulation.
