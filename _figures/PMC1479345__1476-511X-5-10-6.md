caption: 'Pathway analysis. Figures 3-7 represent signaling pathways for 58 focus
  genes selected from Table 3 by Ingenuity Systems software (Redwood City, CA. The
  following signaling cascades are shown: JUN, TNF, and CDKN2A signaling cascade affecting:
  DNA replication; recombination and repair; immune response; and cell cycle (Fig.
  3); TGFB1 signaling cascade affecting: cell morphology; cancer; and tumor morphology
  (Fig. 4); CTNB1 signaling cascade affecting: cell signaling; gene expression; and
  cell cycle (Fig. 5); INS1/hRAS signaling cascade affecting: carbohydrate metabolism;
  endocrine disorders; and metabolic disease (Fig. 6); and MYC signaling cascade affecting:
  viral function; gene expression; and cell Cycle (Fig. 7). Differentiating groups
  (per Table 3) are overlaid onto the signaling diagrams, and abbreviated: FU, fungal;
  FI, fish oil; CO, combination diet. When CO was the differentiating group, absolute
  differences between FU and FI are indicated. Intracellular location of focus genes
  (subscripts) are annotated: C, cytoplasm; E, extracellular; N, nucleus; P, plasma
  membrane; U, unknown. Major canonical functional/signaling categories associated
  with genes in the figures identified by the software, are shown in yellow boxes.'
