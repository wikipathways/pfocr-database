caption: After stimulation by TNFα (1), the CYLD/SPATA2/LUBAC complex (just pre-existing
  in the cytosol (2) is recruited into the receptor complex I through the interaction
  of LUBAC with the ubiquitin chains present in the complex (3). At the same time,
  the direct interaction of SPATA2 with CYLD results in an increase in the enzymatic
  activity of the latter which mediates the de-ubiquitylation (4) of some complex
  components such as RIPK1–thus playing a fundamental role in attenuating the signaling
  pathway triggered by TNFα. Therefore, activated CYLD attenuates NF-kB pro-inflammatory
  signaling and MAPK pro-cell-survival response (5). Alternatively, a second complex
  (named complex 2) can form by recruiting, among other factors, RIPK1, FADD, and
  caspase-8–thus resulting in the induction of apoptotic cell death (6). If caspase-8
  is inhibited, assembly following TNF stimulation promotes an alternative complex
  2 with MLKL leading to necroptotic cell death (7).
