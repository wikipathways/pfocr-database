caption: The major biochemical pathway of RAP2-Hippo-YAP in mechanical transduction.
  The RAP2-Hippo-YAP pathway is the most determined one of biochemical sensor pathway.
  The overloading pressure would inactivate the RAP2 and then turn off Hippo signaling.
  Then, the YAP would be dephosphorylated and translocated in to nucleus. VGLL4 demonstrated
  a competition role with YAP in binding to TEAD1. The exceeding mechanical stress
  would activate YAP and up-regulated hypertrophic genes, leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction in adulthood.
