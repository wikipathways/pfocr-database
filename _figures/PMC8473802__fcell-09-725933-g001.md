caption: 'Schematic overview of the pathways involved in germ cell damage caused by
  HIF-1α. In the presence of oxygen, prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate the HIF-1α,
  which generates a binding site for the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, a component
  of the ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to proteasomal degradation of HIF-α. During
  hypoxia, the enzymatic activity of PHDs is inhibited, leading to stabilization of
  HIF-1α subunits. After translocation to the nucleus, they complex with their β subunit
  and bind to hypoxia responsive elements (HREs). The genes activated by HIF perform
  the following functions in germ cells: apoptosis, which is caused by VEGF/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, mitochondrial pathway, death receptor pathway and miR210/KLF7
  pathway; Proliferation inhibition, which is caused by activating VEGF transcription.
  Hypoxia can also upregulate the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I, and downregulate
  the expression of P62 to promote germ cell autophagy.'
