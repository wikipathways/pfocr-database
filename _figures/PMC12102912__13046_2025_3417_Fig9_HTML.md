caption: 'Mechanistic illustration: ITGB3-knockdown enhances osteogenic differentiation
  and radiosensitizes osteosarcoma cells via JNK/c-JUN/RUNX2 pathway activation. There
  is a synergistic interaction between ITGB3 knockdown and irradiation in activating
  the JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. Upon the elevation of phosphorylated JNK expression,
  an increase in the expression of phosphorylated c-JUN occurs, which then upregulates
  osteogenic markers, including RUNX2, OCN, and OPN, thereby suggesting the enhancement
  of osteogenic differentiation in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, the upregulation
  of RUNX2 promotes apoptosis by activating BAX, which subsequently enhances the expression
  of cleaved caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis. The osteogenic differentiation enhanced
  through osteogenic differentiation medium culture also exerts a proapoptotic radiosensitizing
  effect on osteosarcoma cells'
