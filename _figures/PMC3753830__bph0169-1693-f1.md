caption: Schematic overview of signalling pathways and drug targets currently under
  investigation in CML research. Standard therapy against BCR-ABL with TKI effectively
  inhibits the kinase activity of the oncoprotein and results in apoptosis in the
  more mature progenitor cells; however, the quiescent LSCs are less sensitive to
  treatment and studies have shown these cells undergo survival pathway autophagy.
  Based on positive pre-clinical data, autophagy inhibitors are being investigated
  in combination with TKI treatment. The transformation of a HSC into a LSC alters
  key processes including acetylation, nuclear transport and the expression of genes
  including FOXO, PML, ALOX, PP2A and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Several inhibitors/activators
  of these genes/pathways are under investigation alone and in combination with TKI
  treatment. Normal HSC undergo self-renewal and the key self-renewal genes have been
  identified as playing a role in CML. Targets of the key pathways including Wnt,
  β-catenin and hedgehog are currently under investigation. Chemokine/cytokine signalling
  involving the HSC and accessory cells within the bone marrow stem cell niche is
  altered in CML and compounds are being tested to target this signalling using inhibitors
  against CXCR4 and JAK. IFN-α in combination with TKI shows promising data in CML;
  however, the mechanism of action is not well understood and is likely to be complex,
  involving other cell types and niche interactions.
