caption: F. tularensis lipoproteins trigger TLR2 signaling in macrophages , which
  results in the MyD88-dependent upregulation of miR-155 by 18 h post-infection ().
  This microRNA is part of a negative feedback loop that confers downregulation of
  MyD88 and SHIP-1 by translational repression (). Loss of MyD88 impairs further TLR2
  and IL-1 receptor signaling, and as such curtails inflammation, including TNFα secretion
  (). In contrast, depletion of SHIP-1 enhances signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway
  , , , which is critical for macrophage survival as well as chemotaxis, macropinocytosis
  and phagocytosis – (). We therefore propose that downregulation of MyD88 impairs
  host defense, whereas depletion of SHIP-1 may favor MDM survival and bacterial dissemination
  during tularemia.
