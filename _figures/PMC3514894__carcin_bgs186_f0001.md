caption: Interconnected signaling cascades for CS-mediated pancreatic injury. CS produces
  various components, including nicotine, nitrosamines (NNK), and PAH that cause the
  pancreatic injury. (A) Both nicotine and NNK are selective agonists for α7nAChR,
  which upon binding causes the cell depolarization and lead to an enhanced influx
  of cations including calcium ions through voltage-dependent channels. Calcium ions
  mediate the nicotine entry into the pancreatic cells inducing altered exocrine pancreatic
  secretions associated with pancreatic injury. Enhanced calcium influx triggers the
  release and synthesis of excitatory neurotransmitters (adrenalin and noradrenalin)
  that activates the adenylyl cyclase downstream of Gαs-coupled receptors. GABA normally
  balances these effects by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase downstream of the Gαi-coupled
  GABA receptor through a α4β2nAChR-dependent mechanism. Both nicotine and NNK desensitizes
  the α4β2nAChR, hence inhibiting the release and synthesis of GABA and virtually
  shutting down all inhibitory GABA signaling. (B) NNK and nicotine leads to the stimulation
  of the cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis either by the direct activation
  of the β-adrenoreceptor-mediated signaling via cAMP/PKA/p-CREB or indirectly by
  regulating the release and synthesis of EGF, VEGF, or arachidonic acid and PKA-mediated
  transactivation of EGFR. This leads to the nicotine/NNK-mediated indirect induction
  of the Ras-Raf-MEK ERK pathway. (C) MAPK pathway and nicotine/α7nAChR-mediated JAK2/STAT3
  pathway further stimulates the upregulation of the genes such as MYC, CYP, KRAS,
  FOS, and JUN in the nucleus, inhibiting the apoptosis of the cells and causing cells
  to proliferate and grow. (D) Nicotine elicits a prometastatic response in pancreatic
  cells by stimulation of osteopontin production through α7 nAChR-dependent mechanism.
  Nicotine can also induce through EGFR/AKT/NFκB-mediated pathways, changes in gene
  expression consistent with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). PAH also
  contributes to the cell metastasis by inducing the release of arachidonic acid and
  inhibiting the gap junctional intercellular communication. (E) The carcinogens NNK
  and PAH can be metabolically activated to intermediates that react with DNA, forming
  DNA adducts resulting in the mutation of crucial genes such as KRAS gene. If the
  DNA adducts are repaired by cellular repair enzymes, DNA is returned to its normal
  undamaged state. Nicotine is able to enhance the production of ROS, which plays
  an important role in inhibiting the DNA repair mechanism of the cell. Also, increase
  in the ROS has been directly linked to the lipid peroxidation leading to the pancreatic
  injury. Cells with damaged or mutated DNA can be removed by apoptosis, which is
  inhibited by nicotine as it regulates EGFR leading to activation of the serine threonine
  kinase, AKT, and other factors such as NFκB and Bcl2, causing decreased apoptosis.
