caption: The effect of the IR on the expression of the IGF-1Ec isoform. GH binding
  to GHR leads to IGF-1Ea upregulation through JAK2/STA5 pathway. In a similar manner,
  IL-6 is initially produced by the cells of the immune system attacking prostate
  tumor. Binding of IL-6 on IL-6R leads to the upregulation of the IGF-1Ec isoform
  and to the secretion of PEc as well as to IL-6 secretion from prostate cancer cells,
  by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. PEc secretion leads to tumor progression and
  metastases acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner and it mobilizes MSC towards
  the tumor, prior to repair
papertitle: IL-6 is associated to IGF-1Ec upregulation and Ec peptide secretion, from
  prostate tumors.
