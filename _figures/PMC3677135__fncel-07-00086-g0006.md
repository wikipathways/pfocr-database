caption: The canonical Shh signaling pathway. In the absence of Shh, Gli transcription
  factors are proteolytically processed to repressor forms (GliR), which block the
  transcription of target genes. Shh binding to the 12-pass transmembrane receptor
  Patched (Ptc) relieves the inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), which in turn promotes
  the accumulation of the activator forms of Gli (GliA) while suppressing GliR production.
  The regulation of Gli activity occurs via an intracellular complex composed of Fused
  (Fu), Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) and possibly other components (?).
