caption: 'Aβ oligomers activate several ‘stress-response’ kinase pathways in neurons.
  (A) Oligomeric Aβ as well as increased intracellular calcium flux, induced either
  by NMDA receptor activation or membrane depolarization through opening of voltage-gated
  calcium channels (VGCC), can activate the CAMKK2-AMPK pathway. AMPK over-activation
  leads to increased phosphorylation of Tau at S262 which results in dendritic spine
  loss. Furthermore, AMPK promotes autophagy, which is abnormally activated in AD,
  by acting on three main pathways: (1) indirectly, by inhibiting mTORC1 (mTOR complex
  1, which inhibits autophagy) through phosphorylation of Raptor and/or TSC2 (Tuberous
  Sclerosis Complex 2); (2) directly, by activating ULK1/2 (Unc-51 Like Kinases),
  the mammalian orthologs of yeast ATG1, an upstream regulator of the autophagy pathway;
  and (3) via Beclin1 phosphorylation which promotes its assembly with class III PI3-kinase
  (PIK3c3; also named Vps34) and ATG14L. The two question marks represent ways whereby
  AMPK has been shown to regulate autophagy in non-neuronal cells but not in neurons
  yet. (B) mTOR inhibition further results in a protein translation block which causes
  widespread ER stress, leading to JNK3 activation. In turn, JNK3 phosphorylates APP
  at T688, promoting its endocytosis and processing by secretases, consequently increasing
  Aβ40/42 biogenesis. (C) The AMPK-related kinases MARKs can also phosphorylate Tau
  at ADrelevant epitopes (KXGS motifs) to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ oligomers,
  although the upstream pathway leading to their activation in mammalian neurons is
  currently unclear, and could be either LKB1 or CAMKK2 [].'
