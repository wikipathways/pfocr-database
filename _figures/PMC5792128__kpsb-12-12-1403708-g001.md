caption: A model hypothesizing the role of OsGSK5 in integrating salt stress responses
  to starch metabolism. Upon perception of salt, an ABA- and/or BR-dependent salt
  signaling pathway relays the signal to OsGSK5 by enhancing either its expression
  level and/or its activity (Step 1). OsGSK5, presumably localized to the amyloplast,
  then phosphorylates SS and increases its starch synthesis activity (Step 2). It
  is widely accepted that phosphorylation is an important mechanism in the regulation
  of starch metabolism. Another potential phosphorylation target of OsGSK5 may be
  cytosolic G6PD, resulting in its ROS detoxification activity (Step 3). For clarity,
  other subcellular compartments are not shown. Processes with questions marks are
  unproven or speculative.
