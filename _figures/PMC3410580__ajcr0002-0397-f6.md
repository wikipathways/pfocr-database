caption: p62/SQSTM1 acts either as a pro-oncogene or as a tumor suppressor protein.
  Based on the presence of multiple interacting domains in p62/SQSTM1, this protein
  is able to positively modulate either the NFκB pathway by binding to the IKK activator
  TRAF6 or the mTOR pathway by interacting with Raptor. The interaction of p62 with
  Raptor and, subsequently, mTORC1 involves the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal
  membrane to promote Rag GTPase-mediated mTOR activation. During tumor development,
  this intricate link between p62 and the NFκB and mTOR pathways appears to be indispensable
  because the knockdown of p62 reduces the tumorigenicity related to hyperactivation.
  In contrast to its pro-oncogenic activity, p62 can also exert tumor a suppressive
  activity by promoting inactivation of the Wnt pathway via an autophagic process.
  Indeed, the Dsh protein that relays the signal of the activated Wnt pathway is ubiquitinated
  during starvation and associates with p62 before its degradation by the autophagic
  machinery. In this particular context, p62 acts as a tumor suppressive autophagic
  adaptor.
