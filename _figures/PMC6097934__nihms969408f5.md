caption: Proposed mechanism of action of PAC-1 combination therapy with clinically
  approved kinase inhibitors examined in this work. Shown kinase inhibitors target
  key oncogenic driver kinases, leading to transient inhibition of signaling through
  MEK. Of critical importance is the ability of PAC-1 treatment to induce cleavage
  of MEK kinases. This MEK cleavage, in conjunction with upstream pathway inhibition,
  potently abolishes ERK phosphorylation and hinders pro-survival and proliferation
  signaling.
