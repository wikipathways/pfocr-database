caption: Microtubule stabilizers polymerize tubulin in the microtubule, thereby inhibiting
  cell division. Anthracyclines inhibit RNA synthesis by intercalating between base
  pairs of the DNA/RNA strand, thus preventing the replication of rapidly growing
  cancer cells. Platinums generate intra- and inter-strand double-stranded DNA crosslinks,
  preventing the formation of the replication fork and inhibiting cell division. PARP
  inhibitors prevent the repair of single-strand breaks that occur during cell cycle
  especially in BRCA-mutated cells. Angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new
  blood vessels by inhibiting VEGF. EGFR inhibitors bind to EGFR and turn off the
  uncontrolled growth of cancer cells with EGFR mutations. TK inhibitors block tumor
  growth through inhibiting intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. mTOR inhibitors
  suppress cancer cell growth and proliferation through targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Statins inhibit the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the
  cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. The anti-cancer effects of statins may involve
  the inhibition of multiple signaling pathways important for the malignant phenotype
  of cancer cells. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TK, tyrosine
  kinase.
