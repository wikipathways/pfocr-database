caption: 'Glucose metabolism is comprised of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) in the cytoplasm and TCA cycle in the mitochondria. Both glycolysis and PPP
  are upregulated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Glucose, transported in to the cells
  by GLUT and SGLT transporters, undergoes glycolysis to generate pyruvate which then
  goes through TCA cycle to generate ATP. In cancer cells, the flux of pyruvate entering
  TCA cycle decreases and the majority of pyruvate undergoes lactic acid fermentation
  for the rapid production of ATP. The MCT family of lactate transporters are upregulated
  in cancer cells, leading to increased efflux of lactate; and lactate accumulation
  results in an immunosuppressive extracellular environment. In cancer cells, increased
  PPP supplies the ribose sugar for the nucleotide synthesis necessary for rapidly
  growing cells. The oncogenes like HIF, AKT, STAT3 and EZH2 are known to influence
  the glucose transport and metabolism at multiple steps in RCC cells. The metabolites
  are depicted by squares and enzymes or transporters are denoted by ovals. Green
