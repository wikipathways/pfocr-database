caption: 'Adaptive antiviral immunity in plants: general model of antiviral RNA silencing
  and its suppression by viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). The Silencing
  response is triggered by viral dsRNA molecules (vsRNA, ds-siRNA, 21, 22 rr 24 nt)
  from different sources, which are produced by Dicer-like proteins (DCLs). These
  vsRNAs are subsequently loaded into Argonaute (AGO)-containing silencing complexes.
  In post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), viral RNA is targeted by the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC) for degradation or translational repression, while the
  RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex (RITS) causes histone and/or DNA methylation,
  leading to transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). The effector phase can also result
  in the amplification of silencing response through the action of RNA-dependent RNA
  polymerase (RDR) proteins, which produce more dsRNA substrates for DCL processing.
  VSRs can target multiple steps of the RNA silencing pathway, defeating host antiviral
  mechanisms by interfering in dicing, vsRNA loading, AGO activation and amplification.'
