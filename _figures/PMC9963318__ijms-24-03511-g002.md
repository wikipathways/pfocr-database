caption: MYC2 is involved in the synthesis of plant specialized metabolites. (a) MYC2
  is involved in the regulation of paclitaxel biosynthesis by regulating ERF12 and
  ERF15. (b) MYC2 can regulate the expression of key enzymes involved in artemisinin
  biosynthesis, such as CYP71AV1, AaDBR2, and AaALDH1. (c) MYC2 regulates the expression
  of CYP98A14 to regulate the synthesis of Salvia miltiorrhiza specialized metabolites.
  (d) MYC2 affects vinblastine biosynthesis by regulating the transcription of ORCA2,
  ORCA3, and ORCA4. (e) MYC2 can directly regulate the expression of key enzymes in
  the gossypol synthesis pathway, such as CYP71BE79, and participate in the regulation
  of gossypol synthesis.
