caption: '. First, chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the condensation of one molecule
  of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA. The later steps in this
  pathway are catalyzed by a series of enzymes, leading to the production of three
  main types of final products: flavonols (including quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin);
  anthocyanins; and proanthocyanidins (PAs). CHS chalcone synthase, CHI chalcone isomerase,
