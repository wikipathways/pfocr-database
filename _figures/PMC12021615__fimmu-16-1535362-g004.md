caption: The role of other E3s and DUBs in NAFLD. (1) FASN may activate hepatic lipid
  synthesis, SNX8 can recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 to degrade FASN protein,
  and TRIM56 can also trigger FASN proteasomal pathway degradation, slowing the progression
  of NAFLD. (2) Kindlin-2 can bind to Foxo1 and inhibit Skp2 mediated ubiquitination
  of Foxo1 protein, enhancing its protein stability and leading to hepatic steatosis.
  (3) Acly is an enzyme that facilitates the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Hrd1, an
  E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinates and degrades Acly, which inhibits liver fat synthesis.
  Other research has found that overexpression of Hrd1 worsens hepatic steatosis,
  inflammation, and fibrosis. The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 can ubiquitinate and degrade
  Hrd1, slowing the progression of NASH. (4) USP15 deubiquitinates FABPs and Perilipins,
  increasing their stability and promoting liver lipid accumulation. (5) E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Ubr1 improves hepatic steatosis by degrading Plin2. When essential amino
  acids are deficient, Ubr1 becomes inactive, and increased Plin2 protein levels limit
  liver lipolysis, resulting in NAFLD in lean individuals. (6) The E3 ubiquitin ligase
  UBE3A can enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of PDHA1 and ACAT1 via ubiquitination,
  while also inhibiting glycolysis and lipid synthesis. (7) The E3 ubiquitin ligase
  MDM2 enhances proteasome-mediated degradation of HSF1 via ubiquitination, decreasing
  its inhibitory impact on NLRP3 and activating NLRP3 inflammasomes. (8) MDM2 promotes
  proteasome-mediated degradation of ALR via ubiquitination, whereas USP36 deubiquitinates
  ALR. The imbalance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination of ALR causes severe
  degradation, and ALR depletion is a major exacerbating factor in the progression
  of NASH-HCC. (9) The deubiquitinase RPN11 stabilizes METTL3, increases m6A modification
  and ACSS3 expression, upregulates lipid metabolism genes via histone acetylation
  to generate acetyl CoA, and promotes liver lipid accumulation, IR, and inflammation
