caption: Network constructed based on the interaction test within the small cell lung
  cancer pathway from KEGG. The genes regulatory network was reconstructed based on
  the interaction test. Each directed edge in the figure represents significant TE-splicing
  interaction effects from one gene on the TE of another gene. TP53 and LAMB2 had
  the highest outdegrees, with TE-splicing interaction significantly affecting other
  12 genes with the pathway. AKT2 and CASP9 also had significant TE-splicing interaction
  effects on more than 10 other genes
