caption: 'Summary and proposal of prostate differentiation from human pluripotent
  stem cells. Human ESC/iPSC can respond to TGFβ signaling pathway to differentiate
  into definitive endoderm, from which there are two paths to generate prostate organoids:
  mimic the prostate development process (from definitive endoderm to hindgut stage
  by WNT and FGF signaling pathways, then to UGS by certain signals, and eventually
  to prostate organoids by AR and other signaling pathways; or direct to bladder urothelial
  cells by RA, and then transdifferentiate into prostate organoids'
