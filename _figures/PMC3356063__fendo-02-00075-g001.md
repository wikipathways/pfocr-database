caption: Endocrine signaling pathways affecting longevity. (A) Role of the conserved
  IIS signaling pathway in longevity regulation. Insulin-like peptides bind to an
  insulin/IGF receptor on the plasma membrane. Ligand binding causes dimerization
  of the receptor, activating the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Phosphorylation
  by the receptor kinase domain activates the PI3 Kinase (PI3K). The signaling activity
  of PI3K, antagonized by the PTEN phosphatase, activates the Akt kinase. Akt phosphorylates
  FOXO/DAF-16 which is then sequestered in the cytosol. In the absence of IIS signaling,
  FOXO translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of longevity promoting
  genes. AKT signaling also opposes longevity by activating the TOR pathway, which
  inhibits autophagy, a pro-longevity process. (B) Endocrine signaling in the C. elegans
  germline longevity pathway. The germ line stem cells send an unknown signal that
  allows other tissues to detect that they are present. When the germ line stem cells
  are ablated, the somatic gonad releases the steroid dafachronic acid that binds
  to the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12. It is unclear exactly where DAF-12 acts
  to receive this signal but the intestine is a possible location. As a result of
  signaling via DAF-12, DAF-16/FOXO activity increases in the nuclei of intestinal
  cells. This in turn leads to signaling from the intestine to the other tissues that
  informs them about status of the DAF-16/FOXO in the intestine. INS-7 promotes IIS
  signaling which suppresses DAF-16/FOXO activity but DAF-16/FOXO in the intestine
  can down regulate the expression of INS-7 and this may be one mechanism by which
  intestinal DAF-16/FOXO controls other tissues. (C) Regulation of longevity by 20-hydroxyecdysone
  (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) in insects. JH suppresses reproductive diapause
  which promotes longevity. JH may also negatively affect longevity in other ways.
  The receptor(s) to which JH binds is unknown. 20E activates the ecdysone receptor
  which may reduce longevity. IIS engages in cross talk with both JH and 20E and also
  reduces longevity via other signaling pathways.
