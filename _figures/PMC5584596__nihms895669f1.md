caption: B cell receptor upon encountering an antigen, gets activated. CD79 (α, β)
  gets phosphorylated by SRC kinases, LYN and SYK, which in turn activates a signalosome.
  Along with CD19, BCR recruits PI3K to the membrane, where the latter phosphorylates
  PIP2 to PIP3. Catalytic subunits α, β and δ consist PI3K class IA isoforms and catalytic
  subunit γ belongs to class IB. p85 is the regulatory subunit that binds to class
  IA catalytic isoforms subunits, whereas p101/55 binds to catalytic subunit γ. These
  isoforms regulate various processes as indicated in the figure. Duvelisib inhibits
  δ and γ isoforms.
