caption: The TCR signaling pathways generated by GenMAPP. The map-based pathway was
  made using the GenMAPP software package. A total of 4004 Mus musculus homologs were
  used to create the GenMAPP. Mus musculus homologs were identified by searching the
  8216 unigenes against the zebrafish RefSeq data downloaded from the UCSC website
  and then the database of HomoloGene at the NCBI. Red indicates significantly increased
  expression; pink, not remarkably increased expression; blue, significantly decreased
  expression; cyan, not remarkably decreased expression; and gray, unchanged expression.
  White denotes genes that were not identified in the expression profile analysis.
