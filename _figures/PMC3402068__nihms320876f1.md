caption: This is a schematic depicting a selection of factors involved in the DDR
  that are phosphorylated in response to DSBs. Phosphatases (indicated in blue text)
  regulate a small subset of these factors. (A) DNA repair proteins that are potentially
  involved in the choice of repair pathway (the MRN complex [MRE11–RAD50–NBS1], ATM,
  H2AX, MDC1, BRCA1, 53BP1, and KAP1) and in the initiation stage of the repair process.
  (B) Homologous Recombination (HR) is promoted in S and G2 phase. MRN initiates resection
  at the DSB site with CTIP and EXO1 followed by RPA accumulation on single strand
  DNA. BRCA2 mediates the displacement of RPA, and formation of recombinogenic RAD51
  filaments. Strand invasion by RAD51 filaments results in formation of D loops which
  are resolved by the anti-recombinase RTEL1 {**undergoes dephosphorylation after
  DNA damage []}. Unresolved D-loops can result in Holliday Junctions (HJ) which are
  resolved by SLX4 (* phosphomimetic mutants have distinct phenotype [], implying
  the importance of dephosphorylation) with MUS81/EME1. (C) Non-homologous End Joining
  (NHEJ) is dominant in G1 phase. Ku proteins are rapidly recruited to DSB sites to
  tether DSB ends and activate DNA-PK, and to facilitate NHEJ. DNA-PK stabilizes DSB
  ends and prevents resections through autophosphorylation and its activity is regulated
  by multiple phosphatases. Ligatable ends are processed by ARTEMIS, and ligation
  is enhanced by XRCC4/XLF/PNK. (D) Check point regulation. Proliferating cells go
  through G1/S, intra-S, and G2/M checkpoints prior to entering mitosis. The indicated
  proteins are involved in these checkpoints.
