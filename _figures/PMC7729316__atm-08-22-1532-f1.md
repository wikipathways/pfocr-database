caption: 'Therapeutic approaches targeting tumor angiogenesis. VEGF and PDGF stimulate
  proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and sprouting of tubular structures
  through their cognate receptors (activation phase). These receptors activate multiple
  signaling pathways, including Ras-ERK and downstream Notch and DLL. BMP 9/10 promote
  the stabilization of vessels, with reconstitution of a basement membrane and the
  recruitment of pericytes, developing functional vascular beds (maturation phase).
  BMP 9/10 bind BMPR II (a type II TGF-β receptor) which phosphorylates ALK-1 and
  promotes the formation of a receptor complex together with endoglin, a coreceptor.
  This complex leads to phosphorylation and activation of SMADs 1/5/8, which bind
  to SMAD 4 and translocate to the nucleus leading to expression of various genes
  such as ID-1 and TMEM100. The figure mainly illustrates receptors and pathways affected
  by drugs discussed herein. Sorafenib interferes with signaling of different receptors
  and with the Ras/ERK pathway. Dalantercept is a ‘ligand trap’ preventing binding
  of BMP9/10 to the ALK-1 receptor. PF-03446962 blocks ALK-1 activation. TRC105 interferes
  with endoglin. ALK-1: Activin like kinase-1; BMPR II: type II TGF β receptor; BMP:
  bone morphogenetic protein; ID-1: DNA-binding protein inhibitor, TMEMT100: transmembrane
  protein 100; ENG: endoglin; EC endothelial cell; VEGF-R: vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor; PDGF: platelet derived growth factor'
