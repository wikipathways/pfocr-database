caption: Canonical pathway representation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
  aureus (MRSA)  small molecule metabolism colored by expectation value of the best
  hit against MDDR. Reactions that are also present in humans have been faded. Layout
  based upon the Cytoscape 2.5 y-files hierarchical layout. Edge lengths are not significant.
  For ease of viewing, reactions are not labeled but can be identified in the interactive
  versions of the maps available at the online resource.
