caption: Several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of distinct enzymes in
  the sphingolipid pathway results in alterations to influenza virus infection levels.
  Pharmacological inhibition of sphingomyelin synthesis (through serine palmitoyltransferase)
  and sphingosine kinase, as well as genetic ablation of sphingomyelin synthase and
  glucosylceramidase (red Xs) led to decreased influenza virus infection [–,]. Conversely,
  reductions in ceramide synthesis through inhibition of ceramide synthase led to
  an increase in influenza virus replication []. In this study we tested the role
  of UGCG (green box) in influenza virus infection by using the pharmacological inhibitor
  PPMP as well as by knocking out the gene encoding for UGCG enzyme expression in
  two cell lines.
