caption: A simplified mTOR (mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway with
  upstream signals, which activate or inhibit mTORC1 or mTORC2 activities. mTORC1
  activity is sensitive to growth factors, energy levels, oxygen, amino acids, and
  stress while mTORC2 activity responds to growth factors only. Below, the main cellular
  processes, which are affected by mTOR activity. mTORC1 activity leads to cell growth,
  cell cycle progression with an increased phosphorylation of S6K1/2 (S6 kinase 1/2)
  and 4E-BP (4E binding protein). mTORC1 activity inhibits autophagy. mTORC2 activity
  controls cell survival, proliferation, and migration.
