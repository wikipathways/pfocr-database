caption: The binding of ligand CXCL12 with CXCR4, a G-protein coupled recepetor, is
  involved in the activation of signaling protein PDZ domain containing 1 (PDZK1).
  PDZK1 activates diacylglycerol (DAG) through hydrolyzes of phosphatidylinositol
  diphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG further induces
  activation of another mitogenic signaling pathway of extracellular signal regulated
  kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) through phospholipid dependent protein kinase C (PKC) that promotes
  cell proliferation. The direct interaction of PDZK1 with phospholipase C-β (PLC-β)
  promotes the calcium ions (Ca2+) signaling to activates proto-oncogenes src-Ras-Raf-mitogen
  activated protein (MAPK) kinases. It further enhances the signaling of growth promoting
  factors including estrogen growth factor EGF and insulin growth factor IGF that
  phosphorylate downstream mediator proteins including insulin receptor substrate-1
  (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3 kinase-serine/threonine protein kinases (PI3k-Akt) and
  MAPK-ERK1/2 kinases after binding with receptors EGFR and IGFR. CXCL12/CXCR4, EGF/EGFR
  and IGF/IGFR signaling can lead to increased expressions of estrogen and progesterone
  receptor (ER and PR) that lead the system towards proliferation, migration, invasion
  and metastasis. Furthermore, the cancer can metastasized to lungs, liver, bones
  and brain resulting from loss of function mutations of various tumor suppressor
  genes including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), BC susceptibility genes 1
  (BRCA1), p53 and mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2).
