caption: The first step in heme synthesis is the synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid
  (ALA) from succinyl coenzyme A and glycine. ALA is then metabolized to porphobilinogen
  (PBG) by ALA dehydratase (ALAD). Mutations in ALAD cause ALA dehydratase deficiency
  porphyria (ADP), an exceptionally rare condition. PBG is then converted to hydroxymethylbilane
  (HMB) by HMB synthase (HMBS). Mutations in HMBS cause acute intermittent porphyria
  (AIP), the most common acute hepatic porphyria. Note that HMBS is also known as
  PBG deaminase. ALA and PBG accumulate during acute attacks of AIP. The other acute
  hepatic porphyrias are hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), which is caused by mutations
  in CPOX (CPG oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of PPG IX from CPG
  III), and variegate porphyria (VP), which is caused by mutations in PPOX (PPG oxidase,
  the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of PP IX from PPG IX). Mutations in the
  other enzymes that are part of the heme synthetic pathway cause erythropoietic porphyrias
  and are not represented here. Note that heme acts as a direct negative feedback
  on the formation of ALA. CPG = coproporphyrinogen; PP = protoporphyrin; PPG = protoporphyrinogen;
  UPG = uroporphyrinogen.
