caption: (A) Analysis and regulation of significantly altered pathways of FKBP51 KO
  and WT cells. The f(x) axis shows the (median) log2 fold change (FC) of all significantly
  altered metabolites of the indicated pathway, and the false discovery rate (FDR)
  (equals the −log10–adjusted P value) is shown on the x axis. The size of the circles
  represents the amount of significantly changed metabolites in comparison to all
  metabolites of a particular pathway. tRNA, transfer RNA. (B) FKBP51 deletion increases
  metabolites of the polyamine pathway, the AMP/ATP ratio, and enhances levels of
  amino acids associated with mTOR signaling. Data in (B) are shown as means + SEM
  and were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a subsequent Bonferroni
  multiple comparison analysis. ala, alanine; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
