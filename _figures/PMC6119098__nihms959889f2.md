caption: The Hippo signaling pathway is activated upon E-cadherin mediated cell adhesion,
  formation of tight junctions and apical polarity complexes while mechanical stress
  inhibits the pathway. Activation leads to growth inhibition upon cell contact. When
  activated, the pathway components form a complex at junctions where Mst phosphorylates
  Lats which then phosphorylates YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is retained in the cytoplasm,
  and cell growth is inhibited. When Hippo signaling is inactivated, the complex dissociates,
  preventing subsequent phosphorylation of Lats and YAP. YAP then translocates to
  the nucleus, binds TEADs and activates target gene expression and cell proliferation.
