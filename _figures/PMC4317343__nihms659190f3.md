caption: Diagram of the proposed signalling pathway involved in the cardiac remodelling
  process in the absence of natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA)/cGMP signalling.
  Disruption of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)/NPRA signalling leads to increased
  activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Activation of the RAS has been
  shown to activate increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This leads
  to activation and dissociation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB and activator protein (AP)-1
  transcription factor subunits from the complex in the cytoplasm and translocation
  into the nucleus, which activates pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, leading to medial
  thickening and perivascular fibrosis, in turn promoting cardiac remodelling, hypertrophy
  and heart failure. KHD, kinase homology domain; GC, guanylate cyclase; AngII, angiotensin
  II. Reproduced with permission from Vellaichamy et al.
