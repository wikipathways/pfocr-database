caption: The various steps in the MHC class II processing and presentation pathway
  that are known or postulated to be influenced by M. tuberculosis infection are illustrated.
  A) New synthesis of MHC class II molecules is blocked by TLR2 signaling due to mycobacterial
  products such as the 19-kDa lipoprotein. B) Intracellular trafficking of MHC class
  II is disrupted by the suppression of cathepsin S, which is due to induction of
  IL-10 by mycobacterial infection. C) Generation of peptide antigens for loading
  onto MHC class II in relevant endocytic compartments (MIIC) is also inhibited by
  several effects of mycobacterial infection, including inhibition of phagosome-lysosome
  fusion, neutralization of phagosomal pH by urease (UreC) and by blockade of recruitment
  of the vaculolar proton ATPase. D) A proposed inhibition of autophagy and autophagic
  vacuole formation also eliminates a potential source of antigenic peptides that
  can load MHC class II molecules. E) The reduction of peptide antigen availability
  and incomplete cleavage of MHC class II associated Ii resulting from cathepsin S
  suppression result in a reduced transport of stable peptide loaded MHC class II
  molecules to the APC surface.
