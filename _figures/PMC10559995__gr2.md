caption: Estrogen synthesis pathway in the ovary and brain. (A) Synthesis of estrogens
  begins with the production of pregnenolone from cholesterol, catalyzed by the cytochrome
  P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). The pregnenolone is transformed into
  progesterone by 3 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 b-HSD) in both thecal and granulosa
  cells. Progesterone is transformed to androgens by cytochrome P450 17a-hydroxylase
  (P45017a) and 17 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 b-HSD) in the thecal cells throughout
  the follicular phase. The transformation of E2 is enhanced by the aromatase enzyme
  (P450Arom) in granulosa cells. (B) Neurons express all of the mandatory enzymes
  for the production of estrogen to create brain estrogen [12].
