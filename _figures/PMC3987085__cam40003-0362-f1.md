caption: (A) Intraperitoneal administration of zoledronate sensitizes tumor cells
  to Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell recognition. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is an intermediate
  metabolite in the mevalonate–cholesterol pathway, recognized by Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells.
  Zoledronate inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, thereby causing the
  accumulation of IPP and triphosphoric acid I-adenosine-50-yl ester 3-(3-methylbut-3-enyl)
  ester (ApppI) in the tumor cells. When Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells are injected into the peritoneal
  cavity, they can recognize IPP and respond to tumor cells. (B) The study scheme
  of weekly i.p. Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell injection. In the first series of injections, zoledronate
  (1 mg) was administered i.v. on day 0, followed by i.p. Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell injection
  on day 1. Zoledronate was i.p. injected via a catheter from the second to fourth
  injection.
