caption: The isoflavonoid phytoalexin synthesis pathway in soybeans. Terminal productions
  of the phenylpropanoid pathway are in brackets. The most upstream and downstream
  enzymes are indicated in blue. The branch-point enzymes are indicated in red. Metabolic
  node substances are labeled in bold. Dotted arrows represent multiple or unclear
  steps.
