caption: A model on the action of EIN3/EIL1 and PIF1 in regulating cotyledon greening.
  EIN3/EIL1 and PIF1 are two classes of transcription factors that redundantly regulate
  chlorophyll synthesis and alleviate photooxidation of etiolated seedlings. EIN3/EIL1
  and PIF1 are able to induce POR gene expression by directly binding to their promoters,
  and regulate a number of tetrapyrrole pathway genes to repress the accumulation
  of protochlorophyllide, a phototoxic intermediate in chlorophyll synthesis. Ethylene
  enhances seedling greening by activating EIN3/EIL1 via its canonical signal transduction
  pathway. Far-red light (FR) blocks seedling greening through PhyA-mediated direct
  inhibition of PIF1 or indirect repression of COP1, a positive regulator of EIN3/EIL1
  and PIF1. Arrows and bars represent positive and negative regulation, respectively.
  Solid and dotted lines indicate direct and indirect regulation, respectively.
