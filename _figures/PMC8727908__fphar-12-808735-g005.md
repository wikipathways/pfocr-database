caption: BRD4 regulated transcription in EMP programs. Schematic view of MMP9, GFP2
  and TGFb promoters in epithelial and mesenchymal-like (EMP) states. With activation
  of master transcription factors, BRD4 is repositioned from genomic sites including
  epithelial superenhancers to epithelial plasticity genes. Upon phosphorylation,
  plasticity genes are expressed through regulated transcriptional elongation, involving
  remodeling nucleosomes through BRD4-dependent HAT activity (; ; ; ).
