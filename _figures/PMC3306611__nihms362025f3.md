caption: Inactivation of NF-κB pathway by bortezomib. In response to external stress,
  the IκB becomes phosphorylated by IKK and degraded by the proteasome. With the degradation
  of IκB, the NF-κB complex then translocates into the nucleus and promotes transcription
  of a series of pro-survival genes. Proteasome inhibition prevents the activation
  of NF-κB and increases the susceptibility of malignant cells to chemotherapeutic
  drugs.
