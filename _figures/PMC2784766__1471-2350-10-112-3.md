caption: The complex role of the PLAU-PLAUR pathway in the airways. PLAUR is a complex,
  multi-domain (D1, 2, 3) molecule and exists as a membrane bound GPI linked protein
  and in multiple soluble forms. The interaction between PLAU-PLAUR is critical for
  the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and is regulated by a series of proteins
  including; PAI-1, PAI-2 and SERPINE2 which have previously been implicated in COPD
  pathogenesis [,]. Plasmin has many downstream proteolytic effects including those
  common to remodelling of the airways e.g. MMP activation. In addition PLAUR interacts
  with several membrane receptors leading to the activation of signalling cascades
  resulting in alterations in; proliferation, migration, adhesion, endocytosis and
  cytoskeletal changes. PLAUR also exists in multiple soluble forms (sPLAUR) generated
  by splicing and/or proteolytic cleavage implicated in chemotaxis and interactions
  with the extracellular matrix [,,].
