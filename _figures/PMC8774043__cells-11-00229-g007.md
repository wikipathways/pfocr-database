caption: Schematic summary of eHSP90α-induced CD91 and TLR4-associated signal transduction
  pathways for tumor-promoting M2-polarization in macrophages. Once macrophages are
  exposed to eHSP90α, CD91 is enhanced to be physically associated with TLR4 to recruit
  IRAK1/4 and MyD88. Besides the canonical CD91/MyD88–IRAK1/4–IKKα/β–NF-κB/IRF3 signaling
  pathway, JAK2 and TYK2 are recruited onto MyD88 to turn on a MyD88−JAK2/TYK2−STAT-3
  pathway. Both signaling axes act together leading to downregulation of inflammatory
  cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β as well as upregulation of M2-associated TGF-β, CD163,
  CD204, IL-10, and VEGF expressions. Following our previous report that the eHSP90α-induced
  MyD88−JAK2/TYK2−STAT-3 pathway is involved in a feedforward loop of HSP90α expression
  and secretion, this signal transduction pathway is also responsible for the induction
  of Sec22b expression to decrease the phagocytotic activity of macrophages. Green
  ↓, down-regulated. Red ↑, up-regulated.
