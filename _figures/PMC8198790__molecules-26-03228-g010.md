caption: (a) Schematic representation of the formation of RGDfC-SeNPs/siRNA, and (b)
  the main signaling pathway of apoptosis induced by RGDfC-SeNPs/siRNA. The SeNPs
  were synthesized through reduction of Na2SeO3 by ascorbic acid (Vc), which were
  functionalized by the cancer-targeting ligand, RGDfC peptide. The siRNA was then
  loaded on the surface of RGDfC-SeNPs to prepare RGDfC-SeNPs/siRNA. The RGDfC-SeNPs/siRNA
  can induce cell apoptosis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and activation
  of its downstream target gene (Adapted from Xia et al. 2017 [], Copyright 2017 The
