caption: Signaling pathways that regulate actin polymerization and myosin II motors
  in smooth muscle cell migration. Activation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR)
  and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) initiates activation of parallel signaling cascades
  that culminate in actin filament remodeling, and changes matrix adhesiveness and
  regulation of myosin II motors that generate traction force. Immediate post-receptor
  events include activation of trimeric G proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, phospholipase
  C (PLC) and PIP2, PI3-kinases (PI3-K), and increased Ca2+. Multiple small G proteins
  (RhoA, Rac, Cdc42) and calmodulin (CaM) then activate downstream targets that are
  shown here in darker shades of red. Some targets are effector proteins that regulate
  actin polymerization including the formins (mDIA1 and mDIA2), WAVE and WASP, and
  the ARP2/3 complex. Other targets include members of the MAP kinase family (p38
  MAPK and ERK), Rho kinases (ROCK), and p21-activated protein kinases (PAK). The
  signaling kinases phosphorylate other protein kinases (MAPKAPK, LIMK) or phosphatases
  (MLCP) to regulate effector proteins (dark blue ovals) that control actin polymerization
  and traction forces generated by myosin II. Most of the schematic is organized as
  sets of parallel linear signaling cascades, which is an oversimplification for the
  sake of clarity. Pathway convergence and crosstalk are known to occur between the
  pathways shown. Regulation of MLCK is a good example where both positive and negative
  inputs are integrated to determine the level of myosin II regulatory light chain
  phosphorylation and traction force. Reprinted by permission from Reference .
