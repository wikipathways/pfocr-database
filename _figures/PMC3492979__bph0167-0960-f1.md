caption: Ligand-specific signalling complexes at the µ opioid receptor. Treatment
  with morphine or DAMGO elicits differential signalling and trafficking of the µ
  opioid receptor. Activation of the µ opioid receptor by the low-internalizing agonist
  morphine is thought to result in receptor desensitization via a β-arrestin and PKC-dependent
  pathway. In contrast, the high-internalizing agonist DAMGO desensitizes the receptor
  in a GRK2-dependent manner and recruits P38 MAPK, which appears to be critical for
  µ opioid receptor desensitization and internalization. Such differences could feasibly
  be explained by different receptor conformations that allow similar G-protein activation
  but different kinase recruitment and hence desensitization. Further work is needed
  to explain how these ligand-specific complexes relate to tolerance.
