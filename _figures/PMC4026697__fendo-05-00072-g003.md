caption: VKR signaling pathways. Closure of VFT extracellular domains upon binding
  of arginine ligand promotes and reinforces receptor dimerization inducing kinase
  activation and autophosphorylation of VKR. Phosphotyrosines can bind different partners
  for the transduction of conserved RTK signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway involved in protein synthesis and the Ras/MAPK ERK pathway important for
  cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, activated VKRs could activate through the
  specific binding of Shb (SH2-containing protein), the alternative JNK pathway to
  contribute in concert with Rho1, MEK7, and PP2C to cytoskeleton rearrangement and
  oocyte maturation. Phosphorylation of AKT, p70S6K, ERK, and JNK (circled in red)
  was confirmed in VKR-expressing Xenopus oocytes ().
