caption: Therapeutic targets in Wnt/β-catenin pathway and developmental therapeutics.
  Multiple strategies have been under investigation to counteract the canonical pathway
  of Wnt signaling. a, b Wnt soluble receptors and antibodies directed to Frizzled
  receptors impair the interaction ligand/receptor and its conveyed signal. c COX
  inhibitors reduces β-catenin cytoplasmic levels through different ways. PGE2, the
  main product of COX2 enzyme, is thought to mediate β-catenin transcription. Also,
  COX inhibitors such as aspirin were related to increase β-catenin ubiquitination
  and proteasomal destruction. d Tankyrase activates axin through induction of PARsylation
  and proteasomal degradation; tankyrase inhibitors increase the levels of axin, facilitating
  the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex and reducing β-catenin availability.
  e CBP inhibitors reduce the interaction between CBP and Tcf/Lef, reducing Tcf/Lef
  activity. f. PORCN inhibitors reduce the essential palmitoylation of Wnt, precluding
  its release to the extracellular space. g SAM68 is a regulator of alternative splicing
  of Tcf and impairs β-catenin/Tcf/Lef interaction
