caption: Expression patterns of genes of the antioxidant action of vitamin C signaling
  pathway in the intestinal tissue. (A) Intestinal tissue exposed to 10 μM DON; (B)
  Intestinal tissue exposed to S. cerevisiae boulardii and 10 μM DON. Red nodes represent
  up-regulated genes, and green nodes represent down-regulated genes identified in
  our differential expression analysis. Darker node colors indicate more extreme (high
  or low) up- or down-regulation of the respective gene. White nodes represent genes
  involved in the signaling pathway that were not identified in the microarray analysis.
  The red circles indicate genes showing different expression pattern in both conditions.
