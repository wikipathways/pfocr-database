caption: Proposed model for the role of lncRNAs in RB pathway. Cyclins and CDKs are
  key players in cell cycle regulation. The promoter associated non-coding RNA CCND1
  (ncRNA CCND1) functions as a transcription factor regulator. NcRNA CCND1 is induced
  upon DNA damage and negatively regulates the expression of Cyclin D1. The ncRNA
  CCND1 along with TLS inhibits the coactivator, CBP/p300 to inhibit the transcription
  of CCND1 in its promoter. The lncRNA gadd7 induced by DNA damage destabilizes the
  CDK6 mRNA by interacting with TDP-43. TDP-43 is important for stability of CDK6
  mRNA. CDK4/6-Cyclin Ds phosphorylates the RB and activates E2F which regulates the
  expression of several proteins that promote the S phase entry. H19 lncRNA transcribed
  by E2F from H19 locus is processed to yield miR-675, which regulates the translation
  of RB mRNA. E2F1 transcriptionally activates ANRIL, which consequently represses
  the expression of p16INK4 family members, and thus alleviates p53 and pRB signaling
  pathways in response to the DNA damage. ANRIL repress p16INK4 by interaction with
  PRC2 complex at the INK4 locus.
