caption: The coagulation pathway and target sites for anticoagulant drugs., The coagulation
  pathway is a cascade of enzymatic conversions, each activating the next enzyme (factor)
  in the sequence. The final enzyme in this pathway is thrombin (factor IIa), which
  catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin strands. Warfarin acts by inhibiting
  synthesis of factors in the liver. In contrast, heparin acts to inhibit factors
  that have become activated within the bloodstream. Thrombin can be activated by
  either of 2 pathways. The intrinsic pathway is initiated within the bloodstream
  by platelet thromboplastin. Heparin influences this pathway by inhibiting factors
  XIIa, XIa, and IXa, which requires its activity to be monitored using the activated
  partial thromboplastin time. The extrinsic pathway functions outside the bloodstream,
  initiated by tissue thromboplastin. This pathway is influenced most by warfarin
  because it inhibits hepatic synthesis of factor VII, the most essential factor in
  the extrinsic pathway. Therefore the anticoagulant activity of warfarin must be
  monitored using the prothrombin time (PT), which is now standardized as the international
  normalized ratio (INR). Newer agents, commencing with the low-molecular-weight heparins,
  have greater specificity for inhibiting only factors Xa or IIa (thrombin) within
  the common pathway and therapeutic monitoring is not required.

  description: The coagulation pathway and target sites for anticoagulant drugs.,
    The coagulation pathway is a cascade of enzymatic conversions, each activating
