caption: Excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) causes severe tissue
  fibrosis in SSc. Antifibrotic therapies target profibrotic pathways in fibroblasts,
  the main producers of ECM. 1CAT-192 anti-transforming growth factor-b antibodies
  (TGF-ab) catch TGF-β molecules (TGF), which would bind to TGF-β receptors (TGFR)
  to activate potent profibrotic pathways. Smad molecules, including Smad 3, as well
  as the Abelson kinase (Abl) are downstream mediators of the profibrotic TGF-β pathway.
  2Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKI) can block several profibrotic signaling
  cascades. Imatinib and nilotinib inhibit both Abl and the platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor (PDGFR). In addition to Abl and PDGFR, dasatinib blocks Src kinases
  (Src). 3The thiazolidinediones, a group of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
  agonists (PPARγA), bind to their intra-nuclear receptors to inhibit ECM production.
  4Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) as well as 5DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
  (DNMTI) decrease ECM production by modifying gene transcription.
