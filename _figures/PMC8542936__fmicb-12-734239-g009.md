caption: Downregulation of central metabolic pathways in P. salmonis growing in CMMAB
  with amp. Genes differentially expressed between P. salmonis grown in the CMMAB
  amp medium and the Austral-SRS medium were mapped to glycolysis, the TCA cycle,
  pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism using the genome-scale
  model iPS584 for this pathogen. Expression levels are shown as log2 fold-change
  values; downregulated genes are in green and upregulated genes are in red.
