caption: 1.ApoE4 may promote tau phosphorylation by activating relevant kinases [53–55].
  2.ApoE4 can enhance the expression of ferritin, induce iron overload, trigger oxidative
  stress and lipid peroxidation, and even lead to ferroptosis [22, 63, 64]. 3.ApoE4-mediated
  lipid metabolism defects result in elevated fatty acid levels, which activate tau
  phosphorylation-related kinases, impair mitochondrial function, and activate the
  NF-κB pathway [60–62]. 4.ApoE4 can promote the generation of ROS and activate the
  NF-κB signaling pathway, which in turn activates kinases such as GSK-3β, leading
  to tau phosphorylation [65–68, 88]. Phosphorylated tau, in turn, can further activate
  the NF-κB pathway, exacerbating the inflammatory response [136]. 5.ApoE4 significantly
  downregulates the expression of the PPP2R5E gene, leading to decreased activity
  of the major tau phosphatase PP2A [56]. 6.ApoE4 can promote the endocytic recycling
  of LRP1, providing a channel for tau diffusion [75]. 7.ApoE4 competes with tau for
  LRP1, restricting tau diffusion [77]. 8. ApoE4 interferes with the autophagy-lysosome
  pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), hindering tau degradation [20,
  71–73]. CDK5 cycline dependent kinase-5, GSK-3β glycogen synthase kinase-3β, MAPK
  mitogen- activated protein kinase, FFA free fatty acid, NFTs neurofibrillary tangles,
