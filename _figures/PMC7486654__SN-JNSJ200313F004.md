caption: Diagram of the TC pathway and barrel formation in mice. Waves of calcium
  signals in the embryonic thalamus, schematically illustrated by graded colors, are
  suggested to correspond to a somatotopic connectivity between the thalamus and barrel
  cortex, before sensory input is present. Without these waves, barrel cortex becomes
  hyperexcitable and does not develop columnar and barrel organization (). Developing
  TC axons are guided to cortex through multiple molecular guidance cues, some attractive
  and some repulsive (). Morphogens and signaling molecules set up areal specification
  of the neocortex into primary sensory, motor, and association cortex areas (; ;
  , ; ). In the developing barrel cortex, a patchwork of spontaneous activity corresponds
  to barrels at the time of their formation (). Layer- and projection-type-specific
  identity of neocortical neurons is determined by their time of differentiation and
  specific transcription factors (; ). Transcription factor RORα is cell-autonomously
  required in the thalamus for clustering of TC axons and dendritic maturation of
  layer 4 neurons in the barrel cortex (). Dendritic orientation of barrel cells is
  controlled by the BTBD3 transcription factor (), and BTBD3 appears to be controlled
  by the transcription factor Lhx2 (). So, transcription factors play multiple roles
  from cell specification to dendritic orientation in the barrel cortex.
