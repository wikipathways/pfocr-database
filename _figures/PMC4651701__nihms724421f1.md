caption: IL4 induces heterodimerization of the IL4Rα and γC subunits to form the type
  I IL4 receptor in hematopoietic cells including lymphocytes (depicted). This results
  in the activation of JAK proteins. The two main pathways activated after the phosphorylation
  of JAKs in response to IL4 in immune cells are the IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway and the
  JAK/STAT6 pathway. Activation of these pathways in lymphocytes results in the transcription
  of IL4 responsive genes and the promotion of pro-growth phenotypes. IL4 has also
  been shown to activate mTOR in T lymphocytes for the regulation of differentiation.
  Some non-hematopoietic cells including epithelial cancer cells can express the type
  II IL4R, consisting of the IL4Rα and IL13Rα1 subunits. IL4 directly promotes pro-growth
  and pro-metastatic phenotypes downstream of the type II IL4R in epithelial cancer
  cells through several signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT6,
  and mTOR.
