caption: Curcumin inhibits 44as3 cell proliferation and induces apoptosis via Wnt3a/
  β catenin/EMT signaling pathway. Curcumin participates in regulating the EMT process
  of 44as3 cells by down-regulating N-cadherin, Snaill, and regulating the expression
  of E-cadherin, suggesting that EMT inhibition is an important mechanism for curcumin
  to inhibit 44as3 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Up-regulation of Bax
  and down-regulation of Bcl-2 caused an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, causing
  apotosis, and inhibiting the Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway to reduce the rate of apotosis.
  Up-regulation of Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 activity caused 44as3 apoptosis,
  but inhibition of Wnt3a/β-catenin/EMT signaling pathway can reduce the apoptosis
  induced by caspase pathway.
