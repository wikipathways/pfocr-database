caption: Schematic representation of the ER-stress signaling network and its interaction
  with Slt2 and the hexosamine pathway. The CWI signaling pathway from the anchored
  Wsc sensors to the final MAPK Slt2 (see [,,,,,,] as representative reviews) and
  the metabolic steps from fructose (Fruc) or glucosamine (GlcN) to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcN-6P) catalyzed by Gfa1 [] and Hxk2 [,], respectively, are shown. Gfa1 catalyzes
  the first committed and rate-limiting step of the HBP, which provides UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  for, among others, glycosylation and GPI-anchoring of proteins [,]. Tunicamycin
  exposure induces ER stress by inhibiting the N-glycosylation of proteins [], which
  triggers a protective response, the UPR, a transcription program mediated by Ire1
  and Hac1, that upregulates the transcription of hundreds of genes [,,,], among them
  GFA1 []. Expression of GFA1 also depends on Slt2 [], which link the CWI and the
  UPR in providing increased flux through the HBP under ER-stress conditions, a response
  that reduces the abundance of ER-client proteins. ER-stress also inhibits TORC1
  [,], a stress and growth controller [], which downregulates protein homeostasis
  mediated by autophagy [,] and proteasome [] activities and the bioenergetics response
  [,], which provides the energy required for protein folding and clearance of protein
  aggregates under ER stress []. Remarkably, Slt2 is required to both GFA1 expression
  and TORC1 inhibition in response to ER-stress, which accounts for the strong growth
  defect of cells devoted of Slt2 in media containing ER-stress-inducers, a phenotype
  that can be relieved by GFA1 overexpresion or GlcN supplementation. Arrows and bars
  denote positive and negative interactions, respectively. For additional details,
  see the text.
