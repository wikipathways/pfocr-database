caption: TLR2 signaling. After ligand recognition and consequent TLR2 dimer rearrangement,
  the TIR domain of TIRAP binds the TIR domain of TLR2 and recruits the adaptor protein
  MyD88. IRAKs are then recruited and IRAK 4 phosphorylates (P) IRAK1, which then
  initiates auto-phosphorylation. Phosphorylated IRAK1 dissociates from the complex
  and activates TRAF6. Since IRAK1 is rapidly degraded, IRAK2 also activates TRAF
  6 in latter responses. Ubiquitinated (U) TRAF6 triggers the activation sequence
  TAB2 – TAK1 – IKK complex. IκB phosphorylation and ubiquitination by the IKK complex
  leads to its degradation and release of NF-κB translocation to the nucleus for gene
  up-regulation. TAK1 also activates MKK6 for subsequent JNK and p38 activation, leading
  to AP-1 activation that triggers gene transcription of cytokines and accessory molecules.
  Internalized receptor complex triggered by a viral ligand can activate by an unknown
  pathway IRF7/3 to IFN-β gene up-regulation or IRF2/IRF1/STAT1 for IFN-α gene up-regulation
  (Underhill et al., ; Watters et al., ; Liljeroos et al., ; Barbalat et al., ; Dietrich
