caption: 'Model for the roles that Cdc42 and Rac play in stimulating exocytosis of
  secretory granules in RBL-2H3 cells. Upon antigen stimulation, Cdc42 and/or Rac
  activate at least three processes that are required for degranulation: (a and b)
  stimulation of calcium signaling and PKC activation, (c) actin cytoskeletal remodeling,
  and (d) an as yet unidentified function subsequent to calcium influx during the
  later stages of degranulation.'
