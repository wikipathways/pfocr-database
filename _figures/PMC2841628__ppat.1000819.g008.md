caption: 'The figure shows a simplified illustration of the H. pylori LPS biosynthesis
  pathway. The H. pylori O chains are assembled in the cytoplasm onto a polyisoprenoid
  membrane anchor. The O antigen synthesis is initiated by the UDP-GlcNAc: undecaprenyl-phosphate
  GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase WecA. Processive glycosyltransferases alternately
  add Gal and GlcNAc residues, producing the linear O chain backbone. Fucosyltransferases
  then attach Fucose residues on selected locations of the O antigen backbone, generating
  Lewis antigens. The flippase Wzk transfers the O polysaccharide to the periplasm,
  where it is attached onto the lipid A-core by the action of the O antigen ligase
  WaaL. The LPS molecule can then be transported to the outer leaflet of the H. pylori
  outer membrane.'
