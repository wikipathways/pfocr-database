caption: Regulation of dendritic spine maturation in cortical neurons by DPYSL proteins
  through Sema3A-cdk5 signaling pathway. We propose a model involving the Sema3A-DPYSL
  pathway in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines. Fyn phosphorylates
  semaphorin receptor (Plexin A2) and facilitates PlexinA2 interaction to Sema3A.
  Fyn also promotes the phosphorylation of kinases like cyclin dependent kinase-5
  (Cdk5) which in turn phosphorylates DPYSL proteins. We suggest that DPYSL proteins
  will thus play a role in the genesis and maturation of dendritic spines. AS an example,
  DPYSL1 can regulate spine development through Sema3A–Cdk5 signaling. Sema3A binds
  a receptor complex of the transmembrane proteins Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and Plexin
  A1 (Plex-A1). After interacting with plexin A1, Fyn stimulates kinase activity of
  Cdk5 via Tyr15 phosphorylation of Tyr15. Cdk5 Tyr15 phosphorylation will then phosphorylates
  DPYSL1 tetramer at Thr509 and Ser522 locations. Sema3A through phosphorylation of
  DPYSL1 by Cdk5 will increase the density of PSD-95 and synapsin I clusters at dendrites
  and thus, promote formation of mature spines in cultured cortical primary neurons.
