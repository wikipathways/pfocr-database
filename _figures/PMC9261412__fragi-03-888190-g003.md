caption: Overview of unfolded protein response. Following endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  misfolded/unfolded proteins bind and sequester GRP78 (Binding immunoglobulin protein),
  thus activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). This results in activation
  of the three signalling cascades, IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1), PERK (protein
  kinase RNA-like ER kinase) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6). Following
  dissociation from GRP78, IRE1 undergoes homodimersation and autophosphorylation.
  It can then induces XBP1 (x-box binding protein 1) splicing, activated RIDD (regulated
  IRE1-dependent decay) or recruits TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2) resulting
  in ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) phosphorylation, which then phosphorylates
  the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of the PERK pathway, results in eIF2α
  (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α) phosphorylation, which in turn inhibit
  protein synthesis and activate ATF4 (activated transcription factor 4). In terms
  of ATF6, it translocates to the Golgi where it is cleaved and migrates to the nucleus.
  XBP1, ATF4 and ATF6 regulate various genes called in chaperone proteins synthesis,
  ER-associated degradation (ERAD), lipid synthesis and redox homeostasis.
