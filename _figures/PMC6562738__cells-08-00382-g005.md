  of the RAC1 protein in tumorigenesis and drug-resistance as presented in the review.
  (A) represents the RAC1 signaling pathway. RAC1 cycles between an inactive-GDP-bound
  form, and an active-GTP-bound form. Signals from cell surface receptors, for example,
  G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and integrins
  (alpha, beta) converge on the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFS: VAV, TIAM,
  PREX), which converts RAC1 into its active state. Once activated, RAC1 can bind
  to a wide range of effectors, which in turn influence both a variety of oncogenic
  phenotypes like proliferation/survival, actin remodeling/migration, metastasis,
  and angiogenesis in tumor cells. In the process of functions mentioned above within
  tumor cells, RAC1 signals are closely knit to both the PI3K-AKT and the RAS-MAPK
  pathways integrating extracellular stimulations with oncogenic alterations. Other
  mechanisms, such as the stabilization of the active form of RAC1 by sumoylation
  or sequestration of the inactive form by guanine nucleotide dissociation factors
  (GDIs), can also influence the level of RAC1 signaling. Schematic illustration of
  RAC1 signaling pathways and functions of its effectors are presented. Green font
  represents signaling events following phosphorylation-mediated activation of the
  protein. The red font represents signaling events following phosphorylation-mediated
  inactivation of the protein. The blue border represents adaptor protein, the orange
  border represents GDP state/inactivating phosphorylation, the green border represents
  activated phosphorylation, the yellow border represents metastatic pathway, the
  yellow arrows represent metastatic pathway network, the green arrows represent proliferation/survival
  network, and the red line represents inhibition of signals. (B) illustrates the
  involvement of RAC1 in tumorigenesis and drug-resistance: RAS signaling-mediated
  tumorigenesis and the RAC1-PAK1 pathway-mediated resistance against RAS–RAF-MEK
  pathway-targeted drugs in cancers has been illustrated. RAC1 plays a cardinal role
  in the development of drug-resistance, especially in BRAF-mediated cancers like
  melanoma in which the development of resistance to BRAF inhibitors like vemurafenib,
  debrafenib, and encorafenib for a certain time leads to the hyper-activation of
  RAC1. The hyper-activation of RAC1 may either occur in the presence of upstream
  RTK-activation or due to the accompanying amplification or hot-stop mutation of
  RAC1. Under hyper-activation of RAC1, the RAC1-GTP activates PAK1, leading to the
  downstream activation of MEK and bypassing the upstream BRAF inhibition.'
