caption: 'Melanoma and integrated Breast cancer pathway landscape. The color node
  border indicates the common pathways among differentially expressed genes in two
  cancer cell lines: Green for down-regulated in both tumors; Dark red for up-regulated
  genes in both tumors; Blue for up/down-regulated in BC and down in melanoma; Yellow
  for down-regulated in BC and up/down-regulated genes in melanoma; Orange for up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes in BC and melanoma, respectively and pink color for down-regulated
  and up-regulated genes in melanoma and BC, respectively. A) Enriched pathways among
  down- regulated genes in melanoma. B) Enriched pathways among up-regulated genes
  in melanoma.'
