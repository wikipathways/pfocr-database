caption: 'CCR7 and the reactive LN. In homeostasis, normal LN show three main cellular
  compartments: the cortex (B zone), the paracortex (T zone) and the medulla. Upon
  antigen stimulation, the primary follicles evolve to secondary follicles, made up
  of a germinal center (GC) and surrounding mantle zone. In reactive LN, CCR7 is necessary
  for the entry of na誰ve B cells, na誰ve T cells (TN), regulatory T cells (TREG, not
  shown), central memory T cells (TCM, not shown), and dendritic cells (DCs). CCR7
  guides lymphocyte homing through high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the paracortex
  [1] whereas DCs preferentially use afferent lymphatics [2]. CCR7 also drives interstitial
  migration of these immune subsets in the T zone facilitating, for instance, the
  interaction of TN with antigen presenting cells such as B cells and DCs [3]. Upon
  activation, T cells are directed to the medulla following CCL19 gradients. CCL19
  signaling also induces CCR7 internalization and the up-regulation of the egressing
  receptor S1P1. The balance between CCR7 and S1P1 is needed for the movement of activated
  T cells from the T zone to the medulla [4]. Similarly, a fine-tuned balance between
  CCR7 and CXCR5 allows the migration of activated B cells through the T zone and
  the follicle. In a first step, CCR7 is down-modulated while a concomitant up-regulation
  of CXCR5 allows activated B cells to enter into the follicle [5]. In reactive follicles,
  fully developed GC are polarized into two regions clearly differentiated: the dark
  zone (DZ) and the light zone (LZ). Although GC B cells re-express CCR7, migration
  of GC B cells between both regions relies on the CXCR5-CXCL13 axis [6]. In the DZ,
  GC B cells (centroblasts) interact with stromal cells, proliferate (clonal expansion)
  and undergo somatic hypermutation on the immunoglobulin genes. In the LZ, hypermutated
  resting GC B cells (centrocytes) interact with a dense network of CXCL13hi follicular
  dendritic cells (FDCs) and CXCR5hi follicular helper T cells (TFH). FDCs display
  antigen and secrete cytokines and chemokines (CXCL13) that attract B cells and TFH
  to the GC. TFH are specialized CD4+ PD-1+ T cells that express BCL-6 and secrete
  cytokines that promote B cell proliferation and differentiation. TFH deliver survival
  signals to GC B cells through a number of different pathways, including CD40-CD40L,
  PD1-PDL1, and IL-21. The pro-survival signals from TFH counteract pro-apoptotic
  signals from the FAS-FASL pathway. Crosstalk of centrocytes with FDCs and THF allows
  the class-switch recombination and the selection of B cells. Centrocytes with the
  appropriate antigen affinity are selected to become memory B cells or antibody secreting
  plasma cells. The centrocytes that are not selected undergo apoptosis and are removed
  by tingible-body macrophages (TBM). Expression of CCR7 allows memory B cells to
  exit from follicles back to the T zone and, from there, to the medulla [7]. S1P1-expressing
  T cells and B cells move towards the efferent vessels following S1P gradients [8].
  Notation: this scheme shows the main cell types in a reactive LN and in the GC,
  however in these complex tissues participate additional subtypes not listed here
  that can be further reviewed elsewhere (, , , ).'
