caption: A, Position frequency matrix of the T‐cell factor (TCF) motif was obtained
  from the JASPAR database (http://jaspar.genereg.net). B, TOPFlash consists of tandemly
  repeated TCF motifs (Wnt response elements [WREs]) upstream of a minimal promoter
  that drives luciferase gene expression. FOPFlash has mutated motifs (mWREs) and
  is used to normalize the TOPFlash activity. HAL reporter was developed as a luciferase
  reporter driven by 8 copies of the promoter of histidine ammonia‐lyase (HAL). Transcription
  factor (TF) that regulates the activity of HAL promoter is under investigation.
  C, These reporter plasmids were designed for monitoring the activity of Wnt/β‐catenin
  pathway in cultured cells. When the pathway is inhibited, TOPFlash and HAL reporter
  activities are decreased and increased, respectively
