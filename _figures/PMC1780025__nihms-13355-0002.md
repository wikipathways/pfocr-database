caption: Heterogeneity of Pacemaking Ability among SCN Neurons Robust rhythm generation
  in SCN neurons is thought to rely on circadian expression of Period (Per1, 2), Cryptochrome
  (Cry1, 2), Rev-Erb, Ror, and Bmal1 genes, and constitutive expression of Clock.
  Period and Cryptochrome proteins (PER/CRY) form a negative-feedback loop, repressing
  transcriptional activation by CLK/BMAL1 through E-Box sequences on Per and Cry promoters.
  Casein kinase 1 and (CK1Δ) causes a phosphorylation-dependent delay in PER/CRY feedback.
  REV-ERB and ROR proteins form a second feedback loop, binding to ROR-element (RORE)
  promoters of the Bmal1 gene to repress and enhance expression, respectively. However,
  more than half of all SCN neurons require daily VIP-VPAC2signaling to maintain robust
  rhythms. This signaling pathway may impinge on the intracellular molecular clockwork
  through activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA), and CREB-dependent
  transcription of the Period genes (; ). This regulation of clock gene transcription
  may underlie the synchronization and amplification of neuronal rhythms by daily
  VIP/VPAC2signaling.
