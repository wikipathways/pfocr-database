caption: 'Illustrative scheme of Gq-protein (Gq)-mediated S1P effects in glioblastoma.
  Activation of S1PR2 and S1PR3 through stimulation of Gq-subunit boosts calcium mobilization
  and PLC/PKC/ERK1/2 signaling. Following either pathway increases invasion and proliferation
  by activation of transcription factor activating protein 1 (AP1) and NF-kB-mediated
  CCND2 expression, respectively. Conversely, S1P also induces cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2)
  expression and therefore prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, in turn, transactivates
  prostaglandin receptors (EP1-4) receptors leading to a Gi-dependent intracellular
  signaling mechanism (e.g. activation of the BCL-2/BCL-XL family members). Subsequently,
  this cascade upturns oxidative stress which is responsible for the transformation
  of a normal cell to tumor cell, its metastasis and thus survival. Additional abbreviations
  used in the figure are defined as follows: BCL2; B-cell lymphoma 2; BCL-XL, B-cell
  lymphoma-extra-large; Gi, Gi-protein; ↑, increased.'
