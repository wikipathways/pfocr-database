caption: Schema of the EGFR activation pathway. EGFR is the transmembrane protein
  (green) with intrinsic tyrosine kinase (phosphorylation in yellow) activity that
  regulates cell growth. Its ligands are EGF, tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFα) and
  others (red). Ligand binds to the receptor and initiates the activity of signaling
  pathways through dimerization of the receptor and autophosphorization of the tyrosine
  residues in the cytoplasm, which activates other downstream pathways including Janus
  Kinase (JAK) Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) directly
  and through phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2), c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase
  (JNK) and raf-1. Activation of these pathways leads to activation of STAT, c-Fos,
  c-Jun, and c-myc transcription factors respectively. These transcription factors
  regulate gene expression leading to cell cycle progression, proliferation, invasion,
  angiogenesis and metastasis.
