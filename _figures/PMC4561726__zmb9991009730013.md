caption: Differential transcriptional activation of the Adamts-1 and Cox-2 genes in
  response to VEGF, Ang-II, TNF-α, and IL-1β. The model shown represents the differential
  regulation of the Adamts-1 and Cox-2 promoters by the NFAT and C/EBPβ transcription
  factors during the stimulation of vascular cells by these factors. VEGF-induced
  upregulation of Adamts-1 and Cox-2 gene expression requires activation of the CN/NFAT
  signal transduction pathway. Although Ang-II also triggers the activation of CN-dependent
  signaling, Adamts-1 expression in response to Ang-II is mediated not by this pathway
  but instead by activation of C/EBPβ signaling. However, Ang-II-induced upregulation
  of Cox-2 requires activation of both the NFAT and C/EBPβ signaling pathways. Inflammatory
  stimuli induce Adamts-1 and Cox-2 upregulation via a molecular mechanisms that involves
  activation of C/EBPβ but not CN signaling.
