caption: 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), is the major genotoxic
  heterocyclic amine generated from cooking meats at high temperatures. PhIP is metabolized
  by CYP forms to its active intermediate, N-Hydroxy-PhIP, which can then be detoxified
  through conjugation by various UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) forms to PhIP-N2-glucuronide
  and PhIP-N3-glucuronide. Alternatively, N-Hydroxy-PhIP can undergo sulfation to
  form N2-Sulfonyloxy-PhIP, which can bind DNA to form carcinogen adducts. Reseveratrol
  is also a substrate for sulfotransferases, and can competitively inhibit the activation
  of PhIP via this pathway. We also hypothesize that other genetic factors related
  to African ancestry interact with the glucuronidation and sulfation pathways of
  N-Hydroxy-PhIP metabolism. Note that we depict only one branch of the PhIP metabolic
  pathway in this figure and further note that SULT1A1 can also react with N-hydroxy-PhIP
  to form 4'-SO4-PhIP that is excreted in urine.
