caption: Oncogenic roles of KRAS and BRAF mutations in CRC development, malignant
  transformation, and metastasis. KRAS mutation activates downstream signaling pathways
  such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3 K/AKT pathways, leading to increased cell proliferation,
  survival, and transformation of normal colorectal epithelial cells into cancerous
  cells. The mutation also affects cellular metabolism and promotes an altered redox
  state, contributing to malignant progression. BRAF mutation is particularly important
  in CRC metastasis, particularly in cells with high levels of glutathione (GSH),
  cells with elevated GSH levels exhibit enhanced resistance to oxidative damage,
  facilitating the metastatic potential of BRAF V600E-mutant CRC cells. This figure
  was created specifically for this article with BioRender
