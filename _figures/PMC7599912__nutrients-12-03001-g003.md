caption: Schematic representation of metabolic Pi sensing in mammals (modified from
  []). Pi sensing in mammals can be divided into the distinct processes of extracellular
  Pi (Pi e) sensing and intracellular Pi (Pi i) sensing. (a) Extracellular Pi can
  be imported into the cell by the sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2b
  (Npt2b), which changes the intracellular Pi concentration. (b) An increase in intracellular
  Pi stimulates synthesis of 5-diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (IP7)
  from inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by the inositol hexakisphosphate kinases 1
  and -2 [,]. IP7 can be further converted into 1,5-bisdiphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4-tetrakisphosphate
  (IP8) by diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases []. Pi efflux through xenotropic
  and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1) maintains the intracellular Pi concentration,
  and this process is stimulated by the binding of IP7 and IP8 to the SPX domain of
  this Pi exporter [,]. (c) In addition to stimulating IP7 and IP8 synthesis, Pi can
  also stimulate ATP flux by serving as a substrate for ATP synthesis at complex V
  of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria and by stimulating the respiratory
  chain directly [,]. ATP inhibits the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway,
  while AMP and ADP activate it [,]. (d) PIT1 and PIT2, similar to Npt2b, function
  as Pi transporters, which raise intracellular Pi. PIT1 and PIT2 also heterodimerize
  in response to Pi and activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and
  2 (ERK1/2) pathway transport-independently [,]. (e) The binding of nanohydroxyapatite
  (nHAp) crystals to the cell surface may bridge PIT1 and FGFR1 []. FGFR1 activates
  the AKT, protein kinase C (PKC), and ERK1/2 pathways. (f) In addition to PIT1, PIT2
  and FGFR1, the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) may also function as an extracellular
  Pi sensor, at least in parathyroid cells [,]. Pi acts at arginine residue 62 of
  the CASR as a non-competitive antagonist [,], thereby inhibiting the inhibitory
  G protein Gi []. Through the actions of AMPK, AKT, PKC, ERK1/2, and G protein, extracellular
  Pi can regulate gene transcription, such as the expression of osteopontin in bone
  cells [,,,] and vascular smooth muscle cells [,]. Pi, inorganic phosphate. Pi e,
