caption: Binding of growth factors (GF) such as FGF2 at RTKs activates ERK-dependent
  signaling cascades (green arrows), resulting in processes that tend to increase
  neurogenesis and produce antidepressant-like behaviors. However, this process also
  results in elevated SPRY2 transcription and activation (phosphorylation), which
  tends to inhibit these processes. Electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) activates GFs
  and inhibits SPRY2, both of which promote neurogenesis and antidepressant-like behaviors.
