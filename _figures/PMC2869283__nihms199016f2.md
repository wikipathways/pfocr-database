caption: 'Proposed migration of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to lungs or other epithelial compartments
  during infections. MIP-1α, MIP-1β and RANTES (ligands for CCR5) produced after infections
  in the pulmonary compartment might have a role in chemoattracting CCR5+ Vγ2Vδ2 T
  cells to the lung from the circulation or lymphoid tissues [–]. Because Vγ2Vδ2 T
  cells also express CXCR3, these cells are probably attracted by chemokines, such
  as MIG, IP-10 and I-TAC. The chemoattracting process and IL-12 might also involve
  the NKPR1a-mediated endothelia migration pathway [–]. It is also probable that chemokines
  produced in the blood by activated Vγ2Vδ2 T cells themselves or other immune cells
  initiate the transendothelial migration of these γδ T cells to the lung from the
  circulation during systemic infection or immune activation. Abbreviations: IL-12,
  interleukin-12; IP-10, interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10; I-TAC, IFN-inducible
  T-cell α-chemoattractant; MIG, monokine induced by IFN-γ; MIP-1α, macrophage inflammatory
  protein-1α; NKRP1a, NK receptor protein 1a (CD161).'
