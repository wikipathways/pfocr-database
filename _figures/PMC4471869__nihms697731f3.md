caption: A model of the spectrum of IL-33 effects on tissue during beneficial and
  pathologic immune responses, with IL-33 cellular pools increasing from left to right.
  (Homeostasis, Blue) IL-33 is present in a restricted subset of cells and cooperates
  with unknown signals to maintain tissue integrity, limit excess inflammation and
  promote tissue adaptation to remodeling and other physiologic stressors. (Amplification,
  Purple) During acute tissue injury and damage, IL-33 synergizes with other epithelial
  cytokines and lymphokines to promote tissue homeostasis and repair (stroke, myocardial
  infarction, wounding). Helminths elicit similar responses. With repetitive tissue
  damage, IL-33 pools increase, regulatory mechanisms are suppressed, inflammation
  is amplified and fibrosis ensues (sclerosis, cirrhosis, allergic disease). (Conversion,
  Red) Generation of IL-12 and other inflammatory signals promotes IL-33 signaling
  on inflammatory cells that are normally unresponsive, while repressing type 2-associated
  responses. Activation of this pathway promotes beneficial responses to infection
  and possibly vaccination, and may support anti-cancer immune responses in certain
  settings. With chronic unresolved inflammation, however, tissue IL-33 increases
  and ultimately contributes to tissue damage (COPD, autoimmune diseases).
