caption: Genetic and pharmacological activation of Wnt/β-catenin promotes neurogenesis
  in the hippocampus of AD models. Schematic representation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. Wnt ligand binds to FZD and LRP5/6, which trigger the recruitment of a
  multiprotein complex composed also of Axin, APC, CK1 and GSK-3β. This prevents the
  phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin that translocates into the nucleus
  where it binds to members of the TCF/LEF families of transcription factors, to modulate
  the transcription of target genes. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling components that are
  target of genetic activation (Wnt3 and Wnt3a) and drugs able to stimulate neurogenesis
  in the hippocampus of animal models of AD are indicated. Red lines indicate inhibition;
  green lines indicate activation. Dotted red line indicates GSK-3β inactivation through
  the PI3K/Akt pathway; dotted green line indicates that the precise mechanism of
  activation of the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling remains elusive. Some of the drugs (see
  text for details) have shown to induce the expression of target genes involved in
  Wnt-mediated induction of proliferation (Cyclin D1) and differentiation (Ngn2 and
  NeuroD1) in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. VPA, valproic acid; Se-Met, Selenomethionine;
  ETH, Ethosuximide; XAN, Xanthoceraside.
