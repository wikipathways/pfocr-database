caption: A high-confidence reaction map of the TSLP signaling pathway. The pathway
  reaction map contains 37 proteins involved in 9 molecular associations, 21 enzyme
  catalysis reactions and 7 translocation events. Apart from the reactions selected
  based on NetSlim criteria, we have also included 2 enzyme complexes namely MTORC1
  and PI3-kinase complex based on the inhibitor assays that confirmed their role in
  TSLP signaling and our phosphoproteomics study (the nodes highlighted in green).
  The edges representing the relationships between nodes are explained in the legend.
