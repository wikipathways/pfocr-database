caption: A generic model of fluid flow mechanotransduction modulation of vascular
  SMC gene expression and function. Vascular SMCs sense flow stimulation via cell
  membrane-related receptors, ion channels, glycocalyx, integrins, as well as primary
  cilia, activating NO, Ca2+, kinases, and MAPKs signaling messengers to shear-sensitive
  genes. Fluid flow mechanotransduction regulates SMC responses including synthesis,
  secretion, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration. Fluid flow
  can stimulate SMC contraction via glycocalyx-mediated Rho-MLCP pathway activation.
  The glycocalyx-mediated mechanotransduction may interact with other mechanosensitive
  structures such as membrane receptors, ion channels, and integrins. Together, fluid
  flow mechanotransduction regulates vascular function and disease.
