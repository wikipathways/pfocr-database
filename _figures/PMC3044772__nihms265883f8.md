caption: TLR4 activation by its ligand such as LPS leads to iNOS induction and increased
  NO production through a MyD88-dependent mechanism. NO protects myocardium via sGC-
  and cGMP/PKG-dependent mechanisms. 1400W, a potent iNOS inhibitor, blocks LPS/TLR4-induced
  NO production and inhibits its cardiac protection. In contrast, Trif is not required
  for the TLR4-mediated cardiac protection. LPS = lipopolysaccharide; iNOS = inducible
  nitric-oxide synthase; MyD88 = myeloid differentiation factor 88; sGC = soluble
  guanylate cyclase; PKG = protein kinase G; TLR = toll-like receptor; Trif = TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing interferon-β–mediated transcription factor.
