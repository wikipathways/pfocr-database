caption: A schematic illustration of the Notch signaling pathway involved in the regulation
  of response of cancer cells to 5-FU via various non-coding RNAs. Notch signaling
  cascade is involved in the various processes of normal morphogenesis, such as cell
  growth, apoptosis, as well as the acquisition of drug resistance. LINC00152 could
  elevate tumor cell migration and invasion, and confer 5-FU resistance in colorectal
  cancer via modulating the expression level of NOTCH1 through sponging miR-139-5p
  and downregulating its function from enhancing CRC development (). Additionally,
  miR-34a acts as a tumor suppressor and could directly downregulate the expression
  level of DLL1 as a ligand of the Notch signaling cascade, and thereby could inhibit
  tumor growth under 5-FU treatment by promoting chemosensitivity to this agent ().
