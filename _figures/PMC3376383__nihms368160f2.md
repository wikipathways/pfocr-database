caption: In Drosophila, the FERM domain protein Expanded has been shown to physically
  interact with Yorkie at the cell membrane and prevent its translocation to the nucleus.
  The adhesion molecule Echinoid co-immunoprecipitates with several Hippo pathway
  components in S2 cells including Yorkie and promotes pathway activation. Fat and
  Crumbs are both large transmembrane proteins that localize to the subapical membrane
  and adherens junctions, respectively, and regulate the subcellular localization
  of Expanded. In addition, Fat is believed to regulate the Hippo/Salvador/Warts (HSW)
  kinase cascade independently of Expanded. In mammals, the adherens junction (AJ)
  protein α-catenin inhibits Yap activity by recruiting it to the cell membrane. In
  a similar fashion, the TJ protein AMOT and the subapical Crumbs complex (Crb3, Pals1
  and PatJ) were recently shown to sequester Yap/Taz to the TJ, thereby inhibiting
  its oncogenic activity. For clarity, interactions with the HSW cascade have been
  omitted from the mammalian cell.
