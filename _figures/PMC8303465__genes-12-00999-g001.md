caption: Gonadal cell-fate during gonad differentiation in mice. Prior to the sex
  determination stage, the bipotential gonad is composed of undifferentiated somatic
  cells (light pink) and germ cells (light blue). Sex differentiation starts with
  the specification (commitment) of the supporting cell progenitors to differentiate
  as either Sertoli cells in the testis or granulosa cells in the ovary. At the sex
  determination stage in XY individuals, the testis determining gene, SRY, starts
  to be expressed in the progenitors of the Sertoli cells (pre-Sertoli cells), leading
  to SOX9 upregulation and Sertoli cell specification. Subsequently, pre-Sertoli cells
  undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition and differentiate into Sertoli cells
  that form the testis cords enclosing the XY germ cells. Sertoli cells follow a male-specific
  genetic program expressing genes such as SOX9, SOX8, DMRT1, and AMH promote the
  differentiation of the steroidogenic Leydig cells and prevent XY germ cells from
  meiosis entry. In mice, all these events are completed within 24–48 h after sex
  determination. In the adult testis, cords become seminiferous tubules with lumen
  and germ cells at different pre-meiotic, meiotic, and post-meiotic stages including
  spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperm. In XX gonads, the male pathway
  is not activated at the sex determination stage due to the lack of SRY and the WNT
  signaling genes, WNT4 and RSPO1, are upregulated in pre-granulosa cells. In the
  mouse, ovary differentiation is delayed with respect to testis differentiation and
  starts with meiosis initiation by XX germ cells, concomitant with the expression
  of further ovarian genes and pathways including FOXL2, TGFβ, and FST. Folliculogenesis
  is completed after birth, when germ cells are surrounded by a layer of granulosa
  cells. Follicle maturation in the mouse ovary begins a few days after birth including
  the proliferation of granulosa cells and the formation of an outer layer of steroidogenic
  theca cells.
