  patterns (PAMPs) can be sensed by membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) such as FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2). (B) FLS2 recruits its co-receptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED
  RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) after perception of the PAMP to trigger rapid stomatal

  is a structural mimic of JA conjugated to isoleucine (JA-Ile) to re-open stomata
  through the JA signaling pathway for more bacteria to infect plants. (D) A schematic
