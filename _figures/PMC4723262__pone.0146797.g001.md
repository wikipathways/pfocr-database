caption: Endocytosis brings TC-bound Cbl species to lysosomes where axial ligands
  are removed by MMACHC and MeCbl or AdoCbl are subsequently formed by SAM and ATP-dependent
  pathways, respectively. MeCbl is a required cofactor for methionine synthase, whose
  activity supports a large number of methylation reactions, including DNA methylation,
  as well as dopamine-stimulated phospholipid methylation, carried out by the D4 dopamine
  receptor (D4R). AdoCbl supports MMACoA mutase in mitochondria. Cysteine, which is
  rate-limiting for GSH synthesis, can be provided either by cellular uptake via the
  cysteine/glutamate transporter EAAT3 (excitatory amino acid transporter 3) or by
  transsulfuration of HCY via cystathionine. The latter pathway is restricted in human
  brain, increasing the importance of growth factor-dependent cysteine uptake by EAAT3.
