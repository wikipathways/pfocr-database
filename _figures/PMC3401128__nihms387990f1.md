caption: Biological scheme. E-cadherin is a single-transmembrane spanning molecule
  that forms homodimers at the cellular membrane and interacts in a zipper-like manner
  with homodimers on neighboring cellular membranes. The cytoplasmic cell-adhesion
  complex of E-cadherin consists of p120, β-catenin, and α-catenin, which links E-cadherin
  homodimers to the actin cytoskeleton. These interactions aid in cell polarity induction
  and epithelium organization. Loss of E-cadherin leads to disassembly of the cytoplasmic
  cell-adhesion complex and release of p120, β-catenin, and α-catenin into the cytoplasm.
  There are two pathways for the β-catenin protein to take once released into the
  cytoplasm. First, β-catenin can be sequestered by the APC/GSK-3β complex and ultimately
  tagged for proteosomal degradation via ubiquitination. Second, upon activation of
  the Wnt signaling pathway or mutation in the APC/GSK3β complex, β-catenin can no
  longer be phosphorylated and tagged for degradation and therefore is translocated
  to the nucleus, where together with TCF/Lef1 transcription factor it modulates the
  expression of target genes. These genes are known to be involved in cell proliferation
  and tumor progression.
