caption: Schematic overview of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. The HR pathway
  requires a double-stranded homolog to serve as a template for the damaged strand,
  and therefore only occurs during the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The
  3′-end of the damaged strand, following end-processing by the MRE11-Rad50-NBS1 complex,
  invades and pairs with the homologous sequence of the sister chromatid. Strand invasion
  leads to the formation of a D-loop structure, from which the lesion-containing strand
  is resynthesized by a DNA polymerase (pol) and finally a resolvase restores the
  two sister chromatids.
