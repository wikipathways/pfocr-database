caption: Proposed model of (defective) AP-3 dependent acquisition of VAMP8 during
  Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB) maturation. WPB in normal endothelial cells (WT, left)
  emerge from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and mature by acquisition of recycled
  membrane proteins, such as CD63 and VAMP8, through endosomal trafficking to the
  WPB membrane via an AP-3 dependent pathway. Recruitment of VAMP8 promotes the secretion
  competence of WPB by supporting the formation of trans-SNARE complexes with STX3
  and STX4, which will allow WPB to undergo exocytosis upon cellular activation. After
  membrane fusion, CD63 and VAMP8 are retrieved and, via the early endosome (EE),
  make their way to another WPB. In the absence of a function AP-3 complex (right),
  such as in HPS-2 or AP3B1−/− BOEC, WPB fail to recruit CD63 from the early endosomes.
  This leads to a global redistribution of cellular CD63, increasing its presence
  on the cell surface during steady state conditions. WPB also fail to acquire (part
  of) their fusion machinery such as VAMP8, resulting in attenuated WPB exocytosis
  in response to cellular activation. Following its failure to transfer to the WPB
  membrane, VAMP8 is possibly rerouted to the lysosome where it is degraded.
