caption: The renin-angiotensin system. The RAS classic axis consists of the membrane
  protein angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII)
  and its specific receptor type1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R). Activation of ACE-AngII-AT1R
  pathway could induce pulmonary vasospasm or aseptic inflammation. Meanwhile, autocrine
  or paracrine signalling of AngII was counterbalanced by membrane protein ACE2, which,
  with ACE, degragates AngI and AngII into protein fragments Ang1-7. The ACE2-Ang1-7-Mas
  pathway, also called the protective arm of RAS, exhibits a protective action in
  the lungs.
