caption: 'T Cell Metabolism. Upon uptake, glucose is converted into G6P before further
  metabolism via glycolysis, the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, or the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Metabolism of glutamine is mitochondria-dependent, where glutamine
  is converted to glutamate, and then the TCA substrate α-ketoglutarate. Fatty acids
  transported into the cell are converted into acyl-CoA, which combines with carnitine
  in order to cross the OMM. Once in the mitochondria, acyl-CoA undergoes beta-oxidation,
  producing acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle and an acyl-CoA with two fewer carbons for
  another cycle of beta-oxidation. Importantly, the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate
  pathway are amphibolic rather than strictly catabolic, and a T cell remains able
  to undergo both anabolic and catabolic processes at once, such as glycolysis and
  fatty acid synthesis. A hallmark of both amphibiolic processes is the production
  of energy rich e- carriers, which are shuttled to the inner mitochondrial membrane
  and the electron transport chain to undergo oxidative phosphorylation. Transporters
  are indicated in blue, and enzymes are indicated in red. Abbreviations: acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC), alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2), fatty acid synthase
  (FASN), glucose 6 phosphate (G6P), inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH), outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).'
