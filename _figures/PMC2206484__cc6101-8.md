caption: Differences in signaling pathway activation of mechanical ventilation with
  and without hyperoxia. In previous in vitro and in vivo studies we found ventilation-induced
  activation of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1), nuclear factor-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) pathways [12,25,32]. In the present study, we found that activation of the
  serine/threonine kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS) pathways was also involved in ventilator-induced neutrophil infiltration,
  cytokine production, and microvascular permeability with and without hyperoxia.
  MIP-2 = macrophage inflammatory protein-2; NF = nuclear factor.
