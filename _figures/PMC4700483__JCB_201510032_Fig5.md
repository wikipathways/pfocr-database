caption: MYC splicing connections in cancer. As described in the text, MYC acts as
  master regulator by controlling the expression of splicing factors hnRNP A1, A2,
  PTBP1, and SRSF1, which promote changes that favor the growth of cancer cells and
  provide positive feedback loops that further stimulate MYC expression. The KRAS–MAPK
  pathway, which is relevant to colorectal cancer (KRAS and BRAF mutations) and melanomas
  (BRAF mutations), converges on the MYC-mediated splicing program through ELK1, which
  stimulates MYC expression, and Sam68, which improves the production of SRSF1 through
  alternative splicing. Red arrows are used to indicate impact on alternative splicing.
