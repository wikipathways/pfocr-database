caption: The cGAS‒STING pathway in inflammatory and IFN responses. cGAS is activated
  upon detecting foreign DNA or self-DNA aberrantly localized in the cytosol. Activated
  cGAS uses ATP and GTP as substrates to synthesize the second messenger cGAMP, which
  binds to and activates STING. STING recruits TBK1, which in turn autophosphorylates
  itself and IRF3, leading to the production of type I IFN. Activated STING also activates
  IKK, which promotes NF-κB nuclear translocation-induced gene expression of inflammatory
  cytokines.
