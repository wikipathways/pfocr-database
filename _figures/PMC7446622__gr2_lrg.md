caption: 'Possible mechanism of oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients following SARS-CoV-2
  infection.Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released by the SARS-CoV-2
  infected cells, to attract the phagocytes. Airway epithelium and phagocytic cells
  (Neutrophils and Monocyte derive macrophage) carry different isoforms of NOXs, which
  trigger the generation of superoxide ions during cellular stress condition and directly
  participate in oxidative stress. Xanthine oxidoreductase is also transformed into
  xanthine oxidase -during stressed cellular environments and triggers ROS generation
  by metabolizing hypoxanthine. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) also enhances oxidative
  stress by initiating the NF-κB pathway and inhibiting the complex II of the electron
  transport chain.TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; TNF-R: Tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; XOR: Xanthine oxidoreductase; XO: Xanthine oxidase;
  ARE: Antioxidant Response Element; Nf-κB: Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; O2: Oxygen molecule; O.−2: Superoxide anion.'
