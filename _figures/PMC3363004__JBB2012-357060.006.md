caption: Signaling pathways involved in IL-4-induced DC-SIGN expression on THP-1 cells.
  ERK signaling pathway plays a main role by transcription factor of Ets-1 to active
  DC-SIGN promoter. JAK-STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways are also involved, which
  may be induced by IL-4/IL-4R directly or by the interactions with ERK pathway indirectly.
