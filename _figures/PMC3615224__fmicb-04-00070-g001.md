caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the serine cycle with the EMC pathway for
  carbon assimilation [adapted from (Peyraud et al., , )]. (B) Schematic representation
  of the serine cycle with the EMC pathway for carbon assimilation (adapted from Anthony,
  ); (C) Schematic representation of the serine cycle with the EMC pathway for carbon
  assimilation in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (see description in the text). (D)
  Central metabolism of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b grown on methane as deduced
  from the genome sequences, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies. Metabolites
  boxed were measured. Box color is an indicator of the metabolite pool, with darker
  colors indicating a larger pool. Numbers under a metabolite names are rates of 13C-carbon
  incorporation: the first number is the rate of CH4-derived carbon; number in parentheses-
  is the rate of CO2-derived carbon incorporation. PHB-polyhydroxybutyrate; F1, 6P,
  Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate; F6P/G6P, fructose-6-phosphate/glucose-6-phosphate; GAP/DHAP,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 2PG/3PG, 2-phosphoglycerate/3-phosphoglycerate.'
