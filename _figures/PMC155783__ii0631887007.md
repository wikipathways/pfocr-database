caption: Proposed pathways for the ExoS-mediated apoptosis. ExoS is delivered into
  host cells through type III machinery. Both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic (or proliferation)
  signaling pathways are implicated. In the proapoptotic pathway, ExoS targets unknown
  intracellular factor(s) to initiate the apoptotic signal, leading to the activation
  of JNK1, which results in cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activation. Caspase
  3 is then activated and executes the apoptosis program. This pathway is also potentiated
  by inhibition of an antiapoptotic pathway by the ExoS, which likely occurs through
  the inhibition of Ras and Ras-associated Raf-MEK-ERK signaling.
