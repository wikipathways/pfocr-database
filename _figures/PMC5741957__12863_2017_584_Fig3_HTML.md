caption: 'Oxidative phosphorelation metabolic pathway. This represents one of the
  14 metabolic pathways identified in this study and is associated with the production
  of respiratory energy in mitochondria, a power house of the cell. Cytochrome c oxidase
  subunit 1 (EC: 1.9.3.1; Additional file ), the enzyme encoded by sorghum gene cox1
  was identified to be involved in the catalytic reaction of the final step of protein
  complex (complex IV) in the electron transport chain. In addition, inorganic diphosphatase
  (EC: 3.6.1.1; Additional file ) was identified to be involved in the electron transport
  system by catalysing the conversion of diphosphate into monophosphate. This enzyme
  controls the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) that should be coupled with adenosine
  dinucleotide phosphate (ADP) in the last step of oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon
  thought to be involved in counteracting an imbalance of reactive oxygen species
  caused by drought stress'
