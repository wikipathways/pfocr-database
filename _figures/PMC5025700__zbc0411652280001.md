caption: 'Schematic showing the sources of NADPH in the mitochondrial matrix. This
  schematic depicts the simplified intermediary oxidative catabolism of energy substrates
  via the mitochondrial Krebs cycle. NADP+ is reduced into NADPH during the oxidation
  of the substrates isocitrate (Isoc), malate (Mal), and glutamate (Glut) via IDH2,
  MEs, and GDH, respectively. In addition, NADPH is also a product of the forward
  reaction of NNT, an enzyme located in the IMM, whose activity is dependent on the
  NAD redox state and the electrochemical potential across the IMM. Enzymes that regenerate
  NADPH are shown in red, and their oxidative reactions are indicated by blue arrows.
  Two isoforms of ME occur in mitochondria and can reduce NADP+; one is specific for
  the NADP coenzyme only. The GDH reaction is coupled to either NAD+ or NADP+ reduction.
  Pyruvate (Pyr), malate, and glutamate, shown in bold, are exogenous substrates used
  to support mitochondrial energy metabolism during most of the experiments in this
  study. Dashed lines represent the aspartate transamination reaction that consumes
  glutamate to form and feed α-ketoglutarate (α-Kg) into the Krebs cycle, which is
  canonically a principal entry pathway for glutamate carbon skeleton. Other abbreviations
  used are as follows: Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; Citr, citrate; Succ-CoA, succinyl-coenzyme
  A; Succ, succinate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Asp, aspartate. For simplicity, fluxes through
  other Krebs cycle enzymes, such as citrate synthase and aconitase, can be equally
  important to NADPH supply via a putative pathway but are not depicted.'
