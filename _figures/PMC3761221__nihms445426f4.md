caption: Diagrammatic representation of adult neural circuitry implicated in (A) fear
  expression and (B) fear extinction. (C) A lack of contextual fear expression in
  adolescent mice can be traced to immature CA1. Without proper CA1-PL and CA1-BA
  inputs, there is a lack of downstream activation of CE output neurons, resulting
  in a diminished or suppressed fear response. (Weak signals and low functional connectivity
  represented by dotted lines). (D) A lack of CA1 excitatory input to IL combined
  with a lack of CA1 inhibitory input to BA, typical in cued fear extinction, results
  in reduced inhibition of CE output neurons, resulting in fear expression and a lack
  of extinction. Arrowheads delineate pathway excitation; straight ends delineate
  pathway inhibition. (BA, basal amygdala; LA, lateral amygdala; CE, central amygdala;
  vmPFC, ventromedial prefrontal cortex; PL, prelimbic cortex; IL, infralimbic cortex;
  ITC, intercalated cells). *For simplicity, connection arrows are delineated as being
  unidirectional, although bidirectional projections exist.
