caption: Proposed model of the effect of koumine (KM) on reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NF-κB/nod-like
  receptor NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) signaling. The NLRP3 inflammasome can
  be activated by multiple stimuli. The priming step or “signal 1” is mediated by
  TLR agonists such as LPS, which results in NF-κB-dependent upregulation of NLRP3
  and pro-IL-1β expression. The assembly step or “signal 2” mediated by stimulation
  with numerous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, nigericin and MSU, promotes ASC oligomerization,
  leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. The stimulation of cells
  with LPS, ATP, nigericin or MSU leads to ROS production and activates both the priming
  and assembly steps, which ultimately leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The
  activated NLRP3 inflammasome then cleaves pro-caspase-1 into activated caspase-1
  and thereby promotes mature IL-1β secretion. KM inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  associated with regulating the ROS/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and consequently suppresses
  IL-1β production.
