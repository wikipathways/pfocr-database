caption: 'The synaptic CSP model proposes that synaptic dysconnectivity may be a common
  pathological pathway across psychiatric disorders with chronic stress component
  – as a predisposition, a trigger, or an outcome. In the PFC, chronic stress is believed
  to induce glial deficit, leading to reduced glutamate reuptake capacity and increased
  extrasynaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity. Subsequently, neuronal atrophy
  develops, resulting in overall reduction in glutamate neurotransmission, which reflects
  reduced dendritic length and branching, and reduction of spines and synapses density.
  In the remaining PFC synapses, the neurotransmission strength is also affected by
  reduced postsynaptic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor (AMPA) receptors. Ketamine reverses this PFC CSP within 24h of injection.
  It is thought that ketamine induces a transient (minutes-to-hours) postsynaptic
  glutamate activation, which leads to upregulation of neurotrophic signaling, increased
  protein synthesis, and sustained (days-to-weeks) restoration of synaptic connectivity.
