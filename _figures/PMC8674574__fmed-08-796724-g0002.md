caption: Cellular signaling in regulating programmed cell death of TECs. Under the
  stimulation of DAMPs/PAMPs, TLR4 is activated and initiates the downstream NOX4
  signal. The enhanced connection between SH3YL1 and the anchoring protein P22phox
  of NOX4, stabilizes and activate NOX4, leading to the production of ROS and further
  mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, RIPK3 can also directly bind and stabilize NOX4
  and bring it to mitochondria, causing mitochondria dysfunction. On the other hand,
  ROS and activated TNFR are the main inducements of necroptosis. In an oxygen-deficient
  environment, mitochondria dysfunction can lead to the production of ROS, which activates
  p53 and causes apoptosis. On the contrary, p53 further activates the formation of
  Bax dimers which are translocated to the outer membrane of mitochondria leading
  to the release of mitochondrial cyto C and other potential proinflammatory substances
  including membrane lipids, ATP, and oxidized form of mtDNA. The substance leaked
  from mitochondria, triggered the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  causing cell pyroptosis. Besides, NLRP3 can also be activated by the PAMPs entered
  through endocytosis. NLRP3 captured adaption protein ASC and further activated caspase-1
  that led to maturation of inflammatory factors IL-18 and IL-1β and the cleavage
  of GSDMD. Moreover, TLR4 can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway which transcriptionally
  regulates the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3. Caspase-11 in mice and
  its homologs in humans (caspase-4/5) can be directly activated by PAMPs, independent
  of NLRP3 activation. Finally, the cleaved GSDMD by caspase-1 formed the structure
  of membrane pores, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, damage
  associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other cellular contents. After releasing
  to the extracellular environment, DAMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines further aggravated
  the necroptosis and pyroptosis, in cycles.
