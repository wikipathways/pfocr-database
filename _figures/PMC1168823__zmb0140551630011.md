caption: A model of IP10 function in regulation of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway
  in HeLa cells. IP10 expression (mimicking CVB3-induced upregulation of IP10) in
  HeLa cells suppresses HPV-18 E6 and E7 oncogene expression and initiates a p53-dependent
  apoptotic pathway through activation of its downstream responsive genes, including
  the PUMA and Bax genes, leading to release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In
  addition, p53 can also downregulate NF-κB expression, leading to the inhibition
  of the transcription of the Bcl-2 gene, a prosurvival gene. On the other hand, IP10-activated
  p53 can upregulate p21 and p27 expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Apoptotic
  cell death or suppressed host cell survival will limit viral replication and reinfection
  or inhibit tumor cell growth.
