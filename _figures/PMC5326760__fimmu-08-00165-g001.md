caption: 'Autophagy pathways converge in the lysosomal compartment. Macroautophagy
  (MA): the phagophore emanates most likely from endoplasmic reticulum-derived membrane
  sources at a PI3P-rich (not depicted) structure called the omegasome. Upon recruitment
  of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) on the outer and inner leaflet
  of the forming autophagosome, cytoplasmic cargo is engulfed and LC3 removed from
  the outer membrane as the autophagosome is closed. The completed vesicles may now
  either be further matured via step-wise fusion with the endocytic compartment resulting
  in the generation of amphisomes or immediately fuse with hydrolytic enzymes-containing
  lysosomes. Chaperone-mediated autophagy: target proteins that contain an exposed
  KFERQ sequence motif are guided in an hsc70-dependent manner toward lysosome-associated
  membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), which resides in the lysosomal membrane. Upon
  unfolding of the target protein, LAMP-2A multimers together with lysosomal hsc70
  facilitate the transport into the lysosomal lumen. LC3-associated phagocytosis:
  ligation of an appropriate receptor (e.g., TLR2, Dectin-1, TIM4, etc.) leads to
  receptor-mediated phagocytosis recruitment and binding of LC3 to the outer membrane
  of the LAPosome. By analogy with the MA pathway, completed LAPosomes may either
  fuse with other endocytic vesicles or directly merge with lysosomes. Microautophagy:
  cytoplasmic cargo can be directly targeted to endosomal compartments/multivesicular
  bodies (MVB) in an hsc70-, phosphatidylserine (Ptd-L-Ser)-, and endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent manner. Exosomes containing cytoplasmic
  material may emanate from the MVB and be secreted into the extracellular space.
  The molecular events and regulatory processes orchestrating the direct invagination
  of cytoplasmic constituents into lysosomes remain largely unbeknownst.'
