caption: Model for competition between the RNAi and the Cid14–TRAMP RNA surveillance
  pathways. In wild-type cells, RDRC and Dicer are recruited to centromeric repeats
  by the RITS complex, which is tethered to chromatin via siRNA-dependent base-pairing
  interactions with noncoding centromeric RNA (cenRNA) and association with H3K9 methylated
  nucleosomes (red lollipops). This results in dsRNA synthesis and the generation
  of repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs), which mediate further RITS recruitment coupled
  to H3K9 methylation by the Clr4-containing CLRC methyltransferase complex. The TRAMP
  complex targets rRNA fragments for exosomal degradation. In cid14Δ cells, rRNA fragments
  accumulate and become substrates for RDRC and Dicer. This titrates RDRC and Dicer
  away from cenRNA, resulting in the generation of rRNA-siRNAs (rr-siRNAs) and a reduction
  in rasiRNAs.
