caption: Alterations to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway
  and outcome prediction in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). (A) The PI3K/Akt
  signalling pathway is altered through several mechanisms. Alteration frequencies
  are expressed as the percentage of all cases. Activated genes are shown in red and
  inactivated genes in blue. (B) Patterns of gene alterations in the PI3K/Akt signalling
  pathway. Alterations to the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway genes were observed in 42%
  of cases. (C) Kaplan–Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) for the activation
  status of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Overall survival was significantly higher
  in patients with activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway compared with those
  with no activation of this pathway.
