caption: (a) In normal hepatocytes, glucose utilization by the pentose phosphate pathway
  (blue) yields NADPH, which feeds the GSH and Trx1 systems (yellow). These systems
  maintain cytosolic redox homeostasis, drive RNR, and reduce L-cystine into cysteine.
  MTS (red) supplies SAM for methylation reactions and provides an alternative source
  of cytosolic cysteine, which is used for protein- (green) and GSH-synthesis. (b)
  Concomitant genetic ablation of GR and TrxR1 (red “Ø”) in TR/GR-null livers uncouples
  glucose oxidation and NADPH from the major disulfide reduction systems. In this
  case, MTS uses dietary methionine to provide an alternative source of cytosolic
  cysteine. This cysteine is sufficient to support protein synthesis and to serve
  as the sole source of cytosolic disulfide reduction power in TR/GR-null livers without
  the use of NADPH. (c) Balanced reaction for utilization of two electrons of reducing
  power in TR/GR-null hepatocytes. Gcl, glutamate-cysteine ligase; Gss, GSH-synthase;
  PPPi, inorganic triphosphate; X, any methyl- (Me-) acceptor for SAM-dependent methyl
  transferase activity.
