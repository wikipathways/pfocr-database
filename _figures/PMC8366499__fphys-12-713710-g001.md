caption: 'The net excretion of urate in the human urine depends on the balance between
  urate reabsorption and secretion, mediated by separate sets of urate transporters
  in the proximal tubule. (A) Urate reabsorption: The sodium-driven SMCT1 and SMCT2
  transporters increase the intracellular pool of organic anions such as nicotinate
  or pyrazinoate (PZA), which function in urate/anion exchange mediated by URAT1 and
  OAT10. OAT4 in contrast exchanges apical urate for divalent anions. The membrane
  potential-driven GLUT9a functions as the exclusive exit pathway for reabsorbed urate
  from proximal tubule into blood. (B) Urate secretion: In a sodium dependent process
  involving the collaboration of NADC3, urate enters at the basolateral membrane in
  exchange with alpha-ketoglutarate, mediated by OAT1 and OAT3. Urate is transported
  across the apical surface into the tubular lumen via MRP4, ABCG2, NPT1, and NPT4.
  (C) Regulation of urate transport by insulin signaling: Insulin binding to its receptor
  (INSR) leads to the activation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Akt, ERK1/2,
  p38 MAPK and PKC. The general effect of insulin on urate transport (reabsorption
  or secretion) is indicated. Genistein, a phosphotyrosine kinase (PTK)-specific inhibitor;
  LY 295002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor; PD98059, a MEK/ERK-specific inhibitor; SB
  203580, a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor; BMI, bisindolylmaleimide 1-hydrochloride,
  a protein kinase C (PKC)-specific inhibitor.'
