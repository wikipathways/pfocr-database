caption: IL-37-mediated intracellular signaling cascades in eosinophils for the suppression
  of allergic airway inflammation. Interaction of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) with
  bacterial cell wall component leads to the activation of intracellular signaling
  cascades in eosinophils with subsequent intercellular interaction with airway epithelial
  cells. Signaling molecules Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2,
  and IκB are phosphorylated to initiate the downstream transcription of target genes
  for cell survival and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which deteriorate
  allergic inflammation. Furthermore, transcriptional level of CAMP, PYCARD, and S100A9
  is upregulated in allergic inflammation. CAMP (LL37) protein is capable of triggering
  TLR3 on bronchial epithelial cells, which also activates signaling molecules and
  results in asthma deterioration. PYCARD functions as an adapter in diverse types
  of inflammasomes, such as AIM2 inflammasome, NLRC4 inflammasome, NLRP3 inflammasome,
  to activate caspase-1 and lead to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokine such
  as IL-1β. S100A9 triggers the production of mucin protein MUC5AC in airway epithelial
  cells, which contributes to mucin hyper-production in airway, and activates nuclear
  factor-κB pathway to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which result
  in exacerbation of airway inflammation. IL-37 is capable of attenuating phosphorylation
  of Akt, ERK1/2, and IκB in eosinophils, with subsequent downregulating transcriptional
  level of CAMP, PYCARD, and S100A9 in eosinophils, thereby ameliorating allergic
  airway inflammation.
