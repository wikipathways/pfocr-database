caption: 'Integration of the different components of ethylene, cytokinin, ABA and
  light signaling pathways in multistep phosphorelay in temperature and light responses.
  (A) Heat stress: similarly to drought and osmotic stress, heat stress also enhances
  ABA and ethylene levels while downregulating cytokinin levels and the expression
  of cytokinin receptors (AHK2, 3, 4). ETR1 and ERF1 play a positive role in heat
  tolerance; however, downstream components of ABA (PYR/PYL/RCAR, PP2Cs, SnRK2s, and
  ABFs) are downregulated. (B) Cold stress: low temperature reduces the levels of
  cytokinin, but activates cytokinin receptors (AHKs), putatively in a cytokinin-independent
  manner. Several downstream components of the cytokinin signaling pathway are also
  activated (AHP2,3,5, B-ARR 1, A-ARR 5, 6, 7, 15) by cold temperature and correlated
  with enhanced cold tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana (modified from ). phyB was
  demonstrated to be a temperature sensor, which interacts with ARR4, the key regulator
  providing a molecular link between MSP and light (and possibly temperature) signaling.
  Light response: light can also attenuate the levels of ethylene. ETR1 and EIN4 expression
  are dependent on light stimulation. ETR1 also genetically interacts with both phyA
  and phyB that govern germination and the growth response to various light regimes.
  Cytokinins were also shown to maintain photoprotective mechanisms during high light
  stress, mediated by AHK2 and AHK3. See the main text for a detailed description
  of each signaling pathway and their crosstalk in response to stress. Color code:
  MSP signaling is depicted in green, ethylene signaling in blue, light signaling
  in ochre, abscisic acid in purple. The His/Asp phosphorylation is depicted by circled
  P in bright yellow, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in orange. Created with BioRender.com.'
