caption: Apoptosis extrinsic and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways. Schematic representation
  of the extrinsic activation pathway and the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. The
  extrinsic pathway can be activated through transmembrane death receptors (i.e.,
  Fas, TRAIL, etc.) that detect extracellular stress signals or through dependence
  receptors (i.e. Uncoordinated 5 A-D (Unc5A-D), Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC)
  which are activated when the correspondent ligand concentration is below a critical
  threshold; the intrinsic pathway is activated through intracellular stimuli, such
  as genotoxic damage, elevated calcium concentration or oxidative stress. The B-cell
  lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins participate in this pathway.
