caption: Foxi3 inhibits epithelial differentiation and promotes suprabasal cell formation.
  Schematic illustration of the key findings in this article. At the bud stage at
  E13.5, loss of Foxi3 leads to a lack of suprabasal cells and upregulation of signaling
  pathway components in the epithelium. At E16, markers of SEKs and cervical loops
  become expanded. The key genes identified were Krt10 (K10), Krt1 (K1) and Notch2
  in suprabasal cells and p21, Fgf15 and Sfrp5, in addition to several PEK and SEK
  markers, as indicators of differentiation. WT, wild type.

  crown patterning.
