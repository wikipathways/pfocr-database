caption: Roles of hnRNPs in the impaired granulocytic differentiation of BCR/ABL transformed
  myeloid progenitor cells. Both hnRNP E2 and FUS function as the downstream regulators
  of BCR/ABL oncoprotein and have been implicated in chronic myelogenous leukemia
  by preventing granulocytic differentiation from myeloid progenitor cells through
  inhibiting G-CSFR and blocking G-CSF signaling, which finally disrupt the normal
  myeloid cell differentiation or maturation pathway, resulting in myeloid progenitor
  cell accumulation abnormally in the bone marrow and circulation.
