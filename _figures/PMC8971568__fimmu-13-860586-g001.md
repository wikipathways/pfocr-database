caption: A simplified schematic representation of lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolic
  networks mainly involve catabolism (fatty acid oxidation (FAO)), anabolism (de novo
  lipogenesis) and storage as lipid droplets (LDs). Lipid raft are microdomains of
  the plasma membrane enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. The uptake of various
  lipids undergoes a series of processes and oxidation in the mitochondrion, which
  leads to the production of energy (substantial ATP) and ROS. Acetyl CoA, the end
  product of FAO pathway, can then either enter TCA cycle or synthesize multiple lipids,
  such as cholesterol and fatty acids. Lipids or derivatives of the lipid metabolism
  can activate transcription factors, including PPAR, LXR, then regulate activities
  of transporters to modulate downstream signals. Dyslipidemia, the disruption of
  lipid metabolism, is mainly characterized by elevated plasma levels of LDL, TG),
  TC), and reduced HDL.
