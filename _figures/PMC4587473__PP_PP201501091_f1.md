caption: Outline of the major pathway for Trp-dependent  synthesis and the proposed
  Trp-independent route. The role proposed for Trp synthase beta (TSB) homologs discussed
  in the present paper is also shown. For clarity, reactions are simplified to show
  only the major compounds relevant to  synthesis.
