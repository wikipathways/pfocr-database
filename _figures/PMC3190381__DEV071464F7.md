caption: JAK/Stat signaling regulates phase 3 tin expression. During St10, the JAK/Stat
  pathway is active in one region of each mesoderm segment (dark blue) and largely
  inactive in the opposing region (light blue). The Tin-responsive Stat92E mesoderm
  enhancer contains an SCBS (see Fig. S4 and Table S1 in the supplementary material)
  and directs segmental expression at St10 (). Upd and Upd2 activate the JAK/Stat
  pathway and induce phosphorylation of maternally contributed Stat92E (M-Stat). Tin
  and M-Stat co-activate zygotic expression of Stat92E, which induces segmental expression
  of the E(spl)-C gene HLHm5. HLHm5 then represses tin to establish the phase 3 expression
  pattern in the dorsal mesoderm. tin expression is sustained in the region of the
  segment where JAK/Stat signaling is not active. Images on the right show Phase-2
  and Phase-3 Tin expression. Embryos are oriented with anterior to the left.
