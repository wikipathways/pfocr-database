caption: Proximal components of the TNF signaling pathway. TNFR1 transduces apoptotic
  signals through the recruitment of FADD and caspase 8, and inflammatory signals
  through the recruitment of RIP1 and TRAF2. TNFR2 binds TRAF1 and TRAF2 in order
  to transduce inflammation signals. IKK is an enzyme involved in the degradation
  of the inhibitor IKB, which binds NF-κB to inhibit its function. NF, nuclear factor;
  TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, TNF receptor type 1; FADD, Fas-associated death
  domain protein; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1; TRAF1, TNF-receptor-associated
  factor 1; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase.
