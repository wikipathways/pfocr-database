caption: De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase II
  (CPS2), the cytosolic form of the enzyme CPS1 found in the mitochondrial matrix
  taking part in the urea cycle, catalyses the reaction leading to the formation of
  carbamoyl phosphate from HCO3−, glutamine, ATP and water. The generated carbamoyl
  phosphate and aspartate are used to generate pyrimidines though the steps as seen
  above. Note that thymidine 5ʹ-triphosphate (TTP), another pyrimidine is generated
  from CTP. Those marked * are components of the CAD complex.,,
