caption: 'D2 is expressed in skeletal muscle and is involved in muscle differentiation
  and regeneration. T4 and T3 reach the myoplasm by MCT8/10-mediated transport [].
  T4-to-T3 activation is mediated by the type 2 deiodinase (D2), whereby T3 acts by
  binding to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and activates the expression
  of key muscle proteins, such as myosin heavy chain (MHC) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Muscle D2 is subject to regulation by (i) bile acids via the
  TGR5–cAMP pathway, and (ii) via adrenergic stimulation []. In addition, D2-generated
  T3 could reach the blood stream via the iodothyronine transporters and contribute
  to serum T3 supplies. After muscle injury, muscle precursor cells (here represented
  by satellite cells – SC) are activated and D2 expression and D2-dependent T3 production
  are upregulated locally, driving differentiation and complete skeletal muscle regeneration
  via T3-dependent expression of MyoD, a master myogenic regulatory factor. In the
  figure: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum and TGR5, G protein-coupled bile acid receptor
  1 (GPBAR1).'
