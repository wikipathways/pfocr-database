caption: During glycolysis, glucose is converted into pyruvate in a sequential enzymatic
  reaction. Pyruvate can shuttle to the mitochondria and inter into the TCA cycle
  for energy generation and/or biomass synthesis or alternatively converted into lactate
  by LDHA and secreted from cells. Many glycolytic enzymes are highly dysregulated
  (red in color) in several ways;, p53 and HIF-1α/MYC negatively and positively regulate
  expression of key glycolytic enzymes in cancer cells. Tumor cells display altered
  expression in some of the TCA cycle-related enzymes due to genetic mutations/alterations
  (red asterisk). Gluconeogenesis pathway generates glucose via antagonizing glycolysis.
  It has enzymatic overlap with glycolysis and utilizes seven out of ten enzymes of
  glycolysis along with three unique. Glutamine can also generate energy through the
  TCA cycle after converting into α-Ketoglutarate by enzymes glutaminase (GLS) and
  glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Citrate from the TCA cycle can be secreted out into
  the cytoplasm and utilized in fatty acid synthesis.
