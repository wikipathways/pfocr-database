  751 amino acids, isoform a). SANT: SANT SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR and TFIIIB” DNA-binding
  domain, CXC: Tesmin/TSOl-like CXC domain, SET: Su (var)3–9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax.
  B EZH2 serves as an upstream mediator of non-coding RNAs expression in HNSCC and
  is associated with the STAT3 pathway. Due to its transcriptional role, this pathway
  can target miRNAs to affect cancer cell proliferation, drug resistance, EMT process,
  and invasion, thereby determining cancer cell response to treatment'
