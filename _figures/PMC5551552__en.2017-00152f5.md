caption: 'Schematic summarizing findings and proposed mechanism of placental lipid
  metabolism in obese women. Long-chain FA (e.g., palmitate, C16:0), once taken up
  by the trophoblast, preferentially enter the esterification pathway, due to the
  upregulation (red) of several key components under the transcriptional control of
  PPARγ: SCD1 catalyzes the desaturation of palmitate to its monounsaturated counterpart,
  palmitoleate (C16:1), one of the most abundant FA in PL, triglycerides, and cholesterol
  esters; DGAT1 is the final committed step in triglycerides synthesis. As a result,
  rates of palmitate esterification are higher in placentas of obese women, as are
  content of PL, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters. Low expression (green) of
  PPARα, a transcriptional activator of CPT1 (a key enzyme necessary for palmitate
  entry into mitochondria), and PGC1-α (involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis), results
  in fewer mitochondria (evidenced by low CytB). Lower mitochondrial content drives
  palmitate to peroxisomes, whose β-oxidation machinery (DBP, COT) is upregulated,
  shortening the excess palmitate, thus allowing the smaller FA (<8 carbons) to bypass
  CPT1 and enter the mitochondria via diffusion, or the upregulated components of
  the carnitine shuttle (CACT, CPT2), thus maintaining overall β-oxidation capacity.'
