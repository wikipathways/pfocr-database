caption: On the surface of vascular cells, ENPP1 (the protein encoded by the ectonucleotide
  pyrophosphatase–phosphodiesterase 1 gene) converts ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate
  (PPi), and CD73 converts AMP to adenosine and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Pyrophosphate
  inhibits calcification, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) degrades
  pyrophosphate, and adenosine inhibits TNAP. Deficiency of CD73 results in decreased
  adenosine levels, eliminating the inhibition of TNAP from the pathway either directly
  or by way of adenosine receptor signaling. Increased TNAP from the pathway activity
  results in decreased pyrophosphate and increased cell calcification.
