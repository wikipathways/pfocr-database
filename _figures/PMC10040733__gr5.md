caption: Potential mechanism or kidney-muscle interplay in the progression of CKD
  and sarcopeniaIn CKD, reduced clearance elevates plasma levels of urea. In turn,
  increased uremia impairs insulin action on the skeletal muscle leading to a reduction
  of both insulin-dependent glucose and phosphate uptake causing metabolic dysregulation.
  Hyperphosphatemia is then the consequence of both reduced renal clearance and low
  uptake by the skeletal muscle. Metabolic dysregulation in the skeletal muscle is
  characterized by low phosphate, reduced glucose oxidation and protein synthesis
  and overall low ATP and phosphocreatine levels with AMPD1 activation. Hyperactive
  AMPD1, in turn, decreases the amount of AMP while promoting the formation of uric
  acid in the purine degradation pathway. As a result of a negative energy balance
  in the muscle, inflammation and protein turnover is manifest thus leading to muscle
  atrophy. In consequence, muscle-derived products from protein catabolism and AMPD1
  activation are released to the circulation to further contribute to the progression
  of CKD.
