caption: (A) General mechanism for binding of Na+ ions and substrate (S) on the extracellular
  side of the glutamate transporter (T). The conformational state with the amino acid
  substrate binding sites exposed to the cytoplasm is termed T′′. T′ denotes a state
  of EAAC1 that is formed with the rate constant k 1 after initial Na+ and amino acid
  substrate binding and is competent for binding of further sodium ion(s). K Na+1/2(V)
  and K Na+2/3(V) are the voltage-dependent dissociation constants of Na+ from the
  transporter, and K S is the dissociation constant of the substrate. The voltage-dependent
  translocation of the fully loaded carrier is characterized by the rate constants
  k f for the forward transition and k −f for the backward reaction. k b represents
  the rate constant for the relocation of the empty carrier. Potassium ion dissociation
  on the extracellular side and proton binding and dissociation steps were neglected
  for the sake of simplicity. (B) Hypothetical mechanism of the anion conductance
  of EAAC1. SCN− is shown here as an example of an anion with high permeability. Na+
  binding to the empty transporter (with a negatively charged binding site) at a site
  within the transmembrane electric field or to the transporter with negatively charged
  glutamate bound to it leads to the activation of an anion permeant pathway through
  the carrier.
