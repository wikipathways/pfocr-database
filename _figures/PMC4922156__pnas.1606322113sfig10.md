caption: Working model of P. syringae HopAF1 function. Plant pathogens such as P.
  syringae and X. campestris deliver multiple T3E proteins into plant cells, including
  HopAF1 and AvrXv3, respectively. Recognition of PAMPs, such as flg22, a peptide
  derived from bacterial flagellin, by PRRs such as FLS2 triggers a signal cascade
  that results in multiple outputs, collectively termed PTI. Through perception of
  PAMPs, such as flg22, and activation of a MAPK cascade, PTI leads to an increase
  in ethylene biosynthesis. Our data suggest that HopAF1 inhibits PTI. Our data are
  consistent with the model that HopAF1 is targeted to the plant plasma membrane via
  acylation, where it inhibits the function of the Yang cycle proteins MTN1 and MTN2,
  which are required for the induced level of ethylene that occurs during PTI. As
  a result, the induced amount of ethylene that occurs during PTI may be an important
  output, making the Yang cycle an important component of the plant defense pathway
  and HopAF1 a critical T3E that prevents high ethylene accumulation during the plant
  defense response by targeting the Yang cycle. Furthermore, we have identified two
  asparagines in Arabidopsis MTN1 and MTN2 that are potential targets of HopAF1-mediated
  deamidation. Further research is required to determine whether HopAF1 deamidates
  or modifies Arabidopsis MTNs or itself.
