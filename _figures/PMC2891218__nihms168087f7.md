caption: Possible interactions between cholinergic and eCB signaling in the toxicity
  of organophosphorus anticholinesterases. OPs may enhance eCB signaling either indirectly
  through acetylcholinesterase inhibition or directly by binding to components of
  the eCB pathway. Extensive acetylcholinesterase inhibition will increase synaptic
  acetylcholine levels and prolong cholinergic receptor activation to elicit cholinergic
  signs of toxicity. Depolarization of postsynaptic neurons can lead to release of
  eCBs and modulation of neurotransmitter release. Prolonged cholinergic receptor
  activation can stimulate downstream non-cholinergic neurons. Glutamatergic neuron
  activation through NMDA receptors can increase intracellular Ca++ levels and cellular
  toxicity, or through metabotropic MGluR receptors can lead to eCB release that may
  attenuate further recruitment of downstream signaling and toxicity. Postsynaptic
  muscarinic M1/M3 receptor activation leads to receptor-mediated eCB release to activate
  CB1 receptors and inhibit ACh release at the presynaptic cholinergic terminal. Upon
  release, AEA can activate CB1 receptors (extracellularly) to inhibit neurotransmitter
  release and TRPV1 receptors (intracellularly) to increase Ca++ influx, while 2-AG
  acts at the CB1 receptor but not at the TRPV1 site. In the direct pathway, some
  OPs may bind to molecular components of eCB signaling to alter CB1 receptor activation,
  eCB synthesis, eCB degradation or eCB uptake and modulate cholinergic and/or non-cholinergic
  neurotransmitter release. Direct FAAH inhibition by some OPs can increase intracellular
  AEA, and in some neurons, this may lead to increased TRPV1 activation, elevated
  intracellular Ca++ and decreased 2-AG signaling. Reduced 2-AG signaling could in
  turn reduce eCB mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release, enhancing cholinergic
  and non-cholinergic signaling. Direct inhibition of MAGL by some OPs may in turn
  selectively increase 2-AG signaling.
