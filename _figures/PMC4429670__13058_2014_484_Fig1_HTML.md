caption: Vicious cycles in bone metastasis. In the classic vicious cycle of bone metastasis
  [], tumor cells stimulate osteolysis by releasing factors (such as interleukins
  and parathyroid hormone-related protein) that increase receptor activator of nuclear
  factor kappa-B (RANK) ligand (RANKL, shown as lollipops), which activates osteoclasts
  (by binding to the RANK receptor, shown as Y’s) to resorb bone. Bone resorption
  releases growth factors from matrix (such as transforming growth factor beta), which
  in turn stimulate tumor cells. In multiple myeloma (MM), an additional vicious cycle
  occurs. Active osteoblasts make new bone and secrete factors that antagonize tumor
  growth. MM and breast cancer cells secrete osteoblast blockers, such as sclerostin
  (Sost) and DKK1 (both inhibitors of the WNT pathway), thus potentially fending off
  osteoblast-mediated growth inhibition and causing increased bone loss, because tumor
  now increases osteoclastic bone destruction and suppresses compensatory new bone
  formation. The authors speculate that a similar secondary vicious cycle occurs in
  osteolytic bone metastases because of breast cancer. The role of abundant osteocytes
  in bone metastasis is unclear, although these cells are a major source of sclerostin
  and RANKL. FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.
