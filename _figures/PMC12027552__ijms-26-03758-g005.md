caption: 'Correlation network diagram of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
  differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway
  under FR and UVA treatments. CK: The red-to-blue light ratio is maintained at 7:3
  (7R3B); FR: 7R3B + far red light; UVA: 7R3B + ultraviolet-A light. Diamonds represent
  metabolites, and circles represent genes, with the correlation between them shown
  using straight lines. Positive correlations are represented by orange lines, while
  negative correlations are represented by green or blue lines, and the larger the
  absolute value of the correlation coefficient, the darker the color of the lines.
  The larger the gene or metabolite node, the larger the degree of enrichment. The
  node color represents the log2 fold change (log2 FC) in the expression difference
  in differentially expressed genes or metabolites, with colors leaning toward yellow
  or orange indicating log2 FC > 0, and colors leaning toward green or blue indicating
  log2 FC < 0'
