caption: Proposed pathway by which GIP increases Bcl-2 transcription in pancreatic
  β cells. GIP binding to the G protein-coupled GIP receptor (GIPR) activates a stimulatory
  G protein (Gs), resulting in stimulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) and accumulation
  of cAMP. Active PKA catalytic subunits (C), released following cAMP binding to PKA
  regulatory subunits, enter the nucleus and phosphorylate CREB (white arrow). An
  associated decrease in phosphorylation and activity of AMPK is thought to result
  in dephosphorylation of TORC2, thus allowing increased translocation from the cytoplasm
  into the nucleus. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory pathways mediated by AMPK phosphorylation
  of TORC2, resulting in cytoplasmic retention, and PKA inhibition of AMPK, allowing
  TORC2 dephosphorylation. TORC2 complexes with phospho-CREB Ser133 in the nucleus
  and binds to CRE-I of the rat Bcl-2 promoter, thus turning on the transcriptional
  machinery for up-regulation of Bcl-2.
