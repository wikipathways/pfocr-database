caption: Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) signaling as a biosensor for dietary fat. According
  to the model shown in this figure, fat digestion in the small-intestinal lumen releases
  free oleic acid, which is internalized by the enterocytes and funneled either toward
  the formation of chylomicrons, or toward the production of OEA through the NAT/NAPE-PLD
  pathway (see ). The latter process requires CD36, but the exact roles of this cell-membrane
  protein are unclear. In addition to enabling oleic acid transport, CD36 might regulate
  the activities of NAPE-PLD and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), possibly by recruiting
  intracellular signal transduction pathways (symbolized by the arrows). Newly formed
  OEA binds to PPAR-α, which activates sensory fibers of the vagus nerve through an
  as-yet undefined mechanism, leading to the enhancement of satiety.
