caption: Summary diagram of transport, signaling and degradation of vitamin A metabolism
  and RA synthesis. Retinol is transported throughout the vasculature and taken up
  by target cells where it is oxidized in a two-step reaction into retinoic acid (RA).
  β-carotene provides an alternative pathway by conversion into retinal by BCDO1 (b-carotene-15,15-dioxygenase).
  Once converted, RA can diffuse from the synthesizing cell and is either degraded
  by CYP26 enzymes or regulates cell signaling in target cells.
