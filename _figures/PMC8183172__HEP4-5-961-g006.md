caption: 'Summary of metabolic pathways associated with ALD progression. Our data
  suggested the dysregulation in cellular energy supply pathway during ALD progression.
  The high NADH/NAD+ ratio, as a consequence of alcohol metabolism, inhibits the TCA
  cycle by inhibiting two irreversible enzymic reactions: isocitrate dehydrogenase–mediated
  isocitrate decarboxylation and α‐KG dehydrogenase complex–mediated α‐KG decarboxylation.
  As a result, this leads to the suppression of intermediary metabolites, fatty acid
  oxidation, carbohydrate catabolism, and the reduction of energy supply (ATP) from
  nutrients. The energy supply disturbance may interfere with bile acid secretion,
  an ATP‐dependent process through bile acid transporters. An increase in the level
  of proteolysis markers is also observed during the disease progression. Abbreviations:
  AA, amino acid; CoA, coenzyme A; OAA, oxaloacetate; TG, triglyceride.'
