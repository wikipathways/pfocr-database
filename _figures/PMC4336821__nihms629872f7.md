caption: Exposure to hydrophobic BAs induces oxidative stress through ROS generation
  and further activates TNFα-mediated signaling. BA-induced TNFα activates AP1 (c-FOS/c-JUN)
  and NFκB, which sequentially enhance Nur77 expression. Up-regulated Nur77 enriches
  at the NBRE of pro-survival targets genes (CDK4, CCND2, BRE, RBBP8, MAP4K5, and
  STAT5A) to induce their expression, thereby promoting a Nur77-dependent survival
  pathway. Conversely, Nur77 also up-regulates BID expression which likely contributes
  to BA-induced cell death. Additionally, RXRα and RARβ regulate Nur7 nuclear export
  by forming a complex with Nur77. Cytosolic Nur77 interacts with and converts Bcl2
  into a death molecule, inducing apoptosis. These pathways are based on data generated
  in the present study and previously published data (Ref , , , , and ). Genes that
  showed induction in Huh7, but not in HCT116 cells are indicated in grey.
