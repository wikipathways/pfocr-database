caption: DAPK2 is a novel modulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Death receptor ligation
  by TRAIL primarily activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. TRAIL binding induces
  DISC formation. Activation of the initiator caspases-8/10 leads to proteolytic cleavage
  and activation of downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, which eventually
  culminates in apoptosis. TRAIL can also activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  via BID. This involves depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential via
  BAK and BAX, followed by cytochrome c release and downstream activation of caspase-9.
  Resistance mechanisms can occur at many different stages of the cascade. c-FLIP
  can inhibit the activation of initiator caspases within the extrinsic pathway, XIAP
  can block the action of effector caspases and antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2
  family, such as BCL-XL and BCL-2, which are known inhibitors of the intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. Depletion of DAPK2 triggers the activation of NF-κB and leads to NF-κB-mediated
  induction of DR5 mRNA and to an increase in DR5 protein levels. The increase in
  the number of DR5 molecules presumably overcomes the inhibition threshold and lead
  to the resensitisation of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
