caption: 'Molecules and pathways involved in the effect of statins on NO production
  by endothelial cells. : Molecule has become unavailable or inactivate or the signaling
  pathway is suppressed, : Increase or decrease in the amount, : Molecule is activated.
  GGPP: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, ROCK: Rho-associated protein kinase, PI3k: Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase, Akt: Protein kinase B, AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase, miR: micro
  RNA, HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1, BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin, Nox: NADPH oxidase, Cav-1:
  caveolin-1, GTPCH: guanosine-5-triphosphate cyclohydrolase, CRP: C reactive protein,
  NO: nitric oxide, eNOS: endothelial NO synthase, ROS: reactive oxygen species. It
  is noteworthy that Rac1 is actually a downstream signal for GGPP and the statin-mediated
  inactivation of GGPP reduces Rac1 level but as statins exert a direct inductive
  effect on Rac1, the up-regulation of Rac1 and its downstream signaling are shown
  separately here.'
