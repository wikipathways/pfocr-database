caption: 'GH and IGF-1 Regulation of Three Metabolic Pathways. GH inhibits glucose
  uptake in peripheral tissues and promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis,
  while IGF-1 stabilizes blood glucose levels by enhancing glucose utilization and
  insulin sensitivity. In lipid metabolism, GH activates hormone-sensitive lipase
  (HSL), promoting triglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue and steroidogenesis in
  adrenal glands, and reducing total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, with IGF-1 complementing these effects by improving
  lipid profiles. In protein metabolism, GH and IGF-1 enhance protein synthesis through
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, with GH also increasing amino acid uptake and
  reducing protein degradation, thereby stabilizing protein metabolism. GH, Growth
