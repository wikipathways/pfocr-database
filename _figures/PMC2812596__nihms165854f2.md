caption: Target genes, Gnas, Got2 and Snord32a, following tenofovir exposure of primary
  osteoclasts. A. Gnas or stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit (GαS) is a key part
  of the classic signal transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions
  with the activation of adenylate cyclase and a variety of cellular responses (including
  the MEK-Erk signaling pathway). B. Got2 (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2)
  is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in energy transduction, specifically amino acid
  metabolism as well as the urea and tricarboxylic acid cycles. C. Snord32a (small
  nucleolar RNA, C/D box 32A) is a member of the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) group
  of highly abundant, non-polyadenylated, non-coding transcripts. The C/D box snoRNAs
  are associated with methylation, and specifically guide site-specific 2′-O-methylation
  of RNAs, which impact gene expression.
