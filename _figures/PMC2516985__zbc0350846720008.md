caption: Cross-talk pathway in RSV infection. Shown is a schematic model that  shows
  the signaling cascade downstream of RIG-I that diverges to activate the  canonical,
  noncanonical, and cross-talk pathways. The presence of RSV dsRNA is  sensed by the
  cytosolic RIG-I helicase, which associates with the  mitochondrial bound MAVS via
  heterotypic CARD domain interactions. This  complex mediates activation of the typical
  IKK resulting in RelA release from  IκBα-sequestered complexes. In parallel, the
  NIK·IKKα  complex is activated, resulting in activation of the noncanonical and  cross-talk
  pathway by stimulating the 100-kDa NF-κB2 proteolysis.  Mito, mitochondria; p65,
  RelA.
