caption: 'The BRN2 and AP1/TEADs transcriptional networks in melanoma phenotype switching.
  Left: BRN2 signaling is activated by various pathways, including RAS/RAF/MAPK (,
  ), PI3K/PAX3 (, ), Wnt/β-catenin (), and TNFα/MYC (, ) pathways. BRN2 mediates melanoma
  cell dedifferentiation by inhibiting MITF transcription (), while MITF in turn represses
  BRN2 through miR-211 (). BRN2 promotes melanoma cell invasion through transcriptional
  repression of the PDE5A, resulting in accumulated levels of cGMP and ultimately
  increased cell contractility (, ). BRN2 also induces NFIB (), Notch1, and DLL1 (),
  which together promote melanoma phenotype switching through EZH2 (, ) and subsequent
  activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling (, ). Middle: The AP-1 complex composed
  of c-Jun and Fra1 is activated downstream of the MAPK pathway (, , ) and several
  extracellular ligands, such as TGFβ, TNFα and WNT5A (, , –). AP-1 suppresses MITF
  through the Fra1 transcriptional target HMGA1 (), while MITF binds to the JUN promoter
  and blocks its transcription (, ). AP-1 also upregulates the expression of AXL (,
  ), NGFR (), and CD73 (), driving phenotype switching to the invasive and therapy
  resistant state (, ). Right: Downstream of Hippo, TGFβ, EGFR, and Wnt/β-catenin
  pathways (), the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex cooperates with AP-1 to drive melanoma phenotype
  switching and therapy resistance through AXL and actin remodeling (–).'
