caption: (a) Schematic presentation of the mutant effects of fem and dsx gene on size
  polyphenism. Genetic female bees reared on worker nutrition produce only small reproductive
  organs. Genetic females with a mutant fem gene show no small size polyphenism of
  reproductive organs. Genetic females that have a mutated dsx (operating downstream
  of fem) do show size polyphenism of the intersex reproductive organ and male-like
  gonads. Thus, we conclude that the fem gene is required for the small size polyphenism.
  Crosses mark the genes that we compromised using CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations.
  (b) The role of the fem gene for caste development. The gene products of the sex
  determination pathway (Fem, DsxF, DsxM) are shown in red (female) and blue (male)
  boxes. The nutrition-mediated process is shown in pink. Arrows indicate regulatory
  relationships. CRISPR/Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated
  protein 9.
