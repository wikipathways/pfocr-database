caption: FOXO regulation by phosphorylation. Signals from various sources induce signalling
  pathways to regulate FOXO activity. Insulin signalling pathway induces Akt-mediated
  FOXO inhibition and facilitates 14-3-3 protein binding and nuclear exclusion. Subsequently,
  the cytoplasmic FOXO is ubiquitinated by SKP2 for protein degradation. This 14-3-3-bound
  FOXO can be rescued by JNK phosphorylation and PP2A dephosphorylation. Stress-activated
  p38, JNK and PERK promote FOXO transcriptional activity. In parallel, AMP sensor
  detects low intracellular energy and promotes FOXO via AMPK phosphorylation. However,
  stress-activated ERK inhibits FOXO activity by promoting MDM2-mediated polyubiquitination
