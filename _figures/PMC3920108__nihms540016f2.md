caption: 'The central nervous system (CNS) controls pituitary ACTH secretion into
  blood by synthesizing and releasing CRH and AVP. The CNS and pituitary are under
  negative-feedback control or inhibition by glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids.
  However, ACTH release is decreased in aging after stimulation with CRH, a cholinergic
  agonist, or hypertonic saline. Conversely, ACTH release is increased in aging individuals
  after serotonin-receptor 1A stimulation in women and after mineralocorticoid-receptor
  blockade in men. Upward arrows denote feedforward drive, and downward arrows feedback
  inhibition. Up and down arrows indicate increases and decreases in the pathway or
  regulatory factor with age. The asterisk signifies that maximal ACTH release is
  normal after surgery, during critical illness, during hypoglycemia, and after administration
  of metyrapone. Abbreviations: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; AVP, arginine vasopressin;
  CBG, corticosteroid binding protein; CNS, central nervous system; CRH, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone; DHEAS, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate.'
