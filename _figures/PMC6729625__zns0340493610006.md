caption: Anatomical model of the amygdala circuitry for fear conditioning. Contextual
  CS converges with footshock US in LA and/or B (dotted thin lines). Contextual CS-US
  information courses through CeA en route to downstream fear response structures
  by way of B for freezing (dotted thick line). Auditory CS comes into association
  with the US in LA (solid thin lines). Auditory CS-US information is relayed to CeA
  directly (solid thick lines), as well as to the pathway that travels through CeA
  via B. The direct pathway to CeA neurons from LA partially mediates USV responses
  regardless of CS modality.
