caption: Schematic representation of vitamin K2-7 synthesis. In glycerol dissimilation
  pathway, overexpression of enzymes glycerol kinase (GlpK) and glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GlpD) leads to conversion of glycerol (Gly) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP). Conversion of DHAP to methylglyoxal (MG) and glyceraldehyde-1-phosphate
  (G1P) is prevented by deleting mgsA and araM. DHAP is interconverted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (G3P) which is converted to pyruvate (Pyr). Pyr enters the methylerythritol pathway
  (MEP) in which the end product is heptaprenyl pyrophosphate (HepPP). Synthesis of
  HepPP is enhanced by overexpression of enzyme heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase (HepS).
  HepPP enters MK-7 pathway to form MK-7 (vitamin K2-7). AroGD146N and PyrGE156K are
  overexpressed in shikimate (SA) pathway and pyrimidine metabolism pathway respectively
  to lead the components of both the pathways towards MK-7 pathway and form MK-7 as
  the end product (Adapted from ()).
