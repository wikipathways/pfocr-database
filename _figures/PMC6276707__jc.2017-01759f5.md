caption: Proposed model of glycogen synthesis regulation by insulin in endometrial
  epithelial cells to provide nutrition to an implanted embryo. In the uterus, endometrial
  epithelial cells accumulate glycogen over several days during the implantation window
  and secrete carbohydrate into the uterine lumen. After successful implantation,
  endometrial epithelium sustains glycogen synthesis for weeks during embryonic development.
  Maternal insulin promotes glycogen synthesis by binding to the insulin receptor
  on endometrial epithelial cells, initiating signaling through insulin receptor substrate
  1 (IRS-1) and AKT. AKT inactivates GSK3α/β by phosphorylation (P) at serines 9 and
  21. When GSK3α/β no longer phosphorylates GS at serine 641, unphosphorylated GS
  is free to catalyze α (1 → 4) glycosidic bonds in a growing chain of glycogen. Thus,
  insulin indirectly activates GS by inhibiting GSK3α/β in a classical canonical pathway.
  In addition, insulin increases total protein levels of GS through increases in GYS2
  mRNA, which enables sustained glycogen synthesis over weeks, independent of meal-time
  nutrient and hormonal fluctuations. PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
