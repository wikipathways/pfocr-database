caption: SDG2 is involved in SWR1-ER signaling pathway in regulating inflorescence
  architectureA diagram showing that SDG2 is involved in SWR1-ER signaling pathway
  in regulating inflorescence architecture by activating the auxin signaling pathways.
  Red arrows indicate the activation relationships revealed by this study. Solid lines
  indicate direct binding, and dashed lines indicate indirect relationships.
