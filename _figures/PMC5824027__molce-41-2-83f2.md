caption: The Hippo pathway regulates YAP/TAZ activation in cancer cells through a
  wide range of upstream stimuli, such as extracellular ligands, mechanotransduction,
  environmental stress, energy stress, and cell-cell contact. Aberrant activation
  of YAP/TAZ via dysregulation of the Hippo pathway results in tumorigenesis and confers
  cancer stem cell traits that lead to anoikis resistance, EMT, drug resistance, and
  metastasis.
