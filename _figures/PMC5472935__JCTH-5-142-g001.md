caption: 'Circulating concentrations of ammonia (NH3) are shown with multiorgan involvement
  in the production of NH3, ultimately resulting in NH3 crossing the blood–brain barrier,
  contributing to astrocyte swelling and hepatic encephalopathy, as decreased urea
  cycle capability and reduced liver glutamine synthetase activity is present in cirrhosis.
  The alternative pathway is also shown at the top, where NH3 binds with glutamate
  (GLU) forming glutamine (GLN) after enzymatic processing using glutamine synthetase
  (GS). Both ornithine phenylacetate (OP) and glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) are ammonia-lowering
  medications; they combine GLN and phenylacetate (PAA) to form phenylacetylglutamine
  (PAGN), which is excreted in the urine. AST-120 is a carbon microsphere adsorbent
  that binds NH3 in the gut, thus lowering circulating ammonia levels. Polyethylene
  glycol (PEG) is a cathartic, which causes rapid clearance of gut bacterial synthesizing
  ammonia to be excreted into the feces. About one-quarter of urea-derived byproducts
  from the urea cycle is shunted to the colon (not shown; remaining three-fourths
  of urea excreted in the kidneys), where urease-producing bacterial organisms produce
  ammonia that enters the portal circulation. Skeletal muscle also contributes to
  the regulation of NH3 as depicted. Not shown in the figure is the presence of GS
  and glutaminase in each organ, contributing to NH3 homeostasis. Adapted from publication
  by Thieme publications.Abbreviation: PBA, Phenylbutyric acid.'
