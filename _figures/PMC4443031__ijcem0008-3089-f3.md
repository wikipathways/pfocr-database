caption: Essential factors for IBD pathogenesis involves Rho signal pathway. Disruptions
  of the intestinal barrier result in luminal content exposure to mucosal immune cells
  and activate abnormal immune response, which cause pro-inflammatory cytokines increase.
  Simultaneously, it can damage the structure of TJ via Rho signal pathway that induced
  chronic inflammation.
