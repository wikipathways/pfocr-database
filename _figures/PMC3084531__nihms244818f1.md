caption: Glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (G3P) into 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). GAPDH can undergo different posttranslational
  modifications, which may determine some of its non-glycolytic functions. Under conditions
  of cellular oxidative stress, GAPDH can undergo reversible S-thiolation (-SSG),
  a mechanism to protect the glycolytic enzyme from irreversible oxidative inactivation
  and consequently redirecting the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate
  pathway to maintain an optimal NADPH/NADP+ ratio. GAPDH contributes to local NADH+
  and may regulate IP3R-mediated Ca2+signaling. Nitric oxide stress also leads to
  reversible S-nitrosylation (−SNO) of cystine-150 of GAPDH that facilitates its binding
  to Siah, and results in translocation of the complex to the nucleus and irreversible
  sulphonation (−SO3H) of GAPDH. This cascade mediates cell death/dysfunction in a
  gain-of-toxic manner. S- Nitrosylation of GOSPEL augments binding of GOSPEL with
  GAPDH, competing with binding of GAPDH with Siah, which is a cytoprotective mechanism
  against GAPDH-Siah cascade. Exposure to oxidants can induce an irreversible oxidation
  of cysteine residues that favor intermolecular disulfide bonds and the subsequent
  formation of cytosolic aggregates of GAPDH. This insoluble protein may ultimately
  promote cellular dysfunction and cell death.
