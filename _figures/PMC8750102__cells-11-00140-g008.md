caption: 'Glutathione metabolism is involved in drug resistance in cancer cells. Glutathione
  enters the cytosol via plasma membrane glutathione transporters such as SLC13A3
  or is synthesized through the glutathione biosynthesis pathway. Glutamine-derived
  glutamate is the major source of glutathione biosynthesis. Most cysteine is taken
  up by the circulation, and in its oxidized dimer form, cystine is taken up via SLC7A11.
  Additionally, cysteine can be synthesized from serine and methionine via the transsulfuration
  pathway. Reduced glutathione can convert hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxide to
  water and alcohol, respectively, protecting cells from oxidative damage. OXPHOS:
  oxidative phosphorylation; ROS: reactive oxygen species; GS: glutathione synthetase;
  GCL: glutamate–cysteine ligase; GPX: glutathione peroxidases; GR: glutathione reductase;
  GGT: gamma-glutamyl transferases; LOOH: lipid hydroperoxide; LOH: lipid alcohol;
  γ-Glu-Cys: gamma-glutamylcysteine.'
