caption: A) Seedling grown in uniform light (left) or under unilateral light (right).
  B) Schematic representation of a longitudinal section of hypocotyl showing putative
  auxin maximum (in green) and PIN3 localization (in pink) when seedling are grown
  in uniform light conditions or in darkness (left) and when they encounter unidirectional
  light (right). Arrows in dark blue represent PIN1- and ABCB19-mediated rootward
  auxin flow and the arrow in pink show PIN3-mediated lateralization of auxin flow
  toward the shaded side of then hypocotyl. C) Schematic representation of PIN3 trafficking
  in endodermis (illuminated side of the hypocotyl). Phot1 inhibits PID activity by
  unknown mechanisms, which limits PIN3 phosphorylation by PID and favours its routing
  by the GNOM-dependent pathway to the inner lateral pole of the cells. Phot1 also
  directly phosphorylates ABCB19, which inhibits its efflux activity and limits the
  downward auxin flow. ABCB19 inhibition and PIN3 lateralization stimulates auxin
  trafficking toward the shaded side of the hypocotyl, which promotes cell elongation
  and hypocotyl bending toward the light source. Note that phot1 action on ABCB19
  and PIN3 trafficking has been represented in the same cell for convenience, but
  it is not known whether these events happen in the same place of the hypocotyl.
  Dashed arrows represent direct phosphorylation events; arrows with chevron-shaped
  arrowhead represent trafficking pathways and blunt-ended line represents inhibition.
