caption: Involvement of ER stress signaling pathways in CP-induced cardiotoxicity
  and the regulatory role of statins via modulation of ER-Chaperone GRP78 and Calpain-1
  Pathways.CP activation of ER stress initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR)
  by triggering the master chaperone protein ER-resident, 78 kDa glucose-regulated
  protein (GRP78). GRP78 interacts preferentially with hydrophobic patches on misfolded
  ER-resident proteins, releasing the UPR 's three signaling pathways. In addition,
  CP-induced ER stress activates Ca+2–dependent-calpain-1 pathway which further induces
  caspase-12 and activated caspase-3 (ACASP3) apoptotic mechanism. Statins disrupt
  ER stress-mediated apoptotic cell death through regulation of GRP78, calpain-1 and
  ACASP3 in CP-induced cardiotoxicity.
