caption: Role of innate immunity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progression.
  DAMPs and PAMPs bind to PRRs like TLRs and NLRs resulting in NAFLD progression.
  Binding of DAMPs and PAMPs to TLR4 and TLR9 receptors results in activation of MyD88
  or TRIF signaling pathways, which activate NF-κβ and JNK signaling and induce production
  of cytokines like IL-1β and TNFα leading to lipid accumulation, cell injury and
  death in the liver. It has been demonstrated that binding of DAMPs and PAMPs to
  TLR2 can result in NAFLD/NASH through an undefined pathway. Binding of DAMPs and
  PAMPs to NLRs results in activation of NLRP3/ASC/Caspase1 through assembly of inflammasome
  complex, which induces production of cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 leading to hepatic
  inflammation and cell death.
