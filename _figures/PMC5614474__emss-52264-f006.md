caption: 'Endocytic circuitries in asymmetric cell division. A: ACDs in the Drosophila
  SOP lineage. The SOP lineage is shown. All divisions are asymmetric and entail directional
  (DELTA to NOTCH) signaling between daughter cells (depicted by red arrows). The
  first division (from SOP to pIIa and pIIb) is shown in detail. The plane of division
  with orientations is indicated. Asymmetrically partitioned molecular machinery (NUMB,
  AP-2, and SARA endosomes) is also shown. B: endocytosis regulates the creation of
  asymmetry in pIIa and pIIb cells. a: NOTCH is nonfunctional in pIIb cells, because
  it is internalized/degraded or because SANPODO is internalized. While the internalization
  of SANPODO is established, it is not clear whether NOTCH is actually preferentially/internalized
  degraded in the pIIb cell (indicated by a “?”). However, recent evidence in mammals
  indicates that NUMB might be an inhibitor of NOTCH recycling, rather than a positive
  modulator of internalization. Thus, in the pIIb cell, the function of NUMB may be
  to prevent NOTCH recycling to the PM, so favoring its degradation. b: DELTA-related
  events in pIIb. The E3 ligase Neuralized is asymmetrically partitioned in pIIb,
  allowing endocytosis of DELTA. DELTA is trafficked by epsin to a RAB11/SEC15-positive
  endosome (this event might be preceded by a first pass onto the PM to ”activate“
  DELTA, see ). These endosomes are then directed, for cargo release, along a branched
  ARP2/3-dependent actin network to a microvillar-dense region of the apical membrane
  of the pIIb. This region has been shown to contract extensive interactions with
  a similar region of the pIIa cell. c: DELTA-related events in pIIa. DELTA is also
  internalized in the pIIa cell through a Neuralized and UB-independent mechanism.
  In this cell, however, the recycling to the PM is blocked and DELTA is destined
  to degradation, because the RAB11-positive endosomal compartment cannot form, possibly
  because a critical RAB11 partner (Nuclear fallout/Arfophilin 1) is inactivated by
  as yet unclear mechanisms. DELTA might also be internalized before mitosis of the
  SOP cell; in pIIb, it could be recycled to the PM, whereas in pIIa it might be destined
  to a degradative pathway. d: Asymmetric partitioning of SARA-endosomes. In the SOP
  cell, both NOTCH and DELTA are trafficked to SARA endosomes before ACD. These endosomes
  are then directionally transported to the nascent pIIa cell, thereby contributing
  to asymmetry. The described events are not necessarily ”all or none“ situations.
  They might occur in both cells, with a cell-specific bias in favor of one of them
  that is further amplified through reinforcement/extinction events that lead from
  a quasi-symmetric situation to the final DELTA/NOTCH asymmetry needed for directional
  signaling (e).'
