caption: 'IL-17 and IL-17 receptor family. The IL-17 cytokine family consists of six
  members (IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E and IL-17F), whereas the IL-17R
  family consists of five members (IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE).
  IL-17 cytokines form disulfide-linked homodimers, whereas IL-17A and IL-17F can
  form heterodimers. Functional receptors for IL-17 family cytokines are thought to
  consist of homodimers or heterodimers. Upon stimulation, ACT1 is recruited to IL-17RA,
  IL-17RB and/or IL-17RC (and probably IL-17RE) by homotypic dimerization of two SEFIR
  domains, and activates the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
  kinase and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) signaling pathways. In this pathway,
  mutations in four genes (IL17F, IL17RA, IL-17RC and TRAF3IP2/ACT1) have been identified
  in patients with CMCD. These mutations are directly related to IL-17A/F-induced,
  IL-17RA/RC-mediated signaling, and mutations in IL17RA and TRAF3IP2 also affect
  IL-17E-induced, IL-17RA/IL-17RB-mediated signaling. Thus, effective host mucocutaneous
  immunity against Candida in humans is critically dependent on functional and effective
  IL-17A/F-induced, IL-17RA/C-mediated signaling. Magenta: CMCD-related molecules.'
