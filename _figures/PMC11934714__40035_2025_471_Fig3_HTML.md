caption: a The relationship among retrotransposition activation-associated hallmarks
  of aging. In the nervous system, some of the hallmarks of aging are associated with
  the activation of the retrotransposons. Genomic instability and epigenetic alterations
  are mutually reinforcing, and loss of proteostasis and disabled macroautophagy can
  also contribute to epigenetic alterations [104]. Epigenetic alterations cause the
  activation of retrotransposons, leading to cellular senescence and stem cell exhaustion,
  resulting in increased apoptosis and reduced cellular replenishment, ultimately
  leading to aging [104]. Additionally, any of the above hallmarks can cause chronic
  inflammation, which also contributes to aging [104]. b The link between retrotransposon
  activation and neural senescence. Neural senescence leads to the disorganization
  of heterochromatin and subsequent activation of retrotransposons (L1, HERV) [106,
  108, 113, 114]. The activated L1 or HERV forms single- or double-stranded DNA by
  reverse transcription, which triggers an innate immune response through the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway, leading to neuroinflammation and senescence [106, 114]. A senescent
  neuron can affect adjacent neurons through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP), leading to further neuronal senescence. Impaired DNA repair in senescent
  neurons increases DNA damage, leading to SIRT6 displacing heterochromatin to bind
  at damage sites, exacerbating L1 derepression [88, 105, 107]. Activated L1 integrates
  into the genome, increasing DNA damage and activating immune pathways. In MERV,
  senescence is marked by the loss of lamin B1/2, causing chromatin instability and
  MERV activation, further releasing double-stranded DNA, which triggers the cGAS-STING
  pathway and ultimately aggravate cellular senescence [106]
