caption: Pre-existing chromatin features and damage-induced histone modifications
  regulate the DNA repair pathways. The set of changes of HPTMs coordinately orchestrates
  the DDR around the damaged site, reorganizing chromatin structure in order to limit
  local transcription and to promote the DNA repair through the recruitment, the action
  and the retention of sensors, transducers and effectors of damage signaling cascade.
  In particular, methylation dynamics at different lysine residues, preferentially
  on H3 and H4 histone tails, regulate the response to DNA damage both temporally
  and spatially. Indeed, several histone methylation changes occur on H3K4, H3K9,
  H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, H4K16, H4K20, and H2AXK134 to aid in DNA damage repair. Lysine
  methylation is a highly dynamic histone modification owing to the interplay between
  KMTs (Lysine methyltransferases) and KDMs (Lysine demethylases). After the induction
  of genotoxic damage by ionizing radiation (IR), several KMTs and KDMs promote the
  formation of a chromatin landscape prone to DNA repair, acting in synergy or antagonistically
  to favor the HR and/or NHEJ pathway. Indeed, some demethylases and methyltransferases
  act at DSB sites, thus directly regulating the recruitment of DDR factors; the demethylase/methyltransferase
  activity of these epigenetic modifiers modulates the DDR not only through a direct
  role (non-dashed lines), but also indirectly (dashed lines) by regulating the expression
  of such DSB repair factors, acting at their promoter regions. The recruitment of
  some of these enzymes, including KDM5B, is specific and requires the presence of
  histone variant macroH2A1.1 and PARylation by PARP1. In other cases, such as KMT8,
  the recruitment arises thanks to the interaction with the histone variant macroH2A1.2
  without PARylation; alternatively, the recruitment can take place thanks to reader
  domains which recognize specific histone marks (see also ). Created using BioRender.
