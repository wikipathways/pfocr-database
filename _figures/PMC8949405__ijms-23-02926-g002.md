caption: VEGF signaling pathway is upregulated in AA PCa specimens. Using mirPath
  v.3, VEGF signaling was identified as significant signaling pathway differentially
  regulated by AA depleted/enriched miRNAs (adjusted p-value = 0.0155). Downregulated
  (green) and upregulated (red) miRNAs and mRNAs, in AA PCa vs. EA PCa, were mapped
  in VEGF signaling pathway. Two reciprocal miRNA-mRNA pairings, PIK3CB/miR-34a-5p
  (up/down) and MAPKAPK2/miR-96-5p (down/up), were highlighted. Other unpaired downregulated
  and upregulated miRNAs (miR-125b-2-3p, miR-99b-5p and upregulated miR-130b-3p) were
  indicated next to their predicted target genes. The genes highlighted with yellow
  are genes targeted by one AA-depleted/enriched miRNA. The genes highlighted with
  orange are genes targeted by at least two AA-depleted/enriched miRNAs. The genes
  highlighted with light green are genes not targeted by any AA-depleted/enriched
  miRNA.
