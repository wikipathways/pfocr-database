caption: 'Hypothetical role of favorable IL28B and IFNL4 genotypes in the response
  to IFN therapy.Notes: (A) When the innate immune system, including the RIG-I–IFIH1
  pathway, detects the presence of HCV RNA, the adaptor protein MAVS stimulates expression
  and secretion of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ. In individuals with the favorable IFNL4
  genotype, the TT allele creates a frame shift in the gene which inactivates protein
  expression. In individuals with the favorable IL28B genotype (rs12979860 CC), HCV
  RNA seems to induce only weak expression of IFN-λ3. (B) IFN-α and IFN-β are recognized
  by IFNAR, whereas IFN-λ binds to the IL10R-IFNλR receptor complex. Both receptors
  trigger the JAK-STAT pathway, which induces translocation of an ISGF complex to
  the nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-stimulated response elements of multiple
  ISGs. In individuals with the rs12979860 CC genotype, low levels of IFN-λ and therefore
  weak ISG expression are observed. Despite the fact that this response might be enough
  to clear the virus at low viral loads, high viral loads can accumulate in the patient.
  (C) During treatment with IFN-α, the cell is more sensitive to IFN. (D) Therefore,
  IFN signal transduction is unrestrained and a strong ISG stimulation is detected.
  Consequently, a more vigorous therapeutic response is developed and the virus can
  be successfully eliminated. Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd:
