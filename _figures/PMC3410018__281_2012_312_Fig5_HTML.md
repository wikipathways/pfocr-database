caption: Immune cell types implied to be involved in celiac disease by pathway analyses.
  Gluten molecules, the environmental trigger of CD, are degraded into gliadins which
  in turn are modified by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) into deamidated gliadin (da-Gliadin).
  The latter peptides are presented to the immune system, resulting in activation
  of various immune cell types (according to pathway analyses, see text). For a more
  detailed description of the genes involved in these processes, see the text and
  reviews by Trynka et al. [] and Abadie et al. []. Abs, antibodies; FASLG, FAS ligand;
  ICOSLG, ICOS ligand; IEL, intra-epithelial lymphocytes
