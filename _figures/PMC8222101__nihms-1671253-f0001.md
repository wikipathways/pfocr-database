caption: Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer. (a) Domain
  structure of the AR protein, which contains a N-terminal domain (NTD), a DNA-binding
  domain (DBD), and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). The hinge region links the DBD
  with the LBD. (b) Androgen and AR signaling pathway in prostate cancer. Testosterone
  and adrenal androgens are converted to dihydrotesterone (DHT) by the 5α-reductase
  and 5α-dione pathways, respectively. DHT binds to AR and induces the dissociation
  of AR from heat shock protein (HSP). AR dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus,
  where it recognizes and binds to the androgen-response elements (AREs) of target
  promoters. AR target genes are involved in diverse biological processes, including
  cell growth, survival, and the inhibition of apoptosis. ↑, upregulation; ↓, downregulation.
