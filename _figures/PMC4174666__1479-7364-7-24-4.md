caption: Generation of a biological network of genes related to the upstream regulator
  IRF2. Network was generated by IPA. Connections were applied based on known interactions
  within the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base. Solid lines between genes represent
  direct interactions and the dashed lines indirect. Genes are represented by nodes,
  with the red and green colours indicating up- or down-regulated expression; the
  greater the colour intensity, the higher the level of differential expression.
