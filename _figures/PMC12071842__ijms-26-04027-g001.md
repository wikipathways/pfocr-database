caption: A current overview of the proposed pathogenic mechanism of diabetes-related
  liver fibrosis through the dysregulation of immune responses and activation of hepatic
  stellate cells. Diabetes promotes liver fibrosis through pathways including advanced
  glycation end products (AGEs)-induced oxidative stress, which, for example, affects
  hepatocytes in liver lobules. This stress triggers the release of cytokines and
  chemokines, leading to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the recruitment
  of both specific and non-specific immune cells [6]. Immune responses regulate activated
  HSCs, the latter of which differentiate into collagen-producing myofibroblasts,
  resulting in collagen accumulation and fibrosis progression. Additionally, activated
  HSCs release cytokines that further stimulate immune cell activation, creating a
  reinforcing feed-forward loop that sustains HSC activation and amplifies the fibrotic
  response [6]. Color-coded arrows represent interactions between cytokines and chemokines
  (blue), immune cells (red), activated HSCs (purple), and activated myofibroblasts
  (green). Created with BioRender.com
