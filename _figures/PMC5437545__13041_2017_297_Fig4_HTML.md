caption: KA receptors contributes to the regulation of synaptic transmission and presynaptic
  LTP in cingulate cortex. At excitatory synapses in the ACC (left side, lower panel),
  glutamate mediates excitatory transmission, and postsynaptic KA receptors (GluK1
  and 2) mediate some of postsynaptic response in addition to AMPA receptors. GluK1
  containing KA receptors also locate at presynaptic terminals, and its activation
  contributes to presynaptic form of LTP. The presynaptic Ca2+ influx via GluK1 KARs
  leads to activation of the AC1-PKA pathway, which then results in modulation of
  HCN channels resulting in a long-lasting increase in glutamate release. At inhibitory
  synapses in the ACC (left side, top panel), presynaptic GluK1 KA receptors also
  regulate the release of GABA in a biphasic manner. The exact signaling mechanism
  remains to be investigated though
