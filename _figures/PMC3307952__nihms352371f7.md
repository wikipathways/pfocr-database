caption: At early stage of dissemination process, osteoblastic PCa activate BMP production
  by HPCs that induce osteoblastic differentiation from mixed bone marrow stromal
  cells. At the same time, osteolytic PCa activate HSCs to direct the differentiation
  of osteoclasts through IL-6 pathway. Although further study to exclude the paracrine
  effects or the effects from DTCs will be needed, the activation of HSCs/HPCs by
  PCa may be a molecular mechanism for the PCa bone phenotype.
