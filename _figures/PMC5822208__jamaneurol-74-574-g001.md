caption: 'Output of the ipRGCs to the olivary pretectal nuclei in the midbrain and
  the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus in 2 pathways. In the first
  pathway, the blue lines represent those retinal projections that target midbrain
  circuitry involved in the production of the pupillary light reflexes. In the second
  pathway, the green path represents the projection from the retina to the SCN in
  the hypothalamus. On retinal activation, the SCN tonically inhibits the paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Without the SCN-mediated inhibitory inputs to
  the PVN, the tonic activation pathway would result in the synthesis and release
  of pineal melatonin. ipRGCs send inputs into the midbrain pretectal nuclei, followed
  by innervation of the parasympathetic circuits within the Edinger-Westphal complex
  of the nuclear apparatus of cranial nerve III. From here, long preganglionic pupillary
  light reflex–mediating fibers travel superficially in the oculomotor nerve in a
  dorsomedial distribution until innervating the ciliary ganglion. Final projections
  are then transmitted as the short ciliary nerves to the sphincter muscle of the
  iris, thereby producing miosis of the pupils. In the second path in healthy participants,
  the ipRGCs send inputs to the SCN followed by inhibitory projections from the SCN
  to the PVN; in this way, light suppresses melatonin secretion. This complex circuitry
  illustrates the effects of light vs dark phases of the wake-sleep cycle transitions,
  which are coordinated by retinohypothalamic network physiology. Generally, the descending
  pathway (and then ascending following the exit of the postganglionic fibers from
  the lateral spinal cord into the superior cervical ganglion) from the PVN to the
  pineal gland results in the tonic response characteristics that promote melatonin
  release. However, during sunlight hours and in healthy individuals, the activation
  of the retinohypothalamic tract results in activation of the SCN, which then acts
  to inhibit the PVN and the end product of its stimulation pathway: melatonin. Alternately,
  and following its withdrawal of inhibitory innervation from the SCN, the PVN cell
  clusters are now disinhibited, and engage this highly discrete and crucially important
  neuroendocrine axis—the pineal-derived melatonin release apparatus—one that figures
  prominently in the delicate balance between sleep and waking. In multiple sclerosis
  (MS), over the span of the disease course, nearly 100% of the patients (if we combine
  both evident as well as occult mechanisms of tissue injury) will have sustained
  damage to the retinal architecture with corresponding ramifications on visual system
  processes, such as light and object formation in the central nervous system, the
  coordination of the pupillary light reflexes and the important mechanisms where
  light processed in the retina can influence a constellation of the body’s homeostatic
  milieu (eg, sleep-wake, neuroendocrine, energy and mood states, thermoregulation,
  eating and satiety, maintenance of glycemic control, and sexual behavior).'
