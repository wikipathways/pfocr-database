caption: Xylose is oxidized to xylonolactone by the xylose dehydrogenase (encoded
  by CcxylB). Xylonolactone is hydrolyzed to xylonate by the xylonolactonase (encoded
  by xylC). Xylonate dehydratase (encoded by yjhG) catalyzes the dehydration of xylonate
  to produce 3-deoxy-pentulosonate. Then 3-deoxy-pentulosonate is decarboxylated by
  2-keto acid decarboxylase (encoded by mdlC) to form 3,4-dihydroxybutyraldehyde.
  At last, 3,4-dihydroxybutyraldehyde is reduced by the aldehyde reductase (encoded
  by adhP) to generate BT. Xylose isomerase (encoded by xylA) and xylulose kinase
  (encoded by EcxylB) responsible for xylose metabolism are knocked out to block the
  branched pathways.
