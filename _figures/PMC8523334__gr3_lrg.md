caption: Signaling cascade of TNFR2. Activation of mTNF and TNFR2 triggers TRAF-cIAP
  complexes that initiate both NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. NF-κB pathway activates
  IL-2 proliferation and reciprocal PI3K/Akt that inhibit Th17 differentiation and
  increased the phosphorylation of STAT5. The release of IL-10 and TGF-β along with
  IL-2 are associated with cell survival and proliferation as well as its function.
  Since TNFR2 is preferentially expressed on Tregs compared to other cells, activities
  from this signaling are prominently exhibit on this cell. Created with BioRender.com.
