caption: The JA signaling pathway is activated by AAAP (A. alternata apple pathotype)
  infection, resulting in increased expression levels of MdWRKY75e, which in turn
  modulates MdLAC7 by binding to W-box elements in its promoter. Upregulation of the
  MdWRKY75e–MdLAC7 interaction boosts laccase and lignin synthesis to strengthen mechanical
  defense capabilities, allowing AAAP infection-associated damage to be mitigated
  by sustaining ROS equilibrium and PR gene regulation
