caption: 1. Mesenchymal cells located in close proximity to c-Met- and matriptase-expressing
  basal keratinocytes with high tumorigenic potential secrete single-chain proHGF/SF
  into the pericellular microenvironment. 2. ProHGF/SF binds c-Met with high affinity
  on the keratinocyte cell surface. 3. Matriptase cleaves and converts single-chain
  proHGF/SF to signaling-competent two-chain HGF/SF. 4. Matriptase-cleaved two-chain
  HGF/SF undergoes a conformational change that enables c-Met activation by autophosphorylation.
  5. Activation of c-Met leads to recruitment of Gab1 and other effectors of c-Met
  signaling. 6. Gab1 recruitment initiates a pro-tumorgenic PI3K-Akt-mTor signaling
  pathway. 7. Activation of additional unidentified signaling pathway(s) located downstream
  from c-Met (hatched arrows) induces constitutive keratinocyte proliferation. Matriptase-induced
  mTor activation and mitogenic signaling, in combination with other epigenetic and
  genetic changes (ras-dependent and ras-independent), causes malignant transformation.
  The model is synthesized on the basis of data obtained in (7), and the current study.
