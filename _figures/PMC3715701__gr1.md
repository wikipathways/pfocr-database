caption: 'Myosin 1c in cellular signaling pathways. This figure provides an overview
  of the cellular signaling pathways involving myosin 1c function. In particular,
  myosin 1c has been shown to play a role in (1) the integrin-mediated signaling pathways
  underlying cell migration, (2) the signaling events facilitating pathogen uptake
  by macropinocytosis, (3) the Neph1 translocation and signaling mediating podocyte
  foot formation, (4) the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced insulin resistance
  pathways, (5) insulin-stimulated GLUT4 transport to the plasma membrane, and (6)
  mechanical signal transduction in the hair cells of the inner ear. The molecular
  role of myosin 1c in each pathway is outlined and additional key signaling players
  are displayed for reference. This presentation of the diverse assembly of signaling
  pathways involving myosin 1c function highlights the importance of this motor in
  cellular signaling. Abbreviations: FAK (focal adhesion kinase), PAK1 (p21-activated
  kinase 1), CtBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1), Nck (non-catalytic region of tyrosine
  kinase adaptor protein 1), Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), IKK (IκB
  kinase), IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), CaMKII (Ca2 +/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II), Ca2 + (Calcium), ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate).'
