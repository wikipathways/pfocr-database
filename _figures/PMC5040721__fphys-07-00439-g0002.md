caption: 'Possible adverse effects of obesity on osteoblasts. (a) Anabolic pathways:
  Binding of BMP with BMPR induces SMAD dependent and SMAD independent pathways and
  ultimately transcribes the genes required for osteoblast formation. In the case
  of SMAD dependent signaling, activation of SMAD1/5/8 recruits SMAD4 to form a SMADs
  complex, which in turn transcribes particular gene/genes. SMAD 1/5/8 also activates
  specific genes via Osterix (Osx) mediated signaling. In case of SMAD independent
  signaling, activated BMPR induces the transcription factor runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (RUNX2) and activator protein 1 (AP1) to be activated through P38MAPK/JNK/ERK
  signaling pathway. Obesity inhibits BMP signaling by upregulating the expression
  of some BMP inhibitors like MGP, Noggin, SOST, and Gremlin. TGF-β/Activin may activate
  several receptor subtypes including ACVRIIA, ACVRIIB, ACVRIB, and ACVRIC. Like BMP
  signaling, Activin also signals through SMAD dependent and SMAD independent pathways,
  but the main difference is that Activin induces SMAD2/3 and then recruits SMAD4
  to form a SMADs complex. Obesity decreases Activin signaling via upregulating the
  expression of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a potential inhibitor of Activin signaling.
  Binding of canonical with Frizzled/Lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (FZD/LRPs)
  complex activates vessel dilator (VDL), which in turns prevents β-catenin (β-cat)
  degradation as well as subsequent translocation of β-cat into the nucleus to activate
  T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) by sequestering Glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 β (GSK3β). Binding of non-canonical Wnt with FZD triggers three different
  signaling pathways: (1) FZD recruits LRP and disheveled associated activator of
  morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1) to form a complex, which in turns activates the gene via
  RHO/ROCK/NFATC1 signaling pathway; (2) VDL forms a complex with Rac to activate
  RUNX2 via c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation; and (3) Activated FZD induces
  the activation of G protein, which in turn activates Phospholipase C (PLC) to generate
  inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
  and these Ca2+ act as negative regulators of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  γ (PPAR-γ). Obesity decreases Wnt signaling by upregulating the expression of Wnt
  inhibitors like SOST and Dickkopf Wnt Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 1 (DKK1). Upon
  activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) by I/IGF-1 transcribes the corresponding genes
  through PI3K/AKT signaling and MAPK signaling pathways. Activated protein kinase
  B (AKT) also inhibits Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) and GSK3β resulting in decreased expression
  of negative regulatory elements. Obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR) decreases
  I/IGF signaling. (b) Catabolic pathways: Decreased level of 5-HT from the brain
  suppresses bone formation by facilitating the activation of β2 adrenergic receptor
  (Adrβ2), which transcribes Cyclin D1 (CycD1) inhibitory factor through PKA/ATF4
  signaling pathway. Adrβ2 also upregulates the expression of receptor activator of
  nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL) through an unknown pathway. Obesity is inversely
  related to brain 5-HT2CR expression. PTH signaling has both positive and negative
  impacts on osteoblast development. Activated parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R)
  induces the activation of G protein, which in turn activates positive regulatory
  elements via cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway although cAMP response element binding
  protein (CREB) requires the recruitment of FOXO1 to be activated. PTH1R also inhibits
  Activin/TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the Activin receptor (ACVR). Obesity causes
  the elevation of PTH via decreasing vitamin D synthesis. Duodenal 5-HT decreases
  PTH signaling by inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) as well as preventing the recruitment
  of FOXO1 with CREB resulting in decreased osteoblastogenesis. Obesity upregulates
  duodenal 5-HT expression. GC binds with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to form
  the GC-GR activation complex, which induces osteoblast apoptosis through GSK3β/P38signaling,
  generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
  and via activation of caspase 3/9 (Csp3/9). In addition, GSK3β inhibits β-cat activity
  and ROS inhibits Nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2), a positive regulator of osteoblast.
  Sometimes GC activates the positive regulatory elements too. Excess GC uptake is
  associated with obesity. IL-6 induced JAK/STAT3 signaling has both positive and
  negative effects on osteoblast. In addition, IL-6 exerts its negative role via SHP2/PI3K/AKT
  signaling and via SHP2/MEK2/ERK signaling pathways. Obesity induces IL-6 upregulation
  through increased generation of Ang II, AGE and leptin. TNF-α activated TNF receptor
  (TNFR) activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which has both negative and positive
  roles in osteoblastogenesis. Obesity is responsible for increased synthesis of TNF-α.'
