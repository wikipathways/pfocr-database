caption: 'Muscarinic activation with ACh and the IP3signaling pathway in beta cells
  and acinar cells. (a) Acinar and beta cells express muscarinic receptors (MXRs),
  activation of which results in IP3 and DAG production. IP3 specifically binds to
  IP3R on the ER and triggers Ca2+ mobilization, leading to an oscillatory rise in
  [Ca2+]c. Additionally, RYR receptors can be activated. L-type VDCCs play a role
  in Ca2+ refilling of the ER. (b) Color-coded time courses for beta (light brown)
  and acinar cells (blue) simultaneously stimulated with 8 mM glucose in combination
  with a physiological (50 nM, top traces) or a supraphysiological (25 µM, bottom
  traces) ACh concentration. The activation onsets after the cells were stimulated
  for the acinar cells (red) and the beta cells (green) are indicated with the vertical
  dashed lines. Legend: MxR = muscarinic receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, DAG = diacylglycerol,
  IP3 = 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, IP3R = inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate receptor,
  RYR = ryanodine receptors. Created with [].'
