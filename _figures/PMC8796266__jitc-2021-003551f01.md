caption: Simplified (A) JAK–STAT pathway, (B) MNK1/2-eIF4E pathway, and BTK signaling
  in (C) myeloid cells and in (D) B cells. (A) Inflammatory cytokines implicated in
  irAEs such IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and interferon signal via JAK–STAT. JAKs phosphorylate
  tyrosine residues on their cytokine receptors, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation
  of STATs. Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they
  promote the transcription of genes encoding proteins with functions in proliferation
  and inflammation. The JAK–STAT pathway is implicated in the production of cytokines
  and chemokines involved in toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including
  IL-10, IL-17 (by regulatory T cells), CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL26. (B) MNK1/2
  are activated downstream of p38 and ERK MAPK pathways. Type I and type II interferons,
  which have been implicated in checkpoint inhibitor adverse events, can also activate
  MNK1/2. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling leads to hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP; eIF4E is
  released and binds to eIF4G. MNK1/2 bind to eIF4G and phosphorylate eIF4E on serine
  209. This increases translation of a subset of mRNAs that promote proliferation,
  invasion/metastasis, immune escape, and inflammation, including production of cytokines
  involved in irAEs such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17. (C) In myeloid cells, binding
  of immune complexes activates FcγRIII signaling. (D) In B cells, antigen binding
  activates BCR signaling. Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases phosphorylate BTK, which in
  turn activates PLCγ leading to generation of DAG and IP3. DAG subsequently activates
  protein kinase C and causes translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus.
  Of the cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of irAEs, BTK is involved in the
  production of IL-1β and IL-10 by both macrophages and B cells; IL-6, CXCL9, and
  CXCL13 by macrophages; IL-17 by B cells; and IL-2 by mast cells. BTK, Bruton’s tyrosine
  kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E;
  G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; IL, interleukin; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; irAE, immune-related
  adverse event; JAK, janus kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein.
