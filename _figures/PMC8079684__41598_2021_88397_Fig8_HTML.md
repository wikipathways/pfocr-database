  were based on Swiss-Prot and KEGG databases. Blue boxes represent upregulated genes

  figures in the boxes represent log2fold_changes between BM0.5 and BHI groups. The
  number on arrows represents the number of DEGs in KEGG database (For example: 0146

  metabolic pathways are based on KEGG database (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html).'
