caption: 'The molecular mechanisms associated with the elevation of Ca2+ signaling
  mediated by HBX. In detail, HBX promotes the elevation of cellular Ca2+ levels by
  interacting with ORAI1, which can bind to STIM1 and enhance the flow of Ca2+ into
  the cytosol. HBX increases the ER stress, which is associated with the release of
  Ca2+ from the ER. Furthermore, the viral protein enhances the outflow of Ca2+ from
  the ER through the activation of IP3R by increasing CD36, the molecules can activate
  Src pathway and induce the production of IP3 to interact with IP3R and then activate
  IP3R. In addition, the interaction of HBX and Bcl2 maybe also contribute to the
  activation of IP3R. The chimeric HBX/SERCA1 inhibits the function of SERCA to facilitate
  the flow of Ca2+ signaling into ER. The viral protein may enhance the move of Ca2+ into
  mitochondria by interacting with VDAC3, which could bind to MCU to facilitate Ca2+ inflow.
  HBX also promotes the outflow of Ca2+ from mitochondria by regulating mNCX and mPTP.
  Besides these, HBX perturbs intracellular Ca2+ outflow to outside of the cells by
  targeting Casp3, which could cleave PMCA. Ca2+ , calcium; ER: endoplasmic reticulum;
