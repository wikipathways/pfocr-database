caption: The dual effects of oxidative stress in cancer progression. ROS play an anticancer
  role by promoting apoptosis, necrosis, and ferroptosis of cancer cells and enhancing
  the immune surveillance ability of immune cells. Conversely, ROS promoting cancer
  progression by inducing DNA damage and genomic alterations, activating cell proliferation-related
  pathway (NF-B, MAPKs, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR), accelerating EMT, and altering the tumor
  microenvironment for cancer invasion and metastasis.
