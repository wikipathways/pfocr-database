caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which F1929-1458 activates anti-tumor
  immunity. F1929-1458 binds NFKB1 to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor
  cells. The activation further induces cellular stress, causing tumor cells to release
  HMGB1-gDNA complex, ATP, and OxLDL, which in turn activate the cGAS-STING and NLRP3
  inflammasome signaling pathways in DCs to produce type I IFNs and IL-1β. These cytokines
  together promote DCs maturation, activation and antigen presentation that ultimately
  enhance T cell anti-tumor immunity
