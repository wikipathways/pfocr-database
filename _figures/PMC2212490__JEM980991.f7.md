caption: Schematic presentation of the signaling leading to JNK and AP-1 activation
  in response to Ngo-epithelial cell contact. The binding of Ngo to epithelial cells
  leads to the activation of low molecular mass GTPases and sequential protein kinase
  pathways controlling AP-1 activation. PAK activates the JNK/ AP-1 pathway involving
  unknown MKKK and MKK4, but not MEKK1.
