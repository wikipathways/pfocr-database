caption: Categorization of peptide hormone families in plants, based on their structures
  and biosynthetic pathways. Peptide families in plants can be categorized into four
  distinct groups based on their functions, structures, and biosynthetic pathways.
  Peptides that undergo post-translational modification (PTM) and exhibit cysteine-richness
  (Cys-rich) are secreted via the conventional protein secretion (CPS) pathway. In
  this pathway, preprotein precursors are initially processed in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus, and finally secreted into
  the apoplast through the endomembrane system. In contrast to the CPS pathway, precursors
  derived from immunoreactive peptides (such as systemin and Pep) and small open reading
  frames (sORFs) or microRNAs are secreted via the unconventional protein secretion
  (UPS) pathway, which includes vacuoles, Exocyst-positive organelles (EXPOs), and
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Major references to classification schemes for these
  polypeptide families are presented, including aCPS and aUPS referenced from Wang
  X., 2018 (2018); bPTM and bCys-rich from Matsubayashi 2014 (2014); cImmunoreaction
  from Del Corpo D., 2024 (2024); dsORF/microRNA from Tavormina P., 2015 (2015); eCLE
