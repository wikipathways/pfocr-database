caption: Overview of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathway. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is
  regulated by Ras as well as various kinases. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is also
  activated after receptor ligation. The PTEN phosphatase (black octagon) inhibits
  activation of PI3K. Downstream of PI3K, Akt has many downstream targets that regulate
  cell growth and apoptosis. The transcription factors regulated by these pathways
  are indicated in diamond-shaped outlines. Dotted lines in front of AAA indicate
  that there is suppression of expression of some genes due to Akt phosphorylation
  of transcription factors such as Foxo3. Some of the interactions between the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are also indicated.
