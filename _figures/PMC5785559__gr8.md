caption: 'Diagram of direct and alternative Runx2-Ihh regulation in chondrogenesis.
  Black arrows present established knowledge: Runx2 is known to directly bind the
  Ihh promoter and stimulate Ihh expression in chondrocytes, and Ihh up-regulates
  the expression of Runx2 and Runx3 during chondrogenesis. Red arrows present conclusions
  determined in the current study: As an alternative pathway, Nell-1 acts as a downstream
  Runx2 mediator that induces Ihh signaling transduction via Runx3, which does not
  rely on Runx2 expression.'
