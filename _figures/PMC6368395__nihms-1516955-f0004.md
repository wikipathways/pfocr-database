caption: 'Top Left: Binding of CD95(Fas/APO-1)L to CD95(Fas/APO-1) initiates the formation
  of DISC involving pro-caspase-8 and FADD resulting in the activation of pro-caspase-8.
  Subsequent activation of other caspases promotes apoptosis. HHV-encoded vFLIP interferes
  with the activation of pro-caspase-8 at DISC and inhibits apoptosis. HHV-encoded
  vGPCR promotes Ras-PI3K-Akt survival pathway and increases the expression of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2. Right: HBV-encoded HBx and HCV-encoded NS3 and NS5A proteins activate Ras-PI3K-Akt
  survival pathway. HBx and NS5A modulate RTK EGFR-mediated signaling. HBx modulates
  the transcriptional activity of c-Myc, c-Fos and c-Jun and increases the expression
  of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and angiopoietin-1. Bottom: HPV-encoded E6 and
  E7 proteins inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis. EBV infection increases the secretion
  of IL-6 and IL-10. Together, oncogenic virus infection disrupts the apoptotic machinery
  of infected cells and also promotes angiogenesis, resulting in the malignant transformation
  of the infected cell.'
