caption: 'Three pathways of Trp metabolism in the human body. (A) Kyn pathway: Trp
  undergoes conversion to NFK via 3 rate-limiting enzymes—IDO1, IDO2, and TDO—and
  then is deacylated to Kyn by arylformamidase. Kyn can be converted to KYNA by KAT,
  AA by KYNU, or 3-HK by KMO. KAT catalyzes the conversion of 3-HK to XANA, whereas
  KYNU catalyzes it to 3-HAA and alanine, and then the former becomes QA, and the
  latter is converted to pyruvate through transamination. (B) 5-HT pathway: TpH catalyzes
  Trp into 5-HTP, which is decarboxylated to form 5-HT under AADC. 5-HT produces NAS
  by AANAT, then to melatonin by ASMT. Alternatively, 5-HT can also be catalyzed into
  5-HIAA by MAO. (C) Indole pathway: TrpD catalyzes Trp to tryptamine, further processed
  into IE, indole-3-acetate, and IAA. Skatole and IAld are identified as the metabolites
  of IAA. Tryptophanase converts Trp into IAld, IAA, IPA, and indole. Indole can be
  further metabolized into IS and indole-3-carboxylic acid. Trp converts into IPγA
  mediated by ArAT, which performs as a precursor of ILA, IAcr, and IAA. [All original
