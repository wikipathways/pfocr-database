caption: Graphical depiction of proposed PIK3CA‐induced hepatocarcinogenesis. H1047R
  and E545K mutations result in a receptor‐independent constitutive activation of
  PIK3CA. In complex with the regulatory subunit p85, the conversion of phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)‐bisphosphate (PIP2) into PIP3 is catalyzed. PIP3 activates the downstream
  effectors AKT, ERK1/2, phosphorylated SGK3, and STAT3, either directly or via the
  mediation of phosphoinositide‐dependent protein kinase 1. AKT has a pivotal role
  in the pathway by inducing antiapoptosis and cell proliferation. Cellular metabolism
  is veered toward lipid biosynthesis by increased expression of the master lipid
  regulators SCD1 and FASN. Gal‐1 upregulation acts in unison by eliciting the upregulation
  of SCD1 and could account for an accessible therapeutic target. Furthermore, the
  elevation of ZIP4 encompasses YAP activation, thereby potentially providing a bridge
  to the Hippo signaling pathway. Finally, in correlation with the macroscopic steatohepatitic
  phenotype, pro‐inflammatory proteins such as COX2 and Gal‐3 are stimulated. Cooperatively,
  these alterations induce the formation of HCC.
