caption: 'The signaling mechanism of IGF-1 upon binding to IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R).
  In the extracellular, IGF-1 interacts with IGF binding protein (IGFBP). IGF-1R is
  a homodimeric receptor, and when activated, it has cellular effects in neuroregeneration
  or neuro-repair. Upon IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R, tyrosine residues on IGF-1R are autophosphorylated,
  creating binding sites for substrates such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS).
  IRS can bind to the receptor, allowing multiple pathways to be activated. In the
  first pathway, PIK3 can bind to IRS, which can activate AKT, ultimately inhibiting
  BAD and resulting in the cell survival and other beneficial effects. In the second
  pathway, the MAPK pathway is activated starting with the activation of Ras. The
  effects of activating this pathway are similar to activation of the PIK3 pathway.
  These signaling events ultimately lead to cell survival, myelination and myelin
  protection, and neuronal development. Abbreviations: IGF-1, insulin-like growth
  factor 1; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor binding protein; IGF-1R, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PDK1, 3′-phosphoinosotide-dependent kinase-1; AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; BAD, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death; Ras,
  rat sarcoma; Raf, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase'
