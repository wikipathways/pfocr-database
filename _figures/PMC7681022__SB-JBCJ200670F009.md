caption: In deregulated MTHFR mutant cells, SAM cycles in futile salvage pathways
  wherein both methionine and adenine are continuously utilized and recycled. A schematic
  for the metabolism of SAM in budding yeast. Major catabolism of SAM to SAH occurs
  by methylation of PE to PC, or SAM may also be consumed for the production of spermidine,
  spermine, and methylthioadenosine (MTA) via polyamine synthesis, the latter then
  enters a futile methionine salvage pathway producing adenine as a side-product.
  Relative intracellular levels of the two phospholipids intermediates involved in
  PE methylation and polyamines (spermidine and spermine) estimated from yeast transformants
  of MET13_WT or MET13_R357A in met13Δmet15Δ (ABC2613) that were grown overnight in
  minimal medium with amino acid supplements and GSH. These transformants were then
  reinoculated at 0.15 A600 in fresh SD medium without any sulfur source. Methionine
  was added to the transformants after 3 h of secondary inoculation, and the samples
  were collected in triplicate at 1.0 OD. The graph here corresponds to the representative
  data set plotted using the average of three biological replicates and three technical
  replicates of each of these biological replicates along with ± S.D. values. Error
  bars indicate S.D. (n = 3). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; NS, not significant.
