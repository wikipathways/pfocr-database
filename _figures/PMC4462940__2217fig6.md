caption: Model for abscission checkpoint regulation by ATR and Chk1. DNA lesions in
  postmitotic cells (depicted schematically in one nucleus; yellow hatches) trigger
  activation of a signaling pathway via ATR. This feeds into the abscission checkpoint
  via the central regulatory node of Chk1 and the downstream kinase Aurora B to delay
  abscission. Recruitment of 53BP1 (green circles), and likely other factors that
  protect DNA lesions during genome surveillance, would eventually lead to suppression
  of this signaling path when these lesions are properly poised for repair. Although
  the molecular network is not yet defined, other signals (e.g., those triggered by
  tension forces) feed independently into the Chk1-Aurora B pathway to further control
  abscission timing.
