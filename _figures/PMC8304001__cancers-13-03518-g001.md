caption: 'New generation therapy targeting androgen biosynthesis in addition to androgen
  deprivation therapy against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: potential
  mechanisms of action on brain function using a mouse model. Note. (A) Schematic
  of enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone acetate-prednisone (AAP) as treatment options
  for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients and of their sites
  of action such as prostate tissue, adrenals and potentially the brain. Cytochrome
  p450c17A1 (CYP17A1), an ER-localized enzyme expressed in both prostate and adrenal
  glands, and potentially in the human brain, plays a critical role in the androgen
  biosynthesis pathway. In the adrenals, CYP17A1 catalyzes two critical steps through
  its 17α-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase activities. The 17α-hydroxylase activity of
  CYP17A1 converts pregnenolone to 17α-pregnenolone and progesterone to 17α-progesterone.
  The C17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1 converts 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone
  (DHEA) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione, which are subsequently converted
  to testosterone and/or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by other steroidogenic enzymes.
  After radical prostatectomy and androgen deprivation therapy, androgens can be mainly
  synthesized from cholesterol through multiple enzymatic reactions within adrenals.
  Abiraterone is a novel CYP17A1 inhibitor that acts to inhibit its 17α-hydroxylase
  and/or C17,20-lyase activities. To ensure a normal mineralocorticoid feedback loop,
  low doses of prednisone are co-administered with AA in order to suppress ACTH, thereby
  restoring normal cortisol physiology in patients. ENZ is an irreversible antagonist
  with high affinity for the AR expressed both in adrenal glands and also within the
  brain. (B) NGT Hormonal therapy potential action mechanisms on the mouse brain.

  the potential binding of ENZ on AR in the rodent adrenals but also in the brain
  or the inhibitory action of AAP on CYP17A1 expressed in adrenals and in rodent brain.
  AA may impact steroidogenesis within adrenals showing the cholesterol transformation
  into pregnenolone by Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP11A1), being
  metabolized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) into progesterone. Through
  multiple enzymatic reactions within adrenals, progesterone will be transformed in
  the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. In the upper panel, representative scheme of
  the steroidogenesis within CNS showing the cholesterol transformation into pregnenolone
  by Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP11A1) in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, being metabolized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) into progesterone.
  AAP, by blocking CYP17A1, may impair progesterone transformation into 17-OH-progesterone,
  17-OH pregnenolone and Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as transformation of
  DHEA into androstenedione by 3β-HSD, transformation of androstenedione to testosterone
  by the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) and reduction of T to DHT by 5α-reductase
  (SRD5A). ENZ treatment potentially impairs the binding of T/DHT to AR, the translocation
  of ligand-activated-AR into the nucleus and its action as a transcription factor
  when associated with the coenzyme A (CoA). Modulation of AR signaling transduction
  activated by local synthesis of T or DHT, should thus regulate neurotransmission,
  neurogenesis, and brain plasticity and selective behavioral responses as activity,
  emotion, exploration or cognitive functions. 17β-HSD, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase;
