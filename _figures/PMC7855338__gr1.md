caption: Dopaminergic signaling pathway. DARPP-32 phosphorylation can be controlled
  by synaptic release of dopamine, and phosphoprotein is involved in the regulation
  and management of dopamine-induced trans-synaptic effects, which is achieved by
  the association of D1 receptors with the activation of adenylyl cyclase [], triggering
  cAMP synthesis [, ]. Under normal conditions, DARPP-32 is phosphorylated by the
  residues Thr34 by PKA (protein kinase A []), Thr75 by CDK-5 (Cyclin-dependent kinase
  5) [,], Ser97 and Ser130 []. Dopamine activation of the D1 receptor and, accordingly,
  of this signaling pathway increases the level of P-DARPP-32-Thr34, which is a PP-1
  (protein phosphatase 1 []) inhibitor and stimulating the PKA-sensitive regulatory
  subunit protein phosphatase 2A, which, in its turn, dephosphorylates Thr75 residues.
  Dephosphorization of the Thr75 residue directly leads to inhibition of PKA. Thus,
  in the dopaminergic signaling pathway there is a cycle with positive feedback. One
  of the effects of dopamine exposure and, accordingly, activation of the signaling
  pathway through D1 receptors is a change in the properties of ion channels, for
  example, their conductivity [].
