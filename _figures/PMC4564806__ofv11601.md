caption: 'Schematic representation of β-1,2-mannosyltransferase (Bmt)1–6 activities
  on Candida albicans cell-wall glycoconjugates. (A) β-1,2-oligomannosides (β-Mans),
  expressed at the nonreducing end of α-1,2-Mans from N-mannan, are biosynthesized
  by Bmt1 and Bmt3. The Bmt2, Bmt3, and Bmt4 sequentially add β-mannose on phosphomannose
  linked to α-1,2-Mans of N-mannan. (B) Phospholipomannan β-1,2-mannosylation involves
  Bmt5 and Bmt6, which transfer β-mannose on the inositol phosphate added to mannose-inositol-phosphoceramide.
  (C) This illustrates the detailed structure and biosynthetic pathway of the 2 O-mannopentamers:
  the mannopentaose previously described (top panel) [, ] and the mannopentaose partly
  biosynthesized by Bmt1 and Bmt3 as deduced from this study (bottom panel). The arrows
  indicate where the enzymes act and which β-mannose is added.'
