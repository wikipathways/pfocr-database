caption: 'The serotype 2 CPS synthesis pathway of S. pneumoniae. (A) CPS is built
  by installing sugars sequentially on the Und-P lipid carrier in the cytoplasm. The
  lipid-linked precursor is flipped, polymerized, and transferred to the PG by a yet-to-be-identified
  ligase. Und-P is then recycled after dephosphorylation for the next round of CPS
  synthesis. (B) Graphical representation of phosphoregulatory system in S. pneumoniae.
  CpsC has a large extracellular loop that structurally resembles Wzz. It interacts
  with CpsD and recruits it to the septal region through its C-terminal domain. CpsD
  autophosphorylates at the three C-terminal tyrosine residues that presumably modulate
  CpsCD activity. CpsB (Protein Data Bank: 2wjf) is a manganese-dependent phosphatase
  that dephosphorylates CpsD∼P. The residue highlighted in red is the catalytic histidine
  (His136), which is in close proximity to the leaving phosphate group. (C) Outline
  of the Tn-seq screen. Pneumococcal genomic DNA was transposon mutagenized and transformed
  into the wild-type and ΔcpsE strains. Survivors were pooled, and the genomic DNA
  was extracted. Transposons (represented by blue boxes) were mapped by MmeI digestion,
  adapter ligation, PCR, and next-generation sequencing.'
