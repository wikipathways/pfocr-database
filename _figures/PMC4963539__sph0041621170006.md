  treatment. (B) Tetrahydrofolate pathway affected by FADDI-019 treatment. (C) Tetrahydrofolate
  biosynthesis pathway targeted by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Arrows indicate
  reactions catalyzed by known enzymes in S. aureus 700698, and red arrows indicate
  reactions catalyzed by enzymes with >2-fold increased expression.
