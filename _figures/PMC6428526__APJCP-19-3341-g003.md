caption: EMT is Modulated by Multiple Cascades Through Several Networks. TGFβ and
  p53 pathway will activate its signaling pathway through phosphorylation of canonical
  (SMADs) non-canonical (BMP/ Wnt signaling) hence regulate EMT transcription factors
  to promote EMT. EMT can also be regulated through recruitment of the epigenetic
  machineries (SETD1A/SIRT1/DNMT) by binding to miR200 promoter elements to repress
  miR200 expression and altogether depletes E-cadherin promoting irregular polarity
  of epithelial cells and transitioned to mesenchymal formation. However, feedback
  loop regulation of the epigenetic machineries occurs when miR200 is reactivated.
