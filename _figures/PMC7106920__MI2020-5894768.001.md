caption: 'Relationship between PCOS and immune cells. (1) PCOS is often associated
  with obesity and IR. (2) Obesity and IR elevate proinflammatory cytokine release,
  such as TNFα and IL-6, which lead to an increase in macrophages through the NFκB
  pathway, resulted in A upregulation, while E downregulation, and with no interference
  of P, via inhibiting aromatase activation. (3) PCOS status can decrease NK cells,
  both PBNK and uNK, through downregulation of CXCL-10, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 cytokines.
  (4) Obesity causes an increase in DCs, and PCOS status decreases DC number, both
  leading to the destruction of immune defenses. (5) The steroid hormone alterations
  of PCOS lead to a decrease in T cells and changes in subgroup proportions. IR: insulin
  resistance; PCOS: polycystic ovarian syndrome; TNFα: tumor necrosis factor-α; IL:
  interleukin; NFκB: nuclear factor κB pathway; MIF: migration inhibitor factor; DCs:
  dendritic cells; PBNK: peripheral blood NK cells; uNK: uterus NK cells; ILCs: innate
  lymphoid cells; Th: helper T cells; Treg: regulatory T cells; A: androgen; E: estrogen;
  P: progesterone.'
