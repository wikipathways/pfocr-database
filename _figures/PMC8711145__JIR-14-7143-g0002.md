caption: Mechanism of activation of canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (priming-signal
  1 and activation-signal 2). Priming process (saffron yellow background) is triggered
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as TLR4 and NOD2, or cytokine receptors,
  such as IL-1R and TNFR, and then activate NF-κB, in turn contributing to the transcription
  and translation of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Activation process (light blue
  background) is boosted by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, particulates and pore-forming toxins, which
  activate a number of upstream signaling events. These signaling events include ion
  fluxes, lysosomal leakage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, the release
  of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and trans-Golgi disintegration. In addition,
  other specific events activate the NLRP3 inflammasome as well. For instance, RNA
  virus triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome activation via mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein (MAVS). The translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
  (SREBPs)-SREBP cleavage-activating proteins (SCAP) complex (SS complex) from endoplasmic
  reticulum to Golgi also can initiate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Likewise, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  (PtdIns4P) on dispersed trans-Golgi network can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  The NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to the cleavage of caspase-1, which in turn
  cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 as well as gasdermin D (GSDMD). The N-terminal cleaved
  GSDMD embeds into the membrane, forming pores and triggering cell swelling and lysis
  called pyroptosis.
