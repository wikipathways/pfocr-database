caption: Schematic representation of the main players of innate and adaptative immunity
  in response to chronic wounds. Upon tissue injury, tissue-resident immune cells,
  including macrophages, sense tissue damage and trigger the mobilization of other
  immune cells. Damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate resident immune cells, such as mast cells, Langerhans
  cells, T cells, and macrophages, by binding pattern recognition receptors to elicit
  downstream inflammatory pathways. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), released
  by platelets and leukocytes, play an important role in initiating the chemotaxis
  of neutrophils and monocytes. Monocytes migrate into the wound and mature into macrophages.
  Neutrophils and activated macrophages secrete reactive oxygen species (ROS), antimicrobial
  peptides, proteases, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to amplify the inflammation
  and to help eliminate pathogens. However, the prolonged presence of pro-inflammatory
  macrophages (M1) in the wound environment and the overexpression of inflammatory
  mediators lead to the failure of the reparative (M2) phenotype polarization. In
  addition, adaptive immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ cells), mast cells,
  T helper (Th) cells, and B cells, were shown to participate in the process. Arrows
  indicate pathway induction and numbers indicate the corresponding healing phases
  ((1) homeostasis, (2) inflammation, (3) proliferation). NETs, neutrophil extracellular
  traps; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; ILC, innate lymphoid cells; NK, natural killer cells.
