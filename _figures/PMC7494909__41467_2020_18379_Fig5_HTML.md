caption: Xinβ negatively modulates Hippo-YAP signaling by recruiting phosphorylated
  NF2 to the sarcolemmal membrane of cardiomyocytes, leading to the reduction of total
  NF2 protein, repression of Hippo signaling, and the activation of the downstream
  mediator YAP (left panel). Loss of Xinβ results in activation of Hippo signaling
  and a reduction of functional YAP levels, which reduces expression of downstream
  targets.
