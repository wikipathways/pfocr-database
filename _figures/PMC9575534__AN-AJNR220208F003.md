caption: The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle and glutamate-glutamine cycles. After
  traveling through the endothelial cells, glucose (Glc) enters the astrocytes via
  Glc transporter 1 (GlcT1). It is metabolized to pyruvate and then lactate by lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH5). The lactate is carried outside the astrocyte and inside the
  neuron via the monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The lactate inside the neuron
  is metabolized in the oxygen pathway. Glutamate (Glu) molecules released from presynaptic
  neurons are transported into the astrocytes through Na+-dependent channels. In astrocytes,
  the Glu is transformed into Glutamine (Gln) or α-ketoglutarate to perform oxygen
  metabolism in the Krebs cycle. ATP indicates adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine
  di-phosphate; P, phosphate; GluR, glutamate receptor; OH/HCO3, hydroxide/bicarbonate;
  K+, potassium; GLT, glutamate transporter; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; ATPase,
  adenosine triphosphatase.
