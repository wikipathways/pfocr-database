caption: 'The complex relationship between alpha-synuclein and the endolysosomal system
  in Parkinson’s disease. (A) In the soma, essential functional proteins are produced
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, purple) and are post-translationally modified
  in the Golgi apparatus (Golgi, blue). The overexpression of monomeric α-syn inhibits
  this trafficking process. Proteins, like lysosomal hydrolases, are packed into vesicles
  (purple) and delivered to the trans-Golgi network (TGN, blue). From the TGN, depending
  on the post-translational modifications, the vesicles are directed towards early
  endosomes (orange) for further degradation in the lysosomes, or to the secretory
  pathway (anterograde transport from the TGN). Simultaneously, the extracellular
  vesicles are endocytosed following the canonical endosomal pathway initiated by
  the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME, red dashes)—which can be upregulated by
  monomeric α-syn and downregulated by the aggregated forms—followed by vesicle uncoating
  (inhibited by α-syn overexpression) and fusion with early endosomes (orange). These
  early endosomes, which are mildly acidic, act as a sorting station, targeting cargo
  towards multiple destinations. With the help of the endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport (ESCRT), early endosomes mature into late endosomes where luminal
  pH decreases, while sequestrating ubiquitinylated proteins into intraluminal vesicles
  forming multivesicular bodies (MVBs) before fusing with lysosomes to initiate the
  proteolytic degradation of the cargo. Glucocerebrosidase (GBA/GCase) and Cathepsin
  D are crucial for normal lysosomal function, that is negatively impacted by the
  presence of aggregated pathological forms of α-syn. The endosomal maturation pathway
  is inhibited at several steps by these two forms of α-syn. Early endosomes that
  are not sorted towards cargo degradation pathway follow the recycling pathway, and
  back to the plasma membrane (blue) where these two forms of α-syn also play an inhibitory
  role. Early endosomes may also undergo retrograde transport to the TGN through the
  retromer complex where Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35 (VPS35) takes part, which is
  negatively mediated by the presence of the aggregated forms of α-syn. Cargo in the
  phagocytic pathway, mainly composed of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles,
  is degraded through the endolysosomal pathway when double-membraned phagosomes fuse
  with late endosomes or lysosomes. The complete process is called autophagy, and
  is dissected into three pathways: Macroautophagy, microautophagy (1), and chaperone-mediated
  autophagy (2). Overexpression of α-syn is known to inhibit phagophore maturation.
  (B) At the synapse, neurotransmitters are released following the synaptic vesicle
  (SV) cycle, a key part of neuronal physiology. The synaptic exocytosis is divided
  into three sequential steps: docking (3), priming (4), and vesicle fusion (5). After
  docking, the vesicles are primed through a series of ATP-dependent reactions, and
  are then released after an action potential that triggers the calcium influx allowing
  for fusion pore opening. α-Syn plays a major role in these 3 steps depending on
  its conformation: monomeric and aggregated forms may upregulate or downregulate
  the docking of SVs, overexpressed monomeric forms downregulate the priming of SVs
  while monomeric forms upregulate the fusion. Empty SVs are further recycled through
  CME. Clathrin quickly forms a layer around invaginations and induces membrane fission
  with the help of dynamins and the monomeric forms of α-syn that play a role in membrane
  binding, inducing SV curvature formation. While on the contrary, aggregated forms
  of α-syn inhibit SVs fission. The endosomes derived from the plasma membrane also
  form SVs. Synaptic autophagy is also crucial in maintaining the health of the pre-synaptic
  terminal, which may be altered by the overexpressed monomeric forms of α-syn. In
  the axon, endosomes and autophagosomes are retrogradely transported from the synaptic
  terminals to the soma.'
