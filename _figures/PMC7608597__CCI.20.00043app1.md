caption: Evaluation and consolidation of cancer diagnosis information in the Department
  of Defense (DoD) Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and Military Health System Data Repository
  (MDR) linked databases—Military Cancer Epidemiology Data System (MilCanEpi). (†)
  Other records available for cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, or noncancer medical
  care for data source that does not contain the variable under comparison. (‡) Logical
  order determined by considering the same variable being compared between the databases
  (eg, diagnosis dates from both) or different variables being compared, either within
  the same database or between two databases; order of diagnosis and treatment variables
  compared with tumor site–specific clinical guidelines; reasonable expectations as
  a result of clinical working procedures (eg, surgery to remove tumor tissue before
  pathology for diagnosis); and reasonable time frame for diagnosis or treatment determined
  by clinical practice (eg, primary treatment within 6 months of diagnosis). (§) Both
  information and date retained from records selected via this pathway (eg, if CCR
  is the data source containing the information, then the date is also selected from
  CCR for analysis). (††) CCR data source for cancer diagnosis. See Methods for more
  detail.
