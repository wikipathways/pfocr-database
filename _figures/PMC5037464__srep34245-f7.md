caption: DY and 5-FU synergistically promoted the generation of ROS in CRC cells and
  triggered a mitochondria disruption (cytochrome c release) by boosting the ratio
  of Bax/Bcl-2, which then activated caspase-9/3 and PARP. A combination of GA, CA
  and EA exhibited comparable synergistic effects on 5-FU cytotoxicity to DY water
  extract, but the underlying mechanism needs to be explored.
