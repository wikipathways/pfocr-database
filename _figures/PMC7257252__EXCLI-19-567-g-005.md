caption: . Diagrammatic presentation of the activation of the STAT3-SOCS3 signaling
  pathway and inhibition of CXCR4/CCL5 interaction by FGF21 in HE-induced mice. The
  activation of CXCR4/CCL5 in liver damage stimulates Kupffer cells and activated
  HSCs to secrete TGFβ, IL-1, IL-6, and RANTES, subsequently leading to the stimulation
  and acceleration of persistent inflammation and fibrosis. This enhances excessive
  extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the hepatocytes. Also, myofibroblast secretes
  excess Col1 and elastin into the ECM, resulting in the formation of fibrosis. Proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines also cross the blood-brain barrier to cause neuroinflammation
  in the brain resulting in cognitive and neurological dysfunction in acute hepatic
  encephalopathy (AHE). However, FGF21 blocks the activation of CXCR4/CCL5 and associated
  pathway resulting in the rapid resolution of fibrosis and inflammation culminating
  in the restoration of cognitive and neurological dysfunction in HE. Synergistically,
  FGF21 also upregulates the expression of IL-10 thereby activating STAT3. This leads
  to the stimulation of SOCS3 to prolong the expression of anti-inflammatory response
  through the secretion of TGFβ1 and EGF. These facilitate the induction of apoptosis
  in the Kupffer cells and myofibroblast and increase autophagy of the lipid droplets
  in the damaged hepatocytes. SOCS3 inhibits IL-6 to block the JAK-STAT3 signaling
  pathway. TGFβ1 also stimulates PPARγ-mediated degradation of activated HSCs to restore
  normal hepatocytes in HE-induced mice as seen in the H&E staining of hepatocytes
  of the HE mice treated with FGF21.

  description: . Diagrammatic presentation of the activation of the STAT3-SOCS3 signaling
    pathway and inhibition of CXCR4/CCL5 interaction by FGF21 in HE-induced mice.
    The activation of CXCR4/CCL5 in liver damage stimulates Kupffer cells and activated
    HSCs to secrete TGFβ, IL-1, IL-6, and RANTES, subsequently leading to the stimulation
    and acceleration of persistent inflammation and fibrosis. This enhances excessive
    extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the hepatocytes. Also, myofibroblast
    secretes excess Col1 and elastin into the ECM, resulting in the formation of fibrosis.
    Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines also cross the blood-brain barrier to
    cause neuroinflammation in the brain resulting in cognitive and neurological dysfunction
    in acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE). However, FGF21 blocks the activation of
    CXCR4/CCL5 and associated pathway resulting in the rapid resolution of fibrosis

    These facilitate the induction of apoptosis in the Kupffer cells and myofibroblast
    and increase autophagy of the lipid droplets in the damaged hepatocytes. SOCS3
    inhibits IL-6 to block the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. TGFβ1 also stimulates
