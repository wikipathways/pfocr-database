caption: 'IFN signaling in beta-cells and autoreactive T-cells (inset) via JAK/STAT
  pathway in T1D. The binding of type I, II, or III IFNs to their respective receptors
  activates distinct JAK proteins, leading to STAT phosphorylation and, ultimately,
  the upregulation of ISGs, such as ER stress markers (CHOP, ATF3, XBP1), and CXCL10,
  which activate ER stress and inflammation in beta-cells. It also enhances beta-cell
  surface MHC-I, PD- L1, and HLA-E, enabling autoreactive CD8+ T cell recognition.
  In autoreactive T cells, IFN-y or common y-chain cytokines activate the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. This amplifies
  T cell-mediatedinflammation and may enhance T cell activation, thereby exacerbating
  autoimmune damage and contributing to the development of TID. Arrows indicate pathway
  directionality only. Black (+) symbols indicate transcriptional upregulation. ISGS:
  IFN-stimulated genes'
