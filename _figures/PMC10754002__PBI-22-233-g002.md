caption: 'Paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway summary. Enzymes selected for the study
  of gene expression appear in yellow boxes. Besides, the target genes for metabolic
  engineering experiments, BAPT and DBTNBT, are in red circles. Important itermediate
  compounds of the biosynthetic pathway are indicated by yellow circles. Enzyme abbreviations:
  BAPT, 13‐O‐(3‐amino‐3‐phenylpropanoyl)‐CoA transferase; DBAT, 10‐deacetylbaccatin
  III‐10‐O‐acetyltransferase; DBTNBT, 3′‐N‐debenzoyl‐2′‐deoxytaxol‐N‐benzoyltransferase;
  GGPPS, geranygeranyl diphosphate synthase; PAM, phenylalanine aminomutase; T10βOH,
  taxane‐10β‐hydroxylase; T13αOH, taxane‐13α‐hydroxylase; T14βOH, taxane‐14β‐hydroxylase;
  T1βΟH, taxane‐1β hydroxylase; T2′αOH, taxane 2′α‐hydroxylase; T2αOH, taxane‐2α‐hydroxylase;
  T5αOH, taxane‐5α‐hydroxylase; T7βOH, taxane‐7β‐hydroxylase; T9αΟH, taxane‐9α‐hydroxylase;
  TAT, taxane‐5α‐ol‐O‐acetyltransferase; TBT, taxane‐2α‐O‐benzoyl transferase; TXS,
  taxadiene synthase. Figure adapted from Palazon et al. (2003).'
