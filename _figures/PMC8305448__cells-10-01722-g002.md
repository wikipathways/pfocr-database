caption: 'Overview of the IAV replication cycle. The influenza virus life cycle can
  be divided into several stages: (1) Virus binding to the target cell. HA binds to
  sialic acid found on the surface of the host cell’s membrane. (2) Entry into the
  host cell: a clathrin-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis takes place. Early
  endosome containing viruses is transported by dynein along microtubules to the perinuclear
  region close to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). (3) Fusion of the virus
  envelope with the endosomal membrane. Acidification increases progressively from
  endocytic vesicles to late endosomes and induces a HA conformational change to a
  fusion-competent state. M2, an acid-activated viral ion channel, is required for
  efficient viral envelope fusion with the endosomal membrane and nucleocapsid release.
  (4) Uncoating of the virus capsid by disassembly of the M1 proteins and release
  of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) to the cytosol. (5) Entry of vRNPs into
  the nucleus by an active nuclear import pathway. (6) Transcription and replication
  of the viral genome. The IAV genome is composed of negative-sense strand RNAs. The
  genome is first converted into positive-sense RNAs, forming complementary ribonucleoprotein
  (cRNP) complexes, that serve as templates to produce viral RNAs. The transcription
  of the vRNA generates mature viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that have a 5′ methylated
  cap and a poly(A) tail. (7) Viral protein translation occurs by free ribosomes or
  ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Some of these proteins enter the nucleus
  where they assemble with viral RNAs. (8) Export of the vRNPs from the nucleus. vRNPs
  are exported out of the nucleus via the CRM1 dependent pathway through the nuclear
  pores. (9) Transport of viral components, assembly and budding at the host cell
  plasma membrane. Viral glycoproteins, HA and NA, associate with lipid rafts, membrane
  microdomains comprised of densely packed cholesterol and sphingolipids. vRNP complexes
  are transported as sub-bundles on Rab11 to recycling endosomes close to ER exit
  sites toward the plasma membrane and are incorporated as a complex of eight different
  vRNPs into budding viruses. Finally, the plasma membrane containing the viral structural
  proteins at the assembly site bends releasing infectious virus into the extracellular
  environment.'
