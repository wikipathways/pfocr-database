  was applied to the whole data set, using a significant (p < =0.05) minimum of a
  4-fold upregulation, in genes identified in astrocytes that were treated with 10
  μM Meth for 24 h, for identification of hotspots. This approach identified a (a)
  cluster of MAP2K5-first neighbor genes, a (b) cluster of GPR65-first neighbor genes,
  and a (c) cluster of ED1-first neighbor genes. Shades of red represent the level
  of upregulation of each gene, where light red is less upregulated and darker red
  is more upregulated. Genes that are connected by a green line are in the same pathway,
  whereas orange lines connect genes that are colocalized, yellow lines mean coexpression,
  gray lines mean genetic interactions, blue lines mean shared protein domains, and
  red lines mean physical interactions
