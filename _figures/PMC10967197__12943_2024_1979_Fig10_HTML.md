caption: Schematic of the role of the IGF2BP2-TRPM2-AS/PABPC1-NUMB-NOTCH1 axis in
  GBC angiogenesis. In GBC cells, IGF2BP2 increases the stability of TRPM2-AS in an
  m6A-dependent manner, and overexpressed TRPM2-AS in tumors can be transferred to
  endothelial cells via exosomes and promote endothelial cells angiogenesis by activating
  the NOTCH1 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, TRPM2-AS promotes the degradation
  of NUMB mRNA by enhancing the interaction of PABPC1 with NUMB mRNA. Further studies
  have shown that PABPC1 interacts with AGO2 and then inhibits the expression of NUMB
  by promoting miR-31-5p and miR-146a-5p-mediated NUMB degradation
