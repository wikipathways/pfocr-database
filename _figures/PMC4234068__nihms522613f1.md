caption: The proteins relevant to complement activation beginning with ICs in the
  classical pathway are shown. Regulators of complement activation are in colored
  boxes adjacent to their site(s) of action. Classical pathway activation can recruit
  the alternative pathway; if intrinsic regulation is overwhelmed, activation and
  generation of C3a, C3b, C5a and C5b-9 ensues, each of which has pathophysiological
  relevance in kidney diseases.
