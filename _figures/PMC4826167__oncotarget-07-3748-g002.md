caption: E-cadherin suppression, which is universally regarded as the hallmark of
  the EMT process, is mediated by H19/miR-675 through different mechanisms as reported
  recently. The detailed description of the pathways are described in the text. Whichever
  signaling pathway is involved in the up-regulation of H19/miR-675, or by whichever
  mechanism H19 modulates its downstream targets, the end result is one phenotype
  - the ablation of E-cadherin.
