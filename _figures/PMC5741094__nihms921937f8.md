caption: The mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway is activated in response to stress
  stimuli. BCL-2 family proteins with the BH3-only domain such as HRK translocate
  into mitochondria and dimerize with anti-apoptotic BCL-2, releasing pro-apoptotic
  BAK and BAX, which increase mitochondrial membrane permeability. In response, mitochondrial
  components such as cytochrome c leak out and bind to caspase 9 and APAF-1 to form
  the apoptosome. This complex activates caspases 3 and 7, which execute apoptosis.
  The extrinsic pathway is activated when TNF family ligands bind to receptors and
  activate caspase 8, which then activates caspases 3 and 7. Cross talk occurs when
  extrinsic pathway protein caspase 8 cleaves BID into truncated tBID. tBID translocates
  into the mitochondria and dimerizes with BCL-2 family proteins, engaging the intrinsic
  pathway.
