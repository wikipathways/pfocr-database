caption: Biotechnological strategies for acetoin production by B. subtilis. This work
  blocked spore formation at different stages and mitigated autolysis in strains by
  regulating genes for peptidoglycan hydrolase and cell cannibalism. Subsequently,
  NADH/NAD+ was regulated by the redox global regulator Rex to optimize the allocation
  of carbon flux levels, followed by blocking the main pathway of lactate, succinate,
  and 2,3-butanediol production. Finally, the population cell density-induced promoter
  enhances the enhancement of α-acetolactate synthase and α-acetolactate decarboxylase.
