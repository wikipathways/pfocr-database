caption: The figure represents the pathway for the citrate tricarboxylic acid cycle
  for humans as seen at the KEGG resource. The components, proteins, and reagents,
  highlighted in green, are those involved in the pathway for humans. The components
  not highlighted are part of the generic TCA cycle pathway. If another species is
  selected then only those components that contribute to the pathway are highlighted.
