caption: 'Diagram of HPV16 entry into their host cells with a focus on host restriction
  factors. (1) Extracellular events. HPV16 requires mitotically active epithelial
  cells for a successful infection and subsequent replication. However, various defense
  mechanisms form a physical, chemical or biological barrier to prevent viral access.
  This includes nondividing cells, extracellular antimicrobial factors, such as HD5
  and vimentin, and innate immune cells including Langerhans cells (LC). Nevertheless,
  virions gain access through epithelial wounding, allowing the attachment to virus
  receptors, conformational changes of the capsid, and formation of an entry platform.
  (2) Clathrin-independent endocytosis. HPV enter epithelial cells via an unconventional
  clathrin-independent endocytic pathway that involves multiple signaling events,
  resulting in transmembrane protein clustering, recruitment of cytoplasmic endocytosis
  factors, and induction of actin dynamics. These events induce inward budding and
  fission of the membrane to noncoated vesicles. (3) Post-endocytic trafficking. Once
  inside the cell, trafficking adaptors form an early trafficking complex to facilitate
  early endosome (EE) maturation and virus trafficking to late endosome/multivesicular
  bodies (LE/MVB). The low pH inside of LE/MVBs facilitates capsid disassembly. Stable
  L2 insertion into the endosomal membrane is assisted by a translocation complex
  and allows further trafficking and virus escape from autophagosomal and lysosomal
  degradation by proteases. (4) Retrograde transport. L2 interaction with protein
  complexes involved in retrograde trafficking fulfill the subsequent virus transport
  to the TGN. With L2 as the only viral component being exposed to the cytosol, the
  infectious complex evades cytosolic DNA sensors, including the cGAS/STING pathway.
  The antiviral transmembrane protein stannin can induce sorting of HPV16 to lysosomes
  and virus degradation. (5) Minus-end directed transport. With the onset of mitosis,
  the fragmentation of the TGN and breakdown of the nuclear membrane allow the release
  and transport of membrane-encased virions towards mitotic chromatin. Here, the minus-end
  directed transport along microtubules is dependent on L2 interaction with the dynein
  motor complex and components of nuclear import machinery. Tethering of the virus
  vesicle to mitotic chromatin facilitates the localization inside the nucleus after
  completion of mitosis. (6) PML NB association. Inside the nucleus, released viral
  DNA can be detected and repressed by nuclear restriction factors, such as Sp100
  and MYPOP. HPV16 association with reassembling PML NBs after mitosis leads to modified
  virus-associated PML NBs, probably providing a protective environment for the establishment
  of infection and (7) viral gene expression. Created with BioRender.com (accessed
