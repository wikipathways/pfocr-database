caption: Mechanisms of sortase mediated attachment of surface proteins and pilus assembly
  at the bacterial cell wall.A. The S. aureus housekeeping sortase A anchors surface
  proteins to the peptidoglycan. The precursor protein containing an amino terminal
  leader peptide is secreted across the membrane through the Sec pathway. The exported
  protein (light blue) is processed by the sortase enzyme (dark blue, labelled ‘A’),
  which recognizes the LPXTG sequence and cleaves the surface proteins between the
  threonine and glycine residues of the motif. The enzyme then recognizes the pentaglycine
  cross-bridge peptide of lipid II as the second substrate. Subsequent formation of
  a peptide bond between the carbonyl of the threonine and the free amino group of
  the cross-bridge peptide results in covalent attachment of the protein to lipid
  II. The surface protein is then fully incorporated into the cross-linked peptidoglycan
  via the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions during the bacterial cell
  wall synthesis. The sphere coloured light blue represents the folded form of the
  cell surface displayed protein.B. Pilin-specific and housekeeping sortases assemble
  the SpaA pilus in C. diphtheria. The formation of complexes between the pilus-specific
  sortase C (light green) and the tip protein SpaC (light orange) initiates pilus
  assembly. The class C enzyme also recognizes the main pilin subunit SpaA (orange)
  forming SrtC–SpaA complexes. Nucleophilic attack by the free amino group originating
  from a lysine residue present in SpaA results in dissolution of the sortase–SpaC
  intermediate and the formation of a sortase–SpaA–SpaC complex. Repetition of this
  transpeptidation reaction results in pilus elongation. The class C sortase also
  incorporates the minor pilin SpaB (red) into the growing shaft by an analogous mechanism.
  Termination of pilus biogenesis is presumably initiated when the pilin polymer is
  transferred to the class E type housekeeping sortase (dark blue), which subsequently
  catalyses the nucleophilic attack by the amino group within lipid II. In the final
  assembly step the lipid II linked pilus is incorporated in the murein sacculus via
  normal cell wall biosynthesis.
