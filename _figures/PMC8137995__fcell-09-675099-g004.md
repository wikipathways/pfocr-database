caption: The PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway and metabolic programs converge to regulate the
  differentiation of inflammatory versus regulatory T cells in a tumor microenvironment.
  Links between extracellular cues, T-cell receptor (TCR) strength, the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, metabolic programs
  and gene regulation are depicted. (A) Normal conditions. Three stages of differentiation
  over time are shown for Th17, at the end of the timeline, Tregs differentiation
  is presented to indicate that these require more time to differentiate. IL-2-inducible
  T-cell kinase (ITK) and TCR signaling play a critical role in regulating the expression
  of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) by functioning as a rheostat
  that determines the extent of activation of PI3K and mTOR-activated pathways. HIF-1α
  is activated in intermediate and deactivated in final steps of Th17 differentiation.
  A balance between Th17 cells and Tregs is achieved and they can co-exist in the
  time. PPARγ in Tregs should be deactivated in a specific time. (B) Tumor microenvironment
  conditions. We suggest a deregulation of the signaling pathways in Th17 cells and
  Tregs. It is likely that HIF-1α is not inactivated in a tumor microenvironment,
  leading to a higher expression of RORγt, and generating an exhausted Th17. Likewise,
  PPARγ may not be deactivated in Tregs, leading to functional Tregs. Immunotherapy
  proposals could be directed at targets such as HIF-1α and PPARγ. Activated interactions
  between components are indicated by solid lines, whereas inactivated links between
  proteins are denoted with dashed lines. The blue lines indicate positive direct
  interactions between the components. Red lines indicate direct negative interactions.
  The green squares indicate that the component is active, the red square indicates
  that the component is inactive. ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway;
