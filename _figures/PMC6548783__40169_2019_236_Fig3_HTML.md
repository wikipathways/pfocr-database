caption: IL-6 production by blood leukocytes is altered in the RA-like PsoA patient
  in response to immune activators. In healthy individuals (top panel), the stimulation
  of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with immune activators leads to the activation
  of intracellular multiprotein oligomers (e.g. inflammasomes) and specific receptors
  that activate signalling pathways, including TRAF proteins, translocation of transcription
  factors and subsequent cytokine response. In the patient with aggressive RA-like
  PsoA (bottom panel), the activation of blood cells with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28, pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β, TNF and IFN-γ, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), lipopolysaccharide + adenosine
  triphosphate (LPS + ATP) and poly(deoxyadenylate–thymidylate) [poly(dA:dT)] led
  to a unique overproduction of IL-6 (red arrows). As the patient is a heterozygous
  carrier for a single nucleotide polymorphism p.Asp10Asn (p.D10N) in TRAF3IP2, this
  susceptibility allele causes altered TRAF6 binding (double red lines with an oblique
  stroke). The inhibition of the TRAF6 pathway could upregulate the TRAF2/5 pathway,
  leading to an enhanced immune response [, ] (dashed red arrow)
