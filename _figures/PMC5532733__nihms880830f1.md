caption: The first and rate-limiting step of human isoprenoid synthesis is the conversion
  of HMG-CoA to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). This enzyme is the molecular
  target of the statin drugs. Several steps downstream, farnesyl diphosphate synthase
  (FDPS) catalyzes the production of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) from dimethylallyl
  diphosphate DMAPP and two equivalents of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). This enzyme
  is the molecular target of the nitrogenous bisphosphonates. Farnesyl diphosphate
  is a key branch point of isoprenoid metabolism, giving rise to squalene in a reaction
  catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) in the
  GGDPS reaction.
