caption: Combined use of antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and FGL1/LAG3 in the tumor
  microenvironment. The PD-1/P-L1 and FGL1/LAG3 signaling pathways can be inhibited
  by the corresponding antibodies, leading to the reactivation of nonactive T cells,
  while downstream pathways and phenotypes associated with tumor cell progression
  are weakened. In addition to TILs, MDSCs, TAMs (M2) and Tregs in the TME are known
  to mediate antitumor immunity through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, but their roles in
  the FGL1/LAG3 pathway remain to be determined
