caption: Gβγ-induced relief of conformational  constraints in Ste5 promotes MAPK activation.
  The findings obtained in  this study suggest a model for how conformational changes
  in Ste5  contribute to the efficiency of MAPK activation. In naive cells, Ste5  exists
  as an oligomer (most simply, a dimer) and binds to Ste11, Ste7,  and Fus3 in a conformational
  state that prevents phosphorylation of  Ste11 by Ste20. Binding of Gβγ to the RING-H2
  domain in Ste5 causes  conformational changes that expose Ste11 and permit closer
  contact  between the N and C termini of Ste5, thereby optimizing orientation of  the
  bound kinases for cross-phosphorylation. Collectively, these events  facilitating
  the Ste20-dependent activation of the three kinases of the  MAPK module.
