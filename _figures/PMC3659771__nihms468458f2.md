caption: 'An arterial endothelial cell is shown on the left, while a venous endothelial
  cell is depicted on the right. Two main signaling pathways operate downstream of
  VEGF-A to induce arterial differentiation: the Notch pathway and the Phospholipase
  Cγ (PLCγ) / Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The transcription factors
  Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly induce Dll4 and Hey2 transcription. VEGF-A signaling, by
  an unknown mechanism, augments Foxc1/Foxc2 induction of Dll4 and Hey2 gene expression.
  During venous differentiation, two different mechanisms inhibit artery differentiation.
  The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII suppresses neuropilin1 expression, thereby
  suppressing reception of the VEGF-A signal and activation of Notch signaling. In
  addition, activation of PI3K/Akt signaling antagonizes promotion of arterial cell
  differentiation by blocking ERK activation.'
