caption: 'Biosynthesis of coenzyme Q. (A) The CoQ biosynthetic pathway is largely
  homologous between S. cerevisiae (polypeptide names above arrows) and humans (polypeptide
  names below arrows). In humans, at least seven nuclear-encoded catalytic proteins
  are directly responsible for the biosynthesis of CoQ from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid
  (4-HB), a tyrosine derivative. The enzyme(s) responsible for the decarboxylation
  and hydroxylation step(s) (dashed arrows) at ring position 1 has not been found.
  Hence, there is uncertainty about the order of steps. The decarboxylation step may
  precede the Coq6/COQ6 hydroxylation step based on the accumulation of 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylphenol
  (4-HP) in yeast and human cells harboring mutations in Coq6/COQ6 data from [,,].
  In addition to the yeast Coq and human COQ polypeptides, other polypeptides involved
  in CoQ biosynthesis include PDSS1 and PDSS2 (decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunits
  1 and 2), Yah1 (yeast ferredoxin), Arh1 (yeast ferredoxin reductase), FDX1 and FDX2
  (human ferredoxins 1 and 2), and FDXR, human ferredoxin reductase. Intermediates
  in the pathway include: DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  HPB, 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid; DHPB, 4,5-dihydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoic
  acid; HMPB, 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-polyprenylbenzoic acid; DHP, 4,5-dihydroxy-3-polyprenylphenol;
  DDMQH2, 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone; DMQH2, 2-methoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone;
  DMeQH2, 3-methyl-6-methoxy-2-polyprenyl-1,4,5-benzenetriol. Note that the intermediates
  found in S. cerevisiae contain a hexaprenyl tail, while humans make decaprenylated
  CoQ10 intermediates. (B) The CoQ synthome (Complex Q in humans) is a high-molecular
  mass protein and lipid complex data from [], consisting of polypeptides COQ3-COQ9.
  The PDSS proteins (homologous to S. cerevisiae Coq1), COQ2, and the lipid-binding
  proteins COQ10A and COQ10B do not associate with the complex. Colored hexagons indicate
  CoQ intermediates; white hexagons indicate the final CoQ product. Polypeptides for
  which the human protein structures have been solved are highlighted in pink. The
  COQ8A/COQ8B polypeptides are thought to have a dynamic association with complex
  Q. Polypeptides are not drawn to scale and their stoichiometry has not been determined.'
