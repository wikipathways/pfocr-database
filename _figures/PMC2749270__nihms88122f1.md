caption: 'Antigens induce allergic responses via crosslinking of IgE-bound FcεRI receptors
  on the surface of mast cells, triggering elaborate signaling cascades that result
  in degranulation and immediate release of a plethora of inflammatory mediators.
  One such pathway is the activation of SphK1 and SphK2 and the subsequent production
  of S1P. S1P can be degraded by SPP or SPL, leading to the production of PE. Intracellular
  S1P can then be secreted from mast cells via the ABCC1 transporter to bind its receptors
  extracellularly, or may act intracellularly to induce calcium release independent
  of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Extracellular signaling through S1P1
  is important for migration of mast cells to sites of inflammation, while S1P2 inhibits
  motility, probably to resolve cellular movement upon arrival at target sites and
  also aids in degranulation. Calcium influx is necessary for processes that are critical
  to the induction of allergic responses and anaphylaxis, such as degranulation and
  activation of cPLA2, and various transcription factors. Histamine and PAF induce
  vasodilation, ASM contraction, and increase vascular permeability and mucus production.
  Activation of cPLA2 is the rate-limiting step in the production of all eicosanoids,
  including PGD2 and CysLTs, which themselves induce vasodilation, bronchoconstriction
  vascular permeability, epithelial and endothelial cell activation and proliferation,
  immune cell recruitment, migration and ASM activation and proliferation. Release
  of immediate mediators of inflammation from mast cells is followed by increased
  transcription of various cytokine and chemokine factors that induce mucus production,
  bronchoconstriction and immune cell recruitment. Collectively, mast-cell mediators
  promote inflammation and, furthermore, function to activate and recruit other immune
  cells, thereby exacerbating the symptoms of allergy and anaphylaxis. ASM: Airway
  smooth muscle; cPLA: Cytosolic phospholipase A2; CysLT: Cysteinyl leukotriene; PAF:
  Platelet-activating factor; PE: Phosphatidylethanoloamine; PGD2: Prostaglandin D2;
  PG: Prostaglandin; SphK: Sphingosine kinase; S1P: Sphingosine-1-phosphate; SPL:
  S1P lyase; SPP: Specific phosphatase.'
