caption: Main steps in glycolysis and possible key enzymes regulated in the Warburg
  effect. The three reactions catalyzed by hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase-1
  (PFK1), and pyruvate kinase (PK) in this process are rate-limiting steps. During
  glycolysis, four molecules of ATP are produced per molecule of oxidized glucose
  via substrate-level phosphorylation, and the net yield is two molecules of ATP after
  deduction of two ATPs consumed in phosphorylation. The fate of pyruvate depends
  largely on the availability of oxygen for the cells. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate
  under hypoxia via an anaerobic glycolysis pathway or, under aerobic conditions,
  oxidized to yield acetyl-coenzyme A, which is then oxidized completely to CO2 via
  the citric acid cycle, resulting in the production of large amounts of ATP. G-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; G6DP, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT, glucose transporter;
  Fru-2,6-P2, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MCT, monocarboxylate
  transporter; TPI, triose phosphate isomerase.
