caption: Biosynthesis of OXT-A. (a) Proposed biosynthetic pathway for OXT-A. (b) Possible
  mechanisms of OxsB catalysis. Cobalamin has been proposed to serve as the electron
  acceptor for the oxidative radical quenching step (mechanism A). Alternatively,
  cobalamin may react with the radical intermediate to facilitate cyclization (mechanism
  B).
