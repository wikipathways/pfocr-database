caption: Illustrates the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) signaling
  pathway in response to oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is bound
  to Keap1 in the cytoplasm, leading to its degradation. Upon oxidative stress or
  exposure to ROS/electrophiles, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates into
  the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) to promote the
  expression of antioxidant proteins. Phytochemicals such as curcumin, EGCG, and resveratrol
  enhance Nrf2 activation by stabilizing Nrf2, oxidizing cysteine residues, or activating
  AMPK, which phosphorylates Nrf2. This pathway plays a crucial role in cellular defense
  mechanisms against oxidative damage. Created with BioRender.com
