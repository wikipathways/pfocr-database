caption: Proposed biosynthesis pathway of pyrethrin alcohols, known as rethrolones
  (the compounds in the shaded area), from jasmonic acid (JA). JA is synthesized from
  linolenic acid in reactions sequentially catalyzed by lipoxygenase (LOX), allene
  oxide synthase (AOS), allene oxide cyclase (AOC), cis(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid
  reductase (OPR), and β-oxidation enzymes. JA is converted to jasmone by currently
  unknown enzymes. As described in this report, the conversion of jasmone to jasmolone
  is catalyzed by the enzyme jasmolone hydroxylase (JMH). Pyrethrolone and cinerolone
  are possibly derived from jasmolone in as yet uncharacterized reactions. Finally,
  each of the three alcohols can be linked to either trans-chrysanthemic acid or pyrethric
  acid by the enzyme GLIP (GDSL lipase-like protein) to form a total of six types
  of pyrethrins, called cinerin I, pyrethrin I, and jasmolin I (these three having
  a trans-chrysanthemic acid moiety) and cinerin II, pyrethrin II, and jasmolin II
  (with a pyrethric acid moiety).
