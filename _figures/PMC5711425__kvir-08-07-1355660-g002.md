caption: Schematic representation of downregulated transcripts related to P. brasiliensis
  cell wall homeostasis. Transcripts related to mannan metabolism was induced (PADG_04693)
  or repressed (PADG_07841). Transcripts encoding proteins related to glycan synthesis
  (PADG_07523, PADG_12370 and PADG_05870) were downregulated upon 6 h post- infection
  in mouse lung. Down-regulation of glycan synthesis can be triggered by downregulation
  of the Ras-dependent signaling pathway (PADG_07962) which activates chitin biosynthesis
  (indicated by arrow 1). Also, protein kinase C (pKC, PADG_07326) and calmodulin
  (PADG_07774) dependent signaling pathways can modulate chitin synthesis (indicated
  by arrows 1 and 3, respectively). Both are negativelly regulated in this condition.
  Transcripts encoding proteins related to chitin biosynthesis (PADG_06438, PADG_08636,
  PADG_07802, PADG_08120 and PADG_04485) were repressed; (PADG_12130) was induced.
  The downregulation of the cell wall synthesis is also evidenced by the negative
  regulation of transcripts encoding proteins related to the cellular destination
  of chitin synthase (PADG_04697, PADG_05937)and GPI anchoring (PADG_08703). Transcripts
  encoding proteins related to GPI synthesis wasrepressed (PADG_04786). Thoese transcripts
  are supplied in Tables S1 and 2. The MultiExperiment Viewer software V.4.8 (www.tm4.org/mev/)
  was used to group the compare data of expression ratios and color scale was adapted.
