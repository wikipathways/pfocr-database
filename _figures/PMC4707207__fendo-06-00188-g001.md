caption: The PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3) produced from phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate
  (PIP2) by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PTEN is a phosphatase that promotes
  the reverse reaction. For activation, Akt is phosphorylated on Thr(308) by phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and on Ser(473) primarily by the mTORC2 complex serving as PDK2.
  Upon full activation, Akt leaves the membrane and can adopt a nuclear or cytosolic
  localization. There are over 70 known molecular targets of the Akt kinase and the
  three targets believed to be the most important in carcinogenesis are shown. By
  phosphorylation of TSC2, Akt relieves its repressive effects on Rheb, resulting
  in downstream activation of the mTORC1 complex and enhanced RNA translation. GSK3β
  is a tumor suppressor, which targets a number of proliferation and survival regulators,
  including β-catenin and Mcl-1, and elevates activity of TSC2 [reviewed in Ref. ()].
  The family of forkhead transcription factors, FoxO, upregulates genes controlling
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and is inhibited by Akt. Whereas GSK3β and TSC2
  can be phosphorylated by p-Akt(Thr308) in cells, phosphorylation at Ser(473) is
  critical to inactivate FoxO proteins [reviewed in Ref. ()]. When these are phosphorylated
  they become transcriptionally inactive and subject to nuclear export. FoxO3A exhibits
  reduced nuclear expression in the majority of thyroid cancers in association with
  high levels of p-Akt(Ser473), and relevant FoxO3A downstream target genes have been
  identified in follicular rat thyroid cells () and subsequently in benign (FRTL-5)
  and malignant human thyrocytes (FTC-133) (), as the CDKN1B gene encoding cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor, p27KIP1, and BCL2L11, encoding Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of
  the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
