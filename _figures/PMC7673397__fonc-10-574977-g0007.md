caption: Map of the KEGG pathway “Pathways in Cancer” displaying genes with differentially
  expressed mRNA fragments and miRNA targets specific to histologies. The genes that
  are partially highlighted and color coded are significantly associated within seminoma
  (blue) or non-seminoma (yellow). Genes fully highlighted are significantly associated
  when both histologies (red) are included in the analyses.
