caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of aldaulactone in A. dauci. The HR-PKS (AdPKS7)
  produces a reduced triketide. This triketide becomes the starter unit of the NR-PKS
  (AdPKS8). AdPKS8 catalyzes the addition of four more malonyle-CoA units. The AdPKS8
  PT domain catalyzes a C3–C8 aldol condensation. AdPKS8 TE domain then catalyzes
  the macrolactone cyclisation. Afterward, the cluster 8 oxidase catalyzes the addition
  of an alcohol function on C6 of the benzene diol. Finally, the methylation of the
  C6 alcohol function is catalyzed by the cluster 8 methyl transferase.
