caption: (a) Heat map showing the ranks of new T9αH and T1βHs and other Taxol biosynthetic
  genes in the three modules. T9αH-725A is the T9αH independently reported by other
  groups.8-10 (b) Proposed biosynthetic pathway from 4, the latest intermediate we
  reported recently,13 to taxusin (6) and the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms
  (EICs) of products 4-6 when the indicated sets of genes were expressed in N. benthamiana
  leaves. Blue shade highlights the biosynthetic pathway toward Taxol, which only
  involves 4 and 5. (c) Proposed biosynthetic pathway from 5 to baccatin VI (11-Bz)
  and the corresponding EICs of intermediates when the indicated sets of genes were
  expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. Blue shade highlights the biosynthetic pathway
  toward Taxol. Structures of 5, 7-Ac, 7-Bz, 8-Ac, 8-Bz, 9-Ac, 9-Bz, 10-Ac, 10-Bz,
  11-Ac are proposed based on functions of enzymes previously characterized (TAT,
  TAX19, T2αH, TBT, T7βH, and TOT) and described in this study (T9αH-750C, T7AT, and
  T1βH). TAX19 are used to generate known 13-O-acetylated products, including taxusin
  (6) and baccatin VI (11-Bz), for structural analysis. (d) EICs of expected products
  when the pathway to 6O4A is expressed with TOT, T7AT, or both in N. benthamiana.
  In the absence of T7AT, no significant 6O4A depletion or product formation by TOT
  is observed. (e) MSMS fragmentation patterns of heterologously produced baccatin
  VI (11-Bz) in N. benthamiana compared to that of 11-Bz standard. MSMS fragmentations
  were generated using [M+Na]+ (m/z = 737.2788) as the precursor ion and fragmented
  with a collision energy of 30 eV
