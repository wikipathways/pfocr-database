  Stress Responses and Cell Death.Regular (24 h) light-dark cycles adjust circadian

  This allows the clock to coordinate diverse physiological and developmental processes,
  including stress responses, in a time-of-day-specific manner, thereby enhancing
  plant fitness (left side). In contrast, circadian stress regimes lead to a perturbation
  of the circadian clock, which consequently generates altered, in part detrimental,
  clock outputs (right side). While a normal cytokinin status can strongly alleviate
  this response (A), it is particularly pronounced in plants with a reduced cytokinin
  status exhibiting insufficient nighttime expression of CCA1/LHY (B) and in plants
  with reduced CCA1/LHY function (C). In these plants, circadian stress causes disproportionate
  stress responses, specifically oxidative stress and JA responses, eventually leading
  to cell death. We showed that the activation of the JA pathway, through JA-Ile,
  promotes cell death development. We conclude that cytokinin, primarily by supporting
  nighttime CCA1 and LHY expression, sustains proper clock function under circadian
  stress. We propose that this function reflects an activity of the hormone in promoting
  clock function that is also exerted under natural favorable conditions (dashed arrow)
  and serves as a backup mechanism under unfavorable conditions.
