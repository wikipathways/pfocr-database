caption: (A) The abundance of the HIF transcription factor is regulated by the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
  EglN dioxygenases, which are sensitive to changes in oxygen and metabolism, and
  by the PI3K–AKT-mTOR pathway, which is involved in nutrient sensing and frequently
  mutationally activated in cancer. HIF induces the transcription of a number of JmjC
  histone demethylases.(B) Mutational inactivation of the Krebs Cycle Enzymes SDH
  and FH leads to the accumulation of succinate and fumarate, respectively, whereas
  tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants produce high levels of R-2-hydroxyglutarate
  (R-2HG). Succinate, fumarate, and R-2HG can inhibit 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxy-genases,
  including JmjC histone demethylases and TET DNA hydroxylases.
