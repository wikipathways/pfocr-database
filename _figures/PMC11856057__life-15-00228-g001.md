caption: Overview of the general mechanisms involved in Notch signaling. The Notch
  signaling pathway involves adjacent cells, and their communication involves four
  receptors (Notch 1–4) and five types of ligands (Delta 1, 3, and 4 and Jagged 1
  and 2). When the ligand binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor (NECD),
  two subsequent cleavages occur. First, the metalloprotease complex ADAM 10/17 cuts
  the NECD from the rest of the receptor (S2 cleavage), followed by the S3 cleavage
  mediated by the γ-secretase complex. This proteolysis leads to the detachment of
  the intracellular domain (NICD) from the transmembrane domain (TMD) and its translocation
  into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus (right), it attaches to the CSL, a DNA
  binding protein, together with other co-activator (Co-A) factors like Mastermind-like
  proteins (MAML 1–3), and activates the transcription and translation of target genes.
  On the other hand, when the NICD is not released from the membrane, co-repressors
  (Co-R) attach to the CSL protein and inhibit the activation of the target genes
