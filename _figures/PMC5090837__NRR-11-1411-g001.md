caption: Mechanisms implicated in the antidepressant-like effect of guanosine.The
  antidepressant-like properties of guanosine are associated with the activation of
  the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and its downstream target
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as with its neuroprotective effects
  in the hippocampus, where this nucleoside reduces the occurrence of oxidative damage
  by stimulating the antioxidant response of neurons. In addition, the ability of
  this purine to stimulate glutamate uptake by neighboring astrocytes, may also contribute
  to its neuroprotective activity, particularly at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses.
  Furthermore, the antidepressant-like effects of guanosine are also correlated with
  the modulation of hippocampal structural plasticity (i.e., adult hippocampal neurogenesis).
  In particular, guanosine can induce morphological alterations in the ventral portion
  of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (a region thought to play a role in affective behaviors
  and mood regulation), promoting a significant increase in the number of immature
  neurons without altering stem cell proliferation.
