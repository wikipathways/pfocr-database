caption: Metabolic reprogramming in cancer. The dense fibrotic barrier characteristic
  of PDAC limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients from the bloodstream. However,
  PDAC cells adapt to this harsh environment by not only securing the energy needed
  for survival, but by also acquiring the ability to invade and metastasize. Key mechanisms
  include the reprogramming of glucose, glutamine, and the lipid metabolism driven
  by oncogenic KRAS, as well as nutrient recycling through autophagy and macropinocytosis.
  Oncogenic KRAS mutations in PDAC cells upregulate GLUT1, HK1, HK2, and LDHA, leading
  to increased glucose consumption. When glycolysis is upregulated in tumor cells,
  lactate production increases, leading to the formation of an acidic TME. This promotes
  mesenchymal traits and supports an immunosuppressive TME. In the hypoxic TME, HIF-1α
  activates GLUT1, enhancing glucose uptake, and upregulates LDHA and MCT4, promoting
  a shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis. This shift enables
  ATP production to be maintained under hypoxic conditions, whereas MCT4 facilitates
  the export of lactate, supporting the metabolic reprogramming. Glutamine is essential
  for ATP synthesis through the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, playing a crucial role in tumor
  growth. The glutaminase inhibitor BPTES substantially inhibits the proliferation
  of PDAC. The MVP is an essential lipid metabolic pathway required for cholesterol
  biosynthesis and the prenylation of proteins. HMGCR inhibitors, which inhibit the
  rate-limiting step of the MVP, such as statins, are used to lower cholesterol levels
  and are also being investigated as anticancer agents. The upregulation of autophagy
  is a characteristic of PDAC, and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine suppresses
  tumor proliferation. Macropinocytosis actively produces free amino acids that support
  tumor metabolism and occurs in PDAC cells with KRAS mutations. IDO, which converts
  tryptophan to kynurenine, is often overexpressed in PDAC. The depletion of tryptophan
  and the production of kynurenine in the TME create an immunosuppressive environment
  that weakens antitumor T-cell responses. ATP has immunostimulatory effects; however,
  it is converted to AMP by the ectonucleotide triphosphate diphosphohydrolase CD39,
  and then AMP is converted to adenosine by CD73. CD73 plays a crucial role in regulating
  the immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC and may promote tumor progression.
