caption: Hypothetical role of Hsp72 in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced
  HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and release. In response to stresses (e.g., heat
  shock), Hsp72 is produced to maintain a pool of Hsp72 in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation
  with secondary oxidative stress (e.g., H2O2), Hsp72 is translocated into the nucleus,
  where it directly, or indirectly, interacts with various nuclear proteins (such
  as HMGB1 and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The intranuclear Hsp72-HMGB1 consequently
  prevents HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent release via the secretory
  lysosome pathway.
