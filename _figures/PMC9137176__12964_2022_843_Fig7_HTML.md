caption: 'The Hippo pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of the LH cascade.
  Early events: Following binding of LH to its receptor, CREB is activated and YAP1
  is recruited in proximity to the transcription start site of the Areg promoter.
  The latter contributes to the rapid upregulation of Areg in response to the LH stimulus.
  High extracellular levels of AREG contribute to the activation of the EGFR and downstream
  ERK1/2 pathway, and to the regulation of several LH-dependent genes. Delayed events:
  Granulosa cell stimulation by LH subsequently activates the Hippo pathway, resulting
  in YAP1 phosphorylation through a PKA-dependent mechanism. This Hippo activation
  is thought to be necessary for the transient expression pattern of Areg and for
  prolonged LH effects. Dashed arrows indicate a relation for which unidentified intermediate
  effectors may be involved. Created with BioRender.com'
