caption: VIP activates the VPAC2 signaling pathway in pancreatic islets. VIP binding
  to VPAC2 receptors on β-cells activates AC and increases the concentration of cAMP,
  which activates PKA and the Epac family. PKA triggers the closure of ATP-dependent
  K+ channels, resulting in plasma membrane depolarization, and the opening of voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels, which leads to an increased influx of Ca2+. Activation of Epac mobilizes
  the release of Ca2+ from internal storage. Both the processes cause elevated intracellular
  Ca2+ levels and the release of insulin through exocytosis.
