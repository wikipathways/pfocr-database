caption: 'In RCC cells, both tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) are down-regulated. The mitochondrial biogenesis is also downregulated
  in RCC cells. In the context of the fatty acid metabolism, synthesis of fatty acid
  and lipids are up-regulated whereas β-oxidation of fatty acids is downregulated.
  Levels of carnitines, the fatty acid carriers, are also increased in RCC. Moreover,
  metabolites and enzymes in the cholesterol and phospholipid synthesis are also upregulated
  which leads to accumulation of lipid droplets, which gives the distinct clear histologic
  phenotype for clear cell renal cancer cells. In terms of glutamine metabolism, increased
  glutamine and upregulated reductive carboxylation pathway facilitate glutamine-dependent
  lipogenesis. Also, the glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) pathway for glutamine
  is upregulated to counteract the oxidative stress. The metabolites are depicted
  by squares and enzymes or transporters are denoted by ovals in the figures. Green
