caption: Top2b-regulated gene, Crx, is a master regulator of photoreceptor development
  and maintenance [8]. Pathway based on Langouet et al., 2022 [35], Zheng & Chen.,
  2024 [34], Pan et al., 2023 [36], and Peng et al., 2005 [37]. Top2b regulation of
  Crx represents a critical control point for photoreceptor development, differentiation,
  and survival. Red arrows denote downregulation, while red crosses in this figure
  denote a lack of protein binding and a lack of repression due to absence. The upward
  blue arrow represents upregulation
