caption: (A) The ER supports protein biosynthesis, in which luminal or membrane proteins
  are co-translationally translocated into the ER via the Sec61 translocon. The actions
  of ER-resident factors, including the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), binding immunoglobulin
  protein (BiP), and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), facilitate folding of these
  substrates. (B) Upon proper folding, the substrates are packaged into COPII-coated
  vesicles en route for transport via the classic secretory pathway. (C) However,
  when the substrates misfold, the ER mounts the UPR, which is an ER stress response
  that transiently suppresses global protein synthesis or activates the selective
  expression of ER-resident chaperones to assist the folding of proteins in the ER.
  (D) In contrast, terminally misfolded proteins are targeted to the cytosol for proteasomal
  degradation via the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD). (E) In parallel, for
  misfolded aggregated cargos, they are removed from the ER and directed to the lysosome
  for degradation via a selective autophagy pathway called ER-phagy. (F) The ER is
  also responsible for calcium homeostasis, as well as lipid biosynthesis. (G) The
  ER also establishes membrane contacts with other intracellular compartments such
  as the endosome and mitochondria. Functionally, these contact sites are thought
  to mediate lipid and ion exchange, as well as organelle biogenesis.
