caption: Interleukin-6 receptor complex activation and canonical STAT3 signaling pathway.
  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) first engages and binds to IL-6-receptor-α subunit (IL-6Rα,
  gp80) in the plasma membrane of cells and the IL-6-IL-6Rα complex then recruits
  the gp130 signaling subunit. The gp130 subunit and its constitutively associated
  Janus kinases (JAKs) are rapidly activated as indicated by the auto-phosphorylation
  and activation of the JAK together with phosphorylation of a number of tyrosine
  residues on gp130 (pYs 767, 814, 905 and 915). Latent STAT3 in the cytoplasm is
  recruited to specific pY docking sites on the gp130 subunits of IL-6-activated receptor
  complexes through interactions with the STAT3 SH domain. The associated JAK of the
  activated IL-6 receptor complex phosphorylates STAT3 at pY705. Reciprocal interactions
  between SH-2 domains of pSTAT3 monomers and the pY705 residue of another pSTAT3
  partner lead to dimerization and translocation to the nucleus. Large protein complexes
  like activated pSTAT3-Y705 dimers may only enter the nucleus through the nuclear
  pore complex in a process facilitated by importin α and β proteins. pSTAT3-Y705
  dimers interact with importins α5 and α7 and in conjunction with importin β these
  proteins mediate the entry of pSTAT3-Y705 through the nuclear pore. Inside the nucleus
  pSTAT3 dimers bind specific DNA response elements in the promoters of target genes
  to regulate their transcription
