caption: BCAAs metabolism in Cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KRAS
  can inhibit the ubiquitination of BCAT2 by spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and E3 ubiquitination
  ligase TRIM21, thereby stabilizing the expression level of BCAT2 in PDAC cells and
  promoting the proliferation of tumor cells. BCAAs promote Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase
  1 (USP 1) through the GCN2-eIF2a pathway and inhibit the degradation of BCAT2 by
  deubiquitination of the K299 site of BCAT2. This process is inhibited during the
  BCAAs deprivation. cAMP-responsive Elin-Binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and
  SIRT4 compete to bind the K44 site of BCAT2, regulating the acetylation level of
  this site and the degradation of BCAT2. In triple-negative breast cancer, tumor
  cells can activate MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling through IGF-1 and insulin signaling,
  and PI3K/AKT signaling can go on to activate Foxo3a, mTOR signaling, BCAT in the
  cytoplasm of tumor cells can also promote mitochondrial genesis and mitochondrial
  function by activating Foxo3a, AKT, mTOR, and Nrf2 to gain survival advantages.
