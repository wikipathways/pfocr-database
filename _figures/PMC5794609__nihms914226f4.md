caption: Ingenuity Pathway network showing significant pathways (P-value ≤0.05) enriched
  by VvInt correlated transcripts. Pathways are connected by 1 or more shared genes.
  The network displays two principal domains driven by negatively correlated (left)
  and positively correlated (right) transcripts. The nodes (pathways) are connected
  by (edges) genes shared between them
