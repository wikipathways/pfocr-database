caption: Suppressive mechanism of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Treg cells exert their
  immunosuppressive function through several mechanisms. The first immunosuppressive
  mechanisms involving cytokines include consumption of interleukin (IL)‐2 by Treg
  cells highly expressing CD25 (IL‐2 receptor α‐chain), suppression by inhibitory
  cytokines, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β, IL‐10, and IL‐35, and direct
  killing of effector or antigen‐presenting cells (APC) by perforin, granzyme B, or
  Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interaction. The second immunosuppressive mechanisms involving
  immune checkpoint molecules include inhibition of effector T cells by the lymphocyte
  activation gene‐3 (LAG‐3)‐MHC class II pathway and Treg activation through the inducible
  T‐cell costimulator (ICOS)‐ICOS ligand (ICOSL) and programmed cell death (PD)‐1/PD‐ligand
  (PD‐L)1 pathways. The third immunosuppressive mechanisms include metabolic modulation
  by indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO) expression in dendritic cells (DC), which exhausts
  T cells because critical amino acids for survival are depleted. Furthermore, the
  generation of adenosine from ATP, which is metabolized by CD39 and CD73 expressed
  in activated Treg cells, results in T cell suppression from the induction of negative
  signaling to effector T cells and APCs. The fourth immunosuppressive mechanism involves
  DCs through cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte antigen‐4 (CTLA‐4) and decreased CD80/86 expression
  by APCs by binding to CTLA‐4 expressed by activated eTreg cells, which causes impairment
  of APC maturation, downregulation of CD80/86 molecules on APCs, and attenuation
  of T cell stimulation. A2AR, A2A receptor; CNS, conserved noncoding sequence; Krn,
