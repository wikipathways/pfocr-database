caption: The unfolded protein response in mammalian cells. Binding of BiP to unfolded
  proteins in the ER leads to the activation of PERK, ATF6 and IRE1. PERK activation
  results in elF2α -mediated repression of general translation, but by allowing ATF4
  translation, it also leads to transcriptional up-regulation of some genes, like
  CHOP. NRF2 phosphorylation by PERK and its translocation to the nucleus promotes
  the transcription of genes with antioxidant response elements (AREs) in their promoters.
  Activated ATF6 translocates into the Golgi where, by the action of S1P and S2P proteases,
  the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ATF6 (nATF6) is cleaved. The transcriptionally
  active nATF6 translocates to the nucleus increasing the transcription of genes with
  cyclic AMP responsive elements (CREs) or ER stress response elements (ERSEs). Activation
  of IRE1 leads to the alternative splicing of the mRNA for the XBP-1 transcription
  factor. IRE1 also binds TRAF2, activating the pro-apoptotic JNK mitogen activated
  kinase pathway.
