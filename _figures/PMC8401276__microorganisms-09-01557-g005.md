caption: PHO signaling pathways in yeast (A) and AM fungi (B). The phosphate transporters
  take up the external phosphate into AM fungi. The inositol-polyphosphate kinase
  Arg82 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) kinase Kcs1 involved in the inositol phosphate
  metabolism can mediate the increase of IP7, which is in response to low phosphate
  and functions upstream of Pho81, a mediator of intracellular phosphate sensing in
  the PHO pathway. The adenylate kinase Adk1 and adenosine kinase Ado1 affect IP7synthesis
  and function upstream of Pho81 to negatively regulate the expression of PHO genes.
  The interaction between IP7 and Pho81 induces the formation of the Pho81 and Pho85-Pho80
  tri-complex, resulting in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional activator
  NUC-1 (Pho4 homolog) with cofactor Pho2. Subsequently, the downstream of genes involved
  in the PHO pathway is transcriptionally activated under phosphate limitation. Under
  high phosphate conditions, the SPX domain-containing phosphate transporters PTs
  in AM fungi (e.g., RiPT7 in R. irregularis and GigmPT6/7 in G. margarita, homologs
  of Pho87/90 in yeast) are responsible for the phosphate transport and homeostasis.
  The phosphorylation of NUC-1 by the Pho85-Pho80 complex and its export by Msn5 out
  of the nucleus cause the repression of the PHO pathway. Ino80, whose ATPase activity
  is inhibited by IP6, is required for the regulation of chromatin remodeling and
  transcription, including the expression of some PHO genes. The homologs of SPX domain-containing
  proteins PTs-SPX can regulate phosphate homeostasis at arbuscular mycorrhizas, while
  the vacuolar transporter chaperones (VTCs) and polyphosphatases Ppn1 and Ppx1 can
  regulate vacuolar polyphosphate metabolism. The proteins Plc1, Ipk1, Spl2 and Crz1
  are not found in the genomes of AM fungi. The red lines with the arrows indicate
  facilitation, whereas the blue lines with the dots indicate inhibition and the black
  arrows represent translocation or transformation.
