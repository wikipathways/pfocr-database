caption: PCM cells inhibit osteoblasts differentiation by deregulating the WNT signaling
  pathway via the secretion of inhibitory cytokines DKK1. DKK1 appears to actively
  participate in the regulation of MBD by inhibiting osteoblasts and activating osteoclasts,
  which are potentially involved in myeloma-induced inhibition of osteoblast formation
  and differentiation.
