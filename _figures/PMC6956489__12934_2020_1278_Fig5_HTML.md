caption: Overview of the metabolic pathway of lactate and acetate production in L.
  bulgaricus. The red arrows indicated proteins were down-regulated by ccpA inactivation
  in L. bulgaricus, as observed at the protein level and transcriptomic level. The
  green arrows indicated proteins that were up-regulated. Pfk 6-phosphofructokinase,
  Pgk phosphoglycerate kinase, Pyk pyruvate kinase, LdhA d-lactate dehydrogenase,
