caption: In resting dendritic cells (DCs), fatty acid oxidation is engaged and the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is relatively constrained. Following exposure to agonists
  of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), signalling pathways are activated that
  lead to the expression of a broad array of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)- and interferon-regulatory
  factor (IRF)-responsive genes. This may lead to ER stress and the activation of
  the unfolded protein response (UPR) as the cells attempt to accommodate the production
  of a large set of proteins destined for secretion. A downstream effector of the
  UPR is X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), which transcriptionally activates the genes
  encoding enzymes for fatty acid synthesis; the UPR seems to be constitutively active
  in DCs. For Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and potentially other PRRs, this is coupled
  with activation of AKT, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), inhibitor of NF-κB kinase
  subunit-ε (IKKε) and hexokinase 2 (HK2), which promotes increased flux through the
  glycolysis pathway with resultant increases in citrate export for fatty acid synthesis.
  This is supported by the coincident increase in activity of the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), which facilitates the production of NADPH, a crucial cofactor for
  fatty acid synthesis. Synthesis of new fatty acids allows expansion of the ER, which
  is likely to relieve ER stress and lead to the production and secretion of effector
  molecules that are central to DC activation. Thick arrow indicates that fatty acid
  oxidation is the primary metabolic signature of resting DCs. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
