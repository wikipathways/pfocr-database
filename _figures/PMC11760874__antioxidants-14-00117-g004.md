caption: 'Main biomarkers and metabolic networks of BC99 intervening AALI (AD vs.
  AH). (A) Metabolic pathway analysis of differential metabolites. Each bubble represents
  a metabolic pathway. The larger the bubble, the more important the pathway. (B)
  Correlation analysis of differential metabolites, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. (C) The
  network of key metabolic pathways. Different colors indicate metabolites that were
  upregulated (blue) or downregulated (red) in the AH group compared with the AD group.
  Solid arrow indicates single process. Dotted arrow indicates multiple processes.
  Bar graphs show the levels of important differential metabolites, # p < 0.05 vs.
  the NC group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 vs. the AD group'
