caption: Representative plasmids used in this study. Plasmids were constructed by
  the SLIC method, previously described. They contain the 2μ origin of replication,
  LEU2D or HIS3 genes for selection, the GAL1 or GAL10 promoters, and the CYC1, ADH1,
  or PGK1 transcription terminators. The first three genes of the n-butanol pathway
  were placed on the pESC-LEU2D plasmid and the last two or four (in the case of the
  etfAB, bcd bearing strain) genes were placed on the pESC-HIS3 plasmid.
