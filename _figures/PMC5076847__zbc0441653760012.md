caption: Regulation of IRF1 and IRF1-dependent late-phase gene expression by IL1B
  after DUSP1 silencing and glucocorticoid treatment. Schematics representing possible
  regulatory networks are shown. A, IL1B treatment results in the activation of MAPKs.
  This, along with the activation of other signaling pathway and inflammatory transcription
  factors, e.g. NF-κB and AP-1 (not shown), enhances expression of the negative feed-back
  regulator, DUSP1. After MAPK activation, the increased expression of DUSP1 is one
  mechanism by which MAPK activity is restored to basal. Expression of late-phase
  inflammatory genes by IL1B depends on IRF1 activation. IL1B-mediated activation
  of MAPKs negatively regulates the expression of IL1B-induced IRF1 and selected IRF1-dependent
  late-phase genes (e.g. CXCL10). B, with reduced DUSP1 expression there is reduced
  negative feedback control of MAPKs leading to enhanced MAPK activity (at 1 h) (bold)
  at the times where DUSP1 expression would have been elevated. This reduces IRF1
  (gray) expression. C, in the presence of glucocorticoid co-treatment, DUSP1 expression
  is enhanced (bold) and promotes inactivation of MAPKs (gray). Loss of MAPK activity
  maintains the expression of IRF1 and selected IRF1-dependent late-phase genes (e.g.
  CXCL10) in the presence of glucocorticoids. However, because the expression of some
  of the IRF1-dependent late-phase genes (e.g. APOL6, CMPK2, CFB, HELZ2, IFIT1, IFIT3
  iso1&2, MX1, and UBD) is variable but significantly repressed by glucocorticoids,
  additional glucocorticoid effectors must exist to exert repression of these other
  IRF1-dependent late-phase genes. Positive signaling/expression (blue) is represented
  by arrows. Negative effects are indicated (red) by lines ending in a T-bar.
