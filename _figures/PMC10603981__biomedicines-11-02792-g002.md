caption: 'Necroptosis signaling pathways. Binding death receptor family (Fas receptor,
  TNFR1, and TRAIL-R) and other immunological receptors (TLRs and IFNR) to their ligands
  leads to the activation of initiator factors. Complex I members (TRADD, TRAF2/5,
  cIAP1/2, and RIPK1) are activated by TNFR-1 stimulation. This process inhibits the
  formation of complex II groups, including complex IIa (caspase-8, FADD, and RIPK1)
  and complex IIb (caspase-8, FADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL). RIPK1 deubiquitylation
  leads to the formation of complex II groups, promoting downstream events. So cell
  fate depends on how RIPK1 changes, which can also be activated independently of
  complex I. Activating RIPK1 by Fas, TRAIL-R, INFR, and ZBP 1 stimulates complex
  IIa and IIb independently of complex I. Additionally, extrinsic factors like LPS
  stimulate TLR4, directly resulting in the activation of complex IIb. OXPHOS dysfunction
  or PARP1 overactivity by reducing ATP and increasing ROS stimulates complex IIb.
  Activation of RIPK3 by inactivated caspase-8 results in phosphorylation and oligomerization
  of MLKL, which translocates to the cell membrane, causing membrane rupture and release
  of DAMPs. Abbreviations: TNFR1, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1; TRAIL-R, TNF-Related
