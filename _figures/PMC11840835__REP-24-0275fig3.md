caption: A diagram of mechanisms of glucose controlling the fate of blastocyst. During
  the transition from the eight-cell stage to blastocyst formation, glucose serves
  as a signaling transducer in cell metabolism. Glucose, via the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP), leads to protein O-GlcNAcylation of YAP1, directing it to the cell
  nucleus. In addition, through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glucose-dependent
  nucleotide synthesis activates mTOR and enables Tfap2c translation. The interaction
  between YAP1, TEAD4 and TFAP2C forms a complex that activates CDX2 expression, controlling
  transcription of TE specific genes. O-GlcNAcylation, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine
