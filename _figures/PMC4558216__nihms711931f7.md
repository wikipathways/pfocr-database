caption: The diagram shows the proposed signaling pathway exerting the adverse effect
  of ET-1 on endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. The bioavailability
  of nitric oxide, following activation of eNOS by G protein-coupled adenosine and
  serotonin receptors, is reduced by the elevated level of superoxide in the vascular
  wall. A sub-vasomotor level of ET-1 (10 pmol/L) activates NOX2 for superoxide production
  through ETA receptor-dependent p38 MAPK activation and consequently compromises
  vasodilation to nitric oxide. Alleviating the overproduction of superoxide by agents
  that inhibit the activation of ETA receptors, p38 MAPK and NOX2 or that reduce superoxide
  level directly protects the vascular insult from ET-1.
