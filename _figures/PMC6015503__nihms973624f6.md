caption: Loss of MBLAC1 disrupts the abundance of metabolites residing in several
  KEGG defined metabolic pathways. (A) The user-defined intersection between taurine
  and hypotaurine metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis metabolic pathways
  based on individual KEGG pathways. (B) The KEGG-defined glutathione metabolism pathway.
  (C) The KEGG-defined linoleate metabolism pathway. All metabolic pathways are visualized
  via Cytoscape 3.4 (Arrows denote enzymatic directionality defined by KEGG). Metabolites
  are colored per their FC abundance differences (blue indicates decreased abundance
  in MBLAC1 KO, red indicates increased abundance in MBLAC1 KO).
