caption: Survey of metabolic programs in Breg cells. Metabolic and regulatory programs
  share common signaling cascades in B cells developing regulatory properties. Activation
  signals from the BCR and TLR9 induce different intracellular pathways triggering
  HIF-1α a key player that govern transcription of the prototypic regulatory cytokine
  IL-10 gene and genes involved in the metabolic programs into the nucleus. The polarization
  into Breg cells is under the control of a number of transcription factors and enzymes
  having positive (pointed arrow) or inhibitory (flattened arrow) effects. Glycolysis
  has a central role to generate energy and biomolecules. Through the GLUT1 transporter,
  glucose fuels the TCA cycle within the mitochondria. During the TCA cycle, energy
  is generated through oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation brings additional
  substrates to the TCA cycle and increases lipid synthesis. One intermediate of this
  pathway, the GGPP molecule produced during cholesterol metabolism induces Blimp1
  another key transcription factor of the Breg program following TLR9 stimulation
  leading to enhanced IL-10 production. The co-stimulatory CD40 molecule can also
  stimulates HIF-1α to circumvent the BCR-dependent cascade and contributes to the
  Breg polarization. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATP,
