caption: Aryl-hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Signaling Pathway in Osteoclasts. AhR is
  localized in the cytoplasm in multiprotein complex including c-src and HSP90. Interaction
  with an agonist results in translocation of the complex to the nucleus. In complex
  with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), AhR controls gene transcription by binding
  dioxin-response elements (DRE)/ xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE) containing
  genes. AhR signaling includes non-genomic pathways such as the release of c-src
  kinase with consequent target protein phosphorylation and AhR functioning as an
  E3 ubiquitin ligase. Such intracellular signaling mechanisms lead to either the
  activation or inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and function.
