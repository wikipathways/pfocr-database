caption: 'Indirect pathway striatal spiny module.The medium spiny neuron dendritic
  spine, the glutamatergic terminal and the dopaminergic terminal constitute the so-called
  striatal spiny module (SSM). The segregation of DA and adenosine receptors within
  the two subtypes of medium spiny neurons suggests the existence of at least two
  subtypes of SSMs, which could be termed as enkephalin-SSM (i.e., indirect pathway)
  and dynorphin-SSM (i.e., direct pathway). Thus, while dynorphin-SSM predominantly
  express DA D1 receptor (D1R), enkephalin-SSM express DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) and
  A2ARs. The endocannabinoid (EC)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) model at enkephalin-SSM
  requieres activation of postsynaptic Gq/11-protein coupled receptors (i.e., metabotropic
  glutamate type 5 receptors (mGlu5Rs)) propmting ECs synthesis and release. Co-activation
  of postsynaptic D2R enhances ECs production. ECs activate presynaptic cannabinoid
  1 receptor (CB1R) which induce LTD. GPR37, by modulating A2AR and D2R, play a key
  role balancing ECs production and thus LTD. Chronic A2AR antagonist treatment (i.e.,
  SCH58261, 1 mg/kg per day, intraperitoneal administration, 10 days) induced an increase
  of A2AR density in the striatum of wild-type and GPR37-/- mice. Interestingly, under
  the same experimental conditions a reduction in striatal adenosine (Ado) levels
  and a potentiation of striatal LTD and locomotor sensitization was observed only
  in GPR37-/- mice (right panel). ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; cAMP: cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; DA: dopamine; DAT: DA transporter; Glu: glutamate; LS: locomotor
  sensitization.'
