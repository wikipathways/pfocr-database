caption: 'Metabolic imbalance is the source of biomarkers in osteoporosis In osteoporosis,
  a balanced activity between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is of utmost importance.
  An imbalance between the bone-forming and disturbing activities on the hand of the
  latter results in altered bone formation and eventually osteoporosis. Bone turnover
  biomarkers are promising candidates to monitor these molecular changes in this microcosm.
  Collagen type I produced by osteoblasts is of key importance in bone integrity and
  homeostasis. Under proteolytic activity promoted by osteoclast derived CTSK, collagen
  type I is degraded into several remnants, like CTX-I, NTX, PYD, and DPD. These collagen
  degradation products are candidate molecules for laboratory diagnosis of osteoporosis
  from biological fluids (patients’ sera and urine), CTX-I being currently the most
  widely accepted BTM for this clinical purposes. On the other hand, procollagens
  and osteocalcin are key participants in bone metabolism. According to the current
  guidelines PINP is considered the clinical counterpart of CTX-I, as a BTM of osteoporosis.
  Wnt signal molecules have a cardinal role in the interplay of cellular participants
  in bone tissues. Osteocyte derived sclerostin and DKKs secreted by BMSCs and osteoblasts,
  as inhibitors of the Wnt pathways and subsequently bone formation are two nominee
  molecules for future perspectives. Arrows in green represent activation or secretory
  mechanisms. Arrows in red indicate inhibition or degradation mechanisms.Abbreviations:
