caption: The locus coeruleus (LC) projection to the hippocampus is essential for exercise-induced
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Exercise enhances hippocampal
  BDNF synthesis, leading to activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase
  (ERK) pathway, which converges on the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB). Treatment with drugs that block
  norepinephrine (NE) reuptake enhance noradrenergic neurotransmission, leading to
  activation of adenyl cyclase and cAMP, which also activates CREB, leading to transcription
  of a number of different genes associated with synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis.
  Concurrent exercise and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment could additively
  enhance hippocampal BDNF production and be neuroprotective. AMPA, {alpha}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; TrkB, high-affinity BDNF receptor; CamKII, calcium
  calmodulin kinase II; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2; ERK, extracellular-signal
  related kinase; P, phosphorylation site.
