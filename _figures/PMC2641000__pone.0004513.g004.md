caption: This simplified view based on observations of several investigators shows
  that Otx2 and Sox2 activate expression of Rx. Rx then directly or indirectly activates
  a battery of genes that are involved in the proliferation as well as the morphogenesis
  and early development of the retinal neuroectoderm. At least three independent pathways
  are involved in the activation of proliferation in Rx expressing cells. The first
  pathway is mediated by Xhmgb3, the second utilizes the function of Optx2 and the
  third takes advantage of the anti-differentiation activity of Zic2/Xhairy. At the
  same time, Rx expressing cells also activate several transcriptional factors like
  Pax6, Mab21/2, Six3 and Lhx2 that are necessary for the correct development of the
  optic vesicle. Finally, our data suggests that Rx activates genes encoding specific
  cell surface molecules necessary for the segregation of Rx-expressing cells.
