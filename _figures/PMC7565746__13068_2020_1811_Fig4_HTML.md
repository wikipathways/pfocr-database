caption: Diagrammatic representation of significantly differentially expressed genes
  associated with the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, glycolysis, pentose phosphate
  pathway and TCA cycle when Schizochytrium was cultured under low-temperature conditions.
  Genes that were differentially regulated (|fold change|> = 2 and adjusted p value < 0.001)
  when Schizochytrium was cultured at 16 °C are indicated in red (upregulated) and
  blue (downregulated). HK glycolysis hexokinase, PFKA 6-phosphofructokinase, PGAM
  phosphoglycerate mutase, PC pyruvate carboxylase, PGD glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase,
  PfaA polyketide synthase subunit A, PfaB polyketide synthase subunit B, PfaC polyketide
  synthase subunit C, ME malic enzyme, FAS fatty acid synthase, ELO long-chain fatty
  acid elongase, VLCR very long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase, ACADM acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
  ECHS enoyl-CoA hydratase, LSC succinyl-CoA synthetase
