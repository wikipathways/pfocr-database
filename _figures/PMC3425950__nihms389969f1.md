caption: In normal physiological situations, the PI3K pathway is activated by an extracellular
  stimulus that results in activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). This activation
  causes recruitment of PI3K (which comprises the p85 regulatory subunit and the p110
  catalytic subunit) to the intracellular component of the RTK. PI3K phosphorylates
  the lipid moiety phosphatidylinositol 2-phosphate (PIP2) to form phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate (PIP3), which further recruits other downstream kinases, including Akt,
  to the membrane for phosphorylation, activation, and targeting of effector molecules
  that regulate energy uptake, growth, and proliferation. Negative regulators of this
  pathway include PTEN and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (INPP4), which are
  lipid phosphatases. The p85 subunit of PI3K also has important regulatory roles.
  Several classes of drug agents that target this pathway are in clinical development
  and include class IA–specific PI3K inhibitors, PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors, Akt inhibitors,
  mTORC catalytic inhibitors, and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs). Inhibitors that are
  specific for selected PI3K isoforms are also in clinical development. The Ras-ERK
  pathway is also activated by RTKs. Both Raf and MEK inhibitors are in clinical development.
