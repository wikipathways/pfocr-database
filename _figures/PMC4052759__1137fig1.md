caption: Autophagy regulates p62/SQSTM1 levels to control multiple pro-oncogenic signaling
  pathways. (Top panel) The formation of autophagosomes is controlled at the initiation
  stage by the coordinated action of the ULK1–FIP200–ATG13–ATG101 and Beclin1–Vps34
  signaling complexes and enzymes, including ATG7 and ATG5–ATG12, that function to
  lipidate LC3. Selective autophagy receptors, including p62, interact with the autophagosome
  membrane and are sequestered from the cytosol along with their cargos upon membrane
  closure. Fusion of the autophagosome with lysosomes triggers the degradation of
  sequestered cargo, enabling the basic constituents of digested material to be recycled
  by the cells. (Bottom panel) Loss of essential autophagy genes, such as FIP200 or
  ATG7, attenuates the autophagy pathway and results in the accumulation of both selective
  autophagy receptors and cargo. Increased p62 potentiates NF-κB signaling and the
  elaboration of protumorigenic inflammatory cytokines. Defects in p62 clearance by
  the autophagy pathway may also reinforce pro-oncogenic signaling through the activation
  of mTOR and NRF2, which respectively control cellular growth and antioxidant response
  pathways.
