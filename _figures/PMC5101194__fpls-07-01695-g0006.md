caption: The detailed information on genes involved in the pathway of circadian rhythm.
  (A) The putative regulation network of circadian clock associated with flowering
  in sugar apple. Red arrow indicated depressing; and green arrow indicated activating.
  (B) The expression pattern of red light signaling pathway related genes during the
  flowering process. (C) The expression pattern of blue light signaling pathway related
  genes during the flowering process. (D) The expression pattern of two key flower
  development regulation genes during the flowering process. The different colors
  correspond to the log-transcription values of RPKM refer to each gene shown in the
  bar at the lower right corner of the figure.
