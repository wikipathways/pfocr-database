caption: 'Possible signal transduction pathways of photosynthetic redox signals. The

  transport chain (dark green) or by generation of ROS initiate signalling pathways
  that activate or repress specific target genes in the nucleus (for details see text).

  of photosynthesis, e.g. by transfer of electrons from PSI or reduced ferredoxin
  (Fd) to oxygen-generating superoxide (Mehler reaction). This is detoxified by superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide can be reduced to
  water by ascorbate peroxidases using ascorbate as the electron donor, and requiring
  glutathione (GSH) to restore the electron donor. Unscavenged H2O2 is able to diffuse
  across the chloroplast envelope and is thought to start MAP kinase cascades in the
  cytosol. Electrons from PSI are also transferred to thioredoxin (Trx), which can
  affect LHCII phosphorylation (state transitions) and plastid gene expression and
  possibly also nuclear gene expression. Glutathione synthesis might be another pathway
  by which stress signals can directly leave the plastid. Another ROS, singlet oxygen
  (1O2), is generated at PSII. Because of its short half-life it requires additional
