caption: Cyclic AMP elevation leads to induction of the SOCS-3 gene in VECs. Cyclic
  AMP elevation following stimulation of adenosine or prostaglandin receptors in VECs
  leads to activation of the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways independently of the
  classical PKA route of cyclic AMP signalling. Activation of the ERK cascade leads
  to the phosphorylation and activation of C/EBPβ, STAT3 and SP3 transcription factors
  whereas activation of the JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation and activation
  of c-Jun (SJ Yarwood, unpubl. obs.). Full activation of C/EBPβ requires activation
  of the cyclic AMP GEF, EPAC1, and is dependent on phospholipase Cε (PLCε) protein
  kinase Cα (PKCα) (; ). Activation of ERK by cyclic AMP requires PKC isoforms, η
  and ε. It is currently not known how cyclic AMP elevation leads to the activation
  of JNK MAP kinase. All the transcription factors indicated are required for full
  induction of the SOCS-3 gene by cyclic AMP and are targets for either acetylation
  (ac), which promotes activation, or methylation (me), which inhibits activation,
  on the indicated lysine residues (; ; ; ).

  description: Cyclic AMP elevation leads to induction of the SOCS-3 gene in VECs.
    Cyclic AMP elevation following stimulation of adenosine or prostaglandin receptors
    in VECs leads to activation of the ERK and JNK MAP kinase pathways independently
    of the classical PKA route of cyclic AMP signalling. Activation of the ERK cascade
    leads to the phosphorylation and activation of C/EBPβ, STAT3 and SP3 transcription
    factors whereas activation of the JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation and
    activation of c-Jun (SJ Yarwood, unpubl. obs.). Full activation of C/EBPβ requires
    activation of the cyclic AMP GEF, EPAC1, and is dependent on phospholipase Cε
    (PLCε) protein kinase Cα (PKCα) (; ). Activation of ERK by cyclic AMP requires
    PKC isoforms, η and ε. It is currently not known how cyclic AMP elevation leads
