  acid/5-OH ferulic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT I) catalyzes the second step of
  methylation as deduced by the analysis of transgenic tobacco inhibited for this
  enzyme (), but in vitro studies indicate that COMT I may use 5-OH ferulic acid as
  well as its CoA, aldehyde, and alcohol derivatives (; ; ).
