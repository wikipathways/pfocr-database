caption: Metabolic pathways of methane oxidation and denitrification in the predominant
  Methylobacter species present in Lacamas Lake as inferred from the presence of encoding
  genes in MAG bin‐63. Enzymes/pathways indicated in green were encoded by the genome,
  orange‐streaked indicates the presence of an incomplete pathway. Grey pathways were
  not detected. The asterisk indicates the full fermentation pathway as shown in Fig.
  . FDH, formate dehydrogenase; H4F, methylene tetrahydrofolate pathway; H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin
  pathway; MDH, methanol dehydrogenase; RuMP, ribulose monophosphate pathway.
