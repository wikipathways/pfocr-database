caption: PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade and its corresponding inhibitors. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway is one of the most frequently altered pathways in cancer, and plays an important
  role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis
  and metastasis. Abnormal signal transduction in this pathway is closely related
  to the progression of cancer. Arrows indicate activation and bars indicate inhibition.
  The various inhibitors targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proven to have inhibitory
  effects in ESCC.
