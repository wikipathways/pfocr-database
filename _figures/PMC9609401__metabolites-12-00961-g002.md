caption: Vitamin B9 and the Folate Family. Folate or folic acid is obtained from diet
  and must be converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) before it can enter the folate cycle.
  Dietary 5-methyl-THF can also become incorporated. Folate is converted first to
  dihydrofolate (DHF) before becoming THF, the universal methyl-acceptor of the one
  carbon pathway. Methylation can occur on the 5 or 10 N groups of THF in 5,10-methylene-THF
  and 5-methyl-THF.
