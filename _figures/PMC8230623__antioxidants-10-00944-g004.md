caption: Luciferase gene reporter assay based on the activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling
  pathway. (1) Constitutive proteasome degradation of Nrf2 protein is inhibited by
  inducers acting on KEAP1 stress sensors (cysteines), leading to free cytosolic Nrf2;
  (2) Nrf2 is transferred to the nucleus where it activates antioxidant response element
  (ARE)-dependent gene transcription; (3) expression of luciferase as gene reporter;
  (4) luciferase-dependent formation of luminescent oxyluciferin from luciferin after
  cell lysis.
