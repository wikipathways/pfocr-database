caption: Speculative model of the role of Ste7 ubiquitination (Ub) in the yeast pheromone
  pathway. Upon pheromone stimulation, the G-protein activates a kinase cascade that
  includes Ste20 (not shown), Ste11, Ste7, and the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1. The MAPKs
  phosphorylate transcription factors in the nucleus, including Ste12 (promotes mating,
  not shown) and Tec1 (promotes invasive growth). Ste7 is directly ubiquitinated by
  SCF/Cdc4 (this work). When Ste11 or SCF is not active, cellular pools of Ste7 are
  stabilized (). When Ubp3 is not active, there is an accumulation of polyubiquitinated
  Ste7 (). Also indicated are three mechanisms that promote pheromone pathway specificity
  (green lines). First, Fus3 phosphorylates Tec1, which is then desumoylated, ubiquitinated,
  and degraded (–, , ). Loss of Tec1 prevents transcription of genes necessary for
  invasive growth. However, Kss1 activity is still elevated in cells that lack functional
  Fus3 (, , , ), pointing to additional mechanisms of cross-pathway inhibition upstream
  of the MAPKs. A second mechanism of cross-pathway inhibition requires Fus3 phosphorylation
  of Ste7 (). When Ste7 is phosphorylated, Kss1 is less active (). A third mechanism
  depends on Fus3 phosphorylation of Ubp3. When Ubp3 is phosphorylated, Kss1 is again
  less active (this work). Thus, feedback phosphorylation of either Ste7 or Ubp3 preserves
  Fus3 signaling and limits inappropriate activation of a competing MAPK, Kss1.
