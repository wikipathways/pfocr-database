caption: Altered amino acid and TCA cycle metabolism present in newborn cardiac tissue
  immediately following birth (A) and fetal serum before birth (B) due to chronic
  maternal cortisol exposure in late gestation. Citrate was significantly diminished
  in cortisol (CORT) serum at 0–2 days before delivery, while citrulline was significantly
  elevated in CORT serum at 3–6 days before delivery. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)
  degradation was significantly enriched in fetal serum following overrepresentation
  analysis (ORA), with BCAA and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (both elevated in CORT serum)
  contributing to this pathway. Metabolites in red are significantly elevated in CORT
  compared with control specimens, while metabolites in blue are significantly elevated
  in control compared with CORT specimens. Solid arrows (→) reflect single enzymatic
  steps, while dashed arrows (- ->) reflect multiple enzymatic steps. Dashed lines
  with circles (- -•) reflect associations observed in the literature with no direct
  relationship.
