caption: Effects of cytokines released during exercise and diet on the NLRP3 inflammasome
  pathway. Exerkines, which are cytokines released during exercise, represent inhibitory
  effects on the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, promote M2 polarization, and
  help reduce inflammation and AD progression. AD, Alzheimer's disease; ASC, apoptosis‐associated
  speck‐like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; BHB, β‐hydroxybutyrate;
  CASP, caspase; CO, carbon monoxide; DAMP, damage‐associated molecular pattern; IKK,
