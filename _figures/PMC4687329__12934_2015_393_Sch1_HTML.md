caption: Five-step biotransformation of 1,2,3-trichloropropane into glycerol by the
  enzymes of the synthetic biodegradation pathway. The pathway consists of haloalkane
  dehalogenase DhaA from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13064 [] with the haloalcohol
  dehalogenase HheC and epoxide hydrolase EchA from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1
  [, ]. Computer-assisted protein engineering was used to improve activity of the
  haloalkane dehalogenase towards 1,2,3-trichloropropane, leading to the development
  of the 32-fold more active and 26-fold more efficient mutant DhaA31 []. Formed glycerol
  can be utilized in central catabolic pathways of the host cell
