caption: 'Complement activation by foreign biomaterial surfaces in bone tissue, and
  strategies to modulate the complement system. Complement activation and the presence
  of complement proteins (gray elements) in the bone-biomaterial interface and on
  the biomaterial surface are depicted. Both the classical pathway (CP) and alternative
  pathway (AP) convertases are regarded to contribute to complement activation in
  the response to biomaterials. In addition, the interaction with immune cells and
  their recruitment (dashed arrow line) to the implant site is illustrated. Furthermore,
  complement activation affects bone cells of the peri-implant bone tissue and their
  differentiation from precursor cells. Different strategies to modify complement
  activation in the bone implant area are depicted, including (1) implant coating
  with complement inhibitors (CI) and regulators of complement activity (RCA), (2)
  reduced complement activation by an altered adsorbed surface proteome to a modified
  surface, (3) implant coating with proteins that recruit RCA from the host, and (4)
  local application of CI and RCA. CR: Complement receptor, IgG: Immunoglobulin G,
  MSC: Mesenchymal stem cell, OB: Osteoblast, OCP: Osteoclast precursor cell, OC:
  Osteoclast, C3aR: C3a receptor, C5aR1: C5a receptor 1, C5aR2: C5a receptor 2 (C5L2).'
