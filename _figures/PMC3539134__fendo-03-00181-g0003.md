caption: Serine kinases involved in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.
  In obesity, a network of serine kinases is activated including IKKβ, JNK, and ERK1/2.
  JNK and IKKβ are activated downstream of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such
  as TLRs or by ER stress. IKKβ is also involved in the activation of the Tpl2/ERK
  pathway. These pathways participate in the production of inflammatory cytokines
  via the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB. Many of the produced inflammatory
  cytokines are able to activate these kinases leading to a feed-forward amplification
  loop. JNK and ERK1/2 are involved in the desensitization of insulin signaling through
  phosphorylation of IRS1/2 on inhibitory serine sites (SerP). IKKβ can directly phosphorylate
  IRS1/2 on serine sites but can also act indirectly through activation of mTORC1/S6
  kinase. Over-activation of the mTORC1/S6K pathway could promote ER stress leading
  to an amplification loop.
