caption: Overview of the activations pathways of neutrophils, platelets and endothelial
  cells promoted by pathogens and the possible effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatment
  (HBOT). Pathogens activates the NADPH oxidase driving the respiratory burst when
  phagocytized. Pathogens directly activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2 or TLR4) and
  complement receptors (CRs) enhancing the respiratory burst generating reactive oxygen
  species e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2-) and hypochlorite (OCl-)
  for bacterial killing of phagocytosed bacteria. On the cell wall of bacteria are
  several pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which are pathogen derived
  alerting the host response. Host derived damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs)
  also alert the host response enhancing chemotactic signaling. The activated neutrophil
  upregulates the expression B2 integrin CD11b/CD18 (MAC-1) and integrin L-selectin
  released (shedding) by increased expression of CD11b/CD18. Platelets are directly
  activated by S. aureus and activated platelets bind toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  stimulating ROS. Activated platelets expressing P-selectin bind to the ligand PSGL-1
  forming neutrophil-platelets complexes (PNC) enhancing the respiratory burst system.
  Activated platelets and lysed platelets release platelet microvesicles (MV) in circulation
  activating the intrinsic pathway (contact pathway) of the coagulation cascade leading
  to increased thrombin. Excessive platelet binding of the PMN triggers neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NET) release and hyperactivation of the ROS system transporting
  granules to the membrane by exocytosis and NETosis (membrane disruption), exact
  mechanism unknown. Antimicrobial peptides are released (e.g. myeloperoxidase (MPO),
  neutrophil elastase (NE), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), S100A8/A9)
  to the extracellular space. Besides antimicrobial components NETs consist of chromatin,
  DNA and histone facilitating thrombosis and thrombin generation. Activation of NADPH
  oxidase results in the activation of protein-arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) converting
  arginine to citrulline on histones and chromatin decondensation in the nucleus of
  the PMN. NE and MPO are release for granules (azurophilic) in the cytosol facilitating
  H2O2 and unfolding of chromatin. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) bind CXCL2/8 increasing CD11b/CD18
  by activation of pathways (protein kinase C, PKC) and Src kinases) inducing NET
  release. Collectively, these activation pathways are believed to be halted by HBOT
  resulting in reduced collateral tissue damage in severe infections as infective
  endocarditis. NADPH, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate; Protein Kinase
  A; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species.
