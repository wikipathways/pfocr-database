caption: How C. elegans could develop resistance to monepantel. The ACR-23 receptor
  is represented by a homopentamer that transports monovalent cations (open circles)
  into the cytosol. ACR-23 is activated by betaine (filled red circles) and monepantel
  (filled green circles). Betaine is also transported across the membrane by SNF-3.
  The synthesis of a functional ACR-23 receptor involves several steps, which if inactivated,
  could result in partial or full resistance to monepantel. Such steps involve gene
  expression (circled “1”) and assembly of the receptor (“3”), for example by the
  chaperone RIC-3. In fact, ric-3 mutants are moderately resistant to monepantel.
  Mutations in the ACR-23 protein result in resistance to monepantel (“2”). Additional
  factors could be required for a fully functional ACR-23 receptor (“4”). Blue arrows
  indicate the synthesis pathway of the ACR-23 receptor. “Rm” represents a putative
  additional receptor to monepantel. The representation of the proteins in one single
  membrane tract should not imply that they are expressed in the same cell.
