caption: 'The folate biosynthesis pathway and its compartmentalisation in plants (modified
  from ). p-ABA is synthesized in the plastids, pteridine in the cytosol and both
  are condensed to form THF in the mitochondria. Enzymes: ADCL, Aminodeoxychorismate
  lyase; ADCS, Aminodeoxychorismate synthase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DHFS,
  dihydrofolate synthetase; DHNA, dihydroneopterin aldolase; DHPS, dihydropteroate
  synthase; FPGS, folylpolyglutamate synthase; GTPCHI, GTP cyclohydrolase I; HPPK,
  dihydropterinpyrophosphokinase. Chemicals: ADC, minodeoxychorismate; H2FGlu1, dihydrofolate;
  H2Neopterin, dihydroneopterin; H2Pteroate, dihydropteroate; Glu, glutamate; GTP,
  guanosine triphosphate; H2Pterin, dihydropterin; H2Pterin-PP, hydroxymethyldihydropterin;
  p-ABA, para-aminobenzoate; H4FGlu1, tetrahydrofolate. The transgenic species are
  indicated adjacent to enzymes used in manipulation. Enzymes used in transgenic strategies
  are oval and in the blue background.'
