caption: Figure 1. Antigen presentation pathway by MHC Class II. The MHC II-related
  proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Three MHC Class II αβ
  heterodimers bind to a trimer of invariant chains, thus forming a nonameric complex.
  That complex is directed to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) directly via the trans-Golgi
  network or from the cell surface. In the MVBs, proteases degrade the invariant chain
  until only a small fragment called CLIP remains in the peptide-binding groove. Degradative
  processes in the acidic compartment generate peptides from the material acquired
  through phagocytosis or autophagy. The non-classical MHC Class II HLA-DM and -DO
  dimerize in the ER and localize in MVBs. Free HLA-DM interacts with HLA-DR and mediate
  peptide exchange following the inward budding of the limiting membrane. The peptide-loaded
  MHC Class II can then egress to the cell surface where antigen presentation takes
  place.
