caption: 'Correlation Loading Plots of the Lipids and Transcripts in the O2PLS-DA
  Model.Lipids are denoted as triangles and transcripts as squares. The location of
  each variable on the plot is described by the correlation of its joint variance
  projection with light-specific (x axis) and temperature-specific (y axis) latent
  variables of the O2PLS-DA model. The gradients are from darkness- to high light–specific
  responses (left to right) on the x axis and from cold- to heat-specific responses
  (bottom to top) on the y axis. Each plot shows the distribution of all analyzed
  variables (small gray symbols), but on each of them a different group is highlighted
  by magnified and color-coded symbols.(A) Glycerolipids. The total number of double
  bonds in glycerolipid acyl chains is represented by the color scale from red (six
  double bonds) to blue (no double bonds). Sum changes of the lipid classes are represented
  by green arrows. From all plotted lipids, only those with significant correlation
  (P < 0.01) with one of the latent variables have been plotted.(B) Transcripts of
  the  biosynthesis pathway. Genes belonging to the  biosynthesis pathway are highlighted
  in green. Sum changes of all lipid biochemical pathways are plotted as gray arrows.
  The sum changes of the  biosynthesis pathway are highlighted by a green arrow. The
  abbreviations for the pathways are as follows: Cutin, cutin biosynthesis; EuP, eukaryotic
  phospholipid biosynthesis; FA,  biosynthesis; FA&TAG deg,  and  degradation; FAE&Wax,  elongation
  and wax biosynthesis; LT, lipid trafficking; Oxylipin, oxylipin metabolism; P sig,
  phospholipid signaling; Pro GSP, prokaryotic galactolipid, sulfolipid, and phospholipid
  metabolism; Sph, sphingolipid biosynthesis; Suberin, suberin biosynthesis; TAG synth,  biosynthesis.(C)
  Genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactolipid, sulfolipid, and phospholipid metabolism
  pathways.(D) Genes involved in storage oil metabolism.'
