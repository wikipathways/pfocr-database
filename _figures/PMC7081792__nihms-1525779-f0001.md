caption: 'Following vascular injury, growth factor signaling induces PI3K/AKT signaling
  to activate mTORC1, promoting biosynthetic processes and cell growth, which are
  necessary for proliferation. Through as-of-yet undefined stimuli, injury results
  in increased expression of TEAD1, a transcription factor that acts with the Hippo
  pathway cofactors YAP/TAZ. Cross-talk between these two pathways has previously
  been shown: YAP increases miR-29 expression to repress PTEN, driving AKT/mTORC1
  signaling; mTORC1-mediated repression of autophagy promotes YAP activity; and new
  work from Osman et. al. reveals that TEAD-mediated SLC1A5 expression increases glutamine
  transport and, subsequently, mTORC1 activity. Positive cross-talk between mTORC1
  and YAP/TEAD1 converge to promote SMC proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. AA=
  amino acids; Rap.= Rapamycin.'
