caption: 'Transmission of JAK/STAT and NFκB pathway activation from malignant to non-malignant
  cells. (A) Malignant hematopoietic MPN cells transmit NFκB signaling activation
  to non-malignant cells, according to the hypothesized mechanism described by Kleppe
  et al. () MPN driver mutations produce hyperactive JAK2, leading to overproduction
  of cytokines, including IL-6. IL-6 receptor activation (in non-malignant cells)
  activates JAK2 and STAT3, which are required for maximal non-cell-autonomous NFκB
  activation in non-malignant cells. STAT3 shares multiple target genes with NFκB.
  NFκB mediated transcription requires BET bromeodomain proteins (BRDs) as cofactors,
  and therefore is subject to inhibition by the BRD inhibitor JQ1. (B) Active cytokine
  receptor signaling (such as from MPL or IL-6R) in malignant cells activates JAK2
  and phospho-STATs 3 and 5, which co-activate multiple target genes along with NFκB.
  Among JAK2/STAT3,5 and NFκB co-induced targets are genes encoding several cytokines
  overproduced in MPNs: TNF, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), IL-6, IL-8, IL-1α, and
  IL-1β (, , , , ). IL-6 and IL-8 (bold) can activate JAK2/STAT3,5 signaling in non-mutant
  cells. These cytokines in turn act non-cell-autonomously on the endothelial cells
  of blood vessels (BV), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), and endosteal cells in the
  bone marrow. MSC are sources of SCF and IL-6 and endosteal cells are sources of
  TPO, which can activate JAK2/STAT3,5 signaling non-cell-autonomously (also see ).
  (C) Malignant neutrophils (PMN) in MPNs can produce IL-1α, and IL-1β, while malignant
  monocytes produce IL-6, IL-8, and TNF. TNF, IL-1α, and IL-1β, can activate NFκB
  signaling in endothelial cells of blood vessels (BV), leading them to release SCF
  and IL-6. These cytokines can combine with IL-6 and IL-8 secreted by malignant monocytes
  to produce activated JAK2/STAT3,5 signaling in both malignant and non-malignant
  cells.'
