caption: Fission yeast priRNA pathway. (A) Bidirectional transcription from pericentromeric
  repeat sequences produces products that are processed into fragments, possibly through
  RNA degradation or other unknown mechanism. priRNA (primal RNA) precursor are bound
  by Ago1 and trimmed on the 3′ end by an exonuclease Triman. The loaded Ago1 with
  priRNA can find the nascent transcription by RNA Polymerase II in the chromatin,
  and recruits RNA-dependent polymerase complex (RDRC) containing Rdp1, Hrr1, and
  Cid12. Dicer cleaves the dsRNA to form siRNA. The siRNA can be loaded to Ago1 that
  continues the positive feedback cycle. The mature Ago1–siRNA complex recruits factors
  required for nucleation and spreading of heterochromatin to form pericentromeric
  heterochromatin. (B) priRNAs from mRNAs. In wild-type yeast, the exosome degrades
  RNA fragments. However, in mutants of exosome components, the priRNA pathway can
  operate more actively on mRNAs due to the lack of competition with the exosome.
