caption: The relationship between gut microbiota and colonic inflammation in inflammatory
  bowel disease. Inflammation in colon stimulates production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ)
  that eventually generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS make products for anaerobic
  respiration. These products can be used by facultative anaerobes to outgrow, which
  leads to decreased bacterial diversity. The dysbiotic microbiota may further stimulate
  the growth of fungi that can worsen inflammation via chitin and β -glucan antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) activation of the type 1 T helper (TH1) pathway. In addition, the microbial
  dysbiosis is associated with increased bacteriophage richness and abundance, which
  can affect the bacterial microbiota via gene transfer. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
  TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide. [Adapted with permission []].
