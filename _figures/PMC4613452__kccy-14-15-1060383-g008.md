caption: Proposed schematic illustration of the mechanism by which ACh exerts its
  endothelial protective effects against H/R injury in the present study. (1) H/R
  induces ER stress in endothelial cell; (2) H/R upregulates the expression of CHOP
  and cleaved caspase-12 as well as TUNEL positive HUVECs; (3) ACh activates M3 AChR
  to elicit its endothelial protection; (4) ACh enhances AMPK phosphorylation, thereby
  inhibits pro-apoptotic cascades; (5) ACh decreases ER stress and apoptosis during
  H/R in endothelial cells, presumably by M3 AChR signaling pathway. ACh, acetylcholine;
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; CHOP,
  C/EBP homologous protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein
  78; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; IRE1, inositol-requiring kinase 1; M3 AChR, type-3
  muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; PERK, protein kinase-like ER kinase; TUNEL, terminal
  deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling; 4-DAMP, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine
  methiodide; 4-PBA, 4-phenyl butyric acid.
