caption: Metabolic pathways of 1,25(OH)2D and 27HC synthesis. Vitamin D is converted
  to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) by the cytochrome P450s CYP2R1 and, to a lesser extent,
  CYP27A1 in the liver. 25OHD is the primary metabolite of vitamin D found in the
  circulation and is clinically used as the best indicator of vitamin D status. 25OHD
  can be 1-α-hydroxylated by CYP27B1 to form 1,25(OH)2D in the kidney as part of maintaining
  blood mineral homeostasis, or locally in many tissues, including breast cancer cells.
  1,25(OH)2D acts as an anti-cancer agent via regulation of multiple pathways associated
  with cancer growth and progression. One such pathway may be that of cholesterol
  metabolism into 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), a selective estrogen receptor modulator
  that promotes ER+ breast cancer growth and metastasis. 1,25(OH)2 inhibits its synthesizing
  enzyme, CYP27B1, and we hypothesize that 1,25(OH)2D may also inhibit CYP27A1 (*),
  the synthesizing enzyme of 27HC, which is similar in structure and function to CYP27B1
