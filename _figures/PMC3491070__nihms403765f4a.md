caption: A. SDH and FH can genetically behave as tumor suppressors in specific cancers.
  The accumulation of succinate or fumarate that arises owing to inactivating mutations
  in SDH or FH potentiates aberrant stabilization of HIF1 through competitive inhibition
  of PHDs. IDH mutants arise in a fraction of gliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, and
  chondrosarcomas. These mutants acquire a neomorphic enzymatic activity that enables
  the conversion of αKG to 2HG, which can impair normal epigenetic regulation through
  competitive inhibition of various αKG-dependent dioxygenases, including TET2 DNA
  hydroxylases and JmjC histone demethylases. Recent evidence suggests that 2HG can
  also promote HIF1 degradation, and that both succinate and fumarate accumulation
  may also inhibit various αKG-dependent dioxygenases. Further investigation into
  the pathophysiological role of 2HG may reveal a context-dependence to its functional
  role.SDH – succinate dehydrogenase. FH – fumarate hydratase. HIF – hypoxia-inducible
  factor. PHD – prolyl hydroxylase. αKG – α – ketoglutarate. 2HG – 2-hydroxyglutarate.B.
  PHGDH is elevated in a fraction of malignant breast and melanoma cells. This elevation
  promotes flux of glucose into the serine biosynthesis pathway. Suppression of PHGDH
  in those cell lines that had elevated expression of the enzyme caused a strong decrease
  in cell proliferation and serine synthesis. Moreover, it was revealed that the serine
  pathway was responsible for nearly 50% of the net conversion of glutamate to αKG
  for glutamine-driven anaplerosis in these PHGDH-overexpressing cells. GLDC is overexpressed
  in the TIC population of NSCLC cells. Suppression of GLDC effectively reduced proliferation
  in the TICs. Among the alterations driven by enhanced GLDC expression in these cells
  was an increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis, which made these cells particularly
  sensitive to treatment with low doses of the antimetabolite methotrexate.PHGDH –
  3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. GLDC – glycine decarboxylase. NSCLC – non-small
  cell lung cancer. TIC – tumor-initiating cell.
