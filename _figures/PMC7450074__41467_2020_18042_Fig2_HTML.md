caption: Retinoid chemical structures (a) and RA signaling pathway (b). Blood-circulating
  retinol is internalized through membrane transporter and receptor stimulated by
  retinoic acid 6 (STRA6) and converted into all-trans retinoic acid (RA), which binds
  to cellular retinoic acid-binding protein type 2 for signaling in the nucleus. RA
  triggers gene transcription by binding to RA receptors (RAR) and to the retinoid
  X receptor (RXR). In the presence of the ligand, RAR and RXR heterodimerize on retinoic
  acid-response element (RARE) sequences located in promoter regions inducing the
  transcription of target genes. Of note, RXR may also homodimerize and trigger gene
  transcription (not depicted in the illustration). RA signaling may also occur via
  activation of receptors associated with lipid rafts located on the cell surface,
  which trigger transcriptional activation of target genes by histone and receptor
  phosphorylation in the cell nucleus. ADH alcohol dehydrogenase, CRBP cellular retinol-binding
  protein 1, CYP26 cytochrome P450 family 26, Gαq Gq protein alpha subunit, MAPK mitogen
  activated protein kinases, P phosphorylation, RALDH retinaldehyde dehydrogenase,
  RBP4 retinol-binding protein 4, RDH retinol dehydrogenase.
