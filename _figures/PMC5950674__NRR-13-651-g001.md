caption: Schematic diagram showing the effects of the Kir4.1 dysfunction on neuronal
  excitability and astrocytic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression.Dysfunction
  (e.g., gene mutation, reduced expression and pharmacological blockade) of Kir4.1
  channels increases the extracellular K+ and glutamate levels and elevates neural
  excitability. Kir4.1 dysfunction also activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway
  and enhances BDNF expression in astrocytes, facilitating neural sprouting, synaptogenesis,
  neurogenesis and reactive gliosis. Through these influences, Kir4.1-containnng channels
  seem to play crucial roles in modulating the development of central nervous system
  disorders such as epilepsy and mood disorders (e.g., major depression).
