caption: 'Internal cues and the mating-pheromone-response pathway converge on the
  activation of Cdc42. (A) The proximal and distal poles of a daughter cell are specified
  relative to the position of the mother cell. For budding, axial-budding cells utilize
  the protein Axl2, the axial landmark, which is positioned in every cell cycle adjacent
  to the last division site (the proximal pole in daughter cells) by the action of
  Bud3, Bud4, and Axl1. Bipolar budding cells use distal-pole Bud8 and proximal-pole
  Bud9 to choose the budding site. The Rax1-Rax2 complex participates in the localization
  of both Bud8 and Bud9. (B) In late G1, Axl2, Bud8, or Bud9 (depending on cell type
  and condition) can recruit Bud5, which activates Rsr1, which then brings Cdc24,
  the Cdc42 GEF, to the membrane to generate a concentrated pool of active Cdc42-GTP.
  During mating in MATa cells, α-factor binds to its receptor Ste2, and the activated
  receptor dissociates the G-protein trimer into Gα (not illustrated) and Gβ/Ste4.
  Ste4 recruits the scaffold protein Ste5 (not illustrated) and the adaptor protein
  Far1 in complex with Cdc24 to the side of the membrane exposed to the higher concentration
  of α-factor. As in budding, Cdc24 locally activates Cdc42. (C) Definition of the
  three angles measured in our studies: θ, the angle of alignment; ϕ, the neck angle;
  and ω, the angle to the proximal pole.'
