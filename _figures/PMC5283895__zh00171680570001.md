caption: Enhancement of the eNOS-mediated vascular signaling by H2S. On the level
  of direct biochemical interactions, H2S reacts with NO to produce biologically active
  S/N species (arrow 1). In addition, H2S has the capacity to release NO from stable
  and semi-stable “NO storage pools” (e.g., nitrite, nitrosothiols, peroxynitrite)
  (arrow 2). In addition, H2S can stimulate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in endothelial
  cells (arrow 3), which stimulates eNOS via the calcium-calmodulin system. Importantly,
  H2S can activate the PI3K pathway by either by sulfhydrative inactivation of PTEN
  (arrow 4) or by sulfhydrative inactivation of PTP1B (arrow 5). These processes lead
  to the enhancement of the PI3K pathway, culminating in the elevation of intracellular
  PIP3 levels. PIP3, in turn, activates Akt, which, then, acts on various downstream
  kinases and phosphatases (not shown). The end-result is the phosphorylation on an
  activating serine of eNOS (Ser1177). Calcium mobilization and Akt activation both
  stimulate eNOS, resulting in increased eNOS-dependent endothelial NO production
  upon eNOS-stimulating factors, e.g., binding of various calcium-mobilizing hormones
  acetylcholine or VEGF to their receptors on the endothelial cell membrane (not shown).
  H2S also induce a direct posttranslational modification of eNOS via sulfhydration
  on Cys443 (arrow 6). This action, in turn, further activates and stabilizes eNOS
  by promoting its dimerization. There is also some evidence that in some experimental
  systems H2S can stimulate the expression of eNOS mRNA (arrow 7), putatively increasing
  eNOS protein levels. Further downstream, NO produced by eNOS binds to soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC), and induces the formation of cGMP. In endothelial cells, in the context
  of endothelial cell proliferation and migration, the sGC target of NO is in the
  endothelial cell itself. In the context of the endothelium-dependent relaxation,
  NO diffuses from the endothelial cell to the underlying vascular smooth muscle cell,
  where it binds to its sGC target in the vascular smooth muscle cytosol. (The endothelial
  cell and the smooth muscle cell sGC targets are not separated in the current scheme).
  H2S stimulates the sGC/cGMP pathway via several distinct mechanisms. As a reducing
  agent, H2S can induce the stabilization of sGC in its reduced, NO-responsive form
  (arrow 8). H2S can also react with cGMP to form 8-SH-cGMP (arrow 9), which is biologically
  active and less sensitive to enzymatic degradation by PDE5. In addition, H2S, by
  inhibiting PDE5 (arrow 10), suppresses the degradation of cGMP, thereby ensuring
  that the cGMP levels remain high for a longer period of time, thereby enhancing
  the activation of its downstream protein kinase, PKG. Finally, the degradation of
  H2S to intracellular polysulfides can induce the oxidative activation of PKG (arrow
  11). These processes culminate in the prototypical vascular biological responses
  induced by both NO and H2S such as angiogenesis and vasorelaxation. Depending on
  the biological context, H2S may also stimulate vascular responses via pathways that
  do not involve the eNOS pathway (arrow 12).
