caption: Targeting proteins in the crosstalk between TAMs and tumor cells. (A) In
  tumor cells, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1) is activated
  by TAMs derived IL-6, then phosphorylates phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) to promote
  proliferation by pyruvate generation. TAM-derived IL-6 and IL-10 activate the JAK2/STAT3
  cascade, then upregulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), SNHG17 and DUXAP8, to promote
  proliferation, while the S3I-201 and Tyr1022 could inhibit α5β1 integrin and MMP2,
  respectively, to inhibit this process. Similarly, TAM-derived CCL18 could activate
  the Akt signal, then prolong the S phase and reduce the G1 phase of cell cycle,
  and promote the expression of Raf and Lin28. LY294002 and Let-7a could inhibit the
  activity of the Akt cascade. (B) Grow factors and cytokines, such as transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β), combine with their reporters in tumor cells, then activate
  the downstream effector, including cAMP and ROS, to promote the invasion and metastasis
  of tumor cells. The application of inhibitors, such as LY2109761, could block the
  invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. (C) Angiogenesis is regulated by several
  major signals, such as the PTEN/PI3K/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  signaling pathways, and the TAM-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  is also involved in this process. Bevacizumab, sorafenib, and sunitinib can neutralize
  VEGFR and VEGFR2 in tumor cells. The PTEN and beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) in
  tumor cells inhibit lysyl oxidase (LOX) dependent β1-integrin expression. Rapamycin
  (RAPA), Apigenine, and PF4691502 could block the mTOR signaling pathway to attenuate
  angiogenesis. (D) The cancer stemness would be mediated by LSECtin and the activity
  of β-Catenin/Akt pathway, while the β-Catenin/Akt pathway exhibits with a paradoxical
  role in the stemness of tumor cells. The IGF1 and CCL2 could bind with their receptors
  on tumor cells and then activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to acquire the resistance
  of BLZ945 and Tamoxifen. Moreover, the metabolite of bevacizumab could interact
  with the Fc γ receptor to induce the production of TNF-α and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  1 (IDO1) by interacting with TLR4 to acquire the resistance of bevacizumab. The
  bindarit would inhibit CCL2 to attenuate the generation of drug resistance.
