caption: Model for the action of RRG-1 in Neurospora. A possible mechanism that incorporates
  our experimental results is presented. The response regulator RRG-1 operates downstream
  of the hybrid histidine kinase NIK-1/OS-1 (and perhaps others) and the histidine
  phosphotransfer protein HPT-1. It is also possible that RRG-1 is controlled by as
  yet unknown signaling proteins. The phenotypes of strains carrying the predicted
  nonphosphorylatable allele D921N suggest that RRG-1 activity can be regulated independently
  of phosphorylation in some instances. RRG-1 regulates the OS-4(MAPKKK)/ OS-5(MAPKK)/OS-2(MAPK)
  cascade to control osmotic and fungicide sensitivity and protoperithecial development.
  Production of POI-2, a protein required for protoperithecial development, is regulated
  by RRG-1 and the OS-2 MAPK pathway. The observation that nik-1/os-1 mutants are
  able to produce protoperithecia and the POI-2 protein under nitrogen starvation
  suggests that other histidine kinases may contribute to regulation of RRG-1 and
  the OS-2 MAPK pathway during protoperithecial development. Other inputs may influence
  female fertility through the OS-2 MAPK cascade and the MAK-2 MAPK pathway has been
  previously shown to control protoperithecial development and POI-2 levels.
