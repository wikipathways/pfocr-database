caption: The unique energy demands of axons and nerve terminals, particularly those
  of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, are dependent on proper mitochondrial
  distribution and function. At the terminus, mitochondria are critical for calcium
  buffering and energy for maintaining the vesicular pool. Environmental and genetic
  factors may contribute to increased mitochondrial and oxidative stress, impacting
  mitochondrial function, fission and fusion, transport, and perhaps even mitochondrial
  maintenance systems (red connectors). The dopaminergic neurons of the substantia
  nigra are known to have increased oxidative stress, due in part to the oxidative
  nature of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). Mitochondrial dysfunction also has
  the potential to set up a vicious cycle of increased oxidative stress, through production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased energy availability (red arrows).
  B. Altered or disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, which may result in an accumulation
  of damaged mitochondria or decreased distribution of healthy mitochondria at the
  nerve terminal and within the axon, may ultimately lead to stress and terminal loss,
  propagating back to the cell body.
