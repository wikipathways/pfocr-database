caption: Comparison of 13C-based flux values to those calculated from FBA with or
  without grouping reaction constraints in wild-type E. coli and pykF knockout mutant
  strains on glucose minimal medium under aerobic conditions and flux distribution
  changes for pykF knockout in E. coli central metabolism. The color gradient and
  squares indicate the values of Vavg. The red lines indicate that the fluxes show
  the increment determined by flux bias (Vavg), compared with control fluxes, which
  were from E. coli wild type aerobically grown in glucose minimal medium. The blue
  lines indicate the opposite. Thickness of the lines denotes flux capacities (lsol)
  after environmental perturbation, compared with control fluxes; three types of thickness
  were used to indicate the changes in flux capacity. The thickest line indicates
  the increased flux capacity, the thinnest line the decreased flux capacity, and
  the medium thickness refers to no changes in flux capacity. Each graph represents
  the 13C-based fluxes and solution spaces of each flux predicted with or without
  grouping reaction constraints for wild type and pykF mutant. The y axis in each
  graph indicates the relative flux (%) that is normalized to the carbon source uptake
  rate. The 13C-based fluxes are represented in (I) wild type and (II) pykF mutant.
  The fluxes predicted by FBA without grouping reaction constraints are represented
  in (III) wild type and (IV) pykF mutant. The fluxes predicted by FBA with grouping
  reaction constraints are represented in (V) wild type and (VI) pykF mutant. The
  bars in each embedded graph denote the range between the maximal and minimal values
  of each reaction computed from FVA. The graph for succinyl-CoA synthetase is not
  shown because its flux values were outside the range of biologically feasible values
  in the case of FBA without grouping reaction constraints. In the case of reversible
  reactions, the fluxes corresponding to the direction represented in the pathway
  were considered. The 13C-based fluxes were evaluated with 90% confidence limits
  obtained from statistical analysis ().
