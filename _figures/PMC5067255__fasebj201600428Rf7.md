caption: Proposed model for the profibrotic regulation of GLUT1 expression by TGF-β.
  This model incorporates the cooperative action of multiple signaling pathways in
  regulating GLUT1 induction by TGF-β and their subsequent integration in profibrotic
  TGF-β signaling. Engagement of the TGF-β receptor complex activates the canonical
  Smad pathway, which leads to up-regulation of PDGFR ligands. Subsequent PDGFR phosphorylation
  promotes activation of MEK/ERK and induction of ErbB ligand expression and cognate
  receptor activation (, ). Activation of the MEK/ERK and mTORC2 pathways downstream
  of PI3K promotes up-regulation of GLUT1, whose activity is necessary for the profibrotic
  effects of TGF-β. The Smad-dependent pathways (PDGFR, ErbB, and GLUT1), in concert
  with the noncanonical TGF-β–activated signaling modules, p21-activated kinase 2
  (PAK2)/cAbl and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (–, , ), all contribute to the fibrogenic program
  directed by TGF-β.
