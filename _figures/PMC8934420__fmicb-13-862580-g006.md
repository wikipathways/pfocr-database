caption: Proposed model for miR-103a-3p regulates ZIKV replication. In response to
  ZIKV infection, p38 MAPK is activated as shown by increased phosphorylated of HSP27
  which facilitates ZIKV replication. Suppressed activity of p38 MAPK by SB203580
  inhibits ZIKV replication. ZIKV infection also induces miR-103a-3p expression, which
  targets OTUD4 to regulate p38 MAPK signaling pathway to stimulate ZIKV replication.
  MiR-103a-3p is one of the host genes exploited by ZIKV to benefit its replication
  and targeting this gene or the p38 MAPK signaling pathway may be a potential novel
  strategy to treat ZIKV infection.
