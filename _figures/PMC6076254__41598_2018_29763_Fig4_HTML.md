caption: 'Metabolic mapping. Analysis of several metabolic pathways using HumanCyc:
  Encyclopedia of human genes and metabolism. Each enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway
  is depicted as a square. Changes in transcription levels are color-coded: red indicates
  an activated gene (P < 0.05), purple indicates a deactivated gene (P < 0.05) and
  grey indicates no significant change. Asterisks indicate the (predicted) rate limiting
  or rate regulating steps of the metabolic pathway. (A) Activity of the main ATP
  producing pathways in cells (B) cholesterol synthesis and lipogenesis.'
