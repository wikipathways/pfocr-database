caption: Both canonical and non-canonical pathways resulting in NFkappaB activation
  are shown. The former results from stimulation by cytokines, such as tumor necrosis
  factor alpha (TNFalpha), leading to phosphorylation of the beta subunit of inhibitor
  of kappa B kinase (IKK), which in addition to an alpha subunit contains a regulatory
  subunit, NEMO (NFkappaB essential modifier). Subsequent phosphorylation of IkappaB
  by IKKbeta leads to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of IkappaB, releasing
  the p50-RelA heterodimer, an NFkappaB family member, which translocates to the nucleus
  to activate the transcription of target genes. In the non-canonical pathway activation
  results from a different set of receptors, such as CD40 (shown here) and B-cell
  activating factor (BAFF), causing activation of NFkappaB-inducing kinase (NIK),
  which forms a complex with IKKalpha, p100, p52, and RelB. IKKalpha phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of p100 frees the p52-RelB dimer, another
  NFkappaB family member, to enter the nucleus to activate its own set of target genes.
