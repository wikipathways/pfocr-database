caption: A2A and NO signaling pathway regulate the expression of VEGF in normal and
  late-onset pre-eclampsia. In human feto-placental endothelium from normal pregnancy,
  activation of A2A adenosine receptor triggers an intracellular pathway involved
  increased generation of cAMP, activation (serine1175 phosphorylation) of nitric
  oxide synthase (eNOS), and generation of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine. Nitric
  oxide increases mRNA levels of VEGF via unknown (?) mechanism(s), which may include
  protein nitration. This A2A-NO-VEGF pathway can lead to a pro-angiogenic behavior
  of feto-placental endothelium, since it can stimulate cell proliferation/migration
  and tube formation. In LOPE, this A2A-mediated intracellular pathway is elevated
  (⇪), in particular eNOS activation, NO synthesis, and VEGF expression. Upregulation
  of A2A-NO-VEGF pathway observed in LOPE may constitute a compensatory mechanism
  to hypoxia in the placenta
