caption: The role of PVT1 in the digestive system []. A PVT1 promotes the expression
  of MKL1 by targeting miR-3619-5p. B PVT1 promotes the expression of YAP1 by targeting
  miR-186-5p. C PVT1 promotes the expression of HIG2 by targeting miR-150. D PVT1
  promotes the expression of INCENP by targeting miR-424-5p. E PVT1 promotes the expression
  of ATG3 by targeting miR-365. F PVT1 can decrease the phosphorylation of STAT1 and
  finally leads to the tolerance of IFN-α therapy. G PVT1 promotes the expression
  of SEMA4D by targeting miR-186. H PVT1 downregulates its expression by recruiting
  EZH2 to the ANGPTL4 promoter region. I PVT1 downregulates miR-18b-5p expression
  by binding to EZH2 and promotes HIF1A expression. J PVT1 promotes the expression
  of HK2 by targeting miR-143. K PVT1 directly binds to miR-30d-5p. (L) PVT1 promotes
  the expression of SERBP1 by targeting miR-448. M PVT1 promotes the expression of
  HIF-1A by targeting miR-519d-3p. N PVT1 promotes the expression of ULK1 by targeting
  miR-20a-5p. O PVT1 enhances gemcitabine resistance of PDAC by increasing c-Myc expression.
  P PVT1 enhances gemcitabine resistance of PC by inhibiting miR-1207 expression.
  Q PVT1 promotes the SHH/GLI/MGMT signal pathway by targeting miR-409. R PVT1 upregulates
  Pygo2 by targeting miR-619-5p and ultimately activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  resulting in PC resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy. S PVT1 promotes the HIF-1α/VMP1
  signaling pathway by targeting miR-143, resulting in PC resistance to gemcitabine
  chemotherapy
