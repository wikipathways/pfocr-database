caption: 'Altered metabolic pathways in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Mapped
  metabolites are based on their KEGG IDs to classify their involvement in different
  pathways. Red and blue nodes indicate altered metabolites in the study and pink
  nodes represent metabolites involved in the pathway that were not investigated in
  the study. Red color codes represent decreased metabolite, while blue increased
  metabolite concentrations in SCLC compared to healthy controls. BCCA: Branched-chain
  amino acid, TCA: tricarboxylic acid. (For interpretation of the references to color
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
