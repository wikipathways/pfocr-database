caption: Apoptosis Signalling network. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated
  upon ligand binding to death receptors (TNFR1, Fas/CD95, DR4/5). This results in
  activation of a caspase cascade and eventually cleavage of both cytoplasmic and
  nuclear substrates. TNFR1 may promote survival signalling through activation of
  NFκB. The intrinsic pathway involves release of apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria,
  formation of the apoptosome and subsequently caspase activation. Members of the
  BCL-2 protein family are involved in regulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  The extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways converge in a caspase cascade that results
  in cellular shrinkage, DNA fragmentation and eventually apoptosis. These pathways
  are highly deregulated in GBMs. Tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), Tumour necrosis
  related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNFR type 1-associated death domain protein
  (TRADD), Death receptor (DR), Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), TNFR
  associated factor (TRAF), Receptor interacting protein (RIP), FLICE-like inhibitory
  protein (FLIP), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFκB), Inhibitor of κB (IκB), IκB kinases (IKKs), cytochrome
  c (Cyt c), Apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1).

  description: Apoptosis Signalling network. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated

    Members of the BCL-2 protein family are involved in regulation of the intrinsic
