caption: Proposed mechanism to explain the downregulation of miR-1 and miR-133a by
  insulin in human skeletal muscle. Insulin activates the translocation of SREBP-1c
  (BHLH) active form from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus and, concomittantly,
  induces SREPB-1c expression via the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
  pathway (). SREBP-1c mediates MEF2C downregulation () through a mechanism that remains
  to be determined. As a consequence of lower MEF2C binding on their enhancer region,
  the transcription of miR-1 and miR-133a is reduced, leading to decreased levels
  of their mature forms in muscle, after insulin treatment. Altered activation of
  PI 3-kinase and SREBP-1c may explain the defective regulation of miR-1 and miR-133a
  expression in response to insulin in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients ().
