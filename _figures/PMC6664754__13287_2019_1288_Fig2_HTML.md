caption: Proposed model of the Lgr5-mediated stimulation of cancer growth through
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. R-spondin activates Leucine-rich
  repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5). Once activated, Lgr5 protein
  recruits LRP-frizzled receptor complex, which binds to Wnt ligands, reinforcing
  Wnt signaling following phosphorylation of LRP5/6. A series of steps ensue, including
  the accumulation of β-catenin, which is translocated to the nucleus, inducing the
  expression of various Wnt target genes (such as C-myc, Cyclin D1, Lgr5) after binding
  together with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, which leads to tumor
  progression through stimulation of cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition
  (EMT), and stemness maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). TCF, T cell-factor;
  LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor
