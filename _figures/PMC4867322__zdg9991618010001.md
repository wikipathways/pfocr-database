caption: 'Schematic representation of the Hippo signal transduction network and its
  links to exercise-associated signals and signalling modules. A: MST1, MST2, LATS1,
  and LATS2 form the core kinase cassette of the Hippo pathway. SAV1 and MOB1 act
  as scaffolding proteins. The MAP4K 4, 6, and 7 kinase isoforms can independently
  regulate LATS1/2 (, , ). Active LATS1 and LATS2 inhibits YAP and TAZ through the
  phosphorylation of multiple HXRXXS motifs (where “S” within HXRXXS indicates the
  phosphorylated serine) (). Phosphorylation of YAP on serine127 generates a binding
  site for 14-3-3 proteins, which sequester YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation
  of serine381 results in the ubiquitination and degradation of YAP (). Similar regulatory
  events also affect TAZ. B: the classical model stipulates that active unphosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ are nuclear and coactivate the TEAD transcription factors, whereas VGLL4
  acts as a repressor. YAP/TAZ-TEAD complexes bind the CATTCC/GGAATG (MCAT or GTIIC)
  motifs found especially in enhancers that loop to the promoters of genes even though
  they are located several base pairs away from the promoter itself [see () and the
  text for more information]. C: resistance (strength) exercise and muscle growth-associated
  signals that are linked to YAP/TAZ (see text for more information). D: endurance
  exercise-associated signals that are linked to YAP/TAZ (see text for more information).'
