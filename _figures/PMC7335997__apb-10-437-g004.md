caption: Analyzing Camk4 gene expression in PC12 cells revealed an astonishing expression
  pattern (). After 12 hours, a substantial increase was seen in the βBA-treated PC12
  cells compared with the untreated controls. A significant decline was observed after
  24 hours, which was followed by a rise up to the Camk4 expression level in untreated
  cells after 48 hours, which then approximately remained unchanged until 72 hours.
  This pattern of expression might indicate the involvement of some negative/positive
  auto-regulatory mechanisms in Camk4 gene expression (). As  illustrates, CaMKIV
  operates in a signal transduction cascade and regulates the activity of some transcription
  activators such as CRE-binding protein 1 (CREB1); on the other hand, its function
  is controlled by other upstream regulatory proteins. It directly phosphorylates
  CREB1, a critical transcription factor that is involved in many aspects of the nervous
  system function, such as synaptic plasticity and consolidation of certain forms
  of memory. Phosphorylated-CREB1- forming homodimers/heterodimers bind to the conserved
  AMP-response elements and regulate the expression of target genes in the hippocampus.,
  One of the important target genes of phosphorylated-CREB1is the brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (Bdnf ). Binding of phosphorylated-CREB1 to the Bdnf promoter leads to expression
  and production of BDNF., These BDNF molecules release to the synaptic cleft where
  they bind to the cell-surface receptors, mainly to the tropomyosin-related kinase
  B (TrkB), and promote TrkB dimerization and autophosphorylation leading to the activation
  of the three downstream signaling cascades i.e. PLC/IP3/CaMKIV, Ras/MEK/ERK and
  PI3K/AKT cascades.- For activation of the PLC/IP3/CaMKIV axis, autophosphorylation
  of TrkB at the Y816 residue allows recruitment of phospholipase C (PLC) which then
  activates the CaMKIV/CREB signaling pathway., Phosphorylation and activation of
  CREB1 in this pathway leads to the BDNF expression promoting another cycle of the
  BDNF-CaMKIV-CREB-BDNF activation loop ().
