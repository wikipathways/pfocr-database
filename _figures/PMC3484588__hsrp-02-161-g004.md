caption: The cellular affects of TNFα.Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) is produced
  by macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocyte. TNFα binds the TNF receptors
  (TNF-R/CD120a/CD120b). There are 2 types of TNF-R;- TNF-R type 1 (CD120a) - present
  on all cells and binds TNFα only - TNF-R type 2 (CD120b) - present on immune cells
  and binds both TNFα and TNFβStimulation of the TNF receptors results in receptor
  trimerisation and activation of downstream proteins. The effect of TNFα on any cell
  depends on myriad co-stimuli.- CD40 co-stimulus results in FADD pathway activation;-
  The caspase family of enzymes cleave cellular DNA- Bid binds to inserts pores into
  the mitochondrial membrane, causing leakage of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c binds
  APAF-1 to activate the caspase family and cause cellular DNA degradation- TRAF2-ASK1
  pathway activation results in AP-1 production, which binds DNA to regulate the production
  of many proteins - TRAF2-RIP pathway activation results in NF- κβ production, which
  binds DNA primer sequences and stimulates mRNA, therefore protein production and
  a change in cell functionAPAF-1 = Activating Protease Apoptotic Factor-1, AP-1 =
  Activator Protein 1
