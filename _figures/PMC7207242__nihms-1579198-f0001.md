caption: Activation of complement cascade by the classical, lectin and alternative
  pathway leads to the formation of membrane attack complexes (MAC). Viruses use specific
  mechanisms to evade hosts complement mediated destruction. Some viruses express
  structural and functional homologs of hosts complement regulatory proteins. These
  homologs mimic the role of host complement regulators. Another mechanism of viral
  evasion is by recruitment of host complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) into
  their virions.
