caption: Three widely used anticancer drug mediated cytotoxicity in cancer and heart.
  Clinically used targeted therapies/tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors mainly focuses
  on inactivation of heregulin receptor (HER2) or vascular endothelial factor (VEGF)
  signaling in cancers. HER2 signaling is important in heart and cancer. HER2 activation
  by its ligand heregulin stimulates proliferation pathway in the tumor cells. The
  inhibition of HER2 by its antibody, trastuzumab, in cancer cells blocks the cancer
  proliferation but in heart it blocks an important survival pathway in heart. Binding
  of VEGF to its receptors in endothelial cells activates angiogenesis. Inhibition
  of VEGF by its antibody, bevacizumab, can destroy the tumor angiogenesis and bring
  the tumor to avascular stage, whereas it can be detrimental in the heart due to
  reduced systemic angiogenesis. Indeed, the immunotherapy targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
  antigen 4 (CTLA-4). anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or its receptor (PDL-1) relies
  on cancer destruction through the activation of the host immune system. However,
  PD-L1 is also expressed in the non-immune cells to maintain self-tolerance. Nivolumab
  and Ipilimumab activate T cells and promotes T cell clonal expansion to kill tumor
  cells. However activated T cells also recognize shared antigens and destroy cardiomyocytes
  as well.
