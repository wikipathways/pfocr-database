caption: Molecular mechanisms of amino acid trafficking. Amino acids, especially BCAAs,
  enter the cell via their respective transporters. Once in the cell, depending on
  metabolic need, they can be metabolized for energy or used for other biochemical
  processes like protein synthesis. If needed for energy, the enzyme BCAT metabolizes
  the BCAA into branched-chain keto acids, which undergo a series of catabolic reactions
  to produce C3 and C5 CoAs by BCKDH. The C3/5 CoAs are then converted to either acetyl
  CoA or Succinyl CoA and can enter the TCA cycle. BCKDH is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  by the kinase BDK and the phosphatase PPM1K, respectively. Phosphorylation of BCKDH
  by BDK inhibits BCKDH activity while dephosphorylation by PPM1K activates BCKDH
  and increases generation of BCAA-derived CoAs for energy production. The activation
  of the BCAT/BCKDH pathway pulls amino acids away from the associated mTORC1 complexes
  and inhibits protein synthesis. If BDK is able to phosphorylate BCKDH, or PPM1K
  is inhibited, amino acids would be available to active mTORC1 and initiate protein
  translation. AMPK can regulate BCAA metabolism by increasing PPM1K and lowering
  BDK expression, which will activate BCKDH and increase BCAA flux to the TCA cycle.
  AMPK can simultaneously block mTORC1 signaling through activation of TSC1/2 or direct
  inhibition of mTOR and raptor.
