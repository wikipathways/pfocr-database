caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of differentially expressed alternative
  splicing (DEAS) events. (A) PPI network of DEAS events identified by Cytoscape.
  Genes with DEAS events were represented by nodes. The AS type, change patterns,
  and |log2FC| were denoted as the shape, color and size of nodes, respectively. Potential
  interactions between the corresponding proteins were indicated by edges. (B) Top
  10 genes ranked by degree. (C) KEGG analysis of the corresponding proteins potentially
  participating in the PPI network. The larger nodes represented KEGG signaling pathway
  and the smaller nodes represented pathway-related enriched genes.
