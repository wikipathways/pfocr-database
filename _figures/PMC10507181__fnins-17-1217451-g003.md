caption: Glutamate and GABA metabolism. (A) Astrocytes regulate glutamate in the brain
  through glutamate transporters (GLTs). After being transported in astrocytes, glutamate
  undergoes the glutamine synthase pathway to produce glutamine or the TCA cycle to
  generate ATP. (B) The glutamate synthesis pathway in neurons. Glutamine in neurons
  is transported from astrocytes and is deaminized to generate glutamate by glutaminase.
  (C) GABA synthesis in neurons. Glutamine in neurons for GABA synthesis is transported
  from astrocytes or synthesized from glutamate, which is released from the excitatory
  synapse. Glutamine is then converted to GABA through phosphate-activated glutaminase
  (PAG). GS, glutamine synthetase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GABAT, GABA transaminase;
  GAT1, GABA transporter 1; SSA, succinyl semialdehyde; SSADH, semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
