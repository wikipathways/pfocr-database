caption: This cartoon summarizes the proteins in the mTOR pathway that have been shown
  to be important in photoreceptor survival. Upon growth factor or insulin binding,
  PI3K (phosphosinositide 3-kinase) promotes AKT activation, which by inhibiting the
  inhibitor TSC1/2 (tuberous sclerosis complex protein 1/2) complex, activates mTORC1
  (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and stimulates eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1
  (S6K1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). S6K1 and HIF-1α increase
  glycolytic machinery and aerobic glycolysis,. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) also inhibits HIF-1α.
  PTEN (phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome ten) inhibits PI3K-mediated
  activation of AKT, which also directly regulates key glycolytic machinery, or controls
  transcription factors that promote the expression aerobic glycolysis components.
  The nutrient sensor adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) decreases
  mTOR signaling by activating TSC1/2 and inhibiting mTORC1 and activates PGC-1α (PPARγ
  coactivator proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha), to promote
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial health in conjunction with
  PPARγ. Genes mutated or deleted from PRs involved in this pathway are detailed in
  red (PTEN, PI3K, SIRT6, TSC1, and PGC-1α) with their associated retinal phenotypes
  nearby in red if neurodegenerative and green if neuroprotective. These specific
  mutations and references are detailed in Table .
