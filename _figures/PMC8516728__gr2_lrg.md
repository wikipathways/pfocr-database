caption: Activation of NF-κB pathway and its cross-talk with cell signalling pathways
  in cytokine storm. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor serves as a binding
  and entry site for SARS-CoV-2. Upon binding, SARS-CoV-2 activates the serine protease
  TMPRSS2, allowing viral access into the host cell through endocytosis. While inside
  the endosomes, single-stranded viral RNA activates the two toll-like receptors (TLR),
  including TLR7 and TLR8. As the double-stranded RNA starts to accumulate due to
  the viral replication, it gets quickly identified by TLR3, resulting in the activation
  of TLR7/8 and TLR3. Activation of these receptors, followed by the recruitment of
  signal transfer proteins MyD88, IRAK, IKKε and TRAF6, upregulate the transcription
  of the interferon-regulator factor (IRF) family. Activation of TLR7/8- and TLR3-derived
  IKK (IκB kinases) pave the pathway for the phosphorylation of inhibitory IκBa, followed
  by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which results in the translocation
  of NF-κB heterodimer complexes to the nucleus. The final activation sequence involves
  the NF-κB cross-talk with numerous cytokine and TLR-mediated cell signalling pathways
  that depend upon the binding of TNFα and IL-1 to TLR4. Subsequently, the spike proteins
  of SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to induce TLR4-mediated and endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress-induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, IFN-α/β binding with IFNR dimer
  receptors activates the JAK-STAT pathway, which renders the production and subsequent
  nuclear translocation of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 complex. The complex potentiates
  the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Additionally,
  activation of angiotensin-1-receptor (AT1R) imparts pro-inflammatory cytokine activity
  to angiotensin II, which is capable of inducing NF-κB, disintegrin and metalloprotease
  17 (ADAM17). Altogether, activation of NF-κB, disintegrin and ADAM17 promotes the
  production of TNF- α and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, which
  promote the self-activating of NF-κB cycle. Hyperactivation of NF-κB upregulates
  the expression of multiple genes involved in the production of inflammatory cytokine,
  chemokines, adhesion molecules, and acute-phase proteins.
