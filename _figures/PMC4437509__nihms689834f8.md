caption: Transcriptional regulation of the OS MAPK pathway by the circadian clock
  in Neurospora. The genes hpt-1 and os-4 are rhythmically expressed genes, and they
  have opposing effects on the activation state of the OS pathway, measured by p-OS-2.
  The WCC, the positive oscillator component, directly regulates the expression of
  os-4, but the expression of hpt-1 is mediated through an indirect mechanism. It
  is hypothesized that the clock coordinates the antiphasic expression of these two
  genes to generate rhythms in p-OS-2. During the day, the WCC directly upregulates
  the expression of os-4, while hpt-1 is at a trough in its rhythmic expression, leading
  to an increase in p-OS-2. Conversely, during the night, os-4 is at a trough in its
  rhythmic expression, while hpt-1 is at its peak, leading to lower levels of p-OS-2.
