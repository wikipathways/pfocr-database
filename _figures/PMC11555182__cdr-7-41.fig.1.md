caption: 'The KEAP1-NFE2L2 signaling pathway. NFE2L2 is primarily regulated by the
  KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which, under normal conditions, promotes
  the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NFE2L2, keeping its cellular levels
  low. However, in response to oxidative stress or electrophilic agents, key cysteine
  residues on KEAP1 are modified, preventing NFE2L2 ubiquitination. As a result, NFE2L2
  stabilizes and accumulates in the cytoplasm before translocating to the nucleus.
  There, it dimerizes with sMAF proteins and binds to AREs in the promoters of target
  genes. These genes regulate a variety of crucial cellular processes, including antioxidant
  defense, detoxification, cell proliferation and death, autophagy, metabolism, mitochondrial
  function, and iron homeostasis. Through these pathways, NFE2L2-mediated gene expression
  plays an essential role in protecting cells from oxidative damage, maintaining redox
  balance, and ensuring overall cellular homeostasis. KEAP1: Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1; NFE2L2: NFE2-like basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2; CUL3:
  cullin 3; RBX1: ring-box 1; sMAF: small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma; AREs: antioxidant
  response elements'
