caption: Phosphorylations of Mdmx can be initiated by either DNA damage signaling
  or by activated oncogenes. Phosphorylations of Mdmx modulate its interaction with
  other proteins, such as 14-3-3, the protein analyzed in this study. Interaction
  of Mdmx and 14-3-3 is required for accelerated Mdmx and Mdm2 degradation after DNA
  damage, probably by limiting Mdm2/Mdmx interaction with the deubiquitylase HAUSP
  (see text). Preferential degradation of Mdm2 and Mdmx reduces their ability to interact
  with and antagonize p53 function, leading to p53 activation. The 3SA mutations introduced
  in this study prevent 14-3-3 interaction after DNA damage, leading to Mdmx-Mdm2
  stabilization, and a corresponding increased ability to degrade p53.
