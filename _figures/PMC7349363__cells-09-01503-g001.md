  Right Inset: Notch receptors consist of N-terminal EGF-like repeats, followed by
  three Lin12/Notch repeats (LNR) and the heterodimerisation (HD) domain, which together
  form the negative regulatory region (NRR). Next, there is a single transmembrane
  (TM) repeat, followed by an intracellular RBP-J-associated molecule (RAM), ankyrin
  repeats (ANK), a transcriptional TAD domain and a degradation PEST domain. Notch-activating
  mutations (labelled with the star) are commonly found in the HD and PEST domain.
  Main diagram: Immature Notch receptor is processed in the trans-Golgi network where
  a furin-like protease cleaves it at Site S1 within the HD domain, located between
  the LNR and the TM, creating the mature heterodimeric Notch receptor, sustained
  by NRR. Notch-specific ligands located on a neighbouring cell (e.g., Jagged-1/2
  or Delta-like ligand (DLL-) 1/3/4) interact with the N-terminal of the mature Notch
  receptor, causing activation (i.e., release of its autoinhibited conformation).
  ADAM 10/17 matrix metalloproteinases cleave Notch at Site S2 located in TM (extracellular
  side). The remaining TM domain is cleaved by a gamma secretase at Site S3 (intracellular
  side). Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released and translocates to the nucleus
  where it forms a complex with DNA-binding transcription factors RBP-J (CSL), mastermind-like
  (MAML) protein and other coactivator proteins and enzymes, and stimulates transcription
  of Notch target genes including the hairy/enhance of split 1 (HES) and Hes-related
  (HEY) families of transcription repressors, such as HES1 and HEY1. There are numerous
  strategies to pharmacologically target Notch signalling including Notch receptor
  monoclonal antibodies, ligand-targeted antibodies (e.g., DLL-4 antibodies), gamma
  secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and Notch transcription complex small-molecule inhibitors.'
