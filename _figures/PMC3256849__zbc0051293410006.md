caption: A model for Kv1.3-mediated signaling pathway in human T effector memory cell
  differentiation. Kv1.3 blockade by KvDN depletes the cytoplasmic Ca2+ that inhibits
  the activation of the CaMKII. The down-regulation of CaMKII signaling capable of
  preventing SMAD3 from complexing with SMAD2 leads to increased recruitment of SMAD3
  into the SMAD transcriptional complex and translocation to the nucleus, which in
  turn results in increased p21 expression. The overexpression of p21 reduces the
  complex formation between Cdk1 and cyclin B1, thereby causing G2/M phase cell cycle
  arrest.
