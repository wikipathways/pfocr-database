caption: The biosynthetic pathway of steviol constructed in a heterologous host, E.
  coli. IPP, the precursor of steviol, is synthesized by the endogenous MEP pathway
  of E. coli. FPP is converted to steviol by the exogenous steviol synthesis pathway.
  Single arrows represent single-step reactions, while triple arrows denote multistep
  reactions. Red arrows indicate overexpressed genes intended to enhance the precursor
  pool. The genes (dxs from Bacillus subtilis, dxr from E. coli, and idi and ispA
  from Enterococcus sp.) were integrated into the genome of the MG1655 strain. CDPS,
  ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase; CPR, NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase; DXS, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate;
