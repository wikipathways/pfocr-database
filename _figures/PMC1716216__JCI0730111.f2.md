caption: In well-differentiated, intestinal-type gastric cancer, histopathological
  studies indicated that chronic H. pylori infection progresses over decades through
  stages of chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer
  (). The development of cancer has been attributed to alterations in DNA caused by
  chronic inflammation, recruitment and engraftment of bone marrow–derived cells,
  an imbalance between epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, and, in a milieu
  of atrophy and achlorhydria, gastric colonization by enteric bacteria with nitrate
  reductase activity, which facilitates the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines.
  Corpus-predominant atrophy, or the loss of specialized glandular cell types such
  as parietal and chief cells, appears to be the critical initiating step in the progression
  toward cancer. Adapted with permission from the New England Journal of Medicine
