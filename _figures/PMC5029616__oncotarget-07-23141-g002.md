caption: 'Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment induces the upregulation of CD147
  expression by a combined effect of transcription factor HIF-1 on HRE of CD147 and
  SP1 on the activation of CD147 promotor. The overexpression of CD147 promotes aerobic
  glycolysis mediated by the activation of the PI3K/Akt/MDM2 pathway, subsequently
  promotion of p53 degradation and inhibiting the downregulation of GLUT1/4 gene expression
  and suppression of PFK by p53 in the glycolytic metabolism and repressing mitochondrial
  oxidative respiration via downregulation of PGC1a, TFAM, and p53R2 in a p53-dependent
  manner at the same time. The glycolytic phenotype of tumor leads to increased production
  of lactic acid, which has to be exported across the plasma membrane in order to
  prevent cell death, due to cellular acidosis. Lactate is pumped out from cells mainly
  through two H+/lactate co-transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, to maintain homeostasis in
  the intracellular pH of tumors (MCT1 is bidirectional). CD147 serves as a chaperone
  to assist in the surface expression, folding, stability, appropriate location and
  functionality of MCT1 and MCT4. ATP: adenosine triphosphate; Akt: also known as
  protein kinase B (PKB); GLUT1/4: glucose transporter 1/4; HIF: hypoxia-inducible
  factor; HRE: hypoxia response element; MCT1/4: monocarboxylate transporter 1/4;
  MDM2: mouse double minute 2 homolog; PFK: phosphofructokinase; PGC-1: peroxisome
