caption: Expanded networks of transport and signaling pathways. The relationships
  among the molecules involved in transport (a) and signaling pathways (b) are graphed
  as described in the text. Integrin-mediated signaling pathway derived by the canonical
  pathway algorithms of IPA (c). The node colors and shapes are described in figure
  5.
