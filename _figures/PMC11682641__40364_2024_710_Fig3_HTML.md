caption: 'Detailed overview of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia''s genetic landscape
  in the context of signalling network. This figure comprehensively depicts the genetic
  and molecular aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their involvement
  in key cellular pathways. The figure illustrates how mutations in specific genes
  lead to disruptions in several critical cellular processes and signalling pathways:
  (i) NF-κB Signalling: alterations in BIRC3 and MYD88 lead to disruptions in NF-κB
  signalling, a pathway essential for B cell survival and proliferation. The pathway''s
  components are depicted, including the interactions between various proteins and
  the downstream effects on transcription factors. (ii) NOTCH1 Pathway: The NOTCH1
  signalling pathway is represented, highlighting the consequences of NOTCH1 mutations.
  The diagram illustrates the interaction between the NOTCH receptor and its ligand
  Delta, leading to the cleavage and release of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD)
  and the subsequent activation of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation.
  (iii) RNA Processing: Aberrations in SF3B1 and XPO1, which are involved in RNA splicing
  and nuclear export, respectively, are shown to affect the processing and function
  of RNA within the cell. (iv) DNA Damage Response: The figure details the DNA damage
  response pathway, showing how mutations in ATM, TP53, impair the cell''s ability
  to respond to and repair DNA damage. It also depicts the connections between these
  genes and the apoptosis pathway. An element linking RNA processing and the DNA damage
  response is the SF3B1 mutation combined with ATM deletion, which together drive
  the accumulation of cen-R-loops. This accumulation disrupts mitotic spindle dynamics
  and chromosome alignment, thereby cooperating to induce chromosomal instability
  (CIN). Cen-R-loops interfere with the processes of mitotic spindle formation and
  chromosome segregation. (v) Apoptosis: The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, with
  a focus on the role of BCL2 and its family members. The binding of venetoclax to
  BCL2 is emphasised, demonstrating how this interaction leads to mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), cytochrome c release, and the subsequent activation
  of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to cell death. Figure created in BioRender
