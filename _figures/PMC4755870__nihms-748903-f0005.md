caption: miR-27 fine tunes osteoblast differentiation by positively regulating canonical
  Wnt signaling and negatively regulating Runx2 activity. miR-27a targets inhibitors
  of canonical Wnt pathway, APC and sFRP1, as well as promoters of Runx2 activity,
  SATB2 and Hoxa10. The scope of this figure is limited to include only specific targets
  discussed in the text.
