caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway in T. versicolor and G. subvermispora for the
  conversion of 4-HBA. Intracellular and extracellular metabolites detected in cellobiose,
  4-HBA, lignin, and poplar cultivations (see Dataset S3 and SI Appendix, Figs. S7–S9
  for quantitative and qualitative information for each metabolite and SI Appendix,
  Table S2 for the complete list of metabolites analyzed). As expected, based on previously
  described syringic acid catabolic pathways (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), none of these
  metabolites were detected in syringic acid cultivations and neither were the predicted
  metabolites included as standards in metabolomic analyses (i.e., 3-O-methylgallic
  acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol, and 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid; SI Appendix,
  Table S2). Fungal cultivations were conducted in triplicate. A metabolite is considered
  to be present in biological cultivations if it is detected in at least in two replicates.
  Media not inoculated with fungi (noninoculated) was also used as control for extracellular
  metabolomic analyses and intracellular when applicable (i.e., for pellets from lignin
  and poplar cultivations). Molecules without boxes next to the structure do not have
  commercially available standards. Continuous gray arrows indicate potential transport
  through the cell membrane. Continuous and discontinuous black lines correspond to
  validated (in this work) and proposed enzymatic steps, respectively. The steps are
  as follows: 1) oxidative decarboxylases GS_120062 and GS_90429, 2) hydroxylase TV_58730,
  3) hydroxylation by cytochrome P450, 4) hydroxylases TV_58730 and GS_82057, 5) oxidative
  decarboxylases GS_120062 and TV_32834 and GS_90429, 6) dioxygenase, 7) ring-cleaving
  dioxygenases TV_28066 and GS_116134, 8) 4-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
  9) maleylacetate reductase, 10) ketoacid CoA transferase, 11) thiolase, 12) CARs,
  13) aldehyde dehydrogenase,14) alcohol dehydrogenase, 15) alcohol oxidase, 16) aldehyde
  oxidase, 17) 4-O-methyl transferase, and 18) demethylase. Additional information
  for each of these putative enzymatic reactions is detailed in SI Appendix, Text
  S2.'
