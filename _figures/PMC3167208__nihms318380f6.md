caption: Proposed model for the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation by the miR-15
  family. The miR-15 family is proposed to lie downstream of a tumor suppressor pathway
  that is activated in the heart shortly after birth. MiR-15 family members repress
  cardiomyocyte proliferation by inhibiting a number of cell cycle genes involved
  in G2/M phase transition and mitotic progression, including Chek1.
