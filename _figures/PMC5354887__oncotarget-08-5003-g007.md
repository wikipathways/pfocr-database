caption: '(A) Regulation of AKT and ERK in KRAS mutant cancer cells. Left: Untreated
  cells. Middle: AKTi-treated cells. Right: MEKi-treated cells. (B). Regulation of
  AKT and ERK in BRAF mutant cancer cells. Left: Untreated cells. Middle: AKTi-treated
  cells. Right: MEKi-treated cells. In the KRAS mutant cells, AKT is activated by
  both the mutant RAS and normal RTKs, but inhibited by a negative feedback mechanism
  through the RTK-IRS1-PI3K pathway. ATKi inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT, but
  also relieves the feedback inhibition of RTK and/or IRS1, leading to reactivation
  of AKT. ERK on the other hand is activated mainly by the mutant RAS, while inhibited
  by another feedback mechanism through CRAF. MEKi inhibits the phosphorylation of
  ERK, but relieves the feedback inhibition of CRAF, leading to the reactivation of
  ERK. In the BRAF mutant cells, AKT and ERK are regulated by similar positive and
  negative pathways as that in the KRAS mutant cells, except that ERK is activated
  by the mutant BRAF instead of KRAS.'
