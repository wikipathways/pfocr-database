caption: Myricetin regulatory influence on several cellular pathways. Myricetin modulates
  essential cellular pathways that support cell survival, growth, proliferation, cell
  cycle division, and apoptosis. PI3K/Akt and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascades are mainly
  influenced by myricetin action. Further, it acts as a negative modulator of the
  NFkB pathway, either by directly acting on it or by promoting signaling through
  the Nrf2 pathway. It also blocks JAK/STAT pathway. Myricetin also interacts with
  cell surface receptors of the RTKs family. It directly interacts with the TGF receptor
  and hinders TGF signaling. It also has a role in preventing beta-catenin accumulation
  in the cytoplasm by activating GSK 3b. Furthermore, it also turns on the hippo pathway
  by promoting LATS activity directly or through JNK. Myricetin's pro-apoptotic function
  is also known. It promotes Bax mitochondrial translocation through p53 activation
  or via Akt pathway inhibition
