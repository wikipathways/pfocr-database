caption: 'Effects of metabolites derived from tumor cells on immune cells and nutritional
  competition between cancer cells and immune cells. Tumor cells have competitive
  advantages over glutamine and glucose. Tumor cells produce a lot of lactate, which
  is transported to extracellular environment. High concentration of lactate hinders
  transfer of lactate from T cells and interferes with metabolism and function of
  T cells. Lactate damages dendritic cells and inhibits monocyte migration and cytokine
  release. Lactate inhibits the effect of TNF. In tumor microenvironment, tryptophan
  is decreased, while kynurenine and tryptophan is increased. IDO is highly expressed
  in tumor cells and catalyzes tryptophan degradation. Tryptophan is metabolized to
  produce kynurenine, which promotes the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into Treg
  cells by activating kynurenine AHR signal axis. IDO also activates Treg cells to
  up-regulate the expression of PD-L1 and inhibited the proliferation of T cells through
  PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. M1-TAM decreases but M2- TAM increases. Lactate and MAGL induced
  M2 like polarization of TAMs. In addition, hyaluronic acid is increased in matrix,
  and Treg cells are highly expressed. TNF: tumor necrosis factor, IDO: indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase, AHR pathway: kynurenine aryl hydrocarbon receptor signal axis,
  TAM: tumor-associated macrophage, M1-TAM: M1 type tumor-associated macrophage, M2-TAM:
  M2 type tumor-associated macrophage.'
