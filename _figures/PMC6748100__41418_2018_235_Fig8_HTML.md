caption: Schematic diagram of the main findings of this study. Our results indicated
  that lncRNA-FA2H-2 suppressed MLKL expression, which alleviated the inflammatory
  response induced by OX-LDL through induction of autophagy flux. Moreover, the autophagy
  suppressed by MLKL was associated with mTOR-dependent signaling pathway activation.
