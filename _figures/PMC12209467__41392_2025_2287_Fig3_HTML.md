caption: HIF signaling pathway and targeted therapy in PH. a The involvement of the
  HIF signaling pathway in cell proliferation, apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, ECM remodeling,
  migration, and cell-cell interactions in PH. Hypoxia and Tie2Cre-mediated Egln1
  deletion upregulate HIF-1α and HIF-2α, leading to increased ECM protein deposition.
  In PASMCs, this results in the upregulation of PCNA and intracellular calcium ion
  concentration, along with the downregulation of Caspase-3/7/9, promoting cell proliferation,
  migration, and resistance to apoptosis. In PAECs, the same conditions induce the
  upregulation of Caspase-3, promoting apoptosis. Luteolin, PT2567, PT2385 and anti-CD146
  antibody mitigate PH by regulating HIF signaling. b HIF signaling pathway also plays
  a crucial role in EndMT, glycolysis, inflammation, contraction, and cell-cell interactions
  in PH. Hypoxia, Su/Hx, and cobalt chloride upregulate HIF-1α and HIF-2α, resulting
  in metabolic reprogramming (e.g., PDHK), upregulation of IL and COL1, promoting
  inflammation, EndMT, which influences anti-apoptosis, proliferation, and migration.
  Conversely, the downregulation of HIF-1α in IPAH patients may lead to PASMC contraction.
