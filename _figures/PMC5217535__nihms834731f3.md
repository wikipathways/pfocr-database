caption: Biosynthesis of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid. This biosynthetic pathway
  features enzymes that likely possess species-specific enzymatic activity, namely
  the hexanoyl-CoA ligase, tetraketide synthase and olivetolic acid cyclase that are
  all required for the formation of the precursor molecule olivetolic acid. In the
  absence of olivetolic acid cyclase, 2-pyrones (α-pyrones) form as the major products.
  2-Pyrones derived from both triketide and tetraketide intermediates occur upon lactonization
  of extended polyketide intermediates. For clarity, the 2-pyrone derived from a fully
  extended tetraketide intermediate is shown. Olivetolic acid is then geranylated
  by CsPT1 to form cannabigerolic acid. Cannabigerolic acid then undergoes cyclization
  catalyzed by THCA synthase to form Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid. The psychotropic
  activity of these compounds comes about upon heating of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic
  acid, which undergoes decarboxylation to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
