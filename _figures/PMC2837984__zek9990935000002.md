caption: SREBP pathway in fungi. (A) S. pombe. In the presence of oxygen, sterols
  inhibit proteolysis of Sre1 and Ofd1 accelerates Sre1N degradation. In the absence
  of oxygen, both Sre1 proteolysis and stability increase, leading to upregulation
  of genes required for sterol synthesis and adaptation to low oxygen levels. How
  Sre1 is released from the membrane is unknown. (B) C. neoformans. Under low-oxygen
  conditions, CnSre1 is released from the membrane by the site 2 protease homolog
  Stp1 and CnSre1N activates genes required for sterol synthesis and metal homeostasis.
  Whether CnSre1N is regulated by Ofd1 is not known.
