caption: Putative signaling components in fungal mating interactions. (A) The well-known
  components of the signaling pathway associated with mating in the ascomycete S.
  cerevisiae () and in the ustilaginomycete U. maydis (), as well as the known and
  putative signaling in the agaricomycete S. commune, are shown. The arrows illustrate
  the direction of signaling from pheromone/receptor interaction via G protein and
  MAPK cascade to the transcription factor (TF). Note that in S. cerevisiae the Ste4/18
  (βγ) complex interacts with Ste20 (a PAK-like kinase), which then signals further
  to the MAPK cascade containing the scaffolding protein Ste5. No Ste5 has been found
  in the S. commune genome, while an ortholog to Ste20 is detected. A homolog to Ste50,
  involved in mating response, invasive/filamentous growth, and osmotolerance, and
  acting as an adaptor that links the G protein-associated Cdc42-Ste20 complex to
  Ste11 in S. cerevisiae, has been identified in U. maydis (Ubc2 [46]) and in S. commune.
  (B) A hypothetical model of signaling components in the agaricomycete  S. commune
  after G protein activation by pheromone/receptor interaction. The released G protein
  subunits activate a homologous MAPK cascade. Perceived functions include induction
  of enzymes necessary for hyphal fusions and septal dissolution, which might also
  respond to the cAMP-dependent Pka pathway. In addition to the MAPK cascade, Gβγ
  has been shown to activate Cdc42, thus controlling cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary
  for nuclear exchange and migration.
