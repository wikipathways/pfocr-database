caption: Diagram of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of the
  rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway and cell cycle and autophagy dysregulation in
  cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial stress, a common event in AD
  and cancer activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Activated mTOR, promotes cell cycle
  re-entry and inhibits autophagy. Cell cycle re-entry contributes in cellular over
  proliferation, with the higher chance of DNA damage as a result, in cancer. Cell
  cycle could not be completed by mature neurons and will result in neuronal death
  (neurodegeneration), and AD hallmarks development (beta amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated
  tau) while the neurons are remained in G2 phase of cell cycle, before death. Inhibition
  of autophagy due to mTOR activation also participates in AD and cancer pathogenesis.
