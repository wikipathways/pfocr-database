caption: 'The algorithm revealed the molecular mechanism of TMAO to promote aneurysm
  dilation by inducing apoptosis of VSMCs: after TMAO is transported into VSMC through
  transmembrane, it triggers ER stress, resulting in the accumulation of unfolded
  proteins and activating the PERK pathway. Activated PERK inhibits global protein
  synthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α, but selectively promotes the translation of
  ATF4, which activates CHOP transcription upon nucleus. CHOP upregulates the expression
  of proapoptotic proteins BIM and PUMA, which in turn triggers the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway, promotes the release of cytochrome C, and activates the caspase-9/caspase-3
  cascade, and ultimately leads to VSMC apoptosis (manifested by nuclear fragmentation
  and membrane blistering). Persistent VSMC apoptosis weakens the structural integrity
  of the elastic fibers of the aortic wall, leading to a decrease in the mechanical
  strength of the vessel wall and aneurysm dilation. This mechanism provides a theoretical
  basis for targeting the intestinal microbiota-TMAO axis or ER stress pathway for
  the prevention and treatment of aneurysms. Created by Shuake Janaerbieke'
