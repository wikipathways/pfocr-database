caption: 'The HBV life cycle and cccDNA biogenesis. HBV life cycle is a multi-step
  process composed of viral entry, cccDNA biogenesis, progeny nucleocapsid production,
  virion formation, and egress. Viral entry is mediated by NTCP, heparin sulfate proteoglycans
  (HSPGs, such as glypican 5), and EGFR on the surface of hepatocytes. cccDNA biogenesis
  is an essential process to establish infection, which consists of three distinct
  steps: nuclear transport of rcDNA and uncoating, repair of rcDNA to form cccDNA,
  and cccDNA chromatinization. cccDNA can serve as the template for pre-genomic and
  precore mRNAs and multiple sub-genomic mRNAs, which can be translated to several
  viral proteins, including HBV POL, core antigen (capsid), surface antigens, HBx,
  and core-antigen related proteins (not shown). Progeny nucleocapsid production is
  initiated by the binding of HBV POL to pre-genomic mRNA, which triggers the packaging
  (encapsidation) and synthesis of rcDNA. The resultant nucleocapsids can either be
  re-imported into the nucleus, and the rcDNA repaired to form cccDNA and maintain
  cccDNA pool through the intracellular amplification pathway, or it can be enveloped
  in the multivesicular body (MVB) to complete virion assembly. Subsequent virion
  egress completes the HBV life cycle.'
