caption: 'Shortcuts on a black background indicating the mine enzymes: AHAS, acetohydroxyacid
  synthase; BCOADH, branched chain 2-oxoacids dehydrogenase (E1 component of branched
  chain 2-oxoacids dehydrogenase complex); DXPS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase;
  OGDH, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1 component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complex); PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1 component
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex); TK, transketolase.Gray asterisk – metabolites
  directly associated with thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent pathways.Thiamine diphosphate-dependent
  enzymes play a role in photosynthesis in chloroplasts (TK, DXPS), pentose phosphate
  pathway (TK), and alcoholic fermentation (PDC) in cytoplasm as well as in ATP synthesis
  by participation in oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate (PDH) and Krebs cycle
  (OGDH) in mitochondria. These enzymes are also involved in branched amino acid synthesis
  (AHAS) and catabolism (BCOADH). Pentose phosphate pathway supplies NADPH which is
  necessary for anabolic processes and reduction of natural antioxidants. Moreover,
  it provides pentose necessary for nucleotide synthesis.'
