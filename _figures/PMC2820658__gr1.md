caption: Induction of IFNs after virus infection in IFN-β pretreated human DCs. IFN-β,
  after binding to IFNAR, engages the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to STAT phosphorylation
  and production of IRF7 and SOCS. The latter acts back negatively on JAK/STAT pathway
  activation. Viral infection is detected by RIG-I and leads via IRF7 activation to
  induction and secretion of IFN-β/α, which bind to IFNAR in a positive feedback loop.
  Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) act in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
