caption: Gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors
  such as amino acids or lactate, is in part the reversal of glycolysis. Phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase, which exists as a mitochondrial (PCK2) and a cytosolic isoform (PCK1),
  mediates the initial step of gluconeogenesis and links the TCA cycle (citric acid
  cycle, Krebs cycle) and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Further steps in gluconeogenesis
  (red arrows) are mediated by bi-directional glycolytic/gluconeogenesis enzymes and
  the downstream enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and glucose-6-phosphatase
  (G6PC). Abbreviated gluconeogenesis allows the synthesis of cellular building blocks
  from non-carbohydrate precursors (red boxes) and requires the action of PCK1/2 and
  to some extent also FBP1/2. Biosynthetic pathways independent of gluconeogenesis
  are depicted in blue.
