caption: PTEN, a tumor suppressor and regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway is commonly
  disrupted and unable to inhibit AKT phosphorylation during the early stages of cancer
  progression. Curcumin inhibits PI3K and blocks AKT phosphorylation which in turn
  blocks mTOR and MDM2 phosphorylation while preventing inactivation of GSK3β via
  phosphorylation and the suppression of pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative proteins,
  reducing cell growth, proliferation, and motility -.
