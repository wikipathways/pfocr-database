caption: A novel pathway for butanol and isobutanol production. Metabolic pathway
  for butanol and isobutanol production from glycine in S. cerevisiae through the
  glyoxylate, β-ethylmalate and α-ketoacids intermediates (grey background arrows).
  The enzymatic activities involved and the associated gene(s) are also represented.
  Numbers inside circles indicates the steps of the pathway discussed in this study.
  The hypothesized isomerisation of α-ketovalerate into α-isoketovalerate is indicated
  by black arrow.
