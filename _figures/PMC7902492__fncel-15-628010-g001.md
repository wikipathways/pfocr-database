caption: HD profoundly alters the striatum and MSNs in both patients and mouse models,
  upper panel. (A) Schematic representation of HD patient brain. At the early stage
  of the disease (grade 1–2), patients already manifest mild brain atrophy and astrogliosis
  (; ). MSNs undergo proliferative expansion and show increased number and size of
  spines (). At the molecular level, a reduction of synaptic proteins and alterations
  in gene transcription are detected (; ). These changes continue during advanced
  stages (grade 3–4), when brain atrophy becomes prominent (). MSNs undergo degenerative
  changes and spine loss, and mutant huntingtin aggregates can be detected within
  nuclei (; ; ). Altered energy metabolism and somatic instability of the CAG tract
  are detected (; ; ). (B) Knock-in HD mouse models (CAG > 80) faithfully recapitulate
  the human HD mutation and mimic several aspects of the human condition. At early
  age (<4 months), mice show mild brain atrophy () and diffuse accumulation of mutant
  huntingtin within MSNs nuclei (). At the molecular level, energy metabolism and
  transcription are altered (; ; ). Somatic instability is already detectable at this
  stage (). At later stages (>6 months), brain atrophy becomes more prominent and
  astrogliosis could be detected (; ; ). MSNs show reduced dendritic complexity and
  spine loss, and nuclear mutant huntingtin aggregates inclusions (; ). The molecular
  alterations proceed and somatic instability becomes particularly evident (). Specific
  pathways and phenotypes developed by D1R- and D2R-MSNs upon expression of mutant
  huntingtin, lower panel. (C,C′) Striatopallidal neurons (D2R-MSNs) are affected
  earlier than striatonigral ones (D1R-MSNs) by HD mutation (). (D,D′) Gene expression
  profiling on R6/2 mice revealed that neurotrophin pathway is specifically upregulated
  in D2R-MSNs, while mismatch repair (MMR) and synaptic functioning pathways seem
  to be altered in both MSNs subpopulations (). (E) In both R6/2 and zQ175 mice, oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) downregulation observed in D2R cells contribute to mitochondrial
  dysfunction (), while (E′) OXPHOS genes are upregulated in D1R cells, possibly suggesting
  a homeostatic response (). (F) In mice and rat striatal cell cultures overexpressing
  mutant huntingtin, D2R stimulation enhances mutant huntingtin aggregation and mitochondrial
  dysfunction (; ). (F′) In HdhQ111 models, dopamine and glutamate synergistically
  enhance MSNs sensitivity to mutant huntingtin toxicity through D1R activation ().
  (G,G′) In 12 months old zQ175 KI mice, D1R neurons show proliferative expansion
  of the dendritic arborization and a significant reduction in the density of thin
  spines, while D2R neurons do not show significant differences (). (H,H′) In the
  same model, only D1R neurons exhibit reduced rheobase and action potential amplitude
