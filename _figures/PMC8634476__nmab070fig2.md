caption: Overview of the Wnt signaling pathway. (A) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  In the presence of Wnt ligands, the activity of the β-catenin destruction complex
  is inhibited, and β-catenin is accumulated in the cytoplasm, initiating transcription
  of target genes. The dotted arrow indicates that in the absence of Wnt ligands,
  β-catenin is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated by the destruction complex and subsequently
  degraded by the proteasome. In addition, extracellular factors such as dickkopfs
  (Dkks) and secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) can inhibit the canonical
  Wnt signaling. (B) Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Aggregation
  of disheveled associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1) activates Rho or Rac
  and subsequently regulates the transcription of target genes. (C) Wnt/Ca2+signaling
  pathway. The activation of frizzled (FZD) stimulates the release of calcium (Ca2+),
  which in turn promotes the signaling of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamK
  II) and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) pathways, leading to changes in
  gene transcription to affect the biological processes such as cell migration and
  adhesion. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1, casein kinase1; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  DVL, dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LEF, lymphoid-enhancing factor; LRP5/6, LDL receptor-related
  protein 5/6; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C;
  PLC, phospholipase C; ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; ROR2, receptor tyrosine
  kinase-like orphan receptor; RYK, receptor-like tyrosine kinase; TCF, T-cell factor.
