caption: Insect Trehalose-Based Energy Metabolism as a Blueprint for Metabolic Efficiency.
  This schematic illustrates the core metabolic pathway of trehalose utilization in
  ants, highlighting mechanisms that contribute to their metabolic resilience despite
  high sugar intake. Trehalose is hydrolyzed by trehalase into glucose, which is phosphorylated
  into glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose 6P) and further processed through glycolysis or
  stored as glycogen. Key enzymes such as hexokinase, aldolase, PGM, and PGAM2 regulate
  glycolytic flux. Glycogen metabolism, including synthesis by GlyS and breakdown
  via GlyP and autophagy, maintains sugar homeostasis. Pyruvate generated from glycolysis
  enters the TCA cycle, producing ATP. While humans lack a trehalose-based metabolic
  system, this insect model demonstrates a tightly regulated energy buffering mechanism
  that could inspire future diabetes therapies, such as synthetic enzyme engineering
  or trehalose pathway mimetics for enhancing glycemic stability. This figure is not
  a proposal to replace glucose with trehalose in humans, but to showcase potential
  biochemical strategies to optimize glucose handling under metabolic stress
