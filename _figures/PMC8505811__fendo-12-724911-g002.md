caption: Schematic diagram of muscle-bone crosstalk in COPD. In COPD, the serum levels
  of irisin are decreased, while myostatin and RANKL are up-regulated in both circulation
  and skeletal muscles. The raised expression of RANKL induced by chronic cigarette
  smoke exposure contributes to muscle atrophy/skeletal muscle dysfunction through
  the RANKL/RANK pathway. The figure also shows the specific signaling pathway of
  irisin and RANKL. TGF-β binds to TGF-βR1/TGF-βR2 complex, and Smad3 is phosphorylated
  and translocated into the nucleus to bind the promoters of PGC-1α and FNDC5 to suppress
  their transcription, and suppression of FNDC5 transcription and protein leads to
  decrease in circulating irisin in vitro. RANKL activates the homologous receptor
  RANK on the surface of osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors, and activated RANK
  causes the recruitment of the adapter protein TRAF6, leading to NF-κB activation
  and translation of NF-κB to the nucleus. NF-κB increases the expression of c-Fos,
  and c-Fos interacts with NFATc1 to trigger the transcription of osteoclastogenic
  genes.
