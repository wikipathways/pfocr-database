caption: A A simplified steroid-related derivative biosynthetic pathway. The solid
  arrows indicate the confirmed sections, while the dashed arrows represent the proposed
  sections. The examined enzymes are given, and the gene numbers in different species
  are indicated by the histogram. MVA, mevalonic acid; MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate;
  IPI, isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase; GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; FPPS,
  farnesyl diphosphate synthase; SQS, squalene synthase; SQE, squalene epoxidase;
  CAS, cycloartenol synthase; LAS, lanosterol synthase; HSD, 3-beta hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase/isomerase. B A schematic diagram displaying the origin and expansion
  of SQE genes in P. floridana. The blue square represents 15 Physalis-specific SQE
  genes that expanded from a conserved Solanaceae SQE (pf03G072270) but were lost
  in Solanum. The triangle represents the other four Solanaceae-conserved SQE genes.
  Detailed information is available in Supplementary Figs.  and
papertitle: The Physalis floridana genome provides insights into the biochemical and
  morphological evolution of Physalis fruits.
