caption: Amino acid analysis was performed to show the change of amino acid metabolites
  between different species and diagnosis/model. The boxed amino acids were analyzed
  and matched by LC-MS and metabolomics software. Green means the log transformed
  area under the curve (AUC) significantly increased in rat MCD and human NASH. Red
  stands for significantly decreased in rat MCD and human NASH. Black shows no change
  regardless of species. Blue shows that the change trend comparing control to NASH
  was different between human and rat. The asterisk sign (*) represents the trend
  in rat and the pound sign (#) represents the trend in human.
