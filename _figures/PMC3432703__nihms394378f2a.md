caption: '2 AThe control of interdigitating growth in PCs.In Arabidopsis leaf PCs,
  interdigitating growth is controlled by a ROP GTPase signaling network with two
  pathways with opposing actions on localized cell expansion: the ROP2-RIC4 pathway
  promotes lobe outgrowth via a fine cortical MF network, while the ROP6-RIC1 pathway
  suppresses outgrowth via well-organized cortical MTs.During the initiation of lobes
  and indentations, these two pathways are locally activated and spatially separated.
  Counter signaling establishes borders that separate outgrowth-promoting from outgrowth-suppressing
  domains of the cell cortex.2 BA model indicating how RAC GAP and active Rho may
  restrict cell protrusion to the front in leukocytes.High Rho activity at the rear
  and sides causes the activation of Rac GAP with a subsequent depression of Rac in
  this region.'
