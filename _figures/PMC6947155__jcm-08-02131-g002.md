caption: 'Schematic representation showing the potential molecular mechanisms involved
  in tumor development in the context of FAT1 (FAT atypical cadherin 1) functional
  loss, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) amplification or PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha) overexpression in head and neck squamous cell
  carcinomas (HNSCCs). Note that PIK3CA codes for the catalytic subunit of PI3K (phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase). In non-tumor cells, in the presence of low levels of EGFR and normal
  PIK3CA expression, PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) forms a complex with
  the Hippo signaling core complex promoting YAP phosphorylation. Similarly, FAT1
  acts as a scaffold for Hippo kinases, thus favoring their activation. In a tumor
  cell, the absence of FAT1 or the presence of high levels of EGFR and increased PI3K
  activity, which recruits PDK1 to the cell membrane, dismantles the Hippo core complex
  leading to YAP dephosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus. RTKs: receptor
  tyrosine kinases.'
