caption: 'Network analysis of the gene pathways* catalogued in the Panther database,
  which - directly or indirectly - are connected with AD upon activation with Hp(2-20).
  Protein interactions were analyzed with the STITCH (A) and STRING (B) tools. The
  former catalogues known or predicted interactions between chemicals and proteins;
  the latter known or predicted protein-protein interactions. *List of the pathways
  included in the figure: Alzheimer disease-amyloid secretase pathway, Alzheimer disease-presenilin
  pathway, Angiogenesis, VEG-F signaling pathway, and Inflammation mediated by chemokine
  and cytokine signaling pathway.'
