caption: EGFR family members share a common domain arrangement comprised of a cysteine-rich
  extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase
  domain with several phosphorylation sites. The extracellular domains are subdivided
  and numbered as I-IV. Numerous phosphorylation sites were mentioned in cytoplasmic
  domain of EGFR. Monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain III. The small
  molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors bind with the ATP binding pockets in the tyrosine
  kinase domain. Several deletion mutations occur in the EGFR such as EGFRvI (AAΔ1–541),
  EGFRvIII (AAΔ6–273), EGFRvII (AAΔ521–603), EGFRvIV (AAΔ959–1053) and EGFRvV (AAΔ959–1186).
  Additionally, several point mutations occur in TK domain of EGFR. Furthermore, the
  details of EGFR mutations were discussed by Kuan et al.2001 []. (AAΔ amino acid
  deletion).
