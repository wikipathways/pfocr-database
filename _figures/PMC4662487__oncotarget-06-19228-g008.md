caption: A. DCA activates AMPK/p53 pathway in response to oxidative stress. Wt p53
  is phosphorylated and transcriptional activated by AMPKα leading to G1 cell cycle
  arrest and inhibition of glycolysis. p53 also increases AMPKβ gene expression, reinforcing
  the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) response. B. DCA doesn't stop proliferation
  in absence of p53 or presence or mtp53. mtp53 gain of functions could be involved
  in tumour progression, drug resistance and inhibition of certain genes such as AMPK.
