caption: Overview of QTG involved in organoleptic compound production. Proteins highlighted
  in red are coded by allelic variants that were experimentally validated for their
  contribution to variation in organoleptic compound production in S. cerevisiae.
  Indirect relationships are shown in dashed lines. Proteins are between brackets
  when only the protein of interest of a pathway is shown. TCA = tricarboxylic acid
  cycle. NCR = nitrogen catabolite repression of transcription.
