caption: Overview of the Hedgehog pathway. In the inactive state, Patched 1 (PTCH1)
  inhibits Smoothened (SMO) and Gli is targeted for degradation by the proteasome.
  In the active state, Hedgehog (HH) is translated, cleaved, and transported by Dispatched
  to the extracellular space. HH is able to bind to PTCH1, which prevents inhibition
  of SMO and allows it to accumulate at base of the primary cilium. Gli is then stabilized
  and translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes.
