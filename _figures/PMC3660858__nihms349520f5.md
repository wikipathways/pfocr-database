caption: Proposed cell signaling pathway of noradrenergic influence on CRF transcription.
  Norepinephrine (NE) in the extracellular space binds to a G-protein coupled adrenergic
  receptor spanning the neuronal cell membrane (1). This ligand-receptor complex then
  activates the G protein, causing the alpha subunit to dissociate from the beta and
  gamma subunits (2). The activated alpha subunit of the G protein functions to activate
  the plasma membrane bound enzyme, adenylyl cyclase (3). Adenylyl cyclase synthesizes
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (4). cAMP
  binds to the regulatory subunits of cycle-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (5).
  This induces a conformational change causing the regulatory subunits to release
  the catalytic subunits, thereby activating the kinase activity of the catalytic
  subunits (6). Once the catalytic subunits are freed and active, they translocate
  into the nucleus of the cell to phosphorylate cAMP response element binding protein
  (CREB) (7). The regulatory subunits remain in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated CREB
  (pCREB) then recruits a transcriptional co-activator called CREB-binding protein
  (CBP) (8). CBP recognizes the regulatory region of the target gene called the cAMP
  response element (CRE) and stimulates gene transcription (9). The culmination of
  this proposed cell signaling pathway is the transcription of CRF (10).
