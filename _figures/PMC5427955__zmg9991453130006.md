caption: Robust cyp26a1 and raraa RA regulation could participate in maintaining RA
  signaling in vivo. A, The proposed two-tailed gradient along the antero-posterior
  axis of the embryo is controlled by local degradation of RA by CYP26A1 the expression
  of which is activated by RA and inhibited by FGF pathway (). RALDH2 synthetizes
  RA and its expression is activated by FGF. B, In WT embryos, cyp26a1 is activated
  by RA by any of the 4 RAR subtypes. However, RAR-αA is the only subtype to be strongly
  activated by RA. In the case of an impaired availability of RARs (eg, knockdown),
  the robust activation of raraa by RA ensures the subsequent activation of cyp26a1,
  necessary for the control of RA level in vivo. Ant, anterior; FGF, fibroblast growth
  factor; Post, posterior; WT, wild type.
