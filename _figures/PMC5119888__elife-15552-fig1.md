caption: 'The yeast’s endogenous glycogen-metabolic pathway (grey box) was removed
  and varying components of the starch-biosynthetic pathway from Arabidopsis (green
  box) was introduced. The deregulated mutant of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase)
  from E. coli was used for the supply of ADPglucose. For details of the constructs
