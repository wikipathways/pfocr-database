caption: The mechanism of simvastatin in alleviating endothelial dysfunction under
  oxidative stress. LRP6 is localized to the cell membrane, and it is phosphorylated
  after it accumulates in the lipid raft which contributes to activate intracellular
  signal transduction in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and then induce ER stress and endothelial
  dysfunction. Simvastatin can block intracellular cholesterol synthesis, which depresses
  endoplasmic reticulum stress and endothelial dysfunction, but does not further affect
  the phosphorylation of LRP6 by affecting lipid rafts. Therefore, although, simvastatin
  does not affect transmembrane signal transduction in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  but blocks intracellular signal transduction in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by attenuating
  the ER stress.
