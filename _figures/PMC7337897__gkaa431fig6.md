caption: MDM2 regulates E2F1 synthesis during EBNA1 mRNA-induced translation stress.
  (A) Model illustrating the stress response pathway induced by dysfunctional mRNA
  translation that via MDM2 induces E2F1 synthesis in a PI3Kδ-dependent fashion which
  promotes cell cycle progression and increased ribosome biogenesis via c-myc. E2F1
  activates the p14Arf tumor suppressor that prevents MDM2-mediated degradation of
  p53 and MDM2-mediated induction of E2F1 by preventing the MDM2 - E2F1 mRNA interaction.
  This illustrates a novel oncogenic activity of MDM2 and a novel tumour suppressor
  activity of p14Arf. (B) Model illustrating how the oncogenic activity of EBNA1-induced
  mRNA translation stress via PI3Kδ and MDM2 targets the p53 and the retinoblastoma
  protein (pRb) tumour suppressor pathways. PI3Kδ stabilizes MDM2 and promotes the
  MDM2 – E2F1 mRNA interaction that results in an increase in E2F1 protein synthesis.
  This places the Epstein-Barr virus in the same oncogenic category as Simian virus
  40 (SV40), human papilloma virus (HPV) and Adenovirus. However, EBV uses EBNA1-induced
  mRNA translation stress to target this growth regulatory pathway whereas HPV, Adeno
  and Simian virus, target the pRb–E2F1 interaction via E6, E1A and Large T antigen
  (LT) and p53 via E7, E1B55 and LT, respectively. The cell cycle kinase inhibitor
  p21 (p21CDKN1A)) is induced by p53 and prevents phosphorylation of pRb and the release
  of E2F1.

  description: MDM2 regulates E2F1 synthesis during EBNA1 mRNA-induced translation
    stress. (A) Model illustrating the stress response pathway induced by dysfunctional
    mRNA translation that via MDM2 induces E2F1 synthesis in a PI3Kδ-dependent fashion
    which promotes cell cycle progression and increased ribosome biogenesis via c-myc.
    E2F1 activates the p14Arf tumor suppressor that prevents MDM2-mediated degradation
    of p53 and MDM2-mediated induction of E2F1 by preventing the MDM2 - E2F1 mRNA
    interaction. This illustrates a novel oncogenic activity of MDM2 and a novel tumour
    suppressor activity of p14Arf. (B) Model illustrating how the oncogenic activity
    of EBNA1-induced mRNA translation stress via PI3Kδ and MDM2 targets the p53 and
    the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) tumour suppressor pathways. PI3Kδ stabilizes
    MDM2 and promotes the MDM2 – E2F1 mRNA interaction that results in an increase
    in E2F1 protein synthesis. This places the Epstein-Barr virus in the same oncogenic
    category as Simian virus 40 (SV40), human papilloma virus (HPV) and Adenovirus.
    However, EBV uses EBNA1-induced mRNA translation stress to target this growth
    regulatory pathway whereas HPV, Adeno and Simian virus, target the pRb–E2F1 interaction

    The cell cycle kinase inhibitor p21 (p21CDKN1A)) is induced by p53 and prevents
    phosphorylation of pRb and the release of E2F1.
