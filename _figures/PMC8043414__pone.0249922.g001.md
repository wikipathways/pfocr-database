caption: 'The metabolites are grouped in different pathways: the glycogen metabolism
  pathway, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and amino acid metabolism:
  BCAA: branched-chain amino acid; AAA: aromatic amino acid; PEP: phosphoenol pyruvic
  acid; MPC: mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; CPT: carnitine palmitoyl transferase;
  OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation. The TCA cycle is the final and universal step
  before the vast amount of ATP is created at the level of the electron transport
  system (OXPHOS). Apart from fat and glucose, also proteins can be catabolized to
  produce precursors of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Amino acids can feed into the
  TCA cycle at acetyl CoA, as well as at steps further downstream from acetyl CoA
  (jagged arrows).'
