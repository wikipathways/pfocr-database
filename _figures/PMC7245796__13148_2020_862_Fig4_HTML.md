caption: Effects of metabolites on post-translational modification of EZH2 protein.
  Post-translational modification of EZH2 requires metabolites to participate. EZH2
  acetylation by P300/CBP-related factor (PCAF) uses the metabolite acetyl-CoA, enhancing
  the stability of EZH2. Acetyl-CoA is synthesized in the cytoplasm and nucleus from
  acetate, citrate, or pyruvate by acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2
  (ACSS2), ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), respectively.
  EZH2 GlcNAcylation is mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) utilizing UDP-glucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) which is generated from the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The stability
  and function of EZH2 is enhanced by O-GlcNAcylation modification. Energetic stress
  can affect EZH2 phosphorylation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  leading to a decrease in PRC2 stability and EZH2 activity
