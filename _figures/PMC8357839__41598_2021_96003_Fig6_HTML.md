caption: Graphical summary of the proposed mechanism of mitochondrial bioenergetics
  rescue and activation of antioxidant pathways by ketogenic diet after SCI. After
  SCI, an increase in ROS production would affect several complexes of the Electron
  Transport System (ETS) leading to a global dysfunction in cellular bioenergetics.
  Treatment with KD would lead to an increase in ketone bodies that would bind to
  specific receptors (i.e. HCA2, FFR2 or unknown). The activation of these receptors
  would trigger phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the increase in expression of Stat3
  and mTOR . mTOR would regulate ribosomal translation and the subsequent synthesis
  of proteins and growth factors that are nutrient-dependent. Simultaneously, an increase
  in VDAC1 expression, might contribute to the translocation of phospho-ERK1/2 (and
  other essential proteins) into the mitochondrial matrix where by binding the mitochondrial
  transcription factor (TFAM) would lead to an increase mtDNA transcription and a
  subsequent expression of several components of the ETS contributing to the mitochondrial
  bioenergetics rescue. Furthermore, the presence of the mitochondrial pools of Stat3
  and mTOR/p70-S6K would contribute to the activation of some of the complexes of
  the ETS and to reduce ROS production inside the mitochondria. KD treatment would
  also increase activation of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant pathway that not only
  would activate expression of antioxidant and DNA repair genes, but whose mitochondrial-associated
  pool might also help reducing cellular apoptosis. Moreover, KBs might act as an
  alternative substrate and promote neuroprotection. Overall, our data indicates that
  KD treatment regulates mtDNA transcription, DNA transcription and ribosomal translation,
  which altogether contributes to the improvement of mitochondrial bioenergetics after
  SCI. Created with BioRender.com.
