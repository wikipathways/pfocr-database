caption: 'Model of bunyavirus-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (Right) In the OFF
  state, β-catenin is sequentially phosphorylated by the destruction complex (DC)
  and targeted for degradation. (Left) When the DC is disrupted by regulation of the
  scaffolding protein axin (via recruitment to the plasma membrane by Dvl after Wnt
  ligand-triggered signaling or by tankyrase-mediated ADP-ribosylation of axin, resulting
  in its ubiquitination and degradation), the signaling pathway is in the ON state.
  In the ON state, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the
  nucleus, where it causes activation of TCF/LEF transcription factor and subsequent
  transcription of β-catenin-responsive genes: cyclin D1, c-Jun, and c-Myc. Results
  from this study with inhibitors that target different stages of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway suggest that RVFV and other bunyaviruses may induce Wnt signaling
  by circumventing the Wnt membrane receptor complex after virus entry, during replication
  (shown with dashed green line, representing proposed mechanism of virus induction
  of the ON state; inhibitors that decreased RVFV infection are shown in red). This
  leads to activation of TCF/LEF-dependent Wnt/β-catenin transcription. Bunyaviral
  replication is dependent on a cap-snatching mechanism where host-derived 5′ ends
  of mRNAs are used to prime viral gene transcription. Previous studies indicate that
  host-derived 5′ ends on bunyaviral mRNAs contain mostly sequences related to cell
  cycle genes. Wnt/β-catenin signaling may therefore be induced during viral replication
  in order to provide pools of mRNAs, particularly cell cycle genes, including cyclin
  D1, necessary for viral gene transcription initiation by cap snatching (dashed black
  line to represent hypothesis). Red lines in the figure represent conditions that
  result in the OFF state (no stimulation, stabilized DC, and inhibitor treatment),
  and green lines represent conditions that result in the ON state of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling (tankyrase activity and virus-mediated induction). For the purposes of
  clarity, Wnt ligand-mediated activation of canonical Wnt signaling is not depicted
  in this figure.'
