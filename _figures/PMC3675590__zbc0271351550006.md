caption: Proposed regulatory role of the phosphorylated isoform of GlgE as a molecular
  switch in α-glucan synthesis in M. tuberculosis. Distinct from the classic glycogen
  pathway, the newly identified GlgE pathway comprises four successive enzymatic steps
  from trehalose to an α-glucan polymer that may contribute to biosynthesis of cytosolic
  glycogen, capsular glucan, and/or methylglucose lipopolysaccharide-related α-glucan
  derivatives. In response to external stimuli, the mycobacterial Ser/Thr kinase PknB
  is autophosphorylated. This induces GlgE phosphorylation (P) on seven Ser/Thr residues.
  As a result, the maltosyltransferase activity of the Ser/Thr phosphorylated GlgE
  is inhibited.
