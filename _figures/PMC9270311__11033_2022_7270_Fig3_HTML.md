caption: Several studies have shown that ginsenosides have anti-tumor activity. In
  tumor cells, ginsenosides could induce exogenous apoptosis via enhancing the expression
  of TRAILs, p53, Fas/FasL, resulting in the activation of caspase cascades (Pro-caspase-8-caspase-3)
  []. Ginsenosides could regulate the JAK/STAT pathway involved in immune regulatory
  processes. They have regulatory roles on P53, Fas/FasL, and Bax []. Indeed, ginsenosides
  via blocking JAK1/STAT3 could decrease the expression of STAT3 target genes, including
  survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL. Therefore, they could increase apoptosis in tumor cells
  via inhibiting the mentioned pathway [, ]. Interestingly, they could inhibit NF-кB
  signaling by regulating Bax/Bcl-2 expression, resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis
  []. Ginsenosides also via blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR could inhibit the proliferation
  of cancer cells and induce apoptosis [, ]. Ginsenosides by decreasing the expression
  of some cell cycle proteins including Cyclin-B1 could block tumor cell cycles [,
  ]. Ginsenosides by upregulating the expression of LC3-II, Beclin-1, and Atg7 could
  also induce autophagy, resulting in tumor cell death [, ]
