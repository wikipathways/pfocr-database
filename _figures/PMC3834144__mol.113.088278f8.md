caption: Schematic summary of OPRM1 differential signal pathways upon acute and chronic
  morphine administration. During acute morphine treatment, OPRM1 interacts with Gαi2
  () and causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and a decrease of the intracellular
  cAMP level. Under prolonged treatment, Src kinase is recruited by the OPRM1 signal
  complex, where it is activated. The activated Src phosphorylates OPRM1 at Tyr336.
  The phosphorylated Tyr336 serves as a docking site to recruit Grb/SOS/Ras and Raf-1,
  which converts the OPRM1 from a classic Gi/Go-coupled receptor into an RTK-like
  entity. The activated Raf-1 eventually phosphorylates and activates the AC isozymes,
  most likely AC5/6, resulting in AC superactivation. By doing so, OPRM1 can lead
  to an alternative signaling pathway that is initiated by the same agonist but is
  different depending on the duration of agonist exposure.
