caption: DHODH inhibitors prevent viral replication. Simplified depiction of de novo
  pyrimidine synthesis pathway and its role in viral replication. A series of enzymes
  catalyse the 6‐step pathway conversion of glutamine, bicarbonate (HCO3) and ATP
  into the final product, Uridine monophosphate (UMP), necessary for the production
  of pyrimidines. De novo pyrimidine synthesis is catalysed by the trifunctional CAD
  (carbamoyl phosphate synthase, aspartate carbamoyl transferase and dihydroorotase),
  DHODH and the bifunctional UMPS (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine
  monophosphate decarboxylase). DHODH catalyses the fourth step, the oxidation of
  dihydroorotate to orotate, and is linked to the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain (ETC) via ubiquinone (UbQ) redox‐cycling. Inhibition of DHODH leads to pyrimidine
  nucleosides depletion that primarily affects RNA virus replication. The decrease
  of pyrimidine pools further triggers host antiviral genes expression and promotes
  innate immune responses. Both responses are a consequence of the reduction of pyrimidines
  and cause inhibition of virus replication and infection. Created with BioRender.com
