caption: Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and signaling pathways as
  potential targets for treatment. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors
  through the S protein resulting in viral-host membrane fusion. Umifenovir and camostat
  mesylate inhibit the fusion process of viral entry. Virus enters the cells by endocytosis,
  and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit the endosomal acidification and interfere
  with glycosylation of ACE2. The viral RNA is released and translated to essential
  viral polyproteins, 3CLpro and PLpro. Lopinavir/Ritonavir inhibits the activity
  of 3CLpro. Viral replication requires the RNA polymerase and remdesivir incorporates
  into nascent viral RNA causing RNA synthesis arrest, preventing viral replication.
  SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a massive release of cytokines including IL6, IL-1β,
  and IL-1 and increases the activation of NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.
  Tocilizumab and sarilumab bind to membrane and soluble IL-6 receptors suppressing
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and attenuating inflammatory processes. Baricitinib
  and ruxolitinib inhibit the kinase activities of JAK1 and JAK2 and anakinra, an
  IL-1 receptor antagonist, reduces hyperinflammation and respiratory distress.
