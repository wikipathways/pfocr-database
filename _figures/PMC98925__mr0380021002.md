  names are in italics, names of enzymes are in capital letters. l-α-AAA is an intermediate
  of the l-lysine biosynthetic pathway but can also be provided by catabolic degradation
  of l-lysine. The question mark indicates that the contribution of the latter to
  β-lactam production has not been clarified yet. The penicillin biosynthesis occurs
  in fungi only, whereas cephalosporins are synthesized in both fungi (e.g., cephalosporin
  C by A. chrysogenum) and bacteria (e.g., cephamycin C by S. clavuligerus) (Fig.
  ). See the text for details.
