caption: 'Gene-vocalization links. MeCyan gene module is the most positively correlated
  module with all female rat acoustic properties. ENRICHR gene enrichment software
  was used to examine gene pathways within this module, as presented here. Data were
  plotted using weight as a factor using Cytoscape 3.3.0 software. The most significant
  connections are plotted using weight as a factor; lines represent significant correlations
  between genes. Colors are indicative of the same enriched pathway: Dark purple (monoamine
  transmembrane transporter activity; dopamine transmembrane transporter activity;
  indolalkylamine metabolic process): Slc6a4, Ddc, Tph2; Light yellow (nervous system
  development, axon guidance/axonogenesis): Gss, Gfra1, Sim1, Scg1; Brown (RNA splicing;
  mRNA processing; peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity): Ppil3, Fkbp14, Wbp11,
  Magohb; Light Purple (neuron migration, axon guidance; generation of neurons and
  depolarization): Sema3a, Ndnf, Runx2, Smad7, Gja5, Rangrf; Light Pink (neuropeptide,
  cell signaling; transcription): Pax8, Pax5, Nts'
