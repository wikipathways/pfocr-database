caption: Rigosertib-mediated cell death pathways (modified from Ritt et al. []). Work
  by Ritt et al. identified the effect of Rigosertib-induced JNK activation on the
  suppression of the RAS signaling pathway and consequent blunting survival and growth
  signals. Our data point to an additional mechanism, which may be even more common,
  linking activated JNK1/2 to the activation of p66Shc, which has been implicated
  in ROS-mediated cell death under various conditions [].
