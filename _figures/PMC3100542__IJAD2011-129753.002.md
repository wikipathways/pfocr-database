caption: GSK-3β in the regulation of microglial phagocytosis. Microglial phagocytosis
  has been shown to be enhanced through activation of TLR2/4 pathway. Binding of Aβ
  to TLR2/4 may result in activation of PI3K signalling eventually leading to inhibition
  of GSK-3β activation. This in turn shifts the cellular balance towards increase
  in the production of antiinflammatory cytokines favouring phagocytic microglial
  phenotype. On the other hand, CD40R-CD40L interaction results in both NF-κB and
  GSK-3β activation thus increasing proinflammatory cytokine production. This may
  shift the phenotype of microglial cells being less capable of clearing Aβ.
