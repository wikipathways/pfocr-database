caption: Proposed models for SRRM4 in driving t-NEPC development through different
  mechanisms. A schematic diagram illustrates two mechanisms of SRRM4 in driving the
  development of t-NEPC tumors. AdPC, prostate adenocarcinoma; t-NEPC, treatment-induced
  neuroendocrine prostate cancer; ARPI, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors; NE,
  neuroendocrine; LE, luminal epithelial.
