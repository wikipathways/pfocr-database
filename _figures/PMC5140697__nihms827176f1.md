caption: 'Cancer cells up-regulate both catabolic and anabolic pathways to optimize
  energy and macromolecule production. Glucose and glutamine are central biomolecules
  that provide cancer cells with most of energy and metabolites required for growth
  and proliferation. Glucose is uptaken by tumor cells through the GLUT1 transporter
  and enters glycolysis. The glycolytic intermediate G6P can be diverted to the pentose
  phosphate pathway to form ribose-5P (nucleotide synthesis) and reducing equivalents
  in the form of NADPH (anabolic processes). Another glycolytic intermediate, 3-PG,
  can be diverted to synthesis of serine and glycine, which can be incorporated into
  proteins or nucleotides, or used as precursors of other biomolecules. Finally, glucose-derived
  pyruvate can be converted to lactate by LDHA, oxidized in the mitochondrial TCA
  cycle or, finally, converted to citrate to fuel synthesis of FAs and cholesterol.
  Synthesis of FAs requires ACC and FASN enzymes while HMG-CoA reductase is the key
  enzyme for cholesterol synthesis. Glutamine enters tumor cells through the SLC1A5
  transporter and is used for protein or nucleotide synthesis, or can be converted
  to glutamate and then α-KG. Finally, α-KG can be either oxidized in the mitochondrial
  TCA cycle, or undergo reductive metabolism to form citrate, thus contributing to
  FA and cholesterol synthesis. Cytoplasmic glutamine can be also transaminated to
  form amino acids from corresponding ketoacids. Arginine and methionine are uptaken
  from the external environment through specific transporters and then used for protein
  synthesis or other purposes.ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase;
