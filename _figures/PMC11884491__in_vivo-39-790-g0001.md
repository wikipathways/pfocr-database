caption: The schematic illustrates the antiproliferative effect of P. indica extract
  and the proposed mechanism through the TGF-β mediated SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2 pathways.
  The extract of P. indica exhibits inhibition of WPMY-1 cell proliferation in both
  primary and secondary screenings. It also inhibits cell proliferation via the TGF-β
  signaling pathway by reducing the expression of both p-SMAD2/3 and p-ERK1/2 proteins.
  It diminishes the expression of PCNA protein, a marker indicative of cell proliferation,
  and impedes cell proliferation
