caption: 'PARP inhibition mechanism of action—blockade of the base excision pathway.
  Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) recognizes and binds to sites of DNA damage through
  its zinc-finger domains and recruits proteins involved in DNA repair through polyADP-ribose
  catalyzation. PARP inhibitors function by trapping PARP to sites of DNA damage and
  blocking the enzymatic transformation required for polyADP-ribosylation. Adapted
