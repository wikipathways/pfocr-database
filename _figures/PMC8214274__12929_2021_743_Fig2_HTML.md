caption: Resolution of replication stress. Impediments to replication fork progression
  lead to the generation of extended ssDNA tracts that initiate replication stress
  response. Recognition of ssDNA tracts by RPA serves as a signaling platform to trigger
  the ATR-CHK1 pathway (a). Once activated, this pathway triggers cell cycle arrest
  by inhibiting late origin firing. At the same time, activated CHK2 kinase acts through
  downstream effectors to promote processes crucial to restarting the stalled replication
  and preventing fork collapse, such as elevated dNTP production, DNA repair and nuclease
  activities. Lower illustrations show schematic representations of how replication
  stress may be resolved by indicated key factors; resolution of UV damage (b) and
  TRCs (c) are depicted
