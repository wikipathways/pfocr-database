caption: Schematic representation of the mutIDH1 and mutIDH2 pathways and molecular
  mechanisms related to oncogenesis. The neomorphic enzyme, mutIDH1/2, converts the
  wild-type IDH product, α-ketoglutarate, to the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2HG) both in the cytosol and in the mitochondria. 2HG competitively inhibits α-ketoglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenases both in the cytosol and in the nucleus. 2HG-mediated inhibition of
  the activity of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes and histone lysine demethylases
  (KDM) result in global epigenetic modifications on DNA and histones, respectively,
  resulting in a hypermethylator phenotype. Inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases and
  lysyl hydroxylases (such as PLOD1-3) interferes with both collagen maturation and
  with the degradation pathway of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α), thereby post-translationally
  stabilizing HIF-1α. Additionally, ALKBH, responsible for repair of oxidative DNA
  damage, is also inhibited by 2HG, an effect which potentially introduces risk for
  increased mutational burden.
