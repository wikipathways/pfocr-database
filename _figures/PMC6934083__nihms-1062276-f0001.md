caption: HDAC inhibitors increase the acetylation of multiple protein chaperones,
  thereby reducing chaperone function. Reduced chaperone function increases the levels
  of denatured proteins, including growth factor receptors and signaling intermediates,
  leading to inactivation of the autophagy master regulator mTOR. In parallel, because
  of the abundance of denatured proteins and the reduced functionality of GRP78, an
  endoplasmic reticulum stress response from PERK to eIF2α to reduced protein translation
  occurs. Reduced GRP78 function also results in activation of the IRE1 ER stress
  pathway which via activation of the c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase pathway can also facilitate
  tumor cell death. Although translation from the majority of genes is reduced, some,
  such as the autophagy regulatory proteins Beclin1 and ATG5 is enhanced. With the
  inactivation of mTOR and increased levels of Beclin1 and ATG5, autophagosome formation
  is enhanced. Encapsulated HDAC proteins in the autophagosome, following fusion with
  acidic endosomes to become autolysosomes, are degraded. Reduced expression of HDACs
  alters the transcription of many genes, notably that the protein levels of PD-L1,
  ODC and IDO-1 decline and that of Class I MHCA is enhanced. In vivo, these changes
  result in enhanced efficacy of checkpoint inhibitory immunotherapeutic antibodies.
