caption: In the progression of colon cancer, genetic alterations target the genes
  that are identified at the top of the diagram. The microsatellite instability (MSI)
  pathway is initiated by mismatch-repair (MMR) gene mutation or by aberrant MLH1
  methylation and is further associated with downstream mutations in TGFBR2 and BAX.
  Aberrant MLH1 methylation and BRAF mutation are each associated with the serratedadenoma
  pathway. The question mark indicates that genetic or epigenetic changes specific
  to metastatic progression have not been identified. Key growth factor pathways that
  are altered during colon neoplasia are shown at the bottom of the diagram. CIN denotes
  chromosomal instability, EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor, 15-PGDH 15-prostaglandin
  dehydrogenase, and TGF-β transforming growth factor β.
