caption: Metabolic features of hPSCs. hPSCs consume glucose for glycolysis, nucleotide
  synthesis, nonessential amino acid synthesis, and hexosamine biosynthesis. The hexosamine
  pathway produces UDP-GlcNAc, which serves as a substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation.
  The entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle is inhibited by reduced activity of PDH
  by PDK. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate to replenish nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+) to maintain glycolytic activity. Pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrial
  matrix, is converted to acetyl-CoA and is utilized for citrate production. In hPSCs,
  the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase 2 is downregulated and conversion into αKG is limited.
  Citrate transported to the cytosol is converted back to acetyl-CoA, which is used
  for histone acetylation, de novo fatty acid synthesis, and hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway. Fatty acids are utilized for various complex lipids, including glycosphingolipids.
  To replenish the latter part of the TCA cycle (i.e., αKG to oxaloacetate), hPSCs
  consume glutamine. Glutamine also plays a key role in glutathione synthesis, the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and the serine synthesis pathway. α-KG is required
  for histone and DNA demethylation. mPSCs consume threonine to produce SAM, but because
  threonine dehydrogenase is a pseudogene in hPSCs, hPSCs consume methionine to produce
  SAM. SAM is used for histone methylation. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; ACO2, aconitase
