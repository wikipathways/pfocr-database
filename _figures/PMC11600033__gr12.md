caption: Schematic diagram of HA/PEI-RH NYPs for UC treatment. (A) The manufacturing
  process of HA/PEI-RH NYPs. (B) HA/PEI-RH NYPs can safely pass through the gastric
  environment after oral administration and release drugs after degradation by the
  gut microbiota. HA/PEI-RH NYPs can target macrophages and effectively enhance anti-inflammatory
  ability through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby exerting anti-UC
  ability [99]. Copyright 2021, American Chemical Society
