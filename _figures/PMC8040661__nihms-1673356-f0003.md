caption: The β-adrenergic signaling pathway. Catacolamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine,
  act on b-adrenergic receptors expressed on normal tissue or tumor cells, which mediates
  activation of adenlylyl cyclase. This results in a transient flux in intracellular
  cAMP resulting in activation of the PKA and MAPK pathways. As a result, transcriptional
  regulators including CREB, AP-1 and Ets family transcription factors become active
  which in turn can modulate the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammation
  and angiogenesis.
