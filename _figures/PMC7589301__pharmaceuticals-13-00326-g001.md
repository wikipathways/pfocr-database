caption: A model of the possible molecular mechanism of amantadine’s antidepressant
  effects at the level of dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission. Amantadine
  indirectly increases the dopamine level within the synaptic cleft due to inhibition
  of the dopamine transporter DAT1 via the blockage of the presynaptic NMDA receptor
  ion channel. The activation of the presynaptic dopamine receptor D2 may also reduce
  DAT1 activity in response to the high neurotransmitter level and/or drug binding.
  D2 is a Gi-coupled receptor, and its excitation causes an inhibition of the adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) activity, decreased cAMP production, and finally, the silencing of
  the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent neuronal signaling pathway. Activation of the
  σ1 receptor can additionally enhance the synaptic dopamine concentration. The σ1
  receptor regulates the activity of several voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and
  calcium channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and some protein kinases.
  Receptor activation causes a blockade of Na+ channels (VGSC), while its interaction
  with K+ (VGKC) and Ca2+ (VGCC) channels may be excitatory or inhibitory. The activation
  of the σ1 receptor results in the enhancement of both NMDA and dopamine D1 receptors.
  Amantadine is able to inhibit monoaminoxidase B (MAO-B), but it does support L-DOPA
  decarboxylase (DCC) activity in the presynaptic neuron. The amantadine-related blockade
  of NMDA receptor function in the glutamatergic neurons causes an upregulation of
  BDNF and TrkB expression via Erk, CamK, PI3K, and PLC signalling cascade. Amantadine
  may also inhibit nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity and decrease neuronal NO
  level. All those neurochemical events are considered to be responsible for the generation
  of the antidepressant effects of amantadine. L-DOPA decarboxylase (DCC); NMDA receptor
  (NMDAR); phospholipase C (PLC); tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB); extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (Erk); brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K); calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamK). Up and down
  thick arrows indicate direction of changes, thin arrows show the course of biochemical
  reactions, lines with dots indicate functional connections.
