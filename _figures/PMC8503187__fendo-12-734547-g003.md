caption: Schematic overview of the ghrelin receptor intracellular signal pathways
  and their known association with Anorexia Nervosa symptoms. Depiction of the current
  knowledge of the respective Gα-protein and β-arrestin actions regarding the Anorexia
  Nervosa-associated ghrelin receptor functions. The lack of a connection of a specific
  intracellular pathway to anxiety and locomotion. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
