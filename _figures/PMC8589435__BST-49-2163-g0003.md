caption: In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is held in a destruction complex
  that includes Dvl, Axin, Ck1, Gsk3 and Apc which results in β-catenin being targeted
  to the proteasome for degradation (A). When present, canonical Wnt ligands (eg Wnt3a)
  bind to frizzled receptors (Fzd) on proliferation-permissible cells which then recruit
  LRP6 and Dvl and release β-catenin from the destruction complex allowing β-catenin
  stabilisation and cytoplasmic accumulation. β-catenin can then translocate to the
  nucleus and binds to the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) transcription
  factor which results in the activation of a panel of genes critical for cell division
  []. R-spondins (Rspo) are important in potentiating this pathway by binding to Lgr5
  and recruiting the Rnf43 ubiquitin ligase which targets the Lgr5–Rspo–Rnf43 complex
  for lysosomal degradation thus preventing Rnf43 from removing Fzd from the cell
  membrane and stabilising Fzd to enhance its availability for Wnt ligands [] (B).
