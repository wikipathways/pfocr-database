caption: Asprosin pathway in the hepatocyte. G-protein-coupled receptors are activated
  and adenylyl cyclase (AC) synthesizes cAMP from ATP that binds to subunits of PKA,
  catalytic subunits will be released, will translocate to the nucleus, phosphorylating
  and subsequently activating the transcription factors. This downstream pathway will
  enhance the hepatic glucose release. Adapted from Romere et al, 2016.
