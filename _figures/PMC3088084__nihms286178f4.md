caption: Therapeutic effects can be monitored using DMR on scant cell populations.
  (a) Gefitinib inhibits signaling via EGFR, ultimately leading to inhibition of the
  mTOR pathway and decreased cell growth. Rapamycin is a direct inhibitor of mTOR,
  leading to similar effects. (b,c) Three cell lines (A431, NCI-H1650, and A549) were
  treated with varying doses of gefitinib (1 to 1000 nM) or rapamycin (0.05 to 50
  nM) for 12 h, and p-S6RP was used as a read-out of drug efficacy. (b) A431 and NCI-H1650
  cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib, although the latter was only inhibited
  by 50%, and A549 cells were resistant. (d) Rapamycin inhibited all cell lines equally.
  Error bars represent the standard error from at least three μNMR measurements.
