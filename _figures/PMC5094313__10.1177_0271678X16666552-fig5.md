caption: 'Metabolic pathways that may be affected by lactate flooding of brain after
  traumatic brain injury. Entry of large amounts of exogenous lactate into a brain
  cell drives the lactate dehydrogenase reaction (LDH) towards pyruvate and NADH production,
  and at the same time co-transports H+ and generates a second H+ that can acidify
  the cytoplasm. Phosphofructokinase (PFK), one of the major regulatory enzymes of
  the glycolytic pathway, is very sensitive to small decreases in pH that inhibit
  its activity. Increased levels of glucose-6-phosphate will enhance its regulation
  of hexokinase activity by feedback inhibition. (Brown lines with a ball at one end
  denote inhibition.) Reduction of the NAD+ availablity will also impair glycolytic
  flux. Lactate flooding-mediated lowering of pH and NADH generation has the potential
  to impair glycolytic, glycogenolytic, and pentose-phosphate (P) shunt pathway fluxes.
  Cytoplasmic NAD+ is regenerated from NADH by the action of LDH or the malate-aspartate
  shuttle (MAS). Note that lactate cannot be oxidized if the MAS is impaired or if
  there is mitochondrial dysfunction. HK: hexokinase; Glc: glucose; Glc-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate
