caption: RNA helicases, the proteins sensing dsDNA and the cross talk between dsDNA
  and dsRNA sensingDHX9 binds to CpG-B DNA through its DUF1605 domain and leads to
  NF-κB pathway activation and proinflammatory cytokine release. DHX36 binds to CpG-A
  DNA through its DEAH domain, resulting in IRF7 activation and IFN-α release. DDX41
  recognizes dsDNA through its DEAD domain and interacts with STING/TBK1 to mediate
  IRF3 activation and type I IFN expression. DDX41 interacts directly with bacterial
  c-di-GMP and cGAMP from cGAS to mediate type I IFN signaling after interaction with
  STING. POL III binds to AT-rich dsDNA or VZV DNA to convert this DNA to 5′-triphosphate
  dsRNA (5′-ppp-dsRNA). 5′-ppp-dsRNA is recognized by RIG-I and interacts with MAVS
  to mediate type I IFN production.
