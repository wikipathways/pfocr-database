caption: In the nucleus, TERT performs both canonical (elongates telomeric ends) and
  non-canonical functions (participates in the regulation of gene expression). Maintenance
  of a normal telomere structure suppresses ATM/ATR signaling and thus reduces the
  activity of p53, a negative telomerase regulator. TERT alone or together with transcription
  factors of NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways stimulates the expression of
  anti-apoptotic factors, reducing the level of pro-apoptotic. In the cytoplasm, it
  diminishes cytosol acidification and prevents the ER stress-response progression.
  TERT contains a BH3-like domain which can probably bind to proteins of the BCL-2
  family and regulate apoptosis. In mitochondria, telomerase reduces the level of
  ROS production and restores mitochondrial function. Additionally, TERT is likely
  to be involved in mitochondrial DNA repair and regulation of mitochondrial gene
  expression. Hence, BCL-2 family proteins are regulated at the transcriptional level
  and by protein–protein interactions with telomerase and p53. Oligomerization of
  proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak leads to the formation of MOMP and the release
  of cyt c, SMAC/DIABLO, AIF and ENDOG from mitochondria. Cyt c in the cytoplasm induces
  apoptosome assembly by interacting with Apaf1 and pro-caspase 9, which leads to
  the activation of caspase 9 and further triggering of the cascade of caspases through
  activation of caspases 3 and 7 and, finally, to cell death by apoptosis. Normally,
  caspases are blocked by IAPs and XIAP, but SMAC/DIABLO released from mitochondria
  blocks them. AIF and ENDOG induce destruction of intracellular contents, along with
  DNA cleavage, followed by activation of ATM/ATR signaling. Apoptosis can also be
  induced by an external pathway from the death receptor and the formation of the
  DISC complex, which can be inhibited by c-FLIPs. The DISC assembly activates caspase
  8, which can either directly trigger a cascade of caspases, or proteolytically cleave
  Bid to form tBid, which triggers the oligomerization of Bax–Bak. The up arrow (red)
  means increase and the down arrow (red) means decrease.
