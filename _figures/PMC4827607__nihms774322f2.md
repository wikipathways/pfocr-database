caption: A model PAS kinase activation and function in S. cerevisiae. Autoinhibited
  PAS kinase can be activated by either growth on nonfermentative carbon sources or
  by cell integrity stress. The activation of PAS kinase by nonfermenative carbon
  source requires the Snf1 protein and may involve the production of a regulatory
  metabolite (star), while the cell integrity stress pathway can be activated by a
  range of cell wall or cell membrane perturbing agents as well as by overexpression
  of Wsc1. Activated PAS kinase then phosphorylates Ugp1, which leads to increased
  cell wall glucan biosynthesis at the expense of glycogen biosynthesis.
