caption: Sre1 pathway in wild-type yeast with a possible mechanism for regulation
  of Sre1-Scp1 transport and cleavage by ergosterol. Scp1 bound to Sre1 has two conformations,
  an active state Y and an inactive state Z. The equilibrium between these conformations
  is rapid and cooperatively dependent on levels of ergosterol in the ER. The active
  state Y is transported from the ER to the Golgi and cleaved to form Sre1N with a
  constant rate coefficient kTC.
