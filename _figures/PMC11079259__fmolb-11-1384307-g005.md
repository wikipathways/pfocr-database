caption: Diagram of metabolic pathway interaction network. Involvement of metabolic
  pathways with differential metabolites in clusters I–III. The pathway analysis was
  performed with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg)
  and the picture was generated by Cytoscape. The bigger node represents more pathways
  connection. Red nodes represent clusters I to III, green nodes represent pclusters
  I to II, and yellow nodes represent clusters II to III
