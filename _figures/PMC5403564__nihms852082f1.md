caption: 'Cartoon showing the multiple inputs regulating the function of a conventional
  PKC. Newly-synthesized PKC is processed by a series of ordered phosphorylations
  that depend on the binding of Hsp90 to a conserved PXXP motif in the kinase domain
  [], the kinase complex mTORC2 [], and PDK-1 (reviewed in []). Phosphorylation at
  three priming sites, the activation loop, the turn motif, and the hydrophobic motif,
  allow PKC to adopt an autonhibited conformation in which the Ca2+-sensing C2 domain
  (yellow) clamps the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate segment (red) in the substrate-binding
  cavity of the kinase domain (cyan), and the diacyglycerol-sensing C1 domains (orange)
  become masked. Upon elevation of intracellular Ca2+, the C2 domain engages on the
  plasma membrane via Ca2+ coordination to anionic lipids and binding of plasma membrane-localized
  PIP2 to a surface on the domain. This positions PKC to bind its membrane-embedded
  ligand, diacylglycerol (DG), an event that releases the pseudosubstrate for maximal
  activation of PKC. This active PKC phosphorylates downstream substrates, such as
  K-RAS, to suppress oncogenic signaling. The open conformation of PKC is sensitive
  to dephosphorylation, with the first event being dephosphorylation of the hydrophoboic
  motif catalyzed by PHLPP; subsequent dephosphorylation by PP2A produces a fully
  dephosphorylated PKC that is shunted for degradation by a proteosomal pathway. However,
  binding of HSP70 to the dephosphorylated turn motif allows PKC to become rephosphorylated
  to sustain the signaling lifetime of the enzyme. Phorbol esters (not shown) bind
  with two-orders of magnitude higher affinity than diacylglycerol (highlighted in
  yellow) to the C1B domain and are not readily metabolized, trapping PKC in the open,
  active conformation and resulting in chronic loss, or down-regulation, of PKC. Novel
  PKC isozymes are regulated by similar mechanisms except their C2 domain does not
  function as a Ca2+ sensor. Atypical PKC isozymes are activated upon binding to specific
  protein scaffolds that tether the pseudosubstrate out of the substrate-binding cavity.
  Proteins indicated in grey are key regulators of the steady-state levels of PKC:
  HSP70, HSP90, mTORC2, and PDK-1 function to increase the steady-state levels of
  PKC by permitting processing phosphorylations, and PHLPP and PP2A decrease the steady-state
  levels of PKC by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of PKC. Targeting any of these
  proteins in cancer treatments will disrupt the balance of PKC signaling.'
