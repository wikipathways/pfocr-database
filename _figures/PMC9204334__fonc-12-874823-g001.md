caption: Potential role of IL-35 in non-small cell lung cancer. 1. Foxp3 targets the
  EBI3 subunit of IL-35 and induces tumor growth and metastasis by activating the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. 2. IL-35 induces the conversion of conventional
  T cells to iTr35 through the STAT1/STAT3 pathway. 3. EBI3 promotes tumor growth
  through the gp130-STAT3 signaling. 4. Tumor-associated macrophages secrete IL-35
  and promote metastatic colonization by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  through the JAK2-STAT6-GATA3 signaling pathway. 5. IL-35 is secreted by Treg cells,
  and IL-35 produced by cancer cells recruits Treg cells and induces tumor growth.
  6. Imbalances between Treg and Th17 cells. IL-35 plays an immunosuppressive effect
  by promoting Treg proliferation and inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation. 7. IL-35
  produced by Treg cells induces the expression of PD-1 and other inhibitory cytokines,
  impairing T cell function in the tumor environment and promoting tumor growth.
