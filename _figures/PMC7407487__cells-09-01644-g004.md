caption: Schematic drawing showing effects of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation
  on the with-no-lysine [K] kinases (WNKs) signaling in the thick ascending limb (TAL;
  left side of the panel) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT; right side of the panel)
  cells. In TAL, CaSR resides in the basolateral membrane. Stimulation of the receptor
  leads to enhanced production of P450-derived prostanoids, which inhibit the rat
  outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK). CaSR-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular
  stores activates calcineurin, thereby suppressing the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase signaling.
  Similarly, CaSR-induced reduction of intracellular cAMP levels may contribute to
  WNK-SPAK/OSR1 inactivation as well. The net effect of CaSR activation is the inhibition
  of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling and suppression of NKCC2 phosphorylation and function.
  In DCT, CaSR may reside both in the luminal and basolateral membranes. The luminal
  CaSR activates the WNK4-SPAK pathway by stimulating PKC and inducing the activating
  phosphorylation of WNK4. In contrast, the basolateral CaSR may suppress WNK4 via
  stimulation of calcineurin or by interfering with Kir4.1/5.1-mediated potassium
  sensing and preventing KS-WNK1 from facilitating WNK4 activity. The net effects
  of CaSR-activation on the WNK-SPAK activity in DCT cells may depend on various modulating
  factors. T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory CaSR effects, arrows show stimulating
  CaSR effects, and dashed arrows reflect attenuation of WNK-dependent NKCC or NCC
  stimulation; the thickness of the arrows reflects strength of effects.
