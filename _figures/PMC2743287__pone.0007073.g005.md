caption: The expression of the genes related to central carbon pathway is schematically
  presented. Three bars from left to right represent the fold changes of gene expression
  in response to valine, glutamate, and glutamine, repectively. Red bars represent
  an upregulation, green bars represent a downregulation, and grey bars refer to messages
  that are not considered to be significantly changed by our cutoff (three-fold).
