caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of cepharanthine. Solid arrows indicate known
  pathways, whereas dashed arrows represent reactions that are either unknown or involve
  multiple steps. 6OMT, norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, coclaurine N-methyltransferase;
  NMCH, N-methylcoclaurine 3′-hydroxylase; 4′OMT, 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase;
  PS reaction, Pictet–Spengler reaction
