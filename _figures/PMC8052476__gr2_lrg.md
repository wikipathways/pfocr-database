caption: Possible pathway of vitamin D-modulated immunity in reducing cytokine storm
  in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) activation for phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2, then the cell type communicates
  with naïve T (Th-0) cells. In serum optimal level of vitamin D, the naïve T cell
  is shifted to T helper 2 (Th2) cell instead of Th1 phenotype and promotes anti-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-10, Il-5 and Il-4 production. The anti-inflammatory cytokines
  decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2,
  and TNF-α mediated by down-regulating Th1 cells response. All of these result in
  an anti-inflammatory reaction and thus, the overreaction of the immune system is
  controlled. However, in deficiency of vitamin D, the adaptive immune response shifts
  towards the Th1 direction and may therefore cause hyper-inflammation/cytokine storm
  (in red colour). Furthermore, vitamin D also decreases Th17-cell responses and the
  differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 type cells via decreasing the synthesis
  of IL-12 which leads to a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  including IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23. Since the macrophage is a very professional immune
  cell that plays a vital role in immunity, the cell is chosen as a representative
  of innate immune cells to describe the mechanism.
