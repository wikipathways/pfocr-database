caption: Signaling pathways associated with CLRs on dendritic cells. CLRs are dominantly
  expressed on myeloid cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. MR, MGL, DC-SIGN,
  Mincle, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, MICL are expressed on cDCs, and BDCA-2 is expressed
  on pDCs, whereas DCIR is expressed on both cDCs and pDCs. Syk kinase/CARD9 pathway
  is activated by some CLRs signaling and mediates cell activation. ITAM-containing
  FcR are associated with Mincle, dectin-2, dectin-3 (MCL), and BDCA-2. Dectin-1 and
  DC-SIGN contain ITAM-like motifs whereas MICL and DCIR contain ITIM motifs in their
  cytoplasmic tails.
