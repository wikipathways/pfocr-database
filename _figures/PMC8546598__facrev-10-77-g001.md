caption: 'A) Normal basal ganglia: The direct pathway consists of striatal medium
  spiny-like neurons (MSNs) expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSN) that project
  GABA/substance P (SP) neurons to the internal capsule of the internal globus pallidus
  (GPi) and the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr). The indirect pathway consists of
  MSNs expressing D2 dopamine receptors (D2-MSN) that project GABA/Enkephalin (Enk)
  neurons to the external capsule of the external globus pallidus (GPe) which then
  projects GABA neurons to the subthalamic nucelus (STN). The STN projects glutamate
  neurons to the GPi and SNr. The MSNs are innervated by dopamine neurons from the
  substantia nigra compacta (SNc) and by glutamate neurons from the cortex. The GPi
  projects inhibitory GABA neurons to the thalamus, and the thalamus projects excitatory
  glutamate neurons to the cortex. The motor cortex also projects glutamate neurons
  to the spinal cord to control movement. B) Basal ganglia at early stages of Huntington’s
  disease (HD): Cortical glutamate neuronal input to the striatum is hyperactive at
  early stages of HD, based on animal model work (R6/2 mice). This causes excitotoxicity.
  D2-MSNs are believed to be more sensitive to the glutamate hyperactivity and begin
  to degenerate first. The diminished GABA/Enk input to the GPe can produce an imbalance
  in the basal ganglia function and increase activity in the GPe which subsequently
  alters activity in the STN. C) Basal ganglia at later stages of HD: Both the cortex
  and striatum show degeneration in later stages of HD. The lost cortical glutamate
  neurons result in hypoactivity in the striatum. Both the D1-MSNs and the D2-MSNs
  degenerate.'
