caption: Signaling pathway induced by Dectin-1. Upon ligand binding, Dectin-1 becomes
  tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src kinases, thereby providing a docking site for Syk
  which initiates downstream signaling. The downstream signaling is effected by molecules
  such as CARD9, Bcl10, and MALT1, which lead to NF-κB activation and cytokine production.
  Dectin-1 can also activate NFAT and noncanonical NF-κB in a CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1-independent
  manner. Stimulation of Dectin-1 with β-glucans can also induce a second Syk-independent
  signaling pathway mediated by the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1
