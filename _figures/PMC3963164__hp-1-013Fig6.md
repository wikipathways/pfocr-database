caption: 'HIF pathway regulation by the PHD enzymes.Notes: HIF-1 can be a substrate
  for any of the three PHD proteins; however, PHD3, which is the most inducible PHD
  under hypoxic conditions, has broader substrate specificity and can hydroxylate
  a number of non-HIF-1α targets.Abbreviations: PHD, prolyl-4-hydroxylase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  transcription factor; OH, hydroxyl group; gDNA, genomic deoxyribonucleic acid; HRE,
  hypoxia response elements; Neg, negative.'
