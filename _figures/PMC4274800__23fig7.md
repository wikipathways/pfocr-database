caption: Skeletal muscle metabolism in control and Acsl1M−/− mice. Exercising control
  muscle. Initial fuels include glucose hydrolyzed from hepatic and muscle glycogen
  and intramuscular TAG. Activation of AMPK suppresses TAG synthesis and accelerates
  mitochondrial FA oxidation, and autophagy releases amino acids, which are exported
  to provide a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis (). As exercise continues, Acsl1
  mRNA increases, and epinephrine increases the supply of adipocyte-derived long-chain
  (LC)-FA, which are activated by ACSL1 and converted to LC-acyl-carnitines (ACs)
  by CPT1 and, within the mitochondria, back to LC-CoA by CPT2. Mitochondrial oxidation
  produces shorter-chain acyl-CoAs and their AC counterparts. Some amino acids that
  arise from protein hydrolysis contribute to TCA cycle intermediates and to acetyl-CoA
  for energy production. Hepatic glucose, now derived via amino acid–fueled gluconeogenesis,
  continues to enter the glycolytic pathway, but the use of LC-FA spares muscle demand
  for glucose. In addition to ACs of different chain lengths that move out of the
  mitochondria into the cytosol, ACs derived from hepatic FA oxidation are released
  into the blood and equilibrate across the muscle plasma membrane. Exercising Acsl1M−/−
  muscle. When ACSL1 is absent, other ACSL isoforms (ACSL?) activate the large amount
  of entering LC-FA. Most, but perhaps not all, of the LC-CoA produced by these ACSL?
  lack ready access to CPT1 and cannot be converted to LC-AC and enter the mitochondria.
  (For simplicity, we have not shown a theoretical pathway by which some FAs might
  be activated by ACSL? and oxidized in the absence of ACSL1 [see ]; these pathways
  1) might provide some LC-CoA at the mitochondrial surface with access to CPT1 or
  2) might provide medium-chain (MC)-CoA in Acsl1M−/− muscle [Supplementary Fig. 4A],
  which can enter the mitochondria without CPT1.) The cell content of LC-CoAs increases
  because of their diminished entry into both oxidative and synthetic pathways. Failure
  to switch to the use of LC-FA for oxidation enhances glucose entry and oxidation
  and increases the use of muscle protein–derived amino acid that is converted to
  acetyl-CoA and TCA cycle intermediates. Fewer amino acids are released by muscle
  to supply the substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis. As a consequence, systemic
  hypoglycemia ensues and the capacity for endurance exercise is impaired.
