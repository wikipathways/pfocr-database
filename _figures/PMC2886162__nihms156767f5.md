caption: SIRT1 is recruited to target gene promoters and regulates the acetylation
  state of histones, transcription factors, and other chromatin-associated proteins
  in an NAD+-dependent manner. Nicotinamide (NAM), a byproduct of SIRT1-catalyzed
  deacetylation reactions, is a potent inhibitor of SIRT1 activity. NAMPT and NMNAT-1
  constitute a nuclear NAD+ recycling pathway that utilizes NAM for NAD+ biosynthesis.
  NAM removal and NAD+ production by NAMPT and NMNAT-1 stimulate SIRT1 activity in
  the nucleus. In addition, NMNAT-1 interacts with SIRT1 and is recruited to SIRT1
  target gene promoters. SIRT1-dependent recruitment of NMNAT-1 to chromatin may produce
  NAD+ for direct shuttling to SIRT1 to support its activity. TF, transcription factor.
  Ac, acetyl group.
