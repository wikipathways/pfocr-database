caption: 'Hypothetical scheme of production and effects of oxidized fatty acids. In
  the oxidized fatty acid pathway (purple arrows) linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic
  acid (AA) in the cytoplasm (shown with an asterisk to indicate the starting point)
  are enzymatically cleaved through lipoxygenases (LOXs) into hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoid
  acids (HPETEs) and hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids (HPODEs) that are further oxidized
  into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs).
  The apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide 4F inhibits production of HETEs and HODEs.
  HETEs and HODEs in the blood bind to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and induce
  intracellular pathways, leading to the activation of transcription repressor retinoid
  X receptor alpha (RXR-α), which inhibits microRNA-193 (miR193) expression. Inhibition
  of miR193 increases HETE and HODE production by targeting the LOX pathway; miR193
  is also secreted in the blood. In the inflammation pathway (red arrows), HPETEs
  and HPODEs, the reactive intermediates of HETEs and HODEs, oxidize LDL, which initiates
  the inflammatory response, including initiating the transcription of monocyte chemoattractant
  protein 1 (MCP-1), monocyte migration, and aggravation of pulmonary arterial hypertension
  (PAH) symptoms. EC: endothelial cells; PASMC: pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.'
