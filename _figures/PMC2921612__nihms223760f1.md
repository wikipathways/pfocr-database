caption: The VHL protein makes a complex with other proteins and targets hypoxia inducible
  factor for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This is an oxygen-sensitive process;
  when the oxygen level is normoxic, the VHL complex targets HIF and degrades it.
  When there is hypoxia, HIF is not degraded and this causes the transcription of
  a number of genes known to be important in cancer, such as vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth
  factor α (TGF-α). Knowledge of the VHL/HIF pathway provides the foundation for the
  development of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of patients with advanced
  kidney cancer. Five FDA approved agents, sunitinib, sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus
  and bevacizumab are currently used in treatment of patients with advanced clear
  cell kidney cancer.() (Adapted from Pfaffenroth, et al.())
