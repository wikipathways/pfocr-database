caption: AIRCr. The human enzyme PAIS catalyzes both the AIRCr and PRASCS reactions
  (green). The yeast enzyme ADE2 catalyzes the AIRCr reaction coupled with ATP hydrolysis
  (purple). The parallel pathway utilized by bacteria is shown in light blue. These
  are the three different ways that different organisms overcome the energy demand
  to produce CAIR from AIR.
