caption: Quercetin induces c-fos gene expression through upstream activation of p38
  and CREB and potentiates the response to UVB, leading to an increase in steady state
  c-fos mRNA levels. Co-treatment with Qu and ascorbic acid blocks p38 and CREB activation
  and reduces c-fos promoter activity (confirmed by the observation that CREB/CRE
  binding is reduced). c-fos mRNA levels are actually increased after treatment with
  Qu+AA as a result of increased c-fos mRNA stability, but the response to UVB is
  completely inhibited. PI3-K, also activated by UVB and upstream of mTOR, is known
  to be inhibited by Qu and with greater efficacy by Qu+AA. Simultaneous inhibition
  of mTOR signaling by Qu+AA prevents c- Fos protein synthesis even in the presence
  of increased mRNA levels. With Qu alone, inhibition of this pathway is less efficacious
  and more transient as a result of Qu degradation, leading to increased c-Fos protein
  driven by significantly increased levels of c-fos mRNA.
