caption: Choline kinase plays a central role in phospholipid metabolism. PtdCho is
  synthesized in most cells via the Kennedy pathway, where choline (top left) is phosphorylated
  by choline kinase. DAG is then added via a CTP-mediated two-step mechanism. PtdCho
  can be metabolized at a variety of cleavage sites by the phospholipase enzymes.
  The products of both the PtdCho catabolic and anabolic steps have important signaling
  functions, which can be dysregulated in diseased tissue.
