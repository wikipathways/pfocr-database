caption: Simulation framework of BrainSim graphically shown. A bird generates behavior
  (left). It does so from the concurrent activity of four (1–4) of five brain regions
  (middle). The fifth brain region has activity, but its activity is not linked to
  behavior. Activity in all five regions concurrently initiates a similar genetic
  regulatory pathway in each region with positive (+) and negative (−) interactions
  for 10 genes (right). Genes 11 to 100 are not regulated by activity or other simulated
  genes. Behavior is modeled to occur immediately after activity, whereas gene synthesis
  is modeled to occur on the order of minutes
