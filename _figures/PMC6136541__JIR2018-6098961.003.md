caption: Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of E2 in epithelial cells. E2

  nucleus where they modulate gene transcription through binding to estrogen-responsive
  elements (EREs) on DNA (5′GGTCAnnnTGACC-3′ consensus sequence). There is another
  type of ER, namely, G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), which binds E2, tamoxifen,
  and ICI 182780 (Fulvestrant). This receptor promotes the activation of epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mediates signaling in breast, endometrial, and
  thyroid cancer cells. This receptor activates signaling pathways in the cytosol
  and at the plasma membrane []. However, most of the molecular targets activated
  by GPR30 located at the plasma membrane during infections are unknown. GPR30 also
  has effects on the IIR associated with nongenomic responses (e.g., nitric oxide
  production). When cells are infected by bacteria, they trigger the activation of
  proinflammatory signaling pathways, mainly depending on TLRs. These pathways (described
  above) promote the production of proinflammatory elements []. However, E2 can modulate
  these pathways, influencing the IIR and decreasing the proinflammatory elements
  by blocking the activation of transcriptional factors, such NF-κB (canonical inflammatory
  pathway), ultimately resulting in the downregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α gene
  expression. In contrast, the E2-ER complex mainly induces the gene expression of
  AMPs, such as defensins, and promotes an anti-inflammatory environment by inducing
  interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene expression. Gene expression regulated by E2 depends
  on the concentrations of the hormone and the interaction with pathogenic bacteria.
  It is well known that E2 reverses the inflammatory effects (association with bacteria
  and proinflammatory cytokines) and promotes an anti-inflammatory environment [,
