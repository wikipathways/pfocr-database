caption: Glucose and glutamate pathways in astrocyte networks and interactions with
  neurons. In addition to a direct pathway to neurons by the extracellular space,
  glucose from blood vessels is taken-up through astrocytic end-feet or through GLUT1
  (Glucose transporter 1) facilitated transport, and by neurons through GLUT3 (Glucose
  transporter 3) transport. In astrocytes, glucose is metabolized to lactate, which
  is exported through MCT1/4 (Mono-Carboxylate Transporter 1/4); lactate is shuffled
  into neurons by MCT2 (Mono-Carboxylate Transporter 2) and participates in the synthesis
  of glutamate, further stored in vesicles until exocytotic release. After neuronal
  firing, glutamate released into the synaptic cleft is removed by astrocytes through
  EAAT (Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter) and recycled as glutamine. This glutamate-glutamine
  cycling and the associated sodium entry consumes energy, which drives astrocytic
  glycolysis and results in lactate production (Pellerin et al., ). Glucose, lactate,
  and glutamate are transferred between connected astrocytes through GJs (Cx30 and
  Cx43; Leybaert, ; Orellana et al., ; Escartin and Rouach, ).
