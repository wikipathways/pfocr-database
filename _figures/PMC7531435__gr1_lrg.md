caption: 'Key Figure. Integrins Promote Exocytosis of Biosynthetic and Secretory Vesicles.Integrins
  connect to the actin cytoskeleton via talin and remodel actin filaments via Rho
  GTPases, formins, and other proteins. Integrins also connect to microtubules via
  a complex of proteins, called the cortical microtubule stabilizing complex (CMSC)
  []. In this way, integrin adhesion sites are linked to the exocytic machinery, consisting
  of Rab GTPases, their effectors, and motor proteins. This machinery ensures the
  outward traffic of Golgi-derived vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins (biosynthetic
  pathway), as well as secretory vesicles, which store proteins that are released
  in response to a specific cue (regulated secretion). Localized exocytosis of newly
  synthesized proteins occurs near integrin-controlled adhesion complexes [,,] and
  is directed from the Golgi by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1, an activator
  of RhoA that is associated with microtubules []. Abbreviations: CLASP, cytoplasmic
  linker associated protein; EB1, end-binding protein 1; ECM, extracellular matrix;
  ELKS, protein rich in amino acids E,L,K, and S; KANK, KN motif, and ankyrin repeat
  domain-containing; KIF21A, kinesin family member 21A.'
