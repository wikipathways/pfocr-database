caption: (A) Schematic representation of GADS-related signaling in T cells. TCR ligation
  induces side-specific phosphorylation of the intracellular chains of the TCR/CD3
  complex. These initial events trigger phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76. SLP-76
  is subsequently recruited to LAT via GADS. This trimolecular complex (LAT/GADS/SLP-76)
  then recruits other modular proteins (VAV, NCK, ADAP, ITK, GAB2, PLCγ). The formation
  of this complex is required for the activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and for the
  cytoskeleton reorganization. (B) Schematic representation of full-length GADS. GADS
  is composed of SH3-SH2 domains at the N-terminus and a C-terminal SH3 domain. These
  are separated by a long unstructured region composed of 126 amino acid residues.
  The SH2 domain of GADS binds phosphorylated LAT; the C-terminal SH3 domain binds
  the adaptor molecule SLP-76; the binding partner and the functional role of the
  N-terminal SH3 domain are still unknown.
