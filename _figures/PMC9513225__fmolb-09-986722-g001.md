caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several ncRNAs in triggering the ROCK1
  signaling pathway in human disorders and malignancies. Overexpression of ROCK1 could
  result in triggering the activation of PTEN and PI3K, leading to PP1 and PP2A upregulation,
  and dephosphorylation of cofilin that could bind to G-actin and translocate to mitochondria,
  and eventually could cause cytochrome c release, caspases activation and apoptosis.
  ROCK1 could also play an effective role in activating and rapidly phosphorylating
  JAK2, which in turn could enhance downstream signaling cascades containing STAT3
  and PI3K. Previous studies have authenticated that several ncRNAs (miRNAs, circRNAs,
  and lncRNAs) could have a crucial role in regulating the ROCK1 pathway in various
  human diseases as well as cancers. All the information regarding the role of these
  ncRNAs in the modulation of this cascade can be seen in –.
