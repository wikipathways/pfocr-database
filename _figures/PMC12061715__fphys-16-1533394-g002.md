caption: Detailed mechanism of GSK3β involvement in reduced protein synthesis. GSK-3β
  is activated during glucocorticoid overflow and muscle disuse, enhancing phosphorylation
  of EIF2B, Rictor and β-catenin, and also directly phosphorylates the Thr 58 site
  of cmy-c, leading to inhibition of the protein translation process; calpain-1(CAPN1),
  matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and PP1 dephosphorylated the GSK3β, leading to
  GSK-3β activation, causing serine dephosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor
  1 receptor and IRS-1 and inhibition of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway,
  which reduces protein synthesis; and inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T-cells
  c3(NFATc3), which inhibits myocyte differentiation and myogenesis
