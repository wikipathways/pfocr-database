caption: Proposed role of AADA in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway and its effect
  on hepatic lipid metabolism. TG is synthesized within the ER lipid bilayer by the
  enzyme of the glycerol-3-phosphate (also termed Kennedy) pathway. AADA hydrolyzes
  newly synthesized DG and provides fatty acids for β-oxidation in mitochondria (Mito).
  The result of AADA-mediated DG hydrolysis is the decreased amount of substrate for
  TG synthesis for cytoplasmic storage droplet formation and for VLDL assembly. AGPAT,
  1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PAPH, phosphatidic
  acid phosphohydrolase.
