caption: Changes in metabolite profiles in PA2-deficient lines (JI 1345 mutant and
  BC lines where the mutation was backcrossed to ‘Birte’) compared with those of ‘Birte’
  at different stages of seed development (10, 20, 30, and 50 DAF, the last refers
  to mature seeds [MS]). Changes in metabolite levels were calculated as the ratio
  between the level in the PA2-deficient lines and the control (‘Birte’) and are listed
  in Supplemental Figure S1. To visualize the changes, significant increases or decreases
  are indicated in red and blue, respectively, within a metabolic scheme (P < 0.05
  using the Student's t test of Excel).
