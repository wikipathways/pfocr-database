caption: Schematic representation of steroid receptor expression in postnatal day
  5–10 developing prostates from oil-treated control rats (A) and neonatally estrogenized
  rats (B). In the normal developing prostate (A), androgen receptor (AR) is the dominant
  steroid receptor in both epithelial and stromal cells. Under the influence of androgens,
  the stromal cells produce and secrete specific paracrine factors that dictate growth
  and differentiation of the gland. As epithelial cells differentiate, AR levels markedly
  increase and ERβ expression is induced. Other steroid receptors are expressed in
  a cell-specific manner and regulate cell-specific gene expression during critical
  developmental windows. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is expressed at low levels in periductal
  stromal cells in the proximal region of the elongating ducts. RARβ is expressed
  in a subpopulation of basal epithelial cells, whereas RARα and γ are localized to
  periductal stromal cells along the ductal length. RXRα and RXRγ are expressed by
  basal cells, while RXRβ localizes to periductal stromal cells. Following a brief
  exposure to high levels of estrogens during the neonatal critical period, the prostatic
  steroid receptor profile is drastically altered (B). AR is absent in epithelial
  cells and is present at very low levels in stromal cells, thus dampening the androgen
  signaling pathway in the developing prostate. ERα is upregulated and expressed at
  high levels in periductal stromal cells along the length of the ducts, and progesterone
  receptor (PR) is induced in those same cells under the influence of estrogen. The
  number of cells expressing RARα and RARβ is markedly increased. Thus, estrogen exposure
  has switched the developing prostate from an androgen-dominated tissue to one that
  is regulated by estrogen, progesterone, and retinoids.
