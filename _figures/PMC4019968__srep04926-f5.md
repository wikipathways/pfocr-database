caption: This model incorporates the findings in this paper (grey) with what is known
  about the Wnt-pathway regarding to BAR-1 (black) and findings reported about DAF-16
  and PQM-1 (red). It is proposed that (transcriptional) activity of the β-catenin
  bar-1 results in a feedback loop, de-activating the Wnt-pathway. Furthermore BAR-1
  activity is needed for a correct developmental program, where bar-1lof shows indications
  of a DAF-16-mediated stress response. The exact level of interaction between BAR-1
  and the insulin pathway remains to be elucidated.
