caption: Hallmark genes of the antiviral response are shown in their cellular context
  with their fold-change regulation in the different biological systems. Details on
  the interaction between nodes are derived from Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  and are given in Table . Parts of this Figure were made with Biorender.
