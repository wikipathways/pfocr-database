caption: Dotted lines reflect newly proposed processes or cellular locations; these
  include the nuclear or cytosolic degradation of nuclear translation products, the
  contribution of immunoribosomes to DRiPs, the uncertainty about the requirement
  of the 19 S regulatory particle of the proteasome in DRiP generation, or the initial
  location of MHC class I/peptide clustering, which is experimentally detected, first
  in the Golgi Complex, but which likely occurs earlier in the secretory pathway.
  Noncanonical ORFs include nonannotated, small ORFs; uORFs; as well as ORFs using
  non-AUG start codons. QC, Quality control.
