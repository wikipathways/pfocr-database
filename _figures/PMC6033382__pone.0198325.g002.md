caption: Pathway analyses of SLEmetaSig100 genes identified genes involving DNA sensors
  and the cytokines constructing an innate immune DNA-sensor model. SLEmetaSig100
  genes are marked in white circles or rectangles. DNA sensors include MB21D1(cGAS),
  multiple TLR genes, TMEM173/STING, and IF16 genes. In the Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway, the stimulation of DNA sensor genes by microbe-derived and/or host DNA
  are positively regulated by MYD88 and TMEM173/STING genes and negatively regulated
  by TREX1 and TREX2 genes. The downstream cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
  genes include NF-kappa B signaling pathway mediated IFNs, inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g. IL1R1), and STATs mediated chemokines (CXCL and CXCR genes).
