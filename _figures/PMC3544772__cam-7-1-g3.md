caption: Figure 3. SLK signaling in apoptosis and cell cycle. (Left) As cells go through
  the cell cycle, SLK can act upstream of Plk1 and Cdc2 to allow progression through
  G2/M. Phosphorylation of Plk1 may be a direct event whereas the effect on Cdc2 remains
  to be tested. (Right) During apoptosis, active SLK can stimulate the p38 pathway
  through ASK1. This results in cytochrome C release and caspase 8 and 9 activation.
  Whether this occurs through direct phosphorylation, remains to be elucidated. For
  clarity, the apoptotic cascade is shown in the G1 phase but the insult could be
  received at any point.
