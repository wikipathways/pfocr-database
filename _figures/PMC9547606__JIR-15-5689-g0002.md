caption: 'Platelets: coagulation cascade cross talk in hemostasis. Primary hemostasis
  refers to platelets’ activation, adhesion, and aggregation at the site of endothelium
  injury. Adherence of platelets onto the exposed collagen takes place in a multifaceted
  process, and as a result platelets form a plug at the vascular injury site. Secondary
  hemostasis refers to the activation of the coagulation cascade. Both the intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways converge into a common pathway and involve a series of sequential
  cleavage and activation of coagulation factors (XII, XI, IX, X, VII, III), ending
  with zymogen prothrombin (factor II) activation to thrombin (factor IIa). Activated
  thrombin catalyzes fibrinogen (factor I) cleavage to fibrin (Ia), and polymerization
  of fibrin monomers into an insoluble fibrin matrix strengthens the clot formation
  around the platelet plug. Fibrinolysis, through the action of plasmin, prevents
  unnecessary intravascular fibrin accumulation and enables the removal of thrombi.
  Protein C (PC), protein S (PS), and antithrombin II (ATII) inhibit the factors Xa/IIa
  and fibrin (Ia) formation. Tests and biomarkers used in clinical and research settings
  for examining the activation of platelets and coagulation cascade include, prothrombin
  fragment F1+2, thrombin time (TT); endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), factor VII,
  P-selectin, fibrinogen, and tissue factor (TF). Fibrinolysis is measured by plasminogen
  activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), plasmin–antiplasmin complex (PAP), and D-dimer tests.
