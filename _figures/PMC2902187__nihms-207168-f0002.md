caption: High-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and
  C. neoformans. (A) Sln1 undergoes autophosphorylation in the absence of osmotic,
  oxidative, or temperature stress. This phosphate is transferred to a phosphotransfer
  protein, Ypd1, which relays it to and inactivates the response regulator protein,
  Ssk1. The presence of osmotic, oxidative, or temperature (heat or cold) stress,
  inhibits the phosphorelay between Sln1, Ypd1, and Ssk1, resulting in unphosphorylated
  and active Skk1, which can then interact with Ssk2/22. This interaction promotes
  Ssk2/22 autophosphorylation, which triggers the MAPK cascade resulting in phosphorylation
  of Pbs2 and Hog1. Phosphorylated Hog1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  to activate transcription factors involved with osmoadaption, resistance to oxidative
  stress, and thermal tolerance. (B) The phosphorelay between Sln1, Ypd1, Ssk1 and
  activation of the MAPK cascade in the human pathogen C. albicans is postulated to
  be similar to that in S. cerevisiae. Phosphorylated Hog1 translocates from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus to activate transcription factors that contribute to C. albicans
  adaptation and resistance to osmotic, oxidative, and temperature stress, as well
  as UV irradiation. In addition to Sln1, there is an unknown osmotic stress response
  pathway that bypasses Ssk1. (C) In the absence of environmental stress, C. neoformans
  Hog1 is constitutively phosphorylated. This has been demonstrated in most, but not
  all, C. neoformans isolates. Phosphorylated Hog1 negatively regulates pheromone
  production, capsule formation, and melanin biosynthesis. In the presence of osmotic,
  oxidative, and temperature stress, as well as UV irradiation, Hog1 becomes dephosphorylated
  by the action of phosphatases facilitating C. neoformans adaptation to these stresses.
  It is unknown if the regulation of the phosphorelay between Tco1/2, Ypd1, and Ssk1
  is similar to S. cerevisiae. (Figure adapted with permission from Bahn YS et al.,
