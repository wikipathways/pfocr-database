caption: A In the canonical pathway, Wnt activates its receptor, FZD, and results
  in the recruitment of the scaffold protein, DVL, and to the cytoplasmic accumulation
  of β-catenin. TRAF2 participates in the TNIK-dependent activation of TCF-4/LEF,
  which forms a complex with β-catenin and activates the transcription of Wnt target
  genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and wound healing. B The noncanonical
  pathway is triggered by the interaction of Wnt5a to FZD5 and ROR1, which promotes
  the formation of the TRAF2/RIPK1 complex and results in the activation of NF-kB
  and the promotion of inflammation
