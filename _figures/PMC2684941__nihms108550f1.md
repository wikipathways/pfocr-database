caption: Cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and calcium-independent phospholipases
  A2 (iPLA2) hydrolyze both diacyl and plasmalogen phospholipids to form free fatty
  acids and lysophospholipids. Thus, these intracellular phospholipases mediate dual
  pathways of cellular activation through the release of arachidonic acid and the
  concomitant production of lysolipids from membrane phospholipids. Remarkably, iPLA2γ
  activity on diacyl phospholipids with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position generates
  2-arachidonoyl lysophospholipids that are unique branch point metabolites in myocardial
  signaling since they can be further processed through an additional bifurcating
  signaling pathway to generate either eicosanoids or endocannabinoids for cellular
  signaling functions.
