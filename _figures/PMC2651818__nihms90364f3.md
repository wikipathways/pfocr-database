caption: (a–e) Shown are the PPP and glycerol synthesis pathway (GSP) (a), along with
  activity motifs identified in four different conditions (b–e). Names in rectangles
  denote catalyzing enzyme; red denotes activation, green denotes repression; values
  denote the time of activation or repression onset. (b) Forward activation of the
  PPP and backward activation and funnel-same-time-activation of the GSP in response
  to a heat shock. (c) Forward-activation of PPP and backward-shutoff of GSP in response
  to menadione. (d) Forward activation of PPP and backward activation of GSP in response
  to diamide. (e) Forward shutoff and funnel-same-time forward shutoff in response
  to de-heating.
