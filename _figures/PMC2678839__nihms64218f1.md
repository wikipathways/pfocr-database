caption: 'Schematic diagram of the VTA-NAc-VP reward pathway, illustrating the actions
  of psychostimulants (including cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine) on extracellular
  DA, endocannabinoids (eCBs), glutamate and GABA in both the NAc and VP, and the
  sites of action of 6 classes of mechanism-based pharmacological agents in development
  for the treatment of psychostimulant addiction, as reviewed in the present article.
  The mesolimbic DA system originates in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA)
  and projects predominantly to the forebrain nucleus accumbens (NAc). DA afferents
  from the VTA and glutamatergic afferents originating predominantly from the prefrontal
  cortex (PFC) synapse on NAc medium-spiny GABAergic neurons, which predominantly
  project to the ventral pallidum (VP). In general, activation of ionotropic glutamate
  receptors (iGluRs) activates, while activation of DA (D2-like) receptors inhibits
  NAc medium-spiny GABAergic neurons. Functional inhibition of the NAc-VP GABAergic
  pathway is believed to play a critical role in drug reward and addiction. Psychostimulants
  elevate extracellular NAc DA by blocking and/or reversing DA transporters (DAT)
  on NAc DA axon terminals, which stimulates the release of eCBs from medium-spiny
  GABAergic neurons, leading to a reduction in release of NAc glutamate and VP GABA.
  Based on this hypothesis and these underlying neural substrates of addiction, it
  is proposed that: (1) blockade of DA receptors, in particular D3 receptors, may
  directly block psychostimulant-enhanced NAc DA transmission and psychostimulant-induced
  reward and relapse; (2) slow-onset long-acting DAT or monoamine transporter inhibitors
  may substitute for psychostimulants by blocking DA or monoamine transport, but with
  pharmacokinetic properties that militate against addiction; (3) GABAmimetic compounds
  (at least that subset with therapeutic potential for psychostimulant addiction)
  may act at GABAergic terminals within the (a) VP (shown) or (b) VTA on GABAergic
  afferents synapsing upon DA neurons (not shown); (4) cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists
  may modulate NAc-VP GABAergic neuronal function by acting on CB1 receptors located
  on both NAc GABAergic neurons and glutamatergic terminals; (5) compounds acting
  on mGluRs may alter psychostimulant action by modulating release of presynaptic
  glutamate and/or the neuronal activity of post-synaptic NAc GABAergic neurons; (6)
  kappa opioid receptor agonists may attenuate psychostimulant actions by inhibiting
  DA release in the NAc; and (7) compounds acting on 5-HT2A and/or 5HT2C receptors
  may attenuate psychostimulant action by modulating DA neuron activity and DA release
  in the NAc. More details are discussed in the text of this review.'
