caption: Regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle pathway by SE in OVX with (CES)/without
  (COS) E2-replacement with respect to their non-SE counterparts (CEN and CON). Note
  that in oil-injected animals (A) the vesicle cycle was altered by SE in all phases
  but only few genes were affected in animals with E2 replacement (B).
