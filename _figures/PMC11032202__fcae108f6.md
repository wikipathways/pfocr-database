caption: Intratumoural heterogeneity informs intertumoural heterogeneity. (Upper left)
  The presence of cytotoxic and effector immune cells leads to better immune responses
  against glioblastoma. In contrast, the abundance of tumour-associated immune cells
  leads to immunosuppression and increased gliomagenesis. (Upper right) Release of
  NLGN3 by neurons and glutamate and dopamine in the neuron-tumour synapses leads
  to calcium influx into the glioma cell, activating signalling pathways that promote
  glioma progression and invasiveness. Glioma cells can release TSP-1 that enhances
  neuronal–tumoural interactions and enforces pro-tumoural signalling. Influx of Cl−
  through GABAergic channels into the glioma cell inhibits progression. (Bottom) In
  well perfused tumour parts, oxygenation promotes HIF1A degradation. As the glioma
  proliferates, it outgrows its vascularization and releases pro-coagulation factors
  that lead to microvascular thrombosis. This causes hypoxia and the release of HIF1A,
  which triggers angiogenesis and increases tumoural perfusion. Tumour cells in perinecrotic
  areas invade areas with better perfusion, increasing invasiveness of glioma and
  decreasing survival. NKT1 (natural killer T cell type 1), M1 (type 1 macrophage),
  N1 (neutrophil type 1), DC (dendritic cell), Th1 (type 1 T helper cell), NK1 (natural
  killer cell type 1), N2 (neutrophil type 2), Treg (regulatory T cell), M2 (type
  2 macrophage), MDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor cell), Th2 (type 2 T helper cell),
