caption: Schematic representation of the D-alanine metabolic pathway in bacteria.
  The primary route of D-alanine biosynthesis in bacteria is via the reversible interconversion
  from L-alanine to D-alanine, a reaction catalyzed by alanine racemase (Alr; EC 5.1.1.1).
  Several Gram-positive bacteria can also favor the synthesis of D-alanine by using
  the D-amino acid transaminase (Dat; EC 2.6.1.21) to catalyze the interconversion
  reaction of D-alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to pyruvate and D-glutamate. D-alanine
  is incorporated into peptidoglycan as a D-alanyl–D-alanine dipeptide, where it is
  involved in cross-linking of adjacent peptidoglycan strands. In S. aureus and many
  other Gram-positive bacteria, D-alanine esters decorate the teichoic and lipoteichoic
  acids of the cell wall.
