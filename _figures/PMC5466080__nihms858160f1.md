caption: Bioenergetic Pathways and neurodegenerative diseases. Glucose is catabolized
  in the cytoplasm to pyruvate through the glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate is used as
  a substrate in the TCA cycle within the mitochondria. The TCA cycle generates the
  intermediates NADH and FADH2. These intermediates enter the ETC at complex I (NADH)
  and II (FADH2). Complex IV (or COX) directly provides electrons to Complex V, driving
  ATP production. The ETC complexes are shown in red. Bioenergetic molecules are shown
  in blue. Glucose utilization is decreased in AD, PD, and ALS subjects. Within the
  ETC, Complex I function is reduced in PD subjects, while Complex IV (or COX) function
  is reduced in AD subjects. ALS subjects show deficits in several ETC complexes,
  depending on the tissue examined.
