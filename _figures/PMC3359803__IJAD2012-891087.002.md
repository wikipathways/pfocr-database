caption: Model of the role of neuronal chemokine (FKN) and neuronal cytokine (IL-34)
  in microglial phagocytosis and neuroprotection. Neuronal cells primary produce chemokine
  fractalkine (CX3CL1; FKN) and cytokine IL-34. Microglia predominantly express its
  receptor, CX3CR1, and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Soluble form
  of FKN (sFKN) is secreted from damaged neurons and promotes microglial phagocytosis
  of neuronal debris through the release of MFG-E8. sFKN also induces the expression
  of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1 in microglia via Nrf2 recruitment and activation
  of the JNK MAPK signaling pathway. The neuroprotective effects of sFKN are also
  mediated in part by activation of ERK MAPK, although the downstream signaling pathway
  has not yet been elucidated. IL-34 promoted microglial proliferation and clearance
  of Aβ which mediates insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression. Therefore, sFKN
  and IL-34 may be an intrinsic neuroprotectant for damaged yet surviving neurons.
