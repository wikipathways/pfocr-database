caption: Working models on the roles of the phosphorylation of the ARR proteins in
  cytokinin-responsive gene regulation in Arabidopsis. In cytokinin signaling, the
  receiver domain of B-type ARRs is phosphorylated by AHPs that acquire the phosphoryl
  groups from the AHK sensor kinases. It is hypothesized that B-type ARRs undergo
  conformational changes upon phosphorylation on the receiver domain, allowing formation
  of a functional dimer of B-type ARR that binds to the promoter regions of the cytokinin-inducible
  genes including A-type ARR genes. Model 1 proposes squelching mechanism of AHPs
  by phosphorylated ARRs, preventing interaction between AHPs and B-type ARRs. Model
  2 proposes formation of the inactive heterodimer of B-type ARR and A-type ARR by
  protein-protein interaction mediated by their highly conserved receiver domains
  that are phosphorylated. Refer to text for detailed descriptions. Red dotted lines
  indicate negative feedback inhibitory pathway. RD, receiver domain; BD, DNA binding
  domain; AD, transcriptional activation domain; H, histidine residue for accepting
  phosphoryl group; D, aspartic acid residue for accepting phosphoryl group; Pi, phosphoryl
  goup.
