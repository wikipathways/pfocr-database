caption: The upper panel depicts a low GPR160 level in DRG neuron characterized by
  histone hypermethylation and hypoacetylation of the Gpr160 promoter region under
  basal physiological conditions. In the lower panel, the intricate regulatory pathway
  of GPR160 in peripheral sensitization of neurons is elucidated. Initially, indeterminate
  intracellular signaling cascades modulate histone hypomethylation and hyperacetylation,
  facilitating the binding of the transcription factor SP1 to the Gpr160 promoter,
  thereby inducing the heightened expression of GPR160. Subsequently, GPR160 instigates
  the reprogramming of neuronal gene expression, ultimately precipitating peripheral
  neuron sensitization and the onset of BCP. The schematic representation encapsulating
  these findings was generated utilizing Figdraw
