caption: A model for CHD8 regulation of G1 length and S phase entry. Loss-of-function
  of a single CHD8 allele shortens the G1 phase of the cell cycle in neural stem cells
  by relieving transcriptional repression of the MAPK pathway and cyclins E. Truncated
  G1 causes overproliferation of cortical progenitors by accelerating the cell cycle
  and by promoting self-renewing divisions at the expense of neurogenic ones.
