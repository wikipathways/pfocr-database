caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathway mediated by CBD in SH-SY5Y
  cells. At 10 µM, CBD activates autophagy, resulting in the accumulation of LC3-II
  and increased presence of LC3-positive puncta. AM 251, AM 630 and CPZ antagonists
  abrogated the observed LC3-II accumulation, thus implicating canonical cannabinoids
  (CB1 and CB2) and TRPV1 receptors in CBD-mediated autophagy. Additionally, CBD activated
  the ERK1/2 signaling cascade by increasing phosphorylation at Tyr204/Thr202 after
  10 min of CBD treatment but suppressed the PI3K/AKT pathway by reducing AKT phosphorylation
  at S473. On the other hand, CBD treatment did not change AMPK phosphorylation at
  Thr172 or the phosphorylation levels of autophagy-related proteins ULK1 (Ser757)
  and p70S6K (Thr389). In conclusion, our findings suggest that CBD-induced autophagy
  activation is dependent on ULK1 and occurs in an mTORC1 independent-manner. Furthermore,
  the effects on the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways, which regulate cell survival and
  proliferation, indicate that CBD could elicit neuroprotective actions. The illustration
