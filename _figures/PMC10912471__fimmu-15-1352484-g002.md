caption: Roles of Notch signaling pathway in tumor immune microenvironment. Notch
  signaling can affect the activity of various immune cells within tumor microenvironment.
  Notch signaling suppresses PMN-MDSC production and induces MDSC expansion, contributing
  to tumor immunosuppression. Intriguingly, PMN-MDSCs can elicit Jag/Notch signal
  transduction pathway in cancer cell. The crosstalk between cancer cells and PMN-MDSCs
  finally enhances cancer metastasis. Notch signaling play dual roles in regulating
  T cell-mediated immune responses in cancer. Notch pathway can affect TAM recruitment
  and polarization. Cancer cells trigger the activation of Notch signaling in endothelial
  cells, which mediates the education of TAMs by cancer cells. This leads to formation
  of immunosuppressive microenvironment and impairment of T cell-mediated immunity.
  Notch activation reduces the intratumoral infiltration of NK cells, while it has
  opposite effects on Treg frequency and activity. Notch signaling leads to IL-17-driven
  inflammation via Th17 recruitment. Notch signaling mediates the communication between
  cancer cells and CAFs. On one hand, activated Notch pathway in CAFs causes compromised
  antitumor immunity and supports cancer development. On the other hand, increased
  activity of Notch pathway in CAFs can inhibit cancer progression. Cancer cells attract
  neutrophils into tumor microenvironment and motivate Notch signaling in recruited
  neutrophils. Notch-activated neutrophils suppress the cytotoxic activity of CD8+
  T cells. Notch signaling fosters DC terminal differentiation and drives antigen
  cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. Consequently, Notch-primed DCs retard cancer
  progression. Notch mutation is associated with a decline in B cell population in
  tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Notch activation upregulates immune checkpoints
  (PD-1 and PD-L1) to blunt adaptive antitumor immunity. MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor
