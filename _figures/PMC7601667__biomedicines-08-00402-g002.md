caption: Cross-link between EMT-induced signalling pathways and Autophagy-inducedsignalling
  pathways. EMT-mediated signalling pathway includes Notch, TGF-β, receptor tyrosine
  kinases, Wnt, and inflammatory pathways. TGF- β signalling complies with SMAD2 and
  SMAD3to lead to EMT. TGF- β signalling also activates PI3K-mTOR-AKT-GSK3b pathway
  to induce EMT. Wnt signalling drives EMT through GSK3β inhibition and β-catenin
  stabilization. Wnt, Notch and inflammatory pathways induce EMT by activation of
  EMT transcription factors, including SNAI1, β-catenin, Twist and Slug. Receptor
  tyrosine kinases activate PI3K-ATK pathway via activation of growth factors, such
  as EGF, VEGF and FGF. Autophagy triggers EMT by up-regulating mesenchymal markers
  including vimentin and Twist and down regulating epithelial marker E-cadherin through
  Beclin-1 pathway. Beclin-1 pathway can activate autophagy to suppress EMT via down-regulating
  EMT transcription factors, such as ZEB1 and inhibiting Wnt and NF-κB pathway. P53
  inhibits EMT by decreasing the expression of EMT transcription factors, such as
  ZEB1/ZEB2, Snail.
