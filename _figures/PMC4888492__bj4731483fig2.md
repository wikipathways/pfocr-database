caption: Insulin signalling through Akt1 and FOXO1 can enhance FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis
  and, similarly, FSH acting through Akt1 can enhance insulin-stimulated glucose transport
  leading to increased flux through the hexosamine pathway and to the inhibition of
  aromatase. Thus insulin can interact with FSH to stimulate P4 and inhibit E2 production.
  Likewise, FSH acting via mTOR and/or ERK can enhance cell proliferation and protein
  synthesis, cell proliferation and, acting via Akt1 and FOXO3a, it can inhibit apoptosis.
  The FSH-stimulated FOXO1 pathway appears to have stage -specific effects in follicles;
  in small follicles granulosa cell proliferation is stimulated, in antral follicles
  it is steroidogenesis that is stimulated and, at ovulation, atresia is stimulated
  in non-ovulatory follicles. Stimulatory connections are shown in black and inhibitory
  ones are shown in red.
