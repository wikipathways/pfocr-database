caption: '*Glucose induction could cause the inflammation and oxidative stress on
  mesangial cells. Cells inflammation induce the level of TNF-α, as oxidative stress
  increases the level of MDA on the cells, and cells fibrosis increase the level of
  TGF-β1. The increase of TGF-β1 level induce the expression of R-SMADS and Co-SMADS,
  while repress the I-SMADS expression. On glucose-induced mesangial cells, quercetin
  therapy reduced the levels of TGF-B1, TNF-A, and MDA. As it represses TGF-1, quercetin
  also reduces SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, and increases SMAD7 expression. R-SMADS: receptor-regulated
  SMADS (SMAD 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8). C0-SMADS: common-mediator SMADS (SMAD4). I-SMADS:
  Inhibitor SMADS (SMAD 6 and 7).'
