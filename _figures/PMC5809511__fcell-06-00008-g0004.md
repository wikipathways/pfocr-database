caption: Non-canonical Wnt signaling at the primary cilium. Non-canonical Wnt ligands
  bind to Frizzled 3 (Fzd3) receptor, which triggers asymmetric localisation of Vangl2
  in the cell. This pathway acts through Dvl to activate RhoA, and the JNK pathway,
  to stimulate Ca2+ release to stimulate remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This
  is dependent upon correct definition of cell polarity by basal body migration to
  the apical cell surface. This migration is regulated by Dvl, by transition zone
  proteins meckelin (TMEM67) and TMEM216 and by basal body protein MKS1. Inversin
  also plays a role.
