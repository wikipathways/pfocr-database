caption: A, Classical ER membrane-associated and nuclear-associated signaling. B,
  Signaling pathways for the novel membrane ER (mER). 1) Estrogen can activate the
  classical ER-mediated (ERα/β) pathways leading to changes in mRNA transcription
  of relevant genes via ERE. 2) Both ERs are regulated by STX, and may be a mechanism
  for the interaction of classical ER and mER signaling. 3) Estrogen can bind to membrane-associated
  classical ER leading to the activation of signal transduction pathways to control
  gene transcription and cellular functions. The putative mER is a G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) linked to Gq/11 protein that activates PLC-PKC-PKA pathway may control
  gene transcription via pCREB-CRE. The activation of PKC can also lead to changes
  in gene transcription via the phosphorylation of other signaling proteins (MAPK/ERK).
  4) The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) may also initiate calcium-dependent signaling molecules (CaM/CaMK) to control
  transcription. Several of these genes are associated with cation and anion channels
  (Cav3.1, GLR) or proteins that impinge on channel functions (AKAP). 5) Changes in
  neuronal excitability either by channel expression or channel modulation may also
  control gene expression. A few of the genes analyzed by qPCR are involved in calcium
  signaling (CaMK II) and protein trafficking (GEC1).
