caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism of the
  ointment base for Ya-Samarn-Phlae tulle-gras dressings (YaSP) in carrageenan-induced
  paw edema in rats. Carrageenan induces inflammation by activating the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which triggers the production of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β,
  iNOS, COX-2). Additionally, activated mast cells release histamine, leading to vascular
  changes and leukocyte recruitment. Leukocytes contribute to inflammation by releasing
  MPO, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species, resulting in lipid peroxidation
  (increased MDA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Treatment with YaSP effectively
  suppresses inflammation by inhibiting critical inflammatory enzymes and mediators
  (MPO, NO, MDA, PGE2, iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β)
