caption: Schematic illustration of the roles of FTO in obesity and tumorigenesis/drug
  response. (A) As the m6A demethylase, FTO post-transcriptionally regulates expression
  of its critical target genes and thereby contributes to obesity (through affecting
  adipogenesis and food intake) and cancers (including tumorigenesis, cancer cell
  growth, migration, and drug response). MA, meclofenamic acid; R-2HG, 2-hydroxyglutarate;
  EGCG, Epigallocatechin gallate; (B) FTO regulates the development and progression
  of obesity and cancer through the mTOR or adipofactor-mTOR pathway.
