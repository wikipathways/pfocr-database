caption: 'Smad-mediated signaling occurs in association with nascent clathrin-dependent
  endosomal compartments, while receptor-induced non-Smad signaling pathways emanate
  from caveolar compartments or are not yet known to associate with either type of
  compartment. TGF-β-induced ERK/MAPK pathway activation occurs in caveolar lipid
  raft compartments and requires ShcA. TGF-β-induced PI3K-AKT signaling has also been
  shown to emanate from caveolar lipid raft compartments and to require ShcA, raising
  the possibility that both pathways initiate from the same receptor complexes. However,
  TGF-β-induced AKT activation was also shown in different cells to require TRAF6
  and to not require the TβRI kinase activity, suggesting that it initiates from different
  receptor complexes, as shown. TGF-β-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activation has been
  shown to require TRAF6 and to be initiated by TAK1 activation, while TGF-β-induced
  p38 MAPK activation has been localized to cholesterol-rich lipid raft compartments,
  suggesting the existence of distinct complexes for TGF-β-induced p38MAPK, JNK and
  NFκB signaling, as shown. Whether Smad7 association with the type I receptor facilitates,
  is required for or antagonizes TGF-β-induced p38 MAPK activation is unclear because
  of seemingly conflicting reports.Credit: Veronica Falconieri Hays/Science Signaling'
