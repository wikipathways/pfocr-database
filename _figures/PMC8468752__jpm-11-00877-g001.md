caption: 'Scheme representing the cholesterol metabolism pathway and pharmacological
  targets for classical and novel lipid-lowering therapies (generated with BioRender.com).
  Unique hepatic and intestinal transporters (ABCG5 and ABCG8) release bile acids,
  phospholipids, and cholesterol into the biliary system. Inversely, the NPC1L1 protein
  modulates cholesterol returning to hepatocytes. Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol entry
  into the intestine and liver by the NPC1L1 transporter. Next, chylomicrons are generated
  through the assembly of TG, cholesterol, and ApoB-48, and released into the blood
  circulation (see intestinal lipoproteins pathway). The speed-limiting enzyme of
  endogenous cholesterol synthesis, HMGCR (see hepatic lipoproteins pathway), is inhibited
  via statins. The activated bempedoic acid decreases the hepatic synthesis of acetyl
  CoA and cholesterol catabolism by blocking the ACL protein. ApoB-100, phospholipid,
  ApoC-III, and cholesterol assembly into VLDL depends on the activity of MTP, which
  is blocked by lomitapide. The degradation of hepatic messenger ribonucleic acid
  (mRNA) transcript of ApoB-100 and ApoC-III is mediated by mipomersen and gemcabene,
  respectively. The heteroexchange of TGs and cholesteryl esters between ApoB-lipoproteins
  particles relies on CETP activity, which is blocked by CETP inhibitors such as anacetrapib.
  LDLR interacts and removes LDL-cholesterol from the blood circulation with the assistance
  of LDLRAP1. Lysosomal catabolism of LDLR is mediated by PCSK9. Anti-PCSK9 antibodies,
  including evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran inhibit the endogenous production
  and release of PCSK9. Evinacumab blocks the inhibition of hepatic lipoprotein lipase
  activity by ANGPTL3. Abbreviations: ApoB-48/100, Apolipoprotein B protein member
