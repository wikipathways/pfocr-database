caption: 'Molecular mechanisms involved in the modulation of follicular regulatory
  T cells. Tfr cells monitor B cells both through cell: cell contact and cytokines.
  Tfr cells can alter vital signal pathway in B cells, such as mTOR and Myc pathways,
  and trigger epigenetic modification. CTLA-4 mediates the suppressive function of
  Tfr cells without altering the expression of B7-1 or B7-2. Besides, Tfr cells may
  regulate GC B cells in a TGF-β-dependent way. On the contrary, PD-1 can inhibit
  the repressive function of Tfr cells. PD-1 reduction in Tfr cells triggers a strong
  TCR signal, leading to a substantial stop signal which prolongs the communication
  of B cell with Tfr cells. IL-10 form Tfr cells exerts positive functions on the
  GC response. IL-10 can promote the production and nuclear translocation of FOXO1.
  Elevated FOXO1 activate the transcription of multiple genes. cytotoxic Tfh cells
  secrete abundant granzyme B, which could demolish GC B cells. Tfr cells are capable
  of suppressing cytotoxic Tfh cells and sustaining the homeostasis of the GC response.
  Neuritin from Tfr cells is absorbed by B cells and then triggers phosphorylation
  of proteins like lRS1 and 4E-BP1, augments the expression of Bcl-6 and downregulates
  the expression of Blimp-1 on GC B cells to suppress the maturation of GC B cells,
  prevent the formation of self-reactive B cells and prevent class switch recombination
  (CSR) to IgE.'
