caption: Metabolic pathway for the metabolism of molinate. This figure shows the routes
  of metabolism of molinate, in principle similar metabolism has been shown with the
  other five thiocarbamates used in this study. Namely C-oxidation, S-oxidation and
  formation of glutathione conjugates, see references in the text.
