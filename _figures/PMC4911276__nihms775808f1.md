caption: In this diagram, part of the MET gene is depicted on the left in Figure 1A.
  This portion of the gene includes exons 13, 14, and 15, and introns 13 and 14. DNA
  is transcribed into pre-mRNA, and introns are spliced out (orange triangles) by
  normal splicing mechanisms. This process involves the recognition of specific regions
  along the intron including as 5′ and 3′ splice sites. mRNA is eventually translated
  into the MET receptor protein. The transmembrane MET receptor is depicted in Figure
  1A on the right. Binding of the ligand HGF (red) results in downstream pathway activation
  and increased cellular proliferation. MET exon 14 encodes a region on the receptor
  (green) that includes the Y1003 residue. This residue serves as a binding site for
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL (purple). Ubiquitination tags the MET protein for degradation.
  In Figure 1B, MET mutations (yellow) that disrupt the branch point and/or 3′ splice
  site of intron 13, and the 5′ splice site of intron 14 result in aberrant splicing
  and exon 14 skipping. These mutations normally occur separately (involving a region
  flanking only one end of exon 14), but are shown here in aggregate for simplicity.
  MET exon 14 is thus excluded in mRNA that is later translated into a protein product
  lacking the Y1003 residue. Loss of this region leads to leads to decreased MET receptor
  ubiquitination by CBL. Decreased degradation results in oncogenesis driven by increased
  levels of MET. Of note, base substitutions involving Y1003 or exon 14 deletions
  that span the area encoding this residue can likewise lead to decreased MET degradation
  without specifically interfering with normal splicing mechanisms.
