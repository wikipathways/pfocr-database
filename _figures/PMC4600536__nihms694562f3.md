caption: The IGF1R is comprised of two α and 2 β subunits. On binding to IGF1, the
  cytoplasmic portion of the β subunits undergo phosphorylation at specific tyrosines,
  forming binding sites for a number of signaling molecules. The Shc/Grb2/SOS complex
  activates Ras leading to activation of the MAPK pathway. ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  enables these molecules to enter the nucleus to activate various transcription factors
  such as Jun/Fos. IRS-1 when phosphorylated can facilitate the activation of PI3K
  that leads in turn to PIP2 phosphorylation to PIP3, which brings PDK2 and AKT to
  the membrane where AKT is phosphorylated and activated. AKT has a number of substrates
  including BAD that when phosphorylated inactivates this proapoptotic molecule, mTOR
  which stimulates protein synthesis by activating p70sk6, and FOXO which when phosphorylated
  is prevented from entering the nucleus and stimulating various ubiquitin ligases
  such as atrogin-1/MAFbx. AKT can also phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3β, an important
  regulator of wnt/β-catenin signaling.
