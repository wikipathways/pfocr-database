caption: Schematic diagram of a theoretical pancreatic endocrine tumor cell, smooth
  muscle cell (pericyte) or endothelial cell demonstrating the sites and mechanism
  of action of novel agents for the management of metastatic PETs. These cellular
  components of PETs all exhibit surface growth factor receptors (e.g., VEGFR, PDGFR,
  IGF-1R, c-KITR, etc) which when occupied by their respective growth factors (in
  an autocrine or paracrine manner) lead to autophosphorylation of the intracellular
  tyrosine kinase component of the receptor. Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation activates
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (amongst others) ultimately promoting protein synthesis,
  cell cycle progression and cell survival which causes increased cellular proliferation,
  inhibition of apoptosis, cellular invasion, metastasis and tumor angiogenesis. This
  pathway can be inhibitied by monoclonal antibodies to growth factor receptors, tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors with specific activity against various growth factor receptors,
  or downstream mTOR inhibitors. Whilst mTOR inhibitors are active against both the
  tumor directly as well as its blood supply, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antibodies
  directed against specific growth factors may predominantly effect the tumor itself
  or secondarily inhibit tumor cell growth by altering its blood supply-.
