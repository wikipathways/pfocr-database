caption: Schematic representation of rhizobial mutualism and plant immunity modulation.
  Root exudates recruit Rhizobium to the plant root. Flavonoids activate the nod gene
  transcription factor NodD and enhance nod factor (NF) production and ttsI expression.
  TtsI expression results in effector molecule production that suppresses the host
  defense signals. Some effector molecules cause effector-triggered immunity (ETI)
  in the host. Intracellular receptor for NLR recognizes the effector and activates
  ETI. NF induces root nodule formation and successful Rhizobium–plant association
  after interacting with their host receptors (Nod factor receptors, NFRs or Nod factor
  perception, NFPs). Upon recognition of rhizobial flagellin [microbe-associated molecular
  patterns (MAMPs)], pattern recognition receptors (PRR) induce microbe-associated
  molecular pattern-triggered immunity (MTI); however, NF partially suppresses microbe-associated
  molecular pattern-triggered immunity (MTI) by affecting salicylic acid (SA) production
  via hormonal cross talk. The plant recognizes Rhizobium as a pathogen and induces
  MTI, which results in ethylene (ET)-, and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defenses.
  Bacteria secrete 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase enzyme to
  target the precursor of ET and suppress ET production, thereby affecting ethylene-induced
  defense. Rhizobium association does not affect the JA-dependent signaling pathway,
  indicating its major role in induced systemic resistance (ISR) and conferring immunity
  in distal as well as local cells.
