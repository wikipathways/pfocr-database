caption: The biological effect of IL-22. (A) The protective role against microorganisms
  including bacterial and fungal. The induction of various antimicrobial peptides,
  like psoriasis (S100A7), calgranulin-A (S100A8), calgranulin-B (S100A9), β-defensin-3
  (mβD3), and lipocalin-2. (B) The protective role in promoting regeneration. IL-22-mediated
  regenerative function by activation of JAK-STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. After
  the onset of AKI, TLR4-IL-22 signaling is a specific stimulus for IL-22 induction.
  Other than that, activation of STAT3 and AKT can be detected after I/R, followed
  by an increase in Bcl-2 levels and a decrease in Bad levels. (C) The protective
  role in the inhibition of oxidative stress. It may promote renal repair through
  the active expression of renal reprogramming PFBFK3 by IL-22 mainly inducing STAT3-AMPK/AKT
  signaling after injury, slowing down the accumulation of reactive oxygen radical
  ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can further protect renal function
  by inhibiting the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway. (D) The pathological
  effects in recruiting chemokines. The involvement of IL-22 in the induction of CCL2
  and CXCL10, which promotes the infiltration of macrophages to dampen kidney inflammation.
  (E) The pathological effects in inducing chronic renal anemia. IL-22 exacerbates
  anemia through inducing erythropoietin apoptosis and hepcidin production.
