caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms of action of ABZ and OTS co-delivered
  by lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles via dual-targeting PD-L1 and
  FA receptor. (A) Endosomal/lysosomal escape of OTS-ABZ-LCP nanoparticles with acid-triggered
  ABZ and OTS964 release; (B) tubulin polymerisation inhibition by ABZ; (C) oxidative
  stress of mitochondria (such as ⋅OH radicals) induced by ABZ and OTS964; and (D)
  TOPK pathway inhibition by OTS964.
