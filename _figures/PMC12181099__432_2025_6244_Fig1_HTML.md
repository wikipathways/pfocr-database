caption: 'Interactive effects of MSC and AML cells on each other. This schematic illustration
  highlights the inhibitory and supportive effects of MSCs on leukemia cells. The
  blue lines represent supportive effects that promote the survival and proliferation
  of AML cells, while the red lines indicate the inhibitory roles of these cells on
  AML. (A) MSCs promote AML cell survival through the secretion of cytokines IL-6
  and IL-8, leading to increased BCL-2 and activation of C-myc and Notch in AML cells.
  Additionally, MSCs can enhance AML cell survival by hyper methylating PITX2 and
  HOXB6 and hypomethylating HOXA3 and HOXA5. On the other hand, MSC-derived EVs can
  activate pro-apoptotic genes (Bid and Bax) and reduce BCL-2. Conversely, AML cells
  secrete IL-6 and TNF-α, which increase surface markers and chemokines, including
  CD271, CD49e, CD44, CXCL1, CXCL8, and CXCL12, on MSCs. (B) Leukemia cells secrete
  IL-6 and GM-CSF, inducing the differentiation of MSCs into MDSCs. Leukemic cells
  also upregulate the expression of PDL-1 and CTLA4, ultimately leading to the inhibition
  of T cells and immune evasion of AML cells, which plays an inhibitory role in AML
  cell proliferation and survival. (C) MSCs support AML cells by affecting various
  immune system cells. Through the secretion of IDO on T cells, MSCs decrease tryptophan
  in these cells. By secreting PGE-2 on NK cells, they reduce INF-γ levels in the
  tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β increases
  Treg cells, which suppress NK and CD8 + T cells, contributing to greater AML cell
  survival. (D) MSCs exert various effects by differentiating into cells such as macrophages,
  DCs, and adipocytes. Macrophages and DCs play inhibitory roles, while adipocytes
  support AML cells by reducing METTL3. MSCs also decrease the WNT signaling pathway
  in the tumor microenvironment by releasing the DKK-1 protein, leading to cell cycle
  arrest through decreased C-myc and CyclinD2 and increased P21CIP1 and P27KIP1. Moreover,
  MSCs release exosomes that elevate ROS levels and reduce lncRNAs, including HOTAIR,
  H19, and MALAT4, thereby suppressing leukemia cells. Abbreviation: BCL-2, B-cell
