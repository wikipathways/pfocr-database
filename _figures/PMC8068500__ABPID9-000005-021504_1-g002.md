caption: 'Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the heart. The left panel represents
  the main activators (in green), signaling pathways (in blue) and transcription factors
  (in purple) that control the EMT process in the heart. The middle panel is a schematic
  of the EMT during development, and how it contributes to the generation of other
  cardiac cells types in the heart (brackets represent a minor population). The right
  panel shows cardiac EMT in adult hearts. In adults, EMT is triggered after cardiac
  diseases such as acute myocardial infarction. After suffering from myocardial infarction,
  epicardial cell undergo EMT. However, epicardial cells are in a different state
  compared to development (blue vs yellow colors). Although EMT is a normal process
  in the neonatal heart (indicated by thick arrow), it is not as efficient and common
  in the adult. Moreover, adult EMT mainly give rise to fibroblasts, whereas the other
  potential cell products are scarce. Tβ4: thymosin β4. BMP: bone morphogenetic proteins.
  TGFβ: tumor growth factor β. TRKa: tyrosine kinase receptor activators. NOTCHa:
  NOTCH signaling pathway activators. IL-6: interleukin 6. Wt1: Wilms'' tumor suppressor
  gene1 protein. STE20a: sterile 20-like protein kinase activators. Figure created
  with BioRender.com.'
