caption: COP1 acts as a central repressor in light signaling pathway by interacting
  directly with photoreceptors to mediate different light-regulated plant developmental
  processes. (A) In darkness, nuclear localized COP1 targets positive regulators,
  such as transcription factors HY5 and R2R3 MYBs, for ubiquitination and subsequent
  protein degradation through a 26S proteasome pathway. (B) In visible light, interaction
  with activated photoreceptors repress function of COP1 that is subsequently exported
  from nucleus allowing nuclear-localized transcription factors to accumulate and
  induce gene expression in light-regulated processes. The expression of structural
  flavonoid genes is directly regulated by R2R3 MYB transcription factors which may
  be regulated by bZIP transcription factor such as HY5. During the process, photoreceptors
  are ubiquitinated by COP1 and targeted for degradation (Lau and Deng, ).
