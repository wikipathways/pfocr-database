caption: Proposed model for the regulation of rhizoferrin levels via the cAMP-PKA
  pathway in M. lusitanicus. Presence of organic nitrogen (peptone) or high levels
  of glucose possibly stimulated the enzymatic activity of adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1)
  and inhibited phosphodiesterase (Pde2), eventually inducing the generation of high
  levels of cAMP, which binds to PkaR1 (regulatory subunit 1) of PKA (protein kinase
  A), thereby activating catalytic PKA (PkaC unknown). This stimulates fermentative
  metabolism and decreases oxidative metabolism, which negatively regulates reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production and decreases the mRNA levels of Rfs, probably via
  the transcriptional regulation of SreA and Yap1. Lower oxidative metabolism correlates
  with the downregulation of citrate synthase 1 (cit1) and ornithine decarboxylase
  (spe1), which synthetize Rfs substrates. This leads to lower levels of rhizoferrin
  accumulation in the cell exterior, correlating with decreased virulence. In the
  same context, excess Fe2+ led to the transcriptional downregulation of rfs, which
  correlated with lower virulence. Rhizoferrin chelates extracellular iron and transports
  it to the intracellular space; intracellular rhizoferrin could store iron and help
  avoid free iron toxicity. Meanwhile, decreased cAMP, low levels of glucose, presence
  of oxidative stressors, such as H2O2, or stimulation of the activity of Pde2 produced
  the contrary effect, inducing oxidative metabolism and increasing rhizoferrin production,
  which correlates with increased virulence of M. lusitanicus.
