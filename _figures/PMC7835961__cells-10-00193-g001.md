caption: 'Androgen-dependent signaling through the androgen receptor (AR). After its
  production in the testes ad the adrenal glands, testosterone (T) is converted by
  5α-reductase to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), its active metabolite. Generally, androgens
  bind to AR, dissociating chaperone proteins, including members of the heat shock
  protein family (HSP27 and HSP70). Upon homodimerization, ligand-bound AR dimers
  translocate to the nucleus where they bind to androgen response elements (ARE),
  acting as transcription factors to downstream targets. AR-directed drugs are illustrated
  at their points of pathway alteration: Abiraterone disrupts the androgen biosynthesis
  inhibiting the 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), an enzime expressed in testicular,
  prostate, and adrenal tissue; Flutamide, and Bicalutamide, reversibly, and Enzalutamide,
  Apalutamide, Darolutamide, irreversibly, prevent testosterone binding to the AR,
  incapacitating its translocation to the nucleus.'
