caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms related to increased glycolytic flux in
  chemoresistant leukemia cells. Intrinsically, chemoresistant leukemia cells overexpress
  cytoplasmic proteins, enzymes, RNA molecules, transcription factors, and receptors
  and present alterations in signaling pathways that favor an increase in glycolytic
  flow. Additionally, the direct or indirect interaction between chemoresistant leukemia
  cells and various cell populations of the tumor microenvironment, such as mesenchymal
  and endothelial cells, promotes glucose uptake achieved by tumor cells through the
  PI3K-mTORC pathway or the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. The release of exosomes containing
  VEGF-RVEFG can also increase glycolysis in endothelial cells. Taken together, all
  these factors may regulate resistance to drugs including TKIs, anthracyclines, Ara-C,
  and glucocorticoids. TKIs, Tyrosine kinase inhibitors; Ara-C, Cytarabine; HIF-1,
