caption: 'Hypothetical model for a regulatory TF’s cascade triggered by C protein
  and resulting in YdaT-dependent deficient lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and cell
  division. C protein (yellow hexagon) is accepted as a foreign TF, which affects
  a Rac locus TFs (red blocks): RacR, YdaS, YdaT. In turn, YdaT affects a genomic
  TF, an RcsA TF, which together with RcsB (green blocs) modulate exopolysaccharide
  biosynthesis. Thick lines indicate the experimentally verified pathway explained
  in this work, normal lines pathways known from the literature data and dashed lines
  pathways to be clarified in the future. Description explained in Discussion.'
