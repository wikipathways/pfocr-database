caption: Mechanism of XWL-1-48 inhibits growth of breast cancer cells. XWL-1-48, a
  novel orally topoisomeraseII inhibitor, exerts potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor
  activity against breast cancer. Treatment with XWL-1-48 significantly inhibited
  TopoII activity, triggered DNA damage response, activated ATM/p53/p21 pathways,
  arrested cell cycle at S phase, and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile,
  XWL-1-48 strongly blocked PI3K/Akt/Mdm2 pathway, prompted degradation of Mdm2, and
  suppressed breast cancer cell survival
