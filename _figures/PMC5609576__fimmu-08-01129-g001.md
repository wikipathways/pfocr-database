caption: 'Cross-talk between adipocytes, macrophages, and cancer cells modulating
  the tumor microenvironment. In the protumorigenic state, macrophages are attracted
  to the tumor site via chemokines, such as CCL-2, -4, and -5 produced by malignant
  cells, resident macrophages, and inflamed adipose tissue. Obese adipose tissue can
  favor tumor growth and development by producing anti- and proinflammatory mediators
  in a deregulated way. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, are secreted
  by adipose cells acting on the tumor modulating the Janus kinase/STAT pathway promoting
  cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-13,
  IL-10, and TGF-β are also produced by this tissue and maintain the tumor, regenerating
  tissues, and inhibiting the recruitment of immune anticancer cells. In addition,
  inflamed adipocytes produce leptin in large amounts, which act on epithelial cells
  leading to neovascularization, thus increasing tumor invasion. Degenerate adipose
  cells attract M1 macrophages that can form a crown-like structure around the inflamed
  adipose cell to eliminate them. This elimination can lead to FFA release that will
  nourish the tumor giving energetic support to the malignant cells. In addition,
  degenerate adipose cells release cfDNA that are recognized by macrophage TLR9 receptors,
  thus increasing the production of CCL2 in these cells, leading to increased recruitment
  of monocytes. Macrophages are attracted to the tumor microenvironment and polarized
  to the M2 alternative profile. Tumor cells produce IL-4, IL-10, and IL-6; adipose
  cells produce IL-13, IL-10, and TGF-β; and neutrophils IL-4 and TGF-β polarizing
  and maintaining the macrophages in the M2 configuration. More macrophages are attracted
  into the microenvironment via CCL2, and help to maintain the tumor by producing
  cytokines that act on tissue regeneration, such as TGF-β, IL-10, IL-4, and arginase-1,
  increasing the viability of the tumor cells, leading to invasion and metastasis.
  The M2 configuration regulates the recruitment of immune cells, inhibiting the recruitment
  of CD8+ T and NK cells via TGF-β in addition to maintaining Treg cells by IL-4 production
  along with production of IL-33 produced by adipocytes. Treg cells act by maintaining
  the M2 configuration producing IL-10 and TGF-β which also activated CD4+ T activation.
  CD4+ T cells assist in the inhibition of anticancer cells through IL-10 and TGF-β
  secretion inactivating NK cells and CD8+ T cells. Neutrophils are also found in
  the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells produce CXCL2 in large numbers, recruiting
  neutrophils that help maintain the M2 profile by producing IL-4 and TGF-β, which
  also help the growth of tumor cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils are responsible
  for increasing the mutagenic level of cells by the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), which cause damage to the DNA of cells, in addition to M2 macrophages,
  to produce VEGF, and increasing angiogenesis. Neutrophils in blood vessels may form
  structures such as NETs that help malignant cells stabilize in place and enter the
  metastatic phase. In the antitumorigenic state, normal adipose cells secrete leptin
  which, together with MHCII, have acted in the recruitment of CD8+ T cells. CD8+
  T secrete large amounts of IFN-γ polarizing macrophages into the proinflammatory
  M1 profile and inhibit Treg cells. M1-like cells act on the secretion of cytokines
  that have the function of making the surroundings more and more inflamed and destroy
  tumor cells, such as IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF-α, and recruit more macrophages to the
  site via CCL2. Tumor cells, when destroyed, release DAMPs, which recruiting more
  macrophages and neutrophils into the site, which aid in inflammation secreting nitric
  oxide (NO) and causing severe damage to cells. Abbreviations: IFN-γ, interferon
  γ; IL, interleukin; MHCII, class II major histocompatibility complex; TNF-α, tumor
