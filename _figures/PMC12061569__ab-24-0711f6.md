caption: LARS regulates casein biosynthesis pattern through LAT1 in dairy cow mammary
  epithelial cells. After entering cells, leucine can be sensed and bound by LARS.
  On the one hand, it can promote casein synthesis by binding leucine to tRNA. On
  the other hand, it promotes casein synthesis by activating mTOR signaling pathway,
  and further promotes LAT1 transfer to the cell membrane. LARS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase;
  LAT1, large neutral amino acid transporter
