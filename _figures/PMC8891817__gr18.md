caption: Proposed mechanisms indicate the effects of mulberrin on liver fibrosis.
  In brief, under fibrotic stimuli, TRIM31-mediated activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway
  was restrained, resulting in inflammatory response and oxidative stress in hepatocytes,
  which contributed to the HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis. Notably, mulberrin
  treatment could improve TRIM31/Nrf2 signaling to ameliorate hepatic inflammation
  and ROS production, consequently attenuating liver fibrosis.
