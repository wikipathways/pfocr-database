caption: 'NO–cGMP-PKG pathway in HFpEF development (created with BioRender.com on
  9 February 2022). NO, produced in endothelium by eNOS in normal conditions, protects
  fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes from harmful proliferation. BH4 (hydrobiopterin-4)
  is required for eNOS action. NO acts via stimulation of cardiac sGC receptors (leading
  to cGMP synthesis). cGMP regulates phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and cGMP-dependent
  protein kinases (PKG). NO inhibits TXNIP, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis,
  however ROS inhibit this action. Oxidative stress shifts sGC towards an oxidized
  heme-free form which is unresponsive to endogenous and exogenous NO. Titin hypophosphorylation
  leads to hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. Increased peroxynitrite concentrations,
  together with scarce NO availability, induce fibroblast proliferation. Due to uncoupled
  eNOS, superoxide production increases. In turn, low levels of NO react with superoxide
  to generate peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite: (1) oxidizes BH4 to BH2 (BH2 inhibits
  eNOS), and (2) oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fe3+ inhibits cGMP production from GTP). Therefore,
  cGMP cannot activate PKG to phosphorylate titin, whereas titin phosphate prevents
  cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. For this reason, eNOS inhibition results in both fibroblast
  and cardiomyocyte proliferation. Neprylisin catalyzes NPs degradation, and PDE9
  inhibits NPs. NPs acts through receptors in cardiomyocytes to modulate proliferation
  of cardiomyocytes. NO—nitric oxide, eNOS—endothelial nitric oxide synthase, BH4—dihydrobiopterin-4,
  NPs—natriuretic peptide, PKG—protein kinase G, a—activated, sGC—soluble guanylyl
  cyclase, pGC—particulate guanylyl cyclase, PDE-GMP—regulated phosphodiesterase,
  ROS—reactive oxygen species, titin-P—phosphorylated titin, GTP—guanosine triphosphate,
  TXNIP—thioredoxin-interacting protein.'
