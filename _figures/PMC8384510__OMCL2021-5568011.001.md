caption: Caffeine neuroprotective mechanisms. (1) Aβ theory contains two routes. Firstly,
  caffeine stimulates PKA activity that decreases the hyperactive form of c-Raf-1.
  This abnormal c-Raf-1 form supports AD progression by activating the NF-κB pathway
  and β-secretase expression. Secondly, caffeine lowers the GSK-3α dysregulation which
  increases PS1 mutation and γ-secretase expression. (2) Tau protein theory relates
  to the caffeine deactivating GSK-3β expression which can also be triggered by Aβ
  that expedites tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation inside
  neurons. (3) Oxidative stress theory shows that caffeine inhibits ROS formation
  which can be promoted by Aβ. ROS can impair the mitochondrial electron transport
  system, further triggering caspase and neuronal apoptosis. (4) ApoE4 theory shows
  that caffeine can decrease high plasma and astrocyte cholesterol levels induced
  by high ApoE4 levels and reduce BBB disruptions by hypercholesterolemia (1Adapted
