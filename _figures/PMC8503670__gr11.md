caption: Schematic overview of the RLR signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  in IBRS-2 and PK-15 cell lines.A, the signal transduction from TBK1 to IRF3 in the
  RLR signaling pathway in IBRS-2 cells is dysfunctional, whereas the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway is functioning properly during porcine picornavirus infection. The aberrant
  production of type I IFNs contributes to rapid replication of the virus. B, both
  the RLR signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway function properly in PK-15 cells
  during porcine picornavirus infection, which resulted in a slower replication of
  the virus compared with that in IBRS-2 cells. IBRS-2, Instituto Biologico-Rim Suino-2;
  IFN, interferon; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor 3; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; PK-15, porcine kidney-15 cells; RLR, RIG-I–like
  receptor; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1.
