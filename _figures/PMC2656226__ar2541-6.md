caption: Mitochondrial regulation of the apoptotic pathway is altered in disease and
  modulated by sirolimus treatment. Expression of mitochondrial and cytosolic components
  involved in apoptosis in nephritis compared with asymptomatic tissue. The thick
  grey oval represents the mitochondria. The horizontal double line represents the
  plasma membrane. Two genes (DDX20 and MLH1) known to be involved in apoptosis were
  not connected to the main pathway in IPA. Green colour indicates higher level of
  expression in disease and red colour indicates lower level of expression in disease.
  The names of the genes are in "nodes". The shape of the nodes is related to gene
  function/family membership. The lines between the nodes represent the connectivity
  between genes. Solid lines indicate direct protein-protein interactions. Dotted
  lines represent indirect interactions.
