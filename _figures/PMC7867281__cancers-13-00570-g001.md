caption: Schematic representation of principal functional interactions between lncRNA
  HOTAIR and different microRNAs. HOTAIR/miR-34a interaction promotes tumor cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion by induction of the transcription factor c- Myc, the cyclin-dependent
  kinases CDK4 and CDK6, and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and SIRT1 in breast, gastric,
  pancreatic, prostate, and colon cancers; HOTAIR/miR-217 interaction modulates cell
  proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  by downregulation of tumor suppressor genes DACH1 and GPC-5, and the activation
  of JAK3/STAT3 and HIF-1α/AXL signaling pathways in lung, gastric, and kidney cancers
  and in osteosarcoma; HOTAIR/miR-204 interaction induces cell migration and angiogenesis
  by the tyrosine kinase FAK signaling pathway in breast and renal cancers; HOTAIR/MiR326
  interaction promotes tumor cell growth, proliferation, migration, and chemoresistance
  by induction of the FGF1, MEK1/2, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in lung,
  colon, and glioma cancers; HOTAIR/Mir-141 interaction reduces tumor cell proliferation
  and invasion by decreasing the cell-cycle gene SKA2 and anti-apoptotic gene ABL2,
  and inducing the metastasis suppressor gene PCDH10 in renal cancer and glioma; HOTAIR/Mir139a
  interaction promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis,
  and drug resistance by induction of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and AKT signaling
  pathways in prostate cancer and myeloid leukemia; HOTAIR/Mir152 interaction induces
  tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by modulation of the human leukocyte
  antigen G (HLA-G) and metalloproteinases expression in prostate and gastric cancer;
  HOTAIR/Mir454-3p interaction modulates tumor cells growth and proliferation by induction
  of the STAT3/cyclin D1 signaling pathway in gastric cancer and chondrosarcoma; HOTAIR/Mir613
  promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by modulation of the cell surface
  receptor notch3 signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer and retinoblastoma; HOTAIR/Mir130a
  increases tumor invasion and metastasis by inducing EMT and upregulates the transcription
  factor ZEB1 and the chemokine ligand CCL18 in ESCC and gallbladder cancers; HOTAIR/Mir218
  promotes tumor cell growth, proliferation, and resistance to ionizing radiation
  by induction of cell cycle genes in breast and liver cancers; HOTAIR/Mir1 interaction
  induces cell survival, proliferation, and EMT by upregulation of the cancer metastasis
  gene YY1 in liver cancer and medulloblastoma; HOTAIR/Mir148a interaction increases
  cancer cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and EMT by inducing the Snail2 gene,
  Estradiol (E2)/G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), and HLG-A axes in breast,
  cervical, and ESCC cancers; HOTAIR/Mir206 interaction promotes tumor growth, migration,
  invasion, and EMT by induction of cyclin D genes, anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-w, and
  chemokine ligand CCL2 in breast, ovarian, and colon cancers and medulloblastoma.
