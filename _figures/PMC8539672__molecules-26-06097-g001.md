caption: Examples of possible metabotropic signaling pathways for nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors (nAChR). (A) The α7 nAChR have been shown to couple to Gαq proteins, which
  then activates phospholipase Cβ2 (PLC), resulting in an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3)-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The α3β4 nAChR in the
  airway epithelium have also been shown to act via a metabotropic IP3-dependent release
  of intracellular Ca2+ by a yet uninvestigated pathway, which might then lead to
  the activation of Ca2+-dependent soluble adenylyl cyclases (sAC), increasing intracellular
  cAMP. (B) The α7 nAChR may also be coupled to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and may activate
  the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which then either
  regulates gene expression itself or inhibits NFκB. Additionally, for α4β2 receptors,
  JAK2/STAT3-dependent signaling has been described but not fully elucidated.
