caption: Schematic diagram of some signaling pathways that could mediate long-term                         changes
  in cellular plasticity as a function of sexual experience. Our                         microarray
  analyses [] pointed to several nodes in these pathways that were                         altered
  by prior sexual experience. Neural signals affecting long-term                         plasticity
  could arise from the activation of dopamine D1 receptors,                         tyrosine
  kinase receptors (TrkR) or inositol triphosphate (IP3).                         (Potential
  signaling from ionotropic glutamate receptors is omitted here.)                         Activation
  of these receptors trips a cascade of signaling mechanisms that                         converge
  on gene transcription via CREB or MAP kinase mediated processes                             [].
  For                         example, G-protein coupled receptors, such as dopamine
  receptors, can                         phosphorylate CREB through cAMP formation
  and PKA activity                             [] or                         indirectly
  phosphorylate ERK through activation of the MAP kinase pathway                             [].                         Stimulation
  of Trk receptors, for example by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or BDNF                         (not
  shown), or IP3 activity will also stimulate MAP kinase                         pathways,
  though through PKC activation [,]. What are illustrated as individual pathways and                         have
  been isolated in cell systems, are actually highly integrated molecular                         pathways
  in intact neurons []. In turn, nuclear transcription factors are                         expressed
  (e.g., c-Fos and ΔFosB [,,]) that                         regulate molecular mediators
  of dendritic plasticity (e.g., cyclin-dependent                         kinase 5;
  Cdk5, or activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein; Arc)                             [,,,].
