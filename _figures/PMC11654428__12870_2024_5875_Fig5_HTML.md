caption: Metabolic pathway of action of oregano essential oil. The diagram shows the
  metabolic pathways that were affected by the oregano essential oil treatment. Metabolites
  are shown in boxes, red boxes represent putative metabolites that were accumulated
  in the metabolome, blue boxes represent putative metabolites were depleted in the
  metabolome. In deep red, purple and dark blue, the metabolic related transcripts
  appeared differentially expressed after oregano oil treatment. Gray boxes show the
  possible final responses activated by the described pathways
