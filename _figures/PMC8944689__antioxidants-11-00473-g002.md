caption: Glutaminolysis and glutamate accumulation contribute to pulmonary hypertension
  (PH). Glutaminolysis is a mitochondrial process responsible for obtaining cellular
  energy from the breakdown of glutamine. In this cellular pathway, glutamine is converted
  into glutamate, aspartate, CO2, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and citrate. Initially,
  glutamine enters the pulmonary vascular cells via a glutamine transporter and is
  deaminated to glutamate by glutaminase (GLS1). Subsequently, glutamate is converted
  to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by glutamate dehydrogenase. α kg enters the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, where it is decarboxylated by α kg dehydrogenase to succinyl-CoA
  and CO2, providing energy for proliferating cells. Accumulation of glutamate in
  pulmonary vascular cells promotes PH. In addition, stiffening of the extracellular
  matrix in remodeled pulmonary cells activates the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated
  protein 1 (YAP) and TAZ, leading to upregulation of GLS1 and enhanced glutaminolysis.
  Furthermore, in remodeled pulmonary arteries, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
  (NMDAR) is overexpressed and overactivated.
