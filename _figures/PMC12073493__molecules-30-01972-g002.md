caption: Multiple biological functions of ALA. ALA exerts antioxidant effects by scavenging
  reactive species, including •NO, •O2−, and •OH. It also inhibits inflammation by
  modulating the JNK/AP-1, NF-κB, and NRF2 pathways, which reduce the expression of
  inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and INF-γ. Additionally, ALA can
  regenerate other antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10.
  As a metal chelator, ALA binds to metal ions (Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and
  Cd2+)
