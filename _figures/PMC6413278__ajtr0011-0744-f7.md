caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanisms for the inhibitory effects
  of MS-275 on osteogenesis in VICs. MS-275 regulates RUNX2 expressions via canonical
  and non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in VICs. MS-275 works as a coordinated
  inhibitor of GSK-3β and β-catenin, which results in the down-regulation of RUNX2
  gene transcription and protein expression in OST medium-treated VICs. This effect
  may lead to osteogenesis inhibition in VICs.
