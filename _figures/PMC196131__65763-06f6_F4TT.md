caption: Role of FXR in the suppression of CYP7A1. Activation of FXR by  bile acids
  leads to induction of the FGF-19 gene. FGF-19 is secreted  fromthe hepatocyte and
  can signal to other hepatocytes through its  cell-surface receptor FGFR4. This results
  in suppression of CYP7A1  expression through a JNK-dependent signaling cascade.
  FXR can also activate  expression of the SHP gene, which can directly suppress the
  CYP7A1  gene through an interaction with LRH-1  (;  ). SHP itself  may be a component
  of the JNK-signaling pathway  ().
