caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms of glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its
  derivatives in improving insulin resistance in the liver and adipose tissue. GL
  and its derivatives act on the insulin receptor to regulate gluconeogenesis and
  enhance glycogen synthesis via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and increase glucose
  uptake via GLUT4, thus regulating glucose homeostasis. On the other hand, they increase
  lipolysis through PI3K/Akt/HSL pathway and reduce fatty acid synthesis through downregulating
  SREBP-1c/FAS/SCD1 pathway, thereby regulating lipid metabolism. Therefore, GL and
  its derivatives improve insulin resistance through improving glucose homeostasis
  and lipid metabolism. FAS: Fatty acid synthetase; G6Pase: Glucose-6-phosphatase;
