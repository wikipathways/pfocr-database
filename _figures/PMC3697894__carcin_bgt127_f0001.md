caption: Diagram of the Notch signaling pathway. A mammalian signaling cell expresses
  one of the five Notch ligands. Engagement of this ligand with one of the four Notch
  family receptors causes cleavage of the receptor at the S2 cleavage site by TACE.
  The remaining Notch receptor undergoes further cleavage at the S3 site by the gamma
  secretase complex, freeing the Notch ICD. The Notch ICD translocates to the nucleus
  where it binds to the RPB-Jκ protein complex and converts the complex from a repressor
  to an activator of Notch target gene transcription. Inset is a schematic of the
  Notch protein. The EGF repeats are responsible for engaging the ligand; LNR is a
  negative regulator of Notch protein activity; the RAM domain enhances interaction
  between Notch ICD and RPB-Jκ; Ankyrin repeats mediate interaction with the RPB-Jκ;
  PEST domain is rich in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine residues and is
  involved in degradation of the Notch ICD. DLL, delta-like ligand; PSENEN, Presenilin
  enhancer-2; APH-1, Anterior Pharynx-defective-1; DSL, Delta-Serrate-Lag2; NLS, nuclear
  localization signal; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; NEXT, Notch
  extracellular truncation; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; RPB-Jκ, recombination
  binding protein J-kappa; RAM, RAM23 domain; PEST, proline (P), glutamine (E), serine
  (S) and threonine (T)-rich domain.
