caption: Cellular insults activate the DDR, which consists of multiple signaling pathways
  that ultimately lead to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. Canonically,
  the understanding is that the presence of DSBs triggers the ATM/CHK2 pathway and
  SSBs initiate the ATR/CHK1 pathway, which relies on the binding of RPA to SSBs for
  the activation of Rad17 and promotion of the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto damaged
  DNA sites. The p38MAPK/MK2 signal transduction pathway is stimulated downstream
  of ATM and ATR following DNA damage. These signaling pathways modulate DNA repair
  through the up-regulation of DNA repair proteins associated with BER, NER, MMR,
  HR, and NHEJ. In order to provide sufficient time to repair the DNA, these checkpoint
  pathways mediate the arrest of the cell cycle at the G1, S, and G2/M phases. If
  the damage to DNA is irreparable, p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis is
  induced. It is important to note that the DDR is not simply linear, but more complex
  with significant crosstalk between these signaling pathways.
