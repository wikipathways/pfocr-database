caption: A model depicting the regulatory interactions between TbPTP1 and TbPIP39
  when exposed to the differentiation triggers citrate or cis-aconitate. The CCA signal
  is conveyed by PAD proteins expressed on the surface of stumpy forms. This inhibits
  the activation of TbPTP1 by TbPIP39, although TbPTP1 may also be inactivated indirectly.
  Upon the inactivation of TbPTP1, phosphorylated TbPIP39 predominates, this being
  generated by an unidentified protein kinase. TbPIP39, activated by phosphorylation,
  is directed toward the glycosomes by its C-terminal PTS1 signal, and therein promotes
  a differentiation response.
