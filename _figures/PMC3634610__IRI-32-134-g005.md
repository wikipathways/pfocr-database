caption: CTLRs within the Dectin-1 cluster that contain novel signaling motifs. Many
  components downstream of LOX-1s novel DDL motif have been determined, although exact
  mechanisms are not entirely identified. Interestingly, LOX-1 has the ability to
  up-regulate transcription of other receptors including itself; a mechanism that
  has been shown to aid in plaque formation during atherosclerosis. Downstream signaling
  of CLEC-1 is largely unknown; however, it does contain a tri-acidic motif that may
  have signaling potential due to similar signaling sequences in Dectin-1 and CLEC-2.
  Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined, and the grey
  arrow represents potential pathways based on other related receptor functions.
