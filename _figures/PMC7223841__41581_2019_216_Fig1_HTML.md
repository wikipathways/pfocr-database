caption: In highly metabolically active mammalian cells such as the renal tubular
  epithelium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) acts as a hub that coordinates
  various aspects of metabolism. Addition of a hydride ion (H-) (an electron pair)
  to NAD+ yields its reduced form, NADH. Reduction of NAD+ to NADH is required for
  glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as
  the citric acid cycle and Krebs cycle). Oxidation of NADH (donation of the electron
  pair) moves high-energy electrons from fuel substrates to Complex I of the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain (ETC). Sequential oxidation–reduction reactions in the
  ETC generate a proton motive force that is utilized by mitochondrial ATP synthase
  to generate ATP (not shown). Oxidation of NADH is also required to generate lactic
  acid from pyruvate and for the desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
  NAD+ can also be phosphorylated to form NADP+. Oxidation–reduction reactions involving
  NADP+ and its reduced form, NADPH, facilitate defence against oxidative stress by
  serving as a cofactor for thioredoxin-dependent reduction of disulfides and as a
  cofactor for glutathione reductase, which reduces the disulfide form of glutathione
  to its antioxidant sulfhydryl form. Reduction of NADP+ also occurs in the pentose
  phosphate pathway, which generates chemical building blocks for sugars and nucleic
  acids. NADPH serves as a substrate for NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOXs) that create
  second messengers of free radicals. NAD+ can also be cleaved by poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins and the cyclic ADP-ribose (ADPR) synthetases CD38
  and CD157 to generate nicotinamide (Nam) and ADPR.
