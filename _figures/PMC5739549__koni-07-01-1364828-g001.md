caption: 'Mechanisms leading to transitory or sustained PD-1 expression in activated
  and exhausted T cells. Left panel: Upon TCR-mediated stimulation, NFAT is dephosphorylated
  and translocated into the nucleus, where, upon association with AP-1 complex activated
  upon CD28 signaling, it drives effector gene and PD-1 expression. Right panel: In
  the context of chronic antigen stimulation, sustained TCR signaling leads to a continuous
  PD-1 expression. Upon PD-L1 ligation, induced by IFN-γ in the microenvironment,
  PD-1 pathway inhibits TCR and CD28 signaling, that decreases AP-1 activation. Once
  translocated into the nucleus, NFAT is mainly “partnerless” and drives exhaustion
  genes and a constant PD-1 expression, facilitated by a constitutively demethylated
  PDCD1 promoter.'
