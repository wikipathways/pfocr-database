caption: Figure 4. Rho signaling in neural crest migration. (A) Rho signaling in migratory
  Xenopus cephalic neural crest cells. RhoA/ROCK signaling predominates at the rear
  of the cells. Wnt/PCP effectors (Wnt11/Fz7/PTK7/Dsh) activate RhoA whereas Par3
  lowers Rac1 activity by inhibiting Trio. At the cell leading edge, Rac1 activity
  is triggered by Cadherin-11/Trio, RhoU via PAK1 and Sdf1/Cxcr4 via Ric-8A. The non-canonical
  Wnt pathway induces RhoU, which is required for cell adhesion, and Calponin-2, which
  antagonizes Rho-induced stress fibers. (B) In mouse enteric NC cells, integrin signaling
  activates Rho/ROCK pathways whereas GDNF and ET-3 activate Rac1/Cdc42 activities.
  Phactr4 controls lamellipodia formation at the leading edge cell through inhibition
  of integrin signaling toward RhoA/LIMK and cofilin dephosphorylation. Potential
  pathways are indicated by question marks.
