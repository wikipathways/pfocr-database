caption: 'Exosome and recipient cell communication. Schematic diagram summarizing
  exosome–cell interactions. Once secreted into the extracellular space, exosomes
  mediate cellular responses via distinct pathways. Exosomes are described as messengers
  carrying functional cargo that can alter the physiology of the targeted cell once
  internalized. However, exosome uptake and/or direct contact with the targeted cell
  to mediate cell–exosome communication are not always required. Indirect interaction
  between secreted vesicles and cells is possible through soluble ligand signalling.
  Exosomes carry transmembrane proteins on their surface, accessible for cleavage
  by proteases to produce soluble forms of proteins that interact with specific receptors
  on the plasma membrane of recipient cells. Upon reaching the intended recipient
  cell, exosomes can dock at the plasma membrane. Following the anchorage of the vesicles,
  the activation of multiple distinct intercellular signalling pathways might occur
  via ligand/receptor interaction, also known as juxtacrine signalling. Most studies,
  however, describe the internalization of exosomes by the recipient cells. Exosome
  uptake involves several mechanisms of endocytosis including: (1) clathrin-dependent
  mechanism, (2) caveolin-mediated endocytosis, (3) macropinocytosis, (4) phagocytosis,
  and (5) lipid-raft dependent endocytosis. To release their content into the cytoplasm,
  secreted exosomes can directly fuse with the plasma membrane. The vesicle–cell interaction
  generates distinct cellular responses. Communication mediated by ligand signalling,
  Juxtacrine signalling or direct fusion with the plasma membrane possibly results
  in intercellular signalling pathway activation. On the other hand, once endocytosed
  by the cells, exosomal contents are systematically released to the endocytic compartments
  and are more likely to undergo degradation via fusion of endosomes with lysosomes.
  Some vesicles, however, have been described to escape degradation by back fusion
  of the exosomes containing MVB with the PM or by transport of exosomes towards the
  Golgi apparatus. MVB: Multivesicular bodies.'
