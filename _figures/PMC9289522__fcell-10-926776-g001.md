caption: Distinct roles of MyD88 and NOX2 in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. (A)
  In microglia, (i) N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAr) promote a calcium inflow,
  which leads to the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via
  ERK-PLA2. The activation of metabotropic glutamatergic receptors from group II (mGluR3)
  and group III (mGluR4, 6, 7, 8) induces NOX2 activation throughout Gi/Go alpha subunit.
  (ii) NOX2 can be activated by receptors of damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) G-protein-dependent (GPCRs), i.e., N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) and
  P2Y receptors (P2YRs) via RAC, followed by phosphorylation of p47phox (p47) and
  migration to the membrane along with p67phox (p67) and p40phox (p40), resulting
  in ROS production. (iii) H2O2 produced from hydrogen and O2 can cross membranes
  to participate in biochemistry reactions. (iv) Stimulation by DAMPs or cytokines
  throughout Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), activates
  an intracellular signaling pathway involving the protein adaptor myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88). Specific consequences occur in microglia, such as NOX2
  activation via IRAK4-RAC pathways. (v) NF-κB/RAC transcription factors promote the
  expression of chemokines CXCL8, IL-6, TNFα, and Pro IL-1β. The latter is transformed
  into mature IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome dependent on calcium and ROS. The consequences
  are immune cell recruiting and microglia polarization. (B) Activation of NOX2 in
  neurons occurs (i) by NMDAr (containing subunit GluN2B) via PI3K-PKC and/or (ii)
  by DAMPs receptors (FPRs and P2YRs). (iii) H2O2 produced from hydrogen and O2 induces
  long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD.) in physiological situations.
  However, a high concentration of ROS, e.g., in status epilepticus (SE), results
  in neural DNA damage by oxidation of sulfhydryl compounds (–SH) and cell death due
  to influx of H2O2 to the nucleus. In astrocytes, (iv) MyD88 activation by TLR4 is
  followed by NF-κB/RAC transcription factors assembly, (v) promoting the expression
  of IL-6, TNFα, and Pro IL-1β. The latter is transformed into mature IL-1β by the
  NLRP3 inflammasome dependent on calcium and ROS. The consequences include ions and
  neurotransmitters unbalance, astrocytic hypertrophy, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)
  changes. The illustrations were obtained using BioRender software.
