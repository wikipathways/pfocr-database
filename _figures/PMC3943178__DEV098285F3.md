caption: Coordination of macrophage-mediated signaling and muscle regeneration. Expression
  of TNFα and IFNγ is elevated during the proliferative stage of myogenesis during
  muscle regeneration and can contribute to coordinating the inflammatory and myogenic
  processes by activating macrophages to the M1 phenotype while increasing satellite
  cell proliferation and inhibiting differentiation. TNFα activation of NFκB in M1
  macrophages can promote these effects by further activating TNFα and IFNγ expression
  in M1 macrophages. Additional positive feedback for M1 activation and satellite
  cell proliferation can occur through TNFα activation of activin A expression by
  muscle cells. Increased expression and release of activin A by muscle cells, which
  has an autocrine effect on muscle cells, inhibits differentiation and maintains
  muscle cells in the proliferative stage of myogenesis. The released activin A also
  promotes TNFα expression in macrophages through a SMAD2/3 signaling pathway, maintaining
  the M1 phenotype. Finally, hypoxia, which is secondary to vascular damage in the
  injured tissue, activates the expression of genes under the transcriptional control
  of HIF1α, which promotes the M1 phenotype in macrophages and drives the proliferation
  of satellite cells. However, TNFα signaling via p38 MAPK can promote the M2 macrophage
  phenotype, in contrast to the NFκB-mediated activation of the M1 phenotype. As the
  inflammatory response transitions to a milieu dominated by Th2 cytokines, IL-10
  further promotes the M2 phenotype and deactivates M1 macrophages. IL-10 can also
  act directly on muscle cells through mechanisms that may promote regeneration. IL-4,
  a Th2 cytokine that is expressed by eosinophils and muscle cells in regenerative
  muscle, further increases M2 activation through signaling that may be mediated by
  Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) or PPARγ signaling (; ; ; ). IL-4 can also drive muscle
  regeneration and growth by direct actions on muscle or by acting through FAPs.

  description: Coordination of macrophage-mediated signaling and muscle regeneration.
    Expression of TNFα and IFNγ is elevated during the proliferative stage of myogenesis
    during muscle regeneration and can contribute to coordinating the inflammatory
    and myogenic processes by activating macrophages to the M1 phenotype while increasing
    satellite cell proliferation and inhibiting differentiation. TNFα activation of
    NFκB in M1 macrophages can promote these effects by further activating TNFα and
    IFNγ expression in M1 macrophages. Additional positive feedback for M1 activation
    and satellite cell proliferation can occur through TNFα activation of activin
    A expression by muscle cells. Increased expression and release of activin A by
    muscle cells, which has an autocrine effect on muscle cells, inhibits differentiation
    and maintains muscle cells in the proliferative stage of myogenesis. The released
    activin A also promotes TNFα expression in macrophages through a SMAD2/3 signaling
    pathway, maintaining the M1 phenotype. Finally, hypoxia, which is secondary to
    vascular damage in the injured tissue, activates the expression of genes under
    the transcriptional control of HIF1α, which promotes the M1 phenotype in macrophages
    and drives the proliferation of satellite cells. However, TNFα signaling via p38
    MAPK can promote the M2 macrophage phenotype, in contrast to the NFκB-mediated
    activation of the M1 phenotype. As the inflammatory response transitions to a
