caption: 'Conceivable mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. There
  are several molecular mechanisms proposed to explain resistance to abiraterone and
  enzalutamide: increased intratumoral androgen biosynthesis as a result of upregulation
  of CYP17 enzymes or a gain‐of‐function mutation (N367T) in 3βHSD1; AR gain‐of‐function
  mutations that allow the AR to be activated by anti‐androgens; alternative steroid
  receptors, such as GR or PR activation, to bypass AR; reciprocal feedback regulation
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway; neuroendocrine transdifferentiation; and constitutively
  active AR‐Vs with truncated LBD. Some novel AR‐targeted agents that are in clinical
  development with potential to overcome resistance are shown.'
