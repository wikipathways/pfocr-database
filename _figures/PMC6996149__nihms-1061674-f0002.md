caption: 'Induction of the acidic pathway increases oxysterols which primarily activates
  LXR. It results in an increase in lipogenesis through inducing the expression of
  SREBP-1c, ChREBP, FAS, ACC-1, and SCD-1. Upon fed state, glucose enters hepatocyte
  through the glucose transporter GLUT2 and is catalyzed into Acetyl-CoA via glycolysis
  and citrate cycle. LPK, a key enzyme in glycolysis, is under the transcriptional
  control of ChREBP. Therefore, chronic LXR activation strongly contribute to steatosis
  development. Whereas, LXR also plays a beneficial role in the degradation and the
  excretion of cholesterol whose excess can cause liver inflammation. Activation of
  LXR can stimulate reverse cholesterol transport and reduce the body’s cholesterol
  overload by inducing CYP7A1 to facilitate cholesterol metabolism through classical
  pathway, as well as, by inducing cholesterol transporters, including ABCA1, ABCG5/8,
  and ApoE. However, as seen in NASH, chronic oxysterol excess may also increase the
  inflammation due to their lipotoxicity. Furthermore, oxysterols are able to bind
  to INSIG, thereby inducing a close interaction between INSIG and SCAP, thus preventing
  SREBP export to the Golgi and subsequent activation. This interaction is central
  in the control exerted by some oxysterols on cholesterol metabolism. Abbreviations:
  ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; ABCG5/8, ATP-binding cassette transporter
  G5/G8; ACC-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element (ChRE)-binding
  protein; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP7B1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase; FAS,
  fatty acid synthase; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; INSIG, insulin induced gene
  protein; LPK, liver pyruvate kinase; LXR, liver X receptor; SCAP, sterol regulatory
  element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein; SCD-1, stearoyl-CoA
  desaturase 1; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c.'
