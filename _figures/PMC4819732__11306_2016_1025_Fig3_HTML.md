  a Organization of the type I iterative PKS gene cluster (icm) in Streptomyces sp.
  MBT76 (Table S1). b Proposed biosynthetic route to highly methoxylated isocoumarins
  7–9. The modular non-reducing PKS gene icmM was iteratively used to assemble the
  basic backbone 6,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isocoumarin (1), which was further furnished
  into a range of methoxylated isocoumarins by the oxidoreductase icmF and the methyltransferase
  icmI in the post-PKS stage
