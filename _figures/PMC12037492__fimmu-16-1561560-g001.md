caption: Mechanisms via which TYMP promotes platelet activation and osteoclast differentiation.
  LYN and FYN bind to the cytoplasmic domain of one GPVI molecule, while the other
  GPVI molecule interacts with the FcRγ chain dimer, thereby initiating the GPVI signaling
  pathway. Activation of this pathway results in LYN and FYN stimulating the phosphorylation
  of ITAM and Syk, which in turn activates platelet activation. Concurrently, LYN
  inhibits collagen-induced platelet activation by promoting the phosphorylation of
  the immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain of platelet endothelial
  cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1). TYMP binds to the phosphate group of p-LYN, dephosphorylating
  it and causing the loss of its ability to mediate PECAM-1/ITIM phosphorylation.
  This action attenuates LYN’s inhibitory function on collagen-induced platelet activation,
  thereby indirectly promoting platelet activation and contributing to thrombosis.
  In OC precursor cells, RANKL binds to the RANK receptor on OC precursors, leading
  to the recruitment of TRAF6, which activates NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors,
  triggering downstream signaling pathways. This activation promotes the expression
  of c-Fos and NFATc1, key drivers of osteoclast differentiation. In TYMP-stimulated
  cells, the expression of FYN is significantly increased. TYMP activates FYN signaling,
  which subsequently promotes the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways,
  thereby facilitating osteoclast differentiation
