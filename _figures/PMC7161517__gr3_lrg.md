caption: 'The Renin-Angiotensin System Interaction With COVID-19Normally, angiotensin
  I (Ang I) is converted to Ang II via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which
  could be inhibited by ACE inhibitors. The pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II are
  mediated through AT1R in several ways: 1) in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal
  medulla, it stimulates aldosterone secretion and binding to mineralocorticoid receptors
  to promote water reabsorption and to increase salt retention; it is inhibited by
  mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs); 2) in the posterior pituitary, Ang
  II stimulates antidiuretic hormone secretion to promote water retention; and 3)
  in other tissues, it stimulates pathways responsible for hypertrophy, fibrosis,
  oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These effects are attenuated by angiotensin receptor
  blockers (ARBs), which block Ang II binding to AT1R. Ang II can also be converted
  to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) via ACE2, which stimulates the Mas receptor promoting
  anti-inflammatory benefits. The ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis acts as a counter regulatory
  pathway to the traditional renin-angiotensin system (RAS). AT1R and ACE2 are coupled.
  Ang II binding to AT1R allows dissociation of ACE2 and subsequent degradation. ARB
  prevents dissociation of ACE2 and renders it availability for unused Ang II conversion
  to Ang 1-7. ACE2 has been identified as the targeted receptor for both the severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 and SARS-CoV. ACE2 mediates
  S protein binding that stimulates viral entry into the host cytosol that results
  in infection and viral replication. Diversion of Ang II towards ACE2 could competitively
  inhibit viral binding and also counter regulate the adverse effects caused by AT1R
  and improve outcomes by Mas R−based favorable effects.'
