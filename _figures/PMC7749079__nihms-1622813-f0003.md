caption: Functions of Hippo pathway in embryogenesis and development. This diagram
  shows the YAP/TAZ subcellular distributions and their functions at different embryonic
  stages. In zygotes, YAP/TAZ is critical in preventing the premature expression of
  SOX2 and abnormal ICM differentiation. In morula and blastocyst, cells are specialized
  depending on Hippo pathway activity in response to their position and polarity.
  The exterior cells with high YAP/TAZ activity develop into trophoblasts while the
  inner cells with low YAP/TAZ activity develop into ICM. YAP/TAZ is required for
  organogenesis in all three germ layers. The color of cell outlines and text boxes
  represent certain germ layers (gray, blue, green, and red for trophectoderm, ectoderm,
  mesoderm, and endoderm, respectively). The text in colored background denotes phenotypes
  of altered Hippo signaling at each indicated embryonic “E” stage.
