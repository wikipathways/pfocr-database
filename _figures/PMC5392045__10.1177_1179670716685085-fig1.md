caption: Schematic of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–dependent innate
  immune response pathway. The infection of host cells by viruses and microbial pathogens
  results in the presence of nonself DNA or cyclic dinucleotides in the cytosol of
  the infected cells. The recognition of this DNA by the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS) induces it to produce the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP). Both
  cGAMP and other pathogen-derived cyclic dinucleotides bind STING, which alters the
  conformation of the protein and allows it to facilitate the phosphorylation of interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Interferon regulatory
  factor 3 phosphorylation induces protein dimerization and entry into the nucleus,
  where it acts as a transcription factor to drive interferon (IFN) expression. ER
  indicates endoplasmic reticulum.
