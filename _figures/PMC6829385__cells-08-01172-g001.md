caption: 'MAPK signaling pathway: ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38. Activation of ERK begins
  with the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, followed by activation of tyrosine and threonine
  residues. Activated RAF binds to and phosphorylates the kinases MEK1/2 as well as
  activated RAS. The RAS activation occurs at the plasma membrane and is mediated
  by son of sevenless (SOS), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Signals from
  cell surface receptors are passed through RAS-GTP to the RAF(A/B/C) and/or PI3K,
  the latter then activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. RAF also receives signals
  from the activated ligands’ G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Activated RAF is
  capable of phosphorylating MEK, and subsequently, the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.
  After activation of ERK, ERK1/2 moves to the cytoplasm and nucleus to phosphorylate
  other proteins. These proteins are responsible for cell regulation, growth, differentiation,
  and mitosis. JNK is activated in response to cytokines, growth factors, pathogens,
  stress, etc., and is associated with the transformation of oncogenes and growth
  factor pathways. Activation of JNK requires dual phosphorylation tyrosine and threonine,
  the MAP2Ks that catalyze this reaction are known as MKK4 (also known as SEK1) and
  MKK7. MKK4/7 are phosphorylated and activated by MAP3Ks, TAK1, and ASK1. Tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor signaling and ROS might be the major upstream mediators of
  JNK activation. Abnormal activation of the JNK signaling pathway is linked to the
  development of cancer, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.
  The activation of p38 is mediated by upstream kinases, MAP kinase 3 (MKK3), and
  MAP kinase 6 (MKK6). MKK3/6 are activated by MAP3Ks such as ASK1 and TAK1, which
  respond to various extracellular stimuli including osmotic shock, inflammatory cytokines,
  lipopolysaccharides (LPS), UV light, and growth factors.'
