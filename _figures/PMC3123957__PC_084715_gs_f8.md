caption: Model Explaining the Interaction between FIT and EIN3/EIL1.FIT is produced
  in root cells upon –Fe in wild-type plants or, alternatively, independently of Fe
  supply in transgenic FIT Ox plants (FIT gene, FIT Ox construct, and FIT protein
  are represented as light-gray ellipses). The activity of FIT is regulated. Upon
  –Fe, FIT is activated and induces downstream Fe deficiency responses, like IRT1
  and FRO2 expression. It has been shown that FIT protein can dimerize with bHLH038
  and bHLH039 (; not depicted in the model). From the relative IRT1 and FRO2 expression
  levels and the levels of FIT protein, we propose that only a small pool of FIT protein
  is active, while a large pool remains inactive (represented by the thickness of
  arrows and ellipses). We propose from our results that inactive and active FIT proteins
  are not stable inside cells and can be degraded, indicated by arrows pointing to
  ellipses with light gray–white shading. Fe deficiency leads to ethylene production
  (; ; ). EIN3/EIL1 activated in the ethylene signaling pathway physically interact
  with FIT, which inhibits proteasomal degradation of FIT (EIN3/EIL1 are represented
  as dark-gray ellipses; FIT binding to EIN3/EIL1 does not involve the bHLH domain
  of FIT). According to our model, EIN3/EIL1 do not primarily participate in conjunction
  with FIT to induce IRT1 and FRO2. We favor the hypothesis that EIN3/EIL1 function
  to amplify Fe acquisition through stabilization of FIT.
