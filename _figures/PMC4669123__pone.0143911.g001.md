caption: Adipogenesis is characterized by the expression of PPARγ, C/EBP-family members
  and SREBP. Insulin, glucocorticoids or IGF stimulate the expression of C/EBPβ, which
  in turn stimulates the expression of EBPα and PPARγ. Upon stimulation, PPARγ forms
  a heterodimer with RXR and together with EBPα regulate the expression of genes involved
  in adipogenesis and lipogenesis []. C/EBPα and C/EBPβ also regulate the expression
  of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 (which catalyse the activation and deactivation, respectively,
  of cortisol and regulate glucocorticoid metabolism) [] and of IGF-I and IGF-II (which
  regulate growth, cell proliferation and development) [, ]. SREBP1 and ChREBP, are
  stimulated upon insulin and glucose secretion, respectively, and regulate synergistically
  the expression of the de novo lipogenesis enzymes FASn and ACCα [] that catalyse
  fatty acid synthesis. SREBP1 also regulates the expression of PPARγ []. Fatty acid
  catabolism through β-oxidation in peroxisomes is catalysed by ACOX1 []. Excess fatty
  acids derived from food, break-down from stored fat or synthesized through de novo
  lipogenesis are converted to triglycerides through a pathway the last step of which
  is catalysed by the DGAT2 enzyme. The transcriptional regulation of DGAT2 is also
  regulated by EBPβ and to a lesser extent by EBPα [].
