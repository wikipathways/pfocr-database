caption: The citric acid cycle (TCA cycle or Krebs cycle) represented as the canonical
  version (panel A, wikipathways:WP78) [] and as part of processes involved in metabolic
  reprogramming in colon cancer (panel B, wikipathways:WP4290) []. In the canonical
  model, each enzymatic step in the cycle is represented in detail, whereas when the
  same process is represented in the context of colon cancer, specific steps in the
  cycle are summarized and abstracted at a higher level. Pathway nodes are depicted
  in green, metabolites in blue, and genes and proteins in black. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
