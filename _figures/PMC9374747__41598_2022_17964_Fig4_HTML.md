caption: Identification of glucose-responsive phosphorylation of insulin signaling
  molecules. Time courses of the amount and phosphorylation of the indicated insulin
  signaling molecules in the skeletal muscle of WT mice (blue lines) and ob/ob mice
  (red lines) following oral glucose administration. Phosphorylated proteins are indicated
  by the prefix “p.” The time course graphs are presented in the context of the insulin
  signaling pathway from the KEGG database,. Edges reflect direct or indirect regulatory
  events. Not all molecules in this pathway are shown. The nodes without time course
  graph (insulin receptor [IR], insulin receptor substrate 1/2 [IRS1/2], phosphatidyl-inositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate [PIP3], and mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]) were not quantified
  here. The colors of the boxes around each graph indicate the change in amount or
  phosphorylation specific to WT (blue), specific to ob/ob (red), common to both (green),
  opposite between WT and ob/ob mice (pink). Proteins that did not exhibit a change
  in phosphorylation are outlined in gray. Proteins that showed an absolute log2 fold
  change ≥ 0.585 (20.585 = 1.5) and a q value ≤ 0.1 at any time point (20, 60, 120,
  240 min) were defined as glucose-responsive. Glucose-responsive molecules in the
  TF and Enzyme layers are enclosed in dashed boxes. See Data File  for the unabbreviated
  names of the insulin signaling molecules. Data are shown as the mean and SEM of
  five mice per genotype (see Fig.  for Western blot). *q value < 0.1 and absolute
  log2 fold change > 0.585.
