caption: 'Four p38 subfamilies have been identified: p38-α, -β, -γ, and -δ []. MAPK
  cascade is the main mechanism by which the four p38 isoforms are activated in human
  cells []. Protein kinase activity of p38 is stimulated by oncogenic TAK1 or ASK1
  through its downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, MKK3 and MKK6,
  under conditions of severe stress and inflammation (under mild stress, the ERK/MAPK
  pathway is activated) []. Activated p38 also interacts with AKT and NF-κB, triggering
  downstream mTORC1 via the degradation of DEPTOR, or by suppressing the activation
  of PPARα []. These changes promote cell proliferation, inflammation, protein synthesis,
  and decrease apoptosis, ultimately leading to a hypoxic, acidic, and inflammatory
  TME.'
