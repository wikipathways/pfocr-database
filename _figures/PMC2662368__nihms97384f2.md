caption: T cell differentiation proceeds along distinct pathways following antigen
  presentation by DCs. Depending on the cytokines that are produced by the DC during
  naïve T cell activation, expression of specific transcription factors are upregulated
  that control T cell differentiation. Other pathways of T cell differentiation are
  counter-regulated by the presence of cytokines that drive a specific pathway. This
  assures the development of immune responses that are optimized for clearing the
  infectious agent that initiated the response. Inducible regulatory T cells (iTreg)
  develop under conditions where the cytokines that drive other pathways are not produced
  or co-stimulation by DCs is deficient. The iTreg pathway is enhanced by exposure
  of CD4+ T cells to TCDD (,)
