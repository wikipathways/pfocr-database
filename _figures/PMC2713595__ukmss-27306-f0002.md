caption: There is evidence that the pathways leading to expression of NKG2D ligands
  in “stressed cells” could be closely related to those involved in NKG2D ligand expression
  on healthy cells. A role for ATM/ATR mediated phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase-1(chk1)
  in NKG2D ligand induction was first reported to occur in response to DNA damage
  []. Subsequently it has been shown that RAE-1 expression in class switching B cells,
  and on infection with a transforming retrovirus (Abelson murine leukaemia virus),
  is dependant on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediated chk1 phosphorylation;
  a pathway that implies a role for ATM []. ATM/ATR and chk1 have also been implicated
  in the expression of NKG2D ligands on activated T cells []. The precise mechanism
  by which chk1 induces NKG2D ligand gene expression is unknown. ATM/ATR and chk1
  are known to be regulators of cell division. Therefore increased cellular proliferation
  could be the crucial commonality between these four scenarios that result in NKG2D
  ligand expression.
