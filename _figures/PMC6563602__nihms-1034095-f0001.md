caption: Various complement components have the potential of being biomarkers either
  of disease activity or of an MS phenotype. The most important complement components
  are marked with (*) when they are possible biomarkers in plasma and with (**) when
  they represent biomarkers in CSF. Complement system activation and the C5b-9 terminal
  complex, when present at lytic doses, lead to demyelination. In contrast, sublytic
  C5b-9 can protect OLG from apoptotic cell death, indicating a dual role for complement
  in demyelination. Human myelin and OLG are vulnerable to complement attack because
  they lack some of complement surface inhibitors. Classical pathway is usually activated
  when the C1 complex binds myelin-specific autoantibodies through its C1q component.
  The C1s-induced cleavage of C2 and C4 results in the generation of the classical
  pathway C3 convertase C4b2a. Lectin pathway is activated when MBL binds to mannose
  residues on the surface of a pathogen and activate MASP-2 which leads to the formation
  of C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves the C3 component and the resulting C3b participates
  in the formation of the C5 convertase, C4b2a3b. In the alternative pathway, factor
  B bound to the C3b generated through spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 (C3(H2O)) is cleaved
  by factor D and the resulting Bb fragment forms with C3b the alternative pathway
  C3 convertase, C3bBb, which amplifies the cleavage of C3. C5 convertase acts on
  C5 which is cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5b initiates the terminal pathway which leads
  to the formation of C5b-9 terminal complex
