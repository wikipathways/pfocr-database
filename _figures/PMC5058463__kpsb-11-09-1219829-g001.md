caption: Models showing chemical signals involved in systemic signaling and their
  transport routes. (A) Inoculation of avirulent pathogen triggers accumulation of
  SA and the free radicals NO and ROS. The galactolipid DGDG functions together with
  an unknown signal (indicated by X) upstream of the SA and NO branch point and induces
  biosynthesis of SA and NO. The ROS species catalyze oxidative cleavage at carbon
  9 of C18 Δ9 unsaturated fatty acids present on galactolipids MGDG and DGDG to form
  AzA. AzA induces biosynthesis of G3P by upregulating transcription of genes encoding
  G3P dehydrogenase and glycerol kinase. The NO-ROS-AzA-G3P pathway operates in parallel
  to the SA pathway. (B) A small percentage of SA, AzA and G3P are transported from
  the inoculated to the distal leaves. SA is transported to the distal leaves via
  the apoplast, defined as the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm. AzA and
  G3P are transported to the distal leaves via plasmodesmata (PD), which are cytoplasmic
  connections between adjacent cells. The induced levels of cytosolic SA inhibits
  PD permeability, and this in turn correlates with pathogen induced reduction in
  PD permeability. The levels of PD localizing protein 5 regulates PD permeability
  and thereby transport of AzA and G3P via PD but has no affect on the transport of
  SA. Both PDLP1 and PDLP5 proteins are required for SAR and contribute to the partitioning
  of the lipid transfer protein AZI1 between the plastids (chl) and cytoplasm.
