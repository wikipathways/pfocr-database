caption: 'Mutant RAS deregulates key metabolic processes, including glutaminolysis,
  glycolysis, autophagy, and macropinocytosis. Oncogenic KRAS directs glucose metabolism
  into hexosamine biosynthetic pathways by upregulating several key glycolytic enzymes,
  and induces the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway to support increased nucleic
  acid biosynthesis. RAS-driven cancer cells alter glutaminolysis to support rewired
  metabolism. Altered glutaminolysis is a key feature of KRAS-dependent cancer cells.
  KRAS regulated glutamine metabolic rewiring influenced the TCA cycle, which is critical
  for nucleotide biosynthesis to support cell growth and survival. KRAS-driven tumors
  require glutaminolysis for redox balance. KRAS-mediated activated NRF2 is depicted
  as a key transcription factor that modulates redox homeostasis for the survival
  of cells under oxidative stress. Cells harboring mutant RAS are characterized by
  increased macropinocytosis, autophagy, and mitophagy, processes which help generate
  the energy and macromolecules needed for accelerated tumor proliferation. Mutant
  RAS also regulates stress granule formation, which helps mediate chemoresistance.
