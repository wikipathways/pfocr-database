caption: 'Hypothetical mechanism of the interaction between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and
  bone remodeling. (A) Obesity: increases in circulating and hypothalamic NPY levels
  may promote sympathetic overactivity to bone tissue through activation of hypothalamic
  Y2 receptor. NPY acts on Y1 receptor expressed in osteoblasts inhibiting the cAMP
  signaling pathway, followed by phosphorylation of ERK, which leads to reduced osteoblast
  differentiation and bone formation. (B) Retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rWAT)
  denervation (Dnx): the interruption of the communication between rWAT and hypothalamus
  by Dnx might have restored central NPY levels resulting in normalization of sympathetic
  activation to rWAT and possibly to bone tissue as well, rescuing bone formation.
  Decreased peripheral levels of NPY induced by Dnx might have also contributed to
  restore bone formation. SNS—sympathetic nervous system'
