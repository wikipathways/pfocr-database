caption: Schematic diagram of effectors that break physical barriers to infestation
  and regulate the infestation environment. Effectors promote infestation by regulating
  stomata, degrading cell walls, regulating intercellular filament function, disrupting
  the cytoskeleton, and creating conditions conducive to infestation. P. syringae
  AvrB interacts with RIN4 protein to promote COI1 and JAZ protein binding and enhance
  plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA1 activity. HopX1 inhibits stomatal immunity by degrading
  multiple JAZ transcriptional repressors leading to JA activation. xopS stabilizes
  WRKY40 and decreases JAZ expression. HopM1 and AvrE1 target the ABA signaling pathway,
  increase ABA accumulation, and induce stomatal closure. Fusarium oxysporum Avr2
  and Six5 interact with intercellular filaments to enlarge the pore size. The oomycete
  pathogen Phytophthora brassicae RxLR3 effector physically interacts with callus
  synthases CalS1, CalS2 and CalS3 to impede callus accumulation in intercellular
  hyphae. P. syringae HopO1-1 interacts with and destabilizes the PD proteins PDLP7
  and PDLP5. HopW1 disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by forming complexes with actin.
  Bradyrhizobium graminearum ROPIP targets the barley ROP GTPase HvRACB and manipulates
  host cell microtubule organization to facilitate its own cell entry. Xanthomonas
  oleifera T3E XopR binds to actin in the cell cortex to manipulate actin assembly
  and disrupt the host actin cytoskeleton. The hydrophobic protein MPG1 in Fusarium
  inermis, FgHyd1~FgHyd4 in F. graminearum, and the extracellular matrix protein EMP1
  in F. graminearum can create hydrophobic spaces and participate in appressorium
  development. Ralf-like effectors can cause an increase in extracellular pH to promote
  the invasive growth of the fungus. Overall, effectors favor their own infestation
  by modifying the structural properties of plant cells and environmental conditions.
