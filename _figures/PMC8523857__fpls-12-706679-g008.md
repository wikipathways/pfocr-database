caption: The exogenous application of miPEP164c increases anthocyanin synthesis and
  accumulation while decreasing PA synthesis by enhancing miR164c-mediated downregulation
  of PA-synthetic pathway in Gamay grape berry cell suspensions. Addition of miPEP164c
  provoked an increase in the transcription of pre-miR164c and consequently of its
  mature form, miR164c, which putatively led to a decrease in the translation of transcription
  factor MYBPA1. This inhibition in MYBPA1 translation resulted in a downregulation
  of VvLAR1 expression and LAR total biochemical activity, as well as ANR total biochemical
  activity, decreasing the intracellular concentration of PAs. This downregulation
  of the PA pathway indirectly led to the stimulation of the anthocyanin synthesis
  by increasing VvUFGT1 expression and UFGT total biochemical activity, as well as
  vacuolar accumulation, as shown by VvGST4 and VvMATE1 overexpression.
