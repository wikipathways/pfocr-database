caption: Major pathways of RSBDP treating UC. In a PDK1-dependent way, activated PI3K
  stimulates Akt activation. IKK is a downstream signal transduction pathway that
  can be regulated by activated Akt. The IKK complex is composed of the two catalytic
  subunits IKK-α and IKK-β and the regulatory subunit IKK-γ. The activated IKK phosphorylated
  its substrate IκB so that the NF-κB subunit p65 and p50 were transferred from cytoplasm
  to nucleus to activate NF-κB. The activated NF-κB can promote pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and increase the levels of cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. In this research,
  RSBDP can inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and NF-κB while upregulating
  the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκB and downregulating the activator protein IKK, thus
  blocking the activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway and treating UC.
