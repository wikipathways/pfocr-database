caption: The Pn.p Cell model. The net-token for Pn.p cells models intracellular signaling
  cascades integrating inductive and lateral signals within each VPC. The AC communicates
  with Pn.p cells with either juxtacrine or paracrine inductive signaling that activates,
  with different intensities, the Vul genes signaling pathway. This pathway activates
  the  fate marker (i.e., active MPK-1) and the DSL output signal while inhibiting
  the  fate marker (i.e., active LIN-12) via DPY-23 and LST-mediated transcriptional
  inhibition. In addition, DSL-mediated lateral signaling activates the  fate marker
  (i.e., active LIN-12) in neighboring VPCs. LIN-12 is a Notch-like receptor for the
  Delta-like signal DSL. DSL-LIN-12 lateral signaling between neighbor Pn.p cells
  and AC juxtacrine signaling to P6.p cell are modeled with a neighbor communication
  module (see , ). AC paracrine signaling is modeled combining a signal sending and
  a signal sensing module (,  and ).

    VPCs. LIN-12 is a Notch-like receptor for the Delta-like signal DSL. DSL-LIN-12
    lateral signaling between neighbor Pn.p cells and AC juxtacrine signaling to P6.p
    cell are modeled with a neighbor communication module (see , ). AC paracrine signaling
