caption: Terpenoid metabolic network in tomato fruits and position of engineered enzymes.
  Cytosolic and plastidic (highlighted in purple) terpenoid metabolic pathways involved
  in the biosynthesis of sterols and lycopene in tomato fruits with individual enzymes
  depicted as boxes. The cytosolic MVA pathway enzymes, prenyl transferase, and Nudix
  hydrolase are highlighted in blue, peroxisomal MVA pathway enzymes are highlighted
  in orange, the plastidic MEP pathway enzymes and prenyl transferases are highlighted
  in white. The unknown transporter(s) involved in IPP exchange across the plastid
  envelope membranes are shown in gray. The enzymes that have been overexpressed in
  tomato fruits for metabolic engineering are highlighted in black, including the
  Antirrhinum majus terpene synthases AmNES/LIS-1 (N/L-1) and AmNES/LIS-2 (N/L-2)
  catalyzing the formation of nerolidol and linalool, respectively. Dashed lines indicate
  multiple enzymatic steps. AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; CMK, 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  kinase; DMAP, dimethylallyl phosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; FPP,
