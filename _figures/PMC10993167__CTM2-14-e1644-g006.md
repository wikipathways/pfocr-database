caption: Molecular mechanism of action of the FTO inhibitor 18097. As a potent inhibitor
  of FTO, 18097 was able to increase the N6‐methyladenosine (m6A)‐modified abundance
  of cytokine signalling pathway suppressor 1 (SOCS1), and furthermore to increase
  the stability of SOCS1 by recruiting IGF2BP1 and subsequently activating the P53
  pathway. In addition, 18097 inhibited cellular adipogenesis by downregulating peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer‐binding protein α (C/EBPα)
  and C/EBPβ
