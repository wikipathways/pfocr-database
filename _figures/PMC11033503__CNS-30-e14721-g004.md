caption: C/EBPβ mediates the expression of APOE4, leading to the accumulation of lipid
  droplets and Aβ. The transcription factor C/EBPβ binds and interacts with the C/EBP‐binding
  motifs within the APOE promoter −305 to +93 fragment, acting as a specific transcription
  factor for APOE and promoting its gene transcription. ApoE4 can influence lipid
  transport through an Aβ‐independent pathway, leading to mitochondrial damage and
  increased reactive oxygen species. Additionally, it can enhance Aβ production through
  an Aβ‐dependent pathway, concurrently amplifying neuroinflammatory responses. Conversely,
  ApoE4 strongly activates C/EBPβ, subsequently enhancing δ‐secretase cleavage of
  the increased APP.
