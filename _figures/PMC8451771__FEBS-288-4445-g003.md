caption: Apoptosis‐related oncogenic roles of mitochondria. Minority MOMP can release
  several pro‐apoptotic molecules such as SMAC, EndoG and mtDNA. Specifically, SMAC
  promotes growth and metastasis in surviving tumor cells by increasing lipid synthesis
  and lifting IAP‐mediated inhibition on the Rho GTPases Rac1 or Cdc42. EndoG promotes
  survival and proliferation through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  MtDNA released from permeabilized mitochondria is sensed by the cGAS‐STING pathway
  and stimulates inflammation and metastasis. Mitochondrial dynamics (fission and
  fusion) can also sustain cancer cell migration, tumor growth and oncogenic transformation.
  Mitochondrial transfer via TNTs from neighboring healthy cells promotes tumor cell
  survival by enhancing the metabolic fitness of damaged cancer cells.
