caption: Role of mTOR signalling pathway during protein translation. Translation initiation
  at the brain is regulated by various translation initiation factors including eIF3,
  eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4G, and cap binding protein eIF4E. Mechanism of mTOR is regulated
  by either 4E-BP or P70S6K. 4E-BP binds to eIF4E and inhibits the initiation of translation
  while S6 kinase from P70S6K binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and leads to truncated
  protein synthesis in affected regions. Altered translation leads to development
  of adverse characteristics in the neuronal phenotype of idiopathic autism individuals.
