caption: Plant (monocot) starch synthesis. Diagram of the reactions involved in starch
  synthesis. Arrows represent single or groups of enzymes that convert one metabolite
  to another. The primary starch synthesis pathway from sucrose to starch is represented
  by bold arrows (SSP‐1). Other pathways examined in this study from fructose to starch
  (SSP‐2) and glucose to starch (SSP‐3) in sink tissues are represented by  and ,
  respectively. Expressed genes for the primary pathway have been sorted according
  to the Pathway Pleiotropy Index (PPI; Ramsay et al., ), with CDS values calculated
  across all lines for π, Tajima's D and F ST (Landraces vs wild and weedy). Genes
  under purifying selection are represented with a (■) and under balancing selection
  with a (★).
