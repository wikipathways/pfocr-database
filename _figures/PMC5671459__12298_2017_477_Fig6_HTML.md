caption: Schematic presentation elucidating the ROS signaling mechanism during plant
  response to different osmotic stresses (drought and salt). Osmotic stress in plants
  leads to the accumulation of ROS triggering severe oxidative damage. Excessive ROS
  generation causes disintegration of plasma membrane and different cell organelles
  involved in vital metabolic processes of cell. ROS-mediated signaling pathway stimulates
  gene expression for antioxidant enzymes within the cell that provides osmotic stress
  tolerance in plants through detoxification of ROS
