caption: Nanomaterials for driving neutrophil repolarization toward the N1 phenotype,
  degrading ENTs and modulating neutrophil infiltration. A NETs degradation inhibits
  tumor metastasis. mP-DNase/PTX releases DNase I in the tumor microenvironment to
  degrade NETs, inhibiting hepatic and pulmonary metastases. AuPB@mPDA-DNase I (AMD)
  uses NIR-II laser irradiation to control DNase I release, suppressing colorectal
  cancer liver metastasis through photothermal therapy and NETs degradation. B Salmonella
  establishes intratumoral colonization and promotes neutrophil infiltration into
  the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, manganese oxide nanoparticles release
  Mn2⁺ ions, activating the STING pathway to induce type I interferon expression (e.g.,
  IFN-β). This signaling cascade reprograms TANs from protumorigenic N2 phenotypes
  to antitumor N1 phenotypes. C, D Nanotherapeutics influence neutrophils recruitment
  into the tumor microenvironment. C Neutrosomes (L) adsorbs tumor-secreted cytokines,
  reducing neutrophil migration to tumor sites. D BC nanotherapeutics bind to L-selectin
  on neutrophils, inhibiting LTB4 release and neutrophil functions and decreasing
  neutrophil recruitment to tumors. Created in BioRender. Su, Y. (2025). https://BioRender.com/h54e244
