caption: 'Plasmid integration sites give mechanistic insights. (A) Map of plasmid
  retrotransposition sites. Genes on the plasmid, ltrB, kanR interrupted by gpI (td
  intron), repD, repE, camR(+), and camR(–) (for Gram-negative camR), and truncated
  tnpA, are indicated as large arrows. The coordinates of the truncated ltrB gene
  are 1625–5894, group II intron 1803–5818, ltrA 2376–4185, kanR 4236–5550, group
  I intron 4559–4951. The small arrows outside the plasmid indicate positions and
  orientations of retrotransposition events identified in this study (). Unidirectional
  plasmid replication begins at pAMβ ori and proceeds in the same direction as repE
  (inner circle). The recA status of the host and endonuclease (Endo) status of the
  plasmid for specific events are indicated by arrows as described in the rectangular
  box. (B) Pathways for retromobility. Retrohoming into dsDNA () (a) is contrasted
  with the ssDNA-targeted retrotransposition pathway at the replication fork as described
  in this and previous work () (b). Reaction steps are as follows: 1, reverse splicing
  into DNA target; 2, bottom-strand cleavage by LtrA endonuclease; 3, cDNA synthesis
  by LtrA reverse transcriptase; 4, removal of intron RNA and second-strand cDNA synthesis;
  5, repair synthesis.'
