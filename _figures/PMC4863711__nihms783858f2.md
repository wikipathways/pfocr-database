caption: 'An overview of different signaling pathways activated by high glucose ambience,
  which leads to an altered expression of various ECM glycoproteins, and of genes
  relevant to EMT and apoptosis processes. WNT/β-CATENIN signaling: Under high-glucose
  ambience, Wnt proteins are secreted into the extracellular space and bind with LRP.
  These interactions send a signal to the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dsh) in the
  cytoplasm, while simultaneously inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK-3β) followed by its falling off from the Axin complex. Increased cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus, and it serves as a transcriptional co-activator
  of various transcription factors which stimulate the expression of the target EMT
  genes. TLRs signaling: It can be activated by the ligand TLR2, and subsequents events
  are channeled via MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Whereas, TLR4 activation leads
  to channeling of events via MyD88-dependent as well as MyD88-independent pathways.
  Both pathways lead to the activation of nuclear factor Kappa-B (NF-κB), which in
  turn increases the expression and secretion of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines with over-expression of ECM proteins like fibronectin. PI3-K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling: High glucose activates PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling with increase of phospho-p70S6
  and phospho-eEF2 kinase activities while reducing phospho-eEF2 (factor) expression.
  In addition, mTOR pathway activation causes over-activation of PP2Ac. In all these
  three pathways there is an increased expression of ECM glycoproteins and initiation
  of events related to the process of EMT with consequential apparent thickening of
  GBMs and expansion of glomerular mesangium.'
