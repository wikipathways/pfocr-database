caption: (A) Homoharringtonine (HHT) directly binds the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB)
  repression factor (NKRF) through the second double-strand RNA-binding motif (DSRM2),
  a nuclear localization signal for NKRF. This attenuates the transactivation activity
  of p65 on the MYC gene by strengthening the p65–NKRF connection and interfering
  with the development of the p65–p50 complex. (B) Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) is mainly mediated through the JNK-JUN and DNA damage/repair
  pathways, which regulate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell cycle progression through
  P21/P27 proteins and ultimately affect AML progression and HHT resistance. (C) MIR17HG
  mRNA expression level was decreased in AML and could regulate the miR-21/PTEN axis
  to promote HHT-induced apoptosis of AML cells and increase drug susceptibility of
  HHT. (D) HHT can affect AML cell proliferation (MYC and targets) and differentiation
  (HOXA9 and MEIS1) via binding to the transcription factor specificity protein 1
  (SP1). The dioxygenase ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) and the receptor tyrosine
  kinase FLT3 are the main participants in this pathway
