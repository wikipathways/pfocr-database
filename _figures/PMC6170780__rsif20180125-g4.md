caption: 'Prediction of antiviral targets [reactions] from single-reaction perturbations
  in a virus-optimized system for CHIKV, DENV and ZIKV. (a) Simplified schematic for
  single-reaction knockouts, where flux ranges for a desired reaction flux v are shown
  for both host- and virus-optimized systems. Square brackets, associated with specific
  flux vector indices 1–7, denote the lower (lb) and upper (up) flux bounds ([lb,ub]).
  Under knockout conditions both lb and ub are set to zero. (b) Simplified schematic
  for single-reaction enforcements, where flux ranges for a desired reaction flux
  v are shown for both host- and virus-optimized systems. Square brackets, associated
  with specific flux vector indices 1–7, denote the lower (lb) and upper (up) flux
  bounds ([lb,ub]). Under host-derived enforcement conditions, lb and ub are set to
  e− and e+, respectively (see Methods). (c) Reaction pathway schematic showing the
  top 29 reactions from host-derived flux enforcement analysis and their associated
  antiviral drugs and inhibitors. Key reactions inhibiting virus optima when flux
  ranges derived from host and virus flux variability analysis are enforced (the same
  reactions listed in electronic supplementary material, file S4). Abbreviations used
  for the compounds and reactions are as in electronic supplementary material, tables
  S2 and S3, respectively. Some of the identified reactions are interconnected, forming
  pathways. Coloured reaction arrows indicate pathways associated with subsystems:
  orange, pyrimidine synthesis; purple, pentose phosphate pathway; blue, purine synthesis;
  green, nucleotide biosynthesis. The starting metabolites into these pathways, glutamine
  and d-ribose 5-phosphate, are derived from glutamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate
  pathways. Reactions targeted by a known antiviral or inhibitor are marked by white
  and red filled stars and circles, respectively. Complete list of antiviral compounds
  from which the matches were obtained is provided as electronic supplementary material,
  table S1. A complete list of inhibitors and the associated reactions is provided
  as electronic supplementary material, file S4. A complete list of enforcement results
  for all reactions is provided as electronic supplementary material, files S2 and
  S5.'
