caption: Also shown is a schematic of the feedforward loop architecture. (A) The connector-mediated
  pathway activating the pbgP operon in S. enterica. Transcription of pbgP is promoted
  during growth in low Mg2+ via the PhoP/PhoQ system, PmrD protein and the PmrA/PmrB
  system; in the presence of Fe3+, it is promoted via the PmrA/PmrB system independently
  of PhoP/PhoQ and PmrD. The PmrA protein represses transcription of the pmrD gene.
  (B) The direct activation pathway promoting pbgP transcription in Y. pestis. Transcription
  of the pbgP gene is promoted during growth in low Mg2+ directly via the PhoP/PhoQ
  system, and in the presence of Fe3+ directly via the PmrA/PmrB system. The pmrD
  gene is absent from the Y. pestis genome (). (C) The feedforward connector loop
  activating pbgP in K. pneumoniae. Transcription of the pbgP gene is promoted during
  growth in low Mg2+ via the PhoP/PhoQ system, the PmrD protein and the PmrA/PmrB
  system, as well as directly by the PhoP protein binding to the pbgP promoter. In
  the presence of Fe3+, transcription is activated directly by the PmrA/PmrB system,
  independently of PmrD and PhoP/PhoQ. (D) The feedforward loop. A transcriptional
  regulator X controls gene z both directly and indirectly, via an additional transcriptional
  regulator Y that activates gene z.
