caption: (A) Low doses of doxorubicin are sufficient to trigger TP53-mediated transactivation
  of the cell cycle-arresting protein CDKN1A. Under conditions in which the MTOR pathway
  is active, prolonged cell cycle arrest results in irreversible senescence. (B) High
  doxorubicin concentrations (or nutlin-3a alone or in combination with low doses
  of doxorubicin) not only drive TP53-mediated CDKN1A transactivation but might also
  result in the induction of one (or more) senescence-suppressing factors. In this
  scenario, MTOR activity is suppressed and CDKN1A-mediated cell cycle arrest is reversible
  (quiescence). By pharmacologically inhibiting MTOR, rapamycin also exerts senescence-suppressing
  functions.
