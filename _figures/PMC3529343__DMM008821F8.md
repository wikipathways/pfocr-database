caption: Model of the Ang-1 pathway in early lung development. Proposed model of the
  Ang-1 pathway in early lung development (E12.5 to E15.5) hypothesizes that Ang-1
  (red) secreted by the distal lung bud acts in a trophic fashion on progenitor vascular
  endothelial cells expressing receptor Tie-2 (green) in the mesenchyme to induce
  downstream signaling and stabilization of the nascent vasculature. In later development
  (E18.5 to postnatal), the relationship between Ang-1 and Tie-2 contributes to the
  stabilization of the primary blood vessels associated with the central airways in
  the maturing lungs. PN, post-natal.
