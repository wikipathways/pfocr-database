caption: Pathophysiology of bilateral macronodular adrenal cortical disease and bilateral
  micronodular adrenal cortical disease In normal adrenocortical cells, the MC2R receptor
  is activated by ACTH, leading to the activation of the G subunits of the latter
  activates the adenylate cyclase, which converts the ATP in cAMP. The phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) inactivates cAMP in AMP. cAMP is binding by the regulatory (R) subunits of
  the PKA, leading to the release of the catalytic (C) subunits. The catalytic subunits
  phosphorylate their targets, including the cAMP Response Element-Binding protein
  (CREB), which activates genes involved in steroidogenesis. ARMC5 blocks the cell
  cycle in G1 phase and induces apoptosis. (A) In BMACD, the PKA pathway is activated
  by a ACTH locally produced by clusters of corticotropin adrenal cells, b mutations
  in the gene coding for MC2R, c mutations in gene GNAS, d mutations in phosphodiesterase
  genes, e duplication of the catalytic subunit C, and f ARMC5 mutations, which lead
  to the activation of the cell cycle and the loss of apoptosis. (B) In PPNAD and
  iMAD, the PKA pathway is activated by (a2) mutations in the regulatory subunit R
  of PKA and (b2) mutations in phosphodiesterases genes, and (c2) duplication of the
  catalytic subunit.
