caption: The disruption of various genes and signaling pathways, indicated to be important
  for proper cardiac neural crest (NC) contribution, results in numerous congenital
  heart defect (CHD) phenotypes. Such phenotypes include ventricular septal defect
  (VSD), various vascular defects including misalignment of the aorta and pulmonary
  trunks and aortic artery abnormalities, and outflow tract (OFT) alterations, such
  as OFT constriction and improper septation. Loss of Tbx1 in mice has been shown
  to alter the environment of migrating neural crest cells (NCCs), producing great
  vessel abnormalities and aortic arch interruption, while also presenting with VSD
  in patients. CHD7 mutations within NCCs can produce septum defects such as VSD,
  and vascular alterations such as double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and interrupted
  aortic arch, along with inhibiting NC contributions to the OFT. In NCCs, disrupted
  Notch2 results in a narrowed OFT and OFT arteries, while mutations of all Notch-target
  genes (Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4) have been shown to result in VSD, along with
  vascular abnormalities such as pulmonic stenosis and aortic arch patterning defects.
  The deletion of a known bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) inhibitor, Ctdnep1, produced
  premature and asymmetric OFT septation, pulmonary closure, premature NCC compaction,
  and embryonic death, while the loss of the Bmp receptor Bmpr1a, resulted in shortened
  OFTs leading to persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), along with occasional aortic
  arch abnormalities. It was also found that the deletion of Smad4, located downstream
  of the Bmp network, also resulted in shortened OFTs, along with some hearts presenting
  with no OFT septation, resulting in PTA. The ablation of Yap and Taz, key components
  of the Hippo signaling pathway, in NCCs have been shown to disrupt smooth muscle
  expression and differentiation of the OFT. Deletions of BAF155 and BAF170 in NCCs
  have resulted in impaired NCC contribution for OFT development, while a loss of
  ARID1A, a BAF (Brg1/Brm-associated factors) subunit, has shown improper NC contribution
  for OFT development with producing conotruncal septation defects. The disruption
  of Pitx2 and Pitx2 upstream regulators suggests a negative impact on cardiac NC
  abilities for proper vasculature development. Hand2 deletions in NCCs present with
  a large variety of altered cardiac morphology, such as impaired OFT development,
  DORV, and VSD. Lack of OFT septation is also seen with the deletion of TGIF1 in
  NCCs. Deletion of Foxc1/2 in mice presents with lacking or shortened OFTs, along
  with improper OFT septation and PTA. Ao, aorta; Pv, pulmonary vessel; LV, left ventricle;
  RV, right ventricle; OFT, outflow tract. Created with Biorender.com (accessed on
