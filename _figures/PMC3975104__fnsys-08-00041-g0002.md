caption: 'A simplified model of some of the signaling pathways leading to LTD of the
  pf-PC synapse. Conjunctive glutamate (Glu) release at the granule cell (gc)/parallel
  fiber synapse on the Purkinje cell (PC) dendritic spine and the climbing fiber (from
  inferior olivary cells: ioc) synapses on the dendritic shaft activates the metabotropic
  glutamate receptor (mGluR1). Glutamate signaling across the synaptic cleft is modulated
  by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT). A signaling pathway via Gq proteins
  activates PLC. In turn, PLC signals via both the inositol triphosphate receptor
  (IP3R) and protein kinase C (PKC). The upshot is the internalization of synaptic
  AMPA receptors and consequent LTD. The overall process is also modulated by various
  other signals including: presynaptic nitric oxide release (NO); the binding of corticotropin-releasing
  factor (CRF) to its receptor (CRF-R1) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 binding
  to its receptor (IGF-1R), both of which signal via PLC; signaling via postsynaptic
  GABABR; and calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs).'
