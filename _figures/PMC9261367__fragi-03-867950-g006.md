caption: Treg cell failure in aging. Subtle and frank inflammatory states of the aging
  host have been attributed to a failure of immunosuppressive T regulatory (Treg)
  cells. Treg cells rely on an array of mechanisms targeting and suppressing effector
  T cells. CD8+ Treg cells function by releasing immunosuppressive exosomes that contain
  NOX2. Numbers and functional competence of such CD8 Treg cells decline with progressive
  age in healthy individuals, a process aggravated in the age-associated autoimmune
  disease giant cell arteritis. In aging CD8+ Treg cells, aberrant expression of NOTCH4
  redirects the trafficking of intracellular vesicles, essentially disrupting the
  release of immunosuppressive exosomes. Notch4 signaling targets multiple genes that
  guard the intracellular vesicle machinery, including RAB5, RAB7 and RAB11. Consequently,
  early lysosomes are directed towards the recycling pathway, trapping NOX2 in the
  cell, while formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) and exosome release are suppressed.
