caption: The scaffold protein SLP65, its binding partner CIN85 and liposomes (spherical
  vesicles) form liquid-like signaling condensates in the cytosol of resting B cells.
  Condensate formation is mediated through multivalent interactions between the proline-rich
  motifs of SLP65 and the SH3 domains of CIN85, and between the amino-terminal lipid-binding
  domain of SLP65 and vesicles. CIN85 is trimerized by its coiled-coil domain, which
  further increases its interaction valency. Upon B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation,
  the kinase SYK is recruited and activated at the BCR, which phosphorylates SLP65
  as the condensates approach the plasma membrane. Downstream pathways are further
  triggered including RAS activation, NF-κB mobilization and calcium influx.
