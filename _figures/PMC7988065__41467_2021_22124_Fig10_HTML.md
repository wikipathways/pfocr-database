caption: 'Prophase arrest (left box): both PP2A-B55δ and PKA are active, resulting
  in Arpp19 phosphorylation at S109. S109-phosphorylated Arpp19 locks the oocyte in
  prophase by an unknown mechanism, PKA contributes to this arrest through Arpp19
  phosphorylation and possibly other substrates, PP2A-B55δ prevents Cdk1 activation.
  Transduction pathway (middle box): in response to progesterone, PKA is inhibited
  while PP2A-B55δ stays active, allowing Arpp19 dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated
  Arpp19, possibly together with other dephosphorylated PKA substrates, launches a
  several hours long transduction pathway. Active PP2A-B55δ prevents Cdk1 activation,
  generating the time window necessary to set up the cascade of molecular events required
  for Cdk1 activation. M-phase entry (right box): Gwl is activated by a Cdk1 activity
  threshold and phosphorylates Arpp19 at S67 Hence, PP2A-B55δ is inhibited and Cdk1
  fully activated. This hysteretic switch triggers M-phase entry.'
