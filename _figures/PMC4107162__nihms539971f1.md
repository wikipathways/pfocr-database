caption: When an infected sand fly releases Leishmania promastigotes into the skin,
  they evade immediate host immune response and destruction by seeking refuge in different
  types of host cell, which includes dermal macrophages (), fibroblasts, keratinocytes
  and dendritic cells (DCs). Metacyclic promastigotes evade immediate destruction
  by deactivating the host’s complement system[, ]. In particular, lipophosphoglycan
  (LPG), which is highly expressed on the surface of metacyclic promastigotes, interferes
  with the insertion of membrane attack complex[] and promastigote specific kinases
  deactivate the classical and alternative complement pathway by phosphorylating complement
  proteins[]. Furthermore, the surface-membrane metalloprotease, glycoprotein 63 (known
  as gp63, leishmanolysin, or major surface protease), cleaves C3b attached to its
  surface, to an inactive form, C3bi, which facilitates the complement receptor 3
  (CR3) mediated entry into the host cells[]. Leishmania promastigotes gain entry
  into the dermal macrophages by utilizing the host CR3, which prevents the parasites
  from being killed by circulating phagocytes and nonimmune serum. Additionally, in
  dermal macrophages, which lack the respiratory burst machinery, promastigotes have
  enhanced ability to transform into and multiply as amastigotes compared to other
  macrophage populations[]. Similarly, both Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes
  are actively ingested by the skin fibroblasts[]. These cells provide a safe environment
  for Leishmania for up to 7 days post-infection, as they produce low levels of nitric
  oxide even in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ, compared to macrophages[].
  The saliva of sand flies has been shown to have hemostatic and immunomodulatory
  effects in the host which affect the infectivity and pathogenesis of Leishmania[].
  While many of these effects are common to the saliva from Old (Phlebotomus spp.)
  and New (Lutzomyia spp.) World sand flies, there also some effects that are different.
  Sand fly saliva contains a multitude of components, the most well described is the
  vasodilator protein called Maxadilan[, ]. Sand fly saliva increases the migration
  of inflammatory cells to the site of deposition, enhancing the interaction of Leishmania
  with potential host cells[]. The saliva from Lutzomyia longipalpis and Maxadilan
  alone decrease TNF-α, IL-10 and increase IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 production in LPS
  stimulated human macrophages[]. Maxadilan diminishes DTH responses in mice and inhibits
  T-cell activation[–], and Phlebotomus saliva upregulates Th2 responses and down-regulates
  Th1 responses in L. major infection[]. The saliva of Phlebotomus papatasi down-regulates
  NO production in LPS- or IFN-g activated macrophages[, ]. Repeat exposure of hosts
  to sand fly saliva induced antibody formation and cell-mediated responses to saliva
  proteins. Interestingly, pre-exposure to sand fly saliva has been shown to be protective
  to subsequent leishmania infection[, ], bringing forth the possibility is using
  saliva components as a vaccine[–]. Work is ongoing in order to understand how the
  responses to saliva protect against leishmaniasis or if the results of these studies
  in mice are applicable to humans[].
