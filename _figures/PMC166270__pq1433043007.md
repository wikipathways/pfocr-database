caption: Model for mechanisms governing w2 proliferation. An AG-dependent inhibitory
  pathway (black box) regulates an unknown molecule (S) that can elicit a block in
  w2 proliferation. In wild type, S is produced in w3 (or w4) and then is transmitted
  to w2 (dashed line), where it activates an inhibitor (I). Note that the signaling
  molecule could be the inhibitor. Inhibition is overcome by two w2 promoting mechanisms.
  First, AP2, LUG, SAP, SEU, and ANT genes repress AG transcription in w2. Ectopic
  expression of AG antagonizes AP1 transcription (, ). Second, an AP1- and UFO-dependent
  pathway functions downstream of AG to overcome the action of I.
