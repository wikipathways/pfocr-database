caption: B. pseudomallei is diffused from the external reservoir to respiratory epithelial
  cells where the initial attachment initiates possibly through capsule and type IV
  pili. Upon invasion of epithelial cells, the T3SS-3 effectors promote in vacuolar
  evade and intracellular motility via BimA-mediated actin polymerization. Subsequent
  to phagocytosis, B. pseudomallei exits the phagosome and enters the host cytoplasm
  to replicates. This eventually causes the host cell death through initiation of
  apoptosis. The B. pseudomallei LPS regulates IFN secretion, which down-regulates
  iNOS expression and NO production. Also, B. pseudomallei influence the regulation
  of suppressor of cytokine signalling and cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing
  proteins that obstruct the JAK–STAT signalling pathway and iNOS activation.
