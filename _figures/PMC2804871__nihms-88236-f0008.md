caption: A model of how proposed common signaling components in ABA and PAMP responses
  act to regulate guard cell K+ channels. The model is drawn based on the new information
  provided by this study (shown in red) and references cited in the Discussion. Note
  that a parsimonious model is shown; thus, if component A is known to activate both
  component B and component C, and component B is also known to activate component
  C, then the pathway is drawn as A activates B and B activates C.
