caption: A proposed model of PA-participated signaling pathway in plants for urea-elicited
  alleviation of ammonium stress. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins
  (G-protein) anchor to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and are coupled to
  a putative G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) specific for external urea. The GPCR
  recognizes and binds to urea, leading to its conformation change for the activation
  of the G-protein(s), by which a membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase (AC) is activated
  to generate a second messenger cAMP. Increased cAMP activates downstream some unknown
  molecular component(s) to eventually modify biosynthesis pathways for PA production;
  the increased cAMP might also activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase to directly
  modulate the stress response. The subsequent activation of phospholipase C or D
  (PLC or PLD) by PAs promotes the generation of PIP2-derived signal molecule IP3/DAG
  and/or phosphatidic acid in the cytosol, resulting in the activation of an unknown
  inner membrane ion-channel(s) for Ca2+ release. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ will
  initiate different cellular processes for specifically regulating plant growth and
  development under given conditions, e.g., NH4+-stress with the presence of urea.
  This model postulated for PA-involved urea-antagonized NH4+-stress is based on our
  recent findings (; ) and intensive surveys of related publications cited in this
  study. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol-triphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol.
