caption: Distinct metabolic pathways identified in patients with COPD following a
  TB infection. The diagram shows a map of metabolic biomarkers exclusively selected
  in patients with TB-induced COPD. The red square indicates increased levels of metabolites
  in the serum of patients with COPD, whereas blue indicates decreased levels. The
  arrow indicates the possible direction of the metabolic pathway based on the KEGG
  database.
