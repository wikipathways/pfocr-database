caption: Several mechanisms have been proposed by which PrPC to PrPSc conversion results
  in neurodegeneration. PrPSc might produce mitochondrial stress, leading to apoptosis
  by the well-known pathway involving translocation of the proapoptotic proteins Bax
  and Bad and the release of cytochrome C, which forms the apoptosome []. Formation
  of this complex activates caspase-9, which in turn activates the executor caspase-3.
  An alternative model implicates sustained ER stress []. Chronic ER stress results
  in the activation of the ER-resident caspase-12 (caspase-4 in humans), which in
  turn cleaves and activates caspase-3 []. Another proposed mechanism by which ER
  stress leads to neurodegeneration involves hyperactivation of the phosphatase calcineurin
  owing to extensive calcium release from the ER. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates
  several important proteins, including the transcription factor CREB and the proapoptotic
  protein Bad, resulting in synaptic damage and neuronal death. Several or all of
  these pathways and perhaps others (such as autophagy or neuronal death induced by
  synaptic and dendritic loss) could be operating simultaneously in the brain of prion-infected
  individuals, which would explain why knocking out one specific signaling pathway
  does not substantially change the progression of the disease.
