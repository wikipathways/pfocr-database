caption: 'Multimodality targeting of MM in the context of the BM microenvironment.
  In the center is the MMC (in light pink), with nuclear clumped chromatin and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The surrounding 5 sections each represent a different modality of
  anti-MM therapy, with investigational agents outlined in red. In section A is the
  UPS, closely interacting with the aggresome pathway. Deubiquitinating enzymes USP7
  and USP14/UCHL5 are symbolized by a scissors and the 19S ubiquitin (Ub) receptor
  RPN13 as a receptor associated with the proteasome cap. Section B contains the monoclonal
  antibodies mAbs) daratumumab (DARA) and SAR650984 (SAR), targeting CD38, as well
  as elotuzumab (ELO), targeting SLAMF-7, which mediate CDC, direct cytotoxicity from
  cross-linking, and ADCC. The antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) indatuximab ravtansine
  (BT062) and J6M0-mcMMAF (J6M0) target CD138 and BCMA, respectively. Both toxins
  cause mitotic arrest and apoptosis after being released intracellularly upon internalization
  of the ADC–target complex and lysosomal lysis. Section C represents several strategies
  for modulation of cytotoxic immunity. In red is an anti-BCMA CAR-T cell; in orange
  is an MM-specific cytotoxic T cell activated via direct interaction with MM-DC vaccine
  or with autologous DC presenting peptides from the PVX-140 vaccine. Two different
  strategies to modulate epigenetic control of oncosuppressor and oncogene expression
  are outlined in section D. Nucleosomes are represented as spheres (histones) wrapped
  in a black thread (DNA). Open nucleosomes with acetylated (Ac) sites are green,
  whereas closed chromatin structure is pink. The BET bromodomain 4 protein (BRD4)
  is represented as a red trapezoid, binding to acetylated nucleosomes and inducing
  Myc transcription. Section E contains a representation of immune checkpoint blockade,
  with cytotoxic T and NK-T cells represented in green and blue, respectively. PD-1
  and its ligand PD-L1 are represented as complementary transmembrane structures on
  effector cells and target cells (MMCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs],
  and pDCs), respectively. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and
  killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) are also pictured on effector cells.
  Outside the sections, TH-302 hypoxia–activated alkylating agent and NOX-A12 CXCL12
  inhibitor are represented. In the 4 corners are key cellular and noncellular elements
  of the BM niche that contribute to MM pathogenesis: excess of osteoclasts (OC) compared
  to osteoblasts (OB; upper left corner); increased neoangiogenesis (upper right corner);
  tumor-tolerant immune system (lower right corner); and cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAF) responsible for the secretion of a pro-MM extracellular matrix (ECM), and
  MM-associated BM stromal cells (BMSC; lower left corner). Relevant cytokines in
  the BM milieu are represented as orange ovals. FcR, Fc receptor; HATs, histone acetylases;
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; MIP-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α; PD-L1,
  programmed cell death ligand 1; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; RBC,
  red blood cell; TCR, T-cell receptor; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; TH17,
  T helper 17 cells; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; Treg, regulatory T cell; VEGFA,
  vascular endothelial growth factor A.'
