caption: 'Effects of alterations in mTOR signaling pathway on spermatogenesis. Pten
  inactivation with the germ line-specific Vasa-Cre (Tg(Ddx4-cre)1Dcas) results in
  severe defects in spermatogonial maintenance and differentiation, in part through
  Foxo1. It was identified a role for PLZF-mediated Redd1 expression in inhibiting
  mTORC1 activation in spermatogonial progenitor cells. Conditional knockout of Rheb
  resulted in severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, defects in meiotic and post-meiotic
  stages of spermatogenesis and decreased epididymal sperm numbers. mTOR inactivation
  by rapamycin downregulated phosphorylated p70S6K (p-p70S6K) and rpS6 (p-rpS6). Studies,
  in vitro and in vivo, reported that upon mTOR inactivation by rapamycin, the number
  of sperms significantly decreased and spermatogonia proliferation was blocked. SCF/c-kit
  system also uses the rapamycin sensitive PI3K/Akt/p70S6K/cyclin D3 pathway to promote
  spermatogonial proliferation. PLFZ: Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger; c-kit: c-kit-encoded
  transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Pten: Phosphatase and tensin homolog; Foxo1: forkhead box O1; Rheb: Ras
  homolog enriched in brain GTPase; S6K1 or p70S6K: S6 kinase 1; rpS6: ribosomal protein
  S6; SCF: stem cell factor. (see color version of this figure at www.informahealthcare.com/bmg).'
