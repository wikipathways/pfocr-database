caption: The regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway depends on multiple different
  stimuli. When nutrients are not present mTORC1 is not recruited to lysosomes. Conversely,
  FLCN is recruited to the lysosome through an interaction with RagA-GDP, downstream
  of GATOR1 GAP activity (shown in pink). Low energy levels activate AMPK (activation
  is shown in black arrows) which is thought to phosphorylate Raptor and TSCC, both
  events having an inhibitory effect on mTORC1 activity (inhibition is shown in black
  lines with a bar at the end). AMPK is also thought to bind and phosphorylate FLCN-FNIP
  (putative binding is indicated by a doted black line terminated with black dots).
  In the reverse situation, when nutrients and growth factors are available, FLCN
  disperses from the lysosome, after exerting its GAP activity toward RagC, to leave
  space for mTORC1 recruitment, while GATOR1 is inhibited by GATOR2 and Ragulator
  and SLC38A9 exert their GEF activity toward RagA. The appropriate Rag GTPase nucleotide
  state recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome. In parallel, growth factors inhibit TSCC
  which in turn exposes Rheb on the lysosomal surface to allosterically activate mTORC1.
