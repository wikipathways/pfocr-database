caption: Androgen receptor (AR) signalling and the PI3K pathway have been shown to
  regulate each other by reciprocal negative feedback in PTEN negative cells. We show
  that the PI3K regulatory subunit PIK3R1 (p85α) is a direct target of the AR which
  is rapidly repressed by androgens in prostate cancer cells. The data presented suggests
  a context-dependent regulatory mechanism whereby repression of the p85α protein
  by the AR results in destabilisation of the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit downstream
  PI3K pathway inhibition.
