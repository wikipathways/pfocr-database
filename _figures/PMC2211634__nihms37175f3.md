caption: 'Models for the dual roles of KLF4 and KLF5 in tumor suppression and oncogenesis.
  A: KLF4 normally acts as a tumor suppressor through p21Cip1/Kip1-dependent cell
  cycle arrest. However, in the presence of an oncogenic signal (such as Rasv12),
  the p21Cip1/Kip1pathway is inactivated, and the anti-apoptotic activity of KLF4
  provides a survival advantage, allowing for cellular transformation. B: The pro-proliferative
  activity of KLF5 contributes to transformation in response to oncogenic signals,
  such as H- or K-Ras. However, in certain contexts, KLF5 may also possess growth
  inhibitory activities in the presence of an oncogenic signal that allow it to act
  as a tumor suppressor, overriding its growth-promoting effects.'
