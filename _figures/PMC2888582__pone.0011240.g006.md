caption: Network generated with proteins involved in cell-to-cell signaling biological
  process using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) as described in . Each node represents
  a protein; proteins in shaded nodes were found in either GV oocyte or cumulus cell
  or both (see ). Proteins in red and green nodes were higher and lower, respectively,
  in cumulus cells compared with GV oocytes.
