caption: RAGE signaling in endothelial cells and leukocytes. (1) Increased circulating
  calprotectin-positive monocytes and neutrophils and increased serum calprotectin
  levels are characteristic of CKD. (2) Priming endothelial cells with AGE prior to
  stimulation with calprotectin increases the production of chemokines CCL2 and IL-6.
  (3) S100A9 induces leukocyte cell surface expression of Mac-1. (4) Calprotectin
  activation of RAGE and Ang II activation of the Ang II type I receptor (AT1R) induces
  NF-kB and increased cell surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1,
  which enhances leukocyte adhesion to Mac-1. (5) Ang II-induced NF-kB promotes the
  expression and production of AT1R, RAGE, DIAPH1, and HMGB1. (6) Ang II induces endothelial
  permeability by inducing the phosphorylation of Src in a RAGE- and DIAPH1-dependent
  manner. (7) Blocking AT1R with an AT1R blocker, losartan, or RAGE with soluble RAGE
  (sRAGE) reduces endothelial permeability, which facilitates leukocyte diapedesis
  and extravasation.
