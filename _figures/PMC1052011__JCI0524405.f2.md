caption: PGC-1α is an integrator of the transcriptional network regulating mitochondrial
  biogenesis and function. Numerous signaling pathways, including Ca2+-dependent,
  NO, MAPK, and β-adrenergic pathways (β3/cAMP), activate the PGC-1α directly by increasing
  either PGC-1α expression or activity. Additionally, the p38MAPK pathway selectively
  activates PPARα, which may bring about synergistic activation in the presence of
  PGC-1α, whereas ERK-MAPK has the opposite effect. These signaling pathways transduce
  physiological stimuli, such as stress, fasting, and exercise, to the PGC-1α pathway.
  PGC-1α, in turn, coactivates transcriptional partners, including NRF-1 and -2, ERRα,
  and PPARα, which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and FA-oxidation pathways. Dashed
  lines indicate activation mediated by signal transduction pathways in contrast to
  the coactivation by PGC-1α, which is denoted by solid lines. The arrows from ERRα
  to the NRFs and the PPAR complex indicate that ERRα activates these pathways at
  the level of expression.
