caption: (A) The figure shows the PI-PLC protein, which participates in the IP3 and
  IP4 synthesis pathways and mobilizes calcium to regulate cell reactions and proliferation
  requiring free calcium. This study showed that the presence of CKD inhibited PI-PLC
  expression. As a result, the IP3 and IP4 synthesis signaling pathway is impaired,
  decreasing or inhibiting the expression of IP3 and IP4 decreasing the mobilization
  of intracellular calcium. It is hypothesized that this dysregulation of calcium
  mobilization may progress to CKD-MBD (arrows in red show pathway advancement from
  the CKD patient hypothesis). (B) The figure shows the increased expression of transcription
  factors such as Snail from the activation of TFG-β receptor-dependent pathways (TGF-β1-Smad2/3
  and p38 and Akt), which lead to decreased epithelial phenotypes and increased mesenchymal
  phenotypes. When there is a decrease or no expression of epithelial markers, there
  is an increase in the expression of transcription factors, such as Slug and Twist-1,
  which also lead to the inhibition of the epithelial phenotype and increase of the
  mesenchymal phenotype. This change in the phenotypic profile promotes the epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition, which leads to renal fibrosis. This study showed that patients with
  CKD did not express the Sgsm2 protein, and the hypothesis is that the absence of
  this protein leads to a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and b-catenin,
  increasing the expression of mesenchymal markers and decreasing epithelial markers
  favoring EMT and, consequently, increasing renal fibrosis
