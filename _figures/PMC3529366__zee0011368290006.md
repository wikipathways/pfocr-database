caption: BMP2-WNT4-FOXO1 pathway in HESC differentiation. BMP2 is induced in response
  to steroid hormones and cAMP in HESCs. BMP2 activates Smad1/5/8-mediated signaling
  pathway to promote WNT4 expression. WNT4 then functions via β-catenin-dependent
  signaling pathway to induce FOXO1 and its downstream genes to regulate differentiation
  of HESCs. FOXO1 also may be an essential maintenance factor for WNT4 expression.
  In addition, BMP2 controls expression of several WNT inhibitors including Dickkopf
  proteins and, secreted frizzled-related proteins to fine tune WNT signaling in HESCs.
