caption: Working model of the oncogenic potential of SGG UCN34. Chronic colonization
  of host colon with SGG UCN34 induces the activation of MAPK cascades, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling and integrin/ILK/actin cytoskeleton pathways. SGG UCN34 alters multiple
  signaling pathways found downstream of EGF and FGF receptors present on colonic
  epithelial cells, but also downstream of PDGFA receptor present in stromal cells.
  SGG UCN34 induces the expansion of Pdpn+CD34+ cell in the stromal compartment, which
  regulates epithelial cells differentiation/proliferation. All these events contribute
  to pre-cancerous transformation of colon epithelium and acceleration of tumor development.
