caption: A simplified model of the signaling pathway that leads to ASH-mediated reversals.
  Stimuli that are sensed by ASH (in this article we test nose touch and high osmolarity,
  and use optogenetic stimulation of ASH) cause the release of glutamate from ASH.
  These glutamatergic signals are received by interneurons, including the command
  interneuron AVA, which send signals to DA/VA motor neurons that cause the initiation
  of a reversal. Our data supports a model in which DMD-10 acts to promote glutamate
  release by ASH.
