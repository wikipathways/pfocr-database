caption: Zebrafish was exposed to six different chemicals at varying concentrations
  and exposure durations. Upon exposure to these chemicals, the underneath homeostatic
  process as schematically illustrate in the pyramid will be initiated. The arrow
  beside illustrates the spread of homeostatic signals from smaller molecular scale
  to larger scale composing pathway networking. These chemicals will trigger conformational
  changes of signaling receptors and enzymes, resulting differential gene expression
  causing altered proteome content. If the chemicals are above certain threshold levels
  that a fish can cope for maintaining its normal physiological equilibrium, rewiring
  of molecular pathways via deregulated gene expression can take place leading to
  inverted profiles of hubs. The inverted functionality of hubs can be perceived as
  a two-component bistable switch that toggles a cell from one state to another, leading
  to toxicopathological states at either Scheme A (activation of hubs among Group
  A with suppression of hubs among Group B) or Scheme B (activation of hubs among
  Group B with suppression of hubs among Group A), depending on how the overall molecular
  rewiring drives the cell in navigating the toxicopathological landscape.
