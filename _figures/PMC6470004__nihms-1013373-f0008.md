caption: 'Biosynthetic model for type A malyngamides: Group A1 in pink, Group A2 in
  orange, Group A3 in light green, and group A4 in aqua. Untailored “base” chemical
  species are noted in each category by six uncolored circles and underline. Predicted
  tailoring differences from base species due to pathway diversity are indicated by
  coloration of the six circles next to each head group, with key to tailoring predictions
  in lower left. Differences to “base’ group molecule are organized into six main
  categories: P450–1; P450 equivalent to MgcT (epoxidation), P450–2; P450 equivalent
  to MgcU (hydroxylation), Elim; pattern of post-cyclization hydroxyl elimination,
  AcylT; acetyltransferase activity, AA/β-B; amino acid incorporation or β-branching/halogenation
  cassette, and MT/Other; methyltransferase, cyclization, or other transformations.'
