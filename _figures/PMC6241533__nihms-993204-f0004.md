caption: Approaches targeting endogenous cardiac regeneration (green boxes) involve
  activating the proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes and targeting the cardiac
  fibrotic response. Cardiomyocyte proliferation can be induced by overexpressing
  cell cycle-related genes or by inhibiting cell cycle suppressors such as the transcription
  factor homeobox protein MEIS1 or the Hippo signalling pathway (red boxes). Alternatively,
  approaches to mimic the neonatal cardiac environment by exposure to hypoxia or mechanical
  unloading or by providing the extracellular matrix protein agrin also evoke cardiomyocyte
  proliferation. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) and angiotensin have a pivotal
  role in inducing cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts during cardiac
  injury, thereby inducing cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, other cell lineages are
  proposed to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system (RAAS) and the WNT signalling pathway also contribute to cardiac fibrosis.
  These fibrotic processes (blue boxes) can be targeted to attenuate cardiac remodelling.
  The dashed arrows indicate incompletely understood mechanisms.
