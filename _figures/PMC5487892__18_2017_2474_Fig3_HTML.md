caption: DNA substrates and protein factors required for S-phase checkpoint activation.
  a High amounts of ssDNA–RPA complexes at stalled forks and primer–template substrates
  can be induced by uncoupling of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis, uncoupling
  between DNA polymerases and MCM DNA helicase, by discontinuous synthesis of the
  nascent strands, by hyper-priming activity of Polα, unwinding or resection of one
  of the nascent strands. b Simplified representation of the replication fork and
  some replisome components. Protein factors shown in yellow are involved in the activation
  of the Mec1Rad3/ATR–Rad53 Cds1/CHK1 checkpoint pathway following dNTP deprivation.
  Physical and functional interactions instrumental to checkpoint activation are indicated
  through arrows and dashed lines, respectively (related to "")
