caption: Omega-3 fatty acid pathway. The human omega-3 fatty acid metabolism pathway
  is composed of 12 enzymes. The enzymes colored in red are not found in fish. The
  three enzymes in yellow are in the gene families found in fish, but the presence
  of these specific enzymes is not clear. This shows that fish lack enzymes to convert
  the intermediate metabolites, which are the source of omega-3 fatty acids important
  to human health. The common omega-3 fatty acid variants are in red font.
