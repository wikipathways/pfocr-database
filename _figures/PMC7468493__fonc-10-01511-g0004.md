caption: Roles of key processes in cancer stem cell metabolism during metastasis.
  Energy production occurs through the enhanced ATP production via glycolysis, amino
  acid metabolism (greater acetyl-CoA production), and OXPHOS (efficient use of nutrients).
  Furthermore, energy is also induced by hypoxia as HIF-1a and 2a (elevated GLUT1,
  ALDH, and PDH) both lead to OXPHOS and glycolysis. Additionally, potential damage
  to cells is reduced by NADPH as FAO activity and the Warburg effect increases, leading
  glycolytic intermediates to PPP. As hypoxia increases, the pH levels decrease, leading
  to MMP and ECM remodeling. Meanwhile, HIF-2a induces CD44 variants and the NOTCH
  signaling pathway, both activities acting in concert with decreased pH levels, thereby
  leading CSC to migration, invasion, and EMT.
