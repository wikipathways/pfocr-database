caption: 'Schematic representation of the hypothesis proposed for the B[a]P-mediated
  metabolic flux redistribution. B[a]P exposure leads to the disturbance in the cellular
  redox state and hence to an increase in NADPH content of the cells by redirecting
  the metabolic flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). It is indicated
  by the down-regulation of glycolytic proteins and an up-regulation of PPP proteins.
  The grey boxes represent the differentially regulated proteins identified by 2D
  BN/SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, whereas the pink boxes represent the metabolites
  identified by GC-MS analysis. Abbreviations: G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
  GPI: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase isoform 1, ALD: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, LDH:
  lactate dehydrogenase, FABP4: adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, 6GPL: 6-phosphogluconolactonase,
  NME: nucleoside diphosphate kinase, ATIC bifunctional purine biosynthesis protein,
  IDH1: cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase, ALDH1L1: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase,
  THF: tetrahydrofolate, GSH: glutathione.'
