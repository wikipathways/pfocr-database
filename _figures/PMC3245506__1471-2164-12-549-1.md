caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in HMGA1 transgenics at 2 months
  (nonparametric CAM approach). IPA was performed on microarray data comparing transgenic
  to control lymphoid cells from mice. Using 113 differentially expressed genes as
  the focus gene set identified by nonparametric analysis, the highest-scoring network
  was Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Hematological System Development and
  Function, and Inflammatory Response (score = 50). Red nodes indicate up-regulation;
  green nodes indicate down-regulation. Arrows and lines denote interactions between
  specific genes within the network. A, activation; E, expression regulation; I, inhibition;
  L, proteolysis; LO, localization; M, biochemical modification; MB, membership of
  a group or complex; P, phosphorylation; PD, protein-DNA interaction; PP, protein-protein
  interaction; PR, protein-RNA interaction; RB, regulation of binding; RE, reaction;
  T, transcription; TR, translocation.
