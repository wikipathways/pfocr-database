caption: 'Potential targets for immunosuppressive drugs. Three distinct signals are
  required for the activation and differentiation of alloreactive T-cells into proliferating
  effector T-cells. In addition to antigen recognition, full T-cell activation requires
  a costimulatory signal (signal 2) provided by the antigen-presenting cell (APC).
  The activation of signal 1 and 2 initiates a cascade of downstream signaling pathways
  and the induction of transcription factors, leading to the expression of new surface
  molecules such as inducible costimulatory molecules and cytokine receptors. Interleukin-2
  (IL-2) and other cytokines can then deliver growth and proliferation signals (signal
  3) via the phophoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and the mammalian target-of-rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathways, initiating the cell cycle. Whereas calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine
  and tacrolimus) inhibit the calcium-calcineurin pathway and alloantigen-dependent
  T-cell activation, anti-proliferative agents (azathioprine, mycophenolic acid [MPA],
  mTOR-inhibitors) inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. MPA selectively blocks an important
  step in the de novo synthesis of purine by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
  (IMPDH), an essential pathway for lymphocyte division.Abbreviation: NFAT, nuclear
  factor of activated T cells.'
