caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways associated with γδT cell cytotoxicity
  and cytokine production. The phosphorylation of Vav1 and PLC-γ1 is essential to
  lytic granule polarization and cytokine release during γδT cell-mediated cytotoxicity,
  whereas the phosphorylation of Erk is only associated with cytokine release. Cbl-b
  has an inhibitory effect on Vav1-dependent γδT cell activation signals, and PKC-θ
  plays a critical role in the activation of γδT cell cytotoxicity by regulating the
  balance of phosphorylation of Vav1 and Cbl-b. DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

  Receptor (TCRγδ) Activation Is Required to Overcome Inhibition by Ubiquitin Ligase
