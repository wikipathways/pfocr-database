caption: Backbone and headgroup relational depiction of mammalian sphingolipid biosynthesis.
  This alternative depiction of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis displays how the
  pathway can be envisioned to start with a fatty acyl-CoA (palmitoyl-CoA in lower
  portion of panel A) that is condensed with Ser to form 3-ketosphinganine then sphinganine
  (at the center of the fan), which is N-acylated to produce different chain-length
  dihydroceramides (represented by the ring, with examples of chain lengths labeled
  in blue). Each dihydroceramide subspecies can be converted into families of dihydro-complex
  sphingolipids, which are symbolized by the blades. The upper portion of panel A
  shows some of the complex sphingolipids within each wedge (which are only a fraction
  of the actual number of compounds that can be made, as illustrated by Figures  and
  , and the discussion in the text). Panel B displays further complexities related
  to the lipid backbones. The upper portion of panel B illustrates how the dihydroceramides
  from each sphingoid base backbone (in this case, d18:0 from palmitoyl-CoA) can be
  hydroxylated to phytoceramides (t18:0) and/or desaturated to ceramides (d18:1) (c.f.,
  Figure ); the latter is also presumed to undergo further desaturation to form N-acyl-sphingadienes
  (d18:2). The blades radiating from each N-acyl-chain subspecies represents the complex
  sphingolipids, as explained for panel A. The lower portion of panel B shows that
  Ala or Gly are alternatively used by serine palmitoyltransferase to form m18:0 and
  m17:0 which are N-acylated and, to some degree, desaturated to N-acyl-m18:1’s and
  N-acyl-m17:1 (to date, backbone hydroxylation has not been noted). Note that these
  do not radiate into larger blades because headgroups cannot be added. Not shown
  are the utilization of other fatty acyl-CoAs, which would constitute parallel schemes
  like these, nor pathways where sphingolipids are turned over to generate intermediates
  that are recycled or turned over (although one can envision this occurring within
  the blades to return to the hub, with the apex of the hub representing the free
  sphingoid base). The symbols and abbreviations are the same as have been used in
  the other figures in this Review.
