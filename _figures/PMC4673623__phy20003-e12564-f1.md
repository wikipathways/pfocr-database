caption: Simplified diagram of one-carbon metabolism (1-CM) including the methionine
  cycle, the roles of one-carbon nutrients, and links to lipid metabolism. Methionine
  (Met) can be synthesized from homocysteine (Hcy) in a reaction catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT) using the choline metabolite betaine as the methyl donor.
  Alternatively, the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine can proceed via the
  folate and vitamin B-12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) reaction. Choline, betaine,
  folate, and vitamin B-12 have critical roles in lipid metabolism because they contribute
  to the production of phosphatidylcholine (PC) via the phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
  (PEMT) pathway, which is necessary for the formation of very-low-density-lipoproteins
  (VLDL) and the removal of triglycerides (TGs) from the liver. DMG, dimethylglycine;
  LDL, low density lipoprotein; MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; PE,
  phosphatidylethanolamine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
