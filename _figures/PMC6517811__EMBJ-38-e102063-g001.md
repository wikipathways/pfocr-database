caption: In starved cells, glucose transporter mRNA and protein are restricted to
  the mother cell until the metaphase–anaphase transition. Upon refeeding with glucose,
  the HXT2 mRNA and protein are enriched in the daughter cell, conferring a growth
  advantage to the daughter cells. Appearance of glucose after starvation activates
  the Ras signaling pathway which then stimulates adenylate cyclase (Cyr1). Cyclic
  AMP alleviates repression of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn promotes HXT2
  mRNA partitioning, possibly by phosphorylating components of the nuclear pore complex
  (NPC). HXT2 mRNA partitioning to the daughters requires the cytoskeleton, spindle
  pole body (SPB), and nuclear segregation.
