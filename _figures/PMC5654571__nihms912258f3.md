caption: Stool metabolomic pathway network analysis of lipid, cofactor and vitamin
  metabolites significantly different in rice bran consumers at 4 weeks compared with
  baseline. Pathway specific network views (Cytoscape) are presented for (a) steroid
  metabolism, (b) primary bile acid metabolism, (c) inositol metabolism, (d) cofactors
  and vitamin metabolism. Each metabolite is represented as a node, extending from
  a central metabolic pathway (with pathway impact score). A pathway set enrichment
  score ≥2 implies that pathway contains more metabolites of statistical significance
  relative to the entire study. The size of a node is proportional to the fold change
  between baseline and 4-week time points. A node coloured red represents metabolites
  with significantly (P ≤0·05) higher expression at 4 weeks compared with baseline.
  A node coloured dark green represents metabolites with significantly lower expression
  at 4 weeks compared with baseline. Nodes coloured pink or light green represent
  metabolites trending towards significance (0·05 < P ≤0·1) with higher expression
  at 4 weeks and lower expression at 4 weeks, respectively. CEHC, carboxyethyl-hydroxychroman.
