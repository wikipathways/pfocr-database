caption: Signaling pathways directly and indirectly linked to RhoA/ROCK-mediated activation
  of GSK3β and the positive feedback loop between Aβ deposition and GSK3β activation.
  (1) ROCK phosphorylates and activates PTEN, a phosphatase that inhibits the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3 into PIP2, preventing the activation
  of PKB (AKT). PKB inhibits GSK3β by Ser9 phosphorylation. The inhibition of PKB
  by RhoA/ROCK activates GSK3β; (2) Aβ ligation of p75NTR activates RhoA by Tyr42
  phosphorylation. Activated RhoA/ROCK phosphorylates and activates Src at the Tyr416
  residue. Activated Src phosphorylates and activates GSK3β at the Tyr216 residue,
  subsequently activating IKK. IKK phosphorylates IκB at Ser32/36, marking it for
  proteasomal degradation and impeding NF-κB inhibition. NF-κB increases BACE-1 expression,
  which increases the activity of amyloidogenic processing of APP into Aβ. Newly processed
  Aβ oligomers bind to p75NTR and complete the positive feedback cycle; (3) Aβ binds
  to the extracellular domains of FZD and LRP6, preventing Wnt ligand interactions
  with the LRP6/FZD complex and the successive inhibition of GSK3β. It is noteworthy
  that GSK3β is capable of phosphorylating PS1 and the Ser353 and 357 residues. However,
  the exact effect on Aβ processing is unclear; (4) overactivation of GSK3β induces
  AD pathogenesis such as Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, neurotic plaque
  formation, and cognitive decline
