caption: Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) bind receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) on the cell surface. This initiates intracellular signaling via the P13K/Akt/mTOR
  and Raf/Mek/ERK pathways, which promotes cell cycle progression within the cell
  nucleus. Cell cycle progression is activated by cyclins binding to cyclin-dependent
  kinases and inhibited by a number of proteins, including p16, p21, p27, p57, as
  well as p53, which acts by upregulating p21. Pituitary tumour transforming gene
  (PTTG) is an oncogene involved in multiple cellular processes, including induction
  of growth factors VEGF and FGF; downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, such as
  p21; and modulation of cell cycle progression. Targeted therapies have been developed,
  which interrupt the cellular signaling pathway at different points and act to downregulate
  cellular differentiation and proliferation in cancer.
