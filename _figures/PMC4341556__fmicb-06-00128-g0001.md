caption: 'Conservation of the Ras post-translational modification pathway in Aspergillus
  fumigatus. (A) Ras proteins transit a series of post-translational modifications
  to reach the plasma membrane. These include: (1) farnesylation of cytoplasmic Ras
  on a conserved cysteine residue by a dual subunit, protein farnesyltransferase enzyme
  complex; (2) cleavage of the C-terminal CAAX motif; (3) methylation of the processed
  C-terminus; and (4) palmitoylation of conserved cysteine residues upstream of the
  CAAX motif. Farnesylation is prerequisite for association with the endoplasmic reticulum,
  whereas palmitoylation is required for stable association with the plasma membrane.
  Inhibitors with activity against these processes in A. fumigatus include manumycin
  A and 2-bromopalmitate, targeting farnesylation and palmitoylation, respectively.
  FT = farnesyltransferase; RCE = Ras converting enzyme; ICMT = isoprenylcysteine
  carboxymethyltransferase; PAT = palmitoyltransferase. (B) Homologs of the protein
  components of the Ras post-translational modification pathway are shown. Protein
  lengths in amino acids (aa) are included with the GenBank accession numbers. Identity
  (%) was determined using protein alignments in Lasergene software (DNAstar). For
  reference, homologs of the yeast pathway are given in parentheses next to the A.
