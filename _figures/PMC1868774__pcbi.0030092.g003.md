caption: The thickness of the inductive signal (IS) arrows indicates the relative
  levels received by the three VPCs shown. With a low level of IS (the rightmost cell),
  the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway is below the threshold needed for induction (indicated
  in grey), and the VPC adopts the 3° fate. A high level of IS (the leftmost cell)
  activates the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway and induces the 1° fate. High IS also results
  in the production of a strong lateral signal (LS) by this VPC, the downregulation
  of LIN-12, and, as predicted by our computational model (see below), in the inhibition
  of the lst genes as indicated by the red line. The middle VPC receives a medium
  IS; however, the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway is counteracted (indicated in grey) by the
  lst genes activated by the strong LS from the leftmost VPC. The middle VPC thus
  adopts the 2° fate.
