caption: 'Thiamin metabolism in yeast and Arabidopsis and implications for rescuing
  yeast biosynthesis mutant lines. (a) Thiamin biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  (Sc) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At). Full arrows indicate the thiamin biosynthesis
  de novo steps, dashed arrows indicate breakdown and enzymatic salvage of HMP and
  HET. The yeast (Sc) and Arabidopsis (At) genes, coding for the enzymes catalyzing
  the specific enzymatic step, are indicated. AtTH1 (Ajjawi et al., ) codes for a
  multifunctional enzyme executing steps catalyzed by the yeast enzymes coded by ScTHI20,
  ScTHI21 and ScTHI6. Note that thiamin biosynthesis enzymes involved in the pyrimidine
  branch utilize different precursors in Arabidopsis as compared to yeast. The metabolites
  able to alleviate thiamin deficiency in human metabolism, therefore B1 vitamers,
  are indicated within the green square. The pyrimidine and thiazole branches of vitamin
  B1 (vitB1) biosynthesis are indicated within the blue and orange squares, respectively.
  (b) Five different S. cerevisiae mutant lines are listed and the different metabolites
  proposed to rescue each strain, based on the genetic and biosynthetic knowledge,
  are summarized. The list of metabolites is based on their occurrence in the thiamin
  biosynthesis pathway (metabolites downstream and/or able to bypass the mutated enzyme
  are proposed to rescue the mutant strain). The list of rescuing metabolites is deduced
  from the current knowledge of yeast thiamin metabolism, and assumes that (phosphorylated)
  metabolites can be adequately taken up by yeast cells. Supply of one (or multiple)
  of the listed metabolites is hypothesized to suffice to restore growth. Abbreviations:
  PLP, pyridoxal‐5′‐phosphate; His, histidine; AIR, aminoimidazole ribonucleotide;
  Gly, glycine; Cys, cysteine; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; HMP‐PP, 4‐amino‐2‐methyl‐5‐hydroxymethylpyrimidine
  ((pyro)phosphate); HET‐P, 4‐methyl‐5‐β‐hydroxyethylthiazole (phosphate); TMP, thiamin
  monophosphate; TPP, thiamin pyrophosphate.'
