caption: During development, HGF-Met binding promotes receptor kinase activation and
  tyrosyl phosphorylation of junctional β-catenin, resulting in its dissociation from
  E-cadherin and cytoplasmic accumulation. Wnt binding to Fzd and LRP5/6 induces Fzd
  activation, which stabilizes cytoplasmic β-catenin by protecting it from constitutive
  degradation. Cytoplasmic β-catenin from either pathway translocates to the nucleus,
  where it associates with members of TCF/LEF transcription factor family and promotes
  the expression of genes controlling cell motility, proliferation and matrix remodeling.
  In adult, fully differentiated renal epithelial cells, pVHL targets cytosolic β-catenin
  for degradation and balanced expression of Wnts and the negative regulators DKKs
  and sFRPs keeps Fzd activation, and thus cytosolic β-catenin, to a minimum.
