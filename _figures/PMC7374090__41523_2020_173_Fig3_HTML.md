caption: Results returned by the KEGG Pathway Engine for the essentialness of the
  Cell Cycle KEGG pathway in the SUM-149 cell line based on the screen hit data for
  that line. The KEGG Pathway Engine returns the pathway map with hit genes highlighted
  in red, and a table that shows for each hit gene, the rank in the screen, the expression
  level relative to normal cells as a Log2 ratio of the fold difference with respect
  to normal cells, and any targeted drugs associated with essential genes in the pathway.
