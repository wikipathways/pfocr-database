caption: The functions of circRNA modified by m6A. (a) m6A regulated the stability
  of circRNA. The m6A modification site of circRNA could be recognized by “reader”
  YTHDF2. HRSP12 linked YTHDF2 to RNase P/MRP complex, therefore regulating circRNA
  degradation by YTHDF2-HRSP12-RNase P/MRP pathway. (b) m6A promoted the translation
  of circRNA in a cap-independent manner. m6A modification could be recognized by
  “reader” YTHDF3, which further recruited translation initiation factor (such as
  eIF4G2 and eIF3A) and ribosome to IRES for m6A-initiated circRNA translation process.
  (c) m6A facilitated circRNA to act as miRNA sponge. (d) m6A regulated the interaction
  between RBP and circRNA. (e) m6A recognized and participated the immunoreaction
  mediated by circRNA. Exogenous RNA (without m6A modification) activated RIG-I under
  the circumstance of K63-polyubiquitin, and then led to the activation of interferon
  production through anti-viral signaling pathway. While the endogenous circRNA (modified
  by m6A) could be recognized by YTHDF2 and then this endogenous circRNA was marked
  as “self” circRNA, thus blocking the activation of RIG-I.
