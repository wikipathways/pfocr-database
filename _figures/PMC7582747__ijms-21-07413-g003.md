caption: 'The proposed regulation of PlGF and TGF-β in early diabetic retinopathy.
  Diabetes upregulates both PlGF and TGF-β in endothelial cells. PlGF can promote
  early diabetic retinopathy through the activation of VEGFR1 and Erk1/2 signaling,
  and the expression of downstream target genes, such as G6pdh (pentose phosphate
  pathway), Prdx3 and 6 (antioxidants), as well as the tight and adhesion junction
  genes (Cadh5, ZO1, and occludin). The transcription factor(s) that regulate downstream
  genes’ expressions are to be identified (question maker). Increased TGF-β by diabetes
  can protect the retina from diabetic injury in the early disease phase through the
  activation of TGFBR2/ALK5 signaling, which regulates the nuclear translocation of
  Smad2/3 and then activates the transcription of downstream target genes, such as
  Egf2, Edn2, and Pcam1. TGF-β can regulate PlGF through the unknown factor (question
  maker). Arrow lines: stimulation. Blunt line: inhibition.'
