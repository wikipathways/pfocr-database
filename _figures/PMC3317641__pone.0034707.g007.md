caption: Network two incorporated 17 focus genes (upregulated >2.5-fold) involved
  in cell cycle, embryonic development and tissue development. ACTB (actin, beta,
  cell motility), AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor, ubiquitin cycle), ASNS
  (asparagine synthetase, asparagines biosynthetic pathway), Caspase (caspase recruitment
  domain family, member 10, activation of NFκB inducing kinase), COTL1 (coactosin-like
  1 (Dictyostelium), carbohydrate metabolic process), DUSP14 (dual specificity phosphatase
  14, protein amino acid dephosphorylation), ENC1 (ectodermal-neural cortex (with
  BTB-like domain, actin binding), FOXC1 (forkhead box C1, transcription factor activity),
  GADD45B (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta, activation of MAPKK activity),
  GSPT1 (G1 to S phase transition 1, transition of mitotic cell cycle, translation),
  JUB (jub, ajuba homolog (Xenopus laevis), zinc ion binding), LDLR (low density lipoprotein
  receptor (familial hypercholesterolemia), lipid metabolic process), MYCN (v-myc
  myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (avian), regulation
  of transcription), PLAUR (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor, cell motility),
  SFN (stratifin, negative regulation of protein kinase activity), SOX9 (SRY (sex
  determining region Y)-box 9 (campomelic dysplasia, autosomal sex-reversal), cell
  fate specification), TNFSF4 (tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member
  4 (tax-transcriptionally activated glycoprotein 1, 34 kDa), immune response, cytokine
  activity).
