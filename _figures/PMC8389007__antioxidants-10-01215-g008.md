caption: Schematic representation of the inhibitory effect of fisetin on the NLRP3
  inflammasome in BV2 microglial cells. Fisetin inhibits the formation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome primarily via two signaling pathways. In the first signaling pathway,
  fisetin competitively antagonizes the recognition of LPS by the TLR4/MD2 complex
  by binding to SER438 of TLR4 and occluding the hydrophobic pocket of MD2. This inhibits
  the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, which consequently suppresses the transcription
  of IL-1β. In the second pathway, fisetin downregulates the production of mtROS by
  promoting the elimination of damaged mitochondria in a p62-dependent manner. The
  inhibition of mtROS production is associated with a decrease in the formation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome, which subsequently inhibits the caspase-1-mediated cleavage
  of pro-IL-1β to active IL-1β. P2RX7, P2X purinoceptor 7.
