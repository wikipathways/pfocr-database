caption: Mechanisms used by Toxoplasma gondii, type I strain, to modulate mainly immune
  system at its favor. (A) Interfering with cell-autonomous immunity. In infection
  with virulent strain (e.g., type I), the polymorphic effector proteins like ROP5,
  ROP17, and ROP18 cooperate to phosphorylate and inactivate mouse IRG proteins to
  preserve PVM integrity. In human cells (endothelial, retinal pigment epithelial,
  and microglia), T. gondii activates EGFR-Akt signaling to prevent targeting of the
  parasite by LC3 structures and pathogen killing dependent on autophagy proteins
  and lysosomal protease activity. (B) Cell signaling interference. The Toxoplasma
  rhoptry 16 kinase (ROP16), ROP18, and 38 can mediate the induction of arginase-1,
  suppress toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-12, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) through
  phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and
  6. T. gondii also interferes with STAT1 signaling, resulting in blockage of interferon
  regulatory factor 1 (Irf1), p65 guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS/Nos2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC). Furthermore, the infection upregulation SOCS1, 2 and 3. Together,
  T. gondii inhibiting pro-inflammatory response in different ways. (C) Silencing
  microbicide molecules. T. gondii [phosphatidylserine positive (PS+)] infection of
  murine blood monocyte-derived and peritoneal macrophages activated in vitro with
  IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lead to a substantial decrease in NO production.
  Decreased mechanisms include phosphorylation of STAT6 by ROP16 resulting in arginine
  degradation and induction of TGFβ1 through Smad 2 and 3 leading to destruction of
  iNOS, actin filament (F-actin) depolymerization, and lack of NF-κB in the nucleus.
  (D) Maintaining the host cell alive. T. gondii has several strategies for inhibiting
  the initiation of the apoptotic cascade triggered by mitochondrial pathway or death
  receptor pathway in infected cells. The effector proteins like ROP16, ROP18, and
  ROP38 phosphorylate STAT3 and STAT6 and promotes mechanisms that include blocking
  of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, alterations of the balance between pro- and
  anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, degradation of caspase 8, blocking Fas/CD95-mediated
  apoptosis, and inactivation of effector caspases (-3, -6, -7) in infected cells.
