caption: The Hippo-YAP pathway regulate the inflammation response in heart failure
  and cardiomyopathy. YAP increases the accumulation of inflammatory cells and impairs
  cardiac function in chronic pressure overload while hardly affects the accumulation
  of inflammatory cells in acute pressure overload. In dilated cardiomyopathy, global
  knockout of Tead1 and cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Tead1 both can increase
  inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines production to impair
  heart function. Both in diabetic cardiomyopathy and septic cardiomyopathy, YAP is
  able to inhibit inflammatory cells recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines production,
  thereby improve heart function. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
