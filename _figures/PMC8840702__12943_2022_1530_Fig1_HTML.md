caption: 'Mechanisms governing ferroptosis and reversing chemotherapy resistance.
  Three pathways initiate the process of ferroptosis and chemotherapy resistance reversal:
  the canonical GPX4-regulated pathway, iron metabolism pathway and lipid metabolism
  pathway. Regulation of the canonical GPX4-regulated pathway is as follows: ① Directly
  inhibit GPX4 by upregulating miR-324-3p or downregulating AR and KIF20A. ② Inhibit
  GSH biosynthesis by ent-kaurane diterpenoids. ③ Inhibit cystine uptake by erastin
  and sorafenib or upregulating miR-375 and ATF3. Regulation of the iron metabolism
  pathway is as follows: ④ Increase cellular LIP by DHA, downregulating DMT1 and LCN2.
  Regulation of the lipid metabolism pathway is as follows: ⑤ Target ACSL4 by downregulating
  ARF6. ⑥ Target LOX by downregulating miR-522. xCT: cystine/glutamate antiporter;
  ATF3: activating transcription factor 3; GSH: glutathione; GPX4: glutathione peroxidase
  4; AR: androgen receptor; LIP: labile iron pool; DHA: dihydroartemisinin; DMT1:
  divalent metal transporter 1; LCN2: lipocalin 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PLOH:
  phospholipid alcohols; PLOOH: phospholipid hydroperoxides; PUFA: polyunsaturated
  fatty acid; ARF6: ADP ribosylation factor 6; ACSL4: acyl-CoA synthetase long chain
  family member 4; CoA: coenzyme A; LPCAT: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase;
  PL: phospholipid; LOX: lipoxygenases; POR: cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase'
