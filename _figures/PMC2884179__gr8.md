caption: Proposed regulation of Nrf2 and NF-κB by protein modification or GSH depletion.
  (This scheme is based upon data derived in this study and other work ()). Protein
  covalent modification associated with exposure to chemically reactive metabolites
  activates Nrf2 inducing the transcription of cytoprotective proteins. However, protein
  covalent modification inhibits NF-κB, thereby reducing the transcription of anti-apoptotic
  and anti-oxidant proteins. This leads to cellular protection through the Nrf2 pathway,
  but if the protection is overwhelmed, cell death may ensue due to inhibition of
  NF-κB. GSH depletion without covalent modification will cause intracellular redox
  perturbation, activation of both Nrf2 and NF-κB, inducing the transcription of cytoprotective
  proteins, and anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant proteins, respectively. This may lead
  to cellular protection against the potentially damaging effects of redox perturbation.
