caption: 'Site of actions of targeted therapy used in the treatment of metastatic
  renal cell carcinoma.Notes: The tumor cell possesses inactive Von Hippel–Lindau
  (VHL), permitting the production of heterodimerized hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
  under normoxic conditions. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation further
  facilitates HIF production. HIF and S6 contribute to gene activation, leading to
  production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth
  factor (PDGF), both of which act upon the endothelial cell to promote angiogenesis.
  Bevacizumab targets only VEGF, whereas sunitinib and sorafenib target VEGF receptors
  as well as PDGF and c-kit. Temsirolimus and everolimus inhibit the mTOR signaling
  pathway. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in antitumor immunity, and mature DCs
  interact with both innate immune cells and antigen-specific T cells to elicit an
  immune response against tumor antigens. Tumor-derived factors such as VEGF, interleukin
  (IL)-6, and IL-8 may inhibit DC maturation, therefore escaping immune surveillance.
  Nontargeted therapies such as interferon (IFN)-α (by promoting maturation of DCs)
  and DC-based vaccination (by presenting tumor antigens to induce an antigen-specific
  cytotoxic T-cell response) are other effective treatment options for metastatic
  renal cell carcinoma.Abbreviations: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PI3-K,
  phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; X, site of
  action; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FKBP, FK-binding protein; IGF,
  insulin-like growth factor, PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor.'
