caption: IH-induced dysfunctions in adipose tissues, skeletal muscle cells, and hepatocytes.
  Adipose tissues, skeletal muscle, and the liver are the main endocrine organs producing
  adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines, respectively. IH stimuli induce the expression/secretion
  of cytokines, which induce and/or worsen insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,
  and T2DM in adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and hepatocytes. IH also inhibits
  glucose-induced insulin secretion via the downregulation of CD38 [] and vascular
  smooth muscle proliferation via IL-6-induced epiregulin expression [,]. IH promoted
  the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and caused inflammation and cell apoptosis
  in pancreatic tissue via the MAPK signaling pathway []. Black up and down arrows
  mean increment and decrease, respectively.
