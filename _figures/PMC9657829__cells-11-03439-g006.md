caption: 'A schematic representation of the DNA methylation alterations in the pathogenesis
  of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases, such as ASD, SZ, and TLE. (A)
  Advanced paternal age (APA), congenital epigenetic diseases, and de novo mutations
  in genes encoding DNA methylation machinery may increase the susceptibility of offspring
  to ASD. In addition, increased MECP2 interaction with RELN and GAD1 gene promoters
  triggers the reduction of Reelin and GAD67 expression in the brain regions of patients
  with ASD. (B) Environmental factors and certain genetic factors (e.g., rs3749034,
  an SZ-risk SNP) may cause aberrant methylation and associated silencing of genes,
  such as RELN and GAD1. In addition, the increased binding of MECP2 into the promoter
  of these genes can reduce the expression of Reelin and GAD67. Decreased GAD67 leads
  to reduced GABA release at synapses and compensatory regulation of postsynaptic
  GABAA receptors located in pyramidal neurons. (C) The alterations in the transmethylation
  pathway and adenosinergic signaling can lead to global hypermethylation of the genome
  in epileptogenic areas of the brain. Red colors highlighted hypermethylated genes.
