caption: 'Hypothetical alterations of the metabolic pathways for ATP production in
  low-oxygen stress response. In the diagram, the metabolic changes caused by oxygen
  deprivation were characterized by comparing changes in the expression of genes that
  are involved in the energy-metabolic pathways. The transcript expression of key
  genes was compared in the low-oxygen stress response of the four species. The genes
  upregulated or downregulated at least two-fold in each species were indicated in
  the pathway. Red arrows indicate reactions that are commonly promoted during low-oxygen
  stress, and green arrows indicate reactions inhibited by low-oxygen stress. Abbreviations
  are as follows: 2-OGDH, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; ACS, acetyl-CoA synthase;
  ACX, acyl-CoA oxidase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; FK, fructokinase;
  GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GOGAT, glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase; GS,
  glutamine synthase; Hb, hemoglobin; ICL, isocitrate lyase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; MFP, multifunctional protein
  (in β-oxidation); MS, malate synthase; NiR, nitrite reductase; NR, nitrate reductase;
  PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; SUCL, succinyl-CoA
  ligase; SUS, sucrose synthase.'
