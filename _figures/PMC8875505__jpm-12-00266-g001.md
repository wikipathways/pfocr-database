caption: Synapse of the serotonergic pathway in the context of Parkinson’s disease
  pathogenesis. Dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum
  are degenerated in the process of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. Hence, serotonergic
  neurons originating in raphe nuclei take over the conversion of levodopa to dopamine.
  Serotonin is produced in these neurons as well. Both neurotransmitters are packaged
  into vesicles and released into the synaptic cleft via endocytosis. Both serotonin
  and dopamine then act on the postsynaptic neurons in the striatum. Serotonin has
  an inhibitory effect while dopamine acts in an excitatory manner. Serotonin is re-uptaken
  into the pre-synaptic neuron via the serotonin transporter. Simultaneously, the
  release of serotonin is also slowed down via the pre-synaptic serotonin receptors.
  Serotonergic pre-synaptic neurons do not possess the autoregulatory machinery to
  fine-tune the dopamine release. This means that the inhibiting feedback loop is
  lacking and dopamine is released from serotonergic neurons in an uncontrolled and
  unregulated manner.
