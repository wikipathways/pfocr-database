caption: Cellular structure and behavior of tip cells and growth cones. A) Tip cells
  guide developing vascular cells, and are essential for the formation of blood vessels.
  a) Tip and stalk cells expressed different markers. Among others, VEGFR2, DLL4,
  and PDGF‐B can be found on tip cells, while Alk1/5, several SMADs, and BMP9/10 are
  associated to stalk cells. b) Molecular pathways at play in tip cell selection and
  maintenance of tip and stalk cell identity are known to involve hypoxia, and signaling
  molecules such as VE‐cadherins, VEGFR2, Notch, and BMPs. However, the complete pathway
  is still unclear. B) Growth cones guide developing axons. As opposed to tip cells
  which are separate from stalk cells, growth cones are an integral part of the developing
  neuron. c) Their structure consists of three parts. The P‐domain contains filopodia
  and lamellipodia, which respectively contribute to environment recognition and movement.
  The C‐domain contains organelles and a dense microtubule array. The T‐region is
  located between the previous two and contains myosin contractile structures, which
  regulate both actin and microtubules. Growth cones determine the direction in which
  neurons develop. They do so by sensing guidance molecules, which can either repel
  or attract them. Such cues are respectively known as d) chemorepulsive or e) chemoattractant.
  A few guidance molecules’ pathway of action has been elucidated, which involve CRMP2,
  ADF, and Cofilin, NCAM, RET, and GFRα1. Finally, some molecules are known to be
  involved in growth cone guidance, but their effect is still unclear. These include
  Netrins and BMP7.
