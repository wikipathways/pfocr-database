caption: Signaling cascades of TLR4 and TLR2 receptors. Bacteria express molecular
  structures on their cell surface that are specifically recognized by receptors of
  the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by
  the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induces the TLR4 signaling cascade.
  In contrast, the TLR2 signaling cascade is typically induced by Gram-positive bacteria
  through the recognition of cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA).
  In the case of Gram-negative stimulation of TLR4, signaling occurs via the adapter
  proteins MyD88 (MyD88-dependent cascade) and TRIF (MyD88-independent cascade). When
  Gram-positive bacteria stimulate TLR2, the Rac1-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is activated
  in addition to the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade. AP-1 = activating protein-1,
