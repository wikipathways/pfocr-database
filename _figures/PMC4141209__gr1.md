caption: (A) Pathways of l-proline biosynthesis. (B) Proposed hydrolytic (Scheme I)
  and non-hydrolytic schemes (Scheme II) for the conversion of l-ornithine to l-proline
  by OCD . Step 6 corresponds to the reaction by Pyr2C reductase. Asterisks indicate
  putative intermediates. (C) T3LHyp pathway and the metabolic network with d-proline.
  (D) Schematic gene clusters related to T3LHyp and/or proline metabolism of archaea
  (A) and bacteria (B). Putative genes in the box were purified and characterized
  in this study (see (E)). TlLhpI gene was fused with OCC_00362 and OCC_00367 genes
  (Supplementary Methods). C–C and C–T indicate a pair of catalytic amino acid residues
  of proline racemase superfamily enzymes (see ). Gray putative genes are sequentially
  similar to other (amino acid) transporters. (E) Purification of recombinant His6
  tag proteins. Five micrograms each of purified protein were applied to 12% (w/v)
  gel (also (F)). (F) Purification of recombinant His6 tag TlLhpI mutants.
papertitle: Ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin homolog from the hyperthermophilic
  archaeon Thermococcus litoralis functions as a novel Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate
  reductase involved in putative trans-3-hydroxy-l-proline metabolism.
