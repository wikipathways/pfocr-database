caption: Model for two-component system signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis.
  Signal perception induces autophosphorylation of the conserved histidine residue
  (H) in the histidine kinase (HK) domain of AHKs localized in the PM or ER. Then
  the phosphoryl group (P) is subsequently transferred to a conserved aspartate residue
  (D) of the C-terminal receiver domain. AHP proteins accept the signal from AHKs,
  and transfer the phosphoryl group to the ARR-A or ARR-B. AHP6 lacks the conserved
  histidine residue and negatively regulate phosphate transfer process. ARR-B are
  transcription factors which could positively regulate downstream targets while ARR-A
  negatively regulate ARR-B expressions. As a parallel branch, AHP proteins may also
  transfer the phosphoryl group to another transcription factors, cytokinin response
  factors (CRFs). Upon phosphorylation, CRFs shuttle from cytosol to the nucleus and
  regulate downstream targets. CRFs and Type-B ARRs share some common targets while
  also having their own specific targets. Cytokinin and ethylene are indicated by
  red dot and yellow diamond, respectively. PUPs (purine permeases) and ENTs (equilibrative
  nucleotide transporters) are cytokinin transporters. Figure indicates a whole cell.
