caption: 'Movement mechanism of the pulvinus motor organ—a model. This model mainly
  represents the movement mechanism of the pulvinus when the leaf is closed, but does
  not represent the movement mechanism when the leaf is open. Left: schematic diagram
  of extensor cells swelling during pulvinus movement. Right: schematic diagram of
  flexor cell shrinking during pulvinus movement. Below is the key for symbols and
  abbreviations. Prior to osmotic transport, a blue-light receiver, Phot, senses changes
  in light, which generates activation of TRP, TAA1, IPA, and YUS auxin synthesis
  pathway elements. Differential gradient auxin transport in flexor and extensor sides
  serves as an early signal of cell volume change. Outward/inward-rectifier K+ channels
  are activated by blue-light receptors, which regulate the distribution of K+ in
  tissues. Aquaporins of the plasma-membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) family increase
  the permeability of biological membranes to water and facilitate the transverse
  and longitudinal transport of water on the extensor and flexor tissue sides. The
  actin cytoskeleton consists of two forms of actin: globular actin (G-actin) and
  filamentous actin (F-actin), where F-actin transitions from a loose state to a reorganized
  ordered phosphorylation state that regulates calcium ion levels in the vacuole or
  cytoplasm. Calcium ion levels are also regulated by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5) diphosphate. In the pulvinus, H+-ATPase activity exists with a difference,
  whereas the activity of the extensor side was higher than that of the flexor side.
  The dynamic transport of cation (H+) and anion (Cl−) regulates the charge balance,
  and the differential transport forms an electrochemical potential gradient to provide
  energy. The differential transport regulation of hormones, ions, and water results
  in higher turgor pressure in the extensor than the flexor, forming a certain pressure
  difference and providing a driving force for the movement of the pulvinus. Notes:
  Cellular water content as well as cytoplasmic pH are very stable. Cells with protein
  storage vacuoles and cells with solubilizing vacuoles have very similar water contents
  and cytoplasmic volumes, but vacuole volume is different'
