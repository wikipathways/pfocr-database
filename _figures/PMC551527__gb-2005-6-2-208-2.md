caption: 'Pathways in the aerobic methanotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus
  involved in the metabolism of single-carbon compounds, as determined by genome sequencing
  and proteome analysis. Formaldehyde produced from methane can be metabolized in
  the following alternative ways: (a) through the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle,
  which can either generate biomass (via the assimilatory (A) RuMP cycle) or CO2 (via
  the dissimilatory (D) RuMP cycle); (b) by conversion to formate via intermediates
  containing tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT); (c) via methylene-tetrahydrofolate (methylene-H4F)
  to the serine cycle and from there into biomass. Under certain conditions, there
  can be an excess of formaldehyde and formate; the former can be used up through
  pathway (c) and the latter by reduction to methylene-H4F (d) and thus directed into
  the serine cycle. CO2 produced in any of these reactions can be converted to biomass
  by either (e) the serine cycle or (f) the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle.'
