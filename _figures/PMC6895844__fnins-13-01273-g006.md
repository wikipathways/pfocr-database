caption: Network and pathway analysis of shared networks between AD and T2D. Integrative
  meta-analysis was performed on datasets from AD and T2D subjects to identify shared
  dysregulated genes between both diseases. Entrez gene identifiers from the genes
  identified in the meta-analyses were imported into NetworkAnalyst for network and
  pathway analyses. In NetworkAnalyst, we selected tissue-specific networks derived
  from the protein–protein interaction database from human whole blood. The minimum
  connected network was selected for further pathway analysis. Results from the pathway
  analysis are derived from the KEGG and Reactome. Shared networks between AD and
  T2D were enriched predominantly in genes associated to infectious diseases and inflammation
  (blue circles) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT)
  signaling pathway (pink circles).
