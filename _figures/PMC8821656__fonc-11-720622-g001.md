caption: MicroRNA biogenesis through a canonical and non-canonical pathway. In the
  canonical pathway the pri-miRNA is processed by DROSHA and DGCR8 to form pre-miRNA
  which then is exported to the cytoplasm via exportin-5, wherein the cytoplasm this
  pre-miRNA is processed by DICER-1 which gives rise to miRNA duplex. This miRNA duplex
  is then incorporated into RISC together with an argonaute protein to form mature
  miRNA. This mature miRNA then binds with an mRNA in the processing body where mRNA
  decay happens. On the contrary, in the non-canonical pathway, the pre-miRNA is generated
  from mitrons by DBR1. This pre-miRNA is transported by exportin-5 and enters the
  canonical pathway. DROSHA, Class 2 ribonucleaseIIIenzyme; DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome
