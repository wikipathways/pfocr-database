caption: A Sex steroids decrease the expression of Dll in cortical thymic epithelial
  cells (cTEC), which results increase thymopoiesis. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases
  the expression of AIRE in medullary thymic epithelial cells and assists in negative
  selection of T cells, on the other hand estrogens exhibit opposite effect by decreasing
  AIRE transcription. CD11c+ cortical dendritic cells play a crucial role in clonal
  deletion of activated caspase. B In presence of steroids DCs fail to prime T helper
  cells toward Th1. C CD28 signaling protects single positive T cells from glucocorticoid-induced
  apoptosis. This event exclusively occurs in later stage of thymocyte maturation.
  B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are the ligands of CD28 are expressed in the corticomedullary
  region and medullary region of thymus where only single positive T cells are observed.
  CD28 signaling is crucial to maintain sustained expression of antiapoptotic molecule
  Bcl-XL and downregulate the expression of pro-apoptotic molecule Bak via calmodulin
  and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway D Glucocorticoid-bound
  glucocorticoids receptor (GC/GR) induces glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ),
  which in turn induce FoxP3 expression, and thereby promoted peripheral Treg (pTreg)
  differentiation. (Figure created with BioRender.com).
