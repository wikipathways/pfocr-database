caption: Disrupted protein clearance systems (autophagy-lysosome pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway) in PD motor neurons and GCase dysfunction. (a) Macroautophagy. (b) Chaperone
  mediated autophagy (CMA) is a more selective process and targets KFERQ amino-acid-motif
  containing proteins such as αSyn. (c) Microautophagy or pinocytosis of intracellular
  contents. (d) Defective ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) failure in eliminating
  misfolded proteins tagged with ubiquitin such as GCase precede aggresome formation
  and neurodegeneration. Defects in GCase turnover [] lead to glucosylceramide (GlcCer)
  accumulation, which later contributes to αSyn aggregation and impaired autophagy
  []. Altogether, impaired protein-clearance systems cause neurodegeneration in PD

  dysfunction and its consequences are indicated by red-color arrows. Dashed arrows
  represent a series of reactions, and dashed arrows with the question mark in the
  middle indicate unknown mechanisms.
