caption: Detection of differentially expressed K+-responsive protein species involved
  in the JA biosynthetic pathway. It is postulated that free α-linolenic acid forms
  13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid by the action of lipoxygenase (LOX). The
  resulting hydroperoxide, 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT) is converted
  into an unstable allene oxide, 12,13(S)-epoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)- octadecatrienoic acid
  (12,13-EOT), by allene oxide synthase (AOS). Allene oxide cyclase (AOC) catalyzes
  the cyclization of 12,13-EOT to yield 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA). OPDA is transported
  from the plastid into the peroxisome, where it is reduced by the action of OPDA
  reductase 3 (OPR3) and after three cycles of β-oxidation involved in acyl-CoA oxidase
  (ACX), afford (+)-iso-JA, which is subsequently isomerized to (-)-JA, a multifunctional
  protein (MFP) possessing 2-transenoyl-CoA hydratase and l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  activities, and (-)-JA then acts to modulate gene expression or can be further catabolized
  (, ). Altered abundance of the JA synthesis-related enzymes identified in this study
  is indicated using bar diagrams.
