caption: Inhibition of proteasome inhibitor (PI) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway results
  in synergistic cellular death. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a central signaling
  hub in eukaryotic cells and it is connected to the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)
  by balancing amino acid homeostasis (amino acid pool). Intensive feedback loops
  between mTORC1, mTORC2, and AKT pose a challenge to the successful inhibition of
  this pathway. Rapalogs target the mTORC1 complex; the mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitor
  pp242 (torkinib) is more effective in combination with PI. The PI3K inhibitors copanlisib
  and TGR-1202 demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity with PI. Several AKT inhibitors
  (perifosine, TAS-117, nelfinavir, montelukast) were found to synergize with (PI)
  by affecting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ERK, or c-Myc.
