caption: In addition to Ca2+− dependent activation of MLCK (not shown here), vasoconstrictors
  such as All, PE, and ET-1 stimulate G-protein signaling in SMC via GPCRs. G-proteins
  influence the activity of RhoA by activating GEFs, which facilitate the dissociation
  of GDP from RhoA, allowing GTP to bind. This activation is balanced by GAPs, which
  increase the efficiency of GTP hydrolysis. When RhoA is in its active, GTP-bound
  form, it’s able to interact with any of it’s downstream effectors, such as ROCK
  and mDia. ROCK inhibits MLCP, allowing for prolonged phosphorylation of MLC and
  enhanced SMC contraction, increased vascular resistance, and increased blood pressure.
  Simultaneously, mDia and ROCK promote the polymerization of F-actin from G-actin,
  releasing G-actin bound MRTF. Free MRTF translocates to the nucleus where it induces
  SRF-dependent transcription of contractile genes. These concurrency of these latter
  events further enhance SMC contraction and vascular resistance.
