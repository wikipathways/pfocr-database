caption: In fibroblasts, TGF-ß binding to its receptors causes Smad2/3 activation,
  recruitment of transcriptional coactivator p300 and enhanced collagen gene transcription.
  However, TGF-ß also activates a non-Smad pathway via c-Abl, which stimulates Egr-1.
  Egr-1 in turn induces p300 which catalyzes histone acetylation and chromatin unwinding,
  facilitating collagen transcription.
