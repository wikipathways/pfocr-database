caption: Reduced TCF1 expression promoting a differentiation bias of activated aged
  T cells toward terminal effector cells. After priming, increased IL-2/STAT5 signaling
  and sustained activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway favors differentiation of aged
  T cells into TCF1low terminal effector cells, due to reduced FOXO1/TCF1 expression
  and increased BLIMP1 expression.
