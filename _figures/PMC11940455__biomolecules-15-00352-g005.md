caption: Signaling pathway activated by EGFR and TRKB receptors resulting in cell
  proliferation. (A) TK receptors are activated by endogenous binding, initiating
  a cascade downstream of cell proliferation. After binding to the growth factor,
  TK receptors are phosphorylated and activate KRAS, which can activate HIF-1A via
  the MAPK or PI3K pathways. HIF-1A induces gene transcription leading to cell proliferation,
  cell survival, drug resistance, and angiogenesis. Adapted by Amatu et al., 2016
  [25,43]. (B) EGFR and TRKB crosstalk; cetuximab drug binding and EGFR receptor inhibition,
  blocking EGFR-dependent downstream cascade. TRKB activation, initiating cell proliferation
  processes, even when cetuximab treatment inhibits EGFR. Adapted by Gotz and Sentner,
  2014 [23]. (C) Process of cell proliferation and targeting of drugs that act on
  cellular microtubules, blocking the cellular division process in the G2–M phase
  in the anaphase stage, causing cell death. Adapted by Souza, MVN 2004 [41]. (D)
  Polymerization and depolymerization process of alpha and beta tubulin heterodimers,
  forming cell microtubules, which are crucial for cell division; paclitaxel binding
  in alpha–beta tubulin heterodimers, leading to microtubule stabilization and causing
  cell death. Adapted by Souza, MVN 2004 [41] and Sueth-Santiago, V et al., 2017 [44]
