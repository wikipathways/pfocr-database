caption: Notch signaling regulates hepatic glucose production through synergy with
  FoxO1, which directly activates the transcription of G6pc and Pck1, the rate-limiting
  enzymes in hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Transcriptionally
  active FoxO1 is phosphorylated by AKT and excluded from nucleus. In addition, Notch
  signaling promotes hepatic lipogenesis through an unknown factor that stabilizes
  mTORC1, which is normally activated by amino acids, as well as the insulin-PI3K-AKT
  pathway. mTORC1 in turn activates Srebp1c, a key factor that turns on transcription
  of Fasn, which encodes a rate limiting enzyme in lipogenesis. In obesity, high levels
  of glucose and free fatty acids (FFA) activate the AMPK-mTOC1-STAT3 pathway, which
  eventually upregulates Jag1 and activates Notch signaling in the neighbor hepatocyte.
  Dotted line indicates indirect effect. G6pc, glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit;
  Pck1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTORC1,
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; Srebp1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c; FoxO1,
  forkhead box protein O1; TG, triglyceride; Fasn, fatty acid synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase.
