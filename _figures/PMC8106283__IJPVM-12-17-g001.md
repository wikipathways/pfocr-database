caption: 'Possible inhibitory activity of cannabinoid derivatives such as cannabidiol
  (CBD) and delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (9 THC) against methylphenidate—oxidative
  stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Methylphenidate
  has been suggested to induce oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction through activation of Keap1 or direct inhibition of the Nrf2/ARE pathway.
  Cannabinoid derivative by direct activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways or by
  inhibition of their repressor, Keap1, can control the sequel of methylphenidate
  abuse, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegeneration, and can cause
  neuroprotection against methylphenidate-induced neurodegeneration. MPH: Methylphenidate,
