caption: ncRNAs inhibit PCa growth through the PAM signaling pathway. This figure
  illustrates that ncRNAs associated with the PAM signaling pathway inhibit PCa growth
  by regulating apoptosis and cell cycle. Blue represents the role of suppressing
  the PAM signaling pathway. Red represents roles that facilitate the PAM signaling
  pathway. purple color represents an association with apoptosis and light red color
  represents an association with the cell cycle
