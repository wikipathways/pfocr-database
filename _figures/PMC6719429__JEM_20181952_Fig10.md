caption: 'Schema of neutrophil differentiation in cancer. In the steady state, neutrophil
  differentiation is the end point of the MPP–CMP–GMP–GP pathway. This pathway is
  negatively regulated by the IRF8 transcription factor. In steady state, the MLPG
  contribution to the neutrophil and monocyte pool is minimal. In cancer, down-regulation
  of IRF8 and Rb1 leads to expansion of both PMN-MDSC progenitors: GPs and their monocytic
  counterparts MLPGs. MLPGs, in some models, may contribute to 50% of the PMN-MDSC
  pool. CMLP, common myelolymphoid progenitor; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; Mon,
  monocyte; MPP, multipotent progenitor.'
