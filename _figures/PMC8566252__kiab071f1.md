caption: Interacting regulatory pathways for axillary meristem initiation at the boundary
  between shoot and leaf primordium. The photograph shows a longitudinal section of
  a petunia SAM and leaf primordium (scale bar is 50 µm). The inserted box denotes
  the region where the axillary meristem initiates. The expanded box shows the proposed
  regulatory networks. STM, a meristematic marker, promotes axillary meristem initiation
  through CK and the WUS-CLVs pathway. STM is regulated by both LAS/MOC1 through the
  REV-DRN/DRNL pathway and RAXs through CUCs and/or the DA1 pathway. These two pathways
  are interconnected by CUCs. LAS is degraded by the APC/C complex that involves GA
  signaling, while RAX1 is able to interact with a number of TFs such as EXB, LFY,
  and LOF. The arrows and blunt lines represent positive and negative regulation,
  respectively.
