caption: Pathways from insect bites to Endemic Pemphigus Foliaceus (EPF). (A) During
  chronic exposure to sand fly L. longipalpis bites, insect salivary proteins including
  LJM17 and LJM11 are injected into the upper dermis of human skin and elicit a host
  anti-saliva immune response. Some of the non-pathogenic anti-LJM17 and anti-LJM11
  antibodies (Abs) cross-react with human Dsg1 through molecular mimicry. Subsequent
  intramolecular epitope spreading (ES) and isotype switch, the humoral IgG response
  will go from non-pathogenic cross-reactive epitopes to pathogenic epitopes of Dsg1
  resulting in the production of pathogenic IgG4 autoantibodies (Abs). (B) Following
  exposure to sand fly P. papatasi bites, insect salivary proteins including PpSP32
  are injected into the upper dermis. PpSP32 protein would interact with Dsg1 and
  Dsg3 to form immunogenic molecular complexes which elicit an Abs response through
  the mechanism of intermolecular ES (from the PpSP32 antigen to Dsg1 or Dsg3). These
  Abs would in time lead to the Tunisian EPF. Experimental data, to date, shows that
  the cross-reactive Abs against Dsg1 induced by LJM17 and LJM11 from L. longipalpis
  and the Abs against Dsg1 and Dsg3 following immunization with PpSP32 antigen from
  P. papatasi are not pathogenic.
