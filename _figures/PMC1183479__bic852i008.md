caption: Insulin activates protein synthesis by the PI3K pathway, which involves the
  activation of PKB/Akt. However, the effects of PE are mediated through the classical
  MAPK pathway and results presented in this study indicate that ERK1/2 activity is
  required to activate protein synthesis and mTOR signalling. It is probable that
  a kinase downstream of ERK, such as p90RSK, phosphorylates TSC2, alleviating its
  inhibition of Rheb. This results in the activation of the mTOR pathway and S6 kinases
  and the inhibition of 4E-BP1 activity; both of these events activate protein synthesis.
  The Mnks also contribute to the activation of protein synthesis by PE, probably
  through the phosphorylation of eIF4E and perhaps of other substrates.
