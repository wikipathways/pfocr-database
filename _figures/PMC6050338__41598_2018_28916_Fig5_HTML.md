caption: Lipid IVA biosynthesis, an attractive metabolic pathway for drug targeting.
  Structures correspond to candidate target proteins, LpxA, LpxC and LpxD. Representation
  of the most druggable pockets is shown in yellow within the structures. Green nodes
  indicate proteins that were top-ranked in our analyses. Conservation (in percent)
  of each protein in 38 pathogenic Kp genomes is also shown.
