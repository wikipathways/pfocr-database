caption: Scheme of cross-talk interactions between liver IR and TIM-1 signaling. Both
  Th1 and Th2 cells express TIM-1, whereas macrophages express TIM-4, the TIM-1 ligand.
  Liver IR damage leads to the activation of Th1, Th2 and macrophages. TIM-1 on Th2
  cells cross-links TIM-4 to directly activate macrophages (“direct pathway”). On
  the other hand, TIM-1 on activated Th1 cells triggers IFN-γ production that also
  activates macrophages (“indirect pathway”). As a result, activated macrophages produce
  cytokine/chemokine programs that ultimately facilitate liver damage.
