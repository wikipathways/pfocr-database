caption: The Ll.LtrB intron, found in a relaxase gene (ltrB) in an L. lactis conjugative
  element, encodes a multi-functional RT (LtrA protein) with RT, RNA splicing, DNA-binding,
  and DNA endonuclease activities. Transcription of the ltrB gene yields a precursor
  RNA containing the intron flanked by 5′ and 3′ exons (E1 and E2, respectively).
  LtrA is translated from within the intron using its own Shine-Dalgarno sequence
  and then binds to the intron in the precursor RNA to promote formation of the catalytically
  active RNA structure for RNA splicing. RNA splicing occurs via two sequential RNA-catalyzed
  transesterification reactions that are initiated by nucleophilic attack of the 2′
  OH of a branch point A-residue near the 3′ end of the intron at the 5′-splice site
  and results in ligated ltrB exons and an excised intron lariat RNA with a 2′-5′
  phosphodiester linkage. After splicing, LtrA remains tightly bound to the excised
  intron lariat RNA in an RNP. RNPs initiate retrohoming by recognizing a DNA target
  site (the ligated ltrB E1–E2 sequence), using both the IEP and base pairing of the
  intron RNA. The intron RNA then inserts via reversal of the two transesterification
  reactions used for RNA splicing (referred to as “full reverse splicing”) into the
  intron-insertion site (IS) at the ligated-exon junction in the top strand of the
  DNA target site. LtrA uses its DNA endonuclease activity to cleave the bottom strand
  at a site (CS) between positions +9 and +10 of E2 and uses the 3′ DNA end at the
  cleavage site as a primer for reverse transcription of the inserted intron RNA.
  The resulting intron cDNA is then integrated into the genome by host enzymes in
  late steps that minimally include degradation of the intron RNA template strand,
  second (top)-strand DNA synthesis, resection of DNA overhangs, and sealing of DNA
  strand nicks .
