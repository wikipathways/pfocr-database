caption: 'Activation mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Initiation signal (Signal
  1): NLRP3 recognizes DAMPs and PAMPs, activating the NF-κB signaling pathway through
  mediating cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α. In turn, it promotes the activation
  of NLRP3, Pro-IL-18, and Pro-IL-1β, resulting in the expression of precursor proteins.
  Activation signal (Signal 2): The NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered through multiple
  pathways, including the ion activation pathway, mitochondrial damage with reactive
  oxygen species generation, and lysosome rupture. The NLRP3 inflammasome consists
  of three main components: the NLRP3 protein, ASC, and the effector molecule caspase-1.
  Upon activation, caspase-1 cleaves the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18, converting
  them into their active forms. Subsequently, IL-18 initiates subsequent signaling
  pathways, participating in various inflammatory reactions and exerting biological
  effects. Furthermore, NLRP3 can also stimulate caspase-1 to cleave GSDMD, forming
  N-GSDMD and triggering pyroptosis.'
