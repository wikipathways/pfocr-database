caption: The impact of the deregulated MTHFR on amino acids, SAM, and GSH. A, relative
  intracellular levels of different intermediates in the methionine cycle and transsulfuration
  pathway positioned in the context of the sulfur amino acid pathway, from the S.
  cerevisiae (ABC2613) transformants with MET13_WT or MET13_R357A that were grown
  overnight in minimal medium with amino acid supplements and GSH. These were then
  reinoculated at 0.15 A600 in fresh SD medium without any sulfur source. Methionine
  was added to the transformants after 3 h of secondary inoculation, and the samples
  were collected for metabolite extraction at 0.5 and 1.0 OD. The graph here corresponds
  to the representative data set plotted using the average of four biological replicates
  along with ± S.D. values. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 4). *, p < 0.05; **, p <
  0.01; ***, p < 0.001. B, relative intracellular levels of the amino acid pools estimated
  from yeast transformants of MET13_WT or MET13_R357A in met13Δmet15Δ (ABC2613) that
  were grown overnight in minimal medium with amino acid supplements and GSH. These
  were then reinoculated at 0.15 A600 in fresh SD medium without any sulfur source.
  Methionine was added to the transformants after 3 h of secondary inoculation, and
  samples were collected in triplicate at 0.5 or 1.0 OD. The graph here corresponds
  to the representative data set of 1.0 OD cells plotted using the average of three
  biological replicates along with ± S.D. values. Error bars indicate S.D. (n = 3).
  *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; NS, not significant.
