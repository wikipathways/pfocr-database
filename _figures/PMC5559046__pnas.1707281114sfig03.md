caption: Hormonal pathways involved in the regulation of growth and development in
  D. melanogaster (solid lines) and some alterations linked to larval diapause in
  C. costata (dashed lines). The graph in lower right corner represents growth (solid
  green line) and the developmental hormone fluxes (JH, juvenile hormone, solid blue
  line; and 20E, solid red line) in the hemolymph of D. melanogaster (according to
  refs.  and ). Larval molts are driven by pulses of circulating 20E, whereas larval
  (juvenile) character is maintained by high titer of JH. During the early third larval
  instar (L3) of D. melanogaster ontogeny, metamorphosis to the pupal stage is triggered
  by the suppression of JH production linked to the attainment of critical mass and,
  concomitantly, by a first small pulse of 20E (peak 1), which likely stimulates rapid
  cell proliferation in imaginal discs (, ). This early 20E peak 1 is suppressed in
  C. costata under short days; this suppression might be considered an event linked
  to the onset of larval diapause (). Direct development to pupa then is driven, likely
  similarly in both fly species, by a succession of three 20E pulses linked to wandering
  (peak 2), pupariation (peak 3), and pupation (peak 4). High titer of 20E during
  peak 3 suppresses proliferation in imaginal discs and also causes cessation of feeding
  and growth in peripheral tissues (). All 20E peaks (1–4) are probably absent in
  diapause-inducing/initiating larvae of C. costata reared under short days (dashed
  red line) (). Although their development is arrested, diapause-initiating C. costata
  larvae continue to grow until the age of ∼6 wk when the final size of the diapausing
  larva is attained (dashed green line) (). Fly larvae produce 20E in their prothoracic
  glands (PG) under the control of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) secreted by neurosecretory
  cells of the brain (, ). JH is produced in the corpus allatum gland (CA) (), and
  adipokinetic hormone (AKH), which stimulates fat body metabolic activity, is secreted
  from the corpora cardiaca (CC) (). The three glands (PG, CA, and CC) are integrated
  into a single ring gland in fly larvae (). ILPs are produced in a set of neurosecretory
  cells (NSC) of the larval brain (). The ILPs activate proliferation and growth in
  peripheral tissues (such as the fat body) and imaginal discs (such as the wing disc)
  (, , , ) via pathways described in more detail in . In addition, insulin signaling
  positively influences 20E synthesis in the PG (, ), and a specific insulin-like
  peptide (ILP8) is secreted from small imaginal discs that have not yet completed
  their growth program. ILP8 inhibits ecdysone production and pupariation, thereby
  coupling tissue growth with developmental timing (–). The growing fat body produces
  poorly characterized feedback signals (FDS), which act on brain NSC to control the
  secretion of ILPs (). The fat body also produces imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs),
  which cooperate with insulin to stimulate cell proliferation in imaginal discs ().
  Wing discs of diapause-inducing/initiating third instars of C. costata do not receive
  stimulatory 20E signal (see above). It remains unclear whether and how the other
  stimulatory axes (IS and IDGF) are changed in diapausing larvae; nevertheless, the
  cell-division cycle in imaginal discs is inhibited (and/or is not stimulated), and
  consequently the discs stop growing (). This cessation of growth is synonymous with
  the developmental arrest, i.e., diapause (dashed black line). It is known that the
  IS and 20HE pathways interact functionally, although the mechanistic details of
  this crosstalk are not sufficiently understood (). For instance, the synthesis of
  ecdysone in the fruit fly's PG is positively regulated by insulin (, ), which in
  turn may couple the availability of nutrients (TOR pathway) to developmental timing
  regulated by ecdysone (). Similarly, insulin receptors are present in the fruit
  fly's CA glands, which regulate JH synthesis (); moreover suppression of insulin
  signaling correlates with low JH production (). In summary, the growth of D. melanogaster
  and probably also C. costata larvae is supported by crosstalk between developmental
  hormones and active IS and TOR pathways that together promote the growth of tissues
  and the proliferation in the imaginal discs until the final appropriate size is
  reached and the program of metamorphosis is initiated ().
