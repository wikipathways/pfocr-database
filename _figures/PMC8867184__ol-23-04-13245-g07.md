caption: Potential molecular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of garlic. (A) DADS,
  DATS, SAMC and allicin can all promote the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
  thereby activating the caspase family proteins, such as caspase 3 and caspase 9,
  and inducing apoptosis; DADS, DATS and SAMC can activate the p53 pathway, resulting
  in decreased expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax. SAMC and DATS
  significantly activated the three pathways of MAPKs, including ERK, JNK and p38.
  In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a key role in the occurrence and development
  of tumors, DATS can significantly upregulate the level of GSK3β, thereby increasing
  the digestion of β-catenin, indicating that DATS can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  DATS can also increase ROS production and activate the AMPK pathway. Allicin can
  reduce phosphorylated STAT3, thereby inhibiting the STAT3 pathway, and allicin can
  also activates Nrf2 and induces its translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, DADS
  can inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9. (B) DADS and DATS can activate the P53/P21 pathway,
  and DADS can also inhibit the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25c proteins,
  leading to G2/M phase arrest of tumor cells. SAMC and DADS can affect the polymerization
  of tubulin and thus affect the function of the spindle, leading to mitotic arrest.
  Finally, allicin induces cell cycle arrest in the S phase. DADS, diallyl disulfide;
  DATS, diallyl trisulfide; SAMC, S-allylmercaptocysteine; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 β; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
