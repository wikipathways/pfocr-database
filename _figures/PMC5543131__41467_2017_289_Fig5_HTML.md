    a Across the genomic subtypes, heat map represents differential aggregate expression

    Pathway diagram represents core metabolic pathways, with differential expression

    with tumors in groups RCC.c6 (c6 of KIRC or KICH type), c1, or TGCT.c4, respectively
    (red, significantly higher in c5/c8/TGCT.c9). b Across the genomic subtypes, heat
    map represents differential aggregate expression of mRNAs associated with hypoxia,
    EMT, MAPK, NRF2-ARE, and cyclin D1 pathways, along with a proteomic MAPK signature
