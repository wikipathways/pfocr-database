caption: Summary of the function of NOD2 in response to MDP in macrophages. In the
  absence of a ligand, NOD2 is in an inactive autoinhibited form by folding the LRR
  domain onto NBD and CARD domains stabilized by chaperone proteins such as HSP70.
  Upon ligand binding and receptor activation, the C-terminal LRR domain of NOD2 undergoes
  a conformational change and exposes the CARD domain to interaction and oligomerization
  with the CARD domain in the adaptor molecule RIP2 through a homophilic CARD–CARD
  interaction. Upon oligomerization, PIR2 activates and promotes the ubiquitination
  of lysine 209 located at the kinase domain. (1) This ubiquitination promotes the
  recruitment of TAK1 and NEMO (the NF-kB essential modulators). The activation of
  TAK1 and NEMO promotes the phosphorylation of IKKβ, which is a key kinase in the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. Phosphorylated IKKβ degrades IκB and subsequently activates
  NF-κB family transcription factors. (2) In addition, this path also activates the
  MAPKs and AP1 pathways. The NF-κB and MAPK pathways are responsible for triggering
  the expression of inflammatory cytokines. (3) Activated NOD2 also may trigger an
  autophagic pathway by recruiting ATG16L1. (4) The interaction of NOD2/TRAF3 with
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) upon sensing viral ssRNA induces
  the activation of IRF3, triggering the expression of IFN-β gene.
