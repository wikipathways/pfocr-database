caption: Phenotype switching in melanoma. Upon activation of the signaling pathways
  MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and TGFβ, a changed expression of specific markers leads to ECM
  degradation and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which facilitates invasion and
  metastasis. Using single-cell approaches, it has become evident that phenotype switching
  is not binary but rather a multistep process in which cells transit through a series
  of intermediate cell states expressing combinations of epithelial and mesenchymal
  phenotypes. These intermediate states can simultaneously display proliferation,
  invasion, and stemness features. Transcriptional regulators are highlighted in italics.
  The red indicates the switch between E- and N-cadherin and the responsible genes
  CDH1 and CDH2. Melanocytic markers are highlighted in orange, and other markers
  are in blue. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 19 September 2023).
