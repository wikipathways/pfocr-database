caption: BALB/c mice were injected i.v. with 5x105 PFU of WT MCMV (MW97.01) and liver
  tissue was harvested on day 5 p.i. (A) Consecutive serial 1-μm sections of liver
  tissue focusing on an infected hepatocyte (Hc) that is delimited from uninfected
  tissue by a sheath made up by a mononuclear cell infiltrate. The expression of the
  indicated marker molecules was tested in a two-color IHC (2C-IHC) staining. (a-d)
  Identification of the infected Hc by red staining of the intranuclear viral IE1
  protein. (a) Focus-forming mononuclear cells are not CD31+ black-stained endothelial
  cells (EC). (b) Focus-forming mononuclear cells are not CD3ε+ black-stained cells,
  thus excluding α/ß and γ/δ T cells as well as NKT cells. (c) Identification of focus-forming
  mononuclear cells as black-stained F4/80+ macrophages (Mø). (d) IL33-expressing
  cells stained in turquoise-green color colocalize with focus-forming F4/80 macrophages
  in the neighboring section of image c. Counterstaining with hematoxylin. Arrows
  point to the indicated cell types exemplarily. The bar markers represent 50 μm throughout.
  (B) 2C-IHC verifying colocalization of F4/80 and IL33 on the cellular level. (a)
  Higher resolution image of an advanced, aged focus consisting of a cluster of dual-stained
  F4/80+ (red) IL33+ (turquoise-green) macrophages (Mø) surrounding an infected hepatocyte
  (Hc) that is identified by an intranuclear inclusion body. Note that dually-expressing
  macrophages localize also to liver tissue outside of a focus. (b) A young focus
  in which dual-stained F4/80+ (red) IL33+ (turquoise-green) macrophages cling to
  an infected hepatocyte (Hc) that shows the pathocytomorphology of an owl’s eye cell
  with an intranuclear inclusion body that indicates the late phase (L phase) in the
  viral gene expression program. Counterstaining with hematoxylin. Arrows point to
  sites of interest. The bar markers represent 50 μm.
