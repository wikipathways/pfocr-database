caption: Explain the correlation among the chemical components, candidate targets,
  involved pathways and corresponding pharmacological effects of AGNHW. The red node
  represents the AGNHW prescription; the pink target represents the Traditional Chinese
  Medicine contained in the AGNHW prescription; the green node represents the chemical
  components contained in AGNHW; the blue node refers to the candidate target of AGNHW;
  the yellow node refers to the known ALI-related genes; the purple node refers to
  the regulatory pathway of the candidate target of AGNHW; and the orange node refers
  to the corresponding pharmacological action of the main pathway of AGNHW in the
  treatment of ALI.
