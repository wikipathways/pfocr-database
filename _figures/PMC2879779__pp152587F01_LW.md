caption: Phytosterol biosynthetic pathway. Key intermediates are shown. C-24, the
  site of SMT methyl additions, is indicated. Multiple steps are designated with dashed
  lines. Mutants are shown in italics with corresponding enzymes in uppercase letters.
  dwf1/dim has homology to FAD-linked oxidase and is predicted to have C-24 reductase
  activity.
