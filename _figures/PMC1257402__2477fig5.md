caption: Roles of accessory functions in retrohoming. Facilitatory (+, teal) and inhibitory
  (-, red) functions are superimposed on a retrohoming pathway that is expanded from
  that in . The order of steps 5 and 6 is arbitrary. Accessory functions are labeled
  in black on a teal or red background, with implicated E. coli enzymes in white.
  Their putative sites of action are indicated by dotted lines, as described in the
  text. Three possible sites of DNA synthesis by the repair polymerases are encircled
  and enlarged on the left (a-c).
