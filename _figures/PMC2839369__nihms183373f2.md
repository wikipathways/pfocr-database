caption: Nucleoside salvage pathway for the production of 2′-deoxynucleoside triphosphates.
  Scavenged 2′-deoxynucleosides are imported by designated membrane transporter proteins
  and serve as substrate for dNK. Alternatively, cleavage of the nucleobase by phosphorylase
  feds into other pyrimidine and purine metabolism pathways. Separately, thymidylate
  synthase and ribonucleotide reductase catalyze the final reactions of the nucleotide
  de novo pathways, producing TMP and dNDPs which are converted to their triphosphates
  by dNMPK and NDPK. dNK = 2′-deoxynucleoside kinase, dNMPK = 2′-deoxynucleoside monophosphate
  kinase, NDPK = nucleoside diphosphate kinase
