caption: Interaction network of differential metabolites and genes in the aminoacyl‐tRNA
  biosynthesis pathway. Red colored nodes represent upregulated metabolites and aminoacyl‐tRNA
  synthetases in gastric cancer. Blue and yellow rectangles indicate metabolite in
  the aminoacyl‐tRNA biosynthesis pathway and aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetases, respectively.
  (a) Aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetases and metabolites involved in alanine, aspartate, and
  glutamate metabolism and its related downstream metabolic pathways. (b) Aminoacyl‐tRNA
  synthetases and metabolites involved in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism
  and its related downstream metabolic pathways.
