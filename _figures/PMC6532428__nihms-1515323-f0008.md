caption: NF-κB is the pivot transcriptional regulator of inflammatory responses. Classical
  NF-κB pathway is primarily activated by IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκBα. Activated p65/p50 complex is then translocated into nucleus
  to promote expression of target genes. RhoE functions as a novel NF-κB suppressor.
  RhoE physically binds to p65 and p50 individually in cytosol to inhibit their nuclear
  translocation. RhoE-p65 and RhoE-p50 interactions also impede formation of the p65/p50
  heterodimer. Under RhoE deficiency condition, the inhibitory role of RhoE on NF-κB
  is diminished, which promotes the heterodimerization of p65 and p50, and the nuclear
  translocation of the p65/p50 complex, resulting in overactivated NF-κB and excessive
  inflammation.
