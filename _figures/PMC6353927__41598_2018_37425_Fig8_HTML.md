caption: Proposed mechanism of how solid stress signal transduction via Akt pathway
  regulates GDF15 expression to induce pancreatic cancer cell migration. The development
  of solid stress during the growth of several solid tumors, such as pancreatic cancer,
  activates Akt pathway which in turn phosphorylates CREB1. Subsequently, the activated
  CREB1 acts as transcription factor by a direct binding onto the promoter region
  of GDF15. GDF15 is then secreted and acts in an autocrine manner to promote pancreatic
  cancer cell migration.

  activation in pancreatic cancer cells.
