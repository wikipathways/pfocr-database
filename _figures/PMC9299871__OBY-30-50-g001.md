caption: Interaction network pathway analyses of plasma levels of omega‐6 and omega‐3
  polyunsaturated fatty acids in individuals with obesity versus normal‐weight individuals.
  The networks depict the differences of individual (A) omega‐6 and (B) omega‐3 lipid
  mediators in obesity compared with normal‐weight individuals. Blue boxes with yellow
  frame and red boxes with yellow frame indicate higher and lower levels, respectively,
  in both populations. Blue and red boxes without yellow frame are oxylipins without
  statistical significance. Enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway are represented
  in green. All oxylipin outcomes were log10‐transformed prior to data analysis. Oxylipins
  without boxes were not detected (ND) or not measured (NM). The abbreviations used
  for each oxylipin are detailed in Supporting Information Table
