caption: Endotoxin binds to CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the surface of
  monocytes and endothelial cells. The TLR4 associated Toll-IL-1-receptor domain (TIR)
  binds to myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which, through various intermediate
  steps, leads to the activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB). This transcription factor
  initiates the transcription of various inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF), interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE) which converts pro-IL-1 into
  bioactive IL-1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)which converts arachidonic acid into prostanoids
  such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which
  produces nitric oxide. The MyD88-dependent pathway can also be activated by IL-1
  and TNF signaling through their cognate receptors. The MyD88-independent pathway
  leads to the transcription of interferon-β (IFN-β).
