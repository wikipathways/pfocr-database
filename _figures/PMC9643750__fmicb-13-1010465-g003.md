caption: Possible carcinogenic mechanism of Streptococcus. The LPS (lipopolysaccharide)
  biosynthetic pathway and purine metabolic pathways are enriched in gastric cancer.
  Streptococcus abundance was positively correlated with the levels of serum amino
  acids (L-alanine, L-threonine, methionine, L-carnitine, guanidinoacetate), glutathione,
  cysteine, and methionine levels. Streptococcus was positively correlated with the
  number of CD3+ T cells and negatively correlated with the number of NK cells. Streptococcus
  is involved in the formation of NOC (nitroso compounds) in the stomach, and the
  formation of NOC increases the risk of gastric cancer.
