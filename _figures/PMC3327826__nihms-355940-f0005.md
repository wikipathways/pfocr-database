caption: Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  LHR mRNA down-regulation.Binding of ligand to LH receptor induces activation of
  ERK1/2 through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This leads to an increase in the expression
  of LRBP and thereby its’ LHR mRNA binding activity, which ultimately results in
  LHR mRNA degradation. Copyright 2011, The Endocrine Society.
