caption: Effects of recently identified drivers in signaling pathways involved in
  adrenal tumorigenesis. (A) Alterations in the PKA pathway caused by PRKACAp.L206R
  and PRKACALeu199_Cys200insTrp mutations in adrenocortical adenomas. Under normal
  conditions, the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA form a heterotetramer.
  In response to ACTH stimulation, the catalytic subunits are released from the complex
  in an active form. The free catalytic subunits phosphorylate their substrates and
  thereby increase the transcription of target genes. These target genes are mainly
  involved in the synthesis of cortisol and other steroids. The p.L206R and Leu199_Cys200insTrp
  mutations in the PRKACA gene alter its interaction with regulatory subunits of PKA
  leading to constitutive activation of PKAcα and increased steroidogenesis. (B) ARMC5,
  a new indirect or direct regulator of steroidogenic and apoptosis processes. ARMC5
  inactivating mutations induce a decreased steroidogenic capacity and a protection
  against cell death. (C) ZNRF3 a negative feedback regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. 1, In the absence of R-spondin (RPSO), ZNRF3 induces the poly-ubiquitination
  of Frizzled receptors (FZD) that promote their degradation. 2, In the presence of
  RSPO, ZNRF3 interacts with the complex RSPO/LGR4, which results in the turnover
  of ZNRF3 and thus the stability of FZD and the stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  3, In ACC, ZNRF3 alterations can produce similar effects of RSPO stimulation leading
  to an activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Red stars represent mutated or altered
  proteins.
