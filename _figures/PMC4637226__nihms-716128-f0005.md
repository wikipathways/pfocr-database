caption: Cartoon diagram of the hypothesized effects of mechanical loading, with or
  without LVAD support, on cardiac 7-TMR/GPCR signal transduction. Mechanical load
  is depicted as acting like a ligand in facilitating cell-surface receptor (GPCR)
  activation. This activates both G protein-mediated signaling as well as β-arrestin-mediated
  signaling, the latter of which also suppresses G protein coupling to the receptor
  (desensitization). As discussed in the text, chronic G protein and second messenger
  activation is cytotoxic, whereas several lines of evidence demonstrate that β-arrestin-mediated
  signaling is cytoprotective. As a result, it is suggested that load reduction may
  not selectively reduce G protein activation, and may also reduce β-arrestin activation.
  The effects of extent of loading/unloading and timing of LVAD support on differential
  pathway activity are unclear.
