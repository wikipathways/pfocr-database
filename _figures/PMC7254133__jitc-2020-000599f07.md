caption: Model representing the hetIL-15 triggered pathway for tumor infiltration
  by lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Activated CD8+ T and NK cells release IFN-γ
  and XCL1 in response to hetIL-15 treatment. The increased XCL1 concentration recruits
  cross-presenting cDC1 expressing the chemokine receptor XCR1. cDC1 in tumors respond
  to hetIL-15 by secreting the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, in an IFN-γ dependent
  manner. Systemic effects of hetIL-15 includes the enhanced frequency of circulating
  CXCR3+ CD8+ T and NK cells that can further infiltrate the tumor, following the
  CXCL9 and CXCL10 chemokine gradient. cDC1, conventional type 1 dendritic cells;
  hetIL-15, heterodimeric interleukin-15; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; NK, natural killer.
papertitle: Heterodimeric IL-15 delays tumor growth and promotes intratumoral CTL
  and dendritic cell accumulation by a cytokine network involving XCL1, IFN-γ, CXCL9
  and CXCL10.
