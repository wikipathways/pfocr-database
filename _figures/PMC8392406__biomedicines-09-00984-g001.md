caption: Role of melatonin and its cognate receptors in pain-relieving signal pathways.
  The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors expressed on glutamatergic neurons mediates
  anti-nociceptive effects. This interaction results in the activation of the PKCη
  signaling pathway and in turn suppresses mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  and calcium signaling. The interaction of melatonin with various neurotransmitter
  receptors, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (GABAA), produces anti-nociceptive
  effects. Furthermore, melatonin binds opioid and NMDA receptors to mediate downstream
  signaling, resulting in anti-nociceptive effects. Additionally, melatonin modulates
  ion flow by binding to Kir3 K+ channel which activates the outflow of K+ ions in
  the central nervous system. Conversely, melatonin inhibits the activities of sodium
  channels, including NAV1.8 and NAV1.9. Melatonin prevents the influx of Ca2+ by
  inhibiting calmodulin (CaM). CaM modulates intracellular 5’-AMP levels through the
  step-wise activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) by the intermediate generation of cAMP. Finally, melatonin modulates the inflammatory
  response and activation of glial cells by inhibiting the formation of arachidonic
  acid (AA) via the inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which leads to the subsequent
  inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the reduction
  in their targets, leukotriene (LT) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) respectively. Melatonin
  also decrease the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading
  to the decline in nitric oxide (NO) expression.
