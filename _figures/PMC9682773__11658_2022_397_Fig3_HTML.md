caption: 'Pathological role of AhR/CYP1A1 in the liver: AhR activation effects on
  the liver and subsequent impact on the development of T2DM. Activation of AhR in
  the liver initiates model crosstalk between AhR, PPAR-α signaling, circadian clock
  dysfunction, and several key regulatory pathways. AhR activation results in a decrease
  in PPAR-α levels, which further impacts β-oxidation. This is accompanied by decreased
  expression levels of PEPCK and G6Pase, known for regulating hyperglycemia and insulin
  resistance. Moreover, since PPAR-α also exhibits circadian variation, it influences
  CLOCK and BMAL1 levels, altering glucose tolerance and disrupting the regulation
  of specific metabolism genes. AhR has also been shown to control the expression
  of the TSP-1 protein, an antiangiogenic and proatherogenic protein involved in development
  of several vascular diabetic complications. Since many molecular pathways are regulated
  by AhR activation in the liver, these effects may implicate a subsequent impact
  on the development of T2DM. Created by bioRender.com'
