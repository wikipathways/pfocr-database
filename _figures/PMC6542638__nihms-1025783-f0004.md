caption: A. Collagen synthesis pathway. Secretion of pro-collagen and self-assembly
  is followed by the cleavage of the N- and C-termini of the pro-collagen trimer.
  The resulting collagen monomers are released in the extracellular matrix, aggregate
  into collagen fibrils and form covalent crosslinks, leading to collagen fibers formation.
  B. Mechanism of collagen crosslinking. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyses collagen cross-linking.[]
