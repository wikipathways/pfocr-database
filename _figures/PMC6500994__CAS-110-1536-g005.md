caption: Model depicting how novel drugs targeting the Y‐box binding protein‐1 (YBX1)
  activation pathway overcome drug resistance. YBX1 is phosphorylated by Ser/Thr kinases
  involving AKT/mTOR/p70S6K and/or MEK/ERK/p90RSK signaling pathways. Phosphorylated
  YBX1 induces oncogenic transcriptional activation of various YBX1 targeted genes
  and plays crucial roles in cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. Development
  of inhibitors of the activation pathways of YBX1 would facilitate overcoming intrinsic
  and acquired resistance in addition to malignant progression
