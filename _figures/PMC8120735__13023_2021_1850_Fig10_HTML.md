caption: A summary of how loss-of- function variants can lead to autophagy. Calcium
  ions can enter into neuronal cell via Cav1.2, Cav1.4, Cavα2δ, Cav2.1, Cav2.2, Cav2.3,
  Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3. In normal physiology, some of the calcium ions go to
  the nucleus to initiate gene transcription, translation and protein synthesis essential
  for learning and memory, some go to mitochondria for ATP synthesis (essential for
  learning and memory) and some to the endoplasmic reticulum for storage. Calcium
  stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is used when there is minimal/no influx
  of calcium ions inside the cells. Autophagy occurs when there is metabolic stress
  such as low ATP and nutrient starvation. Low levels of calcium ions inside the neuronal
  cell being due to loss-of- function of calcium channels or due to depletion in ER
  can activate autophagy pathway. Low calcium entrance in the mitochondria will lead
  to low production of ATP which will activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK,
  a sensor of energy levels) and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) which in turn induce autophagy.
  Likewise, low calcium levels from the ER can activate calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) and then AMPK leading to autophagy. Dotted arrows signify
  low levels. Few red solid circles stand for low calcium ions levels
