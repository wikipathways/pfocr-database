caption: 'The Bitter Taste Receptor Signaling Pathway: when the ligand binds to the
  TAS2R, a conformational change is induced. This in turn triggers the dissociation
  of the α-subunit of gustducin from the β- and γ-subunits. This dissociation of subunits
  signifies two divergent pathways of signal transduction. In the first of these,
  β- and γ-subunits activate the β2 isoform of phospholipase C (PLCβ2), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).
  IP3 then travels to Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), where it binds to its receptor (IP3R),
  leading to the secretion of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytoplasm. This increase in
  intracellular Ca2+ levels leads to the activation of sodium-selective transmembrane
  transporters TRPM4 and 5, thereby depolarizing the cellular membrane. Depolarization
  activates voltage-gated sodium channels (VGNC), thus hastening depolarization. When
  the action potential (AP) is reached, the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 and 3
  (CALHM1/3) channel and pannexin 1 channels are activated, which leads to the transportation
  of ATP from cytoplasm to the intercellular space. Through P2X ionotropic purinergic
  receptors 2 and 3 (P2X2/P2X3), ATP is taken into the afferent nerve, thereby propagating
  the signal further down. The other pathway occurs through the α-subunit of gustducin,
  but the exact mechanism of signal propagation is unknown. It is postulated that
  α-gustducin lowers the level of cAMP by activating its hydrolysation though phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), but the next steps are still unknown. The lowering of cAMP may lead to a
  decrease in the levels of cNMPs intracellularly, which may regulate protein kinases
  and in turn regulate the ion activity in the cell. It is also possible that cNMP
  directly regulates cNMP-gated ion channels, thereby depolarizing the membrane and
  eliciting the release of the neurotransmitter.'
