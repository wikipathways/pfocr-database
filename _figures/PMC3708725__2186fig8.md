caption: TRAIL induces reversible resistance and inflammatory pathways in cells that
  survive an initial treatment. In this schematic, yellow shadings depict nongenetic
  heterogeneity in protein levels or other factors in a naive cell population. After
  treatment, the sensitive fraction of cells dies by apoptosis via a caspase-8/10
  (C8/10) pathway, and the less sensitive fraction survives (dark yellow cells). TRAIL-induced
  NF-κB signaling is activated in both sensitive and resistant cells but is cut short
  in cells that die (see blow-ups i and ii). Within hours, survivor cells activate
  a transcriptional program and enter a state of induced reversible resistance whose
  peak lasts for ∼24 h (survivors; red cells, filled nuclei); resistance involves
  attenuated DISC assembly that prevents activation of sufficient C8/10 to initiate
  apoptosis when cells are retreated with TRAIL (blow-up ii). Resistant cells exhibit
  activation of a FLIP-dependent, NF-κB–mediated inflammatory response, although resistance
  is independent of both NF-κB and FLIP. When TRAIL is removed, survival and inflammation
  signals decay as cells divide, and within several days protein levels redistribute
  such that the new cell population is equivalent to the starting control population
  (reset cells). In contrast, if survivors are reexposed to TRAIL treatment during
  the resistance stage, resistance and inflammatory phenotypes are sustained (repeat
  cells). NF-κB activation is submaximal upon repeated treatment of survivor/repeat
  cells due to attenuated DISC assembly but is sufficient to sustain inflammatory
  phenotypes (blow-up iii). Repeat cells (orange shading) have an intermediate gene
  expression profile that has characteristics of both control and survivor cells.

  description: TRAIL induces reversible resistance and inflammatory pathways in cells
    that survive an initial treatment. In this schematic, yellow shadings depict nongenetic
