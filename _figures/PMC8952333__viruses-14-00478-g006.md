caption: Restriction factors acting along the HIV-1 assembly pathway. On the left
  is pictured the unrestricted assembly of particles with fully cleaved Env. GBP5
  and MARCH8 act to reduce particle infectivity through effects on Env, with a reduction
  in furin-mediated cleavage (GBP5) or disruption of Env trafficking and incorporation
  (MARCH8). PSGL-1 reduces Env incorporation but also reduces attachment to target
  cells. IQGAP1 binds to Gag and modulates particle formation, with reduced production
  of particles upon overexpression. Tetherin acts to prevent the release of fully
  formed particles, forming a physical tether to the PM and also acting as an innate
  immune sensor to stimulate signaling leading to NF-κB activation.
