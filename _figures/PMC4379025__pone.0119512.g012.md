caption: Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of telomerase, PKC and the PI3k/Akt/mTOR/STAT3
  signaling pathway leads to decreases in AFP expression and secretion. In contrast,
  the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway did not show any effect. However, the combination
  of a telomerase inhibitor with other pathway inhibitors (see  section) presented
  an additive effect with costunolide. The mechanism underlying the action of telomerase
  remains unclear. The modulation of AFP by telomerase may be either through the PI3k/Akt/mTOR/STAT3
  signaling pathway or through an independent pathway. Further investigations are
  needed to elucidate the modulation of AFP by telomerase.
