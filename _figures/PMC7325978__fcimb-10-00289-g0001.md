caption: Model of DNA damage response (DDR) due to DSB. (A) The panel shows the cascade
  of events that are triggered by a DSB and the factors that affect the choice of
  HRR or NHEJ. (B) The hypothesis of the use of the HRR pathway as a drug target for
  the development of new anti-T. gondii therapies is graphed.
