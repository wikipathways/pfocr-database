caption: Model illustrating the regulation of dopamine signaling by  Cdk5/phospho-Thr-75
  DARPP-32 and regulation of the  Cdk5/phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 pathway by dopamine.
  The Cdk5 signaling  and PKA signaling pathways, through a positive feedback loop,
  are  mutually antagonistic. (Left) Under basal conditions,  phosphorylation of DARPP-32
  at Thr-75 by Cdk5 causes, successively,  inhibition of PKA, inactivation of PP-2A,
  and decreased  dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32. Inhibition of PKA also  results
  in decreased phosphorylation of DARPP-32-Thr-34 and, therefore,  in activation of
  PP-1. Inhibition of PKA and activation of PP-1  synergistically reduce the phosphorylation
  of various substrates.  (Right) Dopamine, by sequentially activating dopamine D1  receptors,
  PKA and PP-2A, reduces the level of phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32.  Dephosphorylation
  of DARPP-32 at Thr-75 by PP-2A removes the inhibition  of PKA. Activation of PKA
  also results in increased phosphorylation of  DARPP-32-Thr-34 and in inhibition
  of PP-1. Activation of PKA and  inhibition of PP-1 synergistically increase the
  phosphorylation of  various substrates.
