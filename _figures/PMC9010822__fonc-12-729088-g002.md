caption: Noncanonical HH signaling transductions are depicted, including SHH-mediated,
  Ptch-mediated, Smo-mediated and Gli-mediated noncanonical signaling. SHH-mediated
  noncanonical pathway is associated with cellular repair and lymphangiogenesis. Ptch-mediated
  but Smo-independent pathway is activated by SHH to induce Wnt signaling and cytoskeletal
  remodeling. In Smo-mediated but Gli-independent noncanonical pathway, the SHH ligand
  activates LKB1-AMPK and Gαi-LGN-NuMA-dynein axes in neurons, leading to activation
  of autophagy and ciliogenesis. There is a crosstalk between Gli activated and Smo-independent
  pathways as well as with numerous oncogenic pathways, resulting in lung cancer tumorigenesis
  and development.
