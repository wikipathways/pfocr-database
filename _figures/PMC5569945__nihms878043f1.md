caption: mTORC1 has six and mTORC2 has seven protein components. Both complexes have
  the catalytic mTOR subunit, mLST8, DEPTOR, and the Tti1-Tel2 complex in common.
  Raptor and PRAS40 are part of mTORC1 whereas Rictor, mSin1 and Protor1/2 are part
  of mTORC2. mTOR acts as a catalytic serine/threonine kinase while DEPTOR is an inhibitor
  of mTOR activity. The Tti1-Tel2 complex acts as a scaffolding protein, which regulates
  the assembly and stability of mTORC1 and mTORC2. mLST8 binds to mTOR near its kinase
  domain and regulates its function. PRAS40 binds to mTORC1 and acts as an inhibitor
  of mTORC1 activity. Raptor is a scaffolding protein, and it regulates assembly,
  localization and substrate binding of mTORC1. Rictor acts as the scaffolding protein
  in mTORC2 and regulates the assembly and substrate binding of mTORC2. Protor and
  mSin1 regulate mTORC2's interaction with SGK1. Moreover, mSin1 acts as a scaffolding
  protein regulating the assembly of mTORC2. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
