caption: Schematic of the flow of glucose carbons in the presence of added fructose
  in adipocytes. The red arrows indicate pathways with increased flow of glucose carbons
  and the green arrows indicate pathways where the flow of glucose carbons are decreased
  or not significantly altered. PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate Dehydrogenase;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; SHMT2, serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (mitochondria); CH2-THF, Methyltetrahydrofolate; CH+-THF, 5, 10-methenyl THF; MTHFD2L,
  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP, mitochondria); MTHFD2, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase (NAD) methenyl tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (mitochondria); CHO-THF,
  10-formyl THF; MTHFD1L, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (mitochondria); MFT, mitochondrial
  folate transporter (SLC25A32); FOR, formate; MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  (NADP) methenyl tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase
  (cytosol); MTHFD1L, formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (mitochondria); SHMT1, serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase (cytosol); NNT, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase.
  P-(Glycine cleavage system protein P (glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating));
  L—Glycine cleavage system protein L (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase); T—Glycine
  cleavage system protein (aminomethyltransferase). The SOGC pathway portion in the
  figure has been adapted from []. This figure does not reflect equilibrium or steady
  state distributions. It only shows glucose flux relationships by surrogates based
  on isotopic labeling.
