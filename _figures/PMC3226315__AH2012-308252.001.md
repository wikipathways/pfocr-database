caption: The recent focus in JMML has concentrated on using the information gained
  from knowledge of these molecular defects in order to design targeted drug therapy.
  Animal models, especially mouse models of the disease, are commonly used to test
  molecularly targeted agents. Since RAS hyperactivation is very important in the
  pathophysiology of JMML, agents designed to decrease RAS activity are being evaluated.
  There are numerous approaches that have been tested to target this pathway ().
