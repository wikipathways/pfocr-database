caption: A brief schematic illustration of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling (SOCS)‐associated
  JAK‐STAT signalling pathway. (a) Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are expressed
  in various immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils
  and epithelial cells. Upon infection, the immune cells recognise foreign viral antigens
  via PRRs such as the Toll‐like receptors (TLRs), and retinoic acid‐inducible gene
  I‐like receptors (RLRs), thereby stimulating the production of cytokines and interferons
  (IFN). (b) IFN bind to IFN receptors on the cell surface and subsequently stimulate
  the associated JAK‐STAT signalling pathway for the activation of antiviral interferon‐stimulated
  genes (ISGs). This, in turn, promotes transcription of antiviral genes such as oligoadenylate
  synthetase (OAS) and latent endoribonuclease (RNaseL) (shown as OAS‐RNaseL), leading
  to the cleavage of both host and viral RNA – thus impeding viral replication. (Figure
  is redrawn from Park and Iwasaki.)
