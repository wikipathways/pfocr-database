caption: Relationships between metabolic pathways and samples. KEGG network summarizing
  the relationships between metabolic pathways related to carbohydrates (red), amino
  acids (yellow), and lipids (blue) and samples (cyan, spontaneous; green, inoculated).
  Metabolic pathways and samples are connected with lines (i.e., edges) for which
  the thickness is proportional to the abundance of that pathway in the connected
  sample.
