caption: The G2/M checkpoints in response to DNA damage are exerted through the p53-dependent
  and p53-independent pathways, both of which target CDK1-cyclin B. Both p53-dependent
  and - independent G2/M checkpoint responses are triggered by activation of ATM/ATR
  and CHK1/CHK2 kinases. In the p53-independent pathway, CHK1 and CHK2 phosphorylate
  and inhibit CDC25A, B and C. CHK1 also inhibits the activity of PLK1, which is known
  to activate CDC25C. CHK1 also appears to suppress CDC25B by blocking the access
  of CDC25B to centrosomally localized CDK1-cyclin B (initial activation of CDK1-cyclin
  B is thought to occur at centrosomes) [, ]. CHK1 also phosphorylates and up-regulates
  the activity of WEE1 kinase that catalyzes the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1.
  All these events block the activation of CDK1-cyclin B in a concerted fashion, resulting
  in late G2 arrest. In the p53-dependent pathway, ATM/ATR and CHK1/CHK2 phosphorylate
  and stabilize p53, which in turn up-regulates p21. p21 then suppresses the activity
  of CDK1-cyclin B, leading to late G2 arrest. This G2 arrest provides time for centrosomes
  to regain duplication competency and re-duplicate. However, CDK2 activity is still
  required for centrosomes to re-duplicate. In late G2 phase, high levels of already
  active form of CDK2 (mostly complexed with cyclin A) are present. In cells arrested
  by the G2/M checkpoint responses, those CDK2 kinases remain active even efficient
  inhibition of CDC25s. However, if the intact p53-dependent pathway is present, centrosome
  re-duplication is blocked by the p21-mediated suppression of the CDK2 activity.
  In contrast, in the absence of the p53-dependent pathway, centrosomes re-duplication
  is continuously triggered by active CDK2-cyclin E/A.
