caption: The figure shows some of the known interaction partners and signaling pathways
  of Gal-3BP, which lead to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during virus
  infection. The viral DNA/RNA induces IFNs and TNF-α, that in turn induce Gal-3BP.
  The protein can act both intra- and extracellularly. Extracellularly, Gal-3BP can
  interact with galectin-3-inducing RAS-signaling pathway and IL-6 expression. Gal-3BP
  can also directly interact with virus particles reducing their infectivity. Intracellularly,
  Gal-3BP acts as a scaffold protein interacting with both TRAF-6/transforming growth
  factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TRAF3/TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complexes
  which leads to the production of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.
