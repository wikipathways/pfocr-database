caption: Putative mechanism of necroptosis and relative inflammatory responses during
  the development of CCI. In the CCI model, CCI stimulates TNF-α production and TNFR1
  signaling, and activation of the downstream RIP1/RIP3-MLKL signaling pathway, which
  triggers necroptotic death and release of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
  further contributing to additional inflammatory factors. Nec-1 and Melatonin administration
  decreased necroptosis and extracellular HMGB1 levels, which decreased inflammation
  induced by RAGE expression and the detrimental effect of HMGB1 signaling in CCI.
  Thus, Nec-1 and melatonin inhibit the inflammatory responses and downstream NF-κB,
  NLRP3, IL-6 and IL-1β, contributing to neuroprotection. A20 also plays a role in
  this process and deficient expression of A20 could aggravate CCI-induced necroptosis.
  In addition, silencing A20 could impair the anti-necroptotic effect of Nec-1 and
  melatonin.
