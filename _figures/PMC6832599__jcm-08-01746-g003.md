caption: Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases family implications and therapeutic
  targets in cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases alter specific PDE(s)
  either by increasing or decreasing PDE activity in a compartmentalized manner in
  conjunction with receptor responses. Not only might the cGMP pathway be impacted
  by natriuretic peptides, but also the cAMP pathway. Since PDE2 and PDE3, which are
  oppositely modulated by cGMP level, are both present in cardiomyocytes, dependently
  of their relative activities, they might also participate in the regulation of cardiac
  cGMP (see ). In that way, the alterations in natriuretic peptides might impact not
  only cGMP signaling, but also cAMP signaling. Thus, by overcoming specific characterized
  PDE alterations, it should be possible to restore a physiologic status by conceiving
  new PDE modulators, notably PDE inhibitors (PDEi). 5′ AMP, 5′ adenosine monophosphate;
