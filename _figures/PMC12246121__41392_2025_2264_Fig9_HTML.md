caption: Transcriptional regulation in PRRs-mediated inflammatory response. a Activation
  and repression mediated by transcription factors. For example, the SUMOylation of
  the WRKY33 TF enhances its interaction with MAPK3 and MAPK6 of PRRs’ downstream
  signaling pathway. b Regulation of enhancers and promoters in PRRs. For example,
  NF-κB possesses the ability to activate poised enhancers and promoters among TLR4.
  c Epigenetic modifications in PRRs, including three pivotal epigenetic events—DNA
  methylation, histone acetylation, and noncoding RNA. For example, Patients with
  COVD-19 showed heightened methylation of the TLR4 and TNF-α. This figure is created
