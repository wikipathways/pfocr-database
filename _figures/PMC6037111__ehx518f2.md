caption: Consequences of hepatic fructose metabolism. Increased sugar consumption
  results in increased uptake of fructose, resulting in ATP depletion that may cause
  increased uric acid production and hyperuricemia leading to arterial hypertension.
  Fructose is further metabolized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate
  inducing triacylglycerol synthesis and DNL, leading to hepatic steatosis, whereas
  fatty acid oxidation is repressed. Diacylglycerol activates PKCepsilon, resulting
  in decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and induction of gluconeogenesis. Fructose
  produced by the polyol pathway may also be transported back to the blood stream
  leading to hyperfructosemia. ACC, acetyl-coa carboxylase; ACLY, ATP citrate lyase;
  CPT1, carnitine-palmitoyltransferase 1; ChREBP, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding
  protein; DAG, diacylglycerole; FAS, fatty acid synthase; FATP5, fatty acid transport
