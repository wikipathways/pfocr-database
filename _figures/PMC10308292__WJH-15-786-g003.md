caption: 'Vascular endothelial growth factor B regulates lipid metabolism in the “first
  hit” of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via the activated protein kinase signaling
  pathway. Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) performs its biological function
  by combining with VEGFR1. Once it enters the cell, it activates Calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase β (CaMKKβ), which is induced by an increase in intracellular Ca2+
  content. VEGFB activates the CaMKKβ-mediated activated protein kinase (AMPK)/A carboxylase
  (ACC)/carnitine palmitate transferase (CPT1) signaling pathway and related genes,
  such as CPT1 and long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, which regulate FFA oxidation
  in mitochondria. VEGFB activates AMPK/SREBP1/SCD1 and related genes, such as ACC1
  and FAS, to inhibit lipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. CaMKKβ: Calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase β; AMPK: Adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase;
  ACC: A carboxylase; CPT1: Carnitine palmitate transferase-1; FFA: Free fatty acid;
  NRP1/2: Neuropilin 1/2; SCD1: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1; SREBP1: Sterol-regulatory
  element-binding protein-1; VEGFB: Vascular endothelial growth factor B; VEGF: Vascular
  endothelial growth factor; VEGFB: Vascular endothelial growth factor B; FAS: fatty
  acid synthase; ACO: Acyl Coenzyme A Oxidase; HSL: hormone-sensitive lipase; LCAD:
