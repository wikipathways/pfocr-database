caption: 'Relationship between integrin αvβ3, thyroid hormones, TF/FVIIa, angiogenesis,
  inflammation, and thrombus formation. When TF is released, it activates factor VII
  (VIIa) forming a complex that activates thrombus formation. TF is expressed on vascular
  endothelial cells, circulating monocyte and platelet where its activation upregulates
  VEGF that promotes angiogenesis. Non-genomic actions of thyroid hormones are initiated
  on integrin αvβ3. Thyroid hormones activate the NF-kB pathway, thus promoting the
  production of VEGF, cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Thrombus formation and
  angiogenesis stimulation affect inflammation pathway and vice versa. Either sulfated
  non-anticoagulant LMWH (SNACH) or integrin αvβ3 receptor blockade suppresses inflammation,
  angiogenesis, and indirectly the thrombosis processes. abbreviations: ABP-280, actin-binding
