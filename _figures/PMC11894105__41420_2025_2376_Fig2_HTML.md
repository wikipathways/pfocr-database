caption: The extrinsic pathway is the binding of various cytokines including TNF-α,
  TRAIL and CD95 to their respective receptors, and the death receptors have a death
  domain for recruiting downstream adaptor proteins (FADD,TRADD) and pro-caspase 8
  to form a death inducing signaling complex, which leads to the activation of caspase-8
  and further activates caspase3 and caspase 7.The intrinsic pathway is activated
  by various stresses and induces transcription and translation of pro-apoptotic members
  of the BCL-2 family, which binds to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and release BAK and BAX,
  which then assemble to form complexes that lead to MOMP and the release of apoptotic
  factors cytochrome c and Smac. Smac is able to relieve the restriction of caspase
  by XIAP, and cytochrome c binds to the cell membrane protein APAF1 to form an apoptotic
  complex (apoptosome) and activate caspase 9
