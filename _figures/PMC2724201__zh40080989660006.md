caption: 'Schematic depicting proposed mechanisms by which the nucleoside adenosine
  elicits an adenoprotective action in the myocardium. Adenosine affords adenoprotection
  against overstimulation by adrenergic agents via two mechanisms: 1) the direct attenuation
  of the adrenergic signaling pathway (anti-adrenergic action; top); and 2) the reduction
  of contractile responsiveness independently of this pathway (indirect; bottom).
  β-R, β1-adrenergic receptor; Gs and Gi, stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins, respectively;
  PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PLC, phospholipase C; + and − depict an activation
  and inhibition, respectively, in the subsequent event.'
