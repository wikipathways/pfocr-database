caption: 'Signaling pathway of liver fibrogenisisThe injured liver produces various
  cell factors, which can activate transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and platelet-derived
  growth factor beta (PDGF-β), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Through the TGF-β
  signaling pathway, Smad2/3 are phosphorylated and activate downstream molecules
  such as extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, resulting in the deposition of collagen.
  Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are greatly increased through the PDGF-β pathway and
  they induce the secretion of collagens and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
  (TIMPs). Thus, the degradation of collagens decreases and the secretion increases,
  leading to the deposition of collagens, which results in worsened liver disease.
