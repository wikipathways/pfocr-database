caption: 'Differentially expressed genes connected to electron transport chain pathway.
  The scheme shows electron transport chain pathway and was downloaded from WikiPathways
  database. The blue, downward-pointing arrows show genes, which were down-regulated
  in GBM cells after GO treatment. Here, we list differentially expressed genes, that
  are not shown on the scheme, but that are connected to electron transport chain:
  ATP5EP2 (connected to overrepresented term: ATP synthesis coupled proton transport—GO:0015986),
  COA6 (cytochrome-c oxidase activity—GO:0004129), COX14 (Respiratory electron transport—Reactome),
  UQCRHL (Electron Transport Chain (Homo sapiens)—WikiPathways), UQCRQ (Electron Transport
  Chain (Homo sapiens)—WikiPathways), USMG5 (mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP
  synthase complex—GO:0005753)'
