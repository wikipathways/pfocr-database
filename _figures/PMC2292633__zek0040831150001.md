caption: Nitrate assimilation pathway in photosynthetic eukaryotes (A) and genes for
  its regulation (B). (A) Two transport and two reduction steps are required to produce
  ammonium in the chloroplast, where it is subsequently incorporated. FdxH, reduced
  ferredoxin. (B) Phenotypes of mutants defective in positive and negative signaling
  and the possible genes affected (). NI, nitrate insensitive; ON, overexpression
  in nitrate; AI, ammonium insensitive.
