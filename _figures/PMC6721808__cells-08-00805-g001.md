  biosynthesis. Parts of PPP as well as reactions catalyzed by IDH and malic enzymes

  e.g., oxaloacetate, are linked to the urea cycle, an important arginine source.

  the TCA cycle. Additionally, glutaminolysis is important for the synthesis of glutathione,
  a major player in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The exchange of glutamine
