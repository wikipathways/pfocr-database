caption: Role for the UBE2O-AMPKα2 axis in cancer and its implications for cancer
  therapy. Amplification or overexpression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2O (UBE2O)
  in cancer results in the degradation of AMP-activated protein kinase-α 2 (AMPKα2),
  the consequent upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)–hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1-α (HIF1α) pathway, and rewires metabolism to undergo glycolysis which is
  cancer promoting. Thus, its genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade impairs
  tumorigenesis through the restoration of AMPKα2. Ub, ubiquitin; K470, lysine-470
  (K470); β, AMP-activated protein kinase-beta; γ, AMP-activated protein kinase-gamma.
