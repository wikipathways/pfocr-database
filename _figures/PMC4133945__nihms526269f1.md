caption: DKK1 protein is a classical inhibitor of Wnt signaling pathway that typically
  antagonizes Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, by binding to the Wnt co-receptors Lrp and
  blocking their interaction with Wnt and transmembrane co-receptors Frizzled. Kremens
  are single-pass transmembrane DKK1 receptors that synergize with DKK1 to inhibit
  Wnt signaling by promoting the endocytosis of LRP. DKK1 protein act as natural Wnt
  antagonists by bridging LRP and Kremens, inducing the internalization of the complex.
  Activating the β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) transcription complex consequently
  regulates downstream target genes. Thus, it is expected to negatively regulation
  bone formation in MBD.
