caption: Pathways flagged from metabolomics analysis using MetaboAnalyst software.
  Signatory metabolites involved in each pathway are illustrated in the form of pie
  charts according to their relative intensities and presence across the different
  cultivars and treated groups. (A) The phenylpropanoid pathway, (B) the flavonoid
  pathway overlapping with the phenylpropanoid pathway (*), and (C) the linoleic acid
  pathway that showed the highest impact after pathway enrichment analysis, along
  with (D), the general secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway. Some limitations
  in MetaboAnalyst prevented the mapping of all annotated metabolites (). The different
  colours indicate “Dunnart” infected (pink), “Dunnart control” (dark green), “SWK001”
  infected (red) and “SWK001” control (light green). The metabolites synthesised via
  the phenylpropanoid-and flavonoid pathways are some of the most widely occurring
  secondary metabolites that are involved in plant development and defence against
  abiotic and biotic stresses, such as phenolics, flavonoids, coumarins and lignin
  [,]. Both pathways are initiated with the conversion of phenylalanine to p-coumaroyl-CoA
  and have some overlap, as shown (*) in B. The presence and distribution of the phenolic
  compounds, from both the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, across the plant
  kingdom at a cellular, tissue and organ level emphasises the vast biological and
  biochemical functions important to the survival of plants [,]. Phenolics have been
  known to play important roles in plant-pathogen interactions as either pre-formed
  (phytoanticipins) or induced anti-pathogenic molecules (phytoalexins) []. Linoleic
  acids (C18:2) are unsaturated fatty acids that are prevalent in plant membranes,
  hence making them important for plant structure and maintaining water permeability
  and, additionally, are involved in the formation of jasmonate, which act as signalling
  molecules in response to tissue damage caused by insects, pathogens, herbivores
  or mechanical stress [].
