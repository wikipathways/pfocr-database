caption: Model of carbon metabolism in the WT during AsIII exposure, with mannitol
  being the initial substrate. Reaction steps were derived from KEGG pathway maps
  using the most parsimonious routes of metabolite formation, noting that not all
  enzyme reaction steps are depicted in the model. When multiple intermediates are
  involved between illustrated metabolites, the number of reactions is shown; i.e.,
  ×3, with the number of intermediates identified shown in parentheses. Green text
  denotes metabolites increased in abundance; blue text denotes metabolites decreased
  in abundance. Red dashed vector arrows indicate reactions suggested to be inhibited
  by AsIII; (PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase; KDGH = alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase).
  Transcripts are denoted by AT5A identification number (purple text), with a triangle
  indication increased expression (←) or decreased expression (↔) upon AsIII exposure.
