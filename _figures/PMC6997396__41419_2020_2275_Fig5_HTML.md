caption: Autophagic activity is significantly reduced in hepatocytes during obesity.
  Inhibition of autophagy promotes hepatocyte lipid accumulation, malfunction of mitochondria,
  and cell stresses including ER stress. This, in turn, induces insulin resistance,
  results in a fatty liver and disrupts the normal liver functions. Induced insulin
  secretion due to metabolic syndrome will directly affect the autophagy process by
  activating mTOR and inhibiting the FoxO via PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, increased
  calpain 2 will further inhibit autophagy and increase amino acid concentrations
  which may contribute to upregulation of mTOR activity during obesity and metabolic
  syndrome.
