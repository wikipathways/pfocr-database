caption: Model for C. neoformans Rho GTPases in protection against thermal stress
  and their relationship to the PKC1 cell integrity pathway. (A) Under growth conditions
  at 24째C, Rho1 is not active, and Rho11 is negatively inhibited by Rho10. This leads
  to inactivation of the cell integrity pathway as measured by Mpk1 phosphorylation.
  (B) Under thermal stress conditions (39째C for 1 h), Rho1 signals the activation
  of the cell integrity pathway, and Mpk1 is phosphorylated. Rho10 is inactivated,
  thereby releasing inhibition of Rho11, resulting in activation of the cell integrity
  pathway. Rho10 may also positively regulate an unknown protein or process that leads
  to the activation of the thermal stress response independent of Mpk1 phosphorylation
  (dashed arrows). For thermal stress response, Pkc1 is dispensable; therefore, Rho
  proteins likely interact with downstream components of the PKC1 pathway (brackets
  and solid arrows). Rho1, Rho10, and Rho11 act in concert and require balance to
  regulate the precise and critical amount of Mpk1 phosphorylation needed for growth
  and combating thermal stress.
