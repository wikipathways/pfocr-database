caption: A, the scheme shows the most relevant metabolites regulating NAD-ME1 or NAD-ME2
  activity. NAD-ME1 and -2 are differentially activated by intermediates of the TCA
  cycle (fumarate, succinate, and OAA), the glycolytic pathway (FBP and PEP), and
  CoA. B, shown is postulated regulation of NAD-ME activity in Arabidopsis by differential
  native association. The three native associations of NAD-ME (NAD-ME1, -2, and -H)
  display different kinetic responses to malate and differential regulation by metabolites.
  The most relevant differential properties among the oligomers are indicated.
