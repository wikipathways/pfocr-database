caption: Proposed model for glyoxylic acid (GLA) as a metabolic hub connecting ripening
  associated pathways in the peroxisome (glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation),
  mitochondria (tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and cytochrome c (CYTc) pathway), cytoplasm
  (methionine cycle and ethylene biosynthesis), and endoplasmic reticulum (ethylene
  perception and signaling). (1) Putative sites for direct activation of alternative
  oxidase (AOX) are indicated by the red dashed arrows. 1A-Glyoxylate has previously
  been shown to activate AOX activity in Arabidopsis directly, and GLA is hypothesized
  to elicit similar AOX activation in other systems, indicated by a red dashed arrow.
  1B-Addition of GLA increases pools of metabolic intermediates in the glyoxylate
  cycle, resulting in increased flux through the cycle. (2) Production of malate and
  its subsequent conversion to oxaloacetate (OAA), perpetuates the glyoxylate cycle,
  producing intermediates shared by the TCA cycle, including those which can be shuttled
  between intracellular compartments (e.g., citrate). Thus, GLA leads to increased
  flux through both glyoxylate and TCA cycles. (3) The oxidative decarboxylations
  of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle result in the transfer of high-energy
  electrons to NADH, which is transported to the mitochondrial CYTc pathway. (4) Conversion
  of succinate to fumarate in the TCA cycle results in the transfer of additional
  high energy electrons to complex II of the CYTc pathway. (5) The resulting increased
  flux of electrons necessitates the activation of AOX to prevent CYTc over reduction.
  (6) In addition to respiratory activation, the TCA and glyoxylate cycles share the
  common intermediate OAA, which can be converted to aspartate and subsequently to
  the precursors of methionine. (7) Methionine, a precursor for ethylene biosynthesis,
  is converted to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). From SAM, methionine is either (8)
  recycled via the Yang cycle, or (9) converted directly into ethylene. (10) Ethylene
  binds to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound receptors (ETRs), initiating the ethylene
  signal cascade and downstream ripening-associated responses.
