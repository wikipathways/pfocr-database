caption: The pathway of net citrate production in citrate-producing prostate epithelial
  cells. Aspartate provides the intramitochondrial source of oxaloacetate and glucose
  provides the source of acetyl-CoA for citrate synthesis. The key regulatory enzymes
  for citrate synthesis are mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and pyruvate
  dehydrogenase. Citrate oxidation is limited due to the inhibition of m-aconitase
  activity by the in-tramitochondrial accumulation of high zinc levels. Citrate accumulates
  within the cell and is ultimately secreted as a major constituent of prostatic fluid.
  Asp = Aspartate; Gluc = glucose; Glut = glutamate; OAA = oxalacetate; CoASH = coenzyme
  A; AcCoA = acetyl coenzyme A; Isocit = isocitrate; αKG = α-ketoglutarate; Succ =
  succinate; Mal = ma-late; Pyr = pyruvate; Lact = lactate; PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  CS = citrate synthase; ACON = aconitase; mAAT = mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase;
  GDH = glutamic dehydrogenase.
