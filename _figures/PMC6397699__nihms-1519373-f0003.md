caption: Schema showing physiologic MAPK signaling (left panel) or signaling in cells
  with MEK mutants. RAF-independent MEK mutants strongly activate ERK and induce negative
  feedback regulation of upstream signaling. These mutants are able to auto-phosphorylate
  the key regulatory sites S218 and S222 on MEK in cis. RAF-regulated MEK mutants
  exhibit some independent kinase activity, but this activity can be increased further
  in the presence of activated RAF, augmenting signaling from RAF. They do not activate
  ERK signaling to the same degree as the RAF-independent MEK mutants and therefore
  exhibit more modest feedback inhibition of upstream signaling. RAF-dependent mutants
  increase ERK activation only in the setting of active RAF; they bind more tightly
  to RAF, augmenting ERK activation. They modestly activate ERK and lead to minimal
  feedback inhibition of upstream signaling and often co-occur with upstream, activating
  alterations.
