caption: 'Once induced, IFNs are secreted from the infected cell and signal in an
  autocrine and paracrine manner through the JAK/STAT pathway. This signaling leads
  to the activation of the ISGF3 complex, which consists of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9,
  and translocates to the nucleus to induce ISGs with broad antiviral functions. Both
  STAT1 and STAT2 are inhibited by viruses, as shown here. Abbreviations: Dengue virus
  (DenV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and interferon α receptor (IFNAR).'
