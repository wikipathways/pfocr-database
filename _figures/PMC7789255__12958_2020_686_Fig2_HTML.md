caption: 'The possible paracrine mechanisms controlling differentiation of spermatogonia
  in adult testis. The spermatogenic cells arise from differentiation of undifferentiated
  type A spermatogonia (2n). The Ap spermatogonia can divide to form an Ap and a differentiatimg
  type B spermatogonia (2n) through the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium stages
  VIII to IX. B spermatogonia divide randomly and differentiate to form primary (4n)
  and secondary spermatocytes (2n) through meiotic divisions. The secondary spermatocytes
  proceed through the rest of meiosis to form elongating spermatids (n). Differentiation
  of spermatogonia occurs during stages of VII-VIII when the RA concentration is at
  the highest levels. FSH is necessary for early-stage of spermatogonia differentiation
  and their meiotic entry. FSH induces spermatogonia differentiation and their meiotic
  entry thorough controlling RA signaling and several growth factors acting on the
  early stages of mammalian spermatogenesis. In one hand, FSH probably induces the
  activation of RA signaling pathway notably through increase Rdh10, Aldh1a1, Crabp2
  in Sertoli cells and decrease Crabp1 in spermatogonia and thereby provide a robust
  paracrine factor necessary for induction of spermatogonia differentiation. In another
  hand, FSH induces components of signaling pathways regulated by RA signaling such
  as Sohlh1/2, Kit ligand, DMRT, BMP4 and NRGs along with transcription factors that
  are important for proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia and their meiotic
  entry. Exogenous and endogenous factors are represented in Sertoli and germ cells,
  respectively. Black arrows refer to retinol metabolism and RA signaling pathway.
  The succession of the various types of germ cells during the stages of VIII-IX seminiferous
  epithelium is represented between Sertoli cells: AS, undifferentiated type A spermatogonia;
  BS, differentiating type B spermatogonia; PS, pre-leptotene or primary spermatocytes;
  SS, secondary spermatocytes; ES, elongating spermatocytes. FSH, Follicle Stimulating
  Hormone, FSHR, Follicle Stimulating Hormone receptor; KL, Kit ligand ligand; DMRT,
