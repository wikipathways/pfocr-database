caption: Retinoic acid signaling pathway. Retinol travels in the bloodstream in association
  with RBP4. Retinol can enter the target cell handled by STRA6 (binds RBP4 with high
  affinity), or by membrane diffusion. Inside the cell, retinol travels in association
  with CRBP1. Retinol can be interconverted into Retinyl esters (cellular storage)
  by LRAT or be transformed into retinal by RDH/ADH enzymes. Afterwards, retinal is
  oxidized to retinoic acid by RALDH enzymes. CYP26 degradative enzymes tightly regulate
  the intracellular levels of retinoic acid. Retinoic acid can travel to the neighboring
  cells to act in a paracrine fashion or be transported to the nucleus bound to CRABP2.
  In the nucleus, retinoic acid interacts with RAR and RXR nuclear receptors, which
  form a heterodimer that recognizes RARE sequences in the promoter region of target
  genes, thus modulating transcription.
