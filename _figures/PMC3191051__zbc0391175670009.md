caption: Model for TGF-β1-mediated signaling to the miR143/145 regulatory region.
  A classical (SMAD4) and non-classical (p38MAPK) pathway of TGF-β1 signaling converge
  at a novel SBE and CArG box, respectively, to induce transcription of miR143/145,
  which subsequently leads to SMC differentiation marker expression in coordination
  with SRF/MYOCD. Experimental evidence reported here is depicted with solid lines,
  whereas hypothetical cross-talk between upstream signaling pathways or transcriptional
  complexes is indicated with dotted lines.
