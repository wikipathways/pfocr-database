caption: Infection with A2-O induced the expression of lignin biosynthetic genes.
  (A) Overview of the lignin biosynthesis pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase; HCT, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate
  p-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA
  O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. (B)
  Expression patterns of genes involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway whose expression
  was significantly up-regulated by infection with A2-J or A2-O (logFC ≥ 1, FDR ≤
  0.01). LogFC values of the genes compared to mock treatment at 1, 2, and 3 DPI are
  shown. The heatmap uses gray to indicate values with no statistically significant
  differences at | logFC| ≥ 1 and FDR ≤ 0.01.
