caption: Recurrent genetic alterations and targeted therapies under investigation
  in iCCA. Genetic alterations in tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream RAS/MAPK,
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR effector casades result in aberrant modulation of proliferation, apoptosis
  and cell cycle. Newly identified mutations in MAP3K4 lead to EMT process in iCCA
  through p38/NF-kB signaling pathway. Mutated IDH1/IDH2 result in the accumulation
  of oncogenic metabolite 2HG. Potential targeted therapies against the above alterations
  are currently under clinical trials. Recurrently mutated chromatin remodeling genes
  also present as druggable targets.
