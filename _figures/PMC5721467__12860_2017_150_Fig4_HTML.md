  Pathway Analysis on the proteome level. The “master regulators” of the analyzed
  dataset were predicted (blue and orange octagons), based on regulated proteins (green
  and red symbols indicate a fold change > |1.5| and a q-value <0.05) and literature
  data from the Ingenuity Knowledge Data Base. (a) TGF-β1, SMAD3, and RAC1 were the
  only upstream regulators predicted to be active, and (b) the estrogen receptor (group)
  was the only regulator predicted to be inhibited, when the full length syndecan-1
  was expressed. (c) Regulated proteins were predicted to lead to a set of downstream
  biological effects, all pertaining to cell viability. All predicted regulators had
  a Z-score (activation score) > |1.9|, and a Fisher’s exact p-value < 0.05. Dashed
  lines are indirect effects, and the shape of the protein indicates the protein class
  (defined by IPA). Magnitude of regulations: TGF-β1 (Z-score = 2.62, P-value = 1.42e-06),
  SMAD3 (Z-score = 1.98, P-value = 1.38e-06), RAC1 (Z-score = 1.96, P-value = 2.15e-04),
  and the estrogen receptor (group) (Z-score = −2.0, P-value = 2.54e-02); proliferation
  of leukemia cell lines (Z-score = −2.08, P-value = 4.59e-06), proliferation of pancreatic
  cancer cell lines (Z-score = −1.96, P-value = 3.38e-03), proliferation of smooth
  muscle cells (Z-score = −1.95, P-value = 5.27e-03); death of epithelial cells (Z-score = 1.99,
  P-value = 5.96e-04), and apoptosis of connective tissue cells (Z-score = 1.91, P-value = 1.01e-03)'
