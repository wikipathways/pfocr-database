caption: Model of RGS10’s role in modulating SNc DA neuron survival. TNFα, an inflammatory
  factor, can induce neuronal cell death through activation of the TNFR-Fas–associated
  protein with death domain (FADD)-caspase pathway. Cell culture studies suggest that
  PKA phosphorylated RGS10 directly promotes MN9D DA cell survival by potentiating
  PKA-mediated CREB activation and prosurvival gene (Bcl-2) expression. However, RGS10
  may also promote cell survival indirectly by inhibiting TNFR/TLR4 (LPS receptor)-NF-кB–mediated
  inflammatory factor (i.e., TNFα) expression by microglia, the brain’s resident immune
  cells. Whether acting directly or indirectly to promote DA cell survival, TNFα works
  to counteract RGS10’s positive effects by reducing its expression. This diagram
  depicts a microglial cell (tan) in close association with a DA neuron (blue) in
  the SNc. However, the role of RGS10 SNc DA neurons in vivo has yet to be directly
  examined. FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain; LPS, bacterial lipopolysaccharides;
  TLR4, toll-like receptor 4.
