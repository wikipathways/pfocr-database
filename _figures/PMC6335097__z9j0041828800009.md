caption: Simplified signaling pathway for vasopressin-mediated sodium-chloride cotransporter
  (NCC) regulation in distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells. Vasopressin stimulation
  of DCT cells activates the cAMP, Ca-calmodulin/CAMKK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) second-messenger pathways, which subsequently activate PKA, SGK1, and Akt
  kinases. Final major effectors of NCC activity are WNK/SPAK/OSR (which phosphorylate
  NCC) and NEDD4L (which ubiquitinates NCC). Solid black lines represent pathways
  supported by experimental results for NCC phosphorylation in the presence of specific
  kinase inhibitors. Dashed lines represent effectors deduced from experiments with
  other stimuli such as aldosterone. Solid black and dashed gray lines designate stimulatory
  phosphorylation of NCC, whereas red dashed lines denote inhibitory regulation of
  NEDD4L, resulting in increased abundance and overall activity of NCC. V2R, vasopressin
  receptor 2.
