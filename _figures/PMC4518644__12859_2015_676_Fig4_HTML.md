caption: 'Example of using “Inter-pathways” tool to query interactions between two
  pathways (left─syn00710: Carbon fixation; right─syn00480: glutathione metabolism).
  The interaction details between the two pathways show that RbcS protein [SPLC1_S240080]
  can interact with RbcL protein [SPLC1_S240060] and with slr0697-ortholog protein
  in glutathione metabolism. (The pathway image files were generated from KEGG’s Color
  Pathway tool by inputting our lists of differentially expressed proteins in each
  pathway)'
