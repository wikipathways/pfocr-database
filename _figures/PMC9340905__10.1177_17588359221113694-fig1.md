caption: Drivers of ET resistance can be broadly subdivided into two categories of
  (i) ER-dependent and (ii) ER-independent mechanisms. (a) Ligand binding domain Estrogen
  Receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations mediate ligand-independent ER signaling and promote
  ET resistance via constitutive ER activity, upregulated coactivator binding, and
  stability against proteolytic degradation; ER remains a viable therapeutic target
  in these tumors. ER-independent resistance may be mediated by several mechanisms
  including mutations or amplifications in growth factor-driven RTKs (HER2, EGFR,
  and FGFR), alterations in MAPK pathway components including KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1,
  and NF1, and upregulation in PI3K/AKT pathway signaling, though notably, PIK3CA
  and AKT mutations have not been shown to provoke resistance in the clinical setting.
  These alterations serve to upregulate mitogenic and survival signaling and promote
  cell cycle progression and drug resistance. (b) At the cellular level, depicted
  are select pathways implicated in response and resistance to ET in ESR1-mut and
  ESR1-wt metastatic breast cancer. Note, while ER-dependent and ER-independent pathways
  are largely depicted separately for conceptualization, there is considerable intracellular
  crosstalk between these pathways. Purple factors are involved in estrogen-dependent
  signaling. Green factors facilitate estrogen-independent, ER-mediated signaling.
  Red, orange, and pink factors engage in ER crosstalk, and dysregulation in mitogenic
  signaling pathway components can contribute to ER-independent tumor growth and SERD
  resistance.AKT, protein kinase B; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CoA, coactivator;
