caption: Mechanism of the time-dependent activation of Phox2a by cAMP signaling. Phosphorylation
  of Ser206 (the major phosphorylation site, depicted by filled circle), Ser202, and
  Ser208 indicates the inactive state of Phox2a. Activation of the cAMP pathway mediates
  the dephosphorylation of Ser206 via an OA-sensitive phosphatase. Active Phox2a binds
  to HD site 3 of the p27Kip1 promoter and induces p27Kip1 transcription. Upon complete
  dephosphorylation of Ser202, Ser206, and Ser208, Phox2a-mediated transcription is
  terminated via a PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Phox2a Ser153. This represents
  a novel mechanism of transcription factor activation by the cAMP pathway. The same
  signal determines the onset and duration of Phox2a-mediated transcription with a
  built-in time delay.

    Phosphorylation of Ser206 (the major phosphorylation site, depicted by filled

    of the cAMP pathway mediates the dephosphorylation of Ser206 via an OA-sensitive

    of Phox2a Ser153. This represents a novel mechanism of transcription factor activation
    by the cAMP pathway. The same signal determines the onset and duration of Phox2a-mediated
