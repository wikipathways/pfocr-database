caption: 'Main mechanisms of estrogen-induced apoptosis in Leydig and adrenocortical
  cancer cells. On the right side of the figure, the main transcriptional mechanisms
  mediated by ERs are indicated; on the left side, an illustration of how the apoptotic
  pathway (highlighted by the red outline) consequently activated is shown. GPER activation
  by G1 triggers a mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway in both LCT (1) and ACC
  (2) cells. In ACC (2), OHT, by ERβ upregulation, also increases the FasL expression
  and caspase 8 and 3 activation. The red arrows pointing up indicate activation and/or
  expression increase, while those pointing down indicate inhibition and/or expression
  decrease. See text for more details. P: phosphate group.'
