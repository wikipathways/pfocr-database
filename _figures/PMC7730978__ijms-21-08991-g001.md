caption: Gain of function (GOF) effect of mutant p53 and regulation of autophagy by
  p53 in nucleus. Certain p53 mutations (such as R248Q, R273H, R175H, and R249S) have
  shown GOF can further promote cancer malignance and chemoresistance. p53 mutants
  are able to actuate various survival signaling cascades, such as the NF-κB, PDGFRβ,
  mevalonate, proteasomal, or integrin pathways, and activate an independent set of
  target genes in cooperation with other transcription factors or cofactors (such
  as Pin1 and PML proteins). Nuclear p53 localization can promote autophagy by regulating
  the mTOR pathway in a transcription-dependent manner. Some p53 targeted genes, including
  PTEN, TSC2, and AMPKβ, have been reported to negatively regulate mTOR, thus promoting
  autophagy initiation. In addition, p53 can also be associated with autophagy through
  the ARF-signaling pathway. Regulation between p53 and the different functional forms
  of autophagy can contribute to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells.
