caption: Overview of principles and strategies for stable genetic engineering of cellular
  glycosylation capacities.A, overview of the 16 human glycosylation pathways with
  predicted assignments of 173 glycosyltransferase genes to the major biosynthetic
  steps using the rainbow display organization (, ). The rainbow depiction of glycosylation
  pathways illustrates the major biosynthetic steps organized into pathway-specific
  steps (right part with even colored according to the initial monosaccharide except
  for glycolipids) and pathway nonspecific steps (left part with toned colors) with
  predicted GT genes assigned. Note that this is a simplified scheme of pathways and
  GT genes are assigned only to the primary predicted functions. Genetic engineering
  of glycosylation requires considering the properties of individual enzymes and their
  potential effects on the cellular glycosylation pathways. Loss or gain of a GT may
  have highly specific effects or wider effects on multiple glycosylation pathways.
  Glycosylation steps covered exclusively by one unique enzyme (nonredundant steps),
  e.g., core α6-fucosylation of N-glycans by FUT8, yield highly specific and predictable
  outcomes with loss/gain engineering. Steps covered by multiple isoenzymes with overlapping
  functions (redundant steps) may or may not yield easily predictable outcomes, and
  the outcome may vary in cells dependent on the expression of such isoenzymes. Most
  steps in elongation and branching and capping are covered by partial redundancies
  by multiple isoenzymes. For example, sialylation by any of the four sialyltransferase
  subfamilies is covered by partial redundancies, and, e.g., combinatorial KO of three
  genes is required to selectively eliminate α3-sialylation on N-glycans (KO of ST3GAL3/4/6),
  while KO of two genes is required to selectively eliminate α3-sialylation of core1
  O-glycans (KO ST3GAL1/2). Glycan symbols are displayed in the Symbol Nomenclature
  for Glycans (SNFG) format (). B, graphic depiction of current nuclease-based gene-editing
  tools for knockout (KO) and knock-in (KI) of genes, and emerging CRISPR-based technologies

    Genetic engineering of glycosylation requires considering the properties of individual
    enzymes and their potential effects on the cellular glycosylation pathways. Loss
    or gain of a GT may have highly specific effects or wider effects on multiple
    glycosylation pathways. Glycosylation steps covered exclusively by one unique
    enzyme (nonredundant steps), e.g., core α6-fucosylation of N-glycans by FUT8,
    yield highly specific and predictable outcomes with loss/gain engineering. Steps
    covered by multiple isoenzymes with overlapping functions (redundant steps) may
    or may not yield easily predictable outcomes, and the outcome may vary in cells
    dependent on the expression of such isoenzymes. Most steps in elongation and branching
    and capping are covered by partial redundancies by multiple isoenzymes. For example,
    sialylation by any of the four sialyltransferase subfamilies is covered by partial
    redundancies, and, e.g., combinatorial KO of three genes is required to selectively
