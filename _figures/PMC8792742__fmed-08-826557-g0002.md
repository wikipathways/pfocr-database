caption: Inflammasome action in the lung vascular environment. Immune cells (such
  as macrophages) and non-immune cells (endothelial cells) can respond to stress,
  activate the inflammasome pathway and undergo pyroptosis. The release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines through the GSDMD pore, such as IL-1B, can propagate inflammation in neighboring
  cells by inducing their own transcription in a paracrine fashion. As such, the innate
  immune response can be amplified through the lung vasculature. In addition, these
  activated cells can (1) release other potent signaling molecules, such as HMGB1,
  into the environment following lytic cell death, (2) increase smooth muscle cell
  (SMC) proliferation in the medial layer of the vessel, and (3) release cytokines
  such as IL-6 that recruit other inflammatory cells to the vessel wall. Overall,
  this creates a vicious inflammatory cycle that, over time, contributes to the characteristic
  pulmonary vascular remodeling seen in PAH patients.
