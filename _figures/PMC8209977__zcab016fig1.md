caption: 'Germline mutations of HR genes in familial breast/ovarian cancers. (A) The
  HR molecular steps and HR factors affected in cancer. DNA double-strand break repair
  by HR can be summarized as follows: (1) Double-strand break (DSB) recognition and
  signalling by the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex) and ATM. (2) MRN and BRCA1 favour
  the initiation of the DNA ends generating 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs,
  which are covered and protected by RPA (not represented). (3) Then, BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2
  displace RPA and replace it with RAD51, forming the ssDNA/RAD51 filament. (4) Homology
  search and strand exchange. The ssDNA/RAD51 filament promotes the homology search
  and the invasion of a homologous sequence (red line), thus representing the commitment
  step of the HR pathway; the ssDNA/RAD51 filament is thus the active species of HR.
  The RAD51 paralogs, which are associated in two distinct complexes RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2
  [BCDX2] and RAD51C-XRCC3 [CX3], favour the assembly and the stabilization of the
  ssDNA/RAD51 filament and of the HR intermediates; they also can participate in the
  steps downstream of the homology search. The last step of HR (not represented) is
  the resolution of the HR intermediate created by the action of the ssDNA/RAD51 filament,
