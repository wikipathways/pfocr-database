caption: A proposed model for the role of TIGAR overexpression and the effect of inhibition
  of glutamine pathway in ESCC progression. TIGAR overexpression inhibits glycolysis
  but remodels glutamine pathway, which produces more anti-oxidants to protect cancer
  cells from reactive oxygen species killing and more energy to promote cancer cell
  proliferation and progression. Inhibiting glutamine pathway therefore might suppress
  the progression of ESCC with TIGAR overexpression.
