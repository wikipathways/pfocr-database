caption: A. MaxiK channel is present in mitochondria of cardiac and neuronal cells.
  However, its mechanism of translocation to mitochondria is not known. A hypothetical
  pathway is shown where TOM and TIM facilitate translocation of MaxiK channel to
  mitochondria. Since HSP60 immunoprecipitates with MaxiK channel, interacts with
  MaxiK channel in HEK293T and colocalizes with MaxiK channel in hippocampal primary
  neurons, it could be facilitating the refolding of MaxiK channel in the mitochondria.
  B. The interaction of MaxiK channel and GAT3 may indicate that MaxiK channel could
  be directly involved in GABAergic signaling. MaxiK channel and GAT3 are present
  in glia and their interaction could be playing a direct role in neuronal signaling.
