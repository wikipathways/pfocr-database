caption: 'A. In the absence of Hedgehog ligand (Hh), Patched (Patch) prevents Smoothened
  (Smo) from entering the primary cilium (PC), repressing Smo activity. This allows
  the sequential phosphorylation of Gli by several kinases: protein kinase A (PKA),
  glycogen synthase-3β(GSK3β) and casein kinase-1 (CK1). Phosphorylated Gli is susceptible
  for ubiquitination by Skip-Cullin-F-box (SCF) protein/β-Transducing repeat Containing
  Protein (TrCP), which primes Gli to limited degradation in the proteasome. Truncated
  Gli (Gli-R) acts as a repressor of gene transcription.B. When hedgehog binds to
  Patch, it removes Patch from the PC, allowing Smo to enter the PC. The complex Hh-Patch
  is degraded in vesicles in the cytoplasm. The entry of Smo into the PC allows Smo
  activation. Active Smo abrogates phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Gli.
  Full length Gli translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor
  for several target genes.Of note, Shh, Ihh and Dhh ligands similarly activate the
  Hh pathway. Gli-1 does not undergo proteasomal degradation, and in the absence of
  ligand, Gli-2 is preferentially completely degraded in the proteasome while Gli-3
  is partially degraded, and hence Gli-1 and Gli-2 act mostly as transcription promoters
  and Gli-3 can act as a transcription repressor.'
