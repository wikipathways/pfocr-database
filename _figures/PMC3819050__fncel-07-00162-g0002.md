caption: Wnt7a signals bi-directionally at vertebrate synapses. At hippocampal synapses,
  coordinated bidirectional Wnt7a signaling regulates synapse assembly, development
  and maintenance. In the axon, Wnt7a binds with Fz5 to activate a divergent-canonical
  pathway through Dvl1 and Gsk3β that promotes the recruitment of synaptic components,
  including SV and active zone proteins. In postsynaptic dendrites, Wnt7a promotes
  spine morphogenesis, PSD-95 recruitment and synaptic strength by signaling via Dvl1
  and CaMKII. The postsynaptic Wnt receptor has yet to be determined. Wnt5a signals
  postsynaptically to promote PSD95 clustering via JNK activation and GABAA receptor
  clustering via CaMKII. The postsynaptic Wnt5a receptor has yet to be identified.
