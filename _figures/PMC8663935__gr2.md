caption: 'The autophagy signaling pathway. Activation of autophagy machinery commonly
  occurs in specific conditions (e.g., nutrient deprivation, infection, or cellular
  extrinsic stress). Therefore, the autophagic pathway has been engaged in the pathological
  processes of many age-related diseases. The mTORC1 phosphorylation by Rheb occurs
  under nutrient-rich conditions, with the consequent inhibition of the autophagy
  initiators ULK1/2 and ATG13. The ULK1 serine/threonine kinase complex (ULK1, ULK2)
  acts downstream of the mTOR signaling. ULK1/2 forms a large complex with the scaffold
  proteins FIP200, ATG101, and ATG13. In mammalian cells, VPS34 forms two heterotetrameric
  core complexes known as Class III PI3K complexes I and II. Complex I is composed
  of VPS34, VPS15, Beclin 1, and ATG14L, whereas complex II has UVRAG instead of ATG14L.
  Whereas the Class III PI3K complex I is required for autophagy initiation, complex
  II promotes autophagosome maturation and endocytic trafficking. The elongation of
  the phagophore membrane is driven by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: the
  ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L conjugation system and the LC3-PE conjugation system. Eventually,
  autophagic vesicles transit towards lysosomes where cargo is degraded (steps 1 to
  5). 1: Phagophore formation; 2: Autophagosome formation and maturation; 3: Autophagosome
  fusion with lysosomes; 4: Autolysosome formation and maturation; and 5: Degradation
  and recycling of cellular components. Figure created with BioRender.com.'
