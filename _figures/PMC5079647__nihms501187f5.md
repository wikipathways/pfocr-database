caption: Oxidative stress intracellular signaling pathways in lung cancer. NRF2 (nuclear
  erythroid-2 related factor 2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression
  of genes encoding antioxidants and xenobiotic detoxification enzymes. The elevated
  levels of NRF2 have been shown to regulate cancer cell survival and potentially
  protect against chemotherapeutic agents. The mechanism that regulates increased
  NRF2 expression involves KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein) and ARE (antioxidant
  response element) expression. In the network, MGAT5 (Mannosyl (α-1,6-)-glycoprotein
  β-1,6,-N-accetyl-glucosaminyltransferase) gene encodes mannosyl (α-1,6-)-glycoprotein
  β-1,6-N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase, which regulates the synthesis of protein-bound
  oligosaccharides on the cell surface. Mgat5/N-glycan interaction is involved in
  cell-cycle progression (p53 pathway).
