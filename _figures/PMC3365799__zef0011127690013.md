caption: Major steroidogenic pathways in the three zones of the human adrenal cortex.
  The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by P450scc is common to all three
  zones. A, In the zona glomerulosa, 3βHSD2 converts pregnenolone to progesterone.
  P450c17 is absent, but P450c21 produces DOC, which is a substrate for P450c11AS.
  P450c11AS catalyzes 11-hydroxylation and two 18-oxygenations, which completes aldosterone
  synthesis. B, The zona fasciculata expresses P450c17, so pregnenolone is hydroxylated
  to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (or progesterone to 17-OHP), but the zona fasciculata
  contains little cytochrome b5, minimizing the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17, and
  little DHEA is produced. Instead, 3βHSD2 and P450c17 generate 17-OHP, the preferred
  substrate for P450c21, yielding 11-deoxycortisol. P450c11β, which is unique to the
  zona fasciculata, completes the synthesis of cortisol. Corticosterone is normally
  a minor product (dashed arrows) derived from a parallel pathway without the action
  of P450c17. C, The zona reticularis has large amounts of P450c17 and cytochrome
  b5 but little 3βHSD2, so that pregnenolone is sequentially oxidized to 17-hydroxypregnenolone
  and then DHEA. SULT2A1, using PAPS synthesized by PAPSS2 (see Section XVI), sulfates
  DHEA, and DHEAS is exported to the circulation. Testosterone synthesis is a very
  minor pathway (dashed arrows). [© R. J. Auchus.]
