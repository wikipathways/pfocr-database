caption: Transcriptional control through integrated Ca2+ signal transduction pathways.
  (A) In a resting cell, cytoplasmic Ca2+ is maintained at approximately 100 nM (blue)
  by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pumps (EP) and plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ pumps
  (PP). Ca2+ levels outside the cell and within the ER lumen and nuclear envelope
  (NE) are much higher, approximately 1 mM (yellow). Components of the Ca2+signaling
  pathway include tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR), phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCR), G protein q (Gq), phospholipase C-β (PLC-β), phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), InsP3 receptor (IP3R),
  STIM proteins (STIM), Orai channels (Or), calmodulin (CaM), calcineurin (CN), nuclear
  factor of activated T cells (NFAT1 and NFAT4) shown in their cytoplasmic, phosphorylated
  state. (B) A cell in which Ca2+ signals are induced by maximal levels of TKR or
  GPCR agonists, inducing PIP2 breakdown to release high levels of InsP3 which activates
  large pulsatile ER Ca2+ release through InsP3Rs, manifested as global Ca2+ oscillations
  that traverse the cytoplasm to activate cellular responses. The cytosolic Ca2+ pulses
  penetrate within the nucleoplasmic space through permeable nuclear envelope pores.
  Ca2+ release from ER, depletes luminal stored Ca2+ (grey shading). STIM proteins,
  widely distributed across ER in the resting state, become activated and translocate
  into ER-PM junctions where they contact the PM and expose an Orai channel binding
  domain that tethers and gates Orai channels to allow Ca2+ to enter the cytosol.
  The Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry provides highly localized Ca2+ signals (within a few
  nm of the PM; yellow shading). The entering Ca2+ binds to CaM and triggers CN association
  and activates CN phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates NFAT1 and NFAT4 exposing
  nuclear import signal sequences. The dephosphorylated NFAT1 and NFAT4 molecules
  enter the nucleus wherein they each target distinct arrays of genes. The continuation
  of Ca2+ signals induces retention of NFAT molecules in the nucleus and prolonged
  gene expression. (C) A cell in which submaximal levels of TKR or GPCR agonists induces
  modest InsP3 levels and smaller, less frequent pulses of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm.
  STIM and Orai proteins are still activated, albeit to a lower extent, and Ca2+ entry
  triggers NFAT1 and NFAT4 phosphorylation and nuclear import. Within the nucleus,
  the smaller pulsatile rises in Ca2+ are insufficient to retain NFAT4, but NFAT1
  remains activated in the nucleus despite the lower nucleoplasmic Ca2+. The lower
  nuclear Ca2+ may specifically trigger an increased rate of phosphorylation and faster
  export of NFAT4 from the nucleus compared to NFAT1. Since NFAT1 and NFAT4 target
  different genes, the pattern of transcription is tuned by both the Orai-mediated
  Ca2+ entry, and the frequency of Ca2+ pulses released from ER.
