caption: Multi-organ signaling pathways for maternally instigated diapause in female
  Ae. Albopictus. Environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature are sensed
  by the central brain and signal the fat body using (1) ILPs (insulin-like peptides)
  and (2) juvenile hormone released by the corpora allata (CA). ILPs bind to insulin
  receptor and activate FOXO pathway. Blood nutrients are digested by the midgut and
  the integration of environmental cue and blood-fed status trigger the release of
  vitellogenin and 20E signaling to the ovaries to alter reproduction in diapause
  state. 20E feedback to the fat body and is likely to affect juvenile hormone biosynthesis.
