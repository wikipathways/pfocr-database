caption: MicroRNA biogenesis pathway. miRNA genes are transcribed to produce primary
  miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase II and cleaved into precursor miRNA
  transcript (pre-miRNA) by the microprocessor complex Drosha-DGCR8 in the nucleus.
  The pre-miRNA is then exported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 where it is processed
  into miRNA duplex by Dicer and its interacting partner, TRBP. The miRNA duplex is
  then unwound into two single-stranded miRNAs. The functional strand of mature miRNA
  is uploaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and negatively regulates
  gene expression resulting in either target mRNA degradation or translation repression,
  while the passenger strand is degraded.
