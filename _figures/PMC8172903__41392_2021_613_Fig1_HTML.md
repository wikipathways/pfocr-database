caption: The CGAS-STING1 pathway. A critical cytosolic DNA sensor, CGAS elicits robust
  innate immune responses through the production of 2′3′-cGAMP, which binds and activates
  STING1 in response to DNA from pathogens or hosts. In addition, bacteria-produced
  CDNs can directly activate STING1 in a CGAS-independent manner. Activated STING1
  exits the ER membrane and travels to Golgi via the ERGIC, leading to the production
  of type I IFNs by activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. STING1 also activates NFKB1-dependent
  pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. CDNs cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides, cGAMP
