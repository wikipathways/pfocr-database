caption: Genetic landscape of DIPG. Here outlines a brief overview of the genetic
  landscape and molecular pathways of H3 K27M-mutant and non-mutant pediatric gliomas.
  The H3 K27M mutation can be divided into two particular genetic alterations—H3.3
  on the H3F3A gene and the H3.1 on the HIST1H3B gene. Of these, the H3.3 mutation
  is more commonly altered in H3 K27M-mutant pediatric gliomas. Enhancer of zeste
  homolog 2 (EZH2) is closely associated with H3 K27M-mutant gliomas leading to hypermethylation,
  increased mutant gene expression and tumor formation. The receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK) pathway is also closely associated with H3 K27M-mutant gliomas. They play
  an integral role in tumor development and cell proliferation via their affects primarily
  on platelet derived, epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Mutations
  within the WNT pathway lead to increased levels of β-catenin, causing an over proliferation
  of malignant cells and has shown to occur concurrently with the H3 K27M mutation
  in a preclinical murine model. Histone chaperone alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation
  syndrome X-linked (ATRX) has a high co-occurrence with H3 K27M-mutant gliomas and
  contributes to tumor development by destabilizing telomeres and altering gene expression
  at a molecular level. ACVR1 mutated gliomas are more prominently found with the
  H3.1 K27M mutation, leading to increased tumor proliferation via dysregulation of
  the BMP/SMAD pathway. This mutation tends to lead to tumor formation at an earlier
  age along with increased overall survival. TP53 alterations have been shown to occur
  in high frequency with the H3 K27M-mutation but are also present on H3 wild-type
  tumors. Abnormal TP53 function leads to increased DNA and protein instability causing
  decreased apoptosis and increased tumor development. Alterations to the MYCN and
  Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways occur more frequently in H3 wild-type tumors. MYCN
  alterations lead to overexpression of this transcriptional factor resulting in tumor
  formation via DNA hypermethylation and chromosomal rearrangement. Disturbances to
  the Hh pathway led to ventral pontine hyperplasia in a murine preclinical DIPG model
  and are proposed to play a role in tumor formation independently of the H3 K27M
  mutation. Enhancer of zeste homologs inhibitory protein (EZHIP) overexpression is
  present in the majority of H3 wild-type tumors and is characterized by the overexpression
  of the CXorf67 gene. This overexpression mimics the amino acid sequence present
  within H3 K27M-mutant gliomas, leading to global hypomethylation. Direct inhibitors
  of EZHIP have not yet been found but are currently being studied as a primary target
  for H3 wild-type gliomas. Image created with BioRender.
