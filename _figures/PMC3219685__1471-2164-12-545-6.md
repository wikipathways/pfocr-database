caption: 'Metabolic features of C. variabile DSM 44702 relevant for the lifestyle
  on the surface of smear-ripened cheeses and during cheese ripening. The selected
  metabolic and regulatory features were deduced from the annotation of the complete
  genome sequence. Processes and relevant proteins associated with central carbohydrate
  metabolism, lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism, proteolysis and amino acid uptake,
  iron acquisition, stress responses, food quality, as well as flavor generation are
  indicated and labeled. Relevant transport systems are shown within the cell membrane.
  Numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of paralogs present in the C. variabile
  DSM 44702 genome. Relevant transcription regulators are shown by grey circles and
  boxed according to the physiological module they play a regulatory role in. Abbreviations:
  GABA, γ-amino butyric acid; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.'
