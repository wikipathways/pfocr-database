caption: 'MiR-362-driven TGF-β/SMAD signaling modulation of cell migration and invasion:
  a proposed scheme. The scheme depicts the normal miR-362 negative regulation supported
  by data described in this work (A), and also a proposed mechanism of positive regulation
  of SMAD4 (B) in modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway and down-regulated expression
  of the EMT gene, SNAI1, and concurrently up-regulated expression of the MET gene,
  E-cadherin, leading to suppressed cell migration and invasion in vitro and cancer
  cell metastasis in vivo. See Discussion section for a full description of the scheme.
  Up- (green) and downward (red) pointing arrows indicate up- and down-regulation,
  respectively. Solid-line arrows and blunt-ends indicate activation and suppression,
  respectively, of the indicated events. The circled P denotes phosphorylation. Blue
  lines and arrows indicate predicted miR-362 targeting not further investigated in
  this work. In (B), the predicted BRK mRNA-miR-362-3p alignment shown at the top
  was derived by MicroT-CDS and that of DACH1 mRNA-miR-362-5p by Targetscan and MicroT4-CDS
  (see also Suppl.  for further details).'
