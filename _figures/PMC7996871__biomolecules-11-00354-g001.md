caption: Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Accumulated misfolded proteins
  in the ER cause ER stress, binding BiP and activating the UPR sensors, PERK, IRE1
  and ATF6. Activated PERK initiates in the short-term a pro-survival outcome by inhibiting
  protein translation (reducing ER protein load), activating ATF4-dependent transcription
  of pro-survival genes and a Nrf2-dependendent redox maintenance pathway. In the
  long term, if ER stress persists, there is activation of pro-apoptotic genes. Activated
  IRE1 (exemplified here by the prevalent form IRE1α) also induces pro-survival genes
  to increase protein folding and ERAD capacity. This is achieved through IRE1-dependent
  splicing of unspliced XBP1 mRNA (XBP1u) to a spliced form (XBP1s), which encodes
  an active transcription factor. Regulated IRE1 Dependent Decay (RIDD) degrades mRNAs
  encoding for secretory proteins, reducing the ER load. In this case, there is also
  activation of pro-apoptotic genes, if ER stress persists, via Jun-N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) phosphorylation and activation by a complex of IRE1α with TRAF2 and apoptotic-signaling
  kinase-1 (ASK1). Activated ATF6 is transported to the Golgi complex for cleavage
  by site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P, S2P) resulting in an active form released from
  the membrane, which traffics to the nucleus, inducing protein folding and ERAD genes.
