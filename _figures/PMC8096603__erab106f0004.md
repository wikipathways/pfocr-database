caption: 'Overview on developmental-related changes between different root stages
  inferred from differentially expressed genes in the KEGG pathway ‘Plant hormone
  signal transduction’ (green) and from published regulations and interactions (orange).
  Heat maps show the log2FC of genes that are differentially expressed in at least
  one comparison. Columns from left to right are: DSR38/NBR38, DSR60/NBR60, and DSR60/DSR38.
  Asterisks indicate a significant difference in expression, with |log2FC| ≥1 and
  FWER ≤0.05. Light colored rectangles represent players with no differentially expressed
  genes in expression.'
