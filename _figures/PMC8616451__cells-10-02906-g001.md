caption: Scheme of the signal pathway after MGPRX2 activation. MRGPRX2 ligands activate
  Gi protein, which induces a cAMP decrease, Ca2+ mobilization, and also activates
  MAPKs, PI3K, and NF-κB pathways, which lead to degranulation, induction of transcription,
  and production of prostaglandins. Balanced MRGPRX2 ligands not only activate Gi
  protein but also recruit β-arrestin to induce internalization, while biased MRGPRX2
  ligands cannot recruit β-arrestin. Additionally, IL-33 enhances MRGPRX2 signaling
  by activating MAPKs and NF-κB.
