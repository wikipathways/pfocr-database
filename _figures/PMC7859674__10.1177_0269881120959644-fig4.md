caption: Hypothesised monoamine and opioid mechanisms and potential convergences with
  signalling pathways implicated in the antidepressant actions of ketamine. (a) (R,S)-ketamine
  inhibits lateral habenula (LHb) bursting via actions on N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)/low
  voltage sensitive t-type channels (T-VSCC)/mu-opioid receptors (MOR). This results
  in disinhibition of monoamine release via γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons
  in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to projections
  including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Action
  of (R,S)-ketamine on NMDA/MOR on GABAergic interneurons in the DRN and VTA may be
  a further mechanism of disinhibition of 5-HT and dopamine release. 5-HT release
  in mPFC may also occur via α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
  (AMPA) receptor stimulation in DRN for (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine but might
  not be as relevant for (R)-ketamine. (b) Stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors
  via 5-HT in mPFC results in activation of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1) and potentially ERK signalling. Stimulation of postsynaptic D1 receptor
  via dopamine may result in activation of mTORC1/ERK and inactivation of eukaryotic
  elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase. Postsynaptic MOR activation may also potentiate
  the ERK signalling pathway.

  description: Hypothesised monoamine and opioid mechanisms and potential convergences
    with signalling pathways implicated in the antidepressant actions of ketamine.
    (a) (R,S)-ketamine inhibits lateral habenula (LHb) bursting via actions on N-Methyl-D-Aspartate
    (NMDA)/low voltage sensitive t-type channels (T-VSCC)/mu-opioid receptors (MOR).
    This results in disinhibition of monoamine release via γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic
    interneurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA)
    to projections including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens
    (NAcc). Action of (R,S)-ketamine on NMDA/MOR on GABAergic interneurons in the
    DRN and VTA may be a further mechanism of disinhibition of 5-HT and dopamine release.
