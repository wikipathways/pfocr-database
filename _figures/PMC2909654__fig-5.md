caption: Examples of human disease phenotype correlations in the absence of metabolite
  sharing but detected by flux correlations. (A) Porphyria includes a class of disorders
  related by mutations in the heme production pathway, which involves both mitochondrial
  and cytoplasmic reactions. Black arrows indicate conventional pathway flow, and
  gray text indicates the enzymes responsible for each transformation. Flux correlations
  and phenotype (OMIM) correlations are displayed in gray text for genes connected
  by dashed gray lines. The symbol “–” indicates that genes are absent from MimMiner.
  (B) The urea cycle also includes mitochondrial and cytoplasmic reactions. Mutations
  in the genes CPSI, OTC, ASS, and ASL give rise to diseases carbamoylphosphate synthetase
  I deficiency (CPSI deficiency), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency),
  citrullinemia type I, and argininosuccinic aciduria (ASL deficiency). Lines and
  text are as in panel A.
