caption: 'Mechanisms by which phthalates affected apoptosis. In different cells or
  tissues, the regulation of apoptosis exhibits variability: DBP inhibited fibroblast
  apoptosis by activating the PERK/eIF2α pathway; DBP enhanced apoptosis in the corpus
  cavernosum by modulating the Akt/Bax/caspase-3 pathway; and DEHP reduced apoptosis
  in the urethral epithelial cell by upregulating miR-494. (Solid arrows represent
  mechanisms that have been demonstrated in the included studies). Dashed arrows indicate
  that mechanisms were proposed but were not experimentally validated in the included
  studies. Diamond-shaped icons represent the mechanisms that have been validated
  in vitro experiment in the included studies)'
