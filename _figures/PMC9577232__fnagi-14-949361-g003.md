caption: Convergence of chronic stress intracellular signaling with Aβ42 and hyperphosphorylated
  tau neuropathology. The noradrenergic and CRF systems are engaged during stress
  and may contribute to neuronal degeneration when sustained over long periods of
  time. Adrenergic and CRF receptors are known to shift APP processing toward the
  amyloidogenic pathway by influencing the activity of beta and gamma secretases,
  BACE1 and PSEN, respectively. Increased production and secretion of Ab42 results
  in increased production of the neurotoxic Ab42 oligomers, known to incite nitric
  oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress. The beta-2 adrenergic receptor and CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) are both G-protein
  coupled receptors that engage stimulatory alpha subunits. Activation of these receptors
  results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), increased production of cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP), and activation of the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA).
  PKA can activate GSK3b signaling, resulting in the phosphorylation of tau at Alzheimer’s
  relevant sites. PKA can also elicit intracellular calcium increases that result
  in the recruitment of the calcium modulatory kinase II (CaMKII). Sustained elevations
  in Ca2+ signaling, however, results in the activation of additional downstream cell
  signal cascades, exacerbating the production and release of NO, ROS, caspases, and
  cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) from mitochondria. Cumulatively, this results in decreased
  efficiency in clearing proteins from the cell, increased inflammation and signals
  that induce apoptosis, contributing to neuronal degeneration.
