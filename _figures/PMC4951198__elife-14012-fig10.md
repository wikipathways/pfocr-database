caption: 'Compound BRAF/RAF1 ablation in keratinocytes induces an imbalance in MAPK
  signaling, resulting in low ERK, high JNK activation. This causes early inside-outside
  barrier defects accompanied by reduced CDN1 expression (yellow arrows), followed
  by a breakdown of the immunological barrier and local as well as systemic allergic
  inflammation akin to atopic dermatitis, characterized by the presence of Th2 cytokines
  in the epidermis. The phenotype can be prevented by inhibiting the JNK pathway in
  Δ/Δep2 animals and cells, and phenocopied by inhibiting the ERK pathway in Raf1Δ/Δep
  animals. Systemic effects (lymph node involvement, circulating IgEs) are separated
  from local effect by a dashed line. B (B cells), T (T cells), Mc (Mast cells), D
  (dendritic cells).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14012.020'
