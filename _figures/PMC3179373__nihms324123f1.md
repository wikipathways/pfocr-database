caption: The relationship between Ras-driven signaling pathways, ROS, Hsp90, and ER
  stress. Ras-driven proliferation requires ROS buffering of Ras-activated ERK1/2
  activity (1). ROS level is regulated in part by reduced glutathione (GSH), requiring
  sufficient NADPH generated by G6PD-mediated glucose oxidation via the pentose phosphate
  pathway (2). G6PD expression is regulated by mTOR, a component of a second Ras-driven
  signaling pathway that is inhibited by rapamycin (3). Hsp90 buffers cellular ROS
  and is essential for stabilization and activity of the ER transmembrane kinases
  PERK and IRE1, two components of the ER stress response machinery. The Hsp90 inhibitor
  IPI-504 causes ROS levels to increase while also abrogating the ER stress response
  (4). The combination of IPI-504 and rapamycin disrupts the balance between ROS and
  GSH, causing catastrophic ER stress and cell death.
