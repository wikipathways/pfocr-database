caption: 'Model for the CycD/Cdk4–mRpL12–Hph pathway. mRpL12 and Hph are required
  for CycD/Cdk4-stimulated growth, but not proliferation, suggesting that they function
  downstream of CycD/Cdk4. CycD/Cdk4 has a dual function: post-transcriptional regulation
  of Hph protein levels (), and induction of mitochondrial activity, which is dependent
  on mRpL12. Furthermore, Hph activity depends on mRpL12, hence may be regulated in
  response to mitochondrial activity. Hph hydroxylation activity is required for stimulation
  of growth and inhibition of the transcription factor Hif-1α/Sima, which is essential
  for the cellular response to hypoxia.'
