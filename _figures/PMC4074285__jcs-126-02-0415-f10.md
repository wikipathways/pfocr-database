caption: 'Model of the proposed role of cytochrome b reduction and specific mitophagy
  factors in the control of a general autophagic cellular response induced by mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Under strict respiratory conditions the treatment of yeast with a non-lethal
  concentration of certain inhibitors such as antimycin A and KCN leads to mitochondrial
  damage, which in turn induces nonspecific autophagy, though not mitophagy. In this
  setting, the induction of autophagy has two requirements. First, cytochrome b, a
  component of the respiratory chain, must be reduced to a sufficient degree. The
  use of other treatments, which only cause very slight reduction of cytochrome b
  (myxothiazol) or have no influence on reduction of cytochromne b (the combination
  of antimycin A or KCN, respectively, with hydrogen peroxide, CCCP or oligomycin)
  did not trigger autophagy. The second requirement for autophagy induction is that
  of some proteins involved in mitophagy: a key mitophagy component, the mitochondrial
  outer membrane protein, Atg32, which acts as a mitochondrial receptor; an adapter
  protein, Atg11, which directs receptor-bound cargo to the assembly site for packaging
  into vesicles followed by delivery into vacuoles; and Bck1 kinase, part of MAPK-signaling
  pathways required for regulation of mitophagy through phosphorylation of the Atg32
  protein. As a result, low or no autophagic activity was measured in strains deficient
  for genes that encode these proteins. We assume that the level of reduced cytochrome
  b could be just the first sign in the pathway leading to the induction of autophagy.
  There must be some molecules, mitochondrial, cytosolic, or both, which capture the
  signal and route it towards the three identified proteins. We also cannot neglect
  the possibility that the signal is transmitted simultaneously and directly to components
  controlling the nonspecific autophagic response in the cell.'
