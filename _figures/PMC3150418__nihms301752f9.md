caption: RANKL rapidly activates the classical (canonical) NF-κB pathway consisting
  of activation of the classic IKK complex (NEMO-IKK2), degradation of IκBα, and release
  of p50/p65(RelA) dimers for translocation to the nucleus. IL-4 did not influence
  this pathway. RANKL also more slowly activates the alternative NF-κB pathway consisting
  of activation of the alternative NIK-dependent IKK complex (IKK1-IKK1), partial
  cotranslational proteolysis of p100, generation of p52, and release of p52/RelB(orRelA)
  dimers for translocation to the nucleus. Intact p100 can function as an IκB (IκBδ)
  and retains p50/p65 and p52/RelB(A) dimers in the cytoplasm (). IL-4 altered the
  relative ratio of p100 to p52 in the cytoplasm, and prevented the RANKL-induced
  nuclear translocation of p52 and RelB. IL-4 treatment alone did not induce the rapid
  translocation of p50 or p65, and did not induce the slow translocation of p52 or
  RelB. However, IL-4 treatment did increase the amount of cytoplasmic p105 and p50
  after 48 hours and increased the amount of p50 in the nucleus. Based on EMSA data,
  IL-4 favored the formation of p50/p50 homodimers. The accumulation of p50 in the
  nucleus induced by IL-4 was dependent on NIK, while the increase in cytoplasmic
  p105/p50 was not. IL-4-induced macrophage fusion, known to be STAT6 dependent, was
  also dependent on NEMO-IKK2 and NIK, and was inhibited by p100. The mechanism(s)
  for this dependence is unknown, but could be due to processing of p105 by NEMO-IKK2
  to p50 and retention of p50/p50 in the cytoplasm by p100.
