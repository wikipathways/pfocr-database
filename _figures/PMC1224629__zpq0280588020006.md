caption: 'A general model for murine embryonic Nkx2-5 transcriptional regulation.
  Nkx2-5 is driven by two groups of enhancers: proximal and distal, both of which
  are downstream of the BMP-Smad signaling pathway. Earlier on, at the cardiac crescent
  stages, secreted BMPs from pharyngeal endoderm stimulate Nkx2-5 gene transcription
  by chromatin remodeling of the proximal enhancers G-S and AR2 in the cardiac crescent
  (CC) and are required for cardiac commitment and specification. The G-S enhancer
  is not active in later stages of heart formation, whereas AR2 provides RV expression.
  Later, during chamber specification, enriched BMP-Smad signaling may activate the
  distal enhancers, UH5 and UH6, that direct Nkx2-5 gene activity in the atria, ventricles,
  IVS, and AVC during chamberization.'
