caption: 'Schematic representation of how non-cancer-cell autonomous (microenvironmental)
  metabolites affect or protect against the development of CRC: (a) Dietary carbohydrates,
  such as butyrate, lead to hyperproliferation of the intestinal epithelium in a mouse
  model of intestinal cancer due to increased levels of β-catenin, which translocates
  into the nucleus and activates genes that promote proliferation. (b) Secondary bile
  acids and polyamines are products of cholesterol and protein metabolism, respectively.
  Bile acids activate the NF-κB pathway, which leads to induction of pro-inflammatory
  genes, while polyamines are responsible for activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and
  thereby increase cell proliferation. (c) Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate
  can have a tumor protective role. They enter the cell through its receptor GPR109A
  and promote the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and the priming of dendritic
  cells (DCs), which leads to differentiation into IL-10 producing Tregs, and thus
  to the amelioration of colitis. Butyrate also supports the tumor immunity derived
  from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), which enables the activation of the glycerophospholipid
  pathway, which in turn upregulates IL-2 and IFN-γ in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME) and thereby influences the effectiveness of ICB therapy. Outside of IECs,
  butyrate acts as an HDAC inhibitor in CD8+ T cells, maintains the activation of
  CD8-associated genes, and thus leads to an effective anti-tumor response. NF-κB:
  Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells; GPR109A: G-protein-coupled
  receptor 109A; Tregs: T regulatory cells. HDAC: Histone deacetylase. The reported
  oncometabolites are derived from food and microbial activities.'
