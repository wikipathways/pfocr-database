caption: Schematic diagram for molecular mechanisms of activation of ER stress. Accumulation
  of misfolded protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1 and cleavage
  of ATF6 to activate the UPR. This rapidly reduces the misfolded protein load through
  reversible translational attenuation and transcriptional induction of ER resident
  proteins to further assist protein folding and through induction of chaperones,
  ER biosynthetic machinery, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components. Chronic
  ER stress induces the apoptotic UPR which generates excessive levels of ROS, through
  the involvement of Ero1-Lα and-Lβ and PDI. Furthermore, the UPR releases Ca2+ from
  the ER to activate m-calpain and caspases. P-PERK phosphorylates eIF2α which further
  activates ATF4 and the CHOP-death pathway. P-PERK, PKC, PI3 kinase and MAP kinase
  phosphorylate Nrf2; the P-Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates into the
  nucleus to bind to the antioxidant response element (ARE), and this activates the
  transcription of more than 200 stress/antioxidant enzymatic genes such as glutathione,
  glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin-S-transferase, and catalase (see
  ). These stress/antioxidant enzymes regenerate reduced glutathione, and the resultant
  reduced glutathione eliminates ROS so the cell can survive and recover from the
  stress. Chronic UPR activates the death pathway and results in senescence or death.
