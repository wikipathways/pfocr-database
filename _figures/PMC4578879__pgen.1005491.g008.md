caption: Left panel. In the absence of ER stress, Ssk1 is inactivated through phosphorylation
  mediated by the upstream phosphorelay system. Right panel. In the presence of ER
  stress, increased expression of Ssk1 leads to accumulation of dephosphorylated Ssk1
  and consequent activation of the Hog1 MAPK cascade. ER stress also induces the activation
  of Snf1. Activated Snf1 downregulates the signaling from Ssk1 by inhibiting Ssk1
  expression.
