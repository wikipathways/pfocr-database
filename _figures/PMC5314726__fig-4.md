caption: Biochemical map showing metabolic perturbations in urine from a patient diagnosed
  with citrullinemia. Red circles indicate biochemicals with positive Z scores and
  blue circles indicate biochemicals with negative Z scores. The diameters of the
  circles indicate the magnitude of the Z score. Pink circles represent biochemicals
  with Z score of 1.5 ≤ Z < 2.0, and light blue circles represent biochemicals with
  −2.0 < Z ≤ −1.5. Black circles represent other biochemicals in the pathway detected
  in the urine sample, but had Z scores of −1.5 < Z < 1.5. Gray circles represent
  biochemicals in the library but not detected. White circles are biochemicals not
  detected on the mass spectrometry platform.
