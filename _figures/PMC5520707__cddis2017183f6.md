caption: Diagram of the inferred Cx32 anti-apoptotic mechanism. in vitro, Cx32 suppressed
  SN/CDDP-induced apoptosis only after GJ function was inhibited, either pharmacologically
  or physically. This suggests that upregulated expression of Cx32 per se has an anti-apoptotic
  effect, in contrast to its GJ-dependent pro-apoptotic effect, with exposure to these
  chemotherapeutic agents. Because of the upregulated Cx32 and its non-junctional
  localization in CaCx, the anti-apoptotic effect of Cx32 may dominate in cancer cells
  in vivo. Further, clinical-pathological data and in vitro findings indicate that
  the anti-apoptotic and tumor promoting effects involve the EGFR pathway in human
  CaCx cells. CDDP, Cisplatin; CaCx, cervical cancer; MT, mitochondria; SN, streptonigrin;
  TK, tyrosine kinase
