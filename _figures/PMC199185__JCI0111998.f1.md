caption: Proteins of the sarcomere, cytoskeleton, sarcolemma, and ECM of muscle, which
  are connected. Mutations in δ-sarcoglycan, dystrophin, actin, desmin, and lamin
  A/C are known to cause DCM. All of these genes also cause forms of skeletal myopathy
  when mutated. Mutations in any of the genes illustrated could potentially cause
  DCM and/or skeletal myopathy, forming the basis of the “final common pathway.” Signaling
  pathways (such as nNos) interacting with these proteins are likely to modify the
  phenotype.
