caption: Ca2+ waves activate transcription factor NFAT that in turn controls cell
  cycle. The changes in Ca2+ waves oscillation frequency can activate transcription
  factors such as transcription factor NFAT resulting in regulation of cellular transcription.
  Calcineurin plays a major role in the cell cycle progression through G1 and S phases
  by regulating CREB1 and the nuclear NFAT. In its inactive phosphorylated state,
  NFATs localizes in the cytoplasm, but following an increase in [Ca2+]i, the activated
  calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT which then translocates to the nucleus and regulates
  expression of its target genes. The influx of Ca2+ through plasma membrane channels
  such as the store-operated channel ORAI1 as well as efflux of Ca2+ from the ER can
  activate calcineurin and NFAT signaling pathway for inducing changes in cell cycle
  gene expression. Experiments using the “calcium clamp” have shown that the sensitivity
  of different transcription factors to [Ca2+]i oscillations is highly frequency dependent.
