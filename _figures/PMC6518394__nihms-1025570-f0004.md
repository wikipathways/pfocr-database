caption: Different 3-O-sulfated heparin sequences found in animals and produced chemoenzymatically.
  (1) A minimum sequence of heparin (pentasaccharide) involved in AT-binding. It has
  been proposed that the pentasaccharide is synthesized according to the classical
  biosynthetic pathway, in which the enzymatic events happen through a hierarchical
  sequence, as described by Lindahl, 1977. (2 and 3) Sequences present in heparin
  described in Lindahl, 1994. (4) Heparin sequence found in clams that does not correlate
  with affinity for AT. (5) Sequence described in shrimp L. vannameithat has negligible
  anticoagulant activity despite its high affinity for AT and unusually higher proportion
  of 3-O-sulfated residues. (6 and 7) Scheme for 3-O-sulfated heparin sequences described
  by this study. The starting material for chemical modifications was porcine intestinal
  mucosa heparin, the schemes show iduronate rather than glucuronate once heparin
  does have significant higher proportions of iduronate. (8 and 9) Different oligosaccharide
  substrates required by HS3ST isoforms. While HS3ST3 must precede the 6-O-sulfation
  to generate the I2S-ANS3S6S, HS3ST1 can only work after the 6-O-sulfation step.
