caption: 'The mechanism of action for MSC-Mito therapy in conjunction with PQQ in
  chemotherapy-induced POI is as follows: PQQ facilitates MSC-Mito proliferation in
  cells and, in synergy with MSC-Mito, mitigates the elevated ROS levels induced by
  chemotherapy, thereby reducing mitochondrial damage. Simultaneously, this enhances
  the expression of SIRT1, upregulates TERF2 to promote DNA damage repair, suppresses
  ATM/p53 pathway activation, and reduces cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, SIRT1 upregulates
  PGC-1α, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis'
