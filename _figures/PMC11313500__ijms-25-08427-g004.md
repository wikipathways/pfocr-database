caption: Clinical treatments and immunotherapy for targeting PAH. At present, the
  main clinical therapy of PAH is through ET-1, prostacyline, and NO-cyclic guanosine
  phosphate (cGMP) pathways, mediating vasodilation and resisting proliferation to
  achieve therapeutic attainment. ET-1 plays a vasoconstriction role by binding endothelin
  receptor type A and B (ETA and ETB) on PASMCs, which are inhibited by endothelin
  receptor antagonists. Because of the vasodilating function of prostacycline (PGI2),
  prostacycline analogs and prostacycline receptor agonists have been developed to
  alleviate PAH symptoms. The relaxation effect of NO in PASMC is realized by increasing
  the level of cGMP through activating guanylate cyclase (GC). On account of inhibiting
  the degradation of cGMP via phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), PDE5 inhibitors have
  been applied clinically in PAH patients. Immunotherapy shows a promising prospect
  for PAH treatment, with the vital impact of inflammation in pulmonary vascular dysfunction
  gradually revealed. Over the years, diverse approaches have been developed to effectively
  treat this disease, based on the immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, and related
  signaling pathways. These therapies mainly include inhibitors for immune cells and
  inflammatory mediators, cytokine receptor antagonists, anti-immune cell monoclonal
  antibodies, depletion therapy for immune cells, macrophage polarization regulation,
  and targeting inflammatory pathways like JAK-STAT signaling
