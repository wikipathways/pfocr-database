caption: 'Dynamics of activation signaling in NK cells in contact with cancer and
  stressed cells. Activation signaling from Slam family 2B4, NTB-A, and CRACC. Upon
  ITSM phosphorylation, following ligand binding, an activation signal can be generated
  depending on the recruitment of EAT-2 and SLAM-associated protein (SAP), thereby
  blocking the binding site of lipid phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. SAP recruits the
  Src-family kinase Fyn, leading to downstream PLCγ1, PLCγ2, and PI3K signaling. 2B4
  can also recruit after phosphorylation, another adapter protein 3BP2, which activates
  VAV1 and ERK pathway upon phosphorylation. DNAM-1 engaged with ligand PVR or nectin-2
  is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src kinases. This phosphorylation enables the binding
  of adapter Grb2 to DNAM-1, leading to VAV1, PI3K, SLP-76, and PLCγ1 activation,
  thereby increasing calcium fluxes and activating ERK and AKT pathways leading to
  FOXO1 degradation. DNAM-1 activating signal has a synergetic effect with LFA-1,
  to which it can be associated physically to induce tyrosine kinase Fyn to phosphorylate
  DNAM-1. NKG2D associates with adapter DAP10 after binding to ligand UL16-binding
  proteins (ULBP)1–6 and to ligands MICA and MICB, whose expression is regulated by
  the heat shock stress pathway or by DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
  NKG2D activation is triggered upon ligand engagement, leading to assembly with adapter
  DAP10 and phosphorylation of its motif followed by recruitment of PI3K, growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), VAV1, SLP-76, GTPase Rac1-dependent actin cytoskeleton
  rearrangement, thereby leading to MAPK signaling pathway activation and Pak1–Mek–Erk
  cascade signaling pathway. This culminates in granule polarization, calcium influx,
  cytokine production, synapse formation, and clustering of receptors. A parallel
  activation pathway triggered by PI3K is the AKT/mTOR pathway activation. NCR activation
  and killing depend on Src and Syk kinase activities. Engagement of NCRs with their
  cognate ligands induces associations with adapter CD3ζ, FCRγ or DAP12 whose ITAMs
  are phosphorylated by members of the Src kinase family: Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Fgr, Src,
  and Yes. The phosphorylated ITAMs will then attract and activate the tyrosine kinases
  Syk and ZAP70. These kinases will then phosphorylate other adapters, such as LAT,
  to recruit more downstream adapters and signaling complexes, such as PLCγ and PI3K,
  VAV1/2/3. Under PLCγ, Ca2+ influx increases, and PI3K will recruit p85, leading
  to phosphorylation of AKT and VAV1, which promotes GTPase Rac1-dependent actin cytoskeleton
  rearrangement, thereby activating the MAPK signaling pathway, leading to the Pac1–Mek–Erk
  cascade signaling pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway triggers a parallel activation
  pathway. CD16 is the only receptor in NK cells that can trigger alone and with the
  homodimer of adapters CD3ζ or FCRγ, an effective activation signal mediating antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Only CD16 activation can lead to phosphorylation of
  both tyrosines (Y128) and tyrosine (Y113) on SLP-76. This double phosphorylation
  allows the binding of two VAV1 and more robust downstream signaling. Complexed Crk
  is required for CD16 signaling and the movement of microclusters of CD16 ligands
  on the lipid bilayer'
