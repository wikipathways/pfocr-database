caption: 'The schematic diagram of complement activation pathway in our patients.
  Three pathways of complement activation exist: the classical, mannose-binding lectin
  (MBL), and alternative pathways. Activation of the classical pathway and the lectin
  pathway can cleave and activate C4 and C2 to form C4bC2a, which subsequently results
  in the formation of C4d. Activation of any of the three pathways leads to activation
  of C3, which generates C3a and C3b. Furthermore, C3b can generate C3c and C3d. The
  absence of C4 deposition in our patients suggests that both the classical and lectin
  complement pathways are not involved. On the contrary, the presence of FB, C3c,
  and C3d deposits demonstrates that the alternative complement pathway is activated
  in our patients.'
