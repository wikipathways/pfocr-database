caption: 'Therapeutic targets of biologics and small molecules indicated for IBD management.
  Biologics and small molecules help in managing IBD by interfering with inflammatory
  cascades by: inhibiting lymphocyte trafficking and reducing inflammation by modulating
  Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR), Inhibiting inflammatory cell recruitment
  by blocking α4β7 integrin or MAdCAM receptor, blocking several pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-12 or/and IL-23, or inhibiting many cytokine pathways
  through blocking Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway. Created with BioRender'
