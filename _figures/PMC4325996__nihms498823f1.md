caption: During energy deficit, including dietary restriction, an overall decrease
  of glucose utilization is accompanied by a switch to alternative fuels, predominantly
  fatty acids. Molecular evidence of this switch has been observed in VMH and liver,
  and probably occurs in most other tissues as well. Evidence for this switch includes
  the induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdk), which disconnects glycolysis from
  the Krebs cycle; instead pyruvate is converted to lactate at the expense of NADH.
  On the other hand, fatty acid catabolism is promoted, as suggested by fatty acid
  transporters into the cell (Fatp) and the mitochondria (Cpt1a). Accordingly, this
  switch also includes an activation of the Ppar family, transcription factors whose
  main physiological function is to effect this metabolic switch. A major physiological
  effect of reducing glycolysis and increasing fatty acid oxidation is the reduction
  of oxidative stress. First, glucose shunted through the pentose pathway results
  in a major production of anti-oxidative NADPH, which is also increased in the Krebs
  cycle during energy deficit by NADP-dependent Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity.
  Second, an overall reduction of NADH is sequential to reduced glycolysis, decreasing
  radical-producing complex I activity while favoring complex II, which does not produce
  free radicals. Other effects of this metabolic switch are to increase protein and
  lipid turnover, thus reducing the presence of oxidized macromolecules.
