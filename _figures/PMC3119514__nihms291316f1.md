caption: 'Key components of NF-κB signaling pathways. Color-coding of molecules: activators
  = yellow, NF-κB subunits = blue, inhibitors = red, degradators = green, nuclear
  function = cream. Canonical pathway: Binding of extracellular signaling molecules
  to receptors leads to recruitment of activation proteins, phosphorylation of IKKβ,
  activation of the IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO), and processing of p105 and
  p100 into functional p50 and p52 by the ubiquitin ligase SCFβ-TrCP complex. Activated
  IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, marking it for ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP complex
  and degradation. The main canonical NF-κB dimer, p65/p50, is activated and translocates
  to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription with the RNA polymerase II preinitiation
  complex (PIC). Non-canonical pathway: Ligase and receptor coupling leads to NIK
  and IKKα activation, which initiates processing of p100 into functional p52 by the
  SCFβ-TrCP complex. The p52/Rel-B dimer translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene
  expression through the RNA polymerase II PIC'
