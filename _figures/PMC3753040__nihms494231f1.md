caption: 1) The FANCD2 and FANCI proteins are phosphorylated on multiple amino acid
  residues in response to a DNA crosslink. 2) The phosphorylated FANCD2 and FANCI
  proteins are monoubiquitinated by the FA core complex, containing of the FANCA,
  FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL and FANCM protein subunits. FANCL is the
  E3 ligase subunit. 3) [SC16]In the absence of genotoxic stress FANCD2 and FANCI
  are deubiquitinated by the USP1/UAF1 complex to prevent the accumulation of monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2 and FANCI. In response to DNA damage, the level of USP1/UAF1 complex decreases,
  resulting in the cellular increase in ubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI. 4) Monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2 and FANCI translocate to sites of damage on the chromatin, putatively with
  the help of a recruitment protein X. On chromatin the proteins assemble around the
  site of damage together with other FA proteins, including FANCD1(BRCA2), FANCN(PALB2)
  and FANCJ(BRIP1,BACH1). 5) The assembled FA DNA repair complex repairs the DNA damage
  in conjunction with other DNA repair proteins. 6) Once the repair process has been
  completed, FANCD2 and FANCI are deubiquitinated by the USP1/UAF1 complex, resulting
  in a disassembly of the FA DNA repair complex and dissociation from the chromatin.
