caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The activation of the
  extrinsic pathway involves binding of an external ligand to a transmembrane Death
  Receptor which then induces its conformation as a homotrimer. In the internal part
  of the receptor, the exposed Death Domain (DD) recruit adaptor proteins such as
  TRADD. Through its Death Effector Domain (DED), TRADD can then recruit pro-Caspase-8
  which is activated through self-proteolysis. Subsequently the death ligand, receptor,
  TRADD molecule and caspase-8 form the DISC complex. Active caspase-8 can cleave
  downstream effector caspases 3, 6 and 7 which degrade nuclear lamins and other cellular
  components. Caspase-8 connects the extrinsic pathway with intrinsic or mitochondrial
  apoptotic signaling, though the cleavage of Bid to truncated Bid (t-Bid). Bid, a
  member of the Bcl-2 family, facilitates the opening of mitochondrial pores in a
  process called MOMP by inducing the polymerization of Bax on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. MOMP is also induced by internal signals, such as extensive DNA damage.
  Cytochrome-c (cyt-c) is released from mitochondria and along with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9
  form the apoptosome heptamer structure. Following proteolysis, caspase-9 cleaves
  and activates effector caspases, further amplifying the apoptotic process. Apoptotic
  Protease Activating Factor 1 (APAF-1); Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization
  (MOMP); TNFR1-Associated Death Domain protein, (TRADD).
