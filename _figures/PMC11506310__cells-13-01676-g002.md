caption: Non-canonical TRAIL signaling pathway. Upon binding of TRAIL to its receptors,
  a secondary cytosolic complex is formed, consisting of FADD and caspase-8, which
  interact with RIPK1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2),
  and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) essential
  modifier (NEMO). TRAF2 recruits cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1/2 (cIAP1/2)
  and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which attaches linear polyubiquitin
  chains to RIPK1. These complexes activate NF-κB, p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK pathways.
  LUBAC is present in both complexes and aids in recruiting the IKK complex, leading
  to NF-κB activation. RIPK1 also triggers the activation of tyrosine-protein kinase
  SRC and STAT3, promoting cell invasion and migration. For a description of necroptosis,
