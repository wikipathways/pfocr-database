caption: Mechanisms of GSNOR-inhibitors mediated rescue of F508del-CFTR to the PM.
  Molecular chaperones such as Hsp70Hsp90 organizing protein (HOP) regulate CFTR biogenesis
  and proper trafficking to the PM. In the ER, association of HOP with F508del-CFTR
  leads to its degradation via the ER-associated proteasomal pathway. S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO), a cellular nitric oxide (NO) donor, modulates the function of HOP by its
  S-nitrosation. In the absence of a functional CFTR, cellular GSNO levels are low,
  which results in decreased S-nitrosation of HOP, which promotes proteasome mediated
  degradation of F508del-CFTR. The cellular levels of GSNO are tightly regulated by
  the enzyme, GSNO-reductase (GSNOR), which mediates the catabolism of GSNO. Pharmacological
  inhibition of GSNOR using N6022 or N91115 increases GSNO levels that leads to increased
  S-nitrosation of HOP. It is believed that an increase in HOP S-nitrosation hampers
  its association with F508del-CFTR, thereby allowing the forward trafficking and
  maturation of F508del-CFTR. Moreover, recent studies from our group also indicate
  that GSNO augmentation using N6022 can control the elevated ROS levels and thus
  correct the ROS-mediated autophagy flux impairment in CF.
