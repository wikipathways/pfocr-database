caption: 'In ECs, androgen diffuses into the cell directly activating a cascade of
  signaling creatine kinase and MAPK. The AR ligand may upregulate VEGF and cyclins
  through the genomic pathway. Androgen may also induce eNOS synthesis. In EPC, androgens
  may either upregulate VEGF and mitotic cyclins or increase the expression of MMP-9
  and NO in the cytoplasm. Androgen activates a cascade of signaling resulting in
  increased NO and VEGF. AR: androgen receptor; CK: creatine kinase; EC: endothelial
  cells; EPC: endothelial projenitor cells; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2; eNOs: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Gi: inhibitory regulative G-protein;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; MMP9: matrix metallopeptidase 9; NOs: nitric
  oxide synthase; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.'
