caption: 'Potential signaling mechanisms involved in CFH-mediated endothelial injury.
  Though the entirety of the precise signaling mechanisms contributing to endothelial
  injury is yet to be elucidated, multiple pathways have been implicated. A: CFH causes
  increased ROS that lead to activation of NLRP3 signaling and activation of IL-1β,
  as well as degranulation of WPBs. Protective cellular mechanisms activated by CFH
  include HO-1, HIF, and FHC to counter oxidative stress. B: endothelial activation
  in response to CFH signals through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway leading to activation
  of MAPKs, NF-κB and complement signaling, upregulation of adhesion molecules, and
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; PAR-1 activation by CFH-mediated upregulation
  of the TF signaling cascade leads to increased coagulation signaling (including
  increased VWF and P-selectin). C: endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by CFH
  or its components is characterized by disruption of cell-cell junctions (adherens
  junctions and tight junctions) and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (stress
  fiber formation); signaling mechanisms that may be involved include upregulation
  of MAPKs, Src, Rho, MMPs, and pMLC signaling. Many of these signaling pathways are
  complex and overlapping. Of note, some studies show that TLR4/MAPK/NLRP3 signaling
  was not required in CFH-mediated endothelial injury; the precise signaling mechanisms
  involved most likely depend on context and require further investigation. CFH, circulating
