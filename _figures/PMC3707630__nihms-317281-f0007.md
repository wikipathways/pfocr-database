caption: Model of MIF Signal Transduction Involving MIF Binding to CD74 and Activation
  of the CD44 CoreceptorThe pathway leading from the CD44 intracytoplasmic domain
  through c-Src and toward the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
  has been described (; ). The pathway downstream of Ras has been described (; ),
  and  recently reported a role for the Ras effector, RhoGTPase, acting via myosin
  light chain kinase (MLCK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in the induction of sustained
  phase, MIF-mediated ERK activation.
