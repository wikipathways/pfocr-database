caption: Potential mechanisms of malignant transformation by K+ channels. Increased
  expression of K+ channels on cell membrane results in increased influx of Ca2+ ions
  resulting in increased transition of cells through G1/S phase of cell cycle. The
  channels in presence of hypoxia lead to release of HIF1 and VGEF factor leading
  to increased angiogenesis and subsequent invasion and metastasis of tumours. The
  nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) in the C terminus on activation results in perinuclear
  localisation of the channel leading to activation of Mitogen activated protein kinase
  (MARP) pathway resulting in increased cell proliferation. The Eag channels also
  act through the Ca calmodulin pathway to activate cell proliferation.
