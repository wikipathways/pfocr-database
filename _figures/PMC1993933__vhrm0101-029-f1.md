caption: 'The mevalonate pathway. By inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) reductase, statins interfere with the synthesis not only of cholesterol
  but also of isoprenoid intermediates, such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (PP),
  which contribute to oxidative stress and cellular proliferation and migration. Inhibition
  of these isoprenoid intermediates may contribute to the pleiotropic effects of statin
  therapy. Abbreviations: FFP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate;
  IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate.'
