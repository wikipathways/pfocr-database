caption: Prostaglandins are synthesized from Arachidonic acid and this is catalyzed
  by the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2. The intermediate PGH2 gives rise
  to PGD2, PGE2, PGF2, PGI2 and TXA2 via specific terminal synthases. PGE2 is the
  form of prostaglandin that is associated with inflammation, tumor growth and angiogenesis.
  PGE2 is degraded by the enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (pgdh). Tumors
  and their associated stroma secrete a number of angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth
  factors that act on blood and lymphatic vessels to promote cancer. Members of the
  VEGF family of growth factors, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, are secreted by tumors and act
  on small lymphatic vessels in and around the primary tumor, as well as on larger
  collecting lymphatic vessels which carry metastatic tumor cells from the primary
  tumor to regional lymph nodes. VEGF-D has been shown to cause dilation of collecting
  lymphatic vessels via down-regulation of the pgdh gene leading to increased metastasis.
  This results in reduced PGE2 degradation causing dilation of collecting lymphatic
  vessels expressing appropriate PGE2 receptors. VEGF-C has been reported to induce
  expression of COX-2 and vice versa. Therapeutically, this can be inhibited by antagonists
  of the COX pathway, which can reduce the amount of PGE2 being synthesized. Members
  of the NSAID family, such as Aspirin, can antagonize COX-mediated production of
  PGE2.
