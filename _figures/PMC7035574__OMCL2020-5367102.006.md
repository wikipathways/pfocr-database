caption: A proposed pathway for PUVA-induced ROS generation and its biological impacts.
  PUVA or similar chemotherapy drugs can induce DNA ICL especially in the telomere
  region. Owing to the high needs for energy and dNTP for DNA synthesis during DNA
  repair, the PPP was stimulated leading to imbalanced NADPH/NADP+ which then upregulated
  the expression and activity of NOX as well as mitochondrial biogenesis, causing
  persistent elevation of endogenous ROS level. The generated ROS caused telomere
  erosion and might affect adjacent cells and tissues through SASP mechanism, therefore
  contributing to the occurrence of premature aging.
