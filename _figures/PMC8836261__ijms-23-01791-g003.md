caption: Transcriptional activation mechanism for Rlm1-dependent genes. Under cell
  wall stress conditions, activated Slt2 phosphorylates Rlm1. Rlm1 interacts with
  SWI/SNF and probably the SAGA complexes to direct both to the promoters of CWI responsive
  genes. Upon recruitment, SAGA acetylates histone H3 and cooperates with SWI/SNF
  to locally alter nucleosome positioning at the MLP1 promoter, facilitating the binding
  of Rlm1 to its binding sites, previously occluded by positioned nucleosomes, in
  a two-step mechanism. Slt2, also attached to the DNA, interacts with RNA Pol II
  traveling along the coding region during transcriptional elongation. During elongation,
  ubiquitination of H2B by Rad6 at the coding region is necessary for H2B displacement
  in response to stress. The ubiquitin protease Ubp8 regulates deubiquitination of
  H2B and is recruited to the coding regions of CWI-responsive genes for maintaining
  appropriate levels of H2B ubiquitination.
