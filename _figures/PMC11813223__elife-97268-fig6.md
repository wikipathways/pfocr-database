caption: The establishment of a Notch activation pattern by mechanical cues involves
  a series of events in the developing heart tube. At E8.5, the arterial endothelium
  and non-EMT endocardium exhibit low shear stress, high VEGF, Dll4, and Notch signaling.
  One day later, the endocardium undergoes patterning and becomes capable of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) only in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and proximal outflow tract
  (OFT) regions. This patterning is achieved through restricted expression of BMP2
  and NICD in these specific areas. EMT requires the downregulation of VEGF signaling
  by the endocardium, enabling EMT to occur. Additionally, Dll4 is downregulated in
  the endocardium to prevent widespread Notch activation. Simultaneously, the high
  shear stress present in the AVC and proximal OFT regions leads to increased membrane
  lipid order, which activates the mTORC2-PKC-Notch pathway and promotes EMT. On the
  other hand, regions flanking these valve-forming areas experience lower shear stress,
  resulting in inactive Notch signaling and an inability to undergo EMT
