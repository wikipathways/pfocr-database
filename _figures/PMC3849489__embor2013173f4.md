caption: CAND1 as a substrate receptor exchange factor. (A) Pathways for activation,
  SR exchange and deneddylation of CRLs. This model is based on the proposed role
  for CAND1 as an SR exchange factor [], the role of the CSN complex as both a catalytic
  and binding-dependent inhibitor of CRLs, the action of which can be reversed by
  substrate [,,], and the stoichiometries of the various components in vivo []. The
  model initiates with empty cullin (step 1), formed, for example, by new synthesis.
  This empty cullin could be engaged by a newly synthesized SR1 module (step 2) or
  potentially integrated into a CAND1 complex for exchange (not shown for clarity).
  The basal CRL complex could either enter into a CAND1-dependent exchange cycle (step
  3) or could become rapidly neddylated and engage substrates (steps 4 and 5). As
  substrate abundance is diminished, CRLs can associate with CSN, and become deneddylated
  (step 6), followed by dissociation of the CRL complex to re-enter the cycle. The
  CAND1-exchange pathway leads to dissociation of SR1 and association of SR2 (either
  a pre-existing or newly synthesized module) through a proposed intermediate in which
  CAND1 and SR2 associate simultaneously with the cullin complex (step 3). Exchange
  of SR1 for SR2 would change which substrates are targeted in the cell. (B) Structure
  depicting how the β-hairpin of CAND1 (red) bound to CUL1 (green) clashes with SKP1
  (blue), based on superimposing CUL1–RBX1–CAND1 and CUL1–RBX1–SKP1–SKP2F-box structures
  [,]. The arrow denotes the location of the β-hairpin in CAND1. Some residues of
  SKP1 that are absent in the crystal structure might further clash with CAND1. CRL,
  cullin–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase; SR, substrate receptor.
