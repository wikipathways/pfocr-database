caption: 'The role of S-prenylation within the TME. Key pathways and molecules influenced
  by S-prenylation are summarized. 1. RAS pathway: S-prenylation of Ras (rat sarcoma
  viral oncogene homolog) proteins initiates the Ras signaling cascade by promoting
  GDP–GTP exchange, enabling Ras translocation to the membrane, activation of the
  Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway, and facilitating the interaction
  between KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and PI3 K (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase), which activates the PI3 K pathway, regulating modulating excessive inflammatory
  responses. 2. Rheb-mTORC1: S-prenylation of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain)
  localizes it to the lysosomal surface, where it activates mTORC1 (mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1). Upstream, AKT (protein kinase B) inhibits TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous
  sclerosis complex 1/2), preventing Rheb suppression and sustaining mTORC1 signaling,
  which activates S6 K (ribosomal protein S6 kinase) and 4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1), promoting protein synthesis and tumor metabolism.
  3. Hippo Pathway: S-prenylation of RhoA (Ras homolog family member A) activates
  YAP/TAZ (yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif)
  by inhibiting LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2), driving oncogenic TEAD/YAP
  (TEA domain transcription factor-YAP) transcription. Moreover, RhoA indirectly hyperactivates
  RhoA/ROCK1 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1)/actomyosin mechano-signaling
  to promote oncogenic TEAD/YAP transcription further. 4. Rac1: Inhibition of Rac1
  (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) geranylgeranylation triggers exposure
  of damaged filaments, recognized by CLEC9 A (C-type lectin domain family 9 A) on
  cDC1 s (conventional dendritic cells type 1), and cross-presentation to activate
  CD8⁺ T cells. 5. TCR (T-cell receptor): S-prenylation localizes CRACR2 A (calcium
  release-activated channel regulator 2 A) to the Golgi, regulating calcium influx,
  JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) signaling, and vesicle transport, enhancing TCR activation
  and immune synapse formation. 6. ZAP (zinc-finger antiviral protein): Farnesylation
  of ZAP long isoform targets endolysosomes, facilitating viral RNA degradation and
  innate immunity. 4EBP1: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein
