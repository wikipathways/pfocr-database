caption: ‘A’- to ‘T’-UPR conversions may promote β-cell death in diabetes. During
  ER stress, adaptive UPR outputs maintain cellular homeostasis. If ER stress remains
  unmitigated, terminal UPR signaling drives destructive outputs culminating in β-cell
  apoptosis. Declining β-cell mass elevates workload/ER stress in remaining β-cells
  in vicious cycles promoting diabetes. These principles may be a unifying feature
  in monogenetic and polygenetic forms of diabetes (both rare and common). In various
  UPR gene mutations, loss of function of critical UPR components (e.g., PERK) dysregulates
  the pathway leading to infantile diabetes. Gain-of-function proteotoxicity accompanies
  mutant proinsulin expression in the MIDY syndrome caused by the (C96Y) Akita variant.
  In T1D, islet immune cell infiltration elevates ER stress in β-cells. Peripheral
  insulin resistance elevates β-cell overwork in T2D. It is conceivable that similar
  events that occur in the murine models drive β-cell degeneration in human T1D and
  T2D.
