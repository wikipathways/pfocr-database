caption: The purple part shows the reconstruction of the common aromatic pathway for
  l-tyrosine overproduction; the global regulatory protein TyrR has been inactivated
  and four enzymes are overexpressed. As shown in the pale blue part, three enzymes
  are involved in the artificial pathway from tyrosine to ferulic acid. Black part
  in the right box shows the three steps from ferulic acid to vanillin, which are
  catalyzed by two enzymes. TyrR, a regulatory protein; PEPS, phosphoenolpyruvate
  synthetase; TKT, transketolase; fbr-DAHPS, fbr-3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  synthase; fbr-CM/PDH, fbr-chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase; TAL, tyrosine
  ammonia-lyase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeate O-methyltransferase;
  FCS, trans-feruloyl-CoA synthetase; ECH, enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase. The orchid
  was drawn by Jun Ni.
