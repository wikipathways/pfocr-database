caption: Experimental design and timeline. APOE4 transgenic mice can have vascular
  defects as early as two weeks (0.5 months of age);metabolic/synaptic dysfunctions
  at four months of age; memory decline at 12 months of age., We obtained female mice
  at one month of age to test the hypothesis that restoring vascular functions can
  further impede the decline of metabolic and cognitive functions. After baseline
  cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured, rapamycin diet was continuously supplied
  for six months. CBF was measured longitudinally using MRI after 1, 3, and 6 months
  of feeding. At the end-point of the study (i.e. mice at 7 months of age), blood–brain
  barrier (BBB) integrity was evaluated using MRI and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose
  (CMRGlc) was measured by PET (N = 6). A separate group of mice (N = 15) underwent
  behavioral assessment with Morris water maze (MWM). After MWM, mice were sacrificed
  and brain tissues were used for mechanistic pathway analyses using Western blot.
