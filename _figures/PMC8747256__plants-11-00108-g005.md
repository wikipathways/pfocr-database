caption: Genetic pathways and differentially expressed genes in root tips in response
  to hypoxia stress. (a) Part of the VLCFA, ethylene, ROS, and NO biosynthesis pathways
  and (b) part of the lignin biosynthetic pathway are presented with enzymes or proteins
  indicated at the left and numbers of the transcripts upregulated (↑) or downregulated
  (↓) by stagnant treatment in Tt139 and Amph819 (Amph) indicated at the right. In
  the genetic pathways, arrows between components indicate stimulation of activities
  at protein (bold arrows) or transcription level (fine arrow), and the T-bars indicate
  inhibition. The fold change of the transcripts can be found in .
