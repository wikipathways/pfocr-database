caption: (a) RPM, (b) TGEM, (c) BMDM, and (d) RAW macrophages express different proportions
  of TBXS, PGIS, PGDS (H-PGDS), and induced PGES (mPGES-1) that result in a close
  correlation with metabolite proportions, but only in cells that lack PGIS. Area
  of circles and squares represent percentage of total metabolites and enzyme transcripts
  after 8 hours KLA stimulation, respectively. COX-2 is dominant over COX-1 in this
  scenario, where PGIS possesses the most efficient coupling. Figure is from () and
