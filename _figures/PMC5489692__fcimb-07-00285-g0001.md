caption: 'Hypothetical metabolic network of Coxiella burnetii RSA 439 NMII. The pathways
  are predicted on the basis of the genome sequence (Seshadri et al., ) and earlier
  biochemical studies (McDonald and Mallavia, ; Hackstadt and Williams, ,). Amino
  acids seem to be the main carbon and energy source of Coxiella burnetii RSA 439
  NMII, since 23 amino acid transporters and 7 peptide and oligopeptide transporters
  have been predicted. Furthermore, some sugar transporters (CBU0265 and CBU0347)
  and a transporter for long chain fatty acids (CBU1242) have been identified, indicating
  that the metabolic potential of C. burnetii is versatile. In addition, enzymes responsible
  for glycerol metabolism (glpK: glycerol kinase, glpD: glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
  are present in C. burnetii, although a glycerol transporter has not been identified
  yet. Black or red arrows represent amino acids prototrophies or auxotrophies. Potential
  carbon nutrients are indicated by boxes. α-KGA, α-ketoglutarate; Man, mannose; Gal,
  galactose; GlcN, glucosamine; Mur, muramic acid; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl diphosphate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, TCA cycle.'
