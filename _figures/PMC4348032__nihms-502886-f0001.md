caption: 'A) Diagram of the preparatory and pay-off phases in glycolysis. The preparatory
  phase comprises four steps: a first phosphorylation [enzyme (HK), substrates (Glc,
  ATP), products (G6P, ADP), comments (a-it is the control point G-1, b-HK isozymes
  have direct access to mitochondrial ATP through specific binding to porins)], an
  isomerase reaction [enzyme (PGI), substrate (G6P), product (F6P), comment (it is
  a reversible and not normally favorable reaction driven by the concentration of
  F6P)], a second phosphorylation [enzyme (PFK-1), substrates (F6P, ATP), products
  (F1,6BP, ADP), comments (a-it is the control point G-2, the most important in glycolysis,
  b-during gluconeogenesis, a pathway crucial in developing brain, the reverse conversion
  must be performed by fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase)], an aldol reaction [enzyme (ALDO),
  substrate (F1,6BP), products (DHAP, GADP), comment (DHAP and GADP are rapidly and
  reversibly interconverted by TPI, a step essential to produce energy efficiently)].
  The pay-off phase comprises five steps: a redox reaction [enzyme (GAPDH), substrates
  (GADP, NAD+, Pi), products (1,3BPG, NADH, H+), comment (the highly exergonic oxidation
  of GADP drives the endergonic transferring of Pi to an intermediate to finally form
  1,3BPG, a product with high phosphoryl-transfer potential)], a first substrate-level
  phosphorylation [enzyme (PGK), substrates (1,3BPG, ADP), products (3PG, ATP), comment
  (it is the break-even point in glycolysis)], a mutase reaction [enzyme (PGAM), substrate
  (3PG), product (2PG), comment (a mutase does not change the oxidation state of the
  carbons in the compound)], a hydration [enzyme (ENO), substrates (2PG), product
  (PEP, H2O), comment (there are several enolase isozymes in humans)], a second substrate-level
  phosphorylation [enzyme (PK), substrates (PEP, ADP), products (Pyr, ATP), comment
  (it is the control point G-3)]. The negative and positive allosteric effectors are
  highlighted in blue and orange, respectively. B) The glycogen shunt hypothesis.
  Glycogenesis: The PGM, an isomerase, synthezises glucose-1-phosphate from G6P. The
  enzyme GS is responsible for the synthesis of glycogen polymers. This pathway utilizes
  UDP-glucose as the activated Glc donor. Glycogenolysis: Phosphorolysis by enzyme
  GP is the cleaving away of a bond by orthophosphate, and thus degradation of glycogen
  polymers to glucose-1-phosphate; which can then be isomerized to G6P by PGM iso-energetically.
  Abbreviations: ALDO → fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase, DHAP → dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate, TPI → triose-phosphate isomerase, GAPDH → glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase,
  NAD+ → nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form), 1,3BPG → 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate,
  3PG → 3-phosphoglycerate, 2PG → 2-phosphoglycerate, PGAM → phosphoglycerate mutase,
  ENO → enolase.'
