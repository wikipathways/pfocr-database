caption: Strategies to inhibit insulin induced PCa invasion and plasticity. This study
  shows insulin receptors in PCa cells can signal through a combination of PI3K/Akt
  and RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and in LNCaP cells, up-regulate FOXC2 transcription factor,
  which then activates transcription of a series of EMT and NE markers, to promote
  gain of cell invasion and migration. This pathway can be blocked top-down by reducing
  ADT-induced systemic hyperinsulinemia in PCa patients through use of anti-diabetic
  drug such as metformin, to reduce circulating insulin levels and ligand availability
  for insulin receptors in PCa cells. Alternatively, signaling may also be targeted
  downstream of the insulin receptors by targeting PI3K and MAPK pathways with small
  molecule inhibitors. Direct inhibition of insulin receptors, either IR or IGF1R,
  leads to worsening of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in patients and are
  not viable for clinical use in PCa ().
