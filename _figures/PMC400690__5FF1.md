caption: 'Fig. 1: Interconnections between serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)
  neurons in the brain stem and their common projection sites in the forebrain. The
  pathway from the locus coeruleus to the dorsal raphe is a monosynaptic projection
  terminating on α1-adrenergic receptors on 5-HT neurons, as depicted. The pathway
  from the dorsal raphe to the locus coeruleus is composed of an apposition of 3 synapses,
  with the excitatory 5-HT2A receptor being located on a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
  interneuron projecting to the NE neurons of the locus coeruleus.8 At the level of
  the projections of 5-HT neurons, there is an α2-adrenergic receptor, not depicted
  on the diagram, which exerts a negative feedback action on 5-HT release. The (+)
  and (–) signs represent excitatory and inhibitory actions, respectively, on the
  function of the neurons. The firing activity of the neurons is represented by the
  action potential waves in red on the axons of the neurons.'
