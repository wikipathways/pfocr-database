caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the antagonistic mechanism employed by ASFV
  MGF505-4R on IFN-I responses. MGF505-4R downregulates the protein level of cGAS
  by triggering TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy, thereby antagonizing the IFN-I
  production induced by the cGAS‒STING pathway. Additionally, MGF505-4R interacts
  with STAT1 and STAT2, which subsequently interferes with the formation of the ISGF3
  heterotrimer and its nuclear translocation, thereby reducing the production of ISGs

  TOLLIP-mediated selective autophagy and inhibits the formation of ISGF3 to evade
  innate immunity
