caption: Schematic model of the nuclear envelope proteins and their potential roles
  in EDMD physiopathology. Nuclear lamins form a meshwork underneath the INM connected
  with the cytoplasm. It interacts with TM proteins of the nuclear envelope, i.e.,
  emerin, LBR, LAP2, SUN1/2, and MAN1, and with several transcription factors such
  as Rb. Through the LINC complex, A-type lamins interact with actin microfilaments,
  microtubules, and cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, connecting the nuclear lamina
  to the extracellular matrix. MAPK pathways are important transduction cascades initiated
  by extracellular mitogens, growth factors and cytokines at the cell surface and
  finalized to the nucleus to control gene expression, regulating cell proliferation
  and differentiation, survival and apoptosis. LMNA mutations causing EDMD have been
  related to the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38α cascades, leading to the posterior
  activation of CTGF/CCN2 via TGF-ß/Smad signaling pathway and cofilin-1, the latter
  leading to actin depolymerization. After serum or mechanical stimulation, RhoA promotes
  cytoplasmic actin polymerization, causing the release of MKL1 from cytoplasmic G-actin.
  MKL1 translocates into the nucleus and together with SRF induces gene expression.
  In addition, emerin facilitates polymerization of nuclear actin, reducing the nuclear
  export of MKL1 to the cytoplasm. In EDMD cells, emerin mislocalizes and is unable
  to modulate nuclear actin polymerization. G-actin binds to MKL1 and it is exported
  from the nucleus, impairing gene expression. YAP and TAZ are key transcription factors
  for cell proliferation. YAP/TAZ activation causes their nuclear accumulation, promoting
  cell proliferation, and inhibiting differentiation. Nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ
  is increased in patient myoblasts with LMNA mutations. Green arrows indicate reported
  pathways and red arrows indicate altered EDMD reported pathways. BAF, barrier-to-autointegration
