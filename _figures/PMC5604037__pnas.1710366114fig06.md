caption: Schematic overview of MYC-mediated metabolic pathways. (A) A total of 215
  major metabolic reactions are regulated by MYC expression through 160 unique target
  metabolic genes. (B) Almost all metabolic genes (in red boxes) involved in de novo
  purine and pyrimidine synthesis are regulated by MYC. (C) Metabolic genes (enclosed
  in boxes) involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis,
  serine synthesis, and one-carbon metabolism, including the folate and methionine
  cycles, are regulated by MYC. Metabolic genes in red boxes were up-regulated, whereas
  PEPCK (in a blue box) was down-regulated by MYC expression.
