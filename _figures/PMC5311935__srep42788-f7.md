caption: In the proposed model, mGluR1/5 stimulation activates calpain-1 following
  calcium entry through T-type voltage dependent calcium channel. Calpain-1 degrades
  the B56α subunit of PP2A, which results in decreased PP2A activity and stimulation
  of the Akt/mTOR/S6 pathway, leading to increase in Arc and PSD95 synthesis. Increased
  synaptic levels of Arc and PSD95 facilitate endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPA
  receptors, producing LTD. In calpain-1 KO mice, the lack of B56α degradation in
  response to mGluR1/5 stimulation prevents activation of this signaling pathway,
  which results in LTD impairment. Application of a PP2A inhibitor substitutes for
  calpain-1 activation, and therefore reverses the impairment in LTD and the associated
  changes in Arc and PSD95.
