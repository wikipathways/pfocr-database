caption: Schematic illustration of Wnt1/β-catenin signaling regulation of midbrain
  dopaminergic (mDAergic) neuron survival/death according to our published findings
  [,,,,,,,,]. Major environmental factors including aging, inflammation, and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
  (MPTP) exposure may increase oxidative load and a panel of endogeneous Wnt antagonists
  (Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF), frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs))
  that, in synergy with genetic mutations and dysfunctional glia–neuron interactions,
  antagonize canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling (“Wnt off”) in mDA neurons. Upregulation
  of active GSK-3β then leads to β-catenin degradation promoting DA neuron death.
  In the presence of canonical Wnt1-like agonists (such as R-spondin (Rspo) or Norrin),
  GSK-3β antagonists, or nitric oxide non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NO-NSAID)
  treatments, activation of Wnt/β-catenin (“Wnt on”) contributes to maintaining the
  integrity of mDA neurons via blockade of GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation and proteasomal
  degradation of the neuronal pool of β-catenin. β-catenin then translocates into
  the nucleus and associates with a family of transcription factors regulating the
  expression of Wnt target genes involved in mDAergic neuron survival. Schematic drawing
  based on published results on Wnt signaling in PD [,,,,,,,,].
