caption: Possible mechanisms involved in the autocrine–paracrine–intracrine regulation
  of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme expression in epithelial and endothelial cells. A
  positive feedback loop is formed by prostaglandins (PG) to promote intracellular
  signalling via the cAMP, inositol trisphosphate (IP3), mitogen-associated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase–protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathways,
  and induction of COX enzyme expression. This positive feedback loop, in turn, results
  in activation of transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis, inhibition
  of apoptosis, proliferation and tissue invasion and metastasis. In addition, the
  COX–prostanoid biosynthetic and signalling pathway, especially in neoplastically
  transformed endocervical cells, may also be regulated by immune function, cytokines,
  chemokines and seminal plasma prostanoids.
