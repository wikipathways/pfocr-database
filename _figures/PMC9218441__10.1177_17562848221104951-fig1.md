caption: Schematic diagram of novel mechanisms of intestinal stricture in 2021. NOD2
  mutations caused dysregulated homeostasis of activated fibroblasts and macrophages.
  Tryptase released from MCs, VDR deficiency in epithelial cells, AGR2 secreted by
  epithelial cells under ER stress, and acidic pH facilitated differentiation of fibroblasts
  into myofibroblasts. VDR deficiency in epithelial cells also contributed to EMT.
  Bacteroides fragilis colonization and the increasement of circulating bone marrow-derived
  fibrocytes were correlated with fibrosis formation. FN which is secreted by HIMC
  mediated the migration of preadipocytes via the FN/α5β1 integrin signaling pathway,
  thus contributing to the formation of CrF.AGR2, anterior gradient protein 2 homolog;
  CrF, creeping fat; ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition;
  ER stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress; FN, fibronectin; HIMC, human intestinal
  muscle cells; MCs, mast cells; NOD2, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2;
  VDR, vitamin D receptor.
