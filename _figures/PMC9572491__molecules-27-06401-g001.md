caption: 'A schematic representation depicting the molecular pathways with the biomarkers
  of caspase-dependent programmed cell death: intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. [The
  intrinsic pathway (LHS in the figure) begins inside a cell that is mitochondrial-mediated,
  where apoptosis is initiated when cellular stresses caused by damage of DNA, shock
  due to heat and oxidative stress, causing the release of cytochrome c or Smac/DIABLO
  from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol, takes place. Release
  of cytochrome c is achieved by Bcl2 protein family (Bax, Bid), which translocate
  to the mitochondria, and/or oligomerize within mitochondrial membranes, forming
  pores which in turn releases cytochrome c to the cytoplasm from the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space. Released cytochrome c, in turn, binds to Apaf-1, a cytosolic
  protein that normally exists as an inactive monomer. The binding of cytochrome c
  induces a conformational change in Apaf-1, allowing it to bind the nucleotide dATP
  or ATP. The nucleotide binding to the Apaf-1–cytochrome c complex triggers its oligomerization
  to form the apoptosome (a high molecular weight heptameric compound). Apoptosome
  activates caspase-9, which then cleaves, and thereby, activates the effector caspases,
  caspases-3 and -7. DNA damage and other stress signals may trigger the increase
  of p53 proteins. The extrinsic pathway (RHS in the figure) begins outside a cell
  that is receptor-mediated and initiated by receptor ligation, trimerization and
  recruitment of adapter molecules like FADD and TRADD to the death domain (DD), forming
  a complex known as the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Procaspase-8 then
  binds to the death effector domains (DED) of the adaptor molecules, which is then
  followed by oligomerization and activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 then either directly
  activates the executioner caspases-3 and -7 or activates the cytosolic protein,
  Bid, to translocate into the mitochondria, causing the release of cytochrome c].'
