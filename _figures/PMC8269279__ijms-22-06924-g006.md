caption: 'Roles of STYX domain pseudophosphatases in disease: (A) Prototypical STYX
  roles in colorectal cancer. STYX promotes oncogenesis in colorectal cancer by inhibiting
  FBXW7. STYX binds FBXW7, preventing other interactions of FBXW7, which is a substrate
  recruiter for a ubiquitin protein ligase complex. Thus, STYX prevents the degradation
  of cyclin E and c-Jun, promoting proliferation in colorectal cancer. STYX overexpression
  increases the expression of vimentin, N-cadherin, snail, slug, and ZEB1, but reduction
  in E-cadherin. These proteins support EMT; STYX may promote the oncogenesis of colorectal
  cancer by positively regulating EMT. (B) MK-STYX’s links in diseases. (i) The Ewing’s
  sarcoma fusion protein EWS-FLI1 increases MK-STYX expression. The EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein
  binds an ETS binding motif within the MK-STYX gene and increases the MK-STYX’s expression.
  (ii) MK-STYX promotes hepatocellular carcinoma. An increase in MK-STYX mRNA expression
  leads to upregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway proteins and an enhancement of proliferation
  in hepatocellular carcinoma, while inhibiting apoptosis and CELF2. (C) STYXL2 mutation
  leads to muscular system malfunction. A transgene integration into the STYXL2 gene
  reduces STYXL2 expression in zebrafish, resulting in reduced embryonic motility,
  low spontaneous coiling movements, and severely reduced touch response, as well
  as major muscle fibers disorganization.'
