caption: (A) Schematic diagram of a generalized signal transduction pathway resulting
  in activation and nuclear import of a transcription factor and subsequent transcriptional
  activation. Under resting conditions (1), the transcription factor is bound to a
  cytoplasmic anchoring protein. Receptor ligation and/or physiologic redox signals
  result in phosphorylation of the transcription factor and/or phosphorylation or
  oxidation of the anchor and release of the transcription factor (2). The exposed
  nuclear localization signal (NLS) is recognized by importins, which escort the transcription
  factor into the nucleus (3). Importin β is also involved in retrograde transport
  of activated signaling proteins along neuritic processes (4). Within the nucleus,
  RanGTP binds importin β, which promotes disassembly of the import complex (5), freeing
  the transcription factor to bind DNA and form active transcription regulatory complexes.
  Transcription may be terminated by nuclear phosphatases and/or proteasomal degradation
  (6). Nuclear export is mediated by complexes consisting of cargo, an exportin, and
  RanGTP. Near the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope, Ran GTPase-activating
  protein (RanGAP) maintains the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic RanGTP gradient by catalyzing
  GTP hydrolysis (7), promoting disassembly of the export complex. Importins are also
  recycled to the cytoplasm through a RanGTP-mediated mechanism. (B) Proposed mechanisms
  through which oxidative stress could impair nuclear transport of transcription factors,
  depriving the cell of adaptive, prosurvival transcriptional support and eliciting
  potentially detrimental cytosolic effects. Under conditions of oxidative stress
  such as those that occur during acute and chronic neurodegenerative insults, adaptive
  signaling pathways are activated by phosphorylation and/or redox mechanisms. However,
  post-translational modifications may impair cargo recognition by importins (1).
  Oxidative cross-linking of proteins, the presence of mutant neurodegenerative disease-associated
  proteins, and/or oxidative inactivation of phosphatase or proteasomal function could
  promote protein aggregation, resulting in further sequestration of signaling proteins
  (2). Sustained cytoplasmic signaling and/or organelle-targeted activation could
  further contribute to pathogenic mechanisms, such as calpain activation, altered
  mitochondrial function or autophagic stress from dysregulated autophagy (3). Alternatively,
  the nuclear pore complex itself could be the target of oxidative damage, with impairment
  of import and/or leakage of proteins from the nucleus (4). Intranuclear aggregation
  or other post-translational or oxidative/nitrosative modifications may further interfere
  with proper transcriptional responses (5), resulting in loss of stabilizing transcription
  complex-DNA interactions. Dissipation of the RanGTP gradient and/or impairment of
  importin recycling could also affect nuclear trafficking (6). Finally, lack of transcriptional
  support and/or oxidative or aggregative damage to axons and dendrites could result
  in further impairment in transmission of signals needed for maintenance and/or repair
  of neurites and synaptic structures (7). ROS, reactive oxygen species.
