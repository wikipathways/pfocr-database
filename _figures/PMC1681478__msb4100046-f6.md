caption: A flux map of the methanogenic pathway for growth of an mtr mutant on methanol
  and acetate. Blue arrows indicate the direction of enzymatic activity and the arrow
  thicknesses are proportional to the flux through each reaction (a thicker arrow
  has a larger flux). The uptake of acetate (ac) is dependent on the uptake of methanol
  (meoh), which was constrained at 16 mmol gDW−1 h−1. The MTSPCMMT reaction encoded
  by the mtr operon is not available to the cell (because of the mutated state) and
  the F4RHi reaction is predicted not to be active for this optimal growth solution.
  All of the primary metabolites (large circles) are connected, except for ATP which
  participates in ATPS4r and ACKr. The secondary metabolites (small circles) that
  appear more than once in the map are adp, pi, h, h2o, fdred, fdox, f420-2h2, f420-2,
  coa and com. The different colored regions correspond to the equal flux correlated
  reaction sets that were determined during the gene deletion analysis and are listed
  in . All the reactions in each set will contain the same flux value for a given
  condition. The map does not display the stoichiometry for the ion translocating
  reactions (see ). The reaction abbreviations are listed in  and also in  along with
  the metabolite abbreviations.
