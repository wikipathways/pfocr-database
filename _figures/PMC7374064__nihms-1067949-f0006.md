caption: Network of molecules identified by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to be
  associated with miRNAs modified stretch. (A) Network was generated for the miRNA-EVs
  differentially regulated in response to 5% continuous stretch. (B) Network was generated
  for the miRNA-EVs differentially regulated in response to 10% cyclic stretch.
