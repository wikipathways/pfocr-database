caption: 'mTOR per se is a Ser/Thr protein kinase as noted by the two lobes KD called
  the KD N-lobe and the KD C-lobe. It has 20 tandem HEAT repeat domains near its N-terminus,
  to be followed by FAT domain, FRB domain, LBE domain and FATC domain at its C-terminus.
  The critical binding partner to create mTORC1 is Raptor, which together with mLST8,
  PRAS40, DEPTOR and FKBP12 that bind to the corresponding domains in mTOR constitute
  the rapamycin sensitive mTORC1. The critical binding partner to create mTORC2 is
  Rictor, which together with SIN1, mLST8, DEPTOR and Protor1/2 which bind to the
  corresponding domains in mTOR constitute the rapamycin insensitive mTORC2. Based
  on recent studies in the testis, the signaling proteins and pathways that modulate
  Sertoli cell BTB dynamics are also shown (see text for details). It is noted that
  the signaling pathways depicted herein are highly simplified and based on recent
  studies in the testis, readers should seek additional information in recent reviews
  from other investigators in the field, which are cited in text. Abbreviations used:
