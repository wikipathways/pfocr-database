caption: A Simplified Diagram of Multiple Molecular Pathways that May Regulate Plant
  Transport Proteins at Various Levels.At the transcriptional level, transcription
  factors master the expression of genes encoding plant transport proteins in response
  to different developmental and environmental cues. After the proteins are synthesized,
  components in the secretory pathway or other trafficking mechanisms ensure the proper
  targeting of the transport proteins to the correct membrane fractions for physiological
  functions. At the post-translational level, multiple covalent modifications such
  as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may occur on different plant transport proteins
  to control their abundance, stability, targeting, or activity.
