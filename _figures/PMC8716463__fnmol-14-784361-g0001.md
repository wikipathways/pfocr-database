caption: Schematic overview of common DNA damage types and their repair pathways in
  normal physiology. DNA base modification (e.g., 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanine) can be
  repaired by base excision repair (BER) initiated with the removal of the oxidized
  base by specific DNA glycosylases, leading to the generation of single-strand break
  (SSB), which are eventually resolved by SSB repair (SSBR) pathway involving DNA
  polymerase β and DNA ligase 3. DNA mismatches (MM) are repaired through the mismatch
  repair (MMR) pathway. MM can be recognized by a group of very conserved MutS homologs
  (e.g., MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6), and the DNA altered region is eventually replaced
  through the action of DNA polymerase δ and DNA ligase 1. Double strand breaks (DSBs)
  are sensed by MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, while cells can choose different
  pathways (homologous recombination (HR), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ)) to repair the breaks, based on the cell types, cell phases and
  the structure of the DNA break ends. DNA repair deficiency is linked to human diseases
  like cancer and neurodegeneration, as well as aging. *Indicates the base modification
  of DNA.
