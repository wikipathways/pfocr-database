caption: Several typical post-translational modifications of PGK1. A. KAT9 is a potential
  acetyltransferase of PGK1, which increases the K220 acetylation level and inhibits
  PGK1 enzyme activity by blocking its binding with substrate ADP. On the other hand,
  insulin-induced PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway increases S424 phosphorylation of HDAC3, which
  promotes PGK1-HDAC3 interaction and PGK1 deacetylation at K220 to stimulate PGK1
  activity. Finally, this HDAC3-dependent PGK1 deacetylation increases the production
  of glycolytic ATP, 3-PG and NADPH in cells. B. Hypoxia and glutamine deprivation
  inhibit mTOR-dependent ARD1 phosphorylation at S228, which enables ARD1 to interact
  with PGK1 for PGK1 acetylation. Next, the acetylated PGK1 binds to and phosphorylates
  Beclin1 at S30, which leads to activation of the VPS34-Beclin1-ATG14L complex for
  autophagosome formation. C. Signals (hypoxia, activation of EGFR, and K-Ras/B-Raf
  mutation) induce ERK-dependent phosphorylation of PGK1 at S203. Phosphorylated PGK1
  is transported to mitochondria under the regulation of TOM complex and PIN1. Mitochondrial
  PGK1 functions as a protein kinase to phosphorylate and activate PDHK1, which further
  leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of PDH complex. This process results in
  the decrease of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and ROS generation and the enhancement
  of glycolysis in cytoplasm, and ultimately promotes GBM cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
  D. M2-polarized macrophages secrete IL-6 to increase PDPK1-dependent PGK1 phosphorylation
  in GBM cells. This phosphorylation can reduce the 3-PG affinity of PGK1, which facilitates
  the equilibrium of the PGK1-catalyzed reaction toward glycolysis.
