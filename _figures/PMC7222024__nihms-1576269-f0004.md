caption: The figure highlights the upregulated (green) and downregulated (red) metabolic
  pathways under hypoxia. Hypoxic cells increase the uptake and utilization of glucose
  via glycolysis to obtain energy, while reducing their metabolism in mitochondria
  (). This leads to the generation of large amounts of lactate, which is secreted
  and can support metabolism of neighbouring cells. As a protective mechanism, glucose
  is also diverted towards the serine synthesis pathway to overcome the loss of cellular
  antioxidant capacity when pentose phosphate pathway activity is decreased. Hypoxia
  also promotes glycogenesis, which could provide a mechanism of energy storage to
  survive prolonged stress. Under hypoxic inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, generation of anabolic metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA, which is key for
  the synthesis of fatty acids, is largely supported by the increased uptake and metabolism
  of glutamine. Concomitantly, catabolism of fatty acids via β-oxidation is suppressed,
  while the uptake of lipids from the exterior increased. Lipid desaturation, allowing
  generation of unsaturated fatty acids is inhibited in hypoxia (owing to the requirement
  for oxygen by stearoyl-CoA desaturase). To counteract potential lipotoxicity associated
  with the accumulation of saturated lipids and disruption of membrane structure and
  integrity, cells increase the uptake of unsaturated lipids from the environment
  and increase the formation of lipid droplets, which can act as buffers for saturated
  lipid species. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CD36, cluster
