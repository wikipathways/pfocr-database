caption: The role of telomere and telomerase activity in endometrial cancer. Hormonal
  imbalance (excess of Estrogen or insufficient levels of progesterone) will increase
  telomerase and elevate telomerase activity was described in all types of endometrial
  hyperplasia and in endometrial cancer. Dysfunctional telomeres results in genomic
  instability, the first step in endometrial carcinogenesis. Telomerase dependent
  pathway is the most widely reported classical telomere length maintenance mechanism
  but ALT pathway; telomerase independent telomere maintenance was described in some
  cancer types that lack telomerase activity.
