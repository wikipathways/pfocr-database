caption: (A) The binding of TNF to TNFR1 stimulates downstream nuclear factor-κB activation
  and other pro-survival, proinflammatory signals. (B) When cIAP1/2 activity is low,
  signalling is diverted to the formation of a death-induced signalling complex termed
  Complex II (a/b). This physically distinct complex is variably composed of TRADD,
  FADD, RIPK1, RIPK3 and the apoptosis initiator Caspase-8. (C) Necroptosis is activated
  when cellular conditions curb Caspase-8 activity and favour the assembly of RIPK1
  and RIPK3, via their RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif (RHIM) domains, into a high
  molecular mass complex termed the necrosome. Here, RIPK3 is activated by autophosphorylation
  and MLKL is recruited and phosphorylated by RIPK3. MLKL dissociates from RIPK3 and
  oligomerised MLKL is trafficked to biological membrane [,]. The precise molecular
  events that lead to lytic permeabilization of the cell are still a matter of contention
  []. Sites of some selected published human germline mutations shown to be associated
  with human disease due to gain (red) or loss/reduction in function (green) are shown.
