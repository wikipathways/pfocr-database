caption: 'A schematic composite of the complex protein circuitries identified by the

  squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix [, , ] and depicting established interrelationships
  with both HPV-encoded oncoproteins - E5, E6, and E7 [–, , , ] and with the mTOR
  pathway. HPV infection of cervical squamous epithelium leads to the incorporation
  of HPVoncogenes, E5, E6 and E7 into the genome resulting in the production of the
  corresponding oncoproteins. E5 activates EGFR and delays its degradation resulting
  in increased EGFR expression and then its signaling through the PI3''-K/Akt and
  ras/Raf kinase/ERK pathway, thereby contributing to phosphorylative activation of
  Akt and ERK1/2, respectively. This accounts for the expression of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2
  in HSIL and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Downstream signaling by p-Akt results
  in the constitutive activation and expression of p-mTOR (Ser 2448). Interaction
  of E6 oncoprotein with TSC2 (tuberin) contributes to signaling through the mTOR
  and probably ERK pathways [, , , ]. The former accounts for increased expression
  of p-p70S6K (Thr 389) and its downstream effector p-pS6 kinase and the latter collaborates
  with p-mTOR and contributes to activation of eIF4E through the phosphorylative inactivation
  of 4E-BP1. Additionally, p-ERK1/2 could contribute to mTOR pathway signaling by
  also contributing to the inactivation of TSC2 []. Translational synthesis of proteins
  including E7 oncoprotein results from the activation of eIF4E. E7 oncoprotein has
  been linked to growth and survival (immortalization) of HPV-associated, transformed
  cancer cells and to the signaling via the Akt/mTOR pathway by upregulating Akt activity.
  Cell cycle progression associated with mTOR and ERK pathway downstream signaling
