caption: After invasion of the host cell, T gondii alters host signaling pathways
  and gene expression, antagonizing immune responses. STAT3 activated by IL-6 and
  IL-10 is associated with antagonizing host defense. T. gondii also directly activates
  STAT3 to antagonize the host immune response. T. gondii also upregulates SOCS3,
  which binds JAK-2 and inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT3. The depletion of SOCS3
  enhanced T. gondii-induced STAT3 signaling, resulting in reduced levels of IL-12
  and IFN-γ. Taken together, these results indicate that SOCS3 might have additional
  mechanisms to limit the phosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, T. gondii antagonizes
  IFN-γ production by interfering with NF-κB activation and STAT1 activation, which
  are inhibited by SOCS1
