caption: Exhibition of the three pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways and
  their mediated immunomodulatory effects in the DI tissues of SBMIE pearl gentian
  grouper. (A) There is no RIG-I gene in pearl gentian grouper, and the RIG-I like
  receptor signaling pathway was activated through MDA5 route; (B) there are several
  co-contained genes in the three PRR signaling pathway, indicating the interactions
  among them, and finally culminated in the transcriptome activation of NF-κB, IRFs,
  costimulatory molecules, etc., and finally promoted the expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines, interferons (IFNs), chemokines, and other molecules necessary for innate
  and/or adaptive immune responses. (A) RIG-like receptor signaling pathway. (B) NOD-like
  receptor signaling pathway. (C) Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.
