caption: Distinct signaling pathways mediate egl-4 phenotypes. egl-4 promotes a reduced
  longevity by negatively regulating the activity of the insulin signaling transcription
  factor daf-16 (), promotes a reduced body size by negatively regulating the activity
  of the dbl-1 TGF-β (; ), promotes a pale intestine and nondauer development by positively
  regulating the daf-7 TGF-β, as well as by another unidentified pathway (; ) (this
  work), and promotes a reduced locomotion and feeding rate in the presence of food
  by an as yet unidentified signaling pathway.
