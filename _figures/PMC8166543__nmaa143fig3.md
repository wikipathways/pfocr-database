caption: The suggested pathways of ASX blocking the MAPK signaling pathway. ASX suppresses
  the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways. JNK dephosphorylation
  results in decreased Bcl2 expression. Dephosphorylated p38 MAPK leads to a decrease
  in p53 and BAX concentrations as well as XPC concentrations, which enhances sensitivity
  to erlotinib treatment for NSCLC. Altogether, ASX regulates cell proliferation,
  division, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inflammation via inhibition
  of the MAPK signaling pathway. Eventually, ASX can inhibit lung fibrosis, chronic
  lung inflammation, ALI, and NSCLC. ALI, acute lung injury; ASX, astaxanthin; BAX,

  description: The suggested pathways of ASX blocking the MAPK signaling pathway.
    ASX suppresses the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways. JNK
    dephosphorylation results in decreased Bcl2 expression. Dephosphorylated p38 MAPK
    leads to a decrease in p53 and BAX concentrations as well as XPC concentrations,
    which enhances sensitivity to erlotinib treatment for NSCLC. Altogether, ASX regulates
    cell proliferation, division, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and
