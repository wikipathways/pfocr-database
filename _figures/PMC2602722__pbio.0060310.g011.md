caption: '(A) Diagram illustrating the p53–Mdm2 circuit regulated by SENP2 in the
  trophoblast cell cycle. Stimulation of Mdm2 by SENP2 leads to degradation of p53.
  Cellular levels of p53 control the G–S transition that has a dual role in TGC development.
  The G–S phase is required for both mitotic division (cell cycle: G1, S, G2, and
  M) and endoreduplication (endocycle: G and S only) during expansion of trophoblast
  stem cells and maturation of trophoblasts, respectively. Although a low p53 level
  is essential for stem cell proliferation, inhibition of p53 is required upon differentiation.(B)
  Schematic representation for the mechanism underlying the regulation of p53 and
  Mdm2 by the SUMO pathway. SENP2 activates Mdm2 by removing SUMO that permits the
  modulation of p53 by Mdm2 in the nucleus. The ubiquitin-conjugated p53 is then degraded
  in the cytoplasm.'
