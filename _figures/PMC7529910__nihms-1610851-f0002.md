caption: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is involved in many cellular functions, including
  protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis
  and drug resistance [] () and its activation is frequently observed in diverse hematological
  malignancies including AML [,], ALL [], NHL [], MM [,], CML [] and CLL []. Inhibition
  of this pathway has been an attractive strategy in both hematological as well as
  non-hematologic malignancies, and idelalisib (a PI3KΔ inhibitor in CLL), copanlisib
  (PI3KαΔ inhibitor in follicular lymphoma) and duvelisib (PI3K Δ/γ inhibitor for
  CLL) are currently approved and in clinical use for these hematological malignancies.
  Choudhary and colleagues initially developed venetoclax resistant NHL cell lines
  and found activation of AKT accompanied by up-regulation of MCL1/BCLXL in these
  cells []. Of note, down-regulation of these proteins, particularly AKT and MCL1,
  with siRNA sensitized resistant cells to venetoclax. Furthermore, co-treatment with
  idelalisib and venetoclax decreased MCL1 expression significantly and increased
  cell death in association with AKT-mediated BAX activation []. Various other groups
  subsequently demonstrated synergism between venetoclax and inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, such as copanlisib and duvelisib [–], in malignant hematopoietic cells.
  The mechanism of synergism in these studies appeared to proceed primarily through
  down-regulation of MCL1 and/or BCLXL. For example, in AML cells, PI3K and AKT inactivation
  resulted in GSK3α activation, leading to increased MCL1 degradation [] Based in
  part upon these pre-clinical findings, clinical trials combining venetoclax with
  copanlisib (NCT03886649; relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma), duvelisib (NCT03534323
  for R/R CLL or Richter’s transformation) and idelalisib (NCT03639324 for R/R CLL)
  are currently ongoing.
