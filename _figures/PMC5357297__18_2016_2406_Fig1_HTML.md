caption: 'Generalised overview of H2S production and degradation within mammalian
  tissues. The dietary amino acids, methionine and cysteine, serve as the primary
  substrates for the trans-sulfuration pathway and in the production of H2S. The levels
  of H2S within cells and tissues will be governed by the rates of synthesis by the
  enzymes cystathionine β synthase (CBS, EC 4.2.1.22), cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE,
  EC 4.4.1.1), 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST, EC 2.8.1.2), versus the
  rates of oxidation and detoxification by the enzymes ethylmalonic encephalopathy
  protein 1 (ETHE1, EC: 1.13.11.18) and sulfur:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR, EC 1.8.5.4).
  Alternatively, the levels of the substrate cysteine may be depleted via the catabolic
  actions of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, EC: 1.13.11.20)'
