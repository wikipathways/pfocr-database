caption: 'Experience in environmental enrichment upregulates the expression of several
  neurotrophic factors, i.e., brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth
  factor (NGF). Upregulation of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is observed in the
  hippocampus of APPswe/PS1ΔE9 but not wild type mice, while upregulation of neurotrophin-3
  (NT-3) is observed in the hippocampi of wild type but not APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Upregulation
  of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) suggests that upregulation of BDNF signaling
  may be enhanced by the conversion of immature BDNF into the mature form by plasmin.
  Based on the observed upregulation of the BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB),
  we hypothesize that neurotrophin binding to their receptors activates intracellular
  signaling cascades. Intracellularly, several pathways are activated: Protein kinase
  B (Akt) is phosphorylated, and may downregulate glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β)
  activity that in turn, results in downregulation of tau phosphorylation. This pathway
  is blocked in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Alternatively, a Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase pathway Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK, 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase and mitogen- and
  stress-activated protein kinase (RSK2/MSK) signaling might be activated following
  neurotrophin activation. In addition, neurotransmitter (i.e., NMDAR)-induced Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase cascade is activated. These pathways lead to upregulation of CREB
  phosphorylation in wild type mice, which in turn, regulates gene expression necessary
  for the formation of long-term memory, including BDNF and IGF-2.'
