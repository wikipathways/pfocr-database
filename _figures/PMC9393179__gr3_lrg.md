caption: Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects of silymarin. Sallymarin
  increases the transcriptional activity of Nrf2. Regulation of the expression of
  antioxidant genes is critical for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining physiological
  homeostasis. Of the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1, Antioxidants
  axis is the most important regulator of Nrf2 activity. Sallymarin also reduces the
  expression of the TLR-4 pathway, which leads to a decrease in NF-KB activity and
  the production of inflammatory mediators. Silymarin also modulates the immune response,
  leading to the production of NETS by noutrophil and reducing the overproduction
  of inflammatory and oxidative factors by immune responses. Anti-inflammatory effects
  of silymarin. TLR, Toll-like receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; IkB, inhibitor
  of kappa B; PUSFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
  IFNs, interferons; IL, interleukin.
