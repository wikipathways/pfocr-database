caption: Bile acid synthesis in the liver and biotransformation in the gut. Two major
  pathways of BA synthesis from cholesterol have been characterized. Cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) are the rate-limiting enzymes for the
  classical pathway and alternative pathway, respectively. Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA) are two primary BAs found in humans, which are conjugated with glycine
  or taurine. In mice, CDCA and UDCA are further converted into α-muricholic acid
  (α-MCA) and β-MCA by Cyp2c70, respectively. α-MCA also can be converted into β-MCA.
  Both α-MCA and β-MCA are conjugated with taurine. The conjugated primary BAs are
  deconjugated and transformed into secondary BAs by gut bacteria. In humans, CA is
  converted into deoxycholic acid (DCA) and CDCA is converted into lithocholic acid
  (LCA). In mice, α-MCA and β-MCA are converted into murideoxycholic acid (MDCA),
  hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), and ω-MCA. LCA also can be converted into MDCA and HDCA.
