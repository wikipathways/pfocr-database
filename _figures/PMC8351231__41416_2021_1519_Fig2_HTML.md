caption: (Left) When Hippo signalling is off, YAP enters the nucleus, interacts with
  TEAD and recruits other factors to induce gene transcription. (Right) When Hippo
  signalling is on, YAP is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 on multiple sites, resulting
  in interaction with 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic retention; phosphorylation also leads
  to YAP poly-ubiquitination and degradation. TEAD does not bind with YAP and target
  gene transcription is suppressed. MST1/2 mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1/2, SAV Salvador
  non-catalytic scaffold protein, LATS1/2 large tumour suppressor 1/2, YAP Yes-associated
  protein, Mob1 Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1, TEAD TEA domain family member
  1, ABL Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene, β-Trcp β-transducin repeat-containing
  protein, NF2 neurofibromin 2.
