caption: (A) IGF1 stimulates the production of PtdIns(3)P by the Class I and class
  III Vps34 at the endosomes where SGK3 can be recruited and activated by PDK1 and
  mTORC2 []. Once activated SGK3 phosphorylates its selective substrates STX7 and
  STX12 that are involved in the endocytic pathway. Phosphorylation of STX12 at Ser
  139 by SGK3 that is located just beyond the N-terminal Habc regulatory domain promotes
  interaction with the t-SNARE proteins syntaxin 6 and Vti1a and the v-SNARE protein
  VAMP4. Our data suggest that this promotes plasma membrane localization. We propose
  that assessing phosphorylation of STX7 (Ser126) and STX12 (Ser139) that are specific
  substrates for SGK2 could be used as key biomarkers for the SGK3 signaling pathway.
