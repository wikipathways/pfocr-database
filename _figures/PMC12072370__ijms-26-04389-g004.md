caption: Knockout of StNADC has devastating effects on NAD synthesis and activates
  plant senescence and tuberization pathways. (A) Co-expression network of key genes
  in the NAD pathway. Pearson’s correlation coefficient values were calculated for
  each gene. The strength of the connection is represented by the size of the circle.
  (B) The metabolites related to StNADC in cr2–11 and the wild type at Day 15 and
  Day 30 after propagation. **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01 (C) A simplified
  representation of the NAD biosynthetic pathway. The square heat map represents the
  transcriptional data related to NAD metabolism in transgenic (cr2–11) and WT plants.
  The normalized gene expression values [log2(FPKM+1)] were used to plot the heat
  maps
