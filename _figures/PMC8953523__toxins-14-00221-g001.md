caption: Global metabolic pathways of tryptophan according to the most recent insights.
  Different enzymes are involved in the generation of uremic toxins and activators
  of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). (1) Tryptophanase; (2) indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenases
  (IDOs) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxgenase (TDO) and (3) the newly identified interleukin
  4-induced-1 (IL4I1). Indole is further metabolized in the liver (green arrows) by
  cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1), resulting in indoxyl and
  indoxyl sulfate (sulfotransferase) and indole-3-acetic acid (acetate transferase).
  Both the IDOs/TDO (red arrows) and IL4I1-dependent pathways (purple arrows) are
  involved in the generation of kynurenic acid. The end-metabolites are excreted by
  the kidneys (yellow arrows). For the sake of completeness, in grey, (4) the serotonin
  pathway.
