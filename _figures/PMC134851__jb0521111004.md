caption: Integrated model for FPR participation in the soxRS response of E. coli.
  At least part of the FPR protective action is proposed to be related to its ability
  to oxidize the NADPH pool, since NADPH accumulation during the oxidative stress
  condition might favor propagation of active oxygen species such as · OH through
  the reduction of Fe3+ and other transition metals (). FPR is not required for regulation
  of the soxRS response, although depletion of the electron source might contribute
  to SoxR activation (see below). Under conditions of normal aerobic growth, a reductive
  pathway presumably involving a SoxR reductase () maintains the SoxR dimer in a reduced
  inactive state (SoxRred). During oxidative stress, the dimer is converted into the
  transcriptionally active form with oxidized iron-sulfur centers (SoxRox). Both forms
  of SoxR bind to the soxS promoter, but only the interaction of SoxRox stimulates
  transcription (arrow with plus symbol). SoxS then activates expression of the other
  members of the regulon, including FPR, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH),
  flavodoxin I (FldI), and Mn-dependent SOD. The balance between SoxRox and SoxRred
  will be biased toward SoxR oxidation whenever electrons are drained from the cellular
  pool of reduced metabolites. Factors affecting this balance comprise inactivation
  of key enzymes involved in NADPH synthesis (G6PDH) and the accumulation of chemicals
  or proteins causing the oxidation or destruction of reduced metabolites. The latter
  class includes oxygen-centered radicals such as superoxide or nitric oxide, redox
  cycling compounds such as MV, and electron acceptor proteins and enzymes such as
  FldI, desulfoferrodoxin, or FPR.
