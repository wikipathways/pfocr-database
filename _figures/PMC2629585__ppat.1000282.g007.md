caption: 'The upper panel illustrates the relationship between molecules involved
  in the classical pathway (green arrow), lectin pathway (red arrow), amplification
  pathway 1 (blue arrow), and 2 (brown arrow). In the lower panel, CRP and L-ficolin
  recruited to the bacterial surface by serum factors activate the classical and lectin
  complement pathways by interacting with C1 and MASP-2, which individually leads
  to the downstream events such as C4-cleavage and C3-deposition. The infection-inflammation
  condition triggers the CRP∶ficolin interaction, through which two autonomous amplification
  pathways emerge to boost antimicrobial activity of the classical (black upward arrow)
  and lectin-mediated (bold black upward arrow) complement pathways: (1) Amplification
  pathway 1 (blue arrow): PC→CRP→L-ficolin→MASPs→C4→C3→MAC; (2) Amplification pathway
  2 (brown arrow): GlcNAc→L-ficolin→CRP→C1q,r,s→C4→C3→MAC.'
