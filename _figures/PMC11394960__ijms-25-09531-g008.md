caption: 'Contribution of miRs/target genes involved in the innate immune and inflammatory
  response pathway in the lungs in Lagovirus europaeus infection. In the lungs, reduced
  miR-223 expression levels results in increased expression of TLR4 (Spearman’s rank
  correlation Rho: −0.7, p = 0.025 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.95,
  p < 0.001 for GI.2), IKKα (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.87, p < 0.001 for
  GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.2) and NLRP3 (Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.69, p = 0.025 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.92, p < 0.001 for GI.2). Increased miR-146a expression inhibits the IRAK1
  and TRAF6 target genes (IRAK1—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.86, p = 0.001
  for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.7, p = 0.02 for GI.2, TRAF6—Spearman’s
  rank correlation Rho: −0.63, p 0.048 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho:
  −0.96, p < 0.001 for GI.2). In the case of the liver and kidney, we did not observe
  an inhibitory effect of miR-155 on the TAB2 target gene during L. europaeus/GI.1
  and GI.2 infection'
