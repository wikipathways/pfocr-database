caption: Figure 3. Okazaki fragment processing by Pol δ4 and Pol δ3. This diagram
  summarizes the reactions of Pol δ4 and Pol δ3 with Fen1 in the reconstituted system
  for Okazaki fragment processing. Panel I (blue) shows the operation of the short
  flap pathway. In reaction “1”, Pol δ extends the primer until it meets a 5′ downstream
  primer. Pol δ4 performs limited strand displacement to create short flaps of 1–10
  nts (“2”) that are cleaved by Fen1 (“3”). This process is iterated to leave a nick
  that is sealed by DNA ligase. Panel II illustrates the operation of the nick translation
  pathway. In reaction “1”, Pol δ3 extends the primer until it meets a 5′ downstream
  primer. Pol δ inserts just 1 or 2 nts (“3”) that represent insertions due to the
  fraying/dissociation of the 5′ end of the blocking oligonucleotide (strand opening).
  Pol δ3 does not perform significant strand displacement. The cleavage of the short
  flap leads to the formation of mainly 1 nt products. Multiple iterations of reactions
  “2” and “3” lead to the stepwise movement of the nick 1 nt at a time, viz., a nick
  translation reaction.
