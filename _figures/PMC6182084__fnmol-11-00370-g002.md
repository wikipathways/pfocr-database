caption: 'miRNA and ceRNA hierarchies in cross-regulations. (A) miRNA target-site
  efficacy, from strong to weak, follows this order: 8mer > > 7mer-m8 > 7mer-A1 >
  > 6mer > no site. In this cartoon, the seed region flanking the sequence position
  2–7 is shown in black. In a 6mer site, a 6-nt sequence match exists between the
  seed region of the miRNA and the target mRNA. Similarly, a 7mer-A1 site contains
  a 7-nt seed match with an A at position 1 on the target, whereas a 7mer-m8 site
  contains a paired N at position 8. An 8mer site contains an 8-nt seed match with
  both an A at position 1 and a paired N at position 8. (B–F) miRNA/ceRNA abundance
  and MRE types. ceRNA cross-regulation reaches optimal effectiveness when miRNA and
  ceRNA targets are present in almost equimolar amounts (B); ceRNA regulation is negligible
  when the abundance of the miRNA is substantially greater than that of the ceRNA
  targets (C), and vice versa (D); ceRNA regulatory power is increased when a ceRNA
  targets ≥ 2 miRNAs whose downstream ceRNA targets are involved in producing the
  same effect in a pathway (E); ceRNA regulation is strongly affected when an miRNA
  sponge or a circRNA contains multiple seed-sequence matching sites for an miRNA
  (F). (G) Competition for RISC components. Ago abundance is one of the rate-limiting
  factors in ceRNA regulation, and miRNAs and siRNAs compete for RISC and RISC components
  such as Ago and Dicer. (H,I) Advanced ceRNA hierarchy strategies. Certain miRNAs
  directly control the biogenesis of other miRNAs and ncRNAs (H); for example, nuclear
  miR-709 targets pri-miR-15a/16-1, and the ATXN7-miR-124 loop controls pri-miR-124
  transcription. miRNAs can also selectively control degradation (H); for instance,
  ciRS-7 can bind to as many as 74 miR-7s without degradation being triggered, whereas
  miR-671 targets ciRS-7 for degradation. ncRNAs can compete with miRNAs by masking
  the miRNA seed regions on a ceRNA target, as well as by stabilizing the ceRNA target
  (I).'
