caption: Sfp1 is related to the Tor1 signaling pathway and plays a role in the induction
  of RP and Ribi gene expression. Moreover, during the regulation of adhesin gene
  expression and biofilm formation, the small GTPase Rhb1 coordinates with Tor1 to
  function upstream of Sfp1, while the transcription factors Bcr1 and Efg1 function
  downstream of Sfp1.
