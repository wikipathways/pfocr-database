caption: In the absence of Hh-ligands, Patched (Ptch, the receptor for Hh ligands)
  inhibits its co-receptor Smoothened (Smo), restricting Smo in endocytic vesicles
  at the base of the primary cilium where it is unable to activate the Glioma (Gli)
  family transcription factors, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which are enriched in the top
  of this organelle. In this state, Gli proteins undergo phosphorylation by several
  kinases (PKA, GSK3, CSK), become ubiquitinated and are targeted to the proteasome
  where Gli1 and 2 are degraded and Gli3 is processed to a repressor (GliR), which
  then migrates to the nucleus and represses Hh-regulated genes. B) Binding of Hh
  ligands to Ptch induce its endocytation and permits Smo to migrate to the tips of
  primary cilia, where it inhibits the kinases (PKA, GSK3, CSK) and promotes Gli1,
  2 and 3 activation; the activated Glis then enter the nucleus and induce transcription
  of Hh-target genes. C) When Schistosoma mansoni eggs are trapted in small portal
  tracts in the liver, they elicit a inflammatory response. The live myracid inside
  the egg produce a series of substances (SEA) that induce the production of Hh-ligands
  (Ihh and Shh) by marcophages. Those ligands act autocrinally inducing the alternative
  activation of macrophages and act as chemoattractants for monocytes. Hh-ligands
  derived from macrophages acts paracrinally on quiescent stellate cells (HSC) activating
  them to became myofibroblastic HSC that produce extracellular matrix and also secrete
  Hh-ligands. Hh also plays a important role in the vascular remodeling characteristic
  of schistosomiais, inducing activation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and
  angiogenesis.
