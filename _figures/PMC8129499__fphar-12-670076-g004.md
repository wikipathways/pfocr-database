caption: Mito-ROS signaling and cellular effects in MetS. Mito-ROS, produced mainly
  by ETC (mainly C I and C III) during oxidative phosphorylation and enzymes like
  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), provide the signaling to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome
  oligomerization with adaptor protein ASC and pro-caspase-1. NLRP3 activation can
  be primed by TLRs (step 1) to activate NF-κB or a non-NF-κB pathway to produce pro-
  IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Step 2 occurs when active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to produce mature cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Mito-ROS also induce the formation
  of AGE, as a DAMP to activate NLRP3; mDNA also activates NLRP3 inflammasomes as
  a DAMP. Additionally, Mito-ROS trigger responses to hypoxia, activating HIF-1, and
  upregulate proinflammatory genes like TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, MCP-1, and PAI-1.
  These cytokines activate the insulin signaling pathway and induce local and systemic
  insulin resistance (not shown). PDC is an important source of mitochondrial ROS,
  resulting in activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes as a DAMP. For simplicity and clarity,
  only part of signaling and cellular effects in macrophages are illustrated. AGE,
  advanced glycation end-products; ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD), CI, ETC complex I; CII, ETC complex II; CIII, ETC complex III; CIV, ETC
  complex IV; CV, ETC complex V; ETC, electron transport chain; IL, interleukin; iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase; PM, plasma membrane; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
