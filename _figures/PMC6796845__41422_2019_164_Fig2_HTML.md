caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. Extrinsic apoptosis is induced by the
  addition of death receptor ligands or by the withdrawal of dependence receptor ligands.
  CASP8 and CASP10 initiate death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis, whereas CASP9
  initiates the withdrawal of dependence receptor ligand-mediated extrinsic apoptosis.
  Pro-CASP8 and pro-CASP10 are enzymatically inactive until they interact with FADD
  (Fas-associated via death domain), which is activated upon binding to cell death
  receptors responding to their ligands. DNA damage, hypoxia, metabolic stress, and
  other factors can induce intrinsic apoptosis, which begins with MOMP and leads to
  the release of mitochondrial proteins (e.g., CYCS) into the cytosol. Cytosolic CYCS
  interacts with APAF1, which recruits pro-CASP9 to form the apoptosome. MOMP is tightly
  controlled by the BCL2 family, including its pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members.
  CASP3, CASP6, and CASP7 are considered the common effector caspases for both extrinsic
  and intrinsic apoptosis. In addition, the extrinsic pathway can trigger intrinsic
  mitochondrial apoptosis through the generation of truncated BID (tBID) by activated
  CASP8. tBID can further translocate to mitochondria and cause MOMP through the activation
  of BAX and BAK1
