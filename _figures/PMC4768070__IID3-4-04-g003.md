caption: 'BST‐2 in viral infection: BST‐2 tethers viruses to the cell membrane and
  to each other (1) and (2). Tethered viruses may be internalized through clathrin
  coated pits mediated by the YXY motif on BST‐2''s cytoplasmic tail (CT). Virus tethering
  by BST‐2 also induces the activation of NF‐κB through BST‐2''s YXY motif which interacts
  with TRAF and requires Ubc13, Tab1, Tab2, and TAK1 (1). NF‐κB activation induces
  the expression of cytokines, such as CXCL10 and Il‐6 and may induce the expression
  of BST‐2 since the BST‐2 promoter contains elements for NF‐κB binding (1). In the
  early endosome (EE), TLRs recognize different viral factors and induce the expression
  of cytokines, chemokines and several antiviral factors that contain IFN‐sensitive
  response elements (ISRE) on their promoter (3). Signaling through TLRs regulates
  BST‐2 in a positive and/or a negative manner (3). BST‐2 tethering is also required
  for the induction of antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) which in turn
  induces the degranulation of effector cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells,
  through the FcγIIIA receptors (4). Viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize
  BST‐2. The best studied BST‐2 antagonist is Vpu which interacts with BST‐2 at the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trans‐Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes. Vpu sequesters
  BST‐2 at all of these sites. Vpu can also prevent anterograde transport of BST‐2
  from the ER to the TGN, and prevent BST‐2 recycling from TGN to the plasma membrane
  (5). Vpu also promotes BST‐2 degradation (Degrad) through the lysosomal pathway
  (Lys = lysosome) (6). BST‐2 is a ligand for ILT7 (immunoglobulin‐like transcript
  7) at least in plasmacytoid dendritic (pDC) cells. Engagement of ILT7 by BST‐2 represses
  IFNα expression which in turn can induce BST‐2 levels (7).'
