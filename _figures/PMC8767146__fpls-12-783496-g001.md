caption: 'Capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway (). Schematic representations of the subcellular
  locations of the main steps involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. The convergence
  of two pathways is required- the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads formation
  of vanillylamine, and the branched chain fatty acid pathway, which forms the 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA;
  the two final compounds are condensed by capsaicinoid synthase to form capsaicin.
  Abbreviations: ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; AMT, aminotransferase; BCAT, branched-chain
  amino acid aminotransferase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA
  ligase; COMT, caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; CS, capsaicinoid synthase; FatA,
  acyl-ACP thioesterase; HCHL, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase lyase; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase.'
