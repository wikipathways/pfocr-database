caption: 4CL, 4-Coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHR, chalcone reductase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; HID, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase.
  In the enzyme complex, GmIFS2 serves as the scaffold enzyme, while GmCHS7, GmCHR5
  and GmCHI1B1 interact with GmIFS2. The biosynthetic pathway branches into two competing
  pathways, i.e., deoxyisoflavonoid pathway (orange) and isoflavonoid pathway (yellow)
