caption: Superimposing mTOR signaling subgraphs from KEGG and WikiPathways. A deeper
  analysis performed using PathMe Viewer to visualize mTOR signaling subgraphs can
  be seen highlighting interactions present in a KEGG only and b KEGG and WikiPathways.
  The contribution of WikiPathways onto the pathway found in KEGG is highlighted in
  orange. Neither agreements nor discrepancies in topology are noted between these
  subgraphs though there are overlapping genes (e.g., mTOR, RICTOR, EIF4EBP1, etc.).
  Instead, subgraph a) is complemented by additional interactions superimposed onto
  the network, as visualized in subgraph b)
