caption: Between two asymmetric AWC olfactory neurons, only AWCON regulates peripheral
  lipid metabolism. In response to specific environmental odors, this olfactory neuron
  signals through a specific downstream neural circuit and neuroendocrine signaling
  pathway (conserved components in mammals are indicated) to directly control lipid
  homeostasis in peripheral metabolic tissues. DCV, dense core vesicles.
