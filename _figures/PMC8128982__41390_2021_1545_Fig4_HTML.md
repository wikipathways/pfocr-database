caption: a The early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is devoid of any immune response.
  As the disease progresses to the late phase, owing to its superantigenic property,
  the virus evades destruction by phagocytes. The mass proliferation of the virus
  subsequently triggers dysregulated activation of macrophages and initiates a hyperimmune
  response mediated by helper T cells. This subsequently leads to a tremendous efflux
  of IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-12, LAMP-1, IFNGR2, and CD244. The humoral response, mediated
  by the proliferation of B1 or B2 cells leads to the overproduction of antibodies
  (IgG, IgA, Anti-La, aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase). The antigen-antibody complexes,
  thus formed mediates a Type III hypersensitivity reaction resulting in further activation
  of mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages, secretion of CD54 (ICAM-1), CD64 (FcγR1),
  CD16+ monocytes, and activation of complement pathways. At the same time, there
  is a decrease in levels of CD56 bright and CD56 dim NK cells, pCDc, mDC1 and non-classical
  monocytes. The resultant inflammatory milieu causes protease-mediated endothelial,
  mesothelial, and epithelial inflammation with subsequent tissue damage leading to
  systemic symptoms. b Depicting the pathogenesis of the most commonly encountered
  organ systems involved in MIS-C. Gastrointestinal symptoms, attributed mostly to
  mucosal chemotaxis, are mediated by CCL20 and CCL28. This leads to elevation of
  the several inflammatory markers in blood like MUC4, MUC15, and FOLH1. Cardiac symptoms
  are attributed to inflammatory mediators of endothelial dysfunction such as P2RX4,
  ECE2, CLEC14A, and VEGFA. c Delineates the role of STING (stimulator of interferon
  gene) pathway. Transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), located in chromosome 5q31.2,
  a ~7-kb-long gene encodes the STING protein. STING can be activated by cytosolic
  DNA (damaged self-DNA) and RNA viruses leading to activation of NFκß, IRF-3, and
  subsequently overproduction of interferon ß and cytokines. This results in STING-associated
  vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) like manifestations characterized by fever,
  rash, pulmonitis, myositis, lymphopenia, inflammatory vasculopathy, and rarely acral
  necrosis. d Role of STING pathway in SARS-CoV pathogenesis in the early phase “During
  its early phase of SARS-CoV was shown to cause downregulation of the STING pathway
  through nsp3, nsp 16”. e While the role of the STING pathway in the early phase
  of SARS-CoV-2 infections remains unknown, COVID-19, in its late phase, leads to
  excessive upregulation of STING protein which results in massive stimulation of
  NF-κß and IRF-3, thereby causing a huge surge in the levels of interferon ß and
  cytokines. f The human tissues expressing STING protein include alveoli of the lung,
  endothelial cells, and spleen. g Depicts the various polymorphisms of TMEM173 gene.
