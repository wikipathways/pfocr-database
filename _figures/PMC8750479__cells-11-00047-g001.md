caption: The schema for the construction of KANPHOS. (A) Schematic representation
  of the Kinase-Interacting Substrate Screening (KISS). In KISS method, rodent brain
  lysates were extracted and incubated with specific kinase-tag beads and ATP. The
  bound proteins were subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS/MS) to identify the phosphorylated proteins and their phosphorylation sites.
  (B) Schematic representation of the Kinase-Oriented Substrate Screening (KIOSS)
  method. In KIOSS method, mouse coronal brain slices were treated with specific kinase
  activator/receptor agonist or kinase inhibitor/receptor antagonist to stimulate
  a specific signaling pathway and then incubated with GST tag pS/T binding domain
  (such as 14-3-3ζ) to enrich phosphoproteins. The bound proteins were subjected to
  LC-MS/MS to identify the phosphorylated proteins and their phosphorylation sites.
  (C) In addition to our own developed phosphoproteomic method, data were also manually
  curated from the literature and protoarray.
