caption: The arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus contains two main sets of neurons
  that either express the neuropeptide pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or co-express agouti-related
  protein (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Both sets of neurons express leptin receptors
  (OBRs) and insulin receptors (IRs). Leptin acts on POMC neurons, and the effect
  of these actions on glucose production is partially mediated by melanocortin receptor
  4 (MC4R) neurons in extra-arcuate sites (for example, the paraventricular nucleus).
  Insulin acts on NPY–AGRP neurons and at least partially on POMC neurons to regulate
  hepatic glucose production; this effect is independent of MC4Rs. Leptin and insulin
  actions on POMC neurons have additive effects on the regulation of hepatic glucose
  production, possibly because they act on different POMC populations within the ARC
  (not shown). In addition, insulin actions on neuronal populations of currently unknown
  phenotype result in the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, mammalian
  target of rapapmycin (mTOR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)
  to regulate hepatic glucose production. Leptin acts on PPARγ to regulate food intake,
  but it is unknown whether this pathway also regulates glucose homeostasis. Thus,
  leptin and insulin signalling in the ARC use both divergent and overlapping circuits
  and mechanisms.
