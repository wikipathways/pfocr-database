caption: 'Adaptive immunity in cancer therapy. Humoral immunity: APCs take up and
  present antigens by MHC II molecules to activate CD 4+ T cells; CD4+ T cells present
  antigens to B cells, resulting in the secretion of antigen-specific antibodies;
  antibodies associate with antigens and co-precipitate for digestion by macrophages
  or induce ADCC effect mediated by NK cells. Cellular immunity: cancer cells are
  engulfed by APCs; APCs cross-present antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells by MHC I molecules,
  which is accompanied by CTLA-4 expression on primed CD8+ T cells; primed CD8+ T
  cells recognize cancer cells via an MHC I/antigen complex and kill cells via the
  perforin, granzyme and Fas/FasL pathway; however, the association of CTLA-4 or PD-1
  with their ligands can induce the dysfunction of primed CD8+ T cells.'
