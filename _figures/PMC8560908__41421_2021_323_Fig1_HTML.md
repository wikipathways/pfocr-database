caption: Canonical (left panel) and non-canoncial (right panel) pathway. Positive
  regulations of NF-κB signaling by ARTD family members are depicted in green, while
  negative effects of ARTDs on the signaling pathway are shown in red. Solid lines
  indicate the contribution of ADP-ribosylation to the regulation of NF-κB signaling.
  In case the contribution of ADP-ribosylation was not described or the protein itself
  rather than its enzymatic activity is involved in the regulation, the interactions
  are represented by dashed lines.
