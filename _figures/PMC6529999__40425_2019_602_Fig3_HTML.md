caption: Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) and Tolerogenic Cell Death (TCD). Immunogenic
  cell death can be induced by a variety of mechanisms that are still being defined,
  including low dose radiation, low dose chemotherapy, oncolytic viruses and others.
  ICD triggers translocation or release of DAMP factors from the dying cell in distinct
  spatiotemporal patterns that shape the subsequent immune response. DAMPs engage
  with receptors on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and, in combination with tumor-associated
  antigens and type I IFN, trigger APC activation, maturation, and trafficking to
  draining lymph nodes. This process can be augmented with TLR agonists in some instances.
  Once in the lymph node, APCs engage with cognate T cells and drive T cell activation
  and proliferation. T cells then traffic to the tumor via CXCL9/10/11 gradients induced
  by type I IFN signaling in tumor cells, which can result in rapid tumor elimination
  and generation of long term protective immune memory. In contrast, TCD including
  most forms of apoptosis is a non-inflammatory pathway for cell death which is characterized
  by membrane blebbing and loss of DAMP secretion, with sequestration of high-mobility
  group protein 1 (HMGB1) and phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface. Consequently,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 and TNF are not released to activate endothelium
  and recruit other T cells. Ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 degrade ICD-associated
  ATP to adenosine thereby inhibiting T and NK cell responses with expression of the
  A2A adenosine receptor (ADORA2A). This mechanism is used by regulatory T cells (Treg)
  and inhibits T cell effector function. An immunosuppressive environment characterized
  by enhanced myeloid derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells is established
  while T cells fail to activate and form a productive immune response
