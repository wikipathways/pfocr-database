caption: Diagram of CD4 T cell differentiation and immunomodulation by the AhR signaling
  pathway. (A) Summary of the major sets of CD4 T cells, including critical differentiation
  factors for fate determination, characteristic transcription factors, their unique
  products and some of their functions; (B) AhR signaling pathway involved in the
  differentiation of CD4 helper T cell subsets. Immune homeostasis in mammals is precisely
  controlled by internal humoral factors and neuro-regulation. When disturbed by environmental
  and physiological factors or by pathogens, homeostasis will be destroyed, and the
  resulting immune imbalance promotes inflammatory autoimmune diseases. The AhR signaling
  pathway can promote Treg cell differentiation, decrease effector T cells, especially
  the Th17 cell subset, directly or indirectly and in a ligand-specific manner.
