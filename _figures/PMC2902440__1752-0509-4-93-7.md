caption: Key pathway involved in MODY diabetes. The pathway components highlighted
  in red illustrate that the basic network structure is of type 1.c, with a subnet
  of type 1.c embedded in a larger network of the same type. The disease type that
  results from haploinsufficiency of each gene is shown in parentheses.
