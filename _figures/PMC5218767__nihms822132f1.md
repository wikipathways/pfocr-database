caption: Defective Treg cell suppressive mechanisms in IPEX and IPEX-like disorders.
  Shown are key pathways for maintaining Treg cell homeostasis and function highlights
  human monogenic defects that lead to severe immune dysregulation due to altered
  Treg cell function. The engagement between IL-2 and IL-2R and the initiation of
  signal transduction through Stat5b phosphorylation are important for FOXP3 expression.
  While FOXP3 deficiency leads to IPEX, loss of function mutations in IL2Rα or STAT5b
  manifest with IPEX like phenotype. LRBA-CTLA4 pathway is indispensible for Treg
  cell suppressive activity. LRBA controls CTLA4 expression and the later provides
  a negative feedback both directly by competing CD28 for binding to CD80/CD86 ligands
  and indirectly by down-regulating the co-stimulatory molecules on APCs. Both LRBA
  and CTLA4 deficiency cause IPEX-like disorder.
