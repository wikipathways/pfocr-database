caption: Conceptual framework of BCL-xL expression during persistent LPS senescence
  induction. Persistent cholangiocyte stress results in the activation of NRAS and
  subsequently the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. ETS1 is up-regulated, phosphorylated,
  and translocates to the nucleus. In previous work we demonstrated that pharmacologic
  inhibition of Ras/MEK/ERK (manumycin A, PD98059, or UO126) and molecular inhibition
  of ETS1 (Ets1-shRNA) or genetic deletion of ETS1 prevents p16INK4a transcription
  and senescence (). Here, we demonstrate that ETS1 recruits the histone acetyltransferase,
  p300, to the BCL-xL proximal promoter, resulting in H3K27ac, BCL-xL transcription,
  and ultimately senescence-associated apoptosis resistance, likely via sequestration
  of BAK and BAX and prevention of MOMP.
