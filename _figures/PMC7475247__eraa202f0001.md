caption: Histone deacetylases in signaling cascades. (A) Histone deacetylases in temperature
  response. (1) HFR1 associates with HDA15 to repress thermal-responsive genes. Warm
  temperatures induce PIF4 to compete with HFR1 and inhibit the association of HDA15
  at thermal-responsive genes. (2) At warm temperatures, the HDA9–PWR–HOS15 complex
  induces hypoacetylation at the YUCCA8 locus and facilitates the eviction of histone
  variant H2A.Z, resulting in a permissive chromatin environment. (3) At normal temperatures,
  HOS15, CBFs, and HD2C form a repressive complex targeting COR genes. Cold temperatures
  induce HD2C degradation by the HOS15-mediated proteasome pathway. (B) Histone deacetylases
  in bacterial pathogen response. (1) Bacterial infection induces the expression of
  WRKY53, which recruits the HDA9–PWR–HOS15 complex to suppress expression of NLR
  genes and leaf senescence genes. (2) Bacterial infection induces salicylic acid
  (SA) production and WRKY38/62 expression. WRKY38/62 recruits HDA19 to fine-tune
  basal defense responses. (3) Upon recognition of bacterial flagellin at the cell
  surface, the protein kinase MPK3 phosphorylates HD2B. Phosphorylated HD2B re-localizes
  from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and modulates transcriptome alteration and
  epigenome reprogramming. (C) Histone deacetylases in light signaling. (1) Under
  dark conditions, HDA15 associates with PIF3 and PIF1 to mediate H3 and H4 deacetylation
  and repress the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic/photosynthetic and seed germination
  genes. In light conditions, PIFs are phosphorylated and degraded, releasing HDA15
  from chromatin and transcriptional repression of these genes. (2) In light, HY5
  and NF-YCs interact with HDA15 at the promoters of auxin biosynthetic and signaling
  genes (e.g. IAA19) and cell wall organization-related genes (e.g. XTH17) to inhibit
  expression. (3) Under light, HY5 interacts with HDA9 at ATG5 and ATG8e loci to inhibit
  cell autophagy. Darkness and nitrogen deficiency induce HY5 degradation to release
  the inhibition on ATG5 and ATG8e, leading to induction of autophagy. (D) Histone
  deacetylases in hormone signaling. (1) In the absence of auxin, the repression of
  auxin-responsive genes by Aux/IAA–TPL/TPR requires deacetylation by HDA19. Auxin
  induces Aux/IAA protein degradation and thus releases the transcription factors
  ARFs. (2) BR promotes the nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity of BES1
  and BZR1. BES1/BZR1 recruits the TPL/TPR–HDA19 complex via the EAR motifs to repress
  the expression of BR-repressed genes. (3) In the absence of JA, JAZ and NINJA interact
  with TPL/TPR, which further recruits HDA19 and HDA6 for histone deacetylation and
  transcriptional repression. In the presence of JA, JAZ is degraded, releasing MYC-mediated
  transcription repression. (4) High levels of ABA promote the interaction between
  MYB96 and HDA15 to induce H3 and H4 hypoacetylation and regulate ABA-repressed genes
  (e.g. ROP genes). (5) Ethylene promotes the nuclear import of EIN2-C to facilitate
  its interaction with ENAP1–SRT1/2 to attenuate H3K9ac in ethylene-repressed genes.
  Ethylene stabilizes the transcription factors EIN3/EIL1, which are repressed by
  JAZ and HDA6. JA-induced JAZ degradation releases the repression of ethylene-responsive
  genes. (E) Histone deacetylases in the circadian clock. HDA6 and LDL1/2 interact
  with CCA1/LHY to repress the expression of TOC1 in the morning. During the daytime,
  PPR5/7/9 recruit TPL/TPR and HDA6/19 to repress CCA1/LHY expression. In the evening,
  the Evening Complex (EC) interacts with HDA9 and HOS15 to repress TOC1 and GI expression.
  At nighttime, HDA6 and LDL1/2 interact with TOC1 to repress the expression of CCA1/LHY.
