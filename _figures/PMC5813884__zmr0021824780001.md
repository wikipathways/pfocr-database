caption: 'Regulation of the SPS sensor system. The SPS sensor system is composed of
  three membrane proteins: Ssy1, Ptr3, and Ssy5. In the system, Ssy1 senses and is
  stimulated by extracellular amino acids. The signal transduces via Ptr3 and promotes
  the interaction between Ssy1 and Yck1/2. As a result, Ptr3 and the inhibitory prodomain
  of Ssy5 are hyperphosphorylated by Yck1/2. Next, the phosphorylated prodomain of
  Ssy5 is further ubiquitylated with the help of SCFGrr1, which, consequently, induces
  its degradation by the 26S proteasome. The resulting cat domain of Ssy5 activates
  Stp1 and Stp2 by digesting their negative regulatory domains at their N termini.
  Processed Stp1 and Stp2 translocate into the nucleus and activate their target genes
  by binding their promoters. Another group of transcriptional activators, Uga35/Dal81,
  which are also activated by the SPS sensor system, facilitate the binding of Stp1
  and Stp2 to the promoters of related genes. However, the SPS sensor-dependent nuclear
  translocation of Stp1 and Stp2 is not strict. Low levels of preprocessed Stp1 and
  Stp2 can still “leak” into the nucleus (dashed line) and activate SPS-regulated
  genes with the help of Dal81. However, this pathway is blocked by the Asi protein.'
