caption: Mascareñas reported a highly regioselective Au-catalyzed intermolecular [2
  + 2] cycloaddition of allenamide 441 with various alkenes 442 for the synthesis
  of cyclobutanes 443 (). Most critically, these authors found that when using enamides
  as reacting partners, both (E) and (Z) isomers of enamides 442e and 442f generated
  single trans-stereoisomer as shown in 443e and 443f, respectively, thereby suggesting
  a stepwise cationic pathway. Intermolecular nucleophilic interception of the Au-allyl
  cation species 444 by the alkene would form a second cationic intermediate 445.
  The formation of the more stabilized benzylic or N-acyl iminium cation (when using
  cyclic or acyclic enamides) should lead to the observed regioselectivity, while
  rotation around the σC-C bond would result in the loss of original alkene stereochemical
  information. A final allenamide nitrogen atom-assisted ring-closing process followed
  by elimination and regeneration of the Au complex would furnish [2 + 2] adduct 443.
