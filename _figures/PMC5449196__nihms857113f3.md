caption: Benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in poppy. Poppy synthesizes a variety
  of different benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, including noscapine, codeine and morphine.
  The first committed step of the noscapine pathway (boxed) is the conversion of (S)-scoulerine
  to (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine by PSMT1. The enzymes encoded by the genes within the
  noscapine cluster are indicated in red. The gene for one of the noscapine pathway
  steps (tetrahydroprotoberberine cis-N-methyltransferase; TNMT) is not represented
  within the cluster. Unlike the rest of the pathway genes, TNMT is present and expressed
  in HN1, HT1 and HM1 poppy varieties and so is likely to have other functions in
  addition to its role in noscapine biosynthesis (). The P450 oxidoreductase fusion
  protein STORR, which catalyses the first step in morphinan biosynthesis in poppy
  – the conversion of (S)-reticuline to (R)-reticuline – is indicated in purple.
