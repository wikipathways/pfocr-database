caption: Left quadrant, shows the schematic representation of the role of SLAMF3 as
  negative regulator of MAPK / mTOR pathway. In HCC hepatocyte, the rate of SLAMF3
  is lowered. In this cell, the triggered signals by growth factors through their
  specific receptors activate signalization pathways, including the MAPK pathway,
  which will be constitutively active. This pathway stimulates, among others, the
  expression of certain resistance transporters such as MRP-1 that are responsible
  for the resistance to chemotherapies molecules. The MAPK pathway also modulates
  the formation of the nuclear complex RB / E2F, whose target genes are among that
  regulating the cell cycle and mitosis such as Plk-1. The resultant of these pathways
  activation state are enhanced cell proliferation, unblocked cell cycle and apoptosis
  escape leading to the progression of the tumor mass. Right quadrant, represents
  the hypothetic therapeutic model of SLAMF3 in HCC. The restoration of a high expression
  of SLAMF3 induced a down phosphorylation of MAPK ERK and mTOR. First, the strong
  expression of SLAMF3 reduced phosphorylation ratio of RB permitting its binding
  to the E2F factor which induces its inhibition. The decreased Plk-1 expression,
  one important E2F target is implicated in the inhibition of mitosis induced by the
  high expression of SLAMF3. Second, the high expression of SLAMF3 inhibits expression
  and function of MRP-1, that sensitize the cancer cell to drugs. Finally, the high
  expression of SLAMF3 in the cancer cell controls proliferation, blocks mitosis and
  sensitizes to apoptosis which controls progression of the tumor mass.
