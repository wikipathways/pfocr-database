caption: Protein regulatory network indicates importance of ISGylation pathway in
  TLR7-mediated activation of pDC. Protein-interaction network was generated for expression
  changes in pDC stimulated with 3M-852A and 3M-011 4 hr post-stimulation. The network
  was generated from a group of genes with the GO ontology classification of ubiquitin
  cycle using the shortest path algorithm. The network summarizes interactions between
  the ubiquitin and the ISG15 pathways for protein modification and the genes that
  are altered in expression upon stimulation of pDC with TLR7 agonists. Remaining
  network details are as described in Figure 6.
