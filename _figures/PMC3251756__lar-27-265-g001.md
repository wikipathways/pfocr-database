caption: Genomic pathways of estrogen and EDCs in ER-dependent signaling mechanisms.
  Estrogen and EDCs can lead to cell proliferation in the genomic pathway in which
  ER dimers directly bind to EREs following ligands binding or ERs interact with other
  transcription factors (TFs), including AP-1, by action of transcription factor cross-talk.
  EDCs can compete with estrogen in ERs binding and induce estrogenic effects.
