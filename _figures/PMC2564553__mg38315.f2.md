caption: The alternative pathway of the complement cascade is systematically activated
  at a high level in patients with MPGN II/DDD. Normally, continuous low level activation
  of C3 occurs by spontaneous hydrolysis in a process known as tick over. C3 hydrolysis
  is associated with a large conformational protein change shown at the top of the
  diagram. The conformational change makes C3(H20) similar to C3b, a C3 cleavage product.
  The initial convertase, C3(H2O)Bb, activates C3 to form C3b. Although C3b has a
  fleeting half life, if it binds to IgG, cells, or basement membranes, it is protected
  from immediate inactivation. (C3b)2‐IgG complexes form in the fluid phase and bind
  properdin (P), which facilitates factor B binding and the generation of C3bBb, the
  convertase of the alternative pathway, shown here as a Bb(C3b)2‐IgG‐properdin complex.
  The amplification loop is depicted by the red arrows. C3NeF prolongs the half life
  of C3 convertase (inset). One mechanism to degrade C3 convertase is through its
  interaction with complement factor H, shown at the bottom right. Deficiency of and
  mutations in complement factor H are associated with MPGN II/DDD.
