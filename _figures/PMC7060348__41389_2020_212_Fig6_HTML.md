caption: 'a Our hypothesis regarding the role of P300 in promoting aPKC-ι transcription
  is via binding to Elk1. In this hypothesis model, the luminescence levels of the
  Elk1-MUT and Elk1-MUT + P300-siRNA groups were identical, and lower than NC and
  P300-siRNA groups. Cells transfected with empty vector and a preserved ELK1 binding
  site vector were used as the negative control (NC). b The hypothesis model for the
  role of P300 in promoting aPKC-ι transcription via binding to Elk1 and other transcription
  factors. In this hypothesis model, the brightest luminescence level was in the NC
  group, and the darkest luminescence level was detected in the promoter Elk1-MUT + P300-siRNA
  group. Cells transfected with empty vector and a preserved ELK1 binding site vector
  were used as the negative control (NC). c The hypothesis regulatory network of the
  aPKC-ι signaling pathway in HCC: aPKC-ι-Par6-Rac1-Pak-Mek-Erk signaling axis and
  P300 jointly act on the Elk1 site of the aPKC-ι promoter to promote aPKC-ι transcription.
  TGF-β1 promotes EMT through the phosphorylation of Par6 and the involvement of aPKC-ι.
  aPKC-ι signals to downstream effectors such as Par6, Rac1, Mek, Erk, and NF-kB,
  which are important for tumor invasion, growth and anti-apoptosis. Arrows indicate
  the flow of signaling pathways; dotted arrows indicate potential flow of signaling
  pathways; the red dotted line indicates blocked binding; phosphorylation events
  are indicated by circled pS. See text for discussion and details.'
