caption: A yeast platform for FFA production from lignocellulose by engineering the
  co-utilization of glucose and xylose. We systematically engineered xylose metabolic
  pathway and xylose transportation, and modified multiple global transcription factors
  involved in xylose metabolism to further promote the efficient co-utilization of
  xylose and glucose for FFA production from lignocellulosic biomass
