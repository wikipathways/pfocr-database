caption: Model of the role of mTOR in postnatal islet morphogenesis, maturation and
  function. (Top) Stages of embryonic and postnatal development of the endocrine pancreas.
  mTOR signaling is essential in the first two weeks of postnatal life, the time during
  which endocrine cells undergo morphogenesis into islets and mature into fully functional
  β cells. (Bottom) During postnatal islet development, mTOR signaling is required
  for islet morphogenesis and β-cell maturation. Our data indicate that morphogenesis
  is regulated by both mTORC1 (Raptor) and mTORC2 (Rictor), as a robust phenotype
  is only seen with deletion of both complexes. In addition, both complexes influence
  islet mass. However, mTORC1 is the main complex influencing postnatal islet development.
  mTORC1 signaling is required specifically for the maturation and function of endocrine
  cells within the pancreas and regulates these processes, in part, via Pax6. These
  signals potentiate cellular maturation and functional responses within the cell.
