caption: STAT3 signal transduction pathway. In response to cytokines and growth factors,
  STAT3 is phosphorylated by receptor-associated kinases and then forms homo- or heterodimers.
  STAT3 dimers then translocate to the nucleus where they act as a transcription activator
  and mediate the expression of a variety of genes. STAT3 activates the transcription
  of suppressors of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) which act as classical feedback
  inhibitor of STAT3 activation.
