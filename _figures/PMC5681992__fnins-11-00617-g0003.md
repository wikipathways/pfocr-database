caption: Schematic overview of the bile acid signaling pathways to the central nervous
  system. Bile acids in the intestinal lumen can signal to the central nervous system
  (CNS) via different pathways, in this review we focused on the direct pathway (A),
  the indirect pathway via farnesoid X receptor-fibroblast growth factor 19 (FXR-FGF19)
  signaling (B), and the indirect pathway via Takeda G protein-coupled receptor-glucagon-like
  peptide-1 (TGR5-GLP-1) signaling (C). (A) Bile acids in the intestine escape the
  enterohepatic circulation and reach the systemic circulation. Bile acids need to
  pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to interact with receptors in the brain,
  e.g., FXR and TGR5. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) and chenodeoxy cholic acid (CDCA) have
  been found to interact with gap junction proteins, resulting in a leaky BBB. (B)
  Bile acids taken up by enterocytes can activate the nuclear receptor FXR, which
  results in the release of FGF19. FGF19 is released by the enterocyte and reaches
  the portal vein, a small portion of FGF19 will not be taken up by the liver and
  enters the systemic circulation. FGF19 needs to cross the BBB to interact with FGF
  receptors (1–4) in the brain. The protein β-klotho is necessary for the formation
  of a stable receptor-complex. (C) in the intestine, a specific group of enteroendocrine
  cells, L-cells, produces GLP-1 upon the activation of TGR5 which can be triggered
  by bile acids. GLP-1 is quickly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4,
  not shown), consequently high concentrations of GLP-1 are only found in the lamina
  propria of the intestine. A small portion of intact GLP-1 reaches the portal vein
  and even a smaller portion reaches the systemic circulation. It is questionable
  whether sufficient intact GLP-1 reaches the brain to interact with GLP-1 receptors,
  hence the dashed line. GLP-1 receptors are also expressed on afferent terminals
  of the vagal nerve present in the lamina propria and portal vein. The vagal nerve
  projects to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brainstem, from where
  projections are directed toward other brain regions, e.g. the hypothalamus (the
  vagal-brainstem-hypothalamic pathway).
