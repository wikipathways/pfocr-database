caption: Glucose metabolism pathway. PDH converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which enters
  into Krebs cycle to generate ATP. However, cancer cells have predilection to anaerobic
  glycolysis leading to lactate accumulation. This process is facilitated by overexpression
  of IGF-1, hyperactivation of hexokinase and thiamine deficiency, which are frequently
  observed in the malignancy (CoA, coenzyme A; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex).
