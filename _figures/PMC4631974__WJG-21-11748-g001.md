caption: 'Enzymatic metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acid can generate bioactive
  lipids that induce inflammation, tumorigenesis, and thrombosis, while also generating
  mediators with anti-tumorigenic, pro-resolution properties. In the pro-tumorigenic
  arm, arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to
  generate prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxanes (TxA2). Lipoxygenase (LOX)
  enzymes convert AA to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), which are active on
  their own, or can be further converted to leukotrienes (LTs). In the anti-tumorigenic,
  pro-resolution arm, metabolism of AA through 15-LOX1/2 or acetyl salicylic acid
  (ASA) acetylated COX-2 generates intermediates that can be converted to lipoxins
  (Lxs) through the transcellular activity of other LOXs (5- or 12-LOX). Conversion
  of linoleic acid (LA) to 13(S)-HODE may produce anti-inflammatory effects mediated
  through activation of PPARγ. The fish oils eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
  acid (DHA) may be converted by acetylated COX-2 to pro-resolution mediators E- and
  D- series resolvins (Rvs), respectively. PUFA: Polyunsaturated fatty acid.'
