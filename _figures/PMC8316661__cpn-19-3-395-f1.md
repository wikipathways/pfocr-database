caption: Overview of monoamine’s metabolism. Tyrosin and Tryptophan are metabolized
  into the three monoamines (dopamine, noradrenalin,and serotonin). Tetrahydrobiopterin
  and Tetrahydrofolate are cofactors of the synthesis of L-DOPA and 5-OH tryptophan,
  which are the precursors of Dopamine and serotonin, respectively. Dopamine is catabolized
  into Homovanillic acid, or metabolized into noradrenalin which is transformed into
  3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol. Serotonin is catabolized into 5-hydroxyindolamine
  acetic acid Inflammatory processes influence monoamine’s metabolism by stimulating
  neopterin. IL-1B inhibits BH4, while IDO inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase and stimulates
  the kynurenin pathway. (1) Tyrosine Hydroxylase; (2) Tryptophan Hydroxylase; (3)
  Catecholamine-O-Methyl Transferase (COMT) and Monoamine Oxydase (MAO); (4) 6-Pyruvotetrahydropterin
  Synthase (PTPS) and Sepiapterin Reductase (SR); (5) Aldehyde Deshydrogenase and
