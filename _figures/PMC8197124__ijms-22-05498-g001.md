caption: Schematic representation of the important steps of the IAV life cycle. Recognition
  and attachment (Stage 1). Viral HA (orange) recognizes the terminal α2,6- or α2,3-linked
  NANA residues in glycan of the sialo-containing receptor on the plasma membrane
  and attaches to them. Entry (Stage 2). Virus entry to the host cell via endocytosis.
  Fusion of endosomal and viral membranes and release of viral genome (Stage 3). Once
  inside the acidic endosomal compartment and after the structural rearrangement of
  HA, the lipid bilayers of the virus and endosome fuse, and a pore is formed. Transfer
  to nuclei (Stage 4). Viral genome packed in vRNPs is released into the cytosol through
  the formed pore. Transcription, replication, and assembly (Stage 5). Later, they
  are transferred to the nuclei. Transcription and replication of the IAV genome occur
  at the genomic vRNA in the nuclei. Synthesis and maturation viral proteins (Stage
  6 and 7). v-mRNAs are transported into the cytosol and translated on membrane-bound
  or free polyribosomes. Packaging of vRNPs (Stage 8). Viral proteins that are needed
  in virus assembly (M1, NP, NEP, and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase subunits) return
  to the nucleus to be packaged as vRNPs. Later, they are exported to the cytosol
  and delivered to the plasma membrane. Budding and realizing virus particles (Stage
  9 and 10). Envelope viral proteins (HA, NA, and M2) are synthesized on the rough
  ER and enter the cellular secretory pathway. Here, HA and NA co-translationally
  acquire the N-carbohydrate block, which completes their maturation in the Golgi.
  After that, they are transported via post-Golgi transport machinery to the PM and
  meet the vRNPs. Here, the budding and release of progeny viruses occur. Protein
  M1 assists in the formation of mature virions, using fragments of the lipid bilayer
  and some proteins of the host cell. The viral NA cleaves sialic acid from cell-surface
  glycoproteins and glycolipids, and virions are released.
