caption: Model of the MAPK signaling module organized by arrestin. Front  (A) and
  side (B) views of the three-dimensional model of  arrestin complex with the three
  MAP kinases are shown. Arrestin  (green) is shown as an elongated two-domain molecule.
  All the kinases  are shown with thick cylinders representing kinase domain, and
  thin ones  representing N- and C-terminal elements. MAPKKK (pink) is represented  as
  ASK1 dimer in the JNK3 pathway with its C and kinase domain interacting  with arrestin,
  and MAPK (purple) with its N terminus interacting with  arrestin. MAPKK (yellow)
  also interacts with both domains of  arrestin.
