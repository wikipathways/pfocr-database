caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for inflammatory gene expression in females vs.
  males exposed to filtered air. Diagram of biological networks of selected genes
  whose expression were up- and downregulated at least 1.5-fold in the lungs of females
  vs. males exposed to filtered air (n = 6/group). The diagram shows reported direct
  (solid lines) and indirect (dashed lines) interactions for these genes. Each gene
  or group of gene is represented as a node in green (downregulated) or red (upregulated).
  Network analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (see materials and
  methods for details).
