caption: 'Concerted age-dependent regulation of nucleotide metabolism in BAT. Metabolic
  network representing nucleotide metabolism and integrating age-dependent regulation
  observed in metabolomic, proteomic and mRNA expression data analyses. Dashed line-boxes
  depict different metabolic branches of nucleotide metabolism: purine metabolism,
  pyrimidine metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway. Each oval represents a metabolite
  and each box represents a gene/protein. As shown in the legend, color-coding is
  provided for metabolites, genes and proteins enriched (red) or depleted (blue) during
  BAT-aging. Metabolites whose concentration was not affected by aging in BAT are
  shown in grey. Color-coding of metabolites is based on the log2 fold change (log2FC)
  values calculated in comparison to the young, 2.5-months control group (Supplementary
  Table ). For each protein and gene, age-dependent regulation is represented by the
  same color-coding; genes whose mRNA was not changed during BAT-aging are depicted
  in white boxes. Proteomic changes are based on heavy/light ratios comparing young
  versus aged mice (Table ).'
