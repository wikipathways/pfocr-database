caption: Proposed PAT biosynthetic pathway. PapA3 first acylates the  2-position of
  one of the glucose residues of trehalose with a palmitoyl group  to form T2P. A
  mycolipenoyl group, synthesized by Pks3/4, is then transferred  to the 3-position
  of T2P by PapA3 to generate 2,3-diacyltrehalose.  2,3-Diacyltrehalose may either
  be transported to the cell surface or serve as  a biosynthetic intermediate that
  is further elaborated with mycolipenic acids  to give PAT.
