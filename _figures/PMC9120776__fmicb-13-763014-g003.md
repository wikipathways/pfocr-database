caption: Schematic diagram of the common symbiotic pathway (SYM) of nodulation and
  arbuscular mycorrhizal signals in legumes. The first known molecular component in
  the symbiotic pathway (SYM) signaling pathway is the receptor-like kinase DMI2 of
  M. truncatula (homologous to SYMRK of L. japonicus) (; ). The direct target of DMI2
  is unclear, but it can be determined that the signal is transmitted to the nuclear
  membrane by a secondary messenger. There are three nucleoporins (NUP85, NUP133 and
  NENA) in L. japonicus, which continue to transmit symbiotic signals to the nucleus
  (). There is a recognized cation channel DMI1 on the nuclear membrane, the results
  have confirmed the role of DMI1 in the formation of Ca2+ oscillations, which has
  also been confirmed to participate in the conduction of this signal into the nucleus
  (). In the nucleus, the calmodulin-dependent kinase DMI3 (CCaMK in L. japonicus)
  is responsible for decoding the induced calcium oscillation signal (; ), and then,
  together with IPD3 (homolog of CYCLOPS in L. japonicus) (; ), it takes over the
  upstream signal and activates a set of downstream transcriptional regulators (NSP1,
  NSP2, and RAM1) (; ; ; ), these regulatory factors regulates the expression of genes
  related to nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhiza in the terminal, respectively.
