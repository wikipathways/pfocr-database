caption: 'T1D targets for therapeutic interventions in endocrine cells. β-cell: This
  figure illustrates the key targets for pharmaceutical intervention of oxidative
  stress, glucotoxicity, and apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. (1) Thioredoxin-interacting
  protein (TxNIP) has an important role and the transcription is activated by carbohydrate-response
  element-binding protein (ChREBP) which binds to the TxNIP promotor and mediates
  glucose-induced TxNIP expression. During hyperglycemia, glucose is converted to
  Xu-5-P, with elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ ChREBP is translocated into the nucleus
  and translated into TxNIP. (2) First-generation Ca2+ blockers (diltiazem or verapamil)
  significantly reduce endogenous TxNIP mRNA expression due to the reduction of cytosolic
  Ca2+. The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of ChREBP and binding to DNA are regulated
  by PKA- and AMPK-mediated phosphorylations. Metformin transiently inhibits complex
  I of the electron transport chain in the mitochondrion, leading to inhibition of
  V-ATPase and LKB1-mediated AMPK activation. Activated AMPK directly hinders ChREBP
  at Ser568, prevents cytosol-to-nuclear translocation, and inactivates its DNA-binding
  activity. (4) V-ATPase functions as a sensor switch between AMPK-induced catabolic
  metabolism and mTORC1 anabolic pathways. Activation of mTORC1 is a major increase
  of beta-cell mass by modulation of cyclin D2, D3, and Cdk4 activity. (5) Some PPI
  can also inhibit V-ATPase-Ragulator and induce AMPK-mediated response to ROS. Additionally,
  omeprazole preserves ALDH2 in mitochondria. Activation of ALDH2 in β-cells prevents
  apoptosis, enhances GSIS, and reduces both the mitochondrial and intracellular ROS
  levels. (6) Pharmaceutical interventions with GLP-1RA, GCGR mAbs, and DPP-4i-induced
  GLP-1 elevation stimulate GS-coupled ligands and initiate cAMP-PKA and cAMP-Epac
  signaling, thereby downregulating TxNIP expression levels in hyperglycemic conditions.
  (7) PKA phosphorylates ChREBP at Ser196, which inhibits nuclear import at Thr666,
  which inhibits DNA-binding activity. Downregulation of TxNIP expression reduces
  caspase-1 expression and prevents caspase-induced apoptosis. (8) β-catenin (β-Cat)
  is another pharmaceutical target that can promote proliferation, survival, and function
  of β-cells in diabetic conditions. GLP-1RA activation leads to β-Cat stabilization
  through PKA-mediated phosphorylation. (9) Additionally, Wnt-β-cat and PI3K-AKT-mTORC1
  pathways share a common inhibition target GSK3β and independently can upregulate
  free cytosolic β-cat. (10) In the nucleus β-Cat forms the bipartite transcription
  factor β-cat/TCF with a TCF family member (eg, TCF7L2) upregulating GLP-1R and GIPR
  expression and several proliferative genes, including c-myc and cyclin D1. (11)
  PPI indirectly elevates serum gastrin. (12) Stimulation of G-coupled receptors,
  including gastrin receptor CCK2R, GABABR, Gi/o-GPCR, and insulin receptors activate
  PI3K-AKT pathway leading to activation of mTORC1 and inhibition/mediation of GSK3β,
  caspase-9 and Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad). (13) Expression of functional
  GABABR in human islets is restricted and tightly regulated by elevation in cAMP
  signaling. GABABR is primarily coupled to the Gi/o-GCGR and their activation leads
  to hyperpolarization induced closure of VGCC and insulin secretion. (14) NMDAR inhibition
  with dextromethorphan (DXM) significantly prolongs β-cell depolarization state promoting
  insulin secretion. (15) GCGR mAbs, such as IgG2 mAb volagidemab, bind to the human
  GCGR, and competitively block GCGR interaction with glucagon, thereby reducing cAMP
  and elevating AMPK. GCGR antagonism can improve glycemic control but cause adverse
  events in patients. (16) In β-cells activation of GABAARs with GABA, benzodiazepines,
  barbiturates, neurosteroids, and ethanol leads to Cl- efflux and depolarization,
  opening of VGSC, VGCC, and promoting insulin release. α-cell: (1) Insulin inhibits
  glucagon secretion via insulin-dependent SGLT-2-induced stimulation of somatostatin
  release by δ cells, which downregulate cAMP, activate Gi/o-GPCR and hyperpolarize
  α-cell membrane. (2) Additionally, β-cells secretion of insulin and GABA inhibit
  glucagon secretion via IR activation of PI3K-AKT-dependent membrane assembly and
  activation of GABAAR activity. (3) GABAAR activation with GABA leads to Cl- influx,
  α-cell membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of glucagon secretion. (4) GABA
  and artemisinins can potentially reprogram α-cell into β-like-cell by repression
  or expression of key transcription factors. δ-cell: Somatostatin is a paracrine
  inhibitor of both insulin and glucagon. (1) The δ-cells are electrically excitable,
  and somatostatin secretion depends on SGLT2 activation by (2) insulin and KATP-induced
  depolarization, provided there are extracellular Na+ and elevated glucose levels.
  (3) SGLT2 inhibitors were seen to improve clinical parameters in T1D patients but
  can provoke euglycemic ketoacidosis and increase hepatic glucose production. Pancreatic
  exocrine cells: (1) Gastrin enhances ductal cell transdifferentiation into insulin-producing
  β-like cells. In ductal cells, concurrent administration of gastrin with epidermal
  growth factor or GLP-1RA has been shown to increase the β-cell mass and/or to improve
  glucose tolerance. (2) Exocrine cells are reprogrammed by upregulating gene expression
  of the endocrine progenitor markers including PDX1, and Nkx-6.1, and downregulating
  KRT20 expression present in mature duct cells. (3) In acinar cells, the antiapoptotic
  action of gastrin is mediated by PI3K-AKT, ERK, and MAPK signaling. The exact mechanism
  for transdifferentiation of pancreatic exocrine cells into beta-like cells has not
  been elucidated, but molecular interactions can include gastrin-induced upregulation
  of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like (HB-EGF), transactivation of EGFR,
  PI3K-AKT-mTORC1, and GLP-1-cAMP-PKA signaling cascades'
