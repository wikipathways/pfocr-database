caption: Caveolae are receptor-rich regions of the plasma membrane, populated by multiple
  receptor types including BMPR2 and TGFβ receptors. A delicate balance between BMPR2
  pathway and TGFβ pathway signaling modulates pro-proliferative and apoptotic forces.
  A BMPR2 mutation, or reduced wild-type BMPR2 gene expression, may perturb this balance—perturbation
  may promote PAH pathogenesis. Disruption of caveolae structure or function could
  also disrupt cell signaling by reducing receptor density.
