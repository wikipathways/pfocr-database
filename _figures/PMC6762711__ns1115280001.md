caption: 'The relationship between eyelid conditioning and the circuitry of the cerebellum.
  During eyelid conditioning, mossy fibers (Mossy) convey information about the CS.
  This afferent influences cerebellar nucleus output through direct excitatory connections
  onto the nucleus cells (mf→nuc synapses) and through a more indirect projection
  onto a large number of granule cells (gr→Pkj synapses;Granule) that ultimately results
  in Purkinje (PURK) cell inhibition of nucleus cells (NUC). This indirect pathway
  in the cerebellar cortex also involves two other types of inhibitory interneurons:
  basket cells (Basket), which inhibit Purkinje cells, and Golgi cells (Golgi), which
  inhibit granule cells and are in turn excited by both mossy fibers and granule cells.
  Climbing fibers (CF), which make strong excitatory connections onto the Purkinje
  cells, have been shown to convey information about the US. Finally, increases in
  nucleus cell activity in response to the CS are known to drive the expression of
  conditioned responses. In the simulations, this learning is driven by changes in
  the strength of bothmf→nuc andgr→Pkj synapses.'
