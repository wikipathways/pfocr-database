caption: Translocation and generation of toxic metabolites to the neuroglial circuitry
  mediating cognitive functions. The toxins cause defects in the blood-brain barrier
  leading to increased translocation of more toxic metabolites and proinflammatory
  factors to the brain. These factors (e.g., proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines)
  mediate intracellular signaling that lead to protein and lipid breakdown, mitochondrial
  dysfunction, and disordered transport processes that culminate in neuroinflammation
  and neurodegeneration characterized for dementia and other brain diseases [, ].
  For instance, dysbiosis has been associated with increased circulating neurotoxic
  interleukin mediators, which in turn predispose to the development of neurodegenerative
  diseases [, ]. Furthermore, ageing is associated with increased circulating neurotoxic
  mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein, which can directly cause
  low-grade inflammation, that predispose the individual to the development of dementia
  and other diseases including diabetes []. The microbe-derived amyloids on the membrane
  of neurons, glia, and epithelial cells can stimulate pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) such as TLRs, causing local and possibly systemic inflammation, at least
  in part through their interaction with Peyer patches and other immune components
  of the gut []. Increased production of toxic metabolites by the activities of disordered
  gut microbiota has been implicated in metabolic disorders and local and systemic
  inflammatory responses [, , ]. As part of the toxic metabolites transported to the
  brain, amyloids can initiate a series of intracellular signaling via activation
  of PPRs such as RAGE, resulting in the activation of microglia [] and phagocytosis
  of the amyloids [, ]. The binding of the metabolites or amyloids also initiate downstream
  signaling mediated via NF-κB pathways with resultant activation of the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and
  oxidative stress [, ]. Pathological signaling of proinflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α via the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and
  activators of transcription) pathway in the central nervous system can disorganize
  microtubules via yet unknown mechanisms that lead to dysfunctions of microglia,
  the main immune sentinels of the central nervous system [, , , ]. These microglia
  progressively lose the ability to clear cellular debris including amyloid proteins,
  which further stimulate signaling cascades that culminate in cell death [, ]. In
  the case of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the accumulating amyloid deposits
  provoke an inflammatory response that disorganizes the several protective mechanisms
  that favor neurodegeneration []. In addition, signaling pathways that initiate gene
  transcription such as p38 and other protein kinases are activated []. Furthermore,
  dysfunctions of amyloid peptide-degrading enzymes such as insulysin, neprilysin,
  and matrix metallopeptidase 9 have been reported in an animal model of dementia
  []. All these processes lead to neurodegeneration which favors the development of
  dementia or worsens the progression of the disease [, ]. It should be noted, however,
  that PRRs are regulated by molecules such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLRs) and Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) among others
  [, ]. Toxigenic metabolites that favor the development of dementia and other neurodegenerative
  diseases may cause substantial defects in these regulatory peptides, thereby resulting
  to neuroimmune defects that underlie the development of the disease [, ].
