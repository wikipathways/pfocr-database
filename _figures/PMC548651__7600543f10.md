caption: Schematic representation of the regulatory interactions between the new players
  that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. PAK4 activates LIMK1 and inactivates SSH-1L
  by phosphorylation. SSH also plays a dual role. It dephosphorylates and inactivates
  LIMK1 and dephosphorylates and activates ADF/cofilin, resulting in a net increase
  in ADF/cofilin activity and actin filament turnover. The other players in this pathway
  are F-actin and 14-3-3ζ. F-actin is necessary for SSH-1L activity and the interaction
  of pSSH-1L and F-actin is modulated by 14-3-3ζ. Stimulatory (arrows) and inhibitory
  interactions (blocked lines) are shown.
