caption: Schematic model of IL-1β-stimulated signaling pathways of NF-κB p65, ERK1/2,
  and p38 MAPK, and inhibitory effects of daidzein on NF-κB/ERK1/2 signaling in synovial
  cells. TAK1 is activated by a stimulation with IL-1β, and activated TAK1 phosphorylates
  the IKK. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB in the complex with NF-κB, and phosphorylated
  IκB is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which allows the release and
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB, leading to the transcription of inflammatory cytokine
  genes. Moreover, activated IKK activates Tpl2, which, in turn, activates MKK1/2,
  leading to the activation of ERK1/2. Alternatively, TAK1 activates the p38 MAPK
  pathway via the activation of MKK3 and MKK6. p38 MAPK may also be activated by TAK1
  via the IKK/Tpl2 pathway (dotted line). Since daidzein inhibited the phosphorylation
  of NF-κB p65 and ERK1/2, but not p38MAPK in IL-1β-stimulated MH7A cells, it appears
  to inhibit the TAK1/IKK-mediated activation of NF-κB p65 and ERK1/2, but not the
  TAK1/MKK3/MKK6-mediated activation of p38 MAPK. IKK, IκB kinase; IκB, inhibitor
  of κB. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinases; p38
  MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1; MAPKKK, MAP kinase kinase kinase; IκB, inhibitor of κB; IKK, IκB kinase;
  Tpl2, tumor progression locus 2; MKK and MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase.
