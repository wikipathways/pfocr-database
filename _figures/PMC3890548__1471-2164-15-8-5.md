caption: 'Curation of a metabolic protein family by comparison with conserved domains.
  Left side: a portion of the purine synthesis pathway in the group 1 Clostridia.
  Right side: conserved domain architecture of two purD-purL fusions in the group
  1 Clostridia as computed and displayed by ITEP tools (with minor formatting changes).
  The comparison makes it clear that these two proteins are fusions of purD and purL.
  See list of abbreviations for full compound names. Only hits to conserved domains
  with E-values better than 1E-100 are shown.'
