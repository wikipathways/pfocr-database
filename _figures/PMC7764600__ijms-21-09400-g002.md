caption: 'The most important signaling molecules characterizing EBV + GC. There are
  four main signals known: (1) Gene mutations, mainly affecting the PIK3CA and ARID1A
  genes, which lead to an activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway; (2) activation of the
  tyrosine kinase pathway mainly due to amplification of the MET gene; (3) hypermethylation
  of several genes, in particular, RCOR2 and CDKN2A genes, which leads to the activation
  of cyclases and an increase in the inflammation surrounding the tumor site with
  an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the release of several
  cytokines; and (4) amplification of the chromosome 9p24.1, including the PDCD1L
  1-2 and JAK2 genes.'
