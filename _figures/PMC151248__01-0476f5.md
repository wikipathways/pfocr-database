caption: Possible Roles of GA Response Components.The cellular locations and functions
  of the GA response components discussed in this review are shown. A highly speculative
  order of action for these components also is shown. Although the diagram shows the
  components functioning in a single cell, there is no evidence that this occurs.
  Indeed, some aspects of the response pathway, such as the feedback regulation of
  GA levels, do not occur in all organs. Bioactive GA binds to an as yet unidentified
  GA receptor, directly or indirectly activates second messengers and G proteins (D1),
  and causes PHOR1 to localize to the nucleus and rapid degradation of RGA/GAI. GID1
  is a positively acting component that is required for the degradation of GAI/RGA
  proteins. Although GID1 is shown in the cytosol, the cellular location has not been
  determined. In the nucleus, SPY and KGM inhibit GA responses by GlcNAc, modifying
  or phosphorylating component(s) of the pathway. Several putative transcription regulators
  (SHI, RGA/GAI proteins, GAMYB, PHOR1, and HRT) modify the transcription of genes
  encoding products that either promote or inhibit the GA response. Some of the products
  of these genes may be positive or negative regulators acting in a transcriptional
  cascade that leads to the GA response. The maintenance of chromatin structure by
  PKL is important for the proper expression of genes involved in the response. One
  outcome of the GA response is reduced transcription of GA20ox and GA3ox and enhanced
  expression of GA2ox, which leads to a reduction in the pool of bioactive GA.
