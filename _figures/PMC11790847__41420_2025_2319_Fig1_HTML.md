caption: MST1/2, LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ are the core regulatory components of the Hippo
  signalling pathway. Upon activation of the Hippo pathway, LAST1/2 promotes YAP/TAZ
  phosphorylation, inactivating them. YAP/TAZ act as transcriptional activators and,
  together with TEADs (a pivotal family of transcription factors), promote the transcriptional
  process of multiple downstream target genes, thereby affecting various tumour biological
  processes. The blue arrow indicates that the transcription of the target gene is
  upregulated through specific post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs), whereas
  the red arrow represents transcriptional repression
