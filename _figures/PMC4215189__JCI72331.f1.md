caption: Foods rich in cholesterol and fats are also often rich in the indicated dietary
  nutrients PC (lecithin), choline, and carnitine. Following ingestion, gut microbiota
  can use these nutrients as a carbon fuel source. While mammals do not have the enzyme,
  gut microbes have TMA lyases, which can cleave the C-N bond of these nutrients,
  releasing the TMA moiety as a waste product. Transport via the portal circulation
  brings the TMA to a cluster of hepatic enzymes, the FMOs (particularly FMO3), that
  efficiently oxidize TMA, thus forming TMAO. TMAO enters the circulation, where it
  is predominantly excreted by the kidneys. TMAO has been shown to affect cholesterol
  and sterol metabolism in animal models, enhancing macrophage cholesterol accumulation
  and atherosclerosis development. In multiple human studies, elevated TMAO has been
  independently associated with prevalent CVD and incident risks for MI, stroke, death,
  and revascularization. [O], oxidation.
