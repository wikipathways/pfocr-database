caption: Hypo-nutrition is characterized in tumor microenvironment. Tumors (A) use
  glutamine to fuel alternative forms of metabolism and (B) activate autophagic degradation
  of macromolecules under hypo-nutrition. In (A), glucose deprivation in cancer cells
  stimulates a pathway whereby glutamine carbon is re-routed to acetyl-CoA. In (B),
  autophagy functions in degrading damaged organelles and their macromolecular components
  to provide recycled small molecule nutrients to feed intermediary metabolism under
  hypo-nutrition, and functions to eliminate defective mitochondria, thereby reducing
  ROS accumulation and improving cellular fitness.
