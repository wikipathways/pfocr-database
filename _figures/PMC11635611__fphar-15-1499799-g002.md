caption: Morphine tolerance-related signaling pathways inside microglia. This figure
  is a speculation of some of the signaling pathways inside microglia based on current
  research. P2X4R and P2X7R activate different downstream signals upon ATP stimulation.
  P2X4R releases BDNF, while P2X7R activates mitochondria and p38 MAPK to increase
  inflammatory cytokine release. Some receptors on microglia such as PDGFRβ, TLR4,
  and EGFR activate different signals downstream after some upstream stimulus. The
  TLR4/p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway was demonstrated early on in morphine tolerance,
  and p38 MAPK in this pathway is crosstalk, which has various upstream signals, not
  only under the regulation of TLR4. Both PDGFRβ and EGFR activate NF-κB through the
  MAPKs family and initiate transcription to increase the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines
