caption: Schematic summary of possible mechanism underlying the protective effects
  of corilagin treatment in APAP-induced liver injury. Corilagin treatment effectively
  protects against APAP-induced liver injury in mice through anti-inflammatory and
  anti-oxidation mechanisms, and by inhibition of ERK/JNK MAPK and NF-κB pathways.
