caption: In SST-expressing neurons, SST and GABA are known to be colocalized and coreleased.
  SST (yellow dots) and GABA (gray dots)-containing vesicles are first delivered to
  the presynaptic terminal and released in a calcium-dependent manner through exocytosis.
  It has been reported that more time and higher calcium levels are needed to release
  SST from SST+ neurons with higher activity than GABA, as SST is usually delivered
  in dense-core vesicles (yellow circles). Furthermore, glutamate (blue dots) released
  from nearby glutamatergic neurons can evoke the release of SST and GABA by activating
  AMPA/NMDA receptors on axon terminals. Released GABA can inhibit GABA release and
  SST release through activation of GABAB autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, respectively.
  Released SST can bind to SSTR subtypes 1–5 expressed on postsynaptic neurons and
  then inhibit calcium influx. This eventually leads to the reduced excitability of
  postsynaptic neurons through a downstream signaling pathway.
