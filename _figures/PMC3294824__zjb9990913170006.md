caption: Model summarizing the light induction pathway for carotenogenesis in M. xanthus.
  Light excites PPIX in the inner membrane (IM) to the high-energy 3PPIX state, which
  interacts with molecular oxygen to generate 1O2. The latter is signaled via CarF
  (an anti-anti-σ factor) to inactivate CarR, the anti-σ of the ECF-σ factor CarQ.
  CarQ, CarR, and CarF are shown as forming a complex with no direct interactions
  between CarQ and CarF (see the text for details). Freed CarQ associates with core
  RNAP, and the corresponding RNAP holoenzyme activates PQRS and PI, the promoters
  of the regulatory carQRS operon and of the carotenogenic crtIb gene, respectively,
  in the presence of other factors not shown for simplicity. CarS, expressed in the
  light from PQRS, counteracts repression of PB by CarA or CarH (in the presence of
  5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, AdoB12) () to drive expression of the carB operon, which
  contains the carotenogenic crtEIaBDC genes. The carA operon, which includes crtYcYd
  (also involved in carotenogenesis), is transcribed from a light-independent promoter
  as well as via transcriptional read-through from PB. In a distinct light-dependent
  pathway, disruption of the photosensitive AdoB12 by light leads to loss of PB repression
  by CarH. Quenching of the high-energy 3PPIX and 1O2 by the carotenoids produced
  in response to light results in photoprotection as well as downregulation of carotenogenesis.
  The chain of events from light to PPIX and then onto 1O2 and CarF is based on this
  study; other elements of the pathway were reviewed in reference . Ovals depict protein
  factors, squat arrows show genes or operons, solid arrows and blunt-ended lines
  indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively, and dotted arrows point
  to the products generated.
