caption: The schematic presentation indicates the suggested mechanisms by which SSd
  induces cognitive dysfunction through inhibiting the survival of hippocampal NPCs.
  This neural damage is through the activation of p75NTR cell death signaling and
  inhibition of TrkB signaling, engaged by disordered BDNF pathway dependent on the
  dysregulation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis
