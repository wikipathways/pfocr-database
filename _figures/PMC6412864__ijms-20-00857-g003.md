caption: Apoptotic signaling during ER stress. Prolonged or severe ER stress conditions
  induce apoptotic signaling through the activation of IRE1 and PERK pathways. Upon
  activation of the IRE1 pathway, IRE1 recruits TRAF2 and ASK1 on the ER membrane
  and this induces the apoptotic response upon modulation of the balance between proapoptotic
  and antiapoptotic genes. Furthermore, IRE1 digests specific miRNAs through its endoribonuclease
  domain (IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA, RIDD). PERK pathway activates ATF4, which
  in turn enhances the transcription of CHOP, a transcription factor responsible for
  the regulation of many proapoptotic genes (i.e., GADD34, ERO1, DR5, TRB3, Bcl-2
  family genes). In this complex scenario, GADD34 and PP1 promote the dephosphorylation
  of eIF2α, leading to enhanced protein synthesis and the increase of protein load
  into the ER.
