caption: Biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10. Schematic showing the pathway of various metabolic
  precursors leading to the formation of the quinone head (PHB), the isoprene tail
  (decaprenyl diphosphate), and the final Coenzyme Q product. Reflected in red are
  the various enzymatic steps that are rate limiting. UbiC and UbiA are specific genes
  from E. coli, and Coq2 is from S. cerevisiae. Unlabelled arrows between chorismate
  and tyrosine and PHB; FPP and decaprenyl diphosphate; and decaprenyl-4-hydrobenzoic
  acid and coenzyme Q10 denote the presence of multiple steps that have been abbreviated
