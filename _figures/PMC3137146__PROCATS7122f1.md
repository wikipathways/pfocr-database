caption: Model of LPS-induced signaling pathway for autophagy as predicted from our
  recent data () and from recent studies. LPSs induce autophagy by stimulation of
  the TLR4-TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-receptor interacting
  protein (RIP) 11 pathway. The signaling components directly downstream of RIP still
  need to be identified. Nevertheless, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required
  for LPS-induced autophagy and for survival. This pathway seems to be in contrast
  to the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated autophagic pathway previously described
  (). Reproduced by permission from Reference 23.
