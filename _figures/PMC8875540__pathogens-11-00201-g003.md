caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for the most frequently differentially
  expressed proteins found in different teleost fishes during NNV infection. This
  is retrieved via API access to the STRING database (https://string-db.org) (accessed
  on 14 January 2022) and was performed based on the Danio rerio protein database.
  Of the 65 proteins, 34 proteins are illustrated, as the rest were not found in the
  Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database of the STRING
  database. Each node represents a differentially expressed protein. Node colors illustrate
  a protein’s involvement in the three significantly enriched biological processes
  identified by Biological Networks Gene Ontology (red nodes, Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway; blue nodes, apoptosis; green nodes, cytokine signaling in the immune system).
  Gray nodes are not associated with any of the significantly enriched biological
  processes. The edges represent protein-protein interactions, and the nature of the
  protein-protein interactions are color-coded, as indicated in the figure.
