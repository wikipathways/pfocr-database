caption: Gab2 interactions with binding partners. Diagram shows generic Gab adapter
  docked at the plasma membrane by the PH domain. Interactions with p85 and SHP-2
  are involved in Akt and Erk activation respectively. Binding of receptor tyrosine
  kinases to their receptive ligands triggers the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic
  domain of the receptor. The receptor becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues.
  Docking proteins such as Grb2 contain SH2 domains that bind to the phosphotyrosine
  residues of the activated receptor. Grb2-Gab interacts through the SH3 domains and
  activates downstream signaling pathways, PI-3K/Akt and SHP2/Erk. Grb-2 can bind
  to SOS via N-terminal SH3 domain while the C-terminal SH3 domains are used for its
  interaction with Gab proteins. SOS-1 has been known to associate with Grb2, leading
  to its autophosphorylation. This complex gets translocated to the activated receptor
  where it then associates with Ras. As Ras gets activated it induces the downstream
  ERK/MAPK pathway. Alternatively, stimuli from growth factors like EGF, VEGF, and
  so forth, causes binding of Gab2 to Grb2. This then leads to recruitment of SHP2,
  that binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on Gab, and in turn activates ERK/MAPK
  signaling. Negative feedback by serine phosphorylation of Gab at S160 by Akt and
  S623 by Erk (block arrows) plays an important role in control of function and signaling
  of Gabs.
