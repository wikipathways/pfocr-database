caption: '(A) Metabolomic Pathway construction of the metabolic pathways involved
  in the effects of LRK on HMG. (B) Signaling networks associated with the differentially
  expressed metabolic pathways. 1: Arachidonic acid metabolism. 2: Glycerophospholipid
  metabolism. 3: Linoleic acid metabolism. 4: Sphingolipid metabolism. 5: alpha-linolenic
  acid metabolism. 6: Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. 7: Arginine and proline
  metabolism. 8: Purine metabolism. The red solid box represents the peak area of
  the LRK/model >1. The blue solid box represents the peak area of LRK/model < 1.'
