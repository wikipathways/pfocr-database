caption: Schematic displays hypothesized pre- and post-synaptic signaling pathways
  activated by IL-1β to induce synapse loss. Blunt lines and arrows, respectively
  denote conclusions based on the inhibitory and activating treatments tested in this
  study. Aspects of the model based on published reports are labeled numerically.
  1) IL-1R activation results in the activation of Src family kinases (SFK) (;().
  2) SFKs phosphorylate and increase the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to glutamate
  (). 3) Increased Ca2+ influx via NMDA receptors activates the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway to produce synapse loss (; ). IL1-R activation in neurons (4) () and astrocytes
  (5) () leads to p38 MAPK mediated transcription of the COX2 gene. 6) PGE2 activation
  of presynaptic EP2 receptors increases the release of glutamate ().
