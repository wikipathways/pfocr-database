caption: The tobacco PA biosynthetic pathway in the youngest leaf (A), oldest leaf
  (B), and young roots (C). The endogenous contents of free PAs are depicted by the
  thickness of their boxes, whereas the soluble specific activities of the catabolic
  enzymes (in italics) are depicted by the thickness of the corresponding arrows.
  In the youngest leaf (A), the contents of Put, Spd, and Spm (nmol mg−1 protein),
  depicted by the corresponding thicknesses of boxes, are 6.8, 7.8, and 2.5, respectively,
  whereas the specific activities of PMT, DAO, PAO, and POX (mU mg−1 protein), depicted
  by the corresponding thicknesses of arrows, are 0, 0.0059, 0.0074, and 25,000, respectively
  (white lines that separate POX arrows mean that cellular POX activities are much
  higher than the other enzyme specific activities). The thicknesses of boxes and
  arrows in B and C are depicted proportionally to the respective thicknesses in A.
  One unit (U) = 1 μmol min−1. a, Any reductant.
