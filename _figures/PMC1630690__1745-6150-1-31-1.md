caption: 'The complete Krebs, truncated Krebs and glyoxylate cycles. Abbreviations:
  α-ketoglytarate -KGL, α-ketoglytarate dehydrogenase – KGDH, acetyl-CoA – Ac-CoA,
  aspartate – ASP, citrate-CIT, gluconeogenesis – GNG, glutamate – GLU, glycogene
  – GLYC, glyoxylate-Glyox, isocitrate – ISC, isocitrate lyase – ICL, malate-MAL,
  malate synthase – MS, oxalacetate – OAA, phosphoenolpyruvate – PEP, succinate-SUC,
  transaminases (aminotransferases) – TRAM. The truncated Krebs cycle includes the
  OAA + GLU -> ASP + KGL reaction that is catalyzed by glutamate-glyoxylate-aminotransferase
  [58, 59]. TRAM reactions in mitochondria and cytosol are connected by common amino
  and keto acids. Thick lines represent rapid reaction steps, dashed lines – slow
  and easily inhibited steps, crossed out like is the blocked aconitase reaction,
  dotted like – malate synthase pathway that may have been recently lost in placental
  mammal common ancestor.'
