caption: Signaling pathways in osteoclast (OC) differentiation, survival and death.
  Binding of RANKL to RANK results in the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as
  the TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) and activation of several downstream signaling
  pathways. The RANKL-RANK complex can activate all three MAPK pathways and the NF-κB
  pathway, by interacting with TRAF6 and TGF-α activated kinase (TAK)-1. Activation
  of the JNK pathway mobilizes a number of osteoclastogenic transcription factors
  such as c-Fos, Fos-related antigens (Fra-1and 2) and the nuclear factor-activated
  T-cells (NFAT) c1. Both the NF-κB and the JNK signaling pathways are essential for
  OC differentiation. Binding of TNF-α to TNFR has a strong synergistic effect with
  RANK in NF-κB and JNK pathways through RIP-IKK activation. The RANKL-RANK-mediated
  interaction of TRAF6 with c-Src stimulates the PI3K-Akt pathway necessary for cell
  survival. M-CSF binding to its cognate receptor, c-Fms, and its association with
  c-Src and PI3K acts synergistically on the PI3K-Akt pathway necessary for OC survival.
  Binding of Ras to c-Fms activates the Ras and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways as well. PAK1
  is activated by M-CSF in a Ras-dependent mechanism that promotes OC survival. PAK1
  promotes OC survival by modulating expression of the IAP family member, Survivin.
