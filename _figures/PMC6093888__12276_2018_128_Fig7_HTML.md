caption: A schematic representation showing that the p53 pathway is normal and responsive
  to proapoptotic reagents such as 5-FU in HCT-8 cells, but in 5-FU-resistant colorectal
  cancer cells (HCT-8R) with a wild-type p53 pathway, the Wnt pathway suppresses CHK1-induced
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through inhibition of the CHK1 pathway, which phosphorylates
  and stabilizes p53. H3K14ac modification plays a critical role in the Wnt-mediated
  regulation of drug resistance
