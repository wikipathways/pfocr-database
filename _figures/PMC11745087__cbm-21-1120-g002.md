caption: Outline of the interplay between m6A modification and radiation-induced injury
  effects on distinct normal organ tissues (created in Figdraw). Investigated effects
  included those on the lungs, liver, and hematopoietic system. A. In radiation-induced
  lung injury (RILI), the METTL3/m6A-FOXO1 mRNA/YTHDF2/AKT-ERK signaling pathway contributes
  to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BTB domain-containing protein 7B
  (Zbtb7b) recruits ALKBH5 to demethylate of IL-6 mRNA, thereby inhibiting its nucleocytoplasmic
  transport and production, and alleviating aseptic inflammation in RILI. B. In radiation-induced
  liver disease (RILD), the ALKBH5/m6A-HMGB1 mRNA/STING-IRF3 signaling pathway contributes
  to RILD via the innate immune response. In Kupffer cells, irradiation increases
  m6A modification levels, and the METTL3/m6A-TEAD1 mRNA/IGF2BP2/STING-NLRP3 signaling
  pathway contributes to the injury effects via pyroptosis. In hepatic stellate cells,
  irradiation upregulates ALKBH5, and the ALKBH5/m6A-TIRAP mRNA pathway facilitates
  radiation-induced liver fibrosis (RILF) progression by inducing monocyte recruitment
  and M2 polarization. C. The hematopoietic process is crucial for recovery and survival
  after radiation exposure, whereas hematopoiesis is vulnerable during RT. In hematopoietic
  Ythdf2 knockout mice, the mRNA degradation of both Wnt target genes and survival-associated
  genes under radiation stress is suppressed, and the regenerative ability of hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs) is therefore restrained. Our previous study has revealed that
  inhibiting the expression of FTO and ALKBH5 ameliorates radiation-induced hematopoietic
  injury (RIHI); therefore, suppression of m6A demethylase might improve recovery
  from radiation exposure. D. MicroRNA m6A modification regulates UV-induced skin
  photoaging. UVB exposure elicits a photoaging phenotype in skin fibroblasts and
  is accompanied by a decrease in total m6A level and METTL14 expression. After METTL14
  overexpression, the downregulated m6A modification level of pri-miR-100, identified
  as the target of METTL14, is rescued, thus enhancing binding of DiGeorge syndrome
  critical region 8 (DGCR8) to this pri-miRNA and restoring miR-100-3p maturation.
  The resurgent miR-100-3p eventually decreases expression of its target gene, epidermal
  growth factor receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1). Therefore, UVB exposure triggers
  dermal photoaging by affecting the METTL14/m6A-miR-100-3p/ERRFI1 axis. Of note,
  how the m6A modification functions in other typical radiation effects, such as radiation-induced
  neurobehavioral injury (RINI, E), radiation-induced gastrointestinal injury (RIGI,
  F), and radiation-induced reproductive injury (RIRI, G), requires further study
