caption: 'Diabetes mellitus induced regulation of osteoclast. During normal physiology
  several osteoblastogenic modulators including RANKL, M-CSF, monocyte chemoattractant
  protein (MCP), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds with their receptors expressed on
  osteoclast and activates different signal transduction pathway to transcribe the
  particular gene. Binding of RANKL with RANK triggers several possible pathways to
  induce the corresponding element. It may induce transcription factor NF-κB through
  TRAF or IkB kinase (IKK) mediated pathway as well as induces nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) through reactive oxygen species (ROS)- phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) mediated
  pathway. RANK also may induce AP-1 through triggering the kinase enzymes. Macrophage
  colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) activates transcription factors peroxisome proliferator
  activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) through PI3K-AKT
  mediated pathway. MCP activates AP-1 signaling through RAS-MAPK mediated pathway
  which requires the assistance of JAK. IgG also signals through the Fc receptor γ
  chain (FcγR) to activate NFAT via the induction of PLCγ as well as activates AP-1
  through the kinase enzyme systems and both of the pathways require the activation
  of SYK. /During the state of DM, it induces the upregulation of osteoclastogenic
  factors stated above and thereby induce the differentiation and activity of osteoclast.
  In addition to the above factors, DM also induces the synthesis of some proinflammatory
  cytokines which also favor the bone resorption by osteoclast. interleukin 6 (IL-6)
  exerts its effect through JAK-STAT mediated pathway although MCP activated JAK may
  contribute to the activation of STAT to some extent. TNF also activates NF-κB and
  AP-1 through IKK and Kinase system respectively. CCR2: CC chemokine receptor 2;
