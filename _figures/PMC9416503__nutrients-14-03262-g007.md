caption: Hepatic ERα contributes to preserve metabolic homeostasis in the liver of
  females under an excess of dietary lipids. (A) HFD effects on metabolite–metabolite
  interaction in the liver of control males, control females, LERKO males, and LERKO
  females. (B) Metabolic impact analysis of the most relevant biological pathways
  modified by HFD in the livers of control males, control females, LERKO males, and
  LERKO females identified through integrative analysis of the changes in the expression
  of key genes and metabolites. The metabolic pathways are represented as circles
  according to their enrichment (p-value, Y axis) and topology analyses (pathway impact,
  X axis) using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 software. The color of each metabolic pathway is
  related to the p-value obtained from enrichment analysis and its size represents
  the fold enrichment score; darker circle colors indicate more significant changes
  of metabolites in the corresponding pathway. The size of the circle corresponds
  to the pathway impact score and is correlated with the centrality of the involved
  metabolites.
