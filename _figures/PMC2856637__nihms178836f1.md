caption: 'Simplified scheme of early FcεRI-mediated signaling events. Ag-induced crosslinking
  of FcεRI induces activation of Lyn, which phosphorylates FcεRI ITAMs (green) and
  activates Syk following ITAM binding, and Fyn, which phosphorylates the adaptor
  Gab2 to activate the PI3K pathway. Lyn and Syk phosphorylate many adaptor molecules,
  e.g., LAT and NTAL, and enzymes to regulate activation of the Ras, PLCγ, PI3K and
  other pathways. Grb2 and SOS activate the Ras/Erk pathway, which regulates transcription
  factor activation and arachidonic acid metabolism (through PLA2 activation). PLCγ
  can either be activated through the coordinated function of LAT/Gads/SLP-76/Vav
  and Btk or independently of LAT through a PI3K/Btk-dependent pathway. PLCγ activation
  regulates classical PKC activation (through DAG generation) and calcium responses
  (through the generation of IP3). IP3 binding to the IP3R triggers Ca2+ release from
  the ER; STIM1 couples ER Ca2+ store depletion with the activation of CRAC channels,
  leading to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and ICRAC. The PI3K product, PI(3,4,5)P3,
  is an important lipid mediator that regulates the activity of various enzymes, e.g.,
  Btk, Akt, PDK1, PLD and SK, and the formation of other lipid mediators, e.g., DAG
  and S1P. S1P can act intracellulary, to regulate Ca2+ influx and degranulation (independently
  of PLC and IP3), and extracellularly (following secretion from the cell) by binding
  to surface S1P1 or S1P2 receptors and thereby inducing cytoskeletal rearrangement
  or enhancing degranulation, respectively. The IKK complex consists of two catalytic
  subunits, IKKα/IKK1 and IKKβ/IKK2, and a regulatory subunit, NEMO/IKKγ; this complex
  phosphorylates IκB to activate the transcription factor NFκB. IKKβ/IKK2 also phosphorylates
  SNAP23 to facilitate SNARE complex formation. Arrows indicate the contributions
  of these signaling pathways toward mast cell degranulation, arachidonic acid metabolism,
  and cytokine/chemokine/growth factor production. Note: some arrows do not indicate
  direct interactions or targets. Bcl10, B cell lymphoma 10; Btk, Bruton’s tyrosine
