caption: Polyphosphate signaling pathway. As cell density increases and/or nutrients
  are depleted, extracellular polyphosphate accumulation increases. When sufficient
  extracellular polyphosphate accumulates, it acts as an autocrine signal with the
  effects dependent on the nutrients available. If nutrients are high, polyphosphate
  inhibits proliferation through an unknown mechanism. Polyphosphate also inhibits
  proteasome activation through a pathway facilitated by GrlD and RasC, priming cells
  for the eventual transition to development. If nutrients become sufficiently low,
  polyphosphate inhibits proliferation through a pathway mediated by GrlD, RasC, and
  proteasome inhibition. Polyphosphate-induced proteasome inhibition also induces
  aggregation, the first phase of Dictyostelium development. Red arrows indicate inhibition,
  and the dashed arrow indicates that GrlD is not essential for proliferation inhibition
  by polyphosphate in high nutrient conditions.
