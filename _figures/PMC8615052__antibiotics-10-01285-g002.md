caption: Heat leads to splanchnic hypoxia and metabolic stress. Heat and hypoxia increase
  the production of oxidants (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS)), consequently activating
  the heat shock response pathway (HSR) to maintain homeostasis. Higher exposure to
  oxidants increases epithelial permeability by disrupting tight junction proteins.
  Increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa mediates the passage of luminal
  contents (e.g., endotoxins and bacteria), activating the immune response mediated
  by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and contributing to the host defense
  system.
