caption: Schematic illustration of the spinal microglial dynorphin A/κ-opioid receptor/synaptic
  plasticity pathway for bulleyaconitine A (BAA) to produce antinociception in visceral
  hypersensitivity state. BAA stimulates spinal microglia via a Gs/cAMP/PKA/p38β/CREB
  signaling transduction pathway to express and secret dynorphin A, which passes through
  the microglial neuronal synapse and acts on the presynaptic κ-opioid receptors.
  Following presynaptic κ-opioid receptor activation, the enhanced neuronal presynaptic
  glutamate transmission and consequent postsynaptic NMDA currents are reduced in
  the visceral hypersensitivity state, which leads to inhibition of central sensitization
  and visceral antinociception.
