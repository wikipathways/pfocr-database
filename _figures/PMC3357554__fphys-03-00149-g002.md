caption: Model for P2X7 receptor-induced signaling pathway involved in MV shedding.
  On stimulation with ATP or the selective agonist BzATP, P2X7 receptor activates
  P38 cascade through src-kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In turn, P38 triggers different
  pathways, among which PM pore formation (a), and mobilization of A-SMase from luminal
  lysosomal compartment to plasma membrane outer leaflet (b) where the enzyme alters
  membrane structure/fluidity leading to plasma membrane blebbing and shedding. Shed
  MVs carry IL-1β, present A-SMase and high levels of PS on their membrane outer leaflet.
