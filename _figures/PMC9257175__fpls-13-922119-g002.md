caption: Mechanisms of HCAs/HCAAs enhancing plant resistance. After pathogen infection,
  elevation of plant endogenous hormones stimulates the production of HCAs/HCAAs.
  Rapid transcriptional reprogramming of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes for HCAAs
  is one of the mechanisms of plant defense responses. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
  may act as an amide carrier protein for HCAAs translocation to the plasma membrane,
  then deposited on the cell wall. Under the action of MATE, HCAAs move to the leaf
  surface, thereby inhibiting spore germination. Exogenous HCAs/HCAAs treatment stimulated
  a series of plant immune responses, such as plant hormones (JA, SA, and ABA) levels
  are elevated, SA and JA stimulate resistance responses in plants. HCAs/HCAAs stimulated
  stomata opening and closing, which may be achieved by controlling the content of
  ABA. HCAs/HCAAs also stimulate the production of lignin, callose, and ROS. The stimulation
  of these immune responses increases the resistance of plants to pathogens.
