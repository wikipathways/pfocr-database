caption: Compartmentation of the folate synthesis pathway in plants. The steps in
  the pterin branch of the pathway are in blue, those in the pABA branch are in green,
  and the others (condensation, glutamylation, and reduction) are in red. Note that
  the compartmentation of the pathway and of its folate end products implies the existence
  of pterin or folate carriers in the mitochondria, chloroplast, and vacuolar membranes.
  Pathway intermediates are designated by the symbols used in Figure 3. THF-Glun,
  THF polyglutamates.
