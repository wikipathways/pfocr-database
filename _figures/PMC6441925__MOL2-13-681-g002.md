caption: Therapies targeting cancer specific DNA repair defects. Current chemotherapy
  agents (black) used to treat mCRC. Oxaliplatin induces DNA interstrand cross‐links
  that are repaired by nucleotide excision repair proteins during G1 and by Fanconi
  anemia and HR proteins during S phase. Irinotecan (SN38) is a topoisomerase inhibitor
  that induces single (SSB)‐ and double‐strand breaks (DSBs) that are repaired by
  HR and BER proteins. 5‐Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite that can lead to DNA base
  pair mismatches repaired by the MMR pathway. Alternative therapies (red) that can
  be used in combination with current chemotherapy agents. PARPi and ATRi induce stalled
  replication forks and DSBs that are lethal in cells carrying mutations in HR genes,
  and CHKi block cell cycle arrest in the presence of replication stress. Chemosensitivity
  can be further induced in cells treated with genotoxic agents in combination with
  targeted therapies. Thiopurines induce DNA base pair mismatches that can lead to
  increased mutational and neoantigen burdens. Anti‐PD‐1 and CTLA‐4 immunotherapies
  target MMRd CRC tumors and are most effective against tumors with high neoantigen
  burdens.
