caption: 'Bacterial H2S synthesis and reactions catalyzed by CGLs. (A) Scheme of the
  known H2S production pathways in bacteria: Sulfate Reduction Pathway (SRP) (grey
  arrows), 3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase (3-MST) pathway (dashed arrows) and
  Reverse Transsulfuration Pathway (RTP) (black arrows). The first step in the SRP
  is the activation of sulfate by the bifunctional sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit1/adenylylsulfate
  kinase (CysND), which converts ATP and sulfate to AMP and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate
  (APS). The APS is transformed into 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS)
  by adenylyl-sulfate kinase (CysC), and then reduced to sulfite (SO32−) by phosphoadenosine
  phosphosulfate reductase (CysH). Sulfite is subsequently reduced to hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S) by sulfite reductase (SR, CysI). On the other hand, the 3-MST pathway initiates
  with the conversion of cysteine into 3-mercaptopyruvate by the enzyme cystine aminotransferase
  (CAT). CAT transfers an amino group from cysteine to α-ketoglutarate, yielding 3-mercaptopyruvate
  and glutamate. Once formed, 3-mercaptopyruvate serves as a substrate for the enzyme
  3-Mercaptopyruvate Sulfurtransferase (3-MST). 3-MST catalyzes the transfer of a
  sulfur atom from 3-mercaptopyruvate to an acceptor molecule, leading to the production
  of H2S. Finally, the H2S production via RTP (explained detail in the “Introduction”
  section) involves the desulfuration of cysteine. Key enzymes in RTP are cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) (widely described in this manuscript).
  Abbreviations: SO42− (sulfate); SO32− (sulfite); 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
  (3-MST); persulfidated 3-MST (3-MST-SS); Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS); Cystathionine
  γ-lyase (CGL); (B) Reactions catalyzed by CGL. The first α,γ-elimination of l-Cth
  (reaction 1) represents the canonical CGL reaction, which does not lead to production
  of H2S. The α,β elimination of L-Cth (reaction 2) refers to as the β-lyase activity
  of CGL which, like reaction 1, does not produce H2S. However, CGL catalyzes several
  alternative reactions using l-Hcys and/or l-Cys as substrates generating H2S (reactions
  3–7).'
