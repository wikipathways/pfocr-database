caption: 'The cAMP signaling pathways. (a) 1: The first messenger (red) binds to the
  G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The receptor then changes conformation, leading
  to the replacement of GDP by GTP on the α subunit of the G protein and inducing
  the subsequent release of the α subunit from the β and γ subunits of the G protein
  [,]. 2: The α subunit binds to the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase (AC). The
  α subunit can have inhibitory (αi) or stimulating (αs) properties, which will lead
  to the inhibition or stimulation of AC [,]. The activated AC will convert ATP into
  cAMP. Isoproterenol induces the conversion of ATP to cAMP following the classical
  pathway (b) The A1 peptide of cholera toxin (CT) (purple) binds to the complex composed
  of the GTP-α subunit of the G protein and AC and prevents the G protein from cleaving
  GTP to GDP, leading to a tremendous increase in cAMP levels [].'
