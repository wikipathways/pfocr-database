caption: Schematic of carbon source uptake and degradation pathways in H. volcanii.
  The semiphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway for glucose degradation is shown
  at the left (green box), the modified Embden-Meyerhoff pathway for fructose use
  is shown in the center (blue box), and glycerol degradation (purple box) is shown
  at the right. The thick gray line represents the membrane boundary between the outside
  and inside of the cell. Numbered reactions correspond to genes and enzymes with
  corresponding references to experimental evidence in the table at the bottom. Reactions
  with multiple arrows represent pathways with multiple reactions not of focus in
  this study. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PTSFRU, fructose-specific phosphotransferase
  transport system; F1P, fructose-1-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; GAP,
