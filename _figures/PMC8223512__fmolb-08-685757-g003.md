caption: The pupylation locus in involved in the mycobacterial DNA damage response.
  The mycobacterial DNA damage response is mediated by two pathways, the SOS response
  mediated by repressor LexA and the response mediated by activator PafBC. The canonical
  SOS response pathway is illustrated on the right (LexA/RecA-dependent pathway).
  Upon DNA damage RecA forms filaments on ssDNA, which stimulates auto-cleavage of
  the repressor LexA. LexA dissociates from the SOS box which in turn, upregulates
  transcription of DNA damage response genes such as recA. The left side shows the
  PafBC-dependent DNA damage response pathway. Upon binding of a response-producing
  ligand (hypothesized to be a nucleic acid) PafBC is activated and binds to the RecA-NDp
  promoter, activating the transcription of many genes involved in DNA repair and
  oxidative stress response. Upon return to normal conditions, RecA along with several
  other PafBC regulon members (EgtD, TopoN, IscS, RuvA, etc.) are pupylated and removed
  by the Pup-proteasome system to recover fully from DNA damage. Interestingly, some
  genes such as recA, uvrA, and uvrC are regulated by the PafBC regulon as well as
  the SOS regulon.
