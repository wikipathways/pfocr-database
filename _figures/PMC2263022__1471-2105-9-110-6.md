caption: 'Superposition of ''omics'' data on maps. By allowing the user to superimpose
  functional genomic or proteomic data on pathway maps, SPIKE facilitates improved
  interpretation of such datasets. The color of the bar above each gene''s node indicates
  its response. Upregulated genes are shades of red: the darker the red the greater
  the fold of induction. Similarly, downregulated genes are in shades of green. Genes
  whose expression was not changed are yellow, and genes for which data are not available
  (e.g., genes not present on the microarray) are grey. In this example, superimposing
  gene expression data measured in human lymphocyte cells exposed to ionizing radiation
  on the signaling map shows the activation of the p53 network (top-left part of the
  network) and the down-regulation of genes that function in the cell cycle G2-M phase
  transition (bottom-right part of the network). Superimposing the data on this map
  clearly shows that a large fraction of the p53 network was activated in the analyzed
  condition. SPIKE also allows superimposition of clustering data: any partition of
  the genes into groups (e.g., according to GO annotation, cellular compartment, clustering,
  or user-specific definitions) can be viewed on the pathway map. The color scheme
  can be adjusted by the user.'
