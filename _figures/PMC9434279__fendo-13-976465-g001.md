caption: Molecular mechanisms of beta-cell apoptosis under conditions of IAPP aggregation
  and glucolipotoxicity. In obesity-associated type 2 diabetes, elevated islet amyloid
  polypeptide (IAPP), glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and glucolipotoxicity are the most
  studied causative factors of beta-cell apoptosis. These factors activate all ER
  stress pathways in beta-cells, namely the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways, and subsequently
  induce ER stress. When ER stress is prolonged or excessive, it may mediate beta-cell
  dysfunction and apoptosis by increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor
  CHOP. In the presence of these pathogenic factors, it also leads to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increase
  of ROS activates the apoptotic pathway mediated by oxidative stress and mitochondrial
  cytochrome C in beta-cell. Autophagy can degrade damaged or misfolded cellular components
  and proteins under normal physiological conditions. However, under conditions of
  glucolipotoxicity and increased IAPP, beta-cells are subjected to sustained metabolic
  stress that leads to impaired autophagy which ultimately exacerbates beta-cell dysfunction
  thereby leading to apoptosis. Islet inflammation often occurs during T2D development
  and is characterized by macrophage recruitment to infiltrating immune cells, which
  can lead to increased production of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, TNFa,
  and these pro-inflammatory signals can activate apoptotic mechanisms, including
  ER stress and oxidative stress in beta-cells. By Figdraw (www.figdraw.com).
