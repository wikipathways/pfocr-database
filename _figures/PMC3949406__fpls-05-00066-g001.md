caption: Visualization of the genes associated with UPR in plants as determined by
  GeneCAT analysis. This is a simple subnetwork example (). The nodes represent genes
  and the lines represent the relationships between the genes. The genes identified
  in blue are the query genes. The nearest co-expressed genes are highlighted in green
  and form a cluster of co-expressed genes based on an analysis of mutual co-expression
  ranks between the top 50 genes from the list. The bold lines, in this subnetwork,
  identify those genes that have low mutual ranks according to GeneCAT webtool analysis
  (; ). Query genes including bZIP60, SKP1, and CRT3 do have lines connecting them
  to the co-expressed gene network arguing that they are not connected in a manner
  that is statistically relevant. Thus the evidence that these genes are upregulated
  early in virus infection could suggest that the virus may be interacting with more
  than one signaling pathway. Each blue and green labeled node, has a gray box with
  the name of the gene and its accession highlighted in larger print.
