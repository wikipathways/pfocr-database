caption: p220 functions downstream of cyclin E/Cdk2 to control DNA replication and
  histone gene transcription. (Top) The cyclin E/Cdk2 signaling pathway. See text
  for details. (Bottom) Model for control of histone transcription by p220. During
  the G0 and G1 cell cycle phases, histone transcription is low but detectable. In
  this cell cycle phase, expression of histone H4 appears to be under the control
  of p220, although p220 is not phosphorylated by Cdk2. As cells enter S phase, p220
  is phosphorylated by Cdk2 and this leads to an increase in p220's ability to promote
  expression of all four core histone genes.
