caption: The GEP100-Arf6 pathway to invasion. The Arf6 pathway, which involves its
  activation by GEP100 and employs the AMAP1-mediated signalsome for its downstream
  signaling constitutes a robust and central pathway for the induction of the invasion
  and metastasis of some breast cancer cells. GEP100 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated
  EGFR for its activation. Therefore, activation of EGFR is required for the activation
  of this pathway. This pathway also appears to perturb the formation and maintenance
  of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion.
