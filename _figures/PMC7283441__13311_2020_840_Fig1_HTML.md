caption: 'Signaling cascade of apoptosis in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Extrinsic
  pathway (red arrows); following TBI, Fas ligand binds to Fas death receptors (FasR)
  and triggers the recruitment of the death domain protein (DD), which binds to procaspase-8.
  This complex, death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), activates caspase-8. Activated
  caspase-8 either results in the cleaving of Bid to truncated active form of Bid
  (tBid), which integrates the different death pathways at the mitochondrial checkpoint
  of apoptosis and activates caspase-3. tBid interacts with Bax, which is inhibited
  by ant-iapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Interaction of tBid with
  Bax leads to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores, subsequently releasing
  cytochrome c (Cytc) or second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac).
  Once released into the cytosol, Cytc binds with apoptotic protein-activating factor-1
  (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9 to form an apoptosome, which activates caspase-9, leading
  to caspase-3-dependent cell death. This pathway also interacts microglia activation.
  Intrinsic pathway (yellow arrows): TBI elevates cytosolic calcium concentration
  and activates calpains and mediates cleavage of Bid to Bid. At the mitochondrial
  intermembrane, tBid interacts with apoptotic proteins and induces caspase-3-dependent
  pathway. In contrast, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or endonuclease G (Endo G)
  translocates to the nucleus where it mediates DNA damage and cell death in a caspase-independent
  manner. In addition, nuclear pathways of neuronal apoptosis are activated in response
  to DNA damage through activation of p53, which interacts with bcl-2 family proteins
  and precedes Cytc release. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt pathway
  are also inactivate Bad or Bim, resulting in apoptosis. Furthermore, TBI generate
  superoxide anions, which also causes DNA damage. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathway
  interact via Bid and cause DNA damage leading to apoptosis'
