caption: The extrafollicular (EF) pathway for the generation of autoreactive plasma
  cells (PCs) in systemic lupus erythematosus. Shown here are the potential mechanisms
  that can contribute to enhanced extrafollicular PC responses. These include (1)
  expansion of marginal zone (MZ) B cells, which often exhibit autoreactive receptors;
  (2) increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which can directly activate B
  cells (B cell-intrinsic) or can enhance Th responses through their effect on dendritic
  cells (B cell-extrinsic); (3) B cell hyperresponsiveness, which can affect the activation
  of follicular B cells; (4) increased class switch recombination which can lead to
  more pathogenic IgG autoantibodies; (5) somatic hypermutation which can lead to
  affinity maturation of autoreactive PCs; and (6) increased PC survival.
