caption: Sphingolipid involvement in ethanol-induced apoptosis in the P7 mouse brain.
  This figure, which summarizes possible involvement of ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P), GM2 and GM1 in ethanol-induced apoptosis, is based on previous studies by
  us and others. Ceramide generated via enhanced de novo synthesis and SM hydrolysis
  inactivates PI3K/Akt pathway and activates GSK3β. Ceramide may also directly affect
  mitochondrial membrane permeability. Increases in GM2 and S1P may enhance apoptosis
  while exogenous GM1 shows neuroprotection. ROS generation and AMPK inhibition triggered
  by ethanol are likely to be linked to the altered sphingolipid metabolism during
  apoptosis. The coordinate action of sphingolipids in mitochondria may be crucial
  for the regulation of the ethanol-induced, mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.
