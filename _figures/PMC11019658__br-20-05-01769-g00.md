caption: 'Mechanistically, DHM inhibits tumour cell proliferation. The numbers in
  the figure indicate the following: (1) DHM decreases the production of the CDC25A,
  CDC2 and phosphorylated CDC2 proteins, induces cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase,
  and inhibits cell proliferation. (2) The phosphorylation of CDK1 by DHM inactivates
  the CDK1/cell cycle protein B1 complex, thereby inducing G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest
  and thus inhibiting the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. (3) DHM increases
  the protein and RNA levels of p21, induces G2-M cell cycle arrest in U2OS osteosarcoma
  cells, and inhibits cell proliferation. (4) DHM upregulates the expression of miR-455-3p
  and inhibits the expression of the downstream target ZEB1, thereby inhibiting the
  proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma cells. (5) DHM decreases the protein expression
  of CXCR4 and inhibits the proliferation of PC-3 tumour cells. (6) DHM targets the
  activation of ERK1/2 and Akt to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in lung
  cancer cells. (7) DHM regulates the activation of the Akt/STAT3 signalling pathway
  and the expression of HMGB1 to inhibit the proliferation of BGC-823 cells. DHM,
