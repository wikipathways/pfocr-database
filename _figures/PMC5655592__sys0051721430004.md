caption: 'Intraset concordancy and transcriptome-proteome discordancy of gene products
  related to protein translation, OxP, and chaperone proteins. (A) The eIF and RP
  complexes displayed significant intraset concordancy (Pc [transcriptome] = 8.9E−16)
  and transcriptome-proteome discordancy (cyan outlines). (B) The OxP pathway also
  displayed significant intraset concordancy [qe (transcriptome, up) = 3.4E−6, Pc[transcriptome]
  = 9.3E−10] and transcriptome-proteome discordancy (cyan outlines). (C) All of the
  following categories of transcriptome and proteome data related to the four annotations
  were analyzed: eIFs, the 40S ribosomal complex (RPS), the 60S ribosomal complex
  (RPL), and the OxP pathway. Each triangle depicts a microarray probe (transcriptome
  [Trans.] data subset) or a protein group (quantified nonredundantly; proteome [Prot.]
  data subset). Red and blue triangles depict significantly increased and decreased
  gene products, respectively (gray triangles = not significantly affected). The lines
  indicate each median and interquartile range. Each binomial test either used all
  of the data or was restricted to just the significantly affected data, as indicated.
  n/a, not applicable. (D) A protein-protein interaction network was prepared using
  all of the chaperones (rectangles) and cochaperones (ovals) that were significantly
  affected by germ status within the proteome data subset, and the intraset concordance
  was significant (Pc = 6.1E−5). Also included are the E3 ubiquitin ligases (yellow
  hexagons) that have been reported to associate with chaperones and typically target
  misfolded/unfolded proteins. Edge weight data depict the protein-protein interaction
  confidence (increasing weight values depict low, medium, high, and very high confidence).
  (E) Summary of the effects on the GF mouse intestine. The decrease in immune cell
  populations was reported previously by Morgun et al. ().'
