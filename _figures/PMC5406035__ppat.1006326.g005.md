caption: Pulmonary infection by IAV triggers the recruitment of monocytes from the
  bone marrow that differentiate into macrophages. IAV encounters and infects those
  macrophages, where viral RNA activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, leading to production
  of the key anti-viral cytokine IFN-β. IAV-induced RIPK3 interaction with MAVS at
  the mitochondria and may represent an immune evasion strategy to decrease IFN-β
  production. In the absence of RIPK3, there is increased RIPK1/MAVS interactions,
  which enhance downstream signaling, resulting in higher TBK1/IRF3 activation and
  IFN-β mRNA levels. However, this mechanism is counteracted by the RIPK3-mediated
  activation of PKR. PKR stabilizes IFN-β mRNA through the poly(A) tail, leading to
  increased IFN-β protein production and, ultimately, host protection.
