caption: Mechanism of ITAMi signaling pathway in the absence of receptor‐induced coaggregation
  with heterologous receptor in the cell surface. During resting conditions, the FcaRI
  expressed by myeloid cells constitutively binds circulating monomeric IgA which
  leads to its association with SHP‐1 in lipid rafts creating an ITAMi signaling configuration.
  After an inflammatory signal induced by a given antigen, an activating receptor
  is engaged into raft domains, before being internalized together with FcaRI under
  the inhibitory ITAM configuration which is armed of SHP‐1 and segregated into polarized
  clusters named inhibisomes. These structures enable a close proximity between FcaRI‐bound
  SHP‐1 to the antigen‐bound receptor allowing sustained inhibition of the receptor‐activated
  kinases. Created with BioRender.com
