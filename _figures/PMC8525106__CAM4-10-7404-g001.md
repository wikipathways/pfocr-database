caption: “Hub” sub‐network models related to radioresistance. (A‐D) The main NPC radioresistance
  models including DNA damage pathway (A), cell cycle pathway (B), DNA repair pathway
  (C), and apoptosis pathway (D) were constructed by integrating the differentially
  expressed gene data (left half node of the cycle nodes) with the reported genes
  (right half node of the cycle nodes). Circle nodes indicate genes, with the right
  half of the circle colored red representing the gene as a marker gene, the left
  half colored red representing the gene upregulated in differential expression, and
  the left half colored green representing the gene downregulated in differential
  expression. Rectangles indicate KEGG pathways or biological processes. Pathways
  were colored with gradient color from yellow to blue, with smaller p values in yellow
  and larger p values in blue
