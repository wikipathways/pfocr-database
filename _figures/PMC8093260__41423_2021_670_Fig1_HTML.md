caption: Overview of NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation. NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation involves two steps, i.e., Signal 1 (priming) and Signal 2 (protein complex
  assembly). Signal 1 is triggered by pattern recognition receptor signaling or cytokines,
  leading to the transcriptional activation of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Licensing
  of the NLRP3 protein is important for the priming step of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The activation signal (Signal 2) is induced by various pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin 1β
  (IL-1β)/IL-1R1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)/TNF receptor (TNFR), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)/S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2),
  adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/P2Y12, α-synuclein/CD36, and bromodomain-containing
  protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1 each activate NF-κB and then upregulate the transcription
  level of the component required for NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Caspase-8 and
  fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) are upstream regulators of NF-κB
  signaling that activate both the transcriptional priming and PTM of NLRP3 inflammasome
  pathway components. Upon TLR3 stimulation, FADD/caspase-8 scaffolding is involved
  in the PTM associated with Signal 1 in the intermediate pathway or activates receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinases 3 (RIPK3)/mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase
  (MLKL) function required for both Signal 1 and Signal 2 in the late pathway. Extracellular
  Ca2+ can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR),
  and CaSR triggers the phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)
  pathway to induce intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  Ca2+ flux by transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) or apolipoprotein
  C3 (ApoC3) is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate NLRP3. It is
  currently recognized that TXNIP binds to NLRP3. ADP/P2Y1 induces Ca2+ movement,
  and various DAMPs/PAMPs trigger K+ efflux through pannexin-1 to activate NLRP3.
  In addition, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and tandem pore domains in weak inward rectifying
  K+ channel 2 (TWIK2) act as K+ efflux channels and are required for NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. Testosterone, imiquimod, CLO97, K+ efflux, and α-synuclein generate
  mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), which activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Severe fever with
  thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection triggers BCL2 antagonist/killer
  1 (BAK)/BCL2-associated X (BAX) signaling and leads to oxidized mitochondrial DNA
  (ox-mtDNA). Furthermore, cardiolipin can directly bind to NLRP3 and activate NLRP3
  inflammasome assembly. Particulates and crystals, nicotine, lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC), and Leu-Leu-O-methyl ester (LLME) induce lysosomal damage, and damaged lysosomes
  release cathepsin B. In addition, damaged lysosomes induce K+ efflux, which causes
  Cl- efflux through chloride intracellular channels (CLICs). The complement system
  activates NLRP3 by forming a membrane attack complex (MAC). In endothelial cells,
  immunoglobulin M (IgM)-mediated MAC induces NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) stabilization
  and causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. C5a-C5aR2 signaling also activates the
  NLRP3 inflammasome through protein kinase R (PKR) in macrophages. Moreover, pore-forming
  toxins and ATP induce K+ efflux and activate NLRP3 inflammasome. During Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, plasma membrane damage causes K+ efflux and NLRP3
  activation. In addition, ADP also induces K+ efflux through P2Y12. During RNA virus
  infection, mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein
  directly bind to and activate NLRP3. Cathepsin B also directly binds to NLRP3 in
  the ER. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) regulates NLRP3 activation in response to
  influenza A virus infection. Orange arrows indicate direct binding with NLRP3
