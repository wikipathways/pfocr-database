caption: Carbon metabolic pathway. Note. Red indicated markedly up-regulated content
  of metabolites in the experimental group. Blue indicated no marked change of the
  metabolite which had been detected. Green indicated markedly down-regulated content
  of metabolites in the experimental group. Cause for the phenotypic differences among
  the research subjects was identified through metabolic pathways.
