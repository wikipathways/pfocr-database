caption: Hypothetical signalling network and status in bovine cumulus cells modified
  by FSH-priming based on RNA-seq expression signature. FSH-priming stimulates an
  anti-inflammatory cascade via the activation of IRF7 pathway following TGFB1 pathway
  inhibition. The inhibited TGFB1 pathway may result from the inhibition of MEK signalling.
  FSH-priming prevents cell movement/migration via the inhibition of genes involved
  in extracellular matrix expansion (HAS2, TNFAIP6, and PTX3) following MEK signalling
  inhibition, which may be related to enhancing cell-to-cell communication. Moreover,
  FSH PRIMING stimulates cAMP-PKA, which may participate in the inhibition of MEK
  signalling and activation of cell-to-cell communication such as gap-junctional communication
  (a). Cumulus cells in a low competence model without FSH-priming are in a state
  of poor cell-to-cell communication, progressing atresia, and driving a spontaneous
  ovulation-like cascade. Conversely, cumulus cells in a high competence model following
  FSH-priming are in a state of enhanced cell-to-cell communication and are maintained
  healthy by the activated anti-inflammatory cascade, which allow the transport of
  nutritional molecules from cumulus cells to oocytes at the time of final oocyte
  maturation (b). MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase kinase; cAMP-PKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A signalling
  pathway.
