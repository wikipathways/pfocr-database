caption: The sphingolipid rheostat targeting in adult-type diffuse gliomas. (A) The
  balance between sphingolipids that act as tumor suppressors (ceramide) and those
  that act as tumor promoters (sphingosine-1-phosphate, S1P) is controlled by targeting
  the enzymes of sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Drugs that have been involved in
  clinical trials on glioma patients are colored blue, while pre-clinical drugs are
  colored purple. (B) In IDH-wildtype gliomas, the sphingolipid rheostat is shifted
  towards high S1P levels, promoting anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signaling. In
  IDH-mutant gliomas, the sphingolipid rheostat is reversed but with preserved anti-apoptotic
  signaling. Due to the higher vulnerability of IDH-mutated gliomas, the drugs that
  induce ceramide accumulation or reduce S1P, can further alter the rheostat inducing
  cell death. SPTLC1 - serine palmitoyltransferase 1; KDSR - 3-ketosphinganine reductase;
