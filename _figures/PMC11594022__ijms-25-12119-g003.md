  and luteolin) metabolic pathway of perilla according to maturation stage. Values
  are the mean ± SD of 3 replicates. Different small letters in the same items indicate
  a significant difference (p < 0.05) among different growth periods. *** p < 0.001
  represent significant differences between perilla seed and perilla flower
