caption: 'Simplified schematics depict: (A) the Notch pathway, where labels S2-S4
  indicate cleavage sites in the Notch receptor; (B) a cross-section of a crypt in
  the large intestine. Arrows denote the general direction of cell migration. Cells
  are coloured according to their type: red indicates a stem cell; purple indicates
  a proliferative progenitor or transit cell; secretory goblet cells are shown in
  green, and absorptive enterocytes are shown in blue; (C) the Wnt pathway in its
  low-stimulus state; (D) the Wnt pathway in its high-stimulus state. All network
  diagrams depict the cytoplasm in green, the nucleus in blue, the intercellular space
  in grey and the proteasome in red, while transcriptional targets of the pathway
  are listed in red. Image (B) is adapted from Reizel et al. [], originally published
