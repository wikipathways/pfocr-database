caption: Signaling networks involved in regulation of apoptosis in collecting duct
  cells. Schematic shows regulation of caspase cleavage and apoptosis through the
  cAMP-PKA pathway downstream of the vasopressin V2 receptor as well as the PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway. Sites of action for the various inhibitors used in the study
  are indicated by red lettering.
