caption: Folate metabolic pathway; connection between the folate cycle and methionine
  cycle. MTHFR catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylene THF to the active form of
  folate, 5-methyl THF, using NADPH as a cofactor. In MTHFR deficiency, 5-methyl THF
  levels are reduced, leading to decreased methionine and SAM levels along with homocysteine
  accumulation. DHF, Dihydrofolate; THF, Tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-methylene THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; 5-methyl THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate;
  FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine;
  BHMT, Betaine-Homocysteine Methyltransferase; DMG, Dimethylglycine; CBS, Cystathionine
  β-synthase; CTH, Cystathionine γ-lyase
