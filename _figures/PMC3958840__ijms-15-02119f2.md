caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between ASK1 and Aβ. Aβ activates
  ASK1 and MKK3/6 by ROS. Aβ induces the JNK signal pathway, which induces neuronal
  cell death and phosphorylation of tau protein. Finally, activation of ASK1 by Aβ
  is associated with neuronal cell death and phosphorylation of tau protein.
