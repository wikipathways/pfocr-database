caption: The regulatory role of FMR1/FMRP on BMPR2 in granulosa cells. This figure
  illustrates the mechanism through which FMRP regulates BMPR2 expression in GCs to
  affect folliculogenesis, proliferation, and luteinization. BMP15 and GDF9 secreted
  by oocytes bind to BMPR2 receptors and activate the BMP signaling pathway. This
  activation leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9 and SMAD2/3, which then promotes
  the expression of genes crucial for GC function. FMRP, which is encoded by the FMR1
  mRNA, inhibits BMPR2 mRNA translation, thereby regulating BMPR2 protein levels.
  Impaired FMR1/FMRP levels in individuals with POR could lead to the disruption of
  FMRP-BMPR2 interactions, impaired BMP signaling, increased apoptosis, and impaired
  follicle development. This underscores the critical regulatory role of FMR1/FMRP
  and its importance in ovarian function and infertility. Figures were created using
