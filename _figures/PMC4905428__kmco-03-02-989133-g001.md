caption: Regulation of Smad4 by the FGF/MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. (A) Fibroblast
  growth factor (FGF) stimulates Smad4 phosphorylation by Erk at Thr 277. This has
  a dual function. First, it allows Smad4 to reach peak transcriptional activity (the
  identity of the co-activator is still unknown). Second, Erk/mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation primes Smad4 for glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)
  phosphorylations that cause transcriptional inhibition and also generate a phosphodegron
  that serves as a docking site for the ubiquitin E3 ligase beta-transducin repeat
  containing protein (β-TrCP). Thus, both the activity and the stability of Smad4
  are regulated by the FGF/EGF and Wnt signaling pathways. (B) Model highlighting
  Smad4 regulation in tumor suppression. Many tumors harbor activating Ras/Raf mutations
  that activate the Erk pathway, thus stimulating proliferation (red arrows). When
  the Wnt pathway is also activated (for example by loss of adenomatous polyposis
  coli [APC]), the activity and stability of Smad4 will be enhanced through the newly
  described regulatory mechanism (green arrows). This gain in Smad4 activity increases
  the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β (by increasing transcription of cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p14Ink4b and p21WAF), counteracting the proliferation
  driven by the Ras and Wnt pathways (red arrows). When Smad4 function is mutated
  during cancer progression, the barrier effect of Smad4 is lost with catastrophic
  consequences.
