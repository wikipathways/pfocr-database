caption: An overview of the pathways involved in folate-dependent methionine transmethylation
  and transsulfuration. Methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) catalyzes the synthesis
  of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF) from 5,10,methylenetetrahydrofolfate (5,10-CH2THF).
  The methyl group from 5-CH3THF is transferred to homocysteine to regenerate methionine
  via the folate/B12-dependent methionine synthase (MS) reaction. Methionine synthase
  reductase (MSR) maintains the B12 cofactor in a reduced state for optimal MS activity.
  Methionine is then activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor
  for multiple cellular methyltransferase (MTase) reactions. After methyl group transfer,
  SAM is converted to SAH which is further metabolized to homocysteine and adenosine
  by a reversible reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH). Homocysteine may be
  permanently removed from the methionine cycle by irreversible conversion to cystathionine
  by B6-dependent cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) which initiates the transsulfuration
  pathway. Cystathionine is subsequently converted to cysteine, the rate limiting
  amino acid for the synthesis of the tripeptide, glutathione (Glu-Cys-Gly). Reduced
  active glutathione (GSH) is in dynamic equilibrium with the oxidized disulfide GSSG
  form of glutathione. Reduced folates are transported from the plasma into the cell
  by the reduced folate carrier (RFC). Transport of folate into the intestinal mucosa
  is mediated by glutamate carboxypepsidase II (GCPII). Vitamin B12 is transported
  into the cell bound to the B12 transport protein transcobalmin II (TCII)
