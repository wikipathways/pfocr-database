caption: Fructose promotes systemic chronic inflammation. High fructose intake leads
  to a leaky gut, which in turn induces an inflammatory response. Abnormal gut microbiology
  reduces the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and promotes the release
  of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which further activates the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
  thereby mediating various inflammatory effects. In the liver, fructose induces oxidative
  stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes, ultimately triggering
  inflammation, in a variety of ways, including by promoting uric acid (UA) accumulation,
  while fructose also activates secretion of inflammatory factors by hepatic macrophages.
  In addition, fructose intake results in elevated levels of UA and advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs) in mouse hippocampi, which in turn induces hippocampal inflammation
  via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Fructose also activates resident microglia and secretes
  inflammatory factors by causing oxidative stress in the brain. At the same time,
  SCFA relieves the inflammatory response in the brain. Fructose in the kidney ultimately
  mediates inflammation through elevated microRNA-377 (miR-377) and reduced nitric
  oxide (NO) and ATP levels while recruiting monocytes or macrophages by inducing
  monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1)
