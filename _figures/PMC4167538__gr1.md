caption: 'Role of PDEs in signal termination of PKA-mediated cAMP pathway: The cAMP-PKA
  signaling pathway can be divided into Activation and Termination phases. Activation
  phase: In the presence of cAMP (yellow) and a kinase substrate (orange), the inactive
  PKA holoenzyme dissociates to yield the cAMP-bound PKA R-subunit (blue) and the
  active PKA C-subunit (purple). Termination phase: The role of PDEs in cAMP signal
  termination was demonstrated with the PDE, RegA (). PDEs (green) mediate direct
  interactions with PKA R-subunit to hydrolyze cAMP bound to both CNB domains of PKAR.
  The resulting cAMP-free (apo) PKAR (green) is primed for reassociation with PKA
  C-subunit to form the inactive PKA holoenzyme. How PDEs interact with the R-subunit
  (RIα isoform) and catalyze hydrolysis of cAMP bound to the R-subunit to 5′AMP is
  unknown and a focus of this study (highlighted in red). We hypothesize that PDEs
  bind cAMP-bound RIα more tightly (ternary complex) than cAMP-free RIα (end-state
  complex). Space-filling models based on coordinates of structures of the different
  proteins are indicated. C-subunit (PDB:1ATP), R-subunit (cAMP-bound PKA RIα(113–379)
  (PDB:1RGS)), and RIα(91–379):C complex (PDB:2QCS). Only the monomeric deletion fragment
  of PKA RIα (residues 113—379) is shown. Apo RIα (green) is modeled on the structure
  of RIα (91–379) bound to PKA C-subunit (PDB:2QCS).'
