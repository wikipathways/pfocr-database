caption: Endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19. (A) SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces ACE2
  expression on endothelial cells, which leads to activation of the kallikrein–kinin
  system and the renin–angiotensin system. Increased des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (DABK)
  and angiotensin II (Ang II) activate bradykinin receptors (BKRs) and type 1 angiotensin
  receptors (AT1R) for prothrombotic signaling and endothelial dysfunction, whereas
  antithrombotic signaling via MAS receptors stimulated by Ang 1–7 is reduced. (B)
  Sustained immune responses in COVID-19 cause endothelial dysfunction through suppressing
  expression of anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic factors, such as nitric oxide
  (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), thrombomodulin, activated protein C, tissue factor pathway
  inhibitor (TFPI), and antithrombin III (AT III), and degradation of glycocalyx.
  (C) SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the complement system via the classical, lectin,
  and alternative pathways. Activation of C3 and C5 convertases leads to inflammation,
  thrombosis, and endothelial injury. MAC, membrane attack complex; MASP-2, mannose-binding
  lectin-associated serine protease 2.
