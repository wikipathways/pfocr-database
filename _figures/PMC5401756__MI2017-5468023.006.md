caption: Visfatin signaling. Visfatin stimulates monocytes to release IL-6. IL-6 signals
  increase the expression level of STAT3 which upregulates the active enzymatic form
  of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can increase cell survival through Sirt-1
  and Sirt-6 stimulating the release of TNF-α inducing a chronic low grade inflammation.
  In the second pathway, visfatin signals through the cells surface receptor β1 integrin.
  This binding upregulates and activates p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. The MAPK cascade increases
  the expression of AP-1 and NF-kB that upregulate SDF-1, leading to increased survival
  and migration. The third pathway was demonstrated through the activation of unknown
  receptor increasing the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
  (CAT).
