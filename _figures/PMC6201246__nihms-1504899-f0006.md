caption: 'Overview of current understanding of the pathogenesis of HIT. Step 1 (Inception):
  The afferent arm of the immune response is shown in the upper panel. Polyreactive
  IgM antibodies (cross)react with PF4 complexed with heparin, activating the classic
  pathway of complement and forming C3c-containing immune complexes that bind to B-cell
  C21 and likely accelerate antigen presentation. The efferent arm shown in the lower
  panel can be conceptually subdivided into two sequential processes. In Step 2 (Activation),
  PF4-containing complexes can bind to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and/or
  FcγRIIA (left side) or they may incorporate within or, more likely, form on cell
  surfaces bound to GAGs. These immune complexes activate FcγRIIA-dependent intracellular
  signaling pathways on platelets, monocytes and neutrophils and complement-mediated
  activation of the endothelial cells leading to a prothrombotic state. Step 3 (Propagation/Amplification)
  involves: a) the expression of tissue factor and generation of thrombin back-activates
  target cells releasing additional PF4 and b) large polymeric products from the activated
  cells, including DNA-containing NETs by granulocytes and von Willebrand Factor by
  endothelial cells that bind PF4 and therby provide additional sources of HIT antigen.
  Activated cells also release polyphosphates that bind PF4 and HIT antibody. Mixed
  polymeric complexes may form as shown at the extreme right. The net effect of Steps
  2 and 3 is a feed-forward amplification loop that may help explain the intense and
  protracted prothrombotic clinical presentation of HIT, which persists even after
  heparin has been discontinued.'
