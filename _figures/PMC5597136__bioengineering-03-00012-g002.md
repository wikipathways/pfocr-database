caption: Known and recovered GRN for SOS pathway in E. coli. (a) Diagram of interactions
  in the SOS network. DNA lesions caused by mitomycin C (MMC) (blue hexagon) are converted
  to single-stranded DNA during chromosomal replication. Upon binding to ssDNA, the
  RecA protein is activated (RecA*) and serves as a coprotease for the LexA protein.
  The LexA protein is cleaved, thereby diminishing the repression of genes that mediate
  multiple protective responses. Green arrows denote positive regulation, while red
  arrows denote negative regulation. Adapted from []. (b) Diagram of the recovered
  gene regulatory network of the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli. Green arrows denote
  positive regulation, while red arrows denote negative regulation.
