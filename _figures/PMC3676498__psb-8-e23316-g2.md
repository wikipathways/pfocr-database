caption: Figure 2. A schematic diagram of the Suc signaling pathway and its interaction
  with signaling by light and cold. Components of the intracellular Suc signaling
  pathway include the still unknown sensor, cytosolic intermediates, transcription
  factors that are target of Suc and the SURE response element found in many promoters
  exhibiting Suc regulation. Suc mimics the effect of high light and cold on a number
  of metabolic and developmental responses. Horizontal arrows indicate well-known
  (PhyA and ABA) and putative components of light and low temperature signaling pathways
  with may cross-talk with Suc.
