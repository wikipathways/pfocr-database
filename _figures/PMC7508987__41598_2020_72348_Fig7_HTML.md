caption: 'Schematic representation of β-cell metabolism under increasing fuel pressure
  (11.7 to 35 mM glucose) in the time span of 2–8 h. Measured amounts of pyruvate
  and lactate (nmol) after 2 h incubation are displayed for the three glucose concentrations.
  After 2 h incubation there is: Constant glucose consumption, constant production
  of glutamate (TCA cycle), constant production of lactate but large plasticity in
  the pyruvate pool (white circle). To account for the loss in observed pyruvate a
  divergence pathway away from the central glycolysis must take place. This divergence
  pathway (depicted as “X”) has the rate corresponding to the determined loss of pyruvate
  (0.3 nmol/min) for 11.7 and 17 mM glucose. At very high fuel pressure (35 mM) this
  metabolic pathway is not used anymore and pyruvate accumulates. Blue arrows indicate
  undetermined rates from 0–2 h. All data are scaled relative to the mildest conditions
  at 11.7 mM and 2 h for visualization (see Tab.  for actual numbers).'
