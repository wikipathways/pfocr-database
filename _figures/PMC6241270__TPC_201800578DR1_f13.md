caption: β-cc Mediates Resilience to Photooxidative Stress via the SCL14-Dependent
  Xenobiotic Response.Photooxidation under excessive light stress generates toxic
  RCS metabolites and increases β-cc concentration. β-cc induces the expression of
  SCL14 leading to enhanced expression of ANAC102 and finally a strong activation
  of the xenobiotic detoxification response. In this response, ANAC102 is upstream
  of ANAC002, ANAC032, and ANAC081 expression and consequently of the enzymes controlled
  by these transcription factors. Furthermore, the strong induction of the AER, AKR,
  ALDH, and SDR enzymes and of the glucosyl and glutathione transferases in the xenobiotic
  detoxification pathway assures the elimination of the RCS produced under stress
  conditions. Reducing RCS accumulation limits the positive feedback on lipid peroxidation
  and leads to tolerance rather than cell death.
