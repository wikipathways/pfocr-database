caption: Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization results in mtDNA leakage. The opening
  of the mPTP induces MIMP, leading to mtDNA release, a process that is further intensified
  by GRP75 deficiency. The formation of BAX/BAK macropores initiates MOMP, allowing
  greater amounts of mtDNA to be released into the cytosol, while PGAM5, the DUSP1/JNK
  pathway, and the reduction of SAM50 facilitate the recruitment of BAX to the mitochondrial
  membrane. BAX/BAK macropores can also cause the extrusion of the IMM, leading to
  mitochondrial herniation, which may directly result in IMM rupture and the release
  of mtDNA. Alternatively, this process can lead to the formation of MDV that transport
  mtDNA to lysosomes or the extracellular space. The rupture of MDV during this process
  can also lead to the release of mtDNA into the cytosol. MDV can also bud directly
  from the IMM, a process that depends on the SNX9 protein. This process is further
  enhanced by fumarate accumulation resulting from FH deficiency. Following the selective
  splicing of SASF6, BAX forms the BAX-κ splice variant, whose accumulation on the
  membrane also contributes to mtDNA leakage. VDAC oligomeric pores mediate mtDNA
  leakage by inducing MOMP. The presence of mtDNA in the intermembrane space and ox-mtDNA
  in the cytosol promotes VDAC oligomerization. Similarly, VRK2, PKC-δ, and TGF-β
  contribute to this process, while GRP75 deficiency indirectly facilitates VDAC aggregation.
  GSDMD forms pores in the mitochondrial or cellular membranes, allowing the release
  of mtDNA into the cytosol or extracellular space, with ox-mtDNA also promoting the
  formation of GSDMD pores
