caption: Ethanol metabolism and related mechanisms promoting hepatic lipids accumulation.During
  alcohol consumption, ethanol is oxidised to acetaldehyde (by the constitutive pathway
  involving the NAD-dependent ADH) or metabolised at the level of the microsomal system
  through an inducible NADPH-dependent pathway involving cytochrome P450 (MEOS). Both
  lead to the formation of acetaldehyde, which is subsequently metabolised to acetic
  acid by the 2-ADH. ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; 2-ADH, 2-alcohol dehydrogenase; AMPK,
  AMP-activated kinase; FFAs, free fatty acids; PPAR-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor a; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c.
