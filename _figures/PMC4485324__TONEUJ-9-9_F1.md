caption: 'Homocysteine-Folate Pathway: The metabolic interactions between folate,
  methionine and homocysteine are shown here. Folate from the diet is absorbed and
  converted to methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) with the formation of high-energy
  phosphate bonds by the action of MTHF reductase (MTHFR), methyl tetrahydrofolate
  is yielded which methylates homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is converted
  to SAM, the universal methyl donor. SAM provides methyl groups for several nucleic
  acid methylation reactions and gets reduced to S-adenosylhomocysteine which then
  reforms homocysteine and reinitiates the cycle. Abbreviations: SAM; S-adenosylmethionine,
  SAH; S-adenosylhomocysteine, MTHFR; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; B6 and
  B12; Vitamin B6 and Vitamin 12 respectively.'
