caption: Previously proposed models for PAS activation and methionine-mediated PAS
  inactivation. As indicated on the left, PAS is an analog of PABA (shown in a dotted
  box) and is a prodrug that is activated by the M. tuberculosis folate biosynthetic
  pathway. PAS is incorporated in lieu of PABA by FolP1 and glutamylated by FolC to
  form the antimetabolite HDHF which inhibits DfrA activity (indicated as red blunted
  arrows) (Zheng et al., ; Zhao et al., ; Minato et al., ; Dawadi et al., ). Previous
  work has identified N-methyl and N,N-dimethyl PAS species (methyl groups indicated
  with dotted red boxes) in metabolite extracts from M. tuberculosis treated with
  PAS (Chakraborty et al., ). As N,N-dimethylation of PAS prevents incorporation by
  FolP1, the resulting metabolite is inactive (shown on the right). This activity
  is presumed to be dependent upon an as of yet unidentified SAM-dependent methyltransferase(s).
  Supplementation with methionine may increase SAM pools, which could be utilized
  by the methyltransferase(s) to inactivate PAS, thereby conferring resistance. PAS,
  para-aminosalicylic acid; PABA, para-aminobenzoic acid; HDHP, 2′-hydroxy-7,8-dihydropteroate;
  HDHF, 2′-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrofolate; FolP1, dihydropteroate synthase; FolC, dihydrofolate
  synthase; DfrA, dihydrofolate reductase; MT, methyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosyl
  methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine.
