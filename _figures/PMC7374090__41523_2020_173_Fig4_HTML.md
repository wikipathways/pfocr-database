caption: Screen hit data mapped to the PI3′Kinase/AKT KEGG pathway for SUM-185 and
  SUM-229 cells showing the wide variation in essentialness for this pathway across
  these two cell lines. Screen hit data were mapped to the pathway using the KEGG
  Pathway Engine. The right panel shows the relative essentialness of this pathway
  for the SUM cell line panel. The values were derived using the KEGG Pathway Analysis
  tool.
