caption: Possible pathogenic role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
  (CTCL). (a) An early stage of a CTCL is shown in the first panel. There is a domination
  of T helper 1 (Th1) microenvironment with the contribution of IL-17, which plays
  role in promoting cytotoxic answer against extracellular pathogens (bacteria and
  fungi). Staphylococcal enterotoxins (superantigens) promote immunological dysregulation
  by causing benign lymphocytes to stimulate malignant clones. IL-17 has also been
  shown to promote the oncogenic pathway by stimulation janus kinase 3 (JAK3), which
  activates signal transducer and activator 3 (STAT3). (b) A late stage of CTCL is
  presented in the second panel. A clear domination of T helper 2 (Th2) microenvironment
  has been shown. The secretion of IL-17 may be reduced in that stage leading to local
  immunosuppression. Also, the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to be
  reduced and dysfunctional in CTCL. In case of microbiota colonization of the skin,
  dysfunction of AMPs is one of the crucial elements of impaired skin function. Angiogenesis
  is signed with a question mark on this figure, because of a possibility, that IL-17
  may promote formation of new vessels thorough all stages of the disease. The resistance
  to anti-VEGF drugs in other lymphomas, lung and colorectal cancer has been previously
  shown to be promoted by Th-17 subset of cells.
