caption: Shared alterations between young DS and AD brain. Proteins of the insulin
  signaling pathway found to be dysregulated both in young DS (<40 years) and AD brain.
  These alterations occur quite early and even before the development of AD pathology
  in DS brain, thus representing a risk factor for AD development in DS. With regards
  to GSK3β the loss of Akt-mediated inhibition was observed (). Considering that GSK3β
  is a constitutively activated kinase, reduced inhibitory processes might favor its
  aberrant activation in young DS.
