caption: 'The synergistic anti-tumour effect of combined anti-cancer treatments. The
  efficacy of many treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, target therapy,
  and immunotherapy relies on the activation of an anti-tumour immune response. The
  upregulation of CD73 is a resistance mechanism to anti-cancer therapies. While ATP,
  released from stressed and dying cells, supports the immune activation, adenosine,
  generated by CD73 catalytic activity, dampens the activity of immune cells, and
  triggers several drug resistance pathways in tumour cells. Combining blockers of
  the purinergic pathway (CD39 or CD73 inhibitors, A2AR or A2BR antagonists) or the
  combination of CD73 inhibition with other treatments (immune checkpoint inhibition,
  chemotherapy, radiotherapy, target therapy) causes synergistic anti-tumour effects,
  for example by promoting immune effector functions. ↑: increased. Solid arrow: gets
