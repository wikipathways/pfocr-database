caption: Possible epidemiological scenarios accounting for the observed increased
  incidence of early onset colorectal cancer. (A) An environmental exposure occurs
  in the total population, but an increase in colorectal cancer is not seen in patients
  that are screened, with an apparent increase in patients solely because that group
  is not screened. This scenario might imply genetic and epigenetic factors and pathways
  are like those observed in later onset colorectal cancer. (B) An environmental exposure
  occurs, but the exposure selectively affects younger populations over older populations
  (through accelerated pathogenesis), providing a true increase in colorectal cancer
  in that population without affecting older populations. This pathway might imply
  genetic and epigenetic factors and pathways that are distinct from those observed
  in later onset colorectal cancer. This scenario also implies that tumor initiation
  and possibly tumor progression are accelerated over the typical progression timeframes
  observed for later onset colorectal cancer.
