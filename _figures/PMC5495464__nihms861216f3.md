caption: Interactions of IGF and ERβ signaling pathways in malignancy. TNBC proliferation
  is regulated closely by a complex network of growth factor signaling pathways. It
  is well known that obesity and diabetes can increase insulin and insulin-like growth
  factor signaling, which in turn may stimulate specific receptors to drive the activation
  of downstream signaling pathways in TNBC. IGF-1 and IGF-2 bind receptors activating
  PI3K and Akt signaling and downstream mTOR activation that promotes protein synthesis,
  cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, EGFR is frequently
  overexpressed in TNBC and is stimulated by binding with epidermal growth factor
  (EGF). Cross-communication of EGFR signaling with ERβ may induce downstream signaling
  that contributes to tumor cell survival. ERβ is activated by estrogen (E2) and by
  synthetic estrogen receptor-selective ligands such as diarylpropionitrile (DPN)
  and can reportedly be modulated in part by breast cancer therapies such as toremifene,
  tamoxifen, and raloxifen. IGF-2 signaling may also promote acute phosphorylation
  of ERβ and late induction of ERβ transcription. Metformin, a common therapeutic
  used to manage diabetes mellitus type 2, has been demonstrated to be effective in
  partial suppression of TNBC by activating AMPK (which in turn inhibits mTOR downstream
  signaling) and/or by suppressing systemic insulin-like growth factor levels in vivo.
  Arrows represent a pathway of activation and solid lines represent inhibition. See
  text for details.
