caption: Crosstalk between ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and NF-κB pathway.
  IR activates both apoptosis and NF-κB signaling pathway. IR triggers instrinsic
  apoptosis pathway as described in . Simultaneously, NF-κB pathway is activated by
  IR-induced DNA damage. IR induced double-strand breaks (DSB) directly activates
  initiator kinase ATM and PIDD, which further recruit NEMO, also known as IKKγ, by
  multiple steps of posttranslational modification. Modified NEMO joins formation
  of IKKs signalosome and further activates classical NF-κB pathway. Upon apoptotic
  stimuli (IR or TNFα), natural Smac can bind to both XIAP and cIAPs, and predominantly
  neutralize the suppression effect of XIAP on caspases. It has been shown that cIAP-1
  physically binds to TRAF2 and regulates its function through ubiquitination in TNFα
  signaling. Smac-mimetics that function as IAP-antagonists, not only promote caspase
  activation by neutralizing IAPs, but also interferes the stability and interaction
  between cIAP-1/2 and TRAF2, thus modulate the balance between apoptosis and NF-κB
  signaling pathway.
