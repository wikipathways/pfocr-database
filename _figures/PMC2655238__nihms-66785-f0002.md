caption: Most of these reactions are catalyzed by orthologues of the E. coli Lpx enzymes.
  However, GnnA and GnnB act at the beginning of the pathway to make the unique sugar
  nucleotide, UDP-GlcNAc3N, whereas the methyltransferase and the 4′-phosphatase function
  in the later stages. GlcN3N, 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose.
