caption: The schematic side view picture indicates cell rounding and the remnants
  of cell adhesions. The activation of cyclin B/CDK1 and the downstream degradation
  of kindlin and activation of the RhoA pathway, together with the inactivation of
  RAP1-GTPase are described as the main mechanisms for cell rounding in mitosis.
