caption: Working model of HERC2 function in health and disease. In previous studies,
  we showed that independently of the ubiquitin ligase activity, HERC2 along with
  NEURL4, facilitates p53 oligomerisation to promote p53 transcriptional program activation.
  For example, the target gene p21 regulates the cell cycle and promotes cell cycle
  arrest. Under conditions of HERC2 deficiency or down-regulation, the transcriptional
  activation of p53 is impaired due to the compromised p53 oligomerisation process
  [–]. Now, with data presented in this study, we complement this working model by
  adding an important function of HERC2 dependent on its ubiquitin ligase activity.
  Under normal conditions, HERC2 controls C-RAF protein levels by regulating its ubiquitylation
  and targeting it to proteasomal degradation. Hence, in HERC2-deficient cells, C-RAF
  protein levels increase, which activates a crosstalk between the C-RAF and MKK3/p38
  signalling pathways. Once p38 is activated by phosphorylation, it translocates to
  the nucleus and activates its target transcription factors (TFs). This eventually
  activates transcription of genes related to the oxidative stress response such as
  NFE2L2, SOD1, SOD2 and GPX1, which predisposes cells to an enhanced resistance to
  oxidative stress. The combination of these effects in the p53/p21 and MKK3/p38 pathways
  may affect both tumorigenesis and neuronal cell homeostasis
