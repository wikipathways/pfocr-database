caption: Effectors can induce changes in stomatal aperture before and during infection,
  which may affect drought, osmotic, high light, and other stress adaptation processes.
  HopF2, AvrRpm1, AvrRpt2 and AvrBs induce stomatal closure. XopDXcv and BLR20 inhibit
  jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. HopM1 downregulates growth
  regulating factor 8 (GRF8), inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
  Similarly, HopF2 inhibits ROS production via BRI1‐associated kinase 1 (BAK1), Mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase kinase 5 (MKK5) and RPM1‐interacting protein 4 (RIN4). Hopz1a and
  HopX1 directly target Jasmonate ZIM‐domain (JAZ) proteins, hindering stomatal closure,
  in addition to interacting with its receptor F‐box protein Coronatine‐insensitive
  protein 1 (COI1) to induce stomatal reopening. Coronatine also targets JAZ for reopening
  of stomata. HopD1 interferes with the NTM1‐like protein 9 (NTL9) pathway, which
  is triggered by flg22‐induced pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and during stomatal
  closure. Many of the effectors shown result in a decrease in resistance in plants,
  leading to increased infection by bacteria and distribution of spores during the
  end of the fungal and oomycete life cycle. Effectors are shown in orange. Lines
  ending with arrowheads indicate interactions, whereas lines ending with a short
  orthogonal line indicate inhibition. AP2/ERFs, APETALA2/ethylene response factors;
  AQP, aquaporin; RLCK1, receptor‐like cytoplasmic kinase 1; RLKs, receptor‐like kinases;

  SnRKs, SNF‐related serine/threonine‐protein kinases; TFs, transcription factors.
