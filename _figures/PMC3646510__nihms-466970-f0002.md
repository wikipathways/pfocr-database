caption: Schematic representation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP).The UPP
  is a highly regulated ATP-dependent pathway, which is vital for the processing of
  intracellular proteins. It is also a promising target for anticancer therapeutics,
  and many metal-based or metal-binding compounds, such as CQ, DSF and Au-complexes,
  have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the proteasomal activity.
