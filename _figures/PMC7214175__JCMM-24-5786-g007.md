caption: Proposed model of metformin‐induced activation of the Hippo pathway in drug‐sensitive
  and drug‐resistant breast cancer cells. A, In drug‐sensitive cancer cells (MCF7),
  MET activates the Hippo pathway by increasing the expression KIBRA and FRMD6, which
  increases the phosphorylation of YAP and prevents its translocation and binding
  to TEAD in the nucleus. B, In drug‐resistant cancer cells (LCC2 and MCF7/TAX), MET
  activates the Hippo pathway by increasing the expression and plasma membrane localization
  of SCRIB, which increases the phosphorylation of YAP and prevents its translocation
  and binding to TEAD in the nucleus

  cancer cells by activation of the Hippo pathway.
