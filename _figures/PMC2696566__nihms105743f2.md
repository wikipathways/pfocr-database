caption: Kinase inhibitors that modulate the cell cycle have frequently been combined
  with toxic drugs and/or radiation which cause DNA damage. This will lead to inappropriate
  cell cycle progression with damage DNA and result in tumor cell death. Inhibition
  of PARP1 ADP ribosylation activity suppresses the ability of DNA damage to activate
  ATM/ATR as well as increase DNA repair processes.
