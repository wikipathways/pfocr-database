caption: 'Thyroid hormone-induced interference with resveratrol-induced antiproliferation
  is blocked by tetrac and its nanoparticulate analog. Signal transduction pathways
  are involved in resveratrol-induced antiproliferation and thyroid hormone-mediated
  proliferation in cancer cells. Thyroid hormones, as T4, in physiological concentrations,
  stimulate cancer cell proliferation via the hormone receptor site on integrin αvβ3,
  on the cell surface. Activated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) is required for hormone-dependent
  cell proliferation, as shown by the ERK1/2 cascade inhibition by the selective inhibitor,
  PD98059. A distinct receptor for the stilbene is also present on integrin αvβ3,
  through which resveratrol activates ERK1/2 and induces nuclear cyclooxygenase (COX-2)
  accumulation. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, induced by resveratrol, also translocates into
  the cell nucleus and complexes with inducible COX-2 in resveratrol-treated cancer
  cells. This is an essential upstream step in the induction by resveratrol of p53
  phosphorylation at Ser-15, and consequent p53-dependent antiproliferation. Blocking
  resveratrol-induced nuclear accumulation of COX-2 inhibits p53 phosphorylation and
  antiproliferation. T4 inhibits the formation of the intranuclear pERK1/2-COX-2–p53
  complex and consequent p53-dependent antiproliferation. The mechanism by which T4
  inhibits the generation of pERK1/2–COX-2–p53 nuclear complexes in resveratrol-exposed
  cells is not yet known. Although the activation of ERK1/2 induced by hormones and
  resveratrol is additive, the competition for pools of ERK1/2 between thyroid hormones
  and resveratrol appears to divert kinases to the cell proliferation pathway, and
  may play an important role in the inhibition by T4 of resveratrol''s pro-apoptotic
  action. Tetrac inhibits the expression of β-catenin and HMGA2, and NDAT inhibits
  the expression of RRM2, which is caused by resveratrol. In addition, both tetrac
  and NDAT activate the expression of Chibby, which binds to β-catenin and blocks
  its transcriptional activities. Thus, tetrac or NDAT may restore pro-apoptotic activity
  of resveratrol that has been lost due to the actions of endogenous thyroid hormones.
