caption: Model for the mobilization of Ty1 elements through a branch of the DNA-damage
  checkpoint pathway triggered by telomere erosion. This model is based on our findings
  and the established roles of components of the DNA-damage response and telomere
  checkpoint pathways (, , , ). (a) DNA damage can trigger arrest at the G2/M checkpoint
  and induction of DNA repair through either the Rad24/Mec1 arm or the MRX/Tel1 arm
  of the pathway. (b) The telomere checkpoint pathway utilizes some components of
  the DNA-damage checkpoint pathway to arrest growth. (c) Ty1 transposition is triggered
  by telomere erosion through the telomere checkpoint pathway, but, unlike G2/M arrest,
  activation of transposition requires Rad9 and probably Rad53.
