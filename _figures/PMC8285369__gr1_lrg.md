caption: The proposed pathway of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with uncontrolled
  immune response and cytokine storm generating myeloperoxidase (MPO) and reactive
  oxygen spcies (ROS) resulting in decreased NO and vasoconstriction, decreased O2
  and hypoxia, and vitamin B12 deficiency through tetrapyrrole ring destruction mechanism,
  and the prevention by melatonin.
