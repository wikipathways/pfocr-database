caption: Gluconeogenesis and other rescue pathways for the generation of metabolic
  intermediates in low-glucose conditions. Precursors for biomass biosynthesis are
  produced from multiple alternative nutrients, like lactate or amino acids or from
  degradation of macromolecules (via autophagy or macropinocytosis, brown arrows/box)
  during a lack of glucose. Initial steps of the gluconeogenesis pathway (orange arrows),
  mediated by PCK1 or PCK2, are key for the generation of glycolytic intermediates
  under low-glucose conditions. These may serve as precursors for different metabolic
  pathways (marked in red) necessary for the biosynthesis of cellular biomass (highlighted
  in grey) also in the absence of glucose.Furthermore, the TCA cycle and enzymes of
  pyruvate carboxylation and degradation play an important role in the degradation
  or interconversion of alternative, noncarbohydrate precursors/nutrients according
  to the cell’s demands. TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, Krebs cycle; PCK1/2,
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cytoplasmic isoform (PCK1) or mitochondrial isoform
  (PCK2); FBP1/2, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
