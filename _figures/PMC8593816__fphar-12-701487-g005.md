caption: Pathway analysis of differential metabolites between ovarian cancer tissue
  and ascites. (A) Enrichment pathway bar chart of differential metabolites in non-chemotherapy
  group vs chemotherapy group (left) and chemotherapy-sensitive group and chemotherapy-resistant
  group (right). (B) The shared pathways involved in differential metabolites and
  serological indicators. Orange or blue represent up-regulated or down-regulated
  differential metabolites, respectively. Red or green represent up-regulated or down-regulated
  serological indexes, respectively. (C) Network view of STRING analysis of genes
  related to differential metabolites (p< 0.001). (D) Proposed metabolic mechanisms
  associated with ovarian cancer. Red font represents the non-chemotherapy group and
  chemotherapy group, which is mainly involved in histidine metabolism and fatty acid
  β oxidation, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Blue font represents
  the chemotherapy-sensitivity group and chemotherapy-resistant group, which are mainly
  involved in lipid metabolism, promoting tumor proliferation and metastasis, and
  the occurrence of drug resistance. denote down-regulation/up-regulation.
