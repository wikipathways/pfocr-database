  β oxidation, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Blue font represents
  the chemotherapy-sensitivity group and chemotherapy-resistant group, which are mainly
  involved in lipid metabolism, promoting tumor proliferation and metastasis, and
  the occurrence of drug resistance. denote down-regulation/up-regulation.
