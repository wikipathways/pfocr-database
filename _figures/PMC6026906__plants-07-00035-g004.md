caption: 'Expression levels (left scale on the y-axis of each plot) of DEGs involved
  in the proanthocyanidins biosynthesis pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase;
  C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (~ trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase); CHS, chalcone
  synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase (~ leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase, putative); ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; TT12, transparent testa 12-like
  protein (putative vacuole flavan-3-ol/proton antiporter involved in the transportation
  of proanthocyanidin precursors into the vacuole of the seed coat endothelium); TT13,
  transparent testa 13-like protein (putative tonoplast ATPase proton pump in the
  tonoplast of seed coat generating the driving force for TT12-mediated transport
  of PA precursors to the vacuole); LAC19, laccase (putatively responsible of the
  oxidative polymerization of flavan-3-ols); Rc, bHLH transcription factor (regulating
  proanthocyanidin production in seeds). In addition, two putative regulatory genes,
  not included in the list of DEGs because of their low expression levels and relatively
  high variance, but that could act as determinants in the accumulation of PAs in
  seed coat endothelium (owing to their similarity to arabidopsis genes having such
  function), encode for: TT2, transparent testa 2-like protein (a putative R2R3 MYB
  domain transcription factor); TTG2, transparent testa glabra 2-like protein (a WRKY
  transcription factor). The final evident outcome of this pathway is the reddish
  color of the seed coat, due to the oxidation of PAs to phlobaphenes (the image shows
  maturing red rice seeds at two stages: before and after PAs oxidation). Error bars
  represent standard errors (n = 3 repeats for each mean).'
