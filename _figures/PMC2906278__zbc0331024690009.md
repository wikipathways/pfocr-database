caption: 'Schematic comparison of proposed pathways for activation of IClswell by
  TNF-α and thrombin. An activated TNF-α receptor is endocytosed into a Rab5-positive
  early endosome. This compartment also contains ClC-3 and Nox1 and is the site of
  TNF-α-mediated ROS production, as previously demonstrated (). These proteins, including
  whatever mediates IClswell, may become incorporated into the endosome by endocytosis
  from the plasma membrane (as shown) but could also come from a different source,
  such as a post-Golgi vesicle. ClC-3-dependent superoxide and subsequently hydrogen
  peroxide production within this compartment are required for activation of IClswell.
  This could occur by several mechanisms: 1) direct activation via diffusion of H2O2
  from the endosome to the plasma membrane, 2) direct activation within the early
  endosome, or 3) indirect activation of IClswell via modification of an associated
  protein or signaling pathway which has the ability to activate IClswell (not pictured).
  The ability of S25N Rab11 to interfere with current activation by TNF-α favors the
  effect of H2O2 on IClswell taking place within endosomes. This mechanism is appealing
  because it compartmentalizes the H2O2 required for current activation. Thrombin
  also signals via Nox1 but does not cause endocytosis (), suggesting that ROS are
  produced at the plasma membrane. Thrombin-mediated IClswell activation is therefore
  sensitive to catalase but is not impaired in ClC-3 null cells; nor is it inhibited
  by S34N Rab5. The dependence of activation of IClswell by TNF-α, thrombin, hypotonicity,
  and ClC-3 overexpression on ClC-3, H2O2, and Rab5 are summarized in the inset table.
