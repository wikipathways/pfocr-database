caption: 'Deregulation of Hippo pathway in gastric cancer. The schematic representation
  of Hippo signaling deregulation in gastric carcinogenesis. In normal gastric epithelium,
  YAP1/TAZ is strongly negatively regulated and quenched in the cytoplasm by the activated
  Hippo signaling pathway. miR-15a/16-1/506 also exerts its tumor suppressor function
  by targeting YAP1. In gastric cancer (GC) cells, the upstream of Hippo pathway,
  MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are down-regulated and fail to phosphorylate YAP1/TAZ. YAP/TAZ
  is then translocated to the nucleus and binds with TEAD transcription factors to
  transcriptionally activate the downstream targets. Meanwhile, downregulation of
  miR-15a/16-1/506 and VGLL4, an antagonist of YAP1, are partially responsible for
  the activation of YAP1 in GC. YAP1: Yes-associated protein 1; MST1/2: Mammalian
  Ste20-like kinase 1 and 2; LATS1/2: Large tumor suppressor 1 and 2.'
