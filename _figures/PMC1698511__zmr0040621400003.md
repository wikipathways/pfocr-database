caption: PKR is an intermediary component in TLR signaling. PKR is implicated in the
  LPS/TLR4-mediated pathway probably recruited by the TIRAP complex. PKR is also involved
  during the dsRNA/TLR3 pathway, recruited by a TAK1-containing complex. Several proteins
  act downstream from PKR, such as TRAF6, which has been identified downstream of
  PKR in the signaling cascades triggered by TLR3 and TLR4. Moreover, TRAF3 is also
  involved in PKR downstream events during the activation of TLR3. The activation
  of these pathways in turn triggers the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. RIGI/MDA5
  in response to dsRNA signaling is indicated.
