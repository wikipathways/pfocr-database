caption: Regulation of non-canonical NF-κB pathway. a In steady-state, newly synthesized
  NIK is targeted for ubiquitination-dependent degradation mediated by the cIAP-TRAF2-TRAF3
  E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which prevents NIK accumulation and non-canonical NF-κB
  activation. b Ligation of specific TNFR superfamily members by their ligands (TNF
  family members) induces the recruitment of TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP to the receptor complex,
  followed by K48 ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3, resulting in stabilization
  and accumulation of NIK. NIK, together with IKKα, mediates p100 phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination-dependent process, to generate p52 and allow p52-RelB heterodimer
  to enter the nucleus for target gene transcription. c Activation of non-canonical
  NF-κB by MAC involves the formation of an endosome-based signaling complex containing
  NIK, AKT and MAC. AKT mediates NIK stabilization and IKKα phosphorylation and activates
  downstream non-canonical NF-κB. Non-canonical NF-κB is negatively regulated through
  TRAF3 deubiquitination mediated by OTUD7B and degradation of NIK mediated by IKKα,
  TBK1, CHIP, NLRP12, Peli1 and CRL4DCAF2. NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TRAF3, TNFR-associated
  factor 3; TRAF2, TNFR-associated factor 2; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting
  protein; NLRP12, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat containing proteins
  12; cIAP1/2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2; MAC, complement membrane activation
  complex
