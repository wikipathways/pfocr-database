caption: 'TRIMs in other signaling pathways. Relationship between TRIM family members
  and the AKT, MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in different tumors and their
  regulatory mechanisms. Knockdown of TRIM proteins is indicated by a lightened color
  of the same pattern. AKT signaling pathway (red): Knockdown of TRIM26 significantly
  reduced the levels of p-Akt, p-GSK3β, β-catenin and c-Myc in bladder cancer cells,
  and inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of bladder cancer cells
  by inhibiting the Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. TRIM44 is involved in the phosphorylation
  of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream target gene STAT3, which significantly
  promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of human esophageal cancer cells.
  Knockdown of TRIM47, TRIM31 and TRIM59 inhibited tumorigenesis and development by
  inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. TRIM32 promotes cell growth by enhancing AKT activity
  and glucose transport. TRIM27 promotes EMT and activates p-Akt to promote cell proliferation,
  invasion and migration.'
