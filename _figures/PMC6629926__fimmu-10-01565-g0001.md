caption: The role of ARG1 and IDO1 in neoplasia and autoimmunity. The up-regulation
  of ARG1 activity, induced by the cytokine TGF-β, transforms l-arginine (l-Arg) into
  l-ornithine (l-Orn), which is further metabolized by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)
  into polyamines (PUT, putrescine; SPD, spermidine; and SPM, spermine). SPD, through
  the activation of the Src kinase, promotes the phosphorylation of IDO1 and thus
  favors the initiation of immunoregulatory signaling events in DCs. Once phosphorylated,
  IDO1 recruits tyrosine phosphatases (SHPs) and promotes a signaling pathway that
  upregulates the expression of genes coding for IDO1 and TGF-β, thus creating a self-sustaining
  circuitry responsible for the maintenance of immune tolerance over the long-term.
  Moreover, IDO1 catalyzes the conversion of l-tryptophan (l-Trp) into l-kynurenine
  (l-Kyn), which activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR further induces
  IDO1 expression in DCs and sustains the production of polyamines by up-regulating
  ODC. Whereas the pathogenetic and protective role of TGF-β, SPD, and IDO1 in neoplasia
  and autoimmunity, respectively, have been demonstrated, the role of ARG1 has been
  unclear and would require further investigations. Gray arrows indicate the pathogenetic
  effects of IDO1, ARG1, SPD, and TGF-β1 receptor signaling in neoplasia and brown
  arrows indicate the putative protective effects of IDO1, SPD, ARG1, and TGF-β1 receptor
  signaling in autoimmune diseases. Dotted lines are for molecules whose role is still
  unclear.
