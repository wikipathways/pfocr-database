caption: The main steps of carotenoid biosynthesis and related pathways in plants.
  The methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway produces isoprenoids in plastids
  leading to the production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Phytoene synthase
  (PSY) is the first enzyme in the carotenogenic pathway and produces phytoene. In
  plants, phytoene is then desaturated and isomerized by phytoene desaturase (PDS),
  ζ–carotene desaturase (ZDS), ζ–carotene isomerase (Z-ISO) and prolycopene isomerase
  (CRTISO) forming lycopene. In bacteria, these reactions are carried out by a single
  multifunctional enzyme, phytoene desaturase (CRTI). β-carotene is produced if lycopene
  is cyclized only by lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB) whilst α-carotene is produced if both
  LCYB and lycopene ε-cyclase (LCYE) are involved. β-carotene hydroxylase (CHYB) and
  ε-carotene hydroxylase (CHYE) produce lutein. CHYB produces zeaxanthin, which can
  be converted into violaxanthin by zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). The reverse step can
  be carried out by violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE). Violaxanthin is the precursor
  of abscisic acid. Dotted arrows indicate multiple enzymatic reactions. Solid gray
  arrows represent different steps of the carotenogenic pathway. The blue arrow indicates
  consecutive desaturations carried out by bacterial CRTI.
