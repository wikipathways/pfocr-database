caption: (A) Vaccinia B1 kinase overlaps with cytoplasmic localized host BAF protein
  whereas vaccinia B12 pseudokinase shares a nuclear subcellular localization with
  the nuclear fraction of BAF. (B) The B1 kinase participates in restriction of BAF’s
  antiviral function against vaccinia DNA replication in the cytoplasm, while also
  repressing B12 negative regulation of vaccinia DNA replication through an unknown
  mechanism that is partly mediated via BAF regulation. Direct interactions and/or
  signaling through additional factors may be required for B1-B12 signaling and B12-BAF
  signaling, and are depicted using gold lines. B1-BAF interaction and BAF binding
  to dsDNA are direct interactions and denoted in black lines.
