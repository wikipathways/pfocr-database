caption: The nectin adhesion pathway (positive regulation of JNK cascade) was more
  active in the nonresponder tumors (upper panel) than in the responder tumors (lower
  panel). The pathway is shown as an interacting network in which green arrows indicate
  activation. Gene expression values were geometrically averaged for responders and
  nonresponders. The depth of color of each node of the network corresponds to the
  logarithms of the case-to-normal (CNR) expression rate for each node, in which “normal”
  is a geometric average between normal tissue samples. The normal tissue gene expression
  profiles for healthy donors were taken from the ANTE database (). The scale represents
  the extent of up/down-regulation of the pathway nodes. PAL (pathway activation level)
  was calculated using the Oncobox software (described in Methods).
