caption: SIRPα-CD47 axis protects cancer cell from phagocytosis. Multiple transcription
  factors regulate CD47 expression in response to intracellular oncogenic activation
  pathways or extracellular stimuli. The new synthesized CD47 protein is delivered
  to the cellular surface by binding to SET/RAC complex proteins, which undergoes
  pyroglutamate formation by cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL) shortly after biosynthesis
  leading to increased phagocytosis resistance. In addition, the CD47 protein on the
  surface of the exosomes inhibits phagocytosis.
