caption: Summary of signaling pathway. A diagram of the signaling pathway of OPN3
  through Gαs, which increases cAMP through AC. Increases in cAMP activates PKA, which
  can promote several downstream pathways of ASM relaxation. GRK2 is activated through
  PKA, thereby regulating OPN3 signaling. αs = Gαs; AC = adenylyl cyclase.
