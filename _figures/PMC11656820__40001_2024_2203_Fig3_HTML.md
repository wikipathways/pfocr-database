caption: Function of dysregulated Tim-3 pathway in sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
  In sepsis, DCs can recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), thereby initiating the synthesis of cytokines and promoting naive T cells
  differentiation and activation. However, the interaction of Galectin-9 and Tim-3
  in DCs can inhibit this process. Th1 cells have the capability to secrete substantial
  quantities of Galectin-9 during sepsis. Thereby, Th1 can induce the development
  of Foxp3+ Tregs cells while inhibit the development of pro-inflammation IL-17 producing
  Th cells (Th17). The expression of Tim-3 is significantly elevated on Th17 cells,
  and its signaling pathway induces the death of Th17 cells while leading to a decrease
  in IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α production. The activation of Tim-3 signaling on naive
  T cells leads to their differentiation into Treg cells. Tim-3 signaling promotes
  the secretion of the effector molecules IL-10, perforin, and granzyme A from Treg
  cells. IL-10 will decrease MHC II expression on APCs and reduce the ability of APCs
  to present antigen. Increased production of perforin and granzyme A leads to enhanced
  lysis of NK and CD8+ T cells. Tim-3 signaling also reduces the cytotoxicity of NK
  and CD8+ T cells. The secretion of IL-12 by DCs upon exposure to LPS significantly
  upregulates the expression of Tim-3 in NKT cells. In addition, Galectin-9 can synergize
  with LPS to enhance IL-12 production in DCs. Tim-3 serves as an activation marker
  of NKT cells in the early phase of sepsis. Tim-3+ NKT cells produced more proinflammatory
  cytokines and FasL and CD25/29. However, upregulation of Tim-3 also induces NKT
  cell apoptosis. The binding of α-Lactose to Galectin-9 hindered the production of
  IL-12 in DCs cells, thereby diminishing apoptosis and the expression of Tim-3 in
  NKT cells
