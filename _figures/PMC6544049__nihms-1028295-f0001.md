caption: The molecular clock in flies and mammals is composed of transcriptional and
  translational feedback networks. In flies, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) heterodimerize
  and activate transcription of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes by binding
  to E-box elements in their promoters. The protein products PER and TIM heterodimerize
  and enter the nucleus following phosphorylation (P) by proteins such as doubletime
  (DBT) or casein kinase II (CKII), and repress the transcriptional activity of CLK-CYC.
  In mammals, the circadian clock comprises a similar feedback network, including
  CLOCK and the CYC homologue brain and muscle ARNT-like (BMAL), which activate the
  transcription of per and cryptochrome (cry) genes via E-box elements. PERs and CRYs
  heterodimerize in the cytoplasm following phosphorylation by proteins such as casein
  kinase Iε (CKIε), and enter the nucleus where they inhibit CLOCK-BMAL transcriptional
  activation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylates BMAL, repressing
  BMAL-CLOCK activity. Putative mechanisms linking melatonin (MEL) rhythms and the
  circadian clock include repression of adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase
  A (PKA), a pathway known to influence cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein
  (CREB) activation. A second mechanism is thought to activate the MAPK-CREB cascade,
  through Ca2+ influx, leading to transcriptional activity through CRE elements in
  the per promoters. An analogous putative pathway is shown for Drosophila melanogaster,
  in which MAPK phosphorylation represses CLK-CYC or activates CREB, leading to per
  transcrption.
