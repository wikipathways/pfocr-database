caption: 'Diagram illustrating the biosynthetic pathway of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids
  from dietary precursors. The biosynthesis of EPA (20:5n-3) and DHA (22:6n-3) from
  dietary α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) from linoleic
  acid (18:2n-6), requires a series of common and competitive microsomal elongation
  and delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase-mediated reactions. The final synthesis of DHA
  requires additional modifications within peroxisomes. Preformed DHA (22:6n-3), the
  principle membrane esterified n-3 fatty acid, and EPA can be obtained directly from
  the diet. COX-2 mediated metabolism of DHA and arachidonic acid yields anti-inflammatory
  docosenoids and proinflammatory eicosanoids, respectively. Because the n-6 and n-3
  arms compete for common biosynthetic enzymes, elevations in the dietary LA : ALA
  ratio increase n-6 fatty acid biosynthesis (reflected as reductions in membrane
  LA and elevations in downstream fatty acid metabolites) and reduced n-3 fatty acid
  biosynthesis from ALA (reflected as reductions in membrane EPA+DHA).'
