caption: IPA to identify the signaling pathway associated with the differentially
  expressed proteins across all the conditions studied. Differently expressed proteins
  obtained from the pair of analysis between (A) TNL vs TL, (B) PTB vs TL, (C) PTB
  vs PPROM, and (D) PPROM vs TL were submitted to IPA analysis. The networks representing
  the higher score were lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and small molecule
  biochemistry in each pair of analysis. Each network displays the genes as nodes
  and the relationships between the nodes as lines. The color intensity of each node
  indicates the degree of regulation (high = red; or low = pink) of the respective
  gene transcript.
