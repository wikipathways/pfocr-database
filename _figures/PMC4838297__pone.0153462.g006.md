caption: Physiologically, stimulus by a low dosage of TNF-α causes cellular ROS production
  through the activation of NOX and downstream signaling (MAPK/NF-κB). The activated
  NOX/MAPK/c-JUN/NF-κB signaling is concomitant with the increased expression of COX-2
  and production of PGE2. G6PD knockdown results in the reduced generation of cellular
  NADPH and an impairment of TNF-α-induced NOX activation. Consequently, COX-2 expression
  and PGE2 production are also less in G6PD-knockdown cells, suggesting the participation
  of G6PD in the TNF-α-induced inflammatory response against viral infection.
