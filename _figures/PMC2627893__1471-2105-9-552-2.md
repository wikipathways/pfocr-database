caption: BiNA GUI. For the gene expression omnibus data set GDS1312, containing human
  lung cancer samples and normal controls, the result of the cell cycle pathway is
  sown. The performed gene set enrichment analysis computed a p-value of 0.0074, providing
  evidence for a clear up-regulation of the cell cycle in lung cancer. All genes are
  colored with respect to their over-expression, the tale green complexes correspond
  to protein complexes.
