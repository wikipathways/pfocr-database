caption: Schematic representation of the Wnt and PI3K/AKT pathways involved in macrophage
  polarization and metastatic progression in the tumor microenvironment of ovarian
  cancer. The figure illustrates how cancer cells in ovarian tumors release factors
  into the ascites fluid, including Wnt5a, which binds to Frizzled receptors on naïve
  macrophages, activating β-catenin signaling and promoting a shift toward an M2 macrophage
  phenotype. In the tumor cells, the PI3K/AKT/mTORC2 pathway upregulates HO-1, leading
  to IL-10 production, which further aids in immune modulation and supports the M2
  macrophage polarization. The M2 macrophages, characterized by high expression of
  markers such as ARG1, CD163, TGF-β, CD206, and IL-10, facilitate metastatic progression
  by promoting cellular interactions via Metadherin and CEACAM1 receptors. The transcriptional
  activation of β-catenin in both macrophages and cancer cells enhances the transcription
  of genes associated with immune suppression and metastasis. Key signaling molecules
  in the M2 macrophages, including CCL3, IL-10, IFN-γ, and NF-κB, contribute to the
  tumor-promoting environment
