caption: Signaling pathways associated with AQP5 in cancer. AQP5 is able to activate
  the EGFR/ERK/p38 MAPK pathway and also increase the phosphorylation of Rb protein
  by activating the Ras/ERK/Rb signaling pathway. In ovarian cancer, it was found
  that there was a positive correlation between AQP5 protein expression and NF-κB.
  However, this is not the case in all cancer cells, as detailed in the manuscript.
  AQP5 can also enhance the phosphorylation of AKT to promote tumor cell proliferation.
  EMT is one of the key molecular steps in cancer distant metastasis. Overexpression
  of AQP5 can upregulate p-Smad2/3 and Wnt/β-catenin, thereby activating EMT. In summary,
  AQP5 participates in tumor proliferation and migration through a variety of complex
  signaling pathways. AQP5, aquaporin-5; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK,
  extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-κB; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; Ras, reticular activating system;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; TGF-β, tumor growth factor-β; p, phosphorylated.
