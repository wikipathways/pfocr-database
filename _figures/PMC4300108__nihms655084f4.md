caption: A) Recent studies describe a complex network of cell-cell signaling that
  controls the spatiotemporal pattern of RD gene expression during eye development.
  The point of the color-coded summary shown here is not to follow the individual
  interactions in detail, but simply to note that all of these five cell-cell signaling
  pathways contribute to the spatiotemporal regulation of the RD genes that was summarized
  in . This summary is probably incomplete, for example Dpp and Wg signaling pathways
  often act antagonistically, but most of the targets of Dpp have not been tested
  for regulation by Wg[]. The figure also vertically compresses regulation by extracellular
  signals into a single layer, although in reality regulation is rendered multi-layered
  by regulatory relationships between the RD genes themselves. For example, Dac is
  necessary and sufficient for tsh repression, so it is possible that Hh and Dpp may
  regulate tsh indirectly as a secondary target of dac, which requires Hh and Dpp
  signaling for its expression[]. As a result of the extensive regulation, the dynamic
  RD gene expression patterns contain information about the extracellular signaling
  pathway activities, and which could be conferred on further target genes in turn.B)
  Regulation of hedgehog. The enhancer responsible for eye expression is bound directly
  by Pnt, an Ets-domain transcription factor regulated by the EGFR/Ras/MAPK pathway
  of extracellular signals, and the RD protein SO[]. This combinatorial scheme resembles
  the paradigm established for dorsal appendages (see ).C) Regulation of shaven (dPax-2).
  The sparkling (spa) enhancer responsible for eye expression is bound directly by
  Pnt and by Su(H), the transcription factor regulated by Notch signaling, as well
  as the Runx-family transcription factor Lozenge{[]. Lz is not an RD gene, but its
  expression in the eye is itself regulated by So, bringing spa under RD control indirectly[].D)
  Regulation of atonal. Enhancer sequences that would be direct targets of Hh and
  Dpp signaling have not been found[,]; the observed dependence of ato expression
  on Hh and Dpp may instead be explained by the Hh- and Dpp-dependence of ey and so
  expression. Hh and Dpp regulate both ey and so expression, repressing ey and turning
  so on []. This regulation is itself likely to be multi-layered, since Ey appears
  to be a direct regulator of so expression (not diagrammed)[,], and since it is not
  known whether Mad (or Brinker) and Ci proteins bind directly to enhancers of the
  ey and so genes, or act indirectly through intermediate transcription factors. The
  Ey and So proteins are coexpressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow, Ey declining
  as So rises. Transcription of ato initiates within the overlap. It is interesting
  that ato is activated by transcription factors that are co-expressed only transiently;
  in principle this provides a mechanism for a transient stripe of ato activation.
  The ato enhancer is active in only a subset of the cells coexpressing Ey and So,
  however, and other data also suggest that additional factors are also likely to
  limit ato transcription[].
