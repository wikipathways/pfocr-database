caption: (A) Diagrammatic representation of key genes involved in the carbon and nitrogen
  metabolic pathway in rice plants. NR, nitrate reductase; NiR, nitrite reductase;
  GS, glutamine synthetase; GOGAT, glutamate synthase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  AS, asparagine synthetase; RUBISCO, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase;
  PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Prominent changes in the gene expression
  levels in TL35 plants compared to wildtype plants at the booting stage under low
  nitrogen (B) and high nitrogen (C) conditions, and in TL44 plants compared to wildtype
  plants under low nitrogen (D) and high nitrogen (E) conditions. Red and blue dots
  indicate up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. The gene expression level was
  measured from three biological replications and each sample was measured at least
  five times.
