caption: (A) Time-line of experimental procedures for pifithrin-α treatment of the
  latently infected (LI) condition. For the majority of experiments pifithrin-α was
  maintained in culture from day 10 to 17. (B) CD4 and p24 Gag staining from a representative
  donor throughout the experiment. Numbers in dot-plots represent percentages. (C)
  p24 Gag positive CD4 negative cells from 5 independent donors at day 13 and day
  17 in cells treated (purple symbols) or untreated (black symbols) with pifithrin-α.
  (D) p24 Gag positive CD4 negative cells at day 19 following reactivation of LI cells
  with αCD3/αCD28 beads at day 17 in cells previously treated (purple symbols) or
  untreated (black symbols) with pifithrin-α (day 10 to 17). As a negative control,
  p24 Gag positive CD4 negative cells were also assessed in unstimulated cells treated
  with pifithrin-α in a similar manner. (E) In a deviation from the time-line presented
  in (A), pifithrin-α was added only during the reactivation period from day 17 to
  19. p24 positive CD4 negative cells were then determined at day 19 following reactivation
  of LI cells that were treated (salmon symbols) or untreated (black symbols) with
  pifithrin-α. As a negative control, p24 Gag positive CD4 negative cells were also
  assessed in unstimulated cells treated with pifithrin-α in a similar manner. (F)
  HIV-1 integration analysis in LI cells at day 17 using Alu-PCR with 250 ng of genomic
  DNA. As a negative control, HIV-1 integration was also assessed in uninfected cells.
  (G) Correlation of integrated HIV-1 with the percentage of p24 Gag positive CD4
  negative cells after reactivation with αCD3/αCD28 beads. Correlation was determined
  using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Black symbols represent untreated samples
  and purple symbols represent cells treated with pifithrin-α from day 10 to 17. (H)
  Reactivation index calculated as the percentage of cells expressing p24 (day 19)
  after αCD3/αCD28 reactivation divided by the number of integrated copies before
  reactivation (day 17). Throughout this figure each donor is represented with a different
  symbol and significance was determined with a paired t-test (p-values provided).
