caption: Diversity of metabolic arrangements for α-glucan and disaccharide pathways
  in the context of prokaryotes. (A) The classical glycogen metabolism (GlgC-GlgA-GlgB)
  and independent trehalose metabolism (OtsA-OtsB) pathways in E. coli. (B) The glycogen
  metabolism via maltose 1-phosphate (M1P; GlgM-GlgE) is connected with the production
  of extracellular capsular α-glucan in M. tuberculosis. Essential wiring of the trehalose
  metabolism (TreS-Pep2/Mak; TreZ-TreY) permits the redundancy for the production
  of trehalose or α-glucan. (C) The glycogen metabolism in P. aeruginosa highlights
  the use of an UGPase (lack of GlgC/AGPase) for the GlgA-dependent biosynthesis of
  α(1→4)-glucan. It is worth noting the presence of GlgE, concurrent in the synthesis
  of α(1→4)-glucan via maltose 1-phosphate and TreS-Pep2/Mak. P. aeruginosa lacks
  a direct/dedicated pathway for the biosynthesis of trehalose, relying on maltose
  interconversions via the MalQ and TreZ-TreY pathways. (D) The glycogen metabolism
  of S. venezuelae relies on the trehalose pathway via an OtsA GDP-glucose-dependent
  synthesis. (E) An overall view of the cyanobacteria classical glycogen metabolism
  (GlgC-GlgA-GlgB). The sucrose synthesis is via SPS/SPP or SuS, and the alternative
  production of α(1→4)-glucan via amylosucrase (AMS). (F) An overall view of the archaea
  classical glycogen metabolism (GlgC-GlgA-GlgB). Note the alternative production
  of trehalose via TreT. (G) Charts showing the different folds of enzymes geometric
  symbols used for NDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases (blue hexagons), GT-B GTs (yellow
  circles), TIM barrel folds (red boxes), HAD domain phosphorylases (green parallelograms),
  and the maltokinase (violet trapezium). Nucleotide sugars are indicated with small
  colored rhombuses according to the legend
