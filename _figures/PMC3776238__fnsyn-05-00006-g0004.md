caption: TNF-α regulates synaptic loss, synaptic transmission, and plasticity. (A)
  TNF-α secreted by microglia and astrocytes up-regulates arachidonic acid (AA) via
  the NF-κ B pathway that leads to synaptic loss by activating pro-apoptotic factors.
  The elevated AA signaling also down-regulates the expression of post-synaptic proteins
  drebrin and PSD-95, and pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin. In addition, TNF-α regulates
  intracellular calcium levels through the NF-κ B pathway by regulating calcium entry
  through VDCCs, while suppressing glutamate receptor agonist-induced currents in
  hippocampal neurons. Lastly, TNF-α blocks the early phase of LTP through the activation
  of TNFR1 and mGluRs and this process is dependent on p38 MAPK, IP3 receptor-mediated
  calcium release via PLC and Aβ. (B) Glia-derived TNF-α signals through pre- and
  post-synaptic TNFR1 to regulate pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release and the surface
  expression of AMPARs and GABAA receptors, respectively. In spinal cord outer lamina
  II neurons, TNF-α increases spontaneous EPSC frequency via TRPV1-mediated glutamate
  release that is mediated by AC, PKA, and ERK pathways from pre-synaptic terminals.
  At the post-synapse, TNF-α promotes GluA2-lacking AMPAR trafficking to the surface
  and induces GABAA receptor endocytosis.
