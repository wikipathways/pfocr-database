caption: 'Diagram of the σEpathway.Notes: In the absence of extracytoplasmic stress,
  σE is sequestered at the bacterial inner membrane through its interaction with the
  anti-sigma factor RseA. In the presence of unfolded outer membrane proteins or other
  stress, RseA is degraded in a sequential manner by the proteases DegS and RseP (also
  known as YaeL), releasing σE into the cytoplasm where it directs transcription of
  stress-inducible genes.'
