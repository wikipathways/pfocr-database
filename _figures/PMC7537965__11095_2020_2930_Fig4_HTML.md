caption: '(a) A venn diagram showing overlaps between BCG genetic mimics and key hubs
  with SARS-CoV-2 and Corona viruses interactomes. (b) Top “pathway map” with the
  highest level of enrichment by genes in BCG-CGS. This map is generated using MetaCore
  from Clarivate Analytics. Red thermometers indicate genes overexpressed in response
  to BCG treatment, and the hight of the red bars is representative of the differential
  gene expression level (i.e., log2 values of the fold change). The numbers under
  the thermometers 1–5 refer to the experiment number: 1) gene expression on day 0
  in response to BCG vaccination to a BCG-naïve population on day 1; 2) gene expression
  on day 0 in response to BCG re-vaccination to a previously vaccinated population;
  3) gene expression on day 14 in response to BCG vaccination to a BCG-naïve population;
  4) gene expression on day 14 in response to BCG re-vaccination to a previously vaccinated
  population, and 5) positive connections from the connectivity map, and the red bar
  in the thermometer number 5 represents presence of the gene only.'
