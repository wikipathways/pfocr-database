caption: Network of lipid metabolism genes modulated by miRNAs differentially expressed
  between OF-EVs and UF-EVs. A Selected LMGs found to be modulated by differently
  expressed miRNAs (PPARGC1B, CD36, LDLR, PNPLA2, ELOVL6, FASN, and ELOVL5). B Networks
  of miRNAs and genes related with the uptake of lipids. C Networks of miRNAs and
  genes related with the transport of lipid. D Networks of miRNAs and genes related
  to the synthesis of lipids. E Networks of miRNAs and genes related with accumulation
  of lipid droplets. F Networks of miRNAs and genes related to lipolysis. Continuous
  lines indicate a direct relationship, while dashed lines indicate an indirect relationship.
  Networks were generated by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and only experimentally
  observed relationships were selected
