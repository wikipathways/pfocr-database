caption: Tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism and transport across the blood-brain
  barrier. In a normal physiological state, ~90% of the tryptophan that is not incorporated
  into protein is metabolized through the kynurenine pathway (). Tryptophan and kynurenine
  both access brain tissue through the large neutral amino acid transporter protein
  here visualized as an orange circle (). The green plus signs indicate the induction
  of IDO and TDO by pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol, respectively. 5-HIAA
  is 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Broken arrows indicate metabolic steps not detailed
  in the figure.
