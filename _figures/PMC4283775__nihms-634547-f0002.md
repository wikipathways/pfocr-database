caption: In the neddylation pathway, Mg++ATP and nedd8 bind NAE nucleotide binding
  site, react to yield nedd8-AMP, and release inorganic pyrophosphate. Nedd8-AMP then
  react with the thiol of the NAE active site cysteine, form the NAE-nedd8 thioester,
  and release AMP. A second ATP and nedd8 bind AppBp1/Uba3 to form nedd8-AMP, resulting
  in the fully loaded complex containing two nedd8 molecules, covalently bound nedd8
  thioester and nedd8-AMP that occupies the NAE adenylation domain. This form of NAE
  activates the transfer of nedd8 to the conjugating enzyme by a transthiolation reaction.
  Subsequently, nedd8 is covalently attached to a Cullin in a lysine residue in the
  conserved Cullin domain. Neddylation of the Cullin activates the Cullin ubiquitin
  ligase. In the ubiquitination pathway, Uba1 functions similarly to NAE, but activates
  ubiquitin, which is ligated to target proteins when Cullin ubiquitin ligase are
  activated by neddylation. A Cul1 ubiquitin ligase complex (purple) known as SCF
  complex, is given as an example. The SCF complex consists of the zinc-finger protein,
  which binds to the C-terminus of Cul1, the adaptor protein Skp1, which binds to
  the N-terminus of Cul1. The substrate β-catenin is recruited by a specific F-box
  protein βTrCP1. The ubiquitin chain is recognized by the 26S proteasome, which leads
  to proteasomal degradation.
