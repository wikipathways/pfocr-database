caption: FtbZIP5 of Fagopyrum tataricum is involved in the ABA-dependent signaling
  pathway and may improve the stress tolerance of plants via the phosphorylation of
  FtSnRK2.6. Dotted and dashed lines indicate that the relationship between the two
  is not directly proved, while complete arrow lines indicate that it has been confirmed.
