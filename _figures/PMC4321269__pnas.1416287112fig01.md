caption: Overview of the intracellular and intercellular Notch signaling pathway.
  Notch, the transmembrane receptor of one cell, binds to Delta or Jagged, the transmembrane
  ligands belonging to the neighboring cell. This trans-interaction cleaves the Notch
  receptor to release NICD. NICD migrates to the nucleus and modulates the transcription
  of many genes. This modulation indirectly leads to the transcriptional activation
  of Notch and Jagged and inhibition of Delta. Interaction between Notch receptor
  and ligands (Delta or Jagged) of the same cell (cis-interaction) leads to the degradation
  of both the receptor and the ligand. Glycosylation of Notch by Fringe modifies Notch
  to have higher affinity for binding to Delta and lower affinity for binding to Jagged.
