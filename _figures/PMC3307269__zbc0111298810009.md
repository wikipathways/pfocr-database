caption: Schematic representation of the regulation of Wnt pathway by malin and laforin.
  Laforin is shown to function as a phosphatase for GSK-3β. It stimulates the degradation
  of β-catenin and down-regulates Wnt signaling by activating GSK-3β (). Our finding
  shows that malin down-regulates Wnt pathway by promoting degradation of Dvl2. Therefore,
  the loss of function of either malin or laforin could result in aberrant Wnt signaling,
  which might be one of the possible cause of LD pathogenesis.
