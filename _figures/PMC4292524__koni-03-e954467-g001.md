caption: Immunotherapeutic targeting of PD-1 and PDL1 reciprocal interactions between
  osteosarcoma cells and T cells. Binding of the T-cell inhibitory receptor programmed
  cell death 1 (PD-1) to its cognate ligand PDL1 on the surface of cancer cells inactivates
  T-cell cytotoxic functions that otherwise would induce osteosarcoma cell death.
  Abrogating this pathway with anti-PD-1 or PDL1 blocking antibodies (or inhibitors)
  prevents this inhibition, and allows the reactivation of T-cell anticancer cytotoxic
  functions. Adding immune activators, such as cytokines, may elicit a synergistic
  response to anti-PD-1/PDL1 targeted therapies in osteosarcoma.
