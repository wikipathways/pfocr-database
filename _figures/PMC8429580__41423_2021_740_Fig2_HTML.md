caption: The regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by apoptotic effectors. (Left)
  Several intrinsic apoptotic effectors regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation through
  different signaling pathways. BAX and BAK, two important intrinsic apoptotic effectors,
  induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
  release and caspase-3/7-dependent K+ efflux in the context of severe fever with
  thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) infection, DNA damage, chemotherapy,
  or cellular stress. Cytochrome c, which is released from the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, impairs inflammasome activation by binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3
  and reduces the interactions between NLRP3 and NEK7. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein
  located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, restrains NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  by inhibiting Bax- and BAK-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis and VDAC activity
  upon Zika Virus infection or classical agonist stimulation. (Right) The extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway is triggered by various transmembrane receptors, many of which
  have been reported to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Cellular FADD-like
  IL-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is an antiapoptotic
  regulator that promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding to NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1
  in a caspase-8-independent manner. FADD promotes inflammasome activation by inducing
  the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, as well as caspase-8. Caspase-8, an important
  effector of apoptosis, regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through multiple
  pathways, directly cleaves IL-1β as well as the channel-forming glycoprotein pannexin-1
  to induce K+ efflux, and mediates the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β during
  priming. Other caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, -7, and -9 promote NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation by inducing cell death and K+ efflux
