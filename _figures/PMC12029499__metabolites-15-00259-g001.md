caption: 'Vitamin D synthesis and activation pathway. VDBP: vitamin D-binding protein;
  CYP2R1: 25-hydroxylase enzyme; CYP27B1: 1-α-hydroxylase enzyme; CYP24A1: 24-hydroxylase
  enzyme. After ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation with wavelengths of approximately 295–315
  nanometers (nm) in the skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to pre-vitamin D3
  followed by conversion to cholecalciferol by thermal isomerization. Diet can provide
  vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 in minor amounts. Cholecalciferol is transported
  to the liver bound to VDBP, where CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 enzymes are responsible for
  its first hydroxylation forming calcidiol, which afterwards is transported to the
  kidney for a second hydroxylation through CYP27B1 to form calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3),
  the active form of vitamin D. CYP24A1 is responsible for catabolism of vitamin D
  into 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3, respectively. Levels of calcitriol are determinants
  for the self-regulation by this mechanism'
