caption: Interplay between the Hippo, Wnt and ARF/p53 signaling pathways in development
  and tumorigenesis. The Hippo pathway scaffold RASSF1A is activated by ATM-mediated
  phosphorylation [,]. Although ATM inhibits ARF [], both RASSF1A and ARF prevent
  MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. RASSF1A activation results in the formation of stable
  YAP–p73 transcriptional complexes, which drive stem cell differentiation and apoptosis
  [,]. In the absence of RASSF1A, YAP–TEAD complexes drive cellular proliferation
  via transcription of genes, such as FOXM1. FOXM1 is inhibited by ARF []. ARF also
  suppresses Wnt signaling [,], which upon activation destabilizes the β-catenin destruction
  complex, resulting in β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-mediated transcription
  of oncogenes, such as TBX3. TBX3 inhibits ARF to promote oncogenic proliferation
  [].
