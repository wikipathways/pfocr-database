caption: The hypothesized mechanism of coronavirus-induced neuronal damage via oxidative
  stress and mitochondria dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs when TMPRSS2 primes
  the spike proteins for proteolysis, allowing the binding to ACE2. The affinity interaction
  triggers the binding of Ang II to the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), activating
  NADPH oxidase. This leads to mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) damage
  via the release of oxidative and nitrosative species, subsequently increasing the
  formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). The signaling pathways
  mediated by mtROS trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines, which can compromise
  the blood–brain barrier, thus resulting in neuronal damage. Additionally, mtROS
  cause nuclear and mitochondrial damage, which prolongs mitochondrial dysfunction
  and encourages inflammatory senescence (created with BioRender)
