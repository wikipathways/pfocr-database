caption: 'Mechanism of metal stress tolerance regulated by WRKY TFs in plants. When
  cadmium (Cd), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and arsenate (As) ions are transported
  into cells via membrane transporters, they induce the production of ROS, which further
  triggers the MAPK cascade signaling pathway, ultimately phosphorylating WRKY TFs
  and activating them. The WRKY TFs regulates various physiological processes through
  activating or repressing the expression of downstream genes by binding to their
  promoters, thereby conferring metal stress tolerance in plants. Abbreviations of
  membrane transporters are as follows: ZIP (zinc–regulated transporter), IRT (iron–regulated
  transporter), MP–ATPases (metal–pumping ATPases), PHT (phosphate transporter), HMA
  (heavy metal ATPase), MTP (metal tolerance protein), NRAMP (natural resistance associated
  macrophage protein)'
