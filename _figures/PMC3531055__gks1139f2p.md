caption: A schematic diagram of Apicomplexa illustrating the differences in the metabolic
  capabilities of T. gondii and P. falciparum. The metabolic capabilities present
  in T. gondii and absent in P. falciparum are shown in red, and the capabilities
  present in P. falciparum and absent in T. gondii are in blue. The pathways present
  in both are not shown. Although P. falciparum can synthesize thiamine de novo, it
  also salvages it from host. The pathways are shown in the organelles where they
  are predicted to occur in the Apicomplexa. If part of a pathway is predicted to
  occur in an organelle and another part in the cytosol, it is shown in midway between
  the organelle and cytosol. The complete comparison of metabolic capabilities of
  these species and other species in LAMP is available at http://www.llamp.net/?q=Apicomplexan%20comparison.
