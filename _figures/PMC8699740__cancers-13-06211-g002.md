caption: Complex immunological functions associated with CD103. TGFβ stimulates the
  SMAD pathway, transcriptionally upregulating CD103. At the same time, TGFβ also
  increases the affinity of CD103 for its ligand, E-cadherin, through phosphorylation
  of integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Enhanced binding affinity via conformational changes
  in CD103 is also achieved through activation of chemokine receptors (for example,
  by CCL3). TCR signaling also enhances CD103 expression via NFAT. Together, these
  elements of “inside out” signaling culminate in the facilitation of ligand binding.
  Binding of CD103 to E-cadherin, on the other hand, causes or enhances various effector
  functions in T cells as elements of “outside-in” signaling. These include, for example,
  activation of the paxillin signaling pathway with effects on cell migration, cytokine
  secretion, re-localization, and depletion of cytotoxic granules, and ultimately
  cytotoxicity and death of the target cell.
