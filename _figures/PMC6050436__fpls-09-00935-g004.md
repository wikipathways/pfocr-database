caption: 'Metabolites and enzymes (protein or transcript level) assigned to the citrate
  cycle (TCA cycle). Omics data are highlighted in red (metabolites), blue (proteins),
  yellow (transcripts), and green (both proteins and transcript). The enzymes (proteins
  and transcripts) are named by their EC number. EC numbers and respective detected
  TCA cycle enzymes: 2.3.3.1 (Citrate synthase), 4.2.1.3 (Aconitate hydratase), 1.1.1.42
  [Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+)], 1.2.4.2 (alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase),
  6.2.1.4 (Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase), 1.3.5.1 (Succinate dehydrogenase), 4.2.1.2
  (Fumarate hydratase), 1.1.1.37 (Malate dehydrogenase). There are two full reactions
  (metabolite, protein and transcript level) This figure was adapted from KEGG reference
  pathway.'
