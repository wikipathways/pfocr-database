caption: 'The entrance of erythrocytes into tissue regions with a high oxygen demand
  [decreased oxygen tension (PO2)] results in diffusion of oxygen to the tissue and
  a decrease in the oxygen saturation (SO2) of the hemoglobin within erythrocytes
  in the microcirculation. This decrease in SO2 stimulates the release of ATP from
  the erythrocyte via activation of a signaling pathway (see text) with the amount
  released proportional to the decrease in SO2. The erythrocyte-derived ATP can then
  interact with endothelial purinergic receptors resulting in the production of mediators
  that initiate vasodilation. This vasodilation is conducted in a retrograde fashion
  resulting in increased blood flow (oxygen supply) to areas of increased oxygen demand.Abbreviations:
  Gi = heterotrimeric G protein; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = 3’5’-adenosine
  monophosphate; PKA = protein kinase A; CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator; ? = an as yet unidentified conduit for ATP release; PR = purinergic receptors;
  + = stimulation, endo = endothelium; SMC = smooth muscle cell.'
