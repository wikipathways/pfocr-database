caption: CD4+ T cell expression of glucose metabolism genes. Relative gene expression
  of 82 genes encoding enzymes and isozymes in glucose metabolism pathways assessed
  by Fluidigm HD Biomark RT-PCR of RNA extracted from CD4+ T cells purified by magnetic
  bead negative selection. (A) Heatmaps depicting the relative expression of metabolic
  pathway gene sets as listed in . (B) CD4+ T cell glucose metabolism pathways highlighting
  enzymes encoded by genes with increased relative expression in HIV+ women with DM
  compared to controls. (C) Gene encoding enzymes with elevated relative expression
  in HIV+ women with DM compared to controls. Fold-change in gene expression calculated
  using 2−ΔΔCt with RPL30 as reference gene and HIV+DM− as reference samples. Genes
  with 95% C.I. >1 or 95% C.I. <1 were assessed for differences between groups. Fold
  change was compared between groups using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test
  for multiple comparison. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. HIV+DM+ women, n
  = 5; HIV+DMTx+ women, n = 10; HIV+DM− women, n = 6. Created with BioRender.com
