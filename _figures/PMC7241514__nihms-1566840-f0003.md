caption: 'Overlapping of the canonical pathways predicted to contribute to interaction
  of AUD and OUD. Interactions between predicted pathways were analysed based on overlap
  of the genes in the canonical pathways. Seven top pathways are highlighted: Gamma-aminobutyric
  Acid (GABA) Receptor Signaling, Neuroinflammation Signaling, Opioid Signaling, dopamine-DARPP32
  feedback in cAMP signaling, Circadian Rhythm Signalling, nNOS Signaling in Neurons
  and Glutamate Receptor Signalling. The P values of the 7 pathways are labelled beside
  the pathway.'
