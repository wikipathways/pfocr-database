caption: Alzheimer's disease. Schematic representation of amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic
  processing of APP. (A) Under physiologic conditions, APP is processed by both the
  α- and β-secretases, each event followed by cleavage by γ-secretase, and an equilibrium
  exists in which Aβ aggregates do not accumulate. (B) However, when there is excess
  PE, β- and γ-secretase activity is increased, which shifts the equilibrium toward
  the amyloidogenic pathway thus driving the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ. (C)
  In contrast, when PE is limiting (i.e., psd1Δ yeast), α-secretase activity is increased
  thus promoting the nonamyloidogenic pathway. How PE mechanistically alters the activity
  of the assorted secretases is presently unclear. The thickness of the arrows indicates
  the relative activity of a particular enzyme. APP-α is a cleavage product of α-secretase;
  APP-β is a cleavage product of β-secretase.
