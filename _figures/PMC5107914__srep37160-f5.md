caption: Glucocorticoids (inactive) cause activation of 11β-HSD1 in adipocytes producing
  active glucocorticoids. Active glucocorticoid-GR signaling complex activates the
  JNK pathway. JNK then inhibits insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation leading to insulin
  resistance. JNK may also be activated by inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor necrosis
  factor-α. [GCs = glucocorticoids, GR = glucocorticoid receptor, IR = insulin receptor,
  JNK = c-Jun N-terminal kinase; site of action of various inhibitors is also shown
  (green text)].
