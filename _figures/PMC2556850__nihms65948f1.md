caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (Left) In the absence of Wnt binding,
  β-catenin is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Axin and adenomous polyposis coli (APC).
  In this ‘destruction complex’, β-catenin is phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases
  casein kinase (CK) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin
  is recognized by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP), targeted for ubiquitination
  and degraded by the proteasome pathway. In the absence of β-catenin, TCF family
  transcription factors bind co-repressors of the groucho family. (Right) Wnt proteins
  bind to a receptor complex consisting of a frizzled receptor (Fz) and LRP5 or LRP6.
  Wnt signals are transduced to the destruction complex via as yet unknown pathway
  involving Dishevelled (DSH). DSH may directly interact with Fz and LRP may interact
  with Axin. Signaling inhibits GSK3β activity and β-catenin degradation. Accumulated
  β-catenin translocates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription in conjunction
  with TCF/LEF. γ-Catenin (plakoglobin), a structural homolog of β-catenin, also binds
  TCF/LEF transcription factors but is believed to provide a weaker transcriptional
  activation domain compared to β-catenin. This figure is adapted from the article
  by Weerkamp and colleagues [].
