caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. Activation of the HH-GLI signaling pathway occurs
  via the binding of HH ligands to the receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1), which unleashes
  the activity of the G-protein–coupled transmembrane receptor Smoothened (SMO). In
  this way, active state of SMO initiates a complex intracellular cascade leading
  to the activation of the three GLI transcription factors, the final effectors of
  the HH–GLI pathway. Hh, Hedgehog; SMO, smoothened
