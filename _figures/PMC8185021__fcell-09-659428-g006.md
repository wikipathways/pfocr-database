caption: C4ST-1 controls BT-549 cell proliferation by regulating the cleavage of SDC1
  by MMPs. SDC1 expressed at the cell surface is cleaved by MMPs, and the N-terminal
  and the C-terminal fragments of SDC1 are generated. Both fragments, SDC1(NTF) and
  SDC1(CTF), have a positive effect on cell proliferation, and cell proliferation
  is more affected by SDC1(CTF) than by SDC1(NTF). SDC1(CTF) is involved in SUMOylation
  of AKT1, although the mechanism underlying SUMOylation by SDC1(CTF) remains unclear.
  SUMOylation of AKT1 enhances proliferation through S6 kinase signaling pathway.
  In C4ST-1KO cells, the cleavage of SDC1 by MMPs is suppressed because of reduced
  expression of MMPs. SUMOylation of AKT1 is inhibited because of decreased SDC1(CTF),
  and proliferation is slowed down.
