caption: Illustration of Insulin Signaling and Resistance Pathways. This figure depicts
  the mechanism of insulin signaling, beginning with insulin binding to its receptor,
  leading to a cascade involving insulin receptor substrates (IRS), PI3K, and subsequent
  activation of various kinases. It also highlights the role of NOX in producing ROS
  that contribute to insulin resistance, particularly in the context of obesity-induced
  chronic inflammation. The figure further illustrates how NOX-derived ROS and lipid
  metabolites like diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide disrupt insulin signaling by
  altering IRS phosphorylation and Akt activity. Additionally, it shows the influence
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin resistance
  in various tissues, emphasizing the complex interplay between metabolic processes
  and signaling pathways in insulin resistance. P represents a phosphate group. Cartoon
