caption: Exosomes secreted by MM, NSCLC and PCa tumors carry different and abundant
  contents, which serve a key role in osteoclasts or osteoblasts, resulting in different
  metastatic lesions. AREG in MM-derived exosomes leads to the activation of EGFR
  in pre-osteoclasts, participating in MM-induced osteoclastogenesis. NSCLC-derived
  exosomes containing AREG induce EGFR pathway activation in pre-osteoclasts. PCa-derived
  exosomes contain Ets1, hsa-miR-940 and miR-141-3p, which ultimately lead to extensive
  osteoblastic lesions. AREG, amphiregulin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  miR, microRNA; MM, multiple myeloma; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PCa, prostate
  cancer.
