caption: 'Schematic representation of the diverse roles of lysine acetylation in the
  activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. Lysine acetylations of the transcription
  factors as well as their co-activators play an important part in the duration of
  the response and the signaling output. Lysine acetylation status of the histones
  works in concert with acetylation status of the transcription factors to enable
  or disable transcription of specific genes. Crosstalk of acetylation with other
  PTMs is an important component in the NF-κB pathway. Abbreviations: HATs, histone
  acetyltransferases; HDACs, histone deacetylases.'
