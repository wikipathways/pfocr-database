caption: Figure 2. Targets of the axon guidance pathway likely altered in dyspraxia.
  The comparison of  with  denotes the possible importance of semaphorin signaling
  in the pathology of dyspraxia, while ephrin and netrin signaling are present too.
  As can be seen, the pathways lead to a favoring of axon repulsion through the PAK
  kinases and to axon attraction through RAC1; therefore, possible loss of balance
  between axon repulsion and axon attraction could be the result of deregulated expression
  of the semaphorin signaling.
