caption: 'Working model of fibroblast mediated PI3K pathway hyperactivation and response
  to double PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in PTEN-competent CRC cell lines. (A) In serum-free
  condition of growth, PTEN is associated to plasma membrane and co-localizes with
  mTOR, acting as a negative regulator of PI3K signaling at different levels. (B)
  Despite PI3K inhibition, Geda (G) causes PTEN C-terminal tail phosphorylation and
  cytoplasmic redistribution, accompanied by loss of co-localization with mTOR at
  the plasma membrane, presumably by interrupting a negative feedback loop; the net
  result of double PI3K/mTOR inhibition, in this context, is paradoxical pathway (re)activation,
  whereby Geda induces its own resistance mechanism(s). (C) Upon fibroblast-CM exposure,
  two main molecular events concurrently occur with the PTEN C-terminal tail phosphorylation
  and redistribution within the cells: I) PTEN loses its negative control on PIP3
  phosphorylation; II) PTEN no longer co-localizes with mTOR at the plasma membrane,
  thus rendering mTOR more available to form functionally active complexes and causing
  mTORC1 and downstream pathway hyperactivation. (D) Under conditions in which fibroblast-CM
  drives PTEN-dependent PI3K/mTOR paradoxical activation, double PI3K/mTOR inhibition
  strongly switches off signaling through the PI3K cascade, thereby restoring Geda-mediated
  growth inhibition.'
