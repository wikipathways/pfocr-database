caption: Mechanism of action of androgen receptor blockers (Apalutamide, Darolutamide,
  and Enzalutamide) in treating CRPC. Enzalutamide, Apalutamide, and Darolutamide
  are androgen receptor (AR) antagonists that effectively inhibit the androgen signaling
  pathway, crucial for the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
  Enzalutamide binds to the AR, preventing testosterone from attaching to the receptor.
  This inhibition blocks the translocation of the AR into the cell nucleus, thereby
  preventing the activation of AR target genes that promote cancer cell growth. In
  addition to direct AR antagonism, Abiraterone acetate targets androgen synthesis.
  It inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase, which are essential for
  androgen production, by blocking their activity on the CYP-17. This action significantly
  reduces the levels of testosterone and other androgens, preventing their binding
  to the AR. Apalutamide and Darolutamide function similarly to Enzalutamide by binding
  to the AR and preventing its activation by testosterone. This inhibition blocks
  AR-mediated transcriptional activity, thereby hindering the growth of CRPC cells.
  By disrupting the androgen signaling pathway through these different mechanisms,
  these treatments aim to reduce AR activity and slow the progression of CRPC
