caption: 'Model for the role of Pde1 and Pde2 in the cAMP signaling cascade. Virulence
  factor production is regulated by the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway via the following
  components: an unidentified seven-transmembrane receptor(s); the Gα subunit (Gpa1);
  adenylyl cyclase (Cac1) and its associated protein, Aca1; PKA, composed of the Pkr1
  regulatory subunit and the Pka1 and Pka2 catalytic subunits; and the PDEase Pde1.
  In serotype A, the Pka1 catalytic subunit plays a major role in regulating virulence
  factor production, while the Pka2 subunit plays only a minor role. Intracellular
  cAMP levels are modulated through a feedback loop controlled by Pka1. When active,
  Pka1 positively regulates Pde1 and may also negatively regulate Cac1, exerting control
  over both the production (Cac1) and degradation (Pde1) of cAMP. Although Pde2 has
  no apparent role in the regulation of intracellular cAMP levels, it is possible
  that Pde2 may be regulated by Pka2. Solid lines and arrows indicate experimentally
  proven portions of the pathway, and dashed lines and arrows indicate putative portions
  of the pathway for which there is, as yet, no experimental evidence. Gray arrows
  and lines indicate minor roles in the pathway.'
