caption: A proposed mode of action of circ-MYO10 regarding the regulation of the WNT/β-catenin
  pathway in osteosarcoma. circ-MYO10 sponges miR-370-3p, and, therefore, the levels
  of the latter are not sufficient for reducing the expression of RUVBL1. Then, RUVBL1
  is transferred to the nucleus, where it interacts with β-catenin and KAT5 and forms
  a complex that is recruited to the promoter region of MYC. This interaction leads
  to increased acetylation of H4K16 and expression of WNT-targeted genes, including
  MYC. Consequently, enhanced osteosarcoma cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), and metastasis are attained. The red “reverse tau” symbol (⊥)
  indicates attenuation of expression, while the parallel black lines (//) indicate
  the inhibition of an effect. Vertical green and red arrows indicate increased or
  decreased expression levels, respectively. Vertical yellow arrows denote the increased
  rate of an event, and blue arrows indicate the sequence of events.
