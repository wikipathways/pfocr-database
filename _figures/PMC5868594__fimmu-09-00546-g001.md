caption: Structure of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and its activation mechanisms.
  (A) Homodimerization and heterodimerization of NF-κB1. Homodimer p50 lacks transcriptional
  activation domains and is unable to bind to DNA. Heterodimers are repressed by IκB.
  (B) Homodimerization and heterodimerization of NF-κB2. Homodimer p52 lacks transcriptional
  activation domains and is unable to bind to DNA. Heterodimers are repressed by IκB.
  (C) Classical pathway of NF-κB activation. This pathway is mediated by IκB kinase
  complex (IKK), leading to phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. (D) Alternative
  pathway of NF-κB activation. This pathway involves IKKα activation via NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK) and induces the phosphorylation of p100, leading to the generation
  and translocation of p52.
