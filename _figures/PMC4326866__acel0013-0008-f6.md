caption: Model for role of the Wnt signaling pathways in age-regulation. The activity
  of the Wnt signaling pathway increases as worms age, leading to increased expression
  of elt-5 GATA transcription factor. This GATA transcription factor represses the
  expression of elt-3 in old worms. Changes in the elt-3 GATA transcription factor
  activate a cascade of downstream effects, which causes aging. The elt-3/elt-5 GATA
  transcriptional circuit could be one of a number of genetic programs that are under
  control of the Wnt signaling pathway during aging. In addition to developmental
  programs for aging, Wnt signaling might regulate genes responsible for cellular
  stress response, but not for oxidative damage.
