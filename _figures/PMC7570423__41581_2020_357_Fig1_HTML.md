caption: 'a | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a typical
  betacoronavirus belonging the Orthocoronavirinae family. Each SARS-CoV-2 virion
  has a diameter of approximately 100–200 nm. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2
  envelope comprises a lipid membrane and three structural components: the spike (S)
  glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein. Within the
  viral envelope, the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the positive-sense single-stranded
  RNA, which is 29,903 bases in length. b | The SARS-CoV-2 genome is composed of ten
  open reading frames (ORFs). At least two-thirds of the viral genome are contained
  in ORF1a and ORF1b, which together encode a polyprotein, pp1ab, which is further
  cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in genome transcription
  and replication. Of these proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease
  (3CLpro) are encoded by ORF1a, whereas RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase
  (Hel) and exonuclease (ExoN) are encoded by ORF1b. The remaining ORFs encode the
  structural S glycoproteins, and the E protein, M protein and N protein, as well
  as several accessory proteins with unknown functions. c | SARS-CoV-2 enters the
  host cell using the endosomal pathway and the cell surface non-endosomal pathway.
  In the setting of endosomal entry, the SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to its target
  cells by direct binding of the S glycoprotein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). Upon binding, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves
  and primes S glycoprotein, leading to the fusion of the viral and cell membranes.
  In addition to canonical viral entry via the endosomal pathway, non-endosomal entry
  at the plasma membrane may be an additional infection route for SARS-CoV-2. Within
  the target cells, SARS-CoV-2 is disassembled to release nucleocapsid and viral RNA
  into the cytoplasm for translation and replication. Translated viral proteins are
  then assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form the new virions, which
  are then released from the Golgi membrane system by exocytosis into the extracellular
  compartment.'
