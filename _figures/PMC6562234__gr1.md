caption: The cancer-selective strategy to target the NF-κB signalling pathway. Schematic
  representation of the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. Depicted in black are
  the main conventional therapeutic strategies, which have thus far been used to generate
  pharmacological NF-κB inhibitors. Also depicted in red is one of the emerging approaches
  aimed at developing a therapeutic inhibitor of a functionally critical and cancer
  cell-restricted downstream effector of the pathogenic survival axis of the NF-κB
  pathway. Also shown is the D-tripeptide inhibitor of the GADD45β/MKK7 complex, DTP3,
  which selectively targets this GADD45β-dependent survival axis of the NF-κB pathway,
  yielding cancer cell-selective therapeutic activity, thereby circumventing the preclusive
  limitations of global IKKβ/NF-κB inhibitors.
