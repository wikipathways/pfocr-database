caption: The design and function of PBMLR. (A) Construction of the porphyrinic metal-organic
  framework nanoparticle PBMLR through drug loading and lipid bilayer coating. (B)
  Metabolic pre-intervention model of PBMLR in tumor cells. After uptake of PBMLR
  nanoparticles via cRGD recognition sites, two inhibitor molecules release and play
  a synergistic role in metabolic intervention. Met inhibits aerobic metabolism, leading
  to the accumulation of oxygen. Meanwhile, BSO inhibits GSH biosynthesis, leading
  to a weakened detoxification pathway to prevent the loss of exogenous ROS. These
  modulations adjust the balance of intracellular redox homeostasis and will eventually
  induce cell death by enhancing the effect of PDT.
