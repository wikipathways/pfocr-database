caption: 'The regulatory mechanism of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. RAF and MEK
  exist as heterodimers in cytosol of quiescent cells (A). Upon Ras activation, these
  heterodimers are recruited to the plasma membrane where they form transient tetramers
  through side-to-side dimerization of RAF. Further, this side-to-side RAF dimerization
  activates RAF themselves and also loosens RAF/MEK heterodimers, which facilitate
  the MEK dimerization on the surface of RAF dimer. Subsequently, active RAF dimer
  phosphorylates MEK dimer docking on its surface or promotes intra-dimer MEK transphosphorylation.
  Thereafter, active MEK dimer docking on RAF dimer or released from RAF dimer phosphorylates
  and activates ERK. Since, unlike BRAF, CRAF and ARAF do not heterodimerize with
  MEK in inactive state, how MEK is delivered to CRAF and ARAF for activation remains
  unknown in current studies (B). EGF: Epidermal growth factor; RBD: RAS binding domain.'
