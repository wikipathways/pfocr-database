caption: Chemical structures of potential autophagy-related drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  The drugs were divided in three groups according to their effects on the autophagy
  signaling pathway and possible effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lysosomotropic
  agents (1) can prevent coronavirus infection by alkalinizing the acid pH in the
  endolysosomal system; some examples are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,
  artemisinin, two-pore channel antagonists (such as tetrandrine and ned-19) and imatinib.
  The protease inhibitors/antiviral agents (2) can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage
  of the spike coronavirus protein, which is necessary for viral entry into host cells;
  some examples are camostat mesylate, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir and teicoplanin.
  The third group is composed by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways modulators (3),
  which can modulate intracellular pathways related to autophagy and coronavirus infection;
  some examples are the rapamycin, wortmannin, the anticoagulant heparin, the glucocorticoid
  dexamethasone, losartan and cannabidiol. The figures for each chemical structure
  are from according to Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain).
