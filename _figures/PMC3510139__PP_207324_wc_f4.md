caption: Selection of three major metabolic pathways induced in Arabidopsis plants
  by . A,  signaling pathway. B, Network involved in the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates
  and camalexin. C, Network involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates.
  Colored squares (leaves) and triangles (roots) represent statistically significant
  transcriptional changes induced in Arabidopsis by  at 10, 14, or 18 . Red = up-regulated;
  green = down-regulated; yellow = statistically significant transcriptional changes
  with fold changes less than 2.0; white = no statistically significant difference.
  Detailed information for each gene can be found in .
