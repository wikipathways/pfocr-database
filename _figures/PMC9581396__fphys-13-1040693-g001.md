caption: Schematic diagram of muscle-bone crosstalk in COPD. FNDC5/irisin is decreased,
  whereas IL-6, myostatin (MSTN) and RANKL/RANK are increased in skeletal muscles
  in COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE), via enhanced p-ERK1/2, increases expression
  of MSTN, which further inhibits FNDC5/irisin expression through p-Smad3/PGC-1α pathway.
  MSTN also promotes osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast differentiation by NFATc1.
  Irisin upregulates sclerostin through integrin αV/β5 in the osteocytes, thereby
  inducing bone remodeling. RANKL activates the homologous receptor RANK on the surface
  of osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors, and activated RANK causes the recruitment
  of the adapter protein TRAF6, leading to NF-kB activation, thereby triggering the
  transcription of osteoclastogenic genes and bone resorption. Moreover, RANKL signaling
  can also lead to muscle dysfunction by upregulation of MSTN and activation of the
  ubiquitin-proteasome system (MuRF1 and Atrogin1) and the NF-κb pathway. OPG, the
  decoy receptor of RANKL, prevents osteoclast formation and bone loss. During exercise,
  muscle-derived IL-6 (mIL-6) acts on the IL-6 receptor of osteoblasts and increases
  the production of RANKL through STAT3 signaling pathway, subsequently promoting
  osteoclast differentiation and production of bioactive osteocalcin in osteoclasts.
  In turn, osteocalcin also enhances the production of mIL-6 during exercise, and
  promotes myoblast differentiation and proliferation.
