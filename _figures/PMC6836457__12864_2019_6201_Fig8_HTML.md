caption: 'A miRNA-Regulated mRNA Model in Sugarcane Internode Elongation. Novel-m0140-5p
  was predicted to regulate CKX5 in “zeatin biosynthesis”. In “nitrogen metabolism”
  pathway, miR2592-y was predicted to regulate GDH1 isoform X2 and TPA: GDH1; novel-m0204-5p
  was predicted to target CLSF, chloroplastic precursor. miR1520-x, miR390-x, miR5658-x,
  miR6169-x, and miR8154-x were predicted to target IAA4-like, SAUR32, IAA10 isoform
  X2 and IAA13, respectively in “plant hormone signal transduction” pathway. These
  miRNAs targeted genes from “zeatin biosynthesis”, “nitrogen metabolism” and “plant
  hormone signal transduction” pathways participate in sugarcane internode elongation'
