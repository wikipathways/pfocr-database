caption: Scheme illustrating the effects of S protein on brain pericytes in absence
  of productive viral infection. Exposure of ACE2+ human brain vascular pericytes
  to SARS-CoV-2 S protein active trimer induces NF-κB signaling pathway and modulates
  intracellular Ca2+ activity. The intracellular signaling changes in brain pericytes
  upon S protein exposure are accompanied by an increased expression of contractile
  and myofibrogenic markers as well as secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  S protein effects are potentiated under hypoxic conditions, which are associated
  to vascular comorbidities that have been demonstrated to exacerbate COVID-19 pathogenesis.
  We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 could impair neurovascular functions by deregulating
  the functions of ACE2+ pericytes via S protein active trimer.
