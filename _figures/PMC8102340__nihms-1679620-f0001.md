caption: 'A total of 142,390 polymorphic variants in 5,293 samples (2,327 CRC cases
  and 2,966 controls) were analyzed. The associations between common and rare variants
  and the risk of CRC were estimated through the likelihood ratio tests. A meta-analysis
  of the study-specific test statistics revealed strong associations between CRC and
  rs139401613 in ST6GALNAC2 (meta P=1.01×10−6), rs35467001 (meta P=7.72×10−6; 3.9%)
  and rs34322745 (meta P=5.16×10−5) in SDK2. Only rare variants (MAF<1%) were retained
  for gene- and pathway-level analyses. A summary Bayes Factor (BF) was computed as
  the product of the three study-specific BFs from the Bayesian Risk Index (BRI) method.
  The top associated gene was ST6GALNAC2 (summary BFBRI=2604.23) followed by OSTM1,
  COL22A1, EPHA7, TTC28, SPTBN5, FSIP1, AKR1D1, NOTCH3, C6orf120, OR11H4, NAT1, EVI2B,
  CENPQ, SMPDL3A, CEP43 and GPC3 with summary BFBRI ranging from 104.43 to 948.28.
  The integrative Bayesian Risk Index (iBRI) method was used to perform pathway level
  analysis for DNA repair, TGF-β signaling, vitamin D and folate metabolism. Given
  evidence of strong association with the DNA repair pathway (summary BFBRI=17852.4),
  we further investigated the likely subpathways, genes and variants that are driving
  the association. At the subpathway level, extreme associations were found for NHEJ
  (summary BFiBRI=437.85) and NER (summary BFiBRI=36.96). The top associated gene
  was RPA2 (summary BFiBRI=164.28), and the most likely associated variant in this
  gene was rs28988897 (summary BFiBRI=657.56). Strong associations were also reported
  for PRKDC (summary BFiBRI=109.77) [rs8178232 (summary BFiBRI=17.68)], ERCC5 (summary
  BFiBRI=65.52) [rs141369732 (summary BFiBRI=6.39)] and ERCC8 (summary BFiBRI=21.9)
