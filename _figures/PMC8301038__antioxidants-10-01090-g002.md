caption: 'Redox signaling and lipolysis. ROS and RNS alter lipolytic pathways at different
  points. (1) Growth hormone receptor: ROS, especially H2O2, production increases
  upon growth hormone (GH) binding to the growth hormone receptor, consequently activating
  β-adrenergic receptor (βAR), adenylyl cyclase (AC), and protein kinases downstream,
  increasing lipolysis. (2) β-adrenergic receptor: Adrenalin (Adr) binds to βAR and
  increases the production of ROS. O2•− and H2O2 also oxidize βAR, increasing adipocyte
  sensitivity to lipolysis. On the other hand, NO• suppresses βAR activation. (3)
  Natriuretic peptide receptor: O2•− and H2O2 produced upon activation of NPRA enhance
  the activation of βAR, AC, and cAMP synthesis, increasing lipolysis. (4) Nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase: NOX converts O2 to O2•− and H2O2. Moreover,
  insulin, through the production H2O2 by NOX4, inhibits PKA activation, reducing
  adrenergic stimulated lipolysis. (5) Protein kinase C (PKC): at high concentration,
  O2•− and H2O2 activate PKC through the release of diacylglycerol (DAG) or may inactivate
  it by impairing its substrate-binding affinity. At low concentrations, ROS activate
  PKC by oxidizing its structural cysteine residues. H2O2 activates PKC by increasing
  Ca2+ concentrations. (6) Protein kinase A (PKA): at high concentration, ROS inhibit
  cAMP-dependent PKA, but at low concentration, ROS prolong the activation of PKA
  by inhibiting the phosphatase that suppresses it. (7) Protein kinase G (PKG): it
  is currently unknown how ROS affect PKG activity in adipocytes. Black arrows represent
  the classic lipolytic pathway, blue arrows represent the production of ROS/RNS,
  and red arrows represent the effect (activation or inhibition) of ROS/RNS.'
