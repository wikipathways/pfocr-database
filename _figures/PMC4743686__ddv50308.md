caption: A proposed role of Coa6 in the mitochondrial copper delivery pathway to Cox2.
  Coa6 associates with Cox2, Cox12 and Sco proteins to form a copper delivery complex
  for CuA center biogenesis. Previously, it has been shown that Cox17 transfers copper
  to Sco proteins, but the mechanism by which Cox17 receives copper from a ligand
  bound (-L) copper pool is not known. Although Cmc1, Cox19 and Cox23 are implicated
  in the copper delivery pathway, we did not detect Coa6 interaction with any of these
  proteins. OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane;
  IMS, intermembrane space.
