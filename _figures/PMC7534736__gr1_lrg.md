caption: In blood vessels characterized by high shear stress and laminar flow, ECs
  utilise a glycolytic metabolism that not only provides energy (ATP), but fuels collateral
  pathway as the HBP and PPP, required for efficient protein glycosylation, glycocalix
  maintenance, and antioxidant activities. In addition, conversion of pyruvate to
  lactate, which occur under low oxygen conditions, is a stimulus for EC sprouting
  for new vessel formation, while acetylCoA derived both from pyruvate or exogenous
  fatty acids oxidation is not only consumed in TCA cycle but partecipates to epigenetic
  remodeling and nucleotide synthesis. Physiologically also eNOS regulates vascular
  tone by converting L-arginine to NO. However, when blood flow is disturbed, glycolytic
  flux is reduced and endothelial barrier integrity is compromised, thus resulting
  in increased lipid deposition. These events contribute to EC dysfunction and lead
  to increased inflammation, oxidative stress and reduced NO production.
