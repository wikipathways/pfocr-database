caption: 'Metabolic map of the pathways responsible for surfactin biosynthesis. The
  metabolic network was constructed based on KEGG pathway analysis. Five modules were
  partitioned according to their functions. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, represent
  different metabolic modules: 1, glycolysis metabolism module; 2, branched‐chain
  amino acid metabolism module; 3, tricarboxylic acid cycle module; 4, branched‐chain
  fatty acid biosynthesis module; and 5, modular enzymatic synthesis of surfactin
  module. Transcriptional levels of the relevant genes in BS‐37 are show next to the
  pathway as a heat map, based on the ranking of expression intensity (RPKM) in the
  whole genome. The color of each square represents the strength of gene transcription.
  The transcription level (RPKM) of glpD is defined as 100%, corresponding to pure
  red. The expression intensity of other genes was calculated as the ratio of their
  respective transcription levels (RPKM) to that of glpD. The culture condition is
  MMG medium without d/l‐leu. The expression is the ratio of the gene to glpD. In
  the paper, these have been defined'
