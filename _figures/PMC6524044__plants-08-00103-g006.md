caption: Schematic model of signaling pathway controlling lateral root development
  under S-deficient conditions. S availability affects the activity of the signaling
  module composed of CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptides and
  CLAVATA1 (CLV1) leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase in roots. The model proposes
  three potential pathways involved in regulation of LR development under S-deficient
  conditions. Regulatory components expressed downstream of CLV1 become active under
  S deficiency and inhibit LR development (a). CLE2 and CLE3 can be repressed under
  S deficiency directly or partially through the CLV1-mediated feedback mechanism
  (at least for CLE3) to reduce the input of CLE signals (b,c).
