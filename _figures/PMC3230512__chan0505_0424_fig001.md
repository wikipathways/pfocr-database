caption: Model showing the various molecular components associated with the store-operated
  calcium entry pathway. The figure depicts the Ca2+signaling microdomain related
  to the activation, regulation and modulation of SOCE and the resultant changes in
  [Ca2+] in the cytosol. Both local and global changes can result as a result of activation
  of SOCE and these can lead to long-term as well as acute effects on cell function.
  Major regulatory pathways are shown by black dashed lines while Ca2+ fluxes are
  indicated by red arrows. Large light red arrows indicate TRPC1 trafficking of TRPC1-vesicles
  and status of Cav-1-TRPC1 interaction in “inactive” and active TRPC1-SOC channel.
  Further details of each component are discussed in the text.
