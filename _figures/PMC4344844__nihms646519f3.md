caption: In the absence of Wnt ligands (Wnt OFF), cytosolic β-catenin that does not
  participate in adherens junction (AJ) stabilization is captured by the destruction
  complex, where it is first phosphorylated, and then ubiquitinated by recruiting
  β-TrCP followed by its proteasome-mediated degradation. According to the latest
  model, binding of Wnt ligands to their Lrp5/6-Frizzled receptor (Wnt ON) recruits
  the intact destruction complex to the activated receptor where it is still able
  to capture and phosphorylate β-catenin. Binding of Axin to activated LRP dislodges
  the Hippo co-transcriptonal effectors YAP/TAZ from the destruction complex, rendering
  β-catenin invisible to β-TrCP. As a result, β-catenin can no longer be ubiquitinated
  and newly synthesized β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to
  the nucleus where it replaces the repressor Groucho and binds to LEF/TCF trancription
  factors to induce Wnt target genes. Note that once dislodged from the destruction
  complex, YAP/TAZ can translocate to the nucleus as well where they interact with
  TEAD transcription factors to initiate gene expression. YAP/TAZ/TEAD-mediated gene
  expression is therefore an integral part of the Wnt response. DKK proteins inhibit
  Wnt signaling by preventing the interaction of Wnt ligands with LRP5/6.
