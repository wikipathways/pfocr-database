caption: Increasing ERβ protein expression and nuclear translocation could be important
  for activation of the ERβ pathway. In addition, ERβ could stimulate Egr-1 transcription
  via the MEK1/Erk/Elk-1 cascade in glioma cells. Furthermore, ERβ agonist could enhance
  temozolomide sensitivity of glioma cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
  Ligand binding with ERβ could induce conformational changes that facilitate receptor
  dimerization to homodimers (ERβ/ERβ), translocation of dimers to the nucleus, and
  binding with co-regulatory proteins (CRP). This supra-molecular assembly thus may
  interact with the estrogen response element (ERE) in the promoter region of target
  genes. Furthermore, ERβ could also bind to the promoter region of PTEN through Sp1
  and increase PTEN transcription. The presence of various ERβ isoforms could add
  further complexity to the action of ERβ, which should be considered in clarifying
  the effects of ERβ in human glioma. However, it remains unclear which isoforms primarily
  exert anticancer effects in human glioma, and the distinct function of each ERβ
  isoform is unknown. More efforts should be directed toward clarifying the activation
  and agonist-induced dynamics of ERβ/ERβ homodimers and the distinct function of
  each ERβ isoform to design more potent ligands that selectively activate ERβ.
