caption: A model that proposes DNA concentration could determine type of DNA sensor
  and level of innate immune responses required to maintain homeostasis. During low
  concentration of DNA in the cytosol, cGAS–STING could be activated to drive IFN-mediated
  immune responses. Whereas, when high concentrations of DNA accumulate in the cytosol,
  the AIM2 inflammasome could be activated to intensify the innate immune responses
  by IL-1β release, and pyroptosis mediated by active caspase-1 and gasdermin cleavage.
  Therefore, IFN release from cGAS–STING activation primes AIM2 inflammasome components
  as marked by increased expression of AIM2, procaspase-1/11/4/5. Conversely, to prevent
  hyperactivation of the immune responses, K+ efflux mediated by gasdermin-d cleavage
  inhibits cGAS, and active caspase-1/11/4/5 can cleave cGAS directly. Red arrows
  indicate negative regulation, and green arrows indicate positive regulation.
