caption: 'The nutritional sensing O-GlcNAcylation. UDP-GlcNAc, OGT''s nucleotide sugar
  donor, is provided by the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) at the crossroad
  of glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and nucleotides metabolisms. UDP-GlcNAc levels
  are thus tightly correlated to the nutritional status of the organism. O-GlcNAcylation
  levels are regulated by a unique couple of enzymes: OGT that catalyzes the transfer
  of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc onto the target protein and OGA that hydrolyzes the residue.
