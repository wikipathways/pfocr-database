caption: Epigenetic modulators unleash EREs expression culminating in IFN-I/III secretion
  through activation of MDA5. Treatment with DNA hypomethylating agents (DHA) and
  histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) lead to chromatin modifications and unleashing
  of endogenous retroviral elements (EREs) in tumor cells. The intermediates formed
  by these elements during their replication sensitize RIG-like receptors in the cytosol,
  such as MDA-5 and RIG-I, which activate IRF7/9 and the production of IFN-I/III.
  ERE-derived RNAs might also be translated in tumor cells generating tumor-associated
  antigens that may be recognized by CD8+ T cells. In this manner, DHA and HDACi increase
  tumor immunogenicity and might be explored as adjuvants for ICB therapies. Created
