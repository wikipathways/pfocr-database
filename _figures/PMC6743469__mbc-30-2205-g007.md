caption: Model for how the RAM (regulation of Ace2 and morphogenesis) and the CWI
  (cell wall integrity) pathways regulate the transition between growth and quiescence.
  In response to glucose limitation, Lre1 inhibits the conserved NDR/LATS kinase Cbk1
  in the RAM pathway (left) and prevents it from phosphorylating and inhibiting Ssd1.
  This enables Ssd1 to sequester and inhibit cell wall (CW) mRNAs in P bodies (depicted
  by circles) and prevent budding and cell wall expansion. Ssd1 and Mpt5 may play
  overlapping roles in this process. Mpt5 may also be a Cbk1 target. In addition to
  CW mRNAs, Ssd1 also binds and represses Lre1 mRNA. This negative feedback releases
  Cbk1 to activate Rlm1. The CWI pathway (right) is activated by stress, nutrient
  limitation, and cell wall damage. This involves Mpt5-mediated destabilization of
  the LRG1 mRNA. Lrg1 is a Rho1 GTPase activating protein (GAP) that must be neutralized
  for full CWI pathway activation. The downstream Slt2 kinase and Cbk1 are both required
  to activate the Rlm1 transcription factor. Rlm1 activation initiates the transcriptional
  program that protects cells from stress and promotes the entry, maintenance, and
  recovery from quiescence.
