caption: Schematic diagrams of the pathway models involved in the early and late phases
  of ERK and AKT activation by orbital shaking. Arrows indicate some of the known
  pathways associated with ERK and AKT activation by FSS. Thick arrows indicate the
  pathways that are likely involved in the activation of ERK and AKT by orbital shaking
  in this report. Dotted arrows indicate the pathways that are unlikely to contribute
  to the ERK and AKT activation by orbital shaking.
