caption: Overview of the pivotal signaling cascades in peripheral nerve regeneration
  (PNR). The intracellular regulation of Schwann cells (SCs) is facilitated by the
  JNK/c-Jun, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and RAS/ERK signaling pathways with main activators being
  growth factors BDNF, NGF, and NT3. As for nerve cells, intracellular regulation
  is facilitated by the RhoA/ROCK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and RAS/ERK signaling pathways with
  main activators being growth factors NGF, GDNF, and BDNF. These intracellular pathways
  regulate axonal outgrowth, SCs reprogramming, nerve myelination and survival. For
  a more detailed schematic, please refer to Li et al. (2020). NGF, nerve growth factor;
  BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
  factor; NT3, neurotrophin-3; Trk, tropomyosin receptor kinase A; p75 NTR, p75 neurotrophin
  receptor; FRS-2, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor substrate 2; GRB-2, growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2; SOS, son of sevenless; Gab1, GRB2-associated binding
  protein 1; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MEKK4/7, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase 4/7; MKK4/7, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  4/7; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase;
  c-Jun, Jun proto-oncogene; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ROCK, Rho-associated protein
  kinase; LIMK, LIM domain-containing kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; RhoA, Ras homolog family member A; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; AKT, Protein kinase B; RAS, rat sarcoma; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma
