caption: Retinoid metabolic pathway. All-trans-retinol (the alcohol form of vitamin
  A) can be converted to retinyl esters for storage through the action lecithin-retinol
  acyltransferase (LRAT) and cellular retinol-binding protein-1 (CRBP1). Alternatively,
  all-trans-retinol can be oxidized to all-trans-retinaldehyde by either alcohol dehydrogenase
  (ADH) or retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) using NAD as cofactor. All-trans-retinaldehyde
  can also be generated by cleavage of beta-carotene (provitamin A) by carotenoid-15,15′-oxygenase
  (CMO1). All-trans-retinaldehyde can be reduced to all-trans-retinol through the
  action of RDHs that preferentially use NADPH as cofactor or by aldo-keto reductases
  (AKR). All-trans-retinaldehyde can be further oxidized to all-trans-retinoic acid
  (RA) by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3) which are members
  of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (i.e. ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3, respectively).
  RA can be further oxidized to 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid by cytochrome P450s (CYP26A1,
  CYP26B1, and CYP26C1) which is considered the first step of RA degradation as it
  leads to more easily excreted metabolites. RA can initiate a signaling event through
  binding to nuclear RA receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) that regulate transcription
  of target genes.
