caption: Modulation of PI3K/Akt pathway mediated by EGCG. Akt/protein kinase B (PKB)
  is activated by Phosphatidyl Inositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) (1), which catalyses the conversion
  of phosphatidyl inositol (4,5) biphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)
  triphosphate (PIP3), a process that is reversed by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate
  3-phosphatase (PTEM) (2). PIP3 also recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
  (PDK1) to the plasma membrane, activating Akt (3). Akt phosphorylates glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3), inhibiting its function (4). Active GSK3 is able to phosphorylate
  Mcl-1 (5), which is targeted for proteasomal degradation (6), liberating Bax and
  Bak proapoptotic factors (7). This causes the permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  outer membrane, releasing cytochrome c (Cyt C) (8) that attaches to Apaf-1, generating
  the apoptosome (9), leading to the activation of caspase 3 (10) that induces apoptosis
  (11). GSK3 also phosphorylates tau, inducing its aggregation and subsequent neurodegeneration
  (12). EGCG can ultimately increase PI3K and Akt activity (13) and inhibit PTEM in
  the presence of ROS (14), inhibiting apoptosis (15), phospho-Tau aggregation (16)
  and, therefore, generating neuroprotection.
