caption: MiR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p might affect MAPK signaling pathway by regulating
  DUSP5 and MAP3K11. a KEGG pathway network for miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p. Genes
  that enrich for selected terms are displayed as small nodes connecting to the larger
  pathway nodes. Both of DUSP5 and MAP3K11 were related to MAPK signaling pathway.
  b Based on KEGG pathway analysis, miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p had an effect on EMT
  process through MAPK by targeting DUSP5 or MAP3K11
papertitle: MiR-199a-3p/5p participated in TGF-Î² and EGF induced EMT by targeting
  DUSP5/MAP3K11 in pterygium.
