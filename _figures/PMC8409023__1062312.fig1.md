caption: 'Overview of targets within the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell, and mechanisms
  of tumor microenvironment modulation by targeted agents. (A) The chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia (CLL) cell including targets within the B-cell receptor pathway and anti-apoptotic
  pathway. Downstream of the B-cell receptor, BTK is inhibited by ibrutinib, acalabrutinib,
  and zanubrutinib, and PI3Kδ is inhibited by idelalisib, duvelisib, and umbralisib.
  The anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 is inhibited by venetoclax. (B) Direct versus indirect
  effects of targeted agents, and activation of tumor microenvironment (TME) anti-CLL
  activity by novel treatment modalities. Inhibition (both on- and off-target) of
  targets within the specific TME cells are here referred to as direct effects, exemplified
  by off-target inhibition of ITK in T cells by ibrutinib, and (on-target) inhibition
  of PI3Kδ in T cells by idelalisib. Changes occurring due to elimination of CLL cells
  and/or disruption of critical CLL-TME interaction pathways are here referred to
  as indirect effects, exemplified by CLL tumor-debulking by ibrutinib, idelalisib,
  or venetoclax, and disruption of protective signaling between nurse-like cells/tumor-associated
  macrophages and CLL cells by ibrutinib and idelalisib. Chimeric antigen receptor
  (CAR) T cells, bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
  rely directly on the engagement and activation of microenvironmental cells for anti-
  CLL activity. Binding of CAR T cells to CD19 on CLL cells activates cytolytic anti-
  CLL T-cell activity, bispecific antibodies redirect T cells into CLL cell proximity
  and engage T-cell anti-tumor activity, and immune checkpoint blockade abrogates
  checkpoint inhibitory signals unleashing the anti-CLL activity of tumor-infiltrating
  T cells. CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; BTK: Bruton tyrosine kinase; SYK: spleen
  tyrosine kinase; PI3Kδ: phosphoinositide-3-kinase δ, BCR: B-cell receptor; TCR:
  T-cell receptor; ITK: interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase BCL-2: B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2;
  TME: tumor microenvironment; NLC: nurse-like cells; TAM: tumor-associated macrophages;
  CAR T: chimeric antigen receptor T cells; CD: cluster of differentiation; PD-1:
  programmed cell death protein-1; PD-1L: programmed cell death protein-1 ligand.'
