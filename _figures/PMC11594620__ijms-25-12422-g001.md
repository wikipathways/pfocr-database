caption: Metabolic pathway of complex sphingolipids in budding yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. The pathways and proteins responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation
  of sphingolipids are shown. Orm1 and Orm2 are involved in the inhibition of the
  activity of serine palmitoyltranferase (SPT). The transport of de novo synthesized
  ceramides (Cers) from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is required for complex sphingolipid
  biosynthesis, and vesicular transport-dependent and -independent Cer transport systems
  exist. The biosynthesis of myriocin, australifungin, and aureobasidin A inhibits
  SPT, Cer synthases, and IPC synthases, respectively. Solid arrows indicate a single
  metabolic step. Dotted arrow indicates that there are two or more metabolic steps.
  Cer, ceramide; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; LCB, long-chain base; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramide;
  MIPC, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide; M(IP)2C, mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide
