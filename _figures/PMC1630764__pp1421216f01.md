caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in apple.
  Enzymes for each step are shown in bold. Flavonoid intermediates are boxed and principle
  flavonoid end products are in gray boxes. The Phe ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme is
  at a key branch point of the phenylpropanoid pathway that can lead to many classes
  of compounds. Enzymes required for flavonoid synthesis: CHS, Chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase;
  LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase. Enzymes specific for various flavonoid compounds:
  UFGT, UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase for anthocyanin synthesis. The
  unidentified enzyme encoding a glycosyl transferase for flavonol glycone synthesis
  is referred to as GT. The flavononoid-3′-hydroxylase enzyme has been omitted for
  clarity but it may hydroxylate several of the intermediates from the CHI step onwards.'
