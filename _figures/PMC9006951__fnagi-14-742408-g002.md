caption: Nerve growth factor (NGF) metabolic pathway in basal forebrain cholinergic
  neuron (BFCN) is mainly regulated by proteases involved in NGF maturation [tissue
  plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), Plasminogen
  Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and Neuroserpin)] and those involved in NGF degradation
  [matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9, MMP3) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases
  1 (TIMP-1)]. Plasmin is also responsible for proMMP-9 activation to MMP9. Extracellular
  signals (i.e., cytokines, hormones, and growth factor) bind to their ligands and
  activate Janus Kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT).
  This causes dimerization of the two and allows them to be translocated to the nucleus
  for transcriptional response. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is involved in JAK/STAT-induced
  Alzheimer. JAK/STAT inhibitor, folic acid and micropeptides (i.e., humorin and colivelin)
  attenuate JAK/STAT-induced Alzheimer. Increased astrocytes biomarker Glial fibrillary
  acidic protein (GFAP) and Genes were predominantly expressed on Astrocytes- STAT3-induced
  Alzheimer’s disease (Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3 (ntrk3), Cytochrome
  C Oxidase Copper Chaperone (COX17), and Grid2 Interacting Protein (Grid2ip). Decreased
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
  and apolipoprotein e4 (ApoE4) disrupt normal angiogenesis. Increased vascular risk
  factor, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and reduced LDL-receptor
  related protein-1 (LRP-1) disrupt healthy tight junction. Disruption of normal angiogenesis
  and healthy tight junction allow Amyloid-Beta peptides efflux from vessels to brain
  parenchyma and promoting Amyloid-Beta plaques formation.
