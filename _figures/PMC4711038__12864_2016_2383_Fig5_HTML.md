caption: 'Altered gene expression in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway during diapause.
  This scheme displays a generalized assembly (regardless tissue specificity) of relevant
  genes in the JAK/STAT signal pathway. Transcript levels (logarithmic fold change,
  LogFC) are given in red for upregulated, blue for downregulated and black for no
  significant change (ns; LogFC close to 0). The acronyms are listed in Additional
  file : Table S3 where also references and details of gene/protein functions are
  given. At the whole organism level we observed a decreased expression of the core
  components of the JAK/STAT signaling and some read-out genes in diapausing flies.
  Some exceptions are seen in certain genes, involved in humoral immune response and
  stress resistance, which were upregulated (probably tissue-specific). The scheme
  is based partly on [] and []. Further details are given in Additional file : Table
