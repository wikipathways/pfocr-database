caption: 'Biosynthesis of THF. A, schematic representation of the pathways found in
  E. coli, P. falciparum, and A. thaliana. The enzymes involved are as follows: 1,
  GTP cyclohydrolase I; 2, NUDIX hydrolase; 3, unspecific phosphatase; 4, dihydroneopterin
  aldolase; 4′,6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase; 5, GAT-ADCS (PabA and PabB in
  E. coli); 6, ADCL; 7, 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin (H2Pterin) pyrophosphokinase;
  8, dihydropteroate (H2Pteroate) synthase; 9, dihydrofolate (H2F) synthetase; 10,
  dihydrofolate reductase; 11, folylpolyglutamate synthetase; 12, thymidylate synthase.
  Other abbreviations: Cho, chorismate; pABA, p-aminobenzoate; H2PterinPP, 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin
  pyrophosphate; H4F, tetrahydrofolate; H4F-Glun, the polyglutamylated form of H4F.
  Merged symbols represent bifunctional enzymes. The activities 9 and 11 are catalyzed
  by a single enzyme in E. coli and Plasmodium. In Plasmodium, the activity 6 remains
  to be identified. Above the broken line, the activities are absent in animals. The
  black stars show the two enzymes actually targeted by antifolate drugs. The white
  stars show the potential target studied in this work. B, details of the two-step
  pathway required for pABA synthesis. In all eukaryotes, the first step involves
  a bifunctional GAT-ADCS, whereas two separate proteins PabA and PabB are found in
  most (but not all) prokaryotes ().'
