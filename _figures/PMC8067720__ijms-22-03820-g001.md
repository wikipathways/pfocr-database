caption: Cytosine methylation/demethylation cycle. Cytosine (C) can be modified by
  DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) at the 5 position to generate 5-methylcytosine (5mC).
  5mC may be sequentially oxidized by Ten Eleven Translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase
  (TET) to generate first 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and then 5-formylcytosine
  (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). Alternatively, 5mC or 5hmC may be deaminated
  by cytidine deaminase (CDA) to generate thymidine (T) or 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU),
  respectively. The base excision repair pathway (BER), along with thymine DNA glycosylase
  (TDG) and single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1),
  is required for re-generation of cytosine.
