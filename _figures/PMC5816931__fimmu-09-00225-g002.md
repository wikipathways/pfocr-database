caption: Recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by Dectin-1. An unknown Mtb
  ligand is recognized by Dectin-1, which is then tyrosine phosphorylated at its hemITAM
  residue by Src kinases (data not shown). This creates a docking site for spleen
  tyrosine kinase (Syk). Syk associates with a caspase recruitment domain family member
  9 (CARD9)/B-cell lymphoma 10 (BCL-10)/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
  translocation protein 1 (MALT1) protein complex, resulting in activation of the
  transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Pro-inflammatory cytokine production
  follows, which induce an adaptive T cell response. Dectin-1-dependent signaling
  can also occur in neutrophils, where they induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
