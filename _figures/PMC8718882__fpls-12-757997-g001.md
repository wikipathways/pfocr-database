caption: Regulation of amylose synthesis and endosperm development in rice seeds.
  (A) Wx/GBSSI is finely controlled at multiple levels. OsBP5, OsEBP89, OsbZIP58,
  OsNF-YB1, OsNF-YC12, and OsbHLH144 are transcriptional factors which could bind
  to the promoter of Wx gene and regulate its expression. Du1 and Du3 are responsible
  for alternative splicing of Wx. OsGBP and FLO6 might help the GBSS/Wx protein localized
  to starch in amylose synthesis. (B) FLO proteins (FLO10, FLO14, FLO18, FLO13, and
  FLO16 et al.) are involved in mitochondrial morphogenesis and endosperm development
  through NADH pathway. (C) The PRC2-MADS pathway for early seed development in rice.
  OsFIE1, OsFIE2, and OsEMF2B are important components of PRC2 complex. OsMADS1, OsMADS6,
  OsMADS29, OsMADS34, OsMADS78, OsMADS79, OsMADS87, and OsMADS89 are involved in the
  process of PRC2-mediated early endosperm development.
