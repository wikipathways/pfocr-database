caption: 'Comparative schematic representation of osteolytic and osteoblastic bone
  metastasis mechanisms: This figure illustrates the contrasting pathways and cellular
  interactions involved in osteolytic (left panel) and osteoblastic (right panel)
  bone metastasis. The osteolytic pathway is characterized by the destruction of bone
  tissue, primarily mediated by the activation of osteoclasts. Metastatic cells release
  tumor-derived growth factors, which stimulate the production of parathyroid hormone-related
  peptide (PTHrP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These factors promote the RANK-RANKL pathway,
  enhancing osteoclast maturation and activity, and leading to increased bone resorption.
  Bone-derived growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGFβ), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), bone morphogenetic
  proteins (BMPs), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are released during bone matrix
  degradation, and they further stimulate tumor growth in a feedback loop. The osteoblastic
  pathway involves the formation of new bone tissue, which is typically dense and
  abnormal. Tumor-derived growth factors in this context stimulate osteoblasts directly
  and also induce the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the inhibition of the Wnt
  signaling pathway antagonist, dickkopf-1 (DKK-1). This results in enhanced osteoblast
  activity and pathological bone formation. The figure also denotes the inhibitory
  effect of osteoprotegerin (OPG) on RANKL, which is not prominent in the osteoblastic
  pathway'
