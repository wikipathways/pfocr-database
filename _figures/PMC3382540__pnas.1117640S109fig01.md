caption: The ERK signaling pathway controls T-cell activation and anergy. The diagram
  illustrates the activation of the ERK pathway after T-cell receptor activation.
  Increased cytoplasmic concentrations of K-RAS and B-RAF, as seen in T cells from
  patients with RA, increase the activation of the ERK pathway and alleviate the need
  for CD28-mediated co-stimulation. Increased ERK activity prevents the induction
  of anergy by preventing SHP-1 recruitment to the T-cell receptor signaling complex,
  sustains T-cell receptor signaling, and may contribute to the autoreactivity to
  citrullinated self-antigens characteristic of RA.
