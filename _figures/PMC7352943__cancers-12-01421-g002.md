caption: Oncogenic H-Ras plays a major role in tumor transformation via two major
  pathways, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK [,]. H-Ras recruits intracellular Gal-1 from the
  cytosol. This interaction enhances H-Ras-mediated cell transformation. Since Gal-1
  has no effect on the membrane localization of inactive H-Ras, Ras activation, via
  GTP binding is needed for the H-Ras/Gal-1 interaction. Gal-1 is then able to enhance
  H-Ras-GTP, leading to an increase in Raf-1 recruitment, which culminates in a sustained
  activation of the MEK-ERK pathway and enhanced cell transformation [].
