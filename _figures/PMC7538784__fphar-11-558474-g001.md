caption: 'Current mechanisms proposed for metformin in pathological pain. The mTOR/P70S6K/4E-BP1/rS6P
  pathway activates formation of the eIF4F complex and promotes aberrant translation
  in nociceptors during pathological pain. Also, activation of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), inflammation and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways lead to pain plasticity.
  Metformin acts as a disease-modifying drug by indirectly activating AMPK. Once activated,
  phosphorylated AMPK inhibits the mTORC1 pathways reversing pain plasticity and pathological
  pain. Metformin also inhibits glucagon actions to induce its antihyperglycemic effect
  in diabetic conditions. However, the role of this pathway on pain has not been explored.
