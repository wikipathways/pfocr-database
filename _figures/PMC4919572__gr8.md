caption: 'Signaling model at a glance. In cells with FL p62 DOK1 at the membrane or
  cytoplasmic p44 DC mutant, oncogenic signaling of many target proteins is inhibited
  (such as RTK, CTK, SMAD, RAS, ELK1 e.a.) leading to reduction of SRE transcription
  (which drives cells into G1-S phase) and activation of PPRE transcription (which
  dampens cell proliferation), two exemplary read-outs used in the present study.
  PPARγ-agonist (star) further augments PPARγ-mediated growth inhibition, resulting
  in a good prognosis for patients'' survival. Mechanistically, DOK1 may act as a
  “co-chaperone” for ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of PPARγ across the ER
  and nuclear pores. In tumor cells with loss of FL p62 DOK1 or accumulation of nuclear
  p33 DN mutant, oncogenic signaling (depicted here exemplary for the RAS-ERK1/2-ELK1-SRF
  pathway) is unimpeded leading to enhanced SRE and reduced PPRE transcription, resulting
  in tumor cell proliferation and a poor prognosis. Mechanistically, MEK1 and ERK1/2
  inhibit nuclear translocation of PPARγ by promoting its export to the cytoplasm
  and inactivation by phosphorylation. Legend: red = active oncogene; blue black = active
  tumor suppressor; grey = inactive protein.'
