caption: A hypothetical model showing the roles of Fak and paxillin in motile HeLa
  cells. Integrin signals have been well documented to include a pathway that leads
  to activation of Rac1 activity, such as through the p130Cas and Crk pathway. Such
  activation of Rac1 is closely related to plasma membrane ruffling and enhanced cell
  motility. Our results suggest that integrin signals also include a pathway that
  evokes a mechanism to down-regulate Rac1 activity at the cell–cell contact areas
  of the cell periphery, in which the presence of Fak and paxillin appears to be essential.
  Paxillin participates in efficient FA recruitment of Fak, and Tyr861 phosphorylation
  may be important for Fak function. Such localized down-regulation of Rac1 activity
  appears to be crucial for the maintenance of the normal morphology and normal dynamics
  of the plasma membrane, the formation of N-cadherin–based cell–cell adhesions, and
  perhaps also for the maintenance of N-cadherin–based cell–cell adhesions in the
  collective migration of HeLa cells. Integrin-mediated down-regulation of Rac1 activity
  upon cell–cell collision may also be important for the contact inhibition of movement.
