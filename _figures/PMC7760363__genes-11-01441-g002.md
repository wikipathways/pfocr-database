caption: Schematic model of hormonal regulation of parthenocarpic fruit set in tomato
  (A) Parthenocarpy obtained either by exogenous treatments or by genetic manipulations
  of phytohormones. Gene name in blue means that the gene overexpression leads to
  parthenocarpy; gene name in pink indicates that the gene silencing causes parthenocarpy.
  TIR-1 (TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1), auxin receptor; ARF5/7/8 (Auxin Response
  Factor 5/7/8) components of the auxin signaling pathway; PAD-1 (aminotransferase)
  implicated in auxin biosynthesis; PIN4 (PIN-formed 4 auxin efflux carrier), component
  of the auxin transport; AUCSIA (AUxin Cum Silencing Action), probably implicated
  in the regulation of auxin transport; DELLA, repressors of GA responses; GA20ox
  (GA 20 oxidase) a GA biosynthetic gene; GA2ox (GA 2 oxidase), a GA catabolic enzyme;
  NCED (nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase) an ABA biosynthetic gene; ETR-1 (Ethylene
  receptor 1), implicated in ethylene perception; TPR1, (tetratricopeptide repeat
  protein 1), able to bind the ethylene receptor. (B) Interplay between auxin and
  GAs. Before fertilization, the regulatory complex formed by DELLA, an unidentified
  transcriptional regulator (?), and ARF7, represses the transcription of auxin-related
  genes and the complex IAA9/ARF7 inhibits the transcription of enzymes involved in
  GAs biosynthesis. After fertilization, the increased auxin level inside the ovules
  determines the degradation of IAA9, thus permitting the activation of GA biosynthesis.
  As a consequence, DELLA repressor is degraded, allowing the dimerization of ARF7
  with additional ARF (ARF?) to modulate the transcription of auxin-related genes,
  thus inducing ovary growth.
