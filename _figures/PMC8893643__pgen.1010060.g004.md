caption: (A) Double-stranded break caused by Cas9 is followed by 5’–3’ resection of
  the broken ends, leaving 3’ overhangs which will search for homology to initiate
  repair. (B) One of the overhanging strands finds homology in the donor and invades
  very closely to the homology arm-transgene junction, thereby bypassing the recoding
  on this side of the homology arms. The invading strand synthesises DNA using donor
  sequences as a template. (C) When this newly synthesised strand recognises homology
  on the 3’ overhang of the other end of the DSB, it dissociates from the template,
  anneals to the 3’ overhang, and is ligated to the 5’ end of one of the previously
  resected strands (squared in blue). (D) The other strand now repairs its break by
  DNA synthesis and ligation using the invading strand as its template, forming a
  heteroduplex region (squared in red). (E) Finally, the heteroduplex region is resolved
  by the mismatch repair pathway which favours the invading strand over the non-invading
  strand.
