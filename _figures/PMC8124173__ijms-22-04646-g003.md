caption: Mechanisms of Mn-induced apoptosis. Mn exposure results in mitochondrial
  dysfunction and Bax-associated cytochrome c leakage with subsequent caspase 9 and
  3 activation resulting in apoptosis. Mn-induced apoptosis may be aggravated by stimulatory
  effects of manganese on p53 protein as well as down-regulation of murine double
  minute 2 (Mdm2) homolog and wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) protein,
  both having inhibitory influence on p53 []. The impact of Mn on p53 signaling may
  be also mediated by Mn-dependent modulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  kinase []. In turn, Mn may decrease anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl2 and BDNF through
  inhibiting CREB phosphorylation and subsequent down-regulation of Bcl2 and BDNF
  expression []. It has been also demonstrated that mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
  may be also aggravated by Mn-induced alteration of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) expression,
  a protein involved in mitochondrial fusion and functioning [].
