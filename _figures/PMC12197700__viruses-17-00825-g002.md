caption: Disruption of the SA signaling pathway by viral proteins. The C4 protein
  of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) negatively regulates the SA signaling pathway
  by targeting CAS in chloroplast, leading to impaired SA biosynthesis. The βC1 protein
  encoded by tobacco curly shoot betasatellite (TbCSB) and the C2 protein encoded
  by TYLCV suppress the expression of SA-downstream genes by targeting NPR3 and TGA2,
  respectively. TbCSB βC1 inhibits NPR3 degradation by interacting with HSP90 and
  TYLCV C2 inhibits TGA2 transcription by targeting TCP7
