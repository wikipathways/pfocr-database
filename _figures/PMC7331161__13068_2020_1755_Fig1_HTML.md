caption: Overview of the engineered biosynthetic pathway to mannitol in the cyanobacterium
  Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Solid arrows without wings represent native steps in
  cell; dashed arrows represent introduced pathway of mannitol synthesis; engineered
  enzymes are shown in blue; red circles with diagonal red line indicate deleted proteins;
  red cross-lines indicate metabolites that cannot be synthesized. White double circles
  represent protection against osmotic pressure by compatible solutes or mannitol
  in the cells. Grey ovals represent salt stress. 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
