caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and renal cysts and polycystic kidney disease
  development (by Figdraw). TSC1pt-KO mice exhibited proliferation and hypertrophy
  of renal proximal tubule cells with cystic degeneration. In vivo, metformin treatment
  resulted in increased AMPK phosphorylation; activation of pro-apoptotic factors
  BAD and cleaved caspase−3; and concomitant blockade of the pro-survival factor Akt.
  This inhibited the aberrant renal proliferation induced by TSC1 deletion, which
  was reversed by the AMPK inhibitor dosomorphine. In mouse RTE cells, knockdown of
  Fnip1 resulted in decreased AMPK activity and increased mTORC1 pathway activity.
  Notably, when Fnip1 and TSC1 were co-deleted, the mTORC1 signaling pathway was massively
  activated, leading to a significant acceleration in the development of PKD compared
  to deletion of Fnip1 or TSC1 alone. When PKD1 was knocked down in renal mesangial
  cells, the kidney was more likely to progress toward cystic degeneration.In addition,
  mutations in TSC1 and PKD1 in glomerular mesangial cells may exacerbate the development
  of renal cystic degeneration by inducing the secretion of growth-promoting factors,
  which promotes the proliferation of renal tubular cells. It is noteworthy that TSC1/Foxil-dKO
  and CAII/TSC1-dKO mice have a lower cystic load than TSC1-KO mice. TSC1pt-KO: Renal
  proximal tubule TSC1-specific knockout; AMPK: AMP-activated Protein Kinase; BAD:
  Bcl−2 Associated Agonist of Cell Death; Akt: Protein kinase B; TSC1: Tuberous sclerosis
