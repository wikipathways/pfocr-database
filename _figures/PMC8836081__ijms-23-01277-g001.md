caption: Potential regulation of PAR1 activity in MSCs by TLR4. TLR4 stimulation leads
  to prothrombin expression by MSCs, which in turn can be converted into thrombin
  and then subsequently cleave PAR1 on MSCs. PAR1 activation by thrombin leads to
  G-protein coupled signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Activation of PAR1 by thrombin
  and ERK1/2 phosphorylation is dependent on having an intact TLR4 pathway.
