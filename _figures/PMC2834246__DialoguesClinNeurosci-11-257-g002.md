caption: 'Regulation of chromatin structure by drugs of abuse. Drug-induced signaling
  events are depicted for psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. These
  drugs increase cAMP levels in striatum, which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and
  leads to phosphorylation of its targets. This includes the cAMP response element
  binding protein (CREB), the phosphorylation of which induces its association with
  the histone acetyltransferase, CREB binding protein (CBP) to acetylate histones
  and facilitate gene activation. This is known to occur on many genes including fosB
  and c-fos in response to psychostimulant exposure. AFosB is also upregulated by
  chronic psychostimulant treatments, and is known to activate certain genes (eg,
  cdk5) and repress others (eg, c-fos) where it recruits HDAC1 as a corepressor. This
  repression of c-fos also involves increased repressive histone methylation, which
  is thought to occur via the induction of specific histone methyltransferases (HMTs).
  In addition, cocaine regulates the HMT, KMT1 C/G9a, which alters histone H3 methylation
  on K9. It is not yet known how cocaine regulates histone demethylases (HDM) or DNA
  methyltransferases (DNMTs). Cocaine also activates the mitogen activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) cascade, which through MSK1 can phosphorylate CREB and histone H3
  at serine 10. Cocaine promotes H3 phosphorylation via a distinct pathway, whereby
  PKA activates protein phosphatase 2A, leading to the dephosphorylation of serine
  97 of DARPP32. This causes DARPP32 to accumulate in the nucleus and inhibit protein
  phosphatase-1 (PP1) which normally dephosphorylates H3. Chronic exposure to psychostimulants
  increases glutamatergic stignaling from the prefrontal cortex to the NAc. Glutamatergic
  signaling elevates Ca2+ levels in NAc postsynaptic elements where it activates CaMK
  (calcium/calmodulin protein kinases) signaling, which, in addition to phosphorylating
  CREB, also phosphorylates HDAC5. This results in nuclear export of HDAC5 and increased
  histone acetylation on its target genes (eg, NK1R[NK1 or substance P receptor]).
