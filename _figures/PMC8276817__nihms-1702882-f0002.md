caption: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) supports myriad oncogenic processes. (i) Activation
  of the RAS/RAF/MEK signalling cascade is a common oncogenic driver in many tumour
  types and can be activated by mutations in a tumour type specific manner. KRAS mutations
  at amino acids G12 or G13 are for example commonly found in colorectal and pancreatic
  cancer which results in defective GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis and constitutive activation.
  In melanoma, BRAF frequently has an activating phosphomimetic mutation at amino
  acid V600E. In RAS or RAF mutant cancer cells, blockade of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway
  using either RAF or MEK inhibitors activates FAK and promotes cell survival by reactivation
  of ERK signalling,,. The combination of FAK (defactinib) and dual RAF/MEK (VS-6766)
  inhibitors is being investigated in clinical trials in patients with melanoma, non-small
  cell lung carcinoma, low grade serous ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and other
  RAS mutant solid tumours–. (ii) In mutant-BRAF colorectal cancer cells, MAPK pathway
  blockade activates FAK in a β1-integrin and SRC independent way and promotes Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling and survival. (iii) The small GTPase RHOA regulates the actin cytoskeleton.
  Activation of the RHOA signalling pathway by either gain-of-function mutation of
  RHOA and inactivation of the tumour suppressor CDH1 in diffuse gastric cancer activates
  FAK and subsequent YAP, PI3K and β-catenin signalling. Alternatively, activating
  mutations in Gαq subunits (GNAQ or GNA11) of heterotrimeric G-proteins in uveal
  melanoma activates FAK via the RHOA signalling pathway to support YAP signalling
  and tumour growth. (iv) Activated FAK in diffuse gastric cancer and uveal melanoma
  alleviates the negative regulation of YAP by LAST1/2. As mutant GNAQ/GNA11 signalling
  in uveal melanoma also activates the MAPK pathway, the combination of FAK (IN10018)
  and MEK (cobimetinib) inhibition is being tested in a clinical trial. FAK activity
  can promote the nuclear translocation of YAP and combinations of FAK inhibitors
  with inhibitors of YAP expression, for example Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors,
  or transcriptional activity, may be needed to reinforce inhibition of oncogenic
  YAP signalling.
