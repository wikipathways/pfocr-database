caption: Schematic showing intracellular sites at which GPCR signaling has been described.
  GPCRs are produced within the biosynthetic pathway and reside in plasma membranes
  from which they generate G protein signaling. Following receptor internalization
  via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) GPCRs can internalize to very early endosomes (VEEs,
  which are characterized by the presence of leucine zipper 1), or early endosomes,
  from which additional G protein signaling can be produced. GPCRs including LHR and
  FFAR2 can signal from VEEs, while receptors including V2R and PTH1R can signal from
  early endosomes, which may involve β-arrestin (βarr). GPCRs may be trafficked via
  retromer complexes to the trans-Golgi network. TSHR signals from these sites to
  generate cAMP and CREB-mediated transcription
