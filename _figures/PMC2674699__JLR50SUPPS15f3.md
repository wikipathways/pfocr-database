caption: The SREBP pathway. When cells are depleted of sterols, Scap transports SREBPs
  from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Release of SREBPs from the membrane is initiated
  by Site-1 Protease (S1P), a Golgi-located protease that cleaves SREBPs in the luminal
  loop between the two membrane-spanning sequences. Once the two halves of the SREBP
  are separated, a second Golgi protease, Site-2 Protease (S2P), cleaves the NH2-terminal
  bHLH-Zip domain of SREBP at a site located within the membrane-spanning region.
  After the second cleavage, the NH2-terminal bHLH-Zip domain leaves the membrane,
  carrying three hydrophobic residues at its COOH-terminus. The cleaved SREBP enters
  the nucleus, where it activates genes controlling lipid synthesis and uptake.
