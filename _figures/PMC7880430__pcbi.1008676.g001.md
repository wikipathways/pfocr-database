caption: a) A part of the branched metabolic pathway rn00330 from L-Glutamate to L-Ornithine
  in KEGG. b) A part of the branched metabolic pathway rn00030 from D-Ribose 5-phosphate
  to beta-D-Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in KEGG. The conserved atom groups transferred
  from source compound to current compound are drawn in red for pathways 1 and 2.
  The conserved atom groups transferred from source compound to current compound are
  drawn in orange and green for pathways 3 and 4 respectively. The partition circled
  with green dashed line in the compound L-Glutamate 5-semialdehyde is the overlapping
  part of the conserved atom groups of pathways 1 and 2. Note that, in this paper,
  the compounds and reactions are represented by their KEGG identifiers.
