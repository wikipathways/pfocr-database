caption: Scheme tentatively summarizing the involvement of ACBD7 and its related product
  NDN in the effects of leptin in the ARC. According to this scheme, ACBD7-producing
  neurons would release NDN in response to an increase of leptin (Leptin) concentrations
  and stimulate the activity of POMC neurons. Activation of POMC neurons of the ARC
  would lead to the activation of the melanocortin signaling pathway and subsequently
  to a decrease in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure.
