  in the posttraumatic stress disorder with normal vs high body mass index (PNH) comparison
  among male subjects and was determined to form a network with other genes differentially
  expressed in the dataset involved in inflammation as well as with members of the
  NPY signaling pathway: receptor Y4 (NPY4R/NPY4R2) and receptor Y5 (NPY5R). Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software was used to generate a spatial representation of this
  inferred network, formed surrounding “seed” molecules in the dataset that are highly
  interconnected based on known biological relationships and including other molecules
  known to interact. Shapes represent the type of molecule. Colors inside the shapes
  signify regulation of gene expression (red = upregulation; green = downregulation).
  Solid line signifies a direct relationship; dotted line signifies an indirect relationship.
