caption: Schematic representation of PA biosynthetic pathway in duckweed, tomato and
  Arabidopsis. Comparative analysis of PA biosynthetic pathway in duckweed versus
  land plants shows the absence of ODC pathway in duckweed as in Arabidopsis, while
  tomato harbors both ADC and ODC pathways. Like the bacterial ADC gene AdiA (Tolbert
  et al. ; Andréll et al. ; Deka et al. ) and Lactobacillus ODC gene (L30a OrnDC)
  (Momany et al. ), one of the duckweed ADC was found to be of prokaryotic origin
  which may utilize multiple substrates, such as lysine and ornithine
