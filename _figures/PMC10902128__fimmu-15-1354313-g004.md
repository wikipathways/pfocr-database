caption: TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β ligand family binds to type II and type
  I receptors on the cell membrane to form complexes. Phosphorylated type II receptors
  activate type I receptors to recruit and activate downstream SMAD2/3 proteins. SMAD4
  interacts with SMAD2/3 proteins to form complexes, thereby inducing Smad proteins
  to aggregate in the nucleus. Transcriptional regulation as a transcription factor.
  TGF-β induces Tregs cell differentiation and promotes tumor progression. Inhibition
  of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, NK cells, DC infiltration. JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
  Cytokine binds to cell membrane surface receptor to activate JAK (Janus kinase)
  which activates the receptor, activated JAK binds and phosphorylates STAT protein,
  phosphorylated STAT protein forms a dimer, enters the nucleus and binds to DNA to
  regulate gene transcription. JAK-STAT signaling pathway induces Tregs differentiation,
  inhibits CD8+ T cell aggregation, affects sentence realization and cell transformation
  into M2 macrophages, and also promotes the survival of NK cells and DCs. Wnt/β-Catenin
  Signaling pathway. The Wnt protein binds to the Frizzled receptor on the cell membrane
  surface to form the Wnt-Frizzled complex. The activated Frizzled receptor interacts
  with the LRP to further activate the downstream signaling molecules. β-Catenin interacts
  with the complex and degrades and releases β-catenin, and the activated signaling
  molecule inhibits the activity of GSK-3β enzyme and prevents its phosphorylation
  of β-catenin, thereby stabilizing β-catenin. After the stable accumulation of β-Catenin
  enters the nucleus, it binds to the TCF/LEF transcription factor family and initiates
  the transcription of downstream target genes. Wnt/β-Catenin can inhibit the infiltration
  of CD8+ T cells and DCs, promote the differentiation of macrophages into M2 type
  and the infiltration of Tregs, and promote the development of tumors. NF - κB signaling
  pathway. Toll-like receptor (TLR), TCR, B cell receptor (BCR), tumor necrosis factor
  receptor (TNFR), and IL-1R stimulate NF-κB signaling. TNFR activation triggers TRADD
  aggregation, and TRAF2 interacts with protein kinase RIP1. RIP1 ubiquitinates and
  recruits NEMO. IκB is phosphorylated by the IKK complex, which labels iκbα by phosphorylation
  and subsequently degrades NF-κB (p50-p65) via a ubiquitin-dependent pathway and
  is transported to the nucleus. Inactivation of NF-κB signaling pathway can promote
  tumor progression and affect CD8+ T cells, and normal activation can promote the
  activation of CD8+ T cells and DCs. Overactivation increases the number of MDCS
  and also affects the transformation of macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype
