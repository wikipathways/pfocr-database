caption: 'The structural genes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase
  (C4H), 4-coumaroyl: CoA-ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase
  (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3''-hydroxylase (F3’H), flavonoid
  3''5''-hydroxylase (F3’5’H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase
  (ANS), and UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) are indicated in
  bold. The transcription factors including MYB, MYB-related, bHLH, NAC, WRKY, bZIP,
  MADS, and WD40 are highlighted in ellipse. White, green and red colors are used
  to indicate the transcript levels for stable, down- regulated, and up-regulated,
  respectively.'
