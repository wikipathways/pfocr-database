caption: Biosynthetic pathway involving caffeine. Information about the biosynthetic
  pathway of the enriched fragment caffeine in C. irrawadiensis was obtained from
  Retropath (top). The biosynthetic pathways from caffeine to xanthine, theophylline,
  and 1-methyluric acid were obtained from Pathpred (bottom)
