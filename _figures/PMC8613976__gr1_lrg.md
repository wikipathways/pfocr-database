caption: Proposed model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in COVID-19 inflammation.
  The first signal of the process begins, followed by the release of viral antigen
  (PAMPs) and subsequent recognition of susceptible PRR []. This ligand-induced conformational
  change in toll-like receptor (TLR) then recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinases
  and resulting in transcription of several genes associated with inflammation followed
  by NF-kB pathway activation (2). The second signal comes from the cytosolic K+ efflux
  resulted from oxidative stress that causes recruitment and oligomerization of NLRP3
  components as NLRP3-PYCARD-pro-CASP1 complex (3). Self-activation of pro-CASP1 through
  proteolytic cleavage into active CASP1 is the main event (4) that further catalyzes
  the maturation of IL-1 related cytokine and GSDMD (5). The active GSDMD then induce
  pore formation into the cytoplasmic membrane (6); thus the release of inflammatory
  cytokines outside of cellular environment occur (7) that causes different clinical
  outcome with massive cell deaths (8). PM, plasma membrane; PAMP, pathogen associated
  molecular pattern; DAMP, damage associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition
  receptor; TLR, toll like receptor; CASP1, caspase 1; GSDMD, gasdermin D.
