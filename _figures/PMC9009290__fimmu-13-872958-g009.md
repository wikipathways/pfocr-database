caption: A schematic diagram of the role of chrysin in suppressing influenza virus
  infection by blocking G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
  Chrysin restrains influenza virus infection by disrupting ROS-mediated dual signaling
  pathways, including the suppression of p53 and p21, which promotes the activation
  of CDK4, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1, culminating in the prevention of cell cycle arrest
  at the G0/G1 phase. Alternatively, chrysin can reduce ROS-mediated Bax while increasing
  Bcl-xl, which in turn blocks mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting cleaved-caspase
  9 and cleaved-caspase 3.
