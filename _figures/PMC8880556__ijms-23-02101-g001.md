caption: 'Neuronal A2AR signaling cascades. A2AR is a Gs(olf)-protein-coupled receptor
  involved in various physiologic processes. (1) The allosteric modulation sites may
  be pharmacologically relevant for avoiding adverse effects on the cardiovascular
  and other peripheral systems. (2) Binding of adenosine and an allosteric modulator
  to A2ARs enhances the activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein
  kinase A (PKA), resulting in the phosphorylation of calcium ion channels and increased
  influx of Ca+2 into the cytoplasm. (3) The PKA pathway also promotes neural progenitor
  cell (NPC) survival, proliferation, and differentiation; and activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP)-kinase pathway. (4) PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the cAMP-responsive
  element binding protein 1 (CREB-1) regulates the expression of genes such as c-fos,
  enkephalin (ENK), neurotensin, and zinc finger protein 268 (zif268). (5) The secretion
  of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B (TrkB) receptors in response to A2AR activation in hippocampal neurons
  may be relevant for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. (6) A2AR activation
  may be a counter mechanism to control the activation and expression of dopamine
  D2 receptors (D2Rs). Long-term imbalance of D2R signaling leads to impairments in
  cognitive and motor functions and the development of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
  diseases. (7) Activation of A2AR in the nucleus accumbens increases slow-wave sleep
  in mice. Solid black arrows represent the primary signaling pathway of A2ARs, and
  dashed black arrows represent secondary signaling pathways. A: Adenosine; D: Dopamine.'
