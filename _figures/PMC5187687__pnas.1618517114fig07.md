caption: Schematic diagram of the DAPK signal transduction pathways in suppression
  of HCV replication by peg-IFN-α. Our results demonstrate that DAPK is one of the
  important regulators mediating the antiviral activity of peg-IFN-α. During the antiviral
  response, DAPK can function in parallel to suppress HCV replication through activation
  of mTOR/PAK-1 and phosphorylation of eIF2α. Additionally, peg-IFN-α induces several
  signaling pathways for suppression of HCV replication, including PKR, p56, and p53
  that are independent of DAPK activation. We propose that the antiviral response
  of peg-IFN-α against HCV is by promoting the DAPK-dependent and -independent pathway.
