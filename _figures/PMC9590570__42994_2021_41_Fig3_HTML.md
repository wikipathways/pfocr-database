caption: Diagrams showing the photoperiodic flowering regulated by light signals and
  circadian clock in several typical plants. a In Arabidopsis, a facultative long-day
  plants, CO and FT function as central components for photoperiodic flowering, regulated
  by clock components and light signals transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.
  b In SD plants soybean, E1 has been identified as the main pathway to regulate photoperiodic
  flowering, which is regulated by light signal and circadian clock, and regulate
  GmFTs with different functions. c CO-FT signaling module is conserved in rice, a
  SD monocot, but Hd1, a homology of CO, has opposite effects on flowering time regulation
  under LD and SD. In addition, rice has evolved a few unique components and pathways
  to control heading date, such as Ehd1 and Ghd7. d In LD monocot wheat, PRR proteins
  are required for photoperiod sensitivity, and other mechanisms need to be further
  studied
