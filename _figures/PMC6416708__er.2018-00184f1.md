  TGRLs are derived from an endogenous pathway through the liver and an exogenous
  pathway through the small intestine. In the endogenous pathway, VLDL is produced
  in the hepatocytes from FFAs derived from the circulation or newly synthesized in
  the liver. A variety of apolipoproteins are added to the surface of the nascent
  VLDL particle during secretion, including apoB100, apoCII, apoCIII, and apoE. Once
  VLDL is secreted into the plasma, LPL along the luminal surface of capillaries hydrolyzes
  the TGs within the core of VLDL into FFAs generating VLDL remnant/IDL particles
  and lipolytic products. The FFAs are taken up by muscle and adipose tissue. The
  IDL particles are further catabolized into LDL and lipolytic products by HL. In
  the exogenous pathway, dietary fats are absorbed by enterocytes and incorporated
  into apoB48 containing chylomicrons, which are then secreted into the lymphatic
  system and enter the circulation, where they acquire apoCII, apoCIII, and apoE.
  In the circulation, LPL along the luminal surface of capillaries hydrolyzes the
  TGs within the core of chylomicrons into FFAs generating chylomicron remnant particles.
  The FFAs can be taken up muscle and adipose tissue. Endogenous and exogenous remnants
  are cleared from the circulation by hepatic uptake via the LDL receptor, LRP1, and
  HSPG receptor. LPL plays a key role in TGRL metabolism and is highly regulated by
  various proteins. ANGPTL 3, ANGPTL 4, and apoCIII inhibit LPL activity, whereas
  apoCII is an important activator of LPL activity. TGRL and their remnants readily
  penetrate the arterial wall and can be taken up by scavenger receptors on macrophages
  directly without oxidative modification, leading to formation of foam cells and
  atherosclerotic plaque development. ANGPTL, angiopoietin-like protein; HL, hepatic
  lipase; LRP1, LDL receptor related protein-1; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan.
