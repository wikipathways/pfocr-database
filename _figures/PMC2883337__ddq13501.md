caption: 'Chromaffin cell genes involved in catecholamine biosynthesis, storage, secretion
  and degradation. Depicted are important chromaffin cell-expressed genes and functional
  relationships between them. Two different parameters are color coded: the heritability
  (H2) of transcript abundance as computed from the RI panel and the normalized ratio
  (NR) for differences between the progenitors (on the left and right side of each
  box, respectively). The red curved arrow represents the catecholamine biosynthetic
  pathway, with the intermediates also in red. The blue curved arrows represent the
  detected gene regulatory networks from eQTL analysis, pointing from the regulator
  to the regulated gene.'
