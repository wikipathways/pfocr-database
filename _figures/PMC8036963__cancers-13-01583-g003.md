caption: The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway involves sensor, transducer, mediator/amplifier,
  and effector proteins, which act following the induction of a DNA lesion or replication
  stress. The induction of single-strand breaks (SSB) or double-strand breaks (DSB)
  activates specific DDR kinases (i.e., DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR). In turn, this allows
  the activation of genes and proteins involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair.
  In the presence of highly damaged cells, apoptosis and senescence are activated
  to deplete or to semi-permanently arrest cells, respectively. For detail, see the
