caption: A model that depicts the copper transit system and its link to AD. Copper
  transporter 1 (CTR1) transports Cu+ into brain cells. Cu2+ uptake is aided by DMT1.
  Various Cu chaperones, including such copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase
  (CCS), cytochrome oxidase enzyme complex (COX17), and antioxidant protein (ATOX1),
  sequester accumulated Cu into particular cellular sites. ATOX1 is thought to transfer
  Cu+ to ATP7A (copper-transporting P-type ATPase) and ATP7B, which aid in the import
  of Cu+ into synaptic vesicles for release and/or facilitate Cu export straightforwardly.
  Increased oxidative stress may be caused by excessive intracellular Cu+ activating
  the Fenton reaction. Cu2+ also leads to tau hyperphosphorylation by stimulating
  the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) pathway, which is implicated in the production
  of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) important for Aβ breakdown. Copper interacts
  to Aβ in the synaptic cleft, facilitating the production of senile plaques.
