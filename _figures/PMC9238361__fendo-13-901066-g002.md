caption: 'Cellular NAD+ metabolism induced by Sirtuin family. The enzymatic activity
  of the Sirtuin family is mainly to remove the acetyl group from the target protein.
  Firstly, NAD+ is cut into NAM and ADP-ribose, and the acetyl group on the target
  protein is transferred to ADP-ribose to form acetyl-ADP-ribose. Therefore, some
  members of the Sirtuin family can also play a role in ADP ribosyltransferase. The
  increase of NAD+ levels is closely related to the activation of the Sirtuin family
  members during moderate fasting and caloric restriction. On the contrary, aging,
  cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases as well as metabolic diseases
  such as insulin resistance lead to a decrease in NAD+ levels, which is related to
  the decrease in Sirtuin family activity. Mammalian cells can produce NAD+ from Tryptophan
  via the Kynurenine pathway or from NA, one of the forms of vitamin B3, via the Preiss-Handler
  pathway, while most NAD+ is recovered from NAM and NR via the Salvage pathway. NAD+
  can be reduced to NADH during glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and the TCA cycle.
  NAD+ also acts as a substrate for enzymes such as Sirtuins, producing NAM as a byproduct,
  and affects metabolism, genomic stability, gene expression, inflammation, circadian
  rhythm, and stress resistance. This response pattern of the Sirtuin family is extensive.
