caption: '(a) Mechanisms of adhesion formation: (1) Inhibition of fibrinolysis and
  ECM deposition. In this scenario, fibrin deposits become challenging to eliminate,
  and the accumulation of the ECM surpasses the tissue repair requirements; (2) Inflammatory
  response. This involves the increased production of TGF-β1. By regulating ECM deposition,
  TGF-β1 facilitates the formation and progression of adhesions; (3) Hypoxia. It stimulates
  increased expression of VEGF and TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 and enhances angiogenesis, leading
  to excessive ECM deposition and hyperproliferation of fibrous tissue, ultimately
  inducing adhesion formation [4]; (b,c) Physical isolation: (b) The lateral wall
  model of the cecum was established and the different effects with and without hydrogel
  treatment. Among them, the group with hydrogel applied effectively inhibited fibrosis
  by decreasing the levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TGF-β1 and activating the TGF-β1/Smad7
  and limiting the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, whereas the group without hydrogel
  experienced adhesions [23]; (c) An electrostatic spinning membrane to prevent adhesion
  and inhibit tumor recurrence or metastasis by removing residual tumor cells and
  immune activation [22]'
