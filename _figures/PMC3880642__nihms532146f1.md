caption: (I) Biogenesis and processing. The pol II enzyme directs the synthesis of
  primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are post-transcriptionally modified
  by the addition of a 5′-cap and a 3′-poly (A) tail and cropped by a dsRNA-specific
  ribonuclease Drosha/Pasha into the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) (70 nt hairpin structure).
  The pre-miRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm by the nuclear export factor
  Exportin-5 and then maturated further (into 22 nt structure) by another RNase III
  enzyme, Dicer. This duplex is unwound, and the complementary strand is subjected
  to degradation, while the miRNA strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing
  complex (RISC), which can mediate both translational repression and mRNA transcript
  cleavage depending on the extent of homology between the miRNA and its target mRNA.
  (II) The miRNA-binding-mediated mRNA fate. (A) The miRNA that has perfect complementarity
  to target mRNA, processes the mRNA and leads to its cleavage via the siRNA pathway.
  The miRNA, which has partial complementary to the mRNA, causes translational inhibition
  either by (B) inhibiting ribosomal elongation upon recruitment of a protease that
  degrades the nascent polypeptide chain or, (C) by interacting with RISC and the
  translation initiation complex protein eIF4E, leading to a ribosome-free miRNA:mRNA
  structure that is directed to the processing bodies (P-bodies). There it interacts
  with the Ccr4:Not1 deadenylase complex and usually tends to undergo the miRNA-mediated
  decay, whereas, in some instances, the mRNA:miRNA complex may be stored in the P-body,
  and following an appropriate stimulus, might re-enter the cytoplasm for renewed
  translation. (III) Disruption of miRNA-directed regulation. This is caused by epigenetic/genetic
  modulations of the miRNA expression levels, defective miRNA-processing apparatus
  and defective mRNA translational machinery. The loss of tumor suppressor miRNAs
  may increase the translation of oncogenes, and thus, the formation of oncogenic
  proteins. On the other hand, upregulation of oncogenic miRNAs may block tumor suppressor
  genes that further enhance tumor development.
