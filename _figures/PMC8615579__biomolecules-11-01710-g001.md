caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the construction of the campesterol and 24-methylene-cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathways, based on the native ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. The campesterol biosynthesis pathway was constructed by disrupting ERG5
  and expressing the heterologous 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene (DHCR7). The
  24-methylene-cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was constructed from the campesterol
  biosynthesis pathway via the disruption of ERG4. Sterol biosynthesis uses a common
  acetyl-CoA precursor.
