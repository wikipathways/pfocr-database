caption: Future perspectives in eye pathological angiogenesis using intravitreal targeted
  therapy. Schematic retinal flat mount showing neovascularization on the superficial
  vascular plexus. Intravitreal eye injection is the therapy currently used as a treatment
  for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related
  macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. The treatments currently used focus
  on blocking the VEGF signaling pathway, and although it has beneficial results in
  patients, complications occur while inhibiting normal functions. Thus, researchers
  are looking for specific molecules that are not constitutively expressed that unbalance
  ocular homeostasis. G-quadruplex aptamers have many advantages compared to immunological
  therapy, such as lower molecular weight, controllable post-production modifications,
  non-toxic and non-immunogenic, with lower costs of production. Created with BioRender.com.
