caption: 'Basal ganglial circuitry in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and tentative cannabinoid
  targets to improve motor disability in PD. Progressive loss of dopaminergic innervation
  in PD causes overactivity of the indirect (inhibitory) pathway, resulting in excess
  glutamatergic drive to the GPi and SNpr and diminished activity of the inhibitory
  GABAergic direct pathway, further disinhibiting the activity of the GPi and SNpr.
  As output nuclei (GPi and SNpr) use the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, this amplified
  basal ganglia output leads to extreme inhibition of the motor thalamus which acts
  as a “brake” on motor activity; thus, resulting in the onset of parkinsonian syndrome.
  The neural circuitry above depicts various possible cannabinoid- based targets (CB1,
  CB2, and TRPV1 receptors) that can be used to mitigate the symptoms observed in
  PD. Abbreviations: CB1, cannabinoid receptor 1; TRPV1, transient receptor potential
  vanilloid 1; GPe, external segment of the globus pallidus; GPi, internal segment
  of the globus pallidus; SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta; SNpr, substantia nigra
  pars reticulata; STN, subthalamic nucleus; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid.'
