caption: Iron chelation encompasses the ability to support the host response by modulating
  cellular function and metabolism in various Mtb-infected immune cells. The use of
  iron chelators could potentially regulate a host of intracellular networks and support
  infected host cells by influencing several cellular processes. 1. Iron chelation
  results in a dysfunctional electron transport chain (ETC) as the ETC relies heavily
  on iron for optimal cellular function. A dysfunctional ETC could result in decreased
  production of ROS and a reduced capacity to undergo oxidative phosphorylation potentially
  promoting glycolysis. 2. Iron chelators have also been previously shown to have
  direct and indirect bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects on Mtb. 3. Iron chelation
  directly inhibits prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, proteins that normally
  function to silence HIF1α, by chelating one of its primary cofactors, iron. 4. Inhibition
  of the PHD proteins, through iron chelation, leads to the stabilization of HIF1α
  which can have various effects on cell function. 5. HIF1α plays an important role
  in promoting cellular survival in an oxygen-deprived microenvironment such as hypoxia.
  6. HIF1α can also induce the production of IL1β, an important pro-inflammatory cytokine
  that helps control Mtb replication, by directly binding to the promotor of pro-IL1β.
  6. IFNγ can boost production of nitric oxide (NO), IL1β and prostaglandin (e.g.,
  PGE2) production, via HIF1α. Iron chelation can also inhibit IDO1, a key enzyme
  in tryptophan metabolism, and promote additional IFNy production. Moreover, iron
  has been shown to increase the autophagic process. 7. The effect of HIF1α and iron
  chelators on pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolism remains unclear, however,
  such alterations in this pathway could be beneficial. Increased NO and superoxide
  production can help kill unwanted infectious agents, and as the PPP is linked to
  NADPH and ROS production, decreased activity of this pathway could potentially reduce
  host injury and increase flux through glycolysis. 8. Iron chelators also encompass
  the ability to significantly boost glycolysis; such boosts in glycolysis are linked
  to the production of a host of pro-inflammatory mediators and the expression of
  various costimulatory molecules which could also link innate and adaptive immunity
  during Mtb infection. 9. By supporting glycolysis, iron chelators could also simultaneously
  enhance the activity of both the TCA cycle and glutamine metabolism which are intrinsically
  linked to the production of succinate, ROS, NO, IL1β, and glutathione. 10. The effect
  of iron chelation on these cellular processes could also be further augmented when
  administered in combination with other host directed therapies during Mtb infection.
  For example, retinoic acid can promote internalization of the transferrin receptor
  and further limit intracellular iron stores thereby reinforcing the effect of iron
  chelation. Image produced with the aid of Servier Medical Art software (see copyright
