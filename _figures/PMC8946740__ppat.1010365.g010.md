caption: A) The constitutively heightened expression of ARF in B6.C3-Bbaa1 congenic
  mice results in a greater magnitude of IFNβ production and more severe Lyme arthritis
  following infection with B. burgdorferi. B) The heightened expression of the C3H
  allele of ARF blocks the activity of ubiquitin ligase MDM2, resulting in stabilized
  p53. p53 acts to enhance the expression of IRF7 which induces IFNβ production, but
  not downstream ISGs. C) The greater expression of the C3H allele of ARF also binds
  and suppresses BCL6, resulting in increased IRF7 expression and greater production
  of IFNβ. Expression of downstream ISGs is mediated through activation of signal
  transducer and activator transcription 1 (STAT1)-STAT2-IRF9 signaling complex. Parallel
  ARF interactions with p53 and BCL6 modulate IFNβ hyper production in resident myeloid
  cells. IFNβ leads to the upregulation of the muscle regulatory protein myostatin
  in CD45- cells, a previously identified mediator of Lyme arthritis development in
  B6.C3-Bbaa1 mice. (Created with BioRender.com).
