caption: Convergent stem cell regulatory networks control expression of key stem cell
  genes. One classical representative of this transcriptional network is the Zfp42/Rex1
  gene. Expression of the Zfp42/Rex1 gene has long been used as a marker of undifferentiated
  stem cells and is regulated by Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, and by the Wnt pathway. Expression
  of Zfp42/Rex1 is also subject to epigenetic regulation by polycomb complexes and
  DNA methylation (see ).
