caption: Metabolic pathways for the synthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipid  classes
  in S. cerevisiae. PA serves as a precursor to CDP-DAG,  precursor to PI and PS,
  which serves as precursor to PE. PC is synthesized  either via methylation of PE
  or from CDP-choline and DAG via the Kennedy  pathway. DAG, produced by dephosphorylation
  of PA, serves as a precursor to  TAG, as well as PC via the Kennedy pathway. When
  PC is synthesized via the  Kennedy pathway, the 32P label enters via phosphorylation
  of  choline. In contrast, when PC is synthesized via methylation of PE,  32P is
  derived from PA. Metabolites in boxes denote key  intermediaries and/or end products
  that are relevant in the discussion of this  study. Metabolites in ovals are derived
  from PA. The bold  arrows indicate the multiple steps of fatty acid synthesis, and
  the  block arrows indicate the mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of  ergosterol.
  The asterisks indicate the two places where  32P label enters into the pathways
  for the synthesis of the major  phospholipids shown here.
