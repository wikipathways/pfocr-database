caption: Pathway analysis of proteins detected at elevated concentrations during time
  course analysis in lung following intratracheal instillation of 20 μg carbon nanoparticles
  (CNP). At day 7 when PMN levels were 5 times higher compared to baseline and a sudden
  influx of lymphocytes and macrophages was detected, Interleukin-1beta (IL1B), Tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), Factor VII (F7), Interleukin-4 (IL4), Macrophage-derived
  chemokine (MDC/CCL22) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) remained at significantly
  elevated concentrations compared to their baseline levels. The predicted molecular
  network indicates the role of these markers in airway inflammation, recruitment
  of lymphocytes and activation of macrophages. Shown are the extracellular space,
  part of the cell membrane and published interactions are indicated by arrows (line
  thickness represents the number of references).
