caption: A model of amylose/amylopectin biosynthesis pathway. The model is summarized
  based on the previous knowledge and our GWAS analysis. In leaves, sucrose is produced
  from the Calvin cycle by carbon fixation with the activity of mitochondrial NAD‐dependent
  malic enzyme (ME encoded by GRMZM2G085747), phosphoribulokinase (PRK encoded by
  GRMZM2G026024 and GRMZM2G143804) and other enzymes. Then, sucrose is transported
  through phloem to the storage organ of endosperm by sucrose transporter (SUT6 encoded
  by GRMZM2G106741), where it is imported into the cytosolic compartment of each cell.
  In the cytosol, the sucrose synthase (SUS) or invertase (INV encoded by GRMZM2G089836)
  cleaves sucrose into fructose and UDP‐glucose. After glucose 6‐phosphate is transported
  into amyloplasts, phosphoglucomutase (PGM encoded by GRMZM2G173674) catalyses glucose
  6‐phosphate into glucose 1‐phosphate that is activated into ADP‐glucose as the substrate
  for starch synthesis. The content of ADP‐glucose is also negatively regulated by
  Nudix hydrolases (NUDT encoded by GRMZM5G809417 and GRMZM2G069008) that break down
  ADP‐glucose linked to starch biosynthesis. Granule‐bound starch synthase (GBSS encoded
  by GRMZM2G024993) cooperates with other enzymes to catalyse and elongate sugar chains.
  All enzymes encoded by candidate genes found from GWAS are highlighted in red colour.
