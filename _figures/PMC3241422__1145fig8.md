caption: Model for Mpk1-driven FKS2 transcription. (A) Under non-inducing conditions,
  weak transcription initiation is attenuated by association of the Sen1–Nrd1–Nab3
  termination complex to the elongating RNA Pol II. (B) Under inducing conditions,
  Mpk1 and Mlp1 (not shown) are activated in response to phosphorylation by Mkk1/2.
  (C) The active MAPK or pseudokinase binds to Swi4. (D) These dimers are competent
  to bind the FKS2 promoter. (E) Swi6 is recruited to form an Mpk1–Swi4–Swi6 complex
  on the FKS2 promoter. (F) RNA Pol II and the Paf1C are recruited to the promoter
  in a Swi6-dependent manner, completing formation of the initiation complex. (G)
  Mpk1 associates with Paf1, likely by hand off from Swi4. (H) Mpk1 overcomes transcriptional
  attenuation by blocking recruitment of the termination complex. SCB, Swi4-binding
  site.
