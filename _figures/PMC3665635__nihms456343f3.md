caption: Two established mechanisms exist to produce unsaturated fatty acids. The
  E. coli system utilizes a bifunctional dehydratase/isomerase enzyme (FabA), which
  acts specifically on β-C10:0-ACP. The trans-2-C10:1-ACP product of the dehydratase
  reaction can either be reduced by FabI to continue through the saturated fatty acid
  pathway or undergo the FabA-dependent isomerization reaction to generate cis-3-C10:1-ACP.
  FabB is required to elongate this intermediate leading to an unsaturated fatty acid.
  In S. pneumoniae, there is a specific isomerase (FabM) that competes for substrate
  with the FabK enoyl-ACP reductase. A FabF isoform elongates unsaturated fatty acids
  in this organism. Other mechanisms exist, but the mechanistic understanding is limited
  (see section 2.2.3).
