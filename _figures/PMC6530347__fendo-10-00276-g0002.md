caption: Overview of thyroid hormone (TH) production, transport, activity and regulation.
  The thyroid hormone signaling pathway involves a complex interplay between TH synthesis,
  transport, signal transduction, and catabolism. TH is synthesized within the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid
  (HPT) axis where the pituitary is stimulated to release thyroid stimulating hormone
  (TSH) by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. TSH induces
  the production of thyroxine (T4) and, in lesser amounts, triiodothyronine (T3) from
  the thyroid gland. The production of TH self-regulates through a negative feedback
  loop that inhibits further CRF and TSH production. TH travels through the blood
  via transporter proteins to peripheral tissues where it is imported into target
  cells. Here, T4 is converted to T3 through deiodinases (DIO), although T4 can bind
  to receptors as well. Binding of THs to TH nuclear receptors (TR) leads to the activation
  of TH response genes. This change in transcript abundance results in downstream
  proteomic and metabolomic responses that produce the phenotypic changes resulting
  from the TH signal. The TH signal is also regulated within the cell by catabolism
  that includes processes such as sulfation, glucuronidation and deiodination.
