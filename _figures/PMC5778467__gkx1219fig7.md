caption: Biological pathways that engage TDP1 and TDP2. (A) Canonical role in the
  repair of Top I cleavage complexes. DNA damage-induced stalling of Top I leads to
  the formation of a single-strand break with a covalent linkage between the active
  site tyrosine of Top I and the 3′-end of the DNA. Upon Top I proteolysis, TDP1,
  in conjunction with PARP1, resolves the tyrosyl–DNA phosphodiester bond leaving
  a 3′-phosphate which is further processed by PNKP to a 3′-OH. The SSB ends are subsequently
  ligated by LigIIIα in the presence of XRCC1. (B) Stalled Top I complexes can also
  form during the DNA synthesis phase. Collision of these complexes with the approaching
  replication fork can produce one-ended DSBs with a 3′-Top I peptide fragment. These
  breaks are processed by TDP1 in conjunction with PNKP and PARP1 and are then shunted
  to the HR pathway. (C) TDP1 in DSB repair. Radiation and radiomimetic agents produce
  double-strand breaks with modified ends, a significant fraction of which bear 3′-PG
  termini. These DSBs are repaired by the NHEJ machinery. TDP1 can resolve these 3′-PG
  termini which are further processed by PNKP to a 3′-OH. In addition, TDP1 may also
  suppress insertions by mutagenic polymerases during NHEJ. The ends are subsequently
  ligated by XRCC4-LigIV complex in the presence of XLF. The 3′-PG resolution can
  be alternatively carried out by other nucleases such as Artemis. (D) Stalled Top
  II complexes formed due to aberrant Top II activity are repaired by TDP2. Upon Top
  II proteolysis, TDP2 removes the 5′-phosphotyrosyl Top II peptide leaving a 5′-phosphate-ended
  DSB which is a substrate for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair.
