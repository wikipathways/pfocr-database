caption: Many miRNAs have been shown to control the expression of specific SLC transporters
  critical for nutrient uptake or efflux in cells. The SLC transporters fuel multiple
  metabolic pathways, such as aminolyses, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, one
  carbon metabolism, and TCA cycle. Some miRNAs have been identified to directly modulate
  the posttranscriptional gene expression of SLC transporters, which can impact the
  supply and homeostasis of nutrients or metabolic building blocks crucial for cell
  survival and growth. As certain SLC transporters are involved in the influx or efflux
  of xenobiotic drugs or toxins, the significance of the miRNA-controlled regulation
  of such SLCs in xenobiotic disposition and pharmacotherapy remains elusive.
