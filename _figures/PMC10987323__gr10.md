caption: 'Role of mtETC in M2 macrophage polarization. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate reprogramming
  of macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype. During this metabolic reprogramming,
  the TCA cycle remains intact and supplies an ample number of electrons at mtETC,
  particularly at C I and C II. The electrons flow from C I to C IV in a sequential
  manner (known as FET; see abbreviations below), which results in ATP production
  by OXPHOS, and low mtROS production as well. M2 macrophages do not rely on glycolysis
  as long as OXPHOS is intact; these cells express PFKFB1 which efficiently catalyses
  fructose 2,6-BisP to fructose-6-phosphate, eventually reducing the glycolytic rate.
  In addition, the activity of oxidative PPP is also reduced due to enhanced expression
  of CARKL, and the generated products are utilized for nucleotide production and
  UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. UDP-GlcNAc is crucial for N-glycosylation for several cell
  surface proteins in M2 macrophages. Glucose is utilized for UDP-GlcNAc as well.
  Besides glutaminolysis, the synthesis of glutamine is also enhanced via the upregulation
  of glutamine synthetase, and glutamine is crucial for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc.
  M2 macrophages rely on fatty acid oxidation, and CD36 expression level is enhanced
  in M2 macrophages which facilitates increased uptake of fatty acids. CPT1 translocates
  fatty acids from the cytosol in the mitochondria for its oxidation which yields
  Acetyl CoA (shown by broken black arrow) that enters into the TCA cycle. IL-4 and
  IL-13 stimulation triggers PGC-1β and STAT6 phosphorylation that induces expression
  of nuclear receptor PPARγ. PPARγ stimulates the expression of CD36, and PGC-1β co-activates
  STAT6 transcription. Glutaminolysis is enhanced in M2 macrophages which elevates
  the levels of α-ketoglutarate via GLS. M2 macrophages express Arginase 1 that catalyses
  conversion of arginine to L-ornithine and urea. L-ornithine is further metabolized
  by ODC which yields L-proline and polyamines, the latter molecules are crucial for
  tissue repair. The black solid arrows represent the movement of substrates, the
  broken blue arrows represent the activation of enzymatic and signaling pathways
  in M2 macrophages, the broken red line represent the inhibition of the enzymes/pathways
  in M2 macrophages. The abbreviations used are: IL-4R, IL-4 receptor; CD36, cluster
  of differentiation 36; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, PFKFB1, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
