caption: The rationale for the development of DNA damage response inhibitors. For
  chemo- and radiosensitization (left panel), the rationale is that by inhibiting
  repair, DNA damage that would otherwise be repairable and survivable persists, causing
  cell death. For synthetic lethality, the rationale is that there may be two repair
  components, A and B, that complement each other in a kind of functional redundancy.
  Loss of one pathway (A) creates the genomic instability that enables cancer to develop,
  but the cell is now completely reliant on the other component (B) such that inhibition
  of B causes the death of the tumour cell but not the normal cell, which still retains
  repair component A.
