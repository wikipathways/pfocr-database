caption: DEGs in kernels at the 5DAP stage involved in plant hormone signaling pathways.
  a DEGs involved in the auxin signaling pathway. b DEGs involved in the ethylene
  signaling pathway. c DEGs involved in the BR signaling pathway. d DEGs involved
  in the cytokine signaling pathway. All the plants were grown and treated as described
  in Fig. . The kernel on the upper ear from drought stress and control plants was
  collected for RNA sequencing. The absolute values of log2 (drought/control) ≥1 and
  FDR < 0.001 were used as the criteria for DEGs. The color of the box represents
  up (red) and down (green)-regulated genes (drought/normal), and the value in the
  box is the log2 (drought/control) of the genes in the kernel at the 5DAP stage.
  Schematic of the pathways modified according to the KEGG
