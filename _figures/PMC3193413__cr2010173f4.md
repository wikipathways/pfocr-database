caption: Regulation of TPL-2 through IKK-induced p105 proteolysis. TPL-2 is confined
  to a cytoplasmic complex with the NF-κB1 precursor protein p105, and the ubiquitin-binding
  protein ABIN-2. NF-κB1 p105 has multiple functions. First, it serves as a precursor
  molecule for the NF-κB1 p50 subunit, which is generated by limited proteolysis (processing)
  of p105 by the proteasome, which removes p105's C-terminal half . Second, p105 functions
  as a classical IκB (see ), retaining associated NF-κB subunits in the cytoplasm.
  Cellular stimulation with various agonists, such as TLR ligands, IL-1β, TNF and
  CD40L, induces the formation of receptor proximal complexes that trigger activation
  of the MAP3 kinase TAK1 . Activation loop phosphorylation of IKK2 by TAK1, in turn,
  activates IKK2 to phosphorylate the target residues S927 and S932 in p105, creating
  a binding site for the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. K48-linked ubiquitination
  of p105 by SCFβTrCP triggers its complete degradation by the 26S proteasome. IKK-induced
  proteolysis of p105 releases associated NF-κB dimers, which then translocate to
  the nucleus and modulate expression of target genes, similar to activation of NF-κB
  dimers in the classical pathway (see ). Stimulus-induced p105 proteolysis also couples
  activation of NF-κB pathways to MAP kinase signaling by releasing TPL-2 from p105
  inhibition. After liberation from p105, TPL-2 directly phosphorylates MEK and thereby
  activates downstream ERK MAP kinase signaling. Based on immunoblotting of total
  cell lysates, it has been suggested that LPS stimulation results in the selective
  dissociation of M1-TPL-2 from p105 . However, immunoblotting of p105-depleted lysates
  indicates that both M1 and M30 TPL-2 are actually released from p105 after LPS stimulation
  , although the relative contribution of M1 and M30 TPL-2 to MEK phosphorylation
  in LPS-stimulated macrophages is not known. Activation of TPL-2 MEK kinase activity
  additionally requires trans-/autophosphorylation of S400 by an unknown kinase and
  autophosphorylation at T290 in the TPL-2 activation loop. Proteasomal degradation
  of p105 also releases ABIN-2 from association with p105 and TPL-2. The function
  and downstream targets of ABIN-2 are not known.
