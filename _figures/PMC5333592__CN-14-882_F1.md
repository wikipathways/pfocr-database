caption: 'Possible route of central mediation of stress induced signals by NUCB2/nesfatin-1.
  The arrow indicates the direction of signalling between nuclei/areas involved in
  the mediation of stress that all express NUCB2/nesfatin-1. NUCB2/nesfatin-1 has
  been mainly detected in neuronal cell bodies, while no or less expression was observed
  in nerve terminals. Therefore, it is unclear whether it acts as a classical neurotransmitter.
  However, since dendrites and soma can also secrete transmitters [, ], NUCB2/nesfatin-1
  could act in an extracellular manner. Alternatively and/or additionally, direct
  NUCB2/nesfatin-1 connections as recently shown between the dorsal vagal complex
  and the paraventricular nucleus [] may play a role. Lastly, the dotted line indicates
  a possible direct endocrine mediation pathway of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 by crossing the
  blood-brain barrier which has been observed before [, ]. Abbreviations: Amy, amygdala;
  DMV, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; EW, Edinger-Westphal nucleus; LHA,
  lateral hypothalamic area; LC, locus coeruleus; NTS, nucleus of the solitary tract;
  PVN, paraventricular nucleus; rRPa, rostral raphe pallidus; SON, supraoptic nucleus;
  VLM, ventrolateral medulla.'
