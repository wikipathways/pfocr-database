caption: 'SCHOOL model of T-cell receptor signaling. A schematic representation of
  the SCHOOL-based molecular mechanisms of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) are shown as gray rectangles. TCR-CD3-ζ
  components are represented as whole polypeptides and as a simplified axial view.
  All interchain interactions in intermediate complexes are shown by dotted arrows
  reflecting their transition state. Circular arrow indicates ligand-induced receptor
  reorientation. Interaction with multivalent ligand (not shown) clusters the receptors
  and pushes them to reorientate (I) and bring signaling subunits into a correct relative
  orientation and in sufficient proximity in the formed receptor oligomer (for illustrative
  purposes, receptor dimer is shown), thus starting the trans-homointeractions between
  ζ molecules (II). Then, two alternative pathways can take a place depending on the
  nature of activating stimuli. First is going through a stage IV resulting in formation
  of ζ2 dimer (dimer of dimers) and phosphorylation of the ζ ITAM tyrosines, thus
  triggering downstream signaling events. Then, the signaling ζ oligomers formed subsequently
  dissociate from the TCR-CD3 complex, resulting in internalization of the remaining
  engaged TCR-CD3 complexes (VII). This pathway leads to partial (or incomplete) T
  cell activation. Alternatively, the intermediate complex formed at the stage II
  can undergo further rearrangements, starting trans-homointeractions between CD3
  proteins (III) and resulting in formation of an oligomeric intermediate. Again,
  the stages I, II and III can be reversible or irreversible depending on interreceptor
  proximity and relative orientation of the receptors in TCR dimers/oligomers as well
  as on time duration of the TCR-ligand contact and lifetime of the receptor in TCR
  dimers/oligomers that generally correlate with the nature of the stimulus and its
  specificity and affinity/avidity. Next, in the signaling oligomers formed (III),
  the ITAM tyrosines undergo phosphorylation by PTKs that leads to generation of the
  activation signal, dissociation of signaling oligomers and internalization of the
  remaining engaged TCRαβ chains (VIII, XI). This pathway provides at least two different
  activation signals from the ζ and CD3 signaling oligomers (signals A and B), respectively,
  and results in full T-cell activation. The distinct signaling through ζ and CD3
  oligomers (or through various combinations of signaling chains in CD3 oligomeric
  structures) might be also responsible for distinct functions such as T-cell proliferation,
  effector functions, T-cell survival, pathogen clearance, TCR anergy, etc. In addition,
  the signaling oligomers formed can sequentially interact with the signaling subunits
  of nonengaged TCRs resulting in formation of higher-order signaling oligomers, thus
  amplifying and propagating the activation signal (not shown). Also, this leads to
  the release and subsequent internalization of the remaining nonengaged TCR complexes
  and/or TCRαβ chains (not shown). Abbreviations: PTK, protein tyrosine kinase. Phosphate
  groups are shown as filled gray circles.'
