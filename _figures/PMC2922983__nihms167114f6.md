caption: 'This diagram represents possible feedback-loop mechanisms of p53 modulation
  by GAPDH and the NAD+-dependant protein deacetylase, Sirt-1. Upon binding the GAPDH-NAD+
  complex, Sirt-1 undergoes a conformational change that enables it to bind and remove
  acetyl groups (−OCH3) from C-terminal Lys residues of p53, inactivating it. Inactivated
  p53 is unable to induce apoptotic processes; thus, this pathway could lead to cell
  survival (path shown in blue). At present, the nature of the interaction between
  Sirt-1 and GAPDH unknown; therefore in this diagram, two possibilities are indicated:
  I, indicates formation of a GAPDH-NAD+-Sirt-1 complex (A), while II, indicates NAD+
  transfer from GAPDH, leading to NAD+-Sirt-1 complex formation (B). In either case,
  the NAD+-Sirt-1 interaction likely changes the conformation of Sirt-1 (C and D),
  which may further facilitate Sirt-1 interaction with p53 to form complexes E and/or
  F. Additionaly, oxidative stress in AD causes GAPDH to undergo intermolecular disulfide
  bonding, inhibiting its activity and ability to bind NAD+, as well as further hindering
  Sirt-1-induced inactivation of pro-apoptotic p53 (path shown in red).'
