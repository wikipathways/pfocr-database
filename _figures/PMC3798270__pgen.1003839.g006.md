caption: Pathway diagram depicting ArcA-repressed carbon oxidation pathways that would
  function during aerobic respiration. The genes encoding each pathway enzyme or transporter
  are represented by a box with two circles. ChIP-seq/ChIP-chip (first circle) and
  gene expression profiling data (second circle) were mapped using ProMeTra  with
  the colors described in the legend. Pink asterisks indicate novel directly regulated
  operons while reducing equivalents produced by ArcA repressed pathways are colored
  red (NADH), blue (FADH2), pink (QH2), black (NADPH) or green (PQQH). Not all pathway
  connections were included in order to improve clarity. Some operons encoding membrane-bound
  enzymes are depicted in the cytoplasm for clarity (black asterisks; e.g., sdh).
  Pathway information was obtained from EcoCyc .
