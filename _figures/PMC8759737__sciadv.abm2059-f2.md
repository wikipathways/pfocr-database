caption: Schematic diagrams of the networks and cell cycles of a wild-type cell, a
  cancer cell, and a mutant embryonic brain cell. Constitutive potent activation of
  the proteins is via single or combination of mutations (red circle and explosion
  shape). Mutations in proteins associated with the transcription machinery and chromatin
  remodeling can lead to high expression levels of these (red circle) proteins in
  the type-specific cell. The level of expression of the protein, coupled with the
  potency of activation by the mutations, results in a large number of active molecules,
  leading to cancer or neurodevelopmental disorder phenotypes, respectively. The time
  window—germline (in neurodevelopmental disorders) or somatic (in cancer)—of the
  mutation and cell type (embryonic brain cell or dedifferentiated cell) distinguish
  between them. In addition, the expression levels of the nodes in the pathway that
  the signal flows through, controlled by the chromatin remodeling proteins, should
  not be low to permit the signal to transmit. In cancer, the resulting hyperactivated
  signaling can lead to OIS. In development, they can lead to premature senescence.
  In embryonic cells, cell cycle arrest due to the premature senescence alters phenotypic
  traits toward the developmental disorders, including RASopathies. Germline embryonic
  neurodevelopmental disorder mutations can increase the risk of cancer by coupling
  with emerging somatic mutations. G1, S, G2, and M are stages in the cell cycle.
  In both cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, signaling levels are critical in
  determining the disease consequences, and these levels are the outcome of (i) mutation
  strengths, (ii) expression levels, (iii) cell type, and (iv) timing window.
