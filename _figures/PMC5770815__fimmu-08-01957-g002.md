caption: Kynurenic acid (KYNA)-mediated pathways of inflammatory signaling. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines induce the expression of indolamine (IDO) enzyme via STAT, AP1, IRF1,
  and NF-κB transcription factor activation. KYNA is formed by the IDO-dependent canonical
  pathway or by an alternative route through direct kynurenine (KYN) or tryptophan
  (TRP) transformation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, KYNA as
  a free radical scavenger decreases ROS level. KYNA binds and activates G-protein-coupled
  receptor 35 (GPR35)-reducing cAMP and calcium (Ca2+) levels in cells. Activation
  of GPR35 by KYNA may also inhibit phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), as
  well as increasing the level of β-catenin. All of these cellular responses probably
  decrease activation of relevant inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-κB
  and AP1. Therefore, reduced induction of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF), high-mobility
  group box 1 (HMBG1), interleukin 4 (IL4), α defensin (α-Def), and inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS) have frequently been observed in response to KYNA treatment.
  Recruitment of arrestin β2 (ARRB2) to GPR35 is necessary for internalization and
  desensitization of the KYNA-activated receptor. Binding of KYNA to the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) receptor leads to recruitment of the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT)
  and induction of IL6 expression. Interaction of the KYNA–AhR complex with NF-κB
  may also be involved in the induction of IL6. Furthermore, ligand-activated AhR
  initiates the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src activation and, thereby,
  the phosphorylation (P) of IDO. Phosphorylated IDO induces the expression of transforming
  growth factor β1 (TGFβ). NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; AP1, activator protein 1; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;

  description: Kynurenic acid (KYNA)-mediated pathways of inflammatory signaling.
