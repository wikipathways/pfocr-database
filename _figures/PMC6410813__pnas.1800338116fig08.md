caption: Model describing regulation of primary cilia length by the FGF–ICK pathway.
  (A) Under basal conditions, endogenous FGF signaling restricts ICK activity to the
  level required for optimal length of the cilia. (B) Experimental up-regulation of
  ICK activity, by increased expression of active ICK, shortens the primary cilia
  (, , ). Similar effect is achieved in cells with abolished FGF signaling, which
  are unable to inhibit ICK, leading to up-regulation of ICK kinase activity and ciliary
  shortening (, ). (C) Down-regulation of ICK activity, either by transient increase
  in activity of FGF signaling, or by small chemicals, expression of kinase-inactive
  ICK mutants (*), Ick knockout or knockdown, extends primary cilia (, , , , , ).
  (D) Under certain conditions, inactivation of ICK results in profound dysregulation
  of primary cilia (cilia disaster), manifested by low cilia stability and extreme
  length variability (, ). A similar phenotype is achieved by strong activation of
  FGF signaling via disease-associated FGFR3 mutations (*) (, ), suggesting that the
  strength of the FGF stimulus regulates optimal ciliary length through ICK.
