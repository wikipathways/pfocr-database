caption: Visualization of 2 representative trees with the maximum and minimum nodes
  generated by random forest. The tree with maximum nodes used SPDEF gene expression
  value as the root node and the expression of other 9 genes as internal nodes, making
  the total nodes number to be 21. It was a 2-class split for each root and internal
  node which was determined by the gene expression value of the specific gene in the
  node. The cutoff value for the binary split in each node was calculated automatically
  (A). The tree with minimum nodes used the expression of the RUNX2 gene as the single
  root and internal node, generating 2 leaf nodes.
