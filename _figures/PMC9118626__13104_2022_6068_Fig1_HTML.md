caption: Pathway to lysergic acid amides. Enzymes demonstrated (or hypothesized, in
  the case of EasP) to have roles are indicated at relevant steps. LAH, lysergic acid
  α-hydroxyethylamide; red, reduction by reductase domain of Lps3; R, to Lps3 via
  pantetheine. Dashed arrows indicate hypothesized steps, with those involving EasP
  shown in gray
