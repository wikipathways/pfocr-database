caption: Metabolic pathway and schematic diagram of 5-ALA synthesis from glucose to
  TCA cycle. Genes shown in red were downregulated using the CRISPRi system, while
  metabolites represented in yellow were analyzed by HPLC. Two important plasmids
  for expression of RchemA with GroESL and Glk-GalP were harboring in the genetic
  MR-1
