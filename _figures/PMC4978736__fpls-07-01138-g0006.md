caption: 'Omics and C4pathway analysis of two subtypes distinguished according to
  the decarboxylating enzyme in mature and immature tissues. (A) NADP-ME, NADP requiring
  malic enzyme. (B) NAD-ME, NAD requiring malic enzyme. Gene expression and proteomics
  data are provided as log2FC but for clarity of the figure only provided if either
  proteome or transcriptome changed by more than logFC of 0.5. Metabolite data is
  provided as concentration fold change. Omics data are highlighted in green, red,
  and yellow. Green: Increase in gene expression, protein accumulation, or in metabolite
  concentration in mature tissues compared to immature tissues. Red: Decrease in gene
  expression, in protein accumulation, or in metabolite concentration in mature tissues
  compared to immature tissues. Yellow: Up and down regulation of genes/enzymes that
  characterize isoforms in different tissues and organelles. Gray: no statistically
  significant difference between tissues. Numbers refer to enzymes. (1) PEP carboxylase,
  (2) NADP-malate dehydrogenase, (3) NADP-malic enzyme, (4) Pyruvate-Pi dikinase,
  (5) Rubisco (carboxylation), (6) glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, (7) alpha
  /beta amylase, (8) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase),
  (9) fatty acid synthases (saturated fatty acids), (10) aspartate aminotrasferase,
  (11) NAD-malate dehydrogenase, (12) NAD-malic enzyme, (13) alanine amino transferase.
  Some steps were omitted for the sake of simplicity.'
