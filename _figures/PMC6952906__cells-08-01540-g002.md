caption: 'Schemes of feedforward loops (FFLs). Lines ending with an arrow indicate
  activation, whereas T ending lines indicate repression. Simple straight lines indicate
  that the interaction can either be activatory or repressive. (a) On the left, the
  general scheme of an FFL is represented. The master regulator gene A regulates gene
  C both directly (left path) and indirectly (right path) through the direct regulation
  of gene C. The central and right schemes synthesize all possible miRNA mediated
  FFLs: the miRNA can either play the role of a master regulator or standing in the
  intermediate regulator position. (b–d) Coherent miRNA mediated feedforward loops
  (cFFLs): regulatory paths make an overall positive sign. In (b) and (c), the TF
  plays the role of the master regulator, while in (d), such a role is assumed by
  the miRNA. (e,f) Incoherent miRNA mediated feed-forward loops (iFFLs): regulatory
  paths make an overall negative sign. In (e), the TF acts as the master regulator
  by activating both the miRNA and the target; in (f), the master regulator is the
  miRNA that represses both its targets. One of the targets then represses the other
  one. (g–j) Experimental examples of miRNA mediated cFFLs. (g) Two FFLs regulating
  the “all-or-none” expression of two groups of type 1 specific genes in human epithelial

  upregulates SCAMP3. Adipogenesis has been found to be positively regulated by PPARG
  (grey arrow) and negatively regulated by PPARG (T-ended grey line). Adapted from
