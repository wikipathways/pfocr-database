caption: Canonical Wnt signaling pathway (reproduced with permission from[]). the
  WNT pathway consist of two states, one referred to as “off” state where the small
  lipid modified Wnt protein does not bind to frizzled receptors (A), the other refereed
  as to “on state” when Wnt binds to frizzled (B). In the off state a large destruction
  complex is formed by the APC, Axin and GSk3β proteins. This complex binds to free
  β-catenin, phosphorylates it, thus triggering its degradation and preventing it
  from entering the nucleus. In the on-state dishevelled is activated, inhibits the
  formation of the destruction complex and leads to an abundance of cytoplasmic β-catenin,
  some of which enters the nucleus, binds with TCF, leading to cell proliferation.
