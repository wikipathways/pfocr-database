  of KAT-II catalyzed transformation of kynurenine to kynurenic acid. IDO = indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase,
  TDO = tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, KMO = kynurenine-3-monooxygenase, KAT = kynurenine
  aminotransferase, NMDAR = N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, KYN = kynurenine, KYNA
  = kynurenic acid, 3-HK = 3-hydroxykynurenine, QUIN = quinolinic acid, PLP = pyridoxal-5′-phosphate.
