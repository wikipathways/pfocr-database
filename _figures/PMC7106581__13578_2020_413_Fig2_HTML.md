caption: Graphic summary of physiological activities of Fndc5/Irisin that are elicited
  through pathways other than MAP-kinase signaling. Alternative signaling pathways
  that transmit the effects of Fndc5/Irisin are AMP-kinase, STAT3 and the TLR4 pathways.
  These pathways are involved in a set of cellular functions responsible for proliferation,
  anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory activities. Irisin improves cardiac hypertrophy
  by inducing protective autophagy via mTOR independent activation of AMPK-ULK1 and
  AMPK- mTOR pathways. On the other hand, Irisin has an antidepressant-like effect
  in hippocampus. Of note that, Irisin lowers blood pressure via the AMPK-Akt-eNOS-NO
  pathway in endothelial cells. Anti-inflammatory properties of irisin are connected
  to TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway activation in macrophages. For detailed information
