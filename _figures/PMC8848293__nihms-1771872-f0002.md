caption: 'Activation of the endoplasmic reticulum UPR (UPRER) in C. elegans. There
  are three transducers of the UPRER on the ER membrane: IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 (; ;
  ). These are activated by the accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins (A) or
  by membrane lipid perturbation (B). (C—D) Once the UPR is activated by lipid perturbation
  or unfolded protein, the IRE-1 branch regulates downstream genes through the JNK
  pathway, the IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA, and the spliced XBP-1. Spliced XBP-1
  functions as a transcription factor. The PEK-1 branch regulates downstream genes
  via the transcription factor ATF-4. The ATF-6 branch regulates downstream genes
  through the cleaved N-term of ATF-6. (E) The downstream UPR genes include apoptosis,
  autophagy, and lipid metabolism pathways’ genes. Specific response genes are transcribed
  based on whether the UPR is activated by protein or lipid stress (; ; ). Activation
  of spliced xbp-1 in the CEPsh glia or neurons extends lifespan in C. elegans (;
