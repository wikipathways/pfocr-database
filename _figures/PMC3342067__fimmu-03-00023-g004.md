caption: CD44 potentiates T cell activation, expansion, contraction, and maintenance
  of memory cells. Besides playing a pivotal role during recruitment, CD44 ligation
  affects T cell memory function by augmenting activation (A), ensuring survival (B),
  and regulating homeostasis (C) to facilitate maximum expansion following challenge
  (D). Following recognition of Ag via TCR, CD44 affinity and expression are upregulated
  and it localizes with the TCR signaling complex in the immunological synapse where
  it receives signals from HA presented by CD44 expressed on DCs (panel 1). CD44 ligation
  contributes to and enhances signal transduction in the context of TCR engagement
  by increasing the availability of Lck for downstream engagement of ZAP-70, which
  transmits the signals necessary for T cell activation. Signaling events in the primary
  response to infections can profoundly affect the generation and maintenance of T
  cell memory (panel 2). HA binding to CD44 can induce a survival signal via the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, which may inhibit apoptosis during contraction by interfering with cell
  death either through direct obstruction of Fas to prevent DISC assembly and caspase
  8 activation or by affecting Fas signaling itself. Although differences in the capacity
  of LMW versus HMW HA to elicit CD44-mediated signaling in T cells has not been carefully
  investigated, recent studies suggest that HMW (red bar), but not LMW (green bar),
  HA (A–D) can upregulate the transcription factor FoxP3 in Tregs cells via CD44 signaling
  (panel 3). CD44-regulated FoxP3 expression was linked to a greater capacity for
  IL-10 production and the development of surface TGF-β1 expression, which are important
  for their regulatory function. We hypothesize that effector T cells are more likely
  to respond to LMW HA generated during inflammation. Furthermore, during homeostasis,
  we envision that HA binding by CD44 elicits enhanced survival due to engagement
  of Lck (panel 4). CD44 signaling may increase the responsiveness of IL-7Rα by making
  more Lck available leading to IL-7-mediated upregulation of Bcl-2 via Stat5 signaling.
  Thus, CD44 could have a global function in regulating the transition of effector
  cells to memory cells, as well as in maintaining memory T cells that exceeds its
  roles in migration and motility.
