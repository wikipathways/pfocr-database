caption: A glance of tumor microenvironment regulated by NF-κB. NF-κB modulates the
  dynamic state of the tumor microenvironment through its effects on various cells,
  including immune cells and myeloid cells, among others. In NK cells, the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway upregulates the expression of perforin and granzyme, crucial
  for inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. MDSCs are influenced by c-Rel-mediated
  IL-1 signaling, which suppresses T-cell-mediated responses and contributes to immune
  evasion. Furthermore, p50 or IKKβ drives TAMs towards a tumor-promoting M2 phenotype.
  In constrast, CyH enhance phenotype of M1 macrophages by activation of JNK/p65 signaling
  axis. The deletion of the NF-κB subunit c-Rel significantly reduces the generation
  and maintenance of activated regulatory T cells (aTregs), highlighting its essential
  role in immunosuppression. NF-κB(p65) also stimulates cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) to enhance macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and tumor growth via
  chemokines—a process that contrasts with the effects of IKKβ inhibition. IKKβ deficiency
  in CAFs promotes intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, inhibits tumor cell apoptosis,
  increases CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell accumulation, and promote colonic tumor growth.
  Additionally, NF-κB promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inducing
  the transcription of factors like MMP-9,Twist and Snail, further illustrating its
  pivotal role in tumor progression and metastasis. CTCs, Circulating Tumor Cells;
