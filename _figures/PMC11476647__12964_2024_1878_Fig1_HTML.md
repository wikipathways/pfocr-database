caption: Schematic representation of the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE signaling pathway. (A) During
  normal homeostasis, Nrf2 binds to Keap1 by DLG (low affinity) and ETGE (high affinity)
  motifs forming a homodimer, and activates Cul3-mediated ubiquitination in the lysine-rich
  region followed by proteasomal degradation. Under oxidative stress or xenobiotic
  exposure disulfide bonds form within Keap1, modifying IVR conformation and disrupting
  Kelch-DLG/ETGE binding. In absence of ubiquitination, increased amount of Nrf2 protein
  accumulates and translocates into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, Nrf2 forms a
  heterodimer with sMaf protein and subsequently binds to ARE, to trigger the transcription
  of downstream genes. ARE-regulated mRNA transcripts are translated with SelCys tRNA,
  which is directly regulated by Brf2 activity. Oxidative stress inhibits Brf2 from
  producing SeCys tRNA, functionally providing negative feedback on oxidative-induced
  antioxidant responses. (B) Healthy cells and cancer stem cells act differently when
  exposed to high and low levels of Nrf2 agonism. At low doses of xenobiotic exposure,
  Nrf2 stimulation increases cytoprotection/neuroprotection in healthy cells and enhances
  chemoresistance in cancer cells. High-dose xenobiotic exposure or ROS burden in
  healthy cells inhibits Brf2 activity, allowing for cytotoxicity and regulated cell
  death. In cancer cells high-dose xenobiotic exposure enhances chemoresistance due
  to cancer-specific Brf2-overexpression. Nrf2 antagonism in both health/cancerous
  tissue increases oxidative burden, enhancing apoptosis/ferroptosis. In cancerous
  cells Nrf2 antagonism helps regain chemosensitivity, inhibiting cancer-specific
  mechanisms which suppress chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. (C) Regulation of Nrf2-associated
  activities with regard to cancer. Epigenetic alterations lead to transcriptional
  enhancements in Nrf2 levels. Methylation of Keap1 transcriptionally reduces Keap1
  levels. Exon skipping of Nrf2 and somatic mutations in either of Nrf2, Keap1, and
  Cul3 disrupt Nrf2/Keap1 interactions. Modifications in Keap1 cysteine-residues and
  Keap1‐ competing protein e.g. p62 lead to the reduced binding affinity between Nrf2‐Keap1,
  and antagonize ubiquitination of Nrf2. Downstream activities of Nrf2 cascade include
  maintenance and/or regulation of cellular redox homeostasis, apoptosis, and autophagy.
  Generation of NADPH, and pentose synthesis is controlled by Nrf2 downstream genes.
  Products of lipid metabolism serve as important biomarkers regarding cancer progression.
  In addition, Nrf2 promotes expression of genes involved in drug metabolism, thus
  playing vital role in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. ARE, antioxidant responsive
