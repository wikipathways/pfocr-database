caption: Alzheimer’s disease pathway and enriched gene ontology with Down-regulated
  genes. Among 10 significant pathways of Down-regulated meta-analysis genes, Alzheimer’s
  disease pathway and enriched gene ontology with other top significant pathways in
  this study have been visualized in CluGO software (kappa score = 0.4). It demonstrated
  the genes that are common among Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s
  disease; also, the genes that are only involved in Alzheimer’s disease and other
  significant pathways.
