caption: In the cytoplasm, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC has been proposed to regulate mRNA stability,
  loading in the polysome, and protein translation, putatively by interacting with
  distinct mRNA sequences (; ). Cytoplasmic AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC also serves as a component
  of RISC by interacting with SND1 (; ). AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC augments the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway to inhibit FOXO1 and FOXO3a-mediated apoptosis (; ). Protective autophagy
  is induced via increased activation of AMPK and ATG-5 (). In the nucleus, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
  interacts with PLZF and releases suppression of target genes, including c-myc ().
  In a feedback loop, c-myc increases transcription of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC and suppress
  expression of microRNAs (). Increased AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC expression stabilizes the
  p50/p65 complex of NFκB(), inducing complex translocation to the nucleus. Downstream
  genes, including ALDH3A1, MET, LSF, DPYD and MDR1, are up-regulated by AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
  and thus mediate chemoresistance. Dotted lines indicate pathways yet to be fully
  characterized.
