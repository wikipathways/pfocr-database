caption: In alveolar general capillary endothelial (gCap) cells, IGFBP7 prevents FBXW2-dependent
  ubiquitination and degradation of NF-κB1/2. The NF-κB signaling pathway activation
  by endotoxin (LPS) promotes cytokine and chemokine production and release from gCap
  cells that attract and stimulate neutrophil (Clec4nhi) proinflammatory activation
  and extravasation. Collectively, these events lead to microvasculature barrier dysfunction
  and edema. Graphical abstract was prepared using Biorender software. ALI = acute
  lung injury; IGFBP7 = insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7
