caption: 'The role of Smac mimetics in the regulation of TNF-α dynamics and the promotion
  of apoptosis. The inhibition of cIAPs alters NF-κB pathways. The classical NF-κB
  pathway is pushed towards caspase-8 dependent apoptosis through the formation of
  RIPK-FADD-Caspase-8 complex and it is fed by the production of TNF-α in the alternative
  pathway. Abbreviations: TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α), TNFR (Tumor Necrosis Factor
  Receptor), cIAP (cellular- Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein), RIPK (Receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase), FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain),
  TRAF (TNF receptor associated factor), NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), NF-κB (nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells).'
