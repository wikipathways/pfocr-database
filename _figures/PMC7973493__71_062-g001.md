caption: 'Involvement of plasma membrane-localized nitrate/ammonium/phosphate transporters
  in modulation of root traits, and the regulatory pathway of the phosphate transporter
  genes of the Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) family. A–B: Transporters in Arabidopsis
  (Arabidopsis thaliana) (A) and rice (Oryza sativa) (B) involved in modulation of
  root traits in response to different external nitrate, ammonium or phosphate regimes.
  The plus (red) and minus (green) symbols denote a positive and a negative role,
  respectively, of the transporter on root traits. The plus symbols followed by ‘Ox’
  (+Ox) indicate that the altered root traits result from overexpression of the transporter,
  and that the corresponding phenotypes has not been observed in mutants (no phenotype
  or not studied). PR: primary root; CR: crown root; LR: lateral root; RH: root hair.
  C: A simplified signaling cascade conserved in plants involving several regulatory
  genes monitoring PHT1 abundance. PHRs/PHLs: Phosphate Starvation Response/PHR-Like
  transcription factors; miR399s: microRNA399s; PHO2: Phosphate 2, a ubiquitin E2
  conjugase. Dashed line indicates that regulatory genes upstream of PHR/PHLs are
  not included. Red line: transcriptional regulation; blue line: post-transcriptional
  regulation; green line: post-translational regulation.'
