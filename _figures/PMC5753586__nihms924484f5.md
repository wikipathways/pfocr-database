caption: Under physiological conditions, non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling
  mediates the survival and homeostasis of B cells, the generation and effector function
  of T helper 17 (TH17) cells, the differentiation of osteoclasts from monocytes,
  chemokine production in endothelial cells, and glucagon responses in hepatocytes,,,,,,,.
  These cellular events become pathogenic in situations in which the non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway is aberrantly activated owing to the uncontrolled production of its
  inducing agents or genetic deficiencies in its negative regulators. Aberrant B cell
  survival renders self-reactive B cells resistant to negative selection, contributing
  to the accumulation of autoantibodies associated with inflammatory diseases. Autoimmune
  TH17 cells mediate inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues.
  Excessive and chronic production of chemokines by endothelial cells promotes the
  recruitment of inflammatory cells and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures
  in tissue-specific inflammation,. Aberrant osteoclast generation is a pathological
  mechanism of inflammatory bone loss, and aberrant glucagon responses are associated
  with metabolic diseases,. BAFF, B cell activating factor; CD40L, CD40 ligand; CREB1,
