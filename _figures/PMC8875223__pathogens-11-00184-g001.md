caption: Immunometabolism in innate immune cells. (A) Challenging innate immune cells
  with either exogenous (LPS, β-glucan) or endogenous (IL-4) stimuli leads to metabolic
  reprogramming, which involves changes in pathways as glycolysis, FAO/FAS, OxPhos,
  etc. These shifts in metabolism provide cells with energy and building blocks to
  develop their functions. (B) Metabolic enzymes regulate immune responses at many
  levels, including their moonlighting functions. They can act as transcription/translation
  facilitators (ENO1, PKM2, GAPDH, LDH), immune receptors or activators (HK) or facilitators
  of immune cell migration (ENO1). bNAG, bacterial N-acetylglucosamine; ECM, extracellular
  matrix; ENO1, enolase 1; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; GAPDH,
