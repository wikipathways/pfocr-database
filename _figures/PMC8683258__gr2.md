caption: Factors involved in formation of RAD-51 presynaptic filament.BRC-1 — BRCA1
  homolog. BRD-1 — BARD1 homolog. Both proteins act in upstream signalling pathway
  and/or possibly downstream to promote RAD-51 loading/stabilization. BRC-2 — BRCA2
  homolog acts possibly in conjunction with DSS-1 to recruit and nucleate RAD-51 clusters
  to ssDNA and promote replication protein A (RPA) displacement. These clusters are
  stabilized via TR2 domain of BRC-2. The growth of RAD-51 filament from initial nucleating
  events helps to form nascent filaments. These are bound and stabilized by RFS-1/RIP-1/SWS-1
  (RAD-51 paralog-Shu) complex. ATPase activity of RFS-1 allows the complex to dissociate
  to allow iterative cycles of stabilization and growth. This ‘proof-reads’ RAD-51
  into long filaments capable of searching for homologous sequence within sister chromatid
  and subsequent strand invasion to form displacement loop (D-loop). Domains found
  within each protein are shown. OB — oligosaccharide binding domain. Wh — winged-helix
  domain. NLS — nuclear localization signal. RING — really interesting new gene. BRCT
  — BRCA1 C terminus. Size of each polypeptide is indicated in aa.
