caption: (A) Notch receptors have an extracellular domain composed of reiterated Epidermal
  Growth Factor (EGF)-like repeats and a conserved negative regulatory region (NRR)
  consisting of Lin12/Notch repeats (LNRs) and a heterodimerization (HD) domain. The
  intracellular portion of Notch contains repeated ankyrin (ANK) repeats, nuclear
  localization signals (NLS) and a PEST domain that controls receptor half life. Vertebrate
  Notch undergoes S1 cleavage within the secretory pathway to generate the heterodimeric
  receptor that is found on the cell surface. (B) Notch is activated by binding to
  ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) family. The ligands are ubiquitinated (green
  circle) and internalized into signal sending cells before and/or after receptor
  activation. Activated Notch undergoes sequential cleavage, initially at the S2 site
  by members of the ADAM family of metalloproteases (blue ball), and then at the S3
  and S4 sites by γ-secretase (orange circle). S2 cleavage occurs at the cell surface
  and releases the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) from the heterodimer. γ-secretase
  mediated cleavages take place on the plasma membrane and/or in endosomes. These
  cleavages release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the
  nucleus where it interacts with members of the CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) family of
  transcription factors, and recruits co-activators (CoA) to activate transcription
  of Notch target genes. NICD signaling is terminated by lysosomal degradation.
