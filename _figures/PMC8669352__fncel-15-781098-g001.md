caption: Sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway involved in ischemic stroke.
  (A) Schematic outline of S1P metabolism. (B) S1P signaling in post-ischemic brain
  inflammation. Sphk1 level is elevated in microglia and S1P production is enhanced
  in activated microglia. S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 influence microglial activation.
  Astrocytes interact extensively with microglia. S1P can activate astrocytes while
  S1PR3 is known to promote astrogliosis in ischemic brain. (C) S1P and recruitment
  of peripheral lymphocytes. Functional antagonist of S1PR1 can induce receptor internalization
  and degradation and thereby inhibits peripheral lymphocytes’ recruitment. (D) S1P
  signaling in sustaining endothelial functions. S1P-S1PR1-nitric oxide regulates
  vessel dilation to flow. S1PR1 distributes to the abluminal surface of the endothelial
  cells. Either cell-autonomous S1P or system S1P/analog which penetrates the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) can activate endothelial S1PR1 and sustains endothelial function.
  (E) S1P inhibits the function of P-glycoprotein at the BBB. Brain endothelial S1PR1
  may help maintain BBB function by sustaining a proper distribution of tight junction
  proteins. Endothelial S1PR1 may participate in regulating vesicular transport in
  the early phase of BBB opening after ischemic stroke. (F) S1P is a chemoattractant
  for neural progenitor cells (NPC) toward the infarcted area thus facilitating neurogenesis.
