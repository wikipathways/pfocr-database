caption: An overview of the modulation of autophagy. The initiation of autophagy is
  controlled by the ULK1 kinase complex that integrates stress signals from mTORC1
  and AMPK. When mTORC1 kinase activity is inhibited, ULK1 is activated and binding
  with multiple ATG proteins like ATG101, ATG13, and FIP200 to engage the formation
  of phagophore. Then, the ULK1 complex activates the autophagosome formation by the
  phosphorylation of VPS34 and Beclin-1, which forms a PI3K-III complex. Beclin 1
  interacts with factors (Ambra1, Bif-1, UVRAG, and ATG14L) that modulate its binding
  to VPS34 whose lipid kinase activity is essential for autophagy. Cellular concentrations
  of the initiation complex are also under the control of an ubiquitination cascade
  regulated by the deubiquitination peptidases USP10 and USP13. In addition, the LC3
  system is required for autophagosome transport and maturation. In the autophagosome
  maturation, pro-LC3 could be cleaved by ATG4B with assistance of ATG3 and ATG7 as
  well as ATG5, ATG12, and ATG16. Mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to degrade
  their cargo, and recycle essential biomolecules. Some small-molecule compounds can
  suppress autophagy by targeting early or late stages in the pathway.
