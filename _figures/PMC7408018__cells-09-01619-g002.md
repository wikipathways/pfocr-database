caption: 'Diagram of the ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways triggering
  autophagy. ER stress can activate autophagy through three different UPR branches:
  EIF2AK3/PERK, ERN/IRE1 and/or the ATF6 signaling pathway. EIF2AK3/PERK induces autophagy
  by activating the ATG16L1 complex through ATF4 or by inducing DDIT3/CHOP expression,
  which indirectly causes BECN1 dissociation from BCL2. ERN/IRE1, through MAPK/JNK,
  mediates the phosphorylation of BCL2, which causes its dissociation from BECN1.
  The XBP1 branch enhances the formation of LC3-II. The ATF6 pathway also induces
  autophagy by inhibiting phosphorylation at the AKT-MTOR pathway. Abbreviations:
  AKT/PKB, AKT serine-threonine kinase; ATF4/6, activating transcription factor 4/6;
  DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153, DNA damage inducible transcript 3; EIF2AK3/PERK, eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3; ERN/IRE1, endoplasmic reticulum
  to nucleus signaling 1; MAPK/JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase and XBP1, X-box
  binding protein 1.'
