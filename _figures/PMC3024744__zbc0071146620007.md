caption: Model of sPLA2-IIA function in FLS AA metabolism. Unstimulated cells, AA
  is mobilized in microparticles esterified to phospholipids. Low level AA release
  is mediated by cPLA2-α and is reincorporated into phospholipid pools by acylase(s).
  AA flux to PGE2 is very low and is via COX-1. TNF-stimulated cells, TNF. cPLA2-α
  is activated (⊕) and COX-2 expression is induced (↑ in circle), stimulating AA flux
  through the COX-2 pathway to stimulate PGE2 production. TNF + sPLA2-IIA, sPLA2-IIA
  enzyme activity increases AA mobilization that is not coupled to PGE2 production.
  sPLA2-IIA-mediated signaling superinduces COX-2 (↑↑ in circle) resulting in increased
  cPLA2-α-dependent AA flux through COX-2 to PGE2. sPLA2-IIA alone increases AA release
  and induces COX-2 without increasing PGE2 production. The figure is modeled after
  Fitzpatrick and Soberman ().
