caption: The bioactive nanoparticles HZCO activate the apoptotic signaling pathway
  while concurrently disrupting zinc homeostasis within tumor cells. This disruption
  sets off a domino effect of cellular death processes, culminating in PANoptosis.
  HZCO-induced PANoptosis not only eliminates tumor cells with high efficiency but
  also alters the immune profile of cold tumors, effectively converting them into
  hot tumors. This alteration increases the tumors’ susceptibility to immune detection
  and attack. Consequently, when HZCO is combined with PD-1 therapy, it markedly impedes
  the progression of primary tumors and produces a considerable abscopal effect
