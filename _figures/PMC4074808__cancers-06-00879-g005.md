caption: Schematic model of Lgl/aPKC function in Hippo signalling. For simplicity,
  only proteins relevant to the current study are illustrated in the diagram. Interactions
  between different upstream components of the Hpo pathway and Yki are shown (positive
  interactions are illustrated by arrows, inhibitory interactions are depicted with
  blocked lines). The Hpo pathway controls tissue growth by regulating the subcellular
  localization of Yki, which when phosphorylated is cytoplasmic and unphosphorylated
  is nuclear. Yki associates with cognate transcription factors to promote cell proliferation
  and inhibit apoptosis. Lgl/aPKC regulate Hpo signalling independently of Fat/Dachs,
  Kibra/Expanded/Merlin and dRASSF/dSTRIPAK complexes.
