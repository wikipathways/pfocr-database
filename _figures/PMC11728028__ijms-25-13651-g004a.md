caption: Diagram of the pattern of gibberellin biosynthesis and signaling pathways.
  (A) Diagram of the pattern of gibberellin biosynthesis pathway; (B) Diagram of the
  pattern of gibberellin signaling pathway. The expression of relevant DEGs in the
  graph is indicated by color. Redder colors indicate higher relative expression,
  and greener colors indicate lower expression. Solid arrows represent direct connections,
  and dashed arrows represent indirect connections. The standard deviation is indicated
  by error bars, whereas the mean of three biological replicates (n = 3) is represented
  by bar heights. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are indicated by different lowercase
  letters
