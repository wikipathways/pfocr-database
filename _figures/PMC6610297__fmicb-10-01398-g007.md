caption: The metabolic pathway of glycerophospholipid, glycolysis, and TCA cycle of
  S. cerevisiae under hypoxia stress. The red dashed line box was up-regulated pathway,
  including GPL and glycolysis pathway, and the green dashed line box was down-regulated
  pathway of TCA cycle. The differentially expressed genes were indicated in the blue
  background. The differentially expressed proteins were showed in the yellow background.
  Both of DEGs and DEPs were indicated in the purple background. The metabolites were
  showed in the gray squares. The red and green word in different background indicated
  the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, proteins, or metabolites, respectively.
