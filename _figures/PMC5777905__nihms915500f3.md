caption: 'Schematic representation of cholangiocyte plasticity. Endogenous and exogenous
  insults can activate normal cholangiocytes which are characterized by enhanced secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that recruit both immune and mesenchymal
  cells to promote biliary remodeling. After insults, proliferation is also activated
  as a consequence of cholangiocyte death (lysis and/or apoptosis) and if the cellular
  injury continues, cholangiocytes can become senescent. Senescent cholangiocytes
  are under permanent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis resistant. Ongoing cellular
  injury leads to continuous generation of senescent cells leading to progression
  into a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This eventually leads to tissue
  dysfunction and tumor promotion. The dashed arrows suggest that reactive and senescent
  cholangiocytes can go through repair mechanisms that are mediated by several pathways,
  with Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway being one of the most important. Abbreviations:
  IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB;
  SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype; TGF-β, transforming growth factor
  β.'
