caption: Pathway analysis of DEGs that were putative target genes of differentially
  expressed miRNA and lncRNAs was carried out to assess their putative biological
  functions (). As examples, amphetamine addiction pathway composed of DEGs and their
  corresponding miRNAs and lncRNAs was shown. Genes with red font suggested an up-regulation
  while genes with blue font indicated a down-regulation in response to METH.
