caption: PI3K/AKT pathway and HER2-targeted therapy resistance. High expression of
  the HER2 truncated mutant (p95-HER2), the most common form of HER2 structural change,
  is related to HER2-targeted therapy resistance through activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Trastuzumab treatment increases HER3 expression and leads to PI3K/AKT activation
  along with subsequent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, PI3KCA mutations,
  PTEN loss or both, also contribute to PI3K activation and then promote cell proliferation
  along with resistance to HER2-targeted therapy.
