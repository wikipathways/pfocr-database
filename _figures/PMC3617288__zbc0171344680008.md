caption: Model for the new PLD2-Fes-Jak3 pathway. In MCF10A cells (left), both the
  protein expression levels and the enzymatic activity of the three signaling molecules
  (PLD2, JAK and Fes) are maintained at a low level. A complex inter-regulation equilibrium
  composed of activations and inhibitions keep PLD and the synthesis of PA in balance
  and at a basal level. In MDA-MB-231 cells (right), the situation is very different;
  both the protein expression levels and the activity of PLD2, JAK and Fes are upregulated.
  The kinases activate PLD that then synthesizes higher amounts of PA. Furthermore,
  this PA feeds back positively on Fes that, upon binding to the phospholipid, is
  further activated. PC, phosphatidylcholine; HKD, phospholipase D signature motif.
