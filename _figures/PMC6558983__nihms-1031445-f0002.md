caption: (A) Natural products derived from saxitoxin (STX, 9). The molecules with
  the highest and lowest Kd are outlined. *The Kd of 11-β-hydroxysaxitoxin (7) has
  not been determined, but its IC50 value ranks the molecule below saxitoxin in terms
  of affinity. (B) Previously proposed STX (9) biosynthetic pathway. (C) Saxitoxin
  gene cluster and potential enzymes involved in late-stage oxygenation.
