caption: Gene and metabolite association analysis. For the ko00941 pathway, gene and
  metabolite association analysis was performed for Ma50 vs. Ma0 a Ma100 vs. Ma0 b and
  Ma100 vs. Ma50 c For the ko01110 pathway, gene and metabolite association analysis
  was performed for Ma50 vs. Ma0 d Ma100 vs. Ma0 e and Ma100 vs. Ma50 f Metabolites
  are marked with green squares, and genes are marked with red circles. Solid lines
  represent positive correlations, and dashed lines represent negative correlations
