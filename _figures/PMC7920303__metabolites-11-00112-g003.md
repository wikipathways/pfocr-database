caption: Metabolism of small, neutral amino acids including serine (Ser), glycine
  (Gly), and alanine (Ala). Serine, glycine, and alanine are mainly transported by
  the plasma membrane transporters SLC38A1, SLC38A2, SLC1A4, and SLC1A5 or synthesized
  de novo by cytosolic and/or mitochondrial pathways. Sodium (Na+) gradients across
  the plasma membrane drive intracellular concentration of serine, glycine, and alanine.
  Serine is synthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate (3pg) through a three-step process
  involving 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase
  (PSAT1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). Cytosolic serine is used for several
  metabolic pathways, including the transsulfuration pathway for de novo cysteine
  synthesis and folate-mediated one carbon metabolism (FOCM) involving serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases (MTHFD). FOCM occurs in both
  the cytosol and mitochondria and can produce glycine. In the cytosol, glycine is
  utilized for glutathione synthesis and purine synthesis (marked in red) and acts
  as a substrate for the methionine cycle important for methylation reactions. In
  the mitochondria, glycine can be cleaved by the glycine cleavage system (GCS) to
  provide one carbon unites for FOCM and is a substrate for δ-aminolevulinic acid
  (δ-ALA) synthesis. When GCS activity is low, mitochondrial glycine can lead to the
  accumulation of methylglyoxal. Components of FOCM, including 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-meTHF) and 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formylTHF) can contribute to nucleotide
  biosynthesis (marked in dark blue and dark red, respectively). Mitochondrial serine
  import is facilitated by sideroflexin 1 and 3 (SFXN1/3), formate is transported
  by an unknown transport(er) mechanism, and glycine is imported by SLC25A38 and other
  transporters may be involved. Alanine is synthesized from pyruvate by cytosolic
  or mitochondrial glutamic-pyruvic transaminases (GPT) localized to the cytosol (GPT1)
  or mitochondria (GPT2). Pyruvate is imported into the mitochondria by the mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier (MPC1/2) an obligate heterodimer. Alanine is exchanged between
  the cytosol and mitochondria by an unknown transporter. 10-formylTHF, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate;
