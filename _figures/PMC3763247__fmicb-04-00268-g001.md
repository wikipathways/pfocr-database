caption: Model of the C1 metabolism of aerobic and facultatively aerobic methanol
  utilizers (A), and of methanol-utilizing methanogens and acetogens (B). Various
  Bacteria that employ PQQ MDH and PQQ MDH2 utilize nitrate besides molecular oxygen,
  and are, thus, facultative aerobes. Red, enzymatic reactions indicative for methanol
  utilization. Gray, metabolic crossing points to anabolic pathways. Structural genes
  are targets for the molecular assessment of methanol-utilizing microorganisms in
  the environment. PQQ MDH, PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase; PQQ MDH2, alternative
  PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in Methylibium andBurkholderia strains; FAD
  AO, FAD-dependent alcohol oxidoreductase; MDO, methanol oxidoreductase; NAD MDH,
  NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase; FAE1, tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent formaldehyde
  activating enzyme; MCH, tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent methenyl-methylene cyclohydrolase;
  FaDH, formaldehyde dehydrogenase; GSH, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde oxidation;
  MySH, mycothiol-dependent oxidation of formaldehyde in yeast; CH2 = HF4, methylene
  tetrahydrofolate; CH3-THF, methyl-tetrahydrofolate; CH3-CoM, methyl-coenzyme M;
  CH3OH, methanol; CH2O, formaldehyde; COOH formate; CO2, carbon dioxide; CO, carbon
  monoxide; CH3CO–S–CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; CH3COOH, acetic acid. Biomass, assimilation
  of carbon occurs at the level of formaldehyde and/or on carbon dioxide in aerobic
  methylotrophs; pathways involved are the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle, ribulose-monophosphate
  pathway, and the serine cycle. Assimilation of carbon in methanogens is mediated
  by a unique reductive acetyl-CoA-pathway, whereas acetogens form acetyl-CoA as an
  intermediate that can be used for biosnthesis. This figure is based on previous
  articles (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ).
