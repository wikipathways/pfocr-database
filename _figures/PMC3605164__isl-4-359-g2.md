caption: Figure 2. An illustration of the Wnt signaling pathway. Without Wnt ligand
  stimulation, β-cat is trapped within the “destruction complex,” phosphorylated by
  the protein kinase GSK-3 and CK-1α at Ser33 and adjacent Ser positions, and subsequently
  degraded by proteasome (left). Following Wnt ligand stimulation and Dishvelled (Dvl)
  activation, β-cat escapes the trapping, enters the nucleus and forms the bipartite
  transcription factor cat/TCF, which leads to the stimulation of Wnt target gene
  expression (middle). GLP-1 was shown to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A
  (PKA), and stimulate β-cat Ser675 phosphorylation, which is positively associated
  with its nuclear translocation and Wnt target gene expression (right).
