caption: a The schematic representation of the location of OPN on human chromosome
  4.OPN is at location 4q22.1. Genes encompassed within a 600 kb region on chromosome
  4 encodes several noncollagenous bone and dentin proteins including OPN, bone sialoprotein(BSP),
  dentin matrix protein I (DMPI) and dentin sialophosphoportin (DSPP). All of them
  are classified as small intergrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING)
  family proteins. b The signalling pathway of osteopontin. Osteopontin binds integrin
  α4β1 which causes degradation of phospharylated inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B
  kinase subunit beta (IKKβ). Inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (IκBα)
  and nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB; p50 and p65) are both freed following
  this process. IκBα is degraded by the ubiquitination pathway, while NF-κB enters
  the cell nucleus where it is phosphorylated and it enhances the expression of pro-survival
  genes. Moreover, upon binding of osteopontin to integrin α4β1, phosphorylated IKKβ
  causes inactivation of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3A). Active FOXO3A is important in decreasing
  the expression of anti-survival genes such as BIM, BAK and BAX which cause caspase
  activation and cell apoptosis via mitochondrion and release of cytochrome c. Activation
  of OPN mediate a diverse range of cellular function, including cell survival/ proliferation,
  cell-cycle progression, cell migration, endothelial mesenchymal transition, T cell
  activation, cytokine production, fibrosis, angiogenesis and bone calcification and
  mineralisation

    Osteopontin binds integrin α4β1 which causes degradation of phospharylated inhibitor

    factor kappa-B (IκBα) and nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-κB; p50 and
