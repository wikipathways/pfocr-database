caption: Possible roles for malin in glycogen metabolism. Normal, cytosolic glycogen
  metabolism involves synthesis by GS and branching enzyme (BE) and degradation by
  Ph and debranching enzyme (AGL). In this model, active, soluble laforin (LF) is
  viewed as a necessary component of normal glycogen metabolism, preventing hyperphosphorylation
  that can lead to insoluble, poorly branched glycogen. Malin could act positively
  to up-regulate or at least maintain soluble laforin activity simply by forming a
  complex with laforin or by some other mechanism (pathway a). An alternative possibility
  would be prevention of the formation of aberrantly structured glycogen by an as
  yet unknown pathway independent of laforin (pathway b). Finally, malin might act
  to promote the lysosomal disposal of any aberrantly structured glycogen as it is
  formed (pathway c).
