caption: Hypothetical molecular mechanisms in cerebral cortical vessels of CAA patients.
  Based on the results in the present study, we illustrate the features of pathological
  molecular mechanisms that occur in cerebral cortical vessels of CAA patients. Red,
  proteins showing either significant upregulation in ADNC +/CAA +/H donors or significant
  positive correlations with Aβ or COL6A2. Blue, proteins showing either significant
  downregulation in ADNC +/CAA +/H donors or significant negative correlations with
  Aβ or COL6A2. Gray, proteins which were not quantified in the present study. The
  proteins whose significant change in protein expression in CAA capillary was clarified
  for the first time in the present study were surrounded with solid line. The proteins
  whose change in protein expression in CAA capillary or CAA model has been already
  reported were surrounded with broken line. The mutual relationship of individual
  molecules was based on our literature search. The present study revealed that a
  variety of molecules in the fibrosis pathway including ECM, adhesion and TGF-β signal
  proteins were activated. Furthermore, the activation of oxidative stress-related
  molecules and the inactivation of AKT signalling molecules are also shown, and these
  would have activated the apoptosis pathway including caspase signal. The activation
  of fibrosis and apoptosis leads to the suppression of the Aβ clearance and the destruction
  of cerebral vessels. Based on literature search, HSP90A, CD44, and CA1 are considered
  as therapeutic targets of taxifolin, verbascoside, and acetazolamide, respectively.
  The upregulation of these three proteins in CAA capillaries were clarified for the
  first time in the present study. The molecular mechanisms illustrated here would
  be useful for better understanding of the CAA pathology and for promoting the discovery
  and development of drugs and biomarkers for CAA
