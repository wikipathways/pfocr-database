caption: 'Methionine metabolism: transmethylation pathway. Methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT) catalyzes the conversion of methionine and ATP into AdoMet. In transmethylation
  reactions, AdoMet donates its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor molecules
  (X) in reactions catalyzed by methyl transferases (MTs). AdoMet-dependent methylation
  reactions yield AdoHcy as a byproduct. AdoHcy cellular content is regulated by the
  enzyme AdoHcy hydrolase (AHCY), which reversibly cleaves this molecule into adenosine
  and homocysteine. Remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine occurs by two
  enzymes: methionine synthase (MS), which requires normal levels of folate and vitamin
  B12, and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which requires betaine,
  a metabolite of choline. MS-catalyzed homocysteine remethylation requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTHF), which is derived from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) in a
  reaction catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 5-MTHF is then
  converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) as it donates its methyl group and THF is converted
  to 5,10-MTHF to complete the folate cycle.'
