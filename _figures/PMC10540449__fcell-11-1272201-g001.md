caption: The schematic of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway.
  Created with BioRender.com. Initially, BMP ligands bind to type II receptors (BMPR2/ACVR2A/ACVR2B),
  which in turn recruit and phosphorylate type I receptors (BMPR1A/BMPR1B/ACVR1/ACVRL1).
  This phosphorylation event leads to the activation of SMAD1/5/9 proteins, which
  then form a complex with the common SMAD (SMAD4) and transduce signals to the nucleus,
  modulating the expression of downstream target genes, including Id1 and Id2. Extracellular
  antagonist Noggin suppresses BMP signaling by inhibiting the binding of BMP ligands
  with their corresponding receptors. Additionally, inhibitory SMAD6 and SMAD7 prevent
  the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD1/5/9 proteins. Furthermore,
  noncanonical BMP signaling transduces through phosphorylated TAK1 (pTAK1). BMPRI
  interacts with the TAK1-TAB1 complex via X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP),
  leading to the phosphorylation and activation of downstream mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs), including p38, ERK1/2, and JNK. Consequently, these activated kinases
  translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and activate ATF2, c-JUN, and
  c-FOS, thus regulating the transcription of downstream target genes.
