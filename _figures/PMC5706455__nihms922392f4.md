caption: Hepcidin expression is regulated by iron signals (middle), erythropoiesis
  (left), and inflammation (right).High iron stores augment BMP6 (bone morphogenetic
  protein 6), which together with its co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV) activates type
  1 (Alk2/3) and type 2 (BMPR2, ACVR2A) BMP serine threonine kinase receptors, leading
  to phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMAD (R-SMAD) proteins and formation of
  active transcriptional complexes with SMAD4. The HJV-BMP interaction may be facilitated
  by neogenin. High concentrations of Tf-Fe2 displace HFE from TFR1, which then forms
  a complex with TFR2 and HJV to promote BMP/SMAD signaling to Hepcidin. HFE additionally
  interacts with ALK3 and prevents its ubiquitination (Ub) and degradation. BMP/SMAD
  signaling to Hepcidin is suppressed by matriptase 2 (TMPRSS6), a serine protease
  that cleaves and generates a soluble form of HJV (sHJV). The pathway is also feedback
  inhibited by SMAD7 and dampened by the miR-122 microRNA, which lowers HJV and HFE
  expression.In inflammation, the interaction of interleukin 6 (IL-6) with its receptor
  (IL-6R) activates JAK tyrosine kinases, triggering the formation of STAT3 (Signal
  transducer and transcription activator 3) complexes that bind to the Hepcidin promoter
  in the nucleus. Hepcidin stimulation by activin B is dependent on the BMP/SMAD signaling
  pathway.High erythropoietic activity increases plasma levels of ERFE, which suppresses
  Hepcidin via as yet unknown signaling pathways.Additional signals modulate Hepcidin
  expression. These include protein misfolding (ER stress), which activates Hepcidin
  transcription through CREBH (cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like
  protein 3, also known as CREB3L3), as well as hormones/growth factors and various
  metabolic cues.The STAT3- and BMP-response elements (REs) in the Hepcidin promoter
  are depicted.
