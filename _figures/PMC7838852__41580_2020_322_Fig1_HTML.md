caption: 'a | Schematic representation of the four human p38 kinases, indicating gene
  names (in parentheses), amino acid numbers and the different domains. The kinase
  domain is 90% identical in amino acid sequence among the four members. The CD domain
  is a negatively charged region involved in high-affinity docking interactions with
  substrates and regulators that contain positively charged docking (D) motifs. The
  ED domain contributes to substrate docking and specificity, being particularly important
  for interactions with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein
  (MAPKAP) kinase 2 (MK2) and MK3. The ATP binding site and the phosphorylated Thr
  and Tyr residues of the activation loop are also indicated. p38γ has an additional
  carboxy-terminal region that binds to PDZ domain-containing proteins (serving as
  scaffolding proteins for various signalling pathways). p38 kinases are also referred
  to as stress-activated protein kinases: SAPK2a (p38α), SAPK2b (p38β), SAPK3 (p38γ)
  and SAPK4 (p38δ). b | Schematic representation of the three human MAP2Ks involved

  to RHO, CDC45 and RAC small GTPases, phosphorylation by STE20 kinases and ubiquitylation
  by TRAF ubiquitin ligases, triggering phosphorylation of MAP2K, which in turn phosphorylate
  and activate p38 kinases. In the non-canonical pathways, activation is triggered
  by autophosphorylation of p38α either by binding to proteins such as transforming
  growth factor-β-activated protein 1 (TAB1) (observed in various cell types, but
