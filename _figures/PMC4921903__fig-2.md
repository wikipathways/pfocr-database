caption: 'CO-induced transcriptomic changes of genes involved in the TCA (Krebs) cycle,
  glycolytic pathways, and O2-dependent electron transport pathways in aerobic and
  anaerobic conditions. (A) The major routes of carbon flow through the Embden–Meyerhof
  pathway and Krebs cycle are shown. (B) Reducing equivalents from NADH are fed via
  two NADH dehydrogenases (Ndh, Nuo) to a quinone pool (Q) and thence to one of three
  terminal oxidases (cytochromes bd-I, bd-II, and bo′). Each block of color strips
  indicates a single gene involved in the reaction step shown and, within each block,
  the vertical strips show (from left to right) changes in gene expression at the
  sampling points (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min after introducing CO gas). Changes
  in gene expression are illustrated by the heat map (right): blue color indicates
  a gene that is downregulated, red color indicates upregulation, and yellow color
  indicates no change in transcriptomic level. TCA, tricarboxylic acid. To see this
  illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version of this article
