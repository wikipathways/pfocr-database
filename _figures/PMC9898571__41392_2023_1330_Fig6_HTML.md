caption: Role of focal adhesion and HIFs pathway in OA chondrocytes. Focal adhesion
  protein Kindlin-2(K2), which is co-localized with integrin α on the cell membrane,
  is highly expressed in adult articular chondrocytes. In OA chondrocytes, loss of
  Kindlin-2 promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy and catabolism by activating the phosphorylation
  of Stat3 and upregulating transcription factor Runx2. HIF-1α and HIF-2α are both
  activated by hypoxia. HIF-1α inhibits Wnt signaling by blocking β-catenin translocation
  to the nucleus and downregulates MMP13 expression in healthy articular cartilage
  in mice. HIF-1α λ is upregulated in OA chondrocytes and induces abnormal blood vessel
  invasion by upregulating VEGFA. HIF-2α directly induces the expression of OA risk
  factor, Runx2, and catabolic genes encoding MMP1, MMP3, MMP13, ADAMTS4, and NOS2,
  to promote cartilage destruction in OA chondrocytes. Besides hypoxia, the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway and the upregulation of mTORC1 induce the overexpression and
  excessive accumulation of HIFs protein in articular chondrocytes
