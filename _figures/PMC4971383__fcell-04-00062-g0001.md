caption: The feedback loops that form the molecular clock. The molecular clock is
  controlled by the master transcription factor heterodimer CLOCK-BMAL1, which is
  regulated by two major negative feedback loops that generate 24-h oscillation of
  clock activity and target genes (Gallego and Virshup, ; Mohawk et al., ). In the
  first and most important loop, CLOCK-BMAL1 upregulates PER and CRY through binding
  to E-box DNA elements. Unbound PER and CRY proteins are phosphorylated by casein
  kinase 1 ε/δ (CK1ε/δ) and AMPK (AMP-kinase), respectively, to lead to degradation.
  GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3, not pictured) can also phosphorylate PER and CRY
  to promote their degradation (Harada et al., ; Iitaka et al., ). Otherwise, PER
  and CRY form a complex with CK1, which translocates to the nucleus to repress CLOCK-BMAL1
  activity. PER and CRY are then eventually degraded in a CK1-dependent manner (not
  pictured), and the time delay in the first loop forms an approximately 24-h cycle
  which is particularly dependent on dynamics of PER regulation (D'alessandro et al.,
  ). In the second loop, CLOCK-BMAL1 upregulates the negative transcription factors
  REV-ERBα and β (gene names NR1D1 and NR1D2) and the positive transcription factors
  RORα,β, or γ (not pictured), which repress or activate BMAL1 (gene name ARNTL) transcription,
  respectively, through binding to RRE (R-response element) DNA sequences. The importance
  of this second loop is underscored by the fact that mice lacking REV-ERBα and β,
  which form a complex and act together, lack normal circadian gene oscillation in
  the liver (Bugge et al., ; Cho et al., ). Several accessory loops exist; in one
  that will be highlighted in this review, SIRT1 (sirtuin 1) deacetylase tunes CLOCK-BMAL1
  activity by opposing the histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity of CLOCK (Asher
  et al., ; Nakahata et al., , ; Ramsey et al., ). SIRT1 is regulated by the metabolite
  NAD, which in turn is produced by the NAD-salvage enzyme NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase),
  the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD salvage pathway involved in NAD recycling and
  synthesis from dietary nicotinamide or niacin. Together, these primary and accessory
  loops lead to the 24-h expression of target genes and oscillation of downstream
  metabolic processes. Figure reprinted and modified from Altman et al. (), with permission
