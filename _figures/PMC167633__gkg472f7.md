caption: Proposed pathway for mEndo V-initiated DNA repair. The proteins believed
  to be responsible for the different steps are indicated. The repair process is initiated
  by cleavage at the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion by mEndo V. The damaged
  nucleotide is removed by the 3′ mismatch-specific exonucleolytic activity of the
  apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease APE1 (), or alternatively by the 3′ flap-specific
  activity of Mus81 (). Repair is completed by polymerisation and ligation. Repair
  synthesis is in red.
