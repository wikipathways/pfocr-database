caption: 'Pathophysiologic roles of IL-17 signaling in cardiac fibrosis. The IL-17
  family cytokines include IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, and IL-17F. The
  IL-17A/IL-17F mediated signaling pathway has been extensively studied. After IL-17A/IL-17F
  binds to the IL17RA/RC receptor complex, the receptor complex recruits the signal
  transduction adaptor protein Act1 through its SEFIR domain.Act1 serves as the crucial
  molecule for all known downstream signaling pathways of IL-17A. Act1 rapidly recruits
  and ubiquitinates TRAF6, activating various downstream pathways, including: the
  TRAF6/TAK1/NF-κB pathway, TRAF6/MAPK/AP-1 pathway, and Act1/TRAF6/CREB pathway,
  which induce transcription of IL-17A target genes. Furthermore, Act1 promotes mRNA
  stabilization post-transcription by recruiting TRAF2 and TRAF5. Ultimately, IL-17
  induces the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrosis molecules and stimulate
  activation, proliferation, migration, and secretion of myocardial fibroblasts, thereby
  aggravating cardial fibrosis. Adapted with permission from “Cell Types”, by BioRender.com
