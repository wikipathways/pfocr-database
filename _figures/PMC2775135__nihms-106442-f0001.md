caption: P. gingivalis activates the high-affinity conformation of CR3 through TLR2
  inside-out signalling involving Rac1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (,
  ). CD14 participates in the pathway as a coreceptor for efficient P. gingivalis-induced
  TLR2 stimulation, which in parallel activates a distinct nuclear factor-κB-dependent
  pro-inflammatory/antimicrobial pathway (, ). Intriguingly, P. gingivalis can interact
  with activated CR3 leading to its internalization and outside-in signalling, which
  via extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) downregulates IL-12 p35 and
  p40 mRNA expression. This in turn inhibits production of bioactive IL-12 and undermines
  IL-12-mediated immune clearance of the pathogen (, ). Blocking TLR2 would counteract
  this immune evasion strategy but may also suppress protective nuclear factor-κB-dependent
  antimicrobial responses. On the other hand, inhibitors of signalling intermediates
  of the inside-out pathway or antagonists of CR3 may selectively target this immune
  evasion mechanism. The latter approach (CR3 antagonism) was successfully tested
  in the mouse periodontitis model ().
