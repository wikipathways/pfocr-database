caption: The canonical JAK–STAT pathway in Drosophila. Binding of the ligand Upd to
  the transmembrane receptor Dome leads to cross phosphorylation and activation of
  the receptor-associated Hop kinase. Activation of Hop leads to phosphorylation of
  the receptor, providing a docking site for cytoplasmatic STAT. Once bound to the
  Dome/Hop complex, STAT also becomes phosporylated, resulting in the formation of
  stable dimers that translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression.
