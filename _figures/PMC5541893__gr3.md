caption: Mechanisms involved in initiation, perpetuation, and resolution of inflammatory
  responses. The immune response is initially induced by triggers (inducers) DAMPs
  and PAMPs sensed by tissue resident macrophages and other cells such as mast cells
  and NK cells (Ia) to resolve the trigger locally. If the injury or infection is
  not resolved locally by resident cells continuous increase in production of proinflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines, vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory lipid mediators contribute
  to attraction of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils from peripheral circulation
  (Ib). Monocytes differentiate under initial inflammatory conditions to inflammatory
  macrophages (M1), which contribute to elimination of the initial trigger (injury,
  infection, etc.) together with neutrophils (Ic). Under active inflammation, hypoxia
  develops and supports further attraction of neutrophils. As part of the trigger
  elimination process, neutrophils release their nucleic DNA and other cytoplasmic
  components in the process called NETosis, which contributes to pathogen elimination
  but also to further attraction of next waves of neutrophils (Id). The local inflammatory
  environment is sensed also by the peripheral nervous system (n. vagus) as part of
  a neural circuit activated by cytokines, etc., known as the inflammatory reflex.
  Several factors, which initially contribute to the development of the inflammatory
  response, later contribute to resolution of inflammation as shown in the lower part
  of the scheme. Neutrophil microvesicles concentration-dependently blocks production
  of proinflammatory mediators in macrophages and NK cells probably with contribution
  of the macrophage-expressed phosphatidylserine receptor and further induces local
  production of anti-inflammatory TGF-β and IL-10 by dendritic cells and macrophages.
  Neutrophil microvesicles may also exhibit their anti-inflammatory function directly
  by their components such as phosphatidic acid (PA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) d5-17-HDHA,
  and d5-14-HDHA, which are biosynthetic pathway markers of resolvins and maresin,
  AnxA1, S100A8, etc. PA exhibits inflammation resolving activities when hydrolysed
  by sPLA2 into lysophosphatidic acid (Ra). The nervous system contributes to resolution
  of inflammation by the inflammatory reflex consisting in the production of (1) noradrenalin,
  which acts upon T cells leading to production of immunosuppressive acetylcholine,
  and (2) Netrin-1, which together with acetylcholine contributes to changes in lipid
  mediator production from proinflammatory prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leucotrienes
  to anti-inflammatory lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, protectins, etc. (Rb). Hypoxia,
  initially supporting the inflammation development, induces the blockage of neutrophils
  influx through Netrin-1 produced by endothelial cells in the later phases of inflammation
  and stimulates Th cells for extracellular release of anti-inflammatory-acting adenosine,
  which contribute to macrophage polarisation towards anti-inflammatory M2. Hypoxia
  is sensed through Hif-1α (Rc). During resolution of inflammation, apoptotic cells
  exposing AnxA1 and PS are engulfed by efferocytosis (Rd), which is further stimulated
  by resolvins and lipoxins and induces polarisation of macrophages towards M2. Phagocytosis
  of apoptotic neutrophils induces egress of macrophages to draining lymph nodes (Re).
  Egress of cells from the inflammatory site is supported also by eosinophil-produced
  lipoxin A4. Another mechanism contributing to the resolution of inflammation consists
  in exaggerated NETosis leading to aggregation of NETs (AggNETs). Aggregated NETs
  degrade inflammatory cytokines, dismantle chemokine and cytokine gradients, and
  suppress further neutrophil recruitment (Rf). During the resolution phases, the
  influx of neutrophils from the bloodstream is further inhibited by released AnxA1,
  a resolvin acting upon FPR2/ALX receptor (Rg). AA = arachidonic acid; AC = apoptotic
