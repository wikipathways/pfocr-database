caption: Potential mechanism of resveratrol action on metabolic syndrome. Resveratrol
  (RSV) improves the plasma lipid profile by reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride
  levels and increasing HDL cholesterol levels. In hepatocytes, RSV can increase HMG-CoA
  reductase activity and potentiate LDL receptor expression to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol.
  RSV also inhibits the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, which have important
  antiatherogenic and antiatherosclerotic effects. RSV can also activate Nrf2, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase and other antioxidant response components and attenuate the
  production of TNFα. RSV induces structural alterations in Keap1 protein, thereby
  inhibiting it from sequestering Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Increased cytoplasmic Nrf2
  translocate to the nucleus, where it binds the response elements and initiates transcription
  of multiple antioxidant genes90. Thus, RSV has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
  effects. In the vascular endothelium, RSV attenuates the expression of adhesion
  molecules by inhibiting the NF-κB activation pathway. In vascular macrophages, RSV
  reduces the formation of foam cells by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase 1 and reducing
  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. RSV prevents vascular aging by reducing
  the activity of the renin/angiotensin II system and stimulating the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2/mas receptor axis. RSV also provides additional anti-carcinogenic effects
  parallel with cardioprotective effects.
