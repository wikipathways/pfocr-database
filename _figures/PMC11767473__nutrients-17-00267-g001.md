caption: 'The importance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the bone-formation mechanism.
  The figure showed the dual role of Runx2 during bone formation. This protein and
  Runx1 and their co-factor Cbfβ allow osteoblast differentiation. Meanwhile, Runx2
  hinders the mechanism mediating osteoclast differentiation. SIRT1 and FOXO1 are
  crucial proteins for enhancing Runx2 expression. Various protein codings are also
  involved in the different stages of differentiation as follows: Osterix and β-catenin
  during early osteoblast formation, SATB2, and ATF4 during osteoblast maturation.
  In contrast, SATB2 attenuates Hoxa2 activation in the initial stage of osteoblast
  formation. Osteoblasts’ and osteoclasts’ interaction is vital. Meanwhile, the RANKL
  signaling pathway activates osteoclast differentiation, and OPG inhibits this process.
  In parallel, osteoclasts can also trigger osteoblast differentiation via Wnt10b,
  BMP6. Runx1; Runt-related 1, Runx2; Runt-related 2, Cbfβ; Core-Binding Factor Subunit
