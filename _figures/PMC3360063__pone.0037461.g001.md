caption: 'Various enzymes present in this pathway are as follows: bifunctional deoxycytidine
  triphosphate deaminase/ deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (bifunctional
  dCTPdeaminase/ dUTPase), deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase),
  nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk), thymidylate kinase (dTMP kinase), thymidylate
  synthase (ThyA, ThyX) and ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (Nrd). The dUTPase
  enzyme (underlined) converts dUTP (grey highlighted box) into dUMP (grey highlighted
  box) thereby provides input into dTTP synthesis and eliminates dUTP. An abnormally
  elevated dUTP/dTTP ratio will lead to uracil incorporation into DNA, as indicated
  by the dashed arrow. DNA synthesis is provided by several different polymerases
  (for simplicity no specific polymerases are named here).'
