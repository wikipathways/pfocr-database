caption: The mechanism of astrocyte regulation of Lcn-2. ROS production can cause
  ER stress and activate PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway, thus promoting the expression
  and secretion of Lcn-2. NHE1 protein and TNFα can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway
  in astrocytes, inducing the secretion of Lcn-2. Inhibiting α2-NKA and proteasome
  can reduce Lcn-2 secretion by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, while autophagy
  activation can reduce its secretion by enhancing intracellular Lcn-2 degradation
