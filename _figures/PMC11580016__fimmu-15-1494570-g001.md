caption: Mechanisms of AHR signaling. In its basal state, AHR associates with HSP90,
  p23, XAP2 (ARA9/AIP), and SRC to maintain its cytoplasmic localization. Upon ligand
  binding, AHR undergoes a conformational alteration and translocates into the nucleus.
  It dissociates from this complex and subsequently forms a heterodimer with the AHR
  nuclear translocation protein (ARNT). This AHR-ARNT heterodimer translocates to
  the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of downstream target genes by binding
  to xenobiotic response elements (XREs). Target genes include cytochrome P450 family
  1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1), CYP1B1, and AHR repressor (AHRR), among others
  involved in various signaling pathways. The AHRR, in turn, modulates AHR activity
  through a negative feedback mechanism. Created in BioRender. qwe, s. (2024) BioRender.com/z56o095
