caption: Diagram of the crosstalk between HepG2 cells and TAMs-like macrophages. Over-expression
  of HMGA2 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2
  cells and increased the secretion of CSF1, which could accelerate the migration
  of TAMs-Mφs. Moreover, the recruited TAMs-Mφs could promote the HCC progression
  by activating the CCAT1/let-7b/HMGA2 signaling pathway.
