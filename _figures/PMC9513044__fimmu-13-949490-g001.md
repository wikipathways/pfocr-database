  of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and further induces reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), leading to MutL homolog 1 (MLH-1) methylation and microsatellite
  instability (MSI), leading to tumor progression. Activated MDSCs also inhibit T
  cell differentiation and promote tumor progression through activation of Arg1 and
  NOS2-mediated antitumor immunity (adapted from ). F, nucleatum also stimulates cell
  proliferation through activation of the Wnt/β-linked protein pathway. Many components
  of our daily diet are metabolized by bacteria in the digestive tract and produce
  the corresponding metabolites such as secondary bile acids, which promote carcinogenesis.

  can also produce carcinogenic effects at different sites in the distal part of the
