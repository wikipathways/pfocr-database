caption: The combination strategy to suppress tumor cell proliferation in anti-HER2
  resistant PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells. The constitutive activation of the
  HER2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway led to the remodeling of lipid metabolism and cell proliferation
  in HER2-positive breast cancer cells with PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss. SCD-1 and
  CD36 are highly expressed in anti-HER2 resistant breast cancer cells with PTEN loss.
  Simultaneously blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibiting CD36
  significantly reduces the proliferation of anti-HER2 resistant breast cancer cells
  with PTEN-loss
