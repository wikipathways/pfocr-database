caption: Interaction of the NOTCH1 receptor with Delta-like and Jagged ligands expressed
  on the surface of a neighbor cells triggers the proteolytic cleavage of the receptor,
  first by an ADAM metalloprotease (S2 cleavage) and subsequently by the γ-secretase
  complex (S3 cleavage), which releases the intracellular domains of NOTCH1 (ICN1)
  from the membrane. ICN1 translocates to the nucleus and interacts with DNA via the
  RBPJ/CSL DNA binding protein and recruits the MAML1 coactivator to activate the
  expression of NOTCH1 target genes.
