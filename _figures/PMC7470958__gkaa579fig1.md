caption: Possible fates of abandoned replication forks. (A) The formation of post
  replication gaps by lesion skipping. Gaps generated by lesion skipping can be filled
  either by RecA-mediated homologous recombination or RecA-independent template switching.
  Synthesis is initiated from an undamaged template. Resolution of this intermediate
  can yield either crossover or non-crossover products. (B) The process of replication
  fork reversal and Holliday junction formation. The lesion can be re-incorporated
  into the parental duplex to grant other repair pathway access. The lesion can also
  be bypassed by nascent strand template switching on the free end of the Holliday
  junction.
