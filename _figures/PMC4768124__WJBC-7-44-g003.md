caption: 'Signalling pathways trigger by protease-activated receptor 2 activation
  in the collecting duct. In this segment, protease-activated receptor (PAR) 2 activation
  increases the NKA activity in the principal cells and the Pds/Na+-driven bicarbonate/Cl-
  exchanger (NDBCE) system in the B-IC. Both processes involved the activation of
  the ERK1/2 pathway. CD: Collecting duct; PAR: Protease-activated receptor.'
