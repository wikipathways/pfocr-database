caption: (1) Anti-survival signaling mediated by GPCRs, such as the cannabinoid receptors,
  is dependent upon an increase in ceramide following the induction of serine palmitoyltransferase,
  which is the rate-limiting step in de novo ceramide production. Ceramide activates
  an ER-stress response, causing the upregulation of the stress protein p8, which
  inhibits the pro-survival factor AKT. (2) Pro-survival signaling elicited by GPCRs
  is generally dependent on AKT-mediated inhibition of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
  protein BAD. Thus, activation of AKT leads to the inhibition of cytochrome c release
  from the mitochondria and subsequent activation of caspase 3. In an alternate pathway,
  GPCRs activate NFκB, which can reduce pro-apoptotic gene transcription, such as
  the Fas receptor, leading to a reduction in apoptotic potential.
