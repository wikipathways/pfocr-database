caption: Diagram of tetrahydrofolate (THF) – dependent methionine transmethylation
  and transsulfuration for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. THF is the metabolically active
  form of folate that is converted to 5-methylTHF, the primary methyl donor for methionine
  transmethylation. The essential amino acid methionine is regenerated and conserved
  by the B12-dependent transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyl THF to homocysteine
  in the central methionine synthase (MS) reaction. Methionine is then activated to
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for multiple essential methyltransferase
  (MTase) reactions. The ratio of the methyl-donor SAM to the product-inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) is a reflection of transmethylation pathway efficiency and cellular methylation
  potential. The reversible hydrolysis of SAH to homocysteine and adenosine by the
  SAH hydrolase (SAHH) reaction completes the methionine cycle. Homocysteine can then
  be remethylated to methionine or irreversibly removed from the methionine cycle
  by cystathionine beta synthase (CBS). This reaction initiates the transsulfuration
  pathway for the synthesis of cysteine and glutathione. GSH is the active reduced
  form of glutathione and GSSG is the inactive oxidized form. Glutamylcysteine (Glu-Cys)
  is the metabolic precursor for GSH and Cystinylglycine (Cys-Gly) is an intermediate
  in an alternate pathway for GSH synthesis.
