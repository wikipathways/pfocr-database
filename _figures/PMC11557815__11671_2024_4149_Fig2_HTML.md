caption: Triggering effect of H. pylori-associated pathogenic BEMNs on vessel walls
  leading to the development of ASCVD and a promising therapeutic approach using engineered
  drug-loaded BEMNs. A The release of H. pylori-derived BEMNs into the stomach and
  the bloodstream. B Penetration of BEMNs across VEC membranes via the lipid microdomains
  and the release of CagA toxin. Activation of CagA via phosphorylation by Abl or
  Src kinases and the formation of CagA-P-Crk signaling complex. Activated CagA directly
  affect cellular tight junction and suppress the transcription of cholesterol removal
  transporters through the inhibition of the expression of PPARγ1 and LXRα mediated
  by NF-κB. Alongside, CagA induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion, as well as
  mitochondrial disfunction and ROS production. Engineered drug-loaded BEMNs penetrate
  to VECs and prevent CagA activation. C VacA released from BEMNs causes vacuolation
  of endosomes and lysosomes, mitochondrial disfunction, and the release of CytC,
  initiates p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.
  Putative targeted drug delivery using engineered BEMNs loaded with p38 inhibitors
  leads to disruption of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. D Pathogenic BEMNs stimulate
  chemokine release from VECs and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the vessel
  wall. BEMNs activate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, promote proliferation
  and differentiation of monocytes to Mphs and dendritic cells (DCs), which, in turn,
  stimulates cytokine production and accelerates foam cell formation and AS progression
