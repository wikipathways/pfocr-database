caption: Protective mechanisms of salidroside against hypoxia‐induced liver injury.
  Salidroside protected liver from hypoxia‐induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. The anti‐inflammatory effect of salidroside was dependent on inhibition
  of JAK2/STAT3 pathway combining with activation of Nrf2 pathway
