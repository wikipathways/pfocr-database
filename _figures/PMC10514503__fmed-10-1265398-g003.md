caption: S1P protects the intestinal barrier through multiple means. S1P protects
  the intestinal barrier in multiple ways. Under the stimulation of pathogens, the
  body rapidly activates the inflammatory pathway and produces a large number of inflammatory
  factors. The body’s immune response is unbalanced in sepsis, according to the different
  signaling pathways of S1PRs, barrier protection is exerted to restore body homeostasis.
  Endothelial cells mainly express the S1PR1-3 receptor signal, with the highest expression
  of S1PR1, which plays a major role in barrier protection. At the same time, the
  five receptors are involved in the migration of a variety of immune cells (T cells,
  B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, DC, NK cells.
