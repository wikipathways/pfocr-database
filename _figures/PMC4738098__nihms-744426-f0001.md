caption: (A) TGF-β1 regulates collagen synthesis and accumulation to maintain homeostasis
  under physiological conditions. This involves positive signaling pathways initiating
  collagen synthesis mediated by the nuclear signaling adapter protein TRAF6 via Smad2,3
  and TAK1/MEK/p38, and mechanisms for collagen degradation via autophagy linked to
  TAK1/MEK/p38 activation. These pathways have been documented in murine and human
  cardiac myocytes.(B) HIV infection leads to increases in TGF-β1 levels, which may
  induce pathologic fibrosis. HIV induces a variety of proinflammatory cytokines which
  elevate TGF-β1 and, through various mechanisms, including direct binding of HIV
  envelope to platelet DC–SIGN, induction of IL-6 and IL-8, and induction of tissue
  factor, can activate platelets, leading, we hypothesize, to their release of TGF-β1.
  Other cells involved in this inflammatory milieu, such as monocytes, may also contribute
  to TGF-β release. In addition, certain circulating HIV proteins can interfere with
  regulation of collagen accumulation by blocking Beclin 1. Beclin 1 has been documented
  to promote autophagy, alone and in association with an LC3 autophagocytic vesicle,
  in cardiac myocytes.(C) Treatment of HIV infection with ritonavir-based ART lowers
  circulating levels of TGF-β1 and other proinflammatory cytokines, but concentrations
  are not normalized. RTV itself may also be able to activate platelets, an effect
  thus far shown only for abacavir. In addition, the activity of TGF-β1 may be enhanced
  by RTV-mediated facilitation of TRAF6 activity through specific inhibition of immunoproteasome
  function, with resultant suppression of TRAF6 degradation. This could lead to increased
  collagen accumulation mediated through the TAK1/MKK3/p38 pathway. The role of autophagy
  in terms of overall collagen accumulation in this system is unknown. Its potential
  facilitation, via suppression of HIV proteins which block Beclin 1, and the contribution
  of TRAF6 mediated potentiation of TAK1/MEK/p38-associated autophagy, awaits further
  investigation.(D) Points of possible intervention to mitigate HIV/RTV-induced cardiac
  fibrosis. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been shown to have a dual role in many cell types,
  blocking production of TGF-β1 and other inflammatory cytokines as well as facilitating
  Beclin 1 activity, thereby promoting autophagy-mediated collagen degradation. We
  hypothesize that all of these CO-related mechanisms interact to mitigate TGF-β related
  cardiac fibrosis.
