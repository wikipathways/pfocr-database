caption: The glucose-mediated activation (Ser196 dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation)
  of ChREBP is required for the transcriptional induction of L-PK and ACC. FAS gene
  expression is synergistically regulated by ChREBP, LXR, and SREBP-1c. SCD1 and GPAT
  are under the transcriptional control of SREBP-1c and/or LXRs. While LXRs play a
  central role in insulin signaling through the transcriptional control of SREBP-1c,
  we could not find any evidence for direct involvement of LXRs in the glucose signaling
  pathway through ChREBP activation.
