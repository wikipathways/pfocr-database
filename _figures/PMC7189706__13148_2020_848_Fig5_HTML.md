caption: 'Hyperglycaemia may influence ten-eleven translocation (TET)-dependent O-GlcNAcylation
  of the histone methyltransferase SET1/COMPASS complex. TET2 and TET3 interact with
  O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), promoting its O-GlcNAcylation of the SET1/COMPASS complex
  which mediates trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Hyperglycaemia increases
  hexosamine pathway flux so increases production of the substrate UDP-GlcNAc. Abbreviations:
  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  (F1,6P2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3 BPG)'
