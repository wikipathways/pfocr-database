caption: 'The role of N-myristoylation in the TME. This figure depicts comprehensive
  signaling networks modulated by protein N-myristoylation within the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). Detailed mechanisms include: 1. ARF1-mediated apoptosis suppression: N-myristoylation-dependent
  membrane localization of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) activates ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase 1 (RSK1), leading to phosphorylation and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic
  protein Bcl- 2-associated death promoter (BAD). This cascade negatively regulates
  apoptosis, enhancing tumor cell survival. 2. FGF10/FGFR/Src pathway: Myristoylation
  of Src kinase facilitates its stable anchoring to lipid raft microdomains, where
  it promotes fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-mediated phosphorylation of
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This signaling enhances cell adhesion, migration, and
  prostate tumor progression driven by paracrine signaling from fibroblast growth
  factor 10 (FGF10). 3. ARF1/STING-mediated autophagy: Myristoylation-dependent membrane
  recruitment of ARF1 potentiates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-mediated
  autophagy flux, modulating innate immunity and tumor-immune cell interactions. This
  regulatory axis represents a novel immune evasion strategy exploited by tumors.
  4. Apoptosis via PAK2 and Bid: Upon apoptosis induction, N-myristoylated caspase-cleaved
  C-terminal fragments of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2)and the pro-apoptotic protein
  BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) efficiently translocate to mitochondrial
  membranes. This translocation accelerates cytochrome C release, activating the apoptosome
  and driving apoptosis through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. 5. Autophagy
  via LAMTOR1 and mTORC1: N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation of late endosomal/lysosomal
  adaptor, MAPK, and MTOR activator 1 (LAMTOR1) facilitate its lysosomal targeting,
  essential for the recruitment and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1). This regulatory pathway critically controls autophagy initiation,
  influencing cellular metabolism and survival within the nutrient-stressed TME. 6.
  Ferroptosis regulation via ACSL1-FSP1: Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member
  1 (ACSL1)-dependent N-myristoylation of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)
  targets it to the plasma membrane, enhancing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ₁₀) reduction activity.
  This mechanism reduces lipid peroxide accumulation and lipophilic radical formation,
  protecting cancer cells from ferroptotic cell death. 7. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  signaling activation via TRAM: Following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), myristoylated TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule (TRAM) rapidly relocates to plasma membrane microdomains. Protein kinase
  C epsilon (PKCε) phosphorylates TRAM, enhancing its binding affinity for the adaptor
  protein TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (Trif). This complex
  subsequently activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated type I interferon
  (IFN-I) production and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent proinflammatory cytokine
  secretion, orchestrating macrophage-driven inflammation within the TME. 8. B-cell
  receptor (BCR) signaling enhancement via Lyn kinase: Myristoylation and subsequent -palmitoylation
  of the Src-family kinase Lck/Yes-related novel protein tyrosine kinase (Lyn) stabilize
  B-cell receptor (BCR) complexes within lipid raft domains on the plasma membrane.
  This dual lipidation enhances BCR clustering, antigen recognition, and downstream
  signaling cascades mediated by phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), augmenting adaptive
  immune responses within the TME. 9. ARF1-STING axis (extended detail): N-myristoylation
  of ARF1 enhances membrane association and subsequent interaction with STING, promoting
  STING aggregation and downstream activation of autophagy, shaping the tumor-immune
  interface. 10. Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) via EZH2 and STAT3: Enhancer
  of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is enhanced
  by N-myristoylation-driven hydrophobic interactions, facilitating formation of membraneless
  condensates. These condensates efficiently concentrate activators of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent
  transcriptional activation of oncogenic genes critical for tumor proliferation,
  immune evasion, and epigenetic reprogramming. ACSL1: Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain
