caption: Partial pathway reconstruction of genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate
  metabolism. Only metabolic enzymes with significant differences in relative abundance
  (q < 0.05) between male and female ticks and KEGG annotation were included in this
  analysis. Continuous lines represent reactions catalyzed by the enzymes with significant
  differences in relative abundance between male and female ticks. Dashed lines represent
  pathway reconstruction based in KEGG. Fru-6P, Fructose 6-phosphate; GlcNAc-6P, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
