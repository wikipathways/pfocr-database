caption: Inflammatory induction of the colorectal cancer (CRC) occurrence. Deterioration
  of the intestinal ecological environment leads to the propagation of pathogenic
  microorganisms and imbalance in the microbial flora. Intestinal epithelial cells
  activate the NF-kB pathway to drive the inflammation. As the result, a large number
  of inflammation factors are released to induce the occurrence of CRC.
