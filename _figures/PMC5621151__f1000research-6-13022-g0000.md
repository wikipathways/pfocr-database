caption: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized by TLR4 and its co-receptors MD2 and
  CD14. TLR4 signals through two different pathways, the MyD88-dependent pathway and
  the TRIF-dependent pathway. The MyD88-dependent pathway utilizes the adapter protein
  MyD88, which recruits IRAK4, IRAK1, and TRAF6. Phosphorylation of IRAK1 and ubiquitination
  of TRAF6 leads to activation of IKKs and NF-κB. Activated NF-κB translocates to
  the nucleus where it promotes transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR2
  also signals through the MyD88-dependent pathway. The TRIF-dependent pathway, utilized
  by TLR3 and TLR4, signals through the adapter protein TRIF. TRIF recruits TRAF6
  and TRAF3. Signaling through TRAF6 leads to NF-κB activation, while signaling through
  TRAF3 utilizes IKKM ε to activate IRF3. Activated IRF3 translocates to the nucleus,
  where it leads to transcription of Type I interferons and interferon inducible genes.
