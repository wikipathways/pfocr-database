caption: Lipid metabolic pathways in immune cells. Fatty acid oxidation pathway converts
  fatty acids into multiple intermediates (including acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH2) for
  energy generation. Fatty acid synthesis is essential for activation-induced proliferation
  and differentiation of effector T cells.
