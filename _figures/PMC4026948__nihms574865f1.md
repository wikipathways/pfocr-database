caption: General scheme of the induction of gene expression through the Keap-1/Nrf2/ARE
  signaling pathway. ROS increase induces the dissociation of Nrf2 with Keap-1, leading
  to translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Heterodimerization of Nrf2 with Maf and
  its binding to ARE leads to transactivation of ARE-inducible genes (adapted from
  ). The network of biochemical interactions is represented using the Systems Biology
  Graphical Notation (SBGN) (www.sbgn.org) ().
