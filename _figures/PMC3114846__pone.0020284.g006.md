caption: A cluster containing genes associated with distinct diseases is shown on
  the left part of the figure. There are three main disease groups, Atopic Dermatitis
  (an autoimmune skin disease), Diabetes Mellitus Type I (an early onset, insulin-dependent,
  autoimmune disease), and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (including Crohn Disease and
  Ulcerative Colitis). Diseases are coloured according to their disease class (see
  ). The most significantly enriched Jak-STAT signaling pathway is displayed with
  some nodes from the cluster colored in red (right part).
