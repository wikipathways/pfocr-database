caption: PPs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells
  through the NF-kB and MAPK pathways. (A) In the NF-kB pathway, PPI+FC or Cisplatin
  inhibit the IKBα, which further inhibit the NF-kB p65, on one side its translocation
  to nucleus while on other side they inhibit the HOTAIR, MUCIN1 which further inhibit
  the HOTAIR translocation into nucleus. Once they inhibit the p65 and HOTAIR translocation
  into nucleus, they further inhibit VEGE, MMP-9, MUCIN1, DNMT1 and EZH2 which lead
  to inhibition of cell proliferation. (B) In the MAPK pathway, PPD and PPVII inhibit
  AKT, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 expression, which further inhibit caspase-8, Bcl-2, and
  Bcl-xl while upregulating Bak and Bax, resulting in mitochondrial membrane permeability,
  allowing Cyt-c to translocate from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. PPD and
  PPVII activate p38MAPK, thereby increasing Cyt-c expression; as a result, caspase-9
  also becomes activated. PPD and PPVII also activate p38 and caspase-9, respectively.
  Upon activation, caspase-9 further activates caspase-3 and PARP, triggering the
  apoptosis of cancer cells.
