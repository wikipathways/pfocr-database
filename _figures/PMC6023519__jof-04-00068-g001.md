caption: Regulatory models of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A
  (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathway in C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Environmental cues
  activate cAMP/PKA in C. albicans (A) and C. tropicalis (B). Upon directly sensing
  environmental cues or being activated by Ras1, Cyr1 converts ATP to cAMP to bind
  the regulatory subunits of PKA (Bcy1) and liberate the catalytic subunits (Tpk1
  and Tpk2). CaTpk1 is required for responding to stress (e.g., oxidative, osmotic,
  and thermal stressors), while CtTpk1 controls cell wall integrity and drug tolerance.
  In C. albicans, Tpk1 contributes to hyphal growth on solid media and Tpk2 is involved
  in hyphal growth in liquid media. In contrast, only Tpk2 contributes to hyphal growth
  on solid or in liquid media in C. tropicalis. In both species, Tpk1 and Tpk2 have
  redundant roles in vegetative growth. Furthermore, CtTpk1 and CtTpk2 share redundant
  functions in white-opaque switching and virulence, but in C. albicans, these two
  phenotypes are only controlled by Tpk2. GlcNAc induces both hyphal growth and white-opaque
  switching in C. albicans. In contrast, GlcNAc inhibits hyphal growth but promotes
  white-opaque switching in C. tropicalis. CO2 induces white-opaque switching in C.
  albicans, but inhibits the same transition in C. tropicalis. Environmental pH regulates
  hyphal growth via Cyr1 in C. albicans. In contrast, environmental pH controls white-opaque
  switching through Ras1-cAMP/PKA in C. tropicalis. Red lines and arrows indicate
  differences and dash lines represent these interactions have not been characterized
  between C. albicans and C. tropicalis.
