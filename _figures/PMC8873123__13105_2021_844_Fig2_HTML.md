caption: Autophagy plays an antitumor role in liver cancer. Sorafenib resistance and
  autophagy in HCC. Sorafenib inhibits autophagy by activating ATK/mTOR and AMPK pathway,
  resulting in drug resistance. Sorafenib inhibits autophagy process by changing multiple
  ATGs activity. In addition, sorafenib and its novel derivative, sc-59, inhibit the
  binding of Mcl-1 to Beclin 1. Autophagy is associated with apoptosis through protein
  Rb, and the formation of LC3-II is interfered by sorafenib, causing autophagy inhibition
  and drug resistance that inhibit cell apoptosis
