caption: 4-HNE-triggered lipolysis in adipocytes involves the activation of the cAMP/PKA/HSL
  pathway as well as the suppression of the AMPK pathway. Both AC activation and PDE3B
  inhibition potentially contribute to 4-HNE-induced increase of intracellular cAMP
  levels. PKA, protein kinase A; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; P, phosphorylation; TG, triglyceride; FFA, free fatty acids; AC,
  adenylyl cyclase; PDE3B, phosphodiesterase 3B; ? hypothetic mechanism.
