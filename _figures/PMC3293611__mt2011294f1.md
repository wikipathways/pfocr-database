caption: siRNA and miRNA pathways. Exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) introduced
  into the cytoplasm is cleaved by Dicer into 21-nt fragments with 2-nt overhangs
  on the 3′ ends. The antisense strand, or guide strand, is loaded into the RNA-induced
  silencing complex and the sense or passenger strand is cleaved by Argonaute-2 (Ago-2).
  The activated RISC-siRNA complex seeks out messenger RNA (mRNA) that hybridizes
  with the guide strand and cleaves this mRNA. The same silencing machinery participates
  in gene silencing by endogenous miRNAs. miRNAs usually hybridize imperfectly with
  target mRNA, which leads to translational repression rather than cleavage of target
  mRNA. Off-target gene silencing by synthetic siRNA is thought to occur when the
  siRNA seed region is partially complementary to 3′UTR sequences, causing siRNAs
  to enter the miRNA pathway. siRNA, short interfering RNA; miRNA, microRNA; nt, nucleotide;
  RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; UTR, untranslated region.
