caption: Working model of GPR120 modulation of mammary gland function. GPR120 enhances
  mammary gland function by modulating inflammation, lipogenesis, and development.
  GPR120 expression in the mammary gland rises substantially during lactation, suggesting
  a key role in supporting milk production. GPR120 signals through the Gαs–cAMP–EPAC
  pathway to enhance mammary lipogenesis and mammary gland development. Gene expression
  studies indicate that the EPAC–CTCF–PPARγ/CEBPα branch primarily regulates mammary
  lipogenesis, while the EPAC–CXCL14/CXCR4 autocrine loop drives mammary gland development.
  Overall, GPR120 activation, especially by n-3 PUFAs, improves mammary function by
  mitigating inflammation and directly controlling mammary lipogenesis and mammary
  gland development, highlighting a promising clinical target to enhance lactation
