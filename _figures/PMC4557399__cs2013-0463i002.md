caption: (A) Transcriptional regulation of human SERPINF1/rodent Serpinf1. Six RAREs
  are located at −1000 to −1 bp of the SERPINF1/Serpinf1 promoter region. In the presence
  of ATRA, RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to RAREs, dissociate from NCoR1, and recruit
  co-activators to activate SERPINF1/Serpinf1 transcription. In the absence of agonists,
  RAR/RXR heterodimers associate with NCoR1, which suppresses SERPINF1/Serpinf1 transcription.
  At least one ER-binding site is located at −864/+63 bp of the SERPINF1 promoter.
  Oestrogens induce ERs to form either heterodimers or homodimers to bind to the ER-binding
  site, triggering/suppressing SERPINF1 transcription depending on cell types and
  tissues. In addition, at least one GRE is found at −1721/+38 bp of the SERPINF1/Serpinf1
  promoter. GCs bind to GRs and promote GR nuclear translocation, which then initiates
  SERPINF1/Serpinf1 transcription via the promoter region GRE. Three micropthalmia-associated
  transcription factor (MITF)-binding regions are identified within the first intron
  of the SERPINF1 gene. MITF binds to the MITF-binding sites and up-regulates the
  transcription of SERPINF1. (B) Down-regulation of PEDF by hypoxia. Under hypoxic
  conditions, expression and activities of MMP-2/9 are increased, which promote the
  degradation of PEDF protein. In addition, a HIF-1-independent pathway to degrade
  PEDF was also reported. Hypoxia stimulates the autophagosome to down-regulate PEDF
  levels. Continuous green arrows represent gene transcription activation, whereas
  broken yellow arrows illustrate either activation or suppression of gene transcription
  depending on context. GCs, glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid analogues; GR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; NCoR1, nuclear receptor co-repressor
  1.
