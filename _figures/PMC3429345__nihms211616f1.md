caption: Chaperones guide the protein fold starting with the initial steps of protein
  synthesis. As a nascent chain exits the ribosome channel, a series of chaperones
  bind the extended polypeptide, interacting with the protein throughout its maturation
  into the native folded state. Chaperone assisted folding involves the core chaperone
  families, Hsp70, Hsp90 and TRiC. Specific co-chaperones modulate the folding activities
  of core chaperones depending on substrate and the step in the folding pathway. Additionally,
  chaperones protect the native fold during denaturing stresses that unfold or damage
  cellular proteins. Hsp100s and small Hsps prevent protein aggregation and work with
  chaperones to refold denatured cellular proteins. Specific co-chaperones recognize
  substrates and cooperate with core chaperones, determining the fate of the damaged
  protein. The chaperone quality control system directs the protein either for refolding
  or degradation by the proteasome.
