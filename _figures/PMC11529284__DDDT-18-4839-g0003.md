caption: Regulation of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide expression.
  BA-induced, FXR-mediated induction of nuclear suppressor SHP is a key mechanism
  to reduce NTCP expression by interfering with RXR, RAR, HNF-1α and HNF-4α with binding
  sites within the NTCP promoter. SIRT1 regulates FXR expression through HNF-1α. FXR
  further regulates the expression of NTCP mRNA through the FGF15/19 signaling pathway
  inhibits the down-regulation of NTCP by HNF1α and HNF4α via JNK-dependent pathway.
  And IL-1β and TNF-α down-regulated the expression of NTCP through inhibition of
  RAR/RXR complex. cAMP stimulates Ca2+ or PP2B to dephosphorylate NTCP. After cAMP
  activation, the PI3K/PKB/PKC isomers jointly promote the intracellular movement
  of NTCP into the plasma membrane. Other factors, including KIF4, E-cadherin, that
  promote the transport of NTCP to the membrane. Among them, yellow represents mouse,
  green represents rat, blue represents human, Orange represents mouse and rat, and
  purple represents rat and human, showing the effect. Created with BioRender.com
