caption: Visualization of a single cell. The components of the Wnt pathway are represented
  in red and the components of the Notch pathway in blue. The canonical Wnt pathway
  starts from the extracellular level of the short range signaling Wnt protein, which
  we represent by the Wntext variable. This short range molecule binds to the Frizzled
  receptor, which leads to an increase in the intracellular level of DSH. We therefore
  represent the interaction between these molecules by an activation from Wntext to
  Frizzled and then to DSH. The level of the scaffolding protein Axin is dependent
  on the level of DSH which acts as an inhibitor and Casein Kinase 1 α (represented
  by the variable Cask1α), which is assumed to be an activator. β-Catenin is phosphorylated
  by a complex composed, amongst others, by Axin. We separately represent the expression
  level of β-Catenin, β-Cateninexp. β-Catenin is activated by β-Cateninexp and inhibited
  by Axin. The family of downstream target genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway,
  (GT1), are transcriptionally activated by β-Catenin. The Notch pathway is based
  on the cell-cell interaction between the Notch receptor (whose level is represented
  by the variable Notch) and the ligands expressed on the membrane of the immediate
  neighboring cells (Ligandin). Since a successful binding between the receptor and
  the ligand leads to the cleavage of the intracellular part of Notch (Notch-IC) we
  use the minimum target function to model this interaction. We represent the level
  of the downstream target genes of Notch signaling as a single variable (GT2), which
  is activated by Notch-IC. Amongst these targets is the protein p21, which is activated
  by Notch-IC and inhibits Wnt. Wnt is an external variable of the cell. The downstream
  targets of Notch signaling activate the Jagged ligand.
