caption: Overview of peptide perception by different receptors. CLV3 can be perceived
  by CLV1 or CLV2/CRN and RPK2/TOAD2 (not shown in the figure) in the shoot apical
  meristem. CLE40 is recognized by different receptors in the proximal and distal
  root meristem (CLV2/CRN, ACR4, and CLV1). The downstream signaling components of
  these CLE pathways are not yet known. MKK5, MPK6, and calcium signaling might play
  a role. The pathogen infection signaling pathway mediated by flg22 binding to FLS2
  is better understood. Binding of flg22 to the receptor complex FLS2/BAK1 leads to
  activation of BIK1, which then activates downstream components such as RbohD or
  MAPKs. Floral abscission is mediated by the signaling peptide IDA, which interacts
  with the receptors HAE and HSL2. Receptor activation leads to binding to SERKs and
  to the downstream signaling cascade which involves MKK4/5, MPK3/6, and KNAT1
