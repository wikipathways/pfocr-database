caption: Potential mechanisms underlying RSs regulating the GLA immune-metabolic homeostasis
  toward NAFLD mitigation. The gut bacterial metabolites released after intake of
  RSs act as crucial molecules that interact with a broad range of sensing receptors
  along with the GLA. (1). Secondary BAs bind to TGR5/FXR receptors in the intestine,
  inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway to ameliorate NAFLD. (2).
  SCFAs binding with GPR41/GPR43 receptors in the intestine and hepatic activates
  PPAR-γ/AMPK signaling pathway to inhibit acetyl CoA carboxylase. As such, the production
  of glucose triglyceride and total cholesterol production is inhibited. (3). SCFAs
  can enhance the release of pro-peptide YY (PYY)/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
  by ligand binding with GPR43, which contributes to regulating appetite to maintain
  energy homeostasis. (4). SCFAs act as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to strengthen
  intestinal barrier functions, or elevate angiopoietin-like 4 secretions to reduce
  lipotoxicity and inflammation by potentially activating PPAR-γ. ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; AMPK, adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase; ANGPTL4,
  recombinant human angiopoietin-like protein 4; BAs, bile acids; CAT, catalase; FBA,
