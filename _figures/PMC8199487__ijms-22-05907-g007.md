caption: 'Working model of the mechanism of combination BMX with TMZ to overcome TMZ
  resistance in GBM-R cells. The model includes two main signaling pathways. The pathway
  on the right side: β-catenin/c-Myc/cyclinD1/Sox2 signaling pathway. When GBM-R cell
  lines were treated with BMX alone (thin lines) or BMX with TMZ (thick lines), GSK3β
  (S9) and active β-catenin decreased. The following c-Myc and cyclin D1 also decreased
  to induce cell cycle arrest and attenuate stemness activity, However, only BMX with
  TMZ (dashed lines) possibly induce apoptosis. The pathway on the left side: WT-p53
  mediated MGMT inhibition. When GBM-R cell lines were treated with BMX alone or BMX
  with TMZ, WT-p53 increased and downregulated MGMT levels, cell cycle arrest, and
  stemness in both BMX alone (thin lines) and BMX with TMZ (thick lines). However,
  WT-p53 and DNA damage marker (WT-p53-ser15, not shown) increased the following the
  activation of cell cycle arrest marker (P21) and proapoptotic markers (BAX/Bcl2,
  and Puma) to induce apoptosis and cell death only in BMX with TMZ (thick lines),
  indicating profound DNA damage. Color red indicated up-regulation. Color green indicated
  down-regulation.'
