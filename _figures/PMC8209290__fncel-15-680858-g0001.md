caption: Proposed mechanisms for neuronal damage during bacterial meningitis. When
  the pathogens S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae invade the brain,
  both the action of their virulence factors and the elicited neuroinflammatory response
  cause neuronal damage and death. (A) Pores in the neuron plasma membrane formed
  by pneumolysin (Ply), released by S. pneumoniae, result in the influx of extracellular
  Ca2+. At the same time, the interaction between β-actin, exposed outside the plasma
  membrane, with Ply and RrgA causes the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. This,
  coupled with the release of H2O2, oxidative outburst, and subsequent mitochondrial
  and DNA damage, results in neuronal death. (B) Several pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by microglia through receptors such as TLRs and
  NLRs, which results in the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  other mediators, and the recruitment of inflammatory cells. The establishment of
  a neuroinflammatory state inside the brain leads to neuronal death through different
  mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α overproduction or oxidative outburst.
  Ultimately, neuronal death results in neurological sequelae and potential long-term
  dementia; something that may be prevented if current antibiotic treatments are coupled
  with new therapeutic approaches based on immunomodulation and/or blockage of direct
  interaction between bacteria and cells.
