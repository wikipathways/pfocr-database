caption: Labeling percentage of measured soluble phenylpropanoids from the base of
  Arabidopsis stems supplied with 1 mM [13C6]-Phe over the feeding time course. The
  plot of each metabolite was placed above its name on the pathway. Dashed lines mean
  multiple steps. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 3). Black squares indicate these metabolites
  were in the first group of the hierarchical clustering in Figure S4, and grey squares
  indicate these metabolites were in the second group
