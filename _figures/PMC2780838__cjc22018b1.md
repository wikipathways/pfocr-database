caption: Schematic representation of the complement cascade. The various activation
  pathways are underlined and the heavy lines and arrows showed the progression in
  the cascade of activation. There are three activation pathways that converge to
  a common pathway to further progress into a terminal pathway. The names of the various
  inhibitors are in italics with dotted arrows pointing to their site of action. C4bBP
  C4b-binding protein; C1-INH C1-esterase inhibitor; CR1 Complement receptor 1; DAF

  protein; Protein S Vitronectin; SP-40 Clusterin
