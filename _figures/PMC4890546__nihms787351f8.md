caption: 'Schematic representation of the triple pulse stimulation (TST). (A) Experimental
  setup with three stimulation devices that are triggered at a defined temporal pattern
  by a synchronization device. A transcranial magnetic stimulation of the M1-Hand
  (1) is followed by an electric supramaximal stimulation of the distal peripheral
  nerve (2) and supramaximal stimulation at the Erb’s point at the proximal nerve
  pathway (3). (B) Schematic representation of the stimulation of different segments
  of the pathway in normal subjects. (C) Altered propagation of action potentials
  in peripheral nerves and the motor response induced by TST in the presence of a
  partial corticospinal block. (D) Peripheral stimulation with initial stimulation
  over the Erb’s point instead of the TMS of the contralateral hand area. Amplitude
  (AMP) of MEP from the intrinsic hand muscles. UMN = upper (corticospinal) motoneuron,
  LMN = lower (peripheral) motoneuron. AMPTST Amplitude after TST (modified from:
