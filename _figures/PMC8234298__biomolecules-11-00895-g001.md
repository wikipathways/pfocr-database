caption: 'Accessory proteins can be divided into at least four subgroups: anchoring,
  docking, adaptor, and scaffold proteins. All groups include several different binders
  of the RTK-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, such as RAF, MEK, and/or ERK, and often share
  common domains. Anchoring proteins include membrane-associated domains, such as
  pleckstrin homology (PH) and transmembrane (TM) domains or a posttranslational modification,
  (e.g., myristoylation in FLOT2) to determine a special subcellular localization
  and increase the dwell time of the proteins at the membrane. Docking proteins connect
  receptors with downstream effectors and feature receptor binding domains, such as
  PTBs (phosphotyrosine binding domains). FRS2, for example, interacts with the FGFR
  (fibroblast growth factor receptor) and links activated RTKs (receptor tyrosine
  kinases) with adaptor proteins such as GRB2 and SHC, and with other effectors, such
  as SOS1. Adaptor proteins can simply connect two proteins and often exhibit SH (SRC
  homology) 2 and SH3 domains. GRB2 is a well-known adaptor protein of RTKs and SOS1
  but can also, as mentioned before, bind to other accessory proteins and RTKs and
  fine-tune the signaling machinery and the cross-talk of different pathways. Scaffold
  proteins can simultaneously bind several signaling components. They can contribute
  to clustering events by oligomerization via special domains or intrinsically disordered
  regions (such as galectin 1 and 3), recruit proteins to the site of action (such
  as SPRED1), or determine RAS signaling at a specific subcellular localization (such
  as MP1, which binds MEK1 and ERK1 on late endosomes). Scaffold proteins are also
  able to bind other accessory proteins and allow tight control of the RAS-MAPK pathway.'
