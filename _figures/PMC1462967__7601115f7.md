caption: Model of the ATM–Chk2–p53 signaling pathway upon Brca1 mutation-associated
  premature aging and tumorigenesis. ATM–Chk2–p53 signaling pathway senses DNA damage/genomic
  instability and acts as a gatekeeper to eliminate mutations, but, as a side effect,
  it may also lead to premature aging.
papertitle: ATM–Chk2–p53 activation prevents tumorigenesis at an expense of organ
  homeostasis upon Brca1 deficiency.
