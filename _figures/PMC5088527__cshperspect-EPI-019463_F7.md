caption: Linking the circadian clock with the NAD+ salvage pathway. The NAMPT enzyme
  is the limiting factor in the NAD+ salvage pathway; thus, because the NAMPT gene
  is regulated by the circadian CLOCK:BMAL1 machinery, its product, the NAD+ metabolite,
  oscillates via this NAMPT transcriptional feedback loop. The HDAC, SIRT1, among
  other functions, acts as a repressor of the clock machinery by effecting deacetylation
  of the BMAL1 protein and histones at CCGs (see also ). Thus, whereas the enzymatic
  activity of SIRT1 oscillates in a circadian manner via the circadian controlled
  supply of its metabolite, NAD+, its activity also constitutes an enzymatic feedback
  loop for the circadian clock via its repressive activity at the NAMPT gene.
