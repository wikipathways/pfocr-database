caption: Positive regulatory signaling for Tfh differentiation. The signaling through
  T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory molecule leads to the expression of LEF-1
  and TCF-1 which binds with bcl-6 gene and upregulates expression of the master transcription
  factor BCL-6. The BCL-6 expression leads to upregulate the expression of Tfh cell
  surface molecules CXCR5, ICOS, and PD-1. Signaling through ICOS is spatiotemporal
  and involved in BCL-6 and IL-21 production. ICOS through FOXO-1 down-regulates KLF-2,
  which in turn cannot block BCL-6 and CXCR5 expression. ICOS also induces mTORc2
  which leads to degradation of FOXO-1. Ubiquitin ligase Itch also helps in FOXO-1
  degradation. Strong TCR and ICOS signaling is required for the recruitment of TBK-1,
  a new ICOS downstream pathway for Tfh differentiation. L-21 signaling through Vav1
  activates c-Maf that is involved in IL-21 production and CXCR5 expression. IL-27
  can directly induce IL-21 production. The CXCR5 expression is also upregulated by
  ASCL2 and NFAT2 binding to Cxcr5 gene. BCL-6 positively regulates CXCR5 expression
  by repressing the repressor miRNA-17–92.
