caption: The effects of Cordyceps militaris on the levels of the main molecules in
  the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in CKD patients. (a) Relative mRNA level of TLR4. (b) Relative
  mRNA level of NF-κB. (c) Relative mRNA level of COX2. (d) Relative mRNA level of
  IL-1β. (e) Relative mRNA level of TNF-α. (f) The concentration of TLR4. (g) The
  concentration of NF-κB. (h) The concentration of COX2. (i) The concentration of
  IL-1 (j). The concentration of TNF-α. All data were presented as mean value ± SD.
  There were statistically significant differences if ∗P < 0.05 vs. the control group.
