caption: Mechanism of action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive breast
  cancer. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 receptor to prevent
  it from being activated, decreasing the expression of the MAPK signaling cascade
  that results in a reduction of transcription factors’ transcription important for
  tumor proliferation. Pertuzumab binds to HER3, preventing HER2-HER3 heterodimerization,
  which inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K subunits, decreasing the activation of
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which in turn does not activate the transcription
  of transcription factors important for cell proliferation. [Biorender, 2025]
