caption: USP18 binding to IFNAR2 in vivo blocks the interaction between Jak and the
  IFN receptor, thereby reduces the phosphorylation of the receptor and STATs and
  suppresses signal pathway. The interaction between IRS4 and USP18 decreased the
  inhibitory effect of USP18 on Jak/STAT signaling pathway. Therefore, IRS4 enhanced
  IFN-α induced activation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway as shown by the increased
  levels of p-STAT1 and enhanced ISRE activity and increased induction of ISGs.
