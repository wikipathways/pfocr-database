caption: Schematic representation of biochemical signaling mechanisms involved in
  mediating pathogenic effects of R-loop-mediated DNA damage in neurodegeneration
  associated with neurological disorders. SMA and various disorders (blue ellipse)
  are associated with increased R-loops (green ellipse) and DNA damage. R-loop accumulation,
  UV irradiation, and presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among other causes
  of DNA damage. ALS4 (yellow ellipse) represents a special example of neuromuscular
  disorder caused by decrease in levels of R-loops, which is in contrast to SMA caused
  by increase in R-loop levels compared to controls. DNA damage response is mediated
  by activation of the JNK, ATM, and P53-mediated signaling pathways. ATM mediates
  phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) and BRCA1 leading to activation of DNA damage and
  repair response. Both ATM and JNK phosphorylate P53, which may independently or
  synergistically contribute to P53-mediated cell death in response to DNA damage.
  Activation of the JNK pathway contributing to neurodegeneration has been reported
  in SMA, various forms of ALS, AD, and PD.
