caption: Model of integrative signaling under hypoxia involving the ACBP1-RAP2.12
  hub. (a) Under non-stress conditions, cytosolic RAP2.12 protein is constantly destabilized
  by the oxygen-dependent branch of the N-end rule pathway (NERP). RAP2.12 protein
  which is sequestered at the plasma membrane by binding to ACBP1 can escape degradation.
  (b) A low oxygen concentration not affecting the cellular energy status inhibits
  NERP activity and results in stabilization of cytoplasmic RAP2.12 protein. However,
  dissociation of ACBP1-bound RAP2.12 protein is prevented. Therefore, only partial
  activation of hypoxic transcripts is achieved. Of note, a low oxygen concentration
  does not necessarily lead to a low energy status as long as the flux of oxygen into
  the cell meets up with mitochondrial demands. In contrast, oxygen shortage, i.e.,
  insufficient oxygen supply, will lead in either case to low energy. (c) A low energy
  status, e.g., caused by reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis or high cellular metabolic
  activity, modifies cellular acyl-CoA levels leading to a shift in C18:1-CoA/C16:0-CoA
  ratios. C18:1-CoA (shown as yellow circle) binds as ligand to ACBP1 promoting the
  release of RAP2.12. Due to the still active NERP, only a fraction of RAP2.12 protein
  reaches the nucleus to activate hypoxic genes. (d) Under a low oxygen concentration
  that results in an energy crisis, RAP2.12 is released from ACBP1 and gets stabilized
  upon NERP inhibition, leading to full activation of hypoxic gene expression. Kinases
  activated upon (mitochondrial) ROS, calcium or ATP signals potentially phosphorylate
  ACBP1 thereby further affecting its affinity towards RAP2.12.
