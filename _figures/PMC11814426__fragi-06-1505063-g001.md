caption: 'miMOMP activates mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway and promotes cellular senescence
  and tissue aging. ABT-737 promoted BAX activation and formation of BAX/BAK macropore,
  thus induced miMOMP and mtDNA release, subsequently activated cGAS-STING pathway,
  inducing cellular senescence and tissues aging. BAI1, as a BAX inhibitor, blocked
  this signaling pathway. cGAS-STING: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon
  genes; miMOMP: minority mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; mtDNA: mitochondria
  DNA; SASP: senescent associated secretory phenotype'
