caption: 'Immune therapy and targeted therapy of melanoma. aBy injecting activated
  dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor antigens, DC vaccination aims to induce
  tumor associated antigen-specific T cells. Antigen presentation by DCs and co-stimulation
  signals (B7-CD28) result in T cell activation and proliferation. bTo keep an immune
  response in control, CTLA-4 is then up regulated on the surface of T cells, which
  binds stronger to B7 than CD28 and causes an inhibitory signal. Blocking CTLA-4
  with monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab) enhances T cell activation. cBinding of
  PD-1 on the T cells to PD-L1 on the tumor results in downregulation of effector
  functions of T cells, which inhibits the killing of tumor cells. Blockade of this
  ligation by anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) makes it possible for
  T cells to maintain their antitumor functions, which allow them to kill tumor cells.
  dBRAF is a kinase that is part of the RAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway of cell proliferation. The tumors of approximately 40–60%
  of advanced melanoma patients harbor activating BRAF V600 mutations. The mutated
  kinase is constitutively active, which results in unregulated cell proliferation.
  This process can be blocked by selective BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib).
  eSingle-agent BRAF inhibition results commonly in progressive disease due to acquired
  resistance, which is commonly caused by genetic escape mechanisms resulting in MAPK
  pathway independant signaling. Upfront inhibition of both MEK (cobimetinib, trametinib)
  and the mutated BRAF kinases might counteract this form of resistance. (+) indicates
  a stimulatory effect; (−) indicates an inhibitory effect. Abbrevations: CTLA-4,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1; TCR, T cell receptor.'
