caption: Pre-treatment expression of TLR, RIG-I and IFN-beta pathway genes compared
  between the two patient groups. The pathways that induce type I IFN expression via
  TRAF3 and MyD88 are shown on the left and the pathway that is triggered by IFN-beta
  (JAK/STAT pathway) is shown on the right. Each gene is colored by the magnitude
  of mean expression difference between the MX1high group (n = 7) and the MX1low group
  (n = 30). Black node labels indicate significant differences (P-value < 0.01). Aside
  from MX1 as an established biomarker of IFN activity, other ISGs also showed higher
  levels of expression in the MX1high patient cohort before initiation of subcutaneous
  IFN-beta therapy. The elevated endogenous IFN-like activity of these patients is
  likely the result of elevated amounts of the transcription factors STAT1, STAT2
  and IRF9, which form the ISGF3 complex. DNA-binding sites for this complex can be
  found in the promoters of RIG-I-like helicases (IFIH1, DDX58), suppressor of cytokine
  signaling (SOCS) genes and the transcription factor IRF7, which were also expressed
  at higher levels in MX1high patients (see Additional file ). Other genes such as
  IRF3, the NFkappaB members, IFNB1 and the IFN-alpha/beta receptors were not differentially
  expressed.
