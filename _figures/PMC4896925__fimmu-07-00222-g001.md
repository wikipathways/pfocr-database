caption: Cyclic AMP immunoregulatory pathways inhibit TCR signaling and T-cell activation.
  In Teff, pools of cAMP are generated after binding of PGE2 to its cognate receptors,
  which stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and increases intracellular cAMP
  levels, thus, activating protein kinase A (PKA). Aided by an Ezrin/EBP50/PAG scaffold
  that holds both enzymes, PKA phosphorylates Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Lck
  to inhibit its activity. Lck normally acts to promote TCR signaling; thus, Lck inhibition
  through this PGE2-initiated pathway inhibits TCR signaling in effector T cells.
  Pools of cAMP can also be created by transfer from Treg to Teff through gap junctions
  (). As a hypothetical model based on studies in trophoblasts (), we speculate that
  this process may also require an AKAP bound to connexin 43 (Cx43) to facilitate
  PKA-mediated gap junction opening and cAMP transfer from Treg to Teff. Indeed, Pidoux
  and co-authors have found that ezrin binds to the C-terminal part of Cx43 and delivers
  PKA in the vicinity of gap junctions. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Cx43 by
  PKA promotes opening of the gap junction and allows the passage of signal molecules.
  The authors suggested the PKA/ezrin/Cx43 macromolecular complex controlling the
  gap junction communication could be a general mechanism that regulates opening of
  Cx43 gap junctions in response to a cAMP increase also in other cell types. Thus,
  gap junctions may also deliver a local pool of cAMP that can dampen TCR signaling
  pathways by the same mechanisms described above and contributing to the Treg suppressive
  capacity of Teff.
