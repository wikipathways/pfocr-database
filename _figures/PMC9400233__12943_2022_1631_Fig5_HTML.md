caption: 'The potential molecular mechanisms of correlation between five susceptibility
  SNPs and toxicities. Rs6711678, rs4848597, rs4848598, and rs2091255 implicated expression
  of INHBB, which regulates TGF-β/Smad/IκBα/NF-κB axis. In addition, 3D chromatin
  interaction indicated that they interacted with TFCP2L1 and PTPN4. PTPN4 belongs
  to the PTP enzyme family, which hydrolytically removes phosphate groups from proteins.
  PTPN4 has been reported to be a signaling molecule of STAT3. TFCP2L1 is a transcription
  regulating factor and reported to play key roles in regulating KLF4/ RHOF/NF-κB
  pathway. Finally, all three targeted proteins regulate NF-κB, which is a key modulator
  of inflammation, and correlate with skin reaction toxicity. Rs584547 was very closely
  located upstream of SYT8 and showed a proximal transcriptional regulation function
  on this gene. It was reported that SYT8 inhibited p63, FOXO, and p53 by regulating
  SIRT1, which in turn affected cellular processes of inflammation, DNA damage, and
  salivary gland secretion. SYT8 may mediate those processes to affect dysphagia.
