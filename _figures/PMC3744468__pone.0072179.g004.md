caption: 'Panel A shows the atom-resolved fate of 50% [1,2- 13C2]-glucose plus 50%
  all 12C glucose through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, both
  oxidative and non-oxidative branches). Also shown is the expected [1,2- 13C2]-glucose
  and glutamine oxidation in FH null (UOK262) or restored (UOK262WT) cells via glycolysis,
  PPP, and/or the Krebs cycle to produce energy (ATP and GTP), reducing equivalents
  (NADH, NADPH, and FADH2) and 13CO2 (from C1 of glucose, C4 of citrate and C1 of
  α-ketoglutarate). The reoxidation of NADH and FAHD2 via the ETC can produce up to
  5 ATP while 2 ATP are generated per glucose oxidation via glycolysis. The 13C labeling
  patterns become scrambled after the SCS step due to the molecular symmetry of succinate
  but the scrambled patterns are not shown. The consumption of NADPH by the reductive
  carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to form citrate is noted []. Moreover, Metabolites
  marked by red dashed rectangles had their 13C labeling patterns derived from [U-13C]-glucose
  shown in .The black circles represent 12C, while the red circles or stars and the
  green circles or stars represent 13C derived from the first turn of the Krebs cycle
  respectively without and with pyruvate carboxylation input; the circles with holes
  in them enclosed in brackets depict the corresponding 12C and 13C fate during the
  second turn of the Krebs cycle (note that 13CO2 can only be liberated from [1,2-
  13C2]-glucose starting with the second turn); blockade at FH is noted by a pink
  X, resulting in fumarate accumulation (cf.  & ); M1, M2, and M4 refer to the singly,
  doubly, and quadruply 13C labeled isotopologues; the enzymes are denoted in blue
  italics; solid and dashed arrows represent single and multi-step reactions, respectively;
  single- and double-headed arrows depict irreversible and reversible reactions, respectively.

  C shows the lower 13C enrichment in CO2 dissolved in the culture media of the three
  FH null cells than in that of the FH restored cell. This is consistent with the
  inability of the FH null cells to oxidize glucose in the second turn of the Krebs
  cycle due the blockade at FH, which leads to no 13CO2 release from glucose oxidation
  via the Krebs cycle. As such, it is reasonable to assume that a large fraction of
  the 13CO2 generated from [1,2- 13C2]-glucose oxidation by FH null cells is mediated
  by the oxidative PPP. For the FH restored cells, both Krebs cycle and oxidative
  PPP contribute to 13CO2 release. Δ13C was calculated as the amount of 13CO2 divided
  by (1000 times the total amount of CO2). The bar graph shows the mean values of
  three replicates along with the standard deviation as error bars. * indicates a
  statistically significant result (p<0.05) from a t-test.'
