caption: The metabolic pathway of glucose in normal cells and tumor ones. The schematic
  illustration shows the metabolic pathway of glucose in normal cells and cancer ones.
  It manifests the differences between OXPHOS, anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis.
  In quiescent normal cells, with the existence of sufficient oxygen, glucose is metabolized
  to pyruvate by which is transformed to acetyl-CoA by PDC for entering into the mitochondrial
  respiration. In the anaerobic microenvironment, pyruvate is reduced to lactate in
  cytosol. In proliferating cancer cells, enforced expression of PDKs phosphorylate
  and inactivate PDC, thereby shunting the pyruvate away from the OXPHOS by retarding
  its conversion to acetyl-CoA. 85% pyruvate in malignant cells are fermented into
  lactate and only 5% pyruvate enter into TCA cycle. The dashed arrows reflect the
  decreased mitochondrial respiration.
