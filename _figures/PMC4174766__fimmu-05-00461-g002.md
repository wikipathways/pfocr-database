caption: Intracellular TLR signaling and trafficking in pDCs. Activation of TLR7 or
  TLR9 in pDCs recruits MyD88 following IRAK4 recruitment. The MyD88 complex also
  contains TRAF3, TRAF6, IRAK4, IRAK1, IKKα, OPNi, and Dock2. MyD88 directly or indirectly
  recruits IRF7 to be phosphorylated by IKKα and/or IRAK1. Localization of TLR7 and
  9 is controlled by UNC93B1, PRAT4A, and AP3, which traffic TLRs from the ER to the
  endosome or the lysosome-related organelle (LRO). In the endosome, TLRs are converted
  to their mature forms by cathepsins, which cleave LRRs in the ectodomain. pDCs utilize
  a distinct signaling pathway from that in cDCs or macrophages to induce the synthesis
  of large amount of type I IFNs. gp96, a member of the ER-resident heat-shock protein
  90 family, functions as a general chaperone for most TLRs.
