caption: MR activation appears to be located downstream of Ang II/ET release and upstream
  of EGFR activation in the chain of intracellular signals leading to the SFR. Thus,
  EGFR transactivation does not originate from GPCR, as suggested previously by us
  () but from the MR to EGFR. Although our own data and those of ,  and  appear to
  support the proposed intracellular signalling pathway described in our study, the
  data would also be consistent with both EGFR transactivation and MR being required,
  although acting separately.
