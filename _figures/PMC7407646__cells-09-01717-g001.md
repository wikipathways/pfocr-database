caption: TLR4 signaling pathways activated in microglia during neuroinflammation.
  (A) LPS binding to TLR4 triggers sequential activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3
  with nuclear translocation of NF-κB and expression of genes involved in inflammatory
  response. The molecular mechanism triggering activation of caspase-8 is unknown
  at the moment. LPS can also activate the expression of inflammatory genes by means
  of (B) the MyD88-dependent pathway or (C) the TIR-domain containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-γ (TRIF)-dependent pathway with receptor-interacting protein kinase 1
  (RIPK1) ubiquitination. (D) Although not clearly defined in microglia, under deubiquitinating
  conditions, RIPK1 can form a ripoptosome-like complex that ultimately leads to necrosome
  formation and necroptotic cell death with release of DAMPs. (E) TLR4-mediated increase
  in gene expression of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein (NLRP3), pro-IL-1β,
  and pro-IL-18 is the priming stage of inflammasome formation. In the activation
  stage, the assembly of inflammasome complex activates caspase-1, which allows the
  maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 and their release through pyroptosis. (F) A noncanonical
  inflammasome has been also described in microglia that gives rise to caspase-8 activation
  and IL-1β maturation and release.
