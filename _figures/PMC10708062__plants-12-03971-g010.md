caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in citrate cycle pathway in roots under osmotic
  stress. (a) The expression patterns of the DEGs involved in pyruvate oxidation and
  gluconeogenesis. (b) Major pathway and key enzymes of tyrosine biosynthesis and
  citrate cycle. (c) The key enzymes and expression patterns of the DEGs in TCA. The
  green-labeled genes represent down-regulated genes. The color spectrum of heat map
  ranging from white to blue represents log2FC values from high to low, |Log2FC| ≥
  1
