caption: Figure 1. Proposed cross-talk between EpCAM signaling and the Wnt pathway.
  Activation of the frizzled receptor by members of the Wnt family of ligands induces
  the inhibition of GSK3β and the subsequent stabilization of β-catenin. Upon nuclear
  translocation, β-catenin controls Lef-1 dependent transcription. EpICD interacts
  with the very same components to form a nuclear complex comprised of β-catenin,
  FHL2 and Lef-1. This nuclear complex is licensed to bind promoters of genes involved
  in cell cycle regulation and stemness. Further research would be necessary to describe
  in-depth the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of Nanog, Oct4, Klf4 and Sox2
  by EpCAM. The actual composition of EpICD nuclear complexes recruited to the promoters
  of stemness genes are unexplored until now.
