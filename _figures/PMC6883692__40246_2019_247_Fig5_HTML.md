caption: Tobacco-smoking associated genes map to interconnected interferon and stress
  response signaling networks. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis network diagram connecting
  Sash1 with selected interferon signaling molecules and stress response transcription
  factors. Sash1 encodes a scaffolding protein in the toll-like receptor (TLR4) pathway
  and is upregulated in tobacco smokers in the present and previous studies [–, ].
  The Krüppel-like transcription factor Klf4 associated with smoking in other cell
  types [, ] was also included. Nodes highlighted in red were upregulated in models
  contrasting HIV+ smokers vs. HIV− non-smokers (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.15, absolute
  log2 FC > 0.25); edges denote previously described positive or negative regulatory
  interaction and associations

  therapy reveals effects of tobacco smoking on interferon and stress response systems
  associated with depressive symptoms.
