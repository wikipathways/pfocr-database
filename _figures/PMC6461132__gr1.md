caption: PRR signalling pathways. (A) Following TLR-mediated ligand recognition, MyD88
  is recruited to the TLR and a signalling cascade involving IRAK-4, IRAK-1/2, TRAF6,
  TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1), TAK1-binding protein 1 (), TAB2, TAB3 complex
  and IκB kinase (IKK)-β is initiated. IKK-β phosphorylates the NFκB inhibitory protein,
  IκBa, causing its degradation thereby facilitating NFκB nuclear translocation and
  transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 13 signal in endosomes
  via the TRIF-dependent pathway. Ligand-induced TLR activation initiates a TRIF,
  TRAF3, TBK1 and IRF-3 cascade. Alternatively, TRIF can activate a TRAF6, RIP1, TRADD,
  TAK-1, NFκB pathway. (B) CLRs signal either by associating with the ITAM-containing
  FcRγ signalling chain (Dectin-2, Mincle, Mcl) or through a hemITAM in its cytoplasmic
  tail (Dectin-1). Following ligand recognition, the hemITAM/ITAM are phosphorylated
  and Syk is recruited. A signalling cascade involving PLCγ, PKCδ and a Card9/Bcl10/Malt1
  complex is then initiated. This leads to IKKβ-mediated degradation of IκB to induce
  nuclear translocation of NFκB (p50, p65). MAPK pathways (ERK, p38 and Jnk) are also
  activated downstream of PLCγ to induce subsequent AP-1 activation. (C) NLRP3 inflammasome
  is activated via a CLR-Syk pathway. NLRP3 recruits ASC and pro-Caspase-1 to form
  an inflammasome complex. This leads to caspase-1 activation and Caspase-1-mediated
  cleavage of pro-IL-1β into functional IL-1β. Additionally, non-inflammasome forming
  NLRs such as NOD1 and NOD2 signal via RIP2 to activate the NEMO-IKBα-IKKβ complex
  to induce p50, p65, IκB and subsequent NFκB activation. In addition, a CARD9-MAPK
  pathway (ERK, p38 and Jnk) is activated resulting in subsequent AP-1 activation.
  (D) MDA5 activation by viral RNA, signals through IPS-1 to activate IRF3 and TBK-1,
  which in turn activates NFκB to induce IFN-β. Whether this occurs in response to
  fungal pathogens remains to be determined.
