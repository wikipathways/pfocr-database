caption: CEBPB increases inflammation/SASP independent of DDR pathway to promote senescence.
  Schematic of telomere-related senescence in DC cells. Deposition of 53BP1 and γ-H2AX
  is found on critically shortened telomeres leading to a DDR signaling pathway. This
  pathway activates ATM/ATR and p53 and ultimately leads to increased ROS and senescence.
  Alternatively, data supported by this research support the activation of a second
  pathway that includes mobilization of CEBPB and CEBPB-regulated genes related to
  SASP. When telomeres are elongated or CEBPB is knocked out, SASP gene expression
  is likely suppressed affording an extension of life span to these cells. Possible
  interplay between CEBPB, p73, and other genes found in the knockout screen are possible.
