caption: 'A working model for altered BMP signaling in FOP. The ACVR1 mutation that
  is present in the vast majority of patients with FOP is an activating mutation that
  can stimulate signaling, at least in part in the absence of BMP, but this activity
  might only be moderately ‘on’ under basal in vivo conditions, effectively raising
  the BMP pathway activation set-point and reducing the amount of additional activation
  that is needed to stimulate endochondral ossification. Triggering events, such as
  tissue injury and associated changes in the tissue microenvironment, enhance signaling
  and overcome the reduced amount of ‘activation energy’ that is needed to stimulate
  cartilage and bone cell differentiation; these events might induce a stronger response
  of longer duration than is normal, owing to the mechanism of mutant receptor activation
  or an impaired negative feedback response, or both. In normal, non-FOP tissues,
  the set point is sufficiently low such that the equivalent activation of BMP signaling
  does not have sufficient activation energy to overcome the threshold that leads
  to cartilage and bone formation, and normal tissue repair occurs, for example, in
  response to injury. Abbreviation: ACVR1, activin receptor type-1; BMP, bone morphogenetic
  protein; FOP, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.'
