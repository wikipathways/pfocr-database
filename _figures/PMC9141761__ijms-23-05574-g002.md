caption: 'Hypothesized mechanism through which impairment of BVR-A links brain insulin
  resistance with increased Aβ production in Alzheimer disease (AD). Under physiological
  conditions insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylates biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) on
  tyrosine (Y) residues promoting BVR-A kinase activity and scaffold functions. Through
  these activities BVR-A regulates the activation of insulin signalling. Moreover,
  BVR-A activation plays a critical role in the inhibition of beta secretase 1 (BACE1)
  recycling to the plasma membrane. The proposed path probably occurs at the level
  of the early endosomes where casein kinase 1(CK1)-mediated Ser phosphorylation of
  BACE1 favors BACE1 recycling to plasma membrane. Under physiological conditions,
  BVR-A inhibits CK1 activity, thus preventing the phosphorylation of BACE1 and the
  subsequent recycling at plasma membrane. Conversely, during the progression of Alzheimer
  disease (AD) pathology the increase of oxidative stress leads to reduced BVR-A Tyr
  phosphorylation and increased BVR-A nitration (3-NT) that (1) impairs the activation
  of the insulin signalling pathway and in parallel (2) promotes CK1-mediated BACE1
  recycling at the plasma membrane, where BACE1 cleaves amyloid precursor protein
  (APP), leading to increased beta amyloid (Aβ) production. In turn, as in a vicious
  cycle, increased Aβ oligomers trigger the elevation of oxidative and nitrosative
  stress levels, which further impair BVR-A. Arrows: activation; lines: inhibition.
