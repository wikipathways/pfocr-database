caption: A proposed mechanism by which LOXL2 causes fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.
  LOXL2 acts via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to activate TGF-β signaling and HIF-1 protein
  expression. GAL3 also activates TGF-β signaling, thus with possible similar effects
  as LOXL2. TGF-β signaling results in an increase in α-SMA, CTGF and LOXL2 expression,
  which leads to an increase in collagen deposition and cross-linking, resulting in
  fibrosis, ventricular stiffness and cardiac dysfunction. Inflammation causes an
  increase in NFκB which interacts with AP1 and Sp-1 proteins, also increasing LOXL2
  expression. Dysregulation of HIF-1 protein expression results in the disruption
  of oxygen homeostasis in the heart, also having pathological effects. Further investigation
  is needed to find out whether there is a direct interaction between LOXL2 and GAL3.
