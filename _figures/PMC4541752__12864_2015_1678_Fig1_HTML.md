caption: The biosynthetic pathway of MIA in C. roseus leaves. Simplified representation
  of the MIA biosynthesis in C. roseus highlighting the subcellular organization of
  the central steps of the pathway. Known single enzymatic steps in each cell type
  are indicated by grey arrows and abbreviation of enzyme names. Broken grey arrows
  and broken pink arrows indicate unknown enzymatic steps and metabolite translocation,
  respectively. DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) synthase; DXR, DXP reductoisomerase;
  CMS, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-D-erythritol (CM) synthase; CMK, CM kinase;
  MECS, 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEC) synthase; HDS, hydroxymethylbutenyl
  4-diphosphate (HD) synthase; HDR, HD reductase; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase;
  GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; GES, geraniol synthase; G10H (CYP76B6), geraniol
  10-hydroxylase; CPR, cytochrome P450-reductase; 10HGO, 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase;
  IO, iridoid oxidase; IS, iridoid synthase; 7DLGT, 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase;
  7DLH, 7-deoxyloganic acid 7-hydroxylase; LAMT, loganic acid O-methyltransferase;
  SLS (CYP72A1), secologanin synthase; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; STR, strictosidine
  synthase; SGD, strictosidine β-glucosidase; T16H2 (CYP71D351), tabersonine 16-hydroxylase
  2; 16OMT, 16-hydroxytabersonine O-methyltransferase; NMT, 16-methoxy-2,3-dihydrotabersonine
  N-methyltransferase; D4H, desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase; DAT, deacetylvindoline
  4-O-acetyltransferase. DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
