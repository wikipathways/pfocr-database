caption: MicroRNAs as major players in immune-mediated beta-cell damage in autoimmune
  diabetes. The figure reports a representing scheme of microRNAs (miRNA) response
  induced by infiltrating immune cells (mainly CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes,
  and macrophages) and secreted cytokines. The secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ
  induces changes in expression of several miRNAs. Specifically, upregulation of miR-146a,
  miR-34, miR-21, and miR-29s is shown. Each miRNA targeting specific genes (with
  consequent inhibition of their expression) is reported as a red dotted arrow, while
  the activation of a specific mechanism is represented as green dotted arrow. Upregulation
  of miR-146a induces the activation of apoptosis pathway through a not yet understood
  mechanism, while inhibiting the expression of Traf6 and Irak1 (NF-κB pathway). Upregulation
  of miR-34 leads to reduction of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 and of VAMP2, a molecule
  involved in the fusion of insulin granules to the plasma membrane. The increased
  expression of miR-21 leads to a partial protection from apoptosis through the inhibition
  of cell death inducer PDCD4. It also decreases expression levels of VAMP2, thus
  blocking insulin secretion. Finally, upregulation of miR-29s (miR-29a-b-c) leads
  to reduction of OC2 (Onecut2), a transcriptional repressor of granuphilin-4 (inhibitor
  of insulin secretion), thus leading to its upregulation and subsequently to a reduced
  insulin exocytosis.
