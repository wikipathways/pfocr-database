caption: The relevance of the sphingolipid rheostat in retina photoreceptors. Increases
  in Cer levels through the activation of its de novo synthesis or the SMase pathway
  trigger photoreceptor death; this death is also induced after Cer hydrolysis to
  increase Sph levels, mediated by ceramidase (CDase). In turn, S1P and C1P promote
  photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes
  survival by regulating the sphingolipid rheostat, inhibiting SMase or stimulating
  the synthesis of glucosylceramide (GlucoCer) to decrease Cer levels or enhancing
  the synthesis of S1P. Exogenous addition of C1P also promotes photoreceptor survival
  and differentiation.
