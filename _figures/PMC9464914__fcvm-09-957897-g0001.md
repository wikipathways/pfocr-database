caption: Overview of pinocytotic deposition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
  in macrophages. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase drives pinocytotic plasma membrane ruffling.
  Small GTPases are associated with trafficking and recycling of pinosomes, as well
  as with pinocytotic plasma membrane regulation, and have diverse actions in pinocytotic
  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol uptake in macrophages. While pinocytosis appears
  to be optimized in an alternative (M2) macrophage subset, certain elements, such
  as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signaling, enable the restoration of pinocytosis,
  even in an inflammatory (M1) subset. TLR4 driver lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can polarize
  macrophage differentiation toward M1 subset, and activates pinocytotic activation
  through unknown mechanisms. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 reportedly possesses
  similar pinocytotic effects in the cells. In the case of mmLDL-differentiated macrophages,
  cytoskeletal rearrangement appears to be driven through TLR4/Ras/Raf/ERK/MEK axis
  independently of PI3K signaling. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α upregulates
  calpain-6, a non-proteolytic isoform of calpain protease family, to inhibit CWC22-mediated
  Rac1 splicing. This interferes with endosomal recycling pathway, and in turn increases
  lysosomal processing of endosome-derived lipoprotein cholesterol to generate cytosolic
  lipid droplets. In contrast to M1 subset, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-differentiated
  M2 macrophages exhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent cytoskeletal
  rearrangement and membrane ruffling. Similarly, thrombospndin-1 enables to elicit
  CD47-mediated activation of PI3K and subsequent pinocytotic uptake of native LDL.
  In this case, it is likely that Akt3 negatively regulates Cdc42 and acyl-CoA cholesterol
  acyltransferase 1 to decelerate pinocytotic cholesterol deposition in the cells.
