caption: The fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF4) signal transduction pathway governs
  trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. FGF4 (and probably other mitogenic
  proteins as well) is essential for trophoblast proliferation. This mitogenic activity
  is likely mediated by E2f-dependent gene expression [,], and possibly directed at
  regulating the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) []. FGF4 deprivation
  results in down-regulation of Geminin activity to a level that maintains endocycles
  [], but that does not prevent down-regulation of Chk1 protein. The loss of Chk1
  kinase activity results in the expression of two CDK-specific inhibitors, p57 and
  p21 []. The p57 protein prevents the onset of mitosis by selectively inhibiting
  Cdk1 activity, thereby triggering the first round of endoreplication [,]. This event
  activates the G1-phase APC•Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase, which targets Geminin, Cyclin
  B, and Cyclin A proteins for degradation, thereby allowing licensing of replication
  origins and the onset of S-phase without passing through mitosis [,]. Inhibition
  of Cdk1 triggers both endoreplication and trophoblast stem cell (TSC) differentiation.
  In the absence of p57, FGF4 deprivation produces multinucleated trophoblast giant
  cells (TGCs), revealing the existence of alternative mechanisms to trigger TSC differentiation
  []. Endocycles also require p57, which is expressed during G-phase and then suppressed
  during S-phase to allow sequential assembly and activation of pre-replication complexes
  []. Geminin maintains endocycles by preventing DNA re-replication. The p21/Cdkn1a
  protein localizes to the cytoplasm in TGCs where it prevents DNA damage induced
  apoptosis []. It might also maintain suppression of Chk1 by reducing Chk1 RNA levels
  [], as observed during FGF4 deprivation [].
