caption: (A) Schematic presentation of the N-linked core oligosaccharide structure.
  The core is composed of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc, blue), nine mannose (Man,
  red), and three glucose (Glc, yellow) residues. a, b, and c are three oligosaccharide
  branches. (B) Schematic description of N-glycosylation, endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  protein degradation (ERAD), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Nascent
  polypeptides are translocated through Sec61 into the rough ER, where the core oligosaccharide
  is transferred from a dolichol phosphate onto asparagine residues in asparagine-X-serine/threonine
  (NXS/T) motifs (I). The two terminal glucose residues on the core oligosaccharide
  are trimmed by glucosidase I, (GI) (II), and GII (III), respectively, allowing for
  the association with the chaperones, membrane-bound calnexin (CNX) and and/or soluble
  calreticulin (CRT), which promote folding to a native conformation. Eventually,
  the last terminal glucose residue will be trimmed by GII, and the glycoprotein will
  attain a native conformation (IV), or misfold (VII). Glycoproteins that reach a
  native conformation will have the terminal α1,2-Man residue on the b branch removed
  by ER class I α-mannosidase (ERManI) (V), as a signal to allow it to traverse the
  canonical secretory pathway for surface presentation or secretion (VI). Polypeptides
  unable to reach a native conformation (VII) will engage in multiple rounds of the
  CNX/CRT cycle, facilitated by reglucosylation of the terminal glucose by UDP-Glc:unfolded
  glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) (VIII), and trafficking between quality
  control vesicles (QCV) (IX) and the the ER-derived quality compartments (ERQC) (X)
  under ER stress. Terminally misfolded glycoproteins will be demannosylated to remove
  all α1,2-Man residues (XI), followed by association with lectins osteosarcoma amplified
  9 (OS9) and XTP3-transactivated gene B protein (XTP3-B) for ERAD (XII). ERManI containing
  QCV are rapidly recycled through autophagy/lysosome pathways (XIII). Without interactions
  with client glycoproteins, EDEMosome components are degraded through an autophagy-like
  mechanism (XIV). Viruses can hijack EDEMosomes to form double membrane vesicles
  (DMVs) that serve as platforms for their replication (XV).
