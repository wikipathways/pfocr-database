caption: Mechanism of Wnt7b promoting renal fibrosis in AAN. When PCTECs are exposed
  to AAⅠ, the expression level of the Wnt7b protein rises. Subsequently, it is secreted
  extracellularly and activated by porcupine O-acyltransferase (PORCN). Once activated,
  Wnt7b attaches to receptors on the cell membrane, thus triggering the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. As a result, downstream proteins of this pathway are synthesized,
  ultimately promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PCTECs, which is associated
  with renal fibrosis
