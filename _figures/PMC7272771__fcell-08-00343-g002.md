caption: The ER implication in de novo membrane-bound structures and organelles. The
  ER is the specific site of vesicles implied in ER-to-Golgi transport, which notably
  requires COPII coatomers to deform the ER membrane. Peroxisome biogenesis initiates
  at the ER membrane via the recruitment of Pex family proteins and the maturation
  of pre-peroxisome is finalized in the cytoplasm. Accumulation of neutral lipids
  [triglycerides (TGs)] in the bilayer of the ER leads to ER membrane deformation
  and release of lipid droplets (LDs) in the cytoplasm, via the coordinated action
  of FIT and seipin proteins. In specialized cells such as hepatocytes and enterocytes,
  the ER is also responsible for lipoproteins [chylomicrons in enterocytes and very
  low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in hepatocytes]. In parallel to LD biogenesis, the
  TG accumulation in the bilayer leads as well to ER intraluminal budding of neutral
  lipid structures, via the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), and this
  structure will be stabilized by fusion with lipidated apoliprotein B (apoB48 in
  enterocytes and apoB100 in hepatocytes), which leads to pre-lipoprotein synthesis
  inside the ER lumen. This particle is then transported via the prechylomicron transport
  vesicle (PCTV) along the secretory pathway via the Golgi apparatus.
