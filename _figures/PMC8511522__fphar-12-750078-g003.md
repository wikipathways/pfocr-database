caption: Mechanism of the combined action of PPARγ and Tregs against AS. Tregs expressing
  PPARγ in VAT exert inhibitory effects on immune cells activity and prevents the
  occurrence and development of inflammation. Foxp3 is a specific molecule of Tregs.
  The ectopical co-expression of Foxp3 and PPARγ can induce an increase in Treg levels
  and the release of cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10 to inhibit inflammation and
  exert anti-AS effects. In addition, PPARγ indirectly induces the expression of Tregs
  by promoting the transformation of macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2 type
  and induces the secretion of cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10 by M2 type macrophages.
  PPARγ also inhibits the inflammatory response and plays a role in the anti-AS by
  activating the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway and inhibiting the Th1, Th2, Th17/Tregs
  ratio.
