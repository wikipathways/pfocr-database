caption: Microarray data for LLO118 and LLO56 T cells activated in vivo by L. monocytogenes
  infection were analyzed on D7 post infection for metabolic pathway differences using
  the program Genes and Metabolites (GAM), revealing significant differences between
  the two T cells. The pathways upregulated in LLO118 are shown in blue, and those
  in LLO56 shown in red, with the intensity of the lines corresponding to the level
  of transcription. The enzymes involved in each step of the pathways are shown. For
  clarity, the substrates and products have been omitted. The inset highlights a key
  branch point between LLO118 and LLO56 T cells, highlighting mGPD2 as a candidate
  gene involved for the observed metabolic differences.
