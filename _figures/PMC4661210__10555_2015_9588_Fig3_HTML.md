caption: The activation mechanism of NRF2 and downstream transcription events. Under
  normophysiological conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in an inactive cytoplasmic complex
  with KEAP1. Under oxidative stress conditions, ROS mediate the oxidation (ox) of
  essential cysteines in the NRF2-binding domain of KEAP1, which deters complex formation.
  NRF2 can be additionally oxidized at Cys183 by ROS under prooxidative conditions,
  which enables its nuclear translocation. Moreover, ROS can activate the ASK1 pathway,
  in which the MAPKs JNK1 and p38α/β phosphorylate (P) NRF2 at Ser40, leading to its
  activation. Subsequently, NRF2 translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with
  AP-1 transcription factors (Section ) and initiates the transcription of antioxidant
  enzymes (e.g., glutathione synthesis) and multidrug transporters (ABCC2, ABCC3,
  ABCC4, ABCC6 and ABCG2)
