caption: Mechanism of action of Amblyomin-X on tumor cells. The recombinant protein
  is internalized by endocytosis and transported by a dynein-assisted mechanism. Amblyomin-X
  inhibits proteasome activity, which results in aggresome formation via the non-exclusive
  ubiquitin pathway, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Unlike other proteasome
  inhibitors, Amblyomin-X promotes dynein-assisted autophagy inhibition and mTOR localization.
  Therefore, the aggresomes are not cleared. These factors are crucial for apoptosis
  machinery to trigger a cell response. Figure created in BioRender.com.
