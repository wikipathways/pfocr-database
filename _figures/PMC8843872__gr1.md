caption: The molecular basis of ferroptosis and the strategies for therapeutic induction
  of ferroptosis. (A) The lipid radical chain reactions triggered by ferrous irons
  (Fe2+) yield and amplify lipid radicals (L·) for the production of lipid hydroperoxides
  (LOOH). Free radicals produced by Fenton reactions oxidize phospholipids to yield
  L·, which in turn reacts with O2 to generate lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO·) for subsequent
  production of LOOH. These reactions can re-generate lipid radicals leading to excessive
  lipid peroxidation if remaining unblocked. (B) While the increase of the liable
  iron pool caused by ferric import through transferrin (Tf) and its receptor (TR-1),
  or ferritin degradation via ferritinophagy, can promote lipid peroxidation and subsequent
  ferroptosis, two major mechanisms respectively mediated by GPX4 and FSP1 serve to
  prevent lipid hydroperoxides from accumulation thereby suppressing ferroptosis.
  GPX4 is the only peroxidase that can reduce lipid peroxides, and its activity is
  regulated by the intracellular GSH level. System Xc− imports cystine for the production
  of cysteine and GSH, and thus plays a crucial role in the regulation of GPX4 activity.
  FSP1, on the other hand, may reduce CoQ10 for the suppression of lipid peroxidation.
  Multiple metabolic pathways, such as the mevalonate pathway and those for lipid
  synthesis or iron hemostasis, intersect to regulate ferroptosis. Accordingly, system
  Xc– inhibitors (e.g., erastin), GPX4 inhibitors (e.g., RSL3), and iron-based nanoparticles
  (e.g., ferumoxytol) represent the 3 major classes of ferroptosis-inducing agents
  that hold great promises for cancer therapy.
