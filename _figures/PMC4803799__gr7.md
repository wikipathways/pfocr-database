caption: Mitophagy. Mitophagy can be induced by mtDNA damage, mitochondrial electron
  transport chain inhibition, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial
  fission or fragmentation, mitochondrial unfolded or damaged proteins. Mitophagy
  is important for mitochondrial quality control and thus essential for maintaining
  cellular energy, calcium homeostasis, redox signaling, mitochondrial–cytosol or
  mitochondrial–nuclear signaling, and sequestration of apoptotic factors. One major
  signaling pathway is through inactivation of mitochondrial protease PARL due to
  loss of membrane potential, thus stabilization of PINK1. PINK1 recruits Parkin which
  ubiquitinates mitochondrial associated proteins. P62 recognizes ubiquitinated proteins
  and brings mitochondria to autophagosomes by binding to LC3. Parkin and PINK1 can
  be regulated by a variety of cellular proteins in many recent studies, including
  those listed in this diagram. Deubiquitinase USP8 plays an important role in Parkin
  recruitment to the mitochondria and mitophagy. In contrast USP15 and 30 remove ubiquitin
  from Parkin substrates and thus attenuate mitophagy. Parkin/PINK1-independent mitophagy
  also exist, including those mediated or signaled by BNIP3, Nix, FUNDC1 or cardiolipin,
  which can bind LC3 and directly bring mitochondria to the autophagosomes for mitophagy.
  In addition, mitochondrial spheroids and mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV) may
  bring mitochondria to the lysosomes for degradation. In response to loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential, choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) can also recruit p62 directly and
  target mitochondria to mitophagy.
