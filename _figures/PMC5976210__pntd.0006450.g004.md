caption: Cells were incubated with 200 μM [U-13C]-L-methionine for 6 hours. In addition,
  one sample group was incubated with 1.9 μM (10× EC50) AN5568. Metabolites involved
  in L-methionine metabolism detected in this experiment were overlaid onto metabolic
  maps. In cases where 13C isotopes were detected, graphs incorporating the percentage
  labelling are shown. The methionine salvage pathway (Yang cycle) is shown.
