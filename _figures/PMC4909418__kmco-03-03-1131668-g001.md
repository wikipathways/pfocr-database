caption: Smoothened-dependent and Forkhead box C1 transcription factor-induced Smoothened-independent
  Hedgehog signaling. The Smoothened (SMO)-dependent canonical Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
  is activated upon binding of Hh ligand to the cognate receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1),
  which enables SMO to activate the Glioma-Associated Oncogene Family Zinc Finger
  (GLI) proteins. The binding of Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) to GLI2 activates SMO-independent
  Hh signaling, which promotes expansion of the cancer stem cell (CSC) population
  and induces resistance to anti-SMO drugs.
