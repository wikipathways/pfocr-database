caption: 'Cadherin and integrin signaling pathways. A: Rodent β-cells. Activation
  of β-integrin receptors on β-cells leads to FAK-mediated phosphorylation of Akt/PKB
  that in turn blocks GSK3β to release the inhibition on β-catenin. The free β-catenin
  forms a complex with Lef/transcription factor 7–like 2 (Tcf7L2) to promote modulation
  of cell cycle genes and β-cell proliferation. It is uncertain whether integrins
  also act via MEK to promote ERK phosphorylation that might in turn activate the
  β-catenin pathway and/or directly regulate cell cycle genes. E-cadherins are proteins
  that have been shown to be present in intercellular complexes in islets. Activation
  of E-cadherins has been linked to the β- and α-catenin complex and promotion of
  proliferation via the β-catenin modulation of cell cycle genes. B: Human β-cells.
  Integrins, E-cadherins, and components of the signaling pathways detected in rodents
  have also been reported to be present in human β-cells. Integrins and E-cadherins
  have not been shown to be able to modulate proliferation in human β-cells. Gray
  lines are pathways that are known to exist in rodents but are unknown in human β-cells.'
