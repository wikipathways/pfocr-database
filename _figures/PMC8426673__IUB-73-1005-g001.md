caption: Binding COVID19 to ACE2 leads to suppression of ACE2 activity following augmented
  ACE2 shedding (via hyperactivation of ADAM17) and ACE2 down expression (via membrane
  fusion and virus entry into infected cells). It was hypnotized ACE1/ACE2 imbalance
  and augmented Ang II/ AT1 signaling besides in attenuate Ang (1–7)/Mas signaling
  pathway. Augmentation in Ang II/AT1R axis triggers servals pathways including PI3K/Akt,
  JAK/STAT, ERK/MAPK which leads to overexpression of inflammatory factors, HIF‐1,
  ROS, fibrosis factors. On the other hand, direct COVID19 invasion leads to tubular
  epithelial and podocytes damages. Altogether mentioned factors and changes result
  in acute tubular necrosis, interstitial inflammation, podocyte injury, microangiopathy,
  and hypercoagulation to result in organ injury and AKI associated with COVID19
