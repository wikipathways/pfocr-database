caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ) and the Wingless and Int-1 (WNT) signaling pathways during vascular
  calcification (VC) with a focus on the osteochondrogenic transition of synthetic
  vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). (A) Several mechanisms may inhibit PPARγ signaling
  during atherogenesis. First, ligand-bound PPARγ may sequester β-catenin, leading
  to the proteasomal degradation of this complex. As a result, a high activation of
  the WNT/β-catenin pathway could reduce PPARγ availability and vice versa. Second,
  WNT/β-catenin signaling induces the transcription of Cyclin D1, which promotes the
  recruitment of Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to PPARγ, inducing deacetylation, consequently,
  reducing the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. (B) Various naturally occurring
  compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
  the ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), as well as synthetic compounds like Thiazolidines (TZD),
  can directly activate PPARγ. Upon activation, PPARγ interacts with retinoid-x-receptors
  (RXR) to induce the transcription of target genes. PPARγ may dimmish WNT/β-catenin
  signaling through the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-three-β (GSK3β)—an
  essential part of the β-catenin destruction complex. Moreover, PPARγ induces the
  transcription of WNT scavengers like secreted frizzled-related protein 2 and 5 (sFRP2/5),
  as well as secreted α-Klotho (α-sKlotho), which results in an inhibition of SOX9
  and RUNX2 by scavenging WNT ligands such as WNT5a and WNT3a. The binding of dickkopf-1
  (DKK1), another transcriptional target of PPARγ, to lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) leads to a complex formation with the Kremen receptor (Kre),
  followed by its internalization and degradation, ultimately inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin
  signal transduction.
