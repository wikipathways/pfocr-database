caption: The chromatin remodeling enzyme Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) epigenetically
  regulates key enzymes in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. The pathway for de novo
  fatty acid synthesis requires the enzymes ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl CoA carboxylase
  (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FASN). ACLY is important for increasing cytoplasmic
  acetyl CoA to levels supportive of fatty acid synthesis. ACC is required for making
  malonyl CoA, which along with acetyl CoA is used by FASN to produce palmitate, a
  16-carbon saturated fatty acid that can be extended and desaturated into the extended
  family of fatty acids which are used for fat storage and for the biosynthesis of
  membrane phospholipids. BRG1 is important for the transcription of ACLY, ACC, and
  FASN in breast cancer cells. Knockdown or inhibition of BRG1 decreases levels of
  all three enzymes with resulting decreases in lipid synthesis and decreases in breast
  tumor cell proliferation. Proliferation can be rescued with palmitate supplementation
  (). Acetyl CoA is also the source of acetyl groups for histone acetylation which
  generally upregulates transcription and may cooperate with BRG1 in the regulation
  of gene expression.
