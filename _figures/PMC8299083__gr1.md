caption: 'C4 metabolism model in maize(A) NADP-ME decarboxylation pathway. The first
  step in the C4 cycle is the assimilation of CO2 into oxaloacetate (OAA) by phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase (PEPC). In the NADP-ME cycle, OAA is imported into the chloroplasts
  of mesophyll cells (MCs) and reduced to malate. Malate diffuses along its concentration
  gradient into the bundle sheath cells (BSCs), where it is imported into the chloroplasts
  and decarboxylated by NADP-ME. This reaction yields one molecule each of CO2, reduced
  NADP (NADPH), and pyruvate. CO2 is assimilated by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase
  (Rubisco), yielding two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) that can enter
  the CBC in either the BSCs or the MCs. The latter requires the shuttling of 3PGA
  and triose phosphate (TrioseP) between the BSCs and MCs. Pyruvate is exported from
  the BSCs to MCs and taken up into the chloroplasts, where it is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) by PPDK. This reaction consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphate
  (Pi) and releases one molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate
  (PPi). PEP is exported from the chloroplast and can enter a new cycle of the CO2
  shuttle.(B) NADP-ME as the main decarboxylation pathway in combination with the
  NAD-ME and PEPCK pathways. The NAD-ME pathway involves the conversion of OAA into
  aspartate by aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) in the MCs; it enters the BSCs and
  moves from there into the mitochondria. Aspartate is converted to OAA by AspAT and
  then reduced to malate by NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH). Malate is
  oxidatively decarboxylated by mitochondrial NAD-ME, releasing reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NADH), pyruvate, and CO2. CO2 enters the CBC as in the NADP-ME
  pathway, and pyruvate is converted into alanine in the cytosol by alanine aminotransferase
  (AlaAT). Alanine is exported to the MCs and deaminated to pyruvate by cytosolic
  AlaAT, and pyruvate is then used to regenerate the initial acceptor PEP, as in the
  NADP-ME cycle. The PEPCK cycle exhibits components of both the NADP-ME and NAD-ME
  cycles, but it has additional steps for decarboxylation and regeneration of the
  acceptor. In this cycle, part of the OAA from the initial CO2 assimilation by PEPC
  in the MCs is converted to aspartate, which is transferred to the BSCs. Aspartate
  is deaminated to OAA via cytosolic AspAT and subsequently decarboxylated by PEPCK
  in a reaction that consumes ATP. The products of this reaction are PEP and CO2.
  CO2 is assimilated by Rubisco as in the NADP-ME cycle, and PEP returns to the MCs
  as an initial acceptor.Abbreviations: ADP, adenosine diphosphate; CA, carbonic anhydrase;
