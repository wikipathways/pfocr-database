caption: 'A metabolic scheme depicting the involvement of different types of PLA2s
  in oxidative signaling pathways leading to neuronal impairment and glial cell inflammatory
  responses. This scheme is based on recent findings that in neurons and glial cells,
  specific cell surface receptors are coupled to the NADPH oxidase pathway in producing
  ROS and stimulation of protein kinases important in the activation of cPLA2 and
  release of AA. cPLA2 can target intracellular membranes and alter membrane physical
  properties and dynamics, including impairment of mitochondrial membrane, which triggers
  more ROS production and initiation of apoptotic processes. Although not well understood,
  these events may explain the underlying causes for the cytotoxic effects of Aβ.
  As shown in Box A, the NADPH oxidase pathway can also impact the NF-κB pathway induced
  by cytokines, and enhance inflammatory responses in glial cells. Box B: iPLA2s are
  abundant in neural cells and is considered a major source for the release of DHA.
  DHA is linked to production of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a neuroprotective agent.'
