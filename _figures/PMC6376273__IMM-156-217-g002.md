caption: Schematic representation of the pathogen‐derived molecules employed to evade
  the intracellular DNA sensing pathway. cGAS is a sensor of cytosolic DNA and the
  main activator of the adaptor protein, STING. Pathogens target cGAS for degradation,
  impede cGAS from binding DNA or inhibit its catalytic activity. Pathogens also degrade
  cGAMP, the second messenger produced by cGAS, as well as bacterial cyclic dinucleotides.
  IFI16 contributes to the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, and several viral
  proteins have been identified that inhibit its activation and promote its degradation.
  Other DNA sensors, such as DNA‐PK, DAI and AIM2 are also targeted by viral factors
  that block DNA binding and activation of downstream pathways. Pathogens also hinder
  multiple aspects of STING function through proteolytic cleavage, degradation, blocking
  its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to ER‐Golgi intermediate compartment
  (ERGIC) and preventing interaction with downstream signalling proteins, such as
  TANK‐binding kinase 1 (TBK1). DENV, Dengue virus; hAd, human adenovirus; hCMV, human
  cytomegalovirus; HSV‐1, herpes simplex virus 1; HPV18, human papillomavirus 18;
  JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; mCMV, mouse cytomegalovirus; WNV, West Nile virus;
  ZIKV, Zika virus.
