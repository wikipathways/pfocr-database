caption: Crosstalk between the p53 and sphingolipid pathways.The complex interplay
  of p53 with key enzymes of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in modulating DDR
  is shown above. The dotted red line represents the feedback mechanism between p53,
  CerS6 and C16-ceramide to amplify the stress signals in response to metabolic or
  genotoxic stress. The orange dotted line represents inhibition of caspase-2 by Chk1
  in p53-mutant cancer cell lines, and the green dotted box depicts that cellular
  outcome (survival, growth arrest or apoptosis) is dependent on the magnitude of
  DNA damage, extent of p53 activation and levels of ACER2 expression in cells.
