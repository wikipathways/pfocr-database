caption: The innate, capsule-specific serological protection conferred by the ficolin-2
  axis of the lectin complement pathway (LP). (A, B) The pneumococcal serotype 11A
  (panel A) and 11E (panel B) carbohydrate repeat units, which are polymerized into
  capsule polysaccharide. The dotted rectangle indicates the wcjE-dependent 6-O-acetylation
  (Ac) that mediates ficolin-2 recognition of 11A capsule. Blue and yellow circles
  represent glucose and galactose, respectively. Gro, glycerol; P, phosphate. (C)
  Epidemiological observations that support a model in which ficolin-2 protects against
  invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) by transmissible 11A strains, while selecting
  for the emergence of non-transmitted 11E and 11Av clones. NP, nasopharynx; OPK,
  opsonophagocytic killing.
