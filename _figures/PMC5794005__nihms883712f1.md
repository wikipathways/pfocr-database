caption: Binding of RANKL to the RANK receptor on the cell surface of osteoclasts
  initiates a complex signaling pathway which involves TRAF6, TRAF3 and c-Fos proteins.
  This activation signal, together with activation signals from ITAM-bearing receptors
  such as OSCAR, PIR-A and TREM-2, will modulate intracellular calcium oscillation
  which in turn induces NFATc1 nuclear translocation and turns on a cassette of genes
  related to osteoclastogenesis. It is well established that RANKL regulates osteoclastogenesis
  via the NFATc1/Ca2+ axis (-). Of note, many intermediate regulators in the RANKL-mediated
  osteoclastogenesis pathway are not depicted in this model for simplification purpose.
