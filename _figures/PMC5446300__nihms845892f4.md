caption: Bioengineering of CD8+ or CD4+ ACTeff cells with vastly improved capacity
  for homing into widespread, metastatic tissues is now possible by combinatorially
  leveraging and integrating new glycoengineering and genetic engineering technologies
  with the latest knowledge on immune cell homing and cancer metastatic circuitries.
  As shown, suboptimal and/or minimal native glycosylation of CD44 and PSGL-1 on ACTeff
  cells could be compensated for using a (1) cell-extrinsic GPS approach with requisite
  α1,3FT (e.g. FTVI or others) in generation of (2) E-selectin-binding CD44-sLeX (HCELL)
  and E/P-selectin binding PSGL-1-sLeX (CLA) homing determinants. GPS may advantageously
  generate additional, unidentified selectin-binding glycoprotein and glycolipid homing
  determinants (not shown). Consequent bimolecular association of HCELL with VLA-4
  via a Rap/Rac signaling mechanism, or of PSGL-1 with VLA-4 (not shown), would activate
  VLA-4 adhesion to VCAM-1 via a ‘step-2 bypass’. (3–4) Cell-intrinsic creation of
  HCELL and CLA is shown, whereby viral transduction or transfection of mod-RNA, cDNA,
  or CRISPR-based platforms encoding α1,3FT (e.g. FTVI or others) would result in
  its cytoplasmic translation, insertion into the golgi compartment, and heightened
  synthesis of sLeX-selectin binding moieties on CD44 and PSGL-1 (and possibly other
  glycoproteins and glycolipids, not shown) transiting the secretory pathway. Genetically
  introduced (5) CXCR1 or CXCR2, normally low or absent on ACTeff cells, would prime
  Gαisignaling and homing responses when bound by cognate chemokines, CXCL1 or CXCL8,
  expressed by melanoma cells (or by other cancer types). (6) Genetic overexpression
  of αVβ3 or Mac-1 (αMβ2), also normally absent or low on ACTeff cells would, when
  rendered fully active potentially by (7) HCELL/PSGL-1 ‘step-2 bypass’ biomolecular
  association or by (8) CXCR1/CXCR2 chemokine receptor signaling, bind a plethora
  of diverse tumor endothelial adhesive proteins as shown. (9) Lesional targeting
  and homing specificity could be improved through positive selection and/or genetic
  overexpression of multiple different TCR, TCRgm or CAR receptors (and co-stimulators)
  recognizing diverse TA’s and with capacities to activate integrins as shown. (10)
  Preconditioning regimens applied either prior to and/or following ACTeff cell infusion
  could synergistically enhance trafficking capabilities through augmentation of tumor
  endothelial or ACTeff pro-homing determinants, including adhesion molecules, chemokines
  and chemokine receptors, and TA. Incorporation of inducible suicide genes (to limit
  ACTeff-associated cytokine storms and inflammation), immune checkpoint blockers,
  and inhibitors of immune-evasive mechanisms, these innovative homing and effector
  enhancement strategies could vastly improve immunotherapeutic outcomes in advanced
  cancer patients with widespread metastases.
