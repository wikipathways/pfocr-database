caption: 'A schematic interplay of signaling pathways that influence/associate with
  AML drug resistance. The various molecular signaling pathways may very intricately
  involve in development of chemo-resistance including: neurotrophin signaling pathway,
  cAMP signaling pathway, TLR signaling pathway and estrogen receptor signaling pathways.
  JUN, AKT3, ARAP3, SORT1, GABBR1, and PELI2 are deregulated genes contributed to
  AML drug resistance. In AML cells under treatment, concurrent up-regulation of AKT3
  and down-regulation of Jun, downstream of all pathways, suppress apoptosis-induced
  JNK. JNK signaling is one of the deaths responses downstream of these pathways.
  Therefore, failure in JNK activation could be one of the main causes of chemo-resistance
  in AML. Up-regulation of AKT3 in PI3K/AKT signaling cascade induces expression of
  genes involved in cell survival, cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Also, down-regulation
  of Jun leads to decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Participation of ARAP3
  as well as AKT3 in angiogenesis can intensify resistance to chemotherapy. In neurotrophin
  signaling pathway, the high contribution of SORT1 with Trk receptors may have an
  oncogenic effect for AML cells and can promote cell survival. Downstream of TLR
  signaling pathway, PELI2 can activate inflammasome complex through concurrent of
  ubiquitination of two parallel targets, NLRP3 and IRAK1. The IRAK1 inactivation
  leads to the release of IL-1β and IL-18 through activation of inflammasome. IL-1β
  and IL-18 activation may be a distinct plausible important mechanism by which PELI2
  was involved in emergence of drug resistance. The Figure was created using BioRender
