caption: A. CYP26A1, CYP26B1 and LRAT expression are low in normal cells which result
  in the “correct” amount of retinoic acid and expression of retinoic acid target
  genes to maintain and promote normal cell growth and differentiation. B. CYP26A1,
  CYP26B1 and LRAT show significant overexpression in metastatic colorectal cancer
  cells potentially reducing retinoic acid levels and retinoic acid target gene transcription
  which in turn significantly alters growth, differentiation and promotes a pro-metastatic
  phenotype. Stra6, stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 receptor, this cell surface
  receptor promotes the intracellular uptake of retinol; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase;
  RALDH, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase.
