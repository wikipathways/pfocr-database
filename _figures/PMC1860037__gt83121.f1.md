caption: Interleukin 6 (IL‐6) can bind to both the soluble (s) and membrane bound
  (m) forms of the IL‐6 receptor (IL‐6R). On binding of IL‐6, both forms of IL‐6R
  can activate gp130 and subsequent downstream signalling pathways. The classic activation
  pathway (A) involves dimerisation of membrane bound IL‐6R with gp130. (B) In tissues
  where membrane bound IL‐6R is not expressed, soluble IL‐6R (sIL‐6R) can trigger
  gp130. This trans‐signalling is therefore responsive to localised concentrations
  of sIL‐6R. When triggered, gp130 activates Janus kinase (JAK) receptor associated
  kinases, which phosphorylate gp130 and thereby regulate the activity of STAT1/3
  and the SHP2 cascade. Among other effects, this triggers negative regulators of
  these signalling pathways, including suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)‐1
  and SOCS3. (C) Soluble gp130 (sgp130) can bind to sIL‐6R and prevent its interaction
  with membrane bound gp130. This effectively prevents activation of gp130 and subsequent
  downstream signalling events.
