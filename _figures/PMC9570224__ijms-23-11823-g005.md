caption: Schematic view of PLD-mediated events elicited in RPE cells exposed to inflammatory
  injury. (A) The PLD pathway is activated in RPE cells exposed to inflammatory injury
  to mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)-mediated
  inflammatory response, leading to a reduced RPE cell viability and phagocytic function.
  (B) Pharmacological inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 is able to prevent ROS generation
  and the RPE inflammatory response, resulting in a normal phagocytic function. Dashed
  arrows indicate possible but not fully elucidated mechanisms.
