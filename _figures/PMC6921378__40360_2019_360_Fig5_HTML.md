caption: Molecular models of the potential role of proteins involved in the Nrf2 –
  mediated response to NCC exposure. a NiSO4 allows the release of Ni2+ ion which
  increases ROS production in the cytoplasm, inducing 1) hypomethylation and HAT inhibition
  through increased HDACs and NCoRs activity, which reduces Keap1/Nrf2 dissociation
  and posterior Nrf2/ARE transcription, and 2) inhibition of DNA repair process; b)
  Ni3S2 uptake is facilitated via phagocytosis, delaying Ni2+ dissolution inside the
  cytoplasm. However both Ni3S2 and NiSO4 releases Ni2+ outside alveolar cells increasing
  production of Ni-protein complexes which acts as antigens for APC cells following
  differentiation to Ni2+-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing effector T cells,
  whereas inside the cell increase NF-kB transcription and proinflammatory response;
  c) Ni3S2 is capable of the release of high levels of the Ni2+ ion and ROS as a product
  of Ni3S2 mediated-phagocytosis. Retention of Ni3S2 and slow dissolution in endosomes
  are the primary cause of a possible chronic inflammation response. Ni2+ from Ni3S2
  can induce ER stress through the activation of PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 pathways. During
  ER-stress conditions proteins that fail the ER quality control are transported back
  to the cytosol where they are rapidly destroyed by the ER-associated degradation
  (ERAD) pathway. Additionally, redox status generated by Ni2+ regulates the nuclear
  activity of NF-kB proteins by altering the binding of NF-kB proteins to DNA in part
  via the Nrf2-signaling pathway. The absence of Nrf2 can exacerbate NF-κB activity
  leading to increased cytokine production
