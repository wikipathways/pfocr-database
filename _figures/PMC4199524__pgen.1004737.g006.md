caption: (A) The majority of white cells (a) secrete pheromone to facilitate opposite-
  and same-sex mating of the minority opaque cells. (i) When the majority are a/α
  cells, sexual mating between the minority of opaque a and α cells is rare. Opaque
  α cells secrete α-pheromone constitutively, while opaque a cells do not secrete
  a-pheromone without exposure to a certain level of α-pheromone. When both opaque
  a and α cells are rare, the threshold for pheromone and mating responses is typically
  not reached. (ii) When the majority are white a cells, sexual mating between the
  minority opaque a and α cells can occur. Opaque α cells secrete α-pheromone and
  induce the majority of white a cells to secrete a-pheromone. Thus, a-pheromone in
  turn induces opaque α cells to form long mating projections, which facilitate them
  to reach opaque a mating partners. (iii) White a/α cells do not induce mating projections
  and do not facilitate same-sex mating of opaque α cells. (iv) White a cells facilitate
  same-sex mating of opaque α cells. Opaque α cells secrete α-pheromone and induce
  white a cells to secrete a-pheromone. In turn, a-pheromone induces opaque α cells
  to form mating projections and undergo same-sex mating. (B) Schematic model depicting
  the crosstalk between white and opaque pheromone response pathways. First, opaque
  α cells constitutively secrete α-pheromone and activate the white pheromone response
  pathway to induce a-pheromone secretion in a cells. Then, a-pheromone secreted by
  white a cells activates the opaque pheromone response pathway to promote mating
  projection formation in opaque α cells.
