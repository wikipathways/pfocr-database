caption: Repair and/or tolerance of AFB1-induced DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. Upon
  AFB1 adduction to DNA, genotoxic AFB1-N7-Gua DNA adducts are generated that can
  be converted to FAPY adducts and AP sites. In our study, Rad14-mediated NER is suggested
  to play an important role in excision of these DNA adducts. Furthermore, Rad51-mediated
  HRR may play a key role in the error-free repair of AFB1-induced DNA lesions. The
  error-free PRR could also be involved in tolerance of AFB1-induced DNA lesions,
  possibly immediate replication blockage, and would then lead to error-free repair.
  Cell cycle checkpoints (such as Rad9) may have a unique role in the accommodation
  of DNA damage and regulation of the Rev3-mediated error-prone pathway. AP endonuclease-dependent
  intermediates are implicated as the DNA structure responsible for AFB1-induced mutagenesis.
  Rad5, a component of PRR, may participate in regulating mutagenic repair. In summary,
  DNA lesions may be channeled between high-fidelity and mutagenic repair pathways
  in our system. The dashed lines indicate the hypothesized relationships.
