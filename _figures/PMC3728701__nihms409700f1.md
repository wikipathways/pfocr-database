caption: Musashi1 (Msi1)-dependent activation of Wnt and Notch pathways as well as
  of proliferation in the intestinal progenitors. Msi1 is an indirect activator of
  the Notch pathway, acting as an inhibitor of Numb, a repressor of the Notch intracellular
  domain activity. By blocking the translation of Numb, Msi1 induces an increase of
  Notch intracellular domain, which translocates into the nucleus and acts as a cotranscription
  factor together with the CSL to activate Notch target genes, which are involved
  in the positive control of proliferation. Msi1 is also an indirect activator of
  Wnt, through multiple actions. It induces the decrease of the β-catenin-degradation
  complex proteins Apc and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK). This action increases
  the levels of stabilized β-catenin, which migrates into the nucleus, complexes with
  the Tcf/Lef transcription factor, and induces the Wnt target genes, which are involved
  in the stimulation of cell proliferation. The Msi1 gene itself is a direct Wnt target.
  Finally, the cell cycle inhibitor p21 is one of the Msi1 RNA targets. As is the
  case for Numb, Msi1 induces p21 block of translation. This represents an additional
  mechanism by which Msi1 is a positive modulator of progenitor cell proliferation
  within the intestinal crypts. Solid lines and solid arrows indicate a direct regulation;
  dotted lines and dotted arrows indicate an indirect effect. NEC Notch extracellular
  domain, NIC Notch intracellular domain
