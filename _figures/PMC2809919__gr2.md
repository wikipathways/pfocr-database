caption: Epithelial–mesenchymal interactions mediated by the Sonic Hedgehog pathway
  in the gut. Sonic hedgehog effects signalling between the epithelial and mesenchymal
  cell in the gastro-intestinal tract, and acts indirectly upon Foxf1 via its receptors,
  Smo and Ptch, and Gli transcription factors. The effects of Foxf1 are mediated within
  the mesenchyme, but there is currently much uncertainty surrounding the identity
  of the downstream effectors of Foxf1. Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; Ptch, Patched; Smo, Smoothened.
