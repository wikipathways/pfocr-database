caption: The Hippo signaling pathway is composed of neurofibromin 2 (NF2), mammalian
  STE20-like protein kinase 1/2 (Mst1/2) and large tumor suppressor 1/2 (Lats1/2).
  NF2, Mst1/2, and Lats1/2 are represented as red, orange, and brown ellipsoids, respectively.
  Phosphorylation of either Yes-associated protein (YAP) or transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) by Lats1/2 affects nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ.
  Transcription of DNA can be activated by palmitoylated transcriptional enhanced
  associate domain (TEAD) in the presence of YAP/TAZ. The palmitate group is illustrated
  as a yellow line within the blue ellipsoid representing TEAD. A TEAD antagonist
  could serve as a useful strategy for altering the TEAD-YAP transcriptome in various
  cancer cells.
