caption: Proposed model for the host translation regulation by HCV NS5A. NS5A enhances
  host translation through up-regulation of regulatory pathways and direct interaction
  with mRNA-binding eIF4F complex. NS5A activates mTOR through PI3K-AKT pathway. Activated
  mTOR enhances host translation through phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1, both the
  events acting positively on translation initiation. NS5A enhances eIF4E phosphorylation
  that also up-regulates translation initiation machinery. NS5A also associates with
  eIF4F complex and was detected in polysomal fractions. All these events augmented
  eIF4F complex assembly that is an indicator of enhanced translation initiation.
