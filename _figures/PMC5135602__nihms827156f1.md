caption: Mechanisms of PPAR-δ mediated gene regulation. Dietary fatty acids, synthetic
  small molecule agonists (GW501516), intracellular fatty acids and metabolites may
  activate PPAR-δ pathway. Two major models have been proposed regarding delivery
  of PPAR-δ ligands. First, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) can transport fatty
  acids to the nucleus. Second, ligands are produced in the nucleus as a result of
  nuclear lipid metabolism. Ligand binding activates PPAR-δ and leads to regulation
  of several important biological processes. First, PPAR-δ partners with retinoid
  X receptor (RXR) and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) to
  activate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (1). In addition,
  PPAR-δ interacts with β-catenin, which is a key transcription factor for cell fate
  determination and assists β-catenin to induce gene expression in order to modulate
  stemness in response to dietary cues like fatty acids (2). Lastly, PPAR-δ inhibits
  inflammatory gene expression by interfering with NFκB pathway (3).
