caption: 'Upstream regulators and signaling cascades linked to the hNgb protein interactors
  in a non-stress condition. (a) The top predicted upstream regulators of hNgb-linked
  pathways: nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3 (NME3), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2),
  cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1 (CREB3L1), transforming
  growth factor-alpha (TGFA), DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1 (ID1), transcriptional
  activator Myb (MYB), RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), insulin-like growth
  factor I (IGF1), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). (b) The ‘cell death
  and survival, cellular development, cellular growth, and proliferation’ pathway
  network shows the highest connectivity with hNgb-protein interactions. The latter
  are indicated as green in the figure. (c) Vimentin does not only interact with hNgb
  but has been identified as the hNgb-interactor with the highest number of predicted
  connections itself. These provide an indirect link with/influence on hNgb functions.'
