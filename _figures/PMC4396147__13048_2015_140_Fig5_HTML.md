caption: 'Interconnected altered metabolic pathways. Altered metabolites from the
  top 6 MetaboAnalyst analysis and the top 3 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis are charted
  within their own metabolic pathway along with their cross-participation in other
  metabolic pathways. RED text metabolites represent elevated mean intensity in C200
  cells compared to A2780 cells, whereas GREEN text represent reduced intensity. Abbreviations:
  CoA: Coenzyme A; THF: tetrahydrofolate; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSSH: oxidized
  glutathione; UDP: uridine diphosphate.'
