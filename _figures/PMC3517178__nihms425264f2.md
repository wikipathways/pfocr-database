caption: 'Microarray gene expression profiling analysis of primary WT/FFAA diploid
  control cells (O), or tumor cells with limited expansion (B) or unlimited expansion
  (A). Microarray hybridization data analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway analysis identified
  significantly relevant disorders and up-regulated or down-regulated gene networks
  or pathways, compared to the diploid control. Red circles, up-regulated genes; green
  circles, down-regulated genes; solid lines, physical interaction; arrows with dashed
  lines, induction of gene expression; arrows with solid lines, activation. The degree
  of the change in expression is qualitatively reflected by the darkness of the color.
