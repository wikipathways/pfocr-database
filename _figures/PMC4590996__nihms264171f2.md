caption: 'Low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides (depicted as blue
  squares) are released from the ECM as a result of trauma and regulated by the balance
  of hyaluronidase inhibitors and hyaluronidase. These oligosaccharides bind to TLR4
  along with coaccessory molecules lymphocyte antigen 96 (MD2) and the CD44 receptor.
  This receptor complex utilizes ERM proteins and MyD88. Ras and NF-κB are upregulated,
  which leads to downstream production of effectors including MMP-13, TGF-β2, SOCS3
  and inflammatory cytokines. By contrast, Gram-negative bacteria release membrane
  fragments containing LPS (depicted as red hexagons). The fragments bind to LBP,
  which bind to TLR4s that require CD14 and MD2. Ligand binding to TLR4 activates
  certain protein kinases (e.g., IRAK, TRAFs and TBK1) that amplify the signal, leading
  to the inflammatory response and its modulation of the ECM, cell signaling molecules,
  stress response and immunity related changes. The summation of these protein responses,
  which result in the final common pathway, may lead to phenotype primary open-angle
  glaucoma. Certainly, the important feature of this figure is the initial activation
  of the TLR4 and subsequent downstream effects. Shown in this figure are proposed
  signaling pathways and components based on the work of several groups. Please note
  that both pathways lead to the activation of NF-κB, TRIF, TRAM, Mal, ERK, RIP1,
  IRF-3, JNK and MIP-2. ERM: Ezrin, radixin, moesin; HAS: Hyaluronic acid synthetase;

  protein 2; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary
