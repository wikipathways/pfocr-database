caption: 'Schematic overview of Hedgehog signaling and rationale for combination therapy
  with (chemo)radiotherapy. Upon Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand binding to its receptor
  Patched (Ptch1) 1, the repression of Smoothened (Smo) is relieved, resulting in
  the movement of Smo from the intracellular vesicles to the primary cilium. Smo becomes
  activated and promotes the activation of the Gli proteins (Gli1/2) that enter the
  nucleus and promote transcription of the target genes (canonical pathway activation).
  The Gli transcription factors can also become activated by means of non-canonical
  pathway activation due to significant crosstalk with other important pathways such
  as the PI3K-Akt, KRAS, PKC-δ and TGFβ pathways. The Hh signaling also has important
  interactions with Wnt pathway and P53. The response to radiation therapy is determined
  by the four R’s of radiobiology: repopulation, repair of sublethal DNA damage, redistribution
  and reoxygenation. Hh signaling can potentially interfere with all these processes
  and targeting Hh signaling could therefore increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells.
  Moreover, inhibition of Hh signaling could also improve the response to chemotherapy
  by targeting multidrug resistance and cancer stems cells in addition to its effects
  on tumor vasculature. Abbreviations: PC, primary cilia; MDR, multidrug resistance;
  CSCs, cancer stem cells.'
