caption: 'M.tb infection activates the inflammatory response resulting in pro-inflammatory
  cytokines secretion. Along with M.tb, these cytokines can trigger the kynurenine
  pathway by stimulating IDO. Once the pathway is activated, astrocytes and microglia
  respectively produce kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid, the latter is neurotoxic.
  Thus, an imbalance in the synthesis of these two products may result in neurotoxicity.
  Vitamin D, cofactor of TPH, promotes serotonin production and neurotransmission.
  Alone or when bound with one of its receptor, VDR, vitamin D attenuates the inflammatory
  response. M.tb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; IDO: indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase; TPH:
  tryptophan hydrolase; KAT: kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO: kynurenine-3-monooxygenase;
  3-HAO: 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase; NMDA: N-methyl-d-aspartate; VDR: vitamin
  D receptor. Blue: neuroprotection; red: neurotoxicity; green: influential factors.'
