caption: NFKB1 p105/p50 regulation of gene expression in cancer. Following inflammatory
  stimulation, IKK functions as the key activator of the NFKB1 signalling pathway.
  Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB releases p50:p65 dimers which can drive
  the transcription of tumour-promoting inflammatory genes and anti-apoptotic and
  proliferative genes. p50 phosphorylation at the S329 site impairs p50:p65 dimer
  binding to DNA, decreasing Bcl-xL expression leading to increased apoptosis, hindering
  cancer progression. p105 phosphorylation and ubiquitination leads to its processing
  by the 26S proteasome, releasing p50 homodimers. The p50:p50:HDAC1 complex represses
  tumour-promoting inflammatory gene expression thus acting as a tumour-suppressor
  complex, while p50 homodimers in complex with Bcl-3 or BAG-1 can drive proliferation.
  In macrophages, aberrant p50 homodimer repression of CXCL10 and IL-12 leads to impaired
  M1 polarisation. Whilst p50:p50 repression of pro-inflammatory and proliferative
  mediators can also promote tumour suppression.
