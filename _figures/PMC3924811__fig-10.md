caption: A schematic representation of the actions of mechanical signals on the regulation
  of distinct signaling pathways in health and inflammation. In healthy bones, physiological
  levels of mechanical signals act as anabolic signals, and promote bone formation
  via activation of the SMAD 1/5/8 signaling pathway that is required for the induction
  of BMPs, osteogenic transcription factors (RUNX-2) and proteins necessary for bone
  formation (ALKP, COL-IαI, OCN). Simultaneously, mechanotransduction suppresses SOST
  induction to allow bone formation via the Wnt signaling pathway. During inflammation,
  physiological levels of mechanical signals suppress the NF-κB signaling cascade
  to block expression of NO, cytokines and MMPs, and inhibit catabolic actions of
  proinflammatory mediators. Simultaneously, mechanical signals upregulate the synthesis
  of osteogenic molecules that are suppressed during inflammation to initiate repair.
  The wide (yellow in online version) arrows indicate the known steps that up or down
  regulate mechanosignaling in response to various magnitudes of strains. COL-1α1,
  collagen type 1α1. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to
