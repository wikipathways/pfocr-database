caption: 'Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the TIA pathway and
  influence of environmental factors on TIA biosynthesis. Top panel: complex regulation
  of the TIA pathways. Environmental factors, such as herbivores, pathogens, UV, and
  temperature influence TIA biosynthesis by modulating the expression of TFs (e.g.,
  ORCA3 and MYC2) and pathway genes. ORCAs (ORCA2, ORCA, ORCA4, ORCA5, and ORA6) and
  BIS’ (BIS1, BIS2, and BIS3) are present as clusters in C. roseus genome and exhibit
  intra-cluster regulation (e.g., ORCA5 activates ORCA3 and 4). The ORCAs, CrMYC2,
  BIS’, CrWRKY1, and CrGATA1 are transcriptional activators, whereas GBFs, ZCTs, JAZs,
  RMT and CrPIF1 are repressors of the TIA pathway. Middle panel: selective and post-translational
  regulations of upstream and midstream pathway genes. CrMYC2, ORCAs, and CrWRKY1
  regulate upstream indole branch and the midstream pathway genes (from TDC to MAT),
  whereas BIS’ regulate the iridoid branch genes (from GES to 7DLH). Many TFs are
  phosphorylated, leading to functional alteration. The MAPKK1-MPK3 cascade phosphorylate
  CrMYC2 and ORCAs to regulate their activity. MPK3 expression and kinase activity
  are induced by pathogens (including fungal endophytes) and temperature. GBFs repress
  the activities of ORCA3 and BIS1. RMT1 represses the ORCA3 activity on target gene
  promoters. Lower panel: light regulation of the vindoline pathway. CrGATA1 and CrPIF1
  regulate the downstream vindoline pathway. Light (in particular, red light) activates
  CrGATA1, while causes the degradation of CrPIF1, a repressor of CrGATA1. Protein-protein
  interaction between CrMYC2-GBFs, CrMYC2-JAZs, RMT-JAZ, and BIS1-BIS2 are indicated
  by dotted lines. Solid blue arrows indicate direct activation, dotted arrows indicate
  indirect or unclarified activation, and T-bars represent repression. Phosphorylation
  of ORCAs and MYC2 is indicated by circled P. BIS1/2/3 bHLH iridoid synthesis 1/2/3,
