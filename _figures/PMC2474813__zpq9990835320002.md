caption: Proteomics-based metabolic pathway reconstruction for the mature sugarbeet
  seed. Red arrows and numbers correspond to biochemical functions identified by functional
  gene ontology annotation () from the proteome of mature sugarbeet seed (Table S2
  and Table S4). Colored blocks represent known metabolic modules (). Black arrows
  represent individual functions undetected in the metabolic modules. Dotted black
  lines represent several consecutive functions undetected in these modules. Gray
  arrows materialize transfers of metabolites between different modules.
