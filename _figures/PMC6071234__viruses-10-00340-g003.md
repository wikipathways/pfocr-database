caption: '(Left) panel: in the absence of viperin, TBEV replicates efficiently inside
  membrane vesicular structures in the ER. Assembled virions are secreted through
  the secretory pathway in a COPII and COPI dependent manner. (Right) panel: in the
  presence of viperin, TBEV replication is strongly reduced by viperin. Viperin targets
  the NS3 protein for proteasomal degradation which inhibits the synthesis of + strand
  RNA. Furthermore, NS3 interacts with E, NS2A, and NS2B and these proteins are degraded
  by viperin in a NS3-dependent manner. Viperin also interferes with particle assembly
  by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII-dependent manner, independent of
  COPI. Viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1. Red arrow
  = secretory pathway, blue arrow = “?” vesicular transport via unknown pathway.'
