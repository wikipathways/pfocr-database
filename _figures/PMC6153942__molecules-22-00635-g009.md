caption: Non-canonical cellular responses triggered by high doses of CTS. Elevation
  of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio triggered by inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) by
  CTS or K+-free medium affect transcription and translation via unknown [Na+]i and/or
  [K+]i sensors S1 and S2, respectively, that, in turn, leads to inhibition of apoptosis
  in rodent cells expressing α1R-Na+,K+-ATPase. In epithelial cells, elevation of
  the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio attenuates tight junction and cell adhesion via monovalent
  ion sensors S3 and S4, respectively. Interaction of CTS with the Na+,K+-ATPase also
  leads to conformation transition and interaction with diverse adaptor proteins (AP),
  including Src, PI3K and InsP3R. In cells expressing α1S-Na+,K+-ATPase, it results
  in the activation of p38 MAPK and the oncotic mode of cell death. Unlike the suppression
  of apoptosis, K+-free medium does not trigger oncosis, suggesting that the increased
  [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio contributes to this signaling pathway via the hypothetical sensor
  S5. The role of Na+i,K+i-independent signals in cellular responses triggered via
  adaptor proteins (AP) and unknown intermediates (?) should be examined further.
