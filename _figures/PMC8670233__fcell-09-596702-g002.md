caption: Tropoelastin secretory/assembly pathway. The synthesis of tropoelastin begins
  with the transcription of the ELN gene in the nucleus. In the endoplasmic reticulum,
  tropoelastin interacts with EBP and folds in structure. After the storage and transport
  of Golgi, the complex of EBP and tropoelastin is secreted to the cell surface for
  self-assembly. Then, tropoelastin dissociates from EBP and deposits onto the microfibril
  scaffold. In the presence of LOX, tropoelastin cross-links and eventually forms
  mature elastic fibers.
