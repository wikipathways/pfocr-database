caption: Summary of the proposed IP3‐mediated signaling pathway that maintains intercellular
  communication in the vascular endothelium. (1) IP3 activates IP3R on the endoplasmic
  reticulum within the initiating cell, releasing Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. (2) The
  signal is passed through to the receiving cell via a transmembrane signaling unit,
  in a process of “Inside‐out signaling.” Since IP3 is required for signal transmission,
  we hypothesize that this is mediated by pore dead IP3Rs, clustered at the membrane.
  (3) This inside‐out signal activates a GPCR on the receiving cell membrane, in an
  “Outside‐in signaling” process, releasing the Gαq/11 subunit to bind to PLC, allowing
  it to mediate the breakdown of PIP2 into free IP3 and DAG in the receiving cell
  cytoplasm. This is regenerative IP3 production. (4) Newly‐generated IP3 then binds
  the IP3R on the ER in the receiving cells, releasing Ca2+ and starting the regenerative
  process over again to propagate the signal along the vascular endothelium
