caption: 'Routes of presentation of viral peptides on DCs. Viruses can enter cells
  by two ways: some viruses can infect cells directly, leading to replication of virus
  inside the cells. During this process, some of the viral proteins will be degraded
  into peptide fragments, which will be presented on MHC class I molecules to CD8+
  T cells (I). APCs, such as DCs can also take up viral particles or remnants of virally
  infected cells (II). During processing by professional APCs, viral peptides can
  be presented on MHC class I molecules via the cross-presentation pathway (III).
  In parallel, these extracellular-derived peptides will be presented on MHC class
  II molecules. The TCR of virus-specific CD4+ T can recognize MHC class II-peptide
  complexes on professional APCs. Next to the interaction of the MHC class II-peptide
  complex with the TCR, CD4+ T cells can activate DCs by interaction of CD40 with
  CD40 ligand on the DC (IV). This interaction activates DCs and results in upregulation
  of maturation markers CD80/CD86. CD80 and CD86 interact with CD28 on naïve CD8+
  T cells (V). Together with the recognition of the MHC class I-peptide complex by
  the TCR, CD28 signaling will result in the activation of the CD8+ T cell (VI). These
  activated CD8+ T cells will differentiate into effector T cells that can recognize
  the MHC class I-peptide complex on virally infected cells. Binding of the TCR to
  the MHC class I-peptide complex leads to activation of the CD8+ T cell and the release
  of cytotoxic granules containing perforins and granzymes, and the production of
  cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ (VII).'
