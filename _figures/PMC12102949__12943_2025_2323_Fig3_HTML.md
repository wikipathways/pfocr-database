caption: 'Multiple Cross-linking Mechanisms among Tumor Cells or/and the Surrounding
  Environment Sustain the Formation and Persistence of DTPs under Targeted Therapy
  and Immunotherapy. A Inter-crosstalk among Tumor Cells: a) In DTPs, cytochrome c
  is released via caspase-independent MOMP to activate HRI kinase, which in turn promotes
  ATF translation and enhances ISR. Tolerant tumor cell-derived exosomes, such as
  microRNAs and proteins, facilitate DTPs to avoid various types of death. b) In contrast,
  treatment-induced death-sensitive cells release debris or clusters containing various
  splicosomal proteins to alter mRNA splicing of cell cycle-related proteins or activate
  PI3 K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Dying sensitive cells release PGE2 and arachidonic acid
  in a caspase- 3-dependent manner, which activate WNT-β-catenin within DTPs and ultimately
  stimulate resistance. B Inter-crosstalk between Tumor Cell and Environment: (i)
  Tumor infiltering immune cells: c) The over-expressed PD-L1, PD-L2, and CD70 on
  tumor cells can inhibit recognition by immune cells and impedes immune elimination
  of tumor cells. d) Treatment-induced CD8 + T cells can produce IFN-γ, which can
  enhance cross-resistance of DTPs. Treatment also promotes regulatory T cell elimination,
  M1 conversion of macrophage and MHC class I and II antigen presentation of dendritic
  cells. A unique EOMES + CD8 + T cell has been identified. (ii) Extracellular matrix:
  e) Stromal cells secrete pro-survival HGF, which recruits neutrophils and activates
  HGF receptor MET, thereby providing a favorable situation to DTP formation. The
  extensive collagen and fibronectin constitute the ECM with high stiffness, which
  can reduce the penetration of drug into tumor cells and promotes DTP production.
  Tumor cells adhere to collagen and interact with integrin-β1 to drive drug resistance.
  f) Cluster 0 CAFs, PLA2G2 CAFs, FGFR4 CAFs and OIT3 endothelial cells play a crucial
  role in mediating tumor DTPs survival. Cluster 0 CAFs can secrete growth factors
  (IL- 6, TNFSF9, FGF7) and immune-modulatory factors (CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL12). Image
