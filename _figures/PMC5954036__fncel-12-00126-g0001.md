caption: Autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) pathways
  under normal and pathological conditions. Proteins are tagged with ubiquitin conjugates
  through a sequential enzymatic mechanism involving three classes of enzymes, E1,
  E2 and E3. Under normal conditions, ubiquitylated substrates are recognized by ubiquitin
  receptors present in ALP and UPS pathways and efficiently eliminated. In the UPS,
  substrates are subsequently deubiquitylated by RPN11, a key step for substrate degradation
  and amino acid recycling. Free-Ub chains formed by RPN11 activity promote ALP function.
  Ubiquitin receptors in the ALP, in contrast to the UPS, form oligomers to facilitate
  substrate recognition and autophagosomal recruitment. Under aging and Alzheimer’s
  disease conditions there is a decrease in the function of the ALP and the UPS that
  reduces substrate degradation and amino acid recycling. Downregulation of RPN11
  in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) decreases free-Ub chains disrupting substrate recognition,
  their recruitment into autophagosomes and their final degradation by the ALP. Altogether,
  leading to the accumulation of deleterious protein aggregates. Transcriptional regulation
  (Nrf1/2) and phosphorylation (kinases/phosphatases) play a crucial role in ALP and
  UPS function whereas their dysregulation is the focus of intense studies in aging
  and Alzheimer’s disease.
