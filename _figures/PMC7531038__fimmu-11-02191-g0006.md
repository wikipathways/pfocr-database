caption: 'Possible intracellular signaling pathways activated in chondrocytes upon
  treatment with pararama hair extract. (A) Activation of cells by the complement
  system or by the interaction between low molecular weight hyaluronan and TLR2/TLR4.
  (B) Activation of cells by the interaction between low molecular weight hyaluronan
  and CD44 or by interaction between TGF-β receptors and TGF-β1. Illustration based
  on the data obtained with the use of the MetaCore pathway analysis tool (GeneGO/Thomson
  Reuters) and enriched with DEGs, which are highlighted in red boxes. Red boxes with
  black borders are the molecules that were validated in this study. Studies that
  assessed proteases that are able to cleave the C3 component and hyaluronidase that
  is able to cleave HA in the extract: (**7, *9).'
