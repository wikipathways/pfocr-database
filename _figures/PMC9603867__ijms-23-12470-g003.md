caption: Activation of the mTOR pathway and its potential role in the targeting of
  microbial infections. Microbial interaction with TLRs activates the P13K > PDK >
  AKT > mTOR cascade, which results in mTOR activation. It promotes protein translation
  and the production of iNOS and interferons by phosphorylating 4E-BP1/2 (eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 and 2). Microbial detection also
  promotes autophagy by causing the expression of beta-defensin 2 and cathelicidin.
  Because mTOR inhibitor is an autophagy inhibitor, it can promote autophagy and fight
  microbial infections.
