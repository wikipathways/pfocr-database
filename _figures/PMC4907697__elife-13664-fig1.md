caption: 'The canonical pathway of artemisinin synthesis starts with the conversion
  of IPP/DMAPP (C5 isoprenoids produced by the MVA pathway in the cytosol or the MEP
  pathway in the chloroplast) into farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), catalyzed by farnesyl
  pyrophosphate synthase (FPS). Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) converts FPP into
  amorpha-4,11-diene in the first committed step of the pathway. Amorpha-4,11-diene
  is then successively oxidized to artemisinic alcohol, artemisinic aldehyde and artemisinic
  acid by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP71AV1 (CYP) and its redox partner,
  the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). In A. annua, artemisinic aldehyde is converted
  to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde by DBR2, and then to dihydroartemisinic acid by ALDH1.
  Artemisinin is generated by the spontaneous oxidation of dihydroartemisinic acid
  in planta, and can be produced by chemical conversion of artemisinic acid in vitro.
