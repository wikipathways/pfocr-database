caption: '(A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) coding APE1 interactors in colon
  cancer (COAD) are in the middle. Cellular locations of upregulated interactors in
  upper panel and downregulated interactors in lower panel. The colour codes are as
  follows: green colour for up-regulation, orange colour for down-regulation, blue
  colour for mitochondrial location and grey colour for other cellular locations.
  (B) Representation of DEGs on mitochondrial scheme. Grey shaded boxes indicate mitochondrial
  locations while boxes without any shade indicate enriched pathways. Green upside
  arrows indicate up-regulation while red downside arrows indicate down-regulation.
  Genes that were also regulated in previously published microarray data were shown
  in red circles. Poor prognostic interactors were marked with circled skull symbol.'
