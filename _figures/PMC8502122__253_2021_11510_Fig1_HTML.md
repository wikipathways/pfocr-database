caption: 'The purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway in H. pylori. (a) De novo purine
  nucleotide biosynthetic pathway functioning in E. coli. Homologs for genes required
  for this pathway found in H. pylori are shown in black, while all enzymes for which
  homologs were not found in the H. pylori genome are marked in gray. (b) Purine salvage
  pathway in H. pylori; purine rings, shown in the bottom row, are obtained from environment.
  Enzymes that have been studied in H. pylori by mutant analysis and/or biochemistry
  are shown in violet. Enzymes described in this work, purine nucleoside phosphorylase
  (PunB, PNP) and adenylosuccinate synthetase (PurA, AdSS), are shown in red frames.

  in green (figure adapted from Jenkins et al. , Liechti and Goldberg , Miller et
