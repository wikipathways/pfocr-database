caption: Lipid metabolism in microglia in the inflammatory state. Microglia recognize
  and phagocytose myelin debris, oxidized lipids, lipoproteins, ApoE, and other substances
  through surface scavenger receptors (e.g., CD36 and LRP1) and lipoprotein receptors
  (e.g., LDLR and VLDLR). CD36 mediates microglial phagocytosis of myelin debris,
  and its expression level is regulated by NRF2. The synergistic action between CD36
  and TLR activates downstream inflammatory signaling of NF-κB and promotes the production
  of inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1β, ROS, and NO). ApoE can bind to LRP1 and
  TREM2 on the surface of microglia to inhibit microglial activation and reduce neuroinflammation.
  The lipid components phagocytosed by microglia can be hydrolyzed by PLA2 to release
  ARA and DHA. ARA and DHA can be oxidized by ROS to produce 4-HNE and 4-HHE, respectively,
  both of which can activate the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and increase HO-1 expression
  to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects
