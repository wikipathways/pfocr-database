caption: Correlation network analysis between the 31 differential metabolites involved
  in eight metabolic pathways significantly regulated by L-proline (as shown in Table
  1) and the differentially enriched gut bacteria (including two phyla and ten genera,
  identified by ANCOM). Differential metabolites (depicted as orange circles) and
  gut microbiota (represented as blue triangles) are visualized as nodes. The size
  of each node is indicative of its degree, reflecting the number of connections to
  other nodes within the network. The lines connecting these nodes represent statistically
  significant Spearman correlation coefficients (with p < 0.05 and |coefficient| >
  0.6). Specifically, red links signify positive interactions between nodes, whereas
  blue links denote negative interactions
