caption: Proposed model for the regulation of phenazine biosynthesis by the Gac-Rsm
  system in Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30-84. The model shows the presumed position
  of the GacS/GacA system in relation to other known regulators of phenazine production.
  GacS is a transmembrane protein according to in silico predictions based on amino
  acid sequences. Amino acids H (histidine) and D (aspartate) involved in phosphorylation
  are indicated. The shaded area of GacA indicates the DNA-binding domain. Solid arrows
  and blunt lines point to genes (or processes) that are positively or negatively
  affected, respectively. Dashed arrows or lines indicate unknown or as yet uncharacterized
  regulatory pathways. GacA positively controls the expression of rsmX, rsmY, and
  rsmZ, which in turn activates phenazine production by titrating the translation
  suppressor RsmE. Although the transcript abundance of rsmA was 2.2-fold higher in
  the gacA mutant compared with WT 30-84, RsmA does not appear to play a role in the
  regulation of phenazines under the experimental conditions tested here. A functional
  GacA is also required for increased expression of other phenazine regulatory genes,
  including rpoS, pip, and phzR/phzI. HK, histidine kinase; RR, response regulator;
  P, phosphoryl group.
