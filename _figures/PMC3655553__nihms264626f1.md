caption: Upon β-AR stimulation, the Gsα subunit-bound AC produces cAMP which activates
  target molecules, PKA and Epac. PKA regulates Ca2+ homeostasis through SR and LTCC,
  increases contractility. Under conditions of excessive sympathetic stimulation,
  PKA-induced Ca2+ leads to hypertrophy. On the other hand, activated PKA inhibits
  Raf, which results in the activation of the MEK/ERK signaling, and thus suppression
  of apoptosis. In contrast, Epac, the other target protein of cAMP than PKA, induces
  myocyte apoptosis via the P38MAPK pathway. Upon activation of β2-AR, the Giβγ subunits
  are released and activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activated Akt inhibits apoptosis,
  and accelerates hypertrophy
