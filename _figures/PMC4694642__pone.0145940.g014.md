caption: Lines with arrowhead represent upregulation of activity, protein content,
  and/or expression. Lines without arrowhead denote inhibition. Butyrate supplementation
  leads to induction of adipogenesis, which results in increased adiponectin secretion.
  Adiponectin activates the AKT pathway, thereby increasing insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin
  also leads to activation of AMPK. Butyrate increases intracellular triglyceride
  accumulation through inhibition of lipolysis and enhancement of triglyceride synthesis.
  Butyrate also inhibits peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, leading to accumulation
  of LCFAs, which may also account for feedback inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis
  through increased ACC phosphorylation.
