caption: HER2-targeted therapies. Human epidermal growth factor (EGF) HER1, HER2,
  HER3 and HER4 are receptor tyrosine kinases within the plasma membrane (PM) that
  are involved in signal transduction pathways that modulate cellular processes. They
  consist of an extracellular ligand binding domain and intracellular tyrosine kinase
  domain (T) (except for HER3). The ligand (L) binds the receptor extracellular domain,
  homo-dimerisation and hetro-dimerisation leads to tyrosine kinase domain phosphorylation
  and activation of downstream signaling pathways. These include the MEK and PI3K/AKT/MTOR
  pathway that regulate proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis. HER2
  is an orphan receptor and does not need ligand binding for activation. HER2 is also
  the preferred dimerisation partner for other HER family member proteins. The humanized
  monoclonal antibody pertuzumab binds HER2 at a region distinct from that of trastuzumab
  and prevents HER2 dimerisation (A). Similarly, the humanized monoclonal antibody
  trastuzumab binds HER2, leading to inhibition of downstream signaling in a mechanism
  that is not fully understood (B). Lapatinib is a reversible small-molecule tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor that has dual activity against the tyrosine kinase ATP-binding
  pocket of HER1 and HER2 (C). The antibody-drug conjugate TDM-1 combines trastuzumab
  linked to the microtubulin-disruptive agent emtansine (DM1). Trastuzumab binds HER2-overexpressing
  cells and is internalized via endocytosis. Emtansine is released, causing inhibition
  of microtubule assembly and regulation of cellular processes (D).
