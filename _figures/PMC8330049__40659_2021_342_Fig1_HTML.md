caption: 'Ras and its related pathways. See text and references [, , , , , , , , ,
  ] for details. (1) Ras: one of the central regulators of all the pathways shown.
  The activity of Ras is amplified by Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such
  as Sos and reduced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) such as Neurofibromin 1 (NF1).
  Ras is activated by various receptors at the cell membrane cell, particularly GPCR.
  (2) Upstream activators of Ras: GPCR Various stimuli activate GPCR, mainly Angiotensin
  II (AngII), through its type 1 receptor (Gq), and norepinephrine through its α1-adrenergic
  receptor (Gq) and β-adrenergic receptor (Gs). The subunit Gαs activates adenylate
  cyclase, which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Gq activates phospholipase
  C (PLC) which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce
  inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl-glycerol (DAG). IP3 releases Ca++
  from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum through the IP3 receptor (IP3R). Ca++ and DAG
  activate protein kinase C (PKC). Ca++ activates calcineurine and calcineurine dephosphorylates
  and activates the cytosolic transcription factor NFAT-3 (Nuclear Factor of Activated
  T cells), inducing its nuclear translocation. Gq also activates Ras directly. Gs
  The action of the β-adrenergic receptor through Gs enhances cardiomyocyte contraction
  and relaxation. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates the L-type
  calcium channel (LTCC), facilitating voltage-gated Ca++ and entry and Ca++-induced
  Ca++ release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum through the Ryanondin receptor
  (RyR). RyR is also phosphorylated by PKA. PKA phosphorylates phospholamban (PLN)
  and lifts the inhibition on the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca++ ATP-ase (SERCA),
  further enhancing cardiomyocyte function by facilitating Ca++ cycling. Ca++ can
  in turn bind to calcineurin. cAMP activates the GEF-Epac (exchange protein directly
  activated by cAMP). (3) Downstream effectors of Ras: MAP-Kinases Ras activates the
  Kinase pathways ERK, JNK and p38. The ERK pathway is related to physiological hypertrophy
  [, , ]. In contrast, the p38 and JNK, (known as SAPKs) pathways are activated by
  stress-related stimuli, and mediate pathological remodeling []. Ca++/Calcineurin
  This is the main pathway for pathological hypertrophy, also activated by Raf. Akt
  pathway Ras activates Akt through PI3K, with a dual cardio-protective effect, inhibition
  of apoptosis and pro-survival action, through NF-kB activation and NFAT inhibition
  []. However, NF-kB and GSK (Glycogen Synthase Kinase) can exert either pro- or anti-apoptotic
  effects. Cross-talk points are shown with a red arrow: (i) between Ras and the Calcineurin
  pathway through Raf [, ]. (ii) Between Adenylate cyclase and Ras pathways, with
  activation of Ras through Epac by cAMP. (iii) activation of ERK from PKA; and: (iv)
  Inhibition of NFAT by GSK'
