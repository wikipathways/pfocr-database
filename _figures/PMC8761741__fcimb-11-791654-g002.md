caption: The effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on TH synthesis pathway in the
  thyroid. During the process of TH production and release, IL-1α and IL-1β inhibit
  the TSH-induced Tg mRNA expression and Tg release in human cultured thyrocytes.
  IL-1β is also responsible for the impairment of basal and TSH-stimulated uptake
  of iodide by the NIS in porcine thyroid follicle. IL-6 inhibits TPO mRNA expression
  and T3 secretions. IFN-γ inhibits TSH-induced Tg mRNA expression, Tg and TH secretion,
  and TSH-induced TPO expression. Besides, TSH-induced increase in NIS expression
  is eliminated by IFN-γ in rat FTRL-5 cells. TNF-α is known to downregulate Tg production
  and release in cultured thyrocytes. TNF-α also inhibits NIS expression in rat FTRL-5
  cells. TH, thyroid hormone; Tg, thyroglobulin; NIS, natrium/iodide symporter; TPO,
  thyroperoxidase.
