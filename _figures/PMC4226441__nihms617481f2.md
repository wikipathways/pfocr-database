caption: 'Estrogen action in non-small-cell lung cancer can occur through both genomic
  and nongenomic mechanisms in the lung. Nuclear ERs can be activated in a ligand-dependent
  manner by E2 binding to nuclear ERs at estrogen-responsive elements or AP-1 sites
  in the promoters of estrogen-regulated genes. Nongenomic estrogen action in the
  lungs occurs through rapid activation of EGFR in the cell membrane, which occurs
  through activation of Src and MMP cleavage of the EGFR proligands to activate EGFR
  and the ERK and Akt downstream signaling pathways. Both of these mechanisms of estrogen
  action in non-small-cell lung cancer led to cell proliferation and survival. Available
  strategies to target the estrogen signaling pathway for lung cancer treatment or
  prevention are shown in red and include: (A) inhibition of estrogen synthesis with
  aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole or exemestane; (B) downregulation of ERs
  using antiestrogens such as fulvestrant; and (C) targeting growth factor pathways
  that are activated by estrogens with agents such as gefitinib or erlotinib. These
  strategies can be used as single agents or in combination.E2: β-estradiol; EGFR:
  EGF receptor; ER: Estrogen receptor; HB: Heparin-binding; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase.'
