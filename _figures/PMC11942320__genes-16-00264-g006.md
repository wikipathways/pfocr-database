caption: 'The flavonoids biosynthetic pathway of D. devonianum flowers. The heatmap
  illustrates the expression patterns of DEGs and DAMs during the biosynthesis of
  flavonoid compounds. Circles represent the expression changes of DEGs, while rectangles
  denote the expression changes of DAMs. The color scale indicates the relative expression
  levels and cumulative amounts of DEGs and DAMs, with darker colors signifying higher
  expression levels. Red indicates upregulation, and blue indicates downregulation.
