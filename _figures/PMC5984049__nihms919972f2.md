caption: 'The diagram describes the neural pathway for the exercise pressor reflex
  and the role played by P2X. Interstitial ATP is increased in exercising muscle and
  this stimulates P2X receptors on muscle afferent nerves. In peripheral artery disease
  (PAD), the protein expression of P2X receptors in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is
  upregulated and P2X currents of DRG neurons are increased, thereby leading the exaggerated
  exercise pressor reflex. Note that muscle temperature can modulate BP response evoked
  by activation of P2X. In addition, in ischemic muscle a decrease in pH levels and
  increases in nerve growth factor (NGF) and bradykinin (BK) are also engaged in mediating
  the effects of P2X on the reflex pressor response. CNS: central nervous system;
  SNA: sympathetic nervous activity; BP: blood pressure.'
