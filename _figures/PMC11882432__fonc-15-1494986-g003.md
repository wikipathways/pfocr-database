caption: CRS mechanisms. When engaging the tumor cells, CAR T cells become activated
  via the interaction between antigens and CARs that leads to the production of inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). This cytokine release in turn
  activates the CD40-CD40L signaling pathway, reacting more prospectively to immune
  activation. When secreting granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
  CAR T cells activate myeloid cells, and subsequently IL-1, IL-6, and interleukin-1
  receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are hence secreted. These cytokines act upon the endothelium
  and result in enhanced permeability of blood vessels. Furthermore, the release of
  Von Willebrand factor (vWF), angiotensin 2 (Ang-2), and IL-6 promotes endothelial
  activation responsible for tumor growth and immune response
