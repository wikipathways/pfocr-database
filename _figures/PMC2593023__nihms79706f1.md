caption: Expression of an oncogenic allele of BRAF (BRAFV600E) in human cells induces
  senescence. Three recent genetic screens using cells expressing BRAFV600E identified
  the secreted proteins (green) insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7),
  interleukin 8 (IL-8), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) as essential mediators of BRAFV600E-dependent
  senescence. These unexpected observations provide new insights into the overlapping
  yet distinct mechanisms of the p53 and RB tumor suppressor pathway activation, which
  induces the senescence response. IGFBP7 expression is mediated by activating protein
  1 (AP-1. IGFBP7 inhibits the MEK mitogen activated kinase pathway via the upregulation
  of the Raf inhibitory protein (RKIP) but promotes p16 expression. The transcription
  factor (blue) C/EBP (CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein) promotes IL-6 expression. IL-6
  activity is mediated by its receptor IL-6R. The chemokine receptor CXCR or its ligands
  IL-8 and GRO-α promote p53-dependent senescence. IL-8 upregulation is dependent
  upon the transcripton factors C/EBP and NFκB.
