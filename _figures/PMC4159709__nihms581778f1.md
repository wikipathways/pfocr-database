caption: (A), Full-length APP, a transmembranous protein, can be cleaved by α-,β-,
  or γ-secretases (sec.) (indicated by small arrows in the left upper panel), which
  recognize specific sites of Aβ peptide, into nonamyloidogenic or amyloidogenic Aβ
  peptide fragments, soluble APPs, and intracellular peptide fragments (α- and β-sec.–generated
  carboxy-terminal fragments or α- and β-CTFs and the γ-secretase–generated APP intracellular
  domain). β-sec. cleaves at position 1 in the Aβ sequence, whereas α-sec. and γ-sec.
  have multiple probable cleavage sites around amino acids at position 13–16 or 17–20
  and 33–42 of Aβ, respectively. α-sec. cleaves full-length APP (pathway 1) to generate
  soluble APPα and CTFα. APP is cleaved by β-sec. followed by α-sec. to generate nonamyloidogenic
  small fragments of Aβ sized from 13 to 16 (Aβ1–13–Aβ1–16), the soluble form of APPβ
  (sAPPβ), and CTFα (pathway 2). If full-length APP is cleaved by β-sec. and γ-sec.
  [an enzyme complex consisting of presenilin, nicastrin, PEN2 (presenilin enhancer
  2), and APH1 (anterior pharynx defective 1)], amyloidogenic Aβ1–42 and other types
  of carboxy-terminal truncated Aβ fragments (Aβ1–17, 1–18, 1–19, 1–20, Aβ1–33, 1–34,
  1–37, 1–38, 1–39, 1–40), sAPPβ, and APP intracellular domain are generated (pathway
  3). The sticky Aβ1–42 is prone to aggregate into various types of toxic oligomer
  with a buried carboxy-terminus and is a pathologic substrate of amyloid plaque formation
  with other truncated Aβ peptides, including Aβ1–40. (B), When τ proteins, which
  normally bind to and stabilize microtubules, are hyperphosphorylated by several
  serine/threonine kinases [e.g., Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), GSK3 (glycogen
  synthase kinase 3), and MARK (microtubule-affinity-regulating kinase)], the hyperphosphorylated
  τ proteins no longer bind microtubules and self-aggregate to form PHFs. Depletion
  of τ from microtubules results in their instability, thereby leading to impaired
  axonal transport and synaptic dysfunction. The progressive accumulation of PHFs
  leads to their aggregation into intracellular NFTs and neuropil threads.
