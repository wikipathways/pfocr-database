caption: Interfering with TNFα-TNFR2 signaling pathway via blocking the ligand. This
  schematic depicts our primary hypothesis based on the direct involvement of TNFα-TNFR2
  axis in immunomodulatory functions observed by NSCs. In order to validate this hypothesis,
  we should hamper this signaling pathway firstly, a) by using T cells harvested from
  TNFα KO mice that are incapable of TNFα production. In this setting TNFR2 (receptor)
  is expressed by NSCs but no TNFα (ligand) will be produced by T cells. b) Secondly,
  by using anti-TNFα monoclonal anti-body to neutralize the membrane and secreted
  form of TNFα. Then, after creating these two co-culture conditions, one should assess
  if NSCs are still able to exert their immunosuppressive function on T cells. TCR,
  T cell receptor; mTNFα, membrane form of TNFα
