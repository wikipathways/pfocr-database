caption: Using a defined behavior to convert open-loop cellular systems into closed-loop
  circuits. (A) Application of aromatherapy for the treatment of chronic pain can
  be used to drive closed-loop production of an analgesic peptide that blocks the
  pain-conductive NaV1.7 channels. Inhaled R-carvone, a volatile substance commonly
  found in spearmint aromatherapy, is used as a specific activator of the OR1A1 GPCR
  in engineered cells. This receptor potently induces the cAMP pathway, which is then
  rerouted to a CREB-operated promoter for the production of huwentoxin-IV to boost
  the therapeutic effect of aromatherapy. (B) Engineered cells enable closed-loop
  combinatorial treatment of metabolic syndrome co-morbidities such as hyperlipidemia,
  hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension, which are often simultaneously
  present in patients. Oral intake of the anti-hypertensive drug wytensin specifically
  activates cTAAR1 GPCR in engineered cells to enable the production of protein drugs
  addressing the co-morbidities. The cTAAR1 receptor potently induces the cAMP pathway,
  which is rerouted to a CREB-operated promoter for the production of engineered GLP-1
  to treat hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and leptin to address hyperlipidemia.
