caption: Pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. When the antigen receptor of the T cell is ligated
  by antigen, two stereotypical responses can be elicited. Early in the disease course,
  activated T cells differentiate into the type 1 helper T (Th1) effectors cells and
  begin producing the macrophage activating cytokine interferon‐γ (Inf‐γ), leading
  to inflammation. Regulatory cytokines of the type 2 helper (Th2) pathway modulate
  the process by secreting anti‐inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin‐10 and
  transforming growth factor β), contributing to the formation of tissue scarring.
