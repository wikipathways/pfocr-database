caption: Figure 1. Chemokines mediate a vicious cycle between prostate cancer cells
  and macrophages that drives disease progression. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages
  and inflammatory cytokines such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4) play a
  key role in prostatic tumorigenesis via an androgen receptor (AR)-, and signal transducer
  and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent signaling axis (dashed arrows).
  As bicalutamide or enzalutamide reduce the AR-mediated expression of protein inhibitor
  of activated STAT, 3 (PIAS3), and stimulate the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4)-
  and STAT3-dependent signaling pathway, they promote the migration of macrophages
  toward prostate cancer cells, thus enhancing the invasiveness of the latter (white
  arrows). Suppressing the function of the AR in macrophages simultaneously triggers
  undesirable inflammatory signals that prompt macrophage infiltration and stimulate
  prostate cancer progression through the activation of a CCL2/CCR2/STAT3 signaling
  axis (black arrows).
