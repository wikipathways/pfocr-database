caption: 'The three primary routes for activation of complement are: (1) the lectin
  pathway (LP), (2) the classical pathway (CP), and (3) the alternative pathway (AP).
  The LP and CP are activated when specific triggers are recognized by host pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRRs). The AP is constitutively active. Initial activation through the
  LP or CP generates a shared C3 convertase (C4b•C2a). In the AP, C3b pairs with factor
  B (FB) to form the AP proconvertase (C3b•B), which is processed by factor D (FD)
  to form the AP C3 convertase (C3b•Bb). Both types of C3 convertases cleave C3 to
  generate C3a and C3b. C3a is an anaphylatoxin, a substance that promotes an inflammatory
  response. C3b that lands on the surface of a healthy host cell is quickly inactivated;
  C3b that attaches to the surface of a pathogen or altered host cell triggers a rapid
  amplification loop to generate more C3b, resulting in opsonization. C3b also complexes
  with the C3 convertases to form the C5 convertases (C4b•C2a•C3b and C3b•Bb•C3b).
  In the terminal complement cascade, C5 convertases cleave C5 into C5a (an anaphylatoxin)
  and C5b. C5b combines with C6–9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), also
  referred to as the terminal complement complex (TCC). Regulatory factors () act
  at various stages of the cascade to control complement activation via their decay
  accelerating activity and/or cofactor activity. Additional abbreviations: PAMPs
  = pathogen-associated molecular patterns; MBL = mannose-binding lectin; MASPs =
  mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases.'
