caption: The network shows key reactions of the pathway. IFNγ activates the type II
  IFN receptor. To keep the model simple, Janus kinases (JAK) are not considered separately
  but as part of the active receptor complex only. The receptor-associated JAKs phosphorylate
  cytosolic STAT1 (STAT1Uc), followed by rapid and high affinity formation of homodimers
  (STAT1Dc). STAT1Dc translocates into the nucleus (STAT1Dn). Nuclear STAT1D can be
  dephosphorylated, leading to nuclear export of the resulting STAT1Un into the cytoplasm.
  STAT1Uc can also shuttle into the nucleus. As a transcription factor, STAT1 induces
  the transcription of specific target genes. The network considers STAT1 itself and
  SOCS1 as target genes of IFNγ-activated signalling. SOCS1 is a potential negative
  feedback regulator; inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT1Uc. The annotation delay
  refers to temporal differences between IFNγ action at the receptor level and consecutive
  steps. We could omit the binding of nuclear phosphorylated STAT1 to the DNA in this
  work comparing to , , because the slightly simplified model leads to indistinguishable
  fits, as shown in Figures S1 and S2 in .
