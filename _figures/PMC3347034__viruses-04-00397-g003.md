caption: 'Inhibition of type I IFN signaling by DENV: IFNα/β binds the type I IFN
  receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and is found on the surface
  of nucleated cells. Receptor binding triggers tyrosine autophosphorylation of the
  Janus kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2. The activated kinases then phosphorylate STAT1 and
  STAT2. Activated STAT2, which is normally associated with IFN regulatory factor
  9 (IRF9), associates with activated STAT1 to form the trimeric IFN-stimulated gene
  factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to the IFN-stimulated
  response element (ISRE) of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Hundreds of ISGs are transcribed,
  and their products set up an antiviral state in the IFN-treated cell. DENV antagonizes
  this signaling pathway by utilizing NS5 to degrade STAT2, and by using NS2A, NS4A
  and NS4B to inhibit steps upstream of STAT1 activation.'
