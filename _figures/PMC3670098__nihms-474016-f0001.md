caption: 'Diagram depicting [1,2-13C2]-glucose metabolism through glycolysis and the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with the resulted labeling pattern of lactate C3.
  As a consequence of the higher activity of glycolysis relative to PPP in normal
  cells, the contribution of the doublet (D23) to the total NMR signal of lactate
  C3 is significantly more prominent than the singlet (S3). HK: hexokinase, G-6PDH:
