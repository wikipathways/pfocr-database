caption: Heme catabolism pathway in mammals. Labile (protein free) heme group is catabolized
  by the inducible enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) into Biliverdin, carbon monoxide
  (CO) and Fe2+. Biliverdin can be converted into Bilirubin by the enzymatic activity
  of Biliverdin Reductase (BVR, type A in adults, type B in fetus). In the opposite
  direction, Bilirubin can produce Biliverdin through the reduction of Reactive Oxygen
  Species (ROS). Bilirubin acts as an endogenous ROS scavenger, mediates signaling
  pathways, is involved in metabolism modulation and exerts anti-inflammatory actions.
  In the liver, uridine 5’-diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) catalyzes
  the conjugation of Bilirubin with glucuronic acid producing a hydrophilic derivative
  for bile and urine excretion. The gut microbiota can transform these Bilirubin mono-
  and di-glucuronides into urobilinogen, which is excreted in the feces. (A higher
  resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of
  the article).
