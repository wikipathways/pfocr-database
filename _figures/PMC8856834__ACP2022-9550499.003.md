caption: Red-labeled circRNA has a negative effect on the metabolism of extracellular
  matrix and can promote the catabolism of ECM. However, blue-labeled circRNA plays
  a role in promoting the anabolism of ECM. Song et al. [] suggested that circRNA_0000253
  could promote IDD by adsorbing miRNA-141-5p and downregulating SIRT1. Guo et al.
  [] revealed that circ-FAM169A promotes IDD development via the miR-583/BTRC signaling
  pathway. However, Li et al. [] proved that circ-FAM169A promote NPC proliferation
  and extracellular matrix synthesis by the circ-FAM169A-miR-583 pathway. Cui and
  Zhang [] suggested that circ_001653 inhibited ECM synthesis of NPCs in IDD by the
  miR-486-3p/CEMIP axis. Song et al. [] proved that circRNA_104670 is upregulated
  in human IDD tissues and upregulates MMP-2 by directly sponging miR-17-3p. Guo et
  al. [] revealed that circ-TIMP2 promoted dysmetabolism of ECM via the miR-185-5p-MMP2
  pathway. Xiang et al. [] revealed that circRNA-CIDN downregulated the expression
  of ECM catabolism enzymes (MMP-3 and MMP-13) and upregulated the level of anabolism
  markers (collagen II and aggrecan) by the miR-34a-5p/SIRT1 pathway to retard compression-induced
  ECM degradation. Xie et al. [] demonstrated that circERCC2 can mitigate ECM degradation
  via targeting miR-182-5p/SIRT1 axis. Cheng et al. [] revealed that circVMA21 could
  alleviate inflammatory cytokine-induced dysmetabolism of ECM through the miR-200c-XIAP
  pathway. Wang et al. [] demonstrated that circSEMA4B acts as a sponge and a ceRNA
  form miR431 in NPCs and competes with GSK-3β and SFRP1 for miR-431 binding, thus
  inhibiting IL-1β-induced degenerative process in NPCs through Wnt signaling. Wang
  et al. [] revealed that circular RNA circ-4099 regulates ECM synthesis by blocking
  miR-616-5p inhibition of Sox9.
