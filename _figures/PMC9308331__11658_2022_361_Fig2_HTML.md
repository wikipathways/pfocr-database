caption: Main molecular mechanisms of the renal protective effects developed by CoQ10
  in different types of AKI. CoQ10 is an endogenous antioxidant. Under AKI treatment
  with CoQ10, multiple associated genes (e.g., iNOS, caspase-3, NF-κB, p53, and PON1)
  and a series of downstream signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2/HO-1 pathway) were regulated,
  resulting in antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. CoQ10 coenzyme
  Q10, AKI acute kidney injury, ESWL extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, iNOS inducible
  nitric oxide synthase, PON1 paraoxonase 1, HO-1 heme oxygenase 1, ROS reactive oxygen
  species, Nrf2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
