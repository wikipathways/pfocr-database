caption: Schematic of major pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  and site of action of current treatments. Multiple pathways and receptors are associated
  with the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) including epidermal
  growth factor receptors (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2),
  and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). All of these have important
  roles in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathways involved in cell growth.
  EGFR also has a role in the JAK/STAT pathway necessary for activation of signalling
  cascades and gene transcription. Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) is a multifunctional
  cytokine involved in various processes some of which are mediated by SMAD 4, a known
  mutation associated with development of PDAC. Current therapeutics target these
  processes at various sites.
