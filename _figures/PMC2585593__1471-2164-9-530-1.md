  and links to associated metabolic activities. Dashed arrows are used when one or
  more intermediates or reactions are omitted. Red font is used to identify relevant
  aroma compounds. Full gene names and functions can be viewed in the appendix. The
  main pathway for the production of higher alcohols is known as the Erlich Pathway
  []: it involves three basic enzyme activities and starts with the deamination of
  leucine, valine and isoleucine to the corresponding α-ketoacids. Each α-ketoacid
  is subsequently decarboxylated and converted to its branched-chain aldehyde [-].
  The final step is an alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed step which could potentially
  be catalyzed by the seven putative aryl alcohol dehydrogenase genes [], and the
  seven alcohol dehydrogenase genes []. Finally ester formation involves the enzyme-catalyzed
  condensation reaction between a higher alcohol and an activated acyl-coenzyme A
  [-]. Fatty acids are derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, but can also be produced
  as intermediates of the higher alcohol and ester producing pathways [].'
