caption: Canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. Primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts
  are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Pri-miRNAs are processed by the microprocessor
  complex into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpins. These are transported into the
  cytoplasm, where they are further processed by Dicer into miRNA duplexes. Following
  strand separation, the mature miRNAs are loaded into RNA-induced silencing complexes
  (RISCs) to guide the repression of protein synthesis or mRNA degradation.
