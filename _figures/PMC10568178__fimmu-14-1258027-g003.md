caption: Monitoring of the metabolic fate of [6,6-2H2]glucose by 2H MRS. (A) Scheme
  of the metabolic pathway for [6,6-2H2]glucose through glycolysis and the TCA cycle.
  The red rectangles indicate the metabolites that are within the detection range
  of 2H MRS. (B) Stack plot of 2H MR spectra over the entire observation period for
  mice with PBS-doped (left) and LPS-doped (right) Matrigels, respectively. See the
  text for detailed explanations.
