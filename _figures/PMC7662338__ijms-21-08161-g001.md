caption: An overview of the cytokinin (CK) pathway from biosynthesis to response in
  Arabidopsis. CKs are synthesised by isopentenyltransferases (IPTs) and CYP735A1/2
  enzymes and converted into active forms by LONELY GUY (LOG) enzymes, whereas cytokinin
  degradation occurs mainly through CKXs. CKs are perceived by the AHK2, AHK3 and
  AHK4/CRE1 receptors, which initiate a phosphorylation signalling cascade involving
  AHPs, which phosphorylate and activate type-B ARRs. Active ARRs then induce cytokinin-responsive
  genes, such as those encoding the type-A repressor ARRs. AHPs can also be phosphorylated
  by CKI, a histidine kinase that activates the cytokinin response in the absence
  of CKs. Stars represent phosphorylation sites. (ER) endoplasmic reticulum; (PM)
  plasma membrane; (NM) nuclear membrane.
