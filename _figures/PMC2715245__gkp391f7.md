caption: Comparison of models for FRAXA and APC-inducible chromosome fragility. (A)
  In the presence of FdU, a lesion arises in the FMR1 gene in FXS cells that result
  in activation of ATM and ATR. ATR activation results in the lesion being successfully
  repaired, but ATM activation can lead to chromosome fragility. In the absence of
  FdU, a second type of chromosome fragility is seen, one that is normally resolved
  by ATM. In the absence of ATM, an as yet unidentified DNA damage response pathway
  is used instead and this leads to the production of a fragile site. (B) A model
  for APC-inducible fragile sites based on the data of Ozeri-Galai et al. (). In the
  case of these fragile sites, a lesion of some sort arises in the presence of APC.
  ATR is primarily responsible for dealing with this lesion, but in the absence of
  ATR, ATM can substitute for ATR. However, when both ATR and ATM are depleted, an
  error-prone mechanism is used to deal with the problem resulting in the formation
  of a fragile site. It is unclear how these three types of fragile site differ at
  the molecular level. For this reason the responsible lesion is indicated by different
  colored question marks.
