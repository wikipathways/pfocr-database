caption: Schematic of the bacterial NER pathway in response to DNA damage. (A) The
  damage site (red nucleotides) is recognized by the UvrA dimer, as part of the UvrA2B2
  tetramer complex. UvrB is then loaded by UvrA to scan the DNA for damage. (B) Once
  an altered base is found, UvrB remains bound to the undamaged strand at the site
  of damage, forming the UvrB-DNA preincision complex, while UvrA2 is released. (C)
  Following damage recognition, UvrB recruits the UvrC endonuclease, which first cleaves
  the phosphodiester backbone on the damaged strand 4 or 5 nucleotides 3′ from the
  damage and then 8 nucleotides 5′ from the damage site. (D) The damaged strand is
  then removed by the DNA helicase II (UvrD), leaving a gap of single-stranded DNA
  (E). (F) DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase are then recruited to fill the gap (G).
