caption: 'Schematic representation of plant engineering strategies applied to increase
  plant products.(A) Substrate (yellow triangle) undergoes sequential enzyme‐catalyzed
  reactions (E1–E8) to yield a final product (red rectangle) through pathway intermediates
  (a–g). Strategies to increase product yield include: (1) Eliminating pathway bottlenecks
  by enhancing substrate availability and expression of rate‐limiting enzymes. (2)
  Increasing enzyme efficiency by controlling the level of transcription factors and
  regulatory elements (e.g., promoters/enhancers). (3) Suppressing competing pathways
  (enzyme E9) to avoid the production of undesired products (black‐filled circle).
  (4) Enhancing enzyme activity, substrate specificity, stability, and adaptability
  to the host by amino acid site mutagenesis (native enzyme E8, light teal blue; engineered
  enzyme E8, pale green). (5) Controlling the toxicity of products and/or intermediates
  to reduce the burden on host cells or toxic effects. (6) Engineering transporters
  to uptake or efflux pathway intermediates or products through membranes. (7) Storing
  pathway intermediates or target products in subcellular compartments.(B) “Push‐and‐pull”
  strategy applied by Jung and Maeda (2024) to efficiently produce betacyanins from
  arogenate in Nicotiana benthamiana. In most plant species, arogenate dehydrogenase
  (TyrA) is feedback inhibited by l‐tyrosine. BvTyrAα from beet showing relaxed feedback
  inhibition by l‐tyrosine was used to “push” the supply of tyrosine and co‐expression
  of further genes (cytochrome P450 CYP76AD1, DODA, cDOPA5GT) were used to “pull”
  the l‐tyrosine supply for producing purple betacyanins. Pigmentation phenotypes
  were observed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants expressing betacyanin
  biosynthetic pathway genes (CYP76AD1, BvDODA, cDOPA5GT) (Polturak et al., 2016).
