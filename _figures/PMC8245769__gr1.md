caption: The Yin and Yang of CO. The left side (Yang) showcases the beneficial effects
  of CO and the top circle shows some of CO's therapeutic indications, either therapeutically
  delivered or endogenously produced through heme degradation by heme oxygenase (HO).
  The left side lists some of known CO's pharmacological targets (+positive modulation;
  –negative modulation). The right side (Yin) highlights the toxic consequences of
  high-level exposure to CO-containing products from various sources. The higher binding
  affinity of CO over O2 to respiratory hemeproteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin,
  and neuroglobin compromises their ability to transport and store oxygen, leading
  to hypoxia and asphyxia. Persistent mitochondria dysfunction caused by cytochrome
  inhibition and disruption of NO signaling pathway by nitric oxide synthase inhibition
  also contributes to CO's toxicity in the central nervous system and cardiac system
  ( persistent inhibition).
