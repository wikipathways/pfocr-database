caption: Schematic representation of the molecular events associated with cellular
  processing, lipid modification, and secretion of the SHH protein and the autocrine
  and paracrine actions of mature and secreted SHH protein. The scheme shows the molecular
  mechanisms associated with the cellular processing of the SHH protein precursor,
  including the cleavage of its N-terminal signal peptide fragment. The autocatalytic
  cleavage at the position 198 of SHH protein precursor catalyzed by its C-terminal
  fragment, which results in the release of cleaved N-terminal and C-terminal products,
  is also shown. Moreover, the lipid modifications of cleaved N-terminal SHH fragment
  via the attachment of a cholesterol moiety at the C-terminal position and a palmitate
  molecule at the N-terminal position catalyzed by the palmitoylacyltransferase Hhat
  are also indicated. The secretion of the mature and lipid-modified SHH protein into
  extracellular space as well as its diffusion and potential autocrine or paracrine
  action on secreting and neighboring responsive cells are also illustrated. In addition,
  the function of dispatched (DISP) transmembrane protein in the formation of large
  SHH oligomers and their secretion in extracellular compartment is illustrated. Moreover,
  the inhibitory effect on the SHH actions induced through the sequestration of cell
  surface-associated SHH molecules by HHIP is shown.
