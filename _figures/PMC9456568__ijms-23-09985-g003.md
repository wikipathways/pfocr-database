caption: 'Summary of the cellular processes regulated by mTOR pathway and its connections
  with the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. mTOR complexes are activated by various
  extra- and intracellular stimuli related to the energetic status of the cell and
  nutrient availability in the extracellular space. mTORC1 functions can be regulated
  by the BRAF pathway via an ERK-dependent mechanism and mTORC1 itself exerts a negative
  feedback mechanism on RTKs signaling, inhibiting mTORC2 and BRAF/MEK/ERK pathways.
  mTOR complexes support therapeutic resistance of melanoma cells by boosting ATP
  production of the mitochondria, by enhancing protein synthesis. mTORC1 and mTORC2
  also promote the expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), potentially modulating
  anti-tumor immune responses. Note that mTORC1 inhibition can play a role in the
  switch toward therapeutic resistance by removing a brake on autophagy. Additionally,
  systemic mTOR inhibition can play both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory roles
  by impairing CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (TCL) and by favoring the expansion of CD8+
  memory T cells (CD8 memory). i: inhibitors; ICI: immune checkpoint inhibitors; AMPK:
  AMP-activated protein Kinase; TSC: tuberous sclerosis; IFNAR/IFNGR: interferon receptors.'
