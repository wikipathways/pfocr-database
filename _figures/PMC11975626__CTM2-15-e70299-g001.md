caption: The symbiotic relationship between cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and
  prostate cancer (PCa). PCa cells and CAFs coexist in a symbiotic relationship in
  the body. Once exposed, they undergo metabolic reprogramming. CAFs are converted
  to aerobic glycolysis to produce lactate, which is expelled from cells through monocarboxylate
  transporter 4 (MCT4), taken up by MCT1 and entered tumour cells. Additionally, CAFs
  in a high glycolytic state can provide excess mitochondria to tumour cells through
  intercellular bridge. Lactate entering tumour cells not only provides energy for
  tumour activity through tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, but also upregulates key
  enzymes ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) in fatty acid
  synthesis through citrate pathway, promoting the production of lipid droplets and
  further exacerbating tumour progression. Moreover, lactate can activate the sirtuin
  1 (SIRT1)/proliferator‐activated receptor gamma co‐activator 1‐alpha (PGC‐1α) pathway,
  leading to mitochondrial reshaping and the production of mitochondrial peroxides,
  which further increases the malignancy of tumours. Reprogramming of CAFs can also
  silence the RASAL gene, leading to an increase in macropinocytosis mediated by the
  rat sarcoma (RAS) signalling pathway and the production of more glutamine, which
  is taken up by SLC1A5. Glutamine that enters the tumour can participate in the TCA
  cycle by being converted to glutamate and undergoing deamination. It can also upregulate
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), leading to the transformation of PCa into
  neuroendocrine subtypes and the development of resistance to androgen deprivation
  therapy (ADT)
