caption: Post-translational modifications regulating NCC activity in the DCT. NCC
  phosphorylation (yellow) is primarily mediated by the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 kinase cascade.
  WNK1 and WNK4 (with-no-lysine kinases) activate SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich
  kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-response protein 1), which, in turn, phosphorylate
  the NCC, increasing its transport activity in the apical membrane. WNK autophosphorylation
  is stimulated by low Cl− intracellular levels, which result from a decrease in K+
  intracellular concentration. These changes are, respectively, mediated by basolateral
  chlorine (light blue) and potassium channels (pink). Cab39 (calcium binding protein
  39) is another regulator of NCC phosphorylation since it is required for SPAK activation.
  NCC dephosphorylation (red) leads to a reduction in its activity and is carried
  out by protein phosphatases PP1, PP3, and PP4. PP1 is regulated by protein phosphatase
  1 inhibitor-1 (I-1) through the cAMP/PKA pathway. A rise in cAMP levels activates
  PKA (protein kinase A), which phosphorylates I-1, preventing PP1 from dephosphorylating
  the NCC. Ubiquitination (purple) is another key regulatory mechanism that affects
  NCC function. WNK abundance is controlled by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex composed
  of KLHL3 (Kelch-like protein 3) and CUL3 (Cullin 3). This complex tags the NCC with
  ubiquitin (Ub), marking it for proteasomal degradation. KLHL3 acts as adapter for
  WNK, and its phosphorylation prevents this binding. PP3 is responsible for KLHL3
  activation through dephosphorylation. Additionally, NEDD4-2, another ubiquitin ligase,
  directly mediates NCC degradation through ubiquitination. Figure created in BioRender.com
