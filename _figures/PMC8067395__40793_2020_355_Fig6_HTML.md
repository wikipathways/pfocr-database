caption: 'A schematic diagram showing the potential biogeochemical pathways mediated
  by various MAGs recovered from the Centrosaurus dinosaur fossil bone. The MAGs highlighted
  in red indicate their involvement in autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways and the dash
  lines refer to the steps where the key functional genes were not identified in the
  MAGs. Abbreviations: AlkB, alkane 1-monooxygenase; AmoA, ammonia monooxygenase;
  narG, membrane bound nitrate reductase; nirS, nitrite reductase; Nor, nitric oxide
  reductase; nosZ, nitrous oxide reductase; Sat, ATP sulfurylase; Apr, adenylyl-sulfate
  reductase; DsrAB, dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit A and B; hmoA, heme-degrading
  monooxygenase; 3HP/4HB, 3-hydroxyproprionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle'
