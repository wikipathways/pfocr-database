caption: Ecstasy is metabolized in the liver by different members of the cytochrome
  P450 family. MDMA is mainly O-demethylenated to 3, 4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (HHMA)
  by CYP2D6, and a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. HHMA is then O-methylated to
  4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA).- N-demethylation is also catalyzed mainly
  by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, which results in producing the active metabolite, 3, 4-methylendioxyamphetamine
  (MDA)., The MDMA metabolic pathway is illustrated in .
