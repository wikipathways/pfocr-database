caption: Both S100A8 and S100A9 induce the expression of SAA3 specifically in future
  metastasis sites in the lung, promoting Mac1+ myeloid and endothelial cell engraftment.
  In this process, SAA3 promotes its own secretion by a positive feedback mechanism
  mediated by TLR4 and induces NF-κB signaling pathway activation (left). This inflammation-like
  state accelerates the future recruitment of tumor cells (right).
