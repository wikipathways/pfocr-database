caption: Physiological functions of Endocan. The yellow squares at the upper or lower
  edges represent ECs, which form vascular endothelium by tight junctions; the red
  hollow circles represent red blood cells; the light blue circles represent leukocytes;
  the yellow squares with black borders represent platelets. (1) Endocan regulates
  the interaction between ECs and leukocytes. (2) Endocan promotes the expression
  of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and enhances the binding of VEGF-A
  to its receptors. The activation of a VEGF signaling pathway contributes to the
  production of Endocan. (3) Endocan promotes the release of pro-inflammatory substances.
