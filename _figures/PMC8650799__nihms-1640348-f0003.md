caption: During the time course of tissue repair, macrophages are generally classified
  as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory. During the acute inflammation, pro-inflammatory
  macrophages amplify inflammation and these macrophages rely on glycolysis for their
  energy requirements. The glycolytic intermediates are diverted through the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and produce NADPH. NADPH generated via the PPP is used by
  NAPDH-oxidase (NOX) to produce ROS and also acts as a co-substrate for the production
  of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This NO mediated
  ROS production can act negatively on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  Pro-inflammatory cytokine production is amplified via several components of altered
  metabolism. The tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle exhibits two breaks in pro-inflammatory
  macrophages which leads to production of excess succinate and citrate. The cytosolic
  citrate is converted into acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) which amplifies
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This acetyl-CoA will also increase
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and cholesterol synthesis which are crucial for production
  of IL1-β. This assists during the phagocytosis of microbes which is an important
  property of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Similarly, excess succinate is able to
  further amplify pro-inflammatory genes through the succinylation of metabolic enzymes.
  Succinate also helps to stabilize hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1α)
  which further produces the pro-inflammatory genes. Importantly, regulating the balance
  of TCA intermediates such as citrate and succinate is key to resolving inflammation
  through the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The major
  energy source for anti-inflammatory macrophages is mitochondrial OXPHOS, as the
  glycolysis feeds directly to TCA cycle (PPP is blocked). This is further boosted
  by increased production of acetyl co-A via fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Due to glutaminolysis,
  glutamine increases the α-ketoglutarate (αKG)/succinate ratio which eventually increases
  OXPHOS. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) also triggers glutaminolysis
  to enhance mitochondrial respiration in anti-inflammatory macrophages. Arginine
  metabolism also plays an important role in the production of L-proline and polyamines
  that are crucial for collagen production and ECM remodelling. The degree to which
  macrophages observed at different stages of tissue repair occur from phenotype switching
  (i.e., from pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state) or represent new macrophages
  migrating into healing tissue remains unresolved.
