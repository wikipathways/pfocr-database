caption: Potential implication of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
  in amyloid β (Aβ) clearance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). LDL receptor-related protein
  1 (LRP1), expressed in microglia, neurons, astrocytes and pericytes, and CD36, mainly
  present in microglia, are the two main lipoprotein receptors involved in Aβ clearance
  and are potentially targeted by PCSK9. (1) LRP1 may also influence the production
  of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons through a direct protein-protein
  interaction or competition with the α/β-secretase cleavage of APP. (2) Once Aβ is
  released into the extracellular space in the brain can form amyloid plaques or oligomers
  and LRP1 or CD36 can mediate its cellular uptake by neurons, microglia, astrocytes,
  vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes and endothelial cells. (3) A portion of
  Aβ may be transported through LRP1 at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reversed
  into the blood, thus PCSK9 may also interfere with this process. (4) Both LRP1 and
  CD36 expressed in the liver might also help the clearance of Aβ from the blood,
  and PCSK9 may affect this pathway by reducing their expression levels in hepatocytes.
  (5) Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which is mainly produced and secreted from astrocytes
  in the brain, is lipidated by ATP binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) to supply
  cholesterol/lipids to neurons and other cells through LRP1 and CD36. PCSK9 has been
  shown to downregulate the expression of ABCA1, thus opening to a possible modulation
  of the release of ApoE containing lipoproteins and thus LRP1- or CD36-mediated Aβ
  metabolism. Indeed, ApoE isoforms may affect LRP1-mediated Aβ metabolism by directly
  interacting with Aβ or competing with Aβ for receptor binding. (6) ApoE lipoprotein
  may also interact with PCSK9 hence influencing its action on LRP1 and CD36.
