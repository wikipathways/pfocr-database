caption: The roles of PRMT1, CARM1, PRMT5, and PRMT7 in cancer immunotherapy. (A)
  Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) regulates programmed death-ligand 1
  (PD-L1) expression in cancer cells and decreases tumor cell apoptosis. Also, PRMT1
  induces the expression of the immunosuppressive factor, vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF), and inhibits the expression of interferon (IFN) stimulates genes
  (ISGs). This, in turn, decreases the expression of several cytokines and chemokines
  and leads to immune checkpoint blockade resistance. (B) In tumor cells, co-activator-associated
  methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) inhibits ISG expression. This leads to inhibition of
  the type I IFN response and decreases the number of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  This increases the resistance of tumors cells to cancer immunotherapy. (C) Protein
  arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) promotes immunosuppression in cancer cells
  by inhibiting the transcription of NOD-like receptor (NLR)-family caspase activation
  and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 5, which, in turn, modulates the expression
  of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). This decreases antigen presentation
  and tumor recognition. Also, PRMT5 interacts directly with the transcription factor
  forkhead box P3 (FOXP3); dimethylates it at positions R27, R51, and R146; and suppresses
  T cells function. (D) Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) maintains low
  expression of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) repetitive elements that mimic viral induction
  of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway. This inhibits type I IFN
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and decreases the sensitivity of tumors
  to the immune checkpoint blockade.
