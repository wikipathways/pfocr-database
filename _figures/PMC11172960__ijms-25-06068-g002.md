caption: Putative molecular targets and their associated signaling pathways for psoriasis
  in keratinocytes. TNF-α activates Trim33, which induces K63 ubiquitination of annexin
  A2. Subsequently, K63 ubiquitination of annexin A2 activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. TNF-α also activates the FABP5-VCP complex, which in turn activates NF-κB.
  SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB signaling, while HMGB1 activates it. IL-17A or TNF-α activates
  p38, promoting psoriasis development. AhR increases IL-37 expression, and increased
  IL-37 inhibits p38 activity. TNF-α or IL-17A activates ERK, while DUSP1 inhibits
  the ERK pathway. IL-17A or IFN-γ activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which converts
  pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. Activated IL-1β is involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. IFN-γ
  activates AIM-2, which also converts pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. IL-22 activates STAT3,
  and SIRT1 inhibits STAT3 activity. Sharp arrows (→) indicate activation, and blunt
  arrows (⊣) indicate inhibition. Yellow circles represent K63 ubiquitination of annexin
  A2
