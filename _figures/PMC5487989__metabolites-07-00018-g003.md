caption: 'Overview of cellular glucose and glutamine metabolism. Glucose can undergo
  three fates: glycolysis (dark blue), glycogen synthesis (brown), or the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), which has an oxidative (dark orange) and non-oxidative
  (light orange) phase. The TCA cycle (black) reactions that are recruited by glutaminolysis
  (gray) are marked ◊. Enzymes are shown in red. ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP:
  adenosine triphosphate; CoA: coenzyme A; FAD: oxidized flavin adenine dinucleotide;
  FADH2: reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide; NAD+: oxidized nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; NADH: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP+: oxidized nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; Pi: inorganic phosphate; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
