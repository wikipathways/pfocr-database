caption: 'Potential signaling pathways involved in non-genomic relaxation of rat skeletal
  muscle artery in response to thyroxine. T4 induces endothelium-independent vasorelaxation
  due to suppression of extracellular matrix signaling, in detail: 1—contraction in
  response to α1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine increases arterial wall tension;
  2—the tension activates integrin αvβ3 and downstream procontractile ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway which includes ILK and its targets MLCP and MLC; 3—T4 interacts with integrin
  αvβ3 at the site overlaying the site recognizing the extracellular matrix and, thereby,
  weakens the integrin signaling and methoxamine-induced contraction. Key participants
  of T4-induced vasorelaxation discovered in our study are shown in red. Src-kinase,
  ROCK and Akt also may participate in integrin-dependent signaling, but our data
  do not support their role in T4-induced vasorelaxation in skeletal muscle arteries.
  Sharp arrows show activation and blunt arrows—inhibition of the targets. α1R, α1-adrenoceptor;
  CaM, calmodulin; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; MLC, myosin light chain 2; MLCK, myosin
  light chain kinase; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; MYPT1, PP1 and M20 are
  subunits of MLCP; ROCK, Rho-kinase.'
