caption: Unfolded Protein Response. The dissociation of BiP/ GRP78 away from the ER
  transmembrane signalling stress sensors triggers PERK, ATF6 and IRE–1α activation
  in response to ER stress. PERK, a type I transmembrane protein, handles the immediate
  ER stress response through its signalling pathway. Dimerization of PERK activates
  cytosolic kinase and trans-autophosphorylates eukaryotic translation-initiation
  factor 2α (eIF2α), inhibiting protein syntheses. However, phosphorylation of eIF2α
  (eIF2α-P) selectively increases ribosome translation downstream, leading to the
  translation of other mRNA subunits, including ATF4, which initiates an antioxidant
  response and regulates ER homeostasis. ATF6 is a 90 kDa type II ER transmembrane
  protein with a carboxyl terminus acting as an intraluminal sensor and an amino terminus
  acting as a bZIP transcription factor. Recruitment of GRP–78 from the luminal domain
  allows ATF6 to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus,
  where it is cleaved by specialized enzymes (site–1 and site–2 proteases(SIP/S2P))
  to release ATF6 cytosolic fragment, which increases gene production for ER-associated
  protein degradation (ERAD) and folding chaperones. IRE-1α is a type I transmembrane
  signal activator protein similar to PERK. It possesses both kinase and site–specific
  endoribonuclease (RNase) activity. ER stress causes IRE1 to dimerize, activate its
  kinase domain, and catalyzes the excision of a 26-base intron from the mRNA encoding
  the X–box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), regulating genes involved in ERAD and protein
  folding. Adapted from Sprenkle et al. (2017)
