caption: 'Diabetes mellitus induced regulation of osteoblast. Duringhealthy condition
  bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Wnt, insulin
  and neurotransmitter signaling are mandatory to the osteoblast for its normal functioning
  and survival. Binding of BMP with its receptor (BMPR) activates the corresponding
  gene through (a) Smad depended pathway: which requires the SMADs protein (SMAD 1/5/8)
  or (b) non smad depended pathway: in which activates RUNX2 or AP-1 through MAPK-ERK
  mediated pathway. Wnt-Frizzled pathway positively regulates gene expression through
  β-catenin or RUNX2 mediated pathway and Calcium accumulation through PKC mediated
  pathway. TGF-β is also a positive regulator of osteoblast function and exerts its
  effect on the respective gene through SMAD 2/3 depended pathway or MAPK-ERK mediated
  pathway. Peripheral nerve exposure to the osteoblast signals through the adrenergic
  receptor 2 β (Adrβ2) or 5HTR induced pathway. Binding of neurotransmitters on the
  Adrβ2 or 5HTR receptor activates ERK or CREB to induce the expression of osteoblastic
  gene. Insulin is a beneficial factor of bone formation and it exerts its effect
  through GRB2-ERK mediated pathway. During diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperglycemia
  may induce the expression of several BMP inhibitors including MGP, Noggin, Sost,
  Gremlin, TWSG1 as well as several Wnt inhibitors including DKK-1, Sost. DM also
  induces the production of different proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin
  6 (IL-6), IL-1, AT-2 and TNF which negatively regulates osteoblast functioning.
  Binding of IL-6 with its receptor IL-6 receptor (IL6R) sequesters ERK pathway as
  well as induce the gene to transcribe several inhibitors including MGP, OPG OSX.
  DM induced DN limits the nerve signaling through damaging the peripheral nerves.
  TNF binding with TNFR induce SMURF1/2 and thereby inhibit the transcription process.
  DM also reduces the production of vitamin D which in turn induces the secretion
  of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH binding with PTH receptor (PTHR) inhibits TGF-β
  signaling through inhibiting TGFβ receptor (TGFβR) although PTHR activates β-Cat
  and ERK pathways. DM induced IR (type-2DM) or insulin deficiency (Type-1DM) also
  limits insulin mediated bone formation. TNT: Neurotransmitter; HTR2β: 5-hydroxytryptamine
