caption: A schematic representation of the metabolic pathways for nitric oxide (NO)
  generation in the human body (adapted from Jones [], with permission). The ‘traditional’
  pathway for NO generation involves oxidation of the semi-essential amino acid l-arginine,
  in a reaction which requires the availability of O2 and is catalysed via the NO
  synthase (NOS) enzymes. This O2-dependent reaction is suppressed in hypoxia. Alternatively,
  NO can be generated via the nitrate (NO3−)–nitrite (NO2−)–NO pathway. Here, NO3−
  from dietary sources or produced as an oxidation product of the l-arginine pathway
  is reduced into NO2− via oral bacteria (a rapid pathway) or via the enzyme xanthine
  oxidoreductase (XOR) (a slower pathway). NO2− can subsequently be reduced into NO
  via multiple catalysts, particularly under conditions of low O2 availability. This
  second pathway may serve to maintain or enhance NO signalling under conditions of
  hypoxia, such as that experienced at an altitude
