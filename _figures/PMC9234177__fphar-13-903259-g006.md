caption: 'DATS fights against digestive system cancers in vitro. DATS exerts the anti-tumor
  role mainly in two ways: inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. DATS can
  inhibit cell proliferation by inducing G2/M phase arrest via regulating the levels
  of P21 and Cyclin. In addition, DATS can activate three MAPK pathways and attenuate
  Nrf2/Akt pathway to regulate apoptosis-related proteins. Moreover, it has also been
  shown to induce rapid microtubule disassembly by modifying thiols of Cys12 β and
  Cys354 β in β-tubulin molecules, thereby inducing apoptosis.'
