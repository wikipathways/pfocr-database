caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) has a complex ligand and cell specific
  repertoire of activity. The nuance of its function depends on the affinity of the
  ligands available as well as the presence of antagonists (not pictured). Most members
  of the kynurenine metabolic pathway act as AHR agonists leading to changes in the
  T cell compartment as well as stress hormone release.
