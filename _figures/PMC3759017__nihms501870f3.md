caption: Models of RAF activation and inhibition, (a) In cells with mutated BRAF (BrV600E),
  RAS is inactive, cytoplasmic and unable to induce RAF dimerization. MEK phosphorylation
  and activation occur almost exclusively via BRAFV600E and thus are effectively silenced
  by a selective BRAF inhibitor (blue circle). This would explain the dramatic tumor
  shrinkage early in treatment with vemurafenib. In some cells with wild-type BRAF,
  RAS is activated (RAS*-GTP), presumably by mutagenesis (e.g. NRAS mutations) or
  other upstream receptor events. There are at least two models of signal transduction
  in these RAS-stimulated tumors. In the transactivation model (b), active RAS*-GTP
  mobilizes to the membrane and induces homodimerization or heterodimerization of
  wild-type BRAF and CRAF proteins (Br/Cr), which in turn initiates signaling. At
  low concentrations, an ATP-competitive RAF inhibitor may occupy the active site
  of one of the RAF protomers. Inhibitor binding to the active site of one RAF kinase
  induces a conformational change that facilitates transactivation of the other RAF
  molecule in the dimer; therefore, there is paradoxical enhancement of MEK/ERK signaling
  through the uninhibited partner. At higher inhibitor concentrations, both RAF molecules
  are inhibited and MEK/ERK signaling is completely abolished. In the translocation
  model (c), wild-type BRAF (Br) remains largely inactive in the cytoplasm owing to
  autoinhibitory signals. Activated RAS*-GTP triggers MAPK signaling through CRAF
  (Cr). When wild-type BRAF binds a selective ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitor, the
  BRAF molecule is recruited to the membrane, thereby enhancing the RAS*-GTP/CRAF
  interaction and signaling (as in b). With pan-RAF inhibitors, wild-type BRAF may
  still enhance the RAS*-GTP/CRAF interaction, but MEK/ERK signaling is suppressed
  because CRAF activity itself is concurrently abrogated by inhibitor binding. In
  situations in which CRAF harbors a gatekeeper mutation, such as p.Thr421Asn (CrT421N),
  a pan-RAF agent inhibits BRAF, which then transactivates CRAFT421N; however, CRAFT421N
  is not inhibited by the pan-RAF agent because the mutation prevents drug binding.
  Both models suggest mechanisms by which BRAF inhibition may lead to increased stimulation
  of CRAF in RAS-mutated cells or growth-factor-stimulated cells, (d) Mechanisms of
  BRAF inhibitor resistance include activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  such as PDGFR and IGF1R, CRAF and other protein kinases (e.g. COT), along with mutational
  activation of NRAS and MEK (MEK*).
