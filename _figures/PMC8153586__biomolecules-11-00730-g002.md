caption: The polyol pathway. This pathway contains two reactions. The first reaction
  converting glucose to sorbitol is catalyzed by aldose reductase. This enzyme is
  rate-limiting for the whole pathway. The second reaction converting sorbitol to
  fructose is catalyzed by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The final products are NADH and
  fructose, and sorbitol is an intermediate product. Note that NADPH is consumed by
  aldose reductase in the first reaction. Additionally, accumulation of sorbitol in
  the kidney could cause osmotic problems for nephrons [,].
