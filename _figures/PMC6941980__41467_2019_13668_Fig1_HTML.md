caption: Mitochondria have evolved distinct strategies to integrate environmental
  cues and communicate their fitness to the rest of the cell to maintain cellular
  homeostasis. Release of cytochrome c to invoke caspase-dependent cell death, release
  of reactive oxygen species to oxidize thiols within redox-regulated proteins, and
  induce gene expression and the activation of AMPK under energetic stress to control
  mitochondrial dynamics are three prominent mitochondrial-dependent signaling events.
  Additionally, release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol triggers inflammasome
  activation and pro-inflammatory responses through the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing
  pathway. Signaling roles of TCA cycle metabolites are in part mediated by controlling
  chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, as well as post-translational protein
  modifications.
