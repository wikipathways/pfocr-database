caption: 'Model of HH signaling pathway functions in the E. sinensis testes to regulate
  HTB integrity and germ cell proliferation and apoptosis. In the left part are the
  HH signaling functions in E. sinensis under a normal physiological state: Hh protein
  is generated and binds to its receptor Ptc on the target germ cell membrane to induce
  the degradation of Ptc, then Smo can escape from degeneration by binding to Ptc,
  and the functional Smo transduces HH signaling by recruiting the transcriptional
  factor Ci and other proteins and factors to modify and activate Ci. The activated
  Ci is translocated to the nucleus by Kif27 and promises the normal expression of
  pinin and cell-fate-associated genes. The proliferation and apoptosis of germ cells
  and the expression and localization of junctional proteins are regular, and the
  integrity of the HTB and the testes’ physiological functions are also natural. The
  right part shows that after the disappearance of HH signaling, the expression of
  pinin and cell-fate-associated genes is depressed; meanwhile, β-catenin is translocated
  to the nucleus non-functionally, which fails to activate Wnt-β-catenin signaling
  target genes’ transcription and induces the mis-localization of α-catenin and F-actin;
  then the anchoring junctions are disrupted, leading to pressure on ZO1 and changes
  in the localization of ZO1 to stabilize cellular survival'
