caption: 'Modulation of mitochondrial quality control by the p38 stress kinase. When
  mitochondrial stress occurs, ROS production results in the activation of p38. Through
  its downstream effectors, PINK1 and CDK5, this pathway results in an increase in
  the proteolytic activity of mitochondrial HTRA2, which in turn contributes to the
  suppression of mitochondrial damage by enhancing protein quality control. By promoting
  the recruitment of cytosolic parkin to damaged mitochondria, PINK1 can also contribute
  to the clearance of these organelles through mitophagy. Antioxidant systems modulate
  the levels of ROS and can therefore affect signalling from p38 to either PINK1 or
  CDK5. Yellow: mitochondrial proteins; cyan: cytosolic proteins.'
