caption: Proposed working model for the signal transduction crosstalk between E-cadherin/β-catenin
  and NF-κB signaling pathways. Leptospira colonizes the kidney epithelial cells through
  various adhesins. Recombinant LRR20 (rLRR20) protein interacts with E-cadherin and
  consequently activates β-catenin. The nuclear translocation of activated β-catenin
  promotes the expression of its target genes, including MMP7. Subsequently, MMP7
  is secreted to the extracellular region. The expression and secretion of MMP7 promote
  the degradation of E-cadherin on the cell surface and downregulate the cell surface
  levels of E-cadherin. Meanwhile, the degradation of E-cadherin on the cell surface
  induces the activation of the NF-κB:p65 signal transduction pathway, which subsequently
  promotes the expression of downstream target gene NGAL. The inhibitors used to inhibit
  the specific targets are shown.
