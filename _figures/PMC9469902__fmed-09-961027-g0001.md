caption: Some mechanisms of cytokine storm in COVID-19. (1) NSP9 and NSP 10 of SARS-CoV-2
  target NKRF to promote IL-6 production. By engagement of receptor with IL-6, IFN-γ
  and GM-CSF are secreted by activated T cells; MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1, IP-1O, and CCL-5
  are secreted by activated monocytes; and neutrophils release pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as TNF-α and IL-1. (2) In response to SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells, secreted
  GM-CSF activates CD14+ CD16+ monocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-6 and TNF-α. (3) Attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2, leads to a reduction in
  ACE-2 expression and accumulation of AngII in the host cells. The AngII and its
  receptor (AT1R) complex activate NF-κB, leading to the production of TNF-α and EGFR.
  (4) In COVID-19, increased levels of IL-1β and IL-18 indicate inflammasome activation
  and pyroptosis of host infected cells, triggering inflammation by recruiting immune
  cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. (5) Dendritic cells that are triggered
  by PRRs release TNF-α and IL-1, causing acute inflammatory responses. TNF/TNFR interactions
  between effector CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells have been suggested to promote IL-1β
  production. (6) Uncontrolled immune responses and hyperinflammation cause excessive
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, known as cytokine storms which are related
  to multi-organ failure and even death in COVID-19. NSP, Non-Structural Protein;
  NKRF, NF-κB repressor; ACE-2, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2; AngII, Angiotensin
