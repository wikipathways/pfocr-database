caption: Mitochondrial stress and mtROS in the inflammatory response. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction including mtROS generation, reduced ATP synthesis and glutathione levels,
  and mtDNA release into the cytosol may all lead to mitochondrial stress. Cytoplasmic
  mtDNA can stimulate type I IFN responses via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway and activate
  NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR9 pathway to increase proinflammatory cytokines production.
  mtROS production has been shown to cause DNA damage, unfolded protein response (UPR),
  and inflammatory responses through HIF-1α and MAPK/NF-κB pathways in LPS-stimulated
  macrophages.
