caption: NRF2-related epigenetic mechanisms in diabetic vascular complications. Inhibition
  of HDAC activity by NaB increases the occupancy of AHR and P300 at nfe2l2 promoter
  to promote the transcriptional activation of nfe2l2, thus protecting against diabetic
  arterial injuries. miR-24 stimulates the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway to prevent
  oxidative stress induced by diabetic arterial injuries. miR-200a regulates the Keap1/NRF2
  axis to prevent inflammation, thus improving diabetic BBB damage. The lncRNA MEG3
  inhibits DR-induced apoptosis via downregulating the miR-93/NRF2 pathway. Histone
  methylation of the Keap1 promoter region increases Keap1 expression and subsequently
  inhibits the activity of NRF2 to aggravate oxidative stress in DR. C66 upregulates
  NRF2 expression to protect against DN-induced oxidative stress by increasing miR-200a
  expression. The upregulation of miR-200a-3p/141-3p modulates the NRF2 to protect
  against DN. Omentin-1 downregulates miR-27a and subsequently increases NRF2 expression
  to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation in DN. The lncRNA MIAT improves DN
  by stimulating NRF2. The lncRNA Blnc1 reduces NRF2 expression to cause oxidative
  stress and inflammation in DN. NaB, sodium butyrate; HDAC, histone deacetylase;

  description: NRF2-related epigenetic mechanisms in diabetic vascular complications.
    Inhibition of HDAC activity by NaB increases the occupancy of AHR and P300 at
    nfe2l2 promoter to promote the transcriptional activation of nfe2l2, thus protecting
    against diabetic arterial injuries. miR-24 stimulates the NRF2/HO-1 signaling
    pathway to prevent oxidative stress induced by diabetic arterial injuries. miR-200a
    regulates the Keap1/NRF2 axis to prevent inflammation, thus improving diabetic
    BBB damage. The lncRNA MEG3 inhibits DR-induced apoptosis via downregulating the
    miR-93/NRF2 pathway. Histone methylation of the Keap1 promoter region increases
    Keap1 expression and subsequently inhibits the activity of NRF2 to aggravate oxidative
    stress in DR. C66 upregulates NRF2 expression to protect against DN-induced oxidative
    stress by increasing miR-200a expression. The upregulation of miR-200a-3p/141-3p
    modulates the NRF2 to protect against DN. Omentin-1 downregulates miR-27a and
    subsequently increases NRF2 expression to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation
    in DN. The lncRNA MIAT improves DN by stimulating NRF2. The lncRNA Blnc1 reduces
