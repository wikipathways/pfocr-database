caption: The canonical pathway “Osteoarthritis Signaling” for Epi C vs. Ctr treatment
  group. This canonical pathway has been described as a critical regulatory element
  for the onset of osteoarthritis. Based on the activation z-score (p-value = 1.45
  × 10−3, z-score = −1.213), the normal function of this pathway is reduced. Noteworthy
  is the downregulation of NF-κB (expected activation) and the upregulation of SOX9
  (expected inhibition). Red fillings = “activated”, green fillings = “inhibited”,
  purple highlights = passed cut-offs, no highlight = did not pass cut-offs.
