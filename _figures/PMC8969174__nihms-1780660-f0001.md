caption: 'Associated with early childhood BMI across the first 8 years of life were
  46 distinct loci, representing four clusters: Birth, Transient, Early Rise and Late
  Rise. The Birth cluster contained 9 loci previously identified for birth weight,
  with half of these demonstrating effects in the postnatal period and early childhood.
  The Transient cluster contained 21 independent SNPs at 16 loci with no effect at
  birth, peak association during infancy or early childhood, and little or no effect
  after the adiposity rebound. The Early Rise cluster contained 12 loci that gradually
  show stronger association with BMI from infancy into childhood but only rarely maintain
  effects into adulthood. The Late Rise cluster contained 4 loci with little to no
  effect before the adiposity rebound. Bold indicates previously identified monogenic
  obesity genes involved in the leptin–melanocortin signalling pathway. All but one
  were restricted to the Transient and Early Rise clusters. The leptin–melanocortin
  pathway regulates energy intake and expenditure, suggesting that age-dependent genetic
  variation affecting the leptin–melanocortin system, in addition to numerous environmental
  factors, plays a central role in controlling BMI during early childhood. aLoci that

  effects into adulthood. AgRP, agouti-related protein; Alpha-MSH, alpha melanocyte
