caption: Musashi signaling pathways associated with mammary progenitor cell expansion.
  Notch is processed proteolytically to an extracellular domain (NEC) and an intracellular
  domain (NIC). The Notch ligands Delta1 (DL1) and Jagged1 (Jag1) associate with NEC,
  and induce cleavage and release of membrane-bound NIC. NIC translocates to the nucleus,
  where it serves as a coactivator of CSL to activate transcription of Hes/Hey, Notch,
  DL1/Jag2 and cyclin D1. Musashi inhibits the translation of Numb and p21Cip1 by
  binding to a motif in the 3-UTR. Inhibition of Numb prevents NIC degradation and
  nuclear translocation, whereas inhibition of p21Cip1 prevents inhibition of CDK’s
  to promote G1/S transition. Preliminary studies indicate that Musashi increases
  secretion of the growth factor proliferin, which is known to mediate ERK activation
  through the Gi-coupled IGFII receptor and inhibit GSK3β activity. Msi1 also blocks
  expression of the Wnt pathway inhibitor, DKK3, to increase β-catenin/TCF activity
  by an unknown mechanism.
