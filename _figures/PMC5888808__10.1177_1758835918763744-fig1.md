caption: 'Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the ligand of programmed death 1 (PD-1)
  receptor. PD-1 is expressed on the T-cell surface (mainly CD8+ T-lymphocytes), while
  PD-L1 is presented on the cell surface by antigen-presenting cells (APCs; as macrophages)
  and tumor cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations are
  located in the tyrosine kinase domains and mainly in the form of a base-pair deletion
  at exon 19 (ΔE746_A750) or a point mutation at exon 21 (L858R). Anaplastic lymphoma
  kinase (ALK) rearrangements involve gene fusion partners, leading to constitutive
  protein activation. In NSCLC the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like
  4 (EML4)-ALK variant is the most frequently reported fusion gene. The MET receptor
  can be hyperactivated through gene amplification (copy number gain), or gene splicing
  variants. EGFR, ALK and MET signal via tyrosine phosphorylation lead to the activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) and AKT pathways. MAPK pathway is mainly dependent on Src homology 2 domain-containing
  phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 interferes with the process of Ras inactivation
  catalyzed by Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP), hence increasing the half-life
  of activated Ras (GTP-Ras). MAPK/ERK Kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 are activated upon
  phosphorylation by Ras cascade. MEK1/2 is in turn able to phosphorylate and activate
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1 and ERK2). AKT is the major downstream
  target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by the receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activated PI3K induces the recruitment of AKT to the cell
  membrane, driving a conformational change in the protein. This enables full activation
  of AKT upon phosphorylation. Following activation, AKT translocates to the cytoplasm
  and nucleus, and phosphorylates various downstream substrates including mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both ERK and AKT can induce up-regulation of PD-L1.
  The specific mechanisms of this activation pathway are still not clearly defined.
  SHP2 activates several Src family kinase (SFKs), including Src itself. Upon Src
  activation, several downstream Src binding partners are targeted for phosphorylation,
  including yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). YAP1 is a transcriptional coactivator,
  and has been reported to bind several DNA-binding transcription factors, thus mediating
  up-regulation of several RTKs. Signaling transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) can be activated through Janus-like kinase (JAK) only in the presence
  of Src kinase activity, in low STAT1 conditions. When activated, STAT3 undergoes
  phosphorylation-induced homodimerization. The homodimer translocates to the nucleus
  and binds to DNA. Through the activation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), STAT3
  downregulates the transcription of several genes involved in immune surveillance:
  interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), immunoproteasome subunits (PSM) B8 and B9
  and the human leukocyte antigens (HLA). IRF-1 is a PD-L1 inducer; PSMB8-9 and HLA
  are mediators of effector immune cells activation. STAT1, another member of the
  STAT family, is activated by JAK upon phosphorylation into dimer conformation and
  translocates to the nucleus as well. STAT1 has the opposite function of inducing
  the transcription of IRF-1, PSMB8-9 and HLA. In turn STAT3 can inhibit STAT1 activity.
  Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is a cytokine released in the tumor microenvironment by
  the cells of the immune infiltrate. Once binding to its receptor (IFNGR), it triggers
  signaling cascades that are able to modulate PD-L1 expression. IFNGR can activate
  both STAT1 and STAT3 through JAK1/2. IFNγ-mediated STAT3 activation also requires
  SFKs. The alternative activation of either STAT1 or STAT3 is competitive and related
  to their relative abundance in the tumor cell. IFNGR can also activate cyclin-dependent
  kinase 5 activator 1 (CDK5R1 or p35), the main CDK5 activator. CDK5 inhibits interferon
  regulator factor 2 (IRF-2) and IRF2BP2 that are PD-L1 co-repressors.'
