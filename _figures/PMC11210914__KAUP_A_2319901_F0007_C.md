caption: CMA- or TAX1BP1-mediated GPX4 degradation in ferroptosis. CMA serves as a
  pathway for GPX4 protein degradation during ferroptosis. LAMP2 plays a key role
  in transporting GPX4 across the lysosomal membrane, and HSPA8/HSC70 interacts with
  GPX4 and LAMP2, facilitating CMA. CMA-mediated degradation of GPX4 can be inhibited
  by CKB-mediated GPX4 phosphorylation. LGMN assists in CMA-mediated GPX4 degradation.
  Furthermore, macroautophagy/autophagy also contributes to GPX4 degradation during
  ferroptosis. SMPD1/ASM promotes the autophagic degradation of GPX4, whereas MTOR
  inhibits GPX4 protein degradation and subsequent ferroptosis. Copper directly binds
  to GPX4, leading to its autophagic degradation, and, in this process, TAX1BP1 acts
  as an autophagic receptor
