caption: Proposed signaling pathway activated by oxidative stress in NHEKs. Molecules
  enclosed in ovals indicate those described in this study. H2O2-induced ROS stimulates
  an increase in intracellular Ca2+ following the autophosphorylation of PYK2, resulting
  in PI3K phosphorylation. Alternatively, DKK1 can bind to CKAP4 and activate the
  PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, AKT is fully activated through phosphorylation by both PDK-1
  and mTORC2, which in turn activates mTORC1 to promote survival in cells and reduces
  ROS levels via p65 phosphorylation. H2O2 activates the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway to phosphorylate
  ERK via transactivation of EGFR. ASK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of JNK
  and p38, which is regulated by the available amounts of TXN and TXNIP. ROS and TXNIP
  increase free ASK2 levels from the ASK2/TXN complex by TXN oxidation and trapping
  TXN in a TXN/TXNIP complex, respectively. ROS activates the WNT/β-catenin pathway
  by releasing free DVL from the DVL/NRX complex through NRX oxidation. Additionally,
  TXNIP suppresses WNT/β-catenin signaling, which increases DKK1 production via the
  β-catenin/FOXM1 pathway. EGFR, EGF receptor; DVL, disheveled segment polarity protein;
  NRX, nucleoredoxin; mTORC, mammalian target of rapamycin complex; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1; PYK2, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2
