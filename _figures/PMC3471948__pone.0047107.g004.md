caption: 'A. Fold change scatterplots. Cross species comparison of the fold changes
  expression of the genes in the pathway “Cell cycle, Influence of Ras and Rho proteins
  on G1/S transition” from GeneGo (see also ). The data were analyzed as described
  in . Thirteen genes have been highlighted in order to follow their expression in
  the three comparisons. B. Expression signal profile plots. Expression level of 13
  selected genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. In blue are marked
  the expression level of the genes in the mouse and in red the one in the rat embryos.
  MO: Morula, ICM: Inner cell mass, BL: Blastocyst. The unit is log2 of measured expression.'
