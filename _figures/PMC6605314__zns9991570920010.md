caption: A schematic model of GPCR-mediated gene expression in neurons. The expression
  of Bdnf and other CN-dependent genes under the activation of GPCR was induced through
  the Ca2+/CN/CRTC1/CREB pathway. The direct activation of NMDAR by an excitatory
  input activated the expression of Bdnf via multiple Ca2+signaling pathways, including
  CN, CaMK, and MAPK. Once the activation of GPCR was induced simultaneously with
  excitatory neurotransmission, the expression of Bdnf and other CN-dependent genes
  in particular were upregulated synergistically by the CN pathway. Therefore, coincident
  NMDAR activation by a glutamatergic input and GPCR activation by neuromodulators
  into neurons efficiently induced CN-dependent gene expression.
