caption: Simplified depiction of tryptophan breakdown in the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan
  (TRP) that is not transported across the blood brain barrier (BBB) for the synthesis
  of serotonin (5-HT) is degraded into kynurenine (KYN) by the enzymes indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). After this point, KYN
  is further degraded along one of two distinct branches; either the kynurenine-nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (KYN-NAD) branch, or the kyneine-kynurenic acid (KYN-KYNA)
  branch. Within the KYN-NAD branch, KYN is acted on by the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
  (KMO) whereby it is converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and later quinolinic
  acid (QUIN) via a spontaneous reaction (and ultimately NAD+). Within the KYN-KYNA
  branch, KYN is acted on by the enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) whereby
  it is converted to kynurenic acid (KYNA).
