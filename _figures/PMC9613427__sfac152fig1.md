caption: 'LOF TNFAIP3 variants, GOF TLR7 variants and LN. B lymphocytes are central
  players in SLE. Degradation of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from processed ssRNA
  yields guanosine and 2¢,3¢-cyclophosphate guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that are
  recognized by the BCR and ssRNA is endocytosed complexed with BCR and delivered
  to endosomes, thus allowing ssRNA interaction with TLR7. TLR7 then recruits the
  adaptor Myd88 and signals to activate NF-κB and IRF7, leading to synthesis and secretion
  of cytokines (yellow, green, red dots) and type I IFN (T1-INF, blue dots). The TNFAIP3
  gene encodes the A20 protein, a negative regulator of NF-κB (and of NF-κB association
  with IRF7), contributing to B-cell tolerance []. GOF variants of TLR7 break B-cell
  tolerance, leading to SLE, as exemplified by Y264H, F507L and R28G []. TLR7 GOF
  variants may disrupt B-cell tolerance resulting in increased proliferation of autoimmune
  B cells, antigen presentation to autoreactive T cells, differentiation to plasma
  cells and cytokine production [, ]. Cytokines contribute to inflammation, while
  T1-INF endocrine or paracrine (from activated DCs []) loops decisively contribute
  to loss of tolerance. The introduction of the TLR7-Y264H variant in mice resulted
  in SLE characterized by autoimmunity, tissue injury and inflammation, including
  LN, and this was prevented by Myd88 deficiency []. Also recently, LOF mutations
  in TNFAIP3 decisively contribute to loss of tolerance and LN []. BCR: B-cell receptor;
  IFNAR: interferon-α/β receptor; ssRNA: single-stranded RNA.'
