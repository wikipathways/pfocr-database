caption: HSV modulates apoptosis signaling. Apoptosis is activated through both extrinsic
  and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway, the ligation of a death receptor
  (e.g. tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; TNFR1) by its ligand promotes the assembly
  of the membrane-associated Complex I, which is composed of TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1, and
  cIAPs. This complex can activate NF-κB that initiates the transcription of some
  anti-apoptosis genes, such as cFLIP, IAPs and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family. During
  apoptosis, Complex I eventually triggers formation of Complex II, which is composed
  of FADD, RIP1, and pro-caspase-8, and leads to the activation of caspase-8. In the
  intrinsic pathway, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
  causing the formation of the apoptosome with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9, resulting
  in the activation of caspase-9. Activated caspase-8 and caspase-9 in turn cleave
  and activate downstream executioner caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 for
  the execution of apoptosis. Activated caspase-8 also can engage the intrinsic pathway
  via cleavage of Bid to form tBid. HSV encodes anti-apoptotic viral proteins to subvert
  apoptotic signaling. Us3 can block the intrinsic pathway while R1 and LAT prevent
  the extrinsic pathway. gJ and LAT blocks both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways.
  gD activates NF-κB to enhancing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. The regulatory
  proteins ICP4, ICP24 and ICP27 may indirectly inhibit apoptosis by promoting the
  production of later anti-apoptotic viral gene products. UL14 has HSP-like functions
  that may block caspases activation and apoptosis. Conversely, ICP0 promotes caspase
  activation and apoptosis

  description: HSV modulates apoptosis signaling. Apoptosis is activated through both
    extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway, the ligation of a

    During apoptosis, Complex I eventually triggers formation of Complex II, which

    In the intrinsic pathway, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
