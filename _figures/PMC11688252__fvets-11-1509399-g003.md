caption: D-lactate-induced NET formation is sustained through metabolic reprogramming
  of bPMN. Bovine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (bPMN) incorporate D-lactate through
  MCT-1, which induces the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent
  stabilization of HIF-1α. Additionally, D-lactate triggers the activation of PAD4,
  which catalyzes the transformation of arginine residues to citrulline in histones,
  leading to chromatin decondensation. HIF-1 activation is primarily responsible for
  the metabolic reprogramming necessary to energetically sustain NET release, through
  the overexpression of enzymes associated with glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and glycogen
  metabolism. D-lactate also increases the production of mtROS, mainly through mitochondrial
  complex I, a molecular mechanism necessary to induce the stabilization of HIF-1α
  and, consequently, the greater transcriptional activity of HIF-1. Furthermore, D-lactate
  promotes bPMN adhesion to endothelial cells through a mechanism involving the increased
  expression of CD11b and shedding of L-selectin. MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter
  1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; HIF-1α and HIF-1β,
  hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and beta subunits, respectively; mtROS, mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species; PAD4, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4; Cit, citrulline; ICAM,
  intercellular adhesion molecule; NET, neutrophil extracellular traps. Figure created
