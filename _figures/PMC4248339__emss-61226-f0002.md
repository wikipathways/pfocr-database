caption: The central signaling modules of the antimicrobial response of the nematode
  are conserved MAP kinase mediated signaling cascades. Upon exposure to fungi and
  intestinal infection the p38 homolog PMK-1 is induced via upstream kinases NSY-1
  and SEK-1 and the scaffold protein TIR-1. The receptor that activates TIR-1 is still
  unknown. The PMK-1 induced nuclear response is to a large extent mediated by the
  transcription factor ATF-7 leading to expression of putatively secreted innate immune
  effectors such as C-type lectins, CUB domain containing proteins and antimicrobial
  peptides. Another MAP kinase homolog - MPK-1/ERK, is activated during infection
  with Microbacterium nematophilum by upstream kinases LIN-45 and MEK-2. The transcriptional
  response that is triggered by MPK-1 is similar to the one mediated by PMK-1 however
  the exact nuclear mediator is not known. Also the TGF-beta related pathway consisting
  of a secreted ligand DBL-1, two membrane anchored receptors (SMA-6 and DAF-4) and
  three cytoplasmic signal transducers (SMA-2-4), is implicated in antimicrobial defense
  based on the need of its functionality for the infection survival and on gene expression
  profiles of respective loss of function mutants.
