  mouse thymoma kinase (PIP3K/AKT) pathway cross-talk with the Hippo pathway via Yes-associated
  protein (YAP). YAP is a transcription factor that can induce for example expression
  of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and Bcl-xL []. (Of note, there are a plethora
  of cross-talks between all these pathways that are not discussed here for simplication
  purposes). Arrows: interaction with another protein or promotion of a specific cell
