caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in HMGA1 transgenics at 12 months
  (parametric approach). Using 715 differentially expressed genes as the focus gene
  set, identified by a parametric approach and IPA, the highest-scoring network was
  DNA Replication, Recombination and Repair, Cancer, and Cell Cycle (score = 48).
  Colors, arrows, lines and abbreviations are described under Figure 1.
