caption: Reactions catalyzed by PurT transformylase (A) and PurK (B). The common catalytic
  steps are the formation of an acyl phosphate intermediate upon ATP cleavage, followed
  by the nucleophilic attack on the carboxyl carbon of the intermediates by the amino
  nitrogen of the mononucleotides. The intermediates are formyl phosphate for PurT
  and carboxyl phosphate (or a CO2 breakdown product) for PurK, respectively.
