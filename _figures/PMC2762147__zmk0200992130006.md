caption: 'Dual activities of Mss51, and the stabilization of Mss51–Cox1 interaction
  by Cox14, couple Cox1 synthesis to assembly (see Discussion). 1) Mss51 and Pet309
  activate COX1 mRNA through the 5′-UTR. 2) Mss51 interacts with newly synthesized
  Cox1 and allows completed translation through an unknown mechanism (). 3) Cox14
  enters a complex that stabilizes the binding of Mss51 to newly synthesized Cox1.
  4) Shy1 associates with the complex shown in 3 and facilitates dissociation of an
  early assembly intermediate (5) and Mss51 (6). Released Mss51 is available to activate
  another round of COX1 mRNA translation. Not shown: the protein Coa1 enters the pathway
  in step 3 or 4 (), and Coa2 enters the assembly complex downstream of step 4 ().
  Cox14 and Shy1 remain associated with assembled cytochrome oxidase supercomplexes
  ().'
