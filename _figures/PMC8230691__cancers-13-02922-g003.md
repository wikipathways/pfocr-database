caption: Glycolysis and aerobic respiration. The first phase of glycolysis (blue box)
  is the destabilization of glucose, resulting in the formation of glucose 6-phosphate
  (Glucose-6-P), which is further processed to β-d-Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP).
  In the second phase of glycolysis, FBP is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (G-3-P). In the final phase of glycolysis, G-3-P undergoes several steps to generate
  pyruvate and 2 ATP molecules. In the presence of sufficient oxygen, pyruvate is
  transported into the mitochondria where pyruvate is processed by the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle that transfers electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC)
  for oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ~36 molecules of ATP. In contrast,
  anaerobic or aerobic glycolysis instead uses LDH to facilitate the conversion of
  pyruvate and NADH to lactate, NAD+, and two ATP molecules. Growth factors mediate
  glycolytic metabolism through activation of tyrosine kinases (such as HER2/ErbB2)
  and/or Akt activation. Akt activates glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase (HK)
  and phosphofructokinase (PFK). In addition to activating Akt, tyrosine kinases increase
  the levels of peptides phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. As pyruvate kinases
  M2 (PKM) binds to phosphotyrosine on peptides, this subsequently results in increased
  binding of phosphotyrosine peptides to PKM. This binding suppresses the PKM-mediated
  generation of pyruvate to be used in glycolysis. Furthermore, Akt activates the
  mTOR pathway, thereby stimulating protein synthesis and up-regulating numerous components
  of the glycolytic pathway. With low levels of ATP, LKB1-activated AMPK can inhibit
  mTOR-dependent protein synthesis and the activation of glycolytic genes.
