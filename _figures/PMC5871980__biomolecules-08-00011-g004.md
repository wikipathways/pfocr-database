caption: The role of Dot1 in the DNA damage response. The yeast proteins are shown,
  and the steps in which Dot1 has a positive effect are outlined in red. Several different
  DNA repair pathways can be used to respond to different types of DNA damage, and
  Dot1 is implicated in a number of these. Loss of H3K79me impairs ultraviolet (UV)-induced
  lesion repair pathways, leading to UV-hypersensitivity. Dot1 maintains genomic integrity
  by inhibiting the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway in response to alkylating
  agents. Recruitment of Dot1 and subsequent recruitment of Rad9 are required for
  regulating the 5′–3′ resection step in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair
  of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Additionally,
  H3K79 methylation is required for cohesin recruitment, key for maintaining chromosome
  structure and for efficient sister chromatid recombination (SCR) to repair DSBs
  Dot1 is also required for checkpoint function at both G1 and G2. Following recognition
  and binding of sensor proteins to DNA damage sites, mediator proteins including
  Rad9 are recruited and activated by phosphorylation. H3K79 methylation by Dot1 is
  essential for the recruitment of Rad9 and phosphorylation of the downstream transducer
  protein Rad53, allowing the cell to enter an arrest phenotype at G1/S or G2 upon
  DNA damage.
