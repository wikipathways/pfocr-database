caption: The canonical pathway represented by differentially expressed proteins in
  the BALF between progressive and non-progressive sarcoidosis implementing Overlapping
  Canonical Pathway functionality in IPA. The 121 differentially expressed proteins
  map to twenty-seven canonical pathways. Each canonical pathway is represented as
  a node. The edges indicated at least two proteins between the nodes to indicate
  shared biological function. The Th1 pathway, CD28 signaling, CDC-42 signaling and
  IL-8 signaling are highly-connected nodes detected with this analysis.
