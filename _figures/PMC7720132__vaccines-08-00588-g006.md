caption: Summary of major impacts of challenge with Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22 and
  probiotic treatments with Bacillus pumilus RI06–95 and Phaoebacter inhibens S4 on
  Crassostrea virginica larval immune responses. (A) Exposure of larvae to probionts
  S4 and RI induced the expression of a large variety of immune genes, suggesting
  a strong immune response comprising pathogen recognition through a variety of PRRs
  with upregulation of several TLRs, lectins, and LRRs, activation of immune signaling
  pathways (e.g., TLR, NF-kB, MAPK, JAK-STAT and cGAS-STING), and upregulation of
  an arsenal of immune effectors (mucins, serine protease inhibitors, and perforin-2).
  DEGs also suggest modulation of cell death pathways and inflammation. (B) In contrast,
  in response to challenge with RE22, only a few immune receptors were upregulated,
  and several signaling molecules in the NF-kB pathway were downregulated (e.g., myd88
  and tak1), suggesting inactive immune signaling pathways resulting in lack of immune
  effectors. Upregulation of stress-related genes cox3 and hsp12a suggest increased
  metabolic demand. Response showed absence of transcripts coding for antioxidant
  enzymes to combat oxidative stress. Purple represents gene upregulation, gold downregulation,
  and grey no change in expression.
