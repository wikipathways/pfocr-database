caption: T-cell tumor response and interactions within the tumor immune microenvironment
  (TIME). Priming of T cells begins with presentation of tumor antigen to naïve T
  cells via antigen-presenting cells within draining lymph nodes (and potentially
  in tumor lymphoid structures, TLS) (1). Activation occurs when T-cell receptors
  (TCR) recognize their specific peptide antigen presented by MHC and in the presence
  of co-stimulation signaling between CD28 and CD80/86, with additional co-stimulation
  from inflammatory cytokines (2). Activated T cells undergo expansion and then traffic
  to the tumor where they can engage in direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells presenting
  cognate antigen via MHC. Tumor immune microenvironments can be conceptualised as
  “hot”, “cold” or “immune excluded” (3). “Hot” or inflamed TIME contain abundant
  CTLs and other immune cell populations (dendritic cells, NK cells) associated with
  anti-tumor immunity and expression of inhibitory checkpoints, and thus are more
  likely to respond to checkpoint inhibition resulting in tumor cell death. “Cold”
  tumors by contrast contain more immunosuppressive cell populations such as Tregs,
  TAMs, MDSCs. Immune-excluded tumors contain inflammatory immune infiltrate which
  is unable to penetrate into the TIME due to stromal populations and secreted factors
  such as TGF-β and VEGF. These latter two tumor environments are poorly responsive
  to checkpoint inhibition alone and new combination therapies are being investigated.
  Immunotherapeutic approaches include (A) blockade of inhibitory checkpoints, (B)
  stimulation of co-stimulatory checkpoints, (C) priming strategies to increase effective
  T-cell activation through stimulation of the innate immune system (e.g., radiation,
  oncolytic viral therapy and STING pathway agonists), (D) targeting immunomodulators
  (e.g., VEGF, TGF-β) and (E) introduction of primed or engineered T cells via adoptive
  cell therapy. CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DAMP, damage-associated molecular patterns;
  IDO, indole 2,3-dioxygenase; LAG-3, lymphocyte-activation gene 3; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PAMP, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TAM, tumor-associated
  macrophage; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; TIGIT, T-cell immunoreceptor
  with Ig and ITIM domains; TIM-3, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing
  molecule 3; TLR, Toll-like receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. Adapted
