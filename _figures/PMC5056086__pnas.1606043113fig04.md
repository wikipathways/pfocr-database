caption: C1 metabolism in SYK-6. (A) The THF-dependent one-carbon metabolic pathway
  in SYK-6 for the synthesis of methionine, serine, and AMP. The demethylation step
  is shown for vanillic acid as an example. The carbon derived from the methyl group
  is shown in blue in each molecule to allow the tracking of this carbon in the formation
  of amino acids. The gene symbols in the figure are based on KEGG annotations. A
  detailed pathway for the synthesis of AMP is presented in . (B) Pathway for the
  biosynthesis of histidine in SYK-6. Carbon from the C1-THF pathway enters into the
  histidine backbone through adenosine triphosphate that was synthesized from N10-formyl
  THF. The remaining five carbons for histidine synthesis come from R5P, an intermediate
  of the PPP. ATP is shown in blue to track the carbons that take part in histidine
  synthesis. The gene symbols in the figure are based on KEGG annotations. F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; P, phosphite (PO3) ion; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate.
