caption: 'Examples of the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota (GM), and some
  effects of these metabolites on the bodily functions of the host. Diet and exercise
  are known to modulate the composition, species richness and diversity of the GM,
  which further leads to alterations in the production of the microbial metabolites.
  For example, the GM affect the metabolism of tyrosine and tryptophan that are precursors
  of dopamine and serotonin, respectively. Within the gut, for instance, dopamine
  affects the innate immune system and serotonin plays a critical role in regulating
  gut peristalsis. However, these gut-derived classical neurotransmitters can also
  have direct effects on the brain. The possible pathways include direct signaling
  via enteric nervous system (ENS), autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the vagus nerve,
  or via aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated pathway, or via still unknown pathways.
  Additionally, the GM can alter the production of several other neurotransmitters
  and neuropeptides. In the brain, these regulate, e.g., satiety, reward, and cognition.
  The GM produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) from the dietary fiber, for instance.
  These metabolites can regulate various functions in the gastrointestinal tract and
  affect the ENS. The SCFA can penetrate through blood brain barrier (BBB) into the
  brain, and have direct effects on, e.g., stimulating brain neurotrophic factors,
  diminishing inflammation and enhancing satiety. The SCFA together with bile acids
  regulate glucose and fat metabolism favorably in the liver. However, the metabolites
  can also be health risk factors for disease conditions. The GM-produced trimethyl
  amine is further converted to trimethylamineoxidase (TMAO) in the liver. TMAO has
  been associated with cardiovascular diseases. In addition to TMAO, the GM-produced
  asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes
  under a broad range of circumstances. Higher serum ADMA may be a result of excessively
  metabolized proteins by the GM. In general, the GM play a critical role in regulating
  the innate systems, and several metabolites produced by the GM can either directly
  increase or decrease host inflammation. For instance, the production of SCFA can
  importantly reduce systemic inflammation, which improves the integrity of the gut
  epithelia and BBB. Abbreviations: ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; ANS, autonomic
  nervous system; BBB, blood brain barrier; ENS, enteric nervous system; GM, gut microbiota;
  SCFA, short-chain fatty acids; TMA, trimethyl amine; TMAO, trimethylamineoxidase.'
