caption: A) Alternative splicing (AS) regulates metabolic activity through the production
  of functionally distinct protein isoforms. Fasting decreases glycolytic activity,
  increasing cellular NAD+ levels. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) binds NAD+, activating the transcription
  of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)
  and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) while inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1C (SREBP1c). SIRT1 activity increases gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation, and
  decreases fatty acid synthesis. The NAD+ metabolite, 2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPR)
  is bound by macroH2A1.1, leading to a transcriptional increase in proliferation-associated
  genes. The less active pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform of pyruvate kinase shunts
  glycolytic intermediates into amino acid, fatty acid, and nucleotide synthesis.
  The less active ketohexokinase-A (KHK-A) isoform of ketohexokinase inhibits phosphate
  depletion and promotes nucleotide synthesis through activation of the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). The macroH2A1.2 histone isoform is unable to bind NAD+ metabolites,
  resulting in loss of transcriptional activation. Under fasting conditions, upregulation
  of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) inhibits glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) splicing and PPP activation, reducing fatty acid and nucleotide
  synthesis. B) hnRNP K binds to the exonic splicing suppressor (ESS) in exon 12 of
  G6PD, inhibiting splicing. Fed states have opposite effects through the activation
  of Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor 3 (SRSF3) and increased G6PD expression.
  Activated SRSF3 binds the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in exon 12, promoting splicing.
  Low core body temperature induces Cold Inducible RNA Binding Protein (CIRBP) expression
  through a cold-responsive element in intron 1 that regulates splicing efficiency.
