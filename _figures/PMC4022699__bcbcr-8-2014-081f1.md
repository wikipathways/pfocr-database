caption: 'The complementary signaling cascade pathway inhibition of pertuzumab given
  in conjunction with trastuzumab. HER2 and HER3 are transmembrane proteins with associated
  tyrosine kinases. They each have multiple binding sites, which are denoted, only
  slightly disparate with regard to sub-units #2 and #4. Homodimerization and heterodimerization
  both result in tyrosine kinase activation with the subsequent signaling cascade.
  Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of HER2 that designates its major difference from
  Pertuzumab, which binds to domain II of HER3.'
