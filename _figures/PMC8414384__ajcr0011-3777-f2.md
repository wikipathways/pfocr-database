caption: Three VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathways involved in DC regulation. VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
  and NRPs can bind to different VEGF subtypes. The VEGFR1 pathway inhibits cell maturation
  by promoting the binding between I-κB and NF-κB in the early phase. VEGFR2 can impair
  cell migration by activating RhoA/ROCK and increasing phosphorylated (P)-cofilin
  levels. VEGFR2 may also participate in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, resulting in
  abnormal cell differentiation and decreased DC numbers. NRP1 influences both NF-κB
  and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with Toll-like receptors.
