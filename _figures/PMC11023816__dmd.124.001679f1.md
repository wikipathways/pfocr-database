caption: Vitamin A metabolic pathway and the enzymes involved in retinoid metabolic
  flux in human liver. The scheme shows the major enzymes and retinoid-binding proteins
  involved in modulating the metabolic steps. The ligand-free apoCRBP has been shown
  to inhibit retinol esterification and stimulate ester hydrolysis in addition to
  having ALDH1A enzyme–specific effects on atRA formation. The CRABPs have been suggested
  to modulate RA oxidation by the apoCRABPs inhibiting CYP26 activity and the liganded
  holoCRABPs channeling their ligand to CYP26 for oxidation
