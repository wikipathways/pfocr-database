caption: 'Anti-lipolysis regulation by insulin on the morphological differences of
  adipose tissue. The abnormal morphology of adipose tissues leads to changes in its
  microenvironment, which impairs the anti-lipolytic function of insulin by inhibiting
  the insulin signaling pathway. However, the mechanism through which adipose tissue
  acts on the anti-lipolysis process in insulin has not yet been clarified. Blue→:
  promotion; Red →: inhibition; Red↓: reduction; Blue↑: increase.Abbreviations: IR,
  insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate.'
