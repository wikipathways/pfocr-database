caption: Mechanism of Nrf2 activation. Under normal physiological conditions, Nrf2
  is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its physical interaction with Keap1 and is degraded
  by the ubiquitin-proteasome in the Keap1-dependent manner or the Keap1-independent
  manner (GSK-3β pathway). In the stress conditions, Keap1 is inactivated while Nrf2
  is stabilized. The stabilized Nrf2 performs nuclear translocation and heterodimerizes
  with sMaf to activate target genes for cell protection through ARE. Nrf2 target
  genes include GPx, Trx, TrxR, Prx, HO−1, GST, NQO1, SOD, and CAT which defend lungs
  from further damages. Furthermore, Nrf2 also can be directly phosphorylated by GSK-3β,
  enabling its recognition by β-TRCP, which later marks Nrf2 for ubiquitination and
  degradation through the proteasome. However, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can suppress
  GSK-3β by AKT-mediated phosphorylation and causing Nrf2 accumulation in the cytoplasm.
  The accumulation of Nrf2 further activates transcription of a number of cytoprotective
  genes and protection against pulmonary fibrosis.
