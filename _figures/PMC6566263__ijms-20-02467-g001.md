caption: This figure shows the insulin signaling pathway. The insulin receptor binds
  insulin, has a tyrosine-protein kinase activity, and mediates the metabolic functions
  of insulin. Binding to insulin stimulates the association of the receptor with downstream
  mediators, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and PI3K. The insulin
  receptor can activate PI3K either directly, by binding to the p85 regulatory subunit,
  which produces PIP3, or indirectly, which leads to phosphorylation and the activation
  of AKT. Afterward, AKT phosphorylates the Ser9 site of GSK-3β and inhibits its activity.
  The PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway is involved in the insulin signaling transduction,
  and GSK-3β is regulated and controlled by insulin in this signaling pathway, which
  is related to the glycogen synthesis regulation.
