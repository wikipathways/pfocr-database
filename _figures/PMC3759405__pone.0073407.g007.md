caption: Vascular permeability in the lung can be controlled by Twist1-Tie2 signaling
  depending on the Ang1/Ang2 ratio. In physiological conditions where the ratio of
  Ang1 and Ang2 is in favor of Ang1, knockdown of Twist1, which decreases the expression
  of Tie2, increases vascular permeability in the lung. However, during a pathological
  condition such as endotoxin-induced lung injury, in which Ang2 is upregulated [,,],
  knockdown of Twist1 fails to increase vascular permeability, rather reverses the
  increase of vascular leakage in the lungs.
