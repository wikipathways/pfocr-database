caption: Bidirectional regulation of UPRmt in cardiomyocyte mitochondrial injury and
  mitochondrial biogenesis, a double-edged sword. With mitochondrial aging and stress-induced
  mitochondrial death, the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain will be
  severely affected, which will lead to mitochondrial ATP synthesis dysfunction, excessive
  accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, and then mitochondrial respiratory complexes
  dysfunction. It will eventually lead to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  dysfunction and mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction, which may be
  an important cause of mitochondrial protein dysfunction and mitochondrial damage.
  In the state of mild mitochondrial damage, UPRmt is activated, which in turn affects
  mitochondrial biosynthesis and mitochondrial homeostasis, providing a guarantee
  for the balance of intracellular homeostasis. In states of mild mitochondrial damage
  or dysfunction, UPR is beneficial as it reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  and increases ATP activity to protect mitochondrial function.
