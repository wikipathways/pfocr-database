caption: The kynurenine pathway is initiated by the oxidation of tryptophan via the
  enzymes IDO and TDO, with downstream catabolites having toxic, antioxidant and cell-protective
  activity. Several feedback circuits involving the kynurenines, regulation of the
  Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR), T cell production and balance and activity of the
  cell survival modulator GCN2 place the pathway in a central position to integrate
  many aspects of metabolic and feeding control. Quinolinic acid as an agonist and
  kynurenic acid as an antagonist at NMDA receptors contribute to the activity of
  feeding regulatory systems in the hypothalamus. Effects on β-catenin activation
  and translocation as well as key enzymes in the determination of cell viability,
  such as MAPK and ERK1/2 account for the effects of kynurenines on carcinogenesis.
