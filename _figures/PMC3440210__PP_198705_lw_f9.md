caption: Model for the roles of GNC and CGA1 in the transcriptional regulation of
  chloroplast biogenesis. GNC and CGA1 are positive regulators of chloroplast development,
  growth, and division. The GLK and CRF families of transcription factors also play
  roles in these processes. Light and cytokinin induce the expression of these transcription
  factors as indicated. Cytokinin acts through a signaling pathway that involves cytokinin
  receptors (AHKs), His-containing phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs), and the type B
  ARR family of transcription factors.
