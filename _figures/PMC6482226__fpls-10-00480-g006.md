caption: Schematic of a tentative model for downstream regulatory networks dictated
  by AtWRKY75-like genes in plants. The model is based on the results described for
  AtWRKY75 and its homologs in green tissue from species other than strawberry. Thus,
  the cotton GbWRKY1 (AtWRKY75-like) can activate JAZ1 expression, which interferes
  with the JA-mediated defense pathway and negatively regulate plant resistance to
  the pathogens B. cinerea and V. dahliae (). In addition, AtWRKY75 directly bind
  to the Isochorismate synthase1 (SID2) promoter to positively regulate its transcription
  and stimulate the biosynthesis of SA, which in turn seems to promote the activation
  of SA-mediated pathway and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and positively
  regulate plant resistance to P. syringae (). Also, AtWRKY75 is able to suppress
  catalase activity by directly repressing CAT2 transcription, which directly contributes
  to increase the production of ROS (). Other interactions of WRKY75 homologs, includes
  WHIRLY factors, as described for the cassava MeWRKY75 (). Thus, MeWRKY75 is able
  to activate MeWHY3 transcription and also physically interact with WHY factors to
  form a protein complex and mediate disease resistance to cassava bacterial blight
  infection (). Interestingly, WHY1 has also been associated to senescence processes
  in Arabidopsis (). As a result, the SA-mediated defense pathway is promoted, hence
  the resistance to bacteria and biotrophic fungi might increase, and the JA-mediated
  pathway is antagonized, increasing the susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens.
  Solid arrows denote direct positive regulation of genes or pathways. “T” lines mean
  negative regulation. Dashed lines evidence positive correlation between plant events.
