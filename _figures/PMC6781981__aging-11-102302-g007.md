caption: Schematic representation illustrating the relationship between Nrf2 and IDD
  as well as the protective effects of Kin on IDD. Briefly, the decreased Nrf2 expression
  compromises the antioxidant ability of NPCs, which further contributes to the excessive
  apoptosis and senescence of NPCs under oxidative stress, and eventually the disc
  degeneration. However, Kin is able to activate the AKT-ERK1/2-Nrf2 signaling pathway
  in NPCs, alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and senescence in vitro
  and ameliorating IDD in vivo.
