caption: NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  involves two signaling steps, namely the priming step and the activation step. In
  response to the stimulation of PAMPs and DAMPs, pattern recognition receptors receive
  stress signals and initiate the activation of NF-κB. This leads to the transportation
  of NF-κB into the nucleus, promoting the transcriptional expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β,
  pro-IL-18, and other inflammasome components. Accumulation of cytoplasmic substances
  prepares the basis for subsequent activation steps. Subsequently, under the stimulation
  of extracellular ATP, ROS, cathepsin B, calcium ions, lysosomal proteins, and mitochondrial
  proteins, the NLRP3 inflammasome assembles into the NLRP3-ASC-pro-caspase-1 complex.
  Pro-caspase-1 is then self-cleaved into active caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1β,
  pro-IL-18, and GSDMD, leading to the activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and GSDMD. The
  N-terminal fragment of GSDMD translocates to the cell membrane, promoting the formation
  of membrane pores and cell pyroptosis. With the release of inflammatory factors
  such as IL-1β and IL-18, the occurrence and development of the inflammatory response
  are facilitated. AMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated
