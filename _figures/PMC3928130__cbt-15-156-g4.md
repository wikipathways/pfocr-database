caption: 'Figure 4. Participation of AMPK in chronic molecular responses of cancer
  cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. Chemo- and radiation therapy elicit signal transduction
  pathways at the level of DNA damage, starting with rapid activation of ATM in the
  nucleus at the site of the DNA lesion. To mediate cell cycle arrest ATM phosphorylates
  AMPK, which coordinates its activity with numerous cell cycle regulators including
  p53, p27kip1, and p21cip1 to arrest cell cycle progression. Additionally, AMPK can
  signal to p53 and its downstream effector SESN2 to generate a positive-feedback
  loop of sustained activity under times of genotoxic stress. Following DNA damage
  AMPK activity becomes redistributed to the cytoplasm whereby can modulate the radio-/chemo-sensitivity
  of cancer cells by inhibiting pathways of survival, including the Akt-mTOR signaling
  cascade. Abbreviations: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; SESN2, sestrin 2; LKB1, liver-kinase B1; TSC, tuberous sclerosis
  proteins 1/2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched
  in brain; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.'
