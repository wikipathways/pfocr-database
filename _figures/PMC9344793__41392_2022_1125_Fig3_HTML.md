caption: Regulation of cholesterol transport. Daily food and the hepatic endogenous
  synthesis are the two main sources of human cholesterol, of which dietary free cholesterol
  (FC) uptake is mediated by Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein in enterocytes.
  The endocytosis of cholesterol by NPC1L1 responds to the change of cellular cholesterol
  concentration. FC taken up by NPC1L1 in enterocytes is esterified to cholesteryl
  ester (CE) by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), which is loaded into
  ApoB-48 with triglycerides (TG) mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
  (MTP), to form chylomicron (CM). After TG in CM is hydrolyzed and utilized, most
  of the remaining cholesterol will be absorbed through low-density lipoprotein receptor
  (LDLR) in the liver. In contrast, some unesterified cholesterol is pumped back to
  the intestinal lumen by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins G5 and G8
  (ABCG5/ABCG8) or synthesized into pre-β-HDL by ABCA1 and released into circulation.
  Cholesterol synthesized endogenously in the liver is converted into VLDL with TG,
  ApoB-100, and most of VLDL is then converted into LDL, which is the main carrier
  for transporting endogenous cholesterol. LDL is taken up by scavenger receptors
  in macrophages, where expression of CD36, scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1), and LDL
  receptor 1 (LOX1) is increased in atherosclerosis, further promoting cholesterol
  accumulation. LDL is endocytosed into macrophages and hydrolyzed by lipase (LAL)
  to produce FC. Excess FC is esterified by ACAT1 and stored as lipid droplets, and
  the excess accumulation of CE in macrophages can contribute to formation of foam
  cells. To mediate cholesterol efflux, macrophages hydrolyze CE into FC by the neutral
  cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NEH). Macrophage-mediated cholesterol efflux includes
  simple diffusion, SR-BI-facilitated diffusion, and ABCA1/ABCG1-mediated efflux.
  Among them, simple diffusion dominates cholesterol efflux in normal macrophages,
  regulated by cholesterol concentrations. In cholesterol overloaded macrophages,
  ABCA1 and ABCG1 are critical for cholesterol efflux. ABCA1 is able to bind to ApoA-I
  to mediate the production of pre-β-HDL, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)
  further matures pre-β-HDL particles into HDL3, while ABCG1 and SR-BI mediate cholesterol
  flow directly to HDL3. HDL3 is further esterified by LCAT to produce HDL2, in which
  CE is eventually taken up by SR-BI in the liver and converted to FC. In addition,
  CE in HDL2 particles can be exchanged by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)
  to LDL particles, which are subsequently taken up by LDLR. Excess cholesterol in
  the liver is excreted into the bile mediated by ABCG5/ABCG8 and eventually enters
  the intestinal lumen for excretion in feces. Some other cholesterol in the blood
  can be excreted directly into the intestinal lumen via transintestinal cholesterol
  excretion (TICE) pathway in enterocytes
