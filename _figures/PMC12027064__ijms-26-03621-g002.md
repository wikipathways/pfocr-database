caption: A schematic representation of the microbiota-induced expression of MMPs during
  OSCC. In oral dysbiosis, P. gingivalis exposure stimulates oral cancer cells to
  upregulate MMP-1 and MMP-2, enhancing their invasiveness. It promotes MMP-9 expression
  through ERK1/2-Ets1-p38 and NF-κB signaling, while also driving EMT via the JAK/STAT
  pathway and neutrophil CXCL2/CXCR2-dependent chemotaxis. Additionally, it induces
  the expression of EMT-related MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-10. F. nucleatum activates
  MMP-9 via Wnt/β-catenin signaling, destabilizing adherence junctions, and increases
  MMP-1 and MMP-13 in noncancerous epithelial cells. Finally, C. albicans promotes
  MMP-9 activation through hyphae formation and candidalysin release. This figure
