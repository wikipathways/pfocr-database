caption: A sketch of the working model and interactions of the Hippo, Notch, and NRG1/ErbB
  signaling pathways. Specifically, Notch signaling pathway activation by Jagged/Delta
  binding to Notch followed by two protein hydrolysis releases NICD into the nucleus,
  and then NICD binds to CSL for targeting gene expression. However, Hippo signaling
  is activated by cascade phosphorylation of core kinases (MST1/MST2, SAV1, LATS1/LATS2,
  MOB1), which subsequently phosphorylate YAP and TAZ so that they cannot enter the
  nucleus to bind to TEAD family members. In addition, there is crosstalk between
  ErbB signaling and Hippo signaling, as ErbB signaling activates ERK and thus phosphorylates
  the S352 and S274 sites of YAP to promote transcription of target genes; incidentally,
  this works by acting on the non-classical Hippo/YAP pathway
