caption: 'Schematic representation of the IGF-1R signaling network and nodes of therapeutic
  blockade. The IGF-1R signaling pathway is composed of three receptor tyrosine kinases
  - insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor
  (IGF-2R), and insulin receptor (INSR); three ligands – Insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2
  (formerly known as somatomedins) (, ); and six serum Insulin-like Growth Factor
  Binding Proteins (IGFBPs). The IGFBPs, of which IGFBP3 is the most common, serve
  as regulators of the pathway by determining the bioavailability of IGF-1 and IGF-2
  ligands (). Both IGF-1 and IGF-2 exert their effects through autocrine, paracrine,
  and endocrine mechanisms, and both can activate the IGF-1R pathway. For simplification,
  IGF-1 ligand only is shown binding to IGF-1R. IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R promotes receptor
  homodimerization or heterodimerization with INSR. Ligand-activated IGF-1R first
  binds to intracellular adaptor proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate1 (IRS1)
  and SHC. These adaptor proteins transmit signals through the phosphatidyl-inositol-3
  kinase (PI3K)-AKT1-mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway and through the
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Activated IGF-1R promotes cellular
  motility through activation of IRS2, which alters integrin expression through poorly
  understood mechanisms involving the small G protein RHOA, focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK), Rho-kinase (ROCK), PI3K, and other signaling molecules. Of note, IGF2R is
  a repository for IGF-2, and it has no intracellular signaling activity. IGF-2R acts
  as a tumor suppressor gene, as when IGF-2R function is lost, IGF-2 is able to bind
  IGF-1R and promote tumorigenesis (). Targets for potential monotherapy and combinatorial
  therapeutic strategies are noted in the figure. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
