caption: The three pathways for trehalose synthesis in C. glutamicum and M. tuberculosis.
  The otsBA pathway leads to trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) through
  the intermediates UDP-glucose and trehalose-6-phosphate (trehalose-6-P). In the
  treYZ pathway, isomerization and hydrolysis of a α(1-4)glucan leads to trehalose.
  The synthesis of such glucans proceeds in a way fairly similar to the otsBA pathway,
  with ADP-glucose as the glucosyl donor. Finally, the treS pathway leads to trehalose
  after isomerization of maltose.
