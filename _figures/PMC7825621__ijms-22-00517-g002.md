caption: miRNA targeted network of cancer signaling including senescence. Signaling
  networks of different pathways identified from the analysis of over expressed miRNAs
  in GBM and their associated targets represented in this network. Black filled circles
  represent the miRNA input target genes identified from our enrichment analysis and
  target mapping. Filled Gray circles represent associated genes, having the closest
  functional relationships with input target genes. Gray diamond shaped nodes represent
  sub-networks or pathways, having a functional relationship with the genes of interest.
  Connecting edges are drawn based on the evidence from consolidated pathway databases,
  physical interactions, co-expression profile, pathways, and co-localization profiles.
  A network also showing clusters of four different signaling pathways, as highlighted;
  the top light purple ellipse shows that the most nodes and connections are linked
  to interleukin and immune response. The small circle on the left, highlighted with
  light green, shows transcriptional regulation related entries. The light red circle
  on the right most interestingly shows cancer-linked pathways in genes. The bottom
  yellow circle shows signaling pathways, which are very essential to cell cycle regulation.
  Four senescence-linked pathways are present, containing at least 14 genes, as listed
  in . Pathway information are selected, based onReactomePathway Database entries,
  mapping to the identified miRNA target from the network.
