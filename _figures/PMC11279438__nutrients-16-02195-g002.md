caption: 'Relationship between oxidative stress and weakness of muscle. ROS generated
  from localized inflammation activate immune cells, initiating a harmful cycle characterized
  by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNFα, IL-6, and CRP. Despite
  the presence of an impaired antioxidant system, including decreased levels of GSH
  and SOD, oxidative damage remains unchecked. Furthermore, inflammation disrupts
  mitochondrial function in muscle through the NO signaling pathway, triggering cell
  death via OMM permeabilization. Oxidative stress accelerates cellular senescence
  by activating FOXO and diminishing SIRT-1, leading to heightened MMP-9 and NF-κB
  activity. This escalated oxidative stress precipitates myocyte dysfunction and apoptosis,
  resulting in contractile dysfunction, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and impaired muscle
  remodeling. Additionally, there is a transition towards a type-IIx-oriented muscle
  phenotype with compromised oxygen distribution and utilization, ultimately impairing
  functionality. Abbreviations in alphabetical order: CRP—C reactive protein; FOXO—forkhead
  family of transcription factors; GSH—glutathione peroxidase; IL-6—Interleukin 6;
  MMP-9—matrix metallopeptidase 9; NF-κB—nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; NO—nitrogen monoxide; OMM—outer mitochondrial membrane; RNS—reactive
  nitrogen species; ROS—reactive oxygen species; SIRT-1—sirtuin-1; SOD—superoxide
  dismutase; TNFα—tumor receptor necrosis factor alpha'
