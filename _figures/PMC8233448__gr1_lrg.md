caption: Schematic diagram of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation mechanisms.
  In step 1 (priming), Toll-like receptors are stimulated by PAMPs or DAMPs (such
  as LPS), upregulating the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related components such
  as inactive NLRP3, NEK7, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 via the NF-κB pathway.
  Step 2 (activation) is typically triggered by multiple stimuli in the canonical
  pathway, such as ATP, pore-forming toxins, viral RNA, and particulate matter. A
  number of molecular/cellular signaling events have been proposed as the key mechanisms
  of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, including K+ efflux, Ca2+ flux, ROS production,
  mtDNA, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal rupture and chloride intracellular channel-dependent
  Cl− efflux. Subsequently, the oligomerization and recruitment of NLRP3, NEK7, ASC
  and pro-caspase-1 are initiated, leading to the maturation of pro-IL-1β/18 into
  IL-1β/18 and pyroptosis by the cleavage of gasdermin D.
