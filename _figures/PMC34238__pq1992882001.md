caption: Model for the sterol-mediated proteolytic release  of SREBPs from membranes.
  (Top) Release is initiated by  Site-1 protease (S1P), a sterol-regulated protease
  that recognizes the  SCAP/SREBP complex and cleaves SREBP in the luminal loop between
  two  membrane-spanning sequences. SCAP allows Site-1 cleavage to be  activated when
  cells are deprived of sterols, and it inhibits this  process when sterols are abundant.
  (Middle) Once the two  halves of SREBP are separated, a second protease, Site-2
  protease  (S2P), cleaves the NH2-terminal bHLH-Zip domain of SREBP at  a site located
  within the membrane-spanning region.  (Bottom) After the second cleavage, the  NH2-terminal
  bHLH-Zip domain leaves the membrane, carrying  three hydrophobic residues at its
  COOH-terminus. The protein enters the  nucleus, where it activates target genes
  controlling lipid synthesis  and uptake.
