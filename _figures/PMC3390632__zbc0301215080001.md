caption: 'S. cerevisiae Q6biosynthetic pathway. Accumulation of Q6biosynthetic intermediates
  is caused by the overexpression of Coq8 in Δcoq strains. The classic Q biosynthetic
  pathway is shown in path 1 emanating from 4-HB. Coq1 (not shown) synthesizes the
  hexaprenyl-diphosphate tail that is transferred by Coq2 to 4-HB to form HHB. R represents
  the hexaprenyl tail present in all intermediates from HHB to Q6. Alternatively,
  in path 2, pABA is prenylated by Coq2 to form HAB. Both HHB and HAB are early Q6
  intermediates, readily detected in each of the coq null strains (Δcoq3-Δcoq9). The
  numbering of the aromatic carbon atoms used throughout this study is shown on the
  reduced form of Q6, Q6H2. Coq8 OE in certain Δcoq strains leads to the accumulation
  of the following compounds: 4-AP, 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol; 4-HP, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol;
  HHAB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid; HMAB, 3-hexaprenyl-4-amino-5-methoxybenzoic
  acid; DDMQ6H2, is the reduced form of demethyl-demethoxy-Q6; IDMQ6, 4-imino-demethoxy-Q6;
  IDMQ6H2, 4-amino-demethoxy-Q6H2; DMQ6, demethoxy-Q6; DMQ6H2, demethoxy-Q6H2. IDDMQ6H2,
  2-demethyl-4-amino-demethoxy-Q6H2, and DHHB, 3-hexaprenyl-4,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid,
  are shown in parentheses to indicate that they have not been detected in this study.
  Black dotted arrows (from path 2 to path 1) designate the replacement of the C4-amine
  with a C4-hydroxyl and correspond to the C4-deamination/deimination reaction. A
  putative mechanism to replace the C4-imino group with the C4-hydroxy group is shown
  in blue brackets for IDMQ6 but could also occur on 2-demethyl-4-amino-demethoxy-Q6
  (IDDMQ6) (not shown). 4-AP and 4-HP, which are formed upon inhibition of the C5-hydroxylation
  catalyzed by Coq6, are shown in red. Analogues of 4-HB and pABA allowing the bypass
  of certain steps in Q biosynthesis are indicated in green. Steps defective in the
  Δcoq9 strain are designated with a red asterisk.'
