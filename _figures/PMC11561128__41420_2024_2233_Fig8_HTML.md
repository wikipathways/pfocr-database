caption: Excess endogenous and exogenous Neu5Ac promoted the expression of transcriptional
  factor c-Myc via SIRT3/FOXO3a signaling pathway, contributing to increased transcription
  of GLS2 and accelerated glutaminolysis. With increased α-KG production and decreased
  GSH, Neu5Ac ultimately leads to mitochondrial damage, mitoROS production and pyroptosis
  in ECs and exacerbates atherosclerosis
