caption: BCR signaling and downstream pathways. The BCR consists of a surface transmembrane
  immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor associated with the Ig alpha (Igα, CD79A) and Ig beta
  (Igβ, CD79B) chains. BCR signaling in response to antigen binding induces LYN and
  SYK-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine motifs (phosphorylation denoted by “P”
  in yellow circle) on CD79A and CD79B. A number of protein tyrosine kinases and the
  lipid kinase PI3Kδ transmit survival and proliferation signals and regulate cell
  maturation and migration. Small molecule inhibitors of select kinases in the BCR
  pathway that have demonstrated clinical activity are indicated (See text for details
  and references).
