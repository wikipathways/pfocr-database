caption: Role of cytokines in Th1 and Th2 differentiation of lymphocytes. CD4+ T-helper
  lymphocytes are able to augment both cellular and humoral immune responses. During
  an immune response, cytokines as a component of the microenvironment present during
  T-cell priming can influence the developmental pathway taken by responding naïve
  CD4+ T cells. The Th1 developmental pathway is largely driven by IL-12 activation,
  producing high levels of IFNγ and TNFα upon antigen stimulation, and is responsible
  for regulating cell-mediated immunity. The Th1 cytokine IFNγ also polarizes macrophages
  (innate immune cells) towards the M1 phenotype. Th2 differentiation, in contrast,
  is largely driven by IL-4 and is characterized by IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 secretion,
  which are primarily involved in the coordination of humoral immunity, eosinophilic
  inflammation, and control of helminth infections. The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13,
  as well as CCL2 from monocytes, drives macrophages toward M2 polarization leading
  to high expression of IL-10 and IL1RA. The Th1 and Th2 pathways are regulated by
  a balance of positive and antagonistic feedback loops. IFNγ enhances further Th1
  development and suppresses Th2 differentiation, while IL-4 and IL-10 supports Th2
  differentiation and suppresses Th1 differentiation. In addition, CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+
  T-regulatory cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4+ T cells, mediate general immune suppression
  and can drive macrophages toward “M2-like” phenotypes, which are important for the
  prevention of autoimmunity, but can suppress anti-tumor immunity [, , , ]
