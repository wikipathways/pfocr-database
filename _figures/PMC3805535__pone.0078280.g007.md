caption: Night vision is controlled by ON visual pathway which comprises both retinal
  rod and ON-bipolar cells and involves the neurotransmitter glutamate, its receptor
  mGluR6, the G protein Gαo, TRPM1, and Ca2+. Photon absorption by the rod cell causes
  the rod cell to hyperpolarize (resulting in the “a” wave of the ERG) and decreases
  the concentration of glutamate being released by that cell. This leads to the opening
  of the calcium ion channel, TRPM1, and results in the depolarization of the ON bipolar
  cell (“b” wave on the ERG). In the absence of photon activation, low light conditions,
  the rod cell is depolarized leading to the release of glutamate and the closing
  of TRPM1. This results in the hyperpolarization of the ON-bipolar cell. In contrast,
  in LP/LP CSNB horses TRPM1 is unavailable to respond to changes in glutamate concentration
  and thus the ON-bipolar cells remain hyperpolarized in response to light. The b-wave
  is absent, so the ERG appears “negative” as it is only the a-wave (the rod cell
  response) that is detected.
