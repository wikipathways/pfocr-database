caption: 'BAFFR activates the NF-κB, mainly through the non-canonical pathway whereas
  TNFR1 activates the canonical NF-κB pathway and TNFR3 activates both pathways. The
  survival effect observed in the SNP interaction analyses might be due to simultaneous
  perturbation of BAFFR and TNFR1/TNFR3 which might affect both the canonical and
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathways or their dynamics. Genes annotated to the SNP pair
  significant in the dominant model: TRAF2 functions as a molecular bridge linking
  the receptors to downstream kinases. TRAIL-R4 has been suggested to activate the
  non-canonical pathway through TRAF2-NIK-IKK cascade. The observed survival effect
  by SNP interaction might be mediated through TRAF2 and TRAIL-R4 interplay.'
