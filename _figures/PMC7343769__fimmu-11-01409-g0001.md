  accumulate in lysosomes (lysosomotropism) and inhibit their function by increasing

  especially IFN-I. (7) Cytosolic DNA binds to cGAS, which then synthesizes the second
  messenger cGAMP to mediate STING-dependent transcription of IFN-I. HCQ and CQ block
  the binding of dsDNA / cGAS, thus attenuating the underlying activation of the STING
  pathway mediated by cGAMP. (8) Cytosolic RNA is recognized by RIG-I, the signal
  is transferred to MAVS, then to subsequent interactors leading to expression of
  IFN-I. CQ/HCQ may impair this process. (9 and 10) The release of IFNα, among other
  cytokines, stimulates a feedback activation with notably MHCII and co-stimulatory
  molecules upregulation. CQ: chloroquine; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; HCQ: hydroxychlroquine; IFN-I: type I interferons; MHC: major histocompatibily
  complex; pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cell; TLR : toll like receptor.'
