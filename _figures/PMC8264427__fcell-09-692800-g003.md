caption: The interaction between M2-like macrophages and leukaemic cells promotes
  pro-survival/anti-apoptotic signalling in AML cells. Here, we are highlighting Mφ-AML
  blast interactions that mediate reduced therapeutic response and therapy resistance.
  Secretion of soluble factors (e.g., CCL2, CXCL8/IL-8) from Mφs via the ER/Golgi
  secretory pathway results in a number of downstream signalling events in the leukaemic
  blasts, many of which remain to be clearly elucidated (CCL2/CCR2, CXCL8/CXCR2, and
  speculated involvement of the CHI3L1/IL-13Rα2/Galectin axis). Overall, the net effect
  is the activation of pro-survival pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt/mTOR, ERK1/2/MCL-1) and
  inhibition of apoptosis. Direct cell-to-cell contact, for example via ICAM-1-LFA-1
  integrin interaction, may also result in similar intrinsic leukaemia cell responses.
  In turn, chemotherapy-mediated response (e.g., DNA damage) and apoptosis is prevented,
  which displays as chemotherapy resistance. Despite the development of targeted therapies
  for combination regimens with chemotherapy or as single agents, therapy resistance
  still remains a major limiting factor in patient outcomes due to these cell-to-cell
  interactions (created using Servier Medical Art).
