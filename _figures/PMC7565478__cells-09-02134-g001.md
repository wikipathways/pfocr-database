caption: Molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocytes protection against MIRI and the potential
  effect of concomitant NEP inhibition/AT1R antagonism. NEP inhibition by sacubitril
  leads to increased levels of plasmatic Ang II, Bk, SP, NPs, ADM, and apelin. Increased
  Ang II levels, through a PKCε dependent mechanism, lead to the AT1R and AT2R translocation
  from plasmatic to mitochondrial membrane where they exert their protective role.
  In particular, plasmatic AT1Rs stimulate NOS activity leading to superoxide generation,
  mitochondrial K+-ATP channel activity, membrane depolarization, and MPTPs opening.
  This process enhances the efflux of superoxide into the cytoplasm and promotes the
  activation of pro-survival kinases. By contrast, plasmatic AT2R stimulation leads
  to NOS-NO-PKG stimulation that further stimulates PKCε. In the mitochondria, the
  up-regulation of AT2R/AT1R protein levels controls the MRC activity through a stimulatory
  mechanism composed of ROS and an inhibitory pathway involving NOS-NO. This latter
  exerts a master control on respiratory function as it modulates AT1Rs, while tonically
  suppressing electron transport chain activity. Concomitant inhibition of AT1R by
  valsartan blocks pro-apoptotic mechanisms mediated by this receptor, thereby, empowering
  pro-survival pathways induced by AT2R. Increased levels of Bk, SP, NPs, ADM, and
  apelin lead to PI3K-Akt and GSK-3β protective pathways activation and suppression
  of pro-apoptotic mechanisms induced by ER stress. These cardioprotective actions
  are mediated by NO synthesis and by direct inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. MIRI,
