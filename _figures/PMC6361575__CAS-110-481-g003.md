caption: Smad3 linker phosphorylation negatively regulates transforming growth factor‐β
  (TGF‐β)/Smad3 signaling. Blockade of Smad3 linker phosphorylation (shown as ××××)
  by Smad3 mutant at linker phosphorylation sites (EPSM) markedly intensifies TGF‐β‐induced
  epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as Smad3 transcriptional activation,
  indicating that Smad3 linker phosphorylation suppresses TGF‐β responses (shown by
  a hammer‐headed line under the word Linker). Although the Smad3 pathway plays a
  principal role in TGF‐β‐induced EMT, cooperation of the non‐Smad3 signaling pathways
  is indispensable for target gene expression. Transcriptional cofactors that form
  complexes with Smad3 are activated through Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β),
  Ras/ERK, p38, JNK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. EMT‐promoting transcriptional cofactors
  include Snail, Zeb, Twist, β‐catenin, AP‐1, Foxc2, TCF, and SP1. They are required
  for suppression of epithelial markers, such as E‐cadherin and upregulation of mesenchymal
  markers, such as vimentin (not shown). Arrow‐ and hammer‐headed lines represent
  activation and inhibition, respectively, in signaling pathways. Upward arrow‐headed
  line (red) indicates augmentation of TGF‐induced EMT, metastasis, and invasion by
  mutation of Smad3 linker phosphorylation sites; CDK, cyclin‐dependent kinase; EGF,
  epidermal growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor;
  IGF, insulin‐like growth factor; PDGF, platelet‐derived growth factor
