caption: Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants. Red color denotes the carotenoids
  measured in this study by HPLC analysis and blue color indicates enzymatic activities
  for which gene expression was monitored via real time-PCR. (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
