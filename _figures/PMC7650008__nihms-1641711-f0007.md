caption: Schematic presentation of the oxidative stress influence on AMPK, NFE2L2,
  PGC-1 α, and autophagy pathway interactions in RPE. In response to oxidative stress,
  AMPK is phosphorylated, which subsequently phosphorylates NFEL2L and PGC-1α leading
  to their nuclear translocation and activation of genes that regulate mitochondrial
  biogenesis and antioxidant protein production. NFEL2L and PGC-1α also have a key
  role in the regulation of autophagy. Failure in AMPK –mediated signaling leads to
  disturbed proteostasis in RPE cells.
