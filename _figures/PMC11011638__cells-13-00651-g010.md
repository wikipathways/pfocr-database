caption: A model of the interconnection between Slt and Pal/PacC systems in the transcriptional
  response to ambient alkaline pH. The scheme integrates data from Bussink and collaborators
  [] and the results obtained in this study. SltA is proposed to positively act (green
  arrows), regulating pacC expression and the correct processing of the PacC protein
  via the activation of the Pal signalling pathway at alkaline pH. SltA is epistatic
  to PacC in regulating the tolerance to ambient alkaline pH (blue and orange lines).
  Green lines indicate positive actions by the regulators and in red the negative
  activity of PacX. The ? symbol indicates undefined regulatory activities by PacC
  proteolysed forms.
