caption: 'Model for the regulation of Ste3p phosphorylation by the pheromone signaling
  pathway. Results for Ste3p phosphorylation are explained here within the context
  of a model for Gβγ activation of the signaling pathway originally presented by Pryciak
  and Huntress (). In resting MATα cells (top), the Ste5p-kinase complex localizes
  to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. With a-factor (aF) stimulation (bottom),
  the liganded receptor catalyzes the exchange of nucleotide, GTP for GDP, on the
  Gα subunit, with the consequent dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. Free Gβγ now serves
  as a plasma membrane binding site for the Ste5p-kinase complex. Localized to the
  plasma membrane, the Ste5p-kinase complex is now subject to activating phosphorylation
  of Ste11p by the PAK kinase Ste20p. This process leads to the sequential activation
  of the Ste5p-bound kinases: first Ste7p and then the MAPK Fus3p. Finally, activated
  Fus3p is expected to phosphorylate and thereby activate a plasma membrane-localized
  target that stimulates the phosphorylation of Ste3p. In this depiction, an unidentified
  receptor kinase is shown as the Fus3p target. Alternatively, as discussed in the
  text, Fus3p may act directly to phosphorylate the receptor protein.'
