caption: Potential pathway for enhanced invasion upon mechanical stimulation. Signaling
  downstream of integrin β3, through sequential activation of Rac1, PAK1 and LIMK1,
  results in inhibition of cofilin activity by phosphorylation at the Ser3 position.
  Upon mechanical stimulation, integrin β3 is downregulated thereby decreasing the
  levels of downstream kinases. A decrease in the activation of LIMK1 also decreases
  phosphorylation of cofilin. This leads to an increase in levels of active cofilin
  producing longer and more-mature invadopodia that enhance cell invasion.
