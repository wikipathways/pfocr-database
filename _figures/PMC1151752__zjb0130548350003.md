caption: The purine biosynthetic pathway is shown in a simplified form (modified from
  reference ), highlighting the mutated genes that were tested in the papillation
  assay (PRPP, 5-phospho-α-d-ribosyl 1-pyrophosphate; PRA, 5-phospho-β-d-ribosylamine;
  FGAR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide; AIR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole;
  AICAR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-4-carboxamide-5-aminoimidazole; AdSucc., adenylosuccinate;
  ppGpp, guanosine-tetraphosphate). In ad-dition to synthesis of purines, cells can
  scavenge purines (A and G) from the medium (dashed arrows), which is the primary
  source until exogenous supplies are depleted. The transposition phenotype of pur
  mutants with either IS903 or Tn552 transposon derivatives is shown in Fig. .
