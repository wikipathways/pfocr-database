caption: Major steps in the catabolism of BCAA. The first step in BCAA catabolism
  is determined by reversible transamination by the BCAT enzymes followed by irreversible
  oxidation by the BCKDH complex. Downstream metabolism is then independent for three
  amino acids, ketogenic for leucine and isoleucine (aceto acetate and acetyl Co-A)
  and glucogenic for valine with the formation of propionyl-CoA. Acetyl Co-A and succinyl-CoA
  enter then in the Krebs cycle for energy generation and gluconeogenesis or as precursors
  of lipogenesis and ketone bodies formation. Not indicated in the figure is AACS
  (acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase) located on Chr 12q24.31, which is a ketone body-utilizing
  ligase with a role in lipid synthesis through the non-oxidative pathway.
