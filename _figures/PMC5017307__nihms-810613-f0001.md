caption: A simplistic view of Hh signal transduction is portrayed in the upper panels.
  Recent updates on Hh signaling are depicted in the lower panels. (A) In the absence
  of Hh ligand, Ptch1 inhibits Smo activation and ciliary localization. Low levels
  of Kif7, Sufu, and full-length Gli (GliFL) enter the primary cilium (PC), which
  promotes GliFL processing into a repressor form (GliR) after phosphorylation by
  PKA, GSK3, and CK1. GliR blocks transcription of Hh target genes. (B) When Hh ligand
  binds Ptch1, both ligand and receptor are internalized and degraded. Smo is phosphorylated
  by CK1 and GRK2, assumes an active conformation, and moves into the primary cilium
  (PC). Kif7, Sufu, and Gli also accumulate in the PC, where activated Smo promotes
  Sufu-Gli dissociation and activation of Gli (GliA). GliA shuttles into the nucleus
  and induces target gene transcription. (C) The PC-localized phosphatase, Inpp5e,
  maintains a PC lipid composition enriched with the phosphoinositide PI(4)P, which
  regulates ciliary localization of Hh pathway modulators such as the orphan GPCR,
  Gpr161. In the absence of Hh ligand, Gpr161 localizes to the PC and promotes production
  of cAMP, likely via Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, thereby repressing
  Hh signaling. In the nucleus, the PRC2 complex maintains repressive H3K27me3 to
  block target gene expression. (D) Hh ligand binding to Ptch1 promotes Smurf-mediated
  ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of Ptch1. Smo becomes activated and
  its activity can be enhanced by lipid-based modulators, such as oxysterols, which
  bind to an extracellular domain in Smo. Activated Smo translocates to the PC and
  can localize at a specialized compartment called the EvC zone; from here Smo transmits
  signals to activate Gli. Hh stimulation also promotes the formation of a Kif7 complex
  with the scaffolding protein PPFIA1 and the phosphatase PP2A, resulting in Kif7
  dephosphorylation and translocation to the tip of the PC. In the nucleus, Hh activation
  recruits Jmjd3, which activates target genes by displacing PRC2, enzymatically removing
  H3K27me3, and recruiting the Set1/MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complex. Also, active
  Hh signaling induces Eya1/Six1-mediated transcription of Nrp. The Nrp ligand Sema3
  promotes recruitment of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D to the Nrp cytoplasmic domain,
  where it degrades cAMP and therefore reduces PKA levels.
