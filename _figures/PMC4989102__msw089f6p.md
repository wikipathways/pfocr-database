caption: Network motifs that are coordinately regulated by the miR-17–92 cluster.
  (A) miRNAs in the same cluster target the same gene so that this miRNA cluster exerts
  “reinforced” repression effects on the specific target genes. (B) A single miRNA
  represses target genes through a feed forward loop. (C) A miRNA cluster represses
  target genes through a motif similar to a feed forward loop. (D) Clustered miRNAs
  broadly regulate biological pathways and help increase connectivity among nodes
  in regulatory network. (E) The high-confidence target genes of the miR-17–92 cluster
  are significantly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway (the KEGG pathway accession
  hsa04010).
