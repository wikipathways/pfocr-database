caption: Sequential activation of polyadenylation during oocyte maturation in Xenopus.
  (a) Outline of the transcriptional and translational status at the key stages of
  oocyte maturation. (b) Summary of the signaling cascade activated by progesterone
  during oocyte maturation. Progesterone stimulation releases Ringo mRNA from Pum2-mediated
  repression. Ringo associates with Cdc-2, phosphorylates CPEB, Cdc-2, and Musashi.
  Phosphorylated Musashi recruits the PAP Gld2 and activates translation of early
  class mRNAs. One of them is Mos mRNA. Mos activates the MAPK pathway by phosphorylating
  MEK. MAPK in turn phosphorylates CPEB at a site distinct from the one phosphorylated
  by Ringo/cyclin B-Cdc-2. (c) Phosphorylation of CPEB activates translation of masked
  mRNAs. Translationally inactive (masked) mRNAs are bound by CPEB, ePAB, PARN, Gld-2,
  and Maskin. Maskin binds to CPEB and eIF4E, blocking association of eIF4E with eIF4G.
  Polyadenylation–deadenylation cycles by GLD2 and PARN keep the polyA tail short.
  Phosphorylation of CPEB expels PARN, leading to polyA tail extension. Another factor
  released from the complex is ePAB, which now binds to the polyA tail and associates
  with eIF4E by competing out Maskin and recruits eIF4G leading to translation activation
