caption: 'Genes involved in the l-cysteine biosynthetic pathway in E. coli and their
  putative counterparts identified in B. cenocepacia. Genes of E. coli and S. enterica
  serovar Typhimurium involved in the sulfate/thiosulfate assimilatory pathway are
  shown according to the scheme of Kredich (); those activated by CysB (as transcription
  units: sbp, cysPTWA, cysDNC, cysJIH, cysK, and cysM) are highlighted in light gray.
  Shaded in dark gray are the genes of E. coli participating in sulfonate-sulfur utilization
  (transcription units tauABCD and ssuEADCB) and requiring Cbl (as a direct activator)
  and also CysB (as an activator of the cbl gene) according to a scheme adapted from
  van der Ploeg et al. (). The E. coli genes whose products display overlapping functions
  (Sbp/CysP and CysK/CysM) or partially overlapping functions (TauA/SsuA) are boxed.
  The putative counterparts of E. coli genes identified by us in the B. cenocepacia
  genome are indicated in brackets; “−” indicates no counterpart found, and “?” indicates
  that several ORFs of limited homology to the E. coli counterparts were identified
  by TBLASTN search. For the deduced functions of B. cenocepacia ORFs, see Discussion.'
