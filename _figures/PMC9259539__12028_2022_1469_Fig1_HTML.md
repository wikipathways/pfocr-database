caption: Neuron–microglia interactions in the setting of cortical spreading depolarization
  (CSD). After ischemic injury, neurons and microglia can engage in a self-propagating
  feedback loop, potentially worsening stroke outcome. Initial CSDs, occurring during
  prolonged depolarization of neurons at around − 10 mV, cause increase of extracellular
  purines, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and
  adenosine, as well as potassium (K+). ATP/ADP activate both ionotropic purinergic
  receptors, P2X, and metabotropic purinergic receptors, P2Y, on microglia. Activation
  of P2X channels mediates Ca2+ influx in microglia, whereas the activation of P2Y
  receptors triggers Ca2+ release from microglial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through
  phospholipase C–inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PLC-IP3) signaling pathways. The depletion
  of ER store activates the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, mediating
  additional Ca2+ influx into microglia. These events converge on the major elevation
  of intracellular Ca2+. High Ca2+ levels stimulate the inflammatory cytokine production
  through the calcineurin–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. Cytokines
  affect the CSD threshold in the nearby neurons by modulating N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) currents. Sustained activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) further increases
  K+ leak to the extracellular space, provoking the next CSD initiation and propagation.
  This positive feedback loop may exacerbate neuronal damage in the periinfarct penumbra
  after stroke
