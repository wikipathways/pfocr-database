caption: The folate biosynthetic pathway in a plant cell. Pterin synthesis starts
  with GTP conversion into HMDHP by several steps in the cytosol. pABA synthesis occurs
  in plastids from a chorismate precursor. All three structural parts (pterin, pABA,
  and glutamate) are assembled in the mitochondria and form THF by sequential steps.
  Sulfonamides can replace pABA and convert sulfa-DHP, a newly synthesized metabolite
  in a plant cell system. Sulfa-DHP terminates the other subsequent steps for folate
  biosynthesis. GTP, guanosine triphosphate; HMDHP, 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin;
  DHN, dihydroneopterin; DHM, dihydromonapterin; HMDHP DHF, dihydrofolate; DHP, dihydropteroate;
  DHP-pp, dihydropteroate pyrophosphate; pABA, para-aminobenzoic acid; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  Glu, Glutamate; THF-Glu(n), tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate; Glc, glucose.
