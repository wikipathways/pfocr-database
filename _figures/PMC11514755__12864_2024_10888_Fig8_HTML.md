caption: NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Genes with a green background were detected
  in this sequencing; genes with red boxes were significantly up-regulated; genes
  with black boxes showed no significant changes in expression after LPS stimulation;
  and genes with a white background were not detected in this sequencing
