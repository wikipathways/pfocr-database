caption: Simplified schematic representation of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic
  pathway. A sequence of enzymatic reactions encoded by many ARO and TRP genes are
  crucial for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Specific steps from the pentose
  phosphate pathway (top box, left) and glycolysis (top box, right) generate erythrose-4-phosphate
  and phosphoenolpyruvate, which are processed by the products of ARO and TRP genes
  to generate tryptophan (whose chemical structure is shown at the bottom right),
  tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Tryptophan can also be taken up from the medium owing
  to the activity of a low-affinity permease encoded by TAT1 (gray oval). Genes with
  a role in amino acid biosynthesis whose deletion strongly sensitizes S. cerevisiae
  to HEPB treatment are colored in red.
