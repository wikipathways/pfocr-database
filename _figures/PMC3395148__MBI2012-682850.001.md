caption: Synthesis and trafficking of HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins. Precursor Gag (Pr55Gag)
  (left) is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and traffics to the plasma membrane
  (PM), where it forms multimers (middle). Env is synthesized as the gp160 precursor,
  and undergoes glycosylation and oligomerization in the RER. Oligomerized gp160 is
  transported to the Golgi and the TGN, where it is processed into the surface glycoprotein
  gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 by cellular enzymes. The gp120/gp41
  complexes are transported through the secretory pathway to the PM and are incorporated
  into virus particles (middle). At the PM, most of the Env protein is endocytosed
  into early endosomes (EE), which mature into late endosomes (LE) and then into lysosomes
  for Env degradation (right). However, some Env proteins are recycled to the PM through
  recycling endosomes (RE). During and after virus release, processing of Pr55Gag
  by virus proteases yields mature virions. The protein domains of Pr55Gag and Env
  are illustrated in the insert at the top left. The illustration was adapted from
