caption: Alpha-ketoglutarate binding to the periplasmic domain of RsbU, as could be
  the case when an EB enters the host cell, leads to the activation of the phosphatase
  function of the cytoplasmic domain. RsbW then releases its target protein (black
  box), allowing for its normal function to be performed. That target protein then,
  either directly or indirectly, activates the chlamydial TCA cycle, allowing for
  alpha-ketoglutarate to be utilized. Chlamydia has been shown to be capable of creating
  its own ATP during mid-cycle using a truncated TCA cycle to generate electron-carrying
  molecules (i.e. NADH, FADH2) and a sodium pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR)
  (Liang,2018). As malate builds up in the periplasm, through the export by the SodTi
  protein (Weber, 1995), it acts as an inhibitor as the concentration of alpha-ketoglutarate
  is depleted. The inhibition of the RsbU protein or the depletion of alpha-ketoglutarate,
  potentially later in the developmental cycle, could lead to a slowing of the TCA
  cycle as the Chlamydia cells prepare to convert to the EB form.
