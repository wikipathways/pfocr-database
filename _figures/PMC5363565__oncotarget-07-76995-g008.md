caption: SPS-7 inhibits the activation of PI3K/Akt, which in turn inhibits mTOR signaling
  pathway and activation of c-Myc-cyclin D1-Rb axis, leading to G1 arrest of the cell
  cycle and apoptosis. SPS-7 also induces the activation of cytoprotective autophagy
  that partly blunts the apoptosis. Therefore, combination of autophagy inhibitors
  has been suggested on developing anticancer agents targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways.
