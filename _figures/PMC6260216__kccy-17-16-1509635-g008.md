caption: Scheme summarizing the protective effects of miR-27a on LPS-induced acute
  lung injury via the inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB activation. LPS can induce NF-κB
  activation via TLR4-MyD88 signaling, IκBα acts as an inhibitor of NF-κB, Once the
  pathway is activated and IκBα is degraded, the NF-κB subunit p65 translocates from
  the cytoplasm to nucleus, which triggers the transcription of target genes, including
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and thus regulates inflammatory responses. However, miR-27a
  attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  activation.
