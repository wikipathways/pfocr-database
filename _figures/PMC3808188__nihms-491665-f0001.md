caption: (A) Identity of key players in the hepatocyte insulin signaling pathway.
  In the fasted state, the forkhead protein FoxO1 binds the promoters of key genes
  associated with gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  [PEPCK] and glucose-6-phosphatase [G6P], respectively. (B) In the fed state, when
  insulin secretion is increased and glucose is plentiful, the insulin signaling pathway
  is activated via phosphorylation of the elements identified in (A). In the absence
  of insulin resistance, phosphorylation of FoxO1 heralds an end to its ability to
  activate transcription of PEPCK, G6P, and other genes associated with glycogen breakdown
  and glucose synthesis. (C) The TLKO mice studies by Lu and colleagues strongly contends
  that another pathway serves to shut off glucose production even when Foxo1 is not
  phosphorylated (as is thought to be the case in the insulin resistance state). (D)
  Pajvani’s group contends, on the other hand, that the Notch1-Jagged pathway in the
  state of insulin resistance syndrome activates the downstream transcription factor
  Rbp-Jk, which either with FoxO1, or independently can activated G6P and thereby
  enhance hepatic glucose production. These data imply that Notch1 may be an important
  target in combating insulin resistance because it is easier to therapeutically target
  than FoxO1.
