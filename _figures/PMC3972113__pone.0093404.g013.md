caption: Discontinuous arrows represent speculations and unknown mechanisms; consecutive
  arrows represent known pathways that do not need to be explained for the understanding
  of the figure. (A) In the absence of TLR signaling, the miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a
  cluster (and very likely also miR-125b) is coordinately upregulated, via transcriptional
  activation by either NF-κB as a part of a positive feedback loop or by other transcription
  factors (TF). miR-125a, presumably in collaboration with miR-99b, enhances NF-κB
  activation, probably through the inhibition of the TNF-induced NF-κB inhibitor TNFAIP3  and/or
  other inhibitors, such as IκBε. Thus, the expression of the miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a
  cluster may favor survival of hematopoietic cells, protecting them from the deadly
  effects of TNF-α. (B) Upon TLR signaling, NF-κB is activated through a cascade of
  adaptor proteins. Under these conditions, the miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a cluster is
  not expressed (or expressed at low levels) but the expression of miR-125a might
  be independently induced by unknown (maybe disease-related) mechanisms, such as
  the initiation of transcription at alternative promoter regions or, more likely,
  the differential processing of the primary transcript in one or more stages of miRNA
  biogenesis. Highly increased levels of miR-125a could preferentially target the
  mRNA of one or more genes downstream of TLRs and participate in the negative modulation
  of proinflammatory signaling. In MDS, elevated miR-125a levels in cells with normal
  TLR signaling (A) would favor sustained NF-κB activation and pro-survival effects;
  while in those cells with increased TLR/MyD88 levels and activation (B), high miR-125a
  levels would negatively modulate NF-κB activation. However, in this case, the hyperactivation
  of the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB pathway would probably mask the inhibitory effects of miR-125a.
  Additionally, in both cases, (A) and (B), overexpression of miR-125a in MDS patients
  would favor aberrant differentiation so its effects in either case would be detrimental
  for the course of the disease.
