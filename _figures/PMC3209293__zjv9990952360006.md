caption: IA30-infected pigs fail to induce immune response genes associated with pattern
  recognition of viruses and cytokine and immune cell responses in the lung. Pigs
  were infected with a 106 TCID50/pig of IA30, CA09, or Alb09 (see Materials and Methods).
  Animals from each infection group and a mock group were euthanized at 3 and 5 dpi,
  total RNA was isolated from lung tissue, and global gene expression was determined
  by microarray analysis. Network diagram depicts the relationship between immune
  response genes that show differential expression in response to the Alb09, CA09,
  and IA30 viruses. Molecules in the network were selected from differentially regulated
  immune response genes on the basis of their direct interactions with each other,
  as determined by functional analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems).
  Shading of molecules reflects average expression compared with mock infection within
  each group at 3 dpi. Red indicates that the gene expression is higher than mock
  values; green indicates that gene expression is lower than mock values. Molecules
  that changed less than 1.5-fold from mock infection values are shaded in gray.
