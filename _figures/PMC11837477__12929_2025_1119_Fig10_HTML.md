caption: 'The EGFR roles in fetal and postnatal pancreas development. A β-cell commitment
  and differentiation: Dynamic cell polarity changes are regulated by EGFR, which
  drives β-cell commitment. It depends on the different EGFR ligands. EGF binds EGFR
  and activates PI3K and RAC1 proteins, which reduce apical polarity induction in
  the early pancreatic progenitor epithelium, leading to endocrine commitment towards
  a β-cell fate (first transition). Upon BTC-EGFR binding, RAC1 inhibits αPKC, which
  leads to downregulation of Notch signaling and activation of Ngn3, involved in β-cell
  differentiation (second transition). B β-cell proliferation: Excess of nutrients
  as glucose induces ChREBP expression, that promotes HB-EGF transcription and SRC
  kinase. SRC kinase triggers EGFR transactivation via ADAM metalloproteases. As a
  result, HB-EGF binds EGFR and activates its signalling cascades, including MAPK,
  PI3K/AKT and mTOR, leading to increase of cellular transcription and β-cell proliferation.
  These events are associated to diabetes development. C EGFR transactivation via
  hormones such as GLP1 and Placental lactogen (PL). D miR-124a acts as negative regulator
  of β-cells proliferation and insulin resistance. EGFR signalling activates, through
  ERK and AKT downstream signalling pathways, the transcription factor ETS2, which
  represses miR-124a, leading to expression of genes involved in insulin secretion
  and control β-cells development'
