caption: Homologies between mammalian and insect immune defense pathways. In mammals
  (enclosed in dashed curve), TLR and TNF signaling pathways are unified, in that
  TNF is produced in response to all TLR ligands, and then signals via the TNF receptors
  to induce cell death and NF-κB activation in other cells. In Drosophila, the Toll
  pathway and the Imd pathway are separated, each responding independently to microbial
  stimuli. Molecular homologies are shaded in blue. AMP indicates antimicrobial peptide.
  Genes, implies the induction of many hundreds of NF-κB dependent genes. Figure is
  not all encompassing and is meant to emphasize core similarities between the pathways.
  Illustration made with assistance of Marie Dauenheimer.
