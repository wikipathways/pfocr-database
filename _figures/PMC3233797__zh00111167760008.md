caption: Model for inhibition of HCO3− absorption by basolateral LPS in the MTAL.
  Basolateral LPS decreases HCO3− absorption by inhibiting Na+/H+ exchanger 3 NHE3
  through activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The LPS-induced ERK activation
  is mediated through TLR4 and the adaptor molecule MyD88. Arrows do not necessarily
  imply direct relationships; regulatory steps may involve additional signaling components.
