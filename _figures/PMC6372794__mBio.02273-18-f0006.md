caption: Updated model for holdfast biosynthesis. The model shows a wzy-type polysaccharide
  biosynthesis pathway. Four glycosyltransferases, HfsE, HfsJ, HfsG, and newly described
  HfsL, add monsaccharides sequentially onto the UPP carrier to produce a glycolipid
  repeating unit. This intermediate is flipped across the membrane by HfsF, polymerized
  by HfsC, and exported by a putative HfsABD transevelope complex. Attachment of the
  holdfast matrix is mediated by the Hfa proteins, including newly identified HfaE,
  reported here. Disruptions to the flagellum or the pilus activate holdfast production
  by relieving the inhibition of HfsJ by HfiA. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan;
  IM, inner membrane.
