caption: Hypothetical scheme of molecular and cellular events in the cochleae of aging
  Tg-B1 mice leading to accelerated hearing loss. The aberrant activation of AMPK
  induces the ROS-AMPK-Bcl2 apoptotic pathway in cochleae, resulting in the increased
  sensory hair cell loss and SGN death. The “scissor” in the figure represents the
  knockouts of the AMPK pathway. The conjectured downregulation of AMPK could attenuate
  the apoptotic signaling and ROS accumulation in auditory cells, which accounts for
  rescue of hearing loss in Tg-B1 mice.
