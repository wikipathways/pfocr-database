caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting Wee1 and the mevalonate pathway in cancer
  with p53 mutations. The therapeutic strategies targeting mutp53 in cancer include
  targeting mutp53 directly or indirectly. The indirect strategies include inhibition
  of the critical downstream pathways of mutp53 and the direct strategies include
  inducing mutp53 degradation. (A) Wee1 inhibitor induces replication catastrophe
  and mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells with p53 mutations. (B) Statins inhibit
  mevalonate pathway and promote degradation of mutp53 and induce ferroptosis. Mevalonate-5-phosphate
  (MVP) promotes mutp53 stabilization by increasing the interaction between mutp53
  and KSP40/DNAJA1 and inhibiting CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of mutp53. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with statins represents a novel
  therapeutic strategy of targeting cancers with mutp53 by inducing mutp53 degradation,
  inhibiting prenylation of oncogenes and cholesterol synthesis, as well as inducing
  ferroptosis by inhibiting the biosynthesis of GPX4 and CoQ10.
