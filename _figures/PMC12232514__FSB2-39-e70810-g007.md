caption: The effects of various azo dyes on GI health. (A) He et al. reported that
  azo reduction of Allura Red (AR) and Sunset Yellow (SY) by B. ovatus and E. faecalis
  produced the metabolite ANSA‐Na, leading to an IL‐23‐dependent colitis mediated
  by CD4+ T‐cells and IFN‐γ production [23]. (B) Kwon et al. identified that chronic
  AR exposure promoted experimental colitis via colonic 5‐HT in both a gut microbiota‐dependent
  and ‐independent pathway and by decreasing intestinal barrier integrity through
  MLCK [24]. (C) Zahran and colleagues showed that SY exposure activated the NLRP3
  inflammasome, leading to the production of IL‐18 and IL‐1β and inducing microbial
  dysbiosis, which resulted in increased LPS production and impaired barrier function
  via altered adherens junction (AJ) complexes [25]. Image created in BioRender
