caption: Signaling pathway of TNFR-1. Optimal signaling activity requires receptor
  trimerization. TNFR-1, with its death domain (DD), initially recruits TRADD (TNFR-associated
  death domain) and Fas-associated death domain (FADD), forming Complex II, which
  activates caspase-8 mediated apoptosis. TNFR-1 also induces apoptosis by activating
  caspase-2 through the recruitment of RIP (receptor-interacting protein), which also
  has a functional component that can initiate NF-κB and c-Jun activation, both favoring
  cell survival and proinflammatory functions via Complex I formation. DED, death
  effector domain; RAIDD, RIP-associated ICH-1-like protein with death domain; IAP,
  inhibitor of apoptosis proteins; MEKK1, mitogen-activated protein/Erk kinase kinase-1;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; 1-κB/NF-κB, inactive complex
  of NF-κB that becomes activated when I-kB portion is cleaved.
