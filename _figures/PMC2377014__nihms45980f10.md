caption: 'Model for BDNF enhancement of glutamate-induced phase shifting in the SCN,
  and potential locations in the signaling pathway where ethanol could inhibit this
  process. Glutamate released from the retinohypothalamic nerve terminals (RHT) activates
  post-synaptic NMDA receptors, induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and activates
  NOS to produce NO. Subsequent downstream processes lead to phase delays or phase
  advances, depending on the time of stimulation (early or late night, respectively)
  by altering transcription of circadian clock genes. Full activation of these processes
  requires phosphorylation of the NMDA receptors through BDNF/TrkB receptor activation
  of a Src family kinase. Ethanol could inhibit BDNF/TrkB enhancement of glutamate
  signaling through several different mechanisms. Glutamate inhibition of serotonergic
  phase shifting during the subjective day involves processes downstream from NO generation.

  AMP-dependent response element binding protein; Ryn: ryanodine receptor.'
