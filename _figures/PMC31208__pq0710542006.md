caption: 'Proposed scheme of integrated control of appetite and fat metabolism by  the
  leptin-POMC pathway. (A) In a situation of  homeostasis, intake (feeding) and usage
  (metabolism) of fuel is  balanced. Adipocytes release leptin, which binds to leptin
  receptors on  central melanocortin-producing neurons. Leptin-induced release of
  MSH  allows binding of MSH to central MC-R bearing neurons and a decrease in  food
  intake, and it allows diffusion of central MSH to the periphery,  where it binds
  to MC-Rs on adipocytes, causing a mobilization of fat  stores. In obese mutants
  this homeostasis is out of balance: In the  pomc/pomc mutant (B) adipocytes release  large
  quantities of leptin; however, no MSH is released in response to  it. Both central
  and peripheral lack of signaling of MSH leads to  hyperphagia and sequestration
  of fuel into storage. In the  ob/ob mutant (C) no functional leptin  is available,
  causing a less than sufficient amount of MSH to be  released, hence contributing
  to both hyperphagia and sequestration of  fuel into storage. Peripheral administration
  of MSH leads to  mobilization of fat stores and to weight loss or slowing  weight
  gain by reconstituting the MSH lacking in the  pomc/pomc mutant or by boosting the
  insufficient  amount of MSH in the ob/ob mutant  (D).'
