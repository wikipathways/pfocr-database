caption: Glycolysis orchestrates the behaviour of inflammatory cells. Upon inflammation,
  immune cells are reprogrammed towards glycolysis, enhancing this pathway at the
  expense of OXPHOS and, in macrophages, disbalancing the TCA cycle. As a consequence,
  glycolysis and broken TCA cycle‐released metabolites such as lactate, citrate or
  succinate accumulate in immune cells promoting signalling, post‐translational and
  epigenetic modifications which drive the inflammatory response. Moreover, glycolytic
  intermediates fuel other pathways such as the PPP, which provides biosynthetic molecules,
  and the hexosamine one, which generates UDP‐GlcNAc for glycation reactions. Citr,
  citrate; Fum, fumarate; Gln, glutamine; Itac, itaconate; Lact, lactate; Pyr, pyruvate;
  Succ, succinate.
