caption: The role of TRAPPC4 and TRAPPC9 in cell signaling. TRAPPC4 (Synbindin) is
  involved in the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK signaling pathway. RAS translocates from the plasma
  membrane to the Golgi where association with GRP1 promotes a phosphorylation cascade
  of MEK and ERK. TRAPPC4 binds to MEK1 and ERK in the Golgi after phosphorylation
  of ERK2 by MEK and activation of nuclear and cytoplasmic ERK targets [52]. ERK targets
  cause enhanced cell proliferation and migration in cancer [55]. TRAPPC9 functions
  within the NFκB pathway by binding to NIK and IKK2, leading to phosphorylation of
  IKK1, which then phosphorylates P100, promoting P100 cleavage and processing of
  P100 to P52, which, in conjunction with RelB, forms the activated NFκB complex [52,55,56,57].
