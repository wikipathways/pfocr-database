caption: The key actors of reelin signaling. The two neuronal receptors of reelin
  are depicted in green, along with their downstream effector molecules. On the left,
  we show the mechanism of how the cellular migration and the dendritogeneis are promoted
  by reelin, while on the right the main intracellular pathway leading to synaptic
  plasticity and synaptogenesis is highlighted. Both mechanisms are essential for
  the newborn granule cells to establish functional contacts with entorhinal input
  axons. More than two decades of research link AD to a deficit of adult reelin signaling
  hence some key reports describing prominent links to particular signaling molecules
  are indicated and coupled to those molecules with a red arrow.
