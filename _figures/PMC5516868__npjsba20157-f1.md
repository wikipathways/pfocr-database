caption: The Snf1 pathway and its components. The reaction graph depicts the pathway
  components of the NR1 network, and the different reactions they take part in (excluding
  the nuclear import and export reactions, and the nuclear pore complex mediating
  them). The SNF1 complex is regulated by kinases, phosphatases and other modifiers
  shown at the top. The transcriptional regulation is shown at the bottom. The coloured
  circles represent components and coloured edges represent different classes of reactions.
  The information in the reaction graph is only topological, and the edges cannot
  be interpreted in terms of information flow. However, most of them do carry information,
  as shown in the regulatory graph ().
