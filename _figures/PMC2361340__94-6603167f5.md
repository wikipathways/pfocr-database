caption: Differential targets of copy number-induced expression changes in key biochemical
  pathways between SCLC and NSCLC. Strong PSCNA-induced expression differences were
  identified between SCLC and NSCLC in several key pro-proliferate pathways. Genes
  with increased expression in SCLC when compared to NSCLC are indicated in green,
  while genes with increased expression in NSCLC are indicated in red. Genes exhibiting
  a tumour suppressor like pattern of reduced expression as a result of frequent copy
  number loss in NSCLC are indicated in yellow. Genes added to the pathways for context
  but for which no expression differences were detected, are indicated in grey. Critical
  pathway nodes validated by real-time PCR are indicated with a *.
