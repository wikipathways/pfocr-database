caption: Molecular targeting of the ER plasma membrane, ER chaperones (e.g., GRP78),
  ER processing machinery, or client proteins by homocysteine may induce ER stress.
  ER stress results in the activation of the intracellular signaling pathway, called
  the unfolded protein response (UPR). Genes encoding ER chaperones and processing
  enzymes become transcriptionally upregulated. In eukaryotes, the UPR is regulated
  by the proximal sensors PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor
  6 (ATF6), and type-I ER transmembrane protein kinase (IRE1). Activation of these
  sensors leads to increased expression of ER-resident chaperones (GRP78) and the
  other UPR proteins. ER stress leads to a decrease in protein synthesis and translation
  through PERK. In late-stage ER stress, PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 upregulate CHOP (C/EBP
  homologous protein), promoting cell death (apoptosis). SREBP (sterol regulatory
  element–binding protein) upregulates lipid synthesis. Prolonged UPR leads to Ca2+
  release from the ER, causing production of ROS, which may lead to activation of
  NF-κB. Activation of these downstream pathways after ER stress can have direct effects
  on atherosclerotic lesion development and thrombogenicity.
