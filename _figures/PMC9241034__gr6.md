caption: Proposed model for the MMR-mediated response to oxidative stress. In the
  presence of oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoG, preloaded MutSα binds to a local 8-oxoG
  adduct. This frees the preoccupied H3K36me3 to recruit additional MutSα, which leads
  to increased levels of MutSα at damage sites. The 8-oxoG-bound MutSα interacts with
  SETD2, which in turn recruits ATM to activate the ATM signaling pathway. MutSα-recruited
  SETD2 trimethylates downstream H3K36, which increases the intensity of H3K36me3
  downstream TSSs. The latter can recruit more MutSα molecules to chromatin to respond
  to further DNA damage. Therefore, in response to oxidative stress, MutSα, SETD2,
  and H3K36me3 constitute a positive feedback loop to cope with oxidative DNA damage.
  MMR, mismatch repair; TSS, transcription start site.
