caption: The enzyme is sequestered in a trimeric state that renders it inactive, potentially
  due to spatial constraints imposed on the mobile lid and CoA domains. DCoA, upon
  binding, induces monomerization, releasing these constraints and inducing conformational
  changes in the enzyme, allowing the phosphate donor, ATP, to bind and catalysis
  to occur. CTP, on the other hand, prevents DCoA from binding the enzyme by virtue
  of occupying a similar binding site on the enzyme, thereby preventing the oligomeric
  re-equilibration, reflected in a mere 16% active CoaE in the presence of 1 mM CTP.
  Thus the mycobacterial cell employs regulation at the last enzyme of CoA biosynthesis
  via two co-acting mechanisms.
