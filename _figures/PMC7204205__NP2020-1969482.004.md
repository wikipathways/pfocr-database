caption: Summary of approaches to enhance TrkB activation and their effect on stroke
  treatment and recovery. Multiple strategies could be utilized to activate the TrkB
  receptor to serve in the treatment and recovery of stroke comorbidities. Direct
  approaches include the modification and improvement of BDNF for better delivery
  and the development of BDNF mimetic peptides, small molecule compounds, and specific
  agonistic antibodies. Indirect approaches include hormones, physical therapies,
  and natural compounds that can stimulate the endogenous expression of BDNF and gene/cell
  therapy to overexpress BDNF. TrkB receptor activation directly triggers and stimulates
  downstream signaling cascades, which subsequently protect neuronal cells and facilitate
  poststroke brain recovery. While the PLCγ pathway has been suggested to play a role
  in neuroplasticity and in cell death, the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways mainly
  protect neurons from excitotoxicity and cell death, chiefly apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt
  signaling is also reported to support neuronal survival under oxygen/nutrient deprivation
  and to contribute to neurogenesis during rehabilitation.
