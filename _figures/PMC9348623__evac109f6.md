caption: (A) Schematic diagram of a rod, and Grk1 phosphorylates rhodopsin in the
  rod out segments. Light activates Rho, and the chromophore changes from 11-cis-retinal
  to all-trans-retinal. Activated Rho (Rho*) binds Gt to hydrolyze cGMP to GMP, reducing
  the concentration of cGMP in rod cytoplasm and closing the cGMP gated channel. To
  terminate the phototransduction, Rho* is phosphorylated by Grk1 and the subsequent
  binding of Arr. (B) Schematic showing a cell responding to mechanical force. The
  actin cell skeleton is connected to the ECM and Vcl, and the focal adhesion is formed.
  The focal adhesion can regulate cellular shape and motility. Focal adhesion kinase
  is responsible for the binding of integrin-associated protein, such as paxillin
  and Scr. Scr can activate the expression of downstream genes through the PI3K signaling
  pathway. Rho, rhodopsin; Gt, transducing; Arr, arrestin; ECM, extracellular matrix.
