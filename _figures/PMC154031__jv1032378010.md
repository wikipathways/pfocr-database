caption: Schematic diagram of pathways activated by vGPCR that contribute to the activation
  of NF-AT. A model depicting the pathways activated by vGPCR that promote NF-AT activation
  is shown. GPCRs such as vGPCR activate calcium signaling through Gαq G proteins,
  which subsequently activate phospholipase C (PLC) and the downstream effectors diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP-3). Inositol triphosphate mobilizes intracellular
  calcium, which activates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin.
  Calcineurin activates NF-AT, which leads to its nuclear translocation. PI3-K is
  also activated by vGPCR, which results in the activation of Akt and the inactivation
  of GSK-3 by phosphorylation. Since activated GSK-3 normally promotes the nuclear
  export of NF-AT, inactivation of GSK-3 by vGPCR blocks the nuclear export NF-AT.
  GSK-3 also affects NF-AT activity at the level of activation of AP-1 (dimers of
  fos and jun), a transcription partner of NF-AT. c-jun activity is normally inactivated
  by GSK-3 via phosphorylation, which is blocked by activation of the PI3-K pathway.
  Thus, GSK-3 represents a point of divergence of disparate signals that lead to activation
  of NF-AT by vGPCR. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
