caption: 'Schematic diagram depicting sites of action of prominent drugs affecting
  principal pathways associated with breast cancer: (A) aromatase is the enzyme that
  catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. AIs inhibit the enzyme, therefore
  reducing the levels of estrogen which is needed for ER+ cancer cells growth. SERMs
  (ER antagonism) act as estrogen receptor antagonists in breast tissue. SERD (fulvestrant)
  is an ER antagonist leading to degradation and downregulation of ER. Zoledronate
  is a direct γδ T cell stimulator and also leads to accumulation of IPP in cancer
  cells leading to stimulation and activation of γδ T cell via γδ TCR recognition
  of phosphoantigens presented by butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) on the BC target cells
  and/or interaction of MICA with NKG2D. The immune response of γδ T cells can be
  via stimulatory and regulatory effects on other components of the immune system
  (secretion of cytokines or direct antigen presentation) and via direct cytotoxicity
  (through perforin-granzymes). Monoclonal antibodies: (B) PARP inhibitors lead to
  PARP inhibition and PARP trapping at sites of DNA damage. PARP acts as damage recognition
  repair protein for initiation of base excision repair of DNA SSB. PARP inhibition
  causes inability to repair and accumulation of SSB, leading to DSBs, which in cells
  with BRCA1/2 mutation cannot be fixed and accumulate ultimately triggering cell
  death. CDK4/6 inhibitors prevent DNA replication by arresting progression from the
  G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. mAbs inhibit activation of the signaling pathway
  of HER involved in promoting cell growth and opposing apoptosis. Pertuzumab inhibits
  HER2 dimerization; trastuzumab prevents cleavage of the extracellular domain of
  the HER2 receptor, which leads to the formation of a truncated form of HER2 (p95HER2).
  p95HER2, which contains tyrosine kinase activity, can form constitutively active
  stable homodimers. PI3K inhibitor (alpelisib) selectively inhibits the p110α catalytic
  subunit of PI3K interrupting both AKT-dependent and AKT-independent PI3K signaling
  pathways. HDAC inhibitors block the enzyme, resulting in hyperacetylation of histones,
  relaxation of the chromatin, and allowing for higher transcription of the DNA. Tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors: tucatinib, lapatinib, neratinib are homologous of the adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) that act by competing for the ATP-binding domain of protein kinases
  preventing phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the signal transduction
  pathways, leading to apoptosis and decreasing cellular proliferation. Moreover,
  TKIs target other kinase receptors due to the homology that they share with the
  EGFR family in the catalytic domain. (C) Anthracyclines: doxorubicin and epirubicin
  inhibit cancer through multiple pathways: to intercalate within DNA base pairs,
  causing breakage of DNA strands and inhibition of both DNA and RNA synthesis. Doxorubicin
  inhibits the enzyme topoisomerase II (TopII), causing DNA damage and induction of
  apoptosis—also cause ROS-mediated oxidative damage to DNA, further limiting DNA
  synthesis. Alkylating agents: cyclophosphamide (a nitrogen mustard compound), carboplatin
  and cisplatin (platinum-containing compounds) develop cytotoxic effects mainly due
  to substitution of alkyl groups for hydrogen atoms on DNA, resulting in the formation
  of cross-links within the DNA chain and thereby resulting in misreading of the DNA
  code and the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and the triggering apoptosis
  in rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Taxanes: paclitaxel and docetaxel stabilize
  microtubules act mainly by binding to beta-tubulin, enhancing its proliferation
  and stabilizing its conformation. Doing so inhibits the proper assembly of microtubules
  into the mitotic spindle, arresting the cell cycling during G2/M. conferring enhanced
  survival.AI indicates aromatase inhibitor; AKT, serine/threonine-protein kinase
