caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome and diseased skeletal muscle, case of Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy. This figure summarizes the central role of NLRP3 in dystrophic muscle
  inflammation, as well as several of its potential inhibitors. Briefly, the dystrophic
  muscle is characterized by absence of the dystrophin protein and its associated
  protein complex, which, in normal cells, links the intracellular cytoskeleton to
  the extracellular matrix, thus preserving the fiber membrane stability and permeability.
  Simple contraction of the dystrophic muscle causes microtears in the membrane and
  the subsequent release of intracellular DAMPS, which, in turn, can act in an autoparacrine
  manner to activate NLRP3 inflammasome in muscle fibers. Activated NLRP3 leads to
  an extreme release of inflammatory cytokines and DAMPS, thus maintaining and exaggerating
  the inflammatory response, eventually leading to pyroptosis and muscle degeneration.
  Rescuing the dystrophic phenotype can be achieved by alleviating muscle inflammation,
  in part through repression of NLRP3 inflammasome. This action can be accomplished
  by several factors. Firstly, adiponectin, a pleiotropic adipokine with potent anti-inflammatory
  effects, could strongly activate AMPK pathway that represses NLRP3 through reducing
  NF-κB activity and oxidative stress. Secondly, adiponectin, also through AMPK, increases
  the expression of its muscle anti-inflammatory mediator, miR-711, which can inhibit
  both the priming and activation of NLRP3. Thirdly, several drugs and molecules,
  such as AICAR, resveratrol and metformin, could repress NLRP3 through specific activation
  of the AMPK pathway. Fourthly, ghrelin, a gastric peptide with anti-inflammatory
  effect, could also put a brake on muscle inflammation through reduction in NLRP3
  activation. Fifthly, curcumin, a potent NF-kB inhibitor, could hinder NLRP3 and
  the production of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, MCC950, a specific NLRP3 inhibitor,
  could greatly attenuate the pathogenesis of the dystrophic phenotype, mainly by
  protecting the muscle from inflammation. Symbols in circles indicate: ‘P’, phosphorylation;
  ‘+’, activation; and ‘−’, inhibition.'
