caption: Growth factor mediated activation of AKT1. AKT1 is activated in response
  to growth factor mediated stimulation of the PI3K pathway. Activated AKT1 promotes
  an oncogenic cellular phenotype that exhibits inhibited autophagy and apoptosis
  pathways as well as activated cellular growth, proliferation and anabolic pathways.
  AKT1 targets many cellular proteins and the complete catalog of AKT1 substrates
  is unknown. The above examples show how AKT1 inhibits autophagy via the phosphorylation
  of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Through intermediates not shown, phosphorylated
  TSC can no longer maintain inhibition of mTORC1, so mTORC1 activity is simulated
  downstream of active AKT1 (Saxton and Sabatini, ). AKT1 also inhibits apoptosis
  and promotes cellular growth through phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of
  the tumor suppressors FOXO and GSK-3β (van der Vos and Coffer, ; Kaidanovich-Beilin
  and Woodgett, ).
