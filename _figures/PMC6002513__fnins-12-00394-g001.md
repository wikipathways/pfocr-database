caption: Auditory signal pathway and possible insults to the auditory nervous system
  caused by Alzheimer’s disease. The auditory nervous pathway originates from spiral
  ganglion cells in cochlea. Then, the axons of spiral ganglion cells project to the
  cochlear nucleus complex. Next, most of the axons from the cochlear nucleus complex
  cross the midline and ascend in the contralateral lateral lemniscus, terminating
  in the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body. Another part of axons project
  to the superior olivary nucleus and then terminate in the inferior colliculus and
  medial geniculate body. Finally, all ascending neurons form an auditory radiation
  and terminate in the auditory center of the transverse temporal gyrus. Every link
  in the auditory pathway may display pathological changes associated with AD, thus
  leading to hearing impairment.
