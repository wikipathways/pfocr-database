caption: Proposed model for the role of Fgfbp1 in BBB maturation. In WT brain ECs,
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces transcription of the Fgfbp1 gene. Fgfbp1 protein
  (purple crescent) is secreted in the BM, where it mobilizes Wnt ligands (pink hexagons)
  and facilitates their interaction with the Frizzled/LRP receptors near cell junctions,
  thus maintaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling and BBB properties (e.g. suppression of
  Plvap). In addition, Fgfbp1 promotes secretion and/or stabilization of collagen
  IV (green), but not laminin (orange) in the BM, thus stabilizing EC-pericyte (yellow)
  interactions. In the absence of Fgfbp1, Wnt ligands, that are either immobilized
  or sequestered by HSPGs (purple) in the BM interact less effectively with their
  cognate Frizzled/LRP receptors, leading to reduced β-catenin signaling in ECs, increased
  expression of Plvap and increased BBB permeability.
