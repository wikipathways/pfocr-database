caption: Potential mechanisms of MSC-Exos for promoting bone repair and regeneration.
  (A) Promoting osteogenic differentiation. MSC-Exos can activate the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway to promote osteogenic differentiation and proliferation of BMSCs. The Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway activated by MSC-Exos with increased expression of β-catenin and
  Wnt3a can promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Exosomes enriched
  with miR-375 inhibit the IGFBP3 expression to promote osteogenic differentiation
  of hBMSCs. (B) Promoting angiogenesis. BMSC-Exos activates the Akt/mTOR pathway
  to stimulate angiogenesis and further promotes bone regeneration. Exosomal miR-21
  can upregulate the NOTCH1/DLL4 pathway and promote angiogenesis. (C) Immunoregulation.
  MSC-Exos can decrease the gene expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS in the
  inflammatory macrophages. (D) Inducing chondrogenesis. MSC-Exos increase the protein
  and mRNA expression of collagen II and SOX9 to improve cartilage regeneration. MSC-Exos
  can promote the macrophage’s polarization toward the M2 phenotype and further inhibit
  the inflammatory response to benefit chondrogenesis. BMSC-Exo treatment can decrease
  the c-MYC expression level, which indicates the chondrocyte’s maturation. (E) Improving
  osteoporosis. MALAT1 contained in BMC-Exos promotes alkaline phosphatase activity
  of osteoblasts and mineralizes nodules by increasing SATB2 expression. Activating
  MAPK signaling and increasing the P-p38 and P-JNK expression by MSC-Exos can promote
  osteoblast differentiation. BMSC-Exos enriched with miR-196a can inhibit Dkk1 expression
  to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby improving osteoporosis. Exosomes
  derived from human umbilical cord MSCs can inhibit BMSC apoptosis through the miR-1263/Mob1/Hippo
  signaling pathway to improve osteoporosis.
