caption: 'TFs modulate the activity of transcription by binding to RNA polymerase
  and exerting its effects there. miRNAs silence the mRNA that is generated from transcription.
  The overall effect of using select TFs and/or miRNA in astrocytes is differentiation
  into a neuron. This differentiation can occur in two pathways: one is a direct pathway
  where the astrocyte is directly converted into a neuron, and the conversion can
  also occur in an indirect pathway through a pluripotent state that is further differentiated
  into a neuron.'
