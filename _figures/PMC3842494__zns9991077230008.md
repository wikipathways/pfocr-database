caption: Schematic of the proposed role of high CORT levels on the proinflammatory
  response triggered by LPS and related to MAP kinase–NF-κB pathway in rat brain.
  Normally, LPS binds to TLR4 and activates the MAP kinase pathway, thus activating
  NF-κB and increasing expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Basal levels of GCs
  inhibit this pathway through a number of steps, including (1) GR interacting with
  the p65 subunit of NF-κB, (2) increasing the expression of the inhibitory protein
  IκB-α, and (3) increasing expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as IL-1ra and
  MKP-1 (A). However, when GC exposure is elevated and prolonged, the hormone increases
  and potentiates the proinflammatory response related to MAP kinase–NF-κB pathway
  (B). Straight lines indicate activation and dotted lines indicate inhibition.
