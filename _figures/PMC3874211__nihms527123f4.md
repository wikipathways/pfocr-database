caption: Network pathway analysis integrated the majority of proteins identified as
  changed on 2DE (), as shown in  but did not include S-methyl-5`thioadenosine phosphorylase,
  and lamin B1 because of low scoring. Reticulocalbin 3 was not identified as a network
  component in the analysis, but is closely coupled to calcium signaling pathways
  [] in the network. The individual links between proteins are provided and referenced
  in .
