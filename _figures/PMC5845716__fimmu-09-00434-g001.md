caption: TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) in humoral responses. TBK1 functions downstream
  of TLR3/4-TRIF and DNA receptor cGAS-STING pathways leading to the activation of
  the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 and the production of interferons
  (IFN-Is). Chronic IFN-Is prime cytotoxic functions promote the survival of NK and
  CD8+ T cells, presumed to have pathogenic roles in autoimmunity, as well as the
  formation of extrafollicular plasmablasts. TBK1 is also implicated in the inducible
  T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) signaling pathway in T follicular B helper (TFH) cells
  to thymus-dependent (TD) antigens. TBK1 is recruited to and activated upon ICOS
  engagement to ICOS ligand, and promotes the maturation of pre-TFH to germinal center
  (GC) TFH cells. TBK1 targets downstream of ICOS signaling remain to be determined.
  TBK1-driven ICOS signaling is necessary for the generation of GC-derived memory
  B and plasma cells, and TD antibody responses. Finally, TBK1 can promote autophagy
  through the phosphorylation of autophagy receptors proteins (optineurin, p62, or
  NDP52), which sequester ubiquitinated cargo (damaged or redundant organelles). Mitophagy
  in memory B cells and reticulophagy in plasma cells are required for their longevity
  in vivo. TBK1 involvement in these processes remains to be determined.
