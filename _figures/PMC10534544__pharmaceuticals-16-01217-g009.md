caption: Graphic summary of the main results obtained in the present study of the
  effects of compound 5−((4 methoxyphenyl)thio)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiodiazole (MTDZ)
  in acute nociception and neuropathic pain. In paclitaxel (PTX) − induced peripheral
  neuropathy, MTDZ relieves mechanical and thermal sensitivities by reducing levels
  of nitrites and nitrates (including nitric oxide radical (NO•) and peroxynitrite
  (ONOO•)) that are elevated due to PTX administration (left side of image). Furthermore,
  MTDZ restores the activity of the Ca2+−ATPase enzyme, maintaining its homeostasis
  in males exposed to PTX. In acute nociception, MTDZ modulates acetic acid−induced
  nociceptive responses through regulatory actions on the N−Methyl−D−Aspartate (NMDA)/nitric
  oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, the V subfamily of transient
  receptor potential cation channel limb 1 (TRPV1), the 5HT1A/1B receptors, as well
  as the µ and κ opioid receptors (right side of image).
