caption: Effects of methylation on circRNA biogenesis, transport, stability, translation
  and degradation. (A) METTL3 or YTHDC1 affect circRNA generation by regulating m6A
  modification. (B) m6A modification regulates circNSUN2 export to the cytoplasm.
  (C) m6A modification improves circRNA-SORE stability. (D) YTHDF3 and eIF4G2 physically
  interact with endogenous circ-ZNF609 and can affect circ-ZNF609 translation levels.
  (E) m6A modification is involved in circRNA degradation via the YTHDF2/HRSP12/RNase
  P/MRP complex signaling pathway. Gray arrows represent downregulation. circRNA,
  circular RNA; METTL3, methyltransferase-like 3; YTHDC, YTH domain containing; m6A,
  N6-methyladenosine; NSUN2, NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2; YTHDF, YTH domain-containing
  family protein; eIF4G2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-γ2; ZNF609, zinc
  finger protein 609; HRSP12, heat-responsive protein 12; MRP, mitochondrial RNA processing
  enzyme; miRNA, microRNA; FTO, fat mass and obesity-associated protein.
