caption: Insulin activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase which subsequently
  tyrosine phosphorylates IRS1 and 2. Through a set of intermediary steps, this leads
  to activation of Akt2. Akt2 can promote glycogen synthesis (not shown), suppress
  gluconeogenesis and activate de novo lipogenesis (DNL). This central signaling pathway
  is connected to multiple other cellular pathways that are designated by numbers
  1–3. 1) The green shaded areas represent mechanisms for lipid induced insulin resistance,
  notably diacylglycerol mediated activation of PKCε and subsequent impairment of
  insulin signaling, as well as ceramide mediated increases in PP2A and increased
  sequestration of Akt2 by PKCζ. Impaired Akt2 activation limits the inactivation
  of FOXO1 and allows for increased expression of key gluconeogenesis enzymes. Impaired
  Akt2 activity also decreases insulin mediated glycogen synthesis (not depicted).
  2) The yellow areas depict several intracellular inflammatory pathways, notably
  the activation of IKK, which may impact ceramide synthesis and the activation of
  JNK1, which may impair lipogenesis. 3) The pink area depicts that activation of
  the UPR that can lead to increased lipogenesis, via XBP1s and also increased gluconeogenesis
  via C/EBP. The ER membranes also contain key lipogenic enzymes and give rise to
  lipid droplets. Proteins that regulate the release from these droplets (e.g. ATGL
  and PNPLA3) may modulate the concentration of key lipid intermediates in discrete
  cell compartments.
