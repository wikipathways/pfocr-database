caption: The schematic diagram illustrates that the increase in NO content during
  the differentiation of MSCs into HLCs is due to the high expression of iNOS and
  that NO causes S‐nitrosative modification of the extracellular domain of NECD, which
  leads to the reduction in the expression level of NOTCH1, thereby inhibiting the
  Notch signalling pathway. Inhibition of the Notch signalling pathway promotes the
  process of hepatogenic differentiation. During the whole differentiation process,
  due to the presence of NO, SNO‐NOTCH1 and NOTCH1 are like in a Yin and Yang relationship,
  but closely linked
