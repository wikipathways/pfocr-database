caption: The interferon-gamma (IFNG) pathway and its modeled representation to demonstrate
  the step-by-step calculations for protein-protein interactions at each node in this
  pathway and as an annexure section of other pathways. The network was predictive
  and biomarker outputs were read as percent change in expression with respect to
  the control network. (A) In the IFNG pathway IFNγ binds with IFNGR1 (e.g., IFNGR
  alpha chain). IFNGR beta chain is IFNGR2. Downstream signaling requires Janus-activated
  kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2 which mediate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
  1 (STAT-1) activation, thereby transcribing pro-inflammatory markers and immune-checkpoint
  markers. (B) We included PMID references that support each step throughout the pathway.
  In the modeled representation of the IFNG pathway, ligand IFNG binds to receptor
  represented by Simple Michalis Menten Equation (SMM) where the IFNG acts as an inducer
  for receptor activation (1). FYN activated by ligand (3) bound activated receptor
  complex (IFNGR + JAK complex), represented by SMM. PIK3CA activation by GAB2 and
  IRS2 (4), where flux would be driven by more than one activator, therefore each
  activator is represented by SMM and the final flux would be the summation of individual
  reactions. CHUK and IKBKB mediated NFKB phosphorylation (5) is represented by SMM,
  where CHUK-IKBKB complex phosphorylates cytosolic NFKB and trans-locates to nucleus
  for gene transcription. IFNGR1 binding to JAK1 (2) is represented as irreversible
  mass action equation and STAT1 dimerization (6) is represented by irreversible mass
  action equation.
