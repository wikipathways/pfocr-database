caption: A simplified model for the cuticular wax biosynthesis and its roles in regulating
  plant–pathogen interactions. The biosynthesis of the cuticular wax mixture starts
  from the elongation of C16 or C18 fatty acid-coenzyme A (CoA) by fatty acid elongase
  (FAE) complex and ECERIFERUM2 (CER2) proteins. The elongated very-long-chain (VLC)
  acyl-CoAs are then modified into aldehydes, alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones
  by an alkane-forming pathway (shown in blue) or into primary alcohols and wax esters
  by an alcohol-forming pathway (shown in pink). Names shown in red denote proteins
  involved in the regulation of plant-pathogen interactions. For steps involving multiple
  paralogs, only the gene subfamily name is given in black. Circle, square, and triangle
  denote plant-bacterial pathogen interaction, plant-fungal pathogen interaction,
  and plant–insect interaction, respectively. Positive and negative regulations of
  plant–pathogen interaction are individually shown in green and red colors, respectively.
  The model for the cuticular wax biosynthesis was built on Yeast and Rose. 2013,
  and Lewandowska et al., 2020 [,].
