caption: Low-density LRP1-mediated cell signaling pathways. LRP1 regulates several
  signaling pathways in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These pathways are involved
  in several processes of tumorigenesis and progression. Binding of LRP1 to platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF) receptor activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling pathway, which subsequently activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathway and inhibits c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), resulting in cancer
  cell invasion and proliferation. In addition, ERK increases the transcriptional
  levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, which drive cancer cell invasion.
  LRP1 activates the serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway and insulin
  receptor (IR), which inhibits cancer cell apoptosis. LRP1 binds to the novel extracellular
  heat shock protein 90 (eHsp90) and forms an eHsp90-LRP1 signaling complex, which
  stimulates glioblastoma multiforme cell motility and invasion via AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation at S897 (p-EphA2S897). The eHsp90 signaling regulates AKT activation
  and facilitates recruitment of LRP1 to the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2
