caption: 'Antiviral innate immune pathways in dipteran insects. Toll pathway: Detection
  of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen recognition-receptors
  leads to the proteolytic maturation of Spätzle, which binds to and activates Toll
  (dotted arrows). Activated Toll recruits adapter proteins MyD88, Tube and Pelle
  which targets Cactus for proteasomal degradation via phosphorylation. Cactus degradation
  releases the transcription factor Dorsal (Rel1 in mosquitoes) or Dif (Dorsal-related
  immune factor) when activated in response to bacterial infection. These translocate
  to the nucleus and activates the transcription of Toll pathway-regulated genes (e.g.,
  cecropin, defensin and drosomycin). IMD pathway: Gram-negative PAMPs (e.g., peptidoglycan)
  bind to peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP-LC (or PGRP-LE) and signal through
  the adapter molecules IMD (Immune Deficiency) and dFADD (Drosophila Fas-associated
  death domain). This stimulates the caspase Dredd (Death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like
  protein), dTAK1 (Drosophila transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1), and
  dTAK1 adapter protein dTAB2 (TAK1-binding protein 2). These proteins signal through
  the JNK pathway, and activate the IκB kinases kenny and ird-5, which phosphorylate
  the C-terminal tail of the transcription factor Relish (Rel2 in mosquitoes), leading
  to its subsequent activation via proteolytic cleavage by Dredd. Activated Relish
  translocates to the nucleus and drives the expression of genes regulated by the
  IMD-pathway (e.g., diptericin, attacin and metchnikowin). JAK-STAT pathway: Virus
  infection, possibly through induction of stress or cellular damage, triggers the
  activation of the JAK (Janus kinase)-STAT (signal transducers and activators of
  transcription) pathway, which begins with the binding of a cytokine of the unpaired
  (upd) family to the dimeric receptor, domeless. Subsequently, the receptor-associated
  JAK-tyrosine kinase hopscotch phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of domeless, leading
  to the recruitment of Stat92E. After Jak-mediated phosphorylation, Stat92E proteins
  dimerize and shuttle to the nucleus to activate the transcription of genes such
  as vir-1, TotM, DVRF1 and DVRF2. RNAi pathway: Double-stranded RNA derived from
  virus replication intermediates are recognized and processed by Dicer-2 into 21
  nt small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then loaded onto an Argonaute-2 (Ago2)-containing
  RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). This complex degrades one of the two strands
  and uses the other strand as a guide RNA to target complementary viral sequences.
  Dicer-2 can also activate the expression of the cytokine Vago through an unknown
  pathway (visualized as ‘?’ in the figure). RNA decay pathways: Single-stranded viral
  mRNA can be targeted in the 3′–5′ direction through the RNA exosome degradation
  pathway. 5′–3′ degradation occurs through decapping enzymes Dcp1 and Dcp2 and the
  RNA exonuclease Xrn1. Autophagy: Some viruses can bind to the transmembrane receptor
  Toll-7, resulting in the induction of autophagy. This is most likely in an indirect
  manner by negatively regulating the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-Akt pathway.'
