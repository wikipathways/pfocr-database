caption: Formaldehyde oxidation pathways used in this study. The “Native” pathway
  for formaldehyde oxidation normally found in Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 is the
  dH4MPT-dependent branch displayed. Alternatively, genes encoding the “Foreign” degenerate
  GSH-dependent pathway from Paracoccus denitrificans were cloned onto plasmid pCM410
  and moved into M. extorquens. “Dual” pathway strains have degeneracy, as they possess
  both of these unrelated pathways. The alternative pathways conjugate the formaldehyde
  intermediate to dH4MPT or GSH cofactors, respectively, and oxidize the single carbon
  through a series of reactions to formate. Formate represents the important metabolic
  branchpoint between respiration and incorporation into biomass. The Foreign pathway
  utilizes only the NAD+ cofactor, whereas the Native pathway can either NAD+ or NADP+.
  Methanol, formaldehyde, and formate are colored with brown, red, and dark green
  text, respectively, for emphasis. Mutations impacting the products of fghA/flhA,
  gshA, and pntAB genes are similarly emphasized with colored text.
