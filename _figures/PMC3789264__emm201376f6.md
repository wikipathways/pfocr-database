caption: The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)-generated network of isobaric tag for
  relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-identified proteins and their interacting
  partners in Alzheimer's disease (AD) parietal cortex (pCx). The IPA construct networks
  based on the differentially regulated proteins and their potential link with other
  known proteins in human AD pCx. Solid and dashed connecting lines indicate the presence
  of direct and indirect interactions, respectively. Modulatory roles of proteins
  on the expression of other proteins are indicated by arrows.
