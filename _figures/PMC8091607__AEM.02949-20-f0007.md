  R3. The regulation of prodiginine biosynthesis by SspA is indirect and mediated
  by the siderophore-dependent iron uptake pathway. SspA positively regulates the
  transcription of the siderophore biosynthetic gene (pvd) cluster through an unknown
  mechanism. In the absence of SspA, the production of siderophore is inhibited, resulting
  in iron deficiency and making the strain incapable of prodiginine biosynthesis.
  The iron homeostasis master regulator Fur is also essential for pig transcription
  and prodiginine biosynthesis. It is likely that Fur senses and interacts with Fe2+
  to form Fur-Fe2+ complexes, which bind to the promoter region of pigA, thus activating
  the transcription of the pig cluster. For clarity, the production, secretion, and
  uptake of siderophores are simplified in the model.
