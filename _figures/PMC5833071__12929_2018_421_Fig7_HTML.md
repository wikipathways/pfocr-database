caption: Graphic brief shows that how signal pathway of CXCL12 stimulates expression
  of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in human lung fibroblasts. It was previously
  revealed that the Rac1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent activator
  protein (AP)-1 pathway participated in CXCL12-caused expression of CTGF in WI-38
  cells. In this report, CXCL12 also activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) signaling pathway, which turned on c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and SMAD3 activation and finally caused expression of CTGF in human lung fibroblasts
  (WI-38)
