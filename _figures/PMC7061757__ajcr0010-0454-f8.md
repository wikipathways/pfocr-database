caption: The crosstalk between EGRF inhibition and TLR4 pathways in HNSCC. The increased
  TLR4 signaling resulted from decreased Cbl-b-mediated degradation of key adaptor
  protein MyD88, and EGFR inhibition led to decreased activation of Src and sequentially
  Src-medicated phosphorylation of MyD88. TLR4 activation induced activation of NF-κB
  and MAPK signal pathway, which further induced the release of proinflammatory cytokines
  and anti-apoptosis protein feedback led to the resistance to EGFR inhibition.
