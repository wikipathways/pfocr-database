caption: 'Latency reversing agents induce HIV‐1 provirus replication by diverse mechanisms.
  Small molecule compounds identified as LRAs cause reactivation of HIV‐1 transcription/replication
  through at least four distinct mechanisms, organized into Groups (Table ), including:
  epigenetic modifiers (boxed in blue); chromatin modulators (purple); signaling effectors/modulators
  (orange); and RNA Pol II transcriptional elongation modulators (green). Epigenetic
  modifiers (blue), include HDAC and BET inhibitors that enhance viral transcription
  by modulating posttranslational modifications of core histone N‐terminal tails.
  Chromatin modulators (purple), include BAF inhibitors that regulate nucleosome positioning
  on the HIV‐1 5′ LTR (Nuc 0/1) and specifically disrupt Nuc 1 to allow activated
  transcription by RNA Polymerase II. Signaling effectors/modulators (orange) affect
  PI3K‐Akt, PKC‐NFκB, and Jak‐STAT5 pathways. Agonists activating PKC stimulate the
  transcription factor NFκB through activation of IKK and degradation of the inhibitor
  of NFκB (IκB). Signaling modulator 5HN also induces HIV‐1 expression through ROS‐stimulated
  IKK, and consequently NFκB activation. PI3K agonists directly activate PI3K, while
  disulfiram induces activation through this pathway by inhibiting the negative regulator
  PTEN, which also regulates IKK through the function of Akt. The JAK‐STAT pathway
  stimulates HIV expression through STAT5; benzotriazoles indirectly activate this
  effect by impairing STAT5 SUMOylation causing its retention in the nucleus. Signaling
  effector AV6 stimulates viral transcription by enhancing NFAT activity. Transcriptional
  elongation modulators (green) include SMAPP1, which enhances viral gene expression
  by activating Cdk9 of pTEFb, while aclacinomycin causes the dissociation of pTEFb
  from the inhibitory 7S snRNP complex. 5HN, 5‐hydroxynaphthalene‐1,4‐dion; AV6, antiviral
