caption: 'A comparison of classical lysosomal Ca2+signaling with Ca2+ release from
  cytolytic granules. Simplistic cartoons of Ca2+ and H+ homeostasis in acidic organelles:
  the V-H+-APase pumps H+ into and acidifies the organelle lumen. Ca2+ is imported
  into the lumen by exploiting the energy of the H+ gradient in some version of Ca2+/H+
  exchange (CHX). Ca2+ is released through Ca2+-permeable TPCs gated by NAADP. (A)
  Lysosomes are important acidic Ca2+ stores contributing to distal downstream global
  Ca2+ responses, such as muscle contraction and cell differentiation. (B) Cytolytic
  granules are essentially the lysosomes of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, but with the
  additional function of being ‘secretory lysosomes’: Granzyme B (GrB) and Perforin
  are exocytosed in response to Ca2+ release by NAADP in an ‘autocrine’ fashion ().'
