caption: Astrocytic and microglial Ca2+ as a therapeutic target in AD. Schematic of
  glial Ca2+ cells dysregulation in the presence of AD pathology. In astrocytes, P2Y
  purinoceptors and glutamate metabotropic receptors mGluR5, when activated, cause
  Ca2+ increase by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. As shown in red, all
  three receptors are upregulated in AD. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ levels are increased
  in astrocytes, and they exhibit Ca2+ transients (A). In microglia, P2X receptors
  are upregulated in AD, thus leading to Ca2+ dysregulation. SOCE, with involves STIM
  and Orai, is also responsible for Ca2+ influx, specifically into the lumen of the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is downregulated in AD (shown in blue).
  RyRs mediate Ca2+ efflux from the ER, a process that is upregulated in AD. Microglia
  also show Ca2+ dysregulation by showing cytosolic Ca2+ transients (B).
