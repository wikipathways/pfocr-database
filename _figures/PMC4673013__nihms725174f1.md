caption: miRNA targeting of insulin signaling occurs centrally at the beta cell and
  peripherally in target tissues. Several miRNAs, such as the miR-141/200c family
  and the DLK1-MEG3 cluster, directly regulate cellular response to stress and are
  active in facilitating (miR-141/200c) or disrupting (DLK1-MEG3 cluster) beta cell
  apoptosis in response to metabolic stress. miR-375 is important for beta cell proliferation
  and maintenance of beta cell mass while miR-7 regulates innsulin granule release
  by inhibiting the SNARE complex. Peripherally, miRNAs are capable of disrupting
  insulin signaling at almost every point along its axis. miR-103/107 disrupt caveolae
  formation, impacting insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor expression
  at the membrane. The let-7 miRNA family directly targets high-level insulin signaling
  by reducing insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression.
  Hnf1b, a transcription factor important for maintaining insulin signaling, is targeted
  by miR-802. Finally, miR-143 inhibits insulin activity by targeting effector genes
  downstream of AKT such as ORP8.
