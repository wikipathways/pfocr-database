caption: Interactions between miRNAs (triangles) and mRNAs (boxes), which have a Jaccard-index
  ≥0.4 that exhibit a negative correlation, i.e. ρ≤−0.4, between the normalized miRNA
  and mRNA expression values for at least one experimental group, are shown (blue
  edges). The black edges indicated the general signal cascade. Mean expression status
  of the analysed miRNA mRNAs interactions were indicated (red indicates up regulation
  and green down regulation).
