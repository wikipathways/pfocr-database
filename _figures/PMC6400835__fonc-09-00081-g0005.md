caption: Effects of EBV latent and lytic proteins on inhibition of apoptosis. EBNA-1
  interacts with the HAUSP to destabilize and degrade p53. EBNA-2 antagonizes TGF-β-mediated
  growth arrest in LCLs. LMP-1 upregulates Bcl-2 and promotes the growth of BL through
  the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway. EBNA-3A upregulates Hsp70 chaperones
  to suppress the apoptosis in exposure to cytotoxic agents. EBNA-3C can suppress
  p53-dependent apoptosis through repressing the transcription of p53 and promoting
  its degradation. EBNA-3C also hinders the E2F1-mediated apoptosis induced by DNA
  damage response through inhibiting the DNA binding activity of E2F1 and promoting
  its proteolysis. EBNA-3C also interacts with Bcl-6 and releases the Bcl-2 to suppress
  apoptosis. EBNA-3A and -3C can co-operate to repress the expression of p16INK4a
  and Bim to promote cell proliferation. Zta can induce the expression of vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the growth of LCL.
