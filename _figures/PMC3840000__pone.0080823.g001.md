caption: 'The combined pathways begin with the essential amino acid L-phenylalanine,
  which is converted to L-tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase. L-tyrosine is then
  converted to L-DOPA either in the catechoamine synthesis pathway (above) or the
  melanin synthesis pathway (below). The melanin synthesis pathway begins after transport
  of L-tyrosine into the melanosome (gray sphere) and involves several enzymes (blue
  boxes) and other gene products (orange boxes) coding for putative transporter proteins
  essential for melanin synthesis. In albino cavefish, a mutated oca2 gene (white
  box with XXX) affects the first step of the pathway prior to tyrosinase function
  and prevents melanin synthesis. The defect caused by oca2 loss of function can be
  rescued by exogenous L-DOPA (green box) []. Solid lines: steps that occur in surface
  fish and in cavefish after L-DOPA rescue of melanogenesis. Dashed lines: steps that
  are absent in cavefish.'
