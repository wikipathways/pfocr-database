caption: Mammary gland epithelial cells form polarized acinar structures when cultured
  in 3D matrigel. Treatment with prolactin can activate JAK2-STAT5 pathway. Without
  laminin-111, STAT5 only shows a transient phosphorylation, which is not suffcient
  for chromatin remodeling and milk gene expression. After laminin-111 binds integrins
  and dystroglycan, PI3K re-localize to the basal surface. Rac1 is a downsteam target
  of PI3K and required for sustained activation of STAT5. Prolactin, together with
  laminin-111, induces histone acetylation, binding of the SWI/SNF and transcription
  factors to the promoter and initiates transcription of casein.
