caption: The image depicts a signaling pathway where neurotransmitters bind to membrane
  receptors, activating G-proteins and effector proteins to produce second messengers
  like Ca2⁺ and cAMP. These messengers activate protein kinases, leading to protein
  phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors (e.g., CREB, JunD) in the
  nucleus. This triggers the transcription of immediate early genes, resulting in
  RNA synthesis and changes in gene expression. Voltage-gated ion channels also play
  a role in cellular response
