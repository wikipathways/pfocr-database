caption: Intracellular signaling of MET and other RTKs occurs via the PI3K or ERK1/2                   pathways.
  Rare mutations and CNVs (which are both designated by ‡) or                   associated
  common alleles (which are designated by *) have been identified in                   individuals
  with ASD in seven genes encoding proteins involved in these signaling                   pathways.
  Of note, an association between common MET variants and ASD has been                   reported
  for five independent family cohorts. PLAUR and SERPINE1 associations with                   ASD
  have been determined in single, large family cohorts (>600 families).                   Ras
  disruption in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is due to alterations in cholesterol                   biosynthesis
  (which is designated by †). Also depicted are other                   proteins that
  interact with the MET signaling pathway, such as semaphorins,                   plexins,
  and other RTKs. MET can signal via the PI3K and the ERK pathway. RTKs,                   including
  MET, are involved in key neurodevelopmental processes, including axon                   guidance,
  synapse formation, and plasticity. Convergence of many different genetic                   etiologies
  suggests that risk via ERK/PI3K signaling may be common in ASD. Risk,                   severity
  of the pathophysiology (i.e., intellectual disability), and disorder                   heterogeneity
  may relate to differences in genetic and epigenetic points of entry                   to
  the pathways. Thus, the impact due to genetic risk, via regulators of ligand                   availability
  or RTKs such as MET, may be less severe than the more severe clinical                   impact
  (i.e., intellectual disability) from disruption downstream along the                   intracellular
  signaling pathways. c-cbl, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase c-Cbl; rheb,                   Ras
  homolog enriched in brain; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase; uPA, urokinase                   plasminogen
  activator.
