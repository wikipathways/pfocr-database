caption: The dynamic mechanism of ADP-ribosylation reversal. ARTDs consume NAD+ and
  transfer ADP-ribose moieties onto target substrates (blue boxes) on different amino
  acids side chains (green [X]). These proteins can have a variety of different ADP-ribosylation
  modification patterns, as described in Fig. . In the context of severe genotoxic
  insult, complex PAR polymers composed of large and branched molecules are synthesized
  by ARTD1 and ARTD2 (PARP-1 and PARP-2). These polymers are rapidly recognized and
  processed by a variety of erasers in a biphasic mode. At the same time, a variety
  of PAR readers can bind PAR and regulate the kinetics of the erasing process. In
  the first phase of the ADP-ribosylation reversal, PARG activity predominates and
  presumably exceeds ARH3 activity since PARG possesses high affinity for complex
  polymers and a very rapid and processive exoglycosidic activity toward ribose-ribose
  linkages. The dePARylation process is enhanced by the unique ability of PARG to
  cleave in-chain ribose-ribose linkages and branching points owing to its endoglycosidic
  activity. In addition, TARG1 can contribute to protein dePARylation by detaching
  entire PAR chains through cleavage of the proximal protein−ribose linkage. As PAR
  polymers are rapidly shortened by the combined endo- and exoglycosidic activities
  of PARG, the dePARylation activity drops and partially trimmed apoptogenic ADP-ribose
  oligomers accumulate. These small PAR fragments induce a second erasing wave in
  which rate and processivity of PARG is markedly decreased while ARH3 activity becomes
  dominant. The residual PARG activity and ARH3-catalyzed PAR hydrolysis generate
  MARylated proteins, which are further degraded by amino acid-specific MAR hydrolases
  and NUDIX phosphodiesterases. These waves of ADP-ribosylation erasing generate unmodified,
  phosphoribosylated, and MARylated proteins as well as free ADP-ribose. The latter
  might be deleterious for the cells and thus recycled by NUDT5 to quickly replenish
  ATP levels or converted to AMP which activates the AMP kinase (AMPK) and the mTOR
  signalling pathway
