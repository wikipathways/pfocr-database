caption: During a primary immune response, naïve CD4 T cells (Na) are recruited from
  the blood into the tissue, where they interaction with dendritic cells (DC). If
  activated via their T cell receptor in conjugation with the appropriate co-stimulation,
  naïve CD4 T cells upregulate CXCR5 and move into the B cell follicle. These precursor
  TFH cells (pTFH ) interact with local B cells to undergo full maturation into bona
  fide TFH cells, which again interact with B cells within germinal centers. This
  germinal center interaction induces the production of high affinity antibodies as
  well as the release of activated memory TFH cells (*TFH ) from the tissue back into
  the blood. Memory TFH cells in the blood can also be re-recruited into the follicle
  upon secondary exposure (i.e. memory recall) to rapidly promote the production of
  antibodies. TFH responses can be inhibited by T follicular regulatory cells (TFR)
  within follicles. During aging, multiple changes in this pathway occur, including
  alterations of naïve CD4 and TFH cell frequencies within the blood, reductions in
  TFH -B cell interactions and increases in TFR cells - which in turn lead to lower
  production of antigen-specific antibodies and activated TFH cells.
