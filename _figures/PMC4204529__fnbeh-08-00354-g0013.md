caption: Molecular model of a Paired and Untrained Type B cell given repeated light
  steps. (A) A cartoon illustration of a single Type B photoreceptor with expanded
  view of the rhabdomere and soma subcellular regions. Note the three classes of voltage-dependent
  ion channels (sodium, potassium, and calcium) located in the axon hillock region
  (indicated by the dotted line). (B) Expanded view of a Type B cell 1–2 h after paired
  training. During light steps (LSs) 1–2 (left), many (~30–50%) of the somatic somatic
  IA K+ channels are shut (indicated by an X in the channel pore) due to PKC-mediated
  phosphorylation of the channel itself or channel-associated proteins (P indicates
  a phosphate group). Paired conditioning also mobilizes inhibitor-1/PP1 complexes
  and PP2B to K+ channel signaling complexes, where both inactive phosphatases are
  localized via anchoring proteins such as yotiao/AKAP. Paired conditioning also activates
  AA, which facilitates the phosphorylation of K+ channel signaling complexes. The
  light-induced phototransduction cascade involving rhodopsin and a still unidentified
  G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), results in the production of inositol trisphosphate
  (IP3). Liberated IP3 subsequently activates IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) and releases Ca2+
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol. Paired conditioning leads
  to larger than normal light-induced Ca2+ release from the ER, and each successive
  LS (i.e., LSs 16–30) (right) releases a large amount of Ca2+ that favors the activation
  of PP2B. Activated PP2B disinhibits PP1 (through the dephosphorylation of inhibitor-1,
  I-1), which is now able to dephosphorylate K+ channels (or associated proteins),
  increase the activity of IA channels, and reduce B cell spike frequency. The spike
  frequency reducing effects of PP2B and PP1 during the later LSs can be blocked by
  the inhibitors cyclosporin and calyculin, respectively (indicated by red dashed
  lines). Concurrent to the phosphatase-signaling pathway, repeated LSs also initiate
  12-LOX activity, which metabolizes AA into 12(S)-HPETE. 12(S)-HPETE increases the
  activity of IA K+ channels, and possibly enhances the influx of Ca2+ via transient
  receptor potential-like (TRP-L) channels. Both of these processes further reduce
  B cell excitability during LSs 16–30. This reduced excitability might be further
  potentiated by greater activation of IK-Ca via large Ca2+ release from the ER. (C)
  Expanded view of an Untrained Type B cell during LSs 1–2 (left) and LSs 16–30 (right)
  injected with either catalytically active PP1 (caPP1) or PP2B (caPP2B). During the
  first two LSs, a certain fraction of somatic K+ channels are phosphorylated via
  constitutively active PKC or other kinase(s), but most channels are not phosphorylated,
  resulting in the basal level of B cell excitability (i.e., lower than in Paired
  cells). Injection of caPP1 into Untrained B cells leads to the dephosphorylation
  of a certain fraction of phosphorylated K+ channel signaling complexes (or associated
  proteins), enhancing K+ channel activity, which reduces B cell excitability below
  baseline levels during LSs 16–30. Similarly, injection of caPP2B disinhibits endogenous
  PP1, which eventually localizes to K+ channel signaling complexes (via yotiao) and
  increases the activity of IA K+ channels, and reduces B cell spike frequency. Dotted
  arrows indicate direction of action, while solid arrows show ionic movement across
  a membrane through various ion channels.
