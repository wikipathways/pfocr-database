caption: 'Cellular localization of different NOS/NO signaling pathway components in
  the testes. Schematic drawing depicting the gross morphology of a testis cross-section.
  Seminiferous tubules are prominent structures found in the testes. Area surrounding
  the seminiferous tubules is termed interstitial area, which harbors Leydig cells
  and blood vessels. The inset diagram illustrates different germ cell layers of a
  seminiferous tubule. During spermatogenesis, spermatogonium migrates from the basal
  compartment to the adluminal compartment, during which spermatogonium differentiates
  into advanced germ cell types, namely preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes, pachytene
  spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids, before spermatozoa are
  released into the tubule lumen. Components of the NOS/NO pathway, such as CNG1,
  eNOS, iNOS, nNOS, PKG, sGC, and TnNOS, are represented by the symbols tabulated.
  They are localized in specific locations within the testes, such as in the Sertoli
  cell and germ cell layers (SC & GC layers), sperm, Leydig cells (LC), and blood
  vessel (BV). Abbreviations used: BV, blood vessel; CNG1, cyclic nucleotide-gated
  channel 1; eNOS, endothelial NOS; ES, elongated spermatid; GC, germ cell; iNOS,
  inducible NOS; LC, Leydig cells; N, Sertoli cell nucleus; nNOS, neuronal NOS; PKG,
  protein kinase G; PS, pachytene spermatocyte; RS, round spermatid; N, Sertoli cell
  nucleus; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; SC, Sertoli cells; SPC, preleptotene/leptotene
  spermatocyte; SPG, spermatogonium; TnNOS, testis-specific nNOS.'
