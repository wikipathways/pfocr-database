caption: Illustration of the roles of the Hippo pathway in ER + breast cancer. Overexpression
  of ZNF367 facilitates metastasis and activates Hippo/YAP signaling by inhibiting
  LATS []. Overexpression of USP9X stimulates cell proliferation by deubiquitinating
  and stabilizing YAP1 []. NE and EPI suppress breast cancer via rapid phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic retention of YAP []. ZEB1, a transcriptional activator, interacts
  with YAP1 and promotes transcription []. The interaction of LATS1 and CRABP2 inhibits
  the ubiquitination of LATS1 to suppress cell invasion []. The STARD13-correlated
  ceRNA network regulates TAZ distribution, and it can inhibit the stem cell character
  of breast cancer through upregulation of LATS1/2 []
