caption: Host-adapted bacteria (such as OpaCEA-expressing N. gonorrhoeae) can intimately
  bind to the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells, e.g., by engaging members
  of the human CEACAM family. Under low oxygen conditions, CEACAM-associated gonococci
  produce nitric oxide (NO) due to nitrite respiration in an anaerobic environment
  as found in the genital tract. The gaseous radical NO penetrates membranes and can
  reach the neighboring host cell cytoplasm within a micrometer distance. There, nanomolar
  concentrations of NO initiate a conserved eukaryotic signaling pathway involving
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), protein kinase G, and the transcription factor
  CREB to upregulate CD105 expression. De novo expression of CD105, by extracting
  the adapter molecule zyxin from focal adhesions, leads to increased integrin activity,
  thereby enforcing the attachment of the infected cell to the extracellular matrix.
  As a consequence, exfoliation is suppressed (left side) facilitating the colonization
  of the mucosa. Other CEACAM-binding microbes, such as certain uropathogenic E. coli,
  might also be able to trigger this process (middle). In contrast, microbes, which
  are not able to trigger this process, stimulate epithelial exfoliation and tissue
  renewal (right side).
