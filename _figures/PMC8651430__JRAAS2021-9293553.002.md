caption: 'Function of angiotensin receptors in central nervous system-related disorders.
  Overview of brain RAS demonstrating the formation of its component in periphery
  and in the CNS. The diagram represents the specific converting enzymes involved
  for the conversion AGT to Ang IV, their receptors, and their role in various CNS
  disorders and protection. The RAS pathway initiates by conversion of angiotensinogen
  from the liver to Ang I in the lungs by sequential action of enzymes and prorenin-renin
  which also acts on a specific prorenin receptor. Ang I in the presence of ACE is
  further converted to Ang II, which gets fragmented into biological active form Ang
  III and IV which further acts on AT1, AT2, AT4, and MasR. The AT1 activation results
  in stress, neuroinflammation, and stroke. This effect is counteracted by the Ang
  II/AT2R and Ang (1-7)/MasR signaling pathway resulting in decrease in inflammatory
  cytokines and reduced ROS contributing to neuroprotection and cell proliferation.
  Specific inhibitors like ARBs, ACEI, and renin inhibitors have demonstrated to improve
  the pathological conditions. Abbreviations: Ang I: angiotensin I; Ang II: angiotensin
