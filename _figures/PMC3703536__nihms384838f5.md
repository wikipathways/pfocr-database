caption: a ∣ The expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) can be induced by Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) or non-TLR signalling in macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells
  (DCs). Activation of TLRs and their adaptor molecules — myeloid differentiation
  primary-response protein 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing
  IFNβ (TRIF) — results in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (which are collectively referred to here as ERK), p38 and nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Activation of these pathways results in the induction
  of IL-10 expression, in addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines. In myeloid DCs,
  non-TLR signals through DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and RAF1
  can augment TLR2-induced IL-10 production. Furthermore, activation of dectin 1 and
  the signalling molecules spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and ERK results in IL-10 production.
  In macrophages, a role for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) signalling
  in IL-10 induction, in crosstalk with TLR2, has been described. b ∣ Positive and
  negative feedback loops for IL-10 regulation in macrophages. The p38 and ERK pathways
  leading to IL-10 expression by macrophages are tightly controlled by interferon-γ
  (IFNγ) and IL-10 itself. IL-10 feeds back to induce the expression of dual-specificity
  protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), which negatively regulates p38 phosphorylation and
  thus limits IL-10 production. IL-10 can also positively feed back to upregulate
  tumour progression locus 2 (TPL2) expression, thus providing a positive amplification
  loop for its own production. In addition, IFNγ can also interfere with the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT pathway, releasing glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). As GSK3
  normally blocks IL-10 expression by acting on the transcription factors cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB) and activator protein 1 (AP1), IL-10 production is
  inhibited by IFNγ through its effects on PI3K. IL-10R, IL-10 receptor; MEK, MAPK/ERK1
