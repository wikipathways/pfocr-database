caption: Pexophagy-related peroxisomal proteins. (A) PEX5 ubiquitination is a critical
  signal that promotes the initiation of pexophagy. This post-translational modification
  is triggered by various physiological conditions, including dysfunction of the AAA
  complex, amino acid starvation, and stimulation by ROS. (B) Under starvation conditions,
  PEX14 directly interacts with LC3, thereby promoting the initiation of pexophagy.
  Additionally, PEX14 serves as a molecular bridge linking Optineurin (OPTN) to the
  pexophagy pathway. (C) The expression levels of peroxisomal proteins significantly
  affect the pexophagy process. The loss of PEX13, PEX16, catalase, EHHADH, or the
  AAA complex leads to enhanced pexophagy. While this regulation is partially linked
  to ROS production and PEX5 ubiquitination, the precise mechanisms underlying these
  effects remain to be fully elucidated. Conversely, the overexpression of PEX3 has
  been shown to promote pexophagy through the ubiquitination of an unidentified protein.
  (D) PMP70, ubiquitinated by E3 ligases such as PEX2 and MARCH5, recruits pexophagy
  receptors, which facilitate pexophagy under diverse cellular conditions
