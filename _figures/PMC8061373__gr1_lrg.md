caption: 'The schematic hypothesis of the proposed mechanisms of TLR3 derived from
  SARS-CoV-2 leading to hypertension. SARS Cov-2 cellular entry and subsequent replication
  may trigger the immune system. dsRNA derived from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids trigs
  TLR3 leading to IRAK-dependent and –independent TLR3-mediated pathway, including
  PKR activation. Further, an inflammatory cascade is formed in response to this signaling
  which results in vascular damage, augmented blood pressure and hypertension. In
  this way, Sars-CoV-2 dsRNA may contribute to hypertension through the above pathway
  (dsRN/TLR3/PKR/vascular inflammation/increased blood pressure). Key references:
