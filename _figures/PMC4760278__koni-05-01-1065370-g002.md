caption: Sinergistic effects of PARP inhibitors and mAbs targeting EGF, HER2 and VEGF
  pathways. (A) Ligands binding to EGFR activates various intracellular signaling
  pathways including AKT, ERK and STAT pathways resulting in increased cell proliferation,
  migration, survival and expression of components of the HR pathway. HER2 activation
  requires heterodimerization with other (ligand-bound) EGFR-family receptors, most
  notably HER3 (left panel). These processes are limitated by mAbs targeting these
  receptors (central panel). Interestingly, decrease HR components expression may
  generate a BRCAness situation that in the presence of PARP inhibitors result in
  synthetic lethality and cell death. Moreover, PARP inhibitors might overcame the
  resistance to mAbs targeting either EGFR or HER2 by different mechanisms (right
  panel). (B) Ligand binding to VEGF activates various intracellular signaling pathways
  including AKT, and ERK resulting in angiogenesis. mAbs against VEGF or VEGFR prevent
  the activation of VEGF-dependent signaling pathways and therefore limited angiogenesis.
  Mechanisms of resistance to mAbs targeting VEGF pathway comprise the activation
  of a hypoxia response including HIF induction, which in turn drives the release
  of additional angiogenic factors. PARP inhibitors dampen the expression and function
  of HIF. In addition, cells exposed to hypoxia have decreseased HR response that
  in the presence of PARP inhibitors might leads to cell death by the principle of
  synthetic lethality.
