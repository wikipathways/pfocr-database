caption: Schematic model of UPR signalling. Under ER stress, GRP78 is released from
  IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, inducing three separate UPR signals; (1) PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α, inhibiting protein translation. Phospho eIF2α enhances ATF4 expression, activating
  the transcription of UPR genes that regulate the antioxidative response, autophagy,
  and apoptosis mechanisms. (2) IRE1 induces XBP-1 splicing and RIDD pathway through
  RNase activity. XBP1s regulates genes involved in ER proteostasis, while RIDD modulates
  degradation of mRNAs and miRNAs to reduce protein burden. On the other hand, cytosolic
  domain of IRE1 interacts with TRAF2 to activate ASK1 and JNK, inducing apoptosis.
  (3) ATF6 is transported to the Golgi apparatus followed by its cleavage via proteases.
  Then, active cATF6 enters the nucleus and modulates ER enzymes and chaperones. ASK1,
  apoptosis signal-regulating kinase; ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; ATF4,
  activating transcription factor 4; cATF6, cleaved ATF6; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2α; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein 78; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme;
  JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; PERK, protein kinase-like ER kinase; RIDD, regulated
  IRE1-dependent decay; S1P, site 1 protease; S2P, site 2 protease; TRAF2, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 2; UPR, unfolded protein response; XBP1, X-box
  binding protein 1; XBP1s, spliced x-box binding protein 1.
