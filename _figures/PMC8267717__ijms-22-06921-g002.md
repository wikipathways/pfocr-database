caption: Intracellular signaling of the TLR4 pathway via LPS binding. Liver cells
  such as Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells contain TLR4, which mediates the
  innate immunity response. LPS binding to LPS binding protein, which is a translocator
  for LPS, attaches to TLR4 and stimulates its downstream signal, including NF-κB
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which induces the transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These inflammatory cytokines
  cause liver inflammation as well as activating hepatic stellate cells, leading to
  excessive production of the extracellular matrix, which suggests that chronic exposure
  of LPS can result in the progression of liver fibrosis, culminating in liver cirrhosis.
