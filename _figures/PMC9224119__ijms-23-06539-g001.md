caption: TLR2, TLR1, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed on the outer cell membrane;
  they recognize both extracellular pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are
  located in endosomal compartments where they bind to nucleic acids. All TLRs use
  the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) pathway, except
  TLR3, whose signaling depends on the IFN-α (TRIF) pathway that contains the TIR
  domain-containing adapter. TLR activates the MyD88-dependent canonical pathway that,
  through recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) 6, leads to the activation
  of the transcription factor NF-KB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
  activator protein-1 (AP-1), with the consequent induction of the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Intracellular TLRs are primarily involved in the type I interferon response.
  TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 activate interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) through the
  recruitment of TRAF6. TLR3 and TLR4 use the TRIF-dependent pathway. TRAF3 is activated
  and consequently activates IRF3, resulting in the induction of type I interferon
  (IFN) production. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 24 February 2022).
