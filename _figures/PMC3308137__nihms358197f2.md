caption: miRNAs that promote or inhibit tumorigenesis provide diverse functions within
  oncogenic and tumor suppressor signaling pathways. (A) miR-34 family members and
  the miR-17-92 cluster function as signal mediators for the p53 and Myc pathways,
  respectively. (B) miR-16 negatively regulates multiple components of mitogenic pathways
  and thereby provides an inhibitory signal modulation function. (C) miR-146a is activated
  by NF-κB signaling and negatively feeds back on the pathway by repressing upstream
  activators of NF-κB. In this capacity, miR-146a restrains excessive NF-κB activity
  which can lead to tumorigenesis. (D) Let-7, miR-21, and the miR-143/145 cluster
  participate in positive feedback loops which function to stably enforce cellular
  transformation programs upon activation of oncogenes such as NF-κB, Kras, and Myc.
  (E) miR-26 can repress both pro-tumorigenic targets (cyclins D2 and E2) and anti-tumorigenic
  targets (PTEN). These opposing activities endow miR-26 with context-dependent positive
  or negative effects on tumorigenesis.
