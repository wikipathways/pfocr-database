caption: 'Mechanisms of ADE of viral infections. (A) Enhancement on FcγR bearing cells:
  (1) Viruses-antibody complexes are internalized to cells after antibody Fc-region
  binding to FcγR on the immune cells. (2) Subversion of the immune system response
  by reducing Th1 cytokines IL2, TNF-α and IFN-γ, increasing Th2 cytokines IL-10,
  IL-6, PGE-2 and INF-α, and inhibiting STAT pathway leading to decreased levels IRF
  and subsequent decrease in the antiviral iNOS. (3) Increased viral replication as
  a result of suppression of the antiviral response. (B) Enhancement on CR-bearing
  cells: (1) Formation of virus-antibody complexes. (2) This complex will activate
  the complement pathway by binding to C1q. Following activation, C2a and C4b proteins
  are recruited to produce C3 convertase, which in turn hydrolyses C3, to produce
  C3b. (3) C3b binds to the virus and to complement receptor (CR) on CR bearing cells.
  (4) Cell lysis and enhanced disease pathology.'
