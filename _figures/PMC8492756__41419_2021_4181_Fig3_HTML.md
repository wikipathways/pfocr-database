caption: Bone metastasis from PC mainly occurs via blood, where multiple signaling
  pathways are involved. Focus on the AKT signaling pathway, which has a remarkable
  relationship with autophagy, and TGF-β signaling pathway, which can induce EMT formation
  and release Smad protein to promote tumor metastasis.

  from prostate cancer.
