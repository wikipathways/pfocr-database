caption: Schematic representation of the proposed events triggered by exposure to
  replication inhibitors such as APH. Low doses of inhibitors cause temporary inhibition
  of replication forks that is resolved by conversion of those forks to transient
  DNA breaks by the action of BLM helicase and Mus81 nuclease. This activity requires
  phosphorylation of BLM by ATR. The transient breaks are rapidly repaired by the
  non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ); repair lead to recovery of replication
  at a slow rate even in the presence of the drug. In the absence of components of
  the NHEJ pathway such as DNA-PK or XRCC4, the breaks persist and lead to the activation
  of the S-phase checkpoint. High doses of inhibitors, BLM, Mus81 or ATR deficiencies
  may also lead to persistent breaks and checkpoint activation.

  DNA breaks in response to DNA replication stress.
