caption: Schematic showing position of air puffer and recording electrodes with a
  simplified representation of the neural pathway involved in R1 and R2 components
  of the blink reflex. Afferent signals from sensory fibres innervating the cornea
  and the skin at the palpebral margin travel via the supraorbital nerve (1st division
  of trigeminal nerve) and trigeminal ganglion to the brainstem. Efferent signals
  generating the blink response travel in fibres of the facial nerve (cranial VII)
  from its motor nucleus to the orbicularis oculi muscles
