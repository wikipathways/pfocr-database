caption: Natural products as TLR agonists and antagonists affecting various stages
  in the signaling pathway, including downstream molecules MyD88 and IKK. Agonist
  activity is shown in green while antagonist or inhibitory activity is shown in red.
  In particular, natural TLR agonists/antagonists are shown for TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6, and
  9. TLR, Toll-like Receptor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; TIRAP, Toll-Interleukin 1 Receptor
