caption: 'Regulation of cell migration by signaling endosomes. Leading edge: Cellular
  polarization, formation of the cell protrusion, lamellipodia and circular ruffles
  are controlled by the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. They are transported toward the
  plasma membrane on early endosomes in an Arf6-dependent manner. Activation of Cdc42
  and Rac involves endosomal association of their GEFs, αPIX and Tiam1, respectively.
  Src moves on early endosomes toward focal adhesions. PTPD1 localizes to early, late
  and recycling endosomes upon EGF receptor endocytosis. Late endosomes carrying p14/MP1
  MAPK scaffold complex can target focal adhesion and serve as a signaling platform
  for MAPK pathway (lower panel). Trailing edge: Focal adhesion disassembly requires
  integrin endocytosis and acto-myosin contractility. Integrins are endocytosed into
  early endosomes and are further recycled back to the leading edge to form new adhesions.
  Acto-myosin contractility is locally regulated by Endo180-carrying early endosomes
  through Rho-ROCK-MLC pathway and potentially through p14/MP1 late endosomes (lower
  panel).'
