caption: Fig. 6. Simplified model illustrating lesion channelling between homologous
  recombination and translesion synthesis. TLS, translesion synthesis; HR, homologous
  recombination. The effect of deleting (Δ) each gene is given under the gene name.
  Damage stalling a replication fork can be dealt with by either homologous recombination
  or post- replication repair. Ablation of genes involved in the ‘early’ stages of
  either of these pathways (e.g. XRCC2/3 or RAD18) results in lesions being channelled
  into the other pathway with a consequent increase in the detectable endpoints of
  those pathways (SCE for homologous recombination, Ig point mutation for translesion
  synthesis). However, loss of genes in the ‘later’ stages of either pathway (e.g.
  RAD54 and Rev1) is proposed to result in an intermediate that cannot be subsequently
  processed by the other pathway.
