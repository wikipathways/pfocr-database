caption: A two-step model for OR-instructed axonal projection of OSNs. OR-instructed
  A–P targeting and glomerular segregation are differentially regulated by distinct
  OR-derived cAMP signals. a A–P targeting is regulated by agonist-independent OR
  activity using a non-canonical signaling pathway. In immature OSNs, each OR generates
  a unique level of cAMP by agonist-independent baseline activity via Gs and ACIII.
  The level of cAMP signals is converted to transcription level of A–P targeting molecules,
  e.g., Nrp1 and PlxnA1, through the cAMP-activated PKA pathway, phosphorylating the
  transcription factor CREB. b Glomerular segregation is regulated by stimulus-driven
  neuronal activity using a canonical signal transduction pathway. In mature OSNs,
  different ORs generate different levels of neuronal activity using extrinsic stimuli,
  which ultimately determine the transcription levels of glomerular segregation molecules,
  e.g., Kirrel2 and Kirrel3. OR odorant receptor, AC adenylyl cyclase, PKA protein
  kinase A, CREB cAMP responsive element binding protein, PDE phosphodiesterase
