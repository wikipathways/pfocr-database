caption: 'Cytoscape visualization of the metabolic pathways altered by antipurinergic
  therapy in the Fragile X mouse model. Twenty-six of the 60 biochemical pathways
  interrogated in our metabolomic analysis are illustrated. See Additional file :
  Tables S2 and S3 for complete listing of pathways and discriminating metabolites,
  respectively. The fractional contribution of each of the top 20 pathways altered
  by suramin treatment is indicated as a percentage of the total variable importance
  in projection (VIP) score in the black circles. Purine metabolism contributed 20%
  of the top ranked VIP scores, followed by fatty acid oxidation (12%), eicosanoids
  (11%), gangliosides (10%), phospholipids (9%), and 15 other biochemical pathways
  as indicated. Smaller circles indicate the metabolites in each pathway, quantified
  by z-score. Metabolites in red were increased. Metabolites in green were decreased
  by treatment with suramin. Age 25 weeks, N = 9-11 per group.'
