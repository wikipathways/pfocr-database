caption: Schematic of the C4 NADP-malic enzyme-subtype pathway. In mesophyll (M) cells
  of this C4 subtype, the bicarbonate (HCO3-) produced from atmospheric CO2 by CA
  is used to carboxylate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP) by PEPC. The OAA formed
  is reduced to malate in M chloroplasts (green oval), by NADP-malate dehydrogenase
  (NADP-MDH), and then diffuses into BS cells, where it is decarboxylated in the chloroplast
  by NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME). The CO2 released is used to make carbohydrates by
  the PCR cycle, while the pyruvate diffuses to the M where it is converted to PEP
  by pyruvate Pi dikinase (PPDK).
