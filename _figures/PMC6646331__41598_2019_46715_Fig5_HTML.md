  (b) Sub-network of mGluRs and their regulatory DPCs: Green coloured nodes of the
  network correspond to 11 DPCs (PC146, PC161, PC163, PC179, PC461, PC496, PC501,
  PC620, PC650, PC708 and PC743) that possess the tendency to regulate 8 classes of
  mGluRs (Red coloured circular nodes). The binding energy values (kcal/mol) of the
  mGluRs and their regulatory DPCs are represented along with their corresponding
  edges in the network. For docking studies, the structure of mGluR6, mGluR4 and mGluR8
  were modelled using PHYRE2 while for others they were obtained from RCSB-PDB with
  following PDB-IDs: 3KS9 (mGluR1), 4XAS (mGluR2), 6B7H (mGluR3), 3LMK (mGluR5) and
  3MQ4 (mGluR7). (c) The interaction analysis of the mGluRs and their regulatory DPCs:
  Docked complexes with the best binding energy values are analysed for the hydrophobic
  interactions as well as hydrogen bonded residues using Ligplot+. The ligplots enclosed
  in boxes are the representative cases of multi-targeting and synergistic actions
  of selected phytochemicals respectively. Protein residues represented along the
  arcs are involved in the hydrophobic interactions whereas the residues involved
  in the hydrogen bonding are represented using dashed lines. The PC620 is shown to
  possess much negative binding energy compared to the other 10 DPCs and the interaction
  analysis highlights the importance of the acetamide group (-NHCOCH3) in the interaction.'
