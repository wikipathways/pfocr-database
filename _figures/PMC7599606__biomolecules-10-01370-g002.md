caption: An integrative view of glutamine metabolism. Glutamine (Gln) is a core nutrient
  in cell metabolism. Gln can be synthesized within the cancer cell, by glutamine
  synthase (GS) or be taken up from the tumor microenvironment, though different transporters,
  as SNAT3 and ASCT2. Gln is catalyzed by glutaminases (GLS) enzymes and glutamate
  (Glu) is generated. Glu can be uptaken from the tumor microenvironment in a process
  mediated by transporters such as GLT-1 and GLAST. Glu controls the entrance of cystine
  (Cys-Cys) in the cell, mediated by xc– antiporter; Cys-Cys is then converted into
  cysteine (Cys). Gln-derived Glu is used as a nitrogen source in the synthesis of
  serine (Ser) from glucose (Gluc)-derived 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG). Serine (Ser)
  can be converted into glycine (Gly) that supplies one-carbon metabolism (folate
  cycle plus methionine cycle) from which cysteine (Cys) is synthesized through the
  transsulfuration pathway (TSP). Glu, Cys and Gly are the three components of glutathione
  (GSH), whose synthesis occurs in two steps. In the first step, Glu and Cys are linked
  by glutamyl-cysteine ligase (GCL) and afterward, Gly is added to the dipeptide Glu-Cys
  by glutathione synthase (GSH-S). Gln-derived Glu can be converted into α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) and enter the tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle. α-KG can also be synthesized
  by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 wild type (IDH1/2wt) enzymes from isocitrate (Iso-C),
  with the consumption of NADP+ and release of NADPH. NADPH is canalized to other
  metabolic pathways such as the fatty acid synthesis catalyzed by the fatty acids
  synthase (FASN). The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutant (IDH1/2mt) enzymes further
  catalyze the conversion of α-KG into the onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (D2-HG),
  with NADPH consumption. Different Gln-derived TCA cycle intermediates such as fumarate
  (Fum), malate (Mal), citrate (Citr), and acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) can be deviated to
  supply fatty acid synthesis.
