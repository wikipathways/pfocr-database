caption: 'Negative regulators of Toll-like receptor signaling. TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9
  activate myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway.
  MYD88-adaptor-like protein (Mal) recruits MyD88 to TLR2 and TLR4. TLR3 activates
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent pathway. In
  association with TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), TLR4 can also activate TRIF-dependent
  pathway. Upon stimulation, MyD88 recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK),
  which is activated by phosphorylation and then associates with TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to the activation of transforming growth factor β-activated
  kinase (TAK1). TAK1 further activates the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 through
  MAPK and NF-κB pathways, respectively. TRIF binds to receptor-interacting protein
  1 (RIP1) and TRAF6, also leading to the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. TRIF also
  activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through TNFR-associated factor 3
  (TRAF3). A plethora of inhibitory mechanisms have been identified in TLR signaling:
  (i) interference of ligand binding, e.g., soluble forms of TLR2 and TLR4 compete
  with membrane-bond forms of TLRs for ligands binding; (ii) reduction of TLR expression,
  e.g., TGF-β suppresses the expression and function of TLR4; (iii) degradation of
  TLRs, e.g., TRIAD3A binds to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4 and TLR9 and promotes
  their ubiquitylation and degradation; (iv) inhibition of TLR downstream signaling,
  e.g., SOCS1, IRAKM, TOLLIP, IRAK2c/d, A20 and DUSP1; (v) change of structures of
  target genes through chromatin remodeling and histone modification, e.g., H2AK119
  ubiquitylation and H3K27 trimethylation inhibit the expression of TLR-signal-targeted
  genes; (vi) microRNAs can regulate TLR signaling by targeting TLRs, downstream signaling
  proteins, related regulatory molecules, transcription factors as well as genes induced
  by TLR signaling. The figure was made with tools from www.proteinlounge.com'
