caption: The role of miRNAs as a regulator of DDR. DNA damage triggers the activation
  of the ATR/CHK1 pathway, which is responsible for substrates phosphorylation (i.e.,
  H2AX, p53, and BRCA 1/2) to repair DNA damage. Single-strand DNA damage is identified
  and repaired by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway activation, predominantly
  through base excision repair (BER). With continuous PARP inhibition, ssDNA breaks
  are converted to dsDNA breaks during DNA replication in which replication forks
  stall at the point of DNA damage. Over-expressed or down-regulated miRNAs may affect
  DDR by changing the expression of repair genes.
