caption: (A) Trans-activation of Notch signaling occurs upon ligand binding ((Jagged1
  or Delta-like1) from transmitting cell to Notch receptor on the receiving cell.
  A series of proteolytic cleavages releases Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that
  translocate to the nucleus and interacts with MAML and CSL/RBPJ to form a ternary
  complex. This further leads to transcription of Notch target genes such as the Hes/Hey
  family of transcription factors. In our experimental model, we have genetically
  manipulated the Notch signaling pathway in myeloid cells that includes osteoclasts
  and their precursors. Mice expressing Cre recombinase under the direction of the
  Lysozyme M promoter (LysM) specific to myeloid lineage when bred to loxP-dnMAML
  or dnMAMLfl/- C57/BL6 mice, lead to expression of Cre recombinase, excision of stop
  codon and (B) expression of dnMAML fused to GFP. As seen in the panel B, osteoclasts
  from dnMAML mice differentiated ex vivo in presence of MCSF + RANKL for 3 days showed
  GFP expression while WT were negative for the same. Images were captured using Nikon
  Eclipse microscope (100× magnification) (C) Protein levels of NICD were detected
  using western blotting from WT and dnMAML osteoclasts ex vivo upon Notch stimulation
  (with or without Jagged 1, IgG as control). It was observed that levels of NICD
  remains unaltered in both the groups (WT and dnMAML) treated with MCSF or MCSF +
  RANKL confirming that Notch inhibition occurs as a downstream event post NICD release.
  This further corroborates our model under investigation supporting the fact that
  dnMAML expression inhibits the transcriptional complex culminating in specific Notch
  inhibition without altering the upstream signaling events.
