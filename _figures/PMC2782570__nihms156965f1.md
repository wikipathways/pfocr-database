caption: Multiple regulatory loops exist within the EGF signaling cascade. After the
  EGF receptor is activated by ligand two exchange factors generate active Ras, the
  classical Grb2-SOS complex and the recently discovered PLD mediated SOS recruitment.
  SOS activates Ras, which in turn recruits and activates the MAP kinase module. Multiple
  regulatory loops exist with the cascade, including a positive feedback loop from
  active Ras to SOS, a positive feed-forward loop from Ras to KSR, a positive feedback
  loop from ERK to KSR, a negative feedback loop from ERK to Raf, and a negative feedback
  loop from ERK back onto itself via the phosphatase DUSP6. The presence of so many
  regulatory loops provides the pathway with a variety of control systems, which may
  be used to create different types of output from the Ras pathway in vivo.
