caption: Step-wise processes from acute to chronic senescence. Progressing from early
  senescence induced by effector-mediated cell cycle arrest either to acute or chronic
  senescence modes, the diagram shows known biological processes associated with each
  stage of the senescence (bullets on the right). In all senescence cases, CDKI-mediated
  licensing of Rb proteins leads to an early senescent stage where the cell cycle
  arrest still could be reversed by manipulation of a single or combination of factors
  in the pathway of the action, such as inactivation of p16Ink4a or Rb. These early
  senescent cells while SA-β-Gal positive may or may not have fully developed SMS.
  Acute senescence is presumably beneficial, where senescent cells are cleared rapidly
  by the immune system as part of the program associated with embryonic development,
  regeneration, wound healing or tissue/organ injury repair. This setting contrasts
  with chronic senescence, which is a response to the slowly accumulating unresolved
  macromolecular damage, such as telomere erosion, proteotoxicity, DNA damage, and
  others. Chronic senescence evolves from acute senescence if immune clearance is
  impaired with age, leading to prolonged arrest and possibly alterations in the SMS.
  This type of senescence proceeds to full irreversible senescence through the stage
  associated with senescence reinforcement driven by cellular changes robust processes,
  such as epigenetic changes associated with heterochomatinization of cell cycle genes,
  activation of inflammasome and NF-κB–dependent transcriptional program. Although
  the full spectrum of drivers of this phenotypic switch in vivo is unclear, it likely
  causes a diversification in SMS that impacts on a local microenvironment and causes
  local and/or systemic inflammation. This arm of the senescence is detrimental for
  the tissue and organ homeostasis and probably is an underlying cause of many diseases
  and pathologies associated with aging.
