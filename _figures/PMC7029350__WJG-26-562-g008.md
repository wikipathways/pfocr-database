caption: 'Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge in the same terminal execution
  pathway, which is initiated by the cleavage of caspase-3. In the extrinsic pathway,
  FasL/FasR and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)/ tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR)1 associate with the adapter protein called Fas-associated death domain (FADD),
  and procaspase-8 and TNF-α/TNFR1 also need to bind to TNFR-associated death domain
  to initiate the execution pathway[]. In the intrinsic pathway, all stimuli can change
  the inner mitochondrial membrane to initiate the mitochondrial permeability transition
  and release two main groups of normally sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins, such
  as cytochrome c, from the mitochondria into the cytosol[]. These proteins activate
  procaspase-9 and caspase-9 to activate the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway[].
  Tea polyphenols (TPs) can promote apoptosis of tumor cells. In the intrinsic pathway,
  TPs can up-regulate p53, Bax, and PUMA, which are proteins that promote cell death.
  In addition, TPs can also induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria
  into the cytosol. In the extrinsic pathway, TPs induce apoptosis, mediated by caspase-8,
  through a FADD-dependent pathway. FADD: Fas-associated death domain; TRADD: TNFR-associated
  death domain; TP: Tea polyphenol.'
