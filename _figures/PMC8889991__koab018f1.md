caption: Proposed model for signaling in response to Al toxicity and Phosphate starvation.
  In Al toxicity or low Pi conditions, CK2 likely directly phosphorylates and primes
  SOG1 for the activation of the DDR, which results in root meristem exhaustion.  show
  that C43, an inhibitor of CK2, prevents SOG1 from being primed, which leads to tolerance
  toward Al toxicity and P starvation. Circled Ps represent phosphorate groups; gray
  arrows represent a potential CK2- and/or SOG1-independent pathway contributing to
  root meristem exhaustion in response to Al toxicity and P starvation; dashed arrows
  represent signaling that was not studied by . (Figure credit V. Hammoudi).
