caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between the HBP, mTOR and AMPK
  pathways. O-GlcNAcylation, as a PTM of a wide variety of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and
  mitochondrial proteins, participates in various cellular processes. The HBP integrates
  glucose, fatty acid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism to generate the substrate
  for O-GlcNAcylation, UDP-GlcNAc. GFAT is the rate-limiting step of the HBP and its
  activity can be regulated by AMPK through phosphorylation. The O-GlcNAc moiety can
  be transferred to the target proteins and removed by OGT and OGA, respectively.
  The activity of mTOR and GSK3β can be mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  and mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis by directly phosphorylating 4E-BP1 and p70S6K.
  In response to energy state, AMPK also regulates the mTORC1 activity. The localization,
  activity, and substrate specificity of OGT are regulated through phosphorylation
  by AMPK, IR/PI3K and GSK3β, and the mTOR signaling regulates the expression of OGT.
  In contrast, several actors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway have been found
  to be modified by O-GlcNAcylation, which leads to subsequent biological effects
  under different physiological conditions.
