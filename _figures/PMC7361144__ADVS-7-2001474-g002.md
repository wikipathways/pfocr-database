caption: 'The fusion steps and RNA synthesis process of CoVs. CoVs can fuse either
  directly to the a) plasma membrane or b) after endocytosis. The membrane fusion
  process is complex: c) the S1 subunit that has experienced conformation rearrangements
  bounds to a host cell receptor and later sheds; d) S2 triggers two bilayers into
  one; e) subsequently, HR1 and HR2 domains in S2 subunit form a 6‐HB fusion core,
  causing membranes fusion. After entry, f) genomic RNA (gRNA) is released from the
  viral coat and g) serves as the template for translation of polyproteins which h)
  encode nsps to form the i) RTC in DMVs where CoVs RNA synthesis is performed. Some
  CoVs N protein transited to the nucleus could recruit the helicase DDX1 which functioned
  in the RTC to facilitate synthesis of sgmRNA. j) CoVs utilize a whole‐length complementary
  negative‐strand RNA to k) replicate. However, CoVs produce sgmRNAs in a discontinuous
  manner. l) Genomic RNA serves as template to form negative‐strand subgenomic RNAs
  (sgRNA), m) which are subsequently utilized for the synthesis of multiple copies
  of sgmRNAs that will later n) encode viral structural proteins and accessory proteins.
  Eventually, viral gRNA and significant proteins assemble into viral particles in
  o) the ER–Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC) which are then p) secreted to the outside
  of cells via the secretory pathway. Upper‐right: S1 colored pink, HR1 colored orange,
  HR2 colored yellow, and 6‐HB colored red.'
