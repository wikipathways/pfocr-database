  Color reflects the logarithm of the case-to-normal ratio (CNR) of the pathway nodes,
  color scale is given (green – upregulated, red – downregulated, white – intact).
  Arrows show molecular interactions within a pathway: green stands for activation,
  red for inhibition. PAL values were calculated for the averaged biosamples in the
  treatment responder and non-responder groups'
