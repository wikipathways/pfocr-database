caption: Mφ-related inflammatory signaling pathways in NEC. During NEC, Mφs are activated
  under the stimulation of DAMPs/PAMPs, such as LPS, Cronobacter sakazakii, HMGB1
  and lactate, that initiates the intestinal inflammation leading to NEC. (1) In Mφs,
  LPS binds to TLR4, then recruits MyD88 and IRAK1/IRAK4. These molecules activate
  TRAF6 which in turn activates the IKK complex and MAPK kinase. MAPK kinase subsequently
  phosphorylates JNK and p38 MAPK, which activate the transcription factor AP-1. The
  IKK complex allows hosphorylation of IκB and subsequently degraded following ubiquitination,
  resulting in the activation of NF-κB and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  (2) CS induces TLR4/MyD88 signaling in Mφs and up-regulates the expression of NF-κB,
  which triggeres NEC through the NLRP3/caspase-1 pyroptosis pathway. (3) HMGB1 promotes
  intestinal inflammation in NEC by activating NLRP3 through TLR4 and NF-κB signaling
  pathways; and HMGB1 promotes chemotaxis through RAGE pathway and activates NF-κB
  signaling pathway to induce inflammation. (4) Mφs uptake extracellular lactate via
  MCT to promote HMGB1 lactylation via a p300/CBP-dependent mechanism. Extracellular
  lactate is also recruited to the nucleus through GPR81 to stimulate the acetylation
  of HMGB1. Lactylated/acetylated HMGB1 is released into extracellular through exosomes
  secreted by Mφs to continue as DAMP.
