caption: Regulatory interactions of Usv101. (A) Capsule-involved regulators of USV101,
  GAT201, or RIM101 as determined by the NetProphet network (see  in the supplemental
  material) and their temporal expression patterns during 24 h of capsule induction.
  Targets of the node labeled “cAMP pathway” are regulated by both Pkr1 (the repressive
  subunit of the heterotetrameric complex) and Cac1 (the adenylate cyclase catalytic
  subunit) in opposite directions. Inside that node, the estimated activity of the
  cAMP pathway is plotted against time (see  for details). (B) Usv101 regulation of
  targets required for normal capsule growth. Shown are direct, functional targets
  of Usv101 under noninducing conditions (top center), 90 min after shifting to inducing
  conditions (bottom right), and 24 h after shifting to induction conditions (bottom
  left). All targets shown are required for normal capsule growth and either were
  bound by Usv101 in one of our ChiP-seq experiments or showed a strong potential
  for binding by Usv101 (based on their promoter sequences and the Usv101 binding
  motif we recovered from ChIP-seq). Targets that met those criteria are shown as
  being regulated at a given time if they were differentially expressed between wild-type
  and usv101Δ cells at that time point. Round nodes, target genes encoding TFs; square
  nodes, non-TF target genes; blue nodes, corresponding mutants are hypocapsular;
  yellow nodes, corresponding mutants are hypercapsular; arrowheaded lines, activation;
  T-headed lines, repression.
