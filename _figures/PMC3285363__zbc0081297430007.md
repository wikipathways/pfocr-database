caption: Hypothetical scheme illustrating a possible mechanism of mLDL-mediated regulation
  of C3 expression and secretion by human macrophages. mLDL is taken up by macrophage,
  which results in intracellular oxidized cholesterol accumulation. Oxidized cholesterol
  (LXR ligand) activates C3 gene transcription via LXR interacting with LXRE inside
  the human C3 gene promoter. Interaction of mLDL with CD14 and TLR4 stimulates both
  C3 gene transcription (via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway) and C3 protein secretion
  (via NF-κB activation) by macrophage. Produced as a result of complement activation,
  anaphylatoxin C3a interacts with C3a receptor (C3aR) and promotes C3 transcription
  and mLDL uptake by macrophage. The arrows show activation, and the dotted line arrows
  show transport of C3 and C3 cleavage products inside or outside of the cell. For
  a further explanation, see “Results” and “Discussion.”
