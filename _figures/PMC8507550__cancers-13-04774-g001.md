caption: The canonical Hedgehog-GLI signaling. In the absence of any Hedgehog ligand
  stimulation (a), the transmembrane receptor PTCH1 inhibits the G-coupled protein
  Smoothened (SMO). GLI transcription factors are phosphorylated by PKA, CK1, and
  GSK3β and are thus recognized by SuFu, which sequesters them outside the nucleus.
  Herein, GLI2 and GLI3 are processed into the repressive forms, which hinder the
  transcription of Hedgehog target genes. GLI1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS). The presence of a Hedgehog ligand that specifically binds PTCH1 (b)
  releases the inhibitory regulation of SMO. Accordingly, SMO initiates an intracellular
  cascade, which terminates with the translocation of the GLI as active forms into
  the nucleus, promoting the transcription of Hedgehog target genes.
