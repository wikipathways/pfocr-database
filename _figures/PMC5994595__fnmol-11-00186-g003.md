caption: The image shows the excitatory toxicity model of METH. METH-mediated increase
  in extracellular glutamate level leads to stimulation of mGluR1/5 or N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptors (NMDARs). mGluR1/5-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation phosphorylates
  and upregulates NMDAR function, leading to Ca2+ influx. The signaling results in
  enhancement of cytosolic Ca2+ level associated with nNOS activity, leading to NO
  production. NO acts as an ER stressor, and then, UPR signaling pathway would be
  initiated in response to ER stress through three ER transmembrane mediators [inositol
  requiring protein-1 (IRE1)α, activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and protein
  kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)]. Subsequently, the mediators lead to special genes
  transcription as CHOP, GRP78, and Caspase 12 which triggering a series of cascade
  involving apoptosis and autophagy.
