caption: Overview of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. (a) In canonical Wnt
  signaling, absence of Wnt ligands (Wnt signaling inactive state, left) leads to
  phosphorylation of β-catenin by the destruction complex, which contains the scaffold
  protein Axin, APC and the kinases GSK3β and casein kinase (CK1α). In this state,
  β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β, ubiquitinated by β-TrCP and targeted for proteasomal
  degradation. In the absence of nuclear β-catenin, a repressive complex containing
  TCF/LEF and transducing-like enhancer protein (TLE/Groucho) recruits HDACs to repress
  target genes. The canonical pathway is activated upon binding of secreted Wnt ligands
  (for example, Wnt3a and Wnt1) to Fzd receptors and LRP co-receptors (Wnt signaling
  active, right). LRP receptors are then phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK3β, which recruits
  Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins to the plasma membrane where they polymerize and are
  activated. The Dvl polymers inactivate the destruction complex, for example, by
  sequestration in multivesicular bodies. This results in stabilization and accumulation
  of β-catenin which then translocates into the nucleus. There, β-catenin forms an
  active complex with LEF (lymphoid enhancer factor) and TCF (T-cell factor) proteins
  by displacing TLE/Groucho complexes and recruitment of histone modifying co-activators
  such as CBP/p300, BRG1, BCL9 and Pygo (reviewed in Lien and Fuchs). This transcriptional
  switch leads to a change of multiple cellular processes.,  (b) Non-canonical Wnt
  signaling is defined by β-catenin-independent mechanisms of signal transduction.
  During Wnt/PCP signaling, Wnt ligands bind to the ROR-Frizzled receptor complex
  to recruit and activate Dvl. Dvl binds to the small GTPase Rho by de-inhibition
  of the cytoplasmic protein DAAM1 (Dvl associated activator of morphogenesis 1).
  The small GTPase Rac1 and Rho together trigger ROCK (Rho kinase) and JNK. This leads
  to rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and/or transcriptional responses via for example,
  ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2). Next to Dvl, Vangl, a key member of Wnt/PCP
  signaling is activated by phosphorylation in a Wnt5a-dependent manner. Wnt/Ca2+
  signaling is initiated by G-protein triggered phospholipase C activity leading to
  intracellular calcium fluxes and downstream calcium dependent cytoskeletal and/or
  transcriptional responses.
