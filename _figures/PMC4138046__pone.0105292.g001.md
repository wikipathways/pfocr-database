caption: 'The model includes the Calvin-Benson cycle, glycogen synthesis, photorespiratory
  pathways, glycolysis, and sink reactions (representing the adjacent pathway and
  calculation of biomass production). Three reactions catalyzed by isozymes include
  phosphoglycerate mutases (green), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (blue),
  and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (red). Reversibility of a particular reaction is
  indicated by two small arrows. For further details, see . Purple color shows involved
  enzymes: RuBisCO-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, PGK-phosphoglycerate
  kinase, GAP-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TPI-triose phosphate isomerase,
  ALDO-aldolase, FBPase-fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, PFK-phosphofructokinase, TKT-transketolase,
  SBPase-sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, RPI-phosphopentose isomerase, PPE-phosphopentose
  epimerase, PRK-phosphoribulokinase, GPI-glucose-6-phosphat isomerase, PGPase-phosphoglycolate
  phosphatase, GOX-glycolate oxidase, SGAT-serine-glyoxylate transaminase, HPR-hydroxypyruvate
  reductase, GLYK-glycerate kinase, AGT-alanine-glyoxylate transaminase, TSS-tartronate
  semialdehyde synthase, TSA-tartronate semialdehyde reductase, SHMT-serine hydroxymethyltransferase,
