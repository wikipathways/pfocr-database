caption: Proposed model of M-CSF-mediated organization of the osteoclast cytoskeleton.
  In the current study, we find that ligand occupancy of the M-CSF receptor, c-Fms,
  transits GDP-bound Rap1 to its active, GTP-bound state. Active Rap1 promotes association
  of talin with the cytoplasmic domain of αvβ3 integrin, leading to induction of its
  high-affinity conformation. Upon ligand occupancy, the integrin activates a canonical
  signaling pathway, which we previously demonstrated consists of c-Src, Syk, Dap
  12, and Vav3. The last is a relatively osteoclast-specific Rac guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor. GTP-Rac organizes the cell's cytoskeleton via Arp2/3 (not shown),
  including actin ring formation, thus permitting it to resorb bone.
