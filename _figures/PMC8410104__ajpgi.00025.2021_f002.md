caption: Fungal pathogens induce inflammatory microenvironments. C-type lectin receptors
  recognize fungal invasion through surface receptors on molecules of the innate immune
  system or via soluble mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated sensing. The proinflammatory
  storm further “trains” an adaptive immune system. Malassezia spp. secrete hydrolase
  to release host lipids and indoles, which act as potent agonists for AhRs that can
  trigger immune cell activation. Malassezia spp. can also activate the C3 complement-MBL
  pathway to promote an immunosuppressive tumor milieu, as in PC. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor; CD4+, cluster of differentiation 4 positive; CLR, C-type lectin receptor;
  GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; PC, pancreatic cancer;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; Treg, regulatory T-cells.
