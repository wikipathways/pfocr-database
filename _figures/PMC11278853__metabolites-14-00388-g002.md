caption: 'Emerging evidence regarding the anti-cancer features of novel lipid-lowering
  treatments, including CETP inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 inhibitors. (A).
  CETP inhibitors may confer anti-cancer effects by inhibiting the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway and activating the JNK signaling pathway. The activation of JNK by CETP
  inhibition exhibits apoptotic activity, resulting in diminished tumorigenesis. Additionally,
  CETP inhibition may reduce tumorigenesis by dampening the activation of Wnt/β-Catenin.
  Specifically, CETP silencing has been associated with decreased activation of luciferase,
  reduced levels of the phosphorylated form of β-catenin (p-β-catenin (Ser675)), and
  lower levels of target genes involved in Wnt signaling, including axin2, cyclin
  D1, c-myc, and survivin. (B). Bempedoic acid has been suggested to possess anti-malignant
  properties through its ability to inhibit ACLY. SREBP1 promotes ACLY transcription,
  while the phosphorylation of Akt—mediated by both growth factors and glucose abundance—facilitates
  the enzyme’s acetylation and stabilization. ACLY activation leads to citrate deprivation,
  resulting in reduced tumorigenesis by enhancing the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Interestingly, citrate deprivation is also linked to increased activity of regulatory
  enzymes in glycolysis, specifically PFK1 and PFK2. (C). PCSK9 silencing may exhibit
  anti-cancer properties by either reducing tumor cell proliferation or enhancing
  cancer cell apoptosis. PCSK9 inhibitors can facilitate apoptosis by increasing the
  activation of caspase-3 and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins such as p-Akt
  and XIAP. Furthermore, PCSK9 inhibition may promote tumor cell apoptosis by interfering
  with mitochondrial signaling pathways. This interference is associated with an increased
  Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, leading to the elevated release of cytochrome-c. Abbreviations:
