caption: Schematic overview of the activation and regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway. Activation of PI3K is stimulated by binding of an extracellular
  ligand (e.g., hormones, growth factors, and cytokines) to a cell surface receptor
  such as the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) in the plasma membrane. Activated RTK
  recruits adaptor proteins, which bind to the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K and
  subsequently activate the catalytic subunits for full PI3K activation. PI3K is also
  activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or small GTPase Ras, which bind
  PI3K directly. Activated PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-phosphate
  (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt to the plasma membrane inducing Akt phosphorylation by PDK1
  at T308. Akt activation is completed by phosphorylation at S473 by mTOR complex
  2 (mTORC2). The mTOR complex includes two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and
  mTORC2. mTORC1 comprises of mTOR, proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein 8 (mLST8, also known
  as GβL), and DEP-domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor) []. mTORC2
  comprises of mTOR, mLST8, Deptor, protein observed with Rictor-1 (Protor), rapamycin-insensitive
  companion of mTOR (Rictor), and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting
  protein (mSin1) []. Akt indirectly activates mTORC1 by phosphorylation and inhibition
  of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) at S939 and T1462, releasing the inhibitory
  effects of this complex on Ras-related GTPase Rheb, an activator of mTORC1. Akt
  also directly controls activation of mTORC1 in a TSC2-independent manner via phosphorylation
  of PRAS40 at T246. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/90 kDa ribosomal
  S6 kinase (RSK) and liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1/AMPK) signaling
  pathways impinge on several nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and can modulate
  mTORC1 activity. Both ERK and RSK modulate mTORC1 activity by phosphorylation of
  TSC2 at S664 and S540 (ERK) and S1798 (RSK). ERK1/2 can also control mTORC1 activation
  by phosphorylation of Raptor at S8, S696, and S863. Master metabolic regulator AMPK
  inhibits mTORC1 activity in two different pathways, the first by phosphorylation
  of TSC2 at T1271 and S1387 and the second by phosphorylation of Raptor at S722 and
  S792. Activated mTORC1 promotes cap-dependent mRNA translation via phosphorylation
  of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)
  at T37 and T46, which is a priming event required for subsequent phosphorylation
  of several carboxy-terminal serum-sensitive sites to release 4E-BP1 from eIF4E.
  Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) is a downstream target of mTORC1, activated
  by phosphorylation at T389 by mTORC1 as well as T229 phosphorylation mediated by
  PDK1. S6K1 in turn activates ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), which is dispensable for
  cell growth and protein synthesis. RSK can also directly activate rpS6 via phosphorylation
  at S235 and S236. The black arrows represent positive regulation (activation), whereas
  the red blunt-ended lines indicate negative regulation (inhibition). IRS-1 = insulin
  receptor substrate 1, PTEN = phosphatase and tensin homolog, GDP = guanosine diphosphate,
  GTP = guanosine triphosphate, JAK = Janus kinase, STAT = signal transducer and activator
  of transcription. Created with BioRender.com.
