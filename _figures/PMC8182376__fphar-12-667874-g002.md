caption: 'The insulin signaling and the potential pro-cognitive effects of anti-diabetic
  agents. Insulin binds to insulin receptor to play its part, which promotes PI3K
  and Akt, the major downstream nodes of insulin signaling. The downstream targets
  of Akt such as mTOR, GSK3, CREB as well as FOXO play a role in cognitive function.
  Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt also affects the translocation of the
  insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. In addition
  to the PI3K/Akt cascade above, insulin activates the MAPK pathways. Anti-diabetic
  agents boosting insulin signaling exhibit promising pro-cognitive effects. Metformin
  inhibits mitochondrial complex Ⅰ, thereby increasing AMP/ATP ratio and activating
  AMPK to protect neurons from oxidative stress. Metformin also upregulates the expression
  of BDNF via the activation of AMPK and CREB. GLP-1 agonists increase cAMP levels
  followed by activating PI3K/Akt signaling and PKA signaling pathways. Pioglitazone
  and rosiglitazone activate PPAR γ, resulting in gene transcription and neuroprotective
  effects. Sulforaphane exhibits promising neuroprotective effects which is known
  for an activator of Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway. Quercetin also enhances
  cognitive function through its AMPK activity and modulating Akt signaling. IRS:
  insulin receptor substrate; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: protein kinase
  B; CREB: cAMP response element binding protein; FOXO: forkhead box transcription
  factors of the class O; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin kinase; GSK3: glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; GLUT: glucose transporter; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; GLP: glucagon-like peptide; PKA: protein kinase
  A; VGCCs: voltage gated calcium channels; PPAR: peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptors.'
