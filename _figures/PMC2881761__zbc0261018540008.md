caption: Proposed mechanism of cAMP-independent PKAc activation by dissociation of
  an NFκB-IκB-PKAc complex in thrombin- and collagen- stimulated platelets. In platelets,
  both collagen and thrombin activate the PI3K pathway that stimulates PKC and PKB
  which are involved in platelet activation. However, both pathways stimulate IKK
  and degradation of an NFκB-IκB-PKAc complex, setting free active PKAc that phosphorylates
  VASP and other substrates involved in platelet inhibitory pathways. Note that in
  order to simplify the illustration, it was necessary to limit it to the few pathways
  shown that were the focus of this study. Dotted lines indicate that intermediary
  agents which transmit thrombin/collagen effects on NFκB-IκB-PKA signaling require
  further elucidation.
