caption: 'PD-1 signaling enfeebles T cell functions. When engaged with PD-L1, PD-1
  transmits a co-inhibitory signal to hinder T cell activation through the phosphorylation
  of ITIM and ITSM, thereby recruiting the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 and SHP2. PD-1
  then mediates decreased phosphorylation of TCR signaling transducers including ZAP-70,
  PKC-θ, CD3ζ, Vav1, PLCγ1, and further downstream molecules JNK, RAS, MEK, and ERK.
  In addition to TCR signaling, PD-1 can also hamper co-stimulatory molecules CD28
  and ICOS. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 recruits and activates PI3K, resulting
  in AKT phosphorylation. PI3K-AKT activation facilitates enhanced glucose uptake,
  glycolysis and cellular metabolism of T cells, which can be restrained through PD-1
  engagement. The inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway through PD-1 involves PTEN dephosphorylation,
  mediated by CK2 downregulation. PD-1 blocks cell cycle progression through the G1
  phase by inhibiting SKP2 expression and Smad3 activation, which is mediated by PI3K-AKT,
  RAS and MEK-ERK pathways, leading to the downregulation of glycolytic enzyme activity
  and decreased T cell expansion. PD-1 signaling alters T cell differentiation by
  decreasing Th1 cells and Th17 cells as well as increasing Th2 cells and Tregs, which
  induced by the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. During T cell activation, CD28 stimulation
  retains T cell survival by upregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL.
  PD-1 ligation hampers Bcl-xL expression by limiting PI3K activation. PD-L1 can enhance
  the death of effector CD8+ T cells through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecule
  Bim, causing the depletion of memory CD8+ T cells. Meanwhile, PD-1 signaling alters
  cytokine production of T cells by attenuating proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2
  and IL-12) production and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion.
