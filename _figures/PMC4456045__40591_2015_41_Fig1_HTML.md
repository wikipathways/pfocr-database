caption: All TLRs signal through the common MyD88-dependent pathway. MyD88 signals
  via downstream kinases eventually leading to the activation of NF-κB and inflammatory
  cytokine production. TLR preconditioning triggers cross activation of both MyD88-dependent
  and Trif-dependent pathways with PI3K/Akt to protect the heart against I/R injury.
  TLR activation initiates an adaptive immune respons to maintain organ function through
  both the PI3K survival and NF-κB signaling pathways and moderate expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines IL-1 ß, IL-6, and TNF-α. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling limits pro-inflammatory
  and apoptotic events induced by TLR-NF-κB pathway through an endogenous compensatory
  mechanism and protects against I/R injuries. But, exaggerated activation of TLRs
  leads to a positive-feedback-regulation loop in inflammatory pathway and robuset
  activation of TLR-NF-κB, which subsequently results in cardiac injury and heart
  impairment
