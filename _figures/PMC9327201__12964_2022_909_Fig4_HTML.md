caption: Effects of glutamine metabolism inhibitors on immune response. Glutamine
  antimetabolites L-DON and JHU-083 can inhibit glutamine metabolism, glycolysis,
  and OXPHOS in tumor cells, and comprehensively disintegrate the energy metabolism
  of tumors (①). Glutamine antimetabolites directly modulate the metabolism of CD8+CTLs
  to promote a long-lasting, activated, memory-like phenotype; enhance cytokine production;
  and inhibit exhaustion and apoptosis (②). Glutamine antimetabolites inhibit the
  generation and recruitment of MDSCs and induce the differentiation of MDSCs and
  TAMs into pro-inflammatory TAMs by suppressing the secretion of CSF3 (③). Glutamine
  antimetabolites inhibit the expression of IDO in tumor and myeloid derived cells;
  reduce the levels of kynurenine; and enhance anti-tumor immune response (④). Glutamine
  antimetabolites inhibit the HBP metabolic pathway; decrease the levels of hyaluronan;
  change the mechanical properties of the ECM; improve the immunosuppressive TME and
  enhance the anti-tumor immune response (⑤). Glutamine uptake inhibitor V-9302 has
  distinct effects on the differentiation of T cell subsets, favoring CD4+Th1 and
  CD8+CTL but reducing the levels of Treg cells (⑥, ⑧). Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839
  enhances the activation of CD4 + Th1 and CD8 + CTL but suppress the differentiation
  of CD4+Th17 cells (⑦, ⑧)
