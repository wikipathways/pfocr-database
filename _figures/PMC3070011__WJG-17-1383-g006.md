caption: 'Structure of CagA and signaling cross-talk between VacA and CagA. A: CagA
  encompasses two fragments: the N-terminal 100-kDa fragment may contain the cell
  binding domain [to phosphatidylserine (PS)?]. Cleavage of CagA may take place just
  at the beginning of the first EPIYA motif, which can be tyrosine-phosphorylated
  by the c-Src tyrosine kinase. The C-terminal portion of CagA, which contains all
  the signaling activity of the molecule, may have a different molecular mass (up
  to 45 kDa) due to the repetition of the EPIYA-containing domain; B: CagA produced
  within the bacterium is transferred in the external medium by the type IV secretion
  system (TFSS) machinery. Two possibilities for CagA transfer into the target epithelial
  cell: (a) by binding to an integrin (INT), the TFSS punches the cell membrane and
  injects CagA; or (b) the TFSS induces the flipping of PS on the outer cell surface.
  By its 100-kDa N-terminal fragment, CagA binds PS and, upon endocytosis, which is
  transferred into the gastric cells. In the cytosol, the CagA signaling domain can
  be tyrosine-phosphorylated (+YP) and inhibits the c-Src kinase activity that is
  required to allow the transfer of VacA from glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
  protein-enriched early endosomal compartments (GEECs) to early endosomes (EEs).
  This blocks vacuolation in late endosomes (LEs) and mitochondria (M)-dependent apoptosis
  induced by VacA. In an unphosphorylated (-YP) state, CagA activates mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB
  anti-apototic and pro-inflammatory pathways, which also counteract VacA-induced
  apoptosis. VacA interferes with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) activation
  and endocytosis, thus impairing the signaling pathway that is triggered by this
  receptor. Free EGFR ligands (EGF) are liberated from the cell-surface-bound molecules
  via cleavage triggered by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). TJ: Tight junction.'
