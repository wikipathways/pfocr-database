caption: Schematic presentation of TA on skin wound healing molecular mechanism. The
  mechanism of TA was attributed to activating Erk 1/2 pathway. TA stimulated the
  growth factors such as bFGF secreted and then bFGF activated Erk 1/2 pathway to
  make proliferation, differentiation, and growth.
