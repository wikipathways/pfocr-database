caption: 'PGC1α regulation of NAD Biosynthesis. NAD+ is metabolized through three
  pathways. The salvage pathway recycles NAD+ after it is converted to NAM. The Priess-Handler
  Pathway creates NAD+ from nicotinic acid, and the de novo biosynthesis pathway metabolizes
  NAD+ from tryptophan. PGC1α expression upregulates the enzymes that comprise the
  de novo biosynthesis pathway. SIRT1 cleaves NAD to NAM to order to perform its actions,
  which include stimulation of PGC1α, creating a positive feedback loop. AKI reduces
  expression of PGC1α, SIRT1, and enzymes of the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway
  with a resultant reduction in total NAD+. Abbreviations: : PGC1α - Peroxisome proliferator
  activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha, NAD - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
  NAM - niacinamide, SIRT - sirtuin, AKI - acute kidney injury, NMN - nicotinamide
  mononucleotide.'
