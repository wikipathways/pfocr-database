caption: A working model for rice NLR protein-induced defense signaling pathway. After
  perceiving cognate effectors from blast fungi, rice NLR proteins, including PID3,
  Pi9, Pit, and Pi-a, transduce their signals to the downstream component OsSPK1,
  a GEF, by directly binding with it. OsSPK1 facilitates the conversion of the GTPase
  OsRac1 at the plasma membrane from an inactive GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound
  one. Activated OsRac1 leads to the activation of the transcription factor RAI1 in
  the nucleus, which in turn drives transcriptional reprogramming of defense-related
  genes. Whether RAI1 participates in Pit- or Pi-a-induced blast resistance remains
  to be answered (marked with a question mark). Both PID3 and Pi9 show affinity with
  RAI1 in the nucleus, presumed to protect RAI1 from the degradation by 26S proteasome.
  Tonoplast/ER-localized component OsRPT2a provides a solution to fine-tuning RAI1
  accumulation in vivo. By a yet unknown way, OsRPT2a translocates into the nucleus,
  where it associates with RAI1, leading to reduced RAI1 accumulation in a proteasome-dependent
  manner.
