caption: Repeat containing mRNAs form highly stable structures (hairpins or G-quadruplexes)
  that cause scanning pre-initiation complexes to pause at in-frame near-AUG codons
  or access the RNA through internal ribosomal entry. These processes lead to translation
  from these repeats in multiple reading frames in the absence of an AUG codon. The
  repeat mRNA and the resulting protein products elicit cellular stress and activate
  the ISR pathway, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α. This in turn selectively activates
  RAN translation while suppressing global protein synthesis, creating a toxic feed-forward
  loop that can lead to neurodegeneration (; ; ; ).
