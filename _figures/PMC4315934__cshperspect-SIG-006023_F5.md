caption: Smooth muscle contraction. Calcium released by L-type calcium channels or
  IP3Rs downstream from Gq-coupled cell-surface receptors causes smooth muscle contraction.
  It binds to calmodulin (CaM) and the resulting complex stimulates myosin light-chain
  (MLC) kinase (MLCK). This phosphorylates MLC to promote contraction. A RhoA/ROCK
  pathway and a diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway contribute to calcium sensitization by
  altering the phosphorylation status of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP). Relaxation
  is mediated through the cGMP/PKG pathway downstream from nitric oxide (NO) and agonists
  such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).
