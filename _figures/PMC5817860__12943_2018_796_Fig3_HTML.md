caption: Crosstalk between c-Met and EGFR. a, b The tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR
  and c-Met can initiate downstream PI3K/Akt signaling resulting in anti-apoptotic
  processes and Grb2/MAPK activation to promote the proliferation of tumor cells.
  Therefore, it is speculated that there might be an effect that allows c-Met to bypass
  the EGFR receptor to activate its downstream pathway, resulting in resistance to
  EGFR-TKI monotherapy. c c-Met-TKI monotherapy triggers upregulation of the EGFR
  ligand TGF-α, as well as upregulation of the EGFR protein family receptor ErbB3,
  which can contribute to one of the most potent dimers that can activate c-Met downstream
  pathways leading to acquired resistance in cancer cells
