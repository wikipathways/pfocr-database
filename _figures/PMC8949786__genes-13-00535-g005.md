caption: TGFβ signaling pathway network. Genes included are from the IPA canonical
  pathway, and all of them are in differentially accessible regions (DARs) in weaning.
  Red edges represent significant co-expressed genes (>0.8) using RNA-seq data. The
  TGFβ2 was selected as the hub gene for the network.
