caption: Contribution of glycerolipid/fatty acid cycling (GL/FA) to islet beta-cell
  adaptation to normal pregnancy. Glucose metabolism promotes insulin secretion via
  (A) the K+ATP channel dependent triggering pathway, (B) the production of mitochondrial-derived
  anaplerotic-cataplerotic signaling molecules (eg. via pyruvate (PYR) shuttles),
  and (C) lipid-signaling molecules such as mono- and diacylglycerols (MAG, DAG) generated
  by GL/FA cycling. In late rat pregnancy, greater suppression of FA oxidation by
  glucose, activation of FA esterification processes, and reduced lipolysis to glycerol
  in islets favor build-up of lipid signaling molecules to amplify insulin secretion.
  (FFAR1, free fatty acid receptor 1; Mal-CoA, malonyl-CoA; NEFA, non-esterified fatty
  acid; OAA, oxaloacetate; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PRL-R, prolactin receptor; TCA, tricarboxylic acid).
