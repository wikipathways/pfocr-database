caption: 'The immunoregulatory role of anchored cAMP signaling in T cells. (a) Tumor-infiltrating
  lymphocytes are inhibited by peripherally induced Tregs (orange cells) exposed to
  chronic antigenic stimulation. Persistent infections, such as HIV, lead to chronic
  inflammation and immunosuppression, both of which involve production of PGE2 and
  other inflammatory mediators. (b) Generation of peripherally induced or adaptive
  Tregs. These cells express COX-2, produce PGE2, and stimulate FOXP3 expression.
  In contrast, naturally occurring Tregs can transfer cAMP to responder T cells through
  gap junctions. Pericellular accumulation of adenosine also elicits immunosuppressive
  responses through a pathway whereby CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes metabolize ATP to
  generate adenosine. T cell inhibition and PGE2-responsive induction of FOXP3 can
  occur as a result of the secretion of PGE2 by LPS-activated monocytes. (c) cAMP
  inhibits TCR-mediated immunoregulatory functions at membranes. This occurs in lipid
  rafts through a receptor–G protein–AC–cAMP–PKA type I–Csk pathway that acts on the
  Src family tyrosine kinase Lck. (d) Ezrin links transmembrane receptors such as
  CD43 to the actin cytoskeleton via its N-terminal FERM domain and to F-actin via
  its C terminus. Ezrin functions as an AKAP, bringing type I PKA in proximity to
  its substrate Csk via a supramolecular signaling complex consisting of PKA, ezrin,
  EBP50, Cbp/PAG, and Csk. Abbreviations: AC, adenylyl cyclase; AKAP, A-kinase anchoring
  protein; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; Csk, C-terminal
  Src kinase; EPB50, ERM binding protein 50; EP-R, receptor for E series of prostaglandins;
  FERM, band 4.1 protein and ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) protein domain; Lck,
  lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAG, phosphoprotein
  associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains; PGE2, prostaglandin E2;
  PKA, protein kinase A; TCR, T cell receptor; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
