caption: The proposed model of the effect of candesartan in EAAC1 KO mice. Increased
  oxidative stress in EAAC1 KO mice induces the upregulation of AT1-R and TLR4, resulting
  in increased NO expression via the ASK1 signaling pathway, which leads to RGC death.
  NO further stimulates AT1-R expression levels through a positive feedback loop.
  Candesartan blocks AT1-R and exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing the upregulation
  of TLR4 and thus reducing ASK1-mediated NO production. This also results in inhibition
  of the positive feedback loop between NO and AT1-R
