caption: 'Carbon flux to the cortical root cells during arbuscular–mycorrhizal interactions.
  Photosynthates flow through the mycorrhizal plant from the leaves to the arbusculated
  cortical cells in the roots. The catabolism of Suc in the arbusculated and other
  cortical cells close to them promotes Suc mass flow and enables the translocation
  of hexoses, Suc, and lipids to the periarbuscular space towards the fungal arbuscule,
  imposing a carbon sink (Updated from Wipf et al., 2019; Roth and Paszkowski, 2017;
  and Manck-Götzenberger and Requena, 2016 [,,]). Blue arrows trace the current carbon
  flow routes, the discontinued orange arrows showthe “futile” cycles of sucrose catabolism
  and synthesis, the colored barrels designate the carbohydrate transporters. Enzymes
  are indicated in numbered circles as: (1) Sucrose synthase; (2) Neutral invertase;
  (3) Apoplastic invertase; (4) Vacuolar invertase; (5) Glycerol-3-phosphate acyl
  transferase. Numbers in rounded rectangles denote specific metabolic pathways: (1)
  Suc as a source for aerobic respiration; (2) Glycolytic pathway to render phosphoenolpyruvate;
  (3) lipid synthesis mediated by the plastid Type I FAS molecular complex. Diamonds
  indicate potential carbon fluxes as: (1) symplastic and (2) apoplastic routes of
  hexoses entry to sink cells. Sucrose * indicates the sucrose biosynthesized in the
  arbusculated cell.'
