caption: Model schematic of Nipah virus-triggered DC immune response mechanisms and
  antagonist activity of the response. Detection of Nipah virus by viral sensors leads
  to the induction of the genes for IFNs and TNF-α, together with other genes, such
  as those for CCL4 and CCL5, through two positive-feedback loops mediated through
  the Jak/STAT pathway and NFκB, respectively. Nipah virus encodes antagonist proteins
  P, V, and W, which can effectively suppress the DC immune responses by targeting
  the key mediators in both the induction feedback loops.
