caption: Hormone and nutrient signaling pathways modulating leptin translation. After
  a meal, insulin and other nutrients stimulate leptin production by increasing leptin
  mRNA translation. Insulin stimulates leptin biosynthesis through a small stimulation
  of general protein synthesis and by specifically increasing relative rates of leptin
  biosynthesis. The insulin effects on leptin mRNA translation are signaled through
  the PI 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The mTOR signaling
  network consists of two major branches, each mediated by specific mTOR complexes
  (mTORC1 or mTORC2, not shown). Rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 controls protein synthesis
  via phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [releasing eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4E (eIF-4E) and activating translation] and S6K. Amino acids, especially
  leucine, also increase leptin translation through mTORC1 (). The ATP required for
  translation is provided by the increased supply of glucose and other metabolizable
  substrates. During fasting, insulin and metabolite levels decrease while sympathetic
  system is activated. Catecholamines activate β-adrenergic receptors (AR) signaling
  to decrease relative rates of leptin translation, mainly via cAMP-dependent mechanisms
  that decrease mTORC1 activity (P. Brauner, M.-J. Lee, S. Fried, unpublished observations).
  β-AR agonists also stimulate triglyceride (TG) breakdown, which may increase use
  of ATP for formation of fatty acyl (FA) CoA, leading to increased AMP and the activation
  of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (, ). AMPK activation is known to inhibit
  the mTOR pathway, decreasing general protein synthesis and possibly also relative
  rates of leptin mRNA translation. Thus interplay between AMPK and mTOR pathways
  may link low cellular energy availability during fasting to alterations in leptin
  synthesis. Finally, hormones and nutrients may influence the expression or binding
  of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of
  leptin mRNA level and may regulate translational efficiency and mRNA stability.
