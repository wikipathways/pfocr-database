caption: Mechanism of trans Golgi localisation of the GOLPH3 clients. The current
  and the previous data on the mechanism of action of GOLPH3 lead to the following
  scheme for localisation of GOLPH3 client enzymes in the trans cisternae. GOLPH3
  (light blue) is recruited to the trans cisterna by a PtdIns(4)P (violet rectangle)
  pool generated locally from PtdIns (blue rectangle) by PI4KIIIβ (blue triangle),
  which is in turn recruited and activated there by Arf1 (Godi et al, ). Once on the
  trans cisterna GOLPH3 binds and incorporates LCS into retrograde COPI vesicles,
  and so transfers LCS to the neighbouring medial cisterna. This step is followed
  (or accompanied) by the dissociation‐inactivation of GOLPH3, and by the conversion
  of the medial cisterna into a new trans element while the old trans cisterna disassembles
  into anterograde carriers. GOLPH3 is then recruited again to the new trans cisterna
  by PI4KIIIβ via PtdIns(4)P for another cycle of enzyme retro‐transport. As a result,
  LCS always resides (dynamically) on a trans cisterna. In essence, the localisation
  of LCS and other PI4KIIIβ client enzymes in the trans cisterna depends on the facts
  that a) PI4KIIIβ is recruited to the trans cisterna by a trans Golgi pool of PtdIns(4)P
  formed locally by PI4KIIIβ, and b) GOLPH3 exerts its retro‐transport function within
  the cisternal progression inter‐conversion process.GOLPH3 acts as a rheostat controlling
  the flow of its client enzymes to the lysosomes, and hence their degradation. LCS
  (red bars) and other GOLPH3 client enzymes are synthesised in the ER and degraded
  in the lysosomes (see text). At the steady state, the rates of synthesis and degradation
  are equal. The rate of degradation is controlled by GOLPH3 through its property
  to recycle its client enzymes from the trans (red bars) to the medial cisterna (green
  bars) in the context of the cisternae progression inter‐conversion mechanism. If
  GOLPH3‐dependent recycling rate is insufficient to recycle all LCS molecules before
  disassembly of the trans cisterna, a fraction of the LCS and client enzymes will
  end up in the anterograde carriers and then reach the lysosomes. GOLPH3 therefore
  acts as a rheostat that controls the flow of its client enzymes to the lysosomes.
  As a result, GOLPH3 controls the degradation, and therefore the levels, of its client
  enzymes.The build‐up of GOLPH3 clients directs the GSL pathway towards pro‐growth
  metabolites. The GOLPH3 clients (red) act at branchpoints in the GSL metabolic network.
  The increased LCS drives the synthesis of LacCer (yellow, as all other products
  of GOLPH3 clients, i.e. Gb3, GM3 and GD3) at the expense of GlcCer and Cer, and
  hence, ultimately, of SM (which accounts for 80 % of the SL metabolites in HeLa).
  The increased levels of Gb3S and GM3S drive the conversion of LacCer into Gb3 (and
  downstream globosides) and GM3 (and downstream gangliosides) possibly at the expense
  of the asialo and lacto series. Finally, enhanced GD3S converts GM3 into GD3 at
  the expense of GM2. Notably, these changes do not take place in all cells, as the
  metabolic outcome depends also on the expression patterns of the GSL enzymes. For
  instance, the globo series enzymes are abundant, and the ganglio series enzymes
  scarce, in HeLa cells and PHFs. Thus, the main effect of GOLPH3 overexpression in
  these cells is the increase in Gb3 and in other globo series metabolites. In other
  cell types the ganglio series might predominate, resulting a different, but still
  pro‐growth, metabolic outcome.The increase in pro‐growth GSL metabolites stimulates
  mitogenic signalling and cell growth. Gb3 and other globosides are known to be exposed
  and to act at the PM, where they potentiate growth factor and integrin receptor
  signalling. GD3 and GM3 activate and inhibit, respectively, growth factor receptors.
  The increase in pro‐growth metabolites induces the activation of canonical mitogenic
  kinases such as AKT, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and the downregulation of p21waf, resulting
  in stimulation of cell proliferation. A contributing factor to the growth‐inducing
  effect of GOLPH3 is probably the consumption of Cer (a characterised suppressor
  of tumour growth) by LCS.Schematic representation of (D).
