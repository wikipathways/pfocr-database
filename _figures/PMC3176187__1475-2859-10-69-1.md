caption: Inositol metabolism in B. subtilis. B. subtilis iol genes encoding enzymes
  for reactions in the inositol catabolic pathway and the respective intermediate
  compounds are shown. The intermediate compounds are myo-inositol (compound 1), D-chiro-inositol
  (compound 2), scyllo-inositol I (compound 3), scyllo-inosose (compound 4), 1-keto-D-chiro-inositol
  (compound 5), 3D-(3,5/4)-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione (compound 6), 5-deoxy-D-glucuronic
  acid (compound 7), 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic acid (compound 8), 2-deoxy-5-keto-D-gluconic
  acid 6-phosphate (compound 9), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (compound 10), malonic
  semialdehyde (compound 11), and acetyl-CoA (compound 12).
papertitle: A cell factory of Bacillus subtilis engineered for the simple bioconversion
  of myo-inositol to scyllo-inositol, a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's
  disease.
