caption: 'Increased hepcidin production in response to inflammation (adapted from
  Camaschella et al.()). The current evidence suggests that inflammation influences
  hepcidin expression primarily through the JAK‐STAT pathway. Increased LPS produced
  in the setting of infection or inflammation increases production of IL‐6 in macrophages
  through TLR4 binding. IL‐6 then binds to its receptor on hepatocytes and may bind
  directly to hepatocytes, resulting in activation of the JAK2‐STAT3 signaling pathway
  through phosphorylation of STAT3; phosphorylated STAT3 then enters the nucleus and
  increases hepcidin transcription by binding to the STAT3 responsive element on the
  hepcidin promoter. LPS‐activated myeloid differentiation protein 88 in hepatocytes
  may also increase SMAD signaling through SMAD4. In addition, it has been proposed
  from observations in animals that cross‐talk between BMP and STAT3 may also contribute
  to hepcidin expression. Abbreviations: BRE, BMP responsive element; FPN, ferroportin;
  MYD888, myeloid differentiation protein 88; SRE, STAT3 responsive element.'
