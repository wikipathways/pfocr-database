caption: Molecular mechanisms of exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) in proliferation,
  drug resistance, angiogenesis and metabolism; (A) exosomal circRNAs are involved
  in proliferation. Exosomal circRNAs derived from cancer cells are delivered to normal
  cells to upregulate STIL and FSCN1 and promote cell proliferation (circ‐0000069,
  circSATB2, etc.). Exosomal circRNAs derived from normal cells are delivered to cancer
  cells to upregulate BAK1 and promote apoptosis (e.g., circ‐0051443, etc.) while
  exosomal circRNAs derived from adipocytes are delivered to cancer cells to activate
  the USP7/cyclin A2 pathway and promote proliferation (e.g., circ‐DB, etc.). (B)
  Exosomal circRNAs are involved in drug resistance. Exosomal circRNAs are delivered
  from drug‐resistant cancer cells to sensitive cells to spread drug resistance through
  the circNFIX/miR132 pathway and the interaction between circRNA‐SORE and YBX1 to
  prevent YBX1 nuclear translocation as well as PRP19‐mediated YBX1 ubiquitination
  and degradation. (C) Exosomal circRNAs are involved in angiogenesis. Exosomal circRNAs
  not only signal in cancer cells to regulate vascular endothelial growth factor expression
  and affect angiogenesis (circ‐RanGAP1, circSHKBP1, circFNDC3B, etc.) but are also
  delivered to endothelial cells and affect vasculogenic mimicry formation through
  the interaction between circRNA‐100338 and NOVA2 (which still needs further verification).
  (D) Exosomal circRNAs are involved in metabolism. Exosomal circRNAs are delivered
  between cancer cells, thus activating the AKT/mTOR pathway to promote the Warburg
  effect (e.g., circNRIP1, etc.) and elevating pyruvate kinase M2 isoform to promote
  glycolysis (e.g., ciRS‐122, etc.). Exosomal circRNAs are also delivered from cancer
  cells to preadipocytes to promote white adipose tissue browning (e.g., ciRS‐133,
  etc.)
