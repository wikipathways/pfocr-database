caption: 'Decoupling Energy Production and Carbon Fixation in E. coli to Achieve Hemiautotrophic
  GrowthTwo recombinant enzymes are needed to complete a carbon fixation cycle in
  E. coli: RuBisCO, the carboxylating enzyme, and the kinase prk. The remaining reactions
  required for the reduction and substrate regeneration phases of the cycle are endogenous
  to the metabolic network of the host, as part of gluconeogenesis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Deletion of the phosphoglycerate mutase genes (ΔgpmA and ΔgpmM)
  disrupts carbon flow in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic backbone and generates two
  disconnected sub-networks: (1) a carbon fixation module containing upper glycolysis,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, and the two foreign CBB enzymes and (2) an energy
  module, containing lower glycolysis and the TCA cycle, supplying reducing power
  and ATP. In a scenario in which an organic carbon source (e.g., pyruvate) is utilized
  by the energy module to supply the energetic demands of the carbon fixation cycle,
  the cellular building blocks derived from carbon fixation module metabolites (e.g.,
  phospho sugars, such as ribose-P; see  for details) can be synthesized from inorganic
  carbon using the non-native CBB cycle. The remainder of the biomass building blocks
  (those emanating from the energy module metabolites, e.g., organic acids for many
  of the amino acids), as well as the energy requirements of the cell, are supplied
  directly via the catabolism of the organic carbon source. In such a hemiautotrophic
  growth mode, CO2 and energy carriers are the sole inputs for the production of biomass
  precursors in a carbon fixation cycle.See also , , , and .'
