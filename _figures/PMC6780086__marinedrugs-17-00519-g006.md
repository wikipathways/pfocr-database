caption: Transcriptional profiling of enzymes involved in type II fatty acid synthesis
  (FASII), glycerolipid synthesis in plastid (GLSp) and cytosol glycolysis (GLSc),
  and beta-oxidation. (A) A schematic drawing of the FASII, GLSp, GLSc, and beta-oxidation.
  Metabolites whose level increase or decrease is shown in red and green, respectively.
  Significant (level change > 1.5-fold, p-value < 0.05) and moderate (level change
  > 10%) changes are indicated by fill and border, respectively. Left and right portions
  present the change upon phosphate depletion (PD/PR) and phosphate restoration (PDR/PD),
  respectively. The display is identical to A. (B) Transcriptional response of enzymes
  involved in FASII. The display is identical to B. (C) Transcriptional response of
  enzymes involved in GLSp. The display is identical to B. (D) Transcriptional response
  of enzymes involved in beta-oxidation. The display is identical to B. (E) Transcriptional
  response of enzymes involved in GLSc. The display is identical to B. (F) Level change
  of metabolites involved in the GLSp. It is synthesized through the “prokaryotic”
  pathway. (G) Level change of metabolites involved in the GLSc. It is synthesized
  through the “eukaryotic” pathway.
