caption: Simplified carbon metabolic profile of the producing Escherichia coli strain.
  The heterologous genes gps and crtEBIY were integrated into the E. coli genome at
  the ldhA locus to introduce the β-carotene pathway (Li et al., ). The genetic manipulations
  in this study are shown in colored fonts, where red represents gene deletion and
  blue represents gene overexpression. The multiple arrows represent multiple reactions.
