caption: Apoptotic and necrotic osteocytes promote osteoclastogenesis. Osteocytes
  that undergo apoptosis by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways trigger the
  secretion of pro-osteoclastogenic factors by nearby osteocytes or directly promote
  osteoclastogenesis. Apoptotic osteocytes eventually undergo secondary necrosis.
  Necrotic osteocytes, either derived from apoptotic osteocytes or induced by environmental
  disadvantages, lose the integrity of cell membrane and release the cellular contents
  (i.e. DAMPs), which trigger inflammation and osteoclastogenesis. TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha; casp, caspase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; RANKL, receptor activator
  of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand; IL-6, interleukin 6; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; ICAM-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1; DAMPs, damage associated
  molecule patterns
