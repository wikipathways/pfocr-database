caption: Model for the regulation of cta3+ expression. Under nonstress conditions,
  cta3+ expression is repressed by Tup11 and/or Tup12 that are tethered to the promoter
  through interaction with a site-specific DNA binding protein “X.” Activation of
  the Sty1 pathway alone is insufficient to induce expression, and the Tup repressors
  prevent activation by Atf1-Pcr1 and Prr1. Elevated Ca2+ or K+ concentrations trigger
  the activity of other pathways (indicated by dashed lines) that interfere with Tup
  repression and/or facilitate activation via the response regulator Prr1 and Atf1-Pcr1.
  In cells lacking the Tup repressors, specificity is lost and expression is induced
  in response to a range of stresses.
