caption: GenMAPP growth hormone (Gh) signaling pathway. Genes known to be or potentially
  involved in Gh signaling were mined from primary literature, reviews and book chapters.
  Genes are organized broadly based on functionality. MMU genomic position for each
  gene is to the right of each symbol and genes located on MMU2, 9, 11 and 17 are
  highlighted in yellow, purple, orange and green, respectively. Genes located on
  MMUX are labeled in white. Forty-four of the genes overlapping QTL intervals were
  selected for sequencing in the CAST strain.
