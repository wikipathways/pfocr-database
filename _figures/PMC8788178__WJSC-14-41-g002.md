caption: 'Transforming growth factor-β/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 and
  bone morphogenetic protein/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog signaling pathways.
  Activated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) ligands or bone morphogenetic protein
  ligands bind to type II receptor (TβRII) on the cell membrane and recruit type I
  receptors (TβRI), forming receptor complexes (TβRI and TβRII). Phosphorylated receptor
  complexes phosphorylate mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2/3 and Smad1/5/8
  (R-Smads). Smad4 (Co-Smad) binds with R-Smads to form two different complexes (Smad4/Smad2/3
  and Smad4/Smad1/5/8). The heteromeric complexes are translocated to the nucleus,
  where they regulate the expression of specific genes. Smad6 and Smad7 (I-Smads),
  which are typically located in the nucleus, can enter the cytoplasm upon activation
  and regulate the transcriptional activity of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Smad6
  mainly competes with R-Smads for binding Smad4 to inhibit transcriptional activity,
  while Smad7 inhibits transcriptional activity mostly by preventing the phosphorylation
  of R-Smads. BMP: Bone morphogenetic protein; TFs: Transcription factors; Smad1-8:
