caption: Mechanisms of BC-derived CAV1 promoting BC lung metastasis. CAV1 in BC cells
  promotes integrin α6β4 expression through activation of the Src/FAK pathway, which
  supports internalization of BC-derived sEVs by lung epithelial cells to enhance
  lung metastasis, while CAV1 on sEVs promotes neutrophil recruitment in the lung
  through activation of the TLR4-NF-κB -IL-6/CCL2, and drives N2-type polarization
  of neutrophils through activation of the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, and
  furthermore, CAV1 on sEVs facilitates lung angiogenesis. The figure is created by
