caption: Crosstalk of bone cells within bone marrow regulates bone remodeling, adipogenesis,
  hematopoiesis, and angiogenesis. Bone cells interact with multiple bone marrow cells,
  including HSCs, MSCs, adipocytes, T cells, erythroid precursors, and CD31hiendomucin
  (Emcn)hi endothelial cells of H-type vessels. Osteocytes and osteoblasts communicate
  with osteoclasts by secreting Rankl, which acts on the Rank receptor that interacts
  with two ITAM-containing immune receptors, DNAX-activating protein of 12 kD (Dap12)
  and Fc receptor γ subunit (Fcrγ), as well as with Lgr4, a negative regulator. Osteoclasts
  are also controlled both directly and via the osteoblast by multiple pro-osteoclastic
  and antiosteoclastic cytokines, prominently Tnfα, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, and Ifnγ.
  White adipocytes, prominently seen in hypogonadal states, are MSC derived and secrete
  adipokines, notably adiponectin, which interacts with osteoblastic receptors. Adipocytes
  also secrete leptin (Lep), which not only interacts with adipocyte and osteoblast
  leptin receptors (Leprs) but also crosses the blood-brain barrier to regulate the
  hypothalamic relay of sympathetic signaling to bone. In addition to osteoblastic
  suppression exerted through Adrb2, sympathetic nerves innervating MSCs regulate
  the HSC niché and hematopoiesis via C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (Cxcl2) release
  that primarily causes HSC egress. Through the activation of a hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1a (Hif1a) pathway in response to hypoxia, MSCs also produce erythropoietin
  (Epo) to cause erythrocytosis but also, through notch and NOG, to regulate angiogenesis.
