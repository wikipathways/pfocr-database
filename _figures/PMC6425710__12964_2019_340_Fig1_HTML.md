caption: Pericytes contribute in homeostasis of the BBB through different mechanisms.
  TGF-β signaling inside pericytes supports the BBB integrity by enhancing fibronectin
  production, basal membrane formation and stimulating tight junctions expression.
  TGF-β signaling also participates in capillary-like structures formation. Along
  with TGF-β signaling, pericytes derived Ang-1 enhances occludin up-regulation inside
  ECs which stabilize BBB integrity. Mutually, ECs support adjacent pericytes by improving
  pericyte-EC integration by up-regulating N-cadherin and the prevention of pericytes
  migration. Two mechanisms have been suggested for ECs supporting role. First, TGF-β
  and BMP signaling pathways play enhancing role on N-cadherin up-regulation inside
  ECs through Smad4. The second mechanism is related to the stimulatory effect of
  VEGF in the expression of DLL4 inside ECs and attaching to receptor Notch3 on pericytes
  surface, triggering Notch signaling, N-cadherin up-regulation inside pericytes.
  Various mechanisms have been identified for the induction of pericytes proliferation
  and migration. During hyperglycemia or hypoxia, an elevated Ang-2 level activates
  cognate receptor Tie-2 which induces pericytes migratory activity by detaching cells
  from the ECM. The inductive mechanism for Ang-2 elevation in hypoxia occurs via
  pericytes HIF-1α and subsequent VEGF signaling. Also, the promotion of HIF-1α, VEGF,
  and Nox4 signaling after hypoxia enhances pericytes proliferative activity. In response
  to hypoxia, pericytes support neuronal survival with astrocytes collaboration. After
  hypoxia, pericytes NT-3 releasing activates astrocytes TrkC receptors in which upregulates
  NGF through ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Pericytes plays a major role in diabetic pathology
  and other hyperglycemic conditions. In these circumstances, pericytes respond to
  accumulated AGEs through various mechanisms. ANG-2-related activation of ANG type
  1 receptor inside retina and AGEs stimulated TGF-β autocrine signaling inside pericytes,
  leading to basal membrane hypertrophy through increased production of fibronectin.
  The postulated mechanism for diabetic retinopathy via AGEs receptors occurs by activating
  downstream Src-Erk1/2-FAK-1-Paxillin signaling pathway which leads to diabetic retinopathy
  and pericytes migration. Also, HIV and ANG-2 cause pericytes migration and diabetic
  retinopathy through PDGF-BB autocrine signaling. Inside ECs claudin 5 down-regulation
  via VEGF and MMP-2 elevation leads to BBB disruption. Different types of CNS diseases
  such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s
  disease weaken BBB integrity through activating pericytes. By thrombin elevation
  in CNS diseases, PAR1 activation results in MMP-9 secretion and subsequent ECM degradation
  through downstream PKCδ-ERK1/2 and PKCθ-Akt signaling pathways. In addition, there
  are other mechanisms for MMP-9 release and ECM degradation after ischemic stroke
  related to increased TNF-α content and up-regulation MMP-9 inside pericytes through
  MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. VEGF production inside pericytes happens and
  subsequent BBB disruption occurs through decreasing claudin 5 expression. In spite
  of these disruptive mechanisms of pericytes in response to ischemic stroke, pericytes
  behavior complexity stigmatizes its role by exerting CNS homeostasis, neuroprotective
  and angiogenic activity after ischemic stroke. The hypoxia-induced FGFR1 up-regulation
  and tissue acidification promotes bFGF autocrine signaling inside pericytes following
  ischemic stroke which intensifies PDGFRB up-regulation. PDGFRB signaling activation
  supports CNS homeostasis, neuroprotection, and angiogenesis through releasing growth
  factors microvesicles and generating fibrotic scar. TSP1 reinforces PDGFRB signaling
  aiming to pericytes proliferation and migration
