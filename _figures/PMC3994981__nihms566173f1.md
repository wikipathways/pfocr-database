caption: 'This diagram shows a highly simplified scheme of the signaling pathway leading
  from PI3K to AKT to mTOR. The four isoforms of class I PI3K are shown in dark gray
  boxes. Blue italics illustrate cancer cell-intrinsic functions of isoforms: p110α
  is a frequent genetic driver (PIK3CA mutations); basal activity of p110β is implicated
  in tumors with PTEN loss; p110δ has a fundamental role in survival of normal B cells
  and malignancies of this lineage. PI3K and mTOR drive tumor metastasis by promoting
  cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Purple arrows represent
  cell extrinsic functions of various components in the network. p110α drives angiogenesis.
  p110γ, p110δ and p110β have important functions in inflammatory cells. p110δ and
  mTOR control key aspects of adaptive immunity including lymphocyte activation, differentiation
  and tolerance. Drugs in clinical development that target nodes in this network are
  listed in .'
