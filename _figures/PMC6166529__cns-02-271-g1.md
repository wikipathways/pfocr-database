caption: Primary sequence alterations and significant copy number changes for components
  of the (A) RTK/RAS/PI3K, (B) P53 and (C) Rb signaling pathways are shown. Red indicates
  activating genetic alterations, with frequently altered genes showing deeper shades
  of red. Conversely, blue indicates inactivating alterations, with darker shades
  of blue corresponding to a higher percentage of alteration. For each altered component
  of a particular pathway, the nature of the alteration and the percentage of tumors
  affected are indicated. Boxes contain the final percentages of glioblastoma multiformes
  with alterations in at least one known component gene of the designated pathway.Reprinted
