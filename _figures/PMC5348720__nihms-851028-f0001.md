caption: Following infection, replicating coxsackievirus subtype B (CVB) produce cytosolic
  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a nonphysiological form of mRNA recognized by the cytoplasmic
  receptor MDA5. Binding of MDA5 to the dsRNA activates the transcription factors
  NF-κB, IRFs and STATs, triggering production of type I interferons and chemokines,
  thus contributing to local inflammation (insulitis). Type I interferons (IFN-α and
  IFN-β), type II interferon (IFN-γ) and the cytokines TNF and IL-1β contribute to
  β-cell destruction among genetically susceptible individuals. Type I interferons
  bound to the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) signal via TYK2 and JAK1 and induce activation
  of STATs and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties.
  Proinflammatory cytokines promote the activation of JNK1, which induces the intrinsic
  (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway through the proapoptotic protein BIM and its phosphorylated
  form (P-BIM). PTPN2 modulates β-cell death induced by interferons by regulating
  activation of P-BIM via JNK1. BIM and/or JNK1 are downregulated by BACH2, GLIS3
  and CTSH. PTPN2 also functions as a negative regulator of the STAT signalling pathway,
  whereas USP18 exerts negative feedback on interferon-induced STAT signalling and
  mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in β cells. Candidate-gene regulated factors implicated
  in type 1 diabetes mellitus are framed in red and the consequences of their modulated
  expression and/or activity on biological function or type 1 diabetes mellitus risk
  indicated. Kinases and phosphatases are indicated by green ovals and transcription
  factors by grey ovals.
