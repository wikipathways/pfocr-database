caption: Potential protective role of O-GlcNAcylation within the healthy brain, which
  may become deficient in the AD brain. Impairments in glucose utilization (perhaps
  by decreased cell-surface glucose transporters) as shown here would result in decreased
  flux down the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBSP) and ultimately lead to decreased
  O-GlcNAc on tau, APP, and nicastrin (a non-catalytic component of the γ-secretase
  complex), which could result in the increased production of NFTs and amyloid plaques,
  the hallmark features of the AD brain. This figure is adapted from Ref. .
