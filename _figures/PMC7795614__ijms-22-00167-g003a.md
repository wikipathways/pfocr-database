  to oxidants at 3 min by (A) H2O2 and (B) CHP. Regulation of the canonical Ran signaling
  pathway in S. cerevisiae response to oxidants at 3 min by (C) menadione and (D)
  diamide. Networks were constructed using IPA® based on global untargeted proteomics
  analysis using label-free quantification relying on precursor ions of tryptic peptides
  based on high-resolution (Orbitrap) mass spectrometry. Regulation of the pathways
  and individual components are indicated by color: green for protein downregulation,
  red for protein upregulation, blue for pathway inhibition, and orange for pathway
  activation.'
