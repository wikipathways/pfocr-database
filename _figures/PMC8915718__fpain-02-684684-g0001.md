caption: Schematic illustrating neuron-to-glia interaction through the CatS/FKN/CX3CR1pathway
  in the spinal cord dorsal horn. ATP released by damaged primary afferents and dorsal
  horn neurons (A) lead to the activation of P2X7 receptors. The activation of these
  receptors phosphorylates p38 MAPK signalling pathway and phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)
  (B) resulting in the release of CatS (C). CatS cleaves FKN present in the membrane
  of the spinal cord dorsal horn neuron (D). The soluble form of FKN interacts with
  the CX3CR1 receptor located in microglia (E) that phosphorylates p38 MAPK, induces
  the release of proinflammatory mediators (F) that may sensitise spinal cord dorsal
  neurons and contribute to the development of central sensitisation and neuropathic
  pain. Mediating the expression of mir-184 inhibits the activation of CX3CR1(G) consequently
  reducing the release of proinflammatory mediators and microglial activation. On
  the other hand, upregulating mir-187-3p (H) through the administration of its mimic,
  downregulates P2X7 expression, potentially disrupting the liberation of CatS. This
