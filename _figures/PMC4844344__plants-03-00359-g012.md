caption: SIG5 expression control in the light-signaling pathway regulating the expression
  of the chloroplast genes psbD and psbA for the photoreaction center II core proteins
  D1 and D2 in response to light intensity and quality. Light signals regulate SIG5
  expression by photoreceptors in a HY5- and COP1-controlled manner via various promoter
  elements. SIG5 is post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts, where the sigma
  factor is involved in tuning expression of psbD and psbA. Photoreaction center expression
  is involved in the PSII repair cycle. Retrograde signals transmit information correlating
  with the photosystem II excitation status and damage, respectively, to the nucleus
  to adjust the intensity of SIG5 transcription.
