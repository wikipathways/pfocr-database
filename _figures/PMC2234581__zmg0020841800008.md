caption: Working Model for Multifunctional Proteins PHB and REAPHB and REA are able
  to interact with each other to form hetero-oligomers. There is equilibrium between
  homomer and heteromer forms of PHB and REA. We propose that, only when they are
  not paired, PHB and REA can function as transcriptional regulators for a variety
  of transcriptional factors, including ERα (), E2F1 (), PR-B, and AR (). On the other
  hand, the hetero-oligomers of PHB and REA exert other functions, such as mitochondrial
  chaperones () and B-cell receptor-associated proteins (). Moreover, it has been
  reported that PHB acts as a vascular marker of adipose tissue (), inhibitor of pyruvate
  carboxylase (), propigmentation effector (), and plays critical role in Ras signaling
  pathway (). It remains unknown whether REA is also involved in these biological
  processes as PHB partner.
