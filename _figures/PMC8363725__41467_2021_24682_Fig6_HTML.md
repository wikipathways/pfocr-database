caption: 'The methylated intermediate 3 is activated by PKAL-1 as the adenylate and
  loaded onto the ACP7 domain of NRPS-1 in order to biosynthesize nemamide A, 1. An
  analogous pathway biosynthesizes nemamide B, 2. Our data suggest that PKS-1 produces
  and releases 7, which is then methylated by NEMT-1 to generate 3. However, it is
  also possible that NEMT-1 acts earlier in the pathway on a polyketide intermediate
  attached to PKS-1, such that PKS-1 produces and releases 3, not 7 (see “Discussion”).
  Domain abbreviations: acyl carrier protein (ACP), peptidyl carrier protein (PCP),
  adenylation (A), condensation (C), and thioesterase (TE).'
