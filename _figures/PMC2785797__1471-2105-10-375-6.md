caption: Handling of convex and rectangular clusters allows network hierarchy to be
  emphasized. (a) shows an example a metabolic pathway (showing chemical reactions
  occurring within a cell, in this example a part of the Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis
  pathway is used) with compartments manually drawn (manual layout derived from the
  MetaCrop database []), (b) shows the same network drawn automatically.
