caption: 'Among enzyme inhibitors  used in agriculture, glyphosate (N-phosphomethyl
  glycine) is  remarkable. A nonselective herbicide discovered in 1970 by a group
  of  scientists at Monsanto led by Dr. John Franz (), glyphosate, since  first commercialization
  under the trade name Roundup, has been used  globally as a safe and effective means
  of weed control. The discovery  of glyphosate''s herbicidal activity was not quite
  serendipity, but  instead resulted from a synthetic strategy based on the hypothesis
  that  the weak herbicidal activities of related compounds derived from the  possibility
  of their similar metabolic fate (). Nevertheless, the  initial discovery by greenhouse
  screening has been followed by  intensive biochemical studies that have now led
  to nearly complete  understanding of glyphosate''s mode of action. In 1972, scientists
  at  Monsanto led by Dr. E. Jaworski observed () that application of  glyphosate
  resulted in the inhibition of aromatic amino acid  biosynthesis in plants. In 1980,
  Professor N. Amrhein and coworkers ()  identified its target enzyme from the shikimate
  pathway ():  5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS; EC  2.5.1.19).
  EPSPS is a key enzyme involved in aromatic amino acid  biosynthesis (). The enzyme
  catalyzes an unusual reaction, wherein the  enolpyruvoyl group from phosphoenol
  pyruvate (PEP) is transferred to  the 5-hydroxyl of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P)
  to form the products  5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) and inorganic  phosphate
  (Pi). The only other enzyme known to catalyze carboxyvinyl  transfer by using PEP
  is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl  transferase (MurA), which catalyzes the
  first committed step in the  biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial
  cell. In the  case of EPSPS, the reaction proceeds through a tetrahedral intermediate  (Scheme
  ) formed from S3P and PEP (). Inhibition  of EPSPS by glyphosate has been shown
  to proceed through the  formation of an EPSPS-S3P-glyphosate ternary complex and
  the  binding is ordered with glyphosate binding to the enzyme only after the  formation
  of a binary EPSPS-S3P complex. Binding of glyphosate to EPSPS  has been shown to
  be competitive with PEP and uncompetitive with  respect to S3P (). What makes glyphosate
  a remarkable inhibitor  and herbicide? Glyphosate is a relatively simple molecule—an  N-methyl
  phosphonate derivative of glycine with a chemical  structure not unlike that of
  the universal high energy  phosphoryl-transfer agent PEP. Despite this, glyphosate
  retains  exquisite specificity for EPSPS and is not known to appreciatively  inhibit
  any other enzyme, even MurA ().'
