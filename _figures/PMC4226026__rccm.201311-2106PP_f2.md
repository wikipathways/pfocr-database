caption: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) drives matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion
  by direct effects and intercellular networks. Secretion of MMP is regulated at multiple
  signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and PI3-kinase/Akt
  pathway, and transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-κB and AP-1. Doxycycline,
  Ro32-3555, dexamethasone, and P-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) act at indicated levels
  to inhibit MMP secretion. SRE = steroid response element.
