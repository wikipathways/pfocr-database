caption: (A) Example module (L1) more densely connected in ER- group with red nodes
  indicate genes belonging to the immune response pathway. (B) Example module (H7)
  more densely connected in ER+ group with red nodes indicate genes belonging to the
  complement cascade pathway. Nodes represent genes and links between them represents
  co-expression relationship. Each column corresponds to one independent study. (C)
  Visualization of immune response pathway supermodule. (D) Visualization of complement
  cascades pathway supermodules. The edge color represents the direction of differential
  gene co-expression, in which positive values (red color) represent ER-positive-favored
  co-expression and negative values (green color) show ER-negative-favored co-expression.
  Node color represents its origin of sub-modules, and the genes annotated in the
  immune response pathway are highlighted with dark circles. Edge width represents
  edge weight (Z score of differential co-expression) (Color version of this figure
  is available at Bioinformatics online.)
