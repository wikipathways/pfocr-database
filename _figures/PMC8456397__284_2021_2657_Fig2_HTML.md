caption: 'IFN signaling pathway in alarmed innate immunity and its evasion by SARS-COV-2
  virus. The virus generally invades permissible cells via ACE2 receptors causing
  infection. The viral RNA after being recognized by TLR3 or MDA5/RIG1, triggers signaling
  pathways engaging TRAF3, TBK1, IKɛK which phosphorylates and activates IRFs and
  NF-κB leading to stimulation of the type I IFN. Sensitization of IFNAR by IFN upregulates
  the expression of ISGs and proteins that potentially contribute in anti-viral functions.
  However, various structural and non-structural SARS-COV-2 proteins along with accessory
  proteins have been identified that manipulate the IFN signaling and cause multi-pronged
  inhibition which suppresses IFN signaling increasing viral replication and severity.
