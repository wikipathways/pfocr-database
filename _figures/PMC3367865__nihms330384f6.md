caption: Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog (Hh) are stem cell self-renewal pathways that are
  often deregulated and aberrantly activated in lung cancer, thus representing key
  therapeutic targets. The hedgehog pathway signals through Hh ligands binding to
  the Patched (PTCH) receptor and inhibiting its repression of Smoothened (SMO), allowing
  SMO activation which results in nuclear translocation of GLI transcription factors.
  Wnt signaling functions through Wnt ligands binding to the Frizzled (FZD) receptor
  and signaling through disheveled (DSH) leading to the stabilization of β-catenin.
  In the absence of Hh or Wnt ligands, GSK3 phosphorylates GLI1/2 and β-catenin, respectively,
  resulting in ubiquitination and degradation. Notch signaling functions through Notch
  ligands (DLL and JAG) binding to the Notch receptor which results in the cleavage
  of Notch intracellular binding domain (NICD) by γ-secretase enabling it to translocate
  to the nucleus, bind to CLS transcription factors and activate transcription. Some
  components of the pathways were omitted (dashed lines) for simplicity. Adapted from,.
