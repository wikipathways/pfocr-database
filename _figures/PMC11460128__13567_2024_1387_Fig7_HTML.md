caption: 'Schematic representation of the sialic acid catabolic pathway in the Gram-negative
  bacteria and the comparative transcriptome analysis in ZJ1208 and its derivedwzamutant,
  Δwza. The metabolic pathway of sialic acid is shown in the solid line box, and the
  DEGs associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis are displayed in the dashed line
  box. Enzymes used in each reaction are shown along with the solid arrow, and the
  number in each bracket indicates the fold of gene expression change represented
  as log2FoldChange (Δwza/ZJ1208). Significantly up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs
  are highlighted as red and green solid arrows respectively. Dashed arrows indicate
  the downstream metabolism pathway. The chemical structures are drawn using KingDraw.
  NanA: N-acetylneuraminate lyase; NanK: N-acylmannosamine kinase; NanE: N-acylglucosamine-6-phosphate
  2-epimerase; NagA: N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase; NagB: glucosamine-6-phosphate
  deaminase; GlmM: phosphoglucosamine mutase. GlmU, a bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  pyrophosphorylase, has been shown to be bifunctional and also to possess the activity
  of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase'
