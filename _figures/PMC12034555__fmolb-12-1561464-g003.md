caption: EVs derived from TNBC cells line can transfer various biomolecules to recipient
  cells, thereby modulated their biological functions. 1. EVs carrying EGFR contribute
  to drug resistance in recipient cells. ANXA6-containing EVs inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway, leading to EGFR-mediated tumour growth and proliferation. 2. EVs secreted
  by SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cell lines transport bioactive molecules such as TGF-beta,
  PD-L1, lncRNA AGAP2 and SNHG14, which promote tumour growth and resistance to trastuzumab.
  3. miR-770 derived from THP1 cells enhances apoptosis and counteracts drug resistance.
  VEGF-derived siRNA and let-7 miRNA target AS1411, which inhibits nucleolin proteins,
  thereby increasing drug sensitivity. Let-7a miRNA, when loaded into EVs and introduced
  into TNBC HCC70 cells, was tested in Rag2−/− mice resulting Let-7a miRNA suppresses
  tumor growth by blocking the EGFR signaling pathway. 4. EVs from Hs578Ts cells carrying
  miR-134 reduce metastasis by inhibiting HSP90 activity, increase sensitivity to
  cisplatin, vincristine, and 5-fluorouracil, and inhibit tumor cell proliferation
