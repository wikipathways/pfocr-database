caption: 'Comparison of the Colony-live system with the conventional method. SKO mutants
  in the Keio collection showing growth defects were statistically identified. Growth
  values were determined by either the conventional method (CONV) or MGR-mass* value
  of Colony-live system. (A) Observed growth defects of SKO mutants in each subset
  were confirmed by referring to cited literature or through additional experiments.
  (B) SKO mutants displaying significantly slow growth (yellow) that are disrupted
  in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway are shown. Genes with an asterisk (such as
  CysK*) indicate SKO mutants showing normal MGR but low SPG (see Figure ). Metabolic
  reaction (solid lines), functional unit (boxes), and inner membrane (grey boxes)
  are shown. OAS: O-acetylserine.'
