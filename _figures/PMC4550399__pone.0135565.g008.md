caption: Schemes represent a global gene expression response (A) immediately after
  irradiation; (B) after 2H and 5H of recovery period. Blue colour, stand for down-regulated
  genes. Red colour stand for up-regulated genes, Green colour stand for restored
  expression of the initial silenced genes. (A) The largest changes in transcription
  occurred upon irradiation, as part of a kind of an “Emergency Response”. Cells displayed
  a reduced transcription for photosynthesis and energy production (PSII, PSI, ATP),
  and for carbon and nitrogen metabolism during irradiation. The CO2 fixation via
  the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB), glycogen biosynthesis (gluconeogenesis) and
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were repressed. The transcription of the SigE
  regulator acting as nitrogen-dependent activator for catabolic genes towards glycogen
  degradation (glycolysis) was induced. Also a re-routing of the metabolic flux to
  glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was seen. A synthesis of carbon
  storage molecules (PHA) and compatible solutes (trehalose) was seen. The expression
  of polyamine import (potBC), well known as a group of nitrogen-containing C-compounds
  which help in cell survival during stress, was recorded. The import of nitrate or
  cyanate as N-sources was repressed (nrtABCD, cynBD). In parallel also the metabolism
  of agmatine, a known competitive inhibitor of polyamine transport, was repressed.
  The cellular protection, detoxification, and repair were enhanced immediately after
  irradiation. In an effort to maintain the intracellular redox balance while provide
  sufficient metal-cofactors for enzymes, selective metal export (copA) and import
  (feoAB, cutA, corA, mtgC, cbiQ1, cbiQ2, znuA) was induced. There was upregulation
  of isiA gene encoding the CP43’ protein, which is an auxiliary antenna complex,
  to compensate for the loss of phycobilisomes. This protein may also serve as a chlorophyll
  storage molecule contributing to the reassembly of reaction centres during recovery.
  In addition, ROS detoxification was activated via the expression of the peroxiredoxine
  enzyme (ahpC) and the glutathione synthesis genes. The generation of glutathione
  starts at T0H via the formation of glutamate from proline by hyuA, from aspartate
  by aspartate aminotransferase (aat1), from 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by (putA),
  and from 2-oxoglutarate via GLDH (see Fig 8B). Glutamate synthesis via the GS/GOGAT
  cycle was repressed. The final synthesis of glutathione from glutamate occurred
  via glutathione (GSH) synthase (gshB), which continued during recovery (see Fig
  8B). Chaperones (dnaK1, dnaK2, hspA, cbpA) and proteases (clpB2) were also significantly
  induced during this stage, to remove damaged proteins. The free amino-acids released
  from protein degradation, likely lead to the production of urea, and the urease
  (ureABC) activity, transforming urea to ammonium, was induced. In parallel Arthrospira
  enhance some genes related to DNA repair system (uvrBCD for nucleotide excision
  and repair, ruvB resolving holiday junction, and recJ, dnaG and mod genes). The
  DNA-repair mechanism of Arthrospira included also enzymatic restriction modification
  (hsdr) and endonucleases. (B) During the later phase Arthrospira cells try to recover
  from the damage; which lead to a slowly restored expression of the genes related
  to photosynthesis and energy production, carbon fixation via the CBBn cycle and
  gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle. Expression of the hydrogenase genes (hypA1, hypB1and
  hoxW). Metal chaperone proteins HypA and HypB are required for the nickel insertion
  step of [NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation. In parallel slight reactivation of amino-acid
  transport (aapJPQ, argGHJ, iaaA) occurred. The genes for import of taurine (tauABC)
  known as organic sulphur and amino source were highly induced. The restoration of
  agmatinase, the key enzyme of agmatine hydrolysis was seen in recovery period. ROS
  detoxification was maintained efficiently via the expression for glutathione biosynthesis
  (GSH). Few genes related to protein damage clean up (proteases and chaperones) and
  DNA repair maintained their expression during recovery. The expression of gene cluster
  arhABCDEF, enriched during recovery, was seen.
