caption: 'Model of X4-gp120 activated signaling pathways involved in the activation
  of TNF-α and IL-10 gene expression. Two important points can be highlighted from
  this model: First, the key receptor, which remains to be defined, involved in the
  induction of TNF-α and IL-10 gene expression is different from CD4, CXCR4 and MR.
  Second, X4-gp120 continues to signal through these historical receptors to activate
  specific or amplify common pathways with the yet undefined receptor to activate
  or enhance the production of these two immune-regulatory cytokines: TNF-α and IL-10.
  The crucial pathways controlling 100% of TNF-α or IL-10 production are depicted
  by the symbol .'
