caption: Overall regulatory networks of miRNAs, circRNAs and mRNAs. (a) CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA
  interactions are potentially associated with the pathological process of AIS. ceRNA
  network prediction tools showed that some significant circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pairs may
  be involved in AIS associated with apoptotic pathways; these molecules included
  hsa_circ_0005548, hsa_circ_0000607 and hsa_circ_0020028, 101 miRNAs, and five mRNAs
  (Bax, Bcl2, Bcl2l2, BID, and Casp3). In the figure, blue circles represent miRNAs,
  red diamonds represent circRNAs and green rectangles represent mRNAs. (b) The possible
  binding miRNAs and mRNAs in hsa_circ_0000607-related AIS. One direct target of miR-337-3p
  was Bcl2, and hsa_circ_0000607 may potentially bind to hsa-miR-337-3p. Pathway analysis
  based on the hsa_circ_0000607/hs-miR-337-3p/Bcl2 network. The bioinformatic prediction
  of hsa_circ_0000607 target genes associated with AIS and apoptosis pathways and
  the miRNA-targeted mRNAs were predicted via TargetScan, miRanda and starBase.
