caption: The mechanism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in promoting intestinal health
  in weaned piglets. The inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the activation
  of GPRs are the key pathways for SCFA to regulate immune responses. The activation
  of GPR43 and GPR109A by SCFA not only promotes the secretion of IL-18, antimicrobial
  peptides and MUC in intestinal epithelial cells, but also promotes the chemotaxis
  of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory properties of colonic macrophages and dendritic
  cells, thereby regulating the production of IL-10. SCFA also inhibits the activation
  of NF-κB by inhibiting HDAC and up-regulating the expression of GPR41, thereby reducing
  the concentration of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α.
  In addition, after the inhibition of HDAC is induced by butyrate, histone acetylation
  at the Foxp3+ site is enhanced, which promotes the differentiation of T cells into
  Te cells and TReg cells. In terms of the mucosal barrier, sodium butyrate activates
  the Ca2+/CaMKKβ pathway by regulating SOCE, thereby activating AMPK, leading to
  a more stable tight junction of ZO-1 on the cell membrane to improve the structure
  and function of the intestinal epithelium. Additionally, butyrate entering the mitochondria
  reduces the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by inhibiting HDAC. At
  this time, colon cells cannot convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA through β-oxidation,
  resulting in inhibition of oxidative respiration. This process helps maintain the
  stability of HIF-1α, thereby promoting the secretion of MUC2 and increasing the
  thickness of the mucus layer. SCFA also maintains intestinal health by inhibiting
  pathogens. Bacteria need to consume huge amounts of energy to initiate H+-ATPase
  to pump out the excess H+ produced by SCFA dissociation, which will lead to bacterial
  metabolic disorders and increase osmotic pressure in cells. The interaction of undissociated
  SCFA with phospholipids and lipoproteins in the cell membrane also destroys the
  stability of the bacterial cell membrane. SCFA can also change the intracellular
  protein and DNA synthesis to inhibit bacterial growth and metabolism. In addition,
  the acidic environment produced by SCFA is conducive to the reproduction of beneficial
  bacteria, thereby inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms. GPR = G protein-coupled
