caption: Neisseria utilize the PlsX/PlsY pathway for the synthesis of phosphatidic
  acid. Acyl-ACP is converted into acyl-phosphate by the acyl-ACP:phosphate transacylase
  PlsX. The G3P acyltransferase PlsY utilizes the acyl-phosphate to acylate G3P in
  the first acylation step of phosphatidic acid synthesis. The acyltransferase PlsC
  acylates the resulting lysophosphatidic acid using acyl-ACP in the second step to
  generate phosphatidic acid. Exogenous fatty acids are introduced into phosphatidic
  acid synthesis via conversion into acyl-ACP by the acyl-ACP synthetase in Neisseria.
  The resulting acyl-ACP undergoes the same fate as endogenously synthesized acyl-ACP.
  Lipopolysaccharides are not essential in Neisseria, and the major acyl chains found
  in Neisseria are 16:0 and 16:1 fatty acids. However, 16:0 and 16:1 fatty acid complementation
  cannot bypass the inhibition of endogenous fatty acid synthesis. It is unclear why
  this is the case.
