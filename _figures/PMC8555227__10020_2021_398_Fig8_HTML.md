caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which the phosphorylation
  of IKK and CYLD mediated the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, thereby inducing
  oxidative stress in human kidney cells. The imbalance between the increase in ROS
  and/or the decrease in antioxidant activity promotes oxidative stress injury to
  tissues or cells. Regulation of mitochondrial production of ROS is required for
  the proper adaptation of renal cells to metabolic stress. The phosphorylation of
  IKK induced phosphorylation of CYLD results in the inactivation of its deubiquitination
  activity and is thus unable to prevent the ubiquitination of Nrf2, which promoted
  the production of ROS and the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential
  and ultimately facilitated oxidative stress injury in vitro, which is conducive
  to the development of ORN
