caption: 'Cancer cells take advantage and manipulate the ROS-Ca2+ interplay in two
  ways: 1) by inhibiting large ROS-Ca2+ surges that mediate apoptosis (red pathway).
  Inhibition of Ca2+ ER-mitochondrial transfer by inhibition of receptors and channels
  such as IP3R and VDAC and subsequent suppression of mitochondrial ROS production
  are pathways by which cancer cells can evade apoptosis (); and 2) by promoting pro-tumorigenic
  signaling pathways in response to sublethal changes in ROS/Ca2+ levels. Alterations
  in ROS and Ca2+ levels are often consequences of signaling from Growth factors and
  cytokines, oncogene expression, and changes in the Tumor microenvironment (TME),
  including presence of tumor associated fibroblast and macrophages, hypoxia and nutrient
  stress. ROS are able to directly oxidize or indirectly manipulate activity of Ca2+
  channels, pumps and regulators, including plasma membrane and ER and mitochondria
  localized channels (), while Ca2+ signals are known modulators of several ROS generating
  systems including NADPH oxidases (Nox), NO synthase (NOS) and the mitochondria ().
  In this review we will highlight examples of this crosstalk and how this may relate
  to pro-tumorigenic signaling. Question marks indicate Ca2+ regulators that have
  been implicated in driving cellular responses in a ROS dependent manner in other
  cell models, besides cancer.'
