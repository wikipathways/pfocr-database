caption: a | Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secreted by either cancer-associated
  fibroblasts or tumour cells has tumour-promoting effects predominantly through the
  establishment of T helper 2 (TH2)-type inflammation in the tumour microenvironment,
  mostly through dendritic cell (DC) activation. TH2 cells and eosinophils promote
  angiogenesis through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  and IL-8. b | TH2 cell-independent mechanisms of TSLP in cancer rely on TSLP-induced
  signalling in TSLP receptor (TSLPR)-expressing tumour cells or B cell precursors.
  TSLP signalling in cancer cells can inhibit apoptosis, leading to tumour progression.
  Regulatory B cells induced by TSLPR signalling impair antitumour immunity in the
  tumour microenvironment, enabling metastasis. TSLP signalling in T cells prevents
  accumulation of CD11b+GR1+ myeloid cells that produce WNT ligands activating the
  WNT–β-catenin pathway in the epithelium, which can lead to carcinogenesis and tumour
  growth. CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor;
  Treg cell, regulatory T cell.
