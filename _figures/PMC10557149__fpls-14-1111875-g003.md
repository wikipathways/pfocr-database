caption: 'Simplified illustration of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and
  its tributaries. Phenylpropanoid pathway provides precursors to two major downstream
  routes – lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, which are the major sources
  of diverse plant secondary metabolites. Key enzymes are shown in blue and abbreviated
  as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4-coumaroyl CoA-Ligase; C3H, p-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate 3-hydroxylase; CHS, chalcone
  synthase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase;
  C3′H, p-coumaroyl shikimate 3′ hydroxylase; CSE, caffeoyl shikimate esterase; CCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase; COMT, caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic
  acid O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; CAD, (hydroxy)cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FNS, flavone
  synthase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; FLS, flavonol synthase; IOMT, isoflavone O-methyltransferase;
  IFR, isoflavone reductase; DFR, fihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanin synthase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase. Note: Complete arrows show a one-step enzymatic
  reaction, whereas dashed arrows denote series of enzymatic steps that have been
  abstracted for simplicity purposes. Bold text is for emphasis of key stages and/or
  enzymes. Adopted from (Emiliani et al., 2009; Dong and Lin, 2021; Ferreira and Antunes,
