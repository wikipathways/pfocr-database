caption: Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PCs. Genetic and epigenetic
  aberrations detected in PC, altering the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, are highlighted
  in red. In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the Wnt ligands initiate signaling
  by interacting, on the cell surface, with the Frizzled (FZD) receptor and the low
  density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) coreceptor. The ligand-activated
  FZD-LRP5/6 complex recruits, respectively, Dishevelled and AXIN2 intracellular proteins,
  preventing the constitutive destruction of cytosolic β-catenin by disassembling
  the β-catenin destruction complex, consisting of AXIN2, adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC), glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase 1 (CK1), and ultimately
  leading to active β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus,
  β-catenin binds and activates transcription factors of the lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF) family, leading to the transcription of Wnt target
  genes (i.e. CCND1). DKK2 and SFRP proteins are natural extracellular inhibitors
  of the Wnt signaling, by respectively binding, and inactivating, the LRP5/6 coreceptor
  and the Wnt ligands. Figure created in BioRender.com, accessed on 10 January 2022.
