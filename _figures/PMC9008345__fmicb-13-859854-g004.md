caption: The SOS response is an inducible DNA repair pathway controlled by two key
  regulators, the LexA repressor of gene expression and the RecA inducer. Under normal
  conditions, LexA is bound to the promoter of SOS-associated genes preventing binding
  of RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) and expression of the regulated genes (). Following
  DNA damage, such as following certain antimicrobial exposures, the DNA polymerase
  III (DNA Pol III) enzyme senses the damage and the increase in single-stranded DNA
  (ssDNA) causes RecA to become activated and bind to the ssDNA. The ssDNA/RecA complex
  leads to proteolysis of the LexA repressor allowing RNA polymerase to bind facilitating
  expression of genes under LexA control. LexA has been shown to impact the expression
  of integrases and transposases, as such the activation of the SOS response has been
  shown to promote horizontal dissemination of resistance genes. Additionally, conjugation
  can also trigger the SOS response as ssDNA is generated and transferred during the
  conjugation process which can upregulate integrase and transposase expression and
  triggering recombination of plasmids in the recipient cells.
