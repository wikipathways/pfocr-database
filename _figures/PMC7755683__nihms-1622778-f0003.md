caption: '(A) Dopamine D1- and D2-receptors mediated cAMP/PKA signaling cascades.
  Dopamine D1-like receptors are coupled with Gα/o proteins. Adenylyl cyclase stimulation
  by GPCRs causes cAMP production, which in turn activates PKA. PKA phosphorylates
  DARPP-32. DARPP-32 phosphorylated on Thr34 is a potent inhibitor of PP1, which results
  in PP1 targets being phosphorylated. Dopamine D2-like receptors coupled with Gio
  proteins block AC and lower the intracellular concentration of cAMP causing PKA
  inhibition. Additionally, dopamine D2-like receptors activate the protein phosphatase
  calcineurin, which dephosphorylates DARPP-32 at Thr34. Like the dopamine D1 receptors,
  these depicted dopamine D2 receptor signaling pathways are not involved in vomiting.
  Abbreviations: cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cyclic AMP; P: phosphorylation
  of protein; PKA: protein kinase A; GPCRs: G protein-coupled receptors; DARPP-32:
  dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein relative molecular mass 32,000;
  PP1: protein phosphatase 1. Black solid arrows = emesis; Red arrows = increase or
  decrease of cAMP; Dashed solid arrows = no emesis.(B) Dopamine D2receptor - mediated
  ERK activation signaling pathway. ERK protein is an integral part of the Ras-MEK-ERK
  signaling cascade. Dopamine D2 receptors can activate ERK by two signaling cascades
  via: i) the Ras/Raf/MEK1/ERK pathway where dopamine through tyrosine kinase receptors
  activates Ras, which binds and phosphorylate Raf. The Raf kinase phosphorylates
  and activates MEK, which in turn activates ERK protein; and ii) Dopamine D2 receptor
  can recruit Arrestins (Arr-2 and -3) proteins, which terminate G protein signaling,
  facilitates receptor internalization, and engages non-canonical G protein-independent
  signaling pathways. Dopamine D2 receptor - mediated ERK activation may potentially
  cause emesis. D1-like receptors regulate a protein complex composed of β-Arr2/ERK
  and MEK and induce ERK activation. However, dopamine D1-like receptors are devoid
  of emetic activity. Abbreviations: Arr: Arrestin; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1 and 2; Raf: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; Ras: rapidly accelerated
  sarcoma. Black solid arrows = emesis; Dashed solid arrows = no emesis.(C) Dopamine
  D2-receptors mediated activation of GSK-3/Akt pathway. From current findings one
  could envisage that direct phosphorylation of Akt following dopamine D2 receptor
  stimulation may promote emesis. Dopamine can exert part of its actions by modulating
  the activity of Akt/GSK-3 proteins acting through various mechanisms. Two mechanisms
  have an opposite effect on the activity of these two kinases. On one hand, dopamine
  D2 receptor activation leading to phosphorylation of GSK-3 causes its deactivation
  and reduction of emesis. On the other hand, the opposite may take place where activation
  of dopamine D2 receptors deactivate Akt by the PP2A. The inactivation of Akt and
  formation of an Akt, β-Arr2, and PP2A signaling complex facilitate both the inactivation
  of Akt by the phosphatase and the increase in GSK-3 activity, which may promote
  emesis. Abbreviations: GSK-3: glycogen synthase kinase-3; Akt/PKB: thymoma viral
  proto-oncogene; P: phosphorylation of protein; PP2A: protein phosphatase 2A. Black
  solid arrows = emesis; Dashed solid arrows = no emesis; Red T lines = inhibition.(D)
  PLC signaling pathways. Dopamine receptors can couple to Gαq to activate PLC causing
  the hydrolysis of PIP2 into two-second messengers; DAG and IP3. DAG activates PKC.
  IP3 stimulates IP3 receptor with subsequent release of Ca2+ into the cytosol. The
  released Ca2+ regulates CaMKII and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) both of
  which may contribute to emesis. LTCCs activated by dopamine D2 receptor agonists
  such as quinpirole can cause the influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell. The
  influx of extracellular Ca2+ can also be partly due to evoked intracellular Ca2+
  release from SER stores via Gα/q-mediated PLC pathway. Overall, the increase cytosolic
  Ca2+ may potentially support the incidence of emesis. Abbreviations: PLC: phospholipase
  C; DAG: 1,2-diacylglycerol; IP3: inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; PKC: protein kinase
  C; IP3R: IP3 receptors; CaMKII: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; LTCC: L-type
  Ca2+ channels; SER: sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release
  (CICR) is a biological process whereby Ca2+ can activate Ca2+ release from intracellular
  Ca2+ stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum or sarcoplasmic reticulum). Black solid
  arrows = emesis; Dashed solid arrows = no emesis; Blue arrows = influx of Ca2+.'
