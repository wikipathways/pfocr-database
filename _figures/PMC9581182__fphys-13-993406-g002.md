caption: Molecular pathways underlying ASM contraction and relaxation. The activation
  of G-coupled protein receptors such as muscarinic and histamine receptors leads
  to subsequent interaction and activation of phospholipase C (PLC) which promotes
  the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 interacts with IP3-gated channels on the SR
  to induce Ca2+ efflux into the cytoplasmic space. Ryanodine receptors (RyR’s) on
  the SR also become activated to release Ca2+. In the cytoplasmic space, Ca2+ binds
  to calmodulin (CaM) which activates it so that it may activate myosin light chain
  kinase (MLCK) which phosphorylates and activates the myosin regulatory light chain
  (LC20) of myosin to initiate cross-bridge cycling and thus muscle contraction. LC20
  is dephosphorylated and thus inhibited by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP),
  but this dephosphorylation is inhibited by two pathways–including the Rho-kinase
  pathway which is stimulated by the activated GPCR and a CPI-17 pathway which is
  activated by protein kinase C. Muscle relaxation can be induced by stimulation of
  a β2-receptor which leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) which catalyzes
  the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP binds and activates PKA which carries out
  various regulatory activities such as inhibiting MLCK, PLC, and IP3-gated channels,
  and activating Ca2+-gated potassium channels in the cellular membrane to release
  K+ which hyperpolarizes the cell. Created with BioRender.com.
