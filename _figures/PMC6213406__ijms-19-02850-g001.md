caption: Putative anticancer effects of MTF exemplified by molecular and cellular
  key events. MTF affects key energy and metabolic processes such as the mitochondrial
  respiration (complex I), TCA cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and
  glycolysis. MTF affects cellular fate processes such as cell cycle, cell growth,
  EMT, autophagy, and apoptosis. AMPK, the cellular key energy sensor, is phosphorylated
  in response to an increased AMP/ATP ratio and implicated in exerting several pleiotropic
  MTF effects. AMPK-dependent mechanisms include, e.g., inhibition of 4EBP1 via the
  Akt/PI3K/mTOR pathway. AMPK-independent mechanisms include, e.g., inhibition of
  mTORC1 by DDIT4. The pleiotropic effects of MTF on gene regulation include, e.g.,
  downregulation of differentiation markers and modulation of epigenetic and mRNA
  features. Direct activation or inhibition processes are thoroughly known only for
  a limited number of molecules, such as LKB1 activation of AMPK. ΔΨM, mitochondrial
  membrane potential; 4EBP1, 4E-binding protein 1; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Akt,
  AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; BCL2, apoptosis
