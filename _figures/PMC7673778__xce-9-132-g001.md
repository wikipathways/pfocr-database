caption: 'The twin cycle hypothesis of the aetiology of T2DM. Liver cycle: Prolonged
  exposure of excess calorie intake under pre-existed muscle insulin resistance will
  divert energy storage from glycogen storage into adipose tissues through activating
  de-novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway. When the maximum subcutaneous fat storage capacity
  is reached or fat storage within the adipocytes is impaired, the plasma triglycerides
  level will rise and diverted into the liver. Toxic lipid intermediates from triglycerides
  and fatty acids metabolism will cause hepatic insulin resistance, which leads to
  elevated levels of fasting insulin to compensate for insulin resistance. High insulin
  levels will enhance DNL and enforce the liver cycle. Pancreas cycle: Excess fat
  accumulation within the liver leads to elevation in hepatic VLDL-TG export to other
  tissues. This will increase exposure of the pancreas to high triglyceride concentrations,
  which increase fatty acids uptake and storage within the pancreatic tissues initiating
  the pancreas cycle. A long-term exposure of fatty acids and related toxic metabolites
  including high glucose would lead to impairment in β-cell function. β-cell will
  overcome this stress in early years during diabetes onset by secreting more insulin.
  However, when 50–60% of β-cell became dysfunctional, β-cell fail to maintain normal
  blood glucose and T2DM will emerge. High glycaemia associated with high fasting
  insulinaemia will drive more DNL which will enforce both the liver and pancreas
  cycles. Adapted with permission from []. T2DM, type 2 diabetes; VLDL-TG, very low-density
  lipoprotein triglycerides.'
