caption: 'Signaling pathways in osteoclast activation. During RA pathogenesis, antigen-presenting
  cells after uptake of an autoantigen or pathogenic molecules process and present
  antigenic determinants on their cell surface in conjunction with arthritis-permissible
  HLA/MHC class II molecules, which activate differentiation of T cells into different
  subphenotypes. The activated T cells secrete various cytokines like IL-6, IL-7,
  IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ. These cytokines modulate macrophages to secrete
  various pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.
  Upon exposure to the inflammatory cytokines, fibroblast-like synoviocytes express
  RANKL, which binds with its receptor (RANK) present on the cell surface of activated
  macrophages initiating the RANK/RANKL pathway through TRAF 2, 5, and 6 proteins,
  which leads to the activation of downstream NF-κB, MAPK, NFATc1, and Src signaling
  cascades. These factors after translocation initiate the expression of genes like
  TRAP, CtsK, and MMP-9 in the nucleus, which promote osteoclastogenesis and bone
  resorption. TLR: toll-like receptor; TCR: T cell receptor; CtsK: cathepsin K; I-κB:
  inhibitor of the NF-κB transcription factor; IL: interleukin; IFN-γ: interferon
  gamma; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC II: major histocompatibility
  complex II; MITF: microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; MMP 9: matrix
  metalloproteinase 9; NFATc1: nuclear factor of activated T cells, calcineurin-dependent
  1; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; p50 and p65: REL-associated proteins (also called
  NF-κB1 and RelA) involved in NF-κB heterodimer formation and nuclear translocation
  and activation; RANK: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL: receptor activator
  of nuclear factor κB ligand; Src: intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase; TRAF:
  TNF receptor-associated factor; TRAP: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. c-Jun
  and c-Fos form the early response transcription factor, AP-1.'
