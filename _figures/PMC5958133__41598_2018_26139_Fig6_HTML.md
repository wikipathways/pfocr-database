caption: Gene transcription in key nutrient metabolic pathways involved in lipid synthesis
  between L. japonica pupae and 3-days-old larvae. Selected genes involved in KEGG
  lipid synthesis with indications of quantified lipid classes and genes significantly
  regulated during pupation. Red and green colors indicate up- and down-regulated
  gene expression, respectively. Log10 of the gene expression in RefSeq are shown
  in larvae (left) and pupae (right). Genes in the glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle
  were also selected, as they stimulate TAG synthesis pathways in larvae. fbpa, fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; dlat, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; pgam, phosphoglycerate mutase. *The genes which FPKM were
  below 1, it was too low for comparison.
