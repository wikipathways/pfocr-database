caption: Log fold ratios are indicated by a gradient from red (up-regulated) to green
  (down-regulated). Comparison was made between symptomatic and apparently healthy
  fruits from the infected orchard. A) Jasmonate biosynthesis, B) Terpenoid and carotenoid
  biosynthesis, C) Salicylic acid pathway.
