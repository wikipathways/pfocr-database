caption: Replacement of a single gene in an assembly with ≥1 genes. (A) A ccdB-CmR
  cassette flanked by attR sites matching the gene to be replaced is produced by PCR.
  The chosen gene is then replaced using attL × attR recombination. (B) The product
  of this reaction contains two attB sites, and can be selected by chloramphenicol
  resistance in a ccdB-tolerant E. coli strain. The two attB sites can then recombine
  with matching attP sites to carry out a replacement reaction. (C) The two attB sites
  can be used to add multiple DNA cassettes using conventional SIRA assembly strategies.
  In both cases, the desired reaction products are selected by loss of the lethal
  ccdB gene. (D) A random selection of transformants from the reaction shown in (C)
  was patched onto solid media to assay carotenoid production. Approximately 50% of
  colonies contained the expected idi, dxs and crtI genes between crtE and crtZ and
  were more intensely coloured than those containing crtI alone.
