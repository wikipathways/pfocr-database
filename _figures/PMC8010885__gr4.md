caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and its feedback mechanism. Cholesterol
  biosynthesis starts with the condensation of two acetyl CoA molecules into acetoacetyl
  CoA. (A) Cholesterol biosynthesis in normal cells is regulated through a negative
  feedback mechanism of cholesterol availability. (B) The cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway in cancer cells is not/less regulated by cholesterol availability and stored
  as cholesterol ester with the help of enzymes like ACAT-1.
