caption: DNA sequence alterations including gene mutation/deletion/amplification,
  gene fusion, and epigenetic modification as well as regulatory mutation result in
  activation of multiple signaling pathways, which contribute to GBM development.
  Traditional targeted therapies are using inhibitors targeting the signaling pathways.
  However, novel therapeutic strategies are signaling pathway independent. Gene therapy,
  immunotherapy, stem cell therapy and CRISPR/Cas9 technology aim to deliver a gene
  to produce toxicity to cancer cells or cause cancer cell apoptosis, enhance host
  immune responses, and correct the mutated genome, which consequently will reduce/cure
  GBM.
