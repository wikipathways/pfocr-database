caption: Pyruvate catabolism in S. agalactiae. One molecule of glucose will produce
  two of pyruvate via glycolysis, with net reduction of 2 NADH molecules. Fermentation
  of pyruvate, will allow NADH reoxidation for its recycling and use in a new round
  of glycolysis. (A) In the absence of oxygen, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is made
  from pyruvate by pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), allowing synthesis of fatty acids.
  The main fermentation product is lactate, but significant amounts of ethanol, acetate,
  acetoin, and diacetyl are also found (). Under aerobic conditions, production of
  acetoin, diacetyl, and acetate is prevalent over that of ethanol. (B) In the presence
  of oxygen without addition of external heme or quinone sources (respiration nonpermissive
  condition), lactate is still the main fermentation product, which leads to a significant
  decrease in pH. (C) Upon addition of external heme and quinone, in the presence
  of oxygen (respiration permissive condition), the respiratory chain (NDH-2/cyt bd)
  becomes functional. Metabolism is shifted toward production of acetate, acetoin,
  and diacetyl, reducing the amount of pyruvate available to be converted into lactate.
  This results in less acidification of the medium in the stationary phase. Higher
  growth yield is achieved as a result of enhanced ATP formation via the Pta-Ack pathway
  and possibly oxidative phosphorylation by the electron transport chain. Boxes indicate
  the main products for each condition. ACK, acetate kinase; ALS, acetolactate synthase;
  ALDB, 2-acetolactate decarboxylase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
