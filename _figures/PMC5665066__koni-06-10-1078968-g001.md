caption: PolyI:C induces tumor necroptosis via the TLR3 -TICAM1 pathway. When CT26
  cells are treated with pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD, the interaction of TICAM1 and
  RIP3 is enhanced in response to poly(I:C), leading to cell death by necroptosis.
  In the absence of immune cells, this necroptosis pathway contributes to tumor regression
  in vivo. Necroptosis is induced in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C). Poly(I:C)
  also acts on DCs and macrophages to elicit effective CTL/NK activation and modify
  tumor microenvironment, respectively, as previously reported. The antitumor response
  of TLR3 appears to be cell type-specific. Notably, tumor-infiltrated macrophages
  harbor all the signal axes inducible by poly(I:C)/TLR3 as illustrated. The functional
  alteration of macrophages may be associated with epigenetic status of the cells
  in inflammatory environment.
