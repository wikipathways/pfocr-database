caption: Mechanisms involved in osteocyte mechanotransduction. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  initiates with binding of Wnt to the complex made up of frizzled and lipoprotein
  receptor 5/6 (LRP5/6) co-receptors which leads to a cascade of events including
  the eventual phosphorylation of GSK-3β (). β-catenin accumulates and is translocated
  to the nucleus; here, it forms a complex with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors to mediate expression of key genes
  associated with bone cell function (; ). In osteocytes, the α5β1 integrin interacts
  with gap junction gene, Cx43, to control opening of Cx43 hemichannels (Cx43 HC)
  activated by fluid flow. Osteocytes perceive mechanical load at αVβ3 integrin attachment
  locations (). Via release of PGE2, shear stress triggers Akt and cAMP/PKA signaling,
  which together inactivate GSK-3. This results in further build-up of nuclear β-catenin
  (). In effect, osteocytic gene expression is altered, mediating osteoblast and osteoclast
  activity.
