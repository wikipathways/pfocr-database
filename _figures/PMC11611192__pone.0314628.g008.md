caption: High glucose decreased the ability of GEnCs to respond to cholesterol load,
  leading to downregulation of ABCA1 expression, increased cholesterol accumulation,
  and pyroptosis in GEnCs. Circ8411 regulated ABCA1 by inhibiting the action of miR-23a-5p,
  and miR-23a-5p binds to the 3’ UTR of circ8411. High glucose could decrease circ8411
  expression by inhibiting RXRα. GLP-1RAs could potentially reduce cholesterol accumulation
  and cell pyroptosis by modulating the RXRα/circ8411/miR-23a-5p/ABCA1 axis
