caption: 'Ferroptosis regulatory pathways. The regulatory pathways of ferroptosis
  can be roughly classified into three types. The first involves iron metabolism,
  including the regulation of ferritin degradation by NCOA4. The second is the GSH/GPX4
  pathway, which includes system xc inhibition, the transsulfuration pathway, and
  the glutamine pathway. The third is lipid metabolism, including ACSL4, ACSL3, and
  LPCAT3, which are related to lipid regulation and ferroptosis. In addition, FSP1
  inhibits ferroptosis independently of GSH, and the BH4–GCH1 axis effectively inhibits
  lipid peroxidation and thereby defends against ferroptosis. Abbreviations: TF, transferrin;
