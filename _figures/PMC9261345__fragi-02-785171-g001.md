caption: 'Telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage response and NAD metabolism in telomeropathies.
  Telomere dysfunction via loss of telomere repeats or loss of protection by telomeric
  shelterin proteins elicits DDR, driving cellular senescence or apoptosis. Short
  telomeres and DDR also evoke NAD metabolome dysregulation, via CD38 hyperactivation,
  which excessively consumes NAD and reduces the available NAD to PARPs and SIRTs.
  As a result, the functions of PARylation and SIRT1 activities in telomere and mitochondrial
  maintenance are limited. Consequently, mitochondrial impairment-induced ROS and
  defective PARP-related DNA repair may accelerate telomere damage and aggravate cellular
  senescence or apoptosis. Top right: an overview of the NAD salvage pathway. The
  NAD consuming enzymes, PARPs, SIRTs, and NADases consume NAD and generate NAM. The
  NAD biosynthesizing enzyme nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  (NMNAT) recycles NAM into NMN, followed by conversion of NMN to NAD by nicotinamide
  mononucleotide (NAMPT). The NAD precursor, NR is converted to NMN by NRKs nicotinamide
  riboside kinases.'
