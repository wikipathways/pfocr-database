caption: Signaling pathways involved in IL-1β—mediated regulation of atherosclerotic
  vascular calcification. (A) IL-1β activates JNK pathway by downregulating BMPR2
  expression and subsequent BMPR2-dependent inhibition of JNK, which promotes endothelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EndMT), leading to BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation.
  (B) IL-1β inhibits the mobilization and infiltration of mesodermal progenitor cells
  (MPCs), which can bi-directionally differentiate into osteoblasts (OBs) or osteoclasts
  (OCs). While in hypercholesterolemia IL-1β enhances the mobilization and infiltration
  of Sca-1+/PDGFRα+ cells, which are differentiated from MPCs and the progenitor cells
  of OBs. PPARγ promotes the differentiation of MPCs into OCs. (C) IL-1β stimulates
  tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) expression and activity in both vascular
  smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and mesenchymal stem cells followed by pyrophosphate
  (PPi) degradation. PPi is an effective endogenous inhibitor of Ca10(PO4)6(OH), which
  is a major component of the calcified aorta. This chain of events accelerates atherosclerotic
  vascular calcification.
