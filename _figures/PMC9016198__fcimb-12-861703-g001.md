caption: Pathophysiological mechanism of long COVID thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 enters
  cells through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors and conducts RNA and protein synthesis
  and replication. SARS-CoV-2 buds in the ERGIC compartment or Golgi apparatus and
  exits the cell via a biosynthetic secretory pathway. In long-COVID, SARS-CoV-2 may
  hide in these EVs and re-attack various tissues and organs through the circulatory
  system. In addition, PS exposure on EVs creates a catalytic surface for clotting
  factors to facilitate the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. After cell activation
  and injury, ATP production is reduced and consumption increases. With the resulting
  increase in intracellular Ca2+, two ATP-dependent transposases (flippase and floppase)
  are blocked, and ATP-independent scramblases are activated. This leads to the exposure
  of PS in the outer cell membrane, accompanied by the shedding of microparticles
  (MPs). PS promotes the decryption of tissue factor (TF) to form TF-FVIIa complex
  and provides binding sites for procoagulant complexes (endogenous and exogenous
  fXase and prothrombinase) leading to the generation of thrombin. Pulmonary hypertension,
  pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis are common in long COVID resulting in
  impaired lung function. With the change of lung function, chronic hypoxia inevitably
  occurs. Hypoxia-induced inflammation may further exacerbate capillary dysfunction
  and promote thrombosis. Due to SARS-CoV-2 persistence, chronic inflammation in long
  COVID may be a mechanism that stimulates ECs, platelets and other inflammatory cells,
  promotes the upregulation of procoagulant factors, and destroys the protective function
  of vascular endothelium, thereby causing abnormal coagulation.
