caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of PKCα-CT regulated, MEF2-targetted cardiac mRNAs.
  Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software was used to depict potential signaling pathways
  involving the 15 putative MEF2 targets among PKCα-CT up-regulated mRNAs. Nine of
  15 mRNAs were included in the network. Lines with arrowheads, molecule acts on a
  target; lines without arrowheads, binding only. Solid lines, direct interaction;
  dotted lines, indirect interaction. Blue background, regulated putative MEF2 targets;
  white background, other signaling network members.
