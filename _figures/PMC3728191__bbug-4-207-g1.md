caption: Figure 1. Schematic overview of the secretory pathway in yeast. Proteins
  targeted for secretion enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). If they fold correctly
  they can enter the secretory pathway, whereas misfolded protein cause ER stress
  leading to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that results in
  activation of a very large number of cellular processes, including activation of
  chaperones and foldases (like BIP and PDI) that assist with refolding. UPR is also
  upregulating ER-associated degradation (ERAD) where the unfolded proteins are exported
  from the ER, ubiquitinated and hereby targeted for degradation by the proteasome
  (ubiquitin-proteasome system, UPS). Correctly folded proteins can be exported to
  the Golgi for further processing (including additional glycosylation). The COPI-
  and COPII-complexes facilitate the ER-Golgi transfer, and from the Golgi the protein
  may be secreted via the endosome or be targeted to the vacuole for storage and/or
  degradation. Different colors represent different types of vesicular compartments
  of the secretory pathway.
