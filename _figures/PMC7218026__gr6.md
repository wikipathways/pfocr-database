caption: '(A) Schematic presentation of the ACLY PIP2 binding region and the novel
  Lyn/Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The three tyrosine phosphorylation
  sites identified in our study and common in Lyn/Src kinase mediated ACLY phosphorylation
  are shown, including Y682 (catalytic domain), Y252 (citrate-binding domain) and
  Y227 (ATP-binding domain). The ACLY peptides which were used in our experiments
  are shown (peptide-1 in the ATP-binding domain sequence and peptide-2 in the CoA-binding
  domain sequence). The PIP2 binding motif on ACLY, which was detected using the ACLY
  peptide-2, is shown. See also  for the detailed information about the phosphorylation
  and binding sites (B) Proposed model for interaction between oncogenic signal transduction
  pathways and Acetyl-CoA metabolic pathway in transformed cells. PI3K and Src family
  kinases-mediated pathways are the most frequently activated signaling pathways in
  cancer. As indicated on the right, we propose that Lyn/Src oncogenic kinase-mediated
  tyrosine phosphorylation of ACLY () induces its interaction with phospholipids where
  ACLY directly binds to PI(4,5)P2 and other phospholipids in cancer cells ( and ).
  These interactions lead to increased ACLY-dependent Acetyl-CoA synthesis (), which
  may in turn lead to the increase of phospholipid synthesis (including PIP2) (, )
  and protein acetylation in cancer cells (F). The basis for a persistent interaction
  of PIP2/PIP3 with ACLY remains to be defined, but it could result from Lyn/Src-mediated
  phosphorylation of ACLY () and/or increased Lyn/PI3K-mediated PIP2synthesis (, )
  and/or direct oncogene-mediated alteration of PIP2 (; ) in the cell membrane and/or
  the nuclear compartment of cancer cells. Thus, we propose a Src family tyrosine
  kinase and PI3K-dependent mechanism whereby oncoproteins hijack a major, Acetyl-CoA-mediated,
  metabolic pathway fueling synthesis of phospholipids and growth of cancer cells.
  This paradigm may provide further insight into the striking ability of PI3K and
  Src kinases to transform various cell types (red color on the right stands for the
  oncogenic constitutive activation pathways in cancer cells; RTKs on the left in
  normal cells: Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, the dashed line represents a regulatory
  temporary stimulation via cytokine/RTK and other receptors in normal cells).'
