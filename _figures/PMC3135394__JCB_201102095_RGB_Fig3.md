caption: Localization of oxidant signaling. One unresolved issue in redox signaling
  is how specificity is achieved with highly diffusible agents such as hydrogen peroxide.
  One mechanism may be to control the accumulation of ROS to discrete areas. Shown
  here is the signaling pathway envisioned to result after growth factor (GF) stimulation.
  Ligand binding to its receptor stimulates, through a PI3K/Rac-dependent process,
  superoxide production from the Nox family of NADPH-dependent oxidases. Extracellular
  oxidants are channeled back into the cell through specific plasma membrane aquaporins.
  Although hydrogen peroxide (red circles) can be rapidly and efficiently degraded
  by intracellular antioxidants, Src family members stimulated by growth factors appear
  to phosphorylate and subsequently inactivate the main intracellular peroxide scavenger,
  peroxiredoxin (Prx I). This Prx1 inactivation only occurs in the region surrounding
  the stimulated growth factor, thus allowing for the local accumulation of hydrogen
  peroxide. When the ROS reach sufficient levels, target molecules such as protein
  phosphatases (PTP) can be reversibly oxidized.
