caption: Hepatic metabolism pathway of glucose, citric acid cycle and fatty acid metabolism
  as influenced by rumen-protected protein (RPG) supplementation. (A) Glycolysis/glycogenesis.
  (B) Citrate cycle. (C) β-oxidation of fatty acid. The red arrows show the rate-limiting
  steps in each metabolic pathway. For each protein code, the gray color indicates
  no detection, green indicates no effect caused by RPG supplementation, and purple
  indicates a decrease in the RPG treatment group.
