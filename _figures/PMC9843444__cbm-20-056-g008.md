caption: The relevant mechanism of PDCs differentiated into adipocytes. Dexamethasone,
  rosiglitazone, insulin, and IBMX are all potent activators of the 3′,5′-cyclic AMP
  (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase pathway, and cAMP regulates the phosphorylation
  of P300. P300 is a histone acetyltransferase transcriptional coactivator that mediates
  the acetylation of P53. Acetylated P53 is in an activated state, and positive feedback
  regulates P300. P300-P53 interacts with PPARγ and regulates the acetylation level
  of PPARγ. Mutant P53 is acetylated and modified by P300, and has a beneficial function
  in the adipogenic differentiation of PDCs, whereas wild-type P53 is ubiquitinated
  by P300, thus negatively regulating the adipogenic differentiation of PDCs. As a
  member of the nuclear-receptor superfamily, PPARγ induces growth arrest and adipogenic
  differentiation. In addition, the RAS/RAF/ERK signaling pathway is associated with
  the development and progression of malignant tumors. Activated ERK1/2 leads to PPARγ
  phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits adipocyte differentiation. FABP4, a member
  of the FABP family, is abundantly expressed in adipocytes and serves as a marker
  of successful adipogenic differentiation. The expression of FABP4 depends on the
  different post-translational modifications of PPARγ. During adipogenic differentiation
  of PGCs, the phosphorylation level of PPARγ gradually decreases. The increased acetylation
  level of PPARγ in PDCs promotes lipid synthesis.
