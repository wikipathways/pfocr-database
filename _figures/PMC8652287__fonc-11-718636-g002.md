caption: Cellular mechanisms associated with radioresistance. Cytoplasmic membrane,
  reticulum endoplasmic, and mitochondria are the main organelles where tumor cells
  assemble a response to develop radioresistance. Radiation can damage the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) homeostatic state and cause ER stress that will favor radioresistance.
  This last is also supported by mitochondrial alterations, metabolic remodeling,
  and by an increase in plasma membrane interconnections favoring the formation of
  cytoplasmic bridges. Cetuximab promotes radioresistance involving ERS pathway IRE1α/ATF6-GRP78.
  Silencing GRP78 inhibits the cooperative effects of radiotherapy and cetuximab inhibiting
  DSB repair and autophagy in OPCC. IRE1 promotes radioresistance in HPV-negative
  OPCC through IL-6 activation. Decreased MPC1 expression favors EMT and promotes
  radioresistance of cancer.
