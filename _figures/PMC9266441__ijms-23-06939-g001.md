caption: Chemical structure of some of the flavonoids and other polyphenolic compounds
  featured in this review. Polyphenols can be classified into flavonoids and tannins,
  alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoid. Substantial variation is intuitively
  observed by distinct chemical substitutions, especially hydroxylation and glycosylation.
