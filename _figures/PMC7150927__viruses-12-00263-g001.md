caption: Model depicting the known targets of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-2b, Tomato
  spotted wilt virus (TSWV)-NSs and begomovirus C2 and βC1 proteins in the pathways
  regulating plant defences and symptomatology. (A) In non-stressed conditions, the
  level of active jasmonate, Jasmonoyl-Isoleucine (JA-Ile), is very low. JAZ repressors
  bind to MYC2 to repress its transcriptional activation on downstream genes of the
  JA signalling pathway. (B) Under herbivore insect attack, the strong increase of
  JA-Ile triggers the assembly of a JAZ-COI1 co-receptor that will be recruited by
  the E3-ubiquitin ligase SCFCOI1 (SKP1/Cullin/F-box). JAZ repressors will undergo
  ubiquitination and be addressed to the 26S proteasome for degradation. (C) The transcription
  factor MYC2 and others are released and can activate the genes involved in JA response,
  like those in terpene biosynthesis, glucosinolate production, and other responses
  (grouped in the red box). During viral infection, viral suppressors of RNA silencing
  are produced and can antagonise some of these responses. Here are shown four of
  them, the CMV-2b (panel B), the begomovirus C2, the begomovirus satellite βC1 (panels
  B and C) and the tospovirus NSs (panel C), interacting with their known targets
  compromising the SCFCOI1 complex activity (panel B) or some specific gene activations
  (panel C). Red bar-heads indicate the inhibitory effect of the viral proteins. The
  regulations between the various host genes are not reported.
