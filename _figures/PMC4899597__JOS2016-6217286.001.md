caption: (a) Canonical Wnt signalling involves binding of Wnt to LRP5/6 and its coreceptor
  Frizzled resulting in the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 thus permitting Axin to bind
  to the receptor complex. Formation of this complex leads to inhibition of GSK3β
  which prevents degradation of β-catenin. Accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin leads
  to nuclear translocation where it activates target gene promoters which result in
  increased bone mass. (b) Sclerostin inhibition of the Wnt-canonical pathway in osteogenesis.
  Sclerostin binding to LRP receptor 5/6 prevents Wnt binding and formation of the
  Frizzled-LRP complex and thus Axin remains unphosphorylated. Downstream effects
  include activation of GSK3β resulting in phosphorylation of cytosolic β-catenin,
  thus targeting it for degradation. In the absence of β-catenin accumulation and
  subsequent nuclear translocation, osteogenesis is prevented.
