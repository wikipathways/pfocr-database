caption: Proposed model for the cellular response to complex DNA damage (CDD) induced
  by proton beam therapy (PBT) in chromatin. On induction of CDD, this triggers monoubiquitylation
  of histone H2B on lysine 120 (Ub) by the E3 ubiquitin ligases ring finger 20/40
  complex (RNF20/40) and male-specific lethal 2 homolog (MSL2). This stimulates recruitment
  of the necessary DNA repair proteins and/or chromatin remodeling factors that promote
  CDD accessibility. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in particular is essential
  for efficient CDD repair. Our evidence also suggests the involvement of histone
  trimethylation (Me) and predictably a deubiquitylation enzyme (DUB) that is able
  to regulate access to CDD. Repair then proceeds through the respective DNA repair
  pathway dependent on the nature of the damage, although we suggest a particular
  dependence on the base excision repair (BER) pathway in the cellular response to
  high-LET protons, prior to subsequent chromatin assembly.
