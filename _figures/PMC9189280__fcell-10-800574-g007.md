caption: Diagram of curcumin suppressing intracellular ROS and RIPK3 expression in
  high glucose-treated podocytes. Schematic representation of the possible signaling
  pathway leading to podocytopathy by high glucose. We suggest that the elevated hyperglycemia
  condition can induce the intracellular ROS generation and increase RIPK3 expression,
  resulting in podocytopathy through inflammatory response and fibrosis. Curcumin
  administration protects against podocyte injury by inhibiting ROS generation and
  downregulating RIPK3. Due to a cross-stimulating relationship between the two, the
  reduced level of each further contributes to the suppression effect of curcumin
  on intracellular ROS and RIPK3 expression. RIPK3 inhibition prevents necroptosis
  of podocytes since it prevents phosphorylation and aggregation of MLKL to proceed
  the final stage of necroptosis. Cas-8, caspase-8; Cas-3, caspase-3; MLKL, mixed
  lineage kinase domain-like protein.
