caption: Comprehensive interaction of plenty proteins in signaling pathways inhibited
  by FX exposure. The protein PSME1 is one of the main regulators of IL-1, in response
  to which, in turn, the expression of PTGIS is enhanced. The interaction of IL-1
  with its single receptor IL1R causes the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from the
  complex with Myd88 and the assembling of a molecular complex with IL-1. This complex,
  in turn, activates TRAF6, which starts the process of its autoubiquitination. Being
  in such modified form, TRAF6 interacts with TAK1, which has to be already activated
  by the TGF-β factor. After interaction and activation, TAK1 is bound to a complex
  of TAK2 and TAK3 subunits and such molecular machinery enhances the expression of
  the NF-κB inhibitors, like IKK2 and IKKB. On the other hand, PSME1 is a regulator
  of the Raf-MAPK pathway where IL-1 interacts with Ras surface receptors and, thus,
  activates its cytoplasmic GEF domain. Activated RAF with GTP can interfere with
  the YWHAB dimer, and the PHB factor initiates their rearrangement and further heterodimerization,
  which is the starting point for triggering the MAPK/MAPK2 signaling pathway.
