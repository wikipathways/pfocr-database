caption: Regulatory network of C2H2-ZFPs in flowering induction. As demethylases or
  methyltransferases, C2H2-ZFPs are involved in histone modification of the FLC locus
  and flowering induction. C2H2-ZFPs can participate in vernalization, FRI regulation,
  and autonomous regulation pathways of FLC. They can also repress FT expression in
  the photoperiod pathway. ELF6 can perform the function of H3K27me3 demethylase and
  interact with BZR1. Then, the protein complex can activate FLC expression and inhibit
  flowering transition. SUF4 is required in the positive regulation of FLC by FRI.
  Both MAD1 and MOS1 can interact with SUF4. Therefore, SUF4 links the cell cycle
  and flowering induction. CZS interacts with SWP1. Subsequently, the protein complex
  participates in histone deacetylation and H3K9/H3K27 methylation. LATE may repress
  FT expression in the photoperiod regulation pathway.
