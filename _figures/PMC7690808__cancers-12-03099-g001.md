caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling pathways in tumorigenesis.
  The dual roles of TGF-β signalling pathways have been demonstrated in tumorigenesis.
  TGF-β is a tumour suppressor in TME development of early-stage cancer and a tumour
  promoter in malignancy processes of advanced-stage cancer. Schematic diagramme (above)
  showing TGF-β signalling and its role in cancer tumorigenesis and progression as
  well as tumour suppression. TGF-β binds to TGFBR2 which then complexes with TGFBR1
  to activate downstream signalling. TGF-β can activate both Smad-dependent canonical
  and Smad-independent non-canonical signalling cascades. The TGF-β activated TGFBR1
  phosphorylates the Smad2/3 complex which then associates Smad4, before translocating
  to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of different targeted genes involved
  in tumour suppression during tumorigenesis (e.g., p15INK4b and p21Cip1), as well
  as tumour progression (e.g., Snail and Vimentin). The Smad-dependent TGF-β canonical
  signalling pathway can also be antagonised by Smad7 through inhibiting the binding
  of the Smad2/3 complex with Smad4. In the Smad-independent non-canonical signalling
  cascades, the activated TGFBR1/2 receptors induce downstream signalling through
  the Ras/Raf/MAPKs (JNK/p38/ERK), PI3K/AKT, MAP3K7(TAK1)/NF-κB, and Rho family of
  small GTPase-dependent signalling pathways. The TGF-β activated JNK/p38/ERK-MAPKs
  also crosstalk with Smad2/3/4 to modulate downstream signalling to influence cancer
  development. The Rho family of small GTPase-dependent signalling pathways (e.g.,
  Rho/ROCK) are involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The activated
  PI3K/AKT pathway induces mTOR to promote cell proliferation and EMT. The TGF-β signals
  also activate NF-κB signalling to modulate inflammatory response.

  description: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling pathways in tumorigenesis.
    The dual roles of TGF-β signalling pathways have been demonstrated in tumorigenesis.
