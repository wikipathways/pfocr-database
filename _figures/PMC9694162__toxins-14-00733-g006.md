caption: A proposed signaling pathway involved in RSV against ZEA-induced oxidative
  stress (OS) and apoptosis in TM4 cells. The schematic diagram shows that RSV induces
  Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective protein via activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway,
  which protects against OS of TM4 cells. ZEA induces ROS generation results in cell
  apoptosis. Meanwhile, RSV activates Nrf2/HO-1 through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation
  of Nrf2/HO-1 protects against ZEA-induced apoptosis. Green arrows indicate stimulation,
  and red bars indicate inhibition.
