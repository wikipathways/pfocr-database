caption: Steps involved in the biogenesis and functions of miRNAs. (A) The miRNAs’
  synthesis and maturation pathway. MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II enzyme
  as about 500–3000 nucleotides-long pri-miRNA capped with 7-methylguanosine at its
  5′-end and polyadenylated tail at the 3′-end. The pri-miRNAs form a specific secondary
  structure of hairpin-shape and stem–loop, and are then cleaved by the RNase III
  family enzymes Drosha-DGCR8 based on the stem–loop structure, which cleaves 11 base
  pairs away from the single-stranded stem–loop junction to shorten the pri-miRNA
  to 60–70 nucleotides with double helix hairpin structure to yield the pre-microRNA
  that contains a 5′-phosphate group and 2–3 nucleotides overhang stretch at the 3′-end.
  Then, the pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by the shuttle protein Exportin-5
  in an Ran-GTP-dependent manner, where the pre-miRNA is cleaved by the endonuclease
  cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme Dicer to yield an approximately 22 nucleotides dsRNA
  with two-nucleotide 3′-overhang miRNA:miRNA* duplex in concert with TRBP or PACT
  cofactors. The miRNA:miRNA* duplex unwinds by cytoplasmic helicase and one of the
  strands is defined as a mature miRNA, and miRNA* is quickly degraded. The mature
  miRNA, AGO2, and other proteins are incorporated into the RISC to form an miRISC.
  (B) The mechanisms of miRNA action. The activity of mature miRNAs binding to the
  target mRNA sequence occurs in a perfect or, most often, in an imperfect manner.
  The complementarity binding is usually restricted to the 5′-end nucleotides 2–8
  of the miRNA, termed “seed sequence”, with the mRNA complementary sequences at 3′-UTR.
  Due to decreased steric hindrance, the perfect miRNA:mRNA complementarity usually
  lead to degradation of the mRNA by AGO2 via the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway
  and is referred to as “slicer activity”. The imperfect pairing with mRNA causes
  the RNA-Polymerase to become blocked and leads to the low-level efficiency of mRNA
  transcription at the initiation, or elongation and termination. In addition, the
  miRNAs can bind the promoter regions and the coding regions to upregulate the translation
  of their target mRNA, but this is in the minority.
