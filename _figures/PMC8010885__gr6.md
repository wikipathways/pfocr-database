caption: Schematic representation of cholesterol associated changes in cancer cells
  and available therapeutic targets. (A) Role of cholesterol in stemness, ROS generation,
  intestinal inflammation, migration, sphere formation, activation of different signaling
  molecules, increased angiogenesis, imparting chemo and radioresistance as well as
  reprogramming of cancer-associated immune cells. (B) Conversion of blood cholesterol
  to oxycholesterol, through enzymatic or radical oxidation. (C) Different mode of
  cholesterol uptake; pathway associated with altered cholesterol biosynthesis and
  storage of cholesterol along with different agents targeting cholesterol metabolism
  for treatment.
