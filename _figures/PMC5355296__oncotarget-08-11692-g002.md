caption: 'ATF3 directly promotes the expression of GADD45A, PPP1R15A, and IL6. It
  indirectly increases the expression of TXNIP and EGR1 and binds to CREB5. ATF3 and
  GADD45A expression is increased by EGR1. IL6 affects the expression of ATF3 and
  indirectly that of EGR1. At the same time, IL6 indirectly affects and is affected
  by PPP1R15A and GADD45A, and it is also indirectly affected by TXNIP. Solid line:
