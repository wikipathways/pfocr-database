caption: The UDP-selective P2Y6 receptor controls orexigenic AgRP neurons and food
  intake regulation. The central nervous system (CNS), in particular the arcuate nucleus
  of the hypothalamus (ARH), integrates neurohormonal signalling from the periphery,
  such as uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP). The P2Y6 receptor, a member of the P2Y G protein-coupled
  receptor family, is highly expressed in the ARH, particularly in AgRP neurons. The
  P2Y6 receptor is selective for the nucleotide UDP, whose synthesis in the CNS depends
  on the salvage pathway, which is directly controlled by the peripheral supply of
  the precursor metabolite uridine, typically increased in obesity/diabetes. Pharmacological
  blocking of P2Y6 receptor activation in the CNS, with the selective P2Y6 receptor
  antagonist MRS 2578, inhibits feeding in mice (modified from [] and reproduced with
