caption: A schematic diagram summarising the main cation pathways involved in solute
  loss from red cells in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). In deoxygenated
  red cells (right), HbS polymerises causing morphological sickling and activation
  of (i) Psickle, a deoxygenation-induced cation conductance. Its main effect is to
  allow entry of Ca2 + which activates a second transport pathway, (ii) the Ca2 +-activated
  K+ channel or Gardos channel, which mediates conductive K+ loss at high rates. In
  oxygenated red cells (left), Psickle and the Gardos channel are inactive. A third
  transport pathway, (iii) the KCl cotransporter (KCC) mediates obligatorily coupled
  efflux of K+ and Cl−. It is present at higher activities in HbS-containing red cells,
  compared to those from normal (HbAA) individuals. Activity is further enhanced by
  low pH, swelling and urea. KCC may remain active in deoxygenated sickle cells, with
  Mg2 + loss via Psickle, further increasing its activity. The relative importance
  of these pathways in red cells from HbSC and HbSS patients appears to differ which
  may be important in pathogenesis.
