caption: 'Lipid mediators in benign and malignant hematopoiesis. In benign hematopoiesis,
  PGE2 is secreted in large amounts in the osetoblastic niche and increases stem cell
  homing, and long-term LSC numbers. The role of lipoxins is still not fully understood,
  however lipoxins are required for stem cell quiescence and long-term renewal. In
  AML, LSC are considered to be chemoresistant and responsible for disease relapse.
  Self-renewal and maintenance of LSC in the bone marrow niche are increasingly better
  understood and growing data show alterations of lipid pathway enzymes suggesting
  eicosanoid pathways are active in leukemic blasts. HSC: hematopoietic stem cell,
  LSC: Leukemic stem cell; CAR cell: CXCL12-abundant reticular cell; PGE2: Prostaglandin
