caption: 'Altered pancreatic beta cell mechanism silencing alpha and delta cells.
  A: right, anabolic hormones: In hyperglycemia, beta cells release insulin; tyrosine
  kinase receptors elicit glucose uptake, synthetic processes, cells divide. Enzymes
  are dephosphorylated: PK, PDH, glycogensynthase are switched on, phosphorylase a,
  HSL are off; glycogen and lipids increase. These effects are induced via (PKB).
  Citratesynthase is active, controlled by NADH. Anabolic beta cells turn off with
  GABA- Zn2+ catabolic alpha cells. A: left, catabolic hormones: In hypoglycemia alpha
  cells release glucagon; adrenals release epinephrine. GS-coupled receptors activate
  adenylate cyclase, (PKA) phosphorylates enzymes: phosphorylase a, is switched on,
  hydrolyses glycogen; glycogensynthase is off. Neoglucogenesis is activated; (PK)
  and PDH blockade orient the pathway, sparing pyruvate for neoglucogenesis. Glucagon
  elicits (CRH) (ACTH) release triggering glucocorticoid-cortisol release from adrenals.
  Cortisol induces muscle proteolysis, providing amino acids for neoglucogenesis.
  Citratesynthase inhibition spares oxaloacetate for neoglucogenesis. Phosphorylated
  (HSL) provides fatty acids, giving ketone bodies. B: Cancer hybrid metabolism: GABA
  release interruption from beta cells, cancels alpha cells inhibition, eliciting
  a hybrid catabolism-anabolism 1- In tumor cells, insulin induces mitosis and anabolism
  via PKB; citratesynthase is activate. But glucagon and epinephrine elicit, via PKA,
  phosphorylation and inhibition of PK and PDH. Low GABA increases epinephrine, inhibits
  somatostatin; reinforcing Growth Hormone-IGF- insulin actions. 2- In stores, catabolic
  hormones trigger proteolysis and lipolysis. 3- Metabolism is rewired below PK and
  PDH bottlenecks: tumor citratesynthase pulls the glucose flux; receiving oxaloacetate
  via (PEPCK), while acetylCoA comes from ketone bodies or fatty acids oxidized in
  peroxisomes (their mitochondrial transport is blocked by malonate forming tumor
  fatty acids via acetylCoA carboxylase). ATPcitratelyase receives the mitochondrial
  citrate efflux. Diverted from neoglucogenesis, amino acids form tumor proteins,
  feed lactatedehydrogenase via alanine transamination.'
