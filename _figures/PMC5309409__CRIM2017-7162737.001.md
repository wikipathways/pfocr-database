caption: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Transcription coupled repair (TCR)
  removes DNA damage from actively transcribed genes and global genome repair (GGR)
  from the rest of the genome []. TCR starts when RNA polymerase stops at the damaged
  DNA, which acts as a signal for CSA and CSB binding. In GGR, the XPE protein and
  the XPC-HR23B complex recognize the DNA damage. Upon initial recognition of the
  DNA lesion, both pathways converge. The XP-B and XP-D DNA helicases unwind the region
  surrounding the damaged site, along with the XP-A, XP-G, and replication protein
  A (RPA) []. The XPF-ERCC1 nuclease complex and XP-G endonuclease excise the damaged
  DNA. The resulting gap is replaced by de novo DNA synthesis.
