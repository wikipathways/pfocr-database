caption: Molecular pathway alterations in DLBCL-type RS. The pathogenesis of DLBCL-type
  RS is due to the dysregulation of multiple molecular pathways due to genetic lesions
  of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, stereotyped B-cell receptor (BCR)
  configuration, and BCR signaling alterations; these lead to the enhanced cell survival
  and proliferation typical of DLBCL-type RS cells. Inhibition of apoptosis may also
  be involved. BTK, Bruton tyrosine kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; PLCγ2,
  phospholipase C gamma 2; XPO1, exportin 1. Image created with Biorender.com (accessed
