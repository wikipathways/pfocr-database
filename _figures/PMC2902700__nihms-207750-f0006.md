caption: GIP, which is overexpressed in obesity, appears to bind to its G-protein
  coupled receptor, which signals through multiple intracellular proteins, including
  the cAMP and MAPK pathways. In addition, GIP activates PI3K/Akt, a major growth
  stimulating pathway, as well as its downstream signals, as evident by its effects
  on mTOR components and proteins phosphorylated by Akt exclusively at a conserved
  serine/threonine motif. The proposed model indicates that GIP activates several
  intracellular pathways to produce its proliferative effects in CRC.
