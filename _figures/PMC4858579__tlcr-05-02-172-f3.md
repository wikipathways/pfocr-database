caption: Inhibition of EMT in NSCLC cells. (A) The HDAC inhibitor entinostat maintains
  an open chromatin structure and the transcription of E-cadherin. Entinostat hereby
  enforces the epithelial state and prevent EMT; (B) selumetinib inhibits MEK and
  thus the MAPK pathways. As the MAPK pathway is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase
  signaling as well as TGF-β signaling, selumetinib has potential both as a first
  line treatment and as a treatment upon resistance development. EMT, epithelial to
  mesenchymal transition; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; HDAC, histone deacetylase;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.
