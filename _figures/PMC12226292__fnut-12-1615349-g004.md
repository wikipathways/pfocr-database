caption: '(a) Oxidative stress mechanism: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  generates superoxide radicals (O2•-) due to electron leakage from the electron transport
  chain. These radicals further transform into reactive oxygen species (ROS), including
  hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH•). When ROS production
  overwhelms cellular antioxidant defenses, it leads to an imbalance that attacks
  polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, initiating lipid peroxidation. Byproducts
  of lipid peroxidation subsequently cause DNA damage and overall oxidative cell damage.
  (b) M. oleifera’s antioxidant action: M. oleifera combats oxidative stress through
  its bioactive components, including quercetin, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and chlorogenic
  acid, which provide potent antioxidant protection. These antioxidants directly scavenge
  ROS and neutralize free radicals like superoxide (O2•-). M. oleifera also enhances
  the activity of key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
  (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)1, enhancing cellular defense against oxidative
  damage. By scavenging ROS and boosting antioxidant enzyme activities, M. oleifera
  reduces lipid damage in membranes. Furthermore, M. oleifera modulates cellular signaling
  pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, which regulate inflammatory responses triggered
  by oxidative stress, thereby ensuring cell health through its rigorous antioxidant
  properties'
