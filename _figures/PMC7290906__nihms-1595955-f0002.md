caption: Polyplex internalization pathways, driven by mediators, cytoskeleton movements,
  and GTPase signaling. While many more pathways influence those shown, in addition
  to feedback control from extracellular and intracellular factors, the simple overview
  highlights the key mechanisms of interest and methods for inhibition or activation
  for know effectors RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42–. The YAP/TAZ pathway was also explored
  as past studies have shown a possible relation between Rho and actin polymerization
  regulation through YAP–. Note that bold arrows indicate the general flow for cascades
  as it related to polyplex uptake and processing or membrane resturcturing, with
  dotted arrows indicating cross-pathway interactions between different cascades.
