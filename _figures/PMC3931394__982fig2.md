caption: 'Transcriptomic analysis of isolated islets from GLU+IL–infused 6-month-old
  rats. A: Differentially expressed genes represented in scatter plot graph. B: Top-ranked
  biofunctions and canonical pathways annotated by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software (Fisher exact test P values are shown). C: Representative network of genes
  involved in cell cycle progression, showing a central role for HB-EGF, FOXM1, and
  FOXO3a. Upregulated genes are shown in red, and downregulated genes are shown in
  green. Data were obtained from five animals in each group.'
