caption: (A) A schematic diagram of the βint-ν signalling pathway for regulating ISC
  proliferation and differentiation. βint-ν inhibits up-regulation of JNK signalling
  in young flies cultured under normal condition. The up-regulation of JNK signalling
  induced upd transcription as well as F-actin accumulation. Upds in turn promoted
  ISC proliferation (duplication) and differentiation. In addition, accumulation of
  F-actin related to activation of JNK signalling. (B) A possible model for progression
  of homeostasis disruption of the adult midgut epithelium in βint-ν mutants. 1) Locally
  and weakly stressed/damaged cells are produced. 2) JNK signalling is activated.
  3) Upds and F-actin are up-regulated, which promotes ISC proliferation (duplication)
  and differentiation as shown in D. 4) Retention of JNK–active cells and F-actin-mediated
  multilayering results in a further increase in Upds. 5) Expansion of epithelium
  with a high turnover rate from the local defective region (step 4) together with
  additional local stress/damage (step 1) cause an entire and chronic high level activation
  of the JNK-Upds pathway for additional defects such as midgut shortening.
