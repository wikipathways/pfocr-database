caption: The PERK kinase phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)
  in response to unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When
  eIF2 is phosphorylated, a group of stress-responsive Transcription factors, including
  ATF4, translocate to the nucleus and translates more efficiently. ATF4 enhanced
  the production of nuclear factor-like 2 (NRF2) through the PERK pathway. While oxidative
  stress happens, ATF4 forms heterodimers with NRF2 to induce antioxidant transcription.
  A Functional cross-talk between NRF2 and NF-κB. The lack of NRF2 can dramatically
  increase NF-κB activation. Conversely, NF-κB can regulate NRF2 transcription and
  activity, in both positive and negative impacts on the target gene’s expression
  depending on the level of stress in the cells. ATF4 induces the expression of two
  transcription factors, ATF3 and CHOP, which usually inhibit the pathway but can
  activate it in stressful circumstances. B In infected cells, GRP78 level is elevated
  due to an increase in ER stress responses. Overexpressed GRP78 can induce ATF-4
  expression. Moreover, accumulated ATF-4 synergically induces GRP-78 expression.
  Therefore, GRP-78 has been translocated to the cell membrane and help as an effective
  receptor for virus entry C Natural components and some small molecules can reduce
  ER stress through controlled GRP-78 level and ATF-4 expression
