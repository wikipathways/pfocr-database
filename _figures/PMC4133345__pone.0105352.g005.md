caption: Phytochrome B (PhyB) is mediates light signaling that modulates flowering
  time in response to photoperiod in sorghum. In LD, PhyB up-regulates the expression
  of PRR37 and GHD7, two central floral repressors, during the evening phase of LD
  but with minimal influence in SD. Induction at this time of day is also dependent
  on output from the circadian clock. PhyB may stabilize and interact with PhyC, a
  candidate gene for Ma5 a locus that also contributes to photoperiod regulation of
  flowering time. SbPRR37 activates SbCO expression peaking at dawn. SbPRR37 and SbGhd7
  repress expression of the floral inductors SbEHD1, SbCN8, SbCN12 and SbCN15, leading
  to delayed flowering in long days. In SD or 58 M (phyB-1), expression of the floral
  repressors SbPRR37 and SbGHD7 is reduced which results in floral initiation once
  plants have satisfied other requirements for flowering. PhyB was found to mediate
  repression of SbCN15 regardless of day length.
