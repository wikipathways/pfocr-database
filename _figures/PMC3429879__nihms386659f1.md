caption: In step 1, human papillomavirus (HPV)-E6 protein promotes p53 degradation.
  In doing so, p53 may not be able to bind M2b as it normally does in a protein–protein
  interaction, freeing M2b (a small subunit β) to associate with M1 (the large subunit
  α) and form catalytically active ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (perhaps most often
  in its α6β2 higher order form). In step 2, HPV-E7 protein aids in retinoblastoma
  (Rb) protein degradation, activating transcription factors that may elevate RNR
  subunits. Together, ribonucleotide diphosphate (rNDP) substrates are reduced to
  2′-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate (dNDP) in step 3. Once phosphorylated to a deoxynucleoside
  triphosphate (dNTP), DNA may be repaired. Enzymes in a complementary salvage pathway
  can also lead to dNDP production in a fourth pathway. cdN = cytosolic deoxynucleotidase;
  dCK = deoxycytidine kinase; dGK = deoxyguanine kinase; dN = deoxynucleoside; DNC
  = deoxynucleotide carrier; dNMP = deoxynucleoside monophosphate; ENT = equilibrative
  nucleoside transporter; mdN = mitochondrial deoxynucleotidase; mtDNA = mitochondrial
  DNA; NDP = nucleoside diphosphate; PNP = purine nucleoside phosphorylase; TK = thymidine
  kinase; TP = thymidine phosphorylase.
