  NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds the co-activator, RBPJκ, to transcribe
  LRP8. (4) LRP8 is the neuronal receptor for the selenium transport protein, SELENOP.
  (5) Following internalization, SELENOP is degraded in the lysosome, releasing selenocysteine
  (Sec). Sec is decomposed to selenide by Sec lyase (SCLY), which is used to synthesize
  Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec in a pathway involving selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2), ultimately
  incorporating Sec into de novo translated Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4). (6) GPX4,

  checkpoint in the ferroptosis pathway. Diminished GPX4 activity causes ferroptosis.

  chance of ferroptosis occurring, held in better check by wild type PS than mutant

  Fe2+ reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to generate lipid peroxides,

  accumulation from reaching lethal levels.'
