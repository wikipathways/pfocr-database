caption: Model of signalling pathways for EGF activation of c-jun. Components for
  signalling pathways to the c-jun promoter and for phosphorylation of c-Jun protein
  are shown and are described in the text. The pathway for induction of the c-jun
  promoter downstream of MEKK is unknown and may involve JNK and/or a separate pathway
  as indicated by the question marks. Two arrows between components indicate that
  the activation of the protein is not direct.
