caption: 'Schematic illustration of design of chimeric Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway.
  The bacterial/eukaryotic classic EM pathway (left), modified EM pathway of Thermococcales
  archaea (center), and chimeric EM pathway constructed in this study (right) are

  EM pathway are indicated by green arrows. Abbreviations used: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;

  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 1,3-BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  2-PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; GK, glucose kinase; PGI, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase; PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase; FBA, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; TIM,
  triosephosphate isomerase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO, enolase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; MLDH, malate/lactate dehydrogenase, GAPOR, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase; GAPN, non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
