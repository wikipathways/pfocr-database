caption: 'Schematic presentation of the hydrogen peroxide-mediated regulation of phosphorylation
  signals in response to extracellular stimuli. When a hydrophilic growth factor binds
  RTK, tyrosine phosphorylation occurs on the receptor. PTP in its active form dephosphorylates
  RTK, so that only weak phosphorylation signals are transmitted to the nucleus (the
  upper pathway). When NADPH oxidase (NOX) is activated by ligand binding, superoxide
  is simultaneously produced and dismutated to hydrogen peroxide. Because catalytic
  cysteine in PTP is highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, the catalytic cysteine
  sulfhydryl (Cys-SH) is oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH), which causes
  transient inactivation of PTP. Accordingly, the activated state of RTK with phosphorylated
  tyrosine is sustained, which transmits mitotic signal for an extended period of
  time (the lower pathway). Cys-SOH can be reduced back to Cys-SH by reductants such
  as glutathione (GSH), which ceases the signal transmission. When hydrogen peroxide
  is produced excessively, PTP is inactivated by intramolecular disulfide bond formation.
  This mechanism prolongs the phosphorylation signal and hence causes tumorigenic
  growth of the cells. Terms: Y, tyrosine residue; P, phosphate group; RTK, receptor
  for tyrosine kinase; PTP; phosphotyrosine phosphatase, NOX; NADPH-dependent oxidase,
  SH; sulfhydryl, SOH; sulfenic acid.'
