caption: O-GlcNAcylation is linked by the HBP to nutrient availability and thus its
  regulation of the complex metabolic network. Two percent to 3% of intracellular
  glucose enters the HBP and undergoes a series of chemical reactions to produce the
  end product UDP-GlcNAc. The UDP-GlcNAc in the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane is
  utilized for O-GlcNAcylation. UDP-GlcNAc makes the dynamic O-GlcNAcylation extremely
  sensitive to changes in cellular nutrients used as a sensor of the functional state
  of multiple pathways such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  glycogen synthesis and catabolism, etc. Meanwhile, the interconversion of intermediates
  between the HBP, polyol pathway, fructose, PPP, glycogen, glycolysis and TCA cycle
  greatly enhanced the nutritional sensitivity of O-GlcNAcylation. A portion of UDP-GlcNAc
  is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus while being
  used for other O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation. Other fractions of UDP-GlcNAc
  are used for the biosynthesis of proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, glycolipids, glycolphosphatidylinositol
  anchoring, etc.
