caption: The CS in carcinogenesis. The chief components of the CS are the molecular
  chaperones, and the figure shows steps in carcinogenesis, e.g., in BC, in which
  they actively participate, favoring tumor growth, which makes them suitable targets
  for negative chaperonotherapy, namely eliminating/blocking/inhibiting the pathogenic
  chaperone. For instance, Hsp27 regulates apoptosis through interaction with Akt
  and the inhibition of caspases-3/9 activity, thereby leading to tumor cell survival.
  The T-complex protein 1 subunit beta (CCT2)-mediated AIB1 folding is involved in
  cancer development in pathways of cell growth, invasiveness, and survival. AIB1
  promotes cancer development via hormone-dependent pathways, acting as a transcriptional
  coactivator for nuclear receptors in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.
  Moreover, several non-nuclear receptor transcription factors, e.g., HER-2, NF-kB
  and MMPs, are coactivated by AIB1. Hsp60 may function either as an anti-apoptotic
  factor promoting cancer cell survival, or as a pro-apoptotic factor that promotes
  cancer cell death. Hsp70 inhibits tumor-cell apoptosis by interfering with the formation
  of the apoptosome by preventing caspases-3/9 activation. Hsp70 also induces evasion
  from apoptosis, blocking PI3K/AKT signaling. Hsp90 is involved in cancer development
  in pathways of cell growth, invasiveness, and survival. The components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway are Hsp90 clients, and this chaperone thus plays a role in the regulation
  of autophagy with a tumor cell pro-survival function.
