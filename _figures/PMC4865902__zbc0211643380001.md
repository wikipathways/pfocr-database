caption: A, schematic overview of ChREBP and N-terminal (81–196) regulatory region
  () and representation of important sites, including the nuclear export signals NES1,
  NES2, and NLS. B, proposed nuclear-cytosol trafficking pathway of ChREBP. In response
  to high glucose, phosphorylated inactive ChREBP is dephosphorylated by xylulose
  5-P (Xu5P)-activated PP2A and translocates into the nucleus through interactions
  with importin α and importin β. ChREBP is further dephosphorylated in the nucleus
  and induces transcription of lipogenic genes. A decrease in glucose levels results
  in inactivation of ChREBP by phosphorylation by PKA and complex formation with 14-3-3
  and CRM-1 to the cytosol (). bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix.
