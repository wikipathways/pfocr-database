caption: Simplified summary of the modulatory effects of NE and DA on prefrontal cortical
  inhibitory synapses. At presynaptic sites, NE and DA can inhibit GABA release by
  activating α2 receptors and D2 receptors, respectively; whereas NE also enhance
  GABA release through activation of α1 or β adrenergic receptors. At postsynaptic
  sites, NE and DA increase GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory current through β receptors
  and D1 receptors by activating camp-PKA signaling pathway. NE and DA also recruit
  α2 receptors and D2 receptors, respectively, leading to inhibition of cAMP-PKA signaling
  and thus decreased GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory current. Activation of D2
  receptors also triggers Akt-GSK3 signaling to decrease GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory
  current.
