caption: 'Schematic representation of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway in yeast
  and its main metabolic connections with glycolytic intermediates. Glucose carbon
  feeds the glycolytic pathway, which is mainly used to provide substrates of anabolic
  pathways. In this context, the sphingolipid synthesis is tightly linked to serine
  synthesis from 3‐phosphoglycerate (Vander Heiden et al., ; Stathem et al., ; Hwang
  et al., ; Gao et al., ). Only some glycolytic intermediates, genes involved and
  key metabolic steps for the discussion are represented. Additional information can
  be found in recent reviews (Henry et al., ; Megyeri et al., ; Olson et al., ). Abbreviations:
