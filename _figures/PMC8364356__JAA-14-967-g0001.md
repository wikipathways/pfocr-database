caption: Extrinsic Coagulation Cascade in Response to Allergen Exposure-Induced Airway
  Damage Allergen exposure and/or tissue damage initiates the extrinsic coagulation
  pathway in the extravascular compartments of the airway. Downstream activation via
  antigen presenting cells (APCs) promotes clinical features of asthma pathobiology,
  including AHR, airway inflammation, and fibrosis. In Type 2-high asthma with comorbid
  obesity, the pathway becomes imbalanced, favoring pro-coagulation (black) and anti-fibrinolysis
  (blue). The above figure is used to exemplify the coagulation pathway. Created with
