caption: 'Protective effects of Sestrins in cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders,
  neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. The antioxidant effects of Sestrins are
  primarily responsible for their protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases
  and other disease states associated with significant accumulation of ROS. Additionally,
  by modulating mTOR/AMPK signaling pathway by Sestrin2 indirectly represses tumor
  growth and activates autophagy. Consequently, autophagy activation confers a protective
  role of metabolic and heart diseases and aging. ATG1/13: autophagy-related protein
  1 and 13; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin.'
