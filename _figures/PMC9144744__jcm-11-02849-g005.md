caption: Schematic of future planned studies for pediatric cases eligible for metronomic
  chemotherapy. Proteomic and metabolic pathway analysis, where feasible, will be
  used to determine eligibility of patients to receive specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  (TKI) therapy coupled with metronomic chemotherapy, which involves alternating cycles
  of metronomic etoposide with metronomic cyclophosphamide. Patients not selected
  or not eligible for TKI-based therapies will receive valproic acid (VA) and celecoxib
  with metronomic chemotherapy as outlined in this manuscript.
