caption: Functional network analysis of the six differentially expressed genes post-RT
  in LPCa patients. (A) Gene interaction network built on the 6-GS using the GeneMANIA
  database. The different color of the lines connecting the relevant genes depicts
  the type of interaction, including (1) regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion
  and regulation of T-cell activation; (2) leukocyte cell-cell adhesion; (3) positive
  regulation of cell-cell adhesion and positive regulation of leukocyte cell-cell
  adhesion; (4) positive regulation of cell, leukocyte, lymphocyte and T-cell activation;
  (5) lymphocyte co-stimulation; (6) antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway;
  and (7) receptor complex function. (B) Internal interactions between the 6-GS expression
  products. The corresponding proteins were mapped in the protein-protein interaction
  (PPI) network using the STRING database. Nodes and edges represent proteins and
  their interactions, respectively. Filled, colored nodes represent query proteins
  and first shell of interactors with known or predicted 3D structures. Turquoise
  and pink edges show known interactions extracted from curated databases or those
  experimentally determined, respectively. Yellow edges represent text-mining interactions,
  black edges indicate that the respective proteins are co-expressed.
