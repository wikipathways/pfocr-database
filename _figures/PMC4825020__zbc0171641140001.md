caption: Biosynthetic pathway of 24-methyl and 24-ethyl sterols in higher plants.
  This study determined that ArDWF1 catalyzes the direct reduction of a Δ24(28) sterol
  (red arrow) as opposed to the typical two-step mechanism that includes double-bond
  migration. To simplify the discussion, all structures are depicted as having 3β-hydroxy-Δ5
  nuclei. However, this does not necessarily mean that the reactions proceed as the
  nuclei structure.
