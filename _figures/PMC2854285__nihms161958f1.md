caption: One branch of mTORC1 activation is mediated by the class I phosphoinositide-3
  kinase (PI3K), Akt (also known as Pkb) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
  TSC is formed by TSC1 and TSC2, and inhibits a direct activator of mTORC1, the GTPase
  Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) by hydrolyzing its GTP into GDP []. TSC2 is
  activated by phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [], which is
  directly activated by a high AMP vs. ATP ratio. AMPK also directly phosphorylates
  and inactivates Raptor, so it inhibits mTORC1 by TSC-dependent and -independent
  manners []. The activity of AMPK is regulated by phosphorylation by the tumor suppressor
  LKB1. This protein, like TSC1/2, was found mutated in the germline of patients with
  different hamartomatous syndromes [,]. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase and an important
  player in regulating mTORC1 activity. Akt positively regulates mTORC1 by acting
  at different levels. First, Akt inactivates TSC1/2 by phosphorylating TSC2 []. Second,
  Akt inhibits Pras40, negative regulator of mTORC1 that counteracts Rheb function
  [,]. Akt is activated by PI3K, which responds to a variety of growth factors. When
  activated by insulin or insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), as well as other growth
  factors, class I PI3K catalyzes the formation of the lipidic second messenger phosphoinositide
  3,4,5 tri-phosphate (PIP3) from the bi-phosphate form PIP2. PIP3 triggers the relocation
  of Akt to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where it is activated by phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and transduces the signal as described above. Opposing Akt function
  is the tumor suppressor Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten
  (Pten), a lipid phosphatase that converts of PIP3 to PIP2, thus shutting off signaling
  from PI3K. Pten deficiency causes a series of hamartomatous syndromes collectively
  classified as PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (reviewed in []). Amino acids activate
  mTORC1 by an independent route mediated by the Rag family of proteins. The activation
  of mTORC2 is not well-understood, but this complex directly activates Akt (and Akt-related
  kinases) by phosphorylation. Akt, in addition, regulates many proteins involved
  in cell survival and cell cycle progression.
