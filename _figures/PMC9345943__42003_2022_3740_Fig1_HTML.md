caption: Bluish green arrows represent glycosylation steps using UDP-glucose as a
  sugar donor, blue arrows represent the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-rhamnose and
  glycosylation steps using UDP-rhamnose as a sugar donor. Multi-step conversions
  were presented as multi arrows. Bluish green marked genes represented previous reported
  genes and the bule marked gene represented the identified one in this study. PPD
  protopanaxadiol, PPT protopanaxatriol.
