caption: Metabolic determinants for Treg migration. Tregs exhibit increased glycolysis
  during migration. 1 CCR4 and CCR8 contribute to Treg abundance in the TME. 2 The
  PI3K-AKT-mTORC2 axis promotes glycolysis by activating GCK, which also interacts
  with actin to enhance cytoskeletal rearrangements during migration. Additionally,
  the PI3K-Akt-mTORC2 pathway inhibits CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 by suppressing the FoxO1
  and FoxO3 transcription factors, thereby strongly influencing Treg migration in
  a way that favors Treg access to peripheral nonlymphoid organs while impairing their
  recirculation in lymphoid organs. 3 PPAR-γ plays an important role in driving the
  recruitment of Treg cells to sites of inflammation. GCK glucokinase, S1P1 sphingosine-1-phosphate
  receptor 1, FoxO1/3 Forkhead Box O1/3, PPAR-γ peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ
