caption: Recognition, cell signaling, and immunomodulatory pathways triggered by PSA
  in colonic dendritic cells. PSA is recognized by TLR1/TLR2 dimers that result in
  NF-kB nuclear translocation and IRF-mediated activation of Type I IFN gene expression
  and enhanced antigen processing and presentation by increased expression of iNOS,
  MHC class II molecules, and costimulatory signals mediated by CD86 and ICOSL. In
  addition, Dectin-1, a C-Type Lectin pattern recognition receptor, contributes with
  TLR2 in the cell signal activation through the PI3K pathway, resulting in the nuclear
  phosphorylation and activation of CREB, triggering the expression of anti-inflammatory
  genes. As a result, naïve CD4+ T cells are activated and differentiated in IL-10-producing
  immunomodulatory cells with Foxp3, CD39, Tr1 phenotypes that might depend on the
  inflammatory condition (IBD, asthma, EAE, or other). PSA recognition by TLR4 dimers
  induces the production of IFN-β with anti-viral activity through a MyD88 and TRIF-dependent
  pathway. The activation of TLR4/TRIF is dependent on the lipooligosaccharide (LOS)
  portion of the polysaccharide. CREB, cAMP response element–binding protein; GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β; IFN, interferon; IL-10, interleukin 10; iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; IRF, interferon regulatory factors; MHC II, major histocompatibility
  complex class II; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NFkB, nuclear
  factor-kB; PSA, polysaccharide A; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TLR, toll-like
  receptor; TRAP, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein. TRIF, TIR domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-beta.
