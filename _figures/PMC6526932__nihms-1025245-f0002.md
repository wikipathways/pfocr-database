caption: Catalysed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNA methylation occurs at the
  carbon-5 position of cytosine. Intracellular ascorbate influences the DNA methylation
  landscape by enhancing the enzymatic activity of ten-eleven translocation enzymes
  (TETs), which actively remove cytosine methylation marks through a series of oxidation
  reactions dependent on oxygen, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), Fe2+ and ascorbate on the
  basis of its function as an αKG-dependent dioxygenase (αKGDD),. TETs first convert
  5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC). In the next two steps,
  5hmC is further oxidized to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5CaC).
  Subsequently, 5fC and 5CaC are converted to cytosine by the base excision repair
  pathway enzyme, thymine DNA glycosylase. By promoting the recycling of Fe3+ to Fe2+,
  ascorbate ensures that TETs are constantly active. DHA, dehydroascorbic acid.
