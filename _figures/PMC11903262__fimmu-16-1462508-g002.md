caption: Protective role of Trem2 in different models of myocardial injury. After
  myocardial infarction, Trem2hi macrophage is responsible for efferocytosis of apoptotic
  and necrotic cardiomyocytes. Efferocytosis-dependent activation of TREM2-SYK-SMAD
  signaling pathway remold the metabolism of macrophage and promote section of itaconate,
  inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in an ischemic environment, promoting
  the proliferation of fibroblasts, and suppressing inflammation. Specific knocking
  out Trem2 in macrophage (LysMCreTREMflox/flox, also termed Mac-TREM2 KO) resulted
  in impaired clearance of necrotic/apoptotic cell after MI, less fibrosis generation,
  reduced wall thickness and LVEF. In sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, TREM2hi macrophage
  contribute to the maintaining of mitochondrial homeostasis and recovery of cardiac
  function through the scavenging of defective mitochondria. Mice with complete knockout
  of the TREM2 gene (TREM2-/–C57BL/6J) resulted in accumulation of damaged mitochondria
  in the extracellular space of cardiomyocyte and exacerbated cardiac function in
  sepsis. In animal model of DOCA-salt induced hypertensive HFpEF, TREM2 expression
  was significantly upregulated in macrophage. Deletion of Trem2 (TREM2-/–C57BL/6J)
  lead to exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, reduced capillary
  density, reduced expression of proangiogenic genes and increased expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines in macrophage. AMI, acute myocardial infarction; DOCA, deoxycorticosterone
