caption: 'Comparing the core structures of 1 and 4, biosynthesis of the naphthacenecarboxamide
  carbon frameworks of 1 is predicted to parallel that of the oxytetracycline (oxy)
  biosynthetic pathway,  and may share a number of common intermediates. As shown
  in , the putative aglycon is likely to be 8, which exhibits the typical features
  of a tetracycline except replacement of 4-(R)-dimethylamine with 4-(S)-hydroxyl,
  inversion of stereochemistry at C-6 and O-methylations at C-6 and C-12a. Downstream
  tailoring of 1 is therefore likely to occur following assembly of 8. In order to
  decipher the timing of the three unique post-PKS tailoring reactions leading to
  the biosynthesis of 1: glycosylation with d-olivose 14, O-4′ acylation of angelic
  acid and C-4 acylation of salicylic acid 19, crude extract of S. sp. SF2575 culture
  was prepared and analyzed on HPLC and LCMS to try to identify any potential stable
  intermediates that may be present. S. sp. SF2575 culture was grown on solid Bennette''s
  media for 10 days at 30°C. A sample was extracted each day starting with day 4 to
  analyze the metabolic profile. Using selected ion monitoring, two potential intermediates
  identified were 6 ([M+H]+ at m/z 576, RT = 18.3 min) and 7 ([M+H]+ at m/z 696, RT
  = 26.8 min), in addition to the parent compound 1 ([M+H]+ at m/z 778, RT = 34.2
  min) (). The UV spectrum of each compound was similar to that of 1 with a characteristic
  tetracycline λmax at 358 nm, and a λmax at 302 nm for 1 and 7 characteristic of
  the salicylate. The UV spectrum of 6 lacks this contribution at 302 nm resulting
  in a smooth peak at 358 nm, and is indicative of the loss of salicylate compared
  to 7 as suggested by the molecular weight difference. To confirm the identity of
  these compounds as shown in , authentic standards were prepared from base hydrolysis
  of purified 1 as described by Hatsu et. al. Treatment of 1 with 0.5 M NaOH led to
  the hydrolysis of the angelate and afforded 7, while complete conversion to 6 was
  obtained by treating 1 with 1.0 M NaOH for 15 hours. Following purification of 6
  and 7 from the base hydrolysis reactions, proton NMR and HRMS were used to confirm
  the structures by comparison to published data (). These prepared samples were then
  used as standards to verify the identities of 6 and 7 in the fermentation extract
  of S. sp. SF2575 by HPLC retention time, mass fragmentation pattern and UV spectra.'
