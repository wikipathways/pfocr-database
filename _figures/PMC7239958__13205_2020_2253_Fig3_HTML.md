caption: Metabolic pathway of l-dopa agent against Parkinson’s disease. Degeneration
  of the substantia nigra occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease. l-Dopa is converted
  to dopamine with the help of enzyme DPOPA decarboxylase. This happens both in thecentral
  nervous system and within the peripheral circulation after levodopa has crossed
  the blood–brain barrier. Once converted to dopamine, it activates postsynaptic dopaminergic
  receptors and compensates for the decrease in endogenous dopamine. (MAO-B inhibitors
  decrease DA levels,which can ensure its rapid breakdown by the catalytic enzyme
  monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), whose level is increased within the Parkinson's disease.
  Selegiline is well tolerated used MAO-B inhibitor, which, when administered with
  l-DOPA, may sustain the response of l-DOPA. Dopamine agonists can increase DA levels
  within the brain and are most active during the early stages of Parkinson's disease.
  They will even be combined with l-DOPA in the late stages of Parkinson's disease
  to extend the lifetime of l-DOPA). l-DOPA L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, DA dopamine,
  DA Agonist dopamine agonist, MAO-B monoamine oxidase B, COMT catechol-O-methyltransferase,
  Ach acetylcholine.
