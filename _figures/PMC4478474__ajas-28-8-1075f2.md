caption: Gene co-expression network of the 48 genes in the peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor pathway based on their expression values. To assess correlations, we calculated
  the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between all gene pairs. Edges join genes
  with co-expression correlation (Pearson’s r) ≥0.65. The red members indicate significantly
  differentially expressed genes from the analysis of variance test.
