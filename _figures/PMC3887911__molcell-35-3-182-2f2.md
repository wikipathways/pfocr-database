caption: Activation mechanism of Orai1 and STIM1. Schematic showing current understanding
  of CRAC channel activation. Under resting conditions, Orai1 and STIM1 are distributed
  at the PM and the ER membrane. The subunit stoichiometry of Orai1 under resting
  and stimulated conditions is currently unclear. For convenience, a tetrameric assembly
  of Orai1 is depicted here. Upon store depletion triggered by T cell receptor stimulation
  and InsP3 production via PLCγ1, STIM1 oligomerizes by sensing ER Ca2+ depletion
  with its ER-luminal EF-hand domain, clusters and translocates to the ER-PM junctions.
  By physical interaction with the cytoplasmic, N and C terminus of Orai1 through
  the CAD/SOAR domain (coiled coil domains 2 and 3), clustered STIM1 recruits and
  activates Orai1 in the ER-PM junctions. STIM1 contains an ER-luminal region comprising
  the EF-hand and SAM domains, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region.
  The cytoplasmic region has three coiled-coil domains (CC1, 2, and 3), serine/proline-rich
  domain (S/P) containing the residues involved in posttranslational modifications
  (see below), and a polybasic region (poly-K) at the C terminus that interacts with
  phosphoinositides after store depletion. The exact role of the poly-K tail of STIM1
  in resting conditions is not known, but it may interact with phosphoinositides on
  the ER membrane to maintain its inactive, folded structure.
