caption: Model of signaling pathways downstream of PMT-activated Gαq/11, inhibiting
  differentiation of osteoblasts. PMT permanently activates members of the Gαq/11
  family. This activation is independent of any GPCR interaction. In osteoblasts,
  Gαq/11 stimulates RhoA via p63RhoGEF. RhoA-Rock stimulates in turn the MAPK pathway
  in a Ras dependent manner leading to altered gene expression. GPCR – G protein-coupled
  receptor; Rock – Rho kinase, ERK – extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RTK –
  receptor tyrosine kinase.
