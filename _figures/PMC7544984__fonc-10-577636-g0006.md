caption: The crosstalk between SRSF3 and other splicing regulators in the regulation
  of gene expression. There are antagonistic effects among SRSF3, SRSF1, and HnRNP
  L on alternative splicing or 5'ss selection, involving the key genes or signaling
  pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, MCC protein, and Rac1b.
