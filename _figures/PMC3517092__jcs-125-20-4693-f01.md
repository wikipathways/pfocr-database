caption: Schematic depiction of the role of the retromer complex in mediating endosomal
  protein sorting. The cargo-selective retromer complex operates in the endosome-to-Golgi
  retrieval pathway to sort cargo, such as CIMPR and sortilin (see ). The interaction
  of retromer with cargo proteins requires its recruitment to the endosomal membrane,
  a process that is mediated by Rab7a and Snx3. The sorting nexin (Snx) heterodimer
  dimer, comprising the Snx-BAR proteins Snx1 or Snx2 and Snx5 or Snx6, mediates tubule
  formation and links to microtubules through the p150-glued–dynein complex. The cargo-selective
  retromer subcomplex (Vps35–Vps29–Vps26) recruits the WASH complex, which mediates
  the production of branched actin networks on the surface of endosomes. The cargo-selective
  retromer complex together with Snx27 and the WASH complex operate in the endosome-to-cell
  surface recycling of the GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor and of other proteins including
  α5β1 integrin. Additionally, the cargo-selective retromer complex also regulates
  the signalling activity of another GPCR, the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR).
