caption: 'A schematic representation of major regulatory pathways associated with
  NAFL and NASH clinical candidates. Therapies largely target three organ systems
  to improve liver health: 1) liver, 2) adipose tissue, and 3) brain. Nuclear hormone-based
  agonists for THR-β, PPARδ, PPARα, and FXR and peptide-based agonists for GcgR and
  FGFR4 directly target the liver. Thyroid hormone agonists specifically decrease
  ectopic fat by binding to hepatic THR-β, leading to mitochondrial β-oxidation and
  modulation of cholesterol metabolism. A similar pathway is utilized by agonists
  of PPARδ, PPARα, and glucagon. FXR agonists activate and inhibit diverse signaling
  pathways that alter glycogen storage, β-oxidation, and circulating FGF19 while simultaneously
  decreasing lipogenesis, bile acid production, gluconeogenesis, and VLDL-production.
  FGF19-based therapies mimic aspects of FXR therapy decreasing lipogenesis and bile
  acid production. Both pan-PPAR and FXR agonist signaling in hepatic stellate cells
  decrease collagen production to improve fibrosis. Extrahepatic adipose tissue acts
  as a second target for therapeutic improvement of NAFL and NASH. PPARγ agonists
  and FGFG21-based therapies signal adipocytes to improve lipid storage and decrease
  insulin resistance and inflammation. GHRH, GLP-1, and GIP agonists signal the CNS
  to resolve hepatic dysfunction. GHRH increases GH secretion and subsequent IGF-1
  production, which can directly work on adipocytes and hepatocytes to engage multiple
  metabolic pathways. Incretin-based therapies targeting GLP-1R and GIPR largely improve
  liver health by decreasing body weight and fat mass via food intake modulation but
  could also involve secondary effects in adipose tissues via indirect or direct actions.'
