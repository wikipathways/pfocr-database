caption: 'Simplified concept of CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoints.Notes: In the priming
  phase, antigen-presenting cells present antigens to the T-cell. Two signals are
  required to initiate a T-cell response. CTLA-4 is upregulated after T-cell activation
  and inhibits the T-cell response. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies bind to CTLA-4, turning
  off the ‘inhibitory signal’, thus resulting in an enhancement of T-cell function.
  In the effector phase, the PD-1 inhibitory receptor is expressed by the T-cell and,
  when it is engaged by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, it serves to inhibit the T-cell
  response. Anti-PD-1 antibodies bind to PD-1, turning off the ‘inhibitory signal’
  in the peripheral tissues and enhancing T-cell function. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions
  are complex, and this interaction is also involved in the priming phase. We have
  chosen to portray the main concepts for both of these immunologic checkpoints in
  this figure for simplicity.Abbreviations: CD, cluster of differentiation; CTLA,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  PD, programmed cell death; TCR, T-cell receptor.'
