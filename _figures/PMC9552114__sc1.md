caption: Graphical abstract of this study.PDGF-loaded PVA based microneedle was fabricated
  by Teflon mold method. In vivo studies showed an enhancement of tendon healing quality
  through angiogenesis in rat achilles tendon injury model. Followed up experiments
  including high-throughput RNA sequence further revealed role of MAPK/p38 pathways
  in PDGF tendon healing process. After combination of PDGF and PDGFR, MAPK/p38 signaling
  pathway was activated. Phosphorylation of p38 was entered into nucleus and combined
  with transcriptional factors. Two predicted promoters of Cyclin D, CREB and AP-1,
  downstream molecules of p38, were then transactivation and the expression of Cyclin
  D was upregulated. With the upregulation of Cyclin D, cell proliferation was enhanced
  leading to angiogenesis and tendon healing enhancement.
