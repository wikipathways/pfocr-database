caption: (a) The Protein-Protein Interaction Network for the differentially expressed
  genes common in IDC and ILC. (b) The interaction network of target genes is visualized,
  where node color represents their expression logFC value in cancer samples. The
  nodes' color shows the expression intensity of each gene (red-downregulation, blue-upregulated
  genes) and edges represent the interaction between genes. (c) The bar graph showing
  the expression values of ALP genes in IDC and ILC samples. (d) The interaction attributes
  obtained from GeneMANIA, where ALP genes are highlighted in orange color, other
  target genes in grey and additional neighboring genes in black color nodes, color
  of edges represent interaction types, blue - co-expression, red - physical interactions,
  green - pathway sharing and yellow - shared protein domain. (e) The Biological Processes
  (blue), Molecular Functions (purple) and enriched pathways (green) association network
  are shown. Each group of ontology terms and pathways are represented with different
  colors based on their functional specificity. The small square nodes represent the
  target DEGs.
