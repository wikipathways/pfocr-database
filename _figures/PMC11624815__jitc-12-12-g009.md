caption: Schematic diagram of combination therapy to remodel the acidic microenvironment
  of tumors to promote antitumor effect. Tumor acidic microenvironment impairs mitochondrial
  energy metabolism in macrophages and T cells and induces oAd-αCD47 immunotherapeutic
  resistance; NaBi improves the acidity of the TME and activates the calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding proteins/PGC1α mitochondrial
  biosynthesis signaling pathway, thereby reprogramming the energy metabolism of macrophages
  and T cells in the TME, and oral NaBi enhances the antitumor effect of oAd-αCD47.
