caption: miRNA regulation of TGF-β and JAK-STAT3 signal transduction pathways during
  Th17 cell differentiation. The initial activation of Th17 cell differentiation is
  driven by the synergistic effect of JAK-STAT3 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)
  signaling, which induce RORγt expression in naïve CD4+ T cells via two distinct
  mechanisms. JAK-STAT3 signaling is initiated by IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23. Dendritic
  cells (DCs) are the primary source of IL-23, and DC production of IL-23 is inhibited
  by miR-29 (, ) and miR-10 (). Cytokine receptors on Th17 cells can also be inhibited
  by miRNAs. For example, miR-30a () inhibits IL-21R; miR-34a () and miR-326 () inhibit
  IL-23R; and miR-34a (), miR-1299 (), and miR-124 () inhibit IL-6R. Additionally,
  miR-30a-5p () and miR-1246 () target gp130, a component of the functional IL-6 family
  receptor complex. JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 occurs after cytokine receptor
  activation and is inhibited at various steps by SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS3. miR-155
  (), miR-384 (), and miR-301a () target SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS3, respectively. Finally,
  STAT3 is directly inhibited by miR-29a-3p, miR-93-5p (), miR-21-5p (), and miR-20b
  (). The TGF-β signal transduction pathway involves the sequential phosphorylation
  of Smad 2, 3, and 4, which ultimately induce IL-17 transcription. Smad7 and SNIP1
  negatively regulate TGF-β signal transduction and are targeted by miRNA. Specifically,
  miR-21 () and miR-181c () inhibit Smad7, and miR-301a () inhibits SNIP1. Finally,
  miR-18 () can target Smad4. Of note, miR-30a () targets IRF4, another transcription
  factor required for the induction of ROR and IL-17A. Each of these pathways affects
  the expression of IL-17 in Th17 cells. Arrow heads indicate a downstream response,
  and blunt lines indicate inhibition. TGF-βR, transforming growth factor-β receptor;

  description: miRNA regulation of TGF-β and JAK-STAT3 signal transduction pathways
    during Th17 cell differentiation. The initial activation of Th17 cell differentiation
    is driven by the synergistic effect of JAK-STAT3 and transforming growth factor-β
    (TGF-β) signaling, which induce RORγt expression in naïve CD4+ T cells via two
    distinct mechanisms. JAK-STAT3 signaling is initiated by IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23.
    Dendritic cells (DCs) are the primary source of IL-23, and DC production of IL-23
