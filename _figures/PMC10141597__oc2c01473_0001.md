caption: Experimental framework for profiling GC-like B cell responses to glycoconjugate
  vaccine candidates. (a) Schematic of strategies for preparing designer glycoconjugate
  vaccine candidates (left) and evaluating their immunogenicity in mice and in synthetic
  immune organoids (right). Glycoengineered bacteria enable the assembly of a single
  O-PS repeat unit (a tetrasaccharide structure in the case of F. tularensis Schu
  S4) on a undecaprenol lipid carrier in the cytoplasmic membrane, which is subsequently
  flipped into the periplasm and polymerized to form variable-length O-PS antigens
  by the endogenous Wzx flippase and Wzy O-antigen polymerase Wzy, respectively. In
  the presence of C. jejuni PglB (CjPglB), the lipid-linked O-PS is site-specifically
  transferred to asparagine residues in recombinant carrier proteins bearing a DQNAT
  motif. Schematic created with BioRender.com. (b) Immunoblot analysis of purified
  carrier proteins derived from E. coli CLM24 cells carrying a plasmid encoding either
  MBP4xDQNAT or CRM1974xDQNAT along with plasmid pGAB2 encoding the FtO-PS biosynthetic
  pathway and with (+) or without (−) plasmid pMAF10 encoding CjPglB as indicated.
  Blots were probed with anti-FLAG antibody to detect acceptor proteins (green signal)
  and FB11 antibody to detect FtO-PS antigens (red signal). Images depict an overlay
  of anti-FLAG and FB11 blots. Arrows denote aglycosylated (agly) and multiply glycosylated
  (gly) forms of MBP4xDQNAT and CRM1974xDQNAT. Molecular weight (MW) markers are indicated
  on the left. Results are representative of three biological replicates.
