caption: Schematic representation of the links between chronic inflammation, oxidative
  stress, DNA damages and carcinogenesis. The figure represents the different mechanisms
  involved by chronic inflammation and resulting in dysregulation of immune response,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA damages, and subsequently the initiation
  of carcinogenesis.
