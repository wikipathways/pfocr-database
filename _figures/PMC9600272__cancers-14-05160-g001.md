caption: 'Molecular structure of the ERBB2/HER2 receptor and the mechanism of action
  of novel therapeutic agents. (a) Monoclonal antibodies that target binding to the
  extracellular structural domain of HER2, including single-epitope monoclonal antibodies
  (trastuzumab, pertuzumab) and bispecific HER2 antibodies (ZW25, ZW49). The antitumor
  effects of these drugs are mediated through a variety of mechanisms: inhibition
  of downstream signaling pathways, involvement in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  or inhibition of receptor dimerization. (b) Antibody-drug conjugates targeting HER2,
  such as trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, release and deliver cytotoxic
  drugs while binding antibodies and thus exert anti-tumor effects. (c) Small molecule
  inhibitors, such as neratinib and tucatinib, inhibit activation of the PI3K pathway
  by binding to the tyrosine-kinase domain of the HER2 receptor. (d,e) HER2-targeted
  immunotherapies, such as HER2-specific chimeric antigen receptor immune cells or
  modified oncolytic virus, enhance immune cell activity and stimulate anti-tumor
  immune responses. (f) Tumor-targeting nanoparticles, such as nanodelivery systems
  with internal encapsulation of tamoxifen and external loading of anti-HER2 antibodies,
  can efficiently kill HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells by penetrating the
  tumor microenvironment.'
