caption: Liver apoptosis plays several roles in NAFLD progression. Factors such as
  high glucose levels or cellular dysfunction, including reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production, ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress signaling pathways, contribute to the expression of Bax. Mechanistically,
  PERK-mediated CHOP expression induced Bax mRNA expression, which is one of inducers
  on mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. After mitochondrial
  dysfunction occurs cytochrome C releasement required caspase-3 and cleaved PARP
  ex-pression. In addition, damaged mitochondria produce mtROS and mtROS activated
  STING/IRF3 phosphorylation-mediated BAX mRNA expression. In addition, complex with
  SRSF6 and DRAK2 induced abnormal mRNA production of Polg2, Rnasel, and Nme4 and
  its abnormal form induced mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis.
  Moreover, AMPK activation sup-pressed cleaved caspase-6-mediated apoptosis signaling
  pathway. NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; CHOP, c/EBP homologous protein;
  mtROS, mitochondrial ROS; STING, stimulator of interferon gene; IRF3, interferon
  regulatory factor 3; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase
