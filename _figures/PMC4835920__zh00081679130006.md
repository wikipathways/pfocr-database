caption: Schematic representation of the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway as a common regulator
  of bone and muscle cells. In osteoclast, RANK/RANKL interaction regulates osteoclastogenesis
  and/or cell apoptosis through modulation of SERCA activity, Ca2+ oscillation, and
  Ca2+-calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and NF-κB pathways.
  Muscle cells also express RANK, and RANK/RANKL interaction is an important regulator
  of SERCA activity and Ca2+ storage in fast-twitch EDL muscles. These results highlight
  the importance of a common signaling pathway opening potentially new treatment for
  both skeletal muscle and bone.
