caption: The non-canonical manners of PDK1 activation pathways in BC. Firstly, AMIGO2
  interacted with PDK1 by directly binding with PH domain to govern BC cell survival
  and angiogenesis via activating the AKT pathway. Secondly, PDK1 was proven to be
  a cytoplasmic–nuclear shuttling protein stimulated by IGF-1 or PTEN loss in the
  form of mPDK1Δ382–391. Moreover, nuclear PDK1 colocalizing with AKT, which inhibited
  FOXO3, a transcriptional activity with nuclear localization, was further proved
  to not only strengthen nuclear pAKT expression and downregulate the transcription
  of p27 Kip1 in FOXO3α-dependent pattern but also enhance cell growth and proliferation
  of BC cells. In terms of the latter, activated IGF-1 R/PDK1 signaling was described
  to reinforce the MCF-7 cells’ growth in nude rats stimulated by light at night,
  which could be blocked by depleting PDK1. In addition, PDK1 was involved in modulating
  ROCK1 to impair the cortical actin organization and cell motility of MTLn3 cells,
  in which PDK1 depletion was responsible for the competitive binding of RhoE to ROCK1.
  Furthermore, activated PDK1 was described to not only facilitate KRAS/PIK3 CA comutation-driven
  carcinogenesis in MCF10 A cells or MYC-driven oncogenic transformation of immortalized
  human mammary epithelial cells via PDK1/PLK1/MYC signaling, but also promote HRG/ERBB2-induced
  enhanced transformation of BC cells via AKT/TSC2/mTOR. Noteworthily, PDK1 was reported
  to regulate EGF-induced PLCγ1 Tyr783 phosphorylation of MDA-MB-231 cells, which
  was referred to as PDK1-dependent PLCγ1 activation, and the interaction PDK1–PLCγ1
  played an important role in cancer cell invasion. Interestingly, the PDK1–SGK1 axis
  was not only shown to overcome AKT inhibition by activating mTORC1 via directly
  phosphorylating TSC2 in PI3 Kα inhibitor-resistant BC cells, but was also involved
  in tamoxifen resistance of MCF-7 cells induced by TCRP1. Finally, miR-181 c was
  observed to negatively regulate targetable PDK1 in BC cells via suppressing cofilin
  phosphorylation, resulting in the disruption of the blood–brain barrier; however,
  another study reported that PDK1 was involved in promoting glucose metabolism via
  PIK3 R1-PDK1/AKT-FOXO3, a pathway regulated by miR-155.
