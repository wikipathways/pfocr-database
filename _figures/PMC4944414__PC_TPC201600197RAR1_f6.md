caption: Heterologous Expression of Barley DMH Suggests Its Biochemical Activity and
  Leads to a Revised β-Diketone Biosynthesis Pathway.(A) Lipid analysis of DMH-expressing
  bacteria revealed two compounds not present in the control (C15 2-ketone and C15
  2-alkanol). In addition, C14 3-hydroxy acid increased in Hv-DMH-expressing cells.
  C15 2-ketone is a key intermediate most probably derived from decarboxylation (spontaneous
  upon  heating) of C16 3-ketoacid, the DMH reaction product. Values indicate the
  mean ± sd of n = 5 biological replicates. *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.005. Relative peak
  area = compound peak area/internal standard peak area.(B) Revised β-diketone biosynthesis
  pathway based on the evidence presented in the current study. Sequential arrows
  stand for possible sequential enzymatic reactions. Dashed arrows represent reactions
  that explain the E. coli findings; however, it is not clear whether or not they
  also occur in planta. DMP, DMH, and DMC are shown in blue. WES and CYP96B30, which
  were found to be located within the cluster region in the wild emmer wheat Zavitan
  reference genome, are shown in yellow. Enzymes from the  system are shown in gray.
  Methylketones, 2-alkanols, and 2-alkanol esters that require DMH are shown in light
  green. β-Diketones and hydroxy-β-diketones that require DMH, DMP, and DMC (DMC only
  for hydroxy-β-diketones) are shown in light pink. Alkylresorcinol predicted biosynthesis
  pathway is shown in light purple, based on . Spont., spontaneous; a, n, m, x, and
  y are placeholders to designate chain length variation.
