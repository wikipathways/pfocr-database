caption: Simplified schematics of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in melanoma and the clinical
  compounds available for their inhibition. In the absence of BRAF mutations, receptor
  tyrosine kinases are activated by their ligands and activate RAS and PI3K. RAS then
  activates the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade which eventually provides survival,
  proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis advantages to melanoma tumors. BRAF mutant
  melanoma cells are sensitive to BRAF inhibitors but resistance can occur via a RAF
  isoform switch and other compensatory pathways. Combinatorial approaches targeting
  more than one molecule within one pathway or several pathways simultaneously need
  to be carefully investigated as potential treatment options for melanomas refractory
  to BRAF inhibitors. Compounds targeting the MAPK and PI3K pathways, and currently
  being tested in clinic trials, are indicated.
