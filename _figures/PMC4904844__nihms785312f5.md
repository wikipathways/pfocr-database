caption: Interaction network of 135 SNO-modified proteins identified in WT and AD
  mouse brain tissues. Some example KEGG pathways are circled by dished ovals and
  zoomed-in to show the differences of the network patterns between WT and AD. The
  p-value and number of proteins in each pathway are provided. Network analysis was
  performed using STRING (version 10) with confidence view and confidence score of
  0.700. No text mining was used. Uniprot accession numbers are uploaded to STRING
  and return as gene symbols.
