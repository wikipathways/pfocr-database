caption: Under normal conditions, the carboxy terminal tails of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2
  interact, which enables calcium entry into the cell. This further stimulates the
  release of calcium from the calcium stores inside the cell. In the presence of high,
  steady state levels of calcium, calcium-stimulated phosphodiesterases are capable
  of degrading cAMP into AMP, thereby controlling the cAMP levels in the cell. The
  low levels of cAMP are unable to stimulate MAPK pathway. In polycystic kidneys,
  however, the resulting abnormality in cysto-proteins causes a lower level of intracellular
  calcium. Hence, the activity of phosphodiesterases is not stimulated and cAMP level
  increases, leading to activation of B-Raf of MAPK pathway.
