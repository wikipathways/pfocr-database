caption: Genomic alterations in the cyclin pathway in patients with cancer. Schematic
  representation of genes that are part of the cyclin pathway, including their relationship
  with the mitotic cycle and transition from G1 to S phase. Genes that are shaded
  in light gray may suffer genomic alterations that can lead to cyclin pathway upregulation.
  Alterations in genes that could lead to resistance to cyclin inhibitors (supplemental
  online Table ) are shaded in red. Numbers in brackets are the frequencies of genomic
  alterations in each gene detected in the current study in the overall population
  of 190,247 solid tumors. Dotted arrows reflect inhibition of target.
