caption: Proposed model depicting the role of IFI35 in negative regulation of RIG-I
  signaling. For the sake of simplicity, we show only the ubiquitin-mediated degradation
  pathway. Viruses such as VSV and SeV are recognized by RIG-I, which signals through
  downstream factors (IRF-3/IRF-7) leading to production of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β).
  IFN-α/β in turn induce the synthesis of ISGs, including IFI35, which interacts with
  RIG-I and inhibits its activation by promoting K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. The identity of the associated E3 ubiquitin ligase is unknown at this
  time. The negative-feedback loop mediated by IFI35 leads to downregulation of the
  host antiviral response.
