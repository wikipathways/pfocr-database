caption: The proposed heme biosynthesis machinery of Mtb. Sequence homology-based
  searches and domain mapping suggest that Mtb harbors the complete heme biosynthesis
  machinery. The heme biosynthesis pathway in bacteria (e.g., E. coli) usually starts
  with glutamate and is processed through the intermediate 5-amino-levulinate, and
  through uroporphyrinogen-III, a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of
  different tetrapyrrole compounds such as vitamin B12. Decarboxylation directs uroporphyrinogen-III
  towards the synthesis of heme through other intermediates such as coproporphyrinogen
  III and protoporphyrinogen IX. Mtb harbors a gene with significant homology to HemN
  (Rv2388), which codes for an oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase,
  and can convert coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX during the transition
  from the aerobic to anaerobic phase. Protoporphyrinogen IX contains an iron–sulfur
  cluster and is able to break S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) into L-methionine and
  a 5'-deoxyadenosineyl radical. The radical attacks coproporphyrinogen III and brings
  about the conversion to protoporphyrinogen IX. Protoporphyrinogen IX is then oxidized
  to protoporphyrin IX by a protoporphyrinogen oxidase, HemY (Rv2677). HemQ (Rv2676c)
  possesses minimal peroxidase activity, but as a catalase it has a turnover of over
  104 min−1 and is likely to be required to eliminate hydrogen peroxide that is generated
  by each turnover of HemY (). Finally, ferrochelatase (HemZ) catalyzes the protoporphyrin
  IX chelation of ferrous iron to form protoheme. However, the physiological relevance
  of both heme synthesizing and heme acquiring mechanisms in Mtb is not yet understood.
  Since the final step of heme biosynthesis requires iron to be inserted into the
  protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) ring, it may be possible that Mtb synthesizes heme only
  during establishment of infection. (To see this illustration in color the reader
