caption: Cofactor biosynthetic pathways in CLEAA. Arrows represent each step catalyzed
  by the named enzymes in each pathway. Cofactors are within yellow boxes. Question
  marks indicate enzymes for which no genes were found in the CLEAA genome. Green
  indicates genes involved in the conversion of chorismate to PABA, with phylogeny
  estimation indicating pabA was acquired from Alphaproteobacteria (supplementary
  table S2, supplementary Material online).
