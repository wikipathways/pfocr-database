caption: 'Pathways of autophagy induction by hypoxia and mutant RAS. (A) During hypoxia,
  autophagy is activated by sensors that detect low oxygen, unfolded proteins, and
  energy depletion. Low oxygen induces autophagy involving the HIF1α-mediated up-regulation
  of BNIP3 and BNIP3L. They compete with Bcl-2 for interaction with Beclin 1, and
  orient Beclin 1 to autophagosomes. AMPK is a major regulator of energy homeostasis.
  The kinase is sensitive to the AMP/ATP ratio: binding of AMP activates AMPK and
  induces phosphorylation by the tumor suppressor LKB1. Activation of AMPK inhibits
  mTOR-dependent signaling. Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy. In addition, autophagy
  may be induced during hypoxia as a result of signals generated by the PERK-ATF4
  mediated unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. (B) The induction
  of autophagy by oncogenes such as mutant Ras is importance in tumorigenesis. Ras
  mutant activates the ROS-dependent JNK signaling pathway and upregulates the Atg5
  gene to induce autophagy. Under certain circumstances, Ras mutant activates the
  MEK/ERK signaling pathway and upregulates the Beclin1 gene to induce autophagic
  cell death.'
