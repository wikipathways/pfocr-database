caption: Proposed mechanism of action for APC-targeted LNP–mRNA. The interaction between
  targeted mRNA–lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) occurs
  through specific ligands that engage with receptors on the APC surface. This receptor
  engagement can initiate the production of interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines
  or chemokines (1). Following this, the LNP–mRNA complex is internalized through
  endocytosis (2), allowing the mRNA within the endosome to engage with membrane-bound
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (3). The activation of TLRs triggers signaling pathways
  that lead to the production of Type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines (4). Subsequently,
  the mRNA escapes the endosome and is released into the cytosol, where it can be
  translated by ribosomes (5). The resulting protein may be secreted outside the host
  cell (7a) and taken up by other APCs (8a), where it is processed into peptides for
  presentation on MHC class II molecules (9), facilitating recognition by CD4+ T lymphocytes
  (10). Alternatively, the translated proteins can be degraded into peptides by the
  proteasome within the same cell (6). These antigenic peptides are transported into
  the endoplasmic reticulum and can be loaded onto MHC class I and/or class II molecules
  through a less common pathway (7b). The complexes formed by MHC–peptide epitopes
  are then presented on the APC surface, where they can bind to the T cell receptor
  (TCR) of CD8+ and/or CD4+ T lymphocytes (8b). Reprinted with permission from Ref.
