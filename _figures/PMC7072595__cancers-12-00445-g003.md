caption: Schematic diagram of multiple mechanisms of SFRP1 involvement in Wnt signaling
  pathway. (A) SFRP1 inhibits Wnt activity by directly binding to the ligand of Wnt
  protein through its netrin (NTR) domain. (B) SFRP1 antagonizes the Wnt signaling
  pathway by bypassing the interaction with the Wnt ligand and directly binding to
  the cytoplasmic β-catenin. (C) SFRP1 binds directly with the Fz receptor through
  the cycteine-rich domain (CRD) motif preventing the binding of Wnt ligands to the
  receptor. This causes the β-catenin molecules to combine with the destruction complex
  and undergo phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β) and casein kinase
  (CK1). The phosphorylated β-catenin triggers ubiquitination by β-TrCP and initiates
  proteasomal degradation. (D) In the absence of SFRP1, the Wnt ligand binds to the
  Fz receptor and results in the recruitment of Dvl and destruction complex to the
  membrane. The destruction complex is inactivated by Dvl polymers and leads to the
  accumulation of β-catenin molecules in the cytoplasm. Then, the accumulated β-catenin
  molecules enter the nucleus and recruit histone-modifying coactivators, Pygo and
  Bcl-9, to activate Wnt target genes’ transcription.
