caption: Schematic representation of proposed intracellular and extracellular effects
  of S100B in cardiac myocytes. Norepinephrine (NE) activation of the calcium-dependent
  protein kinase C (PKC)-β, mediated by the α 1-adrenergic receptor, phosphorylates
  (P) transcriptional enhancer factor (1) TEF-1, resulting in DNA binding and transactivation
  of the β-myosin heavy chain promoter. By contrast, S100B induction by NE and other
  hypertrophic signals (not shown) results in calcium-dependent block of PKC-β phosphorylation
  of TEF-1 and inhibition of β-MHC transcription. S100B can also induce apoptosis
  intracellularly via a inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-NO pathway or it can
  be secreted and via activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products
  (RAGE) (extracellular components V and CI), and induce apoptosis via MEK-ERK1/2-p53
  signaling.
