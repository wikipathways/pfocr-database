caption: TLR signalling - TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 are expressed on
  the surface of the cell whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 in intracellular vesicles
  like endosome and lysosomes. All TLRs except TLR3 activates MyD88 pathway, TLR3
  and TLR4 activate TRIF pathway. When ligand binds to the TLR receptors, adaptor
  molecules MyD88 and TRIF bind to the TIR domain either directly or indirectly via
  bridge molecules TIRAP and TRAM. MyD88 now recruits IRAK4 which in turn phosphorylate
  and activate IRAK1/2. The activated IRAKs now interact with TRAF6. This IRAK-TRAF6
  complex recruits and activates TAK1. It also gets activated directly by MyD88 and
  RIP1. Activated TAK1 activates IKK complex and MAPKs. IKK complex phosphorylates
  and subsequently degrade Iκβ by proteasomes leading to release of transcription
  factor (TF) NF-κβ whereas activated MAPKs releases transcription factor AP1 by activating
  JNK1/2 and p38. These TFs translocate into the nucleus and bind to their corresponding
  TF binding segment on the DNA to induce transcription of cytokines, chemokines,
  interferons, interleukins etc. In TRIF pathway, TRIF binds to TIR domain via bridge
  molecule TRAM. TRIF binds TRAF3 and TRAF6. By binding to TRAF6 it normally activates
  MyD88 pathway whereas by binding with TRAF3 it activates TKB1 which further phosphorylates
  and activates IRF3 and IRF7. Their homodimers enter nucleus and binds to its binding
  segment on DNA and transcribe IFN-α and IFN-β.
