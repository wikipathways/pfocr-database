caption: Schematic presentation of how the rs17228616 single-nucleotide polymorphism
  (SNP) in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene may affect the vulnerability to stress.
  This SNP interrupts miRNA-608/AChE interaction, leading to (1) elevated brain AChE
  activity and thus reduced cholinergic signaling, (2) reduction in the GABAergic
  modulator CDC42, limiting the inhibitory GABAergic signaling and (3) reduced IL-6
  levels, effecting inflammatory pathways. Together, these signaling pathway impairments
  may enhance amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli of minor allele individuals
  due to insufficient suppression of stress-related increases in cholinergic signaling
  and reduced inhibitory GABAergic signaling. As a coping mechanism under trauma load,
  these individuals over-recruit the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to downregulate
  the amygdala, and thus develop limited posttraumatic stress syndrome. Broken arrows
  represent reduced inhibitory input. The effects of this SNP, of stress exposure
  and of SNP-exposure interactions are represented by black, purple and striped black/purple
  arrows, respectively. IL-6, interleukin 6; miRNA, micro RNA.
