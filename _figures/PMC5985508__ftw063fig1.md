caption: Schematic of S1P signaling. S1P is a blood-borne lipid mediator. It is less
  abundant in tissue fluids. This results in an S1P gradient, which is important in
  immune cell trafficking. Most of the biological effects of S1P are mediated by signaling
  through the cell surface receptors (S1P1–5), which are coupled to heterotrimeric
  G proteins and Rac or Rho to control various downstream signaling effectors. In
  the vascular system, S1P regulates angiogenesis, vascular stability and permeability.
  In the immune system, it is a major regulator of trafficking of T and B cells. S1P
  interaction with its receptor is needed for the egress of immune cells from the
  lymphoid organs (such as thymus and lymph nodes) into the lymphatic vessels. S1P
  is generated by the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine by the enzyme ceramidase.
  The subsequent conversion of sphingosine to S1P is catalyzed by SKs 1 and 2. S1P
  is cleaved irreversibly to hexadecenal and PE, by S1P lyase, which is the degradation
  pathway.
