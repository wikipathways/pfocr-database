caption: PVAT (perivascular adipose tissue) regulates vascular tone through relaxing
  factors and contractile factors. PVAT adipocytes express CBS (cystathionine β-synthase),
  CSE (cystathionine γ-lyase) and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase). CBS and
  CSE catalyze generation of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) from cysteine, which induces VSMC
  (vascular smooth muscle cells) dilation by opening BKCa (calcium activated K+-channels)
  on VSMC, and eNOS-dependent NO production from L-arginine which induces vasodilation
  mediated by the cGMP signaling pathway. Additionally, EFS (electrical field stimulation)
  induces PVAT adipocytes to release adiponectin, PGI2 and CGRP which induce vasodilation
  as well. On the other side, EFS induces PVAT release of 5-HT, dopamine and norepinephrine
  which cause VSMC contraction thorough adrenergic receptors (AdR) on VSMC. EFS also
  induces VSMC contraction by stimulating secretion of PGF2a, chemerin and O2.- from
  PVAT adipocytes. Additionally, PVAT adipocyte-derived calpastatin might induce VSMC
  contraction mediated by Cav1.2 channels on VSMC.
