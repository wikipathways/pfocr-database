caption: Analysis of hormonal metabolic pathways of differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) involved in lateral bud differentiation. (a) Auxin synthesis pathway; (b)
  Abscisic acid synthesis pathway; (c) Cytokinin synthesis pathway; (d) Jasmonic acid
  synthesis pathway; (d) Metabolic pathway of gibberellin, ethylene, brassinosteroid,
  and salicylic acid. The FPKM ratio of unigene expression was represented on a logarithmic
  scale for each treatment (T, L, K). Red indicated that a gene was up-regulated at
  that stage, whereas green indicated down-regulated expression. The heat map was
  conducted by morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/).
