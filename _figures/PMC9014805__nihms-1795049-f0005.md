caption: Summary of formaldehyde-induced DNA damage and repair. Endogenous formaldehyde
  can produce different lesions, such as single-strand (SSB) and double-strand DNA
  breaks (DSB), DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), base lesions, and DNA inter- and intra-strand
  crosslinks. Specialized DNA repair pathways are activated following formaldehyde-induced
  DNA damage to safeguard genome stability. Formaldehyde-DNA-induced lesions are repaired
  by DNA damage response repair pathway (DDR), homologous recombination (HR), nucleotide
  excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER) and translesion synthesis (TLS).
  DPCs are predominantly resolved by DPCs-proteolysis repair systems that involve
  SPRTN and Wss1/2, the Fanconi complex and the proteasome system.
