caption: Diagram Showing the Hypothetical Action of Elevated Levels of NAE on Seedling
  Growth and Its Relationship to ABA Action.NAE arrests seedling growth via a pathway
  dependent upon ABI1, ABI2, ABI3, and ABI5, and this is associated with upregulation
  of ABA-responsive genes, such as At HVA22b, CRA1, RAB18, EXGT-A4, ATEM1, and LEAM17.
  This suppression of seedling growth is reminiscent of the ABA-induced secondary
  dormancy program discovered by Chua and coworkers (), which is operable in young
  seedlings. We propose that NAE12:0 intersects the ABA signaling pathway downstream
  from ABA and that ABI3 expression is key to the suppression of growth induced by
  NAE metabolism. Independent of ABA signaling, NAE12:0 can influence gene expression
  in seeds and seedlings and suppress seedling growth. Ectopic overexpression of FAAH
  can reverse the growth suppression by NAE, but the interaction with ABA signaling
  in FAAH overexpressors is complex since FAAH overexpressors are hypersensitive to
  ABA. By contrast, the situation with abi mutants is more straightforward because
  they exhibited partial tolerance to NAE12:0 in addition to their ABA-tolerant phenotypes.
