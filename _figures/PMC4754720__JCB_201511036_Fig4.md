caption: 'Metabolic regulation of mitochondrial transport and mitophagy. (A) In mammals,
  mitochondrial transport is primarily mediated by microtubule-dependent motors, such
  as kinesin for anterograde movement. Kinesin-1 attaches to mitochondria via its
  adaptor (Milton) and receptor (Miro). The Miro–Milton–kinesin complex allows for
  organelle movement under basal conditions. (1) At active synapses of neurons, increased
  Ca2+ levels result in pausing of mitochondria to supply local ATP to drive energy-intensive
  processes such as synaptic vesicle recycling. Depending on the model, Ca2+ loading
  of the EF-hands of Miro is followed by either release of the Miro–Milton–kinesin
  complex from the microtubule or anchoring of the mitochondrion via syntaphilin.
  (2) Elevated glucose levels also promote stalling, caused by O-GlcNAc transferase
  (OGT)-mediated glycosylation of Milton. Although glycosylated Milton is depicted
  in the syntaphilin model, this is for convenience; the precise method by which glycosylation
  of Milton mediates stalling is unclear. This regulatory pathway may allow mitochondria
  to be positioned at locations of nutrient abundance, increasing their efficiency
  of ATP generation. (B) Multiple mechanisms for regulation of mitophagy have been
  proposed: (1) Mitochondrial damage leading to loss of membrane potential (ΔΨm) causes
  Pink1 accumulation (not depicted), followed by Parkin recruitment and ubiquitination
  of multiple outer membrane proteins. These events activate the outer membrane for
  processing via the proteasome system (UPS), followed by targeting to autophagosome
  membranes. (2) Severe energy depletion leads to activation of AMPK, followed by
  phosphorylation and activation of the autophagy regulator ULK1. ULK1 is then able
  to activate generalized autophagy, including mitophagy. (3) Hypoxia is able to activate
  mitophagy via the dephosphorylation of FUNDC1 (on the outer membrane) by the PGAM5
  phosphatase. Dephosphorylated FUNDC1 serves to recruit LC3 and autophagosomal membranes.
  (4) Through unknown mechanisms, enhanced OXPHOS activity in the mitochondrion recruits
  the autophagy regulator Rheb to the outer membrane receptor Nix. Mitochondrially-localized
  Rheb then promotes autophagy via recruitment of LC3 molecules.'
