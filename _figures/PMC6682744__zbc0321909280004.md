caption: Anti-adaptor regulation of RpoS degradation. A, three differently characterized
  anti-adaptors are shown in green, with their known upstream transcriptional regulators.
  The regulator mediating the response to DNA damage is not known. B, pathway for
  adaptor-mediated degradation of RpoS and anti-adaptor regulation of this process
  is shown. RpoS (σS) is shown in yellow. Adaptor RssB is shown in blue, both in phosphorylated
  and unphosphorylated form. The ClpXP protease is shown in gray; the details of binding
  of RpoS and RssB to ClpXP are not fully understood.
