caption: 'roGFP2 interactions with the glutathione system (adapted from Meyer and
  Dick 2010). Glutathione peroxidases (GPx) oxidize GSH to GSSG in response to peroxides,
  including H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), thus increasing the glutathione
  redox potential (EGSH). Abbreviations: LOH, reduced lipid oxide; Se–, reduced selenocyteine;
  SeOH, oxidized selenocyteine; SeSG, glutathionylated selenocysteine. In response
  to the increase in GSSG, one of the engineered vicinal cysteines of roGFP2 becomes
  S-glutathionylated by glutaredoxin (Grx). Glutathionylation in turn causes disulfide
  bond formation and alteration of the spectral properties of the GFP fluorophore.
  In the reductive pathway, Grx catalyzes the reduction of roGFP2 disulfide bonds
  through deglutathionylation as GSSG levels decrease and normal levels of GSH are
  reestablished by glutathione reductase (GR), at the expense of NADPH, causing a
  renormalization of EGSH. Glucose and the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) create
  NADPH, which is used by GR to reduce GSSG to GSH.'
