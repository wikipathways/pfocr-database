caption: 'Refined model of the ERK signaling network. A, our previous model focused
  on quantifying cross-talk from PI3K-dependent signaling impinging upon the canonical
  Ras/ERK pathway and included two ERK-dependent negative feedback loops: desensitization
  of Ras-GEF recruitment and up-regulation of MKP/DUSP activity. The model also quantitatively
  accounted for endocytosis of activated PDGF receptor dimers as an ERK-independent
  attenuation mechanism. B, present study additionally accounts for ERK-dependent
  feedback impinging on Ras- and PI3K-dependent MEK kinase activities and includes
  depletion of PDGF from the extracellular medium. The experimental readouts used
  to constrain each model are indicated in italics (A and B).'
