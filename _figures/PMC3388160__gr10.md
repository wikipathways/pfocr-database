caption: 'Schematic of a working model for integrin regulation of IPF fibroblast proliferation.
  Left: In response to control fibroblast interaction with fibrillar collagen, high
  α2β1 integrin expression activates PP2A, promoting dephosphorylation and activation
  of its target substrate GSK-3β. This causes inactivation of β-catenin and suppression
  of proliferation. Right: During IPF fibroblast interaction with fibrillar collagen,
  low α2β1 integrin expression fails to appropriately activate PP2A. This causes an
  accumulation of phosphorylated (inactive) GSK-3β promoting activation of β-catenin
  and pathological proliferation. Note that data from additional studies indicate
  that certain growth factors, such as TGFβ, also activate proliferation signaling
  pathways in IPF fibroblasts Thus, available data indicate that a collaboration between
  matrix and growth factors controls the abnormal proliferation of IPF fibroblasts.'
