caption: Model of redox homeostasis and metabolic changes during the adaptation to
  proteasome inhibitors. Excessive proteotoxic stress is the major mechanism of cytotoxicity
  of proteasome inhibitors in myeloma. The level of proteotoxic stress results from
  the degree of imbalance between proteasomal load and proteasomal proteolytic capacity.
  The proteasomal load of misfolded protein is tightly connected to the protein-folding
  capacity of the ER, which in turn relies on proper redox conditions. NAD(P)H is
  critical for providing oxidizing equivalents and thus for minimizing the proteasomal
  load in proteasome inhibitor-adapted myeloma cells that are viable with extremely
  low proteasome activity while producing high paraprotein amounts. NAD(P)H is mostly
  provided from intermediates of the TCA (Krebs Cycle), for example, malate–pyruvate
  and mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase reactions, which we found consistently
  upregulated in proteasome inhibitor-adapted myeloma cells. In line with this, multiple
  other enzymes that are involved in NAD(P)H generation were upregulated, while enzymes
  mediating lipid biosynthesis from Acetyl-CoA, which removes tricarboxylic acid intermediates
  from the Krebs Cycle and thus decreases NAD(P)H generation, are downregulated. This
  way, we hypothesize that maximum NAD(P)H-producing intermediates may be provided,
  limiting proteotoxic stress in adapted/resistant cells. Cancer cells often use the
  faster, but less efficient, pathway for ATP production to generate ATP via pyruvate–lactate
  conversion (Warburg effect). When this is inhibited using the specific inhibitor
  of LDHA, FX-11, the sensitivity of myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors decreases,
  presumably because glucose metabolism entirely switches to the TCA cycle, increasing
  NAD(P)H production and reducing proteotoxic stress. Upregulation of ABCB1 decreases
  proteotoxic stress via reduced intracellular concentrations of proteasome inhibitors,
  which can be reversed by specific ABCB1 inhibitors Verapamil or Reserpine. ABCB1,
