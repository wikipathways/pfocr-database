caption: Model for cellular function of steroid-17,20-desmolase. Functional characterization
  of the desC gene (yellow) product supports our hypothesis that the transketolase
  encoded by the desAB genes (red, orange) encode steroid-17,20-desmolase, which proceeds
  by transketolation. Transketolases are TPP-dependent, and we observe an upregulation
  of genes involved in TPP synthesis. The desD gene (green) is predicted to encode
  a cortisol transport protein, and an ABC-type transporter was identified (500-fold
  induction; blue) which could serve to pump 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione out of the
  cell. We also observed several pentose phosphate pathway genes upregulated, suggesting
  that the two-carbon side chain might enter the pentose phosphate pathway. We hypothesize
  that the 20α-HSDH encoded by the desC gene regulates flux of the two-carbon fragment
  into the pentose phosphate pathway, as 20α-hydroxycortisol is not a substrate for
  steroid-17,20-desmolase.
