caption: 'Mitochondrial processes affected in cancer. (A) Summarizes key metabolic
  processes in mitochondria. Metabolites such as glucose, fatty acids (FA) and glutamine
  are transformed into pyruvate, FA-CoA and glutamate and enter the TCA and β-oxidation
  cycles taking place in the mitochondrial matrix. These processes are used by the
  ETC to pump protons into the intermembrane space creating a chemical gradient used
  by complex V to generate ATP in a process called OXPHOS. (B) Summarizes the role
  of the Bcl-2 family proteins in the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. Briefly, apoptotic
  stimuli lead to the formation of the pores in the OMM by Bax and Bak releasing cytochrome
  c into the cytoplasm which triggers the caspase cascade inducing apoptosis. The
  antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family inhibit this process. (C) Summarizes the
  four main mitochondrial dynamics processes: mitochondrial fusion and fission, mitophagy,
  internal cristae architecture, and mitochondrial intracellular trafficking. In cancer,
  all these mitochondrial activities are dysregulated to support cancer energetic
  and biosynthetic demands, as well as survival. Abbreviations used: TCA: tricarboxylic
  acid. ATP: adenosine triphosphate. ETC: electron transport chain. OXPHOS: oxidative
  phosphorylation. I: complex I. II: complex II. III: complex III. IV: complex IV.
  V: complex V. OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane. IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane.
  IMS: intermembrane space. MICOS: mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing
  system. Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed on 31 March 2022).'
