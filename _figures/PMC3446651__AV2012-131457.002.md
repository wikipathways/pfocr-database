caption: Viral proteins inhibit nucleic acid receptors of the intracytosolic innate
  immune response. Viruses inhibit each of the two signals that initiate the inflammasome
  activation process. The first signal—IL-1β and/or IL-18 binding and activation of
  the TLR/IL-1β receptor pathway—is inhibited by soluble IL-1β and IL-18 (from VACV);
  downstream, inhibitors of signaling to NF-κB (from VACV or HCV) repeatedly target
  this important antiviral pathway that optimally requires NF-κB translocation leading
  to the production of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Second, the inflammasome processes
  these pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 proteins via caspase-1 that is itself processed upon
  clustering mediated at the NLRP3 inflammasome upon detection of intracytosolic pathogens.
  This leads to IL-1β and IL-18 production and release that activates the IL-1β/IL-18
  pathway in an autocrine manner, as well as the innate and adaptive immune response.
  Inflammasome activation is inhibited by myxoma virus M013, measles viruses V protein,
  and KSHV vNLR. Finally signaling to IRF3 by intracytosolic DNA or RNA is inhibited
  at the level of MAVS by HCV's NS3/4A and at the level of TBK1 by VACV C6 and N1
  ().
