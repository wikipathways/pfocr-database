caption: Benzo (a)pyrene (BaP) is metabolically activated through oxidation by CYP1A1,
  yielding the highly mutagenic and reactive metabolite, BPDE [155]. Production of
  B(a)P – o - quinones, B(a)P - radical species, and B(a)P – diol - epoxides, like
  BPDE, can create DNA damage by forming covalent BPDE-DNA adducts, contributing towards
  mutagenesis [55,66,67].Quinone compounds, converted from BaP by CYP1A1, produce
  ROS which causes oxidative stress-induced oxidative DNA damage as well as random
  lipid peroxidation, inflicting direct genomic instability [157,158,159]. Oxidative
  stress caused by elevated ROS levels activate NF-κB, stimulating a pulmonary inflammatory
  cascade by inducing transcription of proinflammatory genes [160]. Neutrophil cell
  proliferation at these sites of inflammation can occur due to high cytosolic PCNA
  levels expressed [162]. Oxidative stress-induced Nrf2 activation can also lead to
  greater proliferation and also anti-apoptotic gene expression, both attributes of
  lung carcinogenesis [163]. (Created with BioRender.com)
