caption: Interplay between ROS and senescence. Numerous factors, both exogenous and
  endogenous, can trigger the production of ROS which can eventually lead to the development
  of senescence. Continuous accumulation of senescent cells over time may eventually
  lead to the development of age-related pathologies. Accumulation of dysfunctional
  mitochondria can induce ROS production which is essential for maintaining the senescent
  phenotype. Genotoxic stress from irradiation, chemotherapy and smoking, telomere
  uncapping, overexpression of activated oncogenes contribute to increased ROS production,
  which induce DNA damage resulting in the activation of DDR and the subsequent activation
  of the p53/p21 or/and pRB/p16 pathway, which signal for cell cycle arrest and senescence
  acquisition. ROS also interplay with other factors such as epigenetic modifications,
  mitochondrial dysfunction and telomere attrition to trigger DNA damage and DDR.
  One important characteristic of senescence is the secretion of SASP. ROS have been
  linked to the activation of NF-κB, one of the major transcription factors that can
  promote the transcription of SASP components such as IL-6 and IL-8. Also, Nrf2,
  a transcription factor essential for cellular antioxidant response, encodes for
  proteins involved in antioxidant and glutathione synthesis to reduce ROS production.
  Depending on the cell type and context, at the transcriptional level, NF-κB can
  activate Nrf2 expression due to the presence of several binding sites in the promoter
  region of the NFE2L2 gene. However, NF-κB attenuates Nrf2 activity via mechanisms
  that are Keap-1 (Nrf2 regulator) dependent or independent, such as competition between
  p65 and Nrf2 for co-activator CBP-p300 complex. Notably, crosstalk between cellular
  redox milieu and pro-survival activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has also
  been demonstrated. Numerous findings also suggest that increased expression Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL could direct cells into senescence by preventing apoptosis. Pro-survival
  Bcl-2 phosphorylation could also impair the G1/S cell cycle transition hence potentially
  promoting senescence induction.
