caption: Scr/Exd/Hth complex induces expression of several early transcription factor
  genes, including sage, fkh, CrebA, and Hkb. Some of these transcription factors
  regulate their own expression as well as the expression of other early transcription
  factor genes. They also regulate downstream factors involved in morphogenesis and
  physiological function. Fkh is required to maintain its own expression as well as
  the expression of Sage and CrebA. Fkh regulates unknown targets to mediate the cell
  shape changes required for secretory cells to internalize and form tubes. It also
  regulates genes required for secretory cells to survive. Sage works with Fkh to
  maintain its own expression and the expression of two downstream enzyme-encoding
  genes, PH4αSG1 (indirectly) and PH4αSG2 (directly). These enzymes are required to
  modify target proteins that form the luminal fibrillar matrix that keeps the lumen
  open and uniform. CrebA regulates expression of the secretory pathway component
  genes (SPCGs), which are expressed to high levels in the salivary gland. High-level
  expression of the SPCGs mediates the high level of secretory activity characteristic
  of this tissue. Hkb regulates klar and crb to facilitate the apical membrane expansion
  required for tube elongation. Black arrows indicate regulatory interactions that
  are known or likely to be primarily transcriptional. Black dashed arrows indicate
  interactions that are primarily post-transcriptional.
