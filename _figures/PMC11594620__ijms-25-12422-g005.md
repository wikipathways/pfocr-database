caption: 'Protective role of the HOG pathway against growth defects due to the impairment
  of complex sphingolipid biosynthesis. When complex sphingolipid biosynthesis is
  repressed, the HOG pathway is activated, and the growth defect is restored by transcriptional
  responses mediated by Msn2/4 and Sko1 [130]. Unlike the TORC2/Ypk1 pathway, the
  HOG pathway compensates for cellular dysfunctions secondary to defects in complex
  sphingolipid biosynthesis. The HOG pathway is activated through two independent
  branches, the Sln1 and Sho1 branches [136], and the Sln1 branch mainly functions
  to rescue complex sphingolipid abnormalities. Mutations that cause the activation
  of PKA (pde2∆, ira2∆) promote growth inhibition under impaired complex sphingolipid
  metabolism via three different roots: (1) the suppression of Hog1 phosphorylation,
  (2) the inhibition of Msn2/4 that Hog1 does not mediate, and (3) the enhancement
  of the growth defect that is not mediated by Hog1 and Msn2/4 [137]'
