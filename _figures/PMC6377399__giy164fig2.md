caption: Repeat composition, phylogenomic inferences, and biosynthesis pathway for
  very long-chain fatty acids synthesis in M. oleifera. (a) Genome proportions of
  genic and various repeat sequences. (b) Phylogenetic tree, divergence time, and
  profiles of gene families that underwent expansion or contraction. Bootstrapping
  supports (SH-aLRT/UFBoot) are presented along with the 95% confidence intervals
  for each dating point in brackets. (c) Annotated genes involved in the biosynthesis
  pathway of very long-chain fatty acids (a fatty acid with minimum 22 carbon moieties)
  in M. oleifera.
