caption: Figure 1. Model for the involvement of AtERF73/HRE1 and ADH1 transcripts
  in hypoxia and ethylene-H2O2 mediated pathways. Hypoxia triggers ethylene and H2O2
  production, which increases the accumulation of AtERF73/HRE1 transcripts through
  (I) an ethylene-dependent pathway, (II) an ethylene-independent/H2O2-dependent pathway,
  and (III) an ethylene/H2O2-independent pathway. AtERF73/HRE1 positively regulates
  ADH1 genes and negatively regulates a set of peroxidase and cytochrome P450 genes
  in hypoxia signaling.
