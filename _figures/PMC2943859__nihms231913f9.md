caption: TNF-R1 signaling pathways. Engagement of TNF-R1 by TNF-α induces recruitment
  of TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and c-IAP1/2 to the receptor to form the membrane-bound complex
  I. Two distinct pathways originate from the association of RIP1 and TRAF-2 to the
  receptor. The first one promotes survival by activation of the catalytic IKK complex,
  leading to phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα and its degradation
  via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus
  and initiate transcription of anti-apoptotic target genes, such as cFLIP, cIAP-1,
  cIAP-2, TRAF1, TRAF2, XIAP, and Gadd45β. The second one leads to activation of JNK
  via the consequential activation of MEKK1/3 and MKK4/7. Activation of JNK is usually
  transient due to prompt inhibition by NF-κB-regulated proteins, such as XIAP and
  Gadd45β; however, sustained activation of JNK due to defects in NF-κB transcriptional
  activity results in c-FLIP degradation, enhanced caspase 8 activation, and apoptosis.
  Following the transient formation of complex I, the receptor is internalized by
  endocytosis and RIP1, TRAF2 and TRADD dissociated from TNF-R1, allowing the recruitment
  of FADD and caspase 8. The newly formed cytosolic complex (named complex II) promotes
  the activation of caspase 8, initiating the apoptotic cascade. This apoptotic pathway
  is inhibited by NF-κB-mediated expression of cFLIPL, which binds to caspase 8 and
  prevents its proteolytic activation.
