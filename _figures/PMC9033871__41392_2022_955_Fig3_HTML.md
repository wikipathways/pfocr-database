  cytokines in ECs, VSMCs, and macrophages. In the absence of PCSK9, the LDL–LDLR

  and LDLR is recycled to the cell surface, whereas LDL-C is directed to lysosomes
  for degradation. PCSK9 can mediate internalized LDLR-LDL-C complex to degrade, and
  promote oxLDL-induced inflammation through increasing expression of LOX-1 and TLR4,

  activation of ROS and NF-κB'
