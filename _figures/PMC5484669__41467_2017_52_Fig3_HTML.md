caption: 'Signaling pathways that are key regulators of pluripotency in mESCs. In
  OS25 cells there is a selection for undifferentiated cells (high Oct4-expressing).
  LIF integrates signals into the core regulatory circuitry of pluripotency (Sox2,
  Oct4, and Nanog) via two signaling pathways: Jak-Stat and PI3K-Akt. The Jak-Stat
  pathway activates Klf4, and the PI3K-Akt pathway stimulates the transcription of
  Tbx3, which are both PRCa genes. The MAPK pathway antagonizes the nuclear localization
  of Tbx3. PRCa genes are enriched in Jak-Stat and PI3K-Akt pathways, which show high
  cell-to-cell variation, suggesting a crucial role of PRCs in modulating fluctuations
  in signaling pathways that integrate LIF signals into core transcription factor
  network (Figure adapted from ref. )'
