caption: 'Pictured are various proposed transporters and their predicted transport
  mechanisms: SLC41A1/A2 (channel transport mechanism based on structural homology
  with prokaryotic MgtE transporters); Mrs2, a mitochondrial Mg2+ uptake system that
  transports Mg2+ with ΔΨ (channel transport mechanism based on similarity with yeast
  Alr family); TRPM7 channel kinase (channel transport mechanism), and MagT1 (thought
  to be a plasma membrane Mg2+ transporter with an ion channel transport mechanism).
  Overexpression of either TRPM7 or SLC41A1 in TRPM7-deficient cells allows them to
  grow and proliferate due to Mg2+ transport via the respective overexpressed transporters,
  suggesting they may have some overlap in function. TRPM7 has been implicated to
  regulate lymphocyte growth via rapid onset of PI3K activation and its downstream
  signaling events. MagT1 has been proposed to regulate the PLCγ1 signaling pathway
  in T-lymphocytes, based on studies of human patients with mutations in MagT1. Note
  that Mg2+ transport into both the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus are very poorly
  characterized and hence are pictured simply as passive exchange mechanisms. Although
  the gene for Na+/Mg2+ exchanger (?) has not been cloned, such an exchange mechanism
  has been proposed to exist and mediate Mg2+ efflux in vertebrate cells.'
