caption: Networks of candidate cancer genes predicted by MUFFINN and their direct
  neighbors on HumanNet. Networks are visualized using Cytoscape for a HDAC1, b APEX1,
  c FN1, and d PPM1A. Edge thickness represents edge weight (likelihood of two genes
  being involved in the same pathway) by HumanNet and node color scale represents
  the mutational frequency of each gene, where higher mutation frequency is indicated
  as more reddish color. Genes with no mutation occurrence at all are indicated as
  an empty node. The subjected candidate genes, their neighboring candidate genes,
  and other genes are represented as hexagonal, rectangular, and circular nodes, respectively.
  Genes for each enriched pathway are grouped by a curved box
