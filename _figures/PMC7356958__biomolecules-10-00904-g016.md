caption: A summary of the main NRF2 regulation mechanisms. KEAP1 represents the main
  negative regulatory protein of NRF2 coding its proteasomal degradation to maintain
  its expression at low levels. KEAP1–NRF2 interaction can be blocked by the activity
  of protein–protein inhibitors, MAPKs and p62. Hrd1 also induces NRF2 proteasomal
  degradation, helping its regulation. Once activated, NRF2 induces the expression
  of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and proteostasis-related genes promoting neuronal
  survival. Under pathological conditions, several signals can induce the activation
  of different kinases and factors that negative regulate NRF2 promoting its degradation.
  When this intricate regulatory system is dysregulated by a pathological condition,
  the failure of the NRF2–ARE pathway has been correlated to the advance of the disease.
