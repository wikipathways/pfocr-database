caption: Restoring tumor immunity by blocking the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways.
  At the priming phase, Tregs inhibit the activation of naïve CD8+T cells by consuming
  interleukin-2, which is produced by CD4 + T cells. Effector Tregs suppress the maturation
  of antigen presenting cells through the CTLA-4/B7 pathway. In addition, naïve CD8+T
  cells are inactivated by expressing CTLA-4 on the surface, which binds to B7 on
  antigen presenting cells, resulting in the inhibition of CD8+ T cell activation.
  The anti-CTLA-4 antibody blocks inhibitory signaling by binding to CTLA-4 on naïve
  T cells (①). The anti-PD-L1 antibody blocks inhibitory signaling to PD-L1, expressed
  on activated CD8+ T cells (②). Anti-CTLA-4 inhibits the binding between B7 and CTLA-4
  on the Treg (③). Finally, CD8+ T cells are induced and activated to become CTL (④).
  At the effector phase, PD-L1 is expressed on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating
  macrophages (①). The anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody blocks inhibitory signaling (②). The
  anti-CTLA-4 antibody eliminates Tregs through ADCC at the tumor tissue (③). These
  blockades of the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways restore the antitumor activity of
  CTL in the cancer immune microenvironment. ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity;
  DC, dendritic cell; CTL, cytotoxic T cells; Treg, regulatory T cells.
