  sNPF or glycine and for DN1s there are several candidate peptides (see Figure ).
  Note that the MNCs also produce DILP2 (). (B) The colocalized neuropeptides and
  other signaling molecules in the LNvs may target different constellations of neurons
  within and outside the clock circuitry; these are represented by “other clock neurons”
  and “other neurons,” respectively. The “other neurons” are effectors downstream
  to the clock circuits that regulate, e.g., rhythmic activity in behavior and physiology
  (RA), or neuronal systems that influence other behaviors such as reproduction, foraging
  and feeding (and indirectly metabolism), or produce systemic responses via hormone
  release (OA). In the simplest model, shown in (B), all the target neurons for the
  large and small LNvs express receptors for all of the signal molecules released.
  Thus, targets of s-LNvs within and outside the clock circuit would all express receptors
  (R) for PDF, sNPF and glycine, and targets of l-LNvs have receptors for PDF, NPF
  and Upd1 (unpaired-1). Each of the neurons would thus receive multiple complementary
  signals. (C) Hypothetically the target neurons of the LNvs could be more diverse
  and express only subsets of the relevant receptors in different combinations. In
  this extreme example each target neuron type expresses only one receptor type and
  the downstream circuits could generate neuropeptide and signal substance-specific
  activity. Here, activity in, e.g., s-LNvs would simultaneously generate a more diverse
  set of actions within and outside the network. These could include some actions
  that are targeted only to neurons outside the bona fide clock network (e.g., the
  Upd1 or sNPF actions in this example). The outputs, RA1 and OA1, could be more diversified.
