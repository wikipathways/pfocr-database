caption: In this network, a node is a gene or a metabolite. Edge between genes means
  that there is a signalling pathway where the genes are connected (transfer signal,
  interacts or a part of the same protein complex). Edge between a gene and a metabolite
  means that the gene product is enzyme known to catalyse the metabolite biotransformations.
