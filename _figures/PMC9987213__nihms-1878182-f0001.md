caption: IL-7/IL-7R is associated with several autoimmune diseases like Rheumatoid
  Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and
  Spondyloarthritis (SpA). Furthermore, it plays a pivotal role in different cell
  types such as monocytes/macrophages (Mϴs), RA fibroblasts (FLS), endothelial cells,
  and T cells. The IL-7/IL-7R pathway is involved in monocyte migration, pro-inflammatory
  Mϴ, osteoclast reprogramming, and the elevation of pro-angiogenic factors, that
  result in arthritis progression. Moreover, IL-7/IL-7R physiologically promotes T
  cell proliferation and prolonged survival as well as pathologically influencing
  Th1/Th17 cell differentiation, potentiated glycolysis, and expansion of osteoclast
  maturation. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors are produced upon IL-7/IL-7R
  signaling. To date, the impact of IL-7/IL-7R pathology is undescribed in RA FLS.
