caption: 'Effects of PPARβ/δ in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This figure depicts the
  effects of PPARβ/δ ligands in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, the liver and pancreatic
  β cells that contribute to the attenuation of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In adipose
  tissue, PPARβ/δ activation switches macrophage polarization towards the anti-inflammatory
  M2 phenotype and prevents IL-6-induced insulin resistance by inhibiting STAT3. In
  skeletal muscle, PPARβ/δ ligands induce FA oxidation, reducing their availability
  for the synthesis of deleterious complex lipids involved in inflammation and prevent
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activating AMPK. PPARβ/δ activation in hepatocytes
  blocks the effects of IL-6 by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway through several mechanisms
  and increasing FGF21 levels. PPARβ/δ activators promote the beneficial effects of
  GLP-1 in the pancreas and enhance GSIS.ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FA, fatty acid;
  GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; IL-6,
