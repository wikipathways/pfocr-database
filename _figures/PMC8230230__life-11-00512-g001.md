caption: NAD+ metabolism in eukaryotic cells. NAD+ anabolism from tryptophan occurs
  by the de novo kynurenine pathway (KP). NAD+ precursors via the salvage pathway
  include nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and
  nicotinic acid riboside (NAR). The enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) converts NAM to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyltransferase (NMNAT1-3) converts NMN to NAD+. NAM can be methylated to N-methyl-nicotinamide
  (MeNAM) by the action of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). NADH represents
  the reduced form of NAD+. NADP+ is the phosphorylated form of NAD+. NADP+ can be
  reduced to NADPH by NAD kinases (NADK1,2). PARPs, Sirtuins, and CD38 NAD+ glycohydrolases
  are known as NAD+ consumers, leading to the generation of NAM. Nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAPRT) converts NA to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN), which is then converted
  to NAD+ by NMNAT1-3. NAR needs to be converted to NAMN to yield NAD+synthesis via
  nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1,2). NRK1,2 also convert NR to NMN. NAR can form
  NA via purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). PNP are also capable of converting
  NR to NAM.
