caption: Combinatorial treatment approach of Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibition
  and immune checkpoint blockade. Co-administration of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitors
  and checkpoint blockade seems to be a promising approach to increase cancer patients’
  response rates. NF-κB inhibition to reduce programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
  on tumor cells in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies could be especially
  effective to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Curcumin and celecoxib can reduce PD-L1
  levels by blocking IκB kinase (IKK) activity and consequently the NF-κB pathway
  [,]. Curcumin can also inhibit the fifth element of the COP9 signalosome (CSN5)-associated
  kinase activity leading to PD-L1 destabilization []. Blocking of oncogenic epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs)
  can attenuate NF-κB activity and reduce PD-L1 expression []. Combinatorial treatment
  of EGFR-TKIs and immune checkpoint blockade might prolong duration of response and
  prevent resistance [,]. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibition can reduce adverse
  events and increase efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade []. Arrows indicate paths
  to NF-κB activation, dotted arrows indicate protein translation and translocation,
  T-bars indicate inhibition.  was created with BioRender.com.
