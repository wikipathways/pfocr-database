caption: Regulation of stomatal development by environmental signaling in Arabidopsis.
  A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, led by the MAPKKK YODA, represses
  stomatal development in Arabidopsis. Upstream of the MAPK cascade is a ligand-receptor
  system consisting of the ERECTA family of receptor-like kinases, along with co-receptors
  SERKs and the receptor-like protein TMM, which bind to the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING
  FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family of secreted peptides, such as EPF2. In early stomatal
  lineage cells, activation of the MAPK cascade leads to the phosphorylation and degradation
  of the bHLH transcription factor SPCH to suppress stomatal lineage initiation and
  proliferation (dashed-line box). SPCH heterodimerizes with ICE1 or SCRM2, two redundant
  bHLH transcription factors, to bind and regulate the expression of downstream targets,
  including SPCH's own expression, via a positive feedback loop. High CO2 levels activate
  the β-carbonic anhydrases CA1 and CA4 to promote the expression of the subtilisin-like
  protease CRSP, which cleaves the EPF2 propeptide into its active form. The mature
  EPF2 peptide binds and activates the ERf receptor complex, suppressing stomatal
  development. STOMAGEN, another EPFL family member, is light-responsive and competes
  with EPF2 for binding to the receptor complex, thereby inhibiting downstream signaling.
  Prolonged high ambient temperatures promote PIF4 gene expression and protein stability,
  and PIF4 directly suppresses SPCH expression. SPCH also directly inhibits PIF4 gene
  expression, resulting in a negative feedback loop. Elevated temperatures also convert
  photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) to its inactive form, relieving its inhibition
  on PIF4. The heat-induced inactivation of phyB may also suppress other branches
  of light signaling pathway that influence stomatal development. Under short-term
  heat shock, heat shock proteins (HSP90s) are activated and interact with YODA, activating
  the MAPK cascade to inhibit stomatal development. In drought conditions, SPCH proteins
  are destabilized to suppress stomatal formation. This may occur due to osmotic stress
  directly activating the MAPK pathway. Osmotic stress also elevates ABA levels and
  activates the SnRK2 protein kinases, which directly phosphorylate and suppress SPCH.
