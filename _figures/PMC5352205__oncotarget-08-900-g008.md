caption: The BRAF V600E/MAP kinase pathway signaling causes hypomethylation of the
  WIPF1 promoter, resulting in over-expression of WIPF1, which in turn promoted thyroid
  cancer cell migration and invasion and tumor growth, leading to the development
  of aggressive thyroid cancer. Upregulation of the tumor-promoting molecule MMP9
  and down-regulation of tumor suppressor molecule E-cadherin by WIPF1 are involved
  in this process. This represented a novel mechanism in the widely known BRAF V600E-associagted
  aggressiveness of thyroid cancer.
