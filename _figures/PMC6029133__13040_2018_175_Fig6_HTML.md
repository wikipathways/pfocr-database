caption: PID pathway-pathway relationships discovered in NMF features constructed
  from the TCGA pan-cancer gene expression dataset. a Pathways in this module are
  responsible for cell cycle progression. b Wnt signaling interactions with nuclear
  Beta-catenin signaling, FGF signaling, and BMP signaling have all been linked to
  cancer progression. c Here, we observe functional links between pathways responsible
  for angiogenesis and those responsible for cell proliferation. d The VEGF-VEGFR
  pathway interacts with the S1P3 pathway through Beta3 integrins. e This module contains
  many relationships related to immune system processes. The interaction cycle formed
  by T-Cell Receptor (TCR) signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells and IL-12/IL-4 mediated
  signaling events, outlined in yellow, is one well-known example. The cycle in blue
  is formed by the ATF2, NFAT, and AP1 pathways; pairwise co-occurrence of these three
  transcription factor networks may suggest that dysregulation of any one of these
  pathways can trigger variable oncogenic processes in the immune system. The list
  of PID pathway-pathway relationships visualized in the network is available as an
  Additional file  for this paper.
