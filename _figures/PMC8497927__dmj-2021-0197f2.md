caption: Role of Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing kinase (ROCK1) in the development
  of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). High-fat feeding increases endocannabinoids
  2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels produced from hepatic stellate cells
  of the liver. Endocannabinoids stimulate ROCK1 activity via cannabinoid receptor
  type 1 (CB1), which inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Suppressed
  AMPK activity then drives the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c)-mediated
  lipogenic program, leading to a rise of lipid accumulation. NAFLD ultimately develops
  with the progression of obesity. On the other hand, it is hypothesized that activated
  ROCK1 binds to liver X receptor (LXRα) and may prompt the lipogenic pathway through
  SREBP1c. As an early event of ROCK1 signaling, CB1-mediated Gα12 (or Gαs) activation
  could be an initial step for ROCK1-dependent de novo lipogenesis. GTP, guanosine
  triphosphate; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1; ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase.
