caption: Depiction of how MEHHs phenolic acids regulate the insulin pathway. The arrow
  (→) indicates enhancement. The insulin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in
  regulating glucose and lipid metabolism within the body. MEHHs’ phenolic acids lower
  blood sugar levels by enhancing pancreatic β-cell secretion and promoting glucose
  uptake, glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and storage. In the liver, muscle,
  and adipose tissue, these phenolic acids facilitate glucose utilization and glycogen
  synthesis through the activation of specific signal transduction pathways, such
  as the PI3K-Akt pathway, while concurrently inhibiting gluconeogenesis
