caption: Regulation of the Golgi via the GOLPH3 pathway. The GOLPH3 pathway links
  the Golgi to the actin cytoskeleton, which applies a tensile force to the Golgi
  that is essential for anterograde trafficking. The GOLPH3 pathway is subject to
  regulation by different mechanisms. Growth factor signaling increases Golgi PtdIns(4)P
  levels through translocation of SAC1 away from the Golgi to the ER (Blagoveshchenskaya
  et al., ). GOLPH3L is a GOLPH3 paralog that acts as a dominant negative inhibitor
  of the GOLPH3 pathway due to its ability to bind to PtdIns(4)P, while being unable
  to bind to MYO18A (Ng et al., ). GOLPH3L acts as a throttle to Golgi-to-plasma membrane
  trafficking in highly secretory cells. Upon DNA damage, DNA-PK activates the pathway
  by phosphorylation of GOLPH3 to enhance its interaction with MYO18A (Farber-Katz
  et al., ).
