caption: GSK3 regulation of STATs, Smads, β-catenin, and NFAT. Among the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors that are critical
  mediators of responses to cytokines and growth factors, GSK3 selectively promotes
  STAT3 and STAT5 activation [,,]. Thus, regulation of transcription factors by GSK3
  modulates both the expression of inflammatory molecules and cellular responses stimulated
  by cytokines. GSK3 also regulates Smad transcription factors that transduce signals
  generated by TGF-β and other stimulants of cell surface receptors to regulate gene
  expression [-]. The transcriptional co-activator β-catenin is phosphorylated by
  GSK3 in the Wnt signaling pathway, which targets β-catenin for proteosomal degradation.
  Inhibitors of GSK3 or activation of Wnt signaling induce stabilization of β-catenin
  that leads to its nuclear transport and accumulation to promote Tcf/LEF-mediated
  transcription. β-catenin also modulates activities of other transcription factors.
  For example, β-catenin negatively regulates bacteria-induced inflammation by inhibiting
  NF-κB [], providing an indirect mechanism for GSK3 to promote NF-κB activity by
  down-regulating β-catenin. Increased β-catenin activity often contributes to the
  proliferation and survival of immune cells. β-catenin levels are low in unstimulated
  B cells, but B cell receptor activation triggers accumulation of β-catenin after
  inducing inhibition of GSK3 []. The T cell receptor (TCR) activates the NFATc (nuclear
  factor of activated T cells) family of transcription factors that promote antigenic
  and tolerogenic genetic programs. TCR signals induce nuclear localization of NFAT
  and GSK3 inactivates NFATc by phosphorylation-dependent stimulation of NFATc nuclear
  export []. Therefore, inhibition of GSK3 keeps NFATc active, mimicking the CD28
  costimulatory signal for T cell proliferation [,,]. Red arrows signify actions regulated
  by GSK3.
