caption: The protein-protein interaction network of the 57 differentially expressed
  proteins related to fatty acid metabolism of breast muscle. Three functional modules
  were apparent in the network, forming tightly connected clusters. (A) The proteins
  related to pathways of fatty acid metabolism. (B) The proteins involved the lipid
  transport. (C) The proteins associated with calcium signaling pathway.
