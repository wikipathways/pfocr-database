caption: Alternative (non-canonical) autophagy. (A) Rab9-dependent mitophagy is not
  dependent on ATG5/ATG7 and LC3, which are required for canonical autophagy, including
  PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Rab9-dependent autophagy is mediated by ULK1, Rab9,
  Rip1, and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in the heart. (B) Endosomal pathway.
  Mitochondria ubiquitinated by Parkin are also eliminated by the endosome pathway.
  A ubiquitinated mitochondrion is captured by ESCRT complexes on the Rab5 positive
  early endosome and, after its maturation, the endosome fuses with the lysosome for
  degradation. (C) Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). Mitochondria labeled by
  the PINK1/Parkin pathway are also subjected to MDVs-dependent elimination.
