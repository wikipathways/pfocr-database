caption: The Simple Wnt/β-catenin pathway involving CEMIP. The Wnt signals will be
  captured by Frizzled receptors, then they are passed to β-catenin after forming
  complex with DSH. Over-expression of CEMIP will emphasize this formation and stimulate
  movement of DSH-Wnt complex towards nucleus. Also, the expression of nucleus-settled
  β-catenin positively induce the expression of CEMIP. Once bond to TCF complex, the
  transcription of small secreted protein would be started. Besides, CEMIP also stimulated
  the ITR3 leading the increase of Ca2+, which was also one of the Wnt signaling factor
  leading to intracellular ions disordered.
