caption: Schematic overview of phosphopeptide enrichment from the eyespot fraction
  of C. reinhardtii for LC-ESI-MS analysis. Details are described in “Materials and
  Methods.” Nano-LC-ESI-MS (MS2 and MS3) analysis was carried out in a mass spectrometer
  with a linear ion trap that permits the acquisition of data-dependent neutral loss
  (Finnigan LTQ; Thermo Electron).
