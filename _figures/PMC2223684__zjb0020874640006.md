caption: Working models for how c-di-GMP influences flagellar function. (A) YhjH/YcgR
  model for E. coli and S. enterica. (Label 1) The PDE YhjH and an unidentified DGC
  set the steady-state levels of c-di-GMP, which (label 2) binds to YcgR. (Label 3)
  This complex interferes with the ability of cells to properly insert the MotAB energy
  transduction complex next to the switching device component FliG in the completed
  basal body, resulting in (label 4) paralyzed flagella. (Label 5) The nucleoid protein
  H-NS antagonizes this effect by stabilizing the FliG-MotA interaction. The net effect
  of YcgR activity is to impair rotation, an activity opposed by YhjH. (B) DgcA/DgrAB
  model for C. crescentus. (Label 1) The DGC DgcA and an unidentified PDE set the
  steady-state levels of c-di-GMP, which (label 2) binds to DgrA and DgrB. (Label
  3) Overexpression of DgrA decreases the steady-state levels of FliL. (Label 4) Since
  fliL mutants assemble paralyzed flagella, FliL may be integral to DgrA-dependent
  inhibition of rotation. (Label 5) Like DgrA, overexpression of DgrB inhibits flagellar
  rotation although it has no effect on FliL. The net effect of DgcA, DgrA, and DgrB
  is to impair rotation. (C) SadC-BifA model for P. aeruginosa. (Label 1) The DGC
  SadC and the PDE BifA set the steady-state levels of c-di-GMP, which (label 2) modulates
  the activity of SadB via a presently unknown mechanism. Also not understood is how
  SadB influences the activity of (label 3) PelA and the rest of the EPS biosynthetic
  pathway or (label 4) the methylation state of the chemoreceptor PilJ or (label 5)
  how PilJ controls the reversal rate, a process that also includes the energy transduction
  complexes MotAB and MotCD. The net result of SadC and SadB activity is to decrease
  the reversals necessary for swarming. l-di-GMP, linear diguanylate.
