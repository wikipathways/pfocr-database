caption: 'Step 1: TOCA1 is represented by the structure of the CIP4 F-BAR domain,
  the TOCA1 HR1 domain and the CIP4 SH3 domain (PDB ID 2CT4, Miyamoto et al. unpublished),
  connected by flexible linkers. Cell signaling through PI(4,5)P2 pushes the equilibrium
  in favor of membrane-localized TOCA1 followed by dimerization via the F-BAR domain.
  Step 2: Cdc42·GTP (Mott and Owen, structure unpublished), activated in response
  to extracellular signals, binds to TOCA1. The model of the Cdc42-HR1 complex is
  shown. The majority of the F-BAR domain is omitted for clarity. Step 3: TOCA1 is
  now poised to activate N-WASP. Autoinhibited N-WASP shows the structure of the GBD
  with the cofilin homology region, with the WH1 (box) and VCA (oval) connected to
  the GBD via flexible linkers. The WH1 domain would be bound to WIP but WIP is omitted
  for clarity. Binding of the TOCA1 SH3 domain to the polyproline region (PP) of N-WASP
  positions N-WASP for Cdc42 and PI(4,5)P2 binding, allowing initial interactions
  of the basic region (blue crosses) and core CRIB (red, unstructured) with Cdc42.
  Step 4: The initial interactions between N-WASP and Cdc42 rapidly push the equilibrium
  in favor of the fully unfolded, high affinity conformation such that the C-terminal
  region of the GBD can now bind, displacing the TOCA1 HR1 domain (step 5). The Cdc42-GBD
  complex is represented by the Cdc42-WASP GBD structure. The VCA domains of the clustered
  N-WASP molecules are now free for robust activation of actin polymerization via
  the Arp2/3 complex.'
