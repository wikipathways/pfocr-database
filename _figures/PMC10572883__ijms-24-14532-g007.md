caption: Illustration diagram of the study. In vitro, nuciferine inhibited the proliferation,
  migration and invasion, and promoted the apoptosis of OSCC cells. In vivo, nuciferine
  significantly inhibited tumor growth in the CDX model. Mechanismly, nuciferine functioned
  the anti-OSCC effects partially through suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway.
