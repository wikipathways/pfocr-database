caption: This is a schematic of the network of intentional and automatic motor behavior.
  The conscious pathway is represented by continuous, bold arrows; the unconscious
  by broken arrows. The posterior cortex is involved in sensory integration and memory.
  The frontal cortex primarily plans, sequences and organizes movement and action.
  The basal ganglia are involved with long-term storage; the cerebellum controls timing.
  PFC = Prefrontal cortex; DLPFC = dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex; FC = frontal cortex;
  SMA = supplementary motor cortex; MC = motor cortex; PMC = premotor cortex; PC =
  parietal cortex; TL = temporal lobe; STG = superior temporal gyrus; H = hippocampus;
  PH = parahippocampal regions; OC = occipital cortex; BG = basal ganglia; CB = cerebellum;
  SC = spinal cord; AHC = anterior horn motor neurons.
