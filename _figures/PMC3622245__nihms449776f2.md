caption: 1. Recognition of viral nucleic acid in apoptotic debris by pDCs induces
  rapid production of large quantities of type I IFN. 2. Type I IFN induces self-amplification
  of the TLR pathway in pDCs and induces an anti-viral state in target cells. 3. Type
  I IFN influences monocyte differentiation and subsequent activation of dendritic
  cells, which, 4. process and present self and viral antigens derived from dying
  cells. 5. Autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells are activated by DCs expressing self
  antigens, and signaling through the type I IFN receptor promotes their survival
  and enhances the cytotoxic activity of CTLs. 6. CTLs kill uninfected host cells,
  which express high levels of autoantigens, via the granzyme B pathway. Debris from
  dying cells is taken up by dendritic cells and presented for recognition by T cells
  in a self-amplifying loop. 7. Type I IFN also induces the differentiation of autoreactive
  B cells into plasma cells and promotes antibody production. 8. Autoantibodies can
  form immune complexes with self molecules in cell debris, which 9. bind Fc receptors
  and TLRs on pDCs, further amplifying IFN production.Abbreviations BCR, B cell receptor;
  CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, interferon-α receptor; MDA5,
  melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cells; Ro52,
