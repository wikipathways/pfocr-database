caption: Schematic diagram showing the potential pathways which were more active in
  non-mucilage BS. The name in red represents upregulated DEPs in both LN and XN compared
  to LM. Red symbols denote significant increases (p < 0.05). LM, BS with rich mucilage
  from Site1; LN, BS without mucilage from Site1; XN, BS without mucilage form Site2
