caption: Epistatic model of lifespan regulation by VHL-1, RHY-1, and EGL-9. RHY-1
  and EGL-9 act in the same pathway to inhibit HIF-1 activity through both VHL-1-dependent
  and VHL-1-independent mechanisms. When HIF-1 is stabilized through loss of VHL-1,
  expression of RHY-1 and EGL-9 is increased, driving reductions in expression of
  longevity reducing target genes including NLP-31, LYS-7, LYS-10, and LIPS-10 through
  a HIF-dependent and VHL-1-independent mechanism. Inhibition of EGL-9 activity causes
  upregulation of genes including NLP-31, LYS-7, LYS-10, and LIPS-10, inhibiting longevity
