caption: 'Normally, cell proliferation is controlled by growth factors binding to
  receptor tyrosine kinase with sequential activation of Ras → Raf-1→ MEK → ERK to
  induce cell proliferation. There is a phenotypic difference between normal kidney
  cells and PKD cells in the cAMP effect on proliferation. (A) In normal human kidney
  (NHK) cells, basal Ca2+ levels, regulated by a variety of Ca2+ entry mechanisms,
  including the PC1/PC2 complex, maintain the activity of PI3 kinase/Akt pathway which
  represses B-Raf. B-Raf kinase activity is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation of an
  inhibitory site. cAMP agonists, i.e. AVP, inhibit Raf-1, ERK and cell proliferation
  through a PKA-dependent mechanism. Thus, in normal renal cells, the balance of positive
  and negative signals control Raf-1 signaling to ERK activation and cell proliferation.
  (B) By contrast, in PKD cells a reduction in intracellular Ca2+ levels due to a
  loss of PC1/PC2 function relieves Akt inhibition of B-Raf, allowing cAMP to signal
  through B-Raf to activate MEK and ERK and to stimulate cell proliferation. [Adapted
