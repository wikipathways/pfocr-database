caption: Similar signaling cascades involved with neuroprotection for insulin-like
  peptides and sex hormones. The insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor
  1 receptor (IGF1R), and insulin-IGF1 hybrid receptor enact their neuroprotection
  through the mitogen-activated protein kinases-extracellular signal-related kinase
  (MAPK-ERK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways signaling cascades.
  Although IGF1R can directly activate the RAS-ERK pathway, both the insulin-like
  peptide receptors and the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) firstly interact with insulin
  receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) scaffolding proteins. ERα and the androgen receptor
  (AR) can also directly modulate PI3K-Akt and MAPK-ERK signaling. Both IRS-1 and
  p85 binding of PI3K are increased with ERα activation, leading to downstream Akt-derived
  inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR). GSK3, specifically, is involved with glycogen synthesis, while both effectors
  are involved in apoptosis. A similar effect may occur with AR’s ability to modulate
  p85 binding to PI3K. AR-induced MAPK-ERK signaling also results in ribosomal S6
  kinase (Rsk) expression that can inhibit the pro-apoptosis bcl-2-associated death
  promoter protein, as well as effects on the ER, GSK3, and the ETS-like transcription
  factor, ELK1. Solid black arrows indicate downstream interaction. Dashed black arrows
  represent the influence of kinases or proteins on the cellular environment. Dashed
  blue arrows represent the binding capabilities of IGF1 and insulin across all three
  receptor types.
