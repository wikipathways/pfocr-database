caption: Adiponectin is highly expressed by mature bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds)
  and by a subset of bone marrow stromal progenitor cells. Adiponectin-expressing
  progenitors overlap with Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and have been more
  recently termed Adipo-CAR cells or MALPs (marrow adipogenic lineage precursors).
  Adipoq+ skeletal progenitors are primed to undergo adipogenesis. Consistent with
  this and likely due also to the high expression and secretion of adiponectin by
  healthy BMAds, classic depots of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) failed to form
  in the AdipoqCre+/DTA+ FF mouse. Instead, we observed age-dependent expansion of
  a BMAd population with reduced expression of adiponectin (Adipoq-/lo) and Cxcl12
  (Cxcl12-/lo) in regions of the skeleton such as the diaphysis that are generally
  devoid of BMAT. FF BMAds were resistant to cold challenge and β3-adrenergic stimulation
  and had decreased expression of β3-adrenergic receptors and monoacylglycerol lipase
  (Mgll), suggesting that these cells have decreased capacity to serve as a local
  fuel source for surrounding hematopoietic and osteogenic cells. We hypothesize that
  these ectopic BMAds originate from progenitors including the peri-arteriolar Osteo-CAR
  population, similar to previous work showing that Adipo-CAR cells are capable of
  undergoing osteogenic differentiation with age and after acute injury. We propose
  that expansion of this BMAd population is a conserved adaptation with age and in
  states of metabolic stress and, furthermore, that this is a unique adaptation of
  the bone marrow that is not present in peripheral adipose depots. Functionally,
  decreases in stromal and BMAd-derived Cxcl12 may contribute to decreased focal support
  of hematopoiesis, helping to explain the well-defined pattern of bone marrow atrophy
  and BMAd expansion that occurs with age and disease.
