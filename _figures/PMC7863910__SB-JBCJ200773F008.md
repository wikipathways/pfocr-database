caption: A model depicting that the CmtR-ESX3-Zn2+signaling pathway triggered by oxidative
  stress contributes to the survival of M. bovis in the host. Upon sensing an oxidative
  stress signal, CmtR expression is induced significantly, and it targets the negative
  regulator Zur to de-repress its inhibition on the expression of esxG and esxH, which
  triggers the accumulation of Zn2+ in the cytoplasm of M. bovis. Zn2+ subsequently
  activates antioxidant enzymes for combating oxidative stress in the host cell. Conversely,
  Zn2+ can de-repress the self-inhibition of cmtR, and further trigger the antioxidant
  regulatory signaling pathway.
