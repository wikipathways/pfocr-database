caption: 'Mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of Raf on DSS-induced colitis.
  (A) Healthy control. (B) DSS-induced colitis model. (C) Raf-pretreated colitis group.
  Raf significantly regulated DSS-induced dysbiosis, restoring it to a normal level.
  Raf downregulated the protein and gene expression of TLR4 and MyD88, thus blocking
  the TLR4–MyD888–NF-κB signaling pathway and thereby reducing the DSS-induced elevated
  levels of colitis-associated inflammatory cytokines. Lamina propria: Upward black

  blue arrows indicate a decrease in content'
