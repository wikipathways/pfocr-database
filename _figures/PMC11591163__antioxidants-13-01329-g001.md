caption: The blood–brain barrier is severely damaged during ischemic stroke. (1) After
  the resupply of blood and oxygen, ferrous ions are transported into the neuron nucleus
  with the assistance of membrane channel proteins such as TFR1, Steap3, and DMT1,
  where they are reduced to ferric ions. Then, the membrane is oxidized by hydroxyl
  radical · OH in the Fenton reaction in the presence of ferric ions. (2) Cerebral
  ischemia/reperfusion inhibits the activity of SLC7A11, reduces the transportation
  of cystine in neurons, and then reduces the synthesis of GSH. GPX4 could not reduce
  a large amount of lipid peroxides without sufficient substrate GSH, causing neuronal
  ferroptosis. (3) MVA pathways can act on GPX4 by regulating the maturation of selenocysteine
  tRNA, causing neuronal ferroptosis. Depletion of SQS competitively blocks neuronal
  ferroptosis
