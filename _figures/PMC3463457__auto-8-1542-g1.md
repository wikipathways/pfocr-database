caption: Figure 1. The induction of autophagy in glioma cells treated with 2OHOA.
  The illustration on the left depicts the membrane structure and the active (black)
  or inactive (red) cell signals in glioma cells. High PE and low SM levels favor
  the activation of the MAPK pathway, which in turn induces the activity of the cyclin-CDK
  and PI3K pathways. The illustration on the right depicts the membrane lipid status
  in 2OHOA-treated cells, with more SM and less PE than untreated glioma cells, which
  causes the uncoupling of RAS and the concomitant inactivation of the MAPK and related
  pathways. Activation of FOXO1, overexpression of CDKN1B, hypophosphorylation of
  RB1 and inactivation of AKT1, contributes to the molecular scenario associated with
  the activation of autophagy in glioma but not normal cells. In this context, the
  membrane lipid structure appears to be the most upstream event that controls cell
  proliferation, differentiation and autophagy in glioma cells, SGMS thereby representing
  a new target for anticancer therapies.
