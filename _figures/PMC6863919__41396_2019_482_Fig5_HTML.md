caption: 'Metabolic reconstruction of “Ca. A. rohweri” illustrating known and uncharacterized
  transporters and known metabolic pathways. “Candidatus A. rohweri” must import many
  host precursors to synthesize compounds such as terpenoids, peptidoglycan, and fatty
  acids. While some transporters and symporters have been characterized, others are
  predicted (gray coloration) based on the inability of the organism to synthesize
  precursors and evidence of uptake by other species of Rickettsiales. DMAPP dimethylallyl
