caption: Schematic representation of the identified components of postconditioning
  signalling in the myocardium. Autacoid factors such as adenosine and opioids along
  with other extracellular factors initiate cytoprotective signalling through their
  sarcolemmal receptors. Three distinct signalling pathways have been reported, including
  RISK, which involves PI3K/Akt and ERK and distal inhibition of GSK-3β. cGMP/PKG
  signalling through natriuretic peptides and soluble GC activation is identified
  as an additional pathway distally targeting mitochondrial potassium channels. SAFE,
  whose major components are TNF-α and JAK/STAT, has also been demonstrated to play
  a role in postconditioning. Although described as distinct pathways, their cytoprotective
  actions are demonstrated to culminate on the mitochondria, specifically inhibition
  of the MPTP. It remains to be fully investigated as to what extent these pathways
  interact and co-localize. NPR, natriuretic peptide receptor; PKG, cGMP-dependent
  PK; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium
  ATPase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.
