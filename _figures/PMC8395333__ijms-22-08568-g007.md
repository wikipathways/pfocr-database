caption: 'The JA signaling pathway in response to biotic stresses in plants. In wheat,
  pathogen and insect damage activate the JA signaling pathway. When bread wheat is
  inoculated with Bgt, JA accumulation results in TaJAZ1 degradation to release TaMYC4,
  inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation and TaPRs expression and thereby
  showing resistance to Bgt. On the other hand, the chewing insect-derived effector
  HARP1, secreted from Helicoverpa armigera, accumulates in leaves and then interacts
  with JAZ to repress the interaction of COI1 and JAZ, thus preventing JAZ degradation
  and inactivating the expression of JA-responsive genes to decrease the plant’s resistance
  to insect damage. In addition, during insect herbivory, the JJW complex is disintegrated
  due to the rapid induction of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of JAV1,
  thereby de-repressing JA biosynthesis genes and causing a rapid burst of JA for
  plant defense. Abbreviations: HARP1, caterpillar-derived effector; ROS, reactive
