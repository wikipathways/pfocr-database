caption: AKT is positively regulated by the PI3K/PDK1 pathway through phosphorylation
  of T308, and negatively regulated by the PI3K/mTORC2 pathway through phosphorylation
  of S473; its subsequent actions include at least partial regulation of GSK3β phosphorylation/inhibition.
  Both AKT downstream effectors, activation of mTORC1 and phosphorylation/inhibition
  of GSK3β, synergistically promote axon regeneration; inhibition of GSK3β alone is
  also sufficient for axon regeneration, at least partially through eIF2Bε. The activation
  of mTORC1 and its substrates 4E-BP and S6K is necessary but not sufficient for potent
  axon regeneration. Feedback inhibition from mTORC1 and S6K1 keeps AKT activation
  after PTEN deletion to a minimum. The question mark represents unknown effectors
  downstream of PTEN that are AKT-independent and sufficient to initiate CNS axon
  regeneration, and which potentially interact with the translational targets of mTORC1
  to promote potent axon regeneration. Green color-coated molecules are pro-axon regeneration
  and black color-coated molecules are anti-axon regeneration.
