caption: A model for the selective interference of UVB radiation with the EGFR-dependent
  signal transduction in keratinocytes. (A) In the absence of UVB, the autocrine stimulation
  of EGFR maintains an active Ras-ERK cascade that is involved in cell proliferation
  (see Discussion). (B) EGFR also generates an antiapoptotic signal that is mediated
  via the PI3K-PKB/Akt1 cascade (reference  and references therein). UVB irradiation
  causes the selective inactivation of the Ras-ERK cascade, whereas the signal transduction
  pathway leading to the activation of PKB/Akt1 remains intact (or is even stimulated
  [Fig. ]).
