caption: A simplified model for canonical HhP. (A) The Hedgehog receptor PTCH1 inhibits
  SMO signaling in the absence of the Hedgehog ligand, which turns off the Hedgehog
  signaling pathway. (B) In the presence of Hedgehog ligand, PTCH1 stops inhibiting
  SMO, resulting in the translocation of SMO to the primary cilium. Once activated
  in the primary cilium, SMO promotes the release of GLI from the SUFU, which allows
  GLI to enter the nucleus to initiate the transcription program related to HhP. Dysregulation
  of the HhP has been associated with carcinogenesis.
