caption: 'Potential effects of CMTM on APS. CKLF1 has a chemotactic effect on many
  cells and can affect the expression of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules

  activation, and the activation of neutrophils through the MAPK pathway. CMTM1 may
  act on Annexin A2 by regulating Ca2+signaling. CMTM2 and CMTM6 are up-regulated
  in the neutrophils of APS patients. CMTM3, CMTM5, CMTM7 influence the activation
  and accumulation of platelets. CMTM3 and CMTM7 are binding partners of BLNK, thereby
  linking BCR and activating BLNK-mediated signal transduction in B cells. CMTM3 and
  CMTM7 can act on DCs and B-1a cell development, respectively. aPL: Antiphospholipid
