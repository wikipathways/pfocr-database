caption: Targeting GlcNAc for metabolic replacement. (A) The structurally conserved
  GlcNAc2Man8 core region of S. cerevisiae N-glycan is shown attached to a hypothetical
  integral membrane protein. N-glycan cores are susceptible to specific cleavage by
  endoH and PNGaseF as indicated. Synthetic GlcNAc analogs bearing bioorthogonal chemical
  groups such as azides and alkynes allow for bioconjugation of diverse probes and
  cargos directly to glycans. (B) A strategy for bypassing de novo UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis
  (black arrows) is shown. An exogenous salvage pathway (blue arrows) allows extracellular
  GlcNAc or analogs to be internalized by the transporter Ngt1 from C. albicans. The
  intracellular GlcNAc (or analog) is phosphorylated at the 6 position via the activity
  of the human GlcNAc kinase, NAGK (). The 6-phosphorylated product is subsequently
  converted into an activated nucleotide-sugar via the mutase and pyrophosphorylase
  activities of Pcm1 and Qri1 respectively.
