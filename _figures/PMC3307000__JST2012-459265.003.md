caption: The JNK signaling pathway regulates axonal transport and autophagy. (a) Model
  of how the JNK signaling pathway controls axonal transport in Drosophila. Axonal
  transport is driven along MT by kinesin-1, which binds to the vesicles that make
  up its cargo through APLIP1 (Drosophila JIP1) and APPL (APP). This process is driven
  by Wnd (DLK), which is activated by unknown upstream signals, and phosphorylates
  Hep (MKK7). Activated Hep then phosphorylates and activates Bsk (JNK), which then
  directly or indirectly modifies the linkage complex and causes APLIP1 and the cargo
  to dissociate from kinesin-1. (This figure is excerpted from [] with some modifications.)
  (b) Model of the regulation of neuronal autophagy in mice. In normal neurons, constitutively
  activated JNKs suppress CDK-induced FoxO1 activation, preventing autophagy. When
  all three of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 are disrupted, CDK-mediated FoxO1 activation increases
  Bnip3 expression. High levels of Bnip inhibit the binding of Beclin1 to Bcl2, and
  this freshly released Beclin1 induces autophagy.
