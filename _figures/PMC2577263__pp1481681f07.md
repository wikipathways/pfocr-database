caption: Model for the acceleration of flowering in response to the removal of PHY
  Pfr during far-red enrichment. Reduction in Pfr levels relieves repression of the
  photoperiod pathway at several stages (light gray lines). Regulation of CO transcription
  might involve modification of the phase of GI expression. Removal of Pfr may also
  release a photoperiod-independent floral promotion pathway (dashed line) under certain
  conditions (e.g. total loss of PHYB Pfr). PFT1 negatively regulates Pfr signaling
  pathways, so loss of PFT1 in the pft1 mutant leads to more effective floral repression
  and later flowering only when there is at least some Pfr present (e.g. in the phyB
  mutant, which still has high PHYD and PHYE Pfr levels). Derepression of the photoperiod
  pathway (black lines) during far-red exposure shifts the balance toward floral promotion
  even in the presence of an active FRI allele and elevated FLC levels; FLC-mediated
  repression of flowering (dark gray lines) buffers the acceleration but is eventually
  bypassed.
