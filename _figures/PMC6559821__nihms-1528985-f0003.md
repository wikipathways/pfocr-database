caption: 'Main signaling involved in non-canonical pathways regulating HIF-1/2. ①-②:
  HIF-1α regulation could be initiated by growth factors stimulation via activation
  of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). This stimulation leads to downstream signaling
  activations via the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway (indicated by the blue arrows) and MAPK/ERK
  pathway (indicated by dark yellow arrows). mTOR and ERK signaling further mediate
  phosphorylation and activation of three downstream effectors, 4E-BP1, p70S6K and
  MNK1/2, followed by the activation of eIF-4E and rpS6. Finally, these phosphorylation
  actions result in enhanced translation of HIF-1α mRNA into protein. In addition,
  Jab1 may promote the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, while PTEN, a negative
  regulator of the PI3K, could downregulate the HIF-1α expression. ③: Mutations of
  VHL, PTEN and p53 result in increased expression of HIF-1α, as well as activations
  of oncogenes, such as MTA1 and V-Src. ④: Hsp90 competes with the RACK1 for binding
  to the HIF-1α PAS domain since RACK1 destabilizes HIF-1α via proteasomal degradation
  pathway. HIF-1α further accumulates in the cytoplasm with the help of Hsp90 which
  assists the protein folding, prevents the degradation of HIF-1α by the proteasome
  and contributes its nuclear translocation. ⑤: HIF-1α is also regulated by HAF by
  inducing the degradation of HIF-1α, while increasing HIF-2α transactivation. Compared
  with Hsp90, Hsp70 could mediate HIF-1α degradation in the prolonged hypoxia but
  not HIF-2α. ⑥: ERK phosphorylates the co-activator CBP/p300 and increases HIF-1α/p300
  complex formation. ⑦: In the nucleus, the HIF complex binds to the HREs motif on
  the DNA of target genes and activates the transcription, causing the upregulation
  of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.
  ⑧: IGF-1 activation could induce the transcription of HIF-2α via PI3K-mTORC2 system.
  ⑨: Stimulations of IGFs, EGFs and FGF-2 on corresponding receptors induce HIF-1α
  expression and protein synthesis through activation of both PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.'
