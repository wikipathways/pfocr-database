caption: The principal cells controlling body iron and copper homeostasis are shown
  with points of interaction between the two metals indicated by a star (★). (A) Duodenal
  enterocytes absorb dietary iron and copper via transporters located at the apical
  membrane. Absorption of oxidized forms of the metals requires the action of a cell-surface
  reductase. In the cytosol, chaperone proteins deliver copper to various proteins
  and organelles; excess copper is sequestered by MT. How cytosolic iron is transported
  is less well characterized, but may also involve chaperone proteins, at least for
  delivery of iron to ferritin. Iron and copper are exported across the basolateral
  membrane by FPN and ATP7A, respectively. Copper deficiency reduces levels of the
  copper-containing ferroxidase, HP (★), required for efficient enterocyte iron efflux
  and loading onto TF (Fe-TF). Iron deficiency markedly increases levels of basolateral
  ATP7A (★), perhaps increasing copper efflux. (B) Hepatocytes control iron metabolism
  by producing the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin (not shown). These cells also
  control copper homeostasis, primarily by regulating the secretion of copper into
  the bile. Hepatocytes can take up Fe-TF via TFR1 or TFR2 cycling through the endocytic
  pathway. In the endosome, iron carried on Fe-TF is reduced and transported into
  the cytosol by mechanisms that are not well understood. During iron overload conditions,
  hepatocytes can also take up NTBI via ZIP14 or perhaps DMT1. Copper taken up via
  hepatocyte CTR1 is delivered to proteins including ATP7B, which pumps copper into
  the TGN for incorporation into GPI-CP and CP. These proteins serve an analogous
  function as HP in the enterocyte. Accordingly, copper deficiency or genetic ablation
  of CP, including GPI-CP (★), causes hepatocyte iron accumulation. High copper levels
  induce the translocation of ATP7B from the TGN to the bile duct, facilitating biliary
  copper excretion, a process that requires interaction between ATP7B and COMMD1.
  Proteasomal degradation of ATP7B is regulated by XIAP. (C) Developing erythroid
  cells, the most avid consumers of iron in the body, acquire iron exclusively through
  the Fe-TF/TFR1 cycle. Endosomal Steap3 probably catalyzes the reduction of iron
  prior to DMT1-mediated transport into the cytosol. Virtually all the iron in these
  cells is directed to the mitochondria, where it is transported into the matrix via
  mitoferrin. The chaperone, FXN, is thought to deliver iron to the sites of Fe-S
  cluster assembly and heme synthesis. Fe-S and heme are incorporated into proteins
  comprising complexes I-IV of the electron transport chain. Most copper taken up
  by erythroid cells is delivered by CCS to SOD1. Copper is also directed to the mitochondrion
  for incorporation into complex IV (CCO) (★), in which two copper atoms work in concert
  with two heme groups to transport electrons. Mitochondrial copper is delivered to
  CCO by the chaperone COX17. Copper deficiency has been shown to decrease the assimilation
  of iron from Fe-TF (★), impair the uptake of iron by mitochondria (★), and reduce
  heme synthesis (★). Molecular details for these iron-copper interactions in erythroid
  cells remain to be elucidated. (D) RE macrophages play a central role in iron metabolism
  by phagocytosing senescent red blood cells and recycling their iron. Red cell hemoglobin
  is degraded within the phagolysosome, releasing heme, which is further catabolized
  to liberate iron. The freed iron is either exported, stored, or utilized by the
  cell. Although RE macrophages can take up copper via CTR1, they also accrue copper
  by phagocytosis of red cells, which contain the metal as part of SOD1. Efficient
  release of iron from RE macrophages, as well as cell-surface expression of FPN,
