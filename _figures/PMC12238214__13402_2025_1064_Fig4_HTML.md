caption: HNF4α regulates various pathways involved in HCC progression. HNF4α modulates
  cell death mechanisms, including ferroptosis, in which it decreases lipid peroxidation,
  and apoptosis via interactions with BAP31 and NF-κB. These pathways contribute to
  enhanced HCC survival and progression. Additionally, HNF4α influences the stemness
  CSC, as indicated by increased expression of CD133, promoting tumor recurrence and
  drug resistance. The combined effects enhance HCC survival, progression, and worsen
  clinical outcomes. Created with BioRender (BioRender.com)
