caption: For a subset of repeat expansion diseases, sense and anti-sense transcripts
  are produced from the the repeat region. In these cases, one transcript may cause
  toxicity through a RNA gain-of-function pathway and the other transcript, which
  is generated in opposite orientation, may yield a toxic poly amino-acid tract containing
  protein. In the example shown here for SCA8, a transcript containing a CUG repeat
  expansion is hypothesized to produce toxicity, and a polyglutamine protein encoded
  from an anti-sense transcript is predicted to simultaneously produce toxicity. Even
  for diseases that do not exhibit bidirectional overlapping transcription, such as
  SCA3, concomitant RNA toxicity from the RNA transcript containing the CAG repeat
  expansion has been proposed. Hence, one must now consider the potential toxic contribution
  of different gene products (RNA and protein) from the sense strand - as well as
  the potential toxic contribution of different gene products from anti-sense overlapping
  transcription.
