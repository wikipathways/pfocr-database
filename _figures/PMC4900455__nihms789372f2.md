caption: Reciprocal antagonism by TLR4 oncogenic and TGF-β tumor suppressor pathways.
  TLR4 is ectopically upregulated in hepatocytes by HCV NS5A and activated by endotoxemia
  caused by alcohol intake or obesity. Activated TLR4 induces the pluripotency factor
  NANOG to generate tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells (TICs) partly via compromised
  TGF-β pathway by IGF2BP3 and YAP1 induced by NANOG. Conversely, defective TGF-β
  pathway upregulates TLR4 and causes liver tumorigenesis.
