caption: Gut-derived LPS is double-edged sword to PDAC, which induced T cell infiltration
  in tumor microenvironment and promoted PD-L1-mediated immune evasion as well. Resultantly,
  LPS had synergistic effect with PD-L1 blockade in PDAC.
papertitle: Gut-derived lipopolysaccharide remodels tumoral microenvironment and synergizes
  with PD-L1 checkpoint blockade via TLR4/MyD88/AKT/NF-ÎºB pathway in pancreatic cancer.
