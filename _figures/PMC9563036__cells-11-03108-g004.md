caption: 'Postulated mechanisms of PC-EVs in neuroprotection and neurogenesis. In
  response to PDGF-BB, PC-EVs release BDNF to recipient neurons. BDNF targets TrkB
  receptors and activates PLCγ, MAPK, and PI3K pathways to promote plasticity, growth,
  and survival. These pathways target CREB transcription factors, enhancing BDNF gene
  expression and promoting survival, differentiation, and neurogenesis. PC-EV release
  of growth factors such as GDNF, PTN, and NGF also protects against neurodegenerative
  pathology. PC-EVs enhance the expression of BcL2 for survival and inhibit both Bax
  apoptosis and the JNK/jun-c cell death pathway, thus promoting neuronal survival.
