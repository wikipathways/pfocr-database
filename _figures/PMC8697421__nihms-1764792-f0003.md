caption: 'Type I IFN responses in influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 infections
  of the lung. Type I IFNs are produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (which do
  not express TLR3) via an IRF7-dependent pathway, and by respiratory epithelial cells
  (which express TLR3) via a TLR3- and IRF7-dependent pathway. Inborn errors of immunity
  affecting these pathways can cause life-threatening pneumonia, including influenza
  pneumonia (IRF9, red), COVID-19 pneumonia (UNC93B1, TRIF, TBK1, IRF3, IFNAR1, and
  IFNAR2, blue), or both (TLR3 and IRF7, red/blue), whereas autoantibodies against
  type I IFN constitute a phenocopy of inborn errors of immunity of type I IFN that
  can cause life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. ISGs: interferon-stimulated genes.'
