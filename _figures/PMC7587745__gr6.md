caption: Schematic diagram showing the similarities and differences of the downstream
  signaling pathways of cTRHR1 and cTRHR3 when activated by thyrotropin-releasing
  hormone (TRH). Both receptors can couple to Gq protein, and their activation stimulates
  intracellular calcium mobilization and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Unlike cTRHR3,
  cTRHR1 can also couple to Gs protein and stimulate adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway.
