caption: DAXX in cell death. Several ways in which apoptosis is induced by DAXX are
  shown. Induction of cell death by interacting with the death domain of Fas and other
  associated proteins, resulting in the activation of ASK1–JNK cell death signaling
  (A and B), and by TGFβ signaling, which mediates non-SMAD pathway activation (C).
  AKT1 blocks a cell death pathway mediated by DAXX through a negative-feedback loop
  (D). During necrosis in retinal ganglion cells, RIPK3 interacts with and phosphorylates
  DAXX (E). In the nucleus, DAXX-mediated cell death appears to be mediated by the
  PML-NBs, presumably by interacting with other proteins within PML-NBs (F). In the
  nucleus, DAXX can repress the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Survivin
  (BBC3) (G). DAXX activates the ASK1–JNK cascade in the nucleus upon UV exposure
  (H). DAXX can activate proapoptotic genes, for example, via p53 activation (I).
  In this case, the localization of DAXX and AXIN in PML-NBs may be important. DAXX
  seems to potentiate UV-induced apoptosis through modulating the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1
  activity (J). In general, cytoplasmic localization of DAXX has been described as
  a proapoptotic event, which can be induced by cellular proteins, viral infection
  and metabolites (e.g., 4-HNE), and blocked by cytoprotective factors (K). DAXX represses
  the expression of several components of autophagy machinery such as ULK1, DAPK1 and
  DAPK3, ultimately suppressing autophagic cell death (L). Cellular stresses such
  as the presence of interferons (IFNs), UV irradiation, and oxidative stress can
  trigger DAXX-mediated cell death events originated from cell surface receptors or
  regulation of gene expression in the nucleus.
