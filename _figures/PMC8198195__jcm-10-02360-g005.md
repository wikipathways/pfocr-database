caption: 'Anaerobic pathways for butyrate synthesis. Major substrates are carbohydrates
  and the amino acids lysine and glutamate. The common pathway: crotonyl-CoA (yellow
  rectangle) is common to all 4 pathways. In most bacteria, crotonyl-CoA is metabolized
  by the terminal genes (red) to butyryl-CoA by butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd) acting
  in reverse, and then to butyrate by butyryl-CoA/acetyl-CoA transferase (But). In
  a few bacteria, butyryl-CoA is first phosphorylated by butyrate phosphate butyryltransferase
  (Ptb) and then dephosphorylated to butyrate with butyrate kinase (Buk). (a) Acetyl-CoA
  (orange arrows): product of carbohydrate metabolism. Acetyl-CoA is converted to
  crotonyl-CoA using three enzymes: thiolase (Thl), hydroxybutyryl-dehydrogenase (Hbd),
  and crotonase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (Cro). (b) Glutarate (blue arrows): product of
  lysine or tryptophan metabolism []. Glutarate is converted to crotonyl-CoA by 2-hydroxyglutaratedehydrogenase
  (L2Hgdh) followed by glutaconate-CoA transferase (Gct), 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (HgCoAd), and glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (Gcd). (c) Lysine (gray arrows): unique
  path; lysine is metabolized to crotonyl-CoA by lysine 2,3-aminomutase (KamA), lysine
  5,6-aminomutase (KamD), 3,5-diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase (Kdd), 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate
  cleavage enzymes (Kce), and 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase (Kal). In a few bacteria,
  acetoacetate may also be converted to butyrate using the enzyme butyryl-CoA acetoacetate-CoA
  transferase (Ato). (d) 4-Aminobutyrate/succinate (purple arrows from the bottom
  of the figure): 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) is a product of glutamine [], obtained by
  glutaminase removing the glutamine amide group to form glutamate. The glutamate
  amino group is removed by glutamate dehydrogenase to form succinate-semialdehyde
  and converted to crotonyl-CoA by 4-hydroxybutyrate-dehydrogenase (AbfH), butyryl-CoA-4-hydroxybutyrate-CoA
  transferase (4Hbt), and 4-hydroxybutyryl-dehydratase (AbfD). AbfD also possesses
  vinyl-acetyl-CoA isomerase activity (Isom). Not shown are how aspartate, arginine,
  and putrescine are converted to butyrate by the 4-aminobutyrate/succinate path.
  Aspartate is converted to succinate semi-aldehyde by three enzymes, namely, aspartate
  aminotransferase, fumarate transferase, and acyl-CoA transferase. Arginine is decarboxylated
  to agmatine, which is hydrolyzed to urea and putrescine. The putrescine reacts with
  ketoglutarate to produce 4-aminobutyraldehyde, which is oxidized to 4-aminobutyrate
  and metabolized like glutamine []. The common step of all four pathways is the synthesis
  of crotonyl-CoA, which precedes butyryl-CoA and butyrate. Adapted from [].'
