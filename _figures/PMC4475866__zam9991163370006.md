caption: Global functional metabolic network consisting of two major peripheral pathways,
  the n-alkane pathway via β-oxidation and the PAH-MN, and the TCA cycle for central
  carbon metabolism. The functional map was reconstructed by integrating the proteomic
  data with the framework of metabolic pathways (from the KEGG database), in which
  protein abundance was used as a proxy for enzyme activity. The red arrows represent
  steps activated in the pathways.

  description: Global functional metabolic network consisting of two major peripheral
    pathways, the n-alkane pathway via β-oxidation and the PAH-MN, and the TCA cycle
    for central carbon metabolism. The functional map was reconstructed by integrating
    the proteomic data with the framework of metabolic pathways (from the KEGG database),
    in which protein abundance was used as a proxy for enzyme activity. The red arrows
    represent steps activated in the pathways.
