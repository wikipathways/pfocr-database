caption: Potential mechanisms governing TGF-β1–induced HASM contraction. Agonist binding
  to a GPCR in airway smooth muscle induces both a Ca2+-dependent pathway through
  Gq/11 activation and a RhoA/ROCK-mediated Ca2+-sensitization pathway through G12/13
  activation. In the Ca2+-dependent pathway, IP3 induces Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum stores. Increased [Ca2+]i activates Ca2+/CaMKII, which activates MLCK.
  MLCK phosphorylates MLC20, leading to actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling and contraction.
  In addition, RhoA/ROCK activation can suppress MLCP in the Ca2+-sensitization pathway,
  resulting in increased contractility. After TGF-β1 binding to TβR-I/II, TGF-β1 can
  signal through Smad-dependent or Smad-independent signaling pathways that may affect
  airway smooth muscle contractile function. α-SMA, α smooth muscle actin; [Ca2+]i,
