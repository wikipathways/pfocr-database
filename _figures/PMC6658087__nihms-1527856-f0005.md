caption: (A) Pathway analysis for hyperoxia-responsive genes in PBS-received Nrf2+/+
  mice (n= 7162 genes, P < 0.01, Moderated t-test) demonstrated p53 as a key upstream
  regulator for the hyperoxia-altered lung genes, which may sequentially modulate
  other signal transducers. (B) In Nrf2−/− mice that received PBS, O2 altered genes
  (n = 4,799, P < 0.01) involved predominantly in IL-17A signaling pathway, which
  may lead to severe neutrophil infiltration. (C) Nrf2-dependently modulated genes
  during hyperoxia (n = 816, P < 0.01) such as Selp and Fcgr2b may contribute to the
  differential lung edema between Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice given PBS.
