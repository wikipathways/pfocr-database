caption: Oxidative stress network in BM microenvironment. In BM, the sources of ROS
  are principally represented by the mitochondria and NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit
  NOX. Superoxide produced is then converted by superoxide dismutase into hydrogen
  peroxide and scavenged by catalase or glutathione peroxidase. ROS can enhance or
  decrease stem cell functions by activating or inhibiting different signaling pathways.
  For example, ROS induce differentiation and migration through the PTEN/PI3K/Akt
  pathway, sustain quiescence via FOXOs and ATM, and induce senescence through p38
  MAPK pathway. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein; FOXOs, forkhead box transcription
  factors; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; ROS, reactive oxygen species. To see this
