caption: A model for the common and distinct activities of TGF-β and BMP in C2C12
  cells. Runx2 is an indirect target of the Smad signaling pathway. Induction of Runx2
  is essential for the common activities of TGF-β and BMP. Ligand-specific gene expression,
  however, requires cooperation between Runx2 and receptor-activated Smads (R-Smad).
