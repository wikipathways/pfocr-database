caption: The proposed mechanism of caloric restriction (CR) impacts frailty. CR may
  reduce the risk of frailty and associated adverse outcomes by activating the AMPK
  and SIRT1 pathways, inhibiting the IGF-1 and mTOR signaling and ferroptosis, and
  reducing the inflammation mediated by NF-KB pathways. CR-induced SIRT1 activation
  may upregulate AMPK and suppress NF-κB and mTOR activity. CR and metformin may attenuate
  ferroptosis by activating the AMPK pathway and improving frailty. AMPK, adenosine
