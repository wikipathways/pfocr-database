caption: 'Activating insulin growth factors and energy deprivation triggers the HIF
  signaling pathway. It is divided into three steps: (A) When insulin binds with the
  epidermal growth factor, it starts signal transduction through auto-phosphorylation.
  It phosphorylates the ongoing genes RKT, GRB2, IRS1 and PI3k, which converts PIP2
  to PIP3, then phosphorylation of PDK1. Additionally, PDK1 phosphorylates mTORC2,
  which is involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, GRB2 phosphorylates
  RAS and activates the MAPK signaling pathway, which starts the phosphorylation of
  AKT and ERK, directly involved in Angiogenesis through VEGF and HIF-1. Furthermore,
  AKT is a central pathway regulator that inhibits β-catenin, p53 and TSC1/2, which
  dephosphorylate RHEB and, through GTPase, activate mTORC1. (B) During the energy
  deficit condition, the AMP/ATP ratio is maintained through AMPK, which dephosphorylates
  the mTORC1 and is involved in the process of autophagy and activates HIFs. (C) In
  the nucleus, HIF-1 stabilizes, binds VHL/PHD HIF1-α and reaches the target gene
  with the help of P300, which acts as a coactivator. The HIF-1α/HIF-1β complex binds
  to the HRE region of the target gene, triggering the hypoxia response and activating
  various up-signaling genes, including VEGF and GLUT-1, and they activate associated
  genes'
