caption: A model for the regulation of MEF2 activity by CaMK signaling. Hypertrophic
  signals that activate CaMK and MAPK lead to MEF2 activation by different mechanisms.
  Some stimuli, such as PE, may activate both pathways, whereas other stimuli may
  preferentially activate one pathway or the other. Association of HDACs 4/5 with
  the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of MEF2 represses MEF2 transcriptional activity. CaMK
  activates MEF2 by preventing association of HDACs 4/5 with MEF2. MAPK stimulates
  MEF2 activity by direct phosphorylation of the TAD. Together, the CaMK and MAPK
  pathways synergize to activate MEF2.
