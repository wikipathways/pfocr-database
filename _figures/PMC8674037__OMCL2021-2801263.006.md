caption: The schematic diagram of signal pathway was displayed. rCTRP9 binding to
  the COOH terminal of AdipoR1 and the intracellular NH2 terminal of AdipoR1 will
  bind to PTB domain of APPL1, activated APPL1 can activate AMPK phosphorylation,
  p-AMPK make Nrf2 release from the complex and accumulate in the cytoplasm, and then
  activated Nrf2 translocate into the nucleus and bind to ARE in a battery of antioxidative
  genes against oxidative stress.
