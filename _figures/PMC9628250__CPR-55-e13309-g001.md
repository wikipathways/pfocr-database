caption: The genes of Wnt signalling pathway in bone remodelling. MSC can differentiate
  into adipocytes and osteoblasts, which can further differentiate into mature osteocytes.
  The balance between Wnt10b‐mediated osteogenesis and PPARγ‐mediated adipogenesis
  of MSC is disrupted when key enzymes of glutamine metabolism are impaired or mitochondrial
  metabolism is abnormal. Wnt7b disrupts the formation and activity of osteoclasts
  derived from HSC, leading to an increase in bone mass. HSC, haematopoietic stem
  cells; MSC, mesenchymal stem cells
