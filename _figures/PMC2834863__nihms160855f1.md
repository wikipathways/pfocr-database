caption: TGF-β can be liberated from latent complexes by αvβ6 integrin, calpain, cathepsin
  D, chymase, elastase, endoglycosidase F, kallikrein, matrix metalloproteinase 9
  (MMP-9), neuraminidase, plasmin or thrombospondin 1. Once activated TGF-β is able
  to bind type II TGF-β receptor homo-dimers (TβRII) thereby permitting the efficient
  transactivation of type I TGF-β receptor homo-dimers (TβRI). As a result of receptor
  activation by TGF-β, downstream SMAD dependent and SMAD independent signaling is
  initiated. However, the level of downstream pathway activation is dependent the
  abundance of receptor associated TGF-β signaling repressors such as SMAD7, STRAP,
  YAP65, SMURF1, SMURF2, GADD34 and PP1. SMAD dependent signaling has been primarily
  associated with activation of SMAD2 or SMAD3, however it has now been shown that
  SMAD1 and SMAD5 can be activated by TGF-β. Once SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD5 are
  activated they are able to associate with SMAD4 to co-activate or co-repress transcription.
  Importantly, SMAD dependent signaling can also be repressed by complex association
  with other transcription factors, co-activators or co-repressors such the c-Ski
  or SnoN proto-oncogenes. The SMAD independent pathways are known to include ShcA,
  RHO, RAC/CDC42, RAS, TRAF6, TAK1, PI3K, PAR6, MAP3K1, DAXX and PP2A. Together, the
  balance of SMAD dependent signaling, SMAD independent signaling and the presence
  or absence of signaling repressors ultimately determines the response to TGF-β in
  vitro or in vivo.
