caption: The key intermediate, (+)-vellosimine (13) was prepared from the common intermediate,
  E-ethylidene ketone 10, which was synthesized via the asymmetric Pictect-Spengler
  reaction, Dieckmann cyclization, and palladium mediated cross coupling in high overall
  yield.– As illustrated in , the route began with the readily available (−)-Na-H
  tetracyclic ketone 19, which was subjected to the conditions of catalytic hydrogenolysis
  to remove the benzyl function in 92% yield. This base 20 was reacted with the (Z)-1-bromo-2-iodo-2-butene
  21 in the presence of K2CO3 in THF at reflux to provide the Nb-alkylated ketone
  22 in 90% yield. The ketone 22 was initially converted into the desired ketone 10
  in 80% yield via an intramolecular palladium (enolate mediated) cross-coupling reaction
  (See  for experimental details), analogous to the process developed by Wang et al.,,
  Further development of this palladium-mediated cross coupling reaction has been
  achieved when ketone 22 was stirred in combination with 5.0 mol% Pd2(dba)3, 7.0
  mol% DPEphos and 1.5 equivalents of NaOtBu in THF at 80 °C for 8 hours. The desired
  ketone 10 was obtained in 83% yield which was superior to the previously reported
  results (). In addition, another process was also carried out with ketone 22 in
  combination with 6.0 mol% Pd(PPh3)4 and a base PhOK (which was generated previously
  in the reaction vessel from 2.0 equivalent of PhOH and 1.5 equivalent of KOtBu).
  The desired ketone 10 was obtained in 80% yield which was the same as reported in
  previous processes [Improvements and previous results are summarized in ], but less
  of the vinyl acetylene byproduct was observed. Ketone 10 was then subjected to the
  Wittig reaction with methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium chloride and anhydrous potassium
  tert-butoxide to provide a mixture of two stereoisomeric enol ethers represented
  by olefin 23. After a short wash column, the mixture of enol ethers 23 was hydrolyzed
  under acidic conditions to provide vellosimine 13 in 90% yield (overall yield for
  two steps). Since the aldehyde at C(16) obtained from 23 preferred the more stable
  α configuration because of a syn pentane interaction with the indole methylene bridge,
  the mixture was simply stirred until all of the β-epimer was converted into the
  more stable, natural α epimer present in (+)-vellosimine 13. Because of the cost
  of palladium an alternative, viable and cheaper route was investigated in regard
  to the cross-coupling to provide ketone 10. The recent report on the copper-mediated
  preparation of vinyl sulfides encouraged use of the same catalytic system (CuI in
  combination with 1,2-cis-cyclohexanediol) for this cross-coupling reaction to obtain
  ketone 10 from vinyl iodide 22. The treatment of 24 in combination with 50 mol%
  of CuI and 50 mol% of 1,2-cis-cyclohexanediol as a ligand and 2.0 equivalents of
  Cs2CO3 as a base in DMF at 140 °C for 15 hours provided pentacyclic ketone 25 in
  75% yield (). This was the best yield in this copper-mediated strategy obtained
  to date and it was much easier to work-up this reaction than the corresponding palladium
  mediated process (). A series of ligands in combination with CuI were screened and
  optimized (See ); however, this process has not worked as well in the Na-H series
  of interest here (See  for details). Further work is underway to maximize the yields
  in both the Na-methyl case 25 and the Na-H case 10.
