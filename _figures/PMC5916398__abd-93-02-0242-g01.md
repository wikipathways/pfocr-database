caption: Initial stages of the sensitization in contact dermatites. 1) The nickel
  (Ni2+), cobalt (Co2+) and palladium (Pd) ions, or fragments of hyaluronic acid (HA)
  generated by some contact allergens, can directly trigger TLR4 and the NFκB pathway,
  culminating in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 2) The
  extracellular ATP acts as a danger signal (DAMP); upon binding with the P2X7 perigenetic
  receptor, it triggers the inflammasome through NLR3 and caspase-1, promoting the
  maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. 3) The production of cytokines and chemokines, by
  the keratinocytes, and the activation through TLR4 in DCs favors their maturation
  and migration, which is optimized with the presence of neutrophils and mast cells.
  4) In dLNs, the DCs present the antigen for the induction of antigen-specific T
  effector cells, which can generate Th or T CD8+ cells which secrete IFN-γ (Tc1).
  5) The regulation of Tregs in the sensitization stage, acting in the antigenic presentation
  and/or in the generation of effector T cells
