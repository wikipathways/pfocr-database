caption: Alterations in the insulin receptor pathway, resulting from the activity
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and androgens. Tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) affects
  insulin signaling by phosphorylation of serine in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
  through activation of several serine kinases, including c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). It inhibits insulin-induced
  tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and downregulates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  activity. Decreased adiponectin concentration results in increased membrane sn-1,2-diacylglycerols
  (sn-1,2-DAGs) activity. It leads to impaired kinases activity and decreased insulin
  signaling. Testosterone induces insulin resistance in cells by affecting insulin-stimulated
  phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC). All these mechanisms contribute to decreased
  glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) expression and decreased glucose transport into
  cells.
