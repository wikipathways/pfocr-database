caption: NFκB pathway activation via death receptor signaling. TRAIL has been reported
  to induce the canonical NFκB signaling pathway, which involves the inactivation
  of IκB subunits by the IKK complex to release active NFκB homodimers or heterodimers.
  Generally, these active NFκB dimers translocate to the nucleus and induce gene transcription.
  NFκB may have different functions depending on the NFκB subunits present and their
  binding partners. Chen et al. reported the p65 subunit to be anti-apoptotic and
  cRel to be pro-apoptotic.
