caption: Using the influenza A virus lifecycle as a guide (), the candidate proteins
  from the human and fly screens were placed at the position most likely to be relevant
  to the virus using a database of annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, Reactome
  and OMIM (see methods). Computational mapping and supporting evidences were reviewed
  and refined manually (). The known molecular functions of the host factors were
  determined with the use of bioinformatics and multiple data sets (gray ovals). Host
  factors identified in the human siRNA screen (blue); the human orthologues of proteins
  identified in the fly-based screen (pink), factors which were found in both human
  and fly screens (green), and bridging proteins that were not detected, but none-the-less
  generate potentially insightful interactions (gray). Double borders signify the
  candidate is present in the Reactome influenza A virus infection pathway (). Solid
  lines between genes indicate a protein interaction in human or other speicies. Dotted
  lines indicate inferred interaction from literature or annotation. Viral RNA (vRNA),
  viral complementary RNA (cRNA).
