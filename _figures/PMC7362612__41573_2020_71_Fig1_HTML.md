caption: 'Complex I: stimulation of TNFR1 by TNF promotes the formation of an intracellular
  signalling complex associated with the death domain of trimerized TNFR1 that recruits
  two death domain-containing proteins: adaptor protein TRADD and receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). TRADD recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1/2
  and XIAP to perform K63 ubiquitylation of complex I, including RIPK1 K377, which
  in turn recruits the LUBAC complex, comprised of HOIP, HOIL1 and SHARPIN. LUBAC
  mediates linear (M1) ubiquitylation of RIPK1. Deubiquitinase CYLD and its adaptor
  protein SPATA2 modulate M1/K63 ubiquitylation of RIPK1. M1 deubiquitinase OTULIN
  activates LUBAC. K63 ubiquitin chains on RIPK1 recruit TAB2/3 and TAK1. M1 ubiquitin
  chains on RIPK1 recruit the NEMO–IκB kinase (IKK) complex, TBK1, A20, ABIN1 (A20
  binding inhibitor of NF-κB-1) and OPTN. A20 in complex I suppresses the activation
  of RIPK1 kinase. NF-κB activation: activation of TAK1 and the IKKs promote NF-κB
  pathway activation to mediate transcription of both pro-inflammatory and pro-survival
  genes, including A20, which modulates the ubiquitylation of RIPK1 to control its
  activation, and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), which modulates
  activation of caspase 8 (Casp8). RIPK1-dependent apoptosis (RDA): activation of
  TNFR1 under A20, ABIN1, cIAP1/2, NEMO, TBK1, IKK or TAK1-deficient conditions leads
  to RIPK1 kinase activation. Activated RIPK1 binds to FADD and Casp8 to form complex
  IIa and promote activation of caspases and apoptosis. Increased levels of A20 promote
  the activation of RIPK1 in complex IIa. Necroptosis: inhibition of Casp8-mediated
  cleavage of RIPK1 promotes RIPK1 dimerization via the C-terminal death domain, which
  leads to its activation and the subsequent formation of the necrosome (complex IIb)
  comprised of RIPK1, FADD, Casp8, RIPK3 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase
  (MLKL), which in turn executes necroptosis. : when the NF-κB pathway is inhibited,
  TNF stimulation can promote the formation of a cytosolic complex with FADD and Casp8
  to mediate apoptosis independent of RIPK1. P, phosphate; RIPK1i, RIPK1 inhibitor;
  Ub, ubiquitin. Adapted from ref., Springer Nature Limited.'
