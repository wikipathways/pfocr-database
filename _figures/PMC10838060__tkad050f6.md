caption: cGAS-STING and pyroptosis. Oxidative stress leads to the production of mPTP
  and increases membrane permeability, resulting in the generation of mtDNA. Additionally,
  bacteria ingested by macrophages can undergo cleavage by guanylate binding proteins,
  leading to the production of cDNA. These events activate the cGAS-STING pathway,
  triggering the production of IFN. Abnormal cDNA and IFN are detected in AIM2 inflammasomes,
  which activate caspase-1 cleavage and AIM2 activation, resulting in the production
  of GSDMD perforation protein and the subsequent release of potassium ions (K+),
  ultimately inducing pyroptosis. The released K+ can further activate NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  Notably, K+ can also inhibit the activity of cGAS-STING during focal cell death
  by promoting the binding of cGAS to DNA. cGAMP 2′3′Cyclic GMP–AMP, STING stimulator
