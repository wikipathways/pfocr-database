caption: Base excision repair. In short patch nuclear BER (SP-nBER), DNA glycosylase
  can cut the chemical bond between nucleotide bases and ribose to release a complete
  DNA phosphoribose chain. This process will form an purine or pyrimidine (AP) site.
  APE1 cleaves the 5'position of the phosphodiester chain at the AP site. In this
  way, a 3'-hydroxyl group and a 5'-basic deoxyribose phosphate group appear on the
  DNA strand. When 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) are present, the
  SP-BER pathway continues, where DNA polymerase β (Polβ) removes 5'-dRP and inserts
  a new nucleotide to fill the gap, and then X-ray repairs the complex of cross-complementary
  protein 1 (XRCC1) and DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) to close the cut. In long patch nuclear
  BER (LP-nBER), the 5' end is not a Pol β substrate. In this pathway, 2–10 nucleotides
  at the 3'-end are replaced and removed from the DNA backbone, and the new nucleotide
  chain and petals shape endonuclease 1 (FEN1) complexes, and base complementary pairing
  is performed under the action of POL (δ or ε). The final ligation step is performed
  by LIG1. Mitochondrial BER (mtBER) includes short patch BER (SP-mBER) and long patch
  BER (LP-mBER). SP-mBER is initiated by a specific DNA glycosylase, which recognizes
  modified or inappropriate bases and cleaves N-glycosidic bonds to produce abasic
  site. The resulting AP site is processed by AP endonuclease, resulting in a strand
  break with a 3'-hydroxyl end and a 5'-(dRP) residue. Then, the mitochondrial DNA
  polymerase pol γ fills in the single-nucleotide gap for repair. In addition to polymerase
  activity, pol γ has 3'−5' exonuclease and 5'dRP lyase activities. Therefore, when
  mtBER is initiated by a monofunctional DNA glycosylase, the 5'-dRP part produced
  when the AP endonuclease cleaves the strand can be removed by the 5'-dRP lyase function
  of pol γ. Finally, the resulting nick is sealed by DNA ligase. mtBER can also be
  performed LP-mBER, which involves the incorporation of 2–12 nucleotides during the
  repair synthesis process. The LP-mBER treatment of DNA damage causes the DNA strands
  to be exposed as a part of a single-stranded overhang or flap structure. These flap
  structures are recognized and cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), which is an
  essential enzyme for nuclear LP-mBER, and then ligated by DNA ligase.
