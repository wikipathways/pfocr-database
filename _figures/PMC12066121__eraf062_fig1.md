caption: Ethylene pathway and its contribution to maize growth and development. (A)
  Schematic representation of known key proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis,
  signaling, and response. Ethylene production is mediated by three consecutive enzymes
  (in purple). Ethylene receptors (in magenta) perceive the hormone at the ER and
  are functional as dimers. Also, monovalent copper and its transporter RAN1 (in gray)
  are essential for proper signal perception and three-dimensional conformation of
  receptors. Ethylene receptors are active in the absence of the hormone and negatively
  regulate the response by directly interacting with CTR1 (in pink), a Raf-like kinase.
  CTR1 is a mobile protein that moves in the cytosol to deactivate the signaling pathway
  by inhibiting EIN2 (in pink), a transmembrane protein also in the ER; by these means,
  the receptors and CTR1 repress ethylene response. Ethylene binding to the receptors
  deactivates them, leading to the inactivation of CTR1. This releases the CTR1-mediated
  inhibition of EIN2 and activates it. When EIN2 is in its active state, the C-terminal
  part of the protein is autocleaved and released. The EIN2 C-terminal part moves
  to the nucleus to indirectly stabilize EIN3/EIL1 (in pink). In their active state,
  the transcription factors EIN3/EIL1 regulate myriad genes, including ERF encoding
  transcription factor genes and other downstream targets (in orange). Negative regulators
  of ethylene response are also activated by EIN3/EIL1, such as EBF, ARGOS, and RTE
  genes (in yellow). Those proteins not shown in bold are deactivated in the presence
  of ethylene. (B) Genetic basis of ethylene in maize development and growth (see
  text for details). Ethylene biosynthesis genes ZmACS2/3/6/7 and ZmACO2 control ethylene
  levels and play significant roles in vegetative and inflorescence development, yield,
  heterosis, and root architecture. Negative regulators of ethylene signaling ZAR1,
  ARGOS8, and RTL2/4 function in overall biomass, and seedling and adult root architecture.
  EIN2, a positive regulator of ethylene signaling, regulates root angle in maize
  seedlings. KO, knockout; OE, overexpression; DTA, days to anthesis; DTS, days to
