  (IC50) values of each tested fatty acid against the urate transport mediated by
  URAT1. The IC50 values are from ,  and . Three polyunsaturated fatty acids with
  substantial URAT1-inhibitory activities are indicated in red. N.D., not determined
  in this study; FAs, fatty acids; des, desaturase; elo, elongase. The metabolic pathway
  is adapted from a previous report [], with some modifications.
