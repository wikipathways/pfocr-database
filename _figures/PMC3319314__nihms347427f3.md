caption: APE1 role in DNA base excision repair (BER). This figure gives a very general
  overview of the BER pathway and is discussed in more detail in other chapters in
  this review issue. A) Repair is initiated by a damage specific DNA glycosylase,
  which removes the damaged base to generate an AP site. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases
  remove the damaged base to generate an AP site (shown) whereas bifunctional glycosylases
  in addition to excising the damaged base also nick the phosphodiester backbone,
  3′ to the AP site (not shown). APE1 processes the AP sites by hydrolyzing the backbone
  5′ to the AP site to generate 3′OH and 5′ dRP groups. The 5′ dRP group is removed
  by the dRPase function of DNA Polymerase β and it also fills in the correct base.
  Repair is completed by DNA Ligase III/XRCC1 by sealing the nick. Failure to repair
  such accumulated AP sites leads to cytotoxicity, increased apoptosis. Elevated levels
  of APE1 in cancer cells have been linked to resistance to chemotherapy, poor prognosis
  and survival. Thus inhibiting APE1 leads to sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
  agents [].B) In the major short-patch (SP) BER pathway regular AP sites are repaired
  by the removal of the single damaged base. Modified or oxidized AP sites are repaired
  by the long-patch (LP) BER pathway where a flap of 3–8 nucleotides is displaced
  and excised by Fen1. DNA polymerase β, δ or ε then inserts the correct nucleotides
  and repair is completed by sealing of the nick by DNA ligase I. APE1 also interacts
  with PCNA in the LP BER pathway [].
