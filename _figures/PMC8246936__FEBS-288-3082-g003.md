caption: The lysosome functions as a degradative organelle and a signaling hub. (A)
  Lysosomes digest cargo from endosomes and autophagosomes in the acidic lumen. The
  endolysosomal pathway degrades biomolecules, including membrane receptors, in lysosomes
  following their internalization by endocytosis. Autophagy encloses cytoplasmic materials,
  including organelles, into autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes where their
  contents are digested. Lysosomes secrete their contents via lysosomal exocytosis.
  Lysosomes function as a signaling hub for nutrient sensing. The gray square is enlarged
  in panel B. (B) The lysosome is a hub where signaling molecules localize and transduce
  their signals. v‐ATPase maintains a low pH by pumping protons. Nutrient‐rich conditions
  activate Ragulator‐RAG, which recruits and activates mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1) to lysosomes. Activated mTORC1 (pink) inhibits lysosomal biogenesis
  through inhibitory phosphorylation of TFEB. Low nutrient concentration results in
  inactivation of mTORC1 and activation of TFEB, thereby inducing expression of lysosomal
  genes.
