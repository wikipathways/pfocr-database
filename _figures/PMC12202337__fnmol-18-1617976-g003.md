caption: Roles of the ERK signaling pathway in regulating remyelination. After nerve
  crush injury or axotomy, the distal stump of the peripheral nerve undergoes Wallerian
  degeneration, which includes early degenerative axonal changes, immune cell recruitment,
  Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation, and axon regeneration and remyelination.
  Nerve injury results in a rapid activation of ERK signaling in Schwann cells. A
  number of cytokines are upregulated, and a variety of immune cells are recruited
  following the activation of the ERK signaling pathway. ERK activation results in
  Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation. The ERK signaling pathway also
  participates in regulating neurotrophic factor expressions and axonal outgrowth.
  After phosphorylated ERK levels return to basal levels, dedifferentiated Schwann
  cells redifferentiate and remyelinate
