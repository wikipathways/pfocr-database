caption: Figure 2. Schematic representation cellular APOE uptake pathways. (A) LDLR
  and LRP1 are classical endocytic receptors. Aβ/APOE complexes associate either with
  LDLR or LRP1 at the plasma membrane (step 1). Note that Aβ can directly bind to
  LRP1 while binding to the LDLR is mediated through association of Aβ with APOE.
  After endocytosis, Aβ and APOE reach the endosomal compartment (step 2) and finally
  the lysosomes for degradation (step 4) while the receptors are recycled to the cell
  surface (step 3). (B) Sortilin shows a cellular trafficking pathway that is distinct
  from that of LRPs. Following internalization from the cell surface (step 1) sortilin
  moves from the endosomal compartment to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), to continue
  intracellular shuttling between endocytic and secretory organelles (step 2). (C)
  Hypothetical model how sortilin might influence APOE3 and APOE4 trafficking in neurons.
  After dissociation of the Aβ/APOE complexes in the endosomes (step 2), Aβ and APOE
  isoforms follow different intracellular routes. Aβ is degraded in the lysosomes
  (step 3). APOE3 recycles back to cell surface (step 4) but APOE4 is trapped within
  intracellular compartments, possibly in the endosomes (step 2). Sortilin is a trafficking
  receptor that has a higher affinity for APOE3 compared with APOE4. Sortilin might
  thereby release APOE4 already in the endosomal compartment whereas it could traffic
  APOE3 back to the secretory pathway (step 4).
