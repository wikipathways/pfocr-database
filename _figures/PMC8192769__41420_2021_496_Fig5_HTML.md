caption: A Fadraciclib downregulates E2F1, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.
  Downregulation of RNAPII is the most plausible explanation for the global gene suppression
  observed. A rapid decrease in short half-life MCL-1 level perturbs a balance in
  the BCL-2 family. A decrease in the Erk1/2 activity observed in all cell lines tested
  potentially promotes a reduction in MCL-1 stability and half-life. p38 MAPK is markedly
  increased in MOLM-13 cell line only, implying that the stress response and apoptosis
  are highly induced. B Fadraciclib downregulates MCL-1, which activates the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, followed by cell death. Indeed, a rapid decrease in MCL-1 level
  perturbs a balance in the BCL-2 family, which leads directly to activator BH3-only
  proteins-binding BAK and BAX, resulting in their homo-oligomerisation and MOMP.
  Following this, pro-apoptotic proteins within the mitochondrial intermembrane space,
  for example, Cyt c, DIABLO and HTRA2 are released. Cyt c binds to APAF-1 to form
  the apoptosome. Once formed, the apoptosome can then recruit and activate the inactive
  pro-caspase-9. Following this, caspases-3, 6, and 7 are activated and multiple proteolytic
  events occur. FAD, Fadraciclib; Cip/Kip, cyclin-dependent kinase interacting protein/kinase
