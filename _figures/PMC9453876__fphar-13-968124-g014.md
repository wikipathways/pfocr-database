caption: The antidepressant mechanism of Honokiol. Honokiol activates HIF-1α and translocates
  HIF-1α into the nucleus. Target genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO), are regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α).
  HIF-1α can bind to the hypoxia response elements of many target genes to mediate
  protein synthesis. Ultimately, these growth factors are secreted into the extracellular
  space between cells. VEGF binds to and activates its receptor VEGFR-2 on adjacent
  cells. Activation of the VEGFR-2 receptor leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  signaling pathway in adjacent cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays an
  important role in nerve cell proliferation, survival, and synaptic plasticity, and
  finally improves depression. 2-ME and SU5416 were applied to investigate whether
  synaptic plasticity in neurons is dependent on the HIF-1α-VEGF pathway.
