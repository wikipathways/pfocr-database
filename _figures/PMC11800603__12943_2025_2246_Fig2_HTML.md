caption: Innervation in gliomas promotes tumor growth. Neurons secrete brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which binds to TrKB receptor and promotes the transfer
  of AMPA receptor in tumor cytoplasm to cell membrane. The amplitude of glutamate-induced
  current increased, and the larger depolarization amplitude promoted the proliferation
  of glioma cells. Neuroligin −3 (NLGN3) secreted in an activity-dependent manner
  activates a variety of carcinogenic pathways in glioma cells, including the PI3K-mTOR
  cascade, SRC kinase cascade, and SHC-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade. Original figure created
