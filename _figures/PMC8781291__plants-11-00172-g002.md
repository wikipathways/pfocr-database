caption: 'Biosynthesis and subcellular localization of flavonols in leave tissues.
  Flavonols are synthesized in the cytoplasm, on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) (right picture). The different enzymes involved in their biosynthesis
  (left box) are shown in blue and flavonols are indicated and framed by different
  colors. The pathway shown represents the general pathway found in model plants such
  as Arabidopsis thaliana. The first step begins with the synthesis of phenylalanine
  in the chloroplasts which is then transported to the cytosol via the phenylalanine
  plasticial cationic amino acid transporter (PhpCAT), identified in petunia. Abbreviations
  are as follows: C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, naringenin-chalcone
  synthase; DFR, bifunctional dihydroflavonol 4-reductase/flavanone 4-reductase; F3H,
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase; Phe, phenylalanine; UGT, UDP-dependent glucosyl transferase. Once
  synthetized, flavonols can be subjected to various modifications (glycosylation,
  methylation, etc.) and be stocked into vacuoles. They are transported into different
  compartments and through cells by MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion)
  and ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters families. In nucleus, vacuole, and chloroplast,
  flavonols will inhibit ROS accumulation.'
