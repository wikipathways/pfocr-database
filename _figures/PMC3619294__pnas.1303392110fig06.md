caption: Proposed model for how GIV’s GEF function is regulated by PKCθ. Upon ligand
  stimulation of RTKs and GPCRs GIV is recruited to the PM (, ), where GIV’s GEF motif
  activates Gi and releases free Gβγ subunits, which in turn activate Akt via class
  1 PI3Ks (). Gβγ is also known to activate PLC (), as can multiple other pathways
  downstream of RTKs and GPCRs (dashed arrows). Once activated, PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG)
  (). The latter is a potent stimulus for recruitment and activation of PKCθ. Activated
  PKCθ binds and phosphorylates GIV at Ser1689. This phosphoevent inhibits GIV’s ability
  to bind and activate Gi, thereby down-regulating GIV-Gi-dependent cellular processes.
  Thus, PKCθ-dependent phosphorylation of GIV serves as a negative feedback loop (dashed
  line) that terminates the GIV-Gi pathway of signaling.
