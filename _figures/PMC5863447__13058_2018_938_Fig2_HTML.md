caption: a Hierarchical clustering analysis of all differentially expressed proteins
  (DEPs) (812 proteins at p ≤ 0.05 with ≥ 2 unique peptides). b Insulin signalling
  pathway significantly over-represented in DEPs between good and poor outcome groups
  (Fisher exact p = 0.015) using KEGG Pathway analysis with DAVID. Tabulation of gene
  names of the observed differentially expressed proteins constituent to the pathway
  presented. c MetaCore showed that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was a significantly
  enriched process in the DEPs between good and poor outcome groups (FDR corrected
  p = 0.011). d Network analysis of differentially expressed proteins using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis showed participation of resistin in the small molecule biochemistry
  network (score = 23; focus molecules = 20)
