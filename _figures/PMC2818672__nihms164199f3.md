caption: A diagram of the BR signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. The left
  side of the dashed line (A) shows the inactive pathway when BR level is low, and
  the right side (B) shows the pathway when activated by BR. Although there is evidence
  for the formation of heterotetramer between BRI1 and BAK1, for simplicity a simple
  heterodimer model is shown. Components are in blue color when inactive and red color
  when active. (A) When BR level is low, BRI1 is associated with BKI1, which inhibits
  BRI1, as well as BSK1, which is to be phosphorylated upon activation of BRI1. BAK1
  and BSU1 remain inactive, whereas BIN2 phosphorylates BZR1 and BZR2/BES1, which
  inhibits DNA binding, promotes cytoplasmic localization through the 14-3-3 proteins,
  and accelerates degradation by the proteasome. (B) BR binding to the extracellular
  domain of BRI1 activates BRI1 through disassociation of BKI1 and oligomerization/transphosphorylation
  between BRI1 and BAK1. Activated BRI1 phosphorylates Ser230 of BSK1, which then
  interacts with and presumably activates BSU1. BSU1 dephosphorylates BIN2 at Tyr200
  to inactivate BIN2 and stop phosphorylation of BZR1/2, leading to accumulation of
  unphosphorylated BZR1/2, likely with help of an unknown phosphatase (PPase) that
  dephosphorylates BZR1/2. Unphosphorylated BZR1/BZR2 accumulate in the nucleus, where
  they directly regulate BR-responsive gene expression and plant development.
