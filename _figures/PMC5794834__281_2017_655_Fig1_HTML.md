caption: The complement amplification loop. Complement is activated by various triggers
  including binding of lectins or antibody to a target surface or by background ‘tickover’
  of the alternative pathway. The pathways converge at the point of C3 cleavage to
  C3b and C3a by the C3 convertase (either C3bBb or C4b2a). The larger cleavage fragment,
  C3b, binds CFB to form a proenzyme which is activated by CFD to form further convertase,
  C3bBb. This enzyme cleaves many molecules of C3 to C3b each of which is capable
  of amplifying the pathway as illustrated in the cycle (in bold), or forming the
  C5 convertase, C3bBbC3b (grey), which cleaves C5 to C5b and C5a and triggers the
  terminal pathway. This feedback cycle amplifies the signal from any small trigger
  to a large downstream effect. The proinflammatory by-products of complement activation
  are the anaphlylactic and chemotactic peptides, C3a and C5a and the membrane-associated
  macromolecular complex, MAC
