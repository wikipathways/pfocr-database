caption: 'Schematic representation of a simplified narrative scenario model of uncontrolled
  dysregulated DAMP-promoted pathways in light of the exposome and AOP concepts. The
  figure illustrates the sequelae of key events proposed to leading to cancer, reflecting
  the adverse outcome. The stress/injury → DAMP-promoted, dysregulated pathways leading
  to immune diseases start with the sequelae of events (MIE → KE3→n) as described
  for the controlled pathway (Fig. ). However, instead of proceeding to homeostatic
  events, the DAMP-induced pathways now provoke “pathogenic” KEs key events resulting
  in an adverse outcome in terms of cancer. The triggering “aberrant” event is the
  fifth KE that refers to (uncontrolled) chronic inflammation as characterized by
  the failure of an inflammation-resolution response. However, the exact mechanisms
  underlying chronic inflammatory microenvironment-promoted carcinogenesis are not
  fully understood. AO adverse outcome, cell./hum. cellular/humoral, DAMPs damage-associated
