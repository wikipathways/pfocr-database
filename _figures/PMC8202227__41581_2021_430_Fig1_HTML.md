caption: a | In the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of young cerebral arteries,
  upregulation of a 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic-acid (20-HETE)–short transient receptor
  potential channel 6 (TRPC6)-dependent pathway results in functional adaptation of
  cerebral arteries to hypertension. Hypertension is associated with increased expression
  of 20-HETE-producing cytochrome P4504A (CYP4504A) isoforms and TRPC6. High pressure
  activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2), leading to activation of arachidonic acid (AA)
  metabolism and the production of 20-HETE, which activates TRPC6 channels, resulting
  in increases in Ca2+ levels and myogenic contraction. 20-HETE also inhibits activation
  of hyperpolarizing Ca2+-activated potassium channels (BKca), which facilitates pressure-induced
  activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (LCa), contributing to Ca2+
  influx and myogenic contraction. This adaptation extends the range of cerebrovascular
  autoregulatory protection to higher blood pressure levels, optimizing tissue perfusion
  and protecting the cerebral microcirculation from increased arterial pressure and
  pressure pulsatility. b | In aged cerebral arteries, functional adaptation to hypertension
  mediated by activation of the VSMC 20-HETE–TRPC-dependent pathway is impaired. The
  failure of these arteries to exhibit a hypertension-induced adaptive increase in
  myogenic constriction results in myogenic contraction and cerebrovascular autoregulatory
  dysfunction. c | In the aged brain, the failure of proximal resistance arteries
  to functionally adapt to hypertension results in a mismatch between perfusion pressure
  and segmental vascular resistance that enables increased pulsatile pressure to penetrate
  the vulnerable downstream portion of the cerebral microcirculation. The resulting
  haemodynamic burden exacerbates age-related disruption of the blood–brain barrier
  (BBB), leading to extravasation of plasma factors (e.g. fibrinogen, thrombin, IgG),
  which promote microglia activation and neuroinflammation. Microglia-derived pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) induce neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction,. Increased microvascular
  pressure impairs the clearance function of the glymphatic (also known as glial-lymphatic)
  system and promotes the development of cerebral microhaemorrhages via redox-mediated
  activation of MMPs and consequential weakening of the vascular wall. The increased
  pressure also contributes to pathological remodelling of the microvascular network
  architecture by promoting microvascular thrombosis, capillary regression and microvascular
  rarefaction, resulting in ghost vessels. We posit that exacerbation of neuroinflammation,
  cerebral microhaemorrhages, glymphatic dysfunction and/or microvascular rarefaction
  are causally linked to hypertension-induced cognitive impairment in ageing, and
  also contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease in hypertensive elderly
  individuals. Figure adapted with permission from ref., American Physiological Society.
