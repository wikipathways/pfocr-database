caption: Metabolic pathways in cancer. The color-coded scheme illustrates the major
  cancer-promoted changes in relevant metabolic pathways observed in human carcinomas.
  Glycolysis, fermentation, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), lipogenesis and glutaminolysis
  are enhanced (red circles) in carcinomas. However, the mitochondrial oxidation of
  pyruvate, β-oxidation (β-Ox.), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) are marginally increased (pink circles) or diminished when compared to
  the activation of metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm. Glucose enters the cell by
  specific transporters and is metabolized at high rate through glycolysis to provide
  precursors such as glycerol-3-P and amino acids for lipid and protein synthesis
  (green box), respectively. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate in fermentation to regenerate
  NAD+ to allow glycolysis to proceed and is exported from the cell. In addition,
  glucose is catabolized through the PPP to obtain NADPH (orange box), for biosynthetic
  processes and the maintenance of the cellular redox state, and ribose-5-P, for nucleic
  acid biosynthesis (green box). In the mitochondria, pyruvate is oxidized to generate
  acetyl-CoA that feeds the TCA cycle. Fatty acids (FA) oxidation also feeds acetyl-CoA
  to the TCA cycle. Citrate in the TCA cycle is drained to the cytoplasm for the biosynthesis
  of FA and cholesterol. Glutaminolysis feeds the TCA cycle with glutamate. The electrons
  obtained in the oxidation of pyruvate and FA are transferred to the electron transport
  chain system for the synthesis of the ATP by OXPHOS (purple)
