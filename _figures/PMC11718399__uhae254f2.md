caption: 'Triterpene biosynthetic pathway in plants. The MVA pathway generates 5-carbon
  terpenoid precursors, IPP, and DMAPP, which are converted to 2,3-oxidosqualene.
  In the late triterpenoid pathway, the triterpene structures are diversified with
  the sequential action of OSCs, P450s, UGTs, ATs, 2-ODDs, and other scaffold-decorating
  enzymes. Abbreviations: AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
