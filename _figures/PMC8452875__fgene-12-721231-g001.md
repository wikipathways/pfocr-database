caption: 'Molecular and anatomical structure of the circadian clock system. Left panel:
  Molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock mainly consist of three interlocked
  transcriptional-translational feedback loops. Transcriptional factors activate the
  transcription of repressor genes via binding to promoter regions containing different
  combinations of three cis-elements and thereby generating a different phase. These
  protein products of the repressor genes then enter the nucleus and feed back to
  repress their own transcription to close the circadian loop. Right panel: Circadian
  clocks exist in almost all tissues in mammals. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN) in the brain serves as the master clock or the central clock, which
  is entrained by light through the retinohypothalamic tract pathway. Neuropeptides
  AVP and VIP maintain the robust cell-autonomous rhythmicity and light entrainment,
  respectively, in the SCN. The SCN clock synchronizes slave clocks in peripheral
  tissues through neuronal and humoral pathways throughout the body.'
