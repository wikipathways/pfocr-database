caption: The proposed working pathway for ginsenoside Rg5 action in hypoxic adipose
  tissue. Saturated fatty acid PA induces hypoxia with ER stress in adipose tissue,
  and then increases succinate formation. Succinate promotes IL-1β production through
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and then induces cAMP/PKA signaling by inactivation
  of PDE3B, leading to lipolysis. PA also decreases AMP concentration, and then increases
  cAMP accumulation. The release of FFAs increases cytosolic DAG, PKC translocation,
  ceramide accumulation and inhibits insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation, thus leading
  to insulin resistance in muscle. Rg5 inhibits lipolysis by suppression of succinate
  accumulation in hypoxic adipocytes and thus prevents insulin resistance in muscle.
