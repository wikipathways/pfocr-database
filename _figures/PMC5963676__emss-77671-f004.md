caption: Pathway to pantothenate in E, coli and schematic of characterized and predicted
  and confirmed protein-protein interactions in the pathway. α-Ketoisovalerate 1 is
  converted to pantoate 3 by the action of ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (KPHMT)
  and either ketopantoate reductase (KPR) or acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase (AHIR).
  Pantothenate synthetase (PS) catalyses the ATP-dependent ligation of β-alanine 5
  and pantoate to form pantothenate. Interaction of PanZ with aspartate decarboxylase
  (ADC) is required both for activation of the PanD zymogen to form ADC and for subsequent
  regulation of ADC catalytic activity.
