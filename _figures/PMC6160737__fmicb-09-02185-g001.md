  from Salmonella enterica; ADH2, alcohol dehydrogenase 2; ALD6, NADP-dependent aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; BcBAPAT, β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase
  from Bacillus cereus; CIT, citrate synthase; EcHPDH, 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase
  from E. coli; GAPN, NADP-dependent G3P dehydrogenase; CaMCR, malonyl-CoA reductase
