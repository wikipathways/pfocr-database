caption: Model for DAF-18 action. AGE-1 is the major signal transducer for the activated
  DAF-2 insulin receptor-like molecule in regulation of dauer development and lifespan.
  AGE-1 is predicted to produce PIP3, which negatively regulates lifespan and dauer-formation
  processes. DAF-18, the PTEN homolog, functions to dephosphorylate PIP3 and thus
  antagonizes the action of DAF-2 and AGE-1. DAF-18 may also be negatively regulated
  by DAF-2 (dashed line).

  longevity and dauer formation in an insulin receptor-like signaling pathway.
