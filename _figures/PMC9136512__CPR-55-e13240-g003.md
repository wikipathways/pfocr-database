caption: Schematic model for the effect of CDK5RAP3 deficiency on cell growth. In
  normal, CDK5RAP3 is distributed in the centrosome, spindle and endoplasmic reticulum,
  the cells undergoes the growth and proliferation. However, when CDK5RAP3 is deficiency,
  the cell cycle is blocked in G2/M and cell proliferation slows down, and the partial
  cycle block does not cause apoptosis. Additionally, CDK5RAP3 distributed in the
  endoplasmic reticulum combined with the deficiency of RPL26 will inhibit the mTOR
  pathway, aggravate autophagy and trigger apoptosis
