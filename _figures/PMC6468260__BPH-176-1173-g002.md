caption: A schematic presentation of the autophagy–lysosome pathway in Parkinson's
  disease. (a) Under physiological conditions, chaperone‐mediated autophagy (CMA)
  is the main route for α‐synuclein degradation. Wild‐type α‐synuclein is internalized
  to the lysosomal lumen through binding to lysosome‐associated membrane protein type
  2a (LAMP‐2A) receptor. (b) In the pathological condition, mutant or dopamine‐modified
  α‐synuclein strongly binds to the LAMP‐2A receptor and impairs the CMA pathway.
  CMA inactivation leads to aberrant accumulation of toxic α‐synuclein. (c) In response
  to blockage of CMA, clearance of aggregated α‐synuclein occurs by a compensatory
  mechanism that is up‐regulation of macroautophagy. (d) Up‐regulation of macroautophagy
  might increase autophagosome accumulation. Moreover, the interaction of oligomeric
  α‐synuclein with organelle lipid bilayers could disrupt and permeabilize the lysosomal
  membrane, causing the leakage of lysosomal hydrolases to the cytosol and accumulation
  of autophagic vacuoles. (e) Pharmacological activation of the transcription factor
  EB (TFEB) promotes lysosomal biogenesis and alleviates autophagosome accumulation
