caption: Functions of 14-3-3 in tumor-suppressor pathways. (a) The mammalian Hippo
  pathway transmits signals received at the cell surface, such as cell–cell contact,
  through the sequential activation of the Mst1/2–WW45 and Lats1/2–Mob kinase complexes.
  The Lats kinases phosphorylate YAP and TAZ on sites that mediate 14-3-3 binding,
  thus, inactivating the function of these transcriptional coactivators by means of
  their cytoplasmic retention. (b) β-catenin functions as a transcriptional coactivator
  in the Wnt signaling pathway. Cby antagonizes β-catenin signaling by preventing
  the interaction between β-catenin and the Tcf transcription factor enhancer and
  by mediating the formation of a stable β-catenin–Cby–14-3-3 tripartite complex that
  results in the nuclear export of β-catenin.
