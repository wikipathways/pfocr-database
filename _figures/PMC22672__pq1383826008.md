caption: Orb6 kinase is proposed to be part of a regulatory cascade contributing to
  the mitotic control and responding to the Ras1 and Cdc42-dependent morphological
  control pathway via the Pak1/Shk1 kinase. Orb6 kinase regulates independently cell
  morphogenesis and the cell cycle, mediating its effect on p34cdc2 kinase directly
  through the Wee1 protein kinase or through some other mechanism dependent on p34cdc2
  tyrosine phosphorylation.
papertitle: Fission yeast orb6, a ser/thr protein kinase related to mammalian rho
  kinase and myotonic dystrophy kinase, is required for maintenance of cell polarity
  and coordinates cell morphogenesis with the cell cycle.
