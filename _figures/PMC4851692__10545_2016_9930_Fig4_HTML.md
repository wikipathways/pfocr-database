caption: Effects of C10 on gene expression. A 6 day treatment with C10 reduced the
  expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as PCK2, which encodes
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, an enzyme important in the gluconeogenesis pathway.
  The complex I supernumerary subunit NDUFC1 (of unknown function), was also reduced.
  Glucose is metabolised to acetyl-CoA, which enters into the tricarboxylic cycle.
  Electrons derived from the Krebs cycle enter oxidative phosphorylation through complex
  I, as opposed to those derived through β-oxidation, which bypass complex I and enter
  oxidative phosphorylation through complex III. Additionally, PDK3 and PDK4 were
  upregulated. These genes encode the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, which
  inhibits the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. Genes involved in fatty acid metabolism
  upregulated after 6 day C10 treatment include CPT1A (which encodes a protein responsible
  for fatty acid transport into mitochondria) and ACADVL, which encodes the enzyme
  VLCAD required for the metabolism of fatty acids with a chain length of 14–20 carbons.
  ATP50 (which encodes a subunit of ATP synthase) also showed increased expression
  in response to treatment with C10
