caption: 'A schematic diagram depicting how peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is generated by
  iNOS and NADPH oxidase to stimulate [LMW-Fe]i response from a chelatable pool of
  iron for activation of IKK and NF-κB in LPS or TNFα-treated macrophages. The inhibitors
  indicated in red are used to demonstrate the involvement of iNOS, NADPH oxidase,
  superoxide anion, peroxynitrite, and [LMW-Fe]i in this pathway: L-NIL, L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine;
  dnRAC1, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1; Cu, Zn-SOD, superoxide dismutase; FeTTPS,
  5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron (III) chloride; L1, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one;
  HBED, N,N′-bis-2-hydroxybenzylethlenediamine-N,N-diacetic acid. B. A schematic summary
  of how Fe2+ generated by the [LMW-Fe]i response, activates p21Ras and TAK1 in caveolin-1
  positive endocytic compartments and their interactive activation of PI3K and downstream
  kinases for IKK activation. In these pathways, superoxide anion (O2·−) inhibits
  protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) leading to activation of c-Src (Src) and then
  p21Ras. At the same time O2·− activates TAK1 via K63-linked TRAF6 polyubiquitination
  (TRAF6-(K63)polyUb) and its association with TAK1 via TAB. Activation of p21Ras
  and TAK1 results in activation of MEK1 and NIK, respectively, which phosphorylate
  IKK for activation. P21Ras and TAK1 also contribute to activation of PI3K, further
  supporting IKK activation.'
