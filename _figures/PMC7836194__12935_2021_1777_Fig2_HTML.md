caption: Curcumin mediates miRNA regulation in PC. Curcumin treatment modulates several
  PC pathways by up- or down-regulating the miRNAs associated with several cell pathways.
  It induces miR-143 expression via FOXD3. MiR-143 inhibits its epigenetic silencer
  DNMT1 and DNMT2B and also ATG2B and promotes sensitization to radiotherapy. Curcumin
  also promotes cell cycle arrest by inhibiting B-catenin/cmyc complex via miR-34,
  sequesters lncRNA-ROR and enhances miR-145 bioavailable, leading to anti-proliferation
  and invasiveness. Curcumin also inhibits miR-21 and induce cell proliferation suppression
  by blocking NF-kB pathway and apoptosis via PTEN upregulation
