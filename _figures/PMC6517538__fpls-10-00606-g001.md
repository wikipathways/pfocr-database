caption: Alternative RNA splicing regulates the timing of flowering transition through
  diverse regulatory mechanisms. In response to developmental and environmental cues,
  numerous flowering time genes undergo alternative splicing. The alternatively spliced
  RNA isoforms are regulated either at the RNA level through the NMD pathway or translated
  to multiple protein products. The alternatively spliced protein variants modulate
  the stability or function of different variants by forming heterodimers. They also
  interact differentially with their interacting partners in a competitive manner.
  (A) Attenuation of the DNA binding affinity of COα by forming non-DNA-binding, COα-COβ
  heterodimers in photoperiodic flowering. While the COα-COα homodimers are able to
  efficiently bind to DNA, the COα-COβ heterodimers are excluded from DNA binding.
  (B) Facilitation of the interaction of COα with the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase by
  COβ in photoperiodic flowering. While COα monomers are poorly targeted by COP1,
  COβ facilitates the interaction of COα with COP1, resulting in an elevated ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of the COα proteins. (C) Differential stabilization of alternatively
  spliced transcripts against NMD pathway in thermosensory flowering. The alternatively
  spliced transcripts are degraded through the NMD pathway. (D) Attenuation of the
  FT2α/FDL2/14-3-3 florigenic complex formation by FT2β in aging-induced flowering
  time control. The alternatively spliced protein isoform FT2β inhibits the formation
  of the FT2α-containing florigenic complexes by forming FT2α-FT2β heterodimers in
  Brachypodium.
