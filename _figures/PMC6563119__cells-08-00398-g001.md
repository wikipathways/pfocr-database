caption: Canonical and alternative Hippo pathways. The heart of the Hippo pathway
  consists of the kinase module (indicated in red) and the transcriptional module
  (indicated in blue). The kinase module includes 11 kinases, namely mammalian STE20-like
  protein kinases (MST1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases
  (MAP4K1-7), and large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2), as well as their activating
  adaptor proteins, salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1), Ras-related
  proteins (RAP2A/B/C), and MOB kinase activators (MOB1A/B). The transcriptional module
  includes the transcriptional co-activators, namely, yes-associated protein (YAP)
  and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), and in addition,
  the transcription factors TEA domain family members (TEAD1–4). When the upstream
  signals are integrated to activate the Hippo pathway, LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate
  and inhibit YAP/TAZ. Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ promotes their proteasomal degradation
  or cytoplasmic retention via 14-3-3 binding. In contrast, when the kinase module
  is inactivated (the Hippo pathway is inactivated), hypophosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate
  into the nucleus wherein they bind to TEAD1–4 and thus induce proliferative and
  anti-apoptotic gene transcription. In this review, we define the signaling that
  specifically regulates LATS1/2 kinase activity and/or YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity
  as the “canonical” Hippo pathway. The other signaling cascades that involve MST1/2
  but do not regulate LATS1/2 kinases or YAP/TAZ are defined as the “alternative”
  Hippo pathway. MST1/2 have been shown to modulate a number of proteins, including
  nuclear Dbf2-related kinases (NDR1/2, also known as STK38/STK38L), forkhead box
  O (FOXO1/3), protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
  in the regulation of immune system.
