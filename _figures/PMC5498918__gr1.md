caption: Schematic Illustration of DBZ-Releasing NPs for Intracellular Induction of
  Browning through Inhibition of Notch Signaling after Local Injection into Inguinal
  WATActivation of Notch signaling involves binding of Dll or Jag family ligands to
  Notch receptors (Notch1–Notch4), the release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD)
  via γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic cleavage, and translocation of NICD to the
  nucleus where it binds Rbpj transcriptional complex and activates the transcription
  of Hairy/enhancer-of-split (Hes) and Hes-related with YRPW motif protein (Hey) family
  genes. Hes1 directly binds to the promoter regions of Prdm16 and Ppargc1a to inhibit
  the transcription of these two master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and
  beige adipogenesis. As the proteolytic cleavage of NICD is necessary for Notch signaling
  to occur, pharmacological blockage of this cleavage using NP-based intracellular
  DBZ delivery provides an effective pathway to inhibit Notch signaling transduction
  and promote browning. Once taken up by the adipocytes, the NPs release DBZ to locally
  inhibit Notch signaling over an extended period.
