caption: 'Flowchart of the study. Figure orientation from top to bottom. a Blood was
  extracted from 520 healthy individuals on which (b) extensive immunophenotyping
  was performed and simultaneously (c) molecular inversion probe sequencing data was
  produced from the coding regions of 48 Interleukin-1 pathway-related genes. d The
  resulting cytokine production after stimulation was measured and log-transformed
  prior to analysis. e The identified variants were grouped over three different levels
  into sets based on gene-encoded protein function: I. Gene level, with 48 genes;
  II. Subpathway level, grouping genes into 6 subpathways that represent an immunological
  cascade in the IL-1-mediated inflammatory response; and III. Inflammatory level,
  with two groups that distinguish between pro- and anti-inflammatory roles of the
  respective gene-encoded proteins. f Variants within each set were appropriately
  weighed based on minor allele frequency (MAF), and common and rare variants were
  classified based on cohort allele frequency (AF) threshold of 5%. g Finally, variant
  analysis was performed by the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) on only common
  variants (I.SKAToC); common and rare variants combined (II.SKATjoint); and only
  rare variants using the best combination of the SKAT and burden test (III.SKATO)'
