caption: CircRNAs and the related signaling pathways in human cancers. Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway plays an important role in the progression of human cancers. Cir-ITH
  and circ-cdr1as are two key circRNAs that regulate the proteins or miRNAs in Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. CircTCF25, circ-Foxo3 and circZNF292 are three key circRNAs that
  regulate cell cycle progression in various cancers. MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT are key
  signaling pathways involved in human cancers. Several circRNAs such as ciRS-7, circ001042,
  circ-TTBK2 and circTCF25 have been identified as regulators of these signaling networks.
