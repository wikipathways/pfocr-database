caption: 'Fibroblast Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-related protein-1 (LRP-1) signaling
  in renal fibrogenesis. Interaction of LRP-1 and its ligands mediates fibroblast
  differentiation and transdifferentiation. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)
  binds to LRP-1 and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by activation
  of: (1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk)1/2 pathway to stimulate matrix
  metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 production and trigger the epithelial mesenchymal transition
  (EMT); (2) p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad pathway to promote fibroblast
  survival; (3) p90RSK and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β pathway to induce proliferation;
  (4) TGF-β1-mediated β1 integrin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway to induce
  myofibroblast activation. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) binds and induces
  LRP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and promotes TGF-β1-mediated Erk1/2 activation,
  which leads to synergistic activation of myofibroblasts. Figure was modified with
