caption: 'Regulation of Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway by BMAL1. Nrf2 is constitutively produced
  in the cell; however, in the absence of environmental stress, Nrf2 is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by binding to an inhibitory protein, Keap1, which promotes continuous
  ubiquitinylation. Keap1 serves as a bridge between Nrf2 and the Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase. Cellular stress leads to modification of reactive cysteines within Keap1
  that induces conformational changes resulting in Nrf2 stabilization. Here BMAL1
  binds to the antioxidant response element through the E-box element present on the
  Nrf2 promoter leading to the transcription of Nrf2 and stabilization of the same.
  The NRF2 protein then translocates into the nucleus. There, it forms a heterodimer
  with other transcription regulators, such as small Maf proteins. The NRF2-sMaf complex
  binds to the ARE-containing genes in the nucleus involved in detoxification, anti-oxidation,
  anti-inflammation, and metabolism. The deficiency of BMAL1 disrupts the circadian
  rhythm of the Nrf2 pathway leading to cellular damage. Abbreviations: ARE, Antioxidant
