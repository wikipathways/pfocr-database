caption: The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), like other transcription factors, binds
  to many genomic loci that serve as enhancer and silencer elements for specific genes
  and regulate the transcription of these genes. GR regulates genes involved in many
  physiological pathways, including anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and tissue remodeling
  pathways. Different GR target genes require different sets of coregulators (colored
  rectangles) for glucocorticoid (black circles) regulation of their transcription.
  Each coregulator can undergo specific post-translational modifications (PTM) controlled
  by a variety of signal transduction pathways. Different signaling pathways control
  modifications to different coregulators. The modifications regulate the activities
  of the coregulators. GR target genes belonging to a specific physiological pathway
  use similar sets of coregulators, while GR target genes belonging to different physiological
  pathways require different sets of coregulators. Stimulation of a specific signaling
  pathway will affect the activities of one or a specific subset of coregulators.
  As a result, activation of a specific signaling pathway will alter the glucocorticoid
  regulation of some, but not all of the physiological pathways targeted by GR, thus,
  in effect, “fine tuning” the physiological responses caused by glucocorticoids by
  regulating the activities of specific coregulators.
