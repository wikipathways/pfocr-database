caption: 'Transcriptional changes of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway members
  in the cerebellum of canine distemper virus (CDV)-infected compared to control dogs.
  Left side: RNA of CDV is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PKR, MDA5,
  TLR3, TLR7), which leads to the activation of transcription factors (NFκB, IRF1,
  IRF3, IRF5, IRF7). These transcription factors translocate into the nucleus and
  induce IFN-I expression. Right side: Receptor binding of IFN-I activates the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway leading to the formation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers in the cytoplasm.
  These heterodimers form a complex with IRF9, termed interferon-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3). In the nucleus, ISGF3 induces the transcription of interferon-stimulated
  genes including ISG15, MX1, MX2, PKR, IRF7, OAS1, OAS2 and OASL. IRF7 also acts
  in a positive feedback loop to stimulate IFN-I expression. Columns behind the gene
  symbols display fold changes in three different stages of CDV-infection (acute;
  subacute; chronic). Fold changes are shown on a logarithmic scale.'
