caption: 'Schematic diagram of ATG8-mediated selective autophagy pathways in plants.
  Various ATG8-binding proteins act as selective autophagy receptors and mediate the
  delivery of specific target cargos to autophagosomes for degradation. NBR1, the
  first autophagy receptor identified in plants, mediates selective degradation of
  ubiquitinated protein aggregates and virulence factors; degradation of chloroplasts
  is mediated by three autophagic pathways: First, ATI1 binds and transports thylakoid
  proteins to vacuole for autophagic degradation through ATI1-PS bodies; Then, stromal
  components including Rubisco are engulfed by autophagic membrane to form Rubisco-containing
  bodies (RCBs) that are delivered to vacuole for degradation; Finally, the whole
  chloroplasts are entirely engulfed by the vacuolar membrane for degradation. ATG11
  is involved in the autophagic degradation of mitochondria; however, the cargo receptor
  of mitophagy remains unknown. PEX6 and PEX10 may function as potential pexophagy
  receptors. In turn, degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by another
  ATI protein, ATI3. RPN10 is involved in selective degradation of inactivated proteasomes
  extensively ubiquitylated. The selective autophagic degradation of BR signaling
  pathway transcription-factor BES1 is mediated by DSK2. Aquaporin PIP2;7 and porphyrin
  (heme) are both recognized by receptor TSPO and subjected to selective autophagic
  degradation. ORM1/2 proteins mediate the degradation of plant immune receptor FLS2.
  In addition to cooperating with autophagy receptors, some AIM/UIM-containing proteins,
  such as ATG1, ATG11, and GSNOR1, also bind directly to ATG8 to mediate their degradation.'
