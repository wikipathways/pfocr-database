caption: CoQ synthesis and atovaquone. A. Generalized scheme of CoQ biosynthesis de
  novo. The benzoquinone ring is derived from chorismate, which is produced by the
  shikimic acid pathway. The polyprenyl moiety is derived from the isoprenoid pathway.
  After condensation of PHBA and a polyprenyl diphosphate, several modifications at
  the aromatic ring moiety occur, leading to the production of the completed CoQ molecule.
  B. Structure of the hydroxynaphthoquinone atovaquone (566C80), an analog of ubiquinone.
