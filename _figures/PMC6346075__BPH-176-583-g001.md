caption: Overview of the transsulfuration pathway. The pathway results in the generation
  of cysteine from homocysteine, which in turn, is derived from dietary methionine
  in mammals. CBS condenses homocysteine with serine to generate cystathionine, the
  substrate for CSE, to generate cysteine. CSE can generate H2S from either cysteine
  or homocysteine. While CSE can utilize cysteine to generate H2S, CBS uses a combination
  of cysteine and homocysteine to generate H2S. A third H2S‐generating enzyme, MPST,
  in conjunction with cysteine amino acid transferase (CAT) utilizes cysteine to generate
  H2S. The transsulfuration pathway intersects with the transmethylation pathway at
  homocysteine, which can be remethylated back to methionine by N5,N10‐methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). The cysteine generated by the pathway can be chanelled into GSH
  synthesis by the action of the enzymes, γ‐glutamyl cysteine synthetase (γ‐GCS) and
  glutathione synthetase (GS) or converted to other sulfur‐containing molecules such
  as taurine. Taurine is generated by the action of three enzymes, CDO, cysteine sulfinic
  acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and hypotaurine dehydrogenase (HTAU‐DH).
