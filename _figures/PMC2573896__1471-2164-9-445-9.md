caption: Metabolic pathways leading to synthesis of metabolites found differentially
  present in hop organogenic cultures. Metacyc database was used to elucidate metabolic
  networks . For simplicity reasons all reactions were shown as unidirectional. Full
  and dashed arrows represent direct and indirect biochemical reactions respectively.
  Glycolysis I pathway is highlighted in grey boxes. Genes which were found differentially
  expressed and could be integrated with metabolomics data are shown. DAHPS, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  synthase.
