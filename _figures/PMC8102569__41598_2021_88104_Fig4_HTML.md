caption: Schematic diagram of a proposed metabolic pathway using plasma metabolites
  derived from metabolite and lipid profiling of experimental groups including diabetic
  macular edema (DME) and non-DME subjects. Metabolites labelled with blue characters
  indicate that relative metabolite levels were lower in DME cases than in non-DME
  subjects. Metabolites labelled with red characters indicate that relative metabolite
  levels were higher in DME cases than in non-DME patients. Asterisks indicate statistically
  significant differences in levels of metabolites distinguishing DME and non-DME
  individuals (p < 0.05). The metabolic pathway wasmodified from the reported Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
