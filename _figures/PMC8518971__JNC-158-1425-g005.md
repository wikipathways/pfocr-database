caption: The diverse functions of cholinergic signaling in the human body. Cholinergic
  pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) are crucial in cognitive processes
  and degeneration of cholinergic projections in the basal forebrain leads to cognitive
  impairment. Further, non‐neuronal cholinergic signaling participates in regulating
  immune responses of glial cells and immune cells in the CNS and the periphery. The
  cholinergic anti‐inflammatory pathway provides a brain–body signaling route over
  the vagus nerve and regulates the inflammatory responses in macrophages. Fine‐tuning
  of systemic immunity is of great importance in acute CNS injuries, which elicit
  strong neuroinflammatory response, leading to infiltration of peripheral immune
  cells to brain parenchyma. For more details about the nAChRs (α and β subunits)
  and mAChRs (M1‐M5) in immune/glial cells, see Guizzetti et al. (), Stolero and Frenkel
  (), and Fujii et al. (); most relevant receptors, discussed in this manuscript,
  are highlighted in red. *The expression patterns differ between the immune cell
  subpopulations; see Fujii et al. (). AD, Alzheimer's disease; AChE, acetylcholinesterase;
  ChAT, choline acetyltransferase; PD, Parkinson's disease; TBI, traumatic brain injury
