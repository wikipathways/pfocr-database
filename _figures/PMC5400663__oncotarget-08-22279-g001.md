caption: (1) GBM cells can release low levels of L-Glu mainly by xCT antiporter [,
  ]. (2) Due to loss of EAAT2, GBM cells possessed a low re-uptake rate of L-Glu,
  maintaining high concentrations of this amino acid in tumor environment []. (3)
  High levels of L-Glu can activate specific NMDAR, which causes neuronal death by
  excitotoxicity and facilitates tumor bulk expansion []. (4) GBM cells expressing
  mutated Ca+2-permeable AMPAR exhibited enhanced migration and proliferation and
  its blockade led to inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis []. (5) mGluR3
  activation by L-Glu induced GBM proliferation and kept these cells under undifferentiated
  state. In contrast, mGluR3 inhibition eliminated this constraint and promoted astroglial
  differentiation [, , , ]. (6) Accordingly to Arcella et al. (2005) [] and Ciceroni
  et al. (2013) [], MAPK axis supported mGluR3-induced GBM proliferation, (7) since
  mGluR3 stimulation increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation and its blockade reduced p-Erk1/2
  levels. mGluR3 inhibition plus MEK1/2 blockade showed an additive antiproliferative
  effect on GBM cells []. (8) Moreover, mGluR3-dependet activation of MAPK pathway
  limited SMAD1/5/8-induced astroglial differentiation, which kept GBM cells under
  undifferentiated state. Exogenous SMAD1/5/8 stimulation or MEK inhibition prevented
  this effect []. (9) mGluR3 activation stimulated (10) phosphorylation of Akt/PKB
  via PI3K activation and this effect was reversed by receptor inhibition [, ]. (11)
  mGluR3-PI3K axis activation presented a permissive role on GBM cell cycle progression,
  since mGluR3 inhibition by LY341495 decreased cyclin D1/D2 immunocontent [, ], an
  early marker of G1/S phase transition []. (12) mGluR3-PI3K axis was also related
  to GBM chemoresistance. GSC become sensitive to TMZ, an alkylating agent, only if
  mGluR3 was inhibited or silenced [], which was also mimicked by PI3K blockade. NF-κB
  activation by Akt/PKB limits pro-apoptotic activity of alkylating agents in GBM
  cells []. TMZ increased levels of p-IκB and this effect was reversed by mGluR3 or
  PI3K blockers. NF-κB bockade enabled TMZ toxicity, occluding permissive action of
  mGluR3 inhibition, indicating NF-κB lies downstream of Akt/PKB in pathway that restrains
  TMZ toxicity. (13) Akt/PKB also regulates mTOR, which promotes mRNA translation
  and protein synthesis through p70 S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation []. This signaling
  pathway was showed to support GBM cells survival []. (14) Concomitant activation
  of EGFR and mGluR3 could act synergistically in GBM aggressiveness, since simultaneous
  inhibition of these receptors caused maximum apoptosis in GBM cells, as well as
  reduced their migration. (15) mGluR1 stimulation promoted GBM cells survival through
  PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR pathway activation []. mGluR1 inhibition markedly decreased cell
  viability and inhibited PI3K and Akt/PKB phosphorylation. mGluR1 inhibition also
  decreased levels of p-mTOR and P70 S6K
