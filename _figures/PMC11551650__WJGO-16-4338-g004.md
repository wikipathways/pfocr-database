caption: 'The hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met axis activates the Hedgehog pathway through
  downstream signaling. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met axis activates the
  Hedgehog pathway through its downstream signaling pathway. After binding to the
  c-Met receptor, hepatocyte growth factor activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 and protein kinase B signaling pathways, further promoting the activation
  of GLI transcription factors, and thereby initiating the transcription activity
  of the Hedgehog pathway. HGF: Hepatocyte growth factor; Hh: Hedgehog; SPH: Secreted
  protein, acidic and rich in cysteine; MEK: Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT3: Signal
