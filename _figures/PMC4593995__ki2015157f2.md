caption: Nicotinic acid metabolism. NAD+, an essential factor in cellular respiration
  and metabolism, is produced through metabolism of nicotinic acid. NAD+ is synthesized
  via a de novo pathway from essential amino acid. NAD+ is also recycled through a
  salvage pathway where iNAMPT acts as a rate-limiting enzyme. In case NAD+ salvage
  was insufficient, Sirt1 activity decreased, further downregulating iNAMPT activity
  and salvage pathway. NAD, nicotine amide dinucleotide; Npt, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NaMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide; Nmnat, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase;
  NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; iNAMPT, intracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NMNAM, n-methylnicotinamide; Nnmt, nicotinamide n-methyltransferase.
