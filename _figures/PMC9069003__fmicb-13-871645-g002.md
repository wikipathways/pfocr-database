caption: LOPs-dependent activation of lipids-related intracellular pathways. (A) Ozone
  is highly unstable and reacts in milliseconds with biological fluids by oxidizing
  lipids producing lipid ozonization products LOPs mechanism of LOPS-mediated immune
  system activation through the activation of phospholipase-linked pathway. LOPs,
  in particular 4-HNE, transduce the cell signal by activating phospholipase C (PLC)
  which hydrolyzes a membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol l-4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to produce second messengers, i.e., inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DG). IP3 binds to the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) on the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) membrane, resulting in a release of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol.
  Increased levels of Ca2+ in the cytosol activate calcineurin, a Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent
  phosphatase which acts dephosphorylating the nuclear factors of activated T cells
  (NFAT) and transports them to the nucleus. Here, NFAT then induces transcription
  of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ triggering the first inflammatory
  response that precedes immunoactivation. In parallel, hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLC
  results in production of DG, which activates a protein kinase C (PKC) and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK). The activation of these kinases leads to synthesis and activation
  of Fos and Jun, the components of the heterodimeric transcription factor activator
  protein 1 (AP-1). Then, AP-1 complex binds cooperatively with NFAT to composite
  NFAT:AP-1 sites in the regulatory regions to activate transcription of NFAT target
  genes, which carry to the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (B) Mechanism
  of LOPS-mediated synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators through the activation
  of phospholipase A2-linked pathway. 4-HNE can induce the synthesis of arachidonic
  acid through the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Arachidonic acid can be
  converted in prostaglandins (PGs) and platelet activating factor (PAF) via the activation
  of cyclooxygenase (COX), or in leukotrienes via the activation of lipoxygenase (LOX).
  These compounds induce the transcription of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-kB), whose translocation into the nucleus, allow the further
  synthesis of the pro-inflammatory COX or cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). Part

    LOPs, in particular 4-HNE, transduce the cell signal by activating phospholipase
