caption: General metabolic profiles of naïve, activated, and memory T-cells. (A) Naïve
  T-cells are quiescent and perform catabolic metabolism to accommodate basic energy
  requirements. (B) Activated effector T-cells, whereas switch to anabolic metabolism
  to meet increasing energy demands as well as for biosynthesis to support functionality
  including proliferation, growth, and cytokine secretion. (C) Memory cells, like
  naïve cells, are quiescent and perform metabolic catabolism. While naïve and memory
  T-cells mostly rely on oxidative phosphorylation (shown in orange), activated ones
  are metabolically rewired to upregulate aerobic glycolysis (shown in red). Activated
  T-cells also require glutaminolysis (in green) and the pentose phosphate pathway
  (in navy blue) to support their activities. Memory T-cells rely on fatty acid oxidation
  (in purple) and they have increased mitochondrial mass and maintain substantial
  spare respiratory capacity to enable survival and rapid recall to antigen challenge.
  A brief summary of the major metabolic mechanisms is described in the inlet.
