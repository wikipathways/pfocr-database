caption: EphA2 signaling in normal (A) and cancer (B) cells. (A) In untransformed
  cells, EphA2 is engaged by its ligands, mainly EphrinA1 and highly tyrosine-phosphorylated.
  This mediates cell adhesion/repulsion through activation of Rac/Rho GTPAses and
  RASGap. Ligand binding also mediates inhibition of MAPK and AKT. Upon ligand binding,
  the EphA2 is targeted to endosomes in a CBL-mediated process. (B) In cancer cells,
  unliganded and overexpressed EphA2 is mainly phosphorylated in ser897 by PI3k/AKT,
  ERK/RSK, PKA, and PKC, in response to oncogenic stimuli The Akt-mTORC1, Raf-MEK-ERK,
  and Pyk2-Src-ERK signaling pathways were identified as the downstream signaling
  of the EphA2 non-canonical pathway. S897-phosphorylated EphA2 recruits Ephexin4
  that in turn acts on RhoG to promote cell migration and anoikis resistance (this
  latter effect through a RhoG-AKT pathway). Further, FAK-integrin mediates cell adhesion
  and migration and may promote CSC features, including drug resistance (please also
  see Figure 3). The phospho-tyrosine content of EphA2 is also reduced by the LMW-PTPase,
  frequently overexpressed in cancer. The pro-tumorigenic contribution of EphA2 may
  thus derive from ligand independency, overexpression, reduced phospho-tyrosine content,
  and increased serine/threonine phosphorylation. Additionally, ligand-stimulated
  EphA2 negatively modulates the recycling of EGFR, by inhibiting AKT/PIKfyve, thus
  reducing the amount of available EGFR on the plasma membrane and migration. On the
  other hand, such feedback is attenuated in transformed cells, where EGFR levels
  in the plasma membrane are increased and this correlates with ligand independency
  of EphA2 and activation of motile responses to EGF.
