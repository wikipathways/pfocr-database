caption: Main molecular mechanisms involved in the antioxidant activity and the beneficial
  effects of dietary polyphenols in metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative
  diseases. The dietary polyphenols mentioned in this figure have been demonstrated
  to have a beneficial impact on the prevention of these diseases by different mechanisms
  including increasing the intracellular levels of AMP and NAD+, activating CaMKKβ
  or inhibiting AKT. The regulation of these molecular pathways results in the activation
  of both AMPK and SIRT1 activities. AMPK activates SIRT1, and SIRT1 activates AMPK
  by inducing LKB1 activity. Activated AMPK diminishes mTORC1 pathway activation,
  reducing ER stress, activates autophagy, and stimulates mitochondrial function and
  antioxidant defenses, and, consequently, reduces oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.
  Green arrows indicate activation and red lines indicate inhibition of the activity
  of the target protein. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase;
  AKT, protein kinase B; BECN1, beclin-1; CaMKKβ, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
