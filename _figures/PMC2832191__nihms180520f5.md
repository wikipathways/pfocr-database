caption: Two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complexes in yeast. Each complex
  contains three common components, Vps15, Vps34, and Vps30/Atg6. Vps34 is the PtdIns3K
  enzyme, and Vps15 is thought to be a regulatory component; the function of Vps30/Atg6
  is not known. In addition, each complex contains another specific component, Atg14
  (complex I) or Vps38 (complex II), which is thought to act as a connector between
  Vps30 and Vps15–Vps34. Complex I functions in autophagy and the Cvt pathway, whereas
  complex II acts in the Vps pathway, including the CPY and MVB pathways. This figure
  is modified from Fig. 5a of
