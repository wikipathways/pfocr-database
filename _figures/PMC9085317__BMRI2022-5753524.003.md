caption: Schematic representation of the homeostatic mechanism of iNOS expression
  in bronchial epithelial cells under physiological conditions via INFγ receptor and
  the STAT-1 pathway. Once INFγ binds its receptor, STAT-1 is phosphorylated and translocated
  to the nucleus inducing the expression of interferon response factor 1 (IRF1) which
  binds to its response element in the promoter of the NOS2 gene that encodes for
  iNOS. Together with the STAT-1 binding elements, they maintain iNOS expression in
  low concentrations for the physiological production of NO in exhaled air. iNOS promoter
  also has binding sites for NFκB and AP-1 which increase its expression in response
  to microbial or environmental signals detected by pattern receptors.
