caption: 'It is hypothesized that OX40L-DCs first stimulate NKT cells (i) to proliferate
  and produce cytokines (ii). Subsequently, NKT cells activate DCs through cellular
  contacts (such as CD40/CD40L binding) and cytokine expression (iii), which induce
  the DCs to secret IL-12 and to upregulate costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and
  CD86. IL-12 stimulates the IL-12 receptor expressed by activated NKT cells (iv),
  which further potentiates NKT cell activation and forms a positive-feedback loop.
  Three lines of signaling transduction pathways are speculated to be activated in
  NKT cells: (a) TCR (Vα14 in mouse and Vα24 in human) signaling is assumed to be
  the first signaling pathway; (b) other costimulatory signaling networks such as
  CD28 might be involved and interact with both the TCR signaling network and the
  OX40 signaling network; and (c) OX40 signaling components may control the fate of
  NKT cells through molecular interactions with the TCR signaling network. OX40 interacts
  with TNF receptor–associated factors and may lead to the regulation of transcription
  factors such as NF-AT, NF-κB, and T-bet.'
