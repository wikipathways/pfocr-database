caption: WWOX regulates multiple signaling pathways. WWOX inhibits the transactivation
  function of p73, ΔNp63α, AP2γ, ErbB4, RUNX2, and c-Jun by sequestering them in the
  cytoplasm, thus preventing their binding to the promoter region of target genes.
  Stress-induced activation of WWOX involves Tyr33 phosphorylation and translocation
  to the mitochondria and nuclei. Tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates WWOX. Phosphorylation
  of WWOX at Tyr33 is essential for its binding and stabilizing Ser46-phosphorylated
  p53. The active WWOX–p53 complexes then translocate into the nucleus where they
  promote apoptosis. JNK1 and Zfra counteract the apoptotic function of WWOX. Tau
  and GSK-3β interact with WWOX via the C-terminal SDR domain. WWOX also regulates
  Hedgehog signaling, Wnt/β-catenin axis, and glucose metabolism via interacting with
  GLI1, DVL1/DVL2 and HIF-1α, respectively. Ack1 induces Tyr287 phosphorylation of
  WWOX for the degradation of WWOX via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway
