caption: 'Ferroptosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Various molecules
  are involved in ferroptosis in NAFLD. The liver is the main organ for iron storage
  and lipid metabolism. The accumulation of iron and lipid peroxides in liver cells
  can induce cell ferroptosis, which in turn exacerbates NAFLD. Some active substances
  have been shown to inhibit hepatocyte ferroptosis and improve NAFLD by removing
  excess iron, neutralizing lipid peroxides, and activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
  Abbreviations: ACSL4, acylCoA synthetase long-chain family member 4; CoQ10, coenzyme
  Q10; GSH, glutathione; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  LPCAT3, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. Black arrows indicate the activation
  modification, and black block lines indicate the inhibitory modification. Blue arrows
  indicate the activation process of activators, and blue block lines indicate the
  inhibition process of inhibitors. Black dashed arrows indicate the indirect process.
  Double arrows indicate the reverse transport process of glutamate and cystein.'
