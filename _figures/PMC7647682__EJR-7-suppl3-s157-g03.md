caption: Schematic representation of the putative molecular mechanisms and signaling
  pathways that may regulate the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) process
  in systemic sclerosis. One central pathway is initiated following TGF-β-binding
  and subsequent activation of both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGF-β pathways.
  Activation of the Smad-independent pathway results in GSK 3β phosphorylation/inhibition
  by the PKC-δ and c-Abl non-receptor kinases, and consequent stabilization and nuclear
  translocation of the transcriptional regulator Snail1. Upon accumulation in the
  nucleus, Snail 1 triggers the acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype through
  the upregulation of mesenchymal markers and downregulation of endothelial markers.
  The Wnt/Frizzled pathway may also lead to GSK 3β phosphorylation, followed by β-catenin
  stabilization and nuclear translocation. ET-1 may participate in the EndoMT process
  through a synergistic stimulation of the Smad-dependent TGF-β pathway. Activation
  of the Delta/Notch pathway with cleaved intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) translocation
  to the nucleus may also contribute to EndoMT induction. The cleavage of uPAR by
  MMP-12 results in an integrin-dependent increase in adhesion of cells to the extracellular
  matrix and generation of the cell tension, which is required for the assembly of
  α-SMA into stress fibers and the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype.
