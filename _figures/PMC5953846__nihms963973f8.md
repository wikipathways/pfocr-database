caption: The active efflux of the chemotherapeutic drugs through ABC transporters
  plays a major role in cancer cells in resisting chemotherapy. The figure summarizes
  the mechanism by which ATP-binding cassette transporter genes, ABCB1 (P-gp or MDR1),
  ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 were overexpressed in docetaxel (DTX) drug resistance PCa
  cells. The encapsulation of resveratrol in nanoparticles can accumulate within the
  cells without being recognized by ABC transporters and release the drugs by lysosomal
  degradation modulating apoptotic pathway with the up-regulation of pro-(BAX, BAK)
  and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL) molecules in the tumor cells.
  Inhibiting the expression of survivin (an attractive target in cancer therapy) activates
  effector Caspases (Caspase-3) that results in re-sensitizing the cells to apoptosis.
  Moreover, the binding of NPs to the transcriptional factor such as NF-kB inhibits
  the expression of various genes contributing cell survival, progression, and proliferation
  of the tumor cells. This, in turn, affects the expression of proliferation and inflammatory
  marker (COX-2) associated with NF-kB pathway and induces apoptosis by inhibiting
  drug resistance PCa cells.
