caption: Chemical structures of the intermediates of the later steps of Leu biosynthesis
  and Met chain elongation showing the parallel nature of the two pathways. The reaction
  types are the same, and the genes and enzymes are very similar. Up to six rounds
  of chain elongation are known to occur in Arabidopsis. Depicted are the first and
  second cycles. The elongated keto acid produced by each cycle (for example, 5-methylthio-2-oxopentanoate,
  5MTOP, by the first round) can participate in a subsequent round of elongation,
  or can be transaminated to form an elongated Met derivative and then proceed to
  the later steps of glucosinolate biosynthesis

  isomerase involved in both Leu biosynthesis and the Met chain elongation pathway
  of glucosinolate formation.
