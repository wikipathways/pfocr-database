caption: Schematic diagram of SiNPs inducing pulmonary genotoxicity and malignant
  transformation via autophagy dysfunction. SiNPs were deposited in lungs via the
  respiratory tract and internalized into autophagosomes, where they impaired autophagic
  flux and caused SQSTM1 accumulation. On one hand, the elevated SQSTM1 levels promoted
  nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and activated the MDM2-p53-Aurora B signaling pathway,
  resulting in mitotic abnormalities. On the other hand, nuclear translocation of
  SQSTM1 facilitated its binding with RNF168, thereby inhibiting RNF168-mediated histone
  ubiquitination and suppressing DNA damage repair. The combination of mitotic catastrophe
  and failed DNA damage repair ultimately led to SiNPs-induced malignant transformation
  in lungs
