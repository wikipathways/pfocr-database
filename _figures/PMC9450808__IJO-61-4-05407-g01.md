caption: Processes of BA synthesis. In the liver, the classical pathway is initiated
  by CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme. CYP7A1 and HSD3B7 are able to convert cholesterol
  to form C4. CYP8B1 performs 12α-hydroxylation of C4. Subsequently, under the catalysis
  of AKR1D1, AKR1C4 and CYP27A1, THCA is generated. However, without 12α-hydroxylation,
  C4 is converted to DHCA. BACS or VLCS in the ER then ligate Co-A to the carboxyl
  groups. After transport by peroxisomal transporter ABCD3 and catalysis by a series
  of enzymes, THCA and DHCA synthesize cholyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholyl-CoA. These
  two substances are then conjugated to taurine or glycine by BAAT. The alternative
  pathway is mainly initiated by CYP27A1. Next, through CYP7B1 and other enzymes that
  belong to CYP proteins, cholesterol is being subjected to modifications to finally
  generate CDCA and a small amount of CA. Certain conjugated forms of BAs entering
  the intestine may be dissociated by BSH and bacterial 7α dehydroxylase may then
  convert CA and CDCA into DCA and LCA, respectively. CDCA may also be isomerized
  to UDCA. In mice, the generation of MCA was observed in addition to the above synthetic
  processes [Refs. (-,)]. BA, bile acid; BSH, BA hydrolase; HSD3B7, 3β-hydroxy-5-C27-steroid
