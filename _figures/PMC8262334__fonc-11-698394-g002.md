caption: Schematic representation of glycolytic pathway. In CSCs, glucose from the
  extracellular environment is mainly metabolized through glycolysis. In particular,
  upregulation of several intermediates of this catabolic pathway, such as Hexokinase
  2 and ENO1, leads to an increase in lactate production. Moreover, the inactivation
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by PDK1 is responsible for failure in the conversion
  of pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA and this results in increased lactate production. ENO1,
  Enolase1; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor; LDH, Lactate Dehydrogenase; PKM2, Pyruvate
  kinase isozyme M2; PDH, Pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK1, Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  1; DCA, dicloroacetate.
