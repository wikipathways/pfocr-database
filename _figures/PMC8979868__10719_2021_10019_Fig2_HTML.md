caption: 'Scheme of a-series and b-series gangliosides biosynthetic pathway. A- and
  b-series are classified according to the number of sialic acid residues attached
  to lactosylceramide (Lac-Cer), respectively 1 and 2 residues. The precursor of a
  series of gangliosides is GM3, directly synthesized from Lac-Cer by the action of
  the enzyme GM3 synthase (St3gal5). GM3 is converted to GD3 via GD3 synthase (St8sia1)
  serving as a precursor for the b series. The elongation of the precursors is performed
  by the sequential action of the following enzymes: GM2/GD2 synthase (B4galnt1),
  GM1a/GD1b synthase (B3galt4), GD1a/GT1b synthase (St3gal2/3), GT1a/GQ1b synthase
  (St8sia5). Cer, ceramide'
