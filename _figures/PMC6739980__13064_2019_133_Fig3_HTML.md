caption: Summary of ventral midline crossing. a In the vertebrate spinal cord, dorsal
  commissural neurons extend their axons ventrally. They are guided first by the roof
  plate (RP)-chemorepellent, mediated by the Bmps acting through BmprIb, that directs
  them away from the dorsal midline. Commissural axons are then directed towards the
  floor plate at the ventral midline, considered a classic example of an axon guidance
  guidepost, by action of two attractants, netrin1 and Shh, in a Dcc- and Smo/Boc-dependent
  mechanism, respectively. b Midline crossing is mediated by the slit/Robo pathway.
  The floor plate (FP) expresses the slit repellent, which is detected by the robo
  receptor family. Pre-crossing commissural axons are unresponsive to slit, as a consequence
  of the expression of Robo3, which interferes with Robo1 function. However, after
  crossing the midline, Robo3 expression is downregulated, such that Robo1+ commissural
  axons become sensitive to the presence of slit, guiding the axons away from the
  midline and preventing the axons from re-crossing the midline. c Guidance decisions
  are largely conserved in the Drosophila nerve cord. Attraction of commissural axons
  to Netrin1 is mediated by the Dcc homologue Frazzled (Fra). Similarly, Slit proteins
  regulate behavior of pre and post-midline crossing Robo+ axons through repulsive
  signaling. However, in Drosophila, Robo levels are regulated by Comm, which endocytoses
  Robo in axons, making them unable to detect slit repulsion, and thereby permits
  axons to cross the midline
