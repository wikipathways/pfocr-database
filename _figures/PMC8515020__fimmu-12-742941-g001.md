caption: COVID-19 Inflammatory Signaling Pathway. COVID-19 is characterized by delayed
  intracellular innate immune responses associated with type I and type III IFNs.
  This allows for rapid virus replication and subsequent PRR-induced abnormal inflammatory
  response. SARS-CoV-2 invade and activate of various immune cells such as endothelial
  cells, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T-cells.
  These abnormally activated immune cells stimulate multiple inflammatory pathways
  producing large amounts of cytokines and chemokines, which results in hyperinflammation
  and cytokine storm. The formation of cytokine storm reduces further spread of virus
  in the body but also causes tissues damage, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome
  (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Upon entering cells, SARS-COV-2 is recognized by
  pattern-recognition receptor (toll-like receptor 3), resulting in activation of
  NLRP3. Simultaneously, the viral invasion causes protein aggregation, calcium influx
  and ROS formation. These events lead to the initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated
  NLRP3 inflammasome stimulates activation of caspase-1, which cleaves Gasdermin D
  (GSDMD), resulting in pyroptosis of cells. Activated caspase-1 also promotes the
  secretion of IL-1β, IL-18, which play an important role in pyroptosis procession.
  HMGB1, a prototypical DAMP activates inflammasome and play an essential role in
  the inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. The adaptive immunity kicks off
  soon after the trigger of innate immune response to control virus infection through
  antibody-producing B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are important
  for virus clearance, while CD8+ T cells provide protection against the virus through
  multiple cytokines. However, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found to be significantly
  reduced in patients with severe COVID-19.
