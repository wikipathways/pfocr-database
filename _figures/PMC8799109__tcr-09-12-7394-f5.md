caption: Schematic overview of the potential pathway involved in the functional role
  of WSB2 in Xuanwei lung cancer. Upregulation of WSB2 promoted cell proliferation,
  EMT, invasion and cell cycle progression, and inhibited apoptosis of lung cancer
  in Xuanwei through activation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling by elevating expression
  of c-Myc and β-catenin. (red ↓) inhibit, (blue ↓) promote. WSB2, WD repeat and SOCS
  box containing protein 2; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
