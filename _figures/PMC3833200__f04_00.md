caption: Core ABA signaling pathway interactions across a broad range of ABA concentrations.Monomeric
  receptors (PYL4–10) weakly interact with PP2Cs in the absence of ABA and interact
  strongly at low ABA concentrations when ABA binding alters their conformation. Dimeric
  receptors (PYR1/PYL1–3) have a lower affinity for ABA, so higher concentrations
  are needed for them to dissociate and then strongly interact with the PP2Cs. All
  receptor interactions with PP2Cs result in inactivation of the PP2Cs and derepression
  of the SnRK2s, which then phosphorylate numerous proteins involved in ABA response.
  Green arrows indicate activation and red bars indicate repression.
