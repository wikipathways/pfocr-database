caption: Schematic representation of differences in the NO metabolic pathway of old
  and young rats at baseline levels. Levels of nitrate and nitrite in young rats are
  plotted as “standards,” they are used only as a reference for the relative changes
  observed/proposed in old rats, with no other associated meaning
