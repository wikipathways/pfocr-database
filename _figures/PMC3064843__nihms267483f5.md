caption: Defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) lead to at least three human
  syndromes characterized by neurodegeneration and DNA repair; xeroderma pigmentosum,
  Cockayne syndrome and Trichothiodystrophy (also see ). NER can involve transcription-coupled
  repair (TCR), which occurs when the transcription complex encounters a damaged template
  and the more general repair pathway, global genomic repair (GGR), which repairs
  lesions present in non-transcribed DNA. The difference between these pathways is
  at the step of damage detection. The sequence of events in NER involves DNA damage
  recognition followed by an incision, damage removal and repair synthesis. DNA damage
  recognition in TCR involves initiation by CSB after the RNA Polymerase II complex
  encounters damage. In GGR damage is recognized by XPE or XPC. Pre-incision events
  involve XPA/RPA. The TFIIH complex, including the XPB and XPD helicases, unwinds
  the DNA helix resulting in an open conformation. XPG is then recruited to the complex
  and binds to TFIIH and RPA. The Cockayne syndrome proteins, CSA and CSB, are also
  involved in TCR and may function in shifting TFIIH from a transcription to repair
  complex. Dual incision involves XPG performing the initial cleavage 3′ to the site
  of DNA damage, followed by 5′ cleavage through the action or the XPF nuclease. Repair
  synthesis is performed by DNA Polymerase δ or ε with PCNA, and ligation to seal
  the gap involves DNA ligase I. Three main classes of diseases resulting from disruption
  of NER are listed, and pathway components that are disrupted in the respective diseases
  are represented in corresponding colors.
