caption: Nuclear gene-encoded regulatory factors are essential for mitochondrial biogenesis
  and function. The nuclear factors that regulate the expression of nDNA-encoded genes
  that regulate Mt metabolism and organelle biogenesis are SIRT1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). PGC-1α serves as a central component of the
  transcriptional regulatory circuitry that coordinately controls the energy-generating
  functions of Mt in accordance with the metabolic demands imposed by changing physiological
  conditions and disease. SIRT1 is a deacetylase enzyme that deacetylates PGC-1α and
  increases its activity. Our results show that genetic ablation of PGC-1α exacerbates
  DPN and is associated with Mt degeneration and increased oxidative stress. In contrast,
  nDNA-encoded factors such as TFAM act exclusively within the Mt to regulate the
  control of Mt transcription and replication of mtDNA. TFAM over-expression prevented
  a decrease in mtDNA copy number in diabetic DRG neurons, helped prevent experimental
  diabetic neuropathy, and protected DRG neurons from oxidative stress.
