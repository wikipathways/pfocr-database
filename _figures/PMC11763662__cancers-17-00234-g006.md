caption: Representative molecular targets in breast cancer, along with the corresponding
  immunotherapeutic and targeted treatment approach. The GPCR-mediated AKT/PI3K/mTOR
  signaling pathway is a major target for inhibitors such as alpelisib, buparlisib,
  capivasertib, ipatasertib, everolimus, and sapanisertib, used to suppress breast
  tumor growth. Inhibitors including trametinib and ONC201 target the EGFR-activated
  MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Targeting HER2 and VEGF with their respective monoclonal
  antibodies, trastuzumab and bevacizumab, leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation
  and angiogenesis. Tarextumab, a potent inhibitor of the Notch receptor, along with
  MK0752 and DAPT, that target γ-secretase, inactivate the Notch signaling pathway.
  Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are the CDK4/6 inhibitors that induce cell
  cycle arrest by suppression of CDK4/6-mediated signaling. Targeting ER with hormone
  therapy like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors can be a key strategy for treating
  hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab,
  nivolumab, cemiplimab, avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, tremelimumab, and ipilimumab
  block PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, respectively, act as effective immunotherapeutic
  drugs
