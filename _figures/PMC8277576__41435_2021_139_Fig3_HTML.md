caption: A GCs penetrate the plasma membrane and bound to the glucocorticoid receptor
  (GR) in the cytoplasm. The GC/GR complex is then transported to the nucleus and
  exert its effect by binding positive glucocorticoid response element (pGRE) or negative
  glucocorticoid response element (nGRE) and upregulate or downregulate the corresponding
  genes, respectively. Upregulated expression of IκBα impedes the effect of NF-κB.
  The signaling pathway through membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor (mGR) is still
  unexplored. B GCs play contrasting roles on monocytes/macrophages in a context-dependent
  manner, depending upon their level and time of exposure. High level of GC is anti-inflammatory
  and immunosuppressive, while a low level of GC facilitates macrophage polarization
  into pro-inflammatory phenotypes. All these phenomena are also influenced by cytokines
  present in the milieu. (Figure created with BioRender.com).
