caption: Arabidopsis phytochrome chromophore. (A) The biosynthesis pathway of Arabidopsis
  phytochrome chromophore (adapted from ).(B) Chemical structures of heme, BV, PΦB,
  PCB, and PEB. Heme oxygenase converts heme to BV by an oxidative cleavage between
  rings A and D at the position marked (arrow).(C) Red light (R) triggers a “Z” to
  “E” isomerization in the C-15 double bond between the C and D rings of the linear
  tetrapyrrole, which is accompanied by rearrangement of the apoprotein backbone.
  This results in the photoconversion of phytochromes from the Pr form to the Pfr
  form. Far-red (FR) light converts the Pfr form back to the Pr form.
