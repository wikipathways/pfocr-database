caption: Expression of suicide genes in T lymphocytes. (A) HSV-TK phosphorylates ganciclovir
  (GCV) to nucleoside monophosphate, then a second cellular kinase phosphorylates
  this into nucleoside triphosphate. This inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in death
  of dividing cells. (B) In the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, translocation of
  activated BAX or BID to the mitochondria creates pores and allows cytochrome C to
  move to the cytosol. Cytochrome C then activates caspase-9, resulting in the activation
  of caspase-3, which leads to apoptosis. iC9 was made by the fusion of human caspase-9
  to a modified FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), allowing dimerization. By adding CID,
  iC9 is dimerized and activates caspase-3 directly, also inducing apoptosis.
