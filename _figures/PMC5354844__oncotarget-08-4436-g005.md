caption: Tumor-shed gangliosides, especially GM1, regulates macrophage phenotype by
  activating CD206/γc complexes and the JAK3/STAT6 signaling pathway. Activated TAMs
  increase the expression of arginase-1, a typical marker of M2 phenotype, and production
  of MCP-1. Enhanced secretion of MCP-1 by GM1-stimulated macrophages induces in vitro
  and in vivo angiogenesis through ligation with MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, expressed in
  vascular endothelial cells.
