caption: Reversible shifting of Smad3-dependent signaling between hepatocytic growth
  and inhibition indicates that pSmad3C transmits a cytostatic TGF-β/activin signal,
  whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines transmit a mitogenic signal through the JNK-dependent
  pSmad3L pathway. a TGF-β or activin treatment activates TβRI or ActRI, further leading
  to the direct phosphorylation of Smad3C. pSmad3C inhibits hepatocyte growth by up-regulating
  p21WAF1 transcription. b Although TGF-β and the activin signal weakly phosphorylate
  Smad3L in normal hepatocytes (dotted arrow), pro-inflammatory cytokines can transmit
  a mitogenic signal through the JNK-dependent pSmad3L pathway to participate in hepatocytic
  growth, possibly by stimulating the transcription of the c-Myc gene. Linker phosphorylation
  of Smad3 indirectly prevents its COOH-tail phosphorylation (yellow star), pSmad3C-mediated
  p21WAF1 transcription, and consequently the cytostatic effect of TGF-β/activin upon
  normal hepatocytes. c Either various JNK inhibitors or a Smad3 mutant lacking the
  JNK phosphorylation sites in the linker region can eliminate mitogenic pSmad3L signaling
  and restore the lost cytostatic pSmad3C signaling observed in mature hepatocytes
