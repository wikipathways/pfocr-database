caption: The serine at position 16 of hRheb is sensitive to tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC) GTPase activation. hRheb(S16H), which has a mutation of the serine to histidine,
  is resistant to this activation and consequently cause its persistent GTP-bound,
  activated state []. The accumulation of hRheb(S16H) stimulates the expression of
  CNTF and its receptor in dopaminergic neurons, which can consequentially protect
  the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection from neurotoxicity, even though it is
  obscure whether CNTF produced by hRheb(S16H) is involved in other potential mechanisms
  for protection of dopaminergic neurons (dotted arrow).
