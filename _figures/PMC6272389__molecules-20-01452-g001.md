caption: '(a) Metabolic pathway of glutathione (GSH) involving γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase (GCS), glutathione synthetase (GS) as well as the enzymatic cycling of
  GSH reductase (gor) and glutaredoxin (Grx) to facilitate the conversion of GSH to
  GSSG. Reduction of P-SSG by Grx leads to a Grx-SSG intermediate that is further
  reduced by GSH to produce GSSG, which is reduced by gor (γEC: γ-glutamylcysteine).
