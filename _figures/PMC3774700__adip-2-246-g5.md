caption: Figure 5. A model for the action of PPARγ and C/EBPα in differentiating (small)
  and differentiated (large) adipocytes. Although PPARγ and C/EBPα act as adipogenic
  transcription factors during adipocyte differentiation, they appear to promote net
  lipolysis to decrease the cell size and fat mass in differentiated adipocytes. Change
  in the size of the fat mass is determined by the balance between the amount of lipid
  storage by adipocytes and the rate of lipid removal from the body. In contrast to
  the lipid storage that depends on the uptake of nutrients such as FAs into adipocytes,
  the rate of lipid removal through lipolysis is proportional to the total fat mass
  as well as the activities of lipases. We thus propose that those transcription factors
  promote net TG synthesis when the size of adipocytes is small during differentiation
  because of the low rate of lipolysis, whereas they promote net TG breakdown when
  it is large, particularly in obesity, due to the higher lipolytic rate. PPARγ downregulated
  under obesity in differentiated adipocytes by the ALK7-dependent pathway and by
  other unknown mechanisms (see text and ) is considered a potential target of medical
  intervention for obesity.
