caption: Model for the mechanisms with which the HOG pathway controls gene expression
  via Sko1p. Protein kinase A activity stimulates nuclear localization; some redistribution
  of Sko1/Acr1p to the cytosol is only observed under severe osmotic stress. Sko1/Acr1p
  may also have an activating function in addition to its demonstrated role as a repressor.
