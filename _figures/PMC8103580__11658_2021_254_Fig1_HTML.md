caption: Mechanism of apoptosis. (1) After Fas and FasL are combined in the death
  receptor pathway, they recruit molecules, such as FADD, and activate caspase cascade
  reactions, including activation of caspase 8, caspase 3 and caspase 7. Caspase 8
  activation can be blocked by C-FLIP. Then, caspase 3 and caspase 7 continue to cleave
  cell substrates, such as ICAD, and trigger apoptosis. (2) Caspase 3 and caspase
  7 in the death receptor pathway may activate caspase 6 to cleave Bid into tBid,
  which is transferred to the mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c
  (cytc), AIF, Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, etc. Cytc activates caspase 9, APAF1, etc.
  to cause apoptosis, and the other three inhibit the XIAP survival protein to promote
  apoptosis. (3) AIF translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus may interact
  with EndoG to trigger DNA degradation and apoptosis. P53 induces apoptosis by transactivating
  the expression of various proapoptotic proteins. (4) Lysosomal permeabilization
  induces apoptosis through the release of ctsB and ctsD to activate the mitochondrial
  pathway. (5) Dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum leads to UPR-induced apoptosis
  by activating caspase 12, 9 and 3
