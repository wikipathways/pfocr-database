caption: A schematic model for the potential roles of the NXF3 in gastric cancer.
  On one hand, the high expression of NXF3 regulates the transport of piRNAs, thereby
  affecting cell senescence, the p53 signaling pathway, and the Rap1 signaling pathway;
  on the other hand, NXF3 binds to CDK5RAP3 RNA, promoting its nuclear translocation
  to influence cell cycle progression
