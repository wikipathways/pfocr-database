caption: Schematic representation of central yeast metabolism, including the synthetic
  pathway for formate production. Some of the intermediates and metabolic branching
  points are not illustrated for simplicity. Bold arrows represent heterologous reactions.
  Dashed lines represent native pathways. PFL is from E. coli, FDH1/2 represents the
  native FDH1 and -2 from S. cerevisiae, and AdhE represents acetaldehyde/alcohol
  dehydrogenase E from E. coli. The X represents the deletion of the FDH1 and -2 genes.
