caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways for phosphatidic acid production. Phosphatidic acid
  (PA) can be generated by three major routes: (a-b) The de novo synthesis via lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA) formation that occurs via two different acylation pathways. (a) The first
  and main synthesis route is the glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) pathway. G3P is acylated
  by a glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) to form LPA. (b) The second pathway
  of LPA formation involves acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by DHAP
  acyltransferase (DHAP AT) via the 1-acylDHAP (Ac-DHAP) pathway followed by Ac-DHAP
  reductase-mediated reduction. LPA can then be further acylated by the addition of
  an unsaturated fatty acid (generally arachidonate) to form PA, via a lysophosphatidic
  acid acyltransferase (LPAAT). The inverse reaction is mediated by phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2), which thus converts PA into LPA. Both of these reactions are of particular
  significance for the geometry of the membrane bilayers, since cone-shaped PA is
  converted to inverted-cone-shaped LPA (and vice versa), thus facilitating rapid
  changes in membrane curvature. (c) PA is also formed by the breakdown of other phospholipids,
  and in particular by the activity of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipase
  D (PLD). (d) Finally, PA can be dephosphorylated by PA phosphatases (PAPs), to form
  diacylglycerol (DAG), a strongly conical component of the bilayer, which due to
  its small and uncharged headgroup, has spontaneous transbilayer movement (flip-flop).
  The opposite reaction is catalyzed by diacylglycerol kinases (DAGKs). PA and DAG
  have been shown to be in dynamic equilibrium, and this mechanism can affect the
  composition and curvature of both leaflets of the bilayer.'
