caption: 'Common synthesis pathway: sphingolipid synthesis begins in the endoplasmic
  reticulum in both yeast and mammals. Acyl-CoA is condensed with serine to form 3-ketohydrosphingosine,
  which is further reduced to DHS. C-26 fatty acid is transferred to DHS in order
  to yield dihydroceramide. In yeast, DHS is hydroxylated to PHS, which is attached
  to a C-26 fatty acid in order to synthesize phytoceramide. Dihydroceramide can also
  be hydroxylated to phytoceramide. Phosphorylinositol is transferred to phytoceramide
  in order to produce IPC, which is mannosylated to MIPC. Another phosphorylinositol
  group is added to MIPC in order to yield M(IP)2C. In mammals, DHS is N-acetylated
  to dihydroceramide, which is converted to ceramide. Different polar groups are added
  to the ceramide backbone in order to synthesize complex sphingolipids, including
  phosphorylcholine for producing sphingomyelin and galactose and glucose for synthesizing
  galactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, respectively. Glucosylceramide and galactosylcermaide
  can be modified by the addition of sugars such as fucose, galactose, sialic acid,
  N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine in order to produce several glycosphingolipids.
  Common cleavage pathway: complex sphingolipids are catabolized to ceramide, which
  is cleaved to LCBs. LCBs are phosphorylated in order to form long-chain base phosphates,
  which are dephosphorylated to LCBs or further cleaved to fatty aldehyde and phosphatidylethanolamine.
  In mammals, ceramide is phosphorylated to C1P. In yeast, Rsb1 transports sphingosine
  bases from the cytoplasmic side to the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane.C1P:
  Ceramide-1-phosphate; CoA: Coenzyme A; DHS: Dihydrosphingosine; IPC: Inositol phosphorylceramide;
  LCB: Long-chain base; M(IP)2C: Mannosyl(inositolphosphoryl)2 ceramide; MIPC: Mannoyl-inositol
  phosphorylceramide; PHS: Phytosphingosine.'
