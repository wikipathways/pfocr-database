caption: The Hippo/yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway in mammals. When
  the Hippo signaling pathway is active, MST1/2 protein kinases (mammalian STE20-like
  kinase 1/2) are phosphorylated by NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2), KIBRA, or TAO1-3.
  MST1/2 activates LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2) proteins which are also stimulated
  by Sav1 (salvador) and Rassf (ras association domain family) proteins. LATS1/2 then
  phosphorylates YAP protein which is retained in the cytoplasm or is degraded by
  the proteasome. MOB1 (monopolar spindle-one-binder) and AMOT (angiomantin) proteins
  favor LATS1/2 phosphorylation and activity. When the Hippo signaling pathway is
  inactive, YAP is not phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus where it can
  exert its transcriptional activity by binding to TEAD (transcriptional enhanced
  associate domain). YAP thus regulates the expression of specific targets such as
  CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), BIRC5 (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis
  repeat-containing 5), or Cyr61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61).
