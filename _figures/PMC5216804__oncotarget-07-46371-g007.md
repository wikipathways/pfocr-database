caption: A. In normal growth conditions, glucose fuels the hexosamine pathway thereby
  contributing to the glycosylation of various nutrient transporters including glutamine
  transporters ASCT2 and others listed in Table . The mTOR pathway supporting cell
  growth is activated through the glucose metabolism and the influx of leucine facilitated
  by glutamine efflux via the LAT1 antiport. B. When glycosylation is inhibited in
  response to glucose deprivation or treatment with TUN or 2-DG, functional alteration
  of transporters is observed and leukemia cells compensate through the upregulation
  of various transporters including LAT1 that is a non-glycosylated transporter. Leukemia
  cells are then highly dependent on LAT1 to support the mTOR pathway. C. When the
  leucine uptake inhibitor BCH is combined to glycosylation inhibitors, mTOR is completely
  blocked and leukemia cell growth is dramatically inhibited.
