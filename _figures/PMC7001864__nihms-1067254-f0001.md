caption: (A) In the absence of WNT ligands or when the interaction between frizzled
  (FZD) receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) is
  blocked by dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1), cytosolic catenin
  beta 1 (CTNNB1; best known as β-catenin) is efficiently phosphorylated and ubiquitinated
  by the so-called β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in efficient proteasomal
  degradation. In this scenario, transcription factors from the T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family are maintained in an inactive state upon binding
  to transcriptional repressors from the Groucho family. Canonical WNT signaling is
  counteracted by deacylases such as notum, palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase
  (NOTUM), which limit the secretion of WNT signals. Also, E3 ubiquitin ligases ring
  finger protein 43 (RNF43) and zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) suppress WNT signaling
  by favoring FZD receptor internalization. (B) WNT ligands secreted upon acylation
  by porcupine O-acyltransferase (PORCN) enable the assembly of an FZD-LRP5 complex
  that recruits dishevelled segment polarity protein 1 (DVL1) or DVL2 to the cytosolic
  face of the plasma membrane. This results in inactivation of the β-catenin destruction
  complex, accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, displacement of
  Groucho family members from TCF/LEF transcription factors, and consequent activation
  of specific transcriptional programs. Conversely, binding of members of the R-spondin
  (RSPO) protein family to leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors
  (LGRs) stimulates WNT-driven signal transduction. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
  AXIN1, axin 1; β-TrCP (official name, BTRC), beta-transducin repeat-containing E3
  ubiquitin protein ligase; CSNK1A, casein kinase 1 alpha; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  GA, Golgi apparatus; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; KREMEN1, kringle-containing
  transmembrane protein 1.
