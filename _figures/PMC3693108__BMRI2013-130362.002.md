caption: Challenges in the molecular therapeutics of human tumor. The clinical success
  of targeted drugs has been limited by key challenges, including primary/acquired
  drug resistance and unexpected side effects on normal tissues due to nonspecificity.
  The most frequent mechanisms of primary resistance are genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity
  and the existence of cancer stem cell. Acquired resistance can be caused by the
  secondary mutation in the target gene, activation of alternative pathway or feedback
  loop, and induction of EMT. Treatment of tumor cells with antiangiogenic agents
  can lead to a more hypoxic tumor microenvironment and enhance tumor cell invasion
  and metastasis by inducing the EMT- and cancer-stem-cell-like phenotype.
