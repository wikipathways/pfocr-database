caption: Signaling pathways involved in the recognition of HSV. Viral glycoproteins
  are sensed by TLR2 located at the cell surface, whereas the abundant CpG motifs
  present in the viral dsDNA are recognized by endosomal TLR9. Both TLR2 and TLR9
  signal through the MyD88/TAK1 pathway to activate NF-κB and AP-1. In the cytosol,
  viral dsDNA also induces the synthesis of cGAMP by cGAS, which activates the STING/TRIF/TRAF3
  signaling pathway. Intermediate dsRNA produced during viral replication is recognized
  by endosomal TLR3 or cytosolic RIG-I and Mda5 sensors that signal, respectively,
  through TRIF/TRAF3 or IPS-1/TRAF3 pathways to activate IRF3 and IRF7. Activated
  NF-κB, AP-1, or dimers of IRF3 and IRF7 induce the production of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β)
  and proinflammatory cytokines. IFN-α/β bind to the IFNAR receptor, and the signal
  is transduced to JAK-1 and TYK-2, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, respectively.
  The complex of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerizes with IRF9 and translocates
  to the nucleus to induce the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes.
