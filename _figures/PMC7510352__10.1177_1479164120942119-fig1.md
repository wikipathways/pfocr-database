caption: 'The families of PDGF/PDGFR and the downstream signalling pathways. PDGF-AA
  and PDGF-AB are secreted in active isoforms by cleaving their C-terminal retention
  motifs inside the cell. While PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD are inactive after secretion and
  then become active outside the cell, PDGFs interact with PDGFRs and form a complex
  signalling cascade through several pathways. Specifically, active PDGFR-α initiates
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, targeting at MYC, MMP2, BCL2L1 genes, which leads to increased
  proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Besides, it also activates the JAK/STAT
  signalling pathway, encoding MYC, VEGFA, MMP2, BCL2L1 genes, promoting proliferation
  and angiogenesis. Furthermore, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β trigger the activation of the
  Ras-MAPK pathway by engaging Shc and Grb2, respectively. Shc and Grb2 activate the
  c-myc gene, stimulating proliferation, and differentiation. Activation of both PDGFR-α
  and PDGFR-β triggers the activation of PLC-γ/PKC pathway, accelerating cell growth
  via expressing the c-fos gene. Meanwhile, the interactions of PDGFR-β, Raf/ERK signalling
  pathways contribute to the fibrogenic process, with the increased expression of
  c-Src and Smad1.PDGF: Platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR: Platelet-derived growth
