caption: NEC pathophysiology is a complex series of events leading to a final common
  pathway of inflammation. This figure demonstrates the proposed pathophysiology of
  NEC as it is understood currently, as well as potential protective effects of PUFA,
  probiotics and growth factors. Although much has been elucidated over many years
  of research, there are still multiple facets of NEC that are incompletely understood.
