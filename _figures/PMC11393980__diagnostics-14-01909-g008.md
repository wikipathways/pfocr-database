caption: Other targets of pVHL in ccRCC and SNC hemangioblastomas. (a) ccRCC. (1)
  Loss of pVHL stabilizes HIF-α at enhancers, recruits p300 to maintain H3K27 acetylation,
  and up-regulates ZNF395. ZNF395 promotes tumorigenesis of ccRCC. (2) ZHX2 and SFMBT1
  are novel pVHL substrates. ZHX2 promotes NF-kB activation, and thus cell growth
  in ccRCC. On the other hand, ZHX2 also activates the MAPK/ERK signal pathway, facilitating
  several cell functions in addition to causing drug resistance. SFMBT1 promotes SPHK1
  expression that contributes to the oncogenic phenotype. (3) RSUME sumoylates pVHL
  mutants. This post-translational modification stabilizes HIF-α, and thus enhances
  VEGF action promoting vascularized tumors. (4) Loss of pVHL hyperactivates TBK1
  phosphorylating p62 and promotes renal tumorigenesis. (b) SNC hemangioblastomas.
  (1) The pVHL mutant does not ubiquitinate STAT and JAK2. It activates the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway, thus differentiating hemangioblast progenitor cells into neoplastic
  cells. (a) https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/6153323d222f2b00a627ee06 (accessed
