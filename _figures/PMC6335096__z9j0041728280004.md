caption: Peroxisome biogenesis. Details of peroxisome generation by de novo synthesis,
  and by growth and fission, are shown here. In the de novo pathway, peroxisomes are
  formed via budding from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and pairwise heterotypic
  fusion of two vesicles. Initiation begins by the peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs)
  entering into the ER via Sec61 or GET3 and traffic through the ER to get into the
  vesicles. One of the vesicles contains a set of RING finger proteins (PEX2, PEX10,
  and PEX12), while the other vesicle contains a set of docking group proteins. Following
  heterotypic fusion, both vesicles merge and form an import complex group. PEX1 and
  PEX6 are found on separate preperoxisomal vesicles and are necessary for heterotypic
  fusion. Once peroxisomes are formed, they grow by import of matrix and membrane-targeted
  proteins via the import receptor PEX5/PEX7 and PEX19, respectively, to form mature
  peroxisomes. In turn, mature peroxisomes grow by fission which begins with membrane
  remodeling and elongation by PEX11. The elongated extension grows and dynamin-related
  proteins (DRPs), which are also involved in fission of mitochondria, including the
  Fis1 (or DLP1; dynamin-like proteins in mammalian cells) are recruited from the
  cytosol to help with the fission and formation of new peroxisomes.
