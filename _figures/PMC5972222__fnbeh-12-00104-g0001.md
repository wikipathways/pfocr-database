caption: The inflammatory reflex. (1) The inflamed zone represents tissue damage,
  infection and ischemia. (2) Increased expression of inflammatory mediators and cytokines,
  such as Il-1β and TNF-α are released by cells in the inflamed zone. (3) Cytokines
  activate primary afferent neurons within the vagal sensory ganglia. (4) Afferent
  visceral signals are relayed to nuclei in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), such as
  the nucleus tractus solitarius. (5) Visceral information is further relayed from
  the DVC to higher order brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus and
  forebrain. (6) Activation of efferent vagal motor activity inhibits cytokine synthesis.
  (7) Hypothalamus activation stimulates the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone
  from the pituitary gland, initiating a humoral anti-inflammatory pathway. (8) Sympathetic
  outflow can increase localized adrenaline and noradrenaline expression further suppressing
  inflammation. IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor—alpha; DVC,
  dorsal vagal complex; NTS, nucleus tractus solitarius; HYP, hypothalamus; HIP, hippocampus;
  FB, forebrain; ACTH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone.
