caption: Genome-based analysis of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, Entner-Doudoroff
  (ED) pathway, mixed acid fermentation and sugar interconversions (partly). The reactions
  are schematized (co-factors, co-substrates, CO2-formation are not shown). Dotted
  arrows indicate a summary of multiple reactions, which were found to be present
  in all strains. Gene products are visualized via EC numbers for the catalyzing enzymes.
  Green blocks indicate strain-specific reactions. Red blocks display all strains
  missing the respective enzyme. Sugars present in honey and degraded pectin backbones
  () are visualized in blue. Pyruvate and putative end products are shown in bold.
  All strains lack a pyruvate-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), which is part of ethanol
  fermentation. Additionally, all strains lack a phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (red
  arrow, EC 4.1.2.12), which is part of the Entner-Doudoroff-pathway.
