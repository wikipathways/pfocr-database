caption: The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and its inhibition by simvastatin. Acetyl-CoA
  is converted into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) by HMG-CoA synthetase.
  HMG-CoA is then converted into mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate is converted
  into geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGpp) and cholesterol are both synthesized from Fpp. Simvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA
  reductase, thus limiting synthesis of these downstream molecules.
