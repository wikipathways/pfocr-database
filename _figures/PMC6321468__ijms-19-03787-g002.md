caption: 'Schematic representation of the non-polyphenolic compounds’ major mechanisms
  of action on CRC cells. Non-polyphenolic compounds: (i) Determine cell cycle arrest
  by downregulating cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK 1), (ii) induce apoptosis by upregulating
  B cell lymphoma 2 associated protein X (Bax), B cell lymphoma 2 (Blc-2) and by increasing
  the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (iii) exert anti-inflammatory effects
  by downregulating interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6)
  and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), (iv) inhibit angiogenesis and invasion by downregulating
  matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PKI3)/Protein
  kinase B (Akt) and (v) stop tumor initiation by altering the PKI3/Akt pathway.'
