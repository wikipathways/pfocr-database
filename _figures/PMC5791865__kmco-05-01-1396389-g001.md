caption: 'Impact of MK2- and IKK-dependent phosphorylation on RIPK1 function. In the
  physiological cell survival state RIPK1 is subjected to ubiquitination by IAP family
  proteins. Depletion of IAPs by genotoxic stress or smac mimetics leads to RIPK1
  deubiquitination and assembly of an immature ripoptosome containing cellular FLICE
  (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP, also known
  as CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator CFLAR), FADD and CASP8. In this complex
  RIPK1 is phosphorylated at the intermediate domain by MK2 and IKK which prevents
  RIPK1 activation, autophosphorylation and ripoptosome maturation. Cell survival
  is consequently still perpetuated. However, if RIPK1 feedback phosphorylation by
  MK2 and IKK is blocked, or if c-FLIPs are depleted, the ripoptosome then matures
  to a fully active complex characterized by CASP8 dimer formation and caspase activation.
  The active ripoptosome resembles complex II in the TNFR pathway and may execute
  cell death by caspase-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. DD: death domain; DED:
  death effector domain; RHIM: RIPK homotypic interaction motif.'
