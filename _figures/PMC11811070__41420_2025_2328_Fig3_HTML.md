caption: Mitophagy is primarily controlled through two main pathways. The first involves
  the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway, where damaged mitochondria retain PINK1 on their
  surface, leading to the recruitment and activation of Parkin. Parkin ubiquitinates
  specific mitochondrial proteins, creating signals that attract autophagy receptors
  such as NDP52 and OPTN, which bind to autophagy machinery to drive mitophagy. The
  second pathway includes mitochondrial receptors like BNIP3 and NIX, which, when
  phosphorylated, bind directly to LC3/GABARAP proteins on the autophagosome membrane,
  facilitating mitochondrial degradation. Other receptors, including FUNDC1, BCL2L13,
  FKBP8, and PHB2, further regulate mitophagy by modulating these processes and enhancing
  mitochondrial clearance
