caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying neuro-immune interactions. (A) Circulating
  or local pathogens, antigens, inflammatory factors, and tissue injury trigger the
  release of inflammatory mediators, such as proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, and IL-17), to activate sensory neurons in the affected area by interacting
  with specific receptors, including cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), and tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA). Additionally, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) can stimulate sensory neurons via pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), such as neuronal TLR4. Certain pathogens, such as Staphylococcus
  aureus, directly provoke nociceptors by secreting N-formyl peptides and α-hemolysin,
  which bind to formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) or activate ion channels. Subsequent
  activation of secondary messengers, such as Ca²⁺ and cAMP, leads to the activation
  of intracellular kinases, including adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PKA), protein
  kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This signaling cascade
  likely generates action potentials and lowers the activation threshold of nociceptive
  receptors. These include transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPV1, TRPA1,
  and TRPM8) and voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9), amplifying
  the response to noxious stimuli. Furthermore, activated neurons release neuropeptides,
  such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), galanin, somatostatin, substance
  P (SP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These neuropeptides influence immune
  responses through an axon reflex mechanism. (B) Ach and NE modulate cytokine release
  by immune cells in response to inflammation and noxious stimuli. Ach binds to α7
  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on Mφs and other immune cells, activating
  intracellular signaling pathways, including adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) and JAK2/STAT3,
  to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, extracellular
  ATP promotes Ach influx, enabling mitochondrial α7nAChR activation, which reduces
  mitochondrial (mt) DNA release. This, in turn, inhibits inflammasome activation
  and subsequent inflammatory responses. Similarly, NE and EPI bind to β2AdrRs on
  Mφs and other immune cells, triggering intracellular signaling cascades involving
  cAMP and PKA, which suppress nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and the secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines
