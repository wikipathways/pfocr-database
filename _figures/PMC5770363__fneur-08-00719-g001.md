caption: Pathways involved in glucose, ketone body, and lipid metabolism. Glucose
  can be catabolized via glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway to produce intermediate
  metabolites that promote cell growth and function. Oxidation of glucose generates
  pyruvate, which is shuttled into mitochondria where it is converted to acetyl-CoA.
  Utilization of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle generates several intermediates that
  can be used for nucleotide, lipid, and amino acid synthesis. Electrons from the
  reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 are used for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  to generate ATP. Healthy neurons are highly glycolytic catabolizing glucose via
  glycolysis and the TCA cycle in order to produce ATP through OXPHOS. Metabolic instability
  and decreased glucose utilization in AD patients can be detected by metabolomics
  approaches and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Impaired glycolytic
  processes in the brain can cause a shift toward the use of alternative fuel sources
  including ketone bodies and fatty acids. Processing of ketone bodies and fatty acids
  can produce acetyl-CoA for use in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS. αKG, alpha-ketoglutaric
