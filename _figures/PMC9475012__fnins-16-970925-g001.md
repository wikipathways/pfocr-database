caption: Dynamics between IR, GLP-1R and PICR-signaling in neurons. 1 The release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of PICRs on neurons induce the
  kinases IKKβ, PKR, and JNK to trigger the inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation of IRS-1
  and neuronal insulin resistance in AD and PD. Aβ was further shown to drive IR clustering
  and endocytosis. In addition, Aβ provokes intracellular Ca2+ accumulation by external
  (VDCCs/NMDARs) and internal means (ER). The latter reinforces the desensitization
  of the insulin pathway, blocks protein translation (eIF2α/mTORC1 pathway) and activates
  the Ca2+-sensitive calpain to impair autophagy, interfere with the synaptic function
  and promote the hyperphosphorylation of Tau by cleaving p35 into the Cdk5-activating
  binding partner p25. Further consequences of inflammation and insulin resistance
  include reduced IDE1 expression, enhanced APP and BACE1 expression, Aβ overproduction
  and amassment, the loss of neuroprotective PI3K/Akt and CREB signaling, GSK-3β hyperactivity
  and concomitant Tau hyperphosphorylation. Crucially, the impairment of the Akt/mTor
  pathway following insulin resistance impedes the expression of glycolytic enzymes,
  thus enforcing bioenergetic impairments and glucose hypometabolism. 2 In contrast
  to the IR, the GLP-1R does not desensitize in neurons. When activated, the GLP-1R
  stimulates PI3K/Akt/mTORC1, cAMP/PKA, MEK/ERK, and CREB/BDNF-signaling to ameliorate
  the Aβ (section “GLP-1R agonists are neuroprotective and prevent amyloid beta accumulation
  in vivo”) and Tau (section “GLP-1R mimetics suppress Tau hyperphosphorylation and
  aggregation during AD”) pathologies through various mechanisms, suppress excessive
  Ca2+ influx and ER stress (not shown; details in sections “GLP-1 mimetics suppress
  Ca2+ deregulation by amyloid beta and excitotoxicity” and “GLP-1 analogues counteract
  endoplasmic reticulum stress”), restore insulin signaling (section “Insulin resistance
  and the neuronal energy metabolism”) by aiding the clearance of Aβ, normalize the
  autophagy function by raising the expression of autophagy modulators via mTORC1
  (Atg3, Atg7, Beclin-1) (section “Autophagy and mitophagy”), elevate neurogenesis
  (section “GLP-1R agonists promote neurogenesis”) and promote the synaptic function,
  plasticity and memory (section “Pro-cognitive effects”). Importantly, the activation
  of GLP-1R on microglia and astrocytes induces the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype
  and suppresses inflammatory cytokine production (not shown; see section Inflammation),
  thus preventing insulin resistance.
