caption: Working model of the mechanical response pathway by which pressure and shear
  stimulate tumor cell adhesion. FAK is activated in response to mechanical stimuli
  through a dual signaling pathway requiring an intact cytoskeleton, α-actinin, and
  paxillin as well as cytoskeleton-independent activation of Src. FAK and Src colocalize
  to β1-integrin heterodimers in an Akt- and α-actinin-dependent manner, respectively.
  FAK–Src complex formation and signaling stimulates PI3K-dependent activation of
  ILK, resulting in β1-integrin phosphorylation and conformational activation, increasing
  substrate binding affinity. Image courtesy of, and with permission from, Ref. David
