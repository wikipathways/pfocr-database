caption: Cancer-derived exosomes participate in the generation of a tumor microenvironment
  (TME) through paracrine signaling and in an endocrine pathway that can influence
  other parts of the body, referred to as a tumor macroevironment (TMaE). Here, we
  use a human melanoma model to demonstrate the mechanisms in which human melanoma-derived
  exosomes (HMEX) use in developing a pre-metastatic niche. In the immediate TME,
  HMEX are released from the primary tumor to convey immunosuppression. (A) HMEX contributes
  to the transition of normal fibroblasts to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
  (B) They also suppress monocyte maturation and induce a monocytic myeloidsuppressor
  cell phenotype. (C) Moreover, they display ligands (ex. programmed death-ligand
  1 (PD-L1)), that inactivate T-cells through direct binding. (D) We also hypothesize
  that HMEX promote a pre-metastatic niche at a distant site (ex. liver) through bloodstream
  and lymphatic drainage to promote vascular permeability, immunosuppression and metastasis.
  (E-G) There, HMEX act on normal stroma by translocation of growth factor receptors
  (ex. EGFR) and metabolic reprogramming using microRNA (miRNA) payloads (ex. miR-155,
  miR-210), exhibiting a reverse Warburg effect and promoting extracellular acidification
  that contribute to the anergy of CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, HMEX not only create
  a favorable immediate environment but a macroenvironment to facilitate the metastatic
  process.
