caption: Defects in mTOR signaling underlie the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative
  disorders. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), inhibition of hyperactive mTOR signaling
  reduces Aβ deposition, pathogenic tau phosphorylation, and neurofibrillary tangles,
  leading to improvements in neuronal loss and cognitive function potentially due
  to promoting autophagy. Defects in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism leading
  to increased BCAA levels enhance tau phosphorylation in an mTOR-dependent manner
  in AD. Deletion of brain-specific mTORC2, but not mTORC1, prolonged life span, prevented
  seizures, rescued AD-like behaviors and long-term memory, and normalized metabolic
  changes in the brain. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), insulin/mTOR signaling pathway
  is deregulated. Accumulation of α-synuclein is accompanied by increased mTOR activity
  and autophagy dysfunction. Rapamycin and depletion of mTOR mitigates the increased
  mTOR activity caused by elevated α-synuclein and induces autophagy and clearance
  of A53T α-synuclein. In models of PD with low mTORC1 activity due to elevated REDD1
  levels, depletion of TSC2 enhances mTORC1 activity and is neuroprotective. In Huntington’s
  disease, enhancing mTORC1 activity by increasing expression of Rheb or Rhes mitigates
  mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal cholesterol metabolism and increases autophagy.
