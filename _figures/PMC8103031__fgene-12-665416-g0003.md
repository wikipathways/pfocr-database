caption: 'Part of complex biological processes luminal B and basal-like. The edges
  with checkmarks are the interactions that have been documented. (A) Luminal B''s
  biological processes: luminal subtypes are driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. Among
  all nodes, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ESR1 are involved in the estrogen/ER pathway. (B) Basal-like''s
  biological processes: basal-like subtype is driven by the deregulation of various
  signaling pathways (Notch, MAPK, FoxO signaling pathway, and Wnt/beta-catenin).
  Among all nodes, MAPKAPK2, CDC25B, CCNB1, CCNB2, PAK1, and STMN1 are known to exist
  in multiple signaling pathways.'
