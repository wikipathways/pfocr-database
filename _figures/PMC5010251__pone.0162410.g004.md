caption: 'Flavonol synthase (FLS) is not required for pigment production, but is necessary
  for the synthesis of the three flavonols: kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin. Anthocyanidins
  (pelargonidin, cyanidin, and delphinidin) are modified by the addition of sugars
  and other moieties to form anthocyanins in a species-specific manner. Pink-flowered
  gentians accumulate gentiocyanin anthocyanin in their petals, and blue-flowered
  gentians accumulate mainly gentiodelphin anthocyanin, whereas orange-flowered gentian
  accumulates exclusively pelargonidin glycosides in the petals. Abbreviations: ANS,
  anthocyanidin synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3''H, flavonoid 3''-hydroxlase; F3''5''H,
  flavonoid 3'',5''-hydroxlase; FLS, flavonol synthase; FSII, flavone synthase.'
