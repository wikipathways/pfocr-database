caption: Results of PPI, KEGG, Reactome, and GO analysis of 19 common proteins that
  were targets of 1-MNA and RA-associated gene targets. (A) The PPI network of 19
  common proteins was obtained from STRING analysis. (B) PPI network of 19 common
  proteins as constructed by Cytoscape, based on the degree of contribution, where
  the color of the node represents the degree of contribution of that node in the
  network. Histogram representation of (C) biological process, (D) molecular function,
  (E) KEGG pathways, and (F) Reactome pathways associated with the 19 common proteins
