caption: The activated H2 receptor probably signals via Gαq to phospholipase C (PLC),
  and the formed IP3 releases Ca2+ from calcium stores. This Ca2+ is able to activate
  eNOS to produce nitric oxide, which in turn activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC),
  and the cGMP so formed activates PKG. The depletion of the calcium stores opens
  a Ca2+ entrance pathway. The B2 receptor on these cells appears to lack a connection
  with Gαq, and probably signals via Gαi to a calcium-independent phospholipase A2
  (PLA2), and possibly to particulate guanylyl cyclase (pGC). Alternatively CNP could
  be released from the endothelium and activate pGC via the natriuretic peptide receptor.
  The arachidonic acid forms free radicals from cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase
  (LOX), and the consequent lipid peroxidation increases the plasma membrane permeability
  to Ca2+. This Ca2+ is, with activated PKG, required for increased permeability.
