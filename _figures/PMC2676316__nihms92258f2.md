caption: The biological mechanism underlying most of these pleiotropic effects of
  statins is inhibition of isoprenoid metabolism in non-hepatic cells (). Inhibition
  of mevalonate synthesis reduces cholesterol synthesis as well as synthesis of the
  isoprenoid intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, such as farnesol
  and geranylgeraniol . Isoprenoids are necessary for the posttranslational modification
  and subsequent trafficking of intracellular signalling molecules. In experimental
  systems, inhibition of isoprenylation of Rho GTPases mediates some of the cholesterol-independent
  effects of statins  (). For example, the RhoA-dependent cytoskeleton is a negative
  regulator of eNOS mRNA stability, and statins upregulate eNOS expression by inhibition
  of RhoA geranylgeranylation . Hence, is it is now possible to explain some important
  downstream effects of HMG CoA reduction at a cellular level and how they modify
  cellular phenotype through non-lipid-dependent mechanisms. In addition, many of
  these effects can be experimentally reproduced in much shorter time course than
  would be expected by effects mediated by lipid lowering alone. However, the question
  remains, do these effects occur in humans - and are they quantitatively relevant?
