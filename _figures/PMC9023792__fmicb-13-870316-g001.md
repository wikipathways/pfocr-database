caption: The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway in mammals. In the absence of HH ligands
  (left side), smoothened (SMO) is inhibited by primary cilium-localized Patched 1
  (PTCH1). With the inactivated SMO, full-length GLI2 and GLI3 (GLI2/3) are retained
  in the cytoplasm by suppressor of fused (SUFU) and phosphorylated by protein kinase
  A (PKA), casein kinases 1 (CK1), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Phosphorylated
  GLI2/3 are proteolytically processed by E3 ubiquitin ligase β-transducin repeat-containing
  protein, resulting in the production of the repressor form GLIR, which enters the
  nucleus to suppress the transcription of target genes. In the presence of HH ligands
  (right side), binding of HH to PTCH1 derepresses SMO. SMO is phosphorylated by CK1
  and GRK2 and translocates to the primary cilium. Activated SMO not only inhibits
  proteolytic processing of GLI2/3 but also promotes the recruitment of GLI2/3-SUFU
  complex to the tip of the primary cilium, leading to their dissociation and production
  of the activator form GLIA, a process that might involve Ellis-van Creveld/EVC2.
  GLIA enters the nucleus as transcription activators and promotes the transcription
  of target genes that are important for many cellular processes, including cell proliferation,
  differentiation, survival, and maintenance of stemness.
