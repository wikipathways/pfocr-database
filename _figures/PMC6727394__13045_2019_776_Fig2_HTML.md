caption: circRNAs and the Warburg effect associated signaling pathways. This figure
  indicates the effects of circRNAs on the Warburg effect-associated signaling pathways.
  The PI3K/Akt pathway promotes GLUT1, HK2, and PFK2. The alteration of RAS pathway
  upregulates GLUT1 and glycolytic enzymes. The STAT3 pathway gives rise to HK2. And
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway upregulates the transcription of MCT1 and PDK1. In these
  four pathways, most circRNAs work as ceRNAs to affect the Warburg effect. The circRNAs
  in the dark blue rounded rectangle are considered to function in cancer cells, while
  the circRNAs in the light blue rounded rectangle are just proved to function in
  normal cells. miRNAs are in the green rectangle; the components of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway are in the pink circle; the components of the RAS pathway are in the orange
  circle; the components of the STAT3 pathway are in the green circle; the components
  of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are in the yellow circle. The positive relationships
  are shown by arrows, and the negative relationships are shown by short dashes. BLC,
  bladder cancer; CRC, colorectal cancer; GC, gastric cancer; OS, osteosarcoma; OSCC,
  oral squamous cell carcinoma ; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer
