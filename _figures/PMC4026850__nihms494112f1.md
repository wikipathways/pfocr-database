caption: A simple pathway showing the degradation of (R)-mevalonate by the bacterium
  Pseudomonas mevalonii. The pathway starts with the compound that is being degraded
  and ends with acetyl-CoA, a common intermediate of central metabolism that feeds
  into the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle). The other end product, acetoacetate, is
  linked via a pathway link to the pathway that degrades that compound further into
  acetyl-CoA. Compounds are shown in red, enzymes in yellow, genes in purple, EC numbers
  in blue, and pathway links in green.
