caption: Firstly, there is an accumulation of the AMP analogue ZMP that induces the
  activation of the AMPK pathway, starting a cascade of signalling that affects mTOR
  and PI3P/Akt pathways; mTOR is inactivated and the accumulation of its downstream
  unphosphorylated substrates facilitates the apoptosis process. Akt also remains
  inactive, unable to block p53 and to activate mTOR. On the other hand, the inhibition
  of TS, DHFR, GARFT and AICART induces oxidative stress and DNA damage which in turn
  is detected by p53 and caspase-dependent and independent mitochondrial apoptosis
  that is activated as has been previously reported. Together all processes lead to
  an imbalance between cell death and survival stimuli that result in enhanced apoptotic
  signalling.
