caption: 'C. burnetii-interacting host proteins are present in interconnected Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways with the potential to affect multiple
  cellular processes of the host. The pathways are grouped into five major categories:
  RNA processing, protein processing, degradation pathways, signaling (including signaling
  events related to the immune response), and metabolism. The size of a star indicates
  the number of targeted host proteins in each pathway. ECM, extracellular matrix;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ErbB, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene; ESCRT,
  endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain; PIK3, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TGF, transforming growth factor.'
