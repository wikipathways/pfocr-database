caption: The binding of an as-yet-undefined ligand to DAF-2, the sole insulin/insulin-like
  growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor of C. elegans (I), triggers the insulin/IGF-1 signalling
  (IIS) pathway. This binding leads to DAF-2 self-phosphorylation and dimerization
  and to the recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase AGE-1 (II) and the insulin
  receptor substrate 1 orthologue IST-1. AGE-1 catalyses the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (III), a molecule that activates kinases of the AKT family (IV).
  The phosphatase DAF-18 (a PTEN orthologue) opposes AGE-1 activity by converting
  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to phospatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2); this leads
  to reduced AKT activation. Activated AKT phosphorylates the FOXO transcription factor
  DAF-16 (V), preventing it from entering the nucleus, where it would otherwise interact
  with its cofactors, including SMK-1 and SIR-2, and regulate its target genes (VI),
  which mediate longevity and stress resistance. Similarly, IIS prevents the transcription
  factor SKN-1 from entering the nucleus and executing its gene-expression functions.
  Heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1) is also critical for the longevity functions of IIS
  (VII) and might be negatively regulated by the IIS pathway (dashed line). HSF-1
  regulates the expression of key gene networks (IX) that are required for longevity
  and stress resistance, some of which are probably also regulated by DAF-16.
