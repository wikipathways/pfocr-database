caption: Active fatty acid oxidation increases the capacity for reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) quenching regardless of the nature of the stimulus. Model depicting the critical
  role of active fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  to support glucose (Glc) phosphorylation (to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)), resulting
  in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. Administration of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate
  (DEHP) results in the accumulation of ROS due to reduction of superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) activity mediated by its metabolite, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP). The
  observed reduction in SOD activity may be the result of MEHP-dependent dysregulation
  of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. ROS can also be formed in response
  to unrelated mechanisms (e.g., in response to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)).
  Increased concentrations of ROS redirect the glycolytic flux through PPP, leading
  to reduced levels of ATP (also via reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity)
  in cells that are incapable of active FAO (left). Reduced levels of ATP result in
  reduced rates of glucose phosphorylation and NADPH generation, which are factors
  that ultimately lead to cell death. In cells capable of active FAO, ATP is generated
  by a mechanism that does not rely on glycolysis. These cells produce higher levels
  of NADPH and are thus able to quench toxic ROS (right).
