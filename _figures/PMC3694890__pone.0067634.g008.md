caption: The GRB2-pY proteome interactions imply cross-talk between various signaling
  pathways that are functional to initiate various cellular responses. The GBR2 interactome
  revealed connections of RTK pathways with both classical GRB2-SOS-RAS cascade with
  PI3K-IRS1 cascade leading to AKT and ERK activation. The crosstalk between growth
  factor and cytokine signaling pathways as revealed by major receptors and adaptors
  and other downstream proteins. Upregulation of negative regulation of immune signaling
  pathways in tumor cells indicate the preparedness of tumor cells to fight and survive
  attack from host immune signaling mechanisms. Novel interactions are marked by red
  arrows.
