caption: pkd2 is localized to the Golgi membrane and also to the plasma membrane in
  a complex with rho1, which is present at the elongating cell tip in a complex with
  glucan synthase. Activation of pkd2 possibly results in Ca2+ entry. Upon Ca2+ entry,
  rho1 may be activated by the action of a GEF/GAP switch that has been shown to modulate/interact
  with rho1. Additionally, attachment of rho1 to the plasma membrane requires the
  activity of a geranylgeranyl transferase which has been suggested to be Ca2+-regulated.
  Modulation of rho1 affects the glucan synthase enzyme which is responsible for β-glucan
  synthesis in the cell wall. Alteration of glucan synthase activity causes changes
  in cell growth, shape and polarization of cell wall synthesis.
