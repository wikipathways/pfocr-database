caption: SAM-checkpoint in yeast and mammals. In yeast and mammalian cells, limiting
  methionine or SAM levels trigger a cell cycle arrest. In cancer cells, the arrest
  can also be induced when cells are shifted from methionine to homocysteine containing
  culture media (Hoffman effect). In both yeast and mammals, a destabilization of
  pre-replication complexes induces the SAM-checkpoint arrest. S-phase cannot be initiated
  and cells show an arrest in the G1-phase. Additionally, a delay in G2/M is observed.
  In yeast, sulfur containing metabolites are sensed by SCFMet30 and its substrates
  Met4 and Met32 coordinate methionine metabolism with proliferation. In mammalian
  cells, SAM is sensed by SAMTOR to regulate mTORC1 activity, yet its involvement
  in the SAM checkpoint is unlikely (see main text). However, p38, MK2, and Cdk2 have
  been suggested to play a role in the stability of pre-replication complexes. How
  this pathway receives information about methionine metabolism is however unknown.
