caption: a, NIR light activates PMILs within the tumour microvasculature and parenchyma
  for simultaneous neovascular damage, tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis as well
  as liposome disruption with initiation of sustained multikinase inhibition. The
  PMIL delivery system is tuneable for simultaneous delivery of photodynamic, chemotherapeutics
  and small-molecular inhibitors. b, Schematic of a three-way interactive combination
  therapy with photodynamic tumour cell and microvasculature damage and inhibition
  of treatment escape pathways. VEGFR signalling stimulates tumour angiogenesis and
  preparation of the premetastatic niche via supporting endothelial cell survival,
  migration and proliferation as well as increased vessel permeability and chemotaxis
  of bone marrow derived progenitor cells. MET signalling promotes escape from cytotoxic
  and antiangiogenic therapy via supporting cancer cell survival, motility and metastasis
  as well as cancer stem-like cell maintenance and tumour angiogenesis via cross talk
  with the VEGFR pathway. XL184 inhibits activation of both the MET and VEGF signalling
  pathways to suppress tumour cell survival, metastasis and regrowth following cytotoxic
  therapy.
