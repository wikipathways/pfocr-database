caption: 'Selected part of the central metabolism in C. glutamicum. The l-valine pathway
  is marked in yellow. The enzymes inactivated or overexpressed in some of the analyzed
  strains are shown in green. Heterologous transhydrogenase genes (blue) are expressed

  glycolysis; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; PTS,
  phosphotransferase system; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PK,
  pyruvate kinase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PQO, pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase;
  AK, acetate kinase; PTA, phosphotransacetylase; CS, citrate synthase; PEPCx, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase; PEPCk, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PCx, pyruvate carboxylase;
  ODx, oxaloacetate decarboxylase; ME, malic enzyme; MQO, malate-quinone oxidoreductase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; AHAS, acetohydroxyacid synthase; AHAIR, acetohydroxyacid
  isomeroreductase; DHAD, dihydroxyacid dehydratase; TA, valine transaminase; THD,
