caption: Role of hTid-1 in various cellular processes. A hTid-1 acts as a co-chaperone
  causing conformational changes in Hsp70/Hsc70 which helps it to interact with Jak2
  kinases, thereby inhibiting it. B hTid-1 along with Hsp70/Hsc70 interacts with IκB
  and helps in cell growth. C hTid-1L causes the attachment of poly-ubiquitin chains
  to ErBb2 which leads to its subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway.
  D hTid-1 causes the attachment of poly-ubiquitin chains to EGFR which leads to its
  subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway. E hTid-1 plays an important
  role in autophagic degradation by interaction with the Beclin1-PI3 kinase class
  III protein complex
