caption: Mechanisms responsible for β-catenin activation in human hepatoblastoma (HB).
  (A) In quiescent hepatocytes, the β-catenin pathway is turned off (β-catenin OFF).
  Wild-type β-catenin (unstable β-catenin) is sequestered by a destruction complex
  consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β),
  AXIN1, and casein kinase I α (CK1-α) and primed for proteolysis. (B) In HB, through
  somatic mutations (mutant β-catenin), β-catenin escapes proteasomal degradation
  and translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid
  enhancer 1 (LEF-1) transcription factors and induces the transcription (transcription
  ON) of target genes, including glutamine synthetase (GLUL), growth regulation by
  estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1), leukocyte-cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2),
  cyclin D1, leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), c-Myc,
  etc. Alternatively, β-catenin degradation is suppressed by HB tumor cells via CAPRIN2-activating
  mutations. Mutant CAPRIN2 activates LDL-receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/6)
  than in turn activates the adaptor protein Disheveled (DVL). Consequently, DVL triggers
  GSK-3β inactivation and disrupts the β-catenin destruction complex. Furthermore,
  c-Met receptor activation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin via tyrosine phosphorylation. In quiescence, c-Met and β-catenin physically
  interact at the inner surface of the hepatocyte plasma membrane.
