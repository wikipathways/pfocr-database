caption: Downregulated miR-18b (miR-18b-5p) signaling pathway in fALS linked SOD1
  mutation. A schematic diagram illustrates that downregulated miR-18b (miR-18b-5p)
  by SOD1 mutation directly increases Hif1α. Mef2c is controlled by overexpressed
  Hif1α. Increased Mef2c is related with miR-206 expression. Mctp1 and Rarb are downregulated
  by increased miR-206. Intracellular Ca2+ levels is increased by downregulated Mctp1
  and Neuronal differentiation is reduced by downregulated Rarb. Apoptotic cell death
  is induced by prohibited Ca2+signaling and Neuronal differentiation. As a result,
  downregulated miR-18b-5p by SOD1 mutation leads to apoptotic cell death in fALS
  linked SOD1 mutation
papertitle: Downregulated miR-18b-5p triggers apoptosis by inhibition of calcium signaling
  and neuronal cell differentiation in transgenic SOD1 (G93A) mice and SOD1 (G17S
  and G86S) ALS patients.
