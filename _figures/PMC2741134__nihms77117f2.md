caption: Upon binding to its dimeric receptor (IFNAR1 & IFNAR2), type I IFN promotes
  the apposition of two receptor associated JAKs (Jak1 & Tyk2), directing transphosphorylation
  and activation. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate receptor tyrosine(s), promoting
  a SH2 domain dependent recruitment of Stat1 and Stat2. At the receptor, Stat1 and
  Stat2 are activated by phosphorylation, they heterodimerizes, translocate into the
  nucleus, and associate with IRF-9 to from ISGF-3, which binds to ISREs to drive
  the expression of corresponding target genes. Only type I and type III IFNs signal
  through this pathway. IFN-γ directs the activation of a unique dimeric receptor
  (i.e., IFNGR1 & IFNGR2) by promoting the activation of two receptor associated JAKs
  (i.e., Jak1 and Jak2). These JAKs phosphorylate a single IFNGR1 tyrosine, which
  directs the SH2 domain dependent recruitment and activation of Stat1. Activated
  Stat1 homodimers translocate to the nucleus, bind to the members of the GAS family
  of enhancers and drive the expression of target genes. All four-helix bundle cytokines
  family, including type I and III IFNs transduce signals through this pathway.
