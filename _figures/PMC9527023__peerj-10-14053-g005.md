caption: Skeletal muscle is a highly vascularized tissue and endothelial cells are
  the main cell type of blood vessels. During muscle regeneration, endothelial cells
  release lactic acid, which directly controls macrophage function. Under lactic acid
  stimulation, pro-inflammatory macrophages differentiate into reparative macrophages,
  which secrete large amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), actively
  supporting muscle vascularization and forming a positive feedback pathway. VEGF
  also induces the proliferation and differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells
  (MPCs) in skeletal muscle. Muscle regeneration depends on the self-renewal of MPCs
  to replenish the muscle stem cell pool, and MPCs repair damaged muscle by differentiating
  and fusing with each other; following injury to skeletal muscle, membrane linked
  protein A1 (Annexin A1), which is secreted in large numbers by neutrophils, activates
  the FPR2/ALX receptor on the surface of macrophages and the downstream adenylate-activated
  protein kinase signaling (AMPK) pathway, promoting the conversion of pro-inflammatory
  macrophages to reparative macrophages.
