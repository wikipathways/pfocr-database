caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of Rho/Rock signaling pathway. Rho gradually
  activates the downstream ROCK after activation of inflammatory factor. ROCKK1 inhibits
  the dephosphorylation of pMLC-2, and ROCK2 inhibits the activity of IκB, an inhibitor
  of NF-κB proteins, which leads to the entry of more NF-κB-active dimers into the
  nucleus, promoting the release of inflammatory factors, and aggravating the damage
  of intestinal barrier as well as contributing to intestinal sepsis through the two
  pathways. damage as well as contributing to the development of intestinal sepsis.
