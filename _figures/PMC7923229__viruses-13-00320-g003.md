caption: 'TRIM5α-mediated regulation of innate immune signaling and molecular inflammation.
  The TAK1 signaling pathway is activated upon TLR4 stimulation, or upon sensing of
  viral capsid by TRIM5α. Subsequently, the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is activated
  and, together with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex UEV1A-UBC13, promotes
  K63-chain linked ubiquitination and autophosphorylation of the TAK1-TAB complex.
  In the context of HIV-1 infection, sensing of the viral capsid by TRIM5α initiates
  its E3 ligase activity resulting in K63-chain linked ubiquitination and autophosphorylation
  of the TAK1-TAB complex. Subsequently, the TAK1-TAB complex activates the transcription
  factors NF-kB and AP-1, leading to the transcription and ultimately secretion of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8. The autophagy-related proteins
  ULK1, Beclin1 and ATG7 are essential for TRIM5α to function as an innate immune
  sensor. However, precisely how they contribute to the TRIM5α-mediated inflammation
  is as yet uncertain. TLR4: toll-like receptor 4, TAK1: transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1, TAB: TAK1-binding protein, UEV1A: ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant
