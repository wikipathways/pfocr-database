caption: 'Directed evolution of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase AdmK.Notes: Andrimid
  is biosynthesized by a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase
  pathway. AdmK is responsible for valine incorporation and was targeted for directed
  evolution. AdmK was deleted from the chromosome of the native producer, Pantoea
  agglomerans, followed by the transformation with a library of AdmK mutants. Four
  compounds were identified using the high-throughput multiplexed LC-MS/MS screening
  method and were assayed for bioactivity by agar overlay. Compound 5, 6, and 7 are
  new andrimid derivatives and compound 4 has been reported previously.Abbreviations:
  KS, ketosynthase; CLF, chain length factor; DH, dehydrogenase; KR, ketoreductase;
  T, thiolation; TG, transglutaminase; A, adenylation; Mut, aminomutase; C, condensation;
  TE, thioesterase. 1 andrimid, 4 isoleucine-andrimid, 5 leucine-andrimid, 6 alanine-andrimid,
  7 phenylalanine-andrimid; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.'
