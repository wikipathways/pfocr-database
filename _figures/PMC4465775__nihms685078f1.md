caption: 'Insulin binding to the α-chains of the IR triggers pY of the β-chains of
  the receptor inside neurons. Thus activated, the IR binds and tyrosine phosphorylates
  IRS-1. This leads to activation of PI3K, then Akt and thereafter diverse downstream
  signaling molecules. (A–G) The sequence of steps likely to inhibit this pathway
  in AD. (A) Aβ oligomers and protofibrils activate microglial cells, (B) which consequently
  secrete a number of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.
  (C) Via their receptors on neurons, each of these cytokines activate one or more
  of three major IRS-1 serine kinases, JNK, IKK and ERK. (D) Each of these kinases
  phosphorylate one or more IRS-1 sites, including S312, S616 and/or S636/639 (S307,
  S612 and S632/635 in rodents, respectively). For simplicity, S636/639 in this review
  is simply called S636. Such phosphorylation, which is abnormally high in cerebral
  pyramidal cells of Alzheimer’s disease cases, inhibits IRS-1 interactions with the
  (E) IR upstream and (F) with PI3K downstream, thereby inhibiting transmission of
  insulin signals to downstream targets such as GSK-3 and mTOR complex 1. (G) Serine
  phosphorylation of IRS-1 can also promote its sequestration and/or degradation.
  (E–G) These last three events lead to insulin resistance, which is known to impair
  clearance of extracellular Aβ [], presumably leading to further insulin resistance
  through the steps shown here. Aβ: Amyloid-β; IR: Insulin receptor; pY: Tyrosine
  phosphorylation.'
