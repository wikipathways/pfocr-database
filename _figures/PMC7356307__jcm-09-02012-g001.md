caption: 'Simplified schematic of the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway in healthy controls
  and changes in cystic fibrosis patients, including the low- and high-molecular-mass
  substrates, inhibitors, reaction products, enzymes. Green arrows indicate changes
  observed in the pediatric cystic fibrosis patients compared to healthy controls.
  Arg is metabolized by NOS, to build NO and citrulline (not shown). NO then may function
  as a signaling molecule and is quickly oxidized to form nitrite and nitrate, which
  are excreted in urine. The urinary excretion and reabsorption of nitrite is CA dependent.
  Arg in proteins might be methylated by PRMT to build ADMA or SDMA in proteins, which
  are released during proteolysis. ADMA is further metabolized by DDAH) to form DMA.
  DMA is the main metabolite of ADMA excreted in urine, but ADMA can be found in urine
  as well. ADMA and SDMA both are able to inhibit NOS activity. The Arg/ADMA ratio
  is a measure of NO synthesis capacity. Abbreviations: ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  Arg, L-arginine; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DDAH, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase;
  NO, nitric oxide; NO2, nitrite; NO3, nitrate; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PRMT,
  protein-arginine methyl transferase; SDMA; symmetric dimethylarginine. Double arrows
  indicate reactions might be reversable. The double-arrow on CA indicates that excretion
  and resorption of nitrite are CA-dependent. Green ellipses indicate enzymes involved
  in the metabolism. Rectangles indicate products in the Arg/NO metabolism, blue rectangles
  highlight products in the Arg/NO metabolism, which are considered atherosclerotic
  risk factors []. Yellow rectangles indicate all other Arg/NO metabolites. A red
  blunt-ended arrow indicates the inhibition of ADMA on NOS. A violet-marked rectangle
  indicates excretion, and a light blue rectangle indicates function of the molecule.'
