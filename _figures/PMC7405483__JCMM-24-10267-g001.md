caption: Potential effects of siRNAs on silencing viral genes at the post‐transcriptional
  level in COVID‐19. Coronaviruses enter the cell via the endosomal pathway exploiting
  autophagy or the non‐endosomal pathway, both leading to the release of the nucleocapsid
  into the cytoplasm. Replication of genomic RNA takes place in double‐membrane vesicles
  (DMVs) shielded from host immune responses, where the translation of ORF1a/b into
  the replicase polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab will take place. Papain‐like proteases
  (PLpro) and 3C‐like protease (3CLpro) cleave pp1a and pp1ab to produce non‐structural
  proteins (nsp), including replicases (RNA‐dependent RNA polymerases) and helicases.
  The positive‐strand genomic RNA is transcribed to form a negative‐strand template
  for the synthesis of new genomic RNAs and subgenomic negative‐strand templates.
  mRNA is synthesized and translated into producing the structural and accessory viral
  proteins. siRNAs can potentially silence genes at post‐transcriptional level, degrading
  mRNA and blocking its translation. (adapted after Zumla et al)
