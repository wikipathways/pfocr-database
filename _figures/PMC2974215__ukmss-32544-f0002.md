caption: TNF-dependent signalling pathways mediated through TNFR1 and TNFR2. Signalling
  of TNF through TNFR1 either results in formation of complex I and activation of
  NFκB (pathway 1) promoting inflammation, survival and differentiation or provokes
  cell death through complex II and activation of caspases (pathway 2). Recruitment
  of ASK-1 (pathway 3) induces JNK and AP-1 which in turn may initiate apoptosis or
  survival. TNFR2-dependent signalling may also promote cell death or survival through
  pathways 1 and 2, respectively, but also activate PI3K/AKT suppressing apoptosis
  and increasing promoting proliferation, migration and survival.
