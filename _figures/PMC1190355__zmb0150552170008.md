caption: A model of IRAK1c regulation of inflammation. Upon TIR activation by the
  appropriate ligand, the Tollip-IRAK1 complex is recruited to the TIR receptor at
  the membrane and interacts with MyD88 and TRAF6. IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1 (1)
  resulting in IRAK1 autophosphorylation and activation (2). IRAK1 then disengages
  from the receptor complex of MyD88 and Tollip (3) but remains associated with TRAF6,
  resulting in activation of the NF-κB pathway and production of proinflammatory cytokines
  (4). The splice variant IRAK1c cannot be phosphorylated by IRAK4, does not undergo
  autophosphorylation, and thus does not activate downstream signaling events.
