caption: Proposed metabolic pathway for silybin biosynthesis. Callus extract contains
  dicaffeoylquinic acid (S. marianum callus components), which is converted to caffeoyl-CoA
  that further metabolizes to either taxifolin or coniferyl alcohol. Both taxifolin
  and coniferyl alcohol are combined for synthesis of silymarin compounds.
