  adiposity promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine and adipokine production leading to
  chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. These mediators augment procoagulant factor
  production, contributing to increased asthma pathogenesis in Type-2 high asthma
  with comorbid obesity. Additionally, the impact of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, monocyte
  chemoattractant protein-1 (MPC-1), and free fatty acids (FFAs) leads to insulin
  resistance, hepatic steatosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In response
  to upregulated mediators, the airway experiences increased leukocyte infiltration,
  fibrosis, narrowing, mucin production, angiogenesis and hyperresponsiveness. The
  figure only includes coagulation mediators of the extrinsic and common pathway;
  the intrinsic coagulation mediators are beyond the scope of this review. Red arrows
  indicates contribution to worsening asthma and green arrows indicate improvement
