caption: Therapeutic potential of anti-IL-1 agents in hidradenitis suppurativa. Several
  targeted agents are currently available or under investigation for the treatment
  of HS, investigating the potential benefits of blocking the IL-1 signaling pathway
  at various levels. IL-1 and IL-36, by binding their respective receptor complexes,
  are able to induce the expression of downstream genes, mostly transducing proinflammatory
  mediators. Two monoclonal antibodies canakinumab and lutikizumab primarily target
  IL-1β. MEDI8968 and anakinra exert their action by inhibiting the IL-1R1 receptor,
  thus preventing its activation by both IL-1α and IL-1β. Spesolimab and imsidolimab
  are two agents selectively targeting the IL-36 receptor. Lastly, zimlovisertib and
  KT-474 target IRAK4, thereby blocking the downstream inflammatory cascade. AMPs,
  antimicrobial peptides; CCL, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand; CD, cluster of differentiation;
  CXCL, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand; HLA-DR, human leucocyte antigen-DR isotype;
  IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; IRAK, interleukin receptor-associated kinase;
  MYD, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAF,
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
