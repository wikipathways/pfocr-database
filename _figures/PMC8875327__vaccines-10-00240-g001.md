caption: 'Mechanism of action of therapeutic cancer vaccine. Tumor antigens from vaccines
  are taken up and processed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and presented on MHC
  class I and MHC class II molecules on the surface of these cells. In the tumor-draining
  lymph nodes, the interaction of specific T cell receptor (TCR)—the MCH-I complex—lead
  to the activation of CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and subsequently
  antigen recognition in the tumor cells by CTLs. CTLs then destroy the tumor cells
  by different processes, such as the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (IFNγ,
  TNFα) or via the perforin/granzyme pathway. The presentation of tumor antigens on
  MHC-II complex also leads to CD4+ T helper cell activation, which facilitates the
  activation of several T cell subtypes. The secretion of IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ by
  CD4+ T helper cells promotes the activation of CD8+ T cells into CTLs. In addition,
  activated CD4+ T helper cells promote tumor clearance by enhancing the generation
  of antibodies against tumor antigens by B cells, killing the activity of natural
  killer cells and the phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages Abbreviations: MHC—major
  histocompatibility complex; APC, IL—interleukin; IFN—interferon; NK cell—natural
  killer cell (re-drawn from the presentation by L. Decoster et al. []).'
