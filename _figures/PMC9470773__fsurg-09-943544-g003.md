caption: Tyrosine kinase receptors involved in angiogenesis and cell proliferation.
  Obesity promotes proangiogenic factors that act at the receptor level. Cancer cells
  that are able to evade hormonal resistance are proposed to do so through an activation
  of the PI3K pathway, but MTOR inhibition can be used to overcome this.
