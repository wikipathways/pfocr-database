caption: The canonical and non-canonical Smad signaling pathways induced by TGF-β.
  In the canonical Smad signaling pathway, TGF-β phosphorylates TGF-βRII, which recruits
  and phosphorylates TGF-βRI. The activated TGF-βRI subsequently phosphorylates Smad2
  and Smad3 proteins. These activated Smad2 and Smad3 proteins then recruit Smad4
  to form a complex, which translocates into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the
  Smad complex interacts with specific DNA sequences and other transcription factors
  to promote the transcription and expression of target genes, such as CTGF (Connective
  Tissue Growth Factor). In the subarachnoid space, CTGF contributes to pia mater
  fibrosis by promoting the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix components.
  In the non-canonical Smad signaling pathway, the activated TGF-βRI/II complex can
  further activate Cdc42/Rac1, which in turn activates downstream factors such as
  the P38 and PAK2 signaling pathways
