caption: Natural MSC‐Es have inherent therapeutic effects caused by their cargoes.
  They can modulate immune responses and reverse tissue damages. (a) MSC‐Es can increase
  blood oxygen saturation and decrease lung severity score, neutrophil accumulation,
  fibrin score, and alveolar wall thickness by reversing ALI and ARDS and repairing
  lung tissue. (b) In addition, they can inhibit cytokine storms by reducing pro‐inflammatory
  factors and increasing anti‐inflammatory factors. (c) Also, MSC‐E miRNAs re‐regulate
  signaling pathways. The miR‐182‐5p and miR‐23a‐3p both reduce the IKKβ level that
  is the NF‐κB pathway initiator by decreasing its synthesis and increasing its ubiquitination
  respectively. The up‐regulation of the Nrf‐2 signaling pathway increases anti‐oxidant
  release on the other hand
