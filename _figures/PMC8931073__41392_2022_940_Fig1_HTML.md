caption: A drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state enables multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer
  cell survival after the canonical MDR reversal treatment. a Variable levels of drug
  resistance in cancer cells are attributed to genetic heterogeneity, which induces
  the high expression of drug-resistant proteins, thus leading to MDR clone formation.
  However, nongenetic variations (epigenetics) in cancer cells can occur upon cancer
  therapy, representing the source of genetically resistant clones and resulting in
  several unusual changes including a highly flexible metabolic pathway, the slowdown
  of proliferation, stemness maintenance etc. These phenotypes hold extensive overlaps
  with embryos under stressful environments and are closely linked to the modulation
  of redox signaling. Indeed, cancer cells entering a DTP state can reset the redox
  signaling networks, therefore possessing an antioxidative defense mechanism against
  oxidative stress. b Zhang et al. present the detailed mechanisms for illuminating
  the role of redox balance in persisters. The figure was created by BioRender
