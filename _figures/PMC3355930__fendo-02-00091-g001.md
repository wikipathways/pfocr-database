caption: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis and signaling. Upon its release from
  plasma membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid is converted
  to the unstable endoperoxide intermediates, prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and prostaglandin
  H2 (PGH2) by the cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2, encoded by separate genes). Both
  COX isoforms catalyze the same reactions, but while COX-1 is constitutively expressed,
  COX-2 is rapidly and transiently upregulated by cytokines and growth factors. Terminal
  synthases convert both PGG2 and PGH2 into prostaglandins [PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, prostacyclin
  (PGI2)], and thromboxane (TxA2). Once synthesized, PGE2 immediately diffuses away
  and activates its specific E-prostanoid receptors (EP1–4), which belong to the family
  of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors. EP2 and EP4 are coupled to Gs
  and stimulate the adenylyl cyclase (AC)–cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–protein
  kinase A (PKA) pathway. In contrast, EP3 is coupled to Gi and inhibits AC activation,
  resulting in decreased cAMP concentrations. EP1 is thought to be coupled to the
  Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, leading to an elevation of free cytosolic calcium
  concentrations (Milatovic et al., ). Notably, an examination of the capacity of
  the hypothalamus to metabolize arachidonic acid through the COX pathway has revealed
  a pubertal increase in the formation of PGE2, particularly during the first proestrus
  (Ojeda and Campbell, ). Intriguingly, the increase in PGE2synthesis is not associated
  with changes in the formation of PGF2α, PGI2, PGD2, or thromboxane A2 from exogenous
  arachidonic acid, suggesting that it is a specific event directly associated with
  the peripubertal activation of the reproductive hypothalamus (Ojeda and Campbell,
  ). Such a selective synthesis of PGE2 has also been shown to be triggered by estrogens
  during early postnatal development (Amateau and McCarthy, ).
