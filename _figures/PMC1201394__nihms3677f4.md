caption: A, Mdm2 is negatively regulated by p19Arf. As a ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2 regulates
  the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Therefore,
  p19Arf-deficient cells are immortal and lack expression of p53 and p21Cip1. In normal
  cells, p21Cip1 is transcriptionally regulated by p53. It has been suggested recently
  that Tsg101 is a positive regulator for Mdm2 protein levels and function. Therefore,
  the deletion of the Tsg101 gene (right panel) should destabilize Mdm2 and induce
  a p53/p21Cip1-mediated G1 arrest in cells lacking p19Arf. B, experimental design
  to study the proposed interaction of Tsg101 with Mdm2/p53 in immortalized cells
  lacking p19Arf. The Cre-mediated deletion of Tsg101 in Cdkn2a−/− immortalized cells
  should have a biologically relevant effect on Mdm2 and p53 protein levels and restore
  the cell cycle arrest.
