caption: Bioactivities and possible mechanisms of pterostilbene. The anti-tumor mechanism
  of pterostilbene is related to several tumor characteristics, including anti-proliferation
  (AKT/mTOR, ERK1/2 and JAK/STAT3 pathway), the induction of apoptosis (AKT/mTOR/p70S6K
  and ERS pathway), the inhibition of invasion and metastasis (Src/Fak and Rac1/WAVE/Arp2/3
  pathway), and the inhibition of tumor stem cells (GRP78 pathway). AKT, active human
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; JAK/STAT3, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  p70S6K, downstream of mTOR; ERS, endoplasmic reticulum stress; Src/Fak, steroid
  receptor coactivator/focal adhesion kinase; Rac1, Rac family small GTPase 1; WAVE,
  WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein; Arp2/3, actin-related protein 2/3; GRP78,
  glucose-regulated protein; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; IL-6,
  interleukin-6; MMP2, matrix metalloprotein-2; MMP9, matrix metalloprotein-9.
