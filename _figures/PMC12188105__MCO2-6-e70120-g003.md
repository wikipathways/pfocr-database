caption: LncRNAs regulate glutamine metabolism in cancer. (A) In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
  IncRNA TUG1 has been shown to increase glutamine metabolism by inhibiting miR‐145and
  thereby preventing the degradation of mitochondrial protein Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) mRNA
  enables GDH to become deacetylated, which enhances its activity. (B) HOTAIR regulates
  GLS expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for the miRNA‐126‐5p,
  thus altering the glutamine metabolism process of glioma and promoting the development
  of tumor growth. (C) OIPS‐AS1 functions as a miR‐217 sponge to increase the expression
  of GLS, thereby upregulating glutaminolysis, contributing to the malignant development
  of melanoma tumors. (D) (lincRNA‐p21), which downregulated in cancer and increase
  glutamine metabolism and increase expression of GLS even though the mechanisms are
  still unknown. (E) In prostate cancer. IncRNA IDH1 antisense RNA1 (IDH1‐AS1) enhances
  IDH1 enzymatic activity at the posttranslational level by facilitating IDH1 homodimerization,
  resulting in increased production of α‐ketoglutarate (α‐KG). (F) UCA1 acts as a
  sponge for miR‐16, impairing canonical miR‐16 binding to the 3'UTR of GLS2 mRNA
  and preventing GLS2 mRNA degradation and is transcriptionally upregulated by HIF‐1a
  under hypoxia. thereby contributing glutamine metabolism in bladder cancer. (G)
  EPB41L4A‐AS1 eventually inhibits glycolysis and glutaminolysis in cancer cells by
  reducing HIF‐1α protein levels and inactivated downstream p‐elF20/ATF4 pathway but
  Low expression of the IncRNA EPB41L4A‐AS1, is involved in glutaminolysis. (H) Overexpression
  of CCAT2 predominantly G allele in the CC cells increases intracellular and extracellular
  glutamate, which correlates with the high activity of GLS. (I) In pancreatic cancer,
  IncRNA GLS‐AS expression is downregulated and participates in cancer metabolism,
  which is regulated by the c‐Myc transcriptional factor, thereby increasing the expression
  of GLS2. Reciprocal feedback, where GLS‐AS overexpression inhibited GLS expression
  and decreased c‐Myc protein levels in a proteasome‐dependent way. (J) HOTTIP overexpression
  raises GLS1 expression levels and enhances glutamine metabolism, and there occurs
  a suppression of IncRNA HOTTIP induced by miR‐192. miR‐204
