caption: Pathway and carbon flux from glycerol to L-phenylalanine. Scheme of carbon
  flux to L-Phe based on glycerol. Broken arrows indicate an incomplete presentation
  of the metabolic pathway. The reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase (GlpK) transketolase
  (TktA) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (GlpX) are highlighted in bold. Numerics
  indicate the numbers of molecules from the aforementioned compounds. Based on 1000
  molecules of glycerol, 298.7 molecules of L-Phe can be formed.
