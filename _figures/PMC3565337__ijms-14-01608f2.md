caption: High-fluence UV radiation activates UVR8 independent stress pathway and cell
  death. A, Stress from UV exposure activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPK) cascade which leads to regulation of PCD; B, ROS released from chloroplast
  and mitochondria causes membrane lipid and protein oxidation, Mitochondrial Transmembrane
  Potential (MTP) loss from mitochondria results in cytochrome c release and activation
  of caspases and finally DNA laddering; C, High UV stress leads to A and B, which
  result in cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation showing Apoptotic like-PCD (AL-PCD).
  * Dotted arrow indicates the stress response pathway activated by yet unknown UV
  photoreceptor; “?” indicates the unknown UV photoreceptor, obscure role of UVR8
  dependant pathway under stress conditions and the mechanistic involvement of AtDAD1,
  AtDAD2 and AtBI in UV induced PCD is unclear.
