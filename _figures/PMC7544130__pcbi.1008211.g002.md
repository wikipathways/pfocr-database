caption: 'a) A dynamical regulation model of host responses against blood-stage malaria.
  We condensed the complexity of the vertebrate innate response against malaria into
  two independent pathways responsible for general RBC clearance and targeted iRBC
  clearance (represented by the yellow and green block, respectively). We modelled
  each pathway using a single differential equation, the activity of which is denoted
  Ni where the subscript i indicates the identity of each response: general RBC clearance,
  i = 1; and targeted iRBC clearance, i = 2. (The schematic shows the example of i
  = 1.) For each response type, the host detects a within-host cue, Ci. The product
  of the cue and the strength constant, ψi, activates the response. The activity of
  a response decays spontaneously with a half-life, ϕi. The output of each host response
  feeds back to influence the within-host infection dynamics (indicated by the coloured
  arrows in panel b). b) Dynamics of RBCs and blood-stage malaria parasites within
  the host. Recruitment into and transitions among components of the asexual cycle
  are indicated with black arrows. Background mortality for different components is
  indicated by grey arrows. General clearance of RBCs and targeted clearance of iRBCs
  are marked with yellow and green arrows, respectively. Replenishment of RBCs (erythropoiesis)
  is indicated in blue.'
