caption: Fusobacterium nucleatum reshapes the tumor milieu in CRC cells and immune
  cells [This figure was created using MedPeer (www.medpeer.cn)]. F. nucleatum causes
  M2 macrophage polarization, upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activates
  the NF-κB pathway in CRC cells. Additionally, F. nucleatum attracts immune cells
  derived from bone marrow, including DC, TAN, TAM, and MDSC. TAM secretes a range
  of growth factors and chemokines that facilitate tumor proliferation, metastasis,
  and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum binds TIGIT (via Fap 2) and causes lymphocyte apoptosis,
  which suppresses the activity of human immune cells
