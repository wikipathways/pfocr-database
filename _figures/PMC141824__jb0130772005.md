caption: Purine nucleotide biosynthesis and transport in S. pneumoniae. Proposed pathways
  for purine transport and the de novo biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides
  are shown. The function of each gene product was assigned based on sequence homology
  (). PbuX and Spr0264 are proposed to be transporters. A homologue of gde that mediates
  the conversion of xanthine to guanine was not identified in the S. pneumoniae R6
  genome (). Enzymes shown in boxes are those whose relative transcript amounts increased
  significantly in response to puromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, or erythromycin
  treatment (Fig. ).
