caption: Key players in the GD3 synthase (GD3S)/ganglioside GD2 (GD2)-dependent signaling
  pathway that regulates stemness, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and
  metastatic dissemination in cancer cells. Extracellular EMT-inducing signals (e.g.,
  transforming growth factor β [TGFβ]) and inflammation elicit the activation of EMT-inducing
  transcription factors (Snail, Twist) and nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) that coordinately
  promote the expression of the central EMT-mediator forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2),
  which transcriptionally activates GD3S. GD3S is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer
  of sialic acid from cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid to GM3 to produce the ganglioside
  GD3 (GD3), which is subsequently converted to GD2 via the activity of GD2 synthase
  (GD2S) and the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). Although GD2S is directly
  responsible for GD2 biosynthesis, GD3S is the rate-limiting enzyme for GD2 biosynthesis
  in cells that have undergone EMT and mesenchymal breast cancer cells. Targeting
  GD3S and/or c-Met signaling using triptolide or SU11274, respectively, reverts the
  combined EMT/cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype and abrogates metastasis. Anti-GD2–based
  immunotherapies may also be used to eradicate CSCs. Broken arrows indicate unknown
  intermediate steps.
