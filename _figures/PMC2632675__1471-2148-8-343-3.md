caption: Cell cycle pathways in S. cerevisiae. The pathway figure was downloaded from
  KEGG database. Genes from Group I, II and III were denoted in red, blue and light
  green, respectively. Genes with dark green were not included in our orthologous
  matrix because they might be missing from one of the studied species.
