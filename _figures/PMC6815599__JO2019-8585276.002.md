caption: Proposed models for the role of exosomal miR-21 in CRC development. (a) Fibroblast-derived
  exosomes have an effect on CRC cells. The internalization of normal fibroblast-
  (NOF-) derived exosomes into CRC cells leads to an increase of cellular miR-21 and
  to the activation of phospho-Erk/Akt pathway, leading to oxaliplatin resistance.
  (b) CRC cells release miR-21-containing exosomes that are able to inhibit endothelial
  progenitor cell (EPC) IL6R mRNA transcription, leading to a reduced migration, proliferation,
  and invasion and favoring thrombosis in CRC. (c) Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
  secrete miR-21-overexpressing exosomes which increase liver metastases. Tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) also release miR-21-containing exosomes that can negatively regulate
  BRG1 mRNA in CRC cells and lead to an increased migration and proliferation.
