caption: 'Description of 3 overlapping-pathways for complement activation: The complement:
  opsonin C3b, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a (complement peptides), and membrane-attack
  complex (MAC, C5b-9), produced by all three pathways. (1) In classical pathway,
  C1 complex (C1qC1rC1s) formed from C1q, C1r, and C1s attaches antigen–antibody complexes
  and results in the development of C2 and C4, which form a C3 convertase (C4bC2a).
  The latter cleaves C3 further into C3b (an opsonin) and C3a (an anaphylatoxin).
  Binding another C3b to the C3 convertase creates a C5 convertase (C4b2a3b). (2)
  The lectin pathway is similar to the classical pathway, but it is activated by a
  complex of sMBL-MASPs instead of classical C1 protease complex (C1qC1rC1s). (3)
  The alternative pathway (AP) is continuously self-activated in plasma by low-grade
  hydrolysis (tick-over) of C3 that forms C3(H2O). On pathogen surface or infected
  tissue, the nondiscriminate tick-over immediately binds factors B and D to form
  a C3 convertase C3bBb or C3(H2O)Bb to activate more C3b. (4) C3b, which is produced
  by either of the 3 pathways, opsonizes the target, binds a C3 convertase to generate
  [C4b2a3b or (C3b)2Bb] trimolecular C5 convertases, and generates more C3b via AP.
  C5 splits into C5a, which is a strong anaphylatoxin, and C5b, which initiates the
  terminal lytic cascade to form the complex membrane-attack complex (C5b-9, MAC).
  C3a and C5a are potent neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. In serious COVID-19
  patients, complement activation can lead to the harmful inflammatory response. C3,
  C5, and MASP-2 may act as therapeutic targets [, , –]'
