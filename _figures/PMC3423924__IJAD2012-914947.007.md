caption: Schematic representation of the perforant pathway. The perforant pathway
  is similar for humans and rats apart from minor variations. (1) The cells of origin
  (CO) for the perforant pathway (PP) reside in layer II (shown as cell islands) and
  in the superficial part of layer III of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The cells of
  origin receive information from many cortical regions. (2) Axons of the cells of
  origin converge in the angular bundle (AB) from which the perforant pathway emerges.
  (3) Upon leaving the angular bundle the axons (4) diverge into fascicles known as
  the perforant pathway (PP) because they perforate the gray matter of the subicular
  cortex (SC) on their way to the hippocampal formation. (5) A contingent of fascicles
  enters the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) of the CA1/subicular zone (CA1) and
  terminates on pyramidal cell dendrites. (6) More fascicles cross the hippocampal
  fissure (HF) (7) to enter the molecular layer (ML) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and
  terminate on distal dendrites of granule cells in the outer two-thirds of this molecular
  layer. Based on information contained in [] with permission from John Wiley and
