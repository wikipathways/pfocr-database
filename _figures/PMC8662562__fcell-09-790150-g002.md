caption: Oncolytic viruses can induce host systemic anti-tumor immunity to kill tumor
  cells. Following viral infection, viral replication leads to ER stress and genotoxic
  stress in tumor cells, which results in the release of the viral elements TAAs,
  PAMPs, and DAMPs. Sensing elements, such as PRRs, can recognize these molecules,
  which leads to immune cell activation and inflammatory signal transduction. With
  virus replication, antiviral pathways can be activated. This activation induces
  the production of cytokines and type I IFNs, which mediate the activation and maturation
  of immune cells, such as DCs and NK cells. NK cells migrate to the tumor area under
  the action of chemokines, such as IL-12, IL-2, and IFN-α/β, and exert antitumoral
  properties by releasing IFN-γ, TNF-α and CD107. Mature DCs can present antigenic
  peptides within the context of MHC I molecules to CD4+ T cells and within the context
  of MHC II molecules to CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells are also activated through the
  stimulation of CD4+ T cells. The activation of CD4+ T cells by DCs helps to activate
  CD8+ T cells by inducing the production of cytokines such as IL‐2. The recognition
  of tumor surface antigens by antibodies can trigger CTL killing of tumor cells through
  Fas-FasL interactions, TNF‐TNFR signaling, and the perforin/granzyme pathway.
