caption: Fig. 4. The Wnt/Wg signalling cascade. In unstimulated cells, APC shuttles
  β-catenin from the nucleus (; ) to a so-called ‘destruction complex’ in the cytoplasm,
  comprising axin/conductin and the serine (S)/threonine (T) kinases CKIα (casein
  kinase Iα) and GSK3. CKIα phosphorylation of β-catenin on S45 primes the subsequent
  sequential phosphorylation of T41, S37 and S33 residues by GSK3 (; ; ; ). Phospho-S33
  and -S37 residues are recognized by the F-box protein β-TrCP, which comprises part
  of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (; ; ; ). Ubiquitylation of β-catenin induces
  its rapid degradation by the proteasome (). At low levels of free β-catenin, Tcfs
  bind Groucho proteins (Grgs), and repress transcription (; ). Wnt/Wg proteins constitute
  a large family of secreted cysteine-rich glycoproteins that function as ligands
  for members of the Frizzled (Fz) family of serpentine receptors () and the low density
  lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6). The canonical Wnt signalling
  pathway is only activated when Wnt binds the extracellular domains of both proteins
  (). This results in inhibition of GSK3 by Dishevelled (Dvl) () and also in sequestration
  of axin by LRP5/6 (). Consequently, β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated and can
  accumulate in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where in partnership with Tcfs it activates
  target gene expression (; ; ; ).
