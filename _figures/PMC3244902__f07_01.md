caption: Post-transcriptional regulation of the shikimate pathway and aromatic amino
  acid metabolism. Key enzymes and metabolites are shown. Known allosteric regulation
  by compounds within the pathway is shown, activation with a green arrow, inhibition
  with a red line and bar, and putative allosteric inhibition with a dashed red line.
  DAHPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase; ASa, anthranilate synthase
  alpha subunit; CM, chorismate mutase; PDT, prephenate dehydratase ; ADT, arogenate
  dehydratase; TyrA, arogenate dehydrogenase.
