caption: The networks of these identified proteins mapping to the canonical pathways
  from Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems) library were employed
  for the analysis of protein molecules with up- and down-regulation between normal
  and diseased patients. These identified up- and down-regulated proteins displayed
  in red and green, respectively and with different shapes to indicate different functions
  were classified to build the derived signaling networks. The gray arrows with solid
  and dashed lines indicate the direct and indirect interrelationships, respectively
  between molecules. Proteins, which were not in our identified category but present
  in canonical pathway database based on their functional annotation, were displayed
  in white color and recruited to establish the possible molecular interaction. All
  drawn arrows were cited and supported by at least one reference from the literature,
  textbooks, or canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base.
