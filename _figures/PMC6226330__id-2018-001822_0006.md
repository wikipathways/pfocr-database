caption: 2-F-PABA is an alternative substrate for tetrahydrofolate (THF) biosynthesis.
  PABA and F-PABA are substrates for dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) in the THF biosynthesis
  pathway (only the terminal portion of the pathway is shown). The incorporation of
  PABA and PABA analogs F-PABA and PAS into dihydropteroate was quantified using a
  coupled assay that omitted DHFS from the reaction mixture and instead involved the
  direct reduction of dihydropteroate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
