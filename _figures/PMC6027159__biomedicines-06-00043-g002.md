caption: The canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB activation. On the left
  is presented the canonical pathway which involves phosphorylation of IκBs by IKK
  to induce their degradation. On the right is presented the non-canonical pathway
  which is dependent on NIK stabilization and IKK1 activation. In each case specific
  NF-κB dimers are induced that regulates different classes of genes participating
  in various biological processes. Steps that are controlled by ubiquitination processes
  are indicated by “Ub”. See text for details.
