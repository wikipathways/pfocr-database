caption: 'ILs with dual functions. This figure illustrates the mechanisms by which
  various IL families with dual functions influence AKI. (A) IL-1 family: Signaling
  pathways involving IL-33, highlighting its relationship to IL-1RacP and ST2 receptors,
  leading to activation of MYD88, IRAK4, and TRAF. (B) IL-2 family: Signaling pathways
  of IL-4 and IL-9 through their interactions with IL-4Rα and IL-9Rα receptors, respectively,
  leading to activation of JAK1/JAK3 and downstream STAT5/STAT6 pathways. (C) IL-10
  family: Signaling pathway of IL-22 through its interaction with IL-22R1 and IL-10R2
  receptors, leading to JAK1/TYK2 activation and downstream STAT1/STAT3/STAT5 pathways.
  (D) IL-6 family: Signaling pathways of IL-6, IL-11, and sIL-6R, showing their interactions
  with gp130 and IL-6R receptors, leading to activation of JAK/STAT3 pathways. (E)
  Overview of dual functions: The aforementioned cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-9,
  IL-11, IL-22, and IL-33 exert dual effects on the regulation of kidney injury. Figure
