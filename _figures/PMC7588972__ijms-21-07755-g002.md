caption: The simplified network of TFs and Mediator complex in regulating the abiotic
  stress responses. In response to cold stress, CBF1 activates the expression of COR
  genes through MED2, MED14, and MED16, which are required for the recruitment of
  RNA Pol II to the promoters of COR genes; In response to drought stress, CDK8 physically
  interact with WIN1 and RAP2.6 to positively regulate the cuticle wax biosynthesis
  and expression of stress-responsive genes; in contrast, MED25 negatively regulates
  the transcriptional activity of DREB2A and the expression of stress-responsive genes,
  thereby negatively contributing to the drought tolerance; in response to salt stress,
  ZFHD1 and MYB-like interact with MED25 to positively regulate the salt response.
