caption: Hh signaling pathway transduction. a In the absence of Hh ligands, PTCH is
  located in the primary cilium and suppresses SMO activation by preventing SMO localization
  to and accumulation in the cilium. The GLI transcription factors are phosphorylated
  and processed into transcriptional repressors (GLI R) by several protein mediators
  (PKA, CK1, and GSK3β). GLI R translocates into the nucleus and inhibits transcription.
  b When an Hh ligand binds to PTCH, the inhibition of SMO is relieved, allowing dissociation
  of GLI transcription factors from KIF7 and SUFU. Transcriptional activators (GLI1/2
  A) then enter the nucleus to induce expression of Hh target genes. Figure created
