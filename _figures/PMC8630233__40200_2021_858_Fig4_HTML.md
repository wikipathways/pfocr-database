caption: BA synthesis and signalling pathway. BAs are produced in perivenous hepatocytes
  primarily from the hydroxylation of cholesterol. Before being secreted for storage
  in the gallbladder, primary BAs are conjugated to glycine further enhancing their
  hydrophilicity. Entero-hepatic circulation enables 95% of BAs to be reabsorbed from
  the distal ileum, allowing time for the interaction of gut microbiota and primary
  BAs. Gut microbiota convert host-derived primary BAs into secondary BAs. Primary
  BAs bind to the FXR receptor, secondary BAs bind to the TGR5 receptor. FXR signaling
  can decrease gluconeogenesis, promote glycogen production and enhance the secretion
  of gut-derived hormones such as FGF-19. FGF-19 has the ability to regulate BA synthesis,
  lipid and glucose metabolism. TGR5 receptor activation results in GLP-1 secretion
  from intestinal L-cells. FXR signaling inhibits GLP-1. BA-TGR5 and BA-FXR receptor
  signaling stimulates insulin production from pancreatic β-cells
