caption: A hypothetical diagram of possible sites of action of non-opioids in the
  regulatory pathway of MMPs. TNF-α and IL-1 activates the MAPKs ERK1/2, p38, and
  JNK, which results in phosphorylation of the components of AP-1, and the upregulation
  of MMPs. Activation of MAPKs also may result in upregulation of secondary mediators
  such as, IL-6 or PGE2. IL-6 via the JAK/STAT pathway may upregulate MMPs. PGE2via
  EP4 receptors activates adenylyl cyclase leading to the formation of cAMP that interfere
  with the activation of ERK. NFκB is also involved in the regulation of MMPs expression.
  Non-opioids interfere with synthesis of PGE2, the degradation of c-AMP and also
  regulate various cytokines. They regulate AP-1, NFκB and MAPKs. It should be noted
  that non-opioids have different effects on these targets in different cells and
  under different experimental conditions
