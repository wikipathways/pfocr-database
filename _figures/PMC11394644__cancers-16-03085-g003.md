caption: Summary reaction schemes depicting the influence NAD+ biosynthesis pathway
  reactions on the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME often consists of (A) cancer
  cells, (B) T cells, and (C) cancer-associated fibroblasts. The interaction between
  NAD+-consuming enzymes and different cell types in the TME regulates various processes
  including tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis in gynecologic cancers. Thus,
  the way NAD+ levels are maintained, in addition to the activity of the biosynthesis
  pathways, will trigger various processes in the context of the gynecological cancer
  tumor environments. Note. “↑” indicates “increase in expression” and “↓” indicates
  “decrease in expression levels”. Created with BioRender.com accessed 22 August 2024
