caption: M-MDSCs differentiate into PMN-MDSCs in tumor-bearing hosts. Soluble mediators
  produced in the tumor microenvironment promote the aberrant differentiation of MDSCs.
  Dashed lines indicate the normal developmental pathway of immature myeloid precursor
  cells, which differentiate into DCs, monocytes-macrophages and granulocytes (basophils,
  eosinophils and neutrophils) in non-tumor-bearing hosts. Solid lines indicate the
  aberrant pathways of myeloid cell development in tumor-bearing hosts. New data (thick
  red line) suggest that a large proportion of PMN-MDSCs emerge from the M-MDSC pool.
  HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage.
