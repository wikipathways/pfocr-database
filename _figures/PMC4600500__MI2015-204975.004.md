caption: Interactomic analysis by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of significant
  molecules. The interactome shows the close functional association between significant
  cytokines (indicated with green symbols) as well as the paths in which other functionally
  relevant molecules are also involved (indicated with white symbols). In detail,
  the cytokines reported are CXCL8 (C-X-C motif ligand 8), CCL2 (C-C motif ligand
  2), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), IFNG (interferon gamma), CXCL10 (C-X-C
  motif ligand 10), and TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha). Moreover, three HUB nodes
  such as ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1), NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), and RELA (v-rel
  avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A) subunits are indicated by
  cyan symbols.
