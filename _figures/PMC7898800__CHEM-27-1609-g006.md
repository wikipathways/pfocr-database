caption: 'Proposed hydrogenation–condensation–hydrogenation pathway regarding the
  reductive alkylation of nitriles with carbonyl compounds (top). Mechanistic investigations (bottom).
  Reaction conditions: 5.0 mol % Co (37 mg catalyst, 4.0 wt % Co, 0.025 mmol Co, 1.47 mg
  Co), 0.5 mmol benzonitrile, 1.5 mmol 4‐methylbenzaldehyde, 3 mL 2‐methyltetrahydrofuran,
  80 °C, 1.5 MPa H2, 16 h. Under these conditions, products and intermediates are
  obtained in the yields given. These yields were determined by gas chromatography
  using n‐dodecane as an internal standard.'
