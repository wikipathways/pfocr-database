caption: 'The bacterium oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde that is condensed with a
  tetrahydromethanopterin and further oxidized to formate. Formate reacts with tetrahydropterin
  and formyl-tetrahydrofolate is further converted to methylenetetrahydrofolate (part
  1 of metabolism). The serine cycle is used for the assimilation of formaldehyde
  plus bicarbonate (part 2). Acetyl-CoA assimilation and conversion to glyoxylate
  proceeds via the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (part 3). The main biosynthetic outputs
  from these pathways are indicated. Enzymes: 1, serine hydroxymethyl transferase;
  2, serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase; 3, hydroxypyruvate reductase; 4, glycerate
  kinase; 5, enolase; 6, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; 7, malate dehydrogenase;
  8, malate-CoA ligase (malate thiokinase); 9, L-malyl-CoA/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase;
  10, β-ketothiolase; 11, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; 12, crotonase (R-specific); 13,
  crotonyl-CoA carboxylase reductase; 14, ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase;

  hydratase; 18, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 19, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; 20, methanol
