caption: A working model outlining the proposed mechanism. Elevation of endogenous
  n-3 PUFAs and their derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) via jugular
  vein injection of AAV9-Fat-1 in hamsters. n-3 PUFAs act as signaling molecules and
  activate the hepatic PPARα signaling pathway by increasing its nuclear localization
  to facilitate PPARα entry into the nucleus, which enhances fatty acid oxidation
  and inhibits lipid de novo synthesis and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/cPLA2-mediated
  inflammatory pathways, ultimately mitigating hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and atherosclerosis.
  HDHA, hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid; 19,20-EDP, 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid;
