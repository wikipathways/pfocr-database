caption: 'Hedgehog (Hh) signaling.Notes: Normal activation of the signaling pathway
  results from the binding of Hh ligand to the 12-transmembrane patched 1 (PTCH1).
  As represented in the left half of the figure (demarcated by the jagged orange line),
  the absence of the Hh ligand allows PTCH1 to repress the activity of the seven-transmembrane
  G protein coupled receptor-like receptor smoothened homolog (SMO) which is located
  in intracellular endosomes. Under this state, the GLI transcription factors GLI2
  and GLI3 form a complex with the regulatory suppressor of fused (SUFU) protein,
  which is then either degraded by the proteasome or processed into repressor forms
  that cannot activate target gene transcription. SUFU also acts to sequester GLI1,
  which is constitutively active and does not contain repressor domain. When Hh ligand
  is available as represented in the right half of the figure, PTCH1 exits out of
  the primary cilium and permits SMO to translocate to the plasma membrane, concentrating
  in the cilia of some cell types. Activated SMO suppresses SUFU function, which renders
  the GLIs stable and active, such as by reduction of repressor forms. In the nucleus,
  activated GLI permits the target gene expression, such as CCND1, PTCH1, and GLI1.
  Type I Hh signaling is ligand-independent aberrant activation, such as by functional
  inactivation of PTCH1 through mutations resulting in constitutive activation of
  SMO and downstream GLI-mediated transcription of genes. Drugs inhibiting SMO are
  shown in the text boxes.Abbreviations: GLI-R, GLI2 and GLI3 repressor forms; GLI-A,
  GLI2 and GLI3 transcriptional activators; Hh, Hedgehog; NanoHHI, polymeric nanoparticle
  formulation of Hh pathway inhibitor-1; PTCH1, patched 1; SMO, smoothened; SUFU,
  suppressor of fused.'
