caption: Regulation of Gq- and Gi-coupled receptor signaling by caveolin-1 in gastric
  smooth muscle. Caveolin-1 facilitates Gq/PLC-β1- and RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent pathways
  that lead to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent stimulation of myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK) activity and inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity,
  respectively, and increase in MLC20 phosphorylation, an essential step in muscle
  contraction. Loci of interaction of caveolin-1 with the signaling molecules in the
  pathways distal to the receptor were not identified in the present study. Previous
  studies have shown that caveolae/caveolin-1 interacts with several molecules in
  the pathway, including Gαq, PLC-β, RhoA, and Rho kinase. Caveolin-1 had no effect
  on Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity.
