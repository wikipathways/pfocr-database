caption: Schematic diagram of the linear in silico activation pathway of CD8+ T cells.
  A naïve CD8+ T cell becomes pre-activated when it contacts an APC. The pre-activated
  T cell evolves to an activated cell when its IL-2•IL-2R complex exceeds a threshold.
  The activated T cell breaks contact with APC and enters cell cycle. At the end of
  an activated T cell’s division, the daughter cells can differentiate into effector
  phenotype if their T-bet level exceeds a threshold. Effector T cells keep proliferating
  leading to the population expansion. The apoptosis of activated and effector T cells
  involves the generation of cleaved Caspases (above a threshold), which are induced
  by Fas-FasL signaling
