caption: Interplay between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p16/p14
  regulated pathways. ERK signaling is regulated by extracellular signals binding
  to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activated RTKs promote RAS-mediated dimerization
  of RAF; RAF dimers phosphorylate and activate MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylate
  and activate ERK1/2. Activated ERK promotes proliferation, e.g., by activation of
  the Cyclin D and CDK4/6 complex that inhibits the tumor suppressor RB1. P16 prevents
  proliferation by negatively regulating Cyclin D1/CDK4 function. In BRAF-mutated
  cells, BRAFV600E is constitutively active as a monomer, leading to high ERK signaling.
  BRAF and MEK blockade effectively inhibit ERK signaling. However, dysregulation
  of the p16/RB1 pathway may sustain tumor growth regardless of BRAF/MEK inhibition
  and may confer resistance to treatment. Another mechanism of resistance to BRAF/MEK
  inhibition is through activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway that promotes cell survival
  and proliferation, e.g., by the activation of MDM2 protein which inhibits the tumor
  suppressor p53. P14 prevents such proliferation by negatively regulating MDM2.
