caption: Schematic representation of the RIM101 signaling pathway and its potential
  involvement in S. cerevisiae mating. The fungal-specific RIM101 signaling pathway
  is based on the proteolytic processing of the Rim101 transcription factor. The integral
  membrane proteins Rim21, Dfg6 and Rim9 constitute a surface response complex that
  recruits the arrestin-like Rim8 at the plasma membrane. Downstream ESCRT proteins
  Stp22, Vsp24 and Snf7 are recruited in a Rim8-dependent manner to constitute a platform
  on which the proteolytic complex (Ygr122w, Rim20 and Rim13) forms. The calpain-like
  cysteine protease Rim13 then cleaves Rim101, inducing its nuclear localization and
  cellular transcriptional response. We propose that Rim101 targets include genes
  responsible for the sexual agglutination response among other genes that mediate
  mating. Apart from SNF7 and STP22, which were not present in our gene deletion library
  screen, all genes in the RIM101 pathway were found to be required for the creeping
  phenotype (Fig. ; Table S3, Supporting Information). Adapted from Ost et al. ().
