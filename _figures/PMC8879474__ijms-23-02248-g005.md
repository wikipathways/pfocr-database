caption: Role of intra/extracellular TG2 and mTG within CD pathogenesis. Gliadin peptides
  are resistant to enzymatic and non-enzymatic digestion and reach the intestinal
  lamina propria by trans- and paracellular routes. Enzymatic modification of gliadin
  peptides by TG2 increases their antigenicity and is a prerequisite for MHC class
  II mediated antigen presentation resulting in T and B cell activation. mTG used
  in food production can de- and/or transamidate gliadin peptides and create neo-epitopes,
  whereas active mTG released from the intestinal microbiota could modify peptides
  within the gut lumen. At the intracellular pathway, gliadin peptides reach the ER
  by phagosome-to-cytosol pathway. Within the ER, deamidation of gliadin peptides
  by active TG2 and mTG might occur, an effect that could be reduced via inhibition
  of TG2 (but not of mTG) by ERp57. The corresponding deamidated peptides might serve
  as substrate for MHC class I mediated immunogenic cross presentation ending up by
  the action of intraepithelial lymphocytes in villous atrophy, whereas native peptides
  could potentially induce tolerance via cross presentation.
