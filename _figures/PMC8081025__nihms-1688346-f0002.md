caption: 'Models illustrating the roles of CST in genome stability maintenance.(A)
  CST regulates telomere stability via the telomeric synthesis processes. In the ds
  telomeric region, CST resolves G4 structures and relieves replication stress in
  the telomeric region. At telomere ends, CST binds to ss G-overhangs to inhibit the
  access of telomerase to telomeres. CST also mediates C-strand fill-in to replenish
  C-strands.(B) CST regulates DNA replication initiation under normal replication
  condition. In the G1 phase, CST blocks origin licensing by interacting with MCM
  to prevent CDT1 interacting with MCM. In the S phase, CST interacts with AND-1 and
  POLα and then facilitates replisome assembly and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis.(C)
  CST protects reversed fork stability under replication stress. Top: CST directly
  binds to the regressed arms of reversed forks to inhibit unscheduled MRE11 degradation
  of nascent strand DNA. In addition, CST indirectly protects reversed forks via recruiting
  RAD51 (bottom). (D) CST regulates the ATR-CHK1 pathway under replication stress.
  CST prevents the degradation of the ATR activator TOPBP1. CST deficiency decreases
  TOPBP1 protein level, therefore suppressing CHK1 phosphorylation following replication
  stress.(E) CST controls end-resection during DSB repair and favors c-NHEJ. At DSB
  sites, 53BP1-RIF1 recruits the Shieldin complex (SHLD1-SHLD2-SHLD3-REV7), which
  interacts with and recruits CST to DSB ends to counteract end resection.'
