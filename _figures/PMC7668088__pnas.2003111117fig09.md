caption: Conceptual model of OR2W3-evoked ASM relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation
  of the odorant receptor OR2W3, a GPCR expressed on human ASM cells causes Ca2+ release
  through PLCβ-IP3 signaling leading to decline in Ca2+ in the intracellular store
  [endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, ER/SR]. The reduction in ER Ca2+ initiates extracellular
  calcium influx through the SOCE pathway via activation of Stim1 and its subsequent
  physical interactions with Orai1 at the discrete cellular microdomains. Ca2+ flux
  through store-operated calcium channels leads to plasma membrane depolarization
  and is potentiated by a cooperative activation of TMEM16A and CFTR localized at
  the same junction between plasma membrane and the ER/SR. The action of the latter
  causes Cl− uptake into the SR, facilitating Ca2+ sequestration that results in a
  decrease in cytosolic calcium concentration promoting ASM relaxation.

  description: Conceptual model of OR2W3-evoked ASM relaxation and bronchodilation.
    Activation of the odorant receptor OR2W3, a GPCR expressed on human ASM cells
    causes Ca2+ release through PLCβ-IP3 signaling leading to decline in Ca2+ in the
    intracellular store [endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, ER/SR]. The reduction in ER
    Ca2+ initiates extracellular calcium influx through the SOCE pathway via activation
    of Stim1 and its subsequent physical interactions with Orai1 at the discrete cellular
    microdomains. Ca2+ flux through store-operated calcium channels leads to plasma
    membrane depolarization and is potentiated by a cooperative activation of TMEM16A
    and CFTR localized at the same junction between plasma membrane and the ER/SR.
    The action of the latter causes Cl− uptake into the SR, facilitating Ca2+ sequestration
    that results in a decrease in cytosolic calcium concentration promoting ASM relaxation.
