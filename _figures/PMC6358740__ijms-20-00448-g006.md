caption: 'The intracellular signaling pathways induced by Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis
  virus: Detection of dsRNA by TLR3 and ssRNA by TLR7 in endosomes leads to the recruitment
  of TRIF and MyD88, which interact with TRAF3 and TRAF6 to trigger MAPK, NF-κB, and
  IRF signaling. This results in transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1,
  IL6, and TNFα as well as antiviral IFNα/β. Viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm is recognized
  by MDA5, which activates IPS-1 to initiate IRF signaling via TRAF3. Moreover, MDA5
  triggers NF-κB signaling via TRADD and FADD as well as caspase-8. NF-κB signaling
  can also be induced by PKR, which is activated by binding to cytoplasmic dsRNA.
  In addition, PKR phosphorylates eIF2α to inhibit mRNA and viral RNA translation
  and thus virus replication. Finally, caspase-8 can cleave the inhibitory N-terminus
  of PKR to activate this antiviral protein, whose expression is stimulated by IFNα/β.
  Only selected pathway members are shown due to simplification. Solid arrows indicate
  activation while “T” indicates inhibition.'
