caption: Induction of HSR by HSF1. Various factors including environmental, non-stress
  and pathological conditions can trigger HSP expression via HSF1 pathway. In non-activated
  state, HSF1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm due to its binding to chaperone complex
  including HSP70 and HSP90, thus prevented from performing its transcriptional activity.
  Upon activation, the chaperone complex dissociates and HSF1 is liberated, homotrimerizes
  and translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the HSF1 homotrimer binds to the
  heat shock elements (HSEs) that are located upstream to heat shock gene promotors
  to initiate the transcription of its target genes including HSP genes.
