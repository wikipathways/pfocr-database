caption: TLR signaling and proposed model for DMF-mediated impairment of DC maturation.
  All TLR signaling (except TLR3) events recruit the adaptor MyD88, followed by the
  interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family of protein kinases, leading
  to TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) activation followed by NF-κB activation.
  In addition to MyD88-dependent pathway, MyD88-independent (TIR domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent) pathway is utilized in TLR3/4 signaling.
  TLR3/4 recruit the adaptor TRIF, which can subsequently lead to activation of interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 then translocates into the nucleus and transcribes
  target genes, e.g. TNF-α. TNF-α binds to the TNF receptor and induces delayed NF-κB
  activation. In our study, we show that DMF suppresses p65 phosphorylation and nuclear
  localization (Point 1). p65 activation is further reduced by DMF-mediated MSK1 reduction
  (Point 2), which results in decreased phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276 (Point
  3) and histone-3 at serine 10 (Point 4). IKKϵ, IκB kinase ϵ. TAK1, TGF-β activated
  kinase-1, TBK1, TANK-binding kinase-1.
