caption: LPS-TLR4 mediated signal transduction pathway. A In the MyD88-dependent signaling
  pathway, LPS stimulation triggers TLR4-MD-2 complex recruitment of MyD88 and TIRAP
  through its TIR domain, forming a signaling platform. This platform subsequently
  recruits IRAKs, TRAF6, TABs, and TAK1, completing the signal transduction cascade
  that activates AP-1 and NF-κB, leading to macrophage M1 polarization and subsequent
  inflammatory factor release. B In the MyD88-independent pathway, LPS stimulation
  induces TLR4-MD-2 complex endocytosis mediated by the CD14-ITAM-Syk-PLCγ2 complex
  and calcium influx, forming an endosome. This endosome recruits TRAM, TRIF, TRAF3,
  TANK, IKBKG, IKBKE, and TBK1, completing the signal transduction cascade that activates
  NF-κB and IRFs, ultimately mediating type-I IFN production
