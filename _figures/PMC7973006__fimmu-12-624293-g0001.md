caption: (A) In stationary state, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is part of a
  complex composed by the 90kDa heat shock protein (HSP90), the co-chaperone p23 (p23)
  and the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein (XAP2/AIP/ARA9). The complex stabilizes
  AHR conformation, protects AHR from proteolitic degradation and contributes to its
  subcellular localization. The ligand (L) binding triggers a conformational change
  in AHR exposing a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Then, XAP2 is released from
  the complex and the L-AHR-HSP90-p23 structure translocates into the nucleus via
  β-importins. Inside the nucleus, the chaperones are released from the complex and
  return to the cytoplasm whilst the AHR-L structure heterodimerizes with the aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), interacts with its DNA- response-elements
  -xenobiotics response element (XRE)- and regulates the expression of different genes.
  The AHR canonical signaling pathway is characterized by the expression of CYP1A1,
  CYP1B1, CYP2A1, TIPARP and AHRR. Following the modulation of its target genes, the
  ARNT-AHR-L complex exits the nucleus and is targeted for proteasomal degradation.
  (B) The AHR non-canonical signaling pathway involves the regulation of cytoplasmic
  proteins as well as the control of gene expression. Within the cytoplasm, the AHR-L
  complex can function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting the proteasomal degradation
  of target proteins. It also increases the intracellular Ca2+ levels and interacts
  with different proteins such as PKA, NFκB and Src1. Once in the nucleus, AHR-L is
  capable of interacting and controlling the activity of other transcription factors
  (Tf) through transactivation/transrepression or it can exert a Co-activator/Co-Inhibitor
  role when it is associated with ARNT.
