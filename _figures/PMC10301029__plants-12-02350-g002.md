caption: Overlap between the tyrosine kinase pathway, Wnt/β-catenin, and prostaglandin
  inflammation pathways. The first point of overlap is the Cox protein, which is activated
  through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, then the resulting prostaglandins, which
  activate the EP4 transmembrane receptor, which in turn can activate the AKT pathway
  leading to the transactivation of the PPARδ transcription factor. The expression
  of PPARδ is activated by the Wnt signaling pathway. This transcription factor promotes
  survival by inhibiting apoptosis
