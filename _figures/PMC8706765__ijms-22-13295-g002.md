caption: Podocyte–endothelial crosstalk and its potential connection with GR signalling.
  Figure shows podocyte and endothelial cell with glomerular base membrane between
  them. Podocytes produce VEGF, angiopoietins, semaphorins and SDF-1 which are secreted
  and influence endothelial cells homeostasis. ECs might secrete APC which protects
  podocytes against apoptosis. GR stimulation might impair VEGF signalling and influence
  podocyte Wnt/β catenin pathway and promote FAO. Lack of GR stimulation in podocytes
  might damage ECs through unknown mediator. APC—activated protein C, EC—endothelial
  cell, FAO—fatty acid oxidation, GBM—glomerular base membrane, SDF-1—Stromal cell-derived
  factor 1 VEGF—vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF-R—vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor, Wnt—Wnt signalling pathway.
