caption: Graphical presentation of acetylation mediated regulation of p53 tumor suppressive
  functions, as revealed in mouse models.Wild type p53 retains all tumor suppressive
  functions; 1KR is unable to induce apoptosis; 3KR is defective in apoptosis and
  cell cycle arrest; 4KR is not capable of undergoing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest
  and ferroptosis; 5KR further loses the ability to repress mTOR pathway.
