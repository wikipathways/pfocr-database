caption: 'Schematic model illustrating how IGFBP-3 proteins regulate the TNF-α and
  apoptosis pathway in REC: Right. IGFBP-3 proteins transcriptionally activate c-Jun/TIMP-3
  expression, which is responsible for TACE inhibition. The absence of JunB and c-Jun
  leads to an increase in TACE activity, followed by increased levels of TNF-α; Left.
  IGFBP-3 decreases TNFR-2 levels, which signals through LRP1, inhibiting TRADD and
  caspase 8 and REC apoptosis.'
