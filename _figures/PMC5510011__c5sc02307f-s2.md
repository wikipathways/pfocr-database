caption: and  summarize the proposed catalytic cycle for the process with a monodentate
  ligand, namely triphenylphosphine, calculated using 6-31G**/B3LYP-D3 density functional
  theory (see the ESI for full computational details). Following the binding of the
  1,6-enyne 1 to afford intermediate 5, oxidative addition traversing the transition
  state 5-TS at 11.5 kcal mol–1 generates the rhodacyclopentene 6, which is 10.1 kcal
  mol–1 lower in solution phase Gibbs free energy than the reactant complex 5. A second
  pathway was also considered, where prior to oxidative addition, one of the phosphine
  ligands dissociates from 5 and is replaced by an alkyne molecule to afford an alternative
  reactant complex 7. However, this substitution process is unfavorable by 17.7 kcal
  mol–1 (), however, and renders intermediate 7 higher in energy than the transition
  state 5-TS, disqualifying any reaction pathway that may be considered from 7. For
  example, the oxidative coupling of the tethered ene–yne moiety to form a rhodacycle
  that is equivalent to 6 from 7 requires an additional 18.3 kcal mol–1 in activation
  energy.
