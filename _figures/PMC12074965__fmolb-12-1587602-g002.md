caption: 'Glucose And UDP-Galactose Are Metabolised In The Golgi Of Mammary Epithelial
  Cells (MECs) For Lactose Synthesis: Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) facilitates the transport
  of glycerol (Glyc) across the plasma membrane, where glycerol kinase (GK) phosphorylates
  it to glycerol-3-phosphate (Glyc-P), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD)
  converts it to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP). The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  branches from glucose metabolism, contributing to nucleotide synthesis and reducing
  power. Glucose (Glu) is taken up into the cytoplasm via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)
  and sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1), while galactose (Gal) is transported
  by GLUT1. Inside the cytoplasm, hexokinase (HK) phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glu-6-P), which is then converted to glucose-1-phosphate (Glu-1-P) by phosphoglucomutase
  1 (PGM1). UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) synthesizes UDP-glucose (UDP-Glu)
  from glucose-1-phosphate, and UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase (GALE) converts UDP-glucose
  to UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). Simultaneously, galactose is phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate
  (Gal-1-P) by galactokinase 1 (GALK1). galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
  (G1PUT) then converts galactose-1-phosphate into UDP-galactose. The solute carrier
  family 35 member A2 (SLC35A2) transports UDP-galactose into the Golgi apparatus,
  where glucose and UDP-galactose are combined by lactose synthase to produce lactose'
