caption: The biological activities of TACI. TACI inhibits B cell proliferation by
  promoting the sustained expression of Blimp-1. Blimp-1 induces cell cycle arrest
  in B cells, promoting the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (1). TACI
  inhibits GC reactions and B cell proliferation by suppressing the expression of
  ICOSL on GC B cells (2). TACI upregulates the expression of cIAP in GC B cells.
  cIAP targets NIK for degradation by ubiquitylation, thereby inhibiting the BR3-mediated
  noncanonical NF-κB pathway (3). TACI and TLR4 signalling cooperate to trigger MZ
  B cells to apoptosis by induction of Fas and FasL (4). TACI competes with BR3 for
  BAFF, which also downregulates the BAFF concentration (5). TACI inhibits plasma
  cell apoptosis by downregulating BIM expression in plasma cells (6). TACI mediates
  CSR by binding to MyD88 (7).
