caption: Scheme of the proposed lung IIR against S. pneumoniae in WT, MyD88–/– and
  TLR4–/– mice. (A) After infection of WT mice, TLR2 and TLR4 recognizes different
  PAMPs from S. pneumoniae activating the TRIF- and MyD88-dependent transduction pathways.
  After the initial bacterial encounter with AM cells, CXCL1 (1) is released that
  favors the early recruitment and activation of Nϕ cells, leading to substantial
  ROS production. (2) Differentiation of activated monocytes to moDCs and moMϕ helps
  to amplify the inflammatory response (3) through the secretion of a broad spectrum
  of cytokines and ROS production. (B) Infected MyD88–/– mice can still signal through
  the TLR4-TRIF-dependent pathway, leading to a weak IIR response while maintaining
  an inflammatory cytokine environment. (C) TLR4–/– infected mice experience impaired
  Nϕ recruitment and almost a complete blockade of monocyte differentiation, which
  leads to a very poor cytokine response and the development of a more intense bacterial
  burden.
