caption: Mechanisms of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination. Transcription through
  S regions (that are G-rich on the non-template strand) generates RNA:DNA hybrid
  structures such as R-loops in which the RNA (orange line) hybridizes stably to the
  template strand, looping out the non-template strand as single-stranded DNA (step
  1). AID deaminates cytidines to uridines on single-strand DNA (step 2). The DNA-glycosylase,
  UNG, removes uracil bases from DNA to create abasic sites that are subsequently
  processed by APE1 to generate nicks. Mismatch-repair proteins can also process deaminated
  residues, and generate nicks and gaps in the DNA. Closely spaced nicks on opposite
  strands generate DSBs (step 3). The mechanism that deaminates the template strand
  is not well understood. DSBs on two S regions are synapsed and joined both by components
  of the classical non-homologous end-joining proteins and by a robust microhomology-mediated
  alternative end-joining pathway (step 4). The activity of AID is regulated at several
  levels. AID phosphorylated at Ser 38 interacts with the single-strand DNA-binding
  replication protein A to promote CSR (step 5). MicroRNA 155 (miR-155) binds to the
  3′ untranslated region (UTR) of AID messenger RNA (mRNA) to regulate AID levels
  (step 6). Ikaros participates in regulating germline transcription of Sγ2b and Sγ2a
  (step 7). AID, activation-induced deaminase; APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease
  1; CSR, class-switch recombination; DSBs, double-strand breaks; IgH, immunoglobulin
  H; MMR, mismatch repair; NHEJ, non-homologous DNA end-joining; ORF, open reading
  frame; RPA, replication protein A; UNG, uracil-DNA glycosylase.
