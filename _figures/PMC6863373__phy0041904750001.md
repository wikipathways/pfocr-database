caption: A well-established pathway to skeletal muscle atrophy, involving MuRF1 and
  MAFbxWhen muscles are deprived of nutrients, external loading, or neural activity,
  or when muscles are exposed to excess glucocorticoids or advanced age, expression
  of the the E3 ubiquitin ligase genes, MuRF1 and MAFbx, increases. Increased transcription
  of MuRF1 and MAFbx is controlled, in part, by activation of Foxo transcription factors
  and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Increased expression of MuRF1 and MAFbx promotes
  muscle atrophy via biochemical mechanisms that are not yet well defined. In healthy
  young adult skeletal muscle, activity of Foxo transcription factors is inhibited
  by insulin/IGF-I/Akt signaling and a low level of glucocorticoids. Insulin/IGF-I
  signaling has dual roles in that it can inhibit muscle atrophy through inhibition
  of Foxo transcription factors and stimulate protein synthesis and skeletal muscle
  hypertrophy via Akt and mTORC1.
