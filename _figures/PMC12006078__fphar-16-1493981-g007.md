caption: The protective mechanisms of acacetin against endothelial injury in hypertension.
  Acacetin enhances endothelium-dependent vasodilation by preventing ROS-evoked mitochondrial
  dysfunction and endothelial cell apoptosis, while activating the Akt/eNOS pathway,
  thereby showing anti-hypertensive effects [adapted from Li et al. (2022)]. In addition,
  acacetin also has estrogen-like activity, activating estrogen receptor signaling
  to improve endothelial dysfunction and promote vasodilation, thus reducing hypertension
  in SHR with insulin resistance. DRP1, dynamin-related protein 1; OPA1, optic atrophy
  1; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; CypD, cyclophilin D; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore; ARG2, arginase 2
