caption: Regulatory mechanism of macrophages in unstable plaques. Insulin-like growth
  factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) deletion inhibits cholesterol outflow by suppressing
  the expression of TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-6 through ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway. In contrast,
  C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) promotes cholesterol outflow
  through PPAR-γ. The high expression of CTRP3 and CTRP9 can inhibit the macrophage
  inflammation through NFκB pathway. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) can
  activate ERK, p38 and JNK phosphorylation to inhibit macrophage inflammation. NLRP3
  inflammasomes induces inflammation by activating IL-1β and IL-18. Interferon-γ produced
  by Th1 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells activates the phosphorylation of JAK
  and STAT to promote inflammation. Leukotriene receptors (LTs-R) and its cofactor
  FLAP target FLAP/5-LO/Leukotriene pathway to inhibit inflammation. The tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor AG1296 suppresses inflammation by reducing the expression of MMP-2
  and MMP-9 via PDGF/PDGFR pathway.
