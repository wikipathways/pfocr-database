caption: Cross-regulatory pathways between focal adhesions and cadherins. Reciprocal
  regulation between focal adhesion proteins and cadherins occurs through different
  mechanochemical signals and is crucial to establish tensional homeostasis within
  cells. (A) A mechanosensory complex comprised of VE-cadherin, PECAM1 and VEGFR signals
  upstream of integrins to activate PI3K and Rac in response to shear flow. Conversely,
  actomyosin contractility drives integrin-dependent localization of VE-cadherin and
  p120-catenin to cell–cell junctions. Focal adhesion proteins linking integrins to
  F-actin are not shown. (B) Activation of the FAK–p130Cas–Rac signaling pathway at
  focal adhesions in response to substrate stiffness stimulates N-cadherin gene expression.
  Within adherens junctions, N-cadherin inhibits local PI3K and Rac activity. At adherens
  junctions, N-cadherin maintains α5 integrins in an inactive conformation to direct
  fibronectin matrix away from the junction. Focal adhesion proteins linking integrins
  to F-actin are not shown. (C) The coordinated effects described above in A and B
  regulate the spatial distribution of forces and signals to drive processes such
  as cell cycling, stem cell differentiation, fibronectin matrix assembly and collective
  cell migration.
