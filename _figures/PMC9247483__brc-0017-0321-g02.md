caption: Molecular mechanisms of mammary ductal epithelium interaction with the breast
  microenvironment. PRL promotes proinflammatory activity by activating the NF-κB
  pathway in mammary epithelial cells to trigger the secretion of cytokines, such
  as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and TNF-α, among which IL-6 binds to gp130 in plasma
  cells to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway followed by the upregulation of
  Bcl-2 (prolonged survival) and ICAM-1 (enhanced penetration and aggregation). Moreover,
  PRL promotes the secretion of TNF-α and IL-12 via NF-κB and IRF-1 in WBCs. In the
  presence of IL-6, B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which effectively forms
  a positive feedback loop of IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling, followed by local accumulation
  in the breast, while IL-6 from plasma cells promotes B-cell differentiation, and
  vice versa. In mammary ductal epithelium, SOCS2 binds to the growth hormone receptor
  phosphopeptide to cause its interaction with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which
  is inhibited by SOCS2 p.R96C point mutations that induce an uncontrolled inflammatory
  response. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is prominently upregulated in human
  PCM tissue with an unknown activator. Bacterial MDP specifically binds to NOD2 on
  mammary ductal epithelium and activates the NF-κB signaling pathway to produce chemokines
  and proinflammatory factors. PCM, plasma cell mastitis; PRL, serum prolactin; NF,
  nuclear factor; IL, interleukin; GM-CSF, colony-stimulating factor 2; TNF, tumor
  necrosis factor; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription;
  IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor 1; WBCs, white blood cells; SOCS2, suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 2; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; NOD2, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain containing 2; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; gp130, glycoprotein
  130.
