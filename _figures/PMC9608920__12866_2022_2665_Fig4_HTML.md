caption: The effects of SlpA extracted from C. difficile clinical strains on human
  colon carcinoma cell line HT-29. SlpA binds to its receptor, TLR-4, results in increased
  expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8
  in intestinal epithelial cells. SlpA from certain C. difficile RTs (SlpA purified
  from RT126) could significantly enhance IL-1β production in the gut, possibly through
  the bioprocessing of pro-IL-1β to its active form IL-1β following activation of
  the inflammasome pathway. Additionally, SlpA could distrupt tight junction and subsequently
  may increase intestinal permeability. RT, ribotype; TLR-4, toll-like receptor-4
