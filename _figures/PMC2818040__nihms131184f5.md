caption: Unanswered questions regarding the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5 (LRP5)—5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)—osteoblast pathway.1) What is the ligand
  for LRP5 within enterochromaffin cells?2) What is the molecular pathway between
  LRP5 and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) within enterochromaffin cells?3) Does LRP5-mediated
  5-HT synthesis by enterochromaffin cells have any local effects on the gastrointestinal
  (GI) tract?4) How are LRP5-mediated changes in circulating 5-HT levels transported
  to bone cells (i.e. is it sequestered in platelets or free within the plasma)?5)
  What effect does LRP5-mediated changes in circulating 5-HT levels have on other
  peripheral 5-HT sensitive systems, including heart valves and the pulmonary circulation?6)
  Does activation of the 5-HT1B receptor completely explain the skeletal effects of
  5-HT or are other 5-HT receptors involved depending on the prevailing conditions?7)
  Does 5-HT solely influence osteoblast proliferation or does it also influence differentiation
  depending on the prevailing conditions?8) Are there direct skeletal effects of LRP5
  under alternative conditions (i.e. at different stages within the osteoblastic lineage
  or during mechanical loading)?9) What is the role of the osteoblastic 5-HT transporter
  (5-HTT) in regulating the skeletal effects of gut-derived 5-HT?10) Does the LRP5-mediated
  change in circulating 5-HT levels influence the functional 5-HT pathways observed
  in osteoclasts?
