caption: Diagram depicting the ISC pathway in yeast mitochondria highlighting the
  central role of Grx5 and the proposed roles of Bol1/Bol3 proteins. A [2Fe-2S] cluster
  is assembled on the scaffold protein Isu1 by the early ISC machinery, which is then
  delivered to the intermediate carrier protein Grx5. The chaperone/co-chaperone complex
  Jac1/Ssq1 is proposed to assist in release of the cluster from Isu1. Grx5 may deliver
  [2Fe-2S] clusters to apo targets in the mitochondria and is also required for formation
  of an unidentified sulfur-containing species (X-S) that exported to the cytosol.
  X-S is used by the CIA machinery for nuclear/cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly and
  is required to relay the cellular iron status to iron-responsive transcription factors
  in the nucleus. In addition, Grx5 interacts with and transfers [2Fe-2S] clusters
  to the late ISC machinery, a complex composed of Isa1, Isa2, and Iba57, which then
  synthesizes [4Fe-4S] clusters via coupling of two [2Fe-2S] clusters. Nfu1, Ind1,
  Bol1, and Bol3 serve as targeting factors that interact with Grx5 and/or the late
  ISC machinery to deliver [4Fe-4S] clusters to specific apo acceptor proteins.
