caption: PGK1 involvement in drug resistance. A. Sustained drug treatment leads to
  tumor starvation and intratumoral hypoxia. B. P-glycoprotein encoded by MDR1 induces
  multidrug resistance through the ATP-dependent efflux of lipophilic anticancer drugs.
  C. PGK1 induces chemoresistance of cancer cells by upregulating autophagy. D. PGK1
  facilities chemoresistance by triggering HSP90/ERK pathway mediated DNA repair and
  methylation. E. PGK1 causes drug resistance by scavenging ROS and inhibiting ROS-stimulated
  apoptosis.
