caption: Schematic representation of low temperature signal transduction assembled
  from reviews published by  and . Protein TFs are represented by ovals while TF regulons
  are represented by “REG” boxes. Where reported, the consensus sequences (cis-elements)
  bound by the upstream TF are shown as color-coded boxes within the promoter space
  (solid line) preceding the REG box or TF gene coding sequence (blue box, DRE; green
  box, ICEr1; pink box, ICEr2; and yellow box, EP2). Regulatory connections are mapped
  using triangular arrowheads to represent gene activation and flattened arrowheads
  to represent gene repression. Dashed arrows represent regulatory connections with
  experimental support but accomplished by unknown (and possibly posttranscriptional)
  mechanisms. Protein phosphorylation events, where known, are indicated by circles
  attached to the protein TFs. Genes modeled (and corresponding Arabidopsis Genome
  Initiative no.) are ICE1, AT3G26744; ZAT12, AT5G59820; HOS9, AT2G01500; CBF2, AT4G25470;
  CBF1, AT4G25490; CBF3, AT4G25480; ZAT10, AT1G27730; RAP2.1, AT1G46768; and RAP2.6,
  AT1G43160.
