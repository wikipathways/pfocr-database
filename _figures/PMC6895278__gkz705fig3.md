caption: Models for lesion bypass. (A) When a replication fork stalls at a lesion,
  PCNA becomes monoubiquitinated by Rad6p/Rad18p at K164. This is the initial step
  in both lesion bypass pathways, translesion synthesis (TLS) and template-switching.
  For both pathways models have been proposed for bypass occurring at the replication
  fork (co-replication) or after synthesis has reprimed downstream of the lesion (post-replication).
  Here, bypass is depicted on the leading strand. (B, C) Template switching is instigated
  by polyubiquitination of K164, by Mms2p/Ubc13p/Rad5p. This pathway involves switching
  to the undamaged sister strand as a template for synthesis. This pathway may occur
  at the fork – one mechanism would be fork reversal as depicted here – or template
  switching may occur after the replication fork has moved on. (D, E) Rev1p binds
  monoubiquitinated Pol30p/PCNA (Ub-PCNA) facilitated by interactions through its
  BRCT, PAD, and UBM domains. A TLS pol such as pol η is recruited through interactions
  with Rev1 and Ub-PCNA. After recruitment, pol η (or another TLS pol) can insert
  a nucleotide opposite the lesion. Next pol ζ is recruited to Ub-PCNA by its interaction
  with Rev1p, and continues extension past the site of the lesion. In a co-replication
  model pol ζ would hand synthesis off to a replication polymerase. In the post-replication
  or ‘gap filling’ model, pol ζ may fill in a gap either on its own or might hand
  off to replication polymerases to finish synthesis in the gap.
