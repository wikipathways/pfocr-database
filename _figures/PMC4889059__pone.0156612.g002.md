caption: 'Left: PC lipid levels were increased in the rs9939609 risk allele group.
  Increased PC levels dependent on the FTO variant rs9939609 might promote T2D and
  obesity via fat accumulation in body and by inflammation caused by ApoB-induced
  LDL augmentation in the blood. Right: Valine levels were also increased in the rs9939609
  risk allele group. Increased valine levels induce activation of the mTOR/S6K1 kinase
  pathway and phosphorylation of several serine residues in IRS-1, contributing to
  insulin resistance. In addition, increased valine catabolic flux may contribute
  to increased gluconeogenesis and glucose intolerance via glutamate transamination
  to alanine.'
