caption: RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway. Components and mechanisms ensuring signal transduction
  in this pathway are depicted, with black arrows indicating ubiquitination processes.
  K63-linked polyubiquitination is indicated with green hexagons. Components shown
  to be (formally or putatively (question mark)) required in this pathway but whose
  exact relationship is not defined are shown connected by broken lines. Red filaments
  represent activating double strand RNA. Activation occurs at the surface of the
  mitochondria. E3 ligases TRIM4 and MEX3C may also participate in RIG-I activating
  ubiquitination. See text for details.
