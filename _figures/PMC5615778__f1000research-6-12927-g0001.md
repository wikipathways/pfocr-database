caption: (A) When glucose is present, it is metabolised by glycolysis to FBP, which
  binds to aldolase and the v-ATPase at the lysosomal surface – , preventing the interaction
  of LKB1, AXIN, and AMPK on the lysosome. If amino acids are present (most likely
  within the lysosomal lumen ), they activate the Ragulator complex, converting the
  RagA or RagB partner of the Rag heterodimer into its active GTP-bound form and recruiting
  mTORC1 to the lysosome because of the interaction between Raptor and RagA/B:GTP.
  If growth factors are also present, they activate the Akt pathway, inactivating
  the TSC1:TSC2 complex and promoting conversion of the small G protein Rheb into
  its active GTP-bound form. This further activates mTORC1, promoting biosynthesis
  and cell growth. Under these conditions, LKB1 is present as a complex with Axin
  in the cytoplasm, whereas AMPK may be partly cytoplasmic and partly lysosomal, and
  the latter location requires the N-terminal myristoylation of the β subunit. (B)
  When glucose is absent, FBP is no longer bound to aldolase and the latter may dissociate
  from the v-ATPase, at least in budding yeast. This allows a ternary complex of LKB1,
  AXIN, and AMPK to bind to the v-ATPase and the Ragulator complex, preventing activation
  of mTORC1. The proximity of LKB1 and AMPK also causes phosphorylation and activation
  of the latter. AMPK then phosphorylates Raptor (triggering 14-3-3 binding and preventing
  re-activation of mTORC1) and also TSC2, antagonising activation of mTORC1 by growth
  factors. AMPK also phosphorylates other targets that promote alternate catabolic
  pathways while inhibiting anabolic pathways. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; v-ATPase, vacuolar ATPase.
