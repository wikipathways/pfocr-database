caption: Autophagy is a catabolic process in which excessive or damaged proteins and
  cellular organelles are degraded in autophagosomes. Drugs bind to surface receptors
  such as opioid, mGluR5, and sigma-1 receptors, leading to series of downstream molecular
  event. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) suppresses autophagy pathway when
  nutrient condition is adequate for normal cellular function. In the context of drugs,
  ULK1 complex is activated upon suppression of mTOR, leading to initiation of autophagy.
  The formation of autophagosome requires PI3KIII/Beclin-1 complex. The conjugation
  of Atg16, Atg12, and LC3 is critical for the elongation of the vesicular membrane.
  LC3II, the lipidated form of LC3, presents on both the outer and inner membrane
  of autophagosome, therefore is widely used as an autophagic marker protein. The
  mature autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome to form an autophagolysosome. The
  contents that is sequestered by autophagosome are degraded by lysosomal enzymes.
