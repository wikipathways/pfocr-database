caption: Graphical summary of rapid inflammasome activation events in monocytes during
  acute myocardial infarction. Rapid inflammasome activation happens after simultaneous
  dual signal, DAMP-induced TLR priming and extracellular ATP sensing by P2RX7 at
  the injury site. TLR signaling triggers removal of ubiquitin modification or phosphorylation
  (red tags) of basal NLRP3 that repress inflammasome complex formation. The same
  signaling cascades also induces post-translational modifications in other residues
  that enhances inflammasome activation (green tags). P2RX7 ion-channel activation
  triggers intracellular K+ efflux, which induces NLRP3 multimerization. Active inflammasome
  complex recruits pro-CASP1, its catalytic activation and subsequent pro-IL18 cleavage
  and release. Rapid inflammasome activation and IL18 release happens in classical
  monocytes (Mo) at the site of the occluded vessel or in the ischemic area at the
  early phase of AMI, within the first hours after infarction (left panel). This pathway
  releases very low levels of IL-1β because IL-1β is transcription dependent. NLRP3
  specific inhibitor, MCC950, can block this process. Circulating monocytes in the
  blood away from the site of ischemic lesion are potentially only able to sense DAMPs
  but not the short-lived ATP. Activation of only TLR signal induces upregulation
  of the anti-inflammatory mediators TNFAIP3 and IRAKM. TNFAIP3 potentially modulates
  a concomitant decline of inflammasome priming alongside a significant decrease of
  acute IL18 release in a protective mechanism against systemic inflammatory hyper-activation
  (right panel). The given time frames in this graphical summary are just an estimated
  guess of the authors.
