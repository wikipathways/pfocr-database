caption: Vasoconstrictor agonists through Gq/11/phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) increases
  [Ca2+]i and causes contraction through calcium-calmodulin (CaM)/myosin light-chain
  kinase (MLCK) pathway (1). Diacylglycerol (DAG) activates protein kinase C (PKC),
  which phosphorylates MLCK and Rho kinase (2). Vasoconstrictor receptors are also
  coupled to G12/13, which activates Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
  and then Rho-kinase, which inhibits myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) (3). NO
  through sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway (4) inhibits transient receptor potential type C (TRPC)
  channels, voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), and inositol-3-phosphate (IP3)
  receptor (IP3R), as well as activates inward-rectifier K+ channels (Kir), big conductance
  Ca2+ activated K+ channels (BKCa), voltage-dependent K+ channels (Kv), ATP-sensitive
  K+ channel (KATP), and ryanodine receptors (RyR) in vascular smooth muscle (VSM)
  cells. PKG inhibits Gq/11 and PLCβ (5) as well as activates sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (6) and decreases [Ca2+]i and therefore causes VSM relaxation.
  NO reacts with superoxide anion (O2-) to produce ONOO−, which activates SERCA (7).
  H2S inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) and activates the cGMP–PKG pathway (8). In
  addition, H2S activates Kir, BKCa, Kv, KATP, and RyR independent of cGMP–PKG pathway
  (9). PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.
