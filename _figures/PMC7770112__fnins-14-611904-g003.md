caption: OXR1-mediated Oxidative Stress Resistance Model. Based on our current understanding,
  OXR1 functions in multiple pathways that contribute to oxidative stress resistance.
  In this model cells experience oxidative stress, either due to external or internal
  factors affecting ROS levels and respond in an OXR1-dependent fashion. Mitochondria
  are required for OXR1 function () (upper left). When oxidative stress occurs, mitochondrial
  bound and/or cytoplasmic OXR1 forms act as sensors that respond to the signal (possibly
  ROS) and triggers downstream protective pathways. Pathways shown with solid lines
  are supported by multiple lines of evidence. Dashed lines represent hypothetical
  pathways. The red arrows indicate pathways involved in activation or repression
  of gene expression. One set of red arrows illustrate direct protein-protein interactions
  of OXR1 with transcription factors to alter gene expression. A second red pathway
  indicates regulation by OXR1 interaction with PRMT5, PRMT1 and possibly other PRMT
  proteins. PRMT proteins methylate histones and modulate chromatin structure and
  proteins other than histones, possibly including transcription factors. Blue arrows
  depict the PRMT5 activation of p53 to arrest the cell cycle, which is necessary
  for efficient DNA repair and regulation of apoptosis (). Green arrows depict interactions
  of OXR1 with other proteins to modulate their activities (, ; ; ).
