caption: The pyrimidine metabolism in cells In mammal, pyrimidine synthesis is composed
  of de novo pathway and salvage pathway. The de novo synthesis pathway initiated
  with the generation from glutamine to dihydroorotate catalyzed by trifunctional
  enzyme CAD including carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase,
  and dihydroorotase. The mitochondrial inner membrane protein DHODH oxidizes dihydroorotase
  to orotate accompanied by the respiratory chain transmission. Orotate is subsequently
  phosphorylated and produced to UMP by bifunctional enzyme UMPs. As for pyrimidine
  salvage synthesis pathway, cells obtained extracellular uridine and cytidine mainly
  through two nucleosides transporter families, SLC28A as well as SLC29A. Subsequently,
  uridine and cytidine are converted to UMP and CTP, respectively.
