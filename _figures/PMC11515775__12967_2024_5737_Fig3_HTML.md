caption: The effect of caffeine on molecular pathways and neurotransmitters. In the
  absence of caffeine, adenosine acts as an inhibitory modulator of neuronal activity.
  Adenosine binds to its presynaptic receptor to inhibit the release of neurotransmitters
  including dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. It also binds to its postsynaptic receptor
  to disrupt the interaction of dopamine and serotonin with their receptors. Dopamine,
  serotonin and glutamate induce neuronal signal transduction and inhibit neuronal
  function. Caffeine abrogates the interaction of adenosine with its presynaptic and
  postsynaptic receptors, promoting the release of dopamine, serotonin and glutamate
  and enhances the interaction of dopamine and serotonin with their postsynaptic receptors
  to increase neuron activity and functions. Caffeine abolishes the inhibitory effects
  of adenosine on dopaminergic pathway, increasing dopaminergic inputs on mesocorticolimbic
  structures and promoting human psychomotor activity
