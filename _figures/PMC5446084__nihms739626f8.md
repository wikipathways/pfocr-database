caption: Proposed molecular mechanism of miR-125b driven profibrogenic pathway. Upon
  cardiac stress, Ang II-TGF-β profibrotic signaling is activated, which in turn results
  in the induction of miR-125b expression. Increased miR-125b expression is responsible
  for the suppression of apelin and p53, resulting in augmented FMT, and fibroblast
  proliferation. Collectively, miR-125b has a concomitant effect on other important
  cellular processes including epistatic regulation of proliferation and TGF-β pathways,
  thereby promoting cardiac fibrosis.
