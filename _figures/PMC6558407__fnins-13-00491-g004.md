caption: Summary of changes related to insulin-autophagy pathway observed in Parkinson’s
  Disease. (A) In Parkinson’s disease, a decrease in PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling is observed,
  which leads to GSK3β activation. GSK3β hyperphosphorylates tau protein leading to
  neurofibrillary tangles deposition. mTORC1 complex is inactive which causes autophagy
  to become activated. Otherwise, high levels of α-Synuclein (αSyn) impair the autophagic
  process together with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS
  leads to abnormal permeabilization of lysosomal membranes, thereby causing lysosomal
  depletion and the accumulation of autophagosomes, resulting in inefficient autophagy.
  As a result of an incomplete αSyn autophagic degradation, a new reactive specie
  called pαSyn∗ is generated inside autophagosomes and when released in cytosol it
  associates with mitochondrion being highly mitotoxic. Damaged mitochondrion is indicated
  by dashed line. (B) Some pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies that
  act in PI3K-AKT-mTOR-autophagy signaling are presented. Exenatide-treated patients
  have a sustained increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation levels, total AKT and pAKT as
  well as increased levels of mTOR, reverting the impaired signaling observed in PD
  pathophysiology. Rapamycin, which specifically blocks mTORC1 activity, was able
  to decrease oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury in animal models, whereas
  physical exercise is associated with an increase in autophagy and a decrease in
  both αSyn aggregates and dopaminergic neuronal loss.
