caption: 'The effects of ADPN on metabolism in peripheral organs and related signaling
  pathways.ADPN has regulatory effects on glucolipid metabolism, insulin resistance,
  and anti-inflammatory effects. It is secreted from adipocytes to blood vessels and
  then circulated to the brain, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. ADPN exerts
  vascular protective effects via stimulation of the PPARγ pathway, eNOS activation,
  and AMPK pathways and inhibits inflammatory responses by activating the NF-κB pathway,
  the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway, and some inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and
  IL-10. In addition, ADPN targets regulate brain energy metabolism as well as glucose
  and lipid metabolism through the AMPK pathway, PPARα pathway, P38 MAPK pathway,
  ceramide pathway, IRS pathway, and insulin/IGF1-PI3K pathway. They also affect skeletal
  muscle functions through the AdipoR-APPL1, Ca2+-CAMKK2, SIRT1-PGC-1α, and APPL1-PKCζ-PP2A
