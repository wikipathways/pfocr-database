caption: The IL‐17A signalling pathway. IL‐17 binds to its receptor, which is composed
  of IL17RA and IL‐17RC. Upon ligand binding, activated Act1 phosphorylated TRAF6
  and triggers the transcription of TRAF6‐dependent target genes such as NF‐κB, CEBP
  and MAPK/AP‐1. The IL17A signalling pathway is regulated by many molecules, including
  TRAF family, HuR and so on. TRAF2‐TRAF5 complex and HuR stabilize the mRNA of IL‐17A
  target genes and contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke, while TRAF3 and TRAF4
  seem to play a negative role. TRAF3 competes with Act1 to IL‐17R, while TRAF4 competes
  with TRAF6 for Act1. Besides, ERK1/2 and GSK‐3β phosphorylate the Thr188 and Thr179
  of C/EBPβ, in turn, inhibits of CEBP pathway. References in , , , .
