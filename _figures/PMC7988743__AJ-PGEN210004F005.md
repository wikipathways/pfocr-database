caption: 'Metanetwork showing interactions between pathways. Nodes represent manually
  selected set of 12 significantly enriched metabolic pathways. Edge weights between
  pathways correspond to the total strength of protein-chemical interactions from
  the STITCH database between members of those pathways. Edge width and transparency
  are both proportional to edge weight. A: baseline network: all measured genes and
  metabolites in each pathway are included. B: perturbed network: only the leading
  edge genes and metabolites (i.e., those most altered by irradiation) are included
  from each pathway.'
