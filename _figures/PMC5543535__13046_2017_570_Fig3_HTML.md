caption: Hypoxia induces metabolic adaptations to prevent ROS related damage and maintain
  proliferation. Under hypoxic conditions tumor cells experience elevated levels of
  ROS. To mitigate the negative impact of ROS, tumor cells have been shown to increase
  glycogen stores which are later broken down into glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6-P)
  [49, 62]. Hypoxic cells increase flux through the pentose phosphate pathway which
  produces NADPH and Ribose-5-phosphate (Ribose-5-P). Ribose-5-P serves as a precursor
  for DNA nucleotides thus facilitating proliferation []. NADPH provides reducing
  equivalents that restore glutathione levels and neutralize ROS. NADPH is also generated
  through reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate by Isocitrate Dehydrogenase proteins
  [, ]. Following oxygen deprivation, glutamine is metabolized to form glutamate and
  subsequently α-ketoglutarate []. The formation of citrate by IDH proteins has been
  shown to increase lipogenesis and facilitate proliferation []
