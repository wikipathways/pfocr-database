caption: The binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 may activate CSE through a calcium-dependent
  pathway, which in turn promotes endogenous H2S production. Nucleophilic attack by
  H2S on the disulfide bond between Cys 1045-1024 leads to reduction of the disulfide
  bond and enhances VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase activity. CBS-derived and CSE-derived H2S
  enhances the stability and transcriptional activity of Sp1, which further promotes
  the transcription of VEGFR2. H2S results in increased HIF-1α levels, DNA binding,
  and transcriptional activity. VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
  2; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; CSE, cystathionine-γ lyase; CBS, cystathionine-β
  synthase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia response element; Sp1, specificity
  protein 1; H2S, hydrogen sulfide.
