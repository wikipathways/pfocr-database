caption: 'Bone marrow stromal cells express and secrete Biglycan, which directly binds
  many growth factors, morphogens, cell surface receptors and other ECM structural
  and adhesive molecules. When Bgn (or any other SLRP) is missing, these cytokines
  are not being sequestered in the cellular microenvironment, thus modifying the closely
  regulated signal transduction of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Here, we focus
  on the effect of TNFα overactivation. TNFα binds to its receptor on the membrane
  of both BMSCs (A) or hematopoietic/preosteoclastic cells (B). A. In pre-osteoblasts,
  TNFα activates Smurf1/2, inhibiting SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, which leads to the
  inhibition of osteogenic gene expression regulated by the osteoblastogenesis transcription
  factor, RUNX2. TNF-α also induces the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor
  of Wnt signaling, leading to a decrease in bone formation. Furthermore, Canonical
  wnt signaling promotes OPG expression, thus the inhibition of this pathway leads
  to decreased OPG levels. TNF-α activation directly increases the expression M-CSF
  and RANKL by BMSCs. B. in pre-osteoclasts, TNF-α signaling leads to phosphorylation
  of the IKK complex with subsequent phosphorylation and proteolytic breakdown of
  IκB, an inhibitor of the NFκB. The activated NFκB, together with C-fos, c-jun, increase
  the experssion and activity of NFATc1, the master transcription factor in osteoclast
  differentiation, which then translocates into the nucleus, increasing the expression
  of osteoclast target genes such as TRAP, calcitonin receptor, cathepsin K and OSCAR.
  TNF-α signaling also enhances preosteoclast expression of RANK and c-fms, the M-CSF
  receptor. The combined effect is a decrease in bone formation signals with an increase
  in osteoclast differentiation, activity and survival, resulting in a low bone mass
  phenotype. Abbreviations: BGN, Biglycan; BMSC, bone marrow stromal cells; BSP, bone
  sialoprotein; ECM, extracellular matrix; OPN, osteopontin; SLRP, small leucine rich
  proteoglycan; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.'
