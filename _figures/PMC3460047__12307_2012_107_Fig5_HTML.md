caption: Usually growth factors bind and activate EGFR on the cell membrane of cancer
  cells to stimulate the down-stream PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. Gene transcriptions
  and cell viability are enhanced. However the lymphocytes and antibodies elicited
  by EGFR-based vaccine block the binding of growth factor and EGFR
