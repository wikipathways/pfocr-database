caption: Proteins with differential abundance involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation pathway during salt stress in leaves
  of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) accession C08. Each significant differentially
  expressed protein is presented as heatmaps with shades of red or blue according
  to the scale bar. Scale bar indicates log2-fold changes of protein abundance (stress
  vs. control) with an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. *, significant difference at p ≤ 0.05;
  **, significant difference at p ≤ 0.01 using ANOVA test. Black arrow, reaction between
  two intermediates; dashed arrow, several steps in the reaction. For tandem mass
  spectrometry, the total leaf protein was extracted from leaves of 14-day-old C08
  seedlings grown in 1/2 strength Hoagland solution and treated with or without 0.9%
  (w/v) NaCl. Differential protein abundances were calculated by label-free quantification
  of MS peptide signals. PDH E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component.
