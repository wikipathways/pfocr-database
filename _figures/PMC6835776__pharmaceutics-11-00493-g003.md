caption: 'Schematic diagram of the proposed effects of ZnO nanocomposites on antigen-presenting
  cells and their potential role in inducing T cell responses in draining lymph node.
  Various forms of ZnO nanocomposites (e.g., ZnO NPs and NWs) can stimulate inflammatory
  responses in antigen-presenting cells via TLR recognition or direct endocytosis/phagocytosis,
  which subsequently initiates immune signaling cascades. TLR stimulation by ZnO nanocomposites
  can upregulate downstream molecules IRAK and TRAF, and enhance subsequent MAPK pathways.
  Then, the inhibitor of NFκB, IκB, is degraded and NFκB is activated accordingly.
  Endocytosed ZnO nanocomposites transported into the acidic lysosomes dissociate
  into Zn2+ ions and ionic form of zinc disrupts oxidative balance, increasing ROS
  generation. Ultimately, upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathway and ROS
  generation enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
  and increase the surface expression of co-stimulatory and antigen presenting molecules.
  Stimulated antigen presenting cells migrate into draining lymph node and prime naïve
  CD4 and CD8 T cells into effector T cells, which can initiate both humoral and cell-mediated
  immune responses against specific antigen associated with ZnO nanocomposites. A
  representative example of anti-cancer immunity induced by ZnO nanocomposites coated
  with a tumor antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is presented in the right
