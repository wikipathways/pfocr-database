caption: A working model shows that YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 work synergistically to regulate
  Wnt5a‐PCP signaling pathway and cerebellar granule cell axon growth. A) Under normal
  conditions, YTHDF1 promotes the translation of m6A‐modified Dvl1 mRNA in GC axons.
  Dvl1 can block Wnt5a‐Fzd3‐activated PCP signaling. Meanwhile, YTHDF2 facilitates
  Wnt5a mRNA degradation to downregulate Wnt5a protein level in GC axons. So both
  YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 negatively regulate Wnt5a‐PCP signaling pathway and GC axon growth.
  B) In Ythdf1 and Ythdf2 cKO mice, local translation of Dvl1 mRNA and decay of Wnt5a
  mRNA in GC axons are inhibited, respectively. The resulting downregulation of Dvl1
  and upregulation of Wnt5a protein levels in axons potentiate Wnt5a‐PCP signaling
  and promote GC axon growth.
