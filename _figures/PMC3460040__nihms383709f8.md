caption: Previous studies have shown that in PC2-defective cholangiocytes, [Ca2+]
  is decreased in the cytosol and in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and store operated
  Ca2+ entry is inhibited, leading to adenyl cyclase 6 (AC6) activation and inappropriate
  overproduction of cAMP. Elevated cAMP/PKA is, in turn, responsible for a persistent
  stimulation of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway with subsequent increase in cell proliferation.
  The MEK/ERK1/2 pathway is activated by Raf, which in turn is activated by Ras. Ras
  recruits Raf to the plasma membrane and induces hetero-dimerization of B-Raf and
  Raf-1, the two isoforms of Raf expressed in epithelial cells including cholangiocytes.
  In the presence of an activated Ras inducing the formation of a heterodimer B-Raf/Raf-1,
  sorafenib, is able to inhibit only B-Raf, while paradoxically activating Raf-1 and,
  subsequently, the MEK/ERK pathway. Activated MEK/ERK1/2 pathway induces cell proliferation
  and VEGF secretion with subsequent cyst growth. (see text for further details).
