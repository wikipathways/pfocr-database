caption: Proposed mechanism of PTU and methimazole in pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
  in Graves’ disease. AKT, protein kinase B; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; IKK, IKβ
  kinase; PI-3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  PTU, propylthiouracil; ROS, reactive oxygen species; intercellular adhesion molecule-1;
  VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Thyroid hormone induces activation of
  the PI-3K/AKT/IKK/NF-κB pathway, which in turn increase expression of adhesion molecules—ICAM-1,
  VCAM-1, and E-selectin. In addition, thyroid hormone also increases ROS, amplifying
  NF-κB activation through IKK. However, treatment with PTU can block the PI-3K/AKT/IKK/NF-κB
  pathway by inducing the expression of PTEN, a tumor-suppressor gene that can block
  the PI-3K/AKT pathway, resulting in less expression of adhesion molecules.
