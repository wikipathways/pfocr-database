caption: 'EMT signaling induced during P. gingivalis infection in primary OECs. Schematic
  diagram of the proposed EMT signaling mechanisms in OECs during long-term infection
  by P. gingivalis. The dotted line indicates the pathway without P. gingivalis infection
  and the solid lines represent the path in the presence of infection: P. gingivalis
  increases PI3K/Akt activation (Yilmaz et al., ; Yao et al., ) which can lead to
  the inactivation of GSK3β, resulting in the increased expression of Snail and Slug
  transcription factors. These molecular changes promote the loss of E-cadherin and
  nucleo-cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin. The three transcription factors, Snail,
  Slug, and β-catenin induce the increased expressions of Zeb1, Vimentin, and MMP2,
  7, and 9.'
