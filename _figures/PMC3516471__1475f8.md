caption: Expression data mapped onto the KEGG pathway network. Protein-coding genes
  (circular nodes) differentially expressed under iron-limiting conditions were linked
  to their associated KEGG pathways. Genes are colored based on the expression level
  after 48 hr from the addition of DFB according the displayed color bar. Antisense
  RNAs (diamond shapes) differentially expressed were linked to the corresponding
  complementary gene. The whole network is displayed in (A). The yellow rectangle
  marks the part that is enlarged in (B) and includes carbon fixation, nitrogen reduction,
  and the photosynthesis systems. HCO3−, NO3−, NO2−, N2O, and NH3 metabolites are
  shown in (B) to highlight pathways discussed in the main text.
