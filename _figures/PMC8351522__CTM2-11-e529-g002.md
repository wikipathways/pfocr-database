caption: Conclusion of proteinomics, mtDNA, and mt‐RNA in lung diseases. A, Proteinomics
  of lung cancer (LC), pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), and chronic obstructive
  pulmonary diseases (COPD) patients or cell models by liquid chromatography–tandem
  mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) found many specific proteins related to mitochondrial
  function. In lung cancer, complement C1q‐binding protein (C1QBP), ornithine aminotransferase
  (OAT), and ATPase family AAA domain‐containing protein 3B (AAA‐TOB3) were upregulated
  and correlated to clinical outcomes. In PAH or COPD, proteins of different expression
  with the healthy could be clustered into mitochondrial pathway including oxygen
  consumption, oxidative stress, metabolic reprograming, and mitochondrial dynamics.
  B, The studies on mtDNA in LC found that mouse double minute 2 proto‐oncogene could
  promote cancer cell migration and invasion through its regulation of mtDNA transcription.
  Posttranscriptional modification of mtDNA such as 6 mA methylation could repress
  DNA binding and bending by methyltransferase like 4 (METTL4), which is a lack of
  studies in lung diseases. C, A few studies on mt‐tRNA in LC, idiopathic pulmonary
  fibrosis (IPF), and sarcoidosis found 5,12, and 17 tRNA mutations, respectively.
  Noncoding RNAs in mitochondria are also important, but no studies were conducted
  in lung diseases. The dotted box represented the lack of studies in lung diseases
