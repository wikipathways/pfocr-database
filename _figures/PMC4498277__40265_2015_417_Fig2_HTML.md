caption: Schematic representation of sclerostin actions. Osteocyte-produced sclerostin
  inhibits the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of osteoblasts and reduces
  bone formation; it also stimulates the production of RANKL by neighboring osteocytes
  and bone resorption. In osteoblasts, sclerostin binds to LRP5/6 and inhibits the
  Wnt signaling pathway, an action facilitated by LRP4. Production of sclerostin is
  decreased by mechanical loading, PTH, estrogens and other factors, and antisclerostin
  antibodies. LRP low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, PTH parathyroid
  hormone, RANKL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand
