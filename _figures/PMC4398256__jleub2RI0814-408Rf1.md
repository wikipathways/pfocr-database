caption: (A) Activators and inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in T cells.
  mTORC1 is activated by surface receptor signaling, environment cues, and nutrients.
  TCR, CD28, and IL-2R signaling to the PI3K-Akt pathway activates mTORC1 via multiple
  mechanisms. These include inhibiting the activity of TSC2, promoting stabilized
  Raptor-mTOR interactions, and removing steric hindrance mediated by PRAS40. TCR
  and CD28-induced Erk1/2 activation may also facilitate mTORC1 activation, and this
  process is likely antagonized by DGKs. Amino acid uptake enhances mTORC1 activation
  via the CBM complex by unknown mechanisms. Collectively, mTORC1 signaling promotes
  many functional outputs. The upstream regulators of mTORC2 activation remain poorly
  understood, but mTORC2 signaling drives cytoskeletal rearrangements and alters gene
  transcription. (B) Control of metabolic programs by mTORC1, which regulates metabolism
  via several transcriptional factors. mTORC1 activates HIF-1α and c-MYC to promote
  glycolysis. Additionally, c-MYC stimulates glutaminolysis. mTORC1 also triggers
  lipid synthesis by activating SREBPs. mLST8, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein
  8; Deptor, disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin domain-containing mTOR-interacting
  protein, Protor-1, protein observed with Rictor-1; mSin1, mammalian stress-activated
  protein kinase-interacting protein 1.
