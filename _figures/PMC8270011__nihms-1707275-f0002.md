caption: Pathophysiology and management of CVD. Genetic, environmental and behavioral
  risk factors cause an increase in HIFs and tissue metabolites leading to increases
  in MMPs. Increased venous hydrostatic pressure also causes changes in shear stress,
  endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx injury, increased permeability, leukocyte infiltration,
  and increased adhesion molecules, inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), leading to further increases in MMPs.
  Increased MMPs cause VSM hyperpolarization and relaxation as well as ECM degradation
  leading to vein wall dilation, and progressive increases in venous hydrostatic pressure
  (vicious cycle). Increased MMPs generally promote ECM degradation particularly in
  atrophic regions. Other theories (indicated by interrupted arrows) suggest a compensatory
  anti-inflammatory pathway involving prostaglandins and their receptors that leads
  to decreased MMPs, ECM accumulation in hypertrophic regions, and tortuous VVs. Increased
  venous hydrostatic pressure in the lower extremity saphenous and femoral veins also
  causes venous valve dysfunction and venous reflux. Progressive vein wall dilation
  and valve dysfunction lead to different stages of CVD and CVI. Current treatment
  (presented in shaded arrows) includes compression stockings, venotonics and other
  pharmacological and surgical approaches. MMP Inhibitors (also presented in shaded
  arrows) may provide potential tools for the management of CVD/CVI.
