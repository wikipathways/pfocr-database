caption: LPS from Gram-negative bacteria is recognized by TLR4, inducing TRIF-dependent
  type I IFN production. Francisella novicida is a cytosolic bacterium which is recognized
  by the DNA sensor cGAS, inducing STING-dependent type I IFN production. RNA from
  influenza A virus triggers the RNA sensors TLR7 via the adaptor MyD88 and RIG-I
  via the adaptor MAVS, both inducing production of type I IFNs. The type I IFN signaling
  pathway is activated via the transcription factors STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9, leading
  to upregulation of caspase-11, IFN-inducible GTPases, including guanylate-binding
  proteins (GBPs) and Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs), and other IFN-inducible proteins
  including the sensor ZBP1. GBP2 ruptures the vacuole containing Gram-negative bacteria,
  mediating the liberation of LPS into the cytoplasm for recognition by caspase-11.
  IRGB10 further disrupts Gram-negative bacteria to increase LPS accessibility for
  detection by caspase-11. GBP2, GBP5 and IRGB10 directly target the bacterial membrane
  of cytosolic-dwelling F. novicida, exposing its DNA for sensing by AIM2. Activation
  of the caspase-11-NLRP3 inflammasome in response to Gram-negative bacteria and activation
  of the AIM2 inflammasome in response to F. novicida lead to pyroptosis via gasdermin
  D. ZBP1 recognizes proteins from the influenza A virus and induce pyroptosis, necroptosis,
  and apoptosis via RIPK3, FADD and caspase-8.
