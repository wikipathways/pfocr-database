caption: 'The relationship between karrikins (KARs) and strigolactone (SL). Proposed
  signal transduction of KARs and SL mediated by KAI2 and D14, and MAX2. The conformations
  of KAI2 and D14 will change once bound with KARs and SL, respectively. The conformational
  change allows KAI2 to interact with MAX2 to form a SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
  which can degrade the repressor SMAX1/SMAX1-LIKE. Following, the activated transcription
  factor can regulate the expression of KARs response genes. SL binds to the receptor
  D14 and then MAX2 to form a SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as well. Then the repressor
  D53 is degraded, helping the SL signal to transduct successfully to SL response
  genes. High similarities exist between the KARs and SL signaling pathways: KARs
  and SL are analogs; KAI2 and D14 are homologs; MAX2 is a communal F-box protein;
  SMAX1 and D53 are homologs (; ; ; ; ; ). The gray block schemes shows the common
  signaling pathway model of KARs and SL which contains signals, receptors, E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, repressors, transcription factors and response genes.'
