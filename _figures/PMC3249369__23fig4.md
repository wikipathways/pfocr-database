caption: Three MAPK pathways in yeast share common components and also contain pathway-specific
  factors. (A) Three MAPK pathways are shown. Colored proteins represent pathway-specific
  factors; protein shown in black function in multiple pathways. Scaffold-mediated
  interactions are shown by colored, dashed lines. Not all protein interactions are
  shown. Hot1 is one of a number of transcription factors for the HOG pathway. The
  red question mark indicates that how nutritional signals feed into filamentous growth
  pathway regulation is not well understood. (B) Examples of MAPK morphogenesis in
  yeast. The pheromone response (Mating) pathway induces distinctive polarized structures
  called shmoos to promote cell fusion and diploid formation. The Filamentous Growth
  pathway induces filamentous growth, branched chains of elongated and connected cells.
  Activation of the HOG pathway does not induce polarized growth. Bar, 5 μm.
