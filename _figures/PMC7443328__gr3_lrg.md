caption: Conceptual diagram of host/receptor cell infection after attachment with
  coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) and signaling pathways of virulent pathogens render overexpression
  of genetic and serological markers that help in the biochemical balance of cell
  survival and cell death after virulence. Nanodrugs can pass the physiological and
  anatomical barriers of the respiratory system and can act as anticoagulants.
