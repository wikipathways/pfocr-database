caption: Highlights the relationship between STING and ferroptosis. The excessive
  amount of iron and Gpx4 reduction can induce ferroptosis and production of 8-OHG,
  which leads to activation of the STING pathway and infiltration of macrophages during
  Kras-driven pancreatic cancer. However, when STING binds to mitofusins (MFN1/2)
  activates mitochondrial fusion, which increases the ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer
  cells.
