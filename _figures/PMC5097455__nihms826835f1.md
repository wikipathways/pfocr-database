caption: FL MAVS and miniMAVS are produced by a complex web of interlaced leaky scanning
  events. Re-initiation after translation of uORF leads to production of the truncated
  miniMAVS, which inhibits the signal transduction pathway initiated by FL MAVS during
  viral infection. This inhibition appears to act as a negative feedback loop to limit
  MAVS signaling.
