caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and promising drugs or small molecule compounds
  to inhibit viral infection. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved on the cell surface
  by TMPRSS2 into S1 and S2. Subsequently, RBD of S1 binds ACE2 and leads to the fusion
  of viral membrane and plasma membranes, releasing viral genetic material into the
  cytoplasm, where RNA transcription and replication are performed (pathway 1, brown
  line). The new viral RNA is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to
  be assembled with structural proteins and bud into vesicles. The vesicles are then
  transported to the cell surface and released. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and forms
  an endosome by endocytosis (pathway 2, blue line). The viral S protein is then cleaved
  by cathepsin L. The low PH in the endosome induces the fusion of the viral envelope
  with the endosome membrane, thereby releasing the viral genetic material. In this
  paper, the therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 mainly include: 1) viral attachment
  (S protein, ACE2 and ACE2/S protein-protein interaction); 2) S protein cleavage
  (TMPRSS2, cathepsin L); 3) viral entry (endocytosis).'
