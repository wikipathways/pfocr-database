caption: The HBV replication cycle and its secreted products. The HBV virion enters
  the hepatocyte by NTCP receptor binding, and uncoats prior to entry into the cytoplasm.
  The viral nucleocapsid is then transported to the nucleus, where it deposits its
  DNA genome. HBV relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA) genomes can be repaired and ligated
  to form cccDNA, the template for all viral RNAs. HBV core antigen (HBcAg) is translated
  and forms capsids, some of which form around the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and viral
  polymerase. The pgRNA is reverse-transcribed to form either double stranded linear
  DNA (dslDNA) or rcDNA forms of the virus genome. The mature nucleocapsid is then
  enveloped by host membranes studded with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and secreted
  at multi-vesicular bodies. Cytoplasmic HBV capsids are recycled at a poor efficiency
  to the nucleus and do not appear to significantly add to the cccDNA pool (; ; ).
  In a secondary pathway, HBV dslDNA can integrate into the host genome at host DNA
  breaks or form defective cccDNA (not shown). Some of these viral components are
  released in the serum (bottom) by as yet unclear mechanisms (dashed arrows) including
  within apoptotic bodies of dying hepatocytes, secretion through alternate pathways,
  or within exosomes. Even the form in which some of these biomarkers exist in the
  serum is still unknown and controversial (question marks). Figure was generated
