caption: Schematic overview of neuroprotection by the volatile anesthetics sevoflurane
  and isoflurane. (a) Isoflurane promotes cell survival by activating the DNA binding
  complex HIF-1α, resulting in increased levels of Erk1/2 and iNOS. Isoflurane also
  attenuates apoptosis via activation of TREK1- and KATP-channels. Activation of the
  TGF- β /JNK signaling pathway facilitates part of the neuroprotective effect of
  isoflurane. In addition, isoflurane leads to increased expression of SP1 and activation
  of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Isoflurane, but not sevoflurane promotes part
  of its detrimental action with the p75-NTR receptor, located solely in neurons.
  (b) Sevoflurane reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulating
  the TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, sevoflurane improves neuronal survival
  and decreases apoptosis and cellular atrophy via the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways.
  Sevoflurane also acts as an anti-oxidant and helps maintain vascular endothelial
  integrity.
