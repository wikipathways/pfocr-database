caption: Regulation of iron homeostasis by cellular iron levels (left) and oxidative
  stress (right). Iron regulatory protein 1/aconitase 1 (IRP1/ACO1) and iron regulatory
  protein 2/iron responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2/IREB2) ubiquitously regulate
  the transcription of several iron-related genes. In conditions of low cellular iron
  levels, both proteins recognize and bind RNA structures named iron-responsive elements
  (IREs) within the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the regulated mRNAs.
  In this way, the translation of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), ferritin light chain
  (FTL) and ferroportin1/solute carrier family 40 member 1 (FPN1/SLC40A1) mRNAs is
  blocked, while transferrin receptor (TFRC) and divalent metal transporter 1/solute
  carrier family 11 member 2 (DMT1/SLC11A2) mRNAs are stabilized and translated, thus
  decreasing cellular iron storage and release and increasing iron uptake. On the
  contrary, in iron excess conditions, both IRPs release IREs, increasing the translation
  of FTH1, FTL and FPN1/SLC40A1 mRNAs while decreasing the stability of TFRC and DMT1/SLC11A2
  mRNAs; in this way, cellular iron storage and release are increased, while uptake
  is decreased. Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and synuclein alpha (SNCA) genes
  are also involved in iron homeostasis, the first being a ferroxidase and the second
  a ferrireductase, and they are both regulated by IRPs, like FTH1, FTL and FPN1/SLC40A1
  mRNAs. Some iron-related genes are also regulated by oxidative stress through the
  sequestosome 1/protein 62/kelch-like ECH associated protein 1/NFE2 like bZIP transcription
  factor 2 (SQSTM1/p62/KEAP1/NRF2) signaling pathway. Under normal conditions, KEAP1
  interacts with and directs ubiquitinated NRF2 to proteasomal degradation; under
  oxidative stress conditions, KEAP1 releases NRF2, the transcription factor translocates
  to the nucleus and recognizes specific DNA sequences, the antioxidant responsive
  elements (AREs), in the promoter region of several genes involved in the antioxidant
  response, among which include FTH1, FTL, FPN1/SLC40A1 and SQSTM1/p62. SQSTM1/p62
  also binds and directs KEAP1 to autophagic degradation, further activating NRF2-related
  antioxidant response
