caption: JAK/STAT signaling pathway can be activated or inhibited by inflammatory
  cytokines to regulate the inflammation of UC. The JAK family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3,
  TYK2) binds non-covalently to cytokine receptors, and STATs, as JAK substrates,
  interact with the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathway. JAKs can interact
  with multiple STATs, which act as the final effectors of signaling, and these combinations
  can be activated to regulate transcription. Cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23,
  and IL-27, activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway via the JAK family, regulating
  the release of Th and Treg cells, thereby influencing UC inflammation. ‘Adapted
