caption: Enzymes that catabolize or use essential amino acids. Each of the amino acids
  that are considered essential for mammalian cells, because they are unable to synthesize
  them, are either catabolized (red arrows) or used to synthesize various products
  (blue arrows) by specific enzymes. Many of these enzymes are up-regulated in dendritic
  cells in response to inflammation and cytokines (both pro- and anti-inflammatory)
  or by the action of regulatory T (Treg) cells (highlighted in bold face). For example,
  arginase 1 (Arg1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) can both consume
  arginine, the availability of which is sensed through the RAG/mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leading to the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and
  the promotion of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression ().
