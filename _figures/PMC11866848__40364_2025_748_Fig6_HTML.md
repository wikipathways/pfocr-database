caption: Relationship between disulfidptosis-related pathways and ICIs. SLC7A11 facilitates
  cystine uptake, which is reduced to cysteine by NADPH. The synthesis of GSH from
  cysteine and intracellular glutamate not only inhibits ROS-mediated PD-L1 expression
  but also regulates the SSG process in the endoplasmic reticulum, influencing the
  calcium/NF-κB signaling pathway by modulating SERCA activity. This ultimately suppresses
  PD-L1 and Fas/CD95 expression. Glucose also mediates the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  promoting PD-L1 expression. Additionally, the Rac1P29S mutation can increase PD-L1
  expression. GSH, glutathione; SLC7A11, recombinant solute carrier family 7, member
