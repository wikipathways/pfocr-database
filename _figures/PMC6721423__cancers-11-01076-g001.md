caption: Mechanisms of PTEN-mediated control of cancer stem cells (CSCs) hallmarks.
  PTEN deficiency promotes self-renewal through inhibitory phosphorylation of FoxO3a
  [,] and GSK3β, which increases nuclear β-catenin localization []. Furthermore, it
  induces STAT3 activation by NFkB-mediated IL6 transcription [] and CXCR4 expression
  []. MicroRNAs (miR-10b [], miR-21 [], miR-106b [] and TGFβ-induced miR-216a [])
  and PRMT5-mediated methylation [] are also involved in the downregulation of PTEN
  and regulation of self-renewal. Hyperactive AKT acts on cell cycle stimulating proliferation
  trough PAX7 [], cyclinD1 [] or C-MYC []. PTEN loss may trigger G0 cell cycle arrest
  and quiescence of CSCs [,,,,,,,]. Activation of mTOR is required for CSC survival
  and can be associated with the activation of collateral pro-survival pathways such
  as HIF-1α []. S100A4 [] and BMI1 [], along with several miRNAs (miR-20a/miR-200c
  [], miR-17, miR-221/222 []) impair PTEN function, thus promoting EMT and metastatic
  progression. The lncRNA-GAEA inhibits PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, switching
  on its protein phosphatase activity and promoting the accumulation of EMT master
  regulators such as TWIST, SNAIL, and YAP []. Moreover, activation of the RAS/MAPK
  pathway [], NOTCH1 signaling [], and MAOA [] cooperate with PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis to
  promote the EMT program.
