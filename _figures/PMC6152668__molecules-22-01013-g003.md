caption: A schematic representation of DET- and IDET-induced apoptosis in different
  cancer cell lines. DET and IDET trigger the activation of extrinsic apoptosis by
  activating caspase-8 which in turn either initiates the type 1 extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway by activating downstream effector caspase-3 or the type 2 extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway by truncation of Bid. DET and IDET induce intrinsic apoptosis by dissipating
  mitochondrial membrane potential and modulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins
  which results in the activation of caspase-3. Subsequently, activated caspase-3
  leads to apoptosis by substrate cleavage. DET activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and p38 and inhibits the activation of Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). DET inhibits the activation of extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and activates
  caspase-9 and induces apoptosis; ├ Inhibition, ↑ Up-regulation, ↓ Down-regulation.
