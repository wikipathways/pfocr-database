caption: Overview of metabolic adaptations in cancer cells. Cancer cells exhibit distinct
  metabolic alterations to support their growth and survival. This illustration elucidates
  the key pathways and mechanisms involved. Cancer cells acquire FAs through de novo
  lipogenesis (where FAs are synthesized within the cell) and exogenous uptake (wherein
  FAs are absorbed from the tumor microenvironment, facilitated by transporters like
  CD36, FATPs, and FABPpm). Once inside, FAs are primarily stored in lipid droplets.
  These FAs can be metabolized to produce NADPH and acetyl-CoA via the β-oxidation
  process. Cancer cells metabolize glucose, glutamine, and acetate as primary substrates
  to produce citrate. Citrate is converted into palmitate through enzymatic reactions
  catalyzed by ACLY, ACC, and FASN. Subsequently, palmitate undergoes various modifications
  like desaturation and elongation, resulting in a diverse range of lipid species.
  Instead of the traditional pathway that leads to palmitoleate production, an alternative
  route exists where palmitate is desaturated to yield sapienate, primarily through
  the action of the FADS2 enzyme. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACSS2, acyl-CoA synthetase
