caption: 'Analysis of changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome according to DNK72
  treatment in patient derived glioblastoma cells. (A) In the GSEA EnrichmentMap,
  leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein expression was positively correlated
  with the cancer and cell cycle pathway, the RNA-processing associated pathway, and
  the mitochondria-associated pathway. On the other hand, LRRK2 protein expression
  was negatively correlated with the FGFR/TP53 pathway. (B) The protein pathway analysis
  showed that treatment of LRRK2-positive 448T cells with DNK72 resulted in a significant
  decrease in phosphorylation sites involved in various cellular functions, suggesting
  that LRRK2 may play a role in regulation stemness through multiple pathways. FDR:
  false discovery rate, NES: normalized enrichment score, CNS: central nervous system'
