caption: Antitumor mechanism of cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS-STING signaling exerts antitumor
  functions in cancer cells in an autonomous and non-autonomous manner. On the one
  hand, OIS secretes SASP in response to oncogenic stimuli to prevent cell proliferation,
  and activation of the STING signaling pathway in tumor cells may also promote apoptosis
  in tumor cells. On the other hand, STING activation in tumor cells promotes downstream
  type I IFN transcription and allows cross-talk between tumor and neighboring immune
  cells to modulate antitumor immunity. DCs can capture tumor-associated antigens
  and subsequently initiate tumor-killing by CD8+ T cells. Macrophages can produce
  TNF-α and express high levels of CxCl10, CxCl11, NOS2 and other molecules. Stromal
  cells can also be effective against tumor angiogenesis by expressing IFN-β. Created
