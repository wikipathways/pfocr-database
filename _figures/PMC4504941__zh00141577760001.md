caption: Molecular mechanisms of cardioprotection provoked by netrin-1 and netrin-1-derived
  small peptides. Netrin-1 or netrin-1-derived small peptides interact with their
  receptor DCC, leading to activation of ERK1/2 and eNOS, which increases production
  of NO, resulting in cardioprotection. NO downregulates SIAH, an E3 ligase for DCC,
  leading to reduced degradation of DCC by inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. This positive feedback mechanism augments cardioprotective signaling of
  netrin-1 and netrin-1-derived peptides by accumulation of the DCC receptor. At the
  same time, NO induced by netrin-1 or netrin-1-derived peptides also attenuates I/R
  injury by downregulation of NOX4, resulting in prevention of NOX4-dependent eNOS
  uncoupling and preservation of mitochondrial function, all of which contribute to
  cardioprotection. Cardioprotective pathways are highlighted in blue and myocardial
  ischemia-stress pathways in red.
