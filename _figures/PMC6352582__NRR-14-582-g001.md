caption: 'Link between cholesterol deregulation and programmed cell death mechanisms.Chronic
  impaired cholesterol synthesis due to mutations in enzymes of the metabolic pathway,
  as occur in MKD or SLOS, causes a dysfunction of mitochondria. Organelles suffer
  from alterations of metabolism, mainly due to accumulation of ROS, that induce modifications
  of the morphology with shrunken shape and condensed cristae. Damaged mitochondria
  are usually removed by autophagy mechanisms, but accumulation of damaged organelles
  or mutations in such mechanism (as occur in NPC) cause a failed clearance with further
  accumulation of damaged mitochondria. As effect of this accumulation, the cell is
  driven toward programmed cell death. Caspase 8 is recognized as a modulator of the
  different fates of the cell: its activation leads to apoptosis or pyroptosis via
  NLRP3 inflammosome formation; when inactive or partially activated, it allows the
  formation of necroptosome consisting in RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL complex. 7DHC: 7-Dehydrocholesterol;
