caption: The pathway of sinapate ester biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Multiple steps
  are required for the conversion of Phe to sinapic acid via p-coumaroyl-CoA. The
  enzymes required for the synthesis of sinapate esters in developing seeds are SGT
  and SCT. Upon germination, sinapoylcholinesterase (SCE) catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of seed reserves of sinapoylcholine, and SGT and SMT convert the released sinapate
  into sinapoylmalate. SST catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of sinapoyl-Glc
  to 1,2-disinapoyl-Glc and compound 1, a biosynthetic route that is predominant in
  etiolated seedlings. Dashed arrows indicate one possible route to the biosynthesis
  of compound 1, a reaction dependent upon SST. The action of SAT is required for
  the sinapoylation of Arabidopsis anthocyanins. Double arrows proceeding from p-coumaroyl-CoA
  indicate the biosynthesis of the cyanidin derivative via flavonoid metabolism and
  the subsequent acylation of the anthocyanin, presumably by a p-coumaroyl-CoA-dependent
  acyltransferase. This biosynthetic pathway yields one possible substrate for SAT,
  3-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)
  cyanidin (A5; nomenclature from ), sinapoylation of which would result in the production
  of 3-O-[6-O-(4-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-p-coumaroyl)-2-O-(2-O-sinapoyl-β-d-xylopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl]-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl)
  cyanidin (A11).
