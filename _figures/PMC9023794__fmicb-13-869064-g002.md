caption: HSV1 manipulates the necroptosis pathway in a species-specific manner. Triggering
  of necroptosis via several upstream signaling pathways is dependent on the activation
  of the RHIM-containing protein RIPK3 which, in turn, mediates MLKL oligomerization
  and translocation to the plasma membrane resulting pore formation and ultimately
  cell death (see text). HSV1 manipulates the necroptosis pathway through virus-encoded
  ICP6 RHIM-mediated interaction with RHIM-containing host proteins, but the outcome
  of this interaction results in species-specific outcomes. In HSV1-infected human
  cells, ICP6 acts as a RHIM competitive inhibitor and restricts necroptosis by sequestering
  RIPK3 from its cellular partners ZBP1 and RIPK1. In contrast, ICP6 expression in
  HSV1-infected mouse cells results in ICP6 RHIM dependent recruitment of RIPK3 that
  drives necroptosis. HSV1 infection triggers RIPK3-mediated necroptosis via ZBP1
  sensing z-form RNA in both human and mouse cells.

  description: HSV1 manipulates the necroptosis pathway in a species-specific manner.
    Triggering of necroptosis via several upstream signaling pathways is dependent

    contrast, ICP6 expression in HSV1-infected mouse cells results in ICP6 RHIM dependent
