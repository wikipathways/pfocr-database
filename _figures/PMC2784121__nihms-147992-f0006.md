caption: In ALCL cells, the TCR signalling pathway is non-functional, since NPM-ALK
  suppresses through STAT3 the expression of CD3ε, ZAP70, SLP76 and LAT by transcriptional
  repression and epigenetic silencing. In the absence of TCR signalling, the activated
  phenotype of ALCL cells, as well as their cytoskeletal rearrangements, survival
  and proliferation, could be sustained by the activation of the Rho family GTPases.
  Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases are activated by an ALK-dependent VAV1 and VAV3 phosphorylation
  (, ).
