caption: NAD+ is synthesized in the cell through the kynurenine/de novo biosynthetic
  pathway using quinolinic acid as a primary precursor. Cells also possess additional
  systems for producing NAD+ from alternative precursors. The Priess-Handler pathway
  generates NAD+ from nicotinic acid (NA) while the salvage pathway generates NAD+
  from nicotinamide riboside (NR). Invertebrates recycle NAM generated from consuming
  NAD+ through the Priess-Handler pathway, while mammals recycle NAM through the salvage
  pathway. NAD+ regulates a variety of cellular process that modulates mitochondrial
  morphology, fitness, and function, which in turn impacts downstream processes including
  as cell death, proteostasis and DNA repair.
