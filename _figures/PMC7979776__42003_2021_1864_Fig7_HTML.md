caption: a, b Diagrams show LDB3 – filamin C – CASA complex interactions at skeletal
  muscle Z-disc relevant to MFM pathogenesis. LDB3 binds to the mechanosensor Ig 17–21
  repeats (orange) in filamin C where the binding sites for the MFM-associated proteins
  BAG3 and myotilin, as well as a myopathy-associated integrin complex have been identified,,.
  LDB3 binds to myotilin and PKCα, which regulates filamin C stability through phosphorylation
  (P)–,. LDB3 interacts with HSPA8, a BAG3 partner that together with the MFM-associated
  HSPB8 chaperone degrades damaged filamin C through CASA pathway (adapted from).
  BAG3 cooperates with the HSPA8-associated ubiquitin ligase STUB1 and its partner
  UBE2D in the ubiquitination of chaperone-bound filamin C, which is recognized by
  sequestosome-1 leading to lysosomal disposal. These interactions are unaffected
  by the MFM-associated LDB3 p.Ala165Val mutation. c Model of LDB3 p.Ala165Val mutation
  effects on the integrity of LDB3 – filamin C – CASA complex interactome under mechanical
  strain. The activity of each protein and interaction is presented with color, blue
  for decrease and red for increase. An arrow indicates an activation, a bar at the
  end of an edge indicates an inhibitory interaction. A downward arrow within a box
  indicates decrease in the protein levels. Under normal conditions, LDB3 enables
  PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of filamin C and other interacting proteins at the
  Z-disc and protects these proteins from proteolysis by calpains. The CASA pathway
  constantly operates at the Z-disc mediating degradation of large cytoskeleton components
  including filamin C damaged during mechanical strain. The CASA activity depends
  on local mTORC1 inhibition through BAG3-recruited TSC2:TSC1 signaling. PKCα is modulated
  by TSC2-mTORC2 signaling and the kinase may regulate mTOR assemblies including spatial
  localization (dashed lines)–. The LDB3 p.Ala165Val downregulates PKCα and TSC2-mTOR,
  two signaling proteins monitoring the integrity of the Z-disc assembly. Decreased
  PKCα promotes proteolysis by calpains leading to aggregation of damaged proteins.
  Reduced TSC2-mTOR together with increased strain on capacity of degradation pathway
  leads to impaired CASA function aggravating damaged protein aggregation, eventually
  leading to the Z-disc disassembly and myofibrillar disruption.
