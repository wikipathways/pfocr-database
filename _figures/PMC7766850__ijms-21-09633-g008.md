caption: Scheme of the effects of AMPAR antagonists on spontaneous seizure activity
  in epilepsy rats based on a previous [] and the present studies. In epilepsy rats,
  GluN2B Y1472 and CREB phosphorylations may be increased by multiple signaling pathways,
  such as protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and cyclin-dependent kinase
  5 (CDK5). In addition, Src-CK2 axis may be inhibited as a compensatory response
  to the decreased PTEN expression via unknown mechanisms. However, this adaptive
  response may be insufficient to abrogate the hyper-phosphorylations of GluN2B and
  CREB. In responders, perampanel and GYKI 52,466 may further decrease Src-CK2 activity,
  which leads to increased PTEN activity (dephosphorylation) concomitant with its
  upregulation. Subsequently, the elevated PTEN activity may dephosphorylate GluN2B
  Y1472 and CREB S133 site that facilitate GRIA1 surface expression, concomitant with
  downregulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT1 signaling pathway. These
  phenomena are not observed in non-responders and the dipotassium bisperoxovanadium(pic)
  dihydrate (BpV(pic), a PTEN inhibitor)-treated animals. Therefore, the present study
  demonstrates that this Src/CK2/PTEN-mediated GluN2B and CREB regulation may be required
  for the anti-epileptic effects of AMPAR antagonists.
