caption: 'Transepithelial transport processes and regulatory mechanisms in type A
  intercalated cells (A-IC) and type B intercalated cells (B-IC). This cartoon illustrates
  the major transport proteins expressed in the three main epithelial cell types present
  in the collecting duct: the principal cell, which expresses the epithelial sodium
  channel; the acid-secreting type A-IC; and type B-IC, which secretes bicarbonate
  while reabsorbing NaCl. In the cortical and outer medullary collecting duct, type
  A-ICs express H+-ATPase and the H+/K+-ATPase at the apical/luminal membrane, while
  they express the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger AE1 at their basolateral membrane. The bicarbonate
  sensor soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) and protein kinase A (PKA) play important
  roles in the regulation of the H+-ATPase (see ). Slc26a11 (A11), an electrogenic
  Cl− transporter, as well as a Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger, are also expressed at the
  apical membrane of the type A-IC. On the other hand, the type B-ICs display an electroneutral
  NaCl transport/reabsorption pathway at their apical membrane that involves pendrin,
  a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, and the Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (NDCBE). The proposed
  basolateral Na+ extrusion pathway would involve the cotransporter Slc4a9 (AE4).
  The mechanism of Cl− exit remains to be elucidated. In type B-ICs, reabsorption
  of NaCl from the lumen is energized by the basolateral H+-ATPase rather than by
  Na+/K+-ATPase.'
