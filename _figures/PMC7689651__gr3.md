caption: The biogenesis of cobalamin.(a) The biosynthesis of cobalamin from the common
  tetrapyrrole primogenitor uroporphyrinogen III involves in excess of twenty steps.
  Although there are two pathways for the synthesis of cobalamin, referred to as the
  aerobic (or cobalt-late) and anaerobic (cobalt early) routes, the series of methylation,
  amidation and rearrangement reactions are broadly similar and these steps are highlighted.
  The cobalt-insertion steps are also shown, with the cobalt-early insertion shown
  on the left hand side and the cobalt-late insertion stage shown on the right hand
  side. (b) The modifications that are associated with the cobalt-late pathway are
  highlighted and cross-referenced with (a). The Figure highlights the extensive modification
  that take place during the biogenesis of cobalamin.
