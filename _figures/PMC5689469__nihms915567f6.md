caption: Proposed mechanism of muscle immaturity in CDM. Large repeat expansion since
  the embryonic stage causes hypermethylation at the CTCF-I site and reduction of
  CTCF binding at the DMPK locus. The reduction of CTCF binding promotes alternative
  sense transcription and suppresses antisense transcription and production of short
  CAG-repeat RNA that neutralizes CUGexp, resulting in enhanced RNA toxicity by CUGexp.
  Enhanced RNA toxicity causes activation of PKR and induction of ER stress and provokes
  NF-κB activation, thereby leading to activation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  The upregulation of IL-6 and its target genes contributes to muscle immaturity in
  CDM.
