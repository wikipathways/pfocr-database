caption: 'The antineoplastic mechanism of procyanidins. Notes: (1). Procyanidins can
  inhibit cell proliferation by phosphorylated IGF-1R, which can activate cysteine
  proteases and accelerate the degradation of activated Nrf2. (2). B2G2 can inhibit
  stem cell self-renew process through inhibiting the activitation of Notch1 pathway.
  (3). GSP can reverse MDR by suppressing both MAPK/ERK/YB-1 and NF-κB p65 pathway.
  (4). PC1 inhibits EMT by inhibiting TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad-2, and
  further down-regulates Snail, E-cadherin and fibronectin. (5). HEX can inhibit PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β
  and PI3K/Akt/Bad signaling pathways, and induce the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
  of cancer cells. In addition, PCB2 also plays an anti-proliferative role and stimulates
  apoptosis, induces autophagy of cancer cells through the Akt/mTOR pathway. Abbreviation:
  IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; B2G2, B2 3;3″-di-O-gallate; MDR,
  multidrug resistance; GSP, grape seed procyanidins; P-gp, p-glycoprotein; YB-1,
