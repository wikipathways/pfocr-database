caption: Sirt1 determined the switch of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) differentiation
  into M1 or M2 MDSCs. In MDSCs, Sirt1 deficiency directs a specific switch to the
  M1 lineage when cells enter the periphery from bone marrow, decreasing suppressive
  function in favour of a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype with more NO, tumour necrosis
  factor-α and IL-12. Glycolytic activation through the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR)-HIF1α pathway was required for differentiation to the M1 phenotype, which
  conferred higher tumoricidal activity.
