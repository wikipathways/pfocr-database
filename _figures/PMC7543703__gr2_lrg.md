caption: NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins that protect against COVID-19.
  Arachidonic acid is converted to the prostaglandins and thromboxanes by the action
  of cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2. Of the four prostaglandins, PGE2 and PGI2 promote
  optimal renal function by dilating afferent renal arterioles and promoting natriuresis
  in normal conditions, with PGI2-mediated Na+ and H2O reabsorption seen more evidently
  in unhealthy individuals with reduced renal perfusion. When NSAIDs like ibuprofen
  or naproxen are taken continuously, the net effects of COX inhibition are (1) increased
  Na+ and H2O reabsorption, (2) reduced renal afferent arteriolar dilatation, (3)
  reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and (4) an increase in systemic vascular
  resistance. Due to reduced GFR and renal perfusion, the body produces greater amounts
  of angiotensin II (Ang II) to increase blood flow via increased plasma volume. However,
  increased Ang II levels leads to inappropriate vasoconstriction and increased systemic
  vascular resistance, which may ultimately result in a vicious cycle due to feedback
  compensation from Ang II in susceptible patients. Subsequently, an upregulation
  of ACE2 expression is expected to counteract Ang II providing its catabolic pathway
  to produce vasodilator and natriuretic angiotensins (1-7). This compensatory increase
  in ACE2 expression from NSAID intake, which is aggravated in unhealthy individuals
  such as those with hypertension, is the proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can
  more aggressively infect the cell, by binding to greater amounts of ACE2 for viral
  entry. The concomitant immunosuppression by NSAIDs also promotes viral replication
  and shedding of SARS-CoV2, which can complicate the early phases of COVID-19.
