caption: 'Schemes for signaling control by receptor binding to three different HA
  sizes. The extracellular (vertical ovals) and transmembrane (yellow) domains of
  imaginary HA receptors 1–3 (HAR-1, tan; HAR-2, gray; HAR-3, purple) are connected
  across the membrane (black) to signaling-active (light or dark green) or-inactive
  (red) CDs (small ovals); signal transduction pathways are active (green arrows)
  or inactive (green arrows with X). Two signaling pathways are shown: a “response-to-disruption”
  pathway (dark green, top) senses smaller HA that indicates degradation or loss of
  normal MDa HA; a “stable-external-contact” pathway (light green, bottom) establishes
  and senses normal interfaces between cell surface and external HA. Free HA (blue)
  near a HAR indicates excess HA is present. (A) HAR-1 and HAR-2 (middle row) are
  normally not bound to HA; they are quiescent, not signaling. (B) Both receptors
  bind to oligo HA (e.g., 10 kDa, small blue lines) for a fraction of the time (i.e.,
  low affinity, high Kd values); HAR-1•HA, but not HAR-2•HA, initiates signaling if
  binding creates external conformational changes that also alter the internal CD
  to activate signaling. (C) The equilibrium wheel (A,C,D) shows that transition-size
  HA (200 kDa; multiple blue-line shapes) is neither solely a rod nor a coil because
  both conformations are energetically equivalent (Keq for these conformational reactions
  is ~1). The same HA chain can spend time as a rod, a coil or an intermediate with
  different intramolecular sections showing both characteristics. Excess transition-size
  HA binds stably (i.e., high affinity, low Kd values) so all HAR-1•HA and HAR-2•HA
  complexes are monomeric. HAR-1•HA signals if external conformational changes with
  this size HA creates CD changes needed to activate signaling. In contrast, monomeric
  HAR-2•HA cannot activate signaling. (D) Two HAR-2 proteins can physically bind to
  the same 200 kDa HA, in a self -titrating manner as noted in Discussion, to create
  tri- or oligomeric HAR-2•HA•HAR-2 complexes. In close proximity, the two CDs bind
  and undergo conformational changes that activate signaling (indicated by altered
  CD positioning). The same proximity of HAR-1 CDs occurs with 200 kD HA but may not
  activate signaling. (E) If limiting MDa HA (large blue-line ball) is presented to
  unbound (A) or occupied receptors (D), it binds, or displaces smaller HA, respectively,
  creating trimeric HAR•HA•HAR complexes in which receptor CDs are not spatially close
  and do not interact. HAR-2•HA•HAR-2 is inactive since the CDs do not interact. HAR-1•HA•HAR-1
  could still be active, if the bound HA supports conformational changes needed for
  transmembrane-CD activation and signaling. (F) Trimeric HAR•HA•HAR with 200 kDa
  HA (D, dashed arrow) or MDa HA (E) can be disrupted by excess oligo HA to generate
  monomeric receptor complexes (F) that can be signaling competent or incompetent.
  (G) Excess MDa HA could displace oligo HA (F) or 200 kDa HA (D) or bind to free
  HAR (A) to generate monomeric HAR•HA complexes that are typically not activated
  to signal, at least in the “response-to-disruption” sensing pathways that respond
  to nonMDa HA. (H) MDa HA does not activate “response-to-disruption” signaling because
  it is normally in the environment of tissue cells; rather HAR-3 is always bound
  to MDa HA and activated in “stable-external-contact” signaling pathways. Degradation
  of bound MDa HA or its displacement by oligo (I) or 200 kDa HA (J) inactivates these
  latter pathways and may or may not activate “response-to-disruption” signaling.
  Additional details are in the text. HAR-2 signaling behavior upon binding oligo,
  transition-size or MDa HA (B, D or E) is similar to that of HARE ().'
