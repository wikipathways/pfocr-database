caption: Signal transduction by flagellin in mammalian cells. Immune cells respond
  to extracellular monomeric flagellin through either TLR5 homodimer or heterodimer
  complexes, resulting in the transcription of a variety of genes that are important
  for the proper stimulation of immune cells. Signaling through TLR5 occurs through
  a MyD88-dependent adapter molecule that passes the signal to the MAPK and IkB cascades
  via IRAK, TRAF6 and TAK1. The MAPK and IkB cascades result in the induction of transcription
  factors AP-1 and NF-kB, respectively. These two transcription factors induce a variety
  of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. Signaling through TLR5/TLR4 is
  MyD88-independent and occurs via the IRF3 pathway, which results in the production
  of IFN-β. Subsequently, IFN-β induces iNOS gene transcription through the activation
  of STAT1, which culminates in the production of NO. However, when intracellular
  flagellin is introduced into the host cell cytoplasm via the type III secretory
  system by some bacteria, it is detected by NLRC4, which culminates in the secretion
  of IL-1 β via active caspase-1. AP-1, Activator protein-1; GRO, growth-related oncogene;
  hBD, human beta defensins; IRF3, interferon response factor 3; IRAK, IL-1 receptor
  associated kinase; LRR, leucine-rich repeats; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation factor 88; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor ‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer’ of activated B cells; PYR, pyrin domain; TAK1,
  transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1; TBK1. TANK-binding-kinase-1;
  TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF6, TNF receptor associated factor 6; TRIF, TIR domain
  containing adapter inducing interferon-β STAT1, signal transducer and activator
