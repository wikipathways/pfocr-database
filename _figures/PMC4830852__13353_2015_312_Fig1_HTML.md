caption: The role of proteins encoded by genes analyzed in this study in the inhibition
  of the Wnt signaling. The secreted Frizzled-related proteins sFRP1 and sFRP2 are
  receptors for secreted Wnt proteins, as well as other ligands. The interaction between
  sFRPs and Wnt proteins prevents the latter from binding the Frizzled receptors (Pannone
  et al. ). The Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 encoded by the DKK1 gene acts also at the cell
  membrane level through binding the Frizzled co-receptor LRP, causing its internalization
  (Zhou et al. ). The protein encoded by the PPP2R2B gene is a part of the β-catenin
  degrading complex (Tan et al. ). The last two proteins encoded by the SOX17 and
  DACH1 genes act as transcription factors inhibiting the expression of the Wnt pathway
  target genes. SOX17 also degrades β-catenin independently of the degrading complex
  (Sinner et al. ), while DACH1 inhibits the expression of the Frizzled receptor protein
  (Wu et al. ; Yan et al. )
papertitle: Wnt pathway antagonists, SFRP1, SFRP2, SOX17, and PPP2R2B, are methylated
  in gliomas and SFRP1 methylation predicts shorter survival.
