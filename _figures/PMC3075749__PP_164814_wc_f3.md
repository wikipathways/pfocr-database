caption: Simplified scheme illustrating how CO2 fixed to RuBP by Rubisco is distributed
  among the resulting two molecules of 3PGA that feed into the photosynthetic Calvin
  cycle to produce triose phosphates (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [G3P]) for carbohydrate
  synthesis or RuBP regeneration. The contrasting oxygenation reaction of Rubiscos
  produces 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG), which requires the photorespiratory pathway to
  recycle it back to 3PGA. Photorespiration is a complex pathway that involves four
  subcellular compartments and multiple enzymatic steps (represented by dashed lines),
  requires additional energy (ATP), and results in a loss of fixed CO2 in the mitochondria
  ().
