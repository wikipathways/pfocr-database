caption: Proposed B[a]P metabolic pathways and their representative metabolites. The
  radical cation pathway involves the activity of either P450 peroxidase or P450 monooxygenase;
  the diol epoxide pathway involves P450 and epoxide hydrolase; and the o-quinone
  pathway involves P450, epoxide hydrolase and AKR.
