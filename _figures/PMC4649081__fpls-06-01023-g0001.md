caption: A hypothesized model for nutrients signaling crosstalk with NO and ABA during
  seed germination. The figure highlights the action points of nitrate and glucose
  in NO and ABA signaling pathways controlling alleviation of seed dormancy and promotion
  of Arabidopsis seed germination. In the context of ABA-mediated inhibition of seedling
  establishment, NIA/NR- and AtNOA1-mediated pathways of NO biosynthesis function
  in an additive way. NO-deficient seedlings showed a higher basal and induced expression
  of ABA-responsive genes, conferring enhanced resistance to dehydration. In Arabidopsis,
  ABA 8′-hydroxylase encoded by CYP707A2 is implicated in NO-mediated ABA catabolism
  and seed dormancy break (). In the seed endosperm, group VII ERFs act as NO sensors
  and regulate ABI5 (ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5), highlighting as molecular players
  in NO-ABA crosstalk during seed germination (). NO nitrosylates ABI5 as a regulator
  to control ABA hormone signaling through its degradation (). AtGLR1.1 is a component
  of the HXK1-independent ABA pathway and can be expressed in presence of a N source
  such as nitrate or amino acids (Glu or Gln), promoting seed germination (; ). NR,
  nitrate reductase; NO, nitric oxide; ABA, abscisic acid; GAs, gibberellins; GA3ox1
  and GA3ox2, Gibberellic acid oxidase1 and 2; CYP707A2, Cytochrome P450 ABA 8′-hydroxylase;
  GLR1.1, putative glutamate receptor 1.1; TF, transcription factor.
