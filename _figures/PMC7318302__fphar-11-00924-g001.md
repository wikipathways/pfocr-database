caption: Schematic diagram of the correlation of Notch signaling pathway and ER in
  breast cancer endocrine resistance. ER is at the center of endocrine resistance
  observed in breast cancer cells. Notch signaling modulates endocrine therapy through
  cooperating with ER in a complex network as mentioned in some sections of this review.
  P, phosphorylation; M, mutation; →, promotion; ⊥, inhibition; ↔, receptor ligand-binding.
