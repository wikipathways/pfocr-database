caption: 'Metabolic engineering strategy of 2,3‐BDO production by co‐utilization of
  methane and glycerol using engineered M. alcaliphilum 20Z. Two pathways are proposed
  for glycerol utilization in methanotrophs, involving the GlpK‐GlpD route and the
  GlpA‐DhaK route. Glycerol crosses the cell membrane by passive diffusion or via
  a glycerol‐uptake facilitator (GlpF). In cells, glycerol is incorporated into central
  metabolism as dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a metabolite that can participate
  in both gluconeogenic and glycolytic processes. Both pathways were constructed in
  a pAWP89 vector under control of the Ptac promoter. For 2,3‐BDO production, three‐gene
  cluster budABC encoding acetolactate decarboxylase (BudA), acetolactate synthase
  (BudB) and acetoin reductase (BudC) were integrated into the chromosome of M. alcaliphilum
  20Z under control of Ptac promoter. Ru5P: ribulose 5‐phosphate, H6P: hexulose 6‐phosphate,
  F6P: fructose 6‐phosphate, KDPG: 2‐keto‐3‐deoxy 6‐phosphogluconate, F1,6BP: fructose
  1,6‐bisphosphate, DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, G3P: glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate,
