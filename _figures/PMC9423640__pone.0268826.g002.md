caption: '(A) KEGG pathway enrichment. PAX4 and HNF4A genes were significantly enriched
  in the maturity onset diabetes of the young. (B and C) HNF4A and PAX4 are each linked
  to different potential drugs. Green node: the drug decreases the key gene expression;
  and red node: the drug increases the expression of the key gene.'
