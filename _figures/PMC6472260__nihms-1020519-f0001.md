caption: Overview of the extracellular ISG15 signaling pathway and the basis of synergism
  with IL-12 signaling in Natural Killer cells. IL-12 engages the IL-12 receptor to
  induce signaling that leads to transcriptional activation of INFG, encoding IFN-γ.
  The IFN-γ is packaged into secretory vesicles. Extracellular ISG15 binds to the
  CD11a/αL integrin component of the LFA-1 receptor (a heterodimer of CD11a/αL and
  CD18/β2);the interaction is mediated by determinants on the C-terminal ubiquitin-like
  domain of ISG15 and the aα domain of CD11a. Src Family Kinases (SFKs), which include
  Lyn, Hck, and Fgr in NK cells, are rapidly activated in response to ISG15-LFA-1
  engagement, as detected by autophosphorylation of the SFKs. This leads to downstream
  signaling events (so far uncharacterized) that lead to enhanced secretion of IFN-γ.
  Similarly, IL-12 and ISG15 also act synergistically to promote the expression and
  secretion of IL-10 (not shown).
