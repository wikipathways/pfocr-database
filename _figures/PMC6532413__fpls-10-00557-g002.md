caption: Putative roles for COP1 in the plant’s ethylene signaling pathway. During
  exposure to light, ethylene prevents degradation of EIN3 via EBF1/2. Increased EIN3
  levels promote the nuclear import of COP1. Nuclear localized COP1 reduces levels
  of the transcription factor HY5, thus supporting hypocotyl growth under the light
  in Arabidopsis. At the same time, the increased levels of COP1 in the nucleus can
  further weaken EBF1/2 and increase EIN3 levels (). COP1-mediated reduction in HY5
  levels prevents ABI5 accumulation, which relieves the salt stress inhibition of
  seed germination. COP1 effect on EIN3 can affect PORA/B expression promoting cotyledon
  greening upon light exposure. COP1 can also directly affect cotyledon greening in
  an ethylene independent manner.
