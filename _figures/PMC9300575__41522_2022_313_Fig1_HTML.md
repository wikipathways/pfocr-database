caption: Four littermates were cohabitated for 1 week before splitting into high fiber
  (HF) and low fiber (LF) littermate pairs. After 1 week, GI content was investigated
  with ABPP and multi-omics analyses. A GH2c-ABP linked resin was used to enrich proteins
  with metabolic or transport activities for sugar moieties from the GI proteome.
  Enriched proteins were then identified and quantified using mass spectrometry. The
  gut metagenome for each mouse was obtained via shotgun sequencing. Metabolites were
  analyzed via mass spectrometry. Omics measurements for the HF and LF groups were
  then compared.

  enzymes involved in the bifidobacterium shunt pathway or mucin degradation in the
  gut microbiome response to soluble dietary fiber.
