caption: Regulation of AMPK by metabolic stress, LKB1, and intracellular Ca++. The
  AMPK signaling pathway responds to energy stresses that cause fluctuations and imbalances
  in the AMP/ATP (or ADP/ATP) ratio. As the ATP level falls, there is an increase
  in the AMP level, which triggers the activation of the AMPK pathway. The upstream
  regulator of AMPK, LKB1, allows for AMP phosphorylation at a specific site (Thr-172)
  on the α subunit of AMPK. Two other subunits, STRAD and MO25, form a complex with
  LKB1 to enhance this process. CaMKK, which is induced by an increase in intracellular
  Ca++, is also able to activate AMPK. Of the CaMKK proteins, CaMKKβ has the strongest
  regulatory effect on AMPK. CaMKKβ regulates AMPK in response to changes in surrounding
  energy stresses.ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine

  description: Regulation of AMPK by metabolic stress, LKB1, and intracellular Ca++.
    The AMPK signaling pathway responds to energy stresses that cause fluctuations
    and imbalances in the AMP/ATP (or ADP/ATP) ratio. As the ATP level falls, there
    is an increase in the AMP level, which triggers the activation of the AMPK pathway.
    The upstream regulator of AMPK, LKB1, allows for AMP phosphorylation at a specific
    site (Thr-172) on the α subunit of AMPK. Two other subunits, STRAD and MO25, form
    a complex with LKB1 to enhance this process. CaMKK, which is induced by an increase
