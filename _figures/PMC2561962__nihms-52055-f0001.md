caption: Ischemia induces cell death by several distinct pathways, and Hsp70 reduces
  all of these. Arrows indicate increased activity or amount while the barred ends
  indicate steps that are blocked or reduced when Hsp70 is overexpressed. These do
  not indicate direct protein-protein interactions in many cases, see text for details.
  Fas and the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) are transmembrane receptors with
  intracellular death domains that can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8 via
  a pathway including Tumor Necrosis Factor Associated Factor (TRAF). Cyt C = cytochrome
  c, casp = caspase, JNK = c Jun N terminal Kinase, Akt=PKB, Apaf-1=apoptosis protease
  activating factor 1, ROS=reactive oxygen species, AIF=apoptosis inducing factor;
  Smac/DIABLO is a mitochondrial protein which upon release neutralizes the caspase
  inhibitory effects of inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic
  protein, Bax a proapoptotic member of the same family.
