caption: Biosynthetic Pathway and Regulation of Ethylene.The formation of S-AdoMet
  is catalyzed by SAM synthetase from the methionine at the expense of one molecule
  of ATP per molecule of S-AdoMet synthesized. S-AdoMet is the methyl group donor
  for many cellular molecules (Methylated Acceptors), including nucleic acids, proteins,
  and lipids. In addition, S-AdoMet is the precursor of the polyamine synthesis pathway
  (Spermidine/Spermine biosynthesis pathway). ACC is the immediate precursor of ethylene.
  The rate-limiting step of ethylene synthesis is the conversion of S-AdoMet to ACC
  by ACC synthase under most conditions. MTA is the by-product generated along with
  ACC production by ACC synthase. Recycling of MTA back to methionine conserves the
  methylthio group and is able to maintain a constant concentration of cellular methionine
  even when ethylene is rapidly synthesized. Malonylation of ACC to malonyl-ACC (MACC)
  deprives the ACC pool and reduces the ethylene production. ACC oxidase catalyses
  the final step of ethylene synthesis using ACC as substrate and generates carbon
  dioxide and cyanide. Transcriptional regulation of both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase
  is indicated by dashed arrows. Reversible phosphorylation of ACC synthase is hypothesized
  and may be induced by unknown phosphatases (Ptase) and kinases, the latter presumably
  activated by stresses. Both native and phosphorylated form (ACC synthase-Pi) of
  ACC synthase are functional, although the native ACC synthase may be less stable
  or active in vivo. A hypothetical inhibitor is associated with ACC synthase at the
  carboxyl end and may be dissociated from the enzyme if it is modified by phosphorylation
  at the vicinity.
