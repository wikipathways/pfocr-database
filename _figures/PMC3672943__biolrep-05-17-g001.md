caption: A simplified schematic of Hippo, TGF-β and WNT pathway interactions is shown.
  Each of the indicated pathways converge on transcriptional modulators that act in
  the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes by interacting with DNA-binding
  partners, a selection of which are indicated (lowest cluster). Extensive physical
  interactions between Smads, β-catenin and TAZ/YAP (nuclear halo of components) describe
  a network of extensive crosstalk that provides for contextual transcriptional responses.
  In the presence of Hippo pathway activity, TAZ/YAP are sequestered in the cytosol,
  where they limit both TGF-β and WNT-β-catenin activity.
