caption: Biodegradable magnesium-based implants inhibit osteoclast differentiation
  through multiple mechanisms. First, magnesium ions (Mg2+) promote the binding of
  OPG secreted by osteoblasts to RANKL during material degradation, competitively
  inhibiting the binding of RANK to RANKL. Second, the alkaline environment generated
  by the degradation of magnesium-based materials further inhibits the binding of
  RANK and RANKL and reduces the formation of osteoclasts. In addition, magnesium
  ions inhibit the activation of inflammatory factors (such as TNF-α), affect the
  expression of downstream signalling molecules (such as JNK, ERK, NF-κB and AP-1),
  reduce the expression of NFATc1 and inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Finally,
  magnesium ions (Mg2+) significantly inhibit calcium ion (Ca2+) influx, thereby inhibiting
  osteoclast differentiation by inactivating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activated
  T nuclear factor c1 (NFATc1) signalling pathways
