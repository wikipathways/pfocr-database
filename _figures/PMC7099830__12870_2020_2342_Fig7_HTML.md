caption: The working model of PpSnRK1α regulating salt tolerance through the ABA signal
  transduction pathway and ROS mechanism. In the current working model, PpSnRK1α-overexpression
  improves the transcription levels of SOD, POD, and CAT1 as well as SOD, POD and
  CAT activity, reduces ROS production in plant cells. PpSnRK1α is involved in the
  ABA signaling pathway by altering the transcription levels of ABA receptors (SlPYL4,
  SlPYL8), PP2C (SlPP2C37) and SlSnRK2s, and thereby leads to an increase in tolerance
  to salt stress in tomato. Additionally, PpSnRK1α-overexpression increases the expression
  of SlNAC022, which has been proved to participate in ABA signaling transcription
