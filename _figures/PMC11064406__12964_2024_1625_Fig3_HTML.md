caption: Intracellular copper distribution pathways. The intracellular copper metabolism
  signaling pathway involves a sequence of events starting with the reduction of extracellular
  Cu(II) to Cu(I), which is then transported into the cell via the CTR1. Once inside,
  Cu(I) associates with the copper chaperone for CCS and SOD1, facilitating its distribution
  to various subcellular compartments. Additionally, Cu(I) interacts with ATOX1, predominantly
  directing it to ATP7A and ATP7B, for transport to the Golgi apparatus. A minor portion
  of Cu(I) binds to transcription factors in the nucleus, influencing gene expression.
  Cu(I) also binds to COX17 and is transported to CCO in mitochondria, contributing
  to the oxidative phosphorylation process. Surplus Cu(I) is expelled from the cell
  through ATP7A/B on the plasma membrane
