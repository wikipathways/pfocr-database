caption: Model for the role of Nle in hematopoietic cells. In HSCs/MPPs, Nle is absolutely
  required for proper 60S subunit biogenesis. In the absence of Nle, the pathway is
  impaired and the pre-60S subunit accumulates within the nucleus. In more committed
  progenitors and differentiated cells, an Nle-independent pathway is active and allows
  the production of the 60S subunit in absence of Nle.
papertitle: Notchless-dependent ribosome synthesis is required for the maintenance
  of adult hematopoietic stem cells.
