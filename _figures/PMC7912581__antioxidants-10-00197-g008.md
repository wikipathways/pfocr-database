caption: (A) Complex mechanism of FASIS and (B) GPR40 receptor part. FASIS is predominantly
  mediated by the GPR40 receptor. There are controversies over whether FAs bound to
  serum albumin and those cleaved by lipoprotein lipase can be transported into β-cells
  by FA transporter CD36 under fasting conditions. Such FA transport and cleavage
  of triglycerides (TG) to monoacylglycerols (MAG) and FA, however, take place when
  postprandial chylomicrons reach the rich capillaries of the pancreatic islets. MAG
  subsequently activates the metabotropic receptor GPR119, while long-chain FAs activate
  GPR40. The activations of both receptors lead to CaV-mediated action potential spikes
  and concomitant pulsatile insulin secretion. The canonical GPR119 signaling and
  biased GPR40 signaling leads to cAMP activation of the PKA and EPAC2 pathways with
  all the consequences described in the legends to  and . Our in vitro and in vivo
  experiments with mice (unpublished) demonstrated that approximately 2/3 of the GPR40
  response is given by the amplifying mechanism due to the mitochondrial phospholipase
  iPLA2γ/PNPLA8, similarly as in INS-1E cells []. The phospholipase iPLA2γ is directly
  activated by the elevated H2O2 in the mitochondrial matrix and cleaves both saturated
  and unsaturated FAs from the phospholipids of mitochondrial membranes. The cleaved
  free FAs diffuse up to the plasma membrane, where they activate GPR40. FASIS in
  iPLA2γ knockout mice or its isolated islets yields 30% insulin in the 1st fast phase
  of insulin secretion, compared to wt mice (Holendová et al., unpublished). This
  supports the existence of such an acute mechanism in vivo. Besides the GPR40 pathway,
  a portion of FASIS still results from FA β-oxidation, with a similar mechanism as
  was described for ketoacids (see the  legend). The difference lies in the several
  reaction turns during β-oxidation and a higher yield of FADH2/QH2 and AcCoA (and,
  of course ATP) from a single FA molecule. Theoretically, the stimulation of incretin
  receptors and PKA (and other kinase) pathways should also contribute to an amplification
  of responses to FAs. Nevertheless, the fraction of this contribution should be small
  due to a nearly overwhelming contribution of GPR40 and GPR119. Moreover, when FAs
  stimulate insulin secretion together with high glucose, the contribution of the
  so-called triglyceride/FA cycle, alternatively termed the glycerol-3-phosphate fatty
  acid cycle (G3P/FA cycle), also amplifies insulin secretion. This is provided by
  creating more ligands for the GPR40 and GPR119 receptor and by additional DAG signaling.
