caption: 'The elucidated mechanism of OMVs. (1) Mucosal responses: PAMPs on OMVs enable
  the innate immune system to recognize OMVs through PRRs on APCs, increasing IgA
  concentration (a sign of elevated mucosal immune responses). (2) Antigen presentation:
  APCs processes internalized OMVs. Stimulated APCs load OMVs-derived protein antigens
  as signal I onto MHC-II and then present them to TCR on T cells, while the B7 protein
  co-stimulator induces signal II by recognizing CD28. These ligands collaborate to
  provide the stimuli required for CD4+ T cell activation, including the main subsets,
  Th1 and Th17 cells. In addition, PAMPs on OMVs enhance the local IL-17A production,
  which also contributes to the occurrence of Th17 immune responses. (3) Cross-presentation:
  OMVs present antigens as a mixture of exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells to accelerate
  the DCs maturation and program them to perform antigen-specific cross-presentation
  via the MyD88 signalling pathway'
