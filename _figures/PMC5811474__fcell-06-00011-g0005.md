caption: Illustration of E3 ligases and DUBs that regulate TNF induced NF-κB pathway.
  TNFR signaling also results in the activation of cell survival via activation of
  NF-kB pathway by recruiting TRADD, TRAF1, and TRAF2, which further enroll RIP1 and
  c-IAP1/2. TRAF2 is very pivotal in activating the IKK complex (IKKα and IKKβ) and
  recruits it to the TNF-R1 complex upon phosphorylation of these proteins by TAK2/3
  proteins of TAK1 kinase complex. IKKα and IKKβ kinases, phosphorylate Ser32 and
  Ser36 in IκB isoforms (IκBα, IκBβ) that leads to their ubiquitin-dependent degradation
  and entry of NF-κB transcription factors p50, p65 (RelA) heterodimer into the nucleus
  upon activation leading to transcription of genes such as c-FLIP, c-IAP, Bcl-xL,
  Bcl-2 etc. Red oval indicates the E3 ligases and DUBs involved at various stages.
