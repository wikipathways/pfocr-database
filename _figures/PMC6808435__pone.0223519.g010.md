caption: Shikimate pathway gives the originator for Tyr as well as other AAA; trp
  and phe. Tyr can be assimilated into a protein that catabolized into TCA cycle;
  metabolized into vitamin E and plastoquinone; or various plant natural products.
  Synthesis of tyrosine shown by black arrows. Genes are shown in red color; regulation
  of genes in tyrosine metabolism are shown with red arrows. Abbreviations Trp, tryptophan;
  Phe, phenylalanine; Tyr, tyrosine; HPP, hydroxyphenylpyruvate; HGA, Homogentisate;
  TAT, tyrosine aminotransferase; AAT, aspartate aminotransferase; HPPD hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  dioxygenase; HGD, homogentisate dioxygenase; FAH, fumaryl acetoacetate hydroxylase;
  PPO, polyphenol oxidase.
