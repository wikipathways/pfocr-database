caption: The regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of MTHFD2 in cancer. The
  gene expression of MTHFD2 is transcriptionally regulated by various transcriptional
  factors and post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNAs. Extracellular stimuli
  may modulate MTHFD2 expression via mTORC1/ATF4 signaling pathway. The canonical
  role of MTHFD2 is converting one-carbon units for de novo purine synthesis. It may
  also involve in the production of redox equivalent (NADPH) for oxidative stress
  defense. In the nucleus, this enzyme may play a role in DNA replication, RNA processing
  and translation.
