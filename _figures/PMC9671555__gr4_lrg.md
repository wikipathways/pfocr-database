caption: Main components of RAAS pathway in SB CD (left) compared with non-IBD (right).
  We hypothesize that ACE2 reduction in CD leads to low SLC6A19 levels and hence,
  low tryptophan, tipping the balance towards inflammation and fibrosis axis. Restoration
  of ACE2 leads to homeostasis, which can be disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 virus uptake
  in COVID-19. AT1R, angiotensin 1 receptor; MAS, MAS receptor.
