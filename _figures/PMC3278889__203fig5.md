caption: T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling to NF-κB. TCR-induced NF-κB activation requires
  ligation of both the TCR and the associated coreceptor CD28. Signaling involves
  the formation of large supramolecular clusters at the interface of the T-cell and
  antigen-presenting cell (APC). In vivo TCR ligation occurs upon presentation of
  cognate antigen in MHC-I or MHC-II for CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively, by activated
  APCs expressing costimulatory molecules such as B7.1 or B7.2. Antigen:MHC complexes
  are engaged by T cells expressing somatically encoded antigen-specific TCRs. TCR:MHC
  binding is augmented by CD8:MHC-I or CD4:MHC-II interactions. ITAM motifs on CD3ζ
  are phosphorylated, leading to recruitment and activation of the ZAP70 kinase, which
  in turn activates PLCγ. Active PLCγ leads to DAG production. Coreceptor ligation
  involves recognition of B7 molecules on the APC surface by the TCR coreceptor CD28.
  CD28 ligation results in activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3.
  PDK1 binds PIP3 and undergoes autophosphorylation, revealing a PKC-binding site.
  DAG, in conjunction with PDK1-mediated recruitment and phosphorylation, leads to
  activation of the atypical PKC family member PKCθ. PKCθ () and perhaps also the
  related family members PKCɛ and PKCη () are selectively required for the activation
  of NF-κB downstream from TCR. In addition to activating PKCθ, PDK1 also facilitates
  the formation of a signaling complex (; ) in which PKCθ and potentially other kinases
  phosphorylate CARD11 (; ; ). Phosphorylation of CARD11 results in a structural change
  that allows the formation of the CARD11, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM) (; ) signaling complex.
  Recruitment of the IKK complex to the CBM through PKCθ () or ubiquitinated MALT1
  (), together with recruitment of the TAK1 complex, perhaps through TRAF6-mediated
  ubiquitination of BCL10 (), results in the activation of IKK and the NF-κB signaling
  pathway.
