caption: Bidirectional pathways within the MGBA concerning the pathogenesis of metabolic
  diseases. For the pathway from the gut to the brain, the intestinal microbiota secretes
  metabolites to promote the release of intestinal peptide hormones and neurotransmitters
  ,,, along with the conversion of bile acids. The conjugated bile acids are transferred
  from bile duct and combine the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in ileal enterocytes to
  be reabsorbed into the liver via circulation . These endocrine signals induced by
  microbiota could directly or indirectly maintain the peripheral metabolic homeostasis.
  Alternatively, intestinal microbiota-derived endocrine signals are associated with
  metabolic-related encephalic regions through the "enteroendocrine cells-enteric
  nervous system-vagus nerve" pathway ,. The molecular pathways via the arcuate nucleus
  (ARC), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the area postrema (AP) mainly control
  the balance of appetite, regulating the occurrence and development of obesity ,,,,,
  while these pathways could also regulate glucose uptake of the pancreas, liver through
  the autonomic nerve system (ANS) ,. Notably, the central insulin resistance, which
  has also been proven to be pathogeny of the T2DM ,, is also induced by the abnormal
  sensitivity or secretion of peripheral insulin initiated by intestinal microbiota
  or its metabolites . For the pathway from the brain to the gut, the anomalous ANS
  or HPA axis-derived signals could regulate the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, which
  is vital in the development of obesity ,. Interestingly, abnormal HPA axis signatures
  also contribute to hypercorticosteremia, which constitutes risk factors of obesity
  . Following studies could further investigate the relationship between hypercorticosteremia
  and the 'brain-microbiota-obesity' axis.
