caption: TAMs promote tumor immune evasion and drug resistance via the JAK/STAT3 signaling
  pathway. This figure illustrates how tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote
  immune evasion and drug resistance by secreting IL-10 and VEGF, which activate the
  JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in tumor cells. IL-10 activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway,
  inducing the expression of survival and angiogenesis-promoting genes such as Cyclin
  D1, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and VEGF, thereby enhancing tumor cell survival, proliferation,
  and immune evasion. VEGF secretion further promotes tumor angiogenesis, supporting
  tumor growth
