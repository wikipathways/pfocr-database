caption: Schematic representation of the effects of hrHPV on NFκB signaling. The canonical
  NFκB1 pathway is activated by PRRs and CD40 through TRAF6 and TNFR1 through RIP1.
  Poly-ubiquitination of TRAF6 and RIP1 recruits the TAB1-TAB2-TAK1 and IKK complexes
  resulting in the phosphorylation of IKKβ by TAK1. IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα, which
  is then ubiquitinated by SCF-βTrCP and subsequently degraded, and thereby releases
  the NFκB1 complex to translocate to the nucleus. CD40 and TNFR2 initiate non-canonical
  NFκB2 signaling by recruitment of TRAF2/5, cIAP1/2 and TRAF3 to the respective receptor,
  leading to TRAF3 degradation. This causes NIK to accumulate and activate IKKα to
  phosphorylate p100. This induces SCF-βTrCP to ubiquitinate p100, leading to the
  proteosomal processing of p100 into p52, and the subsequent nuclear translocation
  of NFκB2. In the nucleus NFκB binds to the DNA and is aided by coactivators to initiate
  gene transcription. HPV utilizes its own encoded E proteins (red) as well as exploits
  the cellular proteins (red) UCHL1 and IFRD1 to interfere with NFκB1 signaling at
  multiple positions in the pathway. Green circles indicate K63-linked poly-ubiquitin
  chains, red circles indicate K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, and blue circles
  indicate linear poly-ubiquitin chains.
