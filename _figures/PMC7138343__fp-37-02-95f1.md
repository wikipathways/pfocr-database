caption: 'The Heme Synthesis Pathway of Porphyria Cutanea TardeAbbreviations: ALA,
  alpha-linolenic acid; CoA, coenzyme A; ROS, reactive oxygen species; UROD, uroporphyrinogen
  decarboxylase. Hepatitis C and C282Y heterozygosity can decrease UROD activity and
  therefore decrease conversion of uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen, which in
  turn, can be oxidized in the presence of P450 1A2. Also, iron overload may increase
  oxidative stress (ROS) which can induce ALA synthase and increase the production
  of ALA, which in turn, may increase uroporphyrinogen production. Alcohol, smoking,
  chemicals, and estrogen also induce ALA synthase and increase production of uroporphyrinogen.'
