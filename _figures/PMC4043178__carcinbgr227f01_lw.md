caption: 'Mechanism of apoptosis induction in oncogenically transformed cells through
  signalling by surrounding cells (intercellular induction of apoptosis; reviewed
  in ref. ). Panel A: Three steps in the mechanism of intercellular induction of apoptosis
  and their representation in the model. In step 1, transformed cells trigger, through
  TGF-β signalling, the release of POD and NO· in neighbour cells, which thus become
  effector cells with respect to intercellular induction of apoptosis; also transformed
  cells themselves may serve as effector cells and release these species (dashed arrows).
  In step 2, a cascade of biochemical reactions occur between superoxide (O2 − ·)
  produced by transformed cells and POD and NO· released by effector cells, leading
  to production of ·OH in the vicinity of transformed cells. The two major pathways
  of the biochemical signalling cascade are depicted in detail in panel B; this work
  is focused on the HOCl pathway, highlighted in boldface. Finally, in step 3, the
  attacks of ·OH damage cellular membrane, which initiates an intracellular signalling
  pathway leading to apoptosis. In the model described in this paper, per-cell release
  rates of signalling species are considered in step 1, a set of reaction–diffusion
  equations is used to model step 2, and step 3 is represented by a non-linear kinetic
  model in which induction of apoptosis competes with cell proliferation.'
