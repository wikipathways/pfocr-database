caption: This schematic illustrates the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumor immune
  evasion and potential therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway. Wnt ligands
  bind to Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors, preventing the degradation of
  β-catenin by the destruction complex (Axin, APC, and GSK-3β). Stabilized β-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors
  to drive the expression of immune evasion genes, leading to reduced antigen presentation,
  increased Tregs, MDSCs, and TAMs, while suppressing CTLs. Therapeutic approaches
  targeting this pathway include porcupine inhibitors, Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor
  inhibitors, and small molecule inhibitors. Additionally, combination strategies
  with immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T/NK cell therapies offer promising avenues
  for restoring anti-tumor immunity
