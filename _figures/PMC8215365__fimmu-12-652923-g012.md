caption: Immunomodulatory effect of porcine Ligilactobacillus salivarius FFIG58 on
  porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells in response to rotavirus infection, enterotoxigenic
  Escherichia coli (ETEC) challenge and ETEC and rotavirus infection. The differential
  modulation of interferons (IFNs) and antiviral factors, inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines and negative regulators of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway
  induced by L. salivarius FFIG58 are highlighted. The heat-map analysis compares
  the immunomodulatory effects of FFIG35 and FFIG58 strains. The heat-maps were constructed
  considering the fold expression changes in RT-qPCR data, related to non-lactobacilli
  treated controls. (+) moderate up-regulation, (++) heightened up-regulation, (-)
  moderate down-regulation, (–) heightened down-regulation. The changes indicated
  by (-) and (+) were calculated by considering the percentages.
