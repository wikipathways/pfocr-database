caption: Metabolism involved in acetyl-CoA catabolism. Intermediates of Tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle measured in the plasma of hypogonadal patients. We found an overall
  decreased level of TCA-cycle metabolites. (A) Level of mevalonic acid increased
  after therapy, yet the concentration of cholesterol did not improve. (B) Acetyl-carnitine
  and fatty acid oxidation are significantly reduced after TRT. (C) Levels of energy
  metabolites production AMP and ATP. (D) Intermediates of the glutaminolysis pathway.
  This stepwise became downregulated after TRT. All data are shown as mean ± SEM of
  fold-change relative to the metabolite levels in controls. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.001.
