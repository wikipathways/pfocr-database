caption: Schematic representation of the Rim/Pal signaling pathway in fungi. This
  pathway regulates fungal adaptation to environmental pH, playing a key role in dimorphism
  and virulence. In response to alkaline pH, membrane-associated sensors (Rim21/PalH
  and Dfg16/PalI) activate a proteolytic cascade, leading to the cleavage and activation
  of the transcription factor Rim101/PacC. The active form translocates to the nucleus,
  modulating gene expression to promote filamentation in C. albicans or other adaptive
  responses in different fungi. In C. neoformans, Rim101 is also linked to the cAMP/PKA
  pathway, integrating additional environmental signals such as iron availability.
  ESCRT complexes (I–III) and endosomal components (Snf7, Vps4, Bro1) participate
  in the processing of Rim101/PacC. Created with Biorender.com
