caption: The role of RANKL/RANK signaling in the breast spans from physiologic development
  to breast cancer (BCa). RANKL expression in mammary epithelial cells is regulated
  by progesterone (Pg)-activated receptors and activates RANK in RANK-expressing luminal
  and basal cells, promoting proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival.
  Expansion of mammary stem cells is associated with carcinogenesis. In BCa cells,
  RANKL-RANK signaling pathway is associated with aggressiveness features independently
  of subtype, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, migration,
  metastases and therapy resistance.
