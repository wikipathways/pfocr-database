caption: The PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway in oocytes regulates primordial follicle activation.
  Mouse models were used to investigate the regulation of primordial follicle dormancy.
  The FOXO3 gene in primordial oocytes serves as a break to prevent the initiation
  of follicle growth. Activation of upstream RTKs by their cognate ligands (kit ligand,
  IGF-1, EGF, platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], VEGF, etc) stimulates the autophosphorylation
  of intracellular regions of these receptors. Activated receptors then stimulate
  PI3K activity, leading to increases in PIP3 levels and AKT stimulation. Activated
  AKT then migrates to the cell nucleus and suppresses FOXO3 actions to promote primordial
  follicle growth. The PTEN gene encodes an enzyme that converts PIP3 to PIP2, thus
  damping the actions of PI3K. Oocyte-specific deletion of the PTEN gene leads to
  global activation of primordial follicles () whereas treatment with PTEN inhibitors,
  bpV(hopic) [(5-hydroxy-2-pyridinecarboxylato-kN1, kO2)oxodiperoxy-vanadate (2-),
  dipotassium], promotes primordial follicle activation (). Although the exact ligand-receptor
  pairs responsible for the activation of primordial follicles during physiological
  conditions are unknown, treatment of ovaries with a cell membrane-permeable peptide
  (740Y-P, designed based on the phosphorylated intracellular region of the PDGF receptor)
  stimulates AKT signaling and promotes the activation of primordial follicles ().
