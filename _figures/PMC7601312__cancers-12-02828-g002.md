caption: T cell senescence can occur via multiple mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment.
  Tregs, through glucose metabolic competition and transfer of cAMP produced by tumors,
  can induce CD8+ T cell senescence, as can other metabolites produced by tumor cells,
  such as adenosine. Repeated antigen stimulation and external factors such as chemotherapeutic
  and radiation therapy also induce premature senescence. A key molecular pathway
  involved in CD8+ T cell senescence induction is non-canonical signaling through
  p38-MAPK.
