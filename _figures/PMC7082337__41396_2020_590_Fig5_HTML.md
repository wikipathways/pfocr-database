caption: 'Electrons from methane are generated through the “reverse methanogenesis”
  pathway and transferred into the menaquinone pool (MK/MKH2) via the Fpo and Hdr
  complexes, which oxidize F420H2 and CoM-SH + CoB-SH, respectively. Reducing equivalents
  are transferred via the menaquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductases to MHCs located
  outside the cytoplasm to reduce the Mn(IV) oxides. Abbreviations for enzymes and
  co-factors: H4MPT tetrahydromethanopterin, MFR methanofuran, Fwd formylmethanofuran
  dehydrogenase, Ftr formylmethanofuran/H4MPT formyltransferase, Mch methenyl-H4MPT
  cyclohydrolase, Mtd F420-dependent methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase, Mer F420-dependent
  methylene-H4MPT reductase, Mtr Na+-translocating methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase,
  Mcr methyl-coenzyme M reductase, Fpo F420H2 dehydrogenase, MK menaquinone, CoB-SH
  coenzyme B, CoM-SH coenzyme M, Fd ferredoxin, Hdr heterodisulfide reductase, FrhB
  F420-reducing hydrogenase subunit B, Cytb b-type cytochrome, NrfD polysulfide reductase
  subunit D, FeS ferredoxin iron–sulfur protein. The MHCs are colored blue and a number
  of hemes are indicated as red diamonds. Each potential MHC represented has a TPM
  above the median gene TPM for each species.'
