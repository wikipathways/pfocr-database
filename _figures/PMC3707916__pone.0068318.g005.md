caption: 'Host proteins that were found to be significantly differentially regulated

  results and a careful reading of published literature. The proteins that were determined
  to be differentially regulated in our study are indicated in the right portion of
  each panel, according to the different time-point comparisons. Several functions
  were altered during the course of WNV-infection in the mice brain, including: (A)
  The cytoskeleton remodeling associated with virus circulation as evidenced by the
  WNV hijacking of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (CME) and Rho GTPase
  signaling. (B) The perturbations of the protein ubiquitination pathway allowing
  viral proteins to avoid degradation and/or antigen presentation. (C) The regulation
  of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway corresponding to an evasion mechanism against
  activation of the antiviral response. (D) The kinetic modulation of the inflammatory
  response leading to brain injuries. (E) Cell death comprising neuronal necrosis
  and apoptotic phenomena. (F) The brain damage reflected by the abundance variation
  of numerous proteins involved in the deterioration of neurological functions. Known
  partners of identified differentially regulated molecules are indicated. Anti-viral
  strategies and potential biomarker candidates associated with the severity of clinical
  evolution are suggested as indicated in green and blue, respectively. A legend is
