caption: The RNF8‐ and RNF168‐dependent ubiquitin signaling pathway at DSBs is stimulated
  by CHD4‐ and p400‐mediated chromatin remodeling. ATM phosphorylates H2AX (to form
  γH2AX) in DSB‐flanking chromatin to trigger MDC1 assembly and subsequent binding
  of ubiquitin ligase RNF8. The ensuing ubiquitylation by RNF8 (here indicated as
  mono‐ubiquitylation) and the subsequent downstream events are enhanced by the chromatin
  remodeling activities of p400 and CHD4, which presumably create a more open and
  accessible chromatin state that is amendable for ubiquitylation. While p400 is recruited
  to DSBs in an MDC1‐dependent manner, the mechanistic basis of CHD4 stimulation of
  the RNF8 pathways is not clear. Upon binding, MDC1 also mediates recruitment of
  the MMSET methyltransferase, which mediates the de novo formation of di‐methylated
  H4K20 at DSBs. What follows is the association of RNF168 with RNF8‐catalyzed ubiquitin,
  poly‐ubiquitin chain conjugation (here indicated as H2A poly‐ubiquitylation) by
  RNF168, and subsequently efficient recruitment of BRCA1 through its ubiquitin‐binding
  partner RAP80. Likewise, RNF8‐ and RNF168‐mediated ubiquitylation, together with
  MMSET‐induced H4K20 methylation, synergistically promote efficient 53BP1 assembly,
  which in turn triggers the recruitment of the EXPAND1 chromatin modulator.
