caption: A proposed model describing how sulfur mediates salicylic acid and its pathway
  to regulate kiwifruit canker resistance was proposed. PR-1 and ICS1 genes are involved
  in the activation of signals on SA and then activates systemic acquired resistance
  (SAR), contributing to the resistance of kiwifruit to Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae.
