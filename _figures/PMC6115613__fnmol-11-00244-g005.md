caption: Summary of the signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion
  through p75NTR. (A) BDNF NT may act through p75NTR/TrkB/Kidins220 following ephrin
  receptor interaction and phosphorylation or through p75NTR/TrkB/Par3 following cadherin
  interactions. In some rare cases, proBDNF may also induce migration and invasion
  through sortilin/p75NTR/TrkB interactions. (B) In the presence of NGF, p75NTR/TrkB/Kidins220
  following ephrin receptor interaction and phosphorylation induce MAPK/ERK signaling
  pathway. Again, in some rare cases, proNGF may also induce migration and invasion
  through sortilin/p75NTR/TrkA interactions leading to SRC/FAK activation.
