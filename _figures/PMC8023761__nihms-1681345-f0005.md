caption: In hypertension, TLRs expressed in the cell membrane or in the endosomes
  are activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) derived from the cellular
  damage and it triggers the downstream signaling pathway through the activation of
  adaptor molecules myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing interferon-β (TRIF) to induce the activation of NF-κB,
  which will, ultimately, lead to the formation of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons.​
