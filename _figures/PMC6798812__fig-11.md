caption: Neurotrophic factor signaling pathway. NGF has a high affinity with TrkA
  and facilitates differentiation and survival of neurons. BDNF has a high affinity
  with TrkB and enhances axonal growth and survival of neurons., NT-3 has a high affinity
  with TrkC and promotes the survival of neurons. CNTF signals, via the JAK/STAT pathway,
  have been widely and successfully used to facilitate the regeneration of retinal
  ganglion cell axons in adult rats. FGF signals through the PI3K/AKT pathway and
  stimulates proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival of neurons. GDNF can send signals
  through RET-independent or RET-dependent pathways. The latter can promote neuronal
  differentiation, survival, and migration., CNTF, ciliary neurotrophic factor; FGF,
