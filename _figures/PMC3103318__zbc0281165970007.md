caption: Model pathway for genistein-induced ASAH1 transcription in MCF-7 cells. Genistein
  (GEN) activates GPR30, which signals through Gαi to activate c-Src and subsequently
  the MAPK pathway. ERK1/2 activation promotes the phosphorylation of ERα and its
  recruitment to the ASAH1 promoter. Induction of ASAH1 gene transcription leads to
  an increase in protein expression and subsequent up-regulation of enzymatic activity,
  which results in the degradation of ceramide (CER) into sphingosine (SPH) and its
  phosphorylation into S1P. S1P is exported from cells via ABC transporters ABCC1
  and ABCG2 and acts in a paracrine/autocrine matter to activate proliferative signaling
  cascades by binding to cell-surface S1P receptors (S1PR). Concomitantly, ASAH1 mediates
  cyclin B2 expression.
