caption: Tryptophan Sample Collection, Detection Methods, and Biological Functions
  Samples for tryptophan detection are typically obtained from blood specimens, cancer
  tissues, and cancer cell lines. Detection methods for tryptophan and its metabolites
  include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), liquid chromatography-tandem
  mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and immunohistochemistry. Tryptophan plays crucial
  roles in various physiological processes. In the immune system, metabolites from
  the kynurenine pathway, such as kynurenine (Kyn), modulate immune responses by regulating
  immune cell development, activation, and infiltration, thereby contributing to immune
  suppression and tumor immune evasion. Additionally, indole derivatives significantly
  also impact the immune modulation and immune homeostasis, particularly through the
  activation of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR). In the central nervous system, it
  serves as a precursor for serotonin, which influences mood, depression, and circadian
  rhythms, while its derivative, melatonin, regulates sleep-wake cycles. In the gastrointestinal
  tract, tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into indole derivatives that
  help maintain gut health and microbial balance, promoting intestinal barrier integrity
  and mucosal immunity. Moreover, the kynurenine pathway also significantly impacts
  the gastrointestinal system, particularly in maintaining immune homeostasis, regulating
  inflammation, and shaping the gut microenvironment
