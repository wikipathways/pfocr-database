caption: 'Schematic diagram of the interaction between ATP-induced cell death and
  bone Mesenchymal stem cells of the bone marrow: ATP activation of cells shows P2R,
  cell autosecretion of IL-1 and other factors, whereas ATP induction of cell death
  releases IL-18 and other factors that act on mesenchymal stem cells of the bone
  marrow. Additionally, P2R-positive cells that are stimulated by ATP also activate
  the P38 MAPK/JNK/ERK1/2/NF-kB signaling pathway, which encourages mesenchymal stem
  cells in the bone marrow to develop into OBs.'
