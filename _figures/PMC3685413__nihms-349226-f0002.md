caption: 'The nine genes with significant mutation frequencies fall into five core
  signaling pathways, in which the genes play well-established roles: DNA damage repair
  and cell-cycle control (Panel A), Notch signaling (Panel B), inflammatory pathways
  (Panel C), Wnt signaling (Panel D), and RNA splicing and processing (Panel E). Genes
  with significant mutation frequencies are shown in red, and genes with mutations
  that are in a signaling pathway related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia are shown
  in pink. A list of additional pathway-associated genes with mutations is provided
  in . Co-A denotes coenzyme A, TLR toll-like receptor, and TNFR tumor necrosis factor
  receptor.'
