caption: 'Mechanisms of sodium reabsorption in the mammalian renal tubule. A: proximal
  tubule. Many distinct Na+-coupled transport systems are present on the apical membrane
  of the proximal tubule. On the basolateral side, together with the Na+/HCO3− cotransporter,
  many facilitated transport systems (not represented) allow the exit of glucose,
  phosphate, etc. The K+ channels have not been identified with certainty, except
  for Kir6.1, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel. B: thick ascending limb. The Na+-K+-2Cl−
  cotransporter NKCC2 is the main actor of NaCl reabsorption in the apical membrane.
  KCa4.1 (also named slo2.2) is a high-conductance Na+ and Cl−-sensitive channel;
  80pS represents an unidentified channel type. C: distal convoluted tubule. The Na+
  and Cl− cotransporter NCC is present on the apical membrane. The chloride channels
  in the thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule are ClC-K1 and ClC-K2
  (ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb in humans) associated with the regulatory subunit Barttin. D:
  connecting tubule/collecting duct. Sodium enters the cell from the apical side via
  the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC. In this renal segment, part of sodium is exchanged
  for potassium, while some chloride is absorbed through the intercalated cells or
  the paracellular pathway. KCa1.1 (also named Slo1, maxi K or BK) is a high-conductance
  calcium-activated channel; 20 & 80pS represent as yet unidentified channel types.'
