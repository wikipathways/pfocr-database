caption: The effect of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis on tumor cell proliferation.
  Cancer cells have increased glucose uptake, leading to accelerated glycolysis and
  biomass accumulation. The high expression of GLUT1, HK2, PGI, PFK, Aldolase, GAPDH,
  and PKM2 significantly accelerates aerobic glycolysis. Increased lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) activity and decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) activity result in increased
  lactate export, attenuated TCA cycle and diversion of glycolysis to pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). HK2 not only directly binds to mTORC1 to activate autophagy, but
  also interacts with VDAC to protect tumor cells from apoptosis. PGI inhibits cell
  apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 and activating the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Acetylated nuclear GAPDH promotes tumorigenesis by activating
  p300 and promoting p53 expression. Aldolase promotes cell cycle progression through
  the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway, and activates AMPK to maintain tumor cell survival
  in glucose deficiency. Nuclear PKM2 performs a variety of non-metabolic functions
  to promote cell cycle progression. Low expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC),
  the key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, is essential for the proliferation of some cancer
  cells. PC is essential for the synthesis of fatty acid and glycerol in cancer cells.
  The low expression of the key enzyme PEPCK of gluconeogenesis is beneficial for
  the proliferation of cancer cells. FBPase acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibits
  the proliferation of tumor cells. G6PT promotes the invasion of glioblastoma by
  interacting with MT1-MMP. HK2, hexokinase 2; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; PGI, phosphoglucose
