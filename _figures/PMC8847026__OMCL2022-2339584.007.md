caption: 'Representation of the β-oxidation of palmitic acid in the mitochondria (according
  to Carracedo et al. [], with permission of the Nature Publishimg Group). Acyl-CoAs
  enter the fatty acid oxidation pathway in which they are dehydrogenated, hydrated,
  and decarboxylated cyclically. This results in the progressive shortening of the
  fatty acid. The produced NADH and FADH2 can be used for ATP production in the electron
  transport chain, and acetyl-CoA can enter the Krebs cycle. S-CoA: free coenzyme
  A.'
