caption: Ca2+ dynamics finely tune canonical Wnt signaling. (A) β-catenin is a negatively
  charged protein, which cannot passively overcome nuclear membranes. Ca2+ release
  from the ER contributes to the neutralization of the negatively charged residues
  of β-catenin, enabling its translocation into the nucleus. (B) Mitochondrial homeostasis
  are requirements for all the cell, including glycolytic ones. Indeed, the mitochondrial
  ATP synthesis enables Ca2+ storage in the ER. When the ion balance (e.g., [H+],
  [K+] and/or [Ca2+]) is improper, the ER-stress arise. The ER-stress cascade activates
  CHOP, which represses Wnt signaling by competing with TCF, ultimately resulting
  in negative regulation of the Wnt cascade. (C) Wnt signaling is closely interconnected
  with other pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, which plays a crucial role in
  Wnt signaling regulation by modulating GSK3β activity. In this context, Ca2+ concentration
  plays a critical role in the Wnt/AKT crosstalk. (D) Channel proteins can also contribute
  to Wnt regulation in a pore-independent manner, such as Aquaporin1 (AQP1). Recent
  evidence demonstrated that AQP1 physically interacts with GSK3β, Axin1, and LRP
  in a multi-complex platform that eventually promotes complex activity destruction.
