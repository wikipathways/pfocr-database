caption: The role of ubiquitin signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Shown
  on the left, the TME is composed of both cellular and non-cellular components, including
  tumor-infiltrating immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) and exhibits hypoxia as well. The ubiquitin signaling pathway is shown
  on the right. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates by mono-ubiquitination or
  poly-ubiquitination in the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade and removed from substrates
  by deubiquitinases (DUB). Multiple E3s and DUBs are implicated in the regulation
  of multiple TME components, as described in detail in the text.
