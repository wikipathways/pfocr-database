caption: The bacterial oxalate-degrading pathways assessed in the current study. The
  by-products of each pathway are labeled with the downstream metabolic pathways that
  they could be a substrate for (color-coded). Right—downstream metabolic pathways
  that can utilize oxalate metabolism by-products and the by-products of those pathways
