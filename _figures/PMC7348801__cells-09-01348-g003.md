caption: 'tPA-induced NF-κB activation in kidney disease. Following kidney injury,
  there is an increased level of tPA, which in turn mediates NF-κB activation in macrophages,
  leading to increased renal inflammation through three signal pathways: (A) tPA binds
  to annexin A2 and promotes aggregation of annexin A2 and CD11b leading to activation
  of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/NF-κB pathway and expression of NF-κB-dependent
  IP-10 and MIP-1 α. (B) tPA activates CD11b-dependent focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
  and the ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) pathway. This novel signal
  cascade, together with tPA-induced NF-κB signaling, results in increased macrophage
  motility and ultimately kidney inflammation. (C) tPA promotes macrophage M2 to M1
  phenotypic change through an annexin A2 and NF-κB-mediated pathway. Inducible nitric
  oxide (iNOS), TNF-α, and IL-1β are typical M1 chemokines.'
