caption: Retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway. Retinoic acid is synthesized intracellularly
  from retinol, which first is converted into retinaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol
  dehydrogenase or retinol dehydrogenase. The reversible conversion of retinal to
  retinol is mediated by the enzyme retinal reductase (DHRS3). Retinal is irreversibly
  oxidized to become retinoic acid (RA) by the enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase
  (ALDHs). Retinoic acid inside the cell binds to receptors present on the surface
  of the nucleus (RAR, ROR, and RXR) and recognizes consistent response elements (RARE,
  RORE, and RXRE) along with the DNA, which activates the expression of different
  target genes.
