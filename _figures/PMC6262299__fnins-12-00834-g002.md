caption: 'Neurotrophic factor (NTFs) signaling pathways. Brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4/5
  (NT-4/5) bind to two families of receptors. Tropomyosin kinase (Trk) receptor binds
  with high affinity to promote cell survival via phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), phosphoinositide-3
  kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (light blue arrows).
  Binding of NTFs to low affinity p75 receptor activates cell death through the JNK
  pathway (light blue and red arrows). Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) binding
  to CNTFRα receptor and two subunits – gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFRβ)
  activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
  (blue-violet arrows), MAPK and PI3K pathways (dark blue arrows). Binding of glial
  cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to the GDNFα receptor and tyrosine
  kinase RET receptor stimulates PLC-γ, MAPK and PI3K pathways (green arrows). Akt
  controls the activities of several proteins important in promoting cell survival,
  including substrates that directly regulate the caspase cascade, such as BAD. Phosphorylated
  BAD prevents its proapoptotic actions () (red arrows). The pathway illustration
  was based on Reactome (https://reactome.org/ PMID: 29145629, PMID: 29077811). Represents
  the pathways responsible for endogenous cell-rescue mechanisms in glaucoma; these
  pathways were significantly activated when IOP was elevated, but decreased to baseline
  levels when IOP was lowered (; ).'
