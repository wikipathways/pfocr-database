caption: 'A model showing the distant pathway-cross regulation (DPCR) created for
  the downregulation of the biosynthesis of tobacco alkaloids in red tobacco plants.
  Regulation pathways created in red tobacco plants are featured by red colored solid
  arrows, “X” shape, and “T” blocks. The stacked PAP1 and TT8 as well as the endogenous
  NtTTG1 encode MYB, bHLH, and WD40 proteins, respectively, which form a complex to
  regulate two biosynthetic pathways. The regulation pathway (function I) is the activation
  of biosynthesis of anthocyanin. The regulation pathway (function II) is the DPCR
  that the MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex upregulates the endogenous NtJAZs leading to the
  reduction of MYC2 and the downregulation of EAR and the nicotine biosynthesis. In
  addition, The JA-JAZ-MYC regulatory pathway is indicated with green arrows starting
  with JA (greenish arrows). The feedback regulation of NtMYC2 indicated by a brownish
  bending arrow is proposed to activate the expression of NtJAZs. SCF: Skp/Cullin/F-box
  and COI1: coronatine insensitive 1.'
