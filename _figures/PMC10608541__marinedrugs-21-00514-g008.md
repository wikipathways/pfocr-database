caption: Biosynthetic pathway of astaxanthin from β-carotene with bacterial enzymes.
  β-Carotene (β-carotenoid) 3,3′-hydroxylase and 4,4′-ketolase are shown with blue
  and orange letters, respectively. In this figure, the maximal levels of catalytic
  activities are shown concerning CrtR and CrtO. Generally, the catalytic activity
  from adonixanthin to astaxanthin is weak, even with CrtW. This pathway is based
  on bacterial enzymes. However, the functions of green algal BHY and BKT are the
  same as those of CrtZ and CrtW, respectively.
