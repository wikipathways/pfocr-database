caption: A proposed network for BMP signaling in regulating energy metabolism via
  ROS. Cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibit the glycolytic enzymes causing
  accumulation of upper glycolytic intermediates, and increase flux through the pentose
  phosphate pathway. ROS inhibit reactions in the mitochondria, including the TCA
  cycle and β-oxidation. ROS also activate autophagy. BMPs stimulate ROS production
  by inducing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase (NOX)
  family. BMPs also stimulate ROS production through cyclooxygenase (COX)-2.
