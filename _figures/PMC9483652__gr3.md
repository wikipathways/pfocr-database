caption: Consequences of ligelizumab-mediated IgE binding blockade to FcεRI and CD23
  expressing cells. Ligelizumab binds to free IgE and blocks its binding to FcεRI
  expressed on mast cells and basophils. The reduced availability of free IgE leads
  to the loss of FcεRI receptor numbers, which contributes to the effects of ligelizumab.
  The combined effects lead to a reduction in allergen-induced activation of mast
  cells and basophils, thereby reducing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators,
  with the potential to prevent food-induced allergic response and anaphylaxis. Ligelizumab
  also blocks the IgE/CD23 pathway, which may have implications for antigen presentation
  and IgE transport.,, GI, gastrointestinal tract; FA, food allergy, FcεRI, high-affinity
