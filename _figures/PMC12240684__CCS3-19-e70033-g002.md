caption: 'Mechanisms and therapeutic effects of Gln metabolism modulation in pancreatic
  cancer. The top panel illustrates the highly active Gln metabolism in tumor cells
  and the corresponding effects of inhibiting this metabolic pathway. Tumor cells
  depend on Gln for biosynthesis, energy production, and maintaining redox balance,
  which supports tumor growth and survival. Gln metabolism inhibition disrupts these
  processes, reducing tumor cell viability. The lower panel highlights therapeutic
  outcomes: (1) enhancing drug penetration by targeting the extracellular matrix (ECM)
  and overcoming hypoxia; (2) promoting immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment
  (TME); (3) reactivating T cells through Gln inhibition, which restores antitumor
  immune responses; and (4) inducing tumor cell apoptosis. These strategies collectively
  demonstrate the potential of targeting Gln metabolism to improve PC therapies'
