caption: Carbonyl stress in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) promotion induced
  by diabetes, and mechanism of protection by reactive carbonyl species (RCS) trapping
  agents. Diabetes markedly accelerates tumor progression through hyperglycemia-derived
  carbonyl stress. The increased availability of glucose feeds the glycolytic flux
  of tumor cells favoring local formation of RCS such as methylglyoxal, which represent
  an inevitable side-product of glycolysis. In addition, circulating RCS and advanced
  glycation end-products (AGEs) derived from non-enzymatic glycoxidation (and lipoxidation)
  reactions occurring at the systemic level may also contribute to the overall burden
  of carbonyl stress in neoplastic lesions. Increased RCS and AGE levels in PDAC cells
  has been associated with increased nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein
  (YAP), a key effector of Hippo pathway and regulator of tumor growth and invasion.
  Dyslipidemia, associated or not with hyperglycemia, may represent an additional
  source of RCS and AGEs. Sequestering of RCS and consequent inhibition of AGE formation
  efficiently prevented hyperglycemia-induced YAP activation and acceleration of pancreatic
  intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression to invasive cancer in a mouse model
  of Kras-driven PDAC, through inhibition of large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1)
  and phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), respectively.
