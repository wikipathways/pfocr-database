caption: Gene expression differences in the bacterial l-histidine biosynthetic pathway.
  Pathview plots show differences in the average expression counts of functional enzymes
  in the l-histidine metabolism pathway between E. coli grown on NGM or NGM + FudR
  plates. The color in the rectangles indicates the average CPM expression of E. coli
  on NGM only (left) compared to E. coli exposed to FudR (right). We observed that
  several enzymes in the l-histidine biosynthesis pathway are upregulated in OP50
  E. coli when exposed FudR
