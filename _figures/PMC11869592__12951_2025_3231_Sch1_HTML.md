caption: Schematic diagram of the synthesis of Micro DEA2k and its adsorption of cfDNA
  to alleviate intestinal I/R injury. After intraperitoneal injection of pH-responsive
  Micro DEA2k, it adsorbs cfDNA and inhibits M1 polarization of macrophages through
  the TLR9-NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in reduced release of inflammatory cytokines
  and thereby alleviating intestinal injury and systemic inflammatory responses

  scavenge cell-free-DNA to alleviate intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting
  M1 macrophage polarization
