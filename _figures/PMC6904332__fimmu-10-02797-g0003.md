caption: Upregulation of SESN2 under ERS and its protective effect on ERS-associated
  cell death. Under conditions of stress, ERS is activated due to accumulation of
  unfolded or misfolded proteins within ER lumen, and then the three branches of the
  ERS pathway involving PERK (via eIF2α and ATF4), IRE1 (through XBP1, TRAF2, and
  JNK), and ATF6 upregulate SESN2 expression. SESN2 exerts homeostatic feedback to
  attenuate the ERS response or ERS-induced cell death. Overexpression of SESN2 reduces
  ERS-related cell death, while knockout of SESN2 exacerbates the extent of ERS, which
  results in enhanced ERS-mediated cell apoptosis. Tm, tunicamycin; Tg, thapsigargin;
  PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular
  patterns; PERK, PER-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; IRE1, inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; TRAF2, TNF-α receptor-associated factor
  2; ASK-1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ATF6,
  activating transcription factor 6; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein.
