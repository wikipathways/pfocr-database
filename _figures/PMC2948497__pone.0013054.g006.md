caption: 'From cDNA microarray, heat map, and qRT-PCR analyses, genes involved at
  different phases of the cell cycle including the G1/S transition, and progression
  through S- G2- and M- phases, are shown. The genes identified include CDK inhibitors,
  members of the CDK and CDC families, cyclins, genes involved in DNA replication
  and repair, and genes that regulate the mitotic spindle, and involve 5 of the 12
  common signaling pathways determined by IPA analysis. Red: Up-regulated genes. Green:
  Down-regulated genes. Light shade→dark shade, increasing differential expression.'
