caption: mTORC1 controls cell growth and is regulated by the lncRNA-encoded polypeptide
  SPAR. mTORC1 signaling induces protein translation through S6K1/S6 and 4E-BP1/eIF4E.
  The negative feedback from S6K1 to IRS1 reduces PI3K/Akt signaling, thereby promoting
  proteasomal degradation. mTORC1 is stimulated by growth factors that induce the
  PI3K/Akt pathway and thereby inhibit the TSC1/TSC2 complex which functions as a
  GTPase-activating protein for Rheb. GTP-bound Rheb recruits mTORC1 from the cytoplasm
  to the lysosome. Activation of mTORC1 is also achieved by free amino acids that
  weaken the interaction between the v-ATPase and Ragulator, consequently transforming
  the Rag proteins into their active form. SPAR, a polypeptide encoded by lncRNA LINC00961,
  directly binds to v-ATPase and blunts mTORC1 activation by amino acids. Other regulators
  of mTORC1 include AMPK that is activated upon low cellular energy levels (reduced
  ATP/AMP ratio) and stabilizes the TSC1/TSC2 complex, thereby increasing mTORC1 inhibition.
