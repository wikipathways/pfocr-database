caption: Proposed mechanism by which miR-125b regulates ALS microglia phenotype and
  toxicity. In microglia, classical NF-κB/P65 pathway is activated by inflammatory
  stimuli such as ATP acting on P2X7r or LPS acting on Toll-like receptor (TLR). Once
  activated, P65 allows transcription of several inflammatory genes (TNFα, Ncf2, NOX2)
  together with NF-κB negative regulators, among which A20 is necessary to correctly
  stop the inflammatory response. In ALS microglia, miR-125b is upregulated in response
  to inflammatory stimuli and negatively regulates A20 protein production, resulting
  in persistent NF-κB activation and release of toxic factors affecting MN survival
