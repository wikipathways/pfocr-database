caption: Estrogen neuroprotection may involve two complementary pathways. Under basal
  conditions (solid lines), E2 increases expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-w and decreases
  expression of proapoptotic Bim, events that counteract the mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis. This may represent an estrogen maintenance pathway of neuron survival.
  Under toxic challenges such as Aβ exposure (dashed lines), E2 can inhibit activation
  of JNK, functionally mimicking the pharmacological JNK inhibitor SP600125. JNK activation
  induces the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis involving decreased expression of
  Bcl-w and increased expression of Bim, followed by mitochondrial release of cytochrome
  c and Smac, and eventually neuron death. Because E2 does not alter basal JNK activity,
  such a protective mechanism may represent an estrogen response pathway that is activated
  after injury.
