caption: Oncosuppressive mechanisms mediated by melatonin. Melatonin (MLT) signaling
  has been shown to reduce the abundance and transcriptional activity of the NF-κB
  (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) transcription factor
  as well as to activate phosphorylation cascades mediated by mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) such as MEK1/2, ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Both NF-κB inhibition and
  MAPKs activation in turn inhibit cell growth and motility, and promote apoptosis
  and DNA damage repair through mechanisms involving the accumulation of oncosuppressors
  such as p53, p27kip1, and p21, activation of DNA repair complexes such as P53/PML/H2AX
  on DNA damage sites, and transcriptional control of genes involved in the cell cycle,
  apoptosis, and invasiveness. Even though it is still a matter of debate, there is
  the possibility that melatonin can also bind to nuclear receptors RZR/ROR, controlling
  the transcription of RORE (ROR response Elements) on genes of the retinoic acid
  response, among which are several genes controlling cell cycle progression and cell
  growth (p21, 5-lipoxygenase, and others). Finally, melatonin can bind to the intracellular
  protein calmodulin (CaM) and reduce the Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) response in ER
  positive cells by impairing the formation of a proper E2–ERα–CaM complex on Estrogen
  Receptor Elements (EREs) on target genes. Arrows indicate activation, while dashed
  and blunt lines indicate inhibition. Activation indicates an increase in protein
  or activity levels, while inhibition indicates a decrease in protein or activity
  levels.
