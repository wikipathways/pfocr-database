caption: Schematic representation of mTORC2 signaling pathway. Cellular functions
  of mTORC2 are described less well than those of mTORC1. Protor, Rictor, and mSin1
  (orange) are specific components of mTORC2. mTORC2 stimulates the activity of AGC
  kinase family members (blue) by phosphorylating residues localized in their hydrophobic
  motifs. Phosphorylation of PKC, AKT, and SGK1 by mTORC2 is thought to influence
  cytoskeletal organization and cell survival, respectively. In addition, it was recently
  reported that mTORC2 associates with the ribosome. It appears that ribosome-localized
  mTORC2 cotranslationally phosphorylates nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge
  from the ribosome thus facilitating their optimal folding. Upstream regulators of
  mTORC2 are still largely elusive. T bars represent inhibitory signals, whereas arrows
  indicate stimulatory signals. Abbreviations and detailed explanations are provided
  in the text.
