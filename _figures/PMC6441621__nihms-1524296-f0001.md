caption: miR-223 regulates the canonical NF-κB pathway and other pathways related
  to cancer. miR-223 is released from neutrophils and macrophages as a cargo of macrovesicles,
  exosomes, and possibly high-density lipoproteins (HDL), that can be delivered to
  phagocytes or nonphagocytic cells. Macrophages, in addition, deliver miR-223 into
  recipient cells through gap junctions. miR-223 is transcribed under the control
  of PU.1 and C/EBP family transcriptional factors and others, which also contributes
  to the cytosolic pool of miR-223. miR-223 suppresses the canonical NF-κB pathway
  by downregulating the expression of components in the signaling transduction pathway.
  In addition, miR-223 directly targets STAT1 and STAT3 and NLRP3 to suppress the
  inflammasome activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. In various cancer
  cells, miR-223 regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation,
  immune evasion, cell adhesion and migration. Note, only selected direct miR-223
  targets are included, and the target genes are different depending on the cell type
  investigated.
