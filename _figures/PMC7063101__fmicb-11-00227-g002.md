caption: A simplified representation of the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway and the
  defense response mechanism in groundnut or maize. (A) Aflatoxin biosynthesis in
  A. flavus; (B) the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway involve multiple genes which co-express
  together for the formation of toxin secondary metabolites. In the susceptible genotype
  infection leads to the A. flavus seed colonization and production of aflatoxin which
  causes suppression of host defense mechanism results in ROS generation and DNA damage
  causing cell death (apoptosis). In contrast, in resistant genotypes infection causes
  induction of host defense mechanism that include MAPK pathway which induces WRKY
  TF expression which is a key regulator of pathogenesis and antioxidant related genes
  involved in the suppression of aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway or detoxification
  of toxin.
