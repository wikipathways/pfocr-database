caption: Schematic representation of FGFR2 signaling through the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway.
  FGFR2 and B-Raf were found 2 associated with 15 of 16 phenotypes over-represented
  in the Transamidase+Remodeling Group and are in signaling cascades associated with
  lipid rafts which contain GPI-anchored proteins. *Numerous FGFs activate the FGFR2.
  Only FGF2 is known to be associated with lipid rafts (purple) [–]
papertitle: Significantly different clinical phenotypes associated with mutations
  in synthesis and transamidase+remodeling glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor
  biosynthesis genes.
