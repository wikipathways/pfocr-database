caption: Relationship between nitrosamine/DMF degradation and arginine metabolism
  as observed in our experiments. Genes labelled in black correspond to deletion strains
  that displayed growth defects in our experiments, while those in blue did not show
  fitness defects. The dashed arrow with question marks (in yellow) means the reaction
  is hypothetical, i.e. depicting NH4 from nitrosamine degradation entering the arginine
  biosynthetic pathway. In the diagram, only metabolic intermediates of nitrosamine/DMF
  that we screened are shown.
