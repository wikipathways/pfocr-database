caption: Possible mechanisms of ethylene-GA crosstalk revealed by the analysis of
  the gai eto2-1 double mutant. Arrows represent the influences of ethylene on the
  GA-biosynthesis and signaling and the effect of GA on its own signaling and on the
  ethylene-biosynthesis (by influencing ACS stability). Dotted lines represent hypothetic
  modes of regulation, yet to be proven. Ub indicates addition of ubiquitin units
  to label ACS5 for degradation. Degradation of ACS5 can either be regulated through
  the ETO1-CUL3 complex; or by yet unknown pathways (indicated by ?), which might
  be affected by CK and/or GA. Besides the suggested GA-specific pathway, GA may also
  influence the ETO1/CUL3 pathway in a CK-independent way or counteract the inhibitory
  action of CK on the ETO1/CUL3 dependent and independent pathways. Ethylene itself
  might be involved in the degradation/stabilization of the DELLA-proteins, either
  through a direct effect on the DELLA-proteins or through an effect on the SCFSLY1/2
  F-box proteins.
