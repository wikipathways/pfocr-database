caption: Model of molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of placental cell proliferation
  by eutherian NRK and its molecular evolution to acquire this function. NRK is highly
  expressed in the placenta and underwent rapid molecular evolution during early mammalian
  evolution. The changes in amino acid sequences in the CNH domain and the middle
  region conferred plasma membrane localization and CK2 inhibition activities, respectively.
  Eutherian NRK is localized at the plasma membrane and inhibited CK2, thereby mitigating
  CK2-dependent inhibition of PTEN, leading to the suppression of AKT signaling and
  cell proliferation. Through these mechanisms, eutherian NRK played an essential
  role in normal placental development by preventing hyperplasia of the placenta.
