caption: 'Transcriptomic alteration-based identification of potential diseases and
  functions modulated upon leptin upregulation. A total of 20,530 gene expression
  data from each ccRCC patient were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA. The
  differential gene signatures were obtained after comparing each gene in the high
  leptin group to each gene in the low leptin group. Gene targets were further filtered
  by the log2-transformed 1.5-fold change and p value (<0.05) for ingenuity pathway
  analysis (IPA) (938 gene targets). The putative regulatory network of the top diseases
  and functions is presented. E: e notation indicated “× 10n” of a value m × 10n.'
