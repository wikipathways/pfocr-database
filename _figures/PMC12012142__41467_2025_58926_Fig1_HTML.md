caption: A Schematic of the yeast mevalonate (MVA) pathway for cholesterol (Cho) biosynthesis.
  Endogenous synthesis of 2,3-epoxysqualene proceeds via the MVA pathway, followed
  by cyclization through ERG7 to form lanosterol. In the endoplasmic reticulum, lanosterol
  is sequentially converted by ERG2/3/7/11/24/25/26/27 into cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3β-ol
  and ergosterol. Exogenous 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase (DHCR7) then convert cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3β-ol toward Cho. ERG5 and
  ERG6 are knocked out to block flux toward ergosterol. B Cho titers (pink bars) and
  optical density at 600 nm (OD600) (gray bars) in strain D7-1 expressing Bos taurus
  (BtDHCR7), Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (PhDHCR7), Sus scrofa (SsDHCR7), or Danio
  rerio (DrDHCR7) DHCR7. C 7-dehydrocholesterol (Dhc) titers (pink bars) and OD600
  (gray bars) in D7-1 expressing BtDHCR7, PhDHCR7, SsDHCR7, or DrDHCR7. Data are presented
  as mean ± s.d. from three biologically independent replicates. Source data are provided
