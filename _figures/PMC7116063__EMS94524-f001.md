caption: In the absence of the appropriate signals, mTORC1 is not localized to the
  lysosome by RagA/B-RagC/D and therefore not allosterically activated by Rheb. Inhibitory
  GAPs for the RagA/B and Rheb GTPases – GATOR1 and TSCC, respectively – act on their
  targets, while FLCN-FNIP activates RagC/D. In the presence of amino acids and key
  metabolites, SESN2 and CASTOR1 dissociate from GATOR2, enabling it to inhibit GATOR1
  through an as-yet incompletely described mechanism, while SAMTOR dissociates from
  GATOR1-KICSTOR and may enable recognition of GATOR1 by GATOR2. In the absence of
  external stresses, such as DNA damage, low cellular energy status and reactive oxygen
  species production, as well as positive growth factor signaling, TSCC-mediated Rheb
  inhibition is relieved by posttranslational modifications of the integrator complex,
  which likely lead to dispersion of TSCC from the lysosome surface. Both the Rag
  heterodimer and Rheb GTPases can now cooperatively activate mTORC1 to stimulate
  biogenesis.
