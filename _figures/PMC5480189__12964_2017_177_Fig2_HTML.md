caption: a The Janus kinase (JAK)- signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) pathway. JAKs are activated upon cytokine stimulation and phosphorylate STATs
  which results in dimerization and translocation of STATs to the nucleus in order
  to activate or suppress the transcription of genes. b Regulation of the JAK–STAT
  pathway. A schematic of negative regulators that modulate the JAK-STAT pathway.
  Negative regulators consist of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins,
  Protein Inhibitors of Activated STATs (PIAS), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs),
  such as SRC homology 2 (SH2)-domain-containing PTP1 (SHP1), SHP2, CD45, LNK, T-cell
  PTP (TCPTP) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)
