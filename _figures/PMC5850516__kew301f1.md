caption: 'IL-1β, TNF-α and TLR signalling pathways all converge at TAK1TAK1 is a central
  signalling molecule. IL-1β, TNF-α and TLR signalling pathways all result in TAK1
  activation and transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators. A brief summary of each
  pathway is illustrated above. Both IL-1 and TLR signalling use MyD88 in order to
  activate TRAF6, which undergoes K63 polyubiquitination. In TNF-α signalling, TRAF2
  or TRAF5 is K63 polyubiquitinated. Despite different TRAFs being activated, they
  all result in TAB1/2 activation, which recruits TAK1. Upon ubiquitination, TAK1
  phosphorylates its downstream targets, the MKKs and IKKs, resulting in IL-6, IL-8
  and TNFα production. TAK1’s central role in these three pathways makes it a prime
  candidate as a druggable target to reduce the overall inflammatory response in order
  to treat diseases characterized by chronic inflammation. AP-1: activator protein
