caption: Regulatory functions of TCL1 in the metabolic transition pluripotent embryonic
  stem cells undergo to generate differentiated somatic cells. KLF4/OCT4 mediated-upregulation
  of TCL1 increases glycolysis in ESC-like pluripotent stem cells by activating the
  AKT/mTOR pathway. At the same time, TCL1 also suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis
  and oxygen consumption via PnPase. The gradual loss of pluripotency potential of
  ESCs during early embryo development is associated with the down-regulation of TCL1
  expression, which promotes the metabolic shift toward the oxidative phosphorylation
  metabolism typical of differentiating cells.
