caption: Synthesis pathway of the active hormonal form 1,25(OH)2D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol.
  Breakage of the 9,10-bond within the B-ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol (a) by ultraviolet
  radiation forms previtamin D3 (b). The ring opening is followed by a rapid, thermally
  induced isomerisation by a [,]-hydrogen atom shift (c), followed by a spontaneous
  shift from the 6-cis-conformer to the 6-trans-conformer, resulting in vitamin D3
  (d). These three reaction steps occur spontaneously without any enzyme catalysis,
  but at a low efficacy in the body. Hydroxylation at position C25 by 25-hydroxylase
  in the liver to 25(OH)D3 (e), and a second hydroxylation by 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase
  in the kidney results in the active hormonal form, 1,25(OH)2D3 (f).
