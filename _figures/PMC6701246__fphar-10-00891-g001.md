caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms promoting macrophage phagocytosis
  of AC by lipid mediators. In addition to a role in recognition of N-formylated peptides
  that are generated during bacterial and mitochondrial protein synthesis, the formyl
  peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2) also binds to Lipoxin A4, Annexin A1, and Ac2-26 (N-terminal
  part of Annexin A1) to increase macrophage phagocytosis of AC (; ; ; ). Signaling
  following ALX/FPR2 binding by these ligands was shown to induce rearrangements in
  the actin cytoskeleton in a Rho, Rac, and cdc42-dependent manner. GPR32 is thought
  to be the main receptor for the resolvin D family members 1, 3, and 5 (RvD1,3,5)
  that acts to promote phagocytosis of AC and reduce NF-κB activity. RvD1 and RvD3
  were also found to bind ALX/FPR2 with high affinity and induce macrophage phagocytosis
  (; , ; ). The resolving E family member 1 (RvE1) increased macrophage phagocytosis
  of AC via binding to ERV-1/ChemR23. Phosphorylation of Akt and S6 proteins induced
  cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as promotion of transcription of the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-10 (). RvE1 can also competitively bind to the leukotriene B4 receptor
  BLT4, acting to reduce pro-inflammatory signaling (; ; ). Resolvin D2 (RvD2) mediated
  activation of GPR18 induced an M2-like macrophage phenotype exhibiting increased
  phagocytosis via a mechanism involving phosphorylation of the ERK, PKA, and STAT3
  (; ). Although resolving E2 (RvE2) was also reported to induce macrophage phagocytosis,
  the pathway that controls this effect has not been clearly identified ().
