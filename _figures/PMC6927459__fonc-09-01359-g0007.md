caption: EpCAM, claudin7 and their cooperation in PaCa. (A) In tight junctions, cldn7
  is associated with additional cldns, occludin, JAM, and ZO1, 2, and 3, the latter
  being associated with pMIC2 and the cytoskeleton. Upon stimulation by several cytokine
  receptors, PI3K, ERK, RhoA/Rock, and MLCK promote MLC2 dephosphorylation, which
  promotes reorganization of the cytoskeleton with consequences on the cldn associated
  transporter activity. A stress response provokes internalization of the TJ complex.
  It is suggested that the internalized complex may be partly digested, recycle and
  become integrated into Exo. (B) EpCAM form tetramers, which with low affinity bind
  to EpCAM tetramers on neighboring cells and concomitantly prevent PRKD1 activation
  that leads to ERK1/2 and myosin activation, which inhibits Ca++-dependent Cadherin
  adhesion. Alternatively, EpCAM becomes cleaved by TACE and subsequently by PSN2.
  The cotranscription factor EpICD becomes supported by LEF and ß-catenin that might
  derive from Kremen1-DKK2-LRP6 promoted Wnt-Frizzled activation. This transcription
  factor complex mostly supports EpCAM and Wnt target gene expression. (C) Palmitoylated
  cld7 associates with monomeric EpCAM. As cldn7 is associated with PSN2, EpICD generation
  is augmented. Palmitoylated cldn7 may also contribute to NICD generation that acts
  as cotranscription factor. In association with CD44v6 and Tspan8, cldn7palm associates
  with ERM and contributes to ERM activation and actin binding. In association with
  uPAR and integrins it promotes both uPAR and integrin activation. Finally, a cldn7Palm-integrin-HSP
  complex assists talin-FAK-src-RhoA activation and by activation of the Grb2-SOS-RAS
  pathway ILK and the MAPK-JNK pathway. EpICD, NICD, and ILK contribute to c-myc,
  cyclinD1 and EMT gene transcription; NICD via HES and c-jun interfere with Pten
  transcription. Full name of proteins are listed in . Thus, TJ cldn7 is important
  particularly in lipid transport and cytoskeleton organization, EpCAM by promoting
  oncogenes and EMT genes, which also accounts for cldn7Palm-associated EpCAM. Cldn7Palm
  additionally contributes to Pten silencing.
