caption: Schematic representation of the NOD2 signaling pathway. Upon binding of its
  natural ligand (MDP), the NOD2 protein unfolds and oligomerizes through the NACT
  domain. This is followed by recruitment of RIP2 kinase protein through CARD-CARD
  interactions and activation of downstream transcriptional factors (NF-κB and MAP
  kinase) and secretion of inflammatory cytokines.
