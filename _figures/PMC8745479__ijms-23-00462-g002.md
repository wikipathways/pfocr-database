caption: 'Molecular, cellular, and network mechanisms of encoding new associations.
  The entities to be linked together in an episodic memory trace have previously encoded
  representations in the central nervous system that are relayed to the hippocampus
  by the ring attractors located in the EPISODE modules of the entorhinal cortex.
  Namely, entities A, B, C, and D are respectively represented by their own A, B,
  C, and D ring attractors which are activated by relevant sensory input, integrated
  input derived from multimodal external information, or internally generated input
  arriving actually to the entorhinal cortex. Axons from neurons (depicted in green,
  labeled as “FAN” cells) constituting the ring attractors reach the hippocampus via
  the perforant pathway. When encoding new episodic memories, new associations require
  newborn dentate granule cells (depicted as “GC”) that are of the right receptive
  age to form new synapses (indicated as red dots) with such axons. Reelin (see )
  is indispensable for the newborn cells to become postsynaptic cells in this circuit
  and is provided by the output cells (fan cells or stellate cells) of the EPISODE
  module. New associations are stored at the level of the granule cells since these
  neurons establish contacts with a unique set (in the depicted example: A, B, C,
  and D) of EPISODE modules. For details, the reader is referred to Reference [].'
