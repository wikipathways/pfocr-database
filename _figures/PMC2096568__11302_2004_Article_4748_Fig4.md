caption: 'Schematic representation of the P2Y1- or P2Y12-activated G protein cycle.
  Agonist activation of either the P2Y1 or the P2Y12 receptor causes an increase in
  the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαq or Gαi, respectively, whereby GTP
  replaces GDP, creating the active species Gα-GTP. The signaling pathway is turned
  off by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by the G protein. GAPs, such as RGS proteins,
  or PLC-β in the case of Gαq, augment the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Hence, two important
  rate limiting steps exist in the signaling pathway: (1) the rate of guanine nucleotide
  exchange (regulated by the agonist-activated receptor acting as a GEF) and (2) the
  rate of GTP hydrolysis (regulated by GAPs).'
