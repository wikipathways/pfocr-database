caption: mtDNA-triggered cGAS-YAP pathway. mtDNA was released from the damaged mitochondria
  and then activated the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which inhibited the nuclear
  translocation of YAP1 and inhibited cyclin D mediated endothelial proliferation.
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; LATS1/2, large
  tumor suppressor kinase 1/2; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif.4.3.2.
  Adenosine triphosphate.
