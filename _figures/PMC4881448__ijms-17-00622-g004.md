caption: The addition of Tyr and AdoMet to hepatocellular carcinoma cells after acute
  ethanol treatment increases pERK expression that, in turn, determines increased
  cell proliferation. The treatment also induces an increase of nuclear Sirt1 expression
  that both promotes cell proliferation itself and blocks the p53/p21 pathway with
  consequent apoptosis inhibition.
