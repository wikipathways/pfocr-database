caption: 'P. gingivalis and its presumed contribution to periodontitis via adaptive
  immune suppression. Following P. gingivalis infection, the outer membrane vesicles
  (OMVs) from P. gingivalis transfer LPS and gingipains to a lipid-binding site on
  an antigen presenting cell (AP cell). Gingipains erode cells cleaving CD14 and the
  immune cell receptor (RANKL [receptor activator of NF-κB ligand]) a TNF-related
  cytokine which binds to RANK, a protein expressed on the osteoclast progenitor cell
  activating an intracellular signaling cascade via NF-κB resulting in suppression
  of IL-2 secretion. Intact CD14 on membrane and soluble TLR4-MD2 (myeloid MD2= differentiation
  protein 2) can still function to promote the binding of LPS to the TLR4-MD2 complex
  and enlist intracellular cell signaling via NF-κB. The appropriate cytokine release
  or its suppression has implications on cellular/adaptive immune responses which
  involve host defective IgG. Adaptive immune responses through activated CD14 T cells
  and secretion of immunoglobulins (Ig) by B cells constrain the subgingival biofilm
  or may give rise to disease progression. T cells can have both protective and destructive
  roles. Inhibition of IL-2: P. gingivalis can modify adaptive immune response through
  interaction with dendritic cells inducing a cytokine pattern favoring T-helper 17
  (Th17) lineage and inhibiting the expression and accumulation of IL-2 which attenuates
  T cell proliferation and communication. Arg-gingipain (Agp) protease is involved
  in suppression of IL-2 which contributes to self-propagation of P. gingivalis in
  vivo. Th17/Treg imbalance: P. gingivalis can modify adaptive immune response by
  interaction with dendritic or antigen presenting cells (APC cells) which induce
  a cytokine pattern favoring the Th17 cell population. The imbalance is also promoted
  by P. gingivalis proteases because IL-1β is the most Th17 supporting cytokine and
  is the cytokine most resistant to P. gingivalis protease cleavage modification of
  Th17/Treg balance which occurs by Th17 cell response inhibition and increasing Treg-cell
  activation. IFN-γ suppresses upregulation of programmed cell death: Secretion of
  IFN-γ upregulation of programmed cell death – 1 (PD-1) – receptor on CD+ cells and
  its ligand PD-L1 on CD11b+-T cells. Since the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway inhibits
  the T-cell response, the changes induced by P. gingivalis on the expression of these
  molecules could be a mechanism by which P. gingivalis suppresses T-cell immunity.
  RANK-RANKL, OPG: Activated lymphocytes expressing surface receptor activator of
  NF-κB ligand (RANKL) can bind to surface RANK expressed on hematopoietic progenitors
  of osteoclasts (osteoclast progenitors) activating a signal transduction cascade
  leading to osteoclastogenesis (in the presence of macrophage colony–stimulating
  factor, MCSF). This gives rise to activation and differentiation of functional osteoclasts
  and periodontal bone resorption. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of RANKL–RANK
  interaction, produced by gingival fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and periodontal ligament
  fibroblasts, abrogates immune cell RANKL-dependent and destructive osteoclastic
  periodontal bone resorption. OPG can enhance bone formation.Symbols:  =suppression,
