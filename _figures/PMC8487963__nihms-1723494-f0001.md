caption: A) Schematic diagram depicting the peripheral blood of normal individuals
  and MDS patients. Peripheral blood of normal individuals shows balanced hematopoietic
  output, whereas peripheral blood of MDS patients exhibits reduced blood cell production.
  B) Several treatments are available for low-risk MDS patients. Erythropoietin (EPO)
  works through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription
  (JAK-STAT) pathway to induce hematopoietic gene transcription. The Del (5q) specific
  drug lenalidomide acts by ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated degradation of specific substrates
  thereby inducing apoptosis, and also by inhibiting the cell cycle specific gene,
  cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C), to arrest Del (5q) MDS cells in G2/M phase. Luspatercept
  contains a modified version of the extracellular domain of the activin receptor
  IIB (ActRIIB), which inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF-β) signaling and blocks
  abnormally elevated SMAD signaling, to promote erythroid cell maturation. Hypomethylating
  agents (HMAs) are agents of choice for high-risk patients. HMAs inhibit DNA methyltransferase
  (DNMT) to ameliorate increased CpG island methylation, that is characteristic of
  abnormal hematopoietic cells in MDS, and exert cytotoxic effects.
