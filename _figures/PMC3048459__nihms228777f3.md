caption: 'TGFβ Smad-dependent signaling pathway: TGFβ exerts its effect by binding
  and activating type II receptor (TGFβR2) and then type I receptor (TGFβR1). After
  phosphorylation, TGFβR2 phosphorylates TGFβR1, which subsequently phosphorylates
  and activates R-Smads (Smad2/3). Activated R-Smads are released from receptors then
  form a heterotrimeric complex with co-Smad (Smad4), which is translocated into the
  nucleus to regulate transcription of the target gene. I-Smads (Smad6 and Smad7)
  shows inhibitory Smad interaction and interfere with the activation of R-Smads while
  Smurf1/2 targets TGFβR-1 and TGFβR-2 along with various Smad family proteins for
  proteasome-mediated degradation.'
