caption: Diagram summarizing the reviewed mechanisms by which CCR9 induces different
  aspects of tumor metastasis. a The interaction of CCL25 and CCR9 can induce tumor
  metastasis via the RAS-MAPK-MMP pathway, the RhoA-Rock-MLC pathway, and ezrin signaling.
  b CCR9-high-expressing tumor cells are targeted to the small intestine and gastrointestinal
  tract by CCL25/CCR9 signaling. The solid arrows indicate that these signaling pathways
  have confirmed; the dashed arrows show that these signaling pathways need to be
  further validation
