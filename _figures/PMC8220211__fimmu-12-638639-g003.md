caption: SCFV/IL-12Rβ2 receptor induces CAR genes expression. The hypothetically designed
  cells express ScFv/IL-12Rβ2 receptor constitutively before injection. The ScFv/IL-12Rβ2
  receptor consists of an extracellular domain against tumor-associated antigen 1
  and the intracellular domain of β2 subunit of the human IL-12 receptor. After injection
  and TAA1 recognition by ScFv/IL-12Rβ2 receptor, JAK2 activates and creates a docking
  site for STAT4 attachment to ScFv/IL-12Rβ2 receptor endodomain. This attachment
  will activate the JAK2/STAT4 signaling pathway and STAT4 mediated gene expression
  after TAA1 recognition (, ). Based on our design, two different CAR receptors and
  anti-FAP BiTE genes are downstream of STAT4 responsive promoter; therefore, these
  genes will be expressed in consequence of TAA1 presence. Since a 2A ribosomal skip
  sequence separates these genes, they will be expressed simultaneously after STAT4
  binding to the promoter. After CAR 1 and CAR 2 expression, they could recognize
  TAA2 and TAA3, respectively, and subsequently activate the CAR T cell.
