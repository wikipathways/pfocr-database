caption: a,b. Vitagenes and the pathway of cellular stress response. Cumulating misfolded
  proteins in response to proteotoxic environmental stress conditions triggers the
  cellular stress response (Figure a). HSPs that are normally bound to HSF1, maintaining
  it in a repressed state before stress, are titrate away by damaged or misfolded
  proteins with resulting HSF-1 activation. Multi-step activation of HSF1 involves
  post-translational modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation and deacetylation,
  which allow HSF1 to trimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to heat-shock
  elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of its target hsp genes. Nutritional antioxidants,
  including carnosic acid, resveratrol, sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate, acetyl-L-carnitine
  or carnosine are able to activate vitagenes, such as heme oxygenase, Hsp70, thioredoxin
  reductase and sirtuins which represent an integrated system for cellular stress
  tolerance. Phytochemicals and Acetyl-L-carnitine act through the activation of the
  vitagene system, with up-regulation of HO-1, Thioredoxin, the GSH and Sirtuin system,
  results in counteraction of pro-oxidant conditions (Figure b). During aging, a gradual
  decline in potency of the heat shock response occur and this may prevent repair
  of protein damage, leading to degeneration and cell death.
