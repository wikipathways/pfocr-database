caption: The molecular signaling pathway of PA28γ in cancer. After being modified,
  such as by acetylation or phosphorylation, PA28γ can interact with various molecules.
  (A) PA28γ regulates cell cycle and the apoptosis. PA28γ has been identified as substrate
  of caspase 3 and caspase 7, and it can degrade the apoptosis-related proteins FLASH,
  p16, p19, and p21. PA28γ is also involved in the MDM2-p53 interaction. (B) PA28γ
  can degrade tumor-related proteins such as Smurf1, SRC-3, PTTG1 and the HCV core
  protein, acting as a tumor suppressor. (C) PA28γ can promote the angiogenesis of
  tumors by activating NF-κB to promote the expression of IL-6 and CCL2 in oral squamous
  cell carcinoma (OSCC). (D) After ATM-mediated phosphorylation, PA28γ accumulates
  at DNA damage sites to promote DNA repair.
