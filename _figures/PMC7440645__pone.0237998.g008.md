caption: Arabidopsis response to Fe shortage is essentially controlled at the transcriptional
  level and involves a complex regulatory network among which bHLH transcription factor
  (TF), from different clades [] play a key role. The uppermost bHLH TF in this pathway
  belong to the clade IVc. The expression of these TF is induced in response to Fe
  deficiency. The stability of clade IVc encoded proteins is regulated by a Fe-binding
  E3 ligase, BTS (BRUTUS), whose expression is induced by clade IVc in response to
  Fe shortage. The expression of PYE (POPEYE, bHLH47), a transcriptional repressor,
  is also induced by clade IVc bHLH. PYE represses its target genes by interacting
  with bHLH105/ILR3 (IAA-LEUCINE RESISTANT3) [, , ]. In addition, clade IVc bHLH act
  as positive regulators [, ], in particular of clade Ib bHLH TF expression. Clade
  Ib bHLH act as transcriptional activators by forming heterodimers with another key
  bHLH TF, namely FIT (FE-DEFICIENCY INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, bHLH29). The expression
  of FIT is also induced in response to Fe shortage (indirect activation by the clade
  IVc bHLH TF). Downstream this pathway, two R2R3-MYB whose expression is dependent
  on FIT and clade IVc bHLH, MYB10 and MYB72, also act as transcriptional activators.
  The combined action of PYE, clade Ib bHLH TF, FIT, MYB10 and MYB72 contribute to
  maintain Fe homeostasis when Fe availability is scarce by regulating the expression
  of structural genes involved in Fe uptake, transport and storage. In green are the
  genes for which the Fe deficiency induced expression is reduced when both Fe and
  S deficiencies occurs.
