caption: MAPK signaling pathway. Schematic depicting the physiological activation
  of BRAF within the MAPK signaling pathway. Position of a wild-type BRAF kinase dimer
  (either BRAF/BRAF or BRAF/CRAF) within the MAPK signaling pathway. Receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) receive signaling from ligands (indicated by blue triangles), which
  then begin a signaling cascade that passes through RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, and into
  the nucleus to impact cell proliferation and survival. In a wild-type cell, these
  processes can be activated and inactivated through regulation pathways that conserve
  typical metabolic order, but oncogenic mutations to these kinases can disrupt the
  cell’s ability to control these signals [10]. “Created with BioRender.com”
