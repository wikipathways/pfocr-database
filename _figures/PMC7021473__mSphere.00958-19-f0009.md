caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in major metabolic pathways
  during development from the mature spore to the sporoplasm. The DEGs were mapped
  to the KEGG pathway database. Significantly changed pathways involved trehalose
  synthesis metabolism (green), glycolysis (orange), pentose phosphate (gray), purine
  and pyrimidine metabolism (brown), and chitin synthesis (yellow). The metabolites
  are in black. The upregulated enzymes are highlighted in red, and downregulated
  proteins are in blue (P < 0.05).
