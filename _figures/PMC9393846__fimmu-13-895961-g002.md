caption: Mechanisms through which chromosome instability (CIN) and aneuploidy escape
  the antitumor immune response. Persistent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and
  the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) lead to a chronic inflammatory
  microenvironment, which impairs the antitumor immune response and facilitates an
  immunosuppressive microenvironment. Loss of neoantigens and antigen presentation
  machinery during CIN, along with competitive inhibition by self-peptides attributed
  to protein imbalance, decreases the immunogenicity of CIN/aneuploid cells.
