caption: 'The combined application of several platforms based on nano‐delivery and
  self‐cellular drug delivery in drug resistance. (a). Reversal of MDR in tumor cells
  by a GST inhibitor nanoparticle delivery system. (b). FA‐targeted/GSH‐sensitive
  PTX‐loaded drug delivery system. (c). Theranostic Pt(IV)‐NPs for overcoming cisplatin
  resistance via cancer‐specific targeting of mitochondria. (d). SiRNA is conjugated
  with carriers forming carrier‐siRNA conjugates; SAMiRNA is a nanoparticle formed
  by the self‐assembly of siRNA modified by lipids and PEG molecules. (e). Lipid mixture‐encapsulated
  Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA form cLNPs. (f). Adipocytes loaded with RA and pDox can arrive
  at the cancer nest via lipid metabolic pathways. (g). Drug‐loaded LNT cells can
  return to the cancer nest via the bone marrow homing pathway. Abbreviations: cLNPs:
  CRISPR lipid nanoparticles; FA: Folic acid; LNT cells: liquid nitrogen–treated AML
  cells; pDox: Doxorubicin prodrug; RA: Rumenic acid'
