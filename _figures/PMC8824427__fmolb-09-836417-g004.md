caption: The mTor pathway illustrating two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2).
  The pathway is stimulated by different growth factors. The mTORC2 activated Akt.
  Multiple cell functions are regulated by both mentioned complexes that are considered
  vital for cancer development. Also, in the figure different steps of the pathway
  that can be blocked by inhibitors are shown (; ).
