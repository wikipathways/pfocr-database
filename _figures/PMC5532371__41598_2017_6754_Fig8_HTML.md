caption: A possible pathway for pre-miR-199a-mediated regulation of HSV-1 secondary
  envelopment. Dashed lines denote hypothetical mechanisms. Both miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-3p
  generated from pre-miR-199a inhibit ARHGAP21 protein synthesis, resulting in the
  accumulation of GTP-binding Cdc42 (activation) in the Golgi apparatus. This activation
  would disturb secondary envelopment of HSV-1. Disturbance of secondary envelopment
  may be due to low efficiency in maintenance of trans-Golgi cisternae during HSV-1
  infection, transport of some HSV-1 protein(s) essential for virion maturation, or
  unknown mechanism(s).
