caption: Summary of the main NO systhetic pathways and NO functions in plant growth,
  development and defense processes. NO may be synthesized by enzymatically and non-enzymatically
  pathways. In enzymatic pathway, nitrate reductase (NR; Rockel et al., ), Nitrite-NO
  reductase (Ni-NOR; Stöhr et al., ) and xanthine oxidase (XOR; Corpas et al., ) could
  convert NO and NO to NO. Meanwhile, because of NOS-like enzyme (Guo et al., ), L-Arginine
  may be catalyzed to NO. In non-enzymatic pathway, N could be transformed to NO through
  nitrification and denitrification (Skiba et al., ). NO plays an important signaling
  molecule in plant. It could regulate developmental and physiological processes such
  as seed germination (Wang et al., ), root development (Liao et al., ) and stomatal
  closure (Shi C. et al., ). Also, it may be involved in response to abiotic stresses
  such as cold (Fan et al., ), salt (Liu W. et al., ) and drought (Shan et al., ).
