caption: PARP-1 and mitochondria in the excitotoxic cell death pathway. Ischemia produces
  both glutamate release and impaired glutamate reuptake, resulting in sustained action
  at NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This, in turn, triggers neuronal nitric oxide
  and superoxide production, by nNOS and NOX2, respectively. Both nitric oxide and
  superoxide can independently react with DNA, and they can also combine with each
  other to form the much more reactive compound, peroxynitrite. Extensive DNA damage
  induces extensive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1), which, in
  turn, causes mitochondrial depolarization and the onset of mitochondrial cell death
  programs. For simplicity, the diagram omits many regulatory factors and other contributory
  factors that influence excitotoxic cell death
