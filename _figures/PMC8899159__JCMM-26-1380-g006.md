caption: 'Upstream network analysis of male and female mice exposed to ponatinib and
  Notch‐1 signalling inhibition. Panel A‐B: The image shows upstream activation of
  the β‐oestradiol gene (A) in female PON‐treated compared to female vehicle‐treated
  mice, resulting in a z‐score of 4.28, and the upstream activation of inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS2) gene (B) in male PON‐treated compared to male PON+siRNA‐Notch1‐treated
  mice, resulting in a z‐score of 2.03 respectively. Blue colour keys indicate inhibited
  regulators, while orange ones indicate the activated regulators. The intensity of
  colours is proportional to the score prediction value. z scores >2.0 indicate that
  a molecule and/or function is activated'
