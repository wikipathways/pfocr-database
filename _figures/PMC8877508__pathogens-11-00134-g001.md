caption: (a) Cells that are reported to express TLR8 under basal conditions; (b) TLR7
  and TLR8 signaling pathways have the common adaptor protein MyD88. IFN-α expression
  after TLR7 can be achieved by forming the complex MyD88-IRF7 or by the activation
  of IRF7 via TRAF6. TRAF6 also activates AP-1 and weakly NF-kB, promoting inflammatory
  cytokine expression. TLR8 induces a more potent inflammatory cytokine response than
  TLR7 via the activation of TRAF6-NF-kB pathway, while the induction of IFN-b by
  TLR8 is achieved through the activation of the IRF3/7 pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
