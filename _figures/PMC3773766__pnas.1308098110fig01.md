caption: Summary of the aerobic and anaerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathways from
  precorrin-2 to cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide. The fully characterized aerobic pathway
  (blue) is compared with the anaerobic pathway (red), and many of the steps are predicted
  from sequence homology to the aerobic pathway (–). These unknown steps are referred
  to as the black box.
