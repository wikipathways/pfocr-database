caption: Dynamic Changes in Glucose Metabolism Underly NK Cell Effector Potential.
  NK cells are primarily fueled by glucose. Following uptake into the cytoplasm, glucose
  is first converted to pyruvate through glycolysis, generating two molecules of adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) per glucose molecule. Pyruvate is then either converted to lactate
  and expelled from the cell or transported to the mitochondria where it is further
  metabolized through the citrate malate shuttle (CMS) to fuel the electron transport
  chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), driving efficient production
  of ATP. Basal rates of glycolysis and OxPhos are sufficient to fuel the homeostatic
  needs and acute effector functions of resting NK cells. Following prolonged cytokine
  stimulation NK cells experience an increase in the rates of glycolysis and OxPhos
  to support their increased capacity for IFNγ production and cytotoxic activity.
  Highly cytotoxic NK cells can also undergo cytokine-induced metabolic reprogramming
  towards glycolysis through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master
  regulator of cellular metabolism. An increased capacity for glucose-driven metabolism
  and more robust activation of the mTOR pathway identifies NK cells with the greatest
  cytotoxic potential. Created with (Biorender.com).
