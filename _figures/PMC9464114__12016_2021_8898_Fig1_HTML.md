caption: The pathogenic mechanism of anti-dsDNA antibodies in neuropsychiatric lupus,
  lupus nephritis, and CLE. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can cause the apoptotic cell death
  of primary neurons by activation of caspase 3 and react with NMDAR, leading to a
  calcium influx and neuronal excitotoxicity. After binding to DNA and non-DNA antigens,
  the anti-dsDNA antibodies induce apoptosis via upregulation of the p53 or Fas gene.
  The internalized anti-dsDNA antibodies activate the protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3)
  signaling pathways; attract immune cells; and enhance cellular proliferation. The
  deposition of anti-dsDNA IgG, proinflammatory or profibrogenic cytokines, the TWEAK/Fn14,
  and epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMT) signaling pathways initiate renal fibrosis
  in lupus nephritis. Anti-DNA IgG specifically binds to keratinocytes, which promotes
  the secretion of proinflammatory factors and keratinocyte apoptosis via the TWEAK/Fn14
  signaling pathway. This subsequently induces an infiltration of immune cells
