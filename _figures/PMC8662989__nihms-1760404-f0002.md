caption: 'Post-prandial glucose and fructose fates inside the hepatocyte. In the fed
  state, glucose and fructose are transported into the hepatocyte via the glucose
  transporter, and then catabolized to glucose-6-phosphate or fructose-1-phosphate,
  by glucokinase and ketohexokinase respectively. Left, Glucose-6-phosphate is catabolized
  via glycolysis to pyruvate. Glucose-6-phosphate also induces de novo lipogenic gene
  transcription by activating the transcription factor, Carbohydrate response element
  binding protein. Glucokinase regulatory protein regulates glucose catabolism overall
  by suppressing glucokinase activity. Right, The ketohexokinase reaction generates
  fructose-1-phosphate, from which aldolase B initiates fructolytic conversion toward
  pyruvate, triacylglycerol, and ultimately VLDL synthesis. Pyruvate from glycolysis
  and fructolysis is catabolized to lactate, or it is transported via the mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier to undergo oxidative metabolism in the mitochondrion. ATP production
  inhibits a key fasting regulator kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase. The ketohexokinase
  reaction also generates ADP, which is further catabolized to AMP. This provides
  substrate, which is shunted toward uric acid production via AMP deaminase. Dark
  grey enzymes are selective to the glucose-metabolic pathway. Light blue-colored
  enzymes represent fructose-selective catabolic pathways. Dark blue-colored enzymatic
  pathways represent common points of intervention in carbohydrate metabolism. Abbreviations:
  AldoB, aldolase B; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ChREBP, carbohydrate response
  element binding protein; CR, caloric restriction; FOXO, forkhead box transcriptiion
