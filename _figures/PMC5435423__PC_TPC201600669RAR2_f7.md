caption: Model of the Cold Stress Response in Arabidopsis during the Day and Night.Plants
  recognize cold stress as two different signals and induce the three DREB1 genes
  encoding main switches of the cold stress response. The DREB1 genes are tandemly
  arrayed in the Arabidopsis genome in the order of DREB1B, DREB1A, and DREB1C. One
  of the signals is caused by a rapid drop in temperature. In this signaling pathway,
  CAMTA3 and CAMTA5 activate expression of DREB1B and DREB1C. The other signal is
  caused by low temperatures in general and includes both rapid and slow decreases
  in temperature. This signal activates expression of DREB1A and DREB1C strongly and
  that of DREB1B weakly. Activation of this signaling pathway may be controlled by
  the central oscillator of the circadian clock, involving CCA1 and LHY. During the
  day, both signaling systems efficiently function in response to slow and rapid temperature
  decreases. During the evening, only the signaling system involving CAMTAs is activated
  in response to a rapid temperature decrease. The arrows indicate positive regulatory
  pathways, and the question marks denote factors that remain to be confirmed.
