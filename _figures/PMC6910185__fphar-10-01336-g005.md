caption: Molecular targets of genistein (Gen) in cancer cell cycle. Although genistein
  activates the expression of ATM protein family and ATM-related (ATR), and further
  activates the checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1, which in turn phosphorylate Cdc25C.
  However, genistein promotes cytoplasmic relocalization and or degradation of Cdc25C,
  which would prevent cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)/cyclin B from being dephosphorylated
  and cause G2 arrest. ATM may also modulate transcriptional regulation of cell cycle
  progression through modification the expression of p53 and Mdm2, or through activation
  of Chk2, which can further modulate p53, E2F1 expression, leading to an upregulation
  in the p21 expression that would inhibit Cdk2 activity. ATM also phosphorylates
  the p53 tumor suppressor though the induction of Cdk inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1. Genistein
  also could inactivate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase
  (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathway, whether through the prevention
  of the phosphorylation of Act and upregulation of the prime time entertainment network
  (PTEN) expression. Genistein may also mediate cell cycle arrest by suppressing NF-κB-mediated
  activation of cyclin D1 expression.
