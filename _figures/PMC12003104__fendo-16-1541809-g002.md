caption: Relationship between iron metabolism disorder and diabetes and its complications.
  Plasma iron and ferritin levels increase in T2DM patients. Iron accumulates in liver
  cells and leads to insulin resistance and reduced secretion through oxidative stress
  pathways. In addition, free iron can induce iron death of beta cells by activating
  the ASK1/P-P38/CHOP signaling pathway. Besides, an iron influx in the retina, through
  the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reaction, causes the generation of a series of hydroxyl radicals,
  aggravates oxidative stress, propagates lipid peroxidation, and damages neurons,
  retinal endothelial cells (REC) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPEC), which may
  catalyze the induction of ferroptosis, and lead to diabetic retinopathy (DR). Renal
  damage in patients with diabetes nephropathy leads to abnormal iron metabolism,
  including decreased absorption, increased release and decreased utilization of iron,
  which aggravates iron deficiency and leads to anemia
