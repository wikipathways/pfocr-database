caption: Role of DADS in leukemia cells. DADS negatively regulates the Rac1-ROCK1-LIMK1
  signaling pathway, decreases cofilin 1 expression and suppresses its phosphorylation,
  which leads to inhibition of proliferation, migration and invasion, and differentiation
  induction in leukemia HL-60 cells. DADS, diallyl disulfide; ROCK1, Rho-associated
  protein kinase 1; LIMK1, LIM domain kinase 1.

  differentiation via the Rac1/ROCK1/LIMK1 pathway in leukemia cells.
