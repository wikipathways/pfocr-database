caption: Proposed reaction mechanisms of various engineered NMs against SARS-CoV-2,
  action mechanisms outside host cell (I) blocking of virus entry through either binding
  with the virus spike protein or blocking its cell receptor (ACE2) by virus-like
  NPs, polymeric NPs, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NPs (has not been prepared yet);
  (II) dissolving the lipid bilayer of SARS-CoV-2 envelope by nano-emulsion, liposomes,
  and solid-lipid NPs; and (III) initiation of extracellular ROS by Ag NPs. Actions
  inside host cell include activation of transcription factors by receptor signaling
  as a response of viral RNA and either the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-1B) and activation of Th2 pathway ending with the formation of neutralizing
  antibodies (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) or Th1 pathway activation and the formation of
  opsonizing antibodies (IgE, C4b, C3b, and IgG)
