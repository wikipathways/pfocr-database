caption: 'A) A representation of an S. elongatus cell with an overview of the major
  metabolic pathways important for day-night physiology. B) Reactions of glycogen
  metabolism, TCA pathway, and central metabolism that are present in S. elongatus
  are provided in more detail. Green arrows in panel B indicate reactions where the
  respective enzyme has a detectable light/dark-dependent redox modification in Synechocystis
  sp. PCC 6803 []. Data about the peak expression time of circadian genes is indicated
  using data collected from S. elongatus PCC 7942 []. Genes colored in red peak in
  expression in the subjective morning, genes colored in blue peak in expression in
  the subjective evening, and genes colored in black have no detectable circadian
  rhythm in S. elongatus. Essential genes and genes that cause light-dark sensitive
  phenotypes when mutated are indicated by full yellow and half yellow-half dark grey
  circles, respectively. Abbreviations: PBS, phycobilisome; PSII, photosystem II;
  cyt b6f, cytochrome b6f; PSI, photosystem I; Fd(red), ferredoxin (reduced); Ru1,5P,
  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 1,3-BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
