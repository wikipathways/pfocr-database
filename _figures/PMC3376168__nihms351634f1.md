caption: During protein synthesis, connexins are co-translationally inserted into
  the ER membrane. Upon proper folding, connexins are subsequently trafficked to the
  Golgi apparatus and trans Golgi network where the individual proteins oligomerize
  into hexameric connexons. Misfolded connexins can be ubiquitinated and degraded
  by the proteasome through ERAD, as in the case of Cx32. Alternatively, non-ubiquitinated
  Cx43 interacts with the accessory factor, CIP75, which facilitates Cx43 ERAD. Connexons
  are trafficked to the plasma membrane on microtubules, where the hexamers dock with
  connexons on neighboring cells, across the intercellular space. Intact gap junctions
  are internalized as the double membrane annular junctions. Individual connexons
  may also undergo endocytosis. Annular junctions or internalized connexons may enter
  the endo-lysosomal pathway leading to the degradation of the connexin proteins.
  Ubiquitination of connexins by E3 ligases may occur either at the plasma membrane
  or after internalization from the membrane. The ubiquitin-interacting proteins (Eps15,
  Hrs, and Tsg101) may act to sort the ubiquitinated connexins through the endocytic
  pathway, until the connexins are ultimately degraded in the lysosome. Autophagy
  of connexins or connexons is another emerging mechanism for degradation.
