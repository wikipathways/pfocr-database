caption: Proliferating cancer cells express PKM2 to regulate glycolysis. PKM2 alternates
  between a dimer that shows low catalytic activity and a highly active tetramer.
  Proliferating cells typically have reduced PKM2 activity, in part, because of tyrosine
  phosphorylation, a modification that inhibits its activity by disrupting tetramer
  assembly. Acetylation at specific lysine residue and ROS-induced oxidation at a
  cysteine residue within PKM2 also reduce its activity. When nutrients are not limiting
  and growth factor–dependent signaling pathways are active, PKM2 is maintained in
  an inactive state, thus allowing the buildup of glycolytic intermediates that funnel
  into subsidiary pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine-dependent
  one-carbon metabolism pathway, to support cell proliferation. When nutrients become
  limiting or growth factor signaling diminishes, cells activate PKM2 to generate
  ATP. (Adapted from .)
