caption: Role of TLR4 signaling pathway in DPN. During diabetes, increased expression
  of TLR4 recruits cytoplasmic TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins, such as myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), followed by activation of IκB
  kinase (IKK), leading to activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB and subsequent release
  of proinflammatory cytokines. High glucose exposure induced the expression of Notch1
  and hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) and Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1)
  in DRG neurons. HES1 is a downstream transcription factor of Notch1. Both TLR4 and
  Notch1 induce NF-κB through activating IKK, followed by phosphorylating IκB. HES1
  activates IKK by inhibiting the cylindromatosis lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD),
  a negative IKK complex regulator. Activation of TLR4 has been associated with the
  downregulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor. Activation of
  GABAB receptors reduced the expression of phospho-cAMP-response element binding
  protein (p-CREB), N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B), extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and PKC. Both ERK and PKC can activate IKK. CREB
  in the nucleus binds to its cofactors, REB-binding protein (REBBP), P300, and CREB-regulated
  transcription co-activators (CRTCs), to form a complex, which interacts with RNA
  polymerase II to enhance the expression of the glucose production gene, promoting
  gluconeogenesis
