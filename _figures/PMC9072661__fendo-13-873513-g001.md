caption: The process of protein modification by O-GlcNAcylation. This diagram illustrates
  the O-GlcNAcylation synthesis and salvage pathways, including the metabolic flux
  and regulation. Glucose (Glc) is incorporated to the cell and used for glycolysis,
  glycogen synthesis or hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme Glutamine–fructose−6−phosphate
  amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1) converts fructose−6−phosphate (Fru−6P) in glucosamine−6−phosphate
  (GlcN−6P). Next, acetylation of GlcN−6P and uridylation of GlcN−1P take place, providing
  the donor substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation named uridine diphosphateGlcNAc
  (UDP-GlcNAc). Then, the enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA)
  catalyse the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc to the target protein, respectively.
  Free GlcNAc can be recycled through the generation of GlcNAc−6P, that can be utilized
  again by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. O-GlcNAcylation can be modulated at
  different points of the synthetic pathway by glucose, amino acids and fatty acids
  metabolism.
