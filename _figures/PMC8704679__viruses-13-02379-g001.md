caption: The Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
  signaling pathway mediates the innate immune response against viral infection. Cytosolic
  viral RNA recognition by pathogen recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors
  (TLR), RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and the C-type lectin
  receptors (CLR) induce interactions with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
  (MAVS) and its co-adaptor molecules, TRAFs, which, acting through the TBK1/IKKε
  axis, activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-3/IRF-7)
  expression of type I interferons (IFNα/β). Type I IFN recognition and binding to
  IFNα receptors (IFNAR) activates JAKs, leading to the phosphorylation and translocation
  of STATs to the nucleus, resulting in the target gene expression of antiviral ISGs,
  and proinflammatory cytokines by transcriptional factors NF-κB and IRFs. A dysregulated
  immune response in rare cases might result in fatal outcomes due to hyperinflammation
  and the cytokine storm. ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-related factor; TBK1, TANK-binding
  kinase 1; IKKε, IκB kinase ε.
