caption: Proposed pathway for coupled production and metabolism of transmitter glutamate
  using aspartate transamination for exchange between α-KG and glutamate. Joint pyruvate
  carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activation generates a “new” molecule of
  citrate (lower left corner) as detailed in . Citrate-derived α-KG exiting the mitochondrial
  membrane leaves the astrocytic TCA cycle and is transaminated with aspartate to
  form glutamate, with concomitant oxaloacetate (OAA) formation from aspartate. The
  mitochondrial exit of α-KG occurs via the α-ketoglutarate/malate exchanger, generally
  acknowledged to be expressed in astrocytes, and the cytosolic malate with which
  it is exchanged, is generated via NADH-supported reduction of oxaloacetate generated
  from aspartate. Glutamate is amidated to glutamine (pathway 1), which is transferred
  to glutamatergic neurons (without indication of any extracellular space in the Figure).
  High extracellular concentrations of glutamate or glutamine (blue arrow) will at
  least in cultured astrocytes make the astrocytic production of glutamate and glutamine
  unnecessary (and/or prevent the reaction for thermodynamic reasons) and thereby
  inhibit glutamate formation from α-KG and the associated transamination of aspartate.
  In neurons glutamine is in a complex pathway converted to glutamate, accumulated
  in vesicles and released as transmitter glutamate (pathway 2). Subsequent reuptake
  of glutamate and oxidative metabolism in astrocytes (pathway 3) is normally of similar
  magnitude as the production of glutamate described above. Cytosolic glutamate is
  transferred to mitochondria via the aspartate-glutamate exchanger AGC1 (aralar)
  in exchange with mitochondrial aspartate generated from OAA formed during the synthesis
  of glutamate (pathway 4) and re-converted to aspartate during transamination of
  glutamate to α-KG. In turn, the cytosolic aspartate is used during glutamate synthesis
  in the transamination of α-KG to glutamate in pathway 1 after transfer via pathway
  4. However, when glutamate production from α-KG is inhibited by high extracellular
  concentrations of glutamate or glutamine (blue arrow) or by excess ammonia (inhibiting
  the neuronal glutaminase []), the exit of aspartate to the cytosol in exchange with
  glutamate during glutamate oxidation will no longer be compensated for by aspartate
  use during glutamate formation. This abolishes glutamate oxidation via AAT, so that
  formation of α-KG must be catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This is unlikely
  normally to take place in vivo since elevated extracellular glutamate only occurs
  during bursts of neuronal activity and glutamate uptake and glutamine synthesis
  rapidly clear extra- and intracellular glutamate. Metabolism of α-KG is only shown
  via malate exit and pyruvate formation. Since this is an oxidation in the cytosol
  it must be followed by malate aspartate shuttle (MAS)-mediated transfer of a reducing
  equivalent to the mitochondria. Biosynthesis of glutamine is shown in brown and
  metabolic degradation of glutamate in blue. Synthesis of glutamine and export from
  the glia is critical since it restores nitrogen balance (otherwise concentrations
  of glutamate and aspartate would continuously rise). Redox shuttling and astrocytic
  release of glutamine and uptake of glutamate are shown in black, and neuronal uptake
  of glutamine, hydrolysis to glutamate, and its release is shown in red. Reactions
  involving or resulting from transamination between aspartate and oxaloacetate (OAA)
  are shown in green. Small blue oval shows pyruvate carrier into mitochondria and
  small purple oval malate carrier out from mitochondria. AGC1, aspartate/glutamate
  exchanger, aralar; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Glc, glucose; Pyr, pyruvate; OGC, malate/α-ketoglutarate
  exchanger. AGC1 is for graphical reasons only indicated during the initial part
  of glutamate oxidation, where it constitutes part of the suggested pathway, but
  not where it is generally acknowledged to function in MAS, i.e., during synthesis
  of pyruvate from glucose (pathway 1) and from malate (pathway 3). The glutamine–(GABA)
  cycle is accordingly extremely dependent upon the abundant expression of AGC1 in
  astrocytes described above. However, if malate generated during glutamate degradation
  does not exit the TCA cycle but is further metabolized to α-KG, allowing re-synthesis
  of another molecule of glutamate from only one molecule of pyruvate and abrogating
  pyruvate formation from malate () trafficking via AGC1 will be considerably reduced,
  although certainly not abolished. Slightly modified from [].
