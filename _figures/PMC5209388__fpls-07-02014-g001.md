caption: Tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis, C1 metabolism, and triacylglycerol (TAG)
  biosynthesis in plant cells. (A) Scheme representing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and
  TAG biosynthesis pathways, and the interconversion between PC and TAG. CDP-Chol,
  CDP-choline; LysoPC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine; PtdMMEtA, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine;
  G3P, glycerol-3-Pi. PEAMT, phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase; CCT, CTP:Pi-choline
  cytidylyltransferase; AAPT, DAG:CDP-choline phosphotransferase; GPAT, glycerol-3-Pi
  acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PAH, phosphatidic
  acid hydrolase; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; NPC, non-specific phospholipase C; PDCT,
  phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; DGAT, diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; PDAT, phospholipid diacylglycerol acyltransferase; LPCAT, lyso-phosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase; PLMT, phospholipid N-methyltransferase. (B) The pathway of THF
  synthesis and the methyl cycle. In bikont organisms (such as plants) dihydrofolate
  reductase (DHFR) is a bifunctional enzyme, supporting both DHFR and thymidylate
  synthase (TS) activities, whereas in unikont organisms (such as animals) DHFR is
  mono-functional. Methotrexate (MTX) is a structural analog of DHF that specifically
  inhibits the DHFR domain. Inhibition of the DHR domain impairs cell division and
  the methyl cycle activity (methylation reactions). Methyl groups are transferred
  from methionine (Met) to an acceptor X via AdoMet, the universal methyl donor, and
  then Met is regenerated from serine and THF. H2Pterin, dihydropterin; Glu, glutamate;
  H2Folate or DHF, dihydrofolate; H4Folate or THF, tetrahydrofolate; CH2-THF, methylenetetrahydrofolate.
  CH3-THF, methyltetrahydrofolate; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  Ado, adenosine; Ser, serine; Gly, glycine. (C) The synthesis of Pi-choline from
  Pi-ethanolamine. Pi-choline is the precursor of PC. Methyltransferases such as PEAMT
  are controlled by the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. Pi-Chol, Pi-choline; Pi-EtA, Pi-ethanolamine.
