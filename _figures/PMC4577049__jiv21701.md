caption: 'Up-regulation of the inflammatory response biofunction in Rwandan adults
  during mild malaria compared with day 30 of convalescence. The Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis inflammatory response canonical pathway was significantly up-regulated
  (P = 1.25 × 10−8 –3.48 × 10−2) during infection and was generated from the differentially
  abundant transcripts at the time of malaria infection compared with day 30 of convalescence
  (P < .001; false discovery rate, ≤0.006). Pink denotes up-regulation; blue, down-regulation.
  Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IL1RL1, interleukin 1 receptor–like
  1; IL5RA, interleukin 5 receptor, alpha subunit; IL-6; interleukin 6; IL-12, interleukin
  12; IL-12B, interleukin 12B; IL-13, interleukin 13; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase 9;
  PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TGF, transforming growth factor; TLR1, Toll-like
  receptor 1.'
