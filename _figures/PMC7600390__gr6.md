caption: 'TRPM2-mediated signalling pathways in oxidative stress-induced pancreatic
  cell death associated with diabetes and acute biliary pancreatitis.(A) STZ-induced
  cell death in pancreatic β-cells associated with type 1 diabetes. Exposure to STZ
  induces an increase in the ROS level and PARP-dependent TRPM2 channel activation,
  leading to cell death in a signalling pathway elucidated mainly based on examining
  H2O2-induced cell death in INS-1 insulin-secreting cells. Activation of the TRPM2
  channel on the cell surface induces Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ increase,
  and activation of TRPM2 in the lysosomes results in lysosomal Zn2+ release. Alterations
  in intracellular Ca2+ and Zn2+ homeostasis lead to apoptosis. (B) Palmitate-induced
  cell death in pancreatic β-cells associated with type 2 diabetes. Exposure to palmitate
  triggers activation of NOX for ROS generation. ROS-induced PARP-dependent TRPM2
  channel activation in the lysosomes results in lysosomal Zn2+ release, mitochondrial
  Zn2+ accumulation, recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondrial and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial
  fission, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. (C) Bile acid-induced
  cell death in pancreatic acinar cells associated with acute biliary pancreatitis.
  Exposure to CDC induces ROS generation and TRPM2 channel activation likely via PARP,
  leading to intracellular Ca2+ increase and necrotic cell death. Abbreviations: ADPR,
  ADP-ribose; CDC, chenodeoxycholate; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1; NOX, NADPH
  oxidase; PARP, poly(ADPR) polymerase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STZ, streptozotocin.'
