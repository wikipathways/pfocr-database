caption: Principal cell death pathways involved in intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration.
  With aging, IVDs suffer nutrient deprivation and multiple stresses, and undergo
  cell death, which eventually results in degeneration. Cells undergo apoptosis through
  both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondria,
  the activation of crosstalk between caspase-8 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist
  (Bid)-tBid, the important downstream molecules of caspase-9 such as inhibitor of
  apoptosis protein (IAP), second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac/DIABLO)
  and the upstream regulators of mitochondrial maintenance such as Bax and B-cell
  lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), play critical roles in IVD degeneration (,). Two main autophagic
  pathways, including signaling via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to inhibit
  mTOR activity and the HIF-BINP3-beclin-1 pathway, are also induced during IVD degeneration.
  BINP3, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3; TSC1/2, tuberous
  sclerosis proteins 1 and 2; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor.
