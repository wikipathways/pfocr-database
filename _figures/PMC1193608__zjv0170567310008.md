caption: Model of HAV interaction with the dsRNA-induced IRF-3 activation pathway.
  Intracellular dsRNA binds to RIG-I, which regulates downstream activation of IKKɛ
  or TBK1, which form a complex with adapters, such as TANK (), by still unknown intermediate
  components. Activated IKKɛ/TBK1 then phosphorylate IRF-3, leading to its dimerization,
  nuclear translocation, and transactivity. Extracellular dsRNA binds to TLR3 associated
  with intracellular vesicles, inducing recruitment of TBK1 and IRF-3 via its adapter
  TRIF, resulting in IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation. Hepatitis A virus suppresses
  intracellular dsRNA-induced RIG-I-mediated IRF-3 phosphorylation by a mechanism
  acting upstream of IKKɛ/TBK1. Additionally, HAV negatively affects TRIF-induced
  IRF-3 activation, probably inhibiting TLR3 signaling as well.
