caption: In LSCs, BCR-ABL activates multiple signaling pathways that are normally
  activated by a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). In particular, the PI3K and Wnt/β-catenin
  pathways are critically involved. The novel Alox5 pathway we identified plays a
  specific role in LSCs but not normal HSCs (see the text for detail), and this pathway
  may interacts with the tumor suppressor gene Pten. The functional relationship between
  Alox5 and Pten is an important research topic that needs to be studied further.
