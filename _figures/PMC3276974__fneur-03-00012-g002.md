caption: Hypothetical model of LRRK2-mediated regulation of the miRNA pathway. (A)
  Wild-type LRRK2 binds to and phosphorylates 4E-BP1. Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 then binds
  to eiF2c/Ago, which can potentially modulate miRNA binding to its mRNA targets and
  affect gene expression. Interestingly, eiF2c/Ago can also compete with free eiF4E
  to bind the mRNA cap structure, possibly affecting protein translation in addition
  to gene transcription via miRNAs. Note that the interaction between LRRK2 and eiF2c/Ago
  is not shown here. (B) PD-associated LRRK2 mutants could affect the miRNA pathway
  by increasing miRNA stability and function, potentially through the increase in
  the affinity between Ago and phospho-4E-BP1. Obviously, various changes in translation
  and/or transcription regulation are conceivable in this model and need to be investigated
  further. Misregulation of these pathways could have important biological consequences.
