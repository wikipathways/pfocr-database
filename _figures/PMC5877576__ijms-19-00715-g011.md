caption: EGFR multimerization and signaling, illustrating how carbohydrate-binding
  proteins or carbohydrate-transferases can directly affect transmembrane receptor
  signal transduction. (A) To be optimal, activation of EGFR signaling was found to
  involve both a galectin, here being galectin-3, and the glycoprotein MUC1 [,]. (B–D)
  Illustrations depict how the qualitative carbohydrate decoration of EGFR glycosylation
  or MUC1 deficiency can impair EGFR signaling. Red crosses indicate that activation
  of this signaling pathway is compromised, as compared to the situation presented
  in panel A.
