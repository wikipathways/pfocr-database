caption: Filled symbols are 13C, open symbols are 12C. Numerals represent carbon positions
  within metabolites analyzed directly or indirectly by 13C NMR in this study, and
  are included to aid in the interpretation of the spectra. Labeling beyond the first
  turn of the TCA cycle can be inferred from the 13C distribution shown for citrate/isocitrate;
  additional detail is available []. Every pathway indicated in the diagram was observed
  in multiple tumors. The overall metabolic network involved metabolism of glucose
  to lactate through glycolysis and through more complex metabolic pathways involving
  part of the TCA cycle and/or the pentose phosphate pathway (data not shown). Pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate synthase (CS), complete turnover of the TCA cycle,
  anaplerosis, and synthesis of glutamate and glutamine from glucose were evident
  in all eleven tumors. De novo glycine synthesis was apparent in the astrocytoma,
  the metastatic breast tumor, and in 7 of 8 glioblastomas. GS, glutamine synthetase.
