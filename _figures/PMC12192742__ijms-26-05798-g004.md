caption: Differentially expressed genes and metabolites at different levels of heat
  stress and KEGG pathway enrichment. The numbers in the Venn diagram circles represent
  the number of differential pathways. The circle in the figure indicates metabolites,
  the box indicates genes, red represents upregulation of metabolites or genes, green
  represents downregulation of metabolites or genes, and blue represents upregulation
  or downregulation of metabolites or genes in the KEGG pathway model
