caption: Non-canonical antagonism of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by Itpkb delays
  thymocyte β-selection and renders it Notch dependent. (A) T cells develop in the
  thymus from HSC and CLP-derived early thymocyte progenitors (ETPs) through several
  successive CD4−CD8− “double-negative” stages (DN2-DN4) and a CD8+ immature single-positive
  (ISP) stage into CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes (, ). DP cells then undergo
  positive and negative selection to mature into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. At the DN3a
  stage, expression of a pre-T cell receptor (TCR) composed of an invariant pre-TCRα
  (pTα) chain and a fully rearranged TCRβ chain triggers metabolic activation, proliferation,
  survival, β chain allelic exclusion, the initiation of TCRα chain somatic gene rearrangements,
  acquisition of the α/β T cell fate, and developmental progression to the DP stage.
  DP thymocytes express a mature TCR composed of fully rearranged α and β chains.
  The DN3-to-DP transition requires pre-TCR and costimulatory Notch signals. This
  process is termed β-selection, because it allows only DN3 cells expressing a functional
  TCRβ chain to survive and mature. (B) Based on studies in Itpkb−/− mice, we recently
  proposed a model in which pre-TCR and Notch signaling both activate PI3K to produce
  PIP3 in DN3 cells. PIP3 then recruits and activates Akt to increase glucose metabolism
  via the Akt/mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This is
  required for β-selection. However, pre-TCR signaling also activates Itpkb to produce
  IP4, which competes with PIP3 for Akt pleckstrin homology domain binding and limits
  Akt recruitment and signaling in pre-TCR expressing DN3 cells. By limiting downstream
  glucose metabolism, this “IP4 brake” delays the kinetics of β-selection and renders
  this process dependent on Notch costimulation (). (C) Without Itpkb, IP4 no more
  dampens Akt activation. In the presence of Notch signals, Akt is now hyperactivated
  and causes an accelerated DN3-to-DP cell differentiation (indicated by bold arrows).
  (D) In absence of Itpkb, pre-TCR signaling alone sufficiently activates Akt/mTOR
  to trigger DP cell development without Notch engagement ().
