caption: 'Post-translational regulation of iron homeostasis. Iron is absorbed through
  the enterocyte (A). It is first reduced by DcytB and transported by DMT1 into the
  cell, and it is either stored or exported from the cell by the action of hephaestin
  and ferroportin. Two iron atoms bind transferrin, which transports iron to target
  tissues. (B) Iron can be stored in hepatocytes in the storage protein ferritin.
  The liver is the main producer of hepcidin, and its expression can be induced by
  HJV/BMP-BMP receptor, or by TfR2/HFE through the Smad4 or ERK/MAPK pathways, respectively.
  (C) In the bone marrow, reticulocytes take in transferrin-bound iron to make Hb.
  The TfR/transferrin-iron complex is internalized by endocytosis. Acidification of
  the endosome induces the release of iron from transferrin. Iron is reduced and exported
  into the cytoplasm and used for Hb synthesis in the mitochondria. TfR and transferrin
  are recycled back to the cell membrane. (D) RBCs transport the synthesized Hb and
  are involved in oxygen and CO2 exchange with different tissues. (E) Effete RBCs
  are recycled via the reticuloendothelial system. Macrophages phagocytose the RBCs
  and recycle the iron. (F) AT secretes adipokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-6 that induce hepcidin expression via the JAK/STAT3 pathway. It is not
  confirmed whether hepcidin made in AT goes into circulation. (G) Transferrin and
  hepcidin go to different tissues in the body that utilize iron. (H) PBMCs are one
  of the cell types that express ferroportin. Hepcidin binds ferroportin and induces
  its internalization and degradation, increasing the intracellular iron pool. (I)
  Different proteins are found in circulation, and their levels affect or are affected
  by iron status. AT, adipose tissue; DcytB, duodenal cytochrome B; DMT1, divalent
