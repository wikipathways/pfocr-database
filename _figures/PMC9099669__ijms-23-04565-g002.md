caption: Portraying the active participation of genetic mutations, environmental toxins,
  and pathogenic processes in the progression/evolvement of Parkinson’s disease. The
  trio, namely genetic mutations (SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, UCHL1, PINK1, GBA, LRRK2, VPS35,
  ATP13A2, HTRA2, and SYNJ1), subjection to environmental toxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA, CH3OH,
  PERC, TCE, CCl4, zineb, paraquat, rotenone, dieldrin, ziram, thiram, nabam, maneb,
  copper, and iron), and pathogenic mechanisms (oxidative stress, dysfunction of ALP,
  abnormality in UPS, mitochondrial devastation, nerve cell inflammation, clumping
  of α-synuclein, and programmed cell death), give rise to dopaminergic nerve cell
  demise, which as a result culminates in the progression/evolvement of PD. SNCA,
  α-synuclein; Parkin, Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin–protein ligase; DJ-1, protein deglycase;
  UCHL1, ubiquitin carboxy (C)-terminal hydrolase L1; PINK1, PTEN-induced kinase 1;
  GBA, glucocerebrosidase; LRRK2, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; VPS35, vacuolar protein
  sorting 35; ATP13A2, neuronal P-type adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase gene; HTRA2,
  high temperature requirement A2; SYNJ1, synaptojanin 1; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine;
  6-OHDA, 6-hydroxy DA; CH3OH, methanol; PERC, perchloroethylene; TCE, trichloroethylene;
  CCl4, carbon tetrachloride; ALP, autophagy lysosomal pathway; UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome
  system; PD, Parkinson’s disease.
