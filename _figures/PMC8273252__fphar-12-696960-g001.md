caption: 'Schematic representation of pharmacogenetic variants leading to TKI resistance
  in CML. Mutations in BCR-ABL1 (depicted by the protein loci of the mutation) can
  lead to TKI loss of function. Further, mutations in downstream signaling pathways
  (Mut) might provoke constitutive activation of the pathway or may lead to activation
  of alternative signaling pathways that undertake the signaling transduction to sustain
  proliferation and survival of the tumor cell. Variants in cytochrome 450 enzymes
  (indicated by stars) could facilitate loss of metabolism of the respective TKI and
  thereby impaired turnover. In addition, variants in ABCB1 or ABCB2 (circles) might
  lead to altered TKI efflux and TKI response. The general role of the drug importer
  OCT1 is still controversially discussed. SNVs in mRNAs (polygons) can also lead
  to impaired binding of microRNAs, which itself results in altered gene expression
  potentially contributing to TKI resistance. TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor.'
