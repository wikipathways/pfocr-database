caption: The polyol pathway and oxidative stress induced by high glucose. Hyperglycemia
  promotes the binding affinity to aldose reductase, converting glucose to sorbitol,
  which is then converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The processes consume
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The depletion of NADPH leads
  to a decreased activity of glutathione reductase, increasing the accumulation of
  oxidized glutathione and subsequently decreasing the activity of glutathione peroxidase,
  leading to its inability to reduce hydrogen peroxide. Increased sorbitol causes
  osmotic stress and compensatory efflux of myoinositol and taurine. Loss of cellular
  myoinositol impairs the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase. The loss of taurine leads to
  increased oxidative stress. In addition, during the reaction of sorbitol dehydrogenase,
  NAD+ is oxidized to NADH, and the increased ratio of NADH/NAD+ inhibits GAPDH and
  subsequently leads to the accumulation of glycolytic precursor diacylglycerol (DAG).
  DAG triggers the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and ROS by
  activating NADPH oxidase and PKC
