caption: a) The known branched pathway from pregnenolone to 11beta-Hydroxyprogesterone
  in KEGG. b) The found pathway of BPAT-M. c) The found pathway of BPAT-S. d) The
  found pathway of Retrace. e) The found pathway of BPFinder. The compounds circled
  with dashed ellipses are the branched compounds in the pathways. In the found pathways,
  the reactions that appear with the same substrates and products in the known pathway
  are drawn in green. The conserved atom groups from pregnenolone in the branched
  compounds are drawn in red in the dashed rectangles.
