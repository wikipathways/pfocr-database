caption: 'To carry out their bone resorptive activity, mature osteoclasts secrete
  serine proteases, MMPs, ADAMs, and BMPs that cleave latency-associated proteins
  and liberate coupling factors from the extracellular matrix (ECM). TGF-β1 and IGF-1
  are the two major factors that are released from the ECM following osteoclast bone
  resorption. TGF-β1, released after cleavage of LTBP by osteoclast-secreted proteases,
  acts on osteoblast precursors by activating SMAD signaling to promote cell migration,
  and on osteoclasts to stimulate the production of WNT10B and CXCL16. WNT10B stimulates
  osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, while CXCL16 collaborates with TGF-β
  to enhance osteoblast precursor migration to the resorptive sites. IGF-1 is activated
  after cleavage of its regulatory protein IGFBP by proteases secreted by osteoblasts
  upon bone resorption. Active IGF-1 induces differentiation of osteoblast precursors
  recruited by TGF-β1 by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) signaling
  pathway. BMP-1: bone morphogenetic protein 1; CXCL16: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
  16; IGF-1: insulin-like growth factor 1; IGFBP: insulin-like growth factor-binding
  protein; LTBP: latent TGF-β-binding protein; MMPs: metalloproteinases; TGF-β1: transforming
  growth factor-β1.'
