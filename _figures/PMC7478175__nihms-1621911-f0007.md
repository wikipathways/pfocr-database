caption: 'The role of the complosome in T cell homeostasis. In resting cells, intracellularly
  generated complement fragments sustain T cell self-regulation through the fine-tuning
  of basal metabolic activity via both. C3a generated by CTSL or the recycling pathway
  (shown in ) and cell survival by C5a binding intracellular C5aR1 (through an unknown
  mechanism). This quiescent state is supported by complement-driven assembly of the
  IL-7R and by CD46 sequestration of Jagged-1, thus restraining Notch activity (left
  side of the cell). The brake imposed by CD46 and Jagged-1 is released in activated
  cells, when TCR stimulation drives CD46 shedding through metalloproteases, allowing
  for the release of Jagged-1 and, thus, increased Notch activity. The CD46-driven
  decrease in CD127 expression then also reduces incoming IL-7 signals (right side
  of the cell). ‘Dashed’ lines denote observed effects with the underlying mechanisms
  not yet defined. Abbreviations: CTSL, cathepsin L; mTORC1, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin complex 1; TCR, T cell receptor.'
