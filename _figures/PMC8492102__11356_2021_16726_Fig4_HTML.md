caption: Role of DNA damage in anti-tumor immune response. (A) DNA damage leads to
  abnormal transcription and translation that leads to the formation of peptides known
  as neoantigens. The neoantigens, after their synthesis, are transported to the cell
  surface and are presented in the HLA-neoantigen complex. This complex interacts
  with T cell surface receptors and promotes T cell activity against tumor cells.
  (B) The double-stranded breaks produced during DNA damage regulate PD-L1 expression
  in ATR/Chk1/STAT/IRF1-dependent manner. The PD-L1 expresses on tumor cells and interacts
  with PD-1 on the surface of T cells, and induces T cell anergy. (C) In response
  to DNA damage events, the DNA sensor cGAS binds to the DNA encapsulated in micronuclei
  and catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP then activates the
  STING pathway and induces IRF3 expression by regulating TBK1 kinase. This leads
  to the synthesis of Type-I interferons (IFN-1). This further improves dendritic
  cell (DC) cross-presentation to enhance T cell activation
