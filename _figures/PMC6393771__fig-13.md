caption: Aberrant transsulfuration and transmethylation pathway in ASD. The reverse
  transsulfuration pathway and the transmethylation pathway intersect at the metabolite
  homocysteine. Compared to normal individuals, the levels of several metabolites
  in these pathways are altered in ASD (indicated by red arrows). The levels of the
  major antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and cysteine, are decreased in ASD, in addition
  to vitamin B12 and SAM. The ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAM/SAH) is decreased, which could alter epigenetic patterns. ASD, autism spectrum
  disorders; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine. Color images are available online.
