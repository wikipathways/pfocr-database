caption: Schematic of the mechanism through which miR-378a-3p acts as a tumor suppressor
  in GC. MiR-378a-3p inhibits proliferation, invasion, and migration, and promotes
  apoptosis of GC cells by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of RAB31 mRNA. In addition,
  miR-378a-3p inhibits GC stemness by downregulating GLI1/2, a key molecule in the
  classical hedgehog signaling pathway. This inhibitory effect may be mediated by
  RAB31.
