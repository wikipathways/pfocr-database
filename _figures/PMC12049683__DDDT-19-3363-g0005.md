caption: Mechanisms of TMAO inducing cell pyroptosis. ROS plays a crucial role in
  activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, which subsequently triggers Caspase-1-dependent
  pyroptosis. TMAO can directly induces excessive ROS production and indirectly enhances
  ROS generation by activating the SDHB pathway and inhibiting the ADLH2 pathway,
  ultimately triggering cell pyroptosis. Furthermore, TMAO may also induce cell pyroptosis
  through the Bax/caspase-3/GSDME pathway, highlighting the multifaceted roles of
  TMAO in mediating inflammatory cell death. Created in BioRender. Ge, P. (2025) https://BioRender.com/i00w506
