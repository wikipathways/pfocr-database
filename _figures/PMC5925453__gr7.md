caption: Our Signal transduction pathway model EGFR activating mutations located in
  the tyrosine kinase domains and mainly in the form of a base-pair deletion at exon
  19 (ΔE746_A750) or a point mutation at exon 21 (Leu858Arg) enhance cell growth and
  invasion via tyrosine phosphorylation and lead to the activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  and AKT pathways. SHP2, a widely expressed cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase with
  two src homology (SH)2 domains plays an essential role in most receptor-tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. SHP2 function is required for MAPK pathway and
  activation of its downstream transcriptional targets. When phosphorylated on tyrosine
  542, SHP2 increases the half-life of activated Ras (GTP-Ras) in the cell by interfering
  with the process of Ras inactivation catalyzed by Ras GTPase-activating protein
  (RasGAP). Raf activates MAPK/ERK Kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. Extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) is activated upon phosphorylation by MEK1/2. Dual threonine
  202 and tyrosine 204 residue phosphorylation activate ERK1. AKT is the major downstream
  target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by EGFR. When
  PI3K is activated induces the recruitment of AKT to the cell membrane. The recruitment
  of AKT to the cell membrane drives a conformational change in the protein. This
  enables AKT phosphorylation on serine 473, which is required for full activation.
  Following activation, AKT translocates to the cytoplasm and nucleus, and phosphorylates
  various downstream substrates including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR
  regulates the serine/threonine kinase, p70S6K, whose function regulates protein
  synthesis. STAT3 can be activated not only by growth factor receptors, like EGFR,
  but also by interleukins, like IL-6. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)
  drives the expression of IL-6. IL-6 is a glycoprotein which first binds to a-chain
  (IL-6R) and then recruits the b-chain (gp130) of the receptor. Subsequently, the
  IL-6/IL-6R complex initiates homo-dimerization of gp130, activates a cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase bound to gp130 and triggers signaling cascades through janus-like
  kinase (JAK) and Src kinase. JAK2 mediates STAT3 phosphorylation and activation.
  The major phosphorylation site in STAT3 is tyrosine at position 705. When activated,
  STAT3 undergoes phosphorylation-induced homo-dimerization, leading to nuclear translocation,
  DNA binding and gene transcription. Independently of STAT3, gp130 activates the
  Yes-Associated Protein (YAP1) oncoprotein through direct association with the Src
  family kinase (SFK) Yes. SHP2 activates several SFKs, including Src as top hit.
  Upon Src activation, several downstream Src binding partners are targeted for phosphorylation,
  including paxillin on tyrosine 118. YAP1 is normally kept inactive in the cytoplasm
  through serine phosphorylation by the Hippo effector large tumor suppressor kinases
  (LATS). One Hippo independent mechanism implicated in cancer involves phosphorylation
  of YAP1 on tyrosine 357 by Yes1. As a transcriptional co-activator, YAP1 has been
  reported to bind several DNA-binding transcription factors. Among the reported YAP1
  partners, the TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor is well characterized. Connective
  tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a prototypical target of the YAP1-TEAD complex and
  a commonly used marker of YAP1 activation. Several RTKs or their ligands have been
  described as mediators of YAP1-dependent oncogenic activities.The tumor microenvironment-derived
  ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces inter-receptor cross talk of MET with
  erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor A2 (EphA2), the complement C1r/C1s,
  Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domain-containing protein-1 (CDCP1) or AXL. This provides an alternative
  signaling mechanism for EGFR, thereby circumventing TKI resistance. SHP2 modulates
  RTK signals at the level of the MAPK pathway.EGFR-TKI combined with the Src/FAK/JAK2
  inhibitor TPX-0005 may more efficiently block the EGFR downstream signaling pathways
  than EGFR-TKI alone.
