caption: Predicted biosynthetic pathway of SLs. CL is produced from all-trans-β-carotene
  by three enzymes, D27, CCD7, and CCD8. D27 catalyzes the isomerization reaction
  of all-trans-β-carotene at C-9 position. CL would be oxidized by some oxidation
  enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase MAX1 and then converted to 5DS.
  Red, blue, green, and orange characters indicate genes of Arabidopsis, rice, pea,
  and petunia, respectively. Single arrows show conversions catalyzed by a single
  enzyme, and double arrows denote conversions possibly catalyzed by more than two
  enzymes.
