caption: Possible roles of Hapln2 in Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD), and schizophrenia. An upregulation of Hapln2 is observed in the substantia
  nigra (SN) of PD brain. The high expression levels of Hapln2 promote the aggregation
  of α-synuclein, which contributes to the degeneration of dopamine neurons and the
  pathophysiology of PD. Hapln2 has also been suggested in neurofibrillary tangles
  (NFTs). There is evidence showing the vital role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins
  during neurogenesis and neuronal conductivity, which become dysfunctional in schizophrenia.
  As Hapln2 helps maintain the ECM, it may also play a role in schizophrenia. Hapln2
  colocalizes with several E3 ligases of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). The
  influence of Hapln2 on the ECM and UPP may contribute to PD, AD, and schizophrenia,
  neurological diseases in which ECM and UPP dysfunction have been observed.
