caption: Regulation of active growth, growth cessation and dormancy in apical buds
  of hybrid aspen. During long days, FT and GA are produced in leaves and transported
  to the apex where they activate the LAP1–AIL1 pathway. This regulates active growth
  by controlling genes involved in the cell cycle. Short days lead to reductions in
  FT and GA levels in leaves. This blocks the active growth pathway (LAP1–AIL1 pathway),
  resulting in growth cessation and bud set. Additionally, reduction of LAP1 leads
  to upregulation of BRC1, which in turn interact with FT protein and antagonize its
  action, providing an additional control for seasonal growth. A subsequent increase
  in ABA level suppresses PKL and induces SVL, which establishes dormancy. During
  dormancy establishment, the plasmodesmata are closed by callose deposition by CALS1
  and GA catabolism genes are activated to degrade any active GA remaining in the
  apex. The pathways shown are based on studies of hybrid aspen but most of the components
  are known to regulate similar responses in other species of tree.
