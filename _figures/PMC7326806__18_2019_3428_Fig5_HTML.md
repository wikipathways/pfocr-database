caption: Reciprocal regulation between brain cancer and neuronal cells in the brain.
  Excessive glutamate (Glu) secreted from glioma cells leads to neurodegeneration
  as well as glioma progression. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on the metastasized breast
  cancer cells receive glutamate, and promote breast-to-brain cancer metastasis. Neuroligin-3
  (NLGN-3) is cleaved by ADAM10 and released from a postsynaptic neuron. This secreted
  soluble neuroligin-3 (sNLGN-3) acts as a mitogen for glioma cells, thereby fostering
  glioma progression through a FAK and PI3K–mTOR signaling pathway. Transforming growth
  factor β (TGF-β)1-induced anti-apoptotic factor (TIAF1) aggregates, which can form
  a peritumor capsule, cause neurotoxicity while suppressing tumor progression through
  the interaction with Smad4, WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) and p53.
  Neurotoxicity can also be caused by the formation of TIAF1-Aβ complex. ADAM10 a
  disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10, AMPAR AMPA receptor, APP amyloid precursor
  protein, Cys cystine, FAK focal adhesion kinase, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin,
  NRXN neurexin, Smad4 mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4
