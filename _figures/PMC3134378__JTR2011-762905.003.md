caption: Regulation of HIF-1α by the PI3K pathway. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) by growth factors or activating mutations in the RAS family of GTPases,
  such as KRAS, results in activation of PI3K. Activated PI3K enables the phosphorylation
  and activation of AKT. AKT in turn activates mammalian mTOR by disrupting the inhibitory
  interaction of the TSC1/TSC2 complex with mTOR. mTOR enhances HIF-1 signalling in
  a multimechanistic way (a) By activating the translational machinery proteins p70S6K
  and EIF-4E leading to enhanced protein synthesis of HIF-1α and (b) By promoting
  the interaction of HIF-1α with the coactivator p300, possibly by direct phosphorylation
  of HIF-1α via interaction with the scaffold protein raptor. Additionally, deletion
  or loss of function of negative regulators of the PI3K pathway leads to enhanced
  signalling and activation of HIF-1. These include PTEN, p53, PML, and TSC1/2. The
  phosphatase PTEN dephosphorylates the products of PI3K, inhibiting activation of
  AKT and subsequent downstream targets. p53 inhibits PI3K signalling at multiple
  levels; p53 inhibits transcription of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110α), enhances
  transcription of PTEN and TSC2, interacts with HIF-1α, and recruits MDM2, targeting
  HIF-1α for proteosomal degradation. PML inhibits mTOR under hypoxia and TSC1/2 interacts
  with and prevents activation of mTOR in the absence of PI3K activation.
