caption: Intracellular metabolic profiling of intermediates involved in the selected
  metabolic pathways in RS3. Metabolic modules are marked with color. The modules
  include The Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas Pathway (EMP), the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA left half and TCA right half), the aspartate
  family amino acids synthetic pathways (Aspartate family), the redox equivalents
  and GTP/ATP synthetic pathways (Redox and energy), and the polyamines synthetic
  pathway (Polyamines). Samples of 9 h fed-batch fermentation were applied for the
  metabolomics analysis. The arrows indicate the increase (arrow pointing upwards)
  or decrease (arrow pointing downwards) of metabolites in RS3 compared with MU-11,
  while the bars without arrow mean almost no change. The values were determined by
  dividing the LC–MS/MS peak areas of metabolites in RS3 by the corresponding peak
  areas of metabolites in MU-11. Data are the mean of independent triplicates
