caption: 'Iron depletion leads to: (1) alterations in the expression of c-Myc and
  p53, where iron-depletion decreases c-Myc expression in both cell-types, while decreasing
  expression of mutant p53 (SK-Mel-28) and increasing wild-type p53 (MCF-7); (2) changes
  in the expression of polyamine pathway proteins involved in catabolism/efflux and
  biosynthesis/uptake (increased protein expression is marked by red arrows, while
  decreased protein expression is marked by blue arrows); (3) conserved alterations
  in the expression of polyamine pathway proteins in SK-Mel-28 and MCF-7 cells, some
  of which are downstream of the changes in c-Myc and p53; (4) decreases in key polyamine
  metabolites, AdoMet and spermine, in SK-Mel-28 cells; and decreases in AdoMet, spermidine
  and spermine in MCF-7 cells; and (5) decreases in proliferation, which can be partially
  rescued by supplementation with putrescine and spermidine. Collectively, these data
  demonstrate that cellular iron levels are a potent regulator of polyamine metabolism
  at multiple levels. These results have crucial ramifications for understanding the
  integrated role of iron and polyamine metabolism in the proliferation of cancer
  cells. that cellular iron levels are a potent regulator of polyamine metabolism
