caption: Signaling receptors such as the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, a prototypic
  GPCR, are segregated from bulk recycling proteins like the transferrin receptor
  (TfR) in the endosome and sorted into specialized sequence-dependent recycling microdomains.
  These microdomains are marked by a specialized protein machinery including a dynamic
  actin cytoskeleton. Src signaling, via phosphorylation of cortactin at Y466, regulates
  the rate of membrane scission from these microdomains, and therefore the rate of
  receptor delivery to the cell surface. This allows for specific control over sequence-dependent
  recycling without affecting bulk recycling.
