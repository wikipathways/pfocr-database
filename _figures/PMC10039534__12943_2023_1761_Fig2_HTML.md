caption: Effects of FGFR signaling on the TME. a.| FGF/FGFR promotes PD-1 expression
  and reduces IFNy and GZMB secretion by effector T cells, resulting in a decrease
  in anti-tumor immunity of T-cells. b.| FGF/FGFR promotes Treg cell survival by assisting
  IL-2-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation. FGF also promotes the M2-type polarization
  of TAMs. These functions of FGF/FGFR enhance immunosuppressive effects. c.| FGF/FGFR
  signaling directly inhibits MHC II expression via the RAS/MAPK pathway. At the same
  time, FGF/FGFR signaling also inhibited interferon-mediated expression of MHC I
  and PD-L1 and secretion of CXCL10 via SOSC1. In addition, FGF/FGFR signaling promotes
  PD-L1 expression through the JAK/STAT pathway and initiates PD-L1 transcription
  through the upregulation of YAP. d.| On the one hand, FGFR4 reduces PD-L1 degradation
  by promoting GSK3β phosphorylation at the Ser 9 site. On the other hand, FGFR1 promotes
  the degradation of ubiquitinated PD-L1 by promoting NEDD4 phosphorylation. IFN-y,
  interferon-γ; GZMB, granzyme B; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; PD-L1, SOSC1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
