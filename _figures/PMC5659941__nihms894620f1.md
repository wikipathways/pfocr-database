caption: The three complement activation pathways, and regulatory factors that control
  them, are illustrated through processes initiated on pathogens by the binding by
  antibodies and lectin pathway recognition molecules. At upper right, cells are normally
  protected from these processes; however, when activation is excessive, as lower
  right, damage ensues and additional downstream inflammatory molecules are generated.
  Sites where complement therapeutic inhibitors are focused () are indicated by “X”.
