caption: 'Signaling pathway of G-CSF in breast cancer. In the breast cancer microenvironment:
  1) CEACAM1 downregulation promotes G-CSF secretion by TAMs, thereby promoting tumor
  angiogenesis and initial tumor establishment. 2) By acting on G-CSFR on TAMs, G-CSF
  increases transforming growth factor-α secretion to promote tumor cell migration.
  3) G-CSF increases Ly6G+Ly6C+ granulocytes, which are a type of MDSC and further
  promotes the production of the proangiogenic factor Bv8 to enhance breast tumor
  metastasis. 4) BMP4 inhibits the expression and secretion of G-CSF by inhibiting
  NF-κB, resulting in decreases in the number and activity of MDSCs. 5) In a hypoxic
  environment, HIF1/2 upregulates CAIX and increases G-CSF expression by activating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, which then promotes the mobilization of MDSCs and eventually
  leads to the lung metastasis of breast cancer. 6) Activation of the AKT-mTOR signaling
  pathway increases G-CSF expression in tumor cells, thereby promoting the accumulation
  of MDSCs. MDSCs promote the expression of stem-associated genes, including Nanog,
  LGR5 and MSI-1, in cancer cells via Notch signaling to promote tumor progression.
  Direct effect of G-CSF on breast cancer: 7) Stable expression of G-CSF induced by
  H-Ras upregulates the expression of MMP-2 by activating Rac 1 and promotes the migration/invasion
  of breast epithelial cells. In addition, overexpression of G-CSF activates other
  signaling pathways, including MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and AKT, thus promoting an
  invasive phenotype in breast epithelial cells. 8) TNF-α promotes the expression
  of G-CSF by activating the ERK2 signaling pathway to promote tumor invasion. TNF,
  tumor necrosis factor; AKT, protein kinase B; G-CSF, granulocyte-colony stimulating
  factor; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; MAPK, mitogen associated protein kinase;
