caption: 'A Novel Therapeutic Strategy: MEK Inhibitors to Treat cAMP-Mediated AnxietySchematic
  for the repositioning of MEKi as novel therapeutics for PDE4 blockade/AC activation
  anxiety. In control fish, PDE4 is a negative regulator of cAMP activity. PDE4 blockade/AC
  activation leads to increased cAMP activity and activation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway, and is anxiogenic. Treatment with MEKi reduces MAPK activity and is anxiolytic.'
