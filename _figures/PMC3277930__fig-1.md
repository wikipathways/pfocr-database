caption: Redox machinery of Mtb. During infection, Mtb encounters redox active compounds
  that have the capacity to alter or skew intracellular redox balance. Mtb has evolved
  several mechanisms to maintain redox homeostasis. Mtb utilizes host lipids as a
  source of carbon in vivo, which are metabolized via the (-oxidation pathway. This
  leads to the generation of high concentrations of NAD(P)H during the conversion
  of fatty acids to acetate and propionate. The accumulation of high levels of NAD(P)H
  causes reductive stress in Mtb (, ). Furthermore, host-generated free radicals such
  as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are also capable
  of disturbing Mtb redox balance. However, Mtb counterbalances the stress generated
  by these radicals primarily via the abundant intracellular redox buffer, mycothiol
  (MSH). In addition, protein thiols and mycobacterial thioredoxins (Trx) are also
  involved in detoxifying the adverse effect of free radicals. Another yet uncharacterized
  redox active molecule, ergothioneine (Erg), is also expected to play a role in detoxification
  of free radicals and maintaining redox balance. Endogenous byproducts of mycobacterial
  respiration such as H2O2 and O2•− may react with mycobacterial lipids to generate
  lipid peroxides. In the presence of iron or copper, these ROS can generate the highly
  redox active OH•. ROS or RNS such as peroxide, peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), and peroxynitrite
  (ONOO-), and compounds such as vitamin C (in the presence of metal ions) may also
  lead to the production of intramycobacterial OH• that can cause the oxidation of
  intracellular substrates. Host-generated gases also play a role in inducing mycobacterial
  redox changes. Mtb has well-defined sensor systems such as the DosS/T/R and WhiB3
  signaling pathways, which specifically sense NO, CO, and changes in pO2. CO, NO,
  and O2 interact with the Dos signaling pathway, leading to the induction of the
  47-member Dos regulon. It also leads to the production of the storage lipid TAG,
  which requires large quantities of NAD(P)H for synthesis. Similarly, WhiB3 also
  senses and responds to alterations in cytoplasmic NO and O2. Mrx; mycoredoxin, Mtr;
  mycothiol disulfide reductase.
