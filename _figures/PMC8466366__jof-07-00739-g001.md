caption: Signaling pathways that regulate cell wall remodeling of S. cerevisiae and
  C. albicans. The Hog1, Cek1, and Pkc MAP kinase cascades and the Ca2+/calcineurin
  signaling pathway control a number of cellular processes including cell wall synthesis
  and maintenance. Upstream membrane sensors of the MAP kinase cascades include Wsc
  family, Dfi1, Sho1, and Sln1, detect signals reporting weakened cell wall or alterations
  in the wall, and convey the signal to the downstream components of the pathway.
  The PKC pathway plays an important role in response to caspofungin and activates
  Rho1, a regulatory sub-unit of β-1,3-glucan synthase. Rhb1, an Rheb-related GTPase,
  activate the CWI MAP kinase Mkc1 in response to cell wall stress. An Rhb1 deletion
  mutant is hypersensitive to cell wall stress and to rapamycin []. Rho1 activates
  protein kinase C, which phosphorylates and activates Bck1 in the MAP kinase cascade.
  Bck1 in turn activates the MAP kinase kinases Mkk1/2, which then phosphorylate Mkc1,
  which may hypothetically target Rlm1 in C. albicans. Although the Mkc1–Rlm1 relationship
  has been shown in S. cerevisiae, there is no evidence in C. albicans that Rlm1 is
  downstream of the Pkc pathway. A number of transcription factors contribute to the
  echinocandin stress response including Cas5 and Bcr1 []. In C. albicans, Cas5 is
  activated through an unknown mechanism involving dephosphorylation by Glc7 phosphatase
  []. Cas5 interacts with Swi4 and Swi6 to activate Cas5-dependent gene transcription
  leading to the upregulation of genes involved in cell biogenesis/integrity and cellular
  metabolism []. Cas5 and Efg1 have been shown to interact in response to caspofungin
  stress. Efg1 regulates the transcriptional response to cell wall damage by caspofungin
  []. C. albicans efg1∆/∆ mutant is hypersensitive to caspofungin [,]. Cas5 and Efg1
  coregulate the expression of caspofungin-inducible genes. Cek1 pathway impinges
  on cell wall regulation and has also been implicated in systemic candidiasis [,].
  C. albicans Dfi1, a homologue of S. cerevisiae Mid2/Mtl1 is known to partly activate
  the MAP kinase Cek1 and confer tolerance to caspofungin, CR, and CFW []. A Dfi1
  deletion mutant is severely affected in invasive filamentation and virulence in
  a murine infection model. Msb2 in cooperation with Sho1 is also thought to play
  a role in Cek1 activation []. It is predicted that the transcription factor, Cph1
  a homologue of ScStel2, is downstream of the Cek1 mediated pathway [,,]. Cph1 is
  associated with regulation of filamentation []. The Rlm1 and Bcr1 transcription
  factors control the expression of a number of cell wall-related genes [,] with Bcr1
  playing a dominant role in the regulation of biofilm formation by controlling expression
  of several important adhesins. In C. albicans, the Rlm1 activation mechanism is
  unknown, but once localized in the nucleus, activated Rlm1 leads to the upregulation
  of genes involves in cell wall biogenesis/integrity, macromolecular localization,
  and organelle localization []. Putative Rlm1 binding motifs in the promoters of
  CHS2 and CHS8 contribute to their cell wall stress-activated regulation [,,]. In
  S. cerevisiae, Pkc1 is involved in targeting Chs3 to the plasma membrane in response
  to heat shock [,]. Significant re-wiring of signaling pathways is evident in C.
  albicans, compared to the S. cerevisiae paradigm, for example, the role of the Sko1
  transcription factor in response to caspofungin is independent of Hog1 MAP kinase,
  but involves the Psk1 PAK kinase [] and Rlm1. In C. albicans, Sko1 regulates the
  expression of some genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and remodeling, and osmoadaptation
  []. Sko1 binding motif has been identified for regulating Sko1-dependent genes.
  Sko1 also binds to its motif to promote self-activation. The calcineurin pathway
  is activated by calcium that may enter the cells through membrane-localized channels
  Cch1 and Mid1 or a third minor channel Fig1. Alternatively, the pathway may be activated
  by calcium released from intracellular stores. Ca2+ binds to and activates calmodulin
  (Cmd1) that in turn activates the phosphatase calcineurin. The calcineurin is made
  up of two sub-units, Cna1 and Cnb1. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription
  factor Crz1, which moves into the nucleus and induces expression of genes through
  binding to CDREs (calcium dependent response elements) within their promoter sequences.
  Two Crz1 DNA binding motifs have been identified in some genes regulated by Crz1.
