caption: Regulation of DNA synthesis by Mec1-checkpoint pathway. (A) Replication fork
  during unperturbed DNA replication. (B) Regulation of DNA synthesis and replicative
  unwinding when DNA synthesis is disturbed. (C) The presence of extensive single
  stranded loops in mrc1, csm3 and tof1 mutants impeding the passage through a cohesin
  ring and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.
