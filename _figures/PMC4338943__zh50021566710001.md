caption: Overview of the retinoid signaling (RA) signaling pathway. Through a multistep
  cytosolic process, plasmatic retinol and β-carotene are converted into retinaldehyde
  and finally into retinoic acid. Retinol can be stored as retinyl ester. RA is transferred
  down to the nucleus where it binds to RA receptor dimers (RAR/RXR) and acts at short
  DNA sequences (RA response elements) to activate the transcription of target genes.
  Alternatively, intracellular RA can be catabolized through the cytochrome P-450
  pathway. AKR1B1 and AKR1B10, aldo-keto reductase 1B1 and 1B10; ADH3 and ADH4, alcohol
  dehydrogenase 3 and 4; ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family,
  member A1 to A3 (also known as RALDH1-3); ALDH8A1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 8 family,
  member A1 (also known as RALDH4); b-ctn, β-carotene; BCMO1, β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase
  1; BCO2, β-carotene oxygenase 2; CRABP1 and CRABP2, cellular RA binding protein
  1 and 2; CRBP1 and CRBP2, cellular retinol binding protein 1 and 2; CYP26A1, CYP26B1,
  and CYP26C1, cytochrome P-450 A1, B1, and C1; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyl transferase;
  DHRS4 and DHRS9, short-chain dehydrogenase reductase 4 and 9; LRAT, lecithin retinol
  acyltransferase; RA, retinoic acid; Ral, retinaldehyde; RAR, retinoic acid receptor;
