caption: Schematic representation of lactate-induced oxidative stress. Lactate induces
  the expression of MCTs and SMCTs in chondrocytes, and enters chondrocytes through
  them. Lactate increased NADPH levels by promoting shunting of glucose to the pentose
  phosphate pathway and up-regulates NOX4 expression via binding receptor HCAR1 to
  activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to elevated ROS and further induced
  impaired chondrocytes characterized by promoting expression of catabolic enzymes,
  reducing the synthesis of type II collagen, secreting inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines, and causing hypertrophy and aging. OA, osteoarthritis; MCT, monocarboxylate
  transporter; SMCT, sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter; HCAR1, hydroxy-carboxylic
  acid receptor 1; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NOX, NADPH oxidase;
  HK, hexokinase; Glucose-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  2-DG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
