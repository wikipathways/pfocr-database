caption: VEGF/VEGFR signaling under pathological conditions. The diverse roles of
  VEGF ligands and their receptors drive pathological processes, including tumor angiogenesis,
  cardiovascular diseases, ocular diseases, and metabolic/immune-related/reproductive
  disorders. Key molecular interactions and downstream signaling pathways are upregulated
  or dysregulated in disease states, thereby promoting cell survival, migration, and
  proliferation. These pathways highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting VEGF/VEGFR
  signaling across various disease contexts. ATH atherosclerosis, MI myocardial ischemia,
  DR diabetic retinopathy, AMD age-related macular degeneration, FA fatty acid, NAFLD
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, RA rheumatoid arthritis, PE pre-eclampsia, EM
