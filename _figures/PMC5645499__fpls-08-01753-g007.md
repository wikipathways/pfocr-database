caption: Hypothetical model of signaling for internode elongation in submerged deepwater
  rice. Bold black arrows represent known pathways and dashed arrows the hypothetical
  pathways described in this study. Red and blue dashed arrows indicate the pathways
  regulated by genes in the eQTL hotspot on chromosome 1 and 4, respectively. Green
  dashed arrows indicate the pathway regulated by SK1/2 independent of the eQTL hotspots
  on chromosomes 1 and 4. Details are described in the “Discussion.”
