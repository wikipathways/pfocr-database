caption: Metabolic pathway of tryptophan (Trp). Trp is mainly degraded through three
  known metabolic pathways that can be initiated by the host, plant or microbiota.
  These include the KYN pathway (90–95% of Trp), serotonin pathway (1–2% of Trp) and
  indolic pathway (4–6% of Trp). Several compounds, including indoxyl sulfate (IS),
  kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), are recognized
  as uremic toxins and are marked with blue boxes. The compound acting as AhR ligands
  is marked with an asterisk (*)
