caption: The schematic diagram of the entire study. A total of 776 samples were included
  from The MMRF CoMMpass database. Using univariate regression analysis and the Lasso
  algorithm applied to the KEGG p53 signaling pathway gene set, 15 significant p53-associated
  genes were identified. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to analyze
  the TIC, uncovering six immune cell types with autonomous prognostic risk factors
  identified through univariate regression analysis. Subsequently, TIC and p53 scores
  were derived using the bootstrap-multicox method. Utilizing the composite score,
  we developed a p53-TIC classifier and validated the robustness and generalization
  capacity through external validation on the GSE136337 dataset (n = 215) and internal
  ten-fold cross-validation on the MMRF CoMMpass dataset. Furthermore, subgroup analysis
  explored prognosis, clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden, and immune
  traits
