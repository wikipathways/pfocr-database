caption: Schematic illustration of gintonin-mediated stimulations of donepezil permeability
  into brain. Gintonin-mediated stimulations of donepezil permeability into brain
  might include two signaling pathways. One possibility is that activation of LPA1/3
  receptors by gintonin induces morphological changes of brain microvessel endothelial
  cells through Gα12/13-Rho-associated kinase morphological changes signaling pathway
  that is coupled to increases in brain permeability to donepezil, as shown in a previous
  report []. The other is through the VEGF. The activations of LPA1/3 receptors by
  gintonin is coupled to an increase in VEGF synthesis and release from brain microvessel
  endothelial cells through the Gαq/11-phospholipase C (PLC)-Ca2+signaling pathway.
  Released VEGFs increase brain permeability, as indicated in previous reports [,].
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
