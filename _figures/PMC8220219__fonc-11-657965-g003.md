caption: (A) PLACT1 mediated inhibition of IκBα by epigenetic inactivation. PLACT1
  also enhanced loading of hnRNPA1 to the promoter region of IκBα. E2F1 induced activation
  of PLACT1. (B) HOTTIP formed a complex with adaptor protein WDR5 and MLL1 (H3K4
  methyltransferase) to trans-activate oncogenic proteins by increasing the levels
  of trimethylated lysine-4 at histone-3 (H3K4) at their promoters. (C) SLC7A11-AS1
  blocked β-TRCP-induced ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2. (D) SOX2OT destabilized
  FUS protein by binding directly to FUS. FUS transcriptionally repressed CCND1. (E)
  DUSP1 (Dual-specificity phosphatase-1) mediated dephosphorylation of SAPK resulted
  in inhibition of the pathway. LINC01111 sponged away DUSP1 from miR-3924 and promoted
  expression of DUSP1. DUSP1 dephosphorylated SAPK and prevented its nuclear accumulation.
  (F) RREB1-stimulated expression of AGAP2-AS1. AGAP2-AS1 interacted with EZH2 and
  repressed expression of ANGPTL4 and ANKRD1.
