caption: Kinase targets and inhibitors. A schematic illustration of the principal
  signaling pathways that are affected by the inhibitors, which are described in this
  paper. Protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is inhibited with AG1478 or PD153035.
  Downstream events of EGFR-mediated signaling include a formation of multisubunit
  scaffold complex with the activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. PD98059 and
  U0126 are specific inhibitors of MEK1/2. The PI3K-AKT pathway that is initiated
  at the active EGFR can be suppressed with pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 or
  with the endogenous inhibitor PTEN. The MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways activate the
  specific sets of transcription factors, which are involved in the antiapoptotic
  and cell-cycle gene expression. AKT also regulates general protein translation via
  mTOR kinase, which is sensitive to rapamycin. The TNFR-mediated signaling induces
  via adaptor proteins IKK activity followed by phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent
  degradation of IκB, and release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which regulates
  the expression of many different genes, including antiapoptotic genes. Simultaneously,
  the TNFR-mediated signaling may activate caspase-8/caspase-3 proapoptotic pathway;
  at normal conditions, however, this pathway is suppressed by the NF-κB-dependent
  antiapoptotic proteins. Arsenite upregulates the MAPK pathways, but eventually suppresses
  IKK-NF-κB activation affecting a balance between cell survival and apoptosis
