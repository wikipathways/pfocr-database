caption: PM components (inorganic and organics, mostly metals and PAHs, respectively)
  induce oxidative stress and inflammation. Exposure to PM enhances ROS formation
  and alters mitochondrial function, which may lead to inflammation. The disturbance
  of redox homeostasis alters the activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways
  such as Nrf2. Additionally, PAHs activate the AhR pathway, contributing further
  to the physio-pathological inflammatory effects of PM.
