caption: A holobiont-level regulation of ethylene signaling and plant stress response.
  Ethylene pathway in plants (green area). ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid)
  is synthesized from SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) by the action of ACC synthase enzyme
  (ACS). ACC is then converted to ethylene by the enzyme ACC oxidase (ACO), triggering
  different ethylene response factors (ERFs). Plant-associated microorganisms can
  alter virtually all steps of ethylene signaling. Some species can increase ethylene
  levels by producing ACC oxidase (microbial ethylene-forming enzyme), by inducing
  ACC synthase in plant or by affecting other plant hormones indirectly. They can
  also modulate ethylene response by producing plant hormones that interact with ethylene
  signaling. Other microorganisms can also decrease ethylene production by cleaving
  its precursor ACC. White boxes show ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, green boxes show
  plant hormones and signals, and blue boxes show the molecules involved in the ethylene
  pathway. ABA abscisic acid, GA gibberellic acid, SA salicylic acid
