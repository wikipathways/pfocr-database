caption: Processing and trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the
  endolysosomal pathway. (A) Canonical processing of APP. Under physiological conditions,
  APP is preferentially processed through the non-amyloidogenic pathway (left panel).
  During non-amyloidogenic processing, APP undergoes a first cleavage by the α-secretase
  (mainly ADAM10) within the Aβ domain (red portion) that releases a soluble sAPPα
  fragment and the membrane-anchored C83 fragment (also called CTFα). The γ-secretase
  complex then cleaves C83 resulting in the release of a small P3 peptide and the
  intracellular APP intracellular domain (AICD) fragment. The amyloidogenic pathway
  (right panel) is responsible for the production of Aβ. Under physiological conditions,
  this pathway is active but only a minority of the total APP is processed this way,
  during AD however, the metabolism of amyloids by this pathway is increased. The
  amyloidogenic pathway involves a first cleavage of APP by the β-secretase (BACE1)
  that produces a soluble sAPPβ fragment and a membrane-anchored C99 fragment (or
  CTFβ). The γ-secretase complex then cleaves C99 and generates the intracellular
  AICD fragment and the amyloidogenic Aβ fragment, of which Aβ40 and Aβ42 are the
  most important Aβ species associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The distinct
  cleavage sites on the APP sequence are indicated in black. The two canonical pathways
  for APP processing not only rely on different secretases but also occur at distinct
  cellular locations. (B) Trafficking of APP and its cleavage products. After synthesis,
  APP is translocated in the ER where its N-terminal signal peptides are cleaved.
  APP is then transported to the Golgi apparatus to undergo different post-translational
  modifications that lead to the mature form of APP. From the Golgi apparatus, APP
  can reach the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway (a) where it is either processed
  by the non-amyloidogenic pathway (not described here) or internalized. Upon clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis from the plasma membrane or via anterograde transport (dashed arrow)
  APP is targeted towards endosomal compartments (b) where processing by the amyloidogenic
  pathway mainly takes place. From the early endosomes, APP and C99 can be recycled
  to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes (c) or processed to the Golgi apparatus
  via retromer-mediated transport (d) or remain in early endosomes that mature into
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The cleavage of C99 at the PM (PSEN1) or in endosomal
  compartments (PSEN2 mainly) generates different Aβ species, rather Aβ40 at the plasma
  membrane and Aβ42 intracellularly. Within MVBs, APP/C99 can be further processed
  or sorted onto ILVs in order to be degraded by lysosomal enzymes within the endolysosome
  (e). Alternatively, MVBs can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their luminal
  content; Aβ and C99/APP-associated exosomes (f). The localization of the APP secretases
  in this scheme represents the place where they are mainly catalytically active and
  facilitate the processing of APP.
