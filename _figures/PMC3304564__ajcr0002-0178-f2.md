caption: Therapeutic implications of targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Schematic depiction
  of major components of the AKT signaling module and various pharmacological inhibitors
  (in various sages of clinical testing) that could potentially interfere with the
  activity of the AKT pathway. These compounds, alone or combined with various other
  modalities, may improve treatment efficacy.
