caption: Schematic representation of Dectin-1 and its roles in the immune response
  to Talaromyces marneffei infection addressed in the present study. T. marneffei
  binds and activates Dectin-1 receptor, leading to activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, including activation of IKK complexes, release of p50/p65 complexes from
  the inhibitor complex with IκBα, and translocation of the phosphorylated p50/p65
  heterocomplex to the nucleus, where the transcription of proinflammatory genes,
  such as the cytokines TNF-α and IL-8, is induced. Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase; Dectin-1,
  dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin-1; IκBα, nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide
  gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, α; p, phosphorylated.
