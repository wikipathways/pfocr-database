caption: 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators in clinical trials for
  gastrointestinal cancers (GI) (adapted from []). Extracellular S1P binds to S1P
  transmembrane receptors (S1PR1-5) coupled to different G-proteins, which activate
  different internal signalling pathways within the cell. S1PR modulators bind to
  one or more of the S1PRs to block or activate the S1PR signalling as illustrated.
  Each of the S1PR modulators, as illustrated, are currently registered with National
  Institute of Health (NIH) clinical trials to determine their efficacy in GI inflammatory
  disease. * Denotes S1PR modulators approved for clinical use (see Table 3). JTE013
  is a competitive antagonist specific for S1PR2 (only in pre-clinical use). A denotes
  agonist; Ant denotes antagonist. FA denotes functional antagonist. Note: S1PRs effects
  are dependent on timing and concentration of the modulator.'
