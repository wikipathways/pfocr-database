caption: The disease proteins mHtt, Tau and Aβ undergo misfolding and aggregation,
  which is a multi-step process involving misfolded monomers, oligomers and large
  aggregate structures. Endogenous chaperone proteins of the Hsp family can inhibit
  aggregation and are likely able to interfere at different steps. Hsp’s can be transcriptionally
  upregulated through Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf-1), which in turn is activated by compounds
  such as Celastrol or Geldanamycin that are known to reduce protein aggregation and
  toxicity in cell culture and Drosophila models of AD and HD. Chemical compounds
  that directly interfere with the aggregation cascade are often identified as inhibitors
  of aggregate formation, and with the exception of EGCG it is unknown for most compounds
  at which step they interfere. Therapeutic targets are highlighted in red; Drugs
  are highlighted in green.
