caption: 'LOX-1 signaling mechanistically links atherosclerosis, hypertension, and
  diabetes. oxLDL binding to LOX-1 affects NO catabolism by two mechanisms: (1) increased
  ROS production, which not only reacts with intracellular NO, resulting in the formation
  of cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO–) but also down-regulates eNOS, thereby decreasing
  NO bioavailability; (2) oxLDL, through LOX-1 receptor activates arginase II, competing
  with eNOS for use of the substrate l-arginine, thus, down-regulating NO formation,
  and contributing to vascular dysfunction. Persistently increased ROS can activate
  multiple signaling pathways within vascular cells, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK (p38,
  ERK and JNK), PKA, PKC, PTK, and p66Shc. These pathways further activate the redox-sensitive
  NF-κB pathway, increase NF-κB binding to LOX-1 promoter, and orchestrate LOX-1 expression
  in atherosclerosis. Alternatively, SIRT1 deacetylates NF-κB to suppress the expression
  of LOX-1. LOX-1 is also the target gene of other transcription factors, such as
  AP-1, Oct-1, and PPAR-γ. AGEs act as a ligand of LOX-1 and can upregulate LOX-1
  expression via PI3K/mTORC2/Akt pathway. In light of the cross-talk between AT1R
  and LOX-1, and potentially between RAGE and LOX-1, LOX-1 may provide a mechanistic
  link between atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Ang-II angiotensin-II,
