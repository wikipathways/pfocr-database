caption: Granulocytes role in CRC. Eosinophils have an anti-tumor role in CRC and
  their infiltration into the tumor is considered as a positive prognostic marker.
  They are recruited to the tumor site by CCL11, CCL24, and IL-25 where they are activated
  by IFNγ to secrete ECP, EDN, EPO, TNF, granzyme A, and produce ROS, all with direct
  cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Tumoricidal effect of eosinophils depends on
  cell-to-cell contact and IL-18, which in the autocrine loop enhances the LFA-1—ICAM-1
  mediated eosinophil adhesion to the target cells. Basophils are also beneficial
  in CRC and their role is related to the secretion of the granules content, including
  histamine and proinflammatory cytokines—e.g., TNFα, Il-6, IL-1β—augmenting inflammatory
  reaction, recruiting cancer-specific CD8+ T cells (CCL3 and CCL4) into the tumor
  and enhancing cancer cell apoptosis. Neutrophils possess both anti-tumor and pro-tumorigenic
  activities. Under the influence of CXCL8 (IL-8) they are recruited from peripheral
  blood to the tumor site and prompted for NETs formation, which support tumor spread
  and liver metastasis. Additionally, neutrophils are recruited into the tumor by
  CCL15-CCR1 pathway, where CCR1+ TANs with ARG-1 and MMP-9 activity are associated
  with lung metastasis. In tumors, TANs are involved in local immunosuppression through
  prostaglandin PGE2 and TGFβ secretion, supporting the tumor growth. Unlike N2, N1
  TANs possess anti-tumorigenic functions. Their increased infiltration was shown
  in the early stage of CRC, where they affect the colon microbiome and hamper IL-17
  dependent tumor development. Moreover, activated by type I IFNs N1 TANs inhibit
  angiogenesis and effectively eliminate tumor cells via antibody dependent cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity (ADCC) or phagocytosis. Gr-MDSCs are potent inhibitors of T cell proliferation
  and anti-tumor response. Their mechanisms involve ARG-1 activity, ROS production,
  an increased fatty acid uptake and activated fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Moreover,
  Gr-MDSCs produce high amounts of IL-6 for sustained inflammation in colon epithelium,
  thereby promoting CRC progression. Pro-tumorigenic action of Gr-MDSCs also includes
  secretion of exosomes containing S100A9, which additionally stimulate the tumor
  growth.
