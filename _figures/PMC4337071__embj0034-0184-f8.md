caption: Under normal conditions, a fraction of agonist-activated FXR is modified
  by SUMO2 at K277 by the E3 SUMO ligase PIASy and regulates an anti-inflammatory
  transcriptional pathway in response to inflammatory signaling. SUMO2-FXR increases
  its interaction with NF-κB and SMRT and blocks its interaction with RXRα, which
  results in selective trans-repression of inflammatory genes without entering transcriptional
  pathway regulating FXR/RXRα target genes (left). In contrast, in diet-induced obese
  mice, FXR is highly and constitutively acetylated at K217, which inhibits SUMO2
  modification at K277, at least in part, by blocking its interaction with PIASy and
  results in diminished SUMO2-dependent anti-inflammatory action (right).
