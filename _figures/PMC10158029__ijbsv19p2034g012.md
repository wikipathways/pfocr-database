caption: A model of the regulator mechanism of S100A16 in Glioma. Left half represents
  the Hippo signaling cascades in state “on” that block YAP entry to the nucleus.
  Right half indicates that S100A16 lead to Hippo signaling pathway in state “Off”,
  showing the inactivation of MOB phosphorylation, the promotion of CULA4-mediated
  LATS1 ubiquitination for proteasomal degradation, which results in YAP activation
  and glioma tumorigenesis.
