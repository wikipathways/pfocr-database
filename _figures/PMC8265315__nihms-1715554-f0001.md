caption: The induction of osmotically regulated genes, such as gpdh-1, during hypertonic
  stress (HTS) is regulated through both transcriptional (blue) and post-transcriptional
  (red) mechanisms. At least three pathways regulate the transcriptional induction
  of gpdh-1. First, inhibition of proteins that maintain protein folding and new protein
  synthesis activate gpdh-1 expression. HTS-induced decreases in protein translation
  lead to increased gpdh-1 transcription through a gcn-1/2 and wnk-1/gck-3 dependent
  pathway. Additionally, while significant work shows that HTS causes unique types
  of protein damage and inhibition of protein homeostasis genes activates the HTSR,
  the specific signaling mechanisms linking HTS-induced protein damage to gpdh-1 mRNA
  upregulation are not known. Second, the HTSR transcriptional response is negatively
  regulated by extracellular proteins that function upstream of the transmembrane
  protein PTR-23/patched-related protein 23, and the GATA erythroid-like transcription
  factors ELT-2 and ELT-3. However, ptr-23 is not required for all osmotically regulated
  gene expression and as such at least one ptr-23 independent pathway must exist.
  It is unknown if this ptr-23 independent pathway functions through the GATA transcription
  factors. It also remains unknown if HTS itself can activate ELT-2/-3 through an
  extracellular protein and PTR-23 independent pathway. Finally, the O-GlcNAc transferase
  OGT-1 regulates GPDH-1 protein translation through a post-transcriptional pathway.
  ogt-1 is required for osm-8 and osm-11 phenotypes, suggesting there is some crosstalk
  between the extracellular protein transcriptional pathway and the ogt-1 post-transcriptional
  pathway. The precise mechanism by which ogt-1 induces GPDH-1 protein expression
  is unknown, but it could include regulation of mRNA cleavage, 3’ UTR usage, mRNA
  export, initiation factor interactions or ribosomal elongation. The output of both
  the transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways are two-fold. First, they
  mediate acclimation that enable animals to survive and reproduce in hypertonic environments.
  Second, these pathways may also modulate the function of osmosensory neurons such
  that once acclimation has occurred, behavioral avoidance to hypertonic stimuli is
  no longer necessary.
