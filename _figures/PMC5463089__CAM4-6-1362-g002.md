caption: '(A) Ubiquitination mediates the NF‐κB activation and nuclear translocation.
  β‐Trcp is the main E3 ligase in the IκB ubiquitination reaction. It can connect
  the ubiquitin chains to the IκB, facilitating the IκB phosphorylation, which subsequently
  leads to the nuclear translocation of NF‐κB. In addition, Braf promotes the expression
  of β‐Trcp. (B) Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of MITF. The ubiquitin‐conjugating
  enzyme hUBC9 directly interacted with MITF and subjected it for degradation by ubiquitin‐proteasome
  system. However, deubiquitinase USP13 can stabilize MITF expression and prolong
  its half‐life. Additionally, SUMOylation of MITF by SUMO1/SUMO2 mediates MITF binding
  to the HIF1A promoter and increases its transcriptional activity. (C) Ubiquitination
  of proteins in cell cycle.CDKN2A encodes two melanoma inhibitors: P14ARF and P16INK4a,
  both of which are partly coded by the exon 2 and exon 3 regions of CDKN2A, and down‐regulates
  MDM2 (P53 inhibitor) and CDK4/6‐cyclin D1 pathway (suppresses the Rb protein expression),
  respectively. However, FBXO31/FBXO4 leads to G1 arrest through reducing cyclin D1
  expression, subsequently impedes tumor cell growth. On the other side, SKP2 mediates
  CDK inhibitor P27kip1 ubiquitination and degradation, and promotes cell cycle in
  melanoma. Ub indicates ubiquitin; P, inorganic phosphate; E1a/E1b/E2/E3, exons on
  CDKN2A. MITF, microphthalmia‐associated transcription factor.'
