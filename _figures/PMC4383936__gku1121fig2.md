caption: A VirHostNet 2.0 web interface short tour. The purpose of our case study
  is to visualize molecular cross-talks between two important pathways involved in
  the innate immune response of the host cell. The result of such complex question
  is obtained step-by-step in only four consecutive queries. Step S1. From the ‘home’
  page (a), enter the sentence ‘Regulation of autophagy’ in the ‘pathway’ quick-search
  area (b). Alternatively enter a personalized set of proteins by using the multiple
  proteins search (c). After few seconds of search, the loader image disappears (d)
  and ppi (blue edges) between the set of human proteins (blue nodes)—annotated in
  KEGG database as participating to autophagy function—are represented as a graph
  (e). A summary table (f) provides the list of proteins and the list of non-redundant
  and redundant ppi corresponding to the graph or its sub-selection. Step S2. After
  selecting all the proteins, add viral partners (red nodes) of the autophagy-related
  proteins by using the button panel at the top of the Cytoscape web page (g). Step
  S3. Then add a pin representation of the jak-STAT pathway by entering ‘Jak-STAT
  signaling pathway’ in the quick-search area (h). Step S4. Finally, search for molecular
  interactions (i.e. the putative molecular cross talks) between the autophagy, the
  jak-STAT signaling pathway and the set of viral proteins, by using the ‘add interactions’
  button in the panel at the top of the Cytoscape page (g).
