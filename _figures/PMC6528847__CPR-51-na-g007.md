caption: The schematic illustrates a model of GLP2 inhibits osteoclast through stimulating
  apoptosis. GLP2 enhances the expression of iNOS through stimulating the activity
  of TGFβ‐Smad2/3 signalling in osteoclasts. Overexpression of GLP2 significantly
  increases the product of nitric oxide via iNOS which promotes apoptosis of osteoclasts
  by decreasing bcl2 or increasing Caspase3. Thereby, the ability of GLP2 to regulate
  apoptosis depends on TGFβ‐Smad2/3‐iNOS‐NO signalling pathway since NOS inhibitor
  specifically inhibits the actions by GLP2
