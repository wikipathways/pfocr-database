  including the canonical nitrite reduction pathway (left—blue panel) and the novel
  nitrite oxidation pathway (right—red panel).
papertitle: Long-lasting blood pressure lowering effects of nitrite are NO-independent
  and mediated by hydrogen peroxide, persulfides, and oxidation of protein kinase
  G1α redox signalling.
