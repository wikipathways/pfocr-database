caption: Inhibitory molecules and therapeutic targets within the Rhopathway. Diverse
  growth inhibitory molecules from myelin and reactive astrocytes interact with various
  receptors signaling through a converging downstream pathway within the axon after
  injury to the central nervous system. The activation of RhoA represents a key mechanism
  of this cascade. NgR1 forms a receptor complex with LINGO1 and p75NTR or TROY, which
  is required for Nogo-66 signaling. Cleavage of p75NTR through α-secretase and γ-secretase
  leads to the release of its intracellular domain, which transmits the inhibitory
  signal. The Amino-Nogo sequence of Nogo-A activates RhoA through an unknown receptor.
  The increase in intracellular calcium is involved in RhoA-activation. Interference
  with RhoA-activation blocks the integration of the inhibitory signal into the injured
  axon and results in axonal re-growth. At the upstream level, Nogo antibodies prevent
  the inhibition of Nogo-A-mediated outgrowth. Soluble NgR-Fc or NgROMNI -Fc block
  the binding of myelin inhibitors to NgR1 or NgR2 and the NgR1 agonist NEP1-40 also
  interferes with binding to NgR1. Ephrin signaling can be blocked by unclustered
  EphA4-Fc. RhoA-activation itself is inhibited by C3 transferase and by “small molecules”,
  such as the NSAID ibuprofen. Y27623 and fasudil inhibit the downstream target ROCK
  (CSPGs chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, MAG myelin-associated glycoprotein, OMgp
  oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, ROCK Rho-kinase, RGMa repulsive guidance molecule–A)
