caption: Overview of targeted and non-targeted effects of radiation. Alpha-particle
  irradiation of a cell population can induce targeted effects (in cells hit directly
  by particles) and non-targeted effects (in non-irradiated cells). Non-targeted effects
  can be detected at short distance (bystander effects) or at long distance (systemic
  effects). Genomic instability, another class of non-targeted effects, is not described
  here. In irradiated cells (targeted effects), alpha particles induce DSBs and non-DSB
  clustered DNA lesions (MDS) that are detected by ATM and activate the DNA damage
  response (, ). Alpha-particle irradiation of the cell membrane generates lipid peroxidation
  products (4-HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; MDA, malondialdehyde) from polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFA) (). Alpha-particle irradiation can also activate acid sphingomyelinase
  (ASMase) and this leads to the rapid formation of ceramide through hydrolysis of
  sphingomyelin, a cell membrane phospholipid (, ). Ceramide-enriched large domains
  (lipid rafts) are formed by aggregation of ceramide, leading to activation of the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and its downstream effector, nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) (). NF-κB induces the transcription of target genes, such
  as those encoding cytokines, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
  followed by production of ROS and nitric oxide (NO) that contribute to oxidative
  stress (). Irradiation can also increase the intracellular Ca2+ level () through
  release from the endoplasmic reticulum via calcium release mechanisms (). Ca2+ can
  in turn activate protein kinase C, the MAPK pathway and transcription factors (NF-κB,
  AP1) that promote various downstream pathways (iNOS, COX-2). Mitochondria also are
  affected by alpha-particle irradiation (–). Ca2+ can be taken up by mitochondria,
  leading to ROS and RNS increase, mitochondrial DNA damage, altered ATP synthesis,
  mitochondrial depolarization, and release of cytochrome C and caspase 3. Mitochondrial
  fission also has been observed. Targeted cells can communicate with bystander cells
  through gap junctions or through the release of soluble factors. Extracellular vesicles,
  including exosomes, containing nucleic acids, lipids and proteins, might be released,
  and contribute to bystander immunity. Systemic effects may involve the immune system
  through the release of DAMPs that are recognized by antigen-presenting cells (e.g.,
  dendritic cells, DC, that present antigenic peptides to CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes
  for immune response activation). Altogether these effects contribute to tumor cell
  death.
