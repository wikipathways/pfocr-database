caption: 'EGFR signal transduction pathways. Three steps can be schematically defined
  in the activation of EGFR-dependent intracellular signaling. First, the binding
  of a receptor-specific ligand occurs in the extracellular portion of the EGFR or
  of one of the EGFR-related receptors (HER2, HER3, or HER4). Second, the formation
  of a functionally active EGFR-EGFR dimer (homodimer) or an EGFR-HER2, EGFR-HER3,
  or EGFR-HER4 dimer (heterodimer) causes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of specific
  tyrosine residues in the EGFR intracellular domain. Third, this phosphorylation
  triggers a complex program of intracellular signals to the cytoplasm and then to
  the nucleus. The two major intracellular pathways activated by EGFR are the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK
  pathway, which controls gene transcription, cell-cycle progression from the G1 phase
  to the S phase, and cell proliferation, and the PI3K-Akt pathway, which activates
  a cascade of anti-apoptotic and prosurvival signals. bFGF, basic fibroblast growth
  factor, HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF, MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K,
