caption: Schematical representation of TLR4 activation in microglia and consequent
  dopaminergic neuronal damage in the substantia nigra. A number of pro-inflammatory
  stimuli can promote the activation of the intracellular TLR4 signaling pathway in
  microglia. Upon infection or injury, DAMPs or PAMPs released in the extracellular
  milieu via exocytosis from neighboring neurons are sensed by microglial TLR4 for
  degradation and clearance. If compromised or if prolonged, this process can lead
  to further inflammatory signaling in which the engagement of myeloid differentiating
  primary response gene 88 (MyD88) or TIR-domain containing adapter inducing interferon
  β (TRIF) provokes the activation of downstream signaling cascades that lead to the
  proteasomal degradation of kB inhibitors (IkB), release, and nuclear translocation
  of the NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) transcription
  factor. The transcriptional activation of specific genes induces the release of
  proinflammatory cytokines, that in turn can cause neuronal damage, pathological
  modification of α-SYN (monomers, oligomers, and fibrils, truncated and phosphorylated
  forms), and aggregation in Lewy and neurites bodies—the pathological hallmarks of
  degenerating neurons in Parkinson’s disease. Endosomal TLRs sense bacterial or viral
  nucleic acids.
