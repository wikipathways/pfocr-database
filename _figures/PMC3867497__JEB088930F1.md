caption: 'Conserved stress regulators in Candida albicans. Evolutionarily conserved
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling molecules (red) and transcription
  factors (blue) contribute to the regulation of stress functions in C. albicans (see
  ‘Overview of stress adaptation mechanisms in C. albicans’). Hsf1 and Hsp90 operate
  in an autoregulatory circuit, whereby synthesis of the biological transistor Hsp90
  (green) is activated by Hsf1 in response to heat shock, and Hsp90 then downregulates
  Hsf1 (see ‘Overview of stress adaptation mechanisms in C. albicans’). These pathways
  are represented as linear pathways (for simplicity), but most probably operate in
  an integrated network. Heat shock pathway: Hsp90, heat shock protein 90; Hsf1, heat
  shock transcription factor. Nitrosative stress pathway: Cta4, zinc cluster transcription
  factor; Yhb1, nitric oxide dioxygenase. Oxidative stress pathway: Cap1, AP-1 bZIP
  transcription factor; Skn7; putative response regulator; SODs, superoxide dismutases.
  Hog1 signalling pathway: Ssk2, MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK); Pbs2, MAPK kinase (MAPKK);
  Hog1, MAPK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). Cell integrity pathway: Bck1,
  MAPKKK; Mkk1, MAPKK; Mkc1, MAPK. Mating/invasive growth pathway: Ste11, MAPKKK;
  Hst7, MAPKK; Cek1, MAPK.'
