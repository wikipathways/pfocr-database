caption: '(A) IL-7 signaling is through the Jak-Stat pathway. IL-7 binds to its receptor
  composed of two chains: IL-7Rα and the γc chain. This induces the transphophorylation
  of Jak1 and Jak3 followed by the phosphorylation of the tyrosine Y449 on the IL-7Rα
  chain. Y449 becomes the docking site for Stat5. Stat5 becomes phosphorylated, dimerizes,
  and is translocated to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression implicated
  in differentiation. Socs-1 negatively regulates the responsiveness of T-cells to
  IL-7 by neutralizing the activity of Jaks.(B) Activation by IL-7 induces the phosphorylation
  on tyrosine residues of IL7Rα. PI3K is recruited to the membrane and binds to these
  tyrosine residues. PI3K becomes phosphorylated resulting in the phosphorylation
  of the phosphatidylinositol PIP2 into PIP3. PIP3 recruits signaling proteins with
  plekstrin domain (PH) to the membrane, such as PDK-1 and Akt. PIP3 in turned again
  into PIP2 by the phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome
  ten). Akt becomes active by phosphorylation and activates many downstream genes
  important for cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis. After activation by Stat5
  and Akt pathways through IL-7, and together with signaling through TCR, the synthesis
  of various proteins including Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is initiated. These two proteins prevent
  mitochondrial death by blocking Bim and Bid from activating Bax and Bad.'
