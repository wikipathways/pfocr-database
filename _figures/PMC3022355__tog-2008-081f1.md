caption: 'Biological roles of some sphingolipids involved tumorigenesis and metastasis.
  A variety of stimuli including cytokines, ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents,
  or stress can induce ceramide formation in cells. There are two major pathways for
  ceramide generation: the de novo synthesis pathway and the hydrolysis of sphingomyelinase
  (SM) by sphingomyelinases (SMases). In general, ceramides mediate pro-apoptotic
  and anti- proliferative responses whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide
  1-phosphate (C1P) are mitogenic and antiapoptotic for most cell types. The mechanism
  whereby C1P blocks apoptosis involves direct inhibition of acid SMase. Formation
  of glycosylceramide (GlcCer) confers resistance to a variety of drugs used in cancer
  therapy.'
