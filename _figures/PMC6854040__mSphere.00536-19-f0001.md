caption: Generalized MEV and MEP pathways leading to downstream isoprenoid products.
  The green arrows indicate the presence of annotated enzymes encoded in the R. parkeri
  genome. The gray arrows indicate the absence of annotated enzymes encoded in the
  R. parkeri genome. The orange arrow indicates the presence of the IDI enzyme from
  the host genome. The yellow background denotes the upstream isoprenoid pathway,
  whereas the blue denotes the downstream isoprenoid pathway. The central black arrow
  and white question mark denote the possible presence of transporters for isoprenoids
  from the host into the bacteria. Arrows with double hash marks indicate multiple
  enzymatic steps. Statin drugs inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and the
  formation of mevalonate of the MEV pathway. Fosmidomycin is an inhibitor of DXP
  reductoisomerase of the MEP pathway. Alendronate sodium hydrate is an inhibitor
  of farnesyl diphosphate synthase. d-Cycloserine (DCS) is an inhibitor of d-alanine
  racemase and d-alanine-d-alanine ligase.
