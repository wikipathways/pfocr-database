caption: Proposed model for the function of CalG in the calcimycin biosynthetic pathway.
  Cezomycin was activated to form cezomycin-CoA and then modified to generate calcimycin.
  The hydrolysis of cezomycin-CoA by CalG leads to the accumulation of cezomycin under
  conditions of low levels of available nitrogen.
