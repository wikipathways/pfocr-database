caption: Schematic overview of multiple feedback loops in the PI3K pathway. As described
  in this review, activation of PI3K/AKT signaling is involved in at least three negative
  feedback loops. (i) Activated mTORC1/S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1, leading to its degradation
  and subsequently to attenuated IRS1-mediated PI3K and RAS/MEK/MAPK activation. (ii)
  Activated S6K1 phosphorylates and suppresses mTORC2 activity, resulting in decreased
  phosphorylation levels of AKT at serine 473, which fails to enhance the catalytic
  activity of AKT already phosphorylated at threonine 308 by PDK1. (iii) Activated
  AKT phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO transcription factors resulting in their
  nuclear exclusion, thus preventing them from transcriptional activation of RTKs
  such as HER3, IGF1-R, and InsR, which in turn attenuates the input upstream signaling.
