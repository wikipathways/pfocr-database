caption: Cartoon showing the effect of dysregulated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (miRNAs
  and long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)) on multiple myeloma bone
  disease (MMBD). ncRNAs modulate bone remodeling both in physiologic conditions (on
  the left side of the red line across the bone) or in MM (on the right side of the
  red line across the bone). Under physiologic conditions, osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts
  (OBs) work together to balance bone resorption and formation. Their activities are
  governed by specific gene programs, whose expression is regulated by ncRNAs, i.e.,
  miRNA or lncRNAs produced by MM cells and/or other cells of the BMM, and released
  within extracellular vesicles (EVs). In MMBD, dysregulated ncRNAs contribute to
  enhance OCs activity for instance acting on RANKL/OPG pathway, while OB activity
  is inhibited, thus establishing an unbalanced condition that fosters the development
  of osteolytic lesions.
