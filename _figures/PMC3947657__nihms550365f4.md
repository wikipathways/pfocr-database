caption: This network was identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis with an IPA score
  of 27 (Network 3, ). This network includes 16 genes that were significantly dysregulated
  in the H460 holoclone xenografts compared to H460 parental xenografts, with 11 of
  these genes related to angiogenesis (). Genes up regulated in holoclones are shown
  in red, and genes down regulated are shown in green, with the color intensity indicating
  the relative extent of up or down regulation. Solid lines indicate direct interactions,
  and dashed lined signify indirect interactions.
