caption: The protein–protein interactions between 341 members of antimicrobial peptides
  in Trachinotus ovatus. (A) A network of 341 AMP proteins with their parent and subordinate
  proteins. This figure was drawn via STRING 12.0 (https://STRING-db.org/, accessed
  on 25 September 2022). It has employed a confidence level of 0.40, derived from
  text mining, experimental data, databases, co-expression patterns, and neighborhood
  sources in lines of different colors. The same color within the circle indicates
  that these genes are enriched in the same KEGG pathway. (B) The interaction network
  of 341 AMP proteins distributed by DC value. This graph was analyzed by Cytoscape
  and visualized by Circos (default parameter selection). The colors range from dark
  red to light yellow, indicating DC values from high to low, and the green areas
  are selected HUB gene interaction maps. The abbreviation labels in the figure are
  supplemented in File S3.
