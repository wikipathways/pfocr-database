caption: Pathway impact analysis was associated with the treatment of α-asaronol (A)
  and four disrupted metabolic pathways (B) were visualized based on the impact values
  larger than 0.50, including alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (1); synthesis
  and degradation of ketone bodies (2); glutamine and glutamate metabolism (3); and
  glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism (4).
