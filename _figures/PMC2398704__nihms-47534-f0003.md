caption: 'Variation the insulin/insulin-like (IIS) pathway, including cross talk with
  target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling, is a possible explanation for the different
  life history syndromes of high and low pollen-hoarding strain bees. a: In general,
  insulin-like peptides (insulin/IGF-1) bind to the insulin receptor (InR). The resulting
  signal is transmitted via components of second messenger pathways, and effects on
  fat body synthesis of yolk peptides/protein (vitellogenin), ovarian maturation state,
  organismal growth, development, and behavior emerge via pleiotropic cascades that
  involve systemic hormones (e.g. juvenile hormone, JH). Note that the feedback relationship()
  between vitellogenin and JH (blue asterisks) in honey bees is uncommon in insects,()
  and may emerge via vitellogenin-mediated regulation of IIS() Signal transmission
  can be conditional on nutrients (amino acids) and/or energy status, through cross
  talk with the nutrient sensing TOR pathway. b: Explicitly, the genomic regions associated
  with the pollen-hoarding behavioral and physiological syndrome (QTL Pln1–4) are
  characterized by a density of IIS/TOR pathway components that is much higher than
  expected by chance alone (see Hunt et al.). Abbreviations: PI, phosphoinositol;
  PIP, phosphoinositol phosphate; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3
  kinase (class I or II); PIP5K, 1-phosphatydylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase; PIG-P,
  phosphatidyl-inositolglycan-peptide; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1;
