caption: 'UPR signaling pathways. IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 are three sensors of the UPR
  pathway. ER stress releases GRP78 from these sensors. After this release, activated
  PERK induces the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation and ATF4
  is activated and translocated to the nucleus to trigger the transcription of certain
  genes. IRE1α is autophosphorylated and oligomerized in response to ER stress. The
  activated IRE-1 provides the active form of the X-box binding protein (XBP1) transcription
  factor mRNA, which contributes to protein folding by regulating the expression of
  genes related to the proper unfolding of proteins and the secretion and destruction
  of the ER proteins. ATF6 is processed by Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease
  (S2P). Activated ATF6 also translocates to the nucleus and, as a transcription factor,
  induces the transcription of ER chaperones. IRE1: inositol-requiring enzymes; PERK:
  protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6;
  GRP78: glucose-regulated protein 78; eIF2: eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ATF4:
  activating transcription factor 4; XBP1: X-box binding protein; ERAD: endoplasmic-reticulum-associated
  protein degradation; GADD34: growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 34;
  RIDD: regulated IRE1-dependent decay; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase.'
