caption: Essential elements of auxin signaling and transport in plant cells. Auxin
  perception by nuclear SCFTIR1/AFB (blue, yellow) triggers ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
  degradation of Aux/IAA co-receptors (green). As a result transcriptional repression
  via TPL (grey) activity and via Aux/IAA-mediated inhibition of ARF transcriptional
  regulators (red) is relieved. Auxin binding by extracellular ABP1 (lilac) impacts
  on endocytic protein sorting (see also Fig. ), whereas the role of ER-resident ABP1
  is still not known. Cellular uptake of auxin is mediated by AUX1/LAX-type permeases
  (green) and by selected ABCB-type transporters (pink). Cellular auxin efflux requires
  PIN- (blue) and ABCB-type (pink) transport proteins. Auxin sequestration between
  cytoplasm and ER involves activity of PILS and PIN proteins (turquois) lacking the
  central hydrophilic loop that is characteristic for plasma membrane-resident PINs.
  Auxin transport proteins are subject to intracellular sorting from the plasma membrane
  to sorting endosomes (SE)/trans Golgi network (TGN). Recycling from SE/TGN to the
  plasma membrane involves activity of BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF GNOM, specifically for
  sorting at the basal cellular domain. PIN sorting and transcytosis is controlled
  by its phosphorylation status. PID (light green) kinase activity promotes sorting
  of phosphorylated PINs preferentially to the apical plasma membrane domain, a response
  that is antagonized by PP6 (purple) phosphatase activity triggering sorting to the
  basal domain. Apart from protein recycling and transcytosis between plasma membrane
  domains, PINs are also subject to endocytic sorting via late endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies into the lytic vacuole for their irreversible degradation. Sorting via this
  pathway is controlled by ubiquitination of PINs (red circles)
