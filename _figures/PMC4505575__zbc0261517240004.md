caption: 'Model of recruitment of HLTF to the stalled fork in TS pathway. Colors represent
  the following proteins: ubiquitin (Ub), blue; RAD6 (R6), purple; RAD18 (R18), light
  blue; PCNA, gray; TLS polymerase (TLS Pol), red; UBC13 (U13), yellow; MMS2 (M2),
  brown; HLTF, pink; and ZRANB3 (Z3), green. Primer and template strands are shown
  by green and blue lines, respectively. DNA damage in the template strand is shown
  by the red triangle. The asterisk indicates the 3′-end of the primer strand recognized
  by the HIRAN domain of HLTF. A, RAD6-RAD18 mono-ubiquitinates PCNA to activate TLS.
  TLS polymerase, which possesses a ubiquitin-binding domain and a PCNA-interacting
  motif, is recruited to the damaged site by interaction with mono-ubiquitinated PCNA
  and performs DNA synthesis. B, the exposed 3′-end may be sensed by the HIRAN domain
  of HLTF when TLS fails due to severe DNA damage. The Lys-164 of PCNA is poly-ubiquitinated
  by MMS2-UBC13-HLTF and RAD6-RAD18 complexes. The Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitin chain
  of PCNA recruits ZRANB3, another SWI/SNF helicase, to facilitate the fork regression.
  The HIRAN domain may also be involved in the unwinding of the primer-template DNA.'
