caption: 'TGF-β-dependent metabolism reprogramming of cancer cells. 1. For glucose
  metabolism, TGF-β signaling can: a. enhance glycolysis by directly increasing the
  glycolytic enzyme expression of PKM2 and LDH, and indirectly elevate the PFKFB3,
  which augments the expression of PFK1, one of the glycolytic enzymes; b. TCA cycle
  enzyme SDH mutation leads to TGF-β-induced EMT; c. augment PPP by increasing G6PD,
  the first key enzyme of PPP; and d. promote glycogen synthesis by boosting GYS1
  expression via inhibiting GSK-3 that deactivates GYS1. 2. For cholesterol metabolism,
  a. cholesterol-enriched subdomain-mediated TGF-β receptor endocytosis can: destruct
  TGF-β receptors that abrogate TGF-β signaling initiation; b. cholesterol synthesis
  enzyme NSDHL can inhibit TGF-β1 production and attenuate TGF-β signaling; c. NSDHL
  also prevents TGF-βRII endocytosis and then facilitates TGF-β signaling; and d.
  TGF-β signaling can decrease cholesterol synthesis by inactivating SREBF2, a cholesterol
  synthesis promoter. 3. For fatty acid metabolism, a. canonical (p-SMAD2) and non-canonical
  (p-AMPK) TGF-β signaling accelerates FAO; b. TGF-β1 can increase FASN expression,
  thus allowing fatty acid synthesis and accumulation in cancer cells; conversely,
  FASN enhances TGF-β1 production. Moreover, non-canonical (p-AMPK) signaling decreases
  FASN; c. TGF-β2 releasement by the acidic TMME enables more fatty acid entry into
  cancer cells and forms LD for lipid storage used by FAO. 4. For amino acid metabolism,
  TGF-β signaling can: a. increase Asp, Glu, and Lys, while decrease Ala, Asn, Gln,
  etc.; b. bolster glutamine’s entry into cancer cells by elevating SLC7A5, and enhance
  glutamine’s catalyzation into glutamate via increasing GLS1, and glutamate can flow
  into TCA cycle. Green highlighted items mean TGF-β signaling positively regulates
  them, or they are positively regulated by TGF-β signaling. Red vice versa. And these
  green and red ones are potentially TGF-β-dependent metabolic targets in cancer.
