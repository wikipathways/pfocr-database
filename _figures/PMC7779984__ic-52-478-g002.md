caption: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine triggering
  an inflammatory response via activation of transcription of genes for further pro-inflammatory
  proteins. Omega-3 fatty acids potentially exert their anti-inflammatory effect via
  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway and G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120)
  pathway to inhibit the NF-κB and consequently the inflammatory cascade.TAB, TGF-beta
  activated kinase; TAK, tat-associated kinase; IRAK, interleukin 1 receptor-associated
  kinase; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; TRIAP, TP53 regulated
  inhibitor of apoptosis; MD2, myeloid differentiation factor 2.
