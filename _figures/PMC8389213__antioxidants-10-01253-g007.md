caption: 'Graphical representation of NaIO3-induced model of AMD in-vitro and in-vivo.
  Physiological: (1) Iron-loaded ferritin is transported to the phagophore by NCOA4,
  (2) for degradation with the rest of the cell debris. Levels of LC3II increase with
  the maturation of phagophore to autophagosome. (3) Autophagosome fuses with lysosomes,
  (4) where lysosomal enzymes, including cat-D, degrade ferritin and cellular debris.
  (5) Iron from ferritin is released in the cytosol to be utilized for metabolic purposes.
  (6) Other debris undergoes autolysis or is secreted via an unconventional lysosomal
  secretory pathway to the extracellular milieu. Pathological: (1) In NaIO3-induced
  AMD, iron-loaded ferritin is delivered to the phagophore, (2) which matures into
  autophagosomes. Levels of LC3II are increased because of accumulation of debris
  in autophagosomes. (3 and 4) Synthesis and maturation of cat-D are impaired by NaIO3,
  (5) resulting in the accumulation of iron-loaded ferritin in lysosomes and (6) autolysosomes.
  (7) Iron-loaded ferritin is secreted in lysosomal vesicles in the extracellular
  milieu, which is probably internalized by the adjacent photoreceptors, resulting
  in iron-mediated oxidative stress.'
