caption: The ferroptosis signaling pathway. Ferroptosis is regulated by two major
  regulatory mechanisms, namely the cystine/glutathione (GSH)/glutathione peroxidase
  4 (Gpx4) axis and the NAD(P)H/ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)/ubiquinone
  (CoQ10) axis. The cystine/glutathione (GSH)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) axis
  regulates ferroptosis suppression through the cystine/GSH/Gpx4 nexus is accomplished
  by the main stages of cystine absorption and decrease, respectively, GSH production,
  and Gpx4 activation, among others, and the conversion of oxidized phospholipids
  (PLs) into their homologous alcohols (PL-OH) by the enzyme Gpx4, which uses GSH
  as a substrate. It has been shown that the enzymes acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain
  family member 4 (ACSL4) as well as lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3)
  are involved in integrating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within cellular
  membranes, making them susceptible to ferroptosis activation. As a result, the oxidation
  of lipid bilayers may proceed enzymatically and/or nonenzymatically by auto-oxidation,
  depending on the situation. The antiferroptotic activity of FSP1 in the NAD(P)H/FSP1/CoQ10
  system is attributed to its oxidoreductase activity, which is activated by converting
  extramitochondrial CoQ10 to ubiquinol using NAD(P)H/H+. To avoid lipid peroxidation,
  ubiquinol either reduces lipid radicals (PL-OO) directly or indirectly via the use
  of vitamin E (-tocopherol) must be present. Apart from that, the mevalonate pathway
  produces precursors for CoQ10 and squalene, the latter of which is beneficial in
  the prevention of ferroptosis because of its antioxidant action.
