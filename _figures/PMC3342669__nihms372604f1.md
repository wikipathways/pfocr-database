caption: Reactions of the proline metabolic pathway. In the catabolic pathway, proline
  is converted to glutamate via a four electron oxidation process. Proline dehydrogenase
  (PRODH) performs the first oxidative step, resulting in the intermediate pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C). P5C is subsequently hydrolyzed to glutamic semialdehyde (GSA), which is then
  further oxidized by P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) to generate glutamate. In Gram-negative
  bacteria, PRODH and P5CDH are fused together on a bifunctional enzyme called proline
  utilization A (PutA). Proline anabolism begins with phosphorylation of glutamate
  by gamma-glutamyl kinase (GK) to generate gamma-glutamyl phosphate (gamma-GP). gamma-GP
  is reduced by gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR) to GSA, which cyclizes to
  form P5C. P5C is then reduced to proline via pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR).
  In higher eukaryotes such as plants and animals, GPR and GK are fused together in
  the bifunctional enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS).
