caption: Overview of the canonical and non‐canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the
  canonical Wnt pathway; binding of WNT ligand to Frizzled and LRP5/6 receptors phosphorylates
  Dishevelled. This inhibits GSK‐3 kinase activity and prevents destruction complex
  (APC‐Axin‐GSK3‐CK1α) formation. This stabilizes β‐catenin in the cytosol. Unphosphorylated
  β‐catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as co‐transcription factor
  with TCF/LEF to promote transcription of effectors for self‐renewal. RSPO1 binds
  with ZNRF3/RNF43 and forms a complex with LGR4/5/6 and stabilizes Frizzled. Alternatively,
  exogenous addition of GSK‐3 inhibitor (CHIR99021) can activate the canonical Wnt
  pathway. DKK1 inhibits β‐catenin‐dependent Wnt signaling pathway by binding to the
  LRP5/6 receptor. Competitive binding of DKK1, facilitates WNT binding to Frizzled
  and activates the non‐canonical Wnt pathway through Ror/Ryk receptor complex. This
  activates RhoA‐ROCK and JNK pathway. They regulate the cytoskeleton remodelling
  and planar cell polarity, respectively (Corda & Sala, 2017). DKK, Dickkopf‐1; RSPO1,

    In the canonical Wnt pathway; binding of WNT ligand to Frizzled and LRP5/6 receptors
