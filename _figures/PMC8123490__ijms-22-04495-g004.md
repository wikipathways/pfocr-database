caption: Current therapeutic targets for pharmacological treatment of NAFLD and NASH.
  There are no FDA-approved medications for patients with NAFLD/NASH so far. Currently,
  various pharmacological therapeutic candidates are being applied to the clinical
  trials. The illustration demonstrates the targeted pathway and phenotype for treatment
  of patients with NAFLD and NASH.
