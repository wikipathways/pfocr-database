caption: Regulation of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) through regulation of
  myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1). (A) Active MLCP dephosphorylates the
  light chain of myosin (MLC20) at the Ser19 residue and induces smooth muscle relaxation.
  (B) Signaling pathway mediated by RhoA kinase (ROCK). Several agonists activate
  the RhoA–ROCK pathway. RhoA activation is dependent on GTP and can induce ROCK activity.
  ROCK phosphorylates the MYPT1 subunit of MLCP to inhibit its activity and maintain
  smooth muscle contraction. (C) Signaling mediated by integrin-linked kinase (ILK).
  ILK phosphorylates MYPT1 at Thr696, inhibiting its phosphatase activity or activating
  the endogenous PP1c inhibitors CPI-17 and phosphatase holoenzyme inhibitor (PHI-1)
  by phosphorylation. (D) Signaling mediated by Zipper-interacting protein kinase
  (ZIPK). ZIPK phosphorylates MYPT1 at Thr696 to inactivate MLCP. (E) Signaling mediated
  by p21-activated kinase (PAK-1). (F–H) Activation pathway of MYPT1 mediated by protein
  kinases. (F) Protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the activation of CPI-17, PHI-1
  and arachidonic acid and dissociation of the PP1c–MYPT1 complex, which directly
  inactivates MLCP and results in sustained contraction. (G,H) Activation of cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase A (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) is responsible
  for phosphorylation of MYPT1 at various serine residues and one threonine residue.
  (I) Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit MYPT1 at Thr850 and PKC/arachidonic
  acid induce dissociation of the PP1c-MYPT1 complex. (J) After dissociation of the
  complex, PP1c binds to another of its regulatory subunits, such as glycogen-targeting
  subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (GM) or myosin-binding subunit 85 kDa (MBS85).
  GM also competes with MYPT1 for binding with the PP1c catalytic subunit. PKA is
  involved in dissociation of the PP1c–GM complex. (K) Transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) dephosphorylates
  MYPT1 at Thr853. The black and blue arrows show the pathways in airway smooth muscle
  and in tissues other than airway smooth muscle, respectively. The blue dotted lines
  indicate the known pathways leading to dissociation of the PP1c–MYPT1 and PP1c–GM
  complexes.
