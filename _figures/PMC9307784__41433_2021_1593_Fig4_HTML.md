caption: The IGF-1R is overexpressed on OFs in the acute and chronic phase. In the
  acute phase, activation of the IGF-1R/TSHR pathway leads to proliferation of inflammatory
  cytokines, production of hyaluronan and other extracellular matrix proteins and
  differentiation into adipocytes or myofibroblasts, resulting in tissue expansion.
  In the chronic phase, the overexpression of IGF-1R on OFs persists and maintains
  tissue expansion. RANTES regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and
  secreted, also known as CCL5, HA hyaluronic acid, GAGs Glycosaminoglycans.
