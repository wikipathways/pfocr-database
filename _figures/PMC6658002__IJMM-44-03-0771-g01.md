caption: TNFR1-mediated signaling pathways. After the binding of TNF to its receptor,
  TNFR1 undergoes a conformational change and recruits multiple proteins to form complex
  I, consisting of TRADD, TRAF2/5, RIP1 and cIAP1/2. The K63-linked ubiquitination
  of RIP1 by cIAP1/2 promotes the formation and activation of the TAK1/TAB complex
  and the IKKα/IKKβ/NEMO complex, which induced the NF-κB pathway and cell survival.
  Destabilization of complex I results in the formation of complex IIa, that contains
  TRADD, FADD and caspase-8. When cIAPs are blocked and RIP1 deubiquitylated by CYLD,
  complex IIb is formed. This consists of RIP1, RIP3, FADD, caspase-8 and FLIPL. Both
  IIa and IIb can initiate apoptosis. When caspase-8 is inhibited by chemical caspase
  inhibitors, RIP1 binds to RIP3, resulting in the formation of RIP1/RIP3 by intramolecular
  auto- and trans-phosphorylation. Then, RIP3 recruits and phosphorylates MLKL to
  form complex IIc, conventionally referred to as the necrosome. The phosphorylated
  MLKL then translocates from the cytosol to the plasma and intracellular membranes.
  The oligomerization of MLKL results in membrane pore formation, causing membrane
  rupture and eventually necroptosis. TNFR1, TNF receptor 1; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  TRADD, TNF-receptor-associated death domain; TRAF, TNF-receptor-associated factor;
  RIP, receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  1; TAK1, transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1; TAB, TAK1-binding protein;
  IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; FADD, Fas-associated
  protein with death domain; CYLD, CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase; FLIPL, FLICE-like
  inhibitory protein long form; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain like protein.
