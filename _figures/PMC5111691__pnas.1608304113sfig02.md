caption: DHODH is an enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis. (A) Pathway of de novo pyrimidine
  biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. Enzyme names, classification (according to the Nomenclature
  Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/),
  and predicted A. fumigatus genes (from KEGG; www.genome.jp/kegg/ and EnsemblFungi;
  www.fungi.ensembl.org/index.html/) are listed next to each step of the pathway.
  (B) Reaction catalyzed by DHODH. In mammals and many fungi, DHODH is located at
  the mitochondria, where a transmembrane domain anchors the enzyme to the outside
  of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the intermembrane space, DHODH catalyzes
  the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. FMN and ubiquinone from the mitochondrial
  membrane (coenzyme Q) act as electron acceptors in the reaction.
