caption: Regulation of GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β is constitutively active in most tissues
  and most commonly regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation on Ser9. The most relevant
  extracellular signaling pathways known to negatively regulate GSK-3β activity are
  those of insulin/insulin-like growth factor I and Wnt. In the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway, Wnt stabilizes levels of β-catenin. Subsequently, stabilized β-catenin
  initiates the transcription of target genes. GSK-3β phosphorylates several components
  of this transduction pathway, β-catenin being the most widely characterized. Phosphorylated
  β-catenin is recognized by ubiquitin and targeted for proteasomal degradation ().
  In addition, Akt phosphorylate Ser9 of GSK-3β in the context of insulin signaling
  pathway (). Consequently, signals that modify GSK-3β activity are expected to alter
  β-catenin levels ().
