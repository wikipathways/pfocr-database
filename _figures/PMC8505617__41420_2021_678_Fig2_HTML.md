caption: After receiving the upstream signals, the core kinase combination, including
  LATS1, LATS2, MST1, MST2, SAV1, and MOB1, are activated and cooperate to phosphorylate
  YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ underdo retention by 14-3-3 proteins or proteasomal
  degradation. When dephosphorylation of YAP and TAZ occurs, they translocate to the
  nucleus and interact with TEADs and SMADs to promote downstream gene transcription.
