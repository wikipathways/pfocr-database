caption: 'Activation of lymphoid cells through metabolic modifications. Naive T cells
  have a quiescent metabolism that depends on oxidative phosphorylation. Repression
  of the mTOR pathway by the Tsc1 gene inhibits glycolytic activity but supports ATP
  synthesis through oxidation of fatty acids (FAs) and glutamine in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. Presentation of antigens to T cells, by the MHC of the antigen-presenting
  cell (APC), engages T cell receptor (TCR) signaling associated with CD28–CD80 costimulatory
  receptors and cytokine secretion. The succession of these 3 activation signals determines
  the differentiation and metabolic profiles of T lymphocytes. Proinflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., IFN-γ, IL6, IL12) induce glycolytic genes (GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, LDHA) through
  upregulation of the PI3K–Akt–mTOR, MYC and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)
  signaling pathways. The glycolytic switch produces ATP by converting pyruvate to
  lactate and supports the biosynthesis of nucleotides through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and lipids through the fatty acid synthesis (FAS). At the same time,
  anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL4, TGF-β) promote the establishment of an oxidative
  metabolism. Differentiated Tregs through FOXP3–AMPK–PPAR signaling upregulate the
  lipid transporter CD36 to oxidize lipids and thus support mitochondrial functions.
