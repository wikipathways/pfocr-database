caption: NOTCH signaling and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The effects of NOTCH
  signaling during GvHD are dependent on NOTCH1/2 receptors in T cells and Dll1/4
  ligands in the recipient, with dominant roles for NOTCH1 and Dll4. Inhibition of
  canonical NOTCH signaling by γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-inhibitor, anti Dll1–4
  antibodies, bepridil, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) markedly decreased GVHD (–).
  Tregs inhibit the NOTCH/NOTCH ligand interactions. They act through the CD39/adenosine
  axis to inhibit the NOTCH pathway which, in turn, regulates T cell proliferation
  and consequently inhibits GvHD. Blocking CD39/adenosine axis reverts NOTCH inhibition
  and favors GvHD onset ().
