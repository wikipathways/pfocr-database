caption: 'Bioenergetic regulation of cellular physiology and gene expression. Dietary
  calories enter the cell as reducing equivalents. Carbohydrates are processed through
  glycolysis to generate cytosolic pyruvate and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine
  nucleotide). The pyruvate then enters the mitochondrion, is processed through pyruvate
  dehydrogenase, and is converted to acetyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH. Fatty acids and ketone
  bodies enter the mitochondrion directly, where they generate acetyl-CoA and mitochondrial
  NADH. NADH can be oxidized within the mitochondrion by the electron transport chain
  to generate an inner-membrane electrochemical gradient (ΔP = Δψ + ΔµH+). This ΔP
  can then be used to generate ATP by the ATP synthase. The ATP is exported to the
  cytosol by the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) to energize work. Excess mitochondrial
  reducing equivalents can be transferred to O2 to generate superoxide anion (O2·−).
  O2·− is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by manganese superoxide dismutase
  (MnSOD). H2O2 can diffuse out of the mitochondrion into the cytosol and nucleus.
  Further reduction of H2O2 results in hydroxyl radical (·OH). The mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mtPTP) senses mitochondrial energy decline, reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production, altered oxidation-reduction (redox) state, and increased Ca2+.
  When activated, it opens a channel in the inner membrane, collapses ΔP, and induces
  apoptosis. Carbohydrate calories, in the form of glucose, are monitored by the pancreatic
  islet cells. High serum glucose elicits the secretion of insulin, which binds to
  the insulin receptors of target cells. This activates the phosphatidylinositol 3
  kinase (PI3K) pathway to activate Akt protein kinase B (PKB). Akt phosphorylates
  the forkhead box, subgroup O (FOXO) transcription factors, barring them from the
  nucleus and their binding to insulin response elements (IREs). IREs are upstream
  of the mitochondrial transcription factor coactivator, peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). In the absence of FOXO binding to IRE,
  PGC-1α transcription is reduced and mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) decline, shifting metabolism toward glycolysis. When carbohydrates are
  limiting, serum glucose declines; insulin secretion diminishes; and the FOXOs become
  dephosphorylated and enter the nucleus, where they induce PGC-1α, upregulating mitochondrial
  biogenesis and OXPHOS. Furthermore, low glucose activates the pancreatic alpha cells
  to secrete glucagon. Glucagon binds to glucocorticoid receptors (GR) on target cells,
  activating adenylate cyclase (AC). cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate
  cAMP response element binding (CREB), and phospho-CREB enters the nucleus, where
  it binds to cAMP response elements (CREs). One CRE is upstream of PGC-1α, resulting
  in its increased expression and the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial
  energetics (ATP and acetyl-CoA), redox status, and ROS also regulate cytosolic signal
  transduction pathways and the epigenome. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA generated from
  pyruvate or fatty acids and ketones is converted to citrate. The citrate either
  drives the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to generate ATP or is exported to the
  cytosol and cleaved back to acetyl-CoA. Elevated cytosolic ATP and acetyl-CoA produced
  when calories are abundant can stimulate the phosphorylation and acetylation of
  histones, opening chromatin and stimulating transcription, growth, and cell replication.
  Diminished calories have the opposite effect. High acetyl-CoA also drives the acetylation
  and inactivation of the FOXOs and PGC-1α, shifting cellular metabolism away from
  OXPHOS and toward glycolysis. Glycolysis also causes the reduction of NAD+ to NADH,
  but oxidation of fatty acids and ketones reduces mitochondrial NAD+ to NADH but
  not cytosolic NAD+. The cytosolic and nuclear protein deacetylase, Sirt1, requires
  NAD+ as a coreactant and cannot use NADH. Therefore, during active glycolysis Sirt1
  is inhibited, the FOXOs and PGC-1α remain acetylated, and the cell is biased toward
  glycolysis. However, during fatty acid and ketone oxidation, cytosolic NAD+ remains
  oxidized, the Sirt1 deacetylates the FOXOs and PGC-1α, and OXPHOS is induced. Mitochondrial
  H2O2 is also an important agent in signal transduction, activating an array of kinases
  and other signaling molecules. However, excessive H2O2 production can damage cells
  and can act as a mutagen, potentially activating nuclear DNA (nDNA) oncogenes or
  inactivating tumor-suppressor genes. Abbreviations: AMPK, AMP-activated protein
