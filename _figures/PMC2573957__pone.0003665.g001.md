caption: TLRs recognize molecular patterns associated with a broad range of pathogens
  including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Vaccine components in WCV vaccine
  that may be recognized by TLR4 include LPS and PT. Following TLR4 activation, both
  the MyD88 and TICAM1 routes, leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  and type I IFNs respectively, may be activated. These promote the development of
  helper T cell responses providing T-cell help to B cells. TLR signaling in B cells
  may further promote the generation of antibody responses and the maintenance of
  serologic memory. TNFRSF4 is expressed on activated T cells. Adapted from BioCarta
