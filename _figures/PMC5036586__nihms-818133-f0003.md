caption: 'NAD+ metabolism produces Nam, which is inhibitory to the activity of Sir2
  family proteins as NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. Also the Sir2 family, Hst1,
  can repress de novo NAD+synthesis by silencing the expression of BNA genes. TORC1/Sch9/PKA/Pho85
  may inhibit NA/NAM salvage via regulating Pnc1. Reduced SPS pathway activity increases
  PHO pathway activity and also increases PHO8 expression independent of PHO pathway,
  both leading to increased NR salvage activity. Thus active SPS pathway likely represses
  PHO activity. Low levels of phosphate activates PHO pathway, leading to concomitant
  increases in NR salvage activity via phosphatases, Pho8 and Pho5 (not shown), and
  nucleotidases Sdt1 and Isn1 (not shown). Whereas active Pho85 may activate or inhibit
  NR salvage activity. When phosphate is plentiful (and PHO pathway is suppressed),
  PKA helps degrade Pho84 phosphate transporter. When PHO84 is deleted, PHO pathway
  is activated and NR salvage activity increases. TORC1: target of rapamycin complex
