caption: 'Intracellular pathways targeted by disease pathogenesis in FTLD. The most
  common genetic mutation in FTLD is caused by (GGGGCC)n hexanucleotide repeat expansion
  in the C9orf72 gene. C9orf72 mutations are known to generate RNA foci, which reside
  primarily in the nucleus. In addition, C9orf72 mutations use RAN-mediated translation
  to generate DPRs that disrupt the nuclear pore complex and interfere with liquid
  droplet formation. Finally, the protein product of C9orf72 has been detected in
  complex with WDR41 and SMCR8 as regulating the initiation of autophagy and the formation
  of autophagosomes. Several other FTLD genes, including SQSTM1, UBQLN2, OPTN, and
  VCP, have also been implicated in autophagy and the formation of autophagosomes.
  GRN, another major FTLD gene, encodes progranulin, a glycoprotein that can be either
  secreted and endocytosed or directly transported to the endolysosomal pathway where
  it regulates the formation, turnover, and possibly the exophagy of lysosomes. Abbreviations:
  DPR, dipeptide repeat; FTLD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration; MVB, multivesicular
  body; RAN, repeat-associated non-ATG.'
