caption: Disordered metabolic pathway networks in sepsis and the interventional effects
  of biapenem (BIPM) in combination with xuebijing injection (XBJ). The red dots represent
  increased metabolites in septic rats, the blue dots represent decreased metabolites
  in septic rats, and the gray dots represent undetected metabolites. The disturbed
  metabolic pathways in septic rats are marked in red (up-regulated) and blue (down-regulated).
  The metabolites regulated by the combination of XBJ and BIPM are marked with up
  and down arrows.
