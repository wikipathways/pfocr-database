  (S7P), erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate
  (PRPP) from pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP), Acetyl-Coa (AcCoA) from citric acid
  cycle (TCA), chorismate (CHOR), 3-dehydroquinate (3DHQ), 3-dehydroshikimate (3DHS),
  shikimate (SHIK) and chorismate (CHOR) from chorismate biosynthesis pathway (CHOR)
  as well as anthranilate (ANTH), N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)anthranilate (PRAN), 1-(2-Carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose
  5-phosphate (CDRP), 3-Indolyl-glycerol 3-phosphate (IGP), indole (IND) and L-tryptophan
