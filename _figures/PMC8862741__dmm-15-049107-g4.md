caption: Treating RASopathies. Researchers have developed several classes of drugs
  that target RAS activation and components of the MAPK or the PI3K/AKT pathway. Drugs
  that inhibit RAS activation include those that target RAS directly (e.g. sotorasib),
  inhibit RAS membrane localization (e.g. tipifarnib), prevent the activity of SHP2
  (e.g. RMC-4550), inhibit the interaction of RAS with its exchange factor SOS1 (e.g.
  BI 1701963), or block the kinase activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. dasatinib).
  Please see the text for more details. Blue font indicates preclinical tool compounds;
  black font indicates a drug in clinical development. Several have been FDA approved
  for the treatment of cancer, including sotorasib, trametinib and copanlisib, among
  others, and could potentially be used for the treatment of RASopathies. TTM, tetrathiomolybate.
