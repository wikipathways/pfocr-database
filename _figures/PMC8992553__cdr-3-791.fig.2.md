caption: 'TRAIL-induced apoptotic pathways. After trimerization, TRAIL binds to death
  receptors, which triggers the formation of the DISC and activates caspase-8/10.
  Subsequently, activated caspase-8/10 induces cleavage of caspase-3/7, which leads
  to apoptosis. On the other hand, cleaved caspase-8/10 can also recruit Bid to trigger
  apoptosis via the intrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway is usually activated
  by DNA damage followed by p53 activation, whereas TRAIL-induced intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway is independent of p53. Interestingly, p53 has also been found to regulate
  TRAIL receptors DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2[-]. Anti-apoptotic proteins, including
  c-FLIP, c-IAP1/2, Bcl-2, Bfl-1, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, XIAP, and survivin, are shown in
  blue circles. DISC: death-inducing signalling complex; DR4: death receptor 4; DR4:
