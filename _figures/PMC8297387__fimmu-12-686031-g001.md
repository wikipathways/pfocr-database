caption: 'Schematic overview of a BsAb in cancer: mechanisms of action and potential
  targets. Dual checkpoints blockade is achieved by two-checkpoint blockers integrated
  into one antibody to inhibit two immune checkpoints simultaneously. Tumor targeted
  immunomodulators are designed for binding to one tumor-associated antigen (TAA)
  to inhibit TAA signaling pathway and the other immunomodulating receptor (e.g.,
  PD-L1, CD47), thus regulating the immune system to attack the tumors. ADCC, antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity; bsAb, bispecific antibody; NK, natural killer; SIRPα,
  signal-regulatory protein α.'
