caption: Several enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids.
  Glutamate can serve as a precursor for the biosynthesis of alanine, aspartate, glutamine,
  proline, and serine. The enzymes glutaminase (GLS/GLS2), proline dehydrogenase 1
  (PRODH), P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH or ALDH4A1), and branched chain amino acid transaminase
  (BCAT1/2) are involved in glutamate biosynthesis, whereas glutamate dehydrogenas
  (GLUD1/2) is involved in its metabolism. The enzymes alanine aminotransaminase (ALT1/2
  or GPT/2), aspartate aminotransferase (AST1/2 or GOT1/2), and glutamine synthetase
  (GS or GLUL) convert glutamate to alanine, aspartate, and glutamine, respectively.
  Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS/ALDH18A1) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase
  1 (PYCR1) are used for proline biosynthesis from glutamate, whereas serine biosynthesis
  involves the transamination of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate to 3-phosphoserine (3-PS)
  by phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) with glutamate as the amino donor and
  phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) to convert 3-PS to serine. Asparatate is a precursor
  of asparagine and arginine. The enzyme asparagine synthetase (ASNS), argininosuccinate
  synthase 1 (ASS1), and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) are required for converting
  aspartate to asparagine and arginine, respectively. Serine is a precursor of glycine
  and cysteine, where serine is converted to glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT1/2). Cysteine is synthesized through a process called the reverse transsulfuration
  pathway involving cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH).
  Tyrosine biosynthesis not linked to glutamate, but rather the enzyme phenylalanine
  hydroxylases (PAH) converts phenylalanine to tyrosine.
