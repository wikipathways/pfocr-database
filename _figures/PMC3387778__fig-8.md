caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the deduced pathway through which PRX2 interacts
  with the Trx-ASK1 signaling complex. Left panel: after ischemic insult, PRX2 is
  oxidized when scavenging free radicals, which results in a reduction in its antioxidative
  activity. Oxidized PRX can regain its activity at the expense of reduced Trx, yielding
  oxidized Trx. The reduced Trx normally binds to and inhibits ASK1; however, oxidation
  of Trx sets free ASK1, leading to the activation of subsequent apoptotic cascades.
  Right panel: overexpression of PRX2 results in increases of reduced PRX2 to battle
  ischemia-induced oxidative stress. Increased amount of PRX2 at its reduced form
  inhibits the cysteine thiol–disulfide exchange between PRX2 and Trx, thus maintaining
  Trx at its reduced state that inhibits the activation of ASK1 and cell death. (To
  see this illustration in color the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article at www.liebertonline.com/ars).'
