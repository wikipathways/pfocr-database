caption: (A) Hda1C is recruited to hyperactive genes via its interaction with elongating
  RNA Pol II, RNA transcripts, and histones. This complex selectively deacetylates
  histone H4 at coding regions of hyperactive genes to negatively regulate RNA Pol
  II elongation. In contrast, Hda1C functionally and physically interacts with Tup1
  corepressor to preferentially deacetylate histone H3 and repress transcription of
  stress response genes. (B) Hda1C and the Set2-Rpd3S pathway collaborate to maintain
  optimal histone acetylation within coding regions and may function at different
  times on the same genes. Hda1C deacetylates histone H4 at actively transcribing
  genes through the interaction with elongating RNA Pol II. In contrast, Rpd3S HDAC
  may deacetylate histones via recognition of H3K36 methylation when the genes are
  not currently transcribing by RNA Pol II.
