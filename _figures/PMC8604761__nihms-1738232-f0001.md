caption: Canonically, pathogens drive inflammasome formation in macrophages to activate
  caspase-1 which subsequently cleaves GSDMD and promotes IL-1β/IL-18 maturation.
  GSDMD-N terminal domain oligomerizes and forms pores in cell membrane, leading to
  cell lysis and IL-1β/IL-18 release. However, gram-negative bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) is able to directly activate caspase-11 to cleave GSDMD and form GSDMD pores.
  Potassium efflux though GSDMD pores then triggers canonical inflammasome-induced
  pyroptotic pathway. Activated caspase-8 by TNFα signaling or Yersinia-derived YopJ-induced
  TAK1 inhibition has also been shown to cleave GSDMD to cause cell lysis, which could
  be negatively regulated by cFLIPL. GSDMD succination by fumarate prevents its cleavage
  by caspases, limiting its capacity of pyroptosis induction. Mg2+ blocks pyroptosis
  by inhibiting Ca2+ channel P2X7 which is required for GSDMD pore formation. Pyroptotic
  process could be reversed by ESCRT-III machinery-dependent plasma membrane repair.
