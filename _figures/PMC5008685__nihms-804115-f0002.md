caption: Mechanisms of initiation of translation. eIF2α-GTP complex binds to (Met)-tRNAi
  that forms a ternary complex, which associates with 40S ribosomal subunit and combines
  with eIF1, eIF1A and eIF3 resulting in the creation of pre-initiation complex 43S.
  This combines with both mRNA and heterotetramer eIF4F. Afterwards, the anticodon
  of (Met)-tRNAi pairs with the AUG codon of mRNA, which forms the 48S pre-initiation
  complex. That process requires consumption of energy, since GTP is hydrolysed to
  GDP. Subsequently, complex eIF2α-GDP and other initiator factors are released. After
  association of the 60S subunit of the ribosome with the 48S pre-initiation complex,
  the complete 80S initiation complex is created. Formation of a new ternary complex
  requires replacement of GDP to GTP by eIF2β. The process is inhibited by phosphorylation
  of eIF2α by PERK under stress conditions of the ER, which results in attenuation
  of global protein translation and triggers preferential translation of selected
  genes such as ATF4.
