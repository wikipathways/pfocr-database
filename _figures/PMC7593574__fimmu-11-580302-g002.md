caption: Dab2 modulates inflammatory pathways in macrophages and dendritic cells.
  (A) DAB2 modulates MyD88-dependent (1) and TRIF-dependent TLR signaling in macrophages
  (2), as well as their response to CSF-1 (3). (1) DAB2 direct interaction with TRAF-6
  inhibits the downstream cascade that leads to NF-κB translocation to the nucleus
  and induction of inflammatory genes. (2) DAB2 binding to clathrin inhibits TLR4
  loading into endosomes and triggering of TRIF-mediated IRF3 activation, necessary
  to induce type I interferon and RANTES. Stimulation of TLR4 by LPS triggers the
  dissociation of DAB2 from TRAF6 (1) or clathrin (2) thus promoting these signaling
  pathways. (3) Dab2 transcription is repressed by IFNγ/ICSBP during macrophage differentiation
  with CSF-1, but absence of ICSBP promotes DAB2 expression. In this context, CSF-1
  induces DAB2 phosphorylation, accumulation at the cell surface and promotion of
  adhesion and spreading, as well as inhibition of proliferation. (B) GM-CSF-induced
  differentiation of BMDCs promotes DAB2 expression in a STAT5- and PI3K/AKT-dependent
  fashion. hnRNP E1 phosphorylation by AKT enhances DAB2 protein levels, which inhibits
  expression of activation markers and inflammatory cytokines. TLR4 activation in
  DCs induces NF-κB activation via Src/PI3K/AKT pathway. Quercetin dampens this pathway
  by stimulating DAB2 expression in LPS-treated BMDCs, which inhibits the induction
  of inflammatory cytokines, likely through direct interaction between DAB2 and c-Src.
  BMDCs, bone marrow–derived dendritic cells; ISRE, IFN-stimulated response elements;
  ICSBP, interferon consensus sequence binding protein.
