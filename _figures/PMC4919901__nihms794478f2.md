caption: Antigen is presented by APCs, which promotes a Th2-response in EoE. Th2-cytokines
  are primarily produced by Th2-cells, but can be produced by ILC2, iNKT-cells, eosinophils
  and mast cells. IL-5 increases the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils
  in the bone marrow, maintains their survival and facilitates their migration into
  the blood. IL-13 stimulates eotaxin-3 production from the epithelial cells, which
  recruits circulating eosinophils to the oesophagus. Eosinophils produce Th2-cytokines
  propagating the inflammatory cycle. They release cytotoxic granules causing tissue
  injury. They activate DCs via EDN to prime Th2-cells and possibly iNKT-cells. Eosinophils
  activate mast cells via MBP. Mast cells can also be activated by antigens cross-linking
  their surface IgE. Activated mast-cells release IL-13, IL-5 and TFGβ-1. Together,
  mast cells and eosinophils cause fibrosis, remodelling and dysmotility in a TGFβ-1
  mediated pathway.
