caption: Comparison of key metabolic pathways and functions related to the aerobic
  photoheterotrophic lifestyle in Gemmatimonas groenlandica and Gemmatimonas phototrophica
  based on genome annotations. The comparison is based on the “KEGG metabolic pathway
  reconstruction” function of the RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology)
  web server (https://rast.nmpdr.org/; ). A complete set of shared and unique genes
  between these two genomes is shown in . OM, outer membrane; IM, cytoplasmic membrane;
  PRPP, phosphoribosyl diphosphate; Q, quinone pool; cyt, terminal cytochrome oxidase;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate; PP pathway, pentose
  phosphate pathway. Red arrow indicates the pathway that only occurs in Gemmatimonas
  groenlandica and green arrows are those only present in Gemmatimonas phototrophica.
  Pathways and functions drawn in black and white are predicted in both genomes. Note
  that the respiratory complex IV has two types of cytochrome c as terminal electron
  acceptor. The aa3-type has a low affinity for O2 and the cbb3-type is a high-affinity
  version.
