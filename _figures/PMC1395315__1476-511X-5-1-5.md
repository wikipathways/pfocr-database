caption: Elevated Homocysteine is associated with atherosclerosis. Elevated level
  of homocysteine affects the cholesterol biosynthesis (branch 1), expression of extracellular
  matrix proteins (branch 2), enhance endothelial LOX-1 gene expression and TNFα release
  upon oxLDL stimulation (branch 3,branch 8), affect the expression of cell adhesion
  molecule (branch 4), enhance SMC proliferation by increasing cyclin A activity (branch
  5), induce the expression of LPL both at the transcription and translation level
  presumably via PKC activation (branch 6,7) that modulates inflammatory gene response
  in endothelial cells. Elevated level of homocysteine also down regulate the expression
  of PPARs (Figure 6, branch 9). The genes marked in blue have been identified by
  literature based searches as mentioned in the methods section. The solid and dotted
  lines indicate direct and indirect (multi step) interaction/ conversion respectively.
