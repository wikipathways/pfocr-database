caption: 'Carbohydrate metabolic pathway components differentially expressed in response
  to increasing oxidative stress. Enzymes found to be differentially expressed in
  the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (blue), pentose phosphate (red), fermentation (yellow),
  and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (green) pathways are plotted based on their associations
  found in the KEGG database. Larger fonts correspond to compounds in the pathways
  while smaller, italicized fonts represent enzymes. The 2 × 3 heatmaps represent
  each isolate and fold change in expression observed relative to the control for
  each H2O2 treatment. Red and blue colors represent significantly higher and lower
  expression, respectively; white color represents no significant change in expression;
  and gray color represents treatments not measured in this experiment. Abbreviations:
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6 P, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  Gly3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Gly1,3PP, glyceraldehyde-1,3-bisphosphate; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; 6PGLac, 6-phosphogluconolactone; 6PGlu, 6-phosphogluconate;
  Ribu5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; Rib5P, ribose-5-phosphate.'
