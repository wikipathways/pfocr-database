caption: 'During innate immune activation via LPS-LPB-TLR4, a number of factors of
  the coagulation pathway are activated, creating the cooperative immuno-coagulative
  response. Extrinsic pathway activation of protease thrombin through FVIIa and tissue
  factor (TF) in sepsis help activate its EC membrane PAR-1 receptor. Reorganization
  of the endothelial cell (EC) cytoskeleton and cell adhesive complexes provides a
  structural basis for an increased vascular permeability implicated in the pathogenesis
  of sepsis. Thrombin through G-proteins (G 12/13 and G alpha 11/q) induces a rapid
  increase of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) kinase which results in actin-myosin
  interaction, stress fiber formation. Actin-myosin interaction leads to an increased
  EC permeability.MLCK inhibitors significantly attenuate the effects of thrombin
  on EC permeability and actin stress-fiber formation. As thrombin disrupts intercellular
  junctions, it creates formation of stress fibers and paracellular gaps by inhibition
  of Rho GTP-ase.Activated protein C (APC) is augmented with presence of EPCR that
  is present on ECs. Activation of PC by thrombin and thrombomodulin is restrained
  in sepsis. PAR-1 can be switched by APC, in presence of its receptor EPCR, or by
  thrombin from permeability protective to permeability enhancing.LPS: Lipopolysaccharide;
