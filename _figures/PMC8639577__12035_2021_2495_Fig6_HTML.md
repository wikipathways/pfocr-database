caption: 'PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in macrophages. PD-1-expressing macrophages exhibit
  an anti-inflammatory-like surface profile in tumor settings. PD-1 expression is
  negatively correlated to phagocytic ability of macrophages and blockade of PD-1/PD-L1
  enhanced anti-tumor responses, prolonged survival through inhibiting proinflammatory
  to anti-inflammatory macrophages polarization. PD-L1 antibody treatment promotes
  cell proliferation of cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages, which is related
  to the activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway. Transcriptomic profiles of macrophages
  have been switched into inflammatory phenotypes following PD-L1 antibody treatment.
