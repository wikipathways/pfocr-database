caption: Innate immune activation on hemodialysis membrane surfaces. Hemodialysis
  filters can adsorb several complement components. The adhesion of circulating IgG
  can induce the classical pathway activation by the binding of C1q. The adsorption
  of Ficolin-2 to the dialyzer can lead to the lectin pathway by the binding of circulating
  mannose binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs). Furthermore, properdin,
  C3b, albumin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or other bacterial components in dialysis
  solutions or hemodialysis patient bloodstream can promote the alternative route
  activation after the stabilization mediated by circulating factor B. The adsorption
  by polysulfone membranes of regulatory components as factor H, a crucial inhibitor
  of C3 convertase and C3b, and clusterin, able to prevent terminal pathway activation,
  significantly enhances the alternative pathway activation. Complement activation
  will result in a higher serum increase of anaphylotoxins C3a and C5a, augmented
  levels of soluble C5b-9, and the induction of coagulation. IL, interleukin, TNF;
  Tumor Necrosis Factor. Complement effectors directly boost coagulation. For example,
  C3a anaphylatoxin activates platelets, enhancing their aggregation and adhesion,
  and C5a increases blood thrombogenicity, mainly through the upregulation of TF and
  PAI-1 expression on neutrophils and monocytes. From the other side, the coagulation
  component thrombin cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b, and C5 to C5a and C5b, thus amplifying
  the activation of complement. The interplay between complement and coagulation system
  has been mainly involved in cardiovascular complication (short-term) and inflammaging
  and senescence processes (in the long-term). In addition, the complement system
  results in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes on dialyzer
  membranes, leading to a transient leukopenia. The further dysfunctional activation
  will lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and will promote the impairment
  in the Th1/Th2 ratio, and thus the alterations in the subsequent T-mediated adaptive
  response.
