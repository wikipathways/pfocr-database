caption: Brain regions that receive SP projections and contain NK1Rs to varying degrees
  are shown. SP and NK1Rs have been shown to regulate the activity of brainstem and
  midbrain monoamine nuclei (NE neurons of LC, DA neurons of VTA, 5-HT neurons of
  DR), which have widespread projections to forebrain regions; some of these, relevant
  for addiction-related behaviors, are included in the current schematic. Some 5-HT
  neurons of the DR co-express SP, but target regions of this subset are not established;
  the projections that contain 5-HT potentially co-localized with SP are shown in
  gray. The amygdala (AMG) and hypothalamus (HYP), which regulate behavioral, autonomic
  and endocrine stress responses contain intrinsic SP circuits that modulate their
  output. The pathway from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the nucleus accumbens (NAC;
  core subregion) to the ventral pallidum (VP) is part of a proposed “final common
  pathway” for reinstatement of drug seeking (see main text). Medium spiny neurons
  (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) that project to the ventral pallidum (VP)
  and substantia nigra (SN) contain SP and activate NK1R and/or NK3R in these regions.
  These SP containing GABAergic projections are shown in red. Not shown is the habenula,
  an NK1R containing structure recently postulated to mediate important anti-reward
  processes; a role of SP and NK1R in these has not yet been evaluated.
