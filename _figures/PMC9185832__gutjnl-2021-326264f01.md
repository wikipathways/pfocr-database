caption: Mechanisms of microbiota modulation on chemotherapy response. (A) Irinotecan
  (CPT-11) is converted to SN-38 to elicit its cytotoxic effect after injection into
  the body. SN-38 is then detoxified by UGT in the liver to become SN-38G and excreted
  into the GI tract. The gut bacteria can reactivate and convert SN-38G back to SN-38,
  causing toxicity to intestinal cells. (B) Bacterial ribonucleotide metabolism activates
  fluoropyrimidine prodrugs into activated forms for cytotoxic effects. Vitamin B6
  and B9 production is required for the metabolism. (C) Intratumoral Gammaproteobacteria
  with long isoform of cytidine deaminase can inactivate gemcitabine, leading to chemoresistance.
  (D) CTX increases intestinal permeability to promote Enterococcus hirae translocation
  into the spleen to increase pathogenic Th17 cells and intratumoral CD8+/CD4+ T cells
  ratio. (E) Gut microbes can prime tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells via MYD88-dependent
  pathway for ROS production in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. (F) Antigenicity
  from oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis of epithelial cells together with immunogenic
  bacteria, including non-enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis and Erysipelotrichaceae,
  can stimulate the differentiation of migratory DCs to TFH cells for B cell activation.
  (G) Microbial metabolites such as butyrate can activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to
  enhance the efficacy of oxaliplatin. (H) Fusobacterium nucleatum can activate TLR4/MYD88-dependent
  pathway to inhibit certain miRNAs and switch tumour cells from apoptosis to autophagy,
  leading to chemoresistance. Figure created with BioRender.com. CPT-11, irinotecan;
