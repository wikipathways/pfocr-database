caption: Diagram showing the updated pattern of cellular signal transduction of ET
  and ABA with emphasis on the involvement of MAPs kinase in Arabidopsis thaliana.
  (a) Signal transduction of ET. ET perception by its receptors acts to inhibit CTR1,
  a Raf-like MAP3K. There exist two signaling pathways downstream of CTR1, i.e., the
  EIN2 pathway, which acts to control the nuclear accumulation of the EIN3/EIL protein,
  the core TFs controlling the expression of ET-responsive genes; another is the MAPK
  signaling pathway, where the MKK7/9-MPK3/6 module acts to link CTR1 with EIN3/EIL.
  In addition, MPK3/6 act to stabilize ACS via phosphorylation, thereby regulating
  ET biosynthesis. Noteworthily, MPK3/6 can be also activated by a variety of biotic/abiotic
  signals. Consequently, the MAPK signaling pathway functions in both mediating ET
  signal transduction and biotic/abiotic signals modulate ET production. (b) Signal
  transduction of ABA. ABA perception by its receptors acts to inhibit PP2C, clade-A
  type-2C protein phosphatases. Besides directly targeting SnRK2s, PP2C may also directly
  target several MAPs kinases, such as MAP3K17/18. In addition, a large number of
  MAPs kinases, such as MKK1/3/4/5 and MPK1/2/3/6/7/9/12/14, were reported to be involved
  in ABA signaling, ultimately regulating a variety of biological processes, such
  as stomatal movement, seed germination, root growth and abiotic/biotic responses
