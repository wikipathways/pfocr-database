caption: Metabolic modeling was used to predict P450 catalyzed N-dealkylation of (A)
  terbinafine for all pathways (B) N-desmethyl-terbinafine for Pathway 2 secondary
  reactions, and (3) N-methyl-6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-yn-1-amine for Pathway 3 secondary
  reactions. Predictions for metabolism at specific atomic locations were scored for
  increasing oxidation likelihood ranging from 0 – 1.0 (blue to red).
