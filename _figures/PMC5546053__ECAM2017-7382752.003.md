caption: Different metabolic pathways were strongest affected by QD or YD in CRC serum
  samples. (a) Venn diagram showing overlap among metabolites differentially expressed
  in serum samples of CRC patients with QD, YD, or ND. (b, c, and d) Schematic representation
  of galactose metabolism (b), tRNA synthesis (c), and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism
  (d) pathway. In red, the metabolites that differentially expressed in serum samples
  of CRC patients with QD, YD, or ND.
