caption: 'Reconstruction of some hormone signaling pathways and MAPK signaling pathways
  in D. huoshanense through joint analysis of structural genes and metabolites under
  stress conditions. The coding genes indicated by gene symbols are described as follows:
  ABA, abscisic acid; PYL, pyrabactin resistance 1-like; PP2C, protein phosphatase
  2C; SnRK2, serine/threonine protein kinase 2; ABF, ABA-responsive element binding
  factor; MAPKK17/18, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 17/18; MKK3, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 3; MPK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2; SA, salicylic
  acid; NPR1, non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1; TGA, basic leucine zipper
  transcription factor; JA, jasmonic acid; JA-Ile, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine; COI1, coronatine-insensitive
  protein 1; JAZ, jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein; MPK6, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 6; MYC2, myelocytomatosis protein 2; ET, ethylene; ETR, ethylene
  receptor; CTR1, constitutive triple response 1; SIMKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 4/5; EIN2, ethylene-insensitive protein 2; MKK9, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase 9; EIN3, ethylene-insensitive protein 3; and ERF1/2, ethylene-responsive
  transcription factor 1/2'
