caption: Mutational status of single-cell colonies derived from CD34+ 38−BM progenitor
  cells in 7 ECD patients. Mutational status of single-cell colonies derived from
  CD34+38− progenitor cells of 3 ECD patients (#A, B/13, and C) harboring both MAPK
  pathway and additional myeloid mutations, and of 5 ECD patients (#D/7, E, F/4, G/16,
  and H) harboring myeloid mutations. Of note, a larger number of colonies were sequenced
  for the MAPK pathway mutations and only the colonies sequenced for both MAPK pathway
  mutations and additional myeloid mutations are depicted. Patients who had hematological
  neoplasms are indicated by “/X”, the X number referring to the number on . The full
  details of the mutation list, and correspondence between BM and tissue mutations,
  are shown in supplemental Table 7.
