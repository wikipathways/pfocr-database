caption: Proposed mechanistic model of FA-97 ameliorates DSS-induced colitis against
  oxidative stress by activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Our findings demonstrated a scenario
  where FA-97 activates Nrf2 and promotes its nuclear translocation, on one hand increasing
  the expression of its downstream target proteins HO-1 and NQO-1, to reduce the ROS
  level and enhance the oxidant resistance, on the other hand inhibiting the NF-κB
  and AP-1 signaling to suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
  IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12), and eventually meliorates inflammatory bowel disease.
