caption: Mitochondrial damage leads to loss of ATP generation and elevation in oxidative
  stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory signalling
  via the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern.
  This can be mitigated through clearance and recycling of these damaged mitochondria
  through mitophagy. PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy is the most well studied pathway
  and inducers of PINK1/Parkin, or inhibitors of USP30, may promoted this process.
  Alternative mitophagy pathways exist (e.g. BNIP3L/Nix, FUNDC1, iron-chelation) that
  may function to remove damaged mitochondria including under conditions where PINK1
  or Parkin are compromised. Modulating mitophagy thorough one or more of these pathways
  is emerging as an potential therapeutic strategy in Parkinson's disease. Novel strategies
  to bypass these mitophagy pathways entirely are now being explored. AUTACs (Autophagy-targeting
  chimera) are heterobifunctional compounds consisting of a targeting ligand (that
  binds to a protein or organelle that is to be degraded) and a degradation tag [guanine
  derivative] that recruits the autophagy machinery. These bifunctional moieties are
  connected to each other through a flexible ‘linker’, and have been employed in experimental
  systems to trigger Parkin-independent mitophagy.
