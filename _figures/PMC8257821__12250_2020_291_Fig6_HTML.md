caption: The schematic diagram of PTEN signaling pathway involved in lipogenesis.
  PTEN lipid phosphatase activity negatively regulates PI3K/Akt signaling. Akt inhibits
  FoxO1 and activates mTORC1. Maf1, activated by FoxO1 and inhibited by mTORC1, downregulates
  lipogenic enzymes including FASN and ACC. FoxO1 and mTORC1 can also regulate SREBP
  expression and induce the expression of lipogenic enzymes. The regulation of PTEN
  signaling pathway during DENV infection was showed in red lines.
