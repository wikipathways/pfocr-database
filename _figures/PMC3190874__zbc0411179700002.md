caption: The FcϵRI signaling pathway is negatively regulated by a number of cell surface
  and intracellular proteins that act at various points in the FcϵRI signaling network.
  Proximal intracellular FcϵRI signaling and adaptor proteins are negatively regulated
  by Csk, protein-tyrosine phosphatase ϵ (PTPϵ), SHP-1, and SHP-2. PI3K signaling
  is negatively regulated by SHIP, PTEN, LAX, and RGS13. Ras signaling is negatively
  regulated by RasGAP. Cell surface proteins that negatively regulate FcϵRI signaling
  include TRPM4, which reduces calcium signaling, and TLR4, which, upon formation
  of a complex with the ES62 product of filarial nematodes, inhibits SphK and PLD
  signaling by sequestering and degrading SphK- and PLD-activating PKCα. Co-cross-linking
  of the ITIM-containing cell surface receptor FcγRIIb with FcϵRI triggers the inhibition
  of FcϵRI signaling at several points, including SHIP-mediated inactivation of PI3K
  signaling and DOK1/RasGAP-mediated inactivation of Ras signaling. Co-cross-linking
  of FcϵRI with other ITIM-containing cell surface receptors triggers the inhibition
  of FcϵRI signaling mediated by SHP-1 and SHP-2. DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate.
