caption: Mechanisms of chronic active BCR signaling in lymphoid malignancies. (a)
  In the absence of its cognate antigen, proximal BCR signaling remains inactive,
  and thus the protein tyrosine kinase SYK is not recruited to the co-receptors CD79A
  and CD79B. The Src kinase LYN prevents hyperactivation of BCR signaling by initiation
  of a negative feedback loop involving CD22 phosphorylation and subsequent activation
  of the phosphatase SHP-1. Tonic BCR signaling promotes B-cell survival via the PI3K/AKT
  pathway in an antigen-independent manner; (b) Engagement of the BCR, for instance
  by self-antigens or pathogen-derived antigens, results in receptor clustering and
  the induction of an intracellular signaling cascade. The subsequent phosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues in the ITAM regions of CD79A/B by Src kinases (e.g., LYN) allows
  the recruitment of SYK which in turn phosphorylates the adapter protein BLNK and
  thus promotes the formation of a proximal signaling complex involving BTK and PLCγ2.
  While activation of the AKT signaling axis is achieved by the SYK-mediated phosphorylation
  of CD19 and subsequent recruitment of PI3K, PLCγ2 activity generates the second
  messengers DAG and IP3 the latter triggering the influx of Ca2+ into the cell. DAG
  and elevated Ca2+ levels activate PKCβ which induces activation of canonical NF-κB
  through the CBM signalosome. Whereas overexpression of SYK augments NF-κB activation
  in some lymphomas, mutations in the co-receptors CD79A/B prevent the internalization
  of activated BCRs and thus promote chronic BCR signaling. Proteins that are affected
  by recurrent genetic lesions in lymphoid malignancies are denoted with a red asterisk.
