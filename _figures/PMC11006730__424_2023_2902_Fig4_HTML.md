caption: Proposed signalling pathways of ASIC1a in different cancers. In glioblastoma
  stem cells, it appears that under certain conditions ASIC1a can induce a programmed
  cell death involving RIPK1. For breast cancer cells, it has been reported that ASIC1a
  triggers the formation of ROS and ensuing activation of AKT and NF-κB. A similar
  pathway may be active in prostate cancer cells. For pancreatic cancer, it has been
  proposed that ASIC1a triggers the activation of RhoA and the ensuing EMT. For details,
