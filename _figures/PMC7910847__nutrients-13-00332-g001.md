caption: The mechanisms of DNA methylation and demethylation processes. SAM is a methyl
  donor in the DNMT-catalyzed methylation reactions of cytosine (Cyt) to 5mC. TET
  proteins catalyze the multi-stage process of 5-methylcytosine oxidation to 5hmC,
  5fC, and 5caC. Furthermore, 5mC and 5hmC may be transformed into thymine (Thy) and
  5hmU in deamination process, respectively. These misincorporations are recognized
  and replaced with cytosine by BER pathway and glycosylases, i.e., TDG and SMUG1.
  The other products of 5mC oxidation process, 5fC and 5caC undergo BER as well. 5mC,
  5-methylcytosine; 5hmC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine; 5hmU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil; 5fC,
  5-formylcytosine; 5caC, 5-carboxylcytosine; AID, activation-induced deaminase; APOBEC,
  DNA dC->dU-editing enzyme APOBEC; BER, base excision repair pathway; Cyt, cytosine;
  DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; SAH, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine;
  SMUG1, Single-strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase; Thy, thymine;
  TET, Methylcytosine dioxygenase TET; TDG, G/T mismatch-specific thymine DNA glycosylase.
