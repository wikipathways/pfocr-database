  PI3K signaling pathway: Activated PI3K catalyzes PIP2 to generate PIP3, which acts
  as a second messenger and recruits PDK1 and AKT proteins to the plasma membrane.
  Subsequently, PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT proteins, activating downstream
  pathways. USP13 and OTUD3 can deubiquitinate PTEN, thereby increasing PTEN protein
  stability and inhibiting carcinogenic PI3K/AKT signaling. USP1 is involved in the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on AKT. TGF-β
  signaling pathway: Activated TGF-β ligand interacts with TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII, forming
  a tetrameric complex. Subsequently, TGF-βRII phosphorylates TGF-βRI. SMAD 2/3 may
  be phosphorylated by activated TGF-βRI and form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4.
  Finally, SMAD 2/3-SMAD4 complexes are transported into the nucleus and regulate
  gene expression. CYLD stabilizes TGF-βRI by removing the K63-linked polyubiquitin
  chain on Smad7 and consequently promotes TGF-β signaling. HIF-1α pathway: Under
  aerobic conditions, PDH hydroxylates HIF-1α. Next, VHL mediates HIF-1α to be rapidly
  and persistently degraded by the proteasome pathway. Under hypoxia, the activity
  of PHD and VHL is inhibited by low oxygen, leading to stabilization and activation
  of HIF-1α. UCHL1 has been reported to inhibit the VHL-mediated ubiquitination of
  HIF-1α. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; CYLD, lysine 63 deubiquitinase; TGF-β,
