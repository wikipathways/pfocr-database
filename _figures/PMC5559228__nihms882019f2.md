caption: Antigen binding and aggregation of the B cell receptor (BCR) combined with
  co-receptor ligation leads to activation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3 kinase/Akt
  protein kinase cascades, which have been shown to activate mTORC1 (mTOR/Raptor complex)
  activation through phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex
  protein 2). The TSC complex negatively regulates mTORC1 by suppressing activation
  of the Rheb GTPase, which necessary for activating mTORC1 catalytic activity. Although
  not demonstrated in B cells, amino acid sufficiency is also necessary to activate
  mTORC1 by association with active v-ATPase/Ragulator/Rag GTPase complexes on the
  surface of the lysosome (see  for details). mTOR is also negatively regulated by
  low energy (low ATP/high AMP) levels through activation of AMP kinase (AMPK). Activated
  AMPK inhibits mTORC1 activity through phosphorylation and inhibition of Raptor (a
  positive regulator of mTOR) and phosphorylation and activation of the TSC complex.
  AMPK supports the generation of ATP and nutrients through upregulation of mitochondrial
  biogenesis and autophagy, while mTORC1 suppresses autophagy and promotes cell growth
  and proliferation. The PI3K pathway also activates mTORC2 (mTOR/Rictor complex),
  which also increases mTORC1 activity through direct phosphorylation and activation
  of Akt. Wnt signaling inhibits mTORC1 by inhibiting Gsk3b, which is a positive regulator
  of the TSC complex.*Positive regulators of mTORC1 signaling are depicted in green,
  and negative regulators of mTORC1 are depicted in blue. Folliculin and Fnip1/2 have
  been described as both positive and negative regulators of mTORC1.
