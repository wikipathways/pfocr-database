caption: The figure illustrates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and its role in cancer
  progression, highlighting its influence on tumor invasion, progression, autophagy,
  and apoptosis. This pathway promotes tumor invasion by regulating factors like ZEB1,
  JUNB, TWIST-1, and MMP, and supports EMT via IL-6 and SNAIL. The JAK/STAT pathway
  also inhibits autophagy and apoptosis, contributing to tumor survival and progression.
  Key factors like p16, p21, p53, and Bcl-xl are involved in these processes
