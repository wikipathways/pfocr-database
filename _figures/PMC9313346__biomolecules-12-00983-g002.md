caption: P2 receptors and mitochondria concur to support T-cell activation. Ligation
  of both T-cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory molecule CD28 increases glycolysis
  and mitochondrial metabolism through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway and the downstream activation
  of transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and
  nuclear kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB). Upon antigen recognition,
  mitochondria are relocated to the immune synapse to sustain calcium signalling and
  supply local ATP, which is also partially released via pannexin 1 (panx-1) hemichannels.
  Extracellular ATP activates P2X1R, P2X4R and P2X7R, triggering a localized calcium
  influx that stimulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration.
  Extracellular ATP is hydrolysed to ADP, which activates specific P2Y receptors such
  as P2Y1R and P2Y12R, boosting intracellular calcium signalling and mitochondrial
  ATP synthesis. Moreover, extracellular Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
  are required for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the modulation of
  ROS-dependent transcription factors NFAT and NF-kB. APC, antigen-presenting cell;
  panx-1, pannexin-1.
