caption: Model for NES masking- and competition-mediated regulation of nuclear export.
  14–3–3 and TEAD recognition sites in the N-terminus of TAZ are in close proximity.
  Binding of TEAD blocks the function of the NES and might limit access of 14–3–3,
  thereby switching off export (left). Various regulatory inputs impeding TEAD–TAZ
  interaction are indicated by “question mark” (see Discussion); the NES remains accessible,
  leading to nuclear exit (right). The input of the Hippo pathway (on S89 phosphorylation)
  is indicated
