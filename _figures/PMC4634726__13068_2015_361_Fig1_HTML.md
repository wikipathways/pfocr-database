caption: Metabolic engineering strategy to produce FASBEs. FASBEs can be produced
  by expressing a wax ester synthase (ws2 or Maqu_0168). Isobutanol pathway enzymes
  (Ilv2, Ilv5, Ilv3, Aro10, Adh7) were overexpressed in the mitochondria to accumulate
  more isobutanol and FABEs. At the same time, production of isoamyl alcohol and active
  amyl alcohols were also increased, resulting in increased FAIEs and FAAEs production.
  To boost FASBEs production, negative regulators of INO1 (Opi1, Rpd3) were deleted.
  Genes overexpressed are shown in green. Red crosses gene deletions
