caption: The zebra finch song system showing descending (black) and ascending (gray)
  connectivity. The descending pathway begins with the HVC which projects to the motor
  nucleus RA. RA projects to respiratory nuclei in the midbrain and brain stem, the
  DM, PAm, and RAm. Signals from the respiratory brain stem innervate the respiratory
  nerves (insp/exp) and converge with RA signals to control the vocal nerves (nXII).
  The ascending pathway consists of bilateral signaling from respiratory brain stem
  onto Uva which sends a signal back onto HVC. The RA also contains a population of
  neurons that project back onto HVC (; ). This diagram is modeled after work described
  in .
