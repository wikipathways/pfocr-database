caption: Model for PKC1 in signal transduction of various stresses. Solid arrows represent
  functions in which signaling via the PKC1 pathway and its components is required.
  Dotted arrows denote functions in which PKC1 is important but pathway components
  are dispensable. Dashed arrows indicate that a specific gene and function are linked.
