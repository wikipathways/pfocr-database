caption: Mosquito innate immune pathways. (A) Toll-pathway signaling is initiated
  by Spӓtzle 5 binding to the Toll receptor, initiating the dissociation of Dif from
  Cactus. Dif translocates to the nucleus where it initiates transcription of antimicrobial
  genes; (B) Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by peptidoglycan
  recognition protein-LC results in activation and translocation of Relish to the
  nucleus, and subsequent transcription of antimicrobial genes; (C) Extracellular
  unpaired (upd) binds to the transmembrane receptor Domeless, initiating dimerization
  of Stat92E, resulting in the subsequent transcription of antimicrobial genes. (D)
  The prophenoloxidase cascade is activated by PAMP activation of the serine proteinase
  cascade. The pro-prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (PPAE) peptide becomes activated
  upon cleavage by upstream serine proteinases, resulting in the activation of phenoloxidase.
  Phenoloxidase converts phenol to quinones, and eventually melanin; (E) The piRNA
  pathway may play a compensatory role to the exo-RNAi pathway during arbovirus infection.
  Primary piRNAs are fed into the “ping-pong dependent” amplification cycle, whereby
  cleavage of cognate mRNA leads to production of secondary piRNAs. These in turn
  bind to complementary transcripts, re-starting the cycle. (F) The exo-RNAi pathway
  is initiated by cellular recognition of exogenous dsRNA. DCR2 cleavage of long dsRNA
  results in 21nt siRNA duplexes, which are loaded into the RISC. Single-stranded
  guide strand siRNAs direct RISC to viral genomic RNA by sequence complementarity,
  leading to cleavage of the virus RNA by AGO2. The DExD/H-domain of DCR2 also leads
  to induction of the secreted peptide vago, activating Jak/STAT and leading to downstream
  activation of the virus-inducible gene vir-1, restricting virus replication. (G)
  Signaling by initiator caspases to effector caspases results in programmed cell
  death. H) Recognition of PAMPs by unknown PRRs inhibits TOR-mediated negative regulation
  of phagophore formation, leading to mature autophagosomes, which fuse to lysosomes
  leading to degradation of the contents of the autophagosomes.
