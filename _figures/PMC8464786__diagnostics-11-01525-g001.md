caption: (1) Beta-amyloid oligomers and their subsequent deposition in plaque fuel
  neuroinflammation, leading microglia to produce chemokines that lure monocytes into
  the brain. The chemotaxis process is regulated, among other players, by the TSPO,
  expressed by monocytes and well-known markers of activated microglia. (2) Besides
  entering the blood–brain barrier, peripheral monocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines
  that represent the afferent arm of the “inflammatory reflex”. (3) The efferent arm
  of this reflex is known as the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (CAIP) and
  is represented by a vagal efflux indirectly stimulating the activation of the α7-nicotinic
  cholinergic receptor (α 7nAChR) expressed by peripheral monocytes and shutting off
  inflammasome and cytokine production. Created with BioRender.com.
