caption: Inflammatory microenvironment provokes metaplasia in Barrett’s esophagus
  by several mechanisms. Gastric acid and bile acid reflux in GERD injures the esophageal
  epithelium, inducing an inflammatory response. Cytokines expressed by both injured
  epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells contribute to metaplasia in
  a number of ways. 1. Induce cell proliferation and inhibit the tumor-suppressor
  apoptosis pathways in injured and damaged epithelial cells. 2. Proinflammatory cytokines
  stimulate ROS and eicosanoid production by phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells (including
  epithelial cells), increasing oxidative stresses and DNA mutagenesis. 3. Cytokines
  and chemokines are chemotactic and provoke inflammatory cell migration into the
  involved tissue. Moreover, cytokines influence the differentiation and activity
  of dendritic, macrophage, lymphocytic, and NK cells. 4. Cytokines signal to endothelial
  cells and stimulate angiogenesis. Within the epithelial cells, the combination of
  ROS damage, alterations in DNA methylation patterns, and activation of the NFKB
  signaling pathway (p50 subunit is especially important) by cytokines and the acid/bile
  refluxate contribute to activation of targets genes that further amplify the inflammation
  and ROS (Cox-2) and promote intestinal differentiation (Cdx2).
