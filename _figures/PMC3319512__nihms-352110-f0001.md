caption: Upon stimulation, CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells upregulate glucose uptake
  and glycolysis to provide biosynthetic precursors necessary for growth and proliferation.
  Glucose enters the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate ribose and NADPH
  necessary for nucleotide synthesis and is converted to citrate in the citric acid
  cycle (TCA) for lipid synthesis. Lactate is produced as a byproduct of the rapid
  rate of glycolysis in effector T cells. Treg and CD8+ memory cells instead burn
  lipids through beta-oxidation (β-ox) in the mitochondria and generate ATP through
  electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation (ET/OXPHOS).
