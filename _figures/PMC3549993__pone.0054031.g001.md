caption: 'Unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis begins with the isomerization of trans-2-decenoyl-ACP
  to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP by FabA. Instead of being reduced, this intermediate is condensed
  with malonyl-ACP by FabB. The resulting unsaturated β-ketoacyl-ACP is processed
  analogous to its saturated counterpart until unsaturated C16 and C18 acyl-ACPs are
  made and incorporated into phospholipids. Unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis is
  feedback-inhibited at the transcriptional level by FabR, which exhibits increased
  repression of transcription of fabA and fabB when bound to enoyl-ACP species , .
  Expression of a thioesterase cleaves acyl-ACPs to generate FFA. BTE expression preferentially
  cleaves saturated C12-acyl-ACPs (solid blue arrow) and minorly cleaves unsaturated
  C12- (dashed blue arrow) and saturated and unsaturated C14-acyl-ACPs, thereby depleting
  saturated, long chain acyl-ACPs, the key regulatory signal for controlling fatty
  acid biosynthesis. As a result, flux through the saturated (prior to C10) and unsaturated
  pathway increases. Inset: the four arrows represent the elongation (FabB/FabF) (dashed
  arrow) in which the acyl chain represented by R grows by 2 carbons, ketoreduction
  (FabG), dehydration (FabZ), and enoyl reduction (FabI) reactions that comprise one
  round of fatty acid elongation and reduction.'
