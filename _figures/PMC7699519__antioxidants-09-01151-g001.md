caption: 'Regulation of the NRF2 pathway. NRF2 is regulated by three E3 ubiquitin
  ligases. The main regulation is by the complex KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 (A). Additionally,
  NRF2 can be regulated by the β-TRCP-SKP1-CUL1-RBX1 complex in a GSK-3-dependant
  (B1) or -independent (B2) manner. Upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, NRF2 can also
  be regulated by HRD1 (C). The main regulation (A) involves the repression of NRF2
  by KEAP1 and its proteasomal degradation in basal conditions, while, under oxidative
  stress conditions, the NRF2-KEAP1 binding is disrupted, leading to NRF2 nuclear
  translocation and the activation of its target genes. Other mechanisms of NRF2 repression
  involve the β-TRCP-SKP1-CUL1-RBX1 complex (B 1/2) that, through binding with the
  Neh6 domain of NRF2, particularly enhanced by the GSK-3 phosphorylation of NRF2,
  or, by the binding of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced HRD1 (C) with the Neh4-5
  domains of NRF2, mediate its degradation. In addition, other proteins, such as BACH1,
  can negatively regulate the transcriptional activation of the NRF2-target genes
  by competing with NRF2. Abbreviations: AKR1B3—aldo-keto reductase family 1 member
