caption: 'Role of WNT/beta-catenin signaling in gliomas. When the canonical WNT/β-catenin
  pathway is upregulated, binding of WNT to FZD leads to activation of DSH, which
  recruits the destruction complex to the plasma membrane. AXIN binds to the cytoplasmic
  tail of LRP5/6. WNT also binds LRP5/6. This initiates LRP phosphorylation and DSH-mediated
  FZD internalization. Activation of DSH leads to the inhibition of GSK-3β, which
  further reduces the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. The β-catenin
  degradation complex AXIN/APC/GSK-3β is inactivated with the recruitment of AXIN
  to the plasma membrane. β-catenin phosphorylation is inhibited. Then, β-catenin
  accumulates into cytosol and translocates to the nucleus to bind the TCF–LEF co-transcription
  factors. This induces the canonical WNT-response gene transcription (c-Myc, cyclin
  D, PDK1, and MCT-1). The STAT3 signaling pathway upregulates the expression and
  transcriptional activity of β-catenin; in gliomas STAT3 is a tumor aggressiveness
  factor. In gliomas, overexpression of EGFR (a receptor tyrosine kinase: RTK) stimulates
  the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K/Akt signaling leads to the phosphorylation of GSK3β that
  leads to the nuclear translocation and stabilization of β-catenin. In the same way,
  the WNT/β-catenin pathway stimulates EGFR in gliomas. Akt signaling increases MMP-2
  and MMP-9 activity, which induces the invasion of malignant cells into healthy brain
  near the glioma. Akt signaling induces HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha),
  which stimulates PDK1. Overexpression of WNT/β-catenin also stimulates PDK1. PDK1
  and Myc induce lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), and cytosolic pyruvate is shunted
  into lactate through activation of LDH-A. Overexpression of MCT-1 exports lactate
  to the extracellular space. Lactate production activates angiogenesis. c-Myc-induced
  glutaminolysis supports mitochondrial integrity and the production of aspartate,
  and results in nucleotide biosynthesis. c-Myc and cyclin D stimulate the proliferation
  of gliomas.'
