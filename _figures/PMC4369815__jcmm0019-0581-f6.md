caption: Schematic diagram of the signalling pathways involved in DEHP-induced β-cell
  dysfunction. We showed that exposure to 25, 125 or 625 μM DEHP induced persistent
  ER stress and significant oxidative damage in INS-1 cells, ultimately contributing
  to cell dysfunction and apoptosis. DEHP caused ER stress in INS-1 cells mainly by
  elevating transcription and translation of ER chaperone, activation of PERK–ATF4–CHOP
  signalling pathway, as well as depletion of ER Ca2+. Apart from ER stress, DEHP
  triggered oxidative stress in INS-1 cells. However, cellular defence differed between
  cells treated with low and high levels of DEHP. Of DEHP, 5 μM activated Nrf2-mediated
  antioxidant response, but it also blunted physiological ROS signalling, thereby
  reducing insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. Of DEHP, 25, 125 or 625 μM degraded Nrf2,
  blocked the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant defence protection and further increased
  the production of ROS in INS-1 cells, which resulted in irreversible oxidative damage
  and cell apoptosis.
