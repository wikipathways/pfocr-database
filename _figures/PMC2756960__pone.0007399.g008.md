caption: The diagram depicts the AKT response to IGF-1 signaling which increases protein
  synthesis. Two regulatory proteins of the AKT/mTOR pathway are differentially expressed
  in callipyge hypertrophied muscles. Factors that are inhibitory of protein synthesis
  are indicated in red and stimulatory factors are green. Transcripts that were down-regulated
  in callipyge (+/CPat) muscle are rectangles and transcripts that were up-regulated
  in callipyge muscle are cross shaped. In this model, the phosphatase activity of
  PTEN is inhibited by PARK7 and TXNIP and the AKT/mTOR response to normal physiological
  levels of growth factors is magnified to increase protein synthesis rates.
