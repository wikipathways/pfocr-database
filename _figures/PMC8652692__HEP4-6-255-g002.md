caption: 'IL‐6 signaling (classical vs. trans‐signaling) in COVID‐19. Excessive inflammatory
  cytokine signaling, particularly through IL‐6, is thought to be an important factor
  in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. IL‐6 induces downstream signaling through JAK/STAT
  activation through two pathways. One is classical IL‐6 signaling through IL‐6 binding
  to the ligand‐binding alpha subunit of its receptor (gp80/IL‐6Rα) and subsequently
  recruiting the signaling beta subunit (gp130) to produce downstream signaling. This
  pathway is thought to be anti‐inflammatory and to promote liver regeneration. The
  other is trans‐signaling that occurs with IL‐6 binding to a soluble form of the
  receptor alpha subunit. ADAM17, which is typically increased in inflammatory conditions,
  cleaves the membrane‐bound IL‐6Rα, increasing sIL‐6R and creating opportunity for
  formation of the IL‐6/sIL‐6R complex, which then interacts with gp130 on target
  cells that may not express membrane‐bound IL‐6Ra. IL‐6 trans‐signaling is thought
  to be the major route of IL‐6 signaling to LSECs and has been implicated in endotheliopathy
  (proinflammatory and procoagulant state) in COVID‐19. The sIL‐6R levels are increased
  in COVID‐19, with a likely result of increased trans‐signaling. Abbreviation: gp80,
  interleukin‐6 receptor ligand‐binding domain.'
