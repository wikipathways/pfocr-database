caption: Regulation of ampC expression. (A) Under normal cellular conditions expression
  of ampC is repressed. LMM PBPs such as PBP4 hydrolyse uncross-linked peptidoglycan
  pentapeptides to tetrapeptides. During recycling of peptidoglycan, peptidoglycan
  fragments (the majority being NAG-NAM tetrapeptide cleaved from the NAG-NAM chains
  by lytic transglycosylases) are imported into the cytoplasm. NAG is removed by NagZ,
  after which NAM is cleaved from the peptide side chain by AmpD. NAG, NAM and the
  peptide side chains are used in synthesis of new peptidoglycan. Excess peptidoglycan
  precursor UDP-NAM pentapeptide formed through recycling as well as de novo synthesis
  binds to the AmpR regulator protein, which acts as a repressor inhibiting ampC expression.
  (B) β-lactams cause upregulation of ampC. Increased peptidoglycan recycling occurs
  because of the presence of β-lactams, which also inhibit conversion of tetrapeptides
  to pentapeptides by LMMs PBPs. The resulting peptidoglycan fragments (primarily
  NAG-NAM pentapeptide but also NAG-NAM tripeptide [not shown]) are imported into
  the cytoplasm. In the recycling pathway, AmpD becomes saturated because of increased
  amounts of peptidoglycan fragments, increasing the intracellular concentrations
  of the AmpR activator molecules NAG-NAM pentapeptide, NAM-pentapeptide and NAG-NAM
  tripeptide. Increased export of UDP-NAM pentapeptide for peptidoglycan synthesis
  also occurs. The activator molecules outcompete UDP-NAM pentapeptide for binding
  to AmpR and the AmpR-activator complexes trigger increased expression of ampC. UDP,
  uridine diphosphate; NAG, N-acetyl glucosamine; NAM, N-acetyl muramic acid; pentapeptide,
  L-alanine-γ-D-Glutamate-meso-DAP-D-Ala-D-Ala.
