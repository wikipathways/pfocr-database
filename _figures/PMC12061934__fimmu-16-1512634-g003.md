caption: Effects of CD4+ T cells on ischemic stroke (IS). In the early stage of IS,
  CD4+ T cells induced neuronal death in multiple manners. These cells directly kill
  neurons by activating Fas/FasL signaling pathway. In addition, CD4+ T cells promote
  M1 phenotype polarization by NF-κB pathway and then induce neuronal death. Moreover,
  the secretion of IL-21 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase the neuronal injury.
  In the late stage of IS, CD4+ T cells reduce the survival and proliferation of neural
  stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). These cells also induce delayed B cells to infiltrate
  into the infarct region, which alleviates the poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI)
