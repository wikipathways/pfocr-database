caption: Mechanisms of Tax activation of AP-1 pathway. Pathways upstream of AP-1 are
  normally activated in response to external stimuli whereas presence of Tax overrides
  this requirement. Indeed Tax is able to activate the Akt/PI3K pathway as well as
  the SRF pathways thus activating at the transcription of c-Fos, Fra-1, c-Jun, JunB,
  and JunD genes. By interacting with the JNK inhibitor G-protein pathway suppressor
  2 (GPS2), Tax also participate to the exhibited highly activity of AP-1 in HTLV-1
  infected cells through a constitutive activation of JNK (). Interestingly, AP-1
  proteins such as c-Jun and c-Fos activate the transcription through the 21 bp repeat
  in HTLV-1 LTR.
