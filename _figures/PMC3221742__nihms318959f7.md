caption: A graphical model of vesicular-mediated OS protein transport pathways which
  are affected in the tulp1−/− retina. This simplified schematic focuses on the normal
  flow of the pathways, shown in green dashed lines, and the segment in the pathways
  that are affected in the tulp1−/− retina, shown with red Xs. The pathway on the
  right shows a simplified depiction of the guanylate cyclase transport system. Peripheral
  membrane-associated proteins are posttranslationally processed solely in the ER
  and extracted for transport with the help of proteins such as PrBP/δ. In the tulp1−/−
  photoreceptor, PrBP/δ is correctly localized along with several peripheral membrane-associated
  proteins, indicating that Tulp1 is not directly involved in the transport of peripheral
  membrane-associated proteins. Although GCAP1 is a mislocalized peripheral membrane-associated
  protein, its disruption in the tulp1−/− photoreceptor is proposed to be caused by
  its co-transport in guanylate cyclase carriers. The left pathway shows a simplified
  depiction of rhodopsin transport through the IS. In the wt IS, rhodopsin molecules
  are posttranslationally modified in the Golgi apparatus, and are inserted into carrier
  vesicles generated from the TGN surface. Rab6 and Rab11 are involved in the budding
  of these rhodopsin-laden vesicles. In the tulp1−/− photoreceptor, Rab11 is mislocalized.
  The cytosolic protein arrestin may be co-transported in the rhodopsin transport
  pathway in the wt photoreceptor; however, it translocates to the OS in response
  to light. In the tulp1−/− photoreceptor, arrestin is not localized to the OS after
  light exposure. Rab8 is responsible for the docking and fusion of vesicles with
  the IS plasma membrane, which is necessary for the subsequent transport of rhodopsin
  through the CC to the OS discs. It is mislocalized in the tulp1−/− photoreceptor.
  Therefore, these data point to a role for Tulp1 at a step between vesicular budding
  at the TGN and transport of specific proteins through the CC.
