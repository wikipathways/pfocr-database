caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in pluripotency. (A) Wnt signaling pathway is
  stimulated via binding of Wnt proteins with frizzled receptors. This subsequently
  activates Dsh, which replaces GSK-3β from the Axin-APC complex, preventing degradation
  of β-catenin. Subsequently, β-catenin translocates into the nucleus where it associates
  with TCF/LEF proteins to activate transcription of Wnt target genes that cause self-renewal.
  (B) TGF-β signals through two main receptors, ie, the type II receptor and the Activin
  receptor. Upon activation, ligand-specific Smad proteins (Smad2/3) are phosphorylated
  and form a complex with Smad4, which translocates to the nucleus to activate gene
  expression. (C) The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by IGF-1. Activation of PI3K activates
  Akt, which modulates the threshold of Smad2/3 activity and inhibits Erk and maintains
  GSK-3β activity, which in turn induces expression of Nanog. (D) The Jak/Stat signal
  pathway is principally initiated by LIF, which likewise initiates PI3K through which
  Akt and Erk are activated, ultimately resulting in upregulation of expression of
  Klf4 and Myc.Abbreviations: Dsh, Dishevelled; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; LIFR,
  leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta; IGF-1, insulin-like
  growth factor-1.'
