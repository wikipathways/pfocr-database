caption: Schematic diagram of HGF-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenesis in primary
  hepatocytes. HGF signaling pathway activates AMPK signaling, leading to USF-1 activation
  via a DNA-PK-dependent pathway. USF-1 indirectly inhibits gluconeogenesis by binding
  to corepressor SHP gene promoter and induces SHP gene expression, which subsequently
  inhibits key gluconeogenic enzyme genes PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase (G6Pase) via inhibition
  of HNF4α and results in decreased gluconeogenesis.
