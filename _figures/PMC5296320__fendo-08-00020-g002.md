caption: (A) Schematic representation of the role of pancreastatin (PST) in the regulation
  of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. PST-induced nitric oxide (NO) production,
  following a guanylate cyclase–cGMP–NOS pathway, inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin
  secretion (GSIS). (B) Schematic diagram showing PST inhibition of gluconeogenesis
  in hepatocytes. PST initiates a GTP-binding protein linked signaling cascade leading
  to activation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium-dependent conventional PKC (cPKC),
  which attenuates IRS–PI3K–PDK1–AKT signaling pathway. In addition, stimulation of
  the cGMP–NOS pathway also assaults this signaling pathway by nitrosylation of IRS.
  Thus, PST-mediated suppression of this pathway allows forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1)
  and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP1c) to stimulate
  expression of gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) (also
  known as Pepck) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) (also known as G6Pase), and thus
  prevent insulin action. Under control conditions, insulin would have activated this
  signaling pathway, causing phosphorylation of FoxO1 (promoting its exclusion from
  the nucleus) and preventing processing of SREBP1 proprotein to SREBP1c with consequent
  inhibition of expression of gluconeogenic genes and gluconeogenesis. (C) Catestatin
  (CST) stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. Activation of α2-adrenergic receptor
  (α2-AR) inhibits β1/2-AR-induced lipolysis in a dominant way in obesity. CST enhances
  lipolysis by inhibiting α2-AR, which promotes β1/2-AR action and the consequent
  downstream signaling. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an intracellular, neutral
  lipase that has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol
  (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), monoacylglycerol (MAG), and cholesteryl esters. Its
  activity against DAG is about 10- and 5-fold higher than its activity against TAG
  and MAG, respectively, whereas its activity against cholesteryl esters is about
  twice its activity toward TAG. The hydrolytic activity of HSL against TAG and cholesteryl
  esters, but not against DAG, is stimulated by phosphorylation mediated primarily
  by PKA (). AC, adenylyl cyclase; FFA, free fatty acids; MGL, monoacylglycerol lipase;
  PKA, protein kinase A. (D) Summary of PST and CST actions.
