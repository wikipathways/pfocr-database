caption: Regulatory signalling of mitochondrial dynamics and their cooperative networks
  under diabetic milieu. Excess fission was mediated through the upstream signalling
  that directly stimulated DRP1 phosphorylation and DRP1 facilitated proteins. These
  included Rap1b ‐ ERK1/2 – C/EBP‐ β cascade, ROCK1, NR4A1 – P53 and DUSP1 – JNK pathway.
  In addition, fission could indirectly activate through the excess of ROS generation
  and apoptosis as a result of decreased DsbA‐L and increased of MIOX. The downregulation
  of mitochondrial fusion was regulated through the MIOX, which intervened the PINK1
  facilitated Parkin and MFN2 interactions, and the direct inhibitory effect of high
  glucose state. Mitochondrial biogenesis was mainly suppressed via the decreased
  of PGC‐1α in consequence of direct high glucose mediated, and the alteration of
  Rap1b ‐ ERK1/2 – C/EBP‐ β pathway. Autophagy (mitophagy) was impaired through the
  perturbation of NR4A1‐P53 and MIOX – PINK1 – Parkin signalling. Notably, alteration
  of each process was conversely deteriorated one another. C/EBP‐ β, CCAAT‐enhancer
