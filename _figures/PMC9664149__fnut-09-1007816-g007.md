caption: 'Oxidative stress, reduced glutathione (GSH) and atherosclerosis. (1) Risk
  factors for atherosclerosis. (2) Atherosclerosis risk factors facilitate oxidative
  stress and inflammation in the arterial intima. Native C-reactive protein (nCRP),
  a pattern recognition receptor produced in the liver, macrophages, lymphocytes,
  smooth muscle cells (SMC), and other cells, promotes inflammation through monomeric
  CRP (mCRP) enhancing intimal oxidative stress. Oxidized (ox) LDL binds macrophage
  toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and facilitates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADP)H oxidase 2 (Nox2) activity and superoxide (O2–) production causing cysteine
  oxidation, disulfide bridge formation and S-glutathionylation. Xanthine oxidase
  (XO) and inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase further facilitate O2–
  cellular activity. OxLDL bound to TLRs 2 and 4 promotes foam cell formation and
  activates transcription factors like nuclear factor (NF)-κB facilitating cytokine
  storm and hyperinflammation. Excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generation further enhances cytokine production. CRP (nCRP, mCRP) can facilitate
  macrophage and neutrophil uptake of apoptotic cells through Fcγ and Fcα receptors,
  respectively (FcRs). Oxidative stress also activates the Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant
  response element (ARE) redox regulator pathway in monocytes [see (3) and macrophages
  (2)], releasing Nrf2 to regulate the expression of genes that control antioxidant
  enzymes like glutathione S-transferase (GST), facilitating glutathione (GSH) activity.
  Macrophages, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and SMCs can generate mCRP increasing inflammation.

  generate mCRP, increase O2– and ROS formation and reactive nitrogen species like

  and thrombosis. TLR 4-mediated oxLDL-binding to platelets promotes thrombosis; mCRP
  binding to lipid rafts and FcγRs enhances inflammation; and endothelial activation
  allows intimal cell migration. GSH enhancement and Nrf2 activation augment immunity
