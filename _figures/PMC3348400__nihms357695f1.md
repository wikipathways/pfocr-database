caption: 'Schematic representation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-CCAAT
  enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) pathway activated during memory formation. Neurotransmitters,
  growth factors, and membrane depolarization are examples of the stimuli that activate
  intracellular signal transduction pathways that can lead to the activation of the
  CREB-dependent pathway. Growth factors, signal via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),
  which upon ligand binding and dimerization, induces activation of two pathways:
  the Ras/Raf/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ MAP kinase kinase (MEK) and
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathways. Activations of these pathways
  recruit additional protein kinases including p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK2) and
  mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) for the MAPK-dependent pathway
  and Akt and p70S6 kinase(p70S6K) for the PI3K-dependent pathway to catalyze phosphoryation
  of CREB (pCREB) in its Ser-133 residue, which is an important step for its activation
  . CREB phosphoryation can also be achieved by many neurotransmitters binding to
  their receptors. Via these receptors, neurotransmitters can couple of cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) by regulating adenylyl cyclase activity. cAMP recruits protein
  kinase A (PKA) as the main kinase for CREB phosphorylation. Phosphodiesterase (PDE)
  can catalyze the hydrolysis of cAMP and inhibit its signaling. Additionally, increases
  in intracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage- or ligand-gated cation channels such
  as voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) or NMDA receptors (NMDARs) can also
  lead to CREB phosphorylation via different calcium-dependent protein kinases . Once
  phosphorylated, CREB recruits its transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein
  (CBP) to promote transcription . The functional activation of CREB leads to the
  expression of target genes, among which are immediate early genes (IEGs), such as
  the transcription factor C/EBP , , which, in turn, regulates the expression of late
  response genes including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) . Transcriptional
  regulation is further regulated by the chromatin state. In general, histone acetyl
  transferases (HATs) acetylate histone tails and promote a relaxed chromatin state
  and transcription. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), on the other hand, de-acetylate
  histones and promote a condensed chromatin state and genes silencing . Abbreviations:
  AC,, adenylyl cyclase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.'
