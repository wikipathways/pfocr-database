caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways promote chronic inflammation involved in
  developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Two distinct pathways are involved in chronic
  inflammation during hepatocarcinogenesis. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by
  exogenous factors, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying cells. These, in turn, are recognized by specific
  receptors expressed in inflammatory cells and platelets. PAMPs and DAMPs activate
  platelets, which release medium-sized extracellular vesicles (mEVs) able to exit
  the vasculature, reach tissues, and sustain inflammation, thus increasing cancer
  risk. The intrinsic pathway, induced by alteration in cancer-associated genetic
  factors, activates the expression of inflammation-related programs, thus contributing
  to the generation and perpetuation of an inflammatory milieu. All these events further
  contribute to the overexpression of COX-2 and enhanced PGE2 biosynthesis, promoting
  the transformation of normal epithelial cells to cancer. Antiplatelet drugs, such
  as low-dose Aspirin, can affect the early step of tumor development by inhibiting
  platelet function. In contrast, selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) may exert an
  antitumor effect by inhibiting the synthesis of PGE2 in leukocytes and tumor cells.
