caption: 'ClC-Kb/2 expression and function in the distal nephron. A: schematic representation
  of electrolyte transport in the thick ascending limb (TAL, top) and distal convoluted
  tubule (DCT, bottom). ClC-Kb/2 mediates basolateral Cl− exit participating in transcellular
  Cl− reabsorption together with the apically localized NKCC2 (Slc12A1) and NCC (Slc12A3)
  in the TAL and DCT, respectively. Activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase and K+ Kir4.1/5.1
  (KCNJ10/16) channel determines basolateral membrane voltage, creating favorable
  electrochemical gradient for ClC-Kb/2-mediated Cl− current. In addition, electroneutral
  K+-Cl− exit via KCC4 is outlined. Cl− dependency of the with-no-lysine (WNK)/Ste20-like
  proline-alanine rich kinase (SPAK) signaling network is shown for DCT. A similar
  pathway likely operates in TAL, but the direct experimental evidence is missing.
  B: schematic representation of electrolyte transport in the cortical collecting
  duct (CCD). Principal cells express the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the
  apical side and Kir4.1/5.1 and Na+-K+-ATPase on the basolateral membrane to control
  Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion via the apical ROMK channel. H+ (type A)- and
  HCO3− (type B)-secreting cells regulate acid-base balance and mediate transcellular
  Cl− reabsorption via Slc4A11 and Slc26A4 (pendrin) anion exchangers and basolateral
  ClC-Kb/2 Cl− channel, respectively.'
