caption: Negative effects of resveratrol on NF-κB via several pathways in SCI. In
  TNFR1 apoptotic pathway, Ub chains conjugated with RIPK1 function as scaffolds in
  the recruitment and activation of TAK1-binding protein 2/3–TAK1 complex and inhibition
  of IKK complex (NEMO-IKKa-IKKb), subsequently triggering off the classical NF-κB
  signaling pathways that collectively promote transcription of genes, which prevents
  cell death and sustains inflammation. In MyD88-dependent pathway, TLR recruits toll-interleukin
  1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein at the cell membrane, subsequently
  facilitating recruitment of MyD88, which in turn triggers early-phase activation
  of NF-κB. Recruitment of TRAM and TRIF leads to late-phase activation of NF-κB.
  IKK phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ leading to poly ubiquitination of IκBs. Degradation
  of IκBs results in activation of NF-κB. Besides, degenerated myelin activates FAK/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB
  pathway in macrophages and promotes expression of inflammatory mediators. Stimulation
  of TWEAK-Fn14 pathway also promotes NF-κB expression. On the contrary, SIRT1 inhibits
  NF-κB activation. Eventually, NF-κB enters the nucleus to activate target gene expression.
  Resveratrol potentially enhances SIRT1 and AMPK expressions. AMPK activation increases
  NAD+/NADH ratio and triggers its downstream whereas SIRT1 acts as an anti-inflammatory
  NAD+-dependent deacetylating enzyme via direct deacetylation of subunit of NF-κB
  such as p65, SIRT1 directly interacts with RelA/p65. Also, resveratrol suppresses
  IKK activity.
