caption: 'Simplified acetone-butanol-ethanol metabolic pathway in solventogenic clostridia.
  Some strains harbor a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (s-adh) that enables the formation
  of isopropanol. In C. acetobutylicum, the acidogenic phase and solventogenic phase
  succeed each other during the fermentation. During exponential growth, the substrate
  is metabolized to form lactate, acetate, and butyrate during the acid phase. At
  stationary phase, the acids are reassimilated, and the culture produces ethanol,
  acetone (or isopropanol), and butanol. However, in other solventogenic species (C.
  beijerinckii for example), acidogenic and solventogenic phase occur concomitantly
  and solvent production starts during the exponential phase. The enzymes involved
  in the metabolic pathway are in grey boxes: pta, phosphotransacetylase; ack, acetate
  kinase; thl, thiolase; hbd, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase; crt, crotonase;
  bcd, butyryl-CoA-dehydrogenase; ctfA/B, CoA-transferase; buk, butyrate kinase; ptb,
  phosphotransbutyrylase; adh, aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase; edh, ethanol dehydrogenase;
  adc, acetoacetate decarboxylase; s-adh, secondary alcohol dehydrogenase; ald, butyraldehyde
  dehydrogenase; bdh, butanol dehydrogenase and -P stands for phosphate. As indicated
  by its title, this figure represents a simplified ABE pathway; indeed, studies have
  shown a diversity in the structure and number of enzymes involved depending on the
  solventogenic species'
