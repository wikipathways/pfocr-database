caption: Schematic representation of herbivory-induced early signaling events (calcium
  signaling, ROS generation, activation of MAPK Pathway) and involvement of CMLs in
  plant defense response against insect attack. Upon herbivory, plants perceive stimuli
  and instigate a couple of early events, such as activation of calcium signaling,
  induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and generation of reactive
  oxygen species, which transduce the signal and activate the biosynthesis of other
  signaling and defensive compounds. In soybean, the expression of few GmCMLs, one
  of the crucial Ca2+ sensors, is upregulated during S. litura-infestation. GmCMLs
  have Ca-EF hands, which allow them to sense calcium signature and bind with Ca2+,
  which can further regulate downstream signaling and activate plant defense response.
