caption: Beneficial effects of immunobiotic bifidobacteria on the innate immune response
  against rotavirus in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Rotavirus double-strand
  genomic RNA activates toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I
  (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5), which are pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in IECs. Cellular signaling cascades mediated
  by interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) upregulate the expression of type
  I (IFN-α, IFN-β), and type III (IFNλ1, IFNλ2/3) IFN, which in turn induces the synthesis
  of IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral activities (MxA, Mx1, RNase L, OAS, PKR).
  Antiviral PRRs also activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway and induce the secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, MCP-1, CXCL10). Preventive treatment
  of IECs with Bifidobacterium infantis MCC12 or Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274 reduce
  the expression of A20, increase the activation of IRF3, improve the production of
  the antiviral factors IFN-α, IFN-β, MxA, and RNase L, and differentially regulate
  the expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and CXCL10.
