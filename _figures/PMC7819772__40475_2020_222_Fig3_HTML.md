caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for the establishment of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis
  in diabetic patients. a (1) Tissular microenvironment in a diabetic patient is altered;
  there are high levels of glucose, free iron, and ketone bodies (BHB, B-hydroxy butyrate);
  and these conditions cause stress on the endoplasmic reticulum in the adjacent epithelial/endothelial
  cells. (2) In response to ER stress, GRP78 is overexpressed and relocated in diverse
  cellular compartments, particularly on the cell surface, carried by several co-chaperone
  proteins like MTJ-1 and Par-4. (3) Once GRP78 is exposed on the cell surface (csGRP78),
  it favors the possibility of interaction with the hyphae of R. oryzae through the
  expression of their CotH3 proteins. b (4) The interaction between the GRP78 and
  CotH3 proteins promote hyphae that can damage cells and penetrate the epithelium.
  (5) The association of R. oryzae hyphae to laminin and type IV collagen in the basement
  membrane allows their adherence and entry into the interstitium where the fungi
  can approach blood vessels. The microenvironmental imbalance offers favorable conditions
  for fungus growth: energy (high glucose), free iron for its metabolic requirements,
  as well as a conducive acidic environment generated by ketone bodies. (6) Meanwhile,
  endothelial cells continue to produce GRP78 in all compartments and the hypha can
  associate with these proteins on the basal side where the presence of reticulin
  fibers are exceeded, which allows it to anchor and outflank this area to later interact
  with GRP78 expressed on the luminal surface of endothelial cells. Once internalized
  in the lumen of the blood vessels, the fungi consequently induce the extrinsic coagulation
  pathway activation, consequently cell damage occurs, and all this triggers the formation
  of thrombus. (7) This results in ischemia and sustained hypoxia, which generates
  infarction of the tissues and its consequent necrosis. (8) Finally, the altered
  microenvironment in diverse tissular compartments of these patients generates GRP78
  overexpression, allowing Rhizopus spp. to find this protein in any type of epithelial
  or endothelial cell, establishing its interaction and continuing its invasive behavior'
