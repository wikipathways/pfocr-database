caption: (A) Transcriptional circuits. Hypoxic repressors Efg1 and Bcr1 (red) and
  hypoxic activators Ace2 and Brg1 (green) are mutually connected in regulatory circuits
  to regulate hypha formation of C. albicans. Note that regulatory circuits differ
  depending on the availability of CO2 (blue arrows). (B) Morphogenetic signaling
  pathways. Under normoxia both Cek1 and PKA kinase pathways trigger hypha formation;
  Efg1 phosphorylation provides a major signalling input. Under hypoxia, at temperatures
  ≤ 35°C, low levels of Efg1 phosphorylation block the Cek1 pathway, thereby preventing
  hyphal induction by both pathways.
