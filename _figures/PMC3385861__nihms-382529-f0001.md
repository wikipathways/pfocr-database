caption: The major metabolic pathways of tumors have been targeted at multiple stages
  in various patents and patent applications that were submitted during the past year.Glucose
  transport into the tumor via GluT (1) for tumor detection; new analogs of classical
  glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) (2); multiple steps of the glycolytic
  pathway beyond fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) and pyruvate (3); the redirection of
  pyruvate away from lactate formation at the mitochondrial entry step (4); lactate
  efflux from tumors (5); inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (6); “short-circuiting”
  of mitochondrial inner membrane to generate hyperthermic conditions (7); inhibition
  of the electron transport chain (8); target the HIF-1 alpha factor (9); inhibit
  fatty acid synthase and associated pathways (10); target aberrant amino acid metabolism
  (11); alter the redox status of the tumor cell (12); and use the low pH generated
  within the tumor microenvironment for “targeted drug delivery” (13).
