caption: VPA reduces the cytolytic activity in NK lymphocytes against tumor cells.
  VPA reduces the expression of certain receptors that participate in the identification
  of tumor cells, including NKp46, NKp30 (not shown), and NKG2D. This last system
  of receptors recognizes overexpressed stress molecules (UBLP3/MIC) in malignant
  cells, which leads to the activation of different lytic-related activation pathways
  in the NK cell. It is feasible that VPA affects these pathways, including IFN-γ
  secretion by reducing STAT5 phosphorylation, as well as the production of both granzyme
  B and perforin, which are intimately linked to cellular degranulation. VPA also
  diminishes NF-κB activation and the expression of NKG2D, by promoting the acetylation
  and methylation of the H3 histone that is next to the locus of this gene, and it
  blocks HDAC3, which strongly impacts STAT3 phosphorylation, which is required for
  the expression of this receptor. Furthermore, VPA blocks the cell cycle progression
  and increases the expression of both PD1 and the death ligand PD-L1, which is correlated
  with an increase in caspase expression and therefore with apoptosis. Green arrows
  indicate the processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway that are
  augmented and/or promoted by VPA. Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators
  in the signaling pathway that are inhibited by VPA.
