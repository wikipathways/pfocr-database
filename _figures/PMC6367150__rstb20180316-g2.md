caption: Bt-resistance mechanisms in target pests. The main mechanisms include disruption
  of the activation of Bt protoxin, mutations or regulation of Bt receptors such as
  cadherin, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, alkaline phosphatases (ALPs),
  and aminopeptidase N (APNs), and changes in immune systems. In Bt-resistant insects,
  activation of Bt toxin and binding of specific receptors on the midgut membrane
  can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, reducing
  the expression level of Bt-receptor genes via different transcription factors. The
  MAPK pathway and other regulators may enhance resistance to Bt toxin through the
  repair of cell membrane damage and changes in the immune system. SSS, sodium solute
  symporter; GSL, glycosphingolipids; TF, transcription factor.
