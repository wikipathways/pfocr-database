caption: There are multiple pathways of communication between gut microbes and human
  organs.TMAO is generated via a metaorganismal pathway that begins with gut microbial
  conversion of dietary phosphatidyl choline into trimethylamine, followed by host
  liver oxidation to TMAO by flavin monooxygenases. Gut-liver axis, linking liver
  metabolism and gut microbiota, played an important role in the mechanisms of liver
  disease. Translocated LPS enters the liver through the hepatic portal vein and causes
  damage to liver function. Changes in the gut microbiota can affect the function
  of the central nervous system through multiple signaling pathways, including the
  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune regulation, serotonin metabolism, and
  production of neuroactive compounds.
