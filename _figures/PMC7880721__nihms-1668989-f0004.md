caption: Post-endocytosis, coronavirus can traffic to the endosome where it fuses
  with the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing the viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol
  (step 1). After uncoating, the positive-strand RNA is likely co-translationally
  translocated on the ER via the Sec61 translocon (step 2). This generates polyproteins
  pp1a and pp1ab which, following proteolytic cleavage, produce non-structural proteins
  (NSPs) 1–16. Some of the NSPs facilitate the formation of an ER-derived double-membrane
  vesicle (DMV) (step 3) that functions as the replication site of the viral genomic
  RNA (gRNA) (step 4). Intriguingly, sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) produced after nested
  transcription of the gRNA also occurs in the DMV; the sgRNAs encode the four viral
  structural proteins S, E, M, and N. Next, the replicated gRNA and sgRNA are exported
  from the interior of the DMV into the cytosol (step 5). The sgRNA encoding S, E,
  and M are targeted to the ER where the translation of their messages generates the
  S, E, and M transmembrane proteins (step 6), while the sgRNA encoding N is translated
  in the cytosol to produce the N protein. The cytosolic N protein then associates
  with the gRNA, and the complex is targeted to the ERGIC compartment where it assembles
  with the S, E, and M proteins (which reached the ERGIC from the ER) (step 7). The
  newly assembled virus finally exits the host cell via the secretory pathway.
