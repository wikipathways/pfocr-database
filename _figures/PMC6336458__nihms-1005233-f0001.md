caption: Human oncogenic viruses modulate signal transduction pathways that control
  cell growth, proliferation and survival to optimize cellular conditions for viral
  replication, virion assembly and autophagic evasion in the absence of growth or
  survival signals. Dysregulation of these pathways through mutation or viral factors
  has been implicated in many cancers. Targeting of critical axes in these pathways
  by human oncogenic viral factors is indicated by yellow boxes. Arrows represent
  activation, whereas blocking arrows represent inhibition. Dashed arrows indicate
  activation or promotion with multiple steps not shown. a | Mechanistic target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator that coordinates biomolecule
  availability and stress stimuli to yield tuned responses that promote cell growth
  and inhibit autophagy. Growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  regulates mTORC1 activity through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the serine/threonine
  kinase AKT. Ligand-bound RTKs autophosphorylate and recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane,
  where it converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
  1 (PDK1) and AKT. Multiple viruses modulate the activity of the AKT pathway and
  downstream components, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase β1 (S6K1). b | The mitogen-activated-protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway is also activated by ligand-bound RTKs. Autophosphorylated
  tyrosine residues bind SH2 domains of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2),
  which localizes the guanine-exchange factor son-of-sevenless (SOS) to the inner
  membrane. SOS allows for the exchange of GDP for GTP on RAS. Activated GTP-bound
  RAS initiates a MAPK cascade, which activates transcription factors such as forkhead
  box protein M1 (FOXM1) and additional effectors such as MK2 kinase (MK2K). Together,
  they enhance the expression of pro-survival and pro-inflammatory genes through increased
  transcription and stabilization of mRNAs, respectively. c | A conformational change
  in Notch when bound to ligands on neighbouring cells enables sequential cleavages
  by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) and
  γ-secretase. Cleavage releases intracellular domain of Notch (ICN) into the cytoplasm,
  where it can translocate to the nucleus and coordinate the transcription of proliferation
  and differentiation-related genes with DNA-bound CSL protein and the co-activator
  mastermind-like 1 (MAML1). ICN is downregulated by SEL10 polyubiquitylation-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. d | β-Catenin (βcat) is inactivated in a complex with adenomatous
  polyposis coli gene product (APC) and axin, which phosphorylates βcat and targets
  it for proteasomal degradation. Upon WNT glycolipoprotein binding to extracellular
  domains of prolow-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) and frizzled
  (Frzl), dishevelled (Dsvl) is recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of Frzl. Subsequent
  phosphorylation of LRP sequesters axin and prevents degradation of βcat. Accumulating
  βcat translocates to the nucleus, where it co-activates Drosophila T cell factor
  (dTCF)-mediated transcription of cell growth genes. e | Several immunity-related
  cell surface receptors, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumour necrosis
  factor receptor (TNFR), activate the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway
  when bound to their respective ligands. TLR4 activation leads to phosphorylation
  and recruitment of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) to the adaptor
  protein myeloid differentiation primary response protein MYD88. A complex containing
  the E3-ubiquitin kinase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) forms, which generates
  a scaffold for the polyubiquitin-binding NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) of inhibitors
  of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK). Orphan nuclear receptor TAK1 (also known as NR2C2)
  activates IKK, which then phosphorylates the inhibitory subunit (IκB) and targets
  it for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. A conformational change between
  the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 allows activating phosphorylation and translocation
  to the nucleus, where it induces expression of inflammatory and pro-survival genes.
