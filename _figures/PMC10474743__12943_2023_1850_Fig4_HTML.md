caption: The diagram of combination of ICIs and other treatment. Anthracyclines, taxanes,
  cisplatin, doxorubicin and Albumin-PTX, and eribulin are used to combine with ICIs
  to enhance the clinical response in early and metastatic TNBC. Low-dose RT with
  Nivolumab and RT with Pembrolizumab enhance anti-tumor efficacy in TNBC. The Ad.sT
  interfered with TGF β-1 binding and improved the immunotherapeutic effect of ICIs.
  The regimen of adenovirus-mediated HSV thymidine kinase, SBRT, and pembrolizumab
  improve the therapeutic efficacy in patients with mTNBC, PARPIs upregulate IFN responses
  through the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway to upregulate PD-L1 expression. Low doses of
  VEGFR2 antibodies provoke CD8 + T cells and macrophages to secrete OPN and promote
  the production of TGF-β which upregulates the expression of PD-1. PI3K-γ inhibitor
  eganelisib (IPI-549) and PTX enhanced the efficacy of α-PD1 in TNBC. 2 F-Fuc enhances
  the activation of T cells by reducing B7H3 glycosylation and restoring the susceptibility
  of tumor cells to enhance PD-L1 efficacy. Olaparib, Ipatasertib, cobimetinib, entinostat,
  ladiratuzumab vedotin, and trastuzumab deruxtecan combined with ICIs and chemo drugs
  has demonstrated favorable efficacy in managing TNBC. The combining anti-PD-1 therapy
  with iPPO and MW offers an effective tumor growth inhibition effect. in a study.
  In combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy, mEHGZ effectively induced IFN-γ positivity
  in TNBC. The combination treatment with the CTLA-4 and MUC1 messenger RNA nanomachines
  is associated with lower expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, which may reshape the immunosuppressive
  TME
