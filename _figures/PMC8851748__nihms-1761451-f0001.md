caption: A) HPV E6 binds to STING to inhibit TBK1 and IRF3 binding, and B) HPV E7
  binds to IRF3 to prevent phosphorylation. C) HBV polymerase prevents K63 ubiquitination
  of STING to block STING activation. D) In non-viral cancers such as CRC and melanoma,
  the promoters of both cGAS and STING are methylated to prevent expression of these
  proteins. E) HER2 associates with STING and recruits AKT to phosphorylate TBK1,
  which prevents the kinase from binding to STING and facilitating downstream signaling.
  Viral proteins are depicted in gold, and cellular proteins in green.
