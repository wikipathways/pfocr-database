caption: 'In the glial cell glutamate-glutamine cycle, the excess glutamate (Glu)
  released at the pre-synaptic cleft is transported into the glial cell by the excitatory
  amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT 1/2). Glutamate is converted to glutamine
  by glutamine synthetase (GS). Glutamine (Gln) is then transported into the extracellular
  space by N-system amino acid transporter (SNAT1) and is taken up by the neuronal
  SNAT. Glutamate in the neuron is generated by the action of the enzyme glutaminase
  (GLS) in the mitochondrial matrix. Glutamate is then loaded into synaptic vesicles
  with the transporter protein, vGLUT1, and then is released into the synaptic cleft.
  Not depicted in this pathway are: the uptake of Glu by EAAT3 or metabotropic Glu
  receptors (mGluRs) in the post-synaptic neuron and the action of glutamate dehydrogenase
  in glial cells that links glutamate metabolism with the Krebs cycle by catalyzing
  the reversible reaction α-ketoglutarate + NH3 + NADH ← → Glu + NAD+.'
