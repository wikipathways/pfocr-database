caption: The regulation of gene expression by p53 in response to X-ray.A, The number
  of genes whose expression was induced or repressed by more than twofold after X-ray
  irradiation in p53−/− or p53+/+ mice. We added 1 to each FPKM value to filter out
  genes with low expression levels in this analysis. B, Based on relative changes
  after X-ray irradiation in wild-type or knockout mice, each gene was categorized
  into nine groups. Genes that were not induced or reduced more than twofold by X-ray
  in both p53−/− or p53+/+ mice were defined as X-ray non-responsive genes. The number
  of genes in eight groups except X-ray non-responsive genes was shown by Radar plots.
  The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the number of genes which show more than
  twofold change in knockout mice ((KX + 1)/(K + 1)) and wild type mice ((WK + 1)/(W + 1)),
  respectively. C, The fraction of p53-dependent X-ray-responsive genes among the
  X-ray-responsive genes in each tissue. When the induction/repression pattern was
  not identical between p53+/+ and p53−/− mice, we defined those as p53-dependent
  X-ray responsive genes.
