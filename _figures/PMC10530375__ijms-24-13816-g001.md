caption: Peripheral dopamine (DA) production and actions. In the lung, alveolar type
  II epithelial cells can synthesize DA, which attenuates lung tissue injury, neutrophil
  infiltration, and inhibits inflammatory cytokine response through inhibition of
  NLRP3-signaling pathways. DA may also modulate ventilation by acting on dopamine
  D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) receptors in the arteries of the lung. In the liver, aromatic
  l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is expressed, and DA is produced by hepatocytes.
  D2R can modulate the regulation of components of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Moreover,
  DA may protect the liver from acute injury. In the pancreas, DA is synthesized mainly
  in β-cells that intracellularly express TH and AADC and regulate insulin production
  in these cells. DA reduces the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα,
  IL-1β, and IL-6) induced by cholecystokinin in acute experimental pancreatitis.
  In the intestines, DA is abundant in the mucosal cell layer; the epithelial cells
  of the intestinal mucosa are rich in AADC and circulating DOPA is taken up to produce
  DA. DA reduces the inflammation in human inflammatory bowel disease.
