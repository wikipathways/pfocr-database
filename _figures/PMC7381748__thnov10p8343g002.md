caption: 'The TPL2 signaling. TPL2 signaling pathway is activated following the stimulation
  of several receptors including TNFR, IL-1R, TLRs, CD40 and TCR. Activated TPL2 subsequently
  activates MAPKs signal: ERK1/2, p38α, JNK, and Akt that regulate the activation
  of several transcription factors: NF-κB, AP1, STAT3, C/EBPβ, CREB, ZEB1 and NFATc1.
  These transcription factors induce the expression of various genes such as TNFα,
  IL-6, IL-1β, COX2, VEGF, CXCR4, cyclin D1, HER, EGFR, MMP2, MMP9 and vimentin that
  are involved in inflammation, cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis and
  metastasis. In addition, TPL2 promotes cell survival by inhibiting p27kip expression,
  deactivating p53 through PP2A activity and through the regulation TACE expression.
  TPL2 signaling is also involved in mRNA stabilization and protein translation. In
  the cytoplasm, TPL2-activated ERK1/2 and Akt regulate the mTORC1/S6 signaling pathway
  that modulates the protein translation of inflammatory factors including TNFα, COX2,
  CXCL1, IL-1β and IL-18. Activated p38 might also promote mRNA stabilization by activating
  the MK2. Moreover, activation of RSK1 and MSK1 by ERK1/2 and p38α can promote transcription
  factor activation, mRNA stabilization and translation. (TPL2: tumor progressive
