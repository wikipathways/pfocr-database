caption: NFZ signaling pathway diagram. NFZ binds to STAT3, ERG and ALDH1, thereby
  inhibiting tumor proliferation, inhibiting the phosphorylation of JAK2, inhibiting
  the upstream cytokine IL-6 of STAT3, MAPK and PI3K, and inhibiting the binding of
  PD-1 and PDL-1, thus acting on tumor immunity. In in vivo experiments, it can inhibit
  VEGF and inhibit tumor vascular hyperplasia. It may reduce the growth of tumor swelling
  volume in rats and prevent weight loss in rats. NFZ can be targeted against tumors
  through multiple proteins. NFZ, nifuroxazide; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; ERG,
  one of the families of E-twenty-six transcription factors; PD-1, programmed cell
  death 1; PD-L1, PD-1 ligand 1; NK, natural killer
