caption: 'GlcNAc catabolic pathway: glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, proteoglycans,
  glycolipids, and chitin are the major sources of GlcNAc. Enzymes such as chitinases,
  hexosaminidases, hyaluronidases, etc., release free-GlcNAc from these macromolecules,
  which are taken up by the pathogens. The GlcNAc catabolic pathway involves three
  enzymes: hexokinase, GlcNAc-6-P deacetylase, and GlcNAc-6-P deaminase, which act
  sequentially to convert GlcNAc into fructose-6-phosphate.'
