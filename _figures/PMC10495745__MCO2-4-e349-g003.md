caption: 'Activation of the JAK‐STAT signaling pathway in macrophages. The JAK‐STAT
  axis is one of the important pathways that regulate macrophage polarization and
  function. Various cytokines such as IFN‐γ, GM‐CSF, IL‐4/13, IL‐6, and IL‐10 can
  utilize specific combinations of JAK and STAT members to activate the formation
  of STAT homodimers or heterodimers, thereby affecting gene transcription. STAT homodimers
  can directly bind to GAS to promote the transcription of M1/M2‐related genes, while
  heterodimers such as STAT1/STAT2 bind to IRF9 and then to ISRE to promote M1‐related
  genes transcription. Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; GM‐CSF, granulocyte‐macrophage
  colony‐stimulating factor; IL, interleukin; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; ISRE, IFN‐stimulated response elements; GAS, IFN‐γ‐activated
  sequences. (Created with BioRender.com).'
