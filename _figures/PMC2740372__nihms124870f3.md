caption: Model for translation regulation of NF-κB activation. The eIF2 kinases phosphorylate
  the α subunit of eIF2, which results in the translation inhibition of IκB synthesis.
  The reduction of IκB leads to the dissociation of IκB-NF-κB complex and subsequent
  NF-κB activation. The molecular network was depicted with CellDesigner® diagram
