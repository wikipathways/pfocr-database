caption: Pathway analysis of the phosphoproteomics data. (A) Pathway map of CD28 signaling-related
  proteins. The proteins with phosphorylation sites significantly regulated by CD28
  inhibition are indicated. The pathway map was based on a previous report (). (B)
  Global canonical pathway analysis of significantly regulated phosphoproteins. Additive
  log2 ratio H/M of all phosphorylation sites associated with a pathway are presented.
