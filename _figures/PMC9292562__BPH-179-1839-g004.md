caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regulates the immune response. (a)
  NAD+ controls T cell survival. Increased levels of NAD+ induce apoptosis in naïve
  T cells and Tregs through the activation of ART2 and P2X7 receptors (P2X7R). CD38
  action reduces NAD+ availability for ART2 and protects against NAD+‐induced apoptosis.
  (b) NAD+ levels regulate T cell activation. NAD+ precursors increase TCR‐mediated
  Ca2+ mobilisation via the TRPM2 channel, boosting cell proliferation and IL‐2 production.
  Accordingly, acute depletion of NAD+ by NAMPT inhibition reduced Ca2+ mobilisation.
  (c) NAD+ concentration affects T cell differentiation. SIRT1 inhibits Treg differentiation
  via FoxP3 inhibition, and promotes Th17 function via RORγt activation. Treatment
  with SIRT inhibitor NAM boosts Treg function while supresses Th17 differentiation.
  Lactate levels increase in glycolytic environments, promote NAD+ reduction to NADH
  and slows down the glycolytic flux. Lactate supress effector T cell proliferation,
  and NR administration restores T cell proliferation. In chronic inflammation, lactate
  uptake increases Th17 pro‐inflammatory markers. (d) NAD+ levels control macrophage
  activation. High dose of LPS induce TNF‐α production, inflammasome assembly and
  IL‐1β release by dendritic cells and macrophages. NAM supplementation reduced TNF‐α,
  and NAD+ precursors inhibited inflammasome and IL‐1β, preventing septic shock and
  death in mice. LPS challenge also induces a rapid decrease in NAD+ levels in macrophages
  through PARPs activation. The reduction in NAD+ levels was accompanied by increased
  NAMPT expression to maintain glycolysis and inflammatory function. NAMPT inhibition
  impaired the production of pro‐inflammatory mediators, and supplementation with
  NMN restored glycolysis in these conditions. Moreover, in resting, LPS‐activated
  and senescent macrophages, inhibition of the kynurenine pathway (KP) leads to reduced
  cellular NAD+ concentration, impaired respiration, increased glycolysis and inflammation.
  These defects were restored by exogenous addition of the NAD+ precursor NMN
