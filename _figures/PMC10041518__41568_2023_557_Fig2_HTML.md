caption: a, Deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) is required for the synthesis of DNA.
  Depletion of dTTP by the inhibition of thymidine synthase (TS) results in the accumulation
  of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) and an increase in the dUTP-to-dTTP ratio. As
  DNA polymerases cannot distinguish dUTP from dTTP, this leads to widespread misincorporation
  of uracil and a massive DNA damage response, ultimately resulting in thymineless
  death. b, Nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) are required for the synthesis of RNA;
  inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) or inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
  (IMPDH) depletes NTPs and disrupts RNA transcription. DHODH inhibition by brequinar
  (BQ) or leflunomide (Lef) impairs the productive elongation of RNA polymerase II
  (Pol II) by an unknown mechanism and thereby inhibits oncogenic transcription. Pol
  II pause release is normally triggered by positive transcription elongation factor
  B (P-TEFB), which phosphorylates DSIF and NELF; this causes DSIF to promote elongation
  and results in the dissociation of NELF (left). Pyrimidine depletion using BQ or
  Lef or purine depletion using mycophenolic acid (MPA) disrupt ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
  synthesis by starving RNA Pol I of NTP substrates and thereby hinder ribogenesis
  and the translation of oncogenic proteins (right). c, Uridine triphosphate (UTP)
  is required for the synthesis of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc),
  the substrate for O-GlcNAcylation of proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcylation
  of various proteins, including MYC, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and  phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK1), promotes cancer progression by diverse mechanisms. d, Generation of mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) requires high-energy electrons, either derived
  from α-ketoglutarate (αKG) via the TCA cycle or from DHODH via reduced coenzyme
  Q. DHODH-dependent mitoROS generation thus frees up αKG to produce cytosolic NADPH
  and reduced glutathione (GSH) via a pathway involving malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1)
  and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), allowing for control of cytosolic oxidative stress. Deoxyuridine
  (dU) produced downstream of DHODH serves as another cytosolic reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) quenching agent. Blockade of dU synthesis by inhibition of DHODH or cytidine
  deaminase (CDA) by the CDA inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU) accentuates oxidative
  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress upon treatment with thapsigargin. 5,10-MTHF,
