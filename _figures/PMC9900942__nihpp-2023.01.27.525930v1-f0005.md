caption: The chemical changes during the mechanism of Pks13 are schematized for just
  one side of the two-fold symmetric Pks13 for clarity, and incorporating the two
  structures (ACP1a, ACP1b) we determined. The steps may occur in trans between alternate
  sides as suggested by the relative proximities of the ACPs and the active sites
  of KS, and AT of the contralateral protomer. Only the ACP1a, ACP1b, KS, AT domains
  are cartooned to describe this initial part of the reaction up to the structure
  we determined (third panel). The left panel shows an early stage of the catalytic
  cycle in which the R2 fatty acid substrate chain of length (CH2)24–26 is attached
  to the AT domain as seen in the structure (. The Ppant arm depicted as a wavy line
  ending in a sulfhydryl and seen on ACP1a (yellow, left panel) links to the adenylated
  meromycolyl substrate (R1 (CH2)48–62) from FadD32. ACP1 delivers the attached meromycolyl
  substrate to the KS active site C267 through trans thioesterification as seen in
  the structure (right hand panel). This is the stable state reflected in the structure
  with native substrates bound. In the subsequent steps (not shown, schematized in
  ) the carboxy-acyl substrate R2 is transferred to ACP2. Decarboxylative Claisen
  condensation proceeds between R1 and R2 where the enolate generated by decarboxylation
  attacks the meromycolyl thioester bound to the KS producing an α-alkyl β-ketothioester.
  Finally, the TE domain passes the condensed α-alkyl β-ketothioester product to trehalose
  and is released from Pks13. The product is subsequently reduced by CmrA to form
  trehalose monomycolate (TMM). TMM is subsequently transported across the plasma
  membrane by the transporter MmpL313.
