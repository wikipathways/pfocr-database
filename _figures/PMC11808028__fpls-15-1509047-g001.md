caption: 'The plant cell’s molecular response to NP exposure. Small and large nanoparticles
  infiltrate plant cells, triggering a process termed MAPK signaling, leading to reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation. Numerous genes have been identified as overexpressed
  in response to NPs, including metallothionein (MT), pathogenesis-related genes (PRs:
  PR1, PR2, and PR5), DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen (PCNA), glutathione S-transferase (GSTU12), glutathione reductase (GR),
  and phytochelatin synthase (PCS1); specific microRNAs (miR395, miR397, miR398, and
  miR399); the light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) b gene; and various abiotic stress-related
  genes, including those involved in oxidative stress, salinity, water management,
  sulfur metabolism, glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, metal toxicity detoxification,
  cell division (CycB), cell wall extension (NtLRX1), water transport (aquaporin gene
  NtPIP1), aquaporin gene (LeAqp2), plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast
  intrinsic proteins (TIPs), small and essential intrinsic proteins (SIPs), and tolerance
  to cadmium sulfide quantum dots (MYB-containing gene ELM2), as well as genes implicated
  in high chlorophyll photosynthesis. Additional genes associated with hormonal stimuli
  and plant defense systems [e.g., the ethylene signaling pathway, systemic acquired
  resistance to pathogens, and the auxin-regulated gene linked to organ size (ARGOS)]
  were downregulated after NP treatment. It diminishes the expression of genes associated
  with microbial infection defense, enhancing bacterial colonization and survival
  while decreasing self-protection against pathogens. Additional genes affected by
  NP exposure are glutathione synthetase (GS), 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate
  reductase (APR), sulfite reductase (SiR), cysteine synthetase (CS), glutamate-cysteine
  ligase (GCL), and ATP sulfurylase (ATPS). This figure was created using BioRender'
