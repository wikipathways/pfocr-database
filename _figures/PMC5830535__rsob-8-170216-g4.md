caption: Cholesterol metabolism is perturbed in Mecp2 mutant mice. (a) In the wild-type
  mouse, the brain produces cholesterol in situ as cholesterol cannot pass the blood–brain
  barrier (BBB). Acetyl-CoA enters the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway to make cholesterol
  which has many essential functions (green triangles). The enzyme CYP46A1 converts
  excess cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) for one-way egress across
  the BBB. The liver participates in cholesterol biosynthesis to provide cholesterol
  to other tissues in the body. (b) In pre-symptomatic Mecp2 null mice (3–4 weeks
  old), increased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in the brain leads
  to elevated brain cholesterol levels. Consequently, the expression of Cyp46a1 is
  increased, indicating a heightened need for cholesterol turnover. Outside of the
  central nervous system, serum cholesterol is elevated, and expression of cholesterol
  biosynthesis genes is elevated in the liver. (c) In symptomatic Mecp2 null mice
  (8–10 weeks old), the brain is smaller due to lack of Mecp2. Cholesterol biosynthesis
  decreases drastically in the brain, likely due to feedback from elevated 24S-OHC.
  Owing to decreased synthesis, brain cholesterol remains high, but not as high as
  at younger ages (smaller red arrow). Serum cholesterol and/or triglycerides may
  also be elevated, depending upon genetic background. Triglycerides accumulate in
  the liver, and fatty liver disease develops, as indicated by pale liver.
