caption: Transcriptional regulation of HIF induced by hypoxia, adapted from (3). (A)
  Hypoxia inhibits the proteasomal degradation of HIF-α and promotes its translocation
  into the nucleus. Following interaction with HIF-β, this complex synergistically
  activates the transcription of target genes, thereby enhancing cellular adaptation
  to hypoxic conditions. (B) The specific role of HIF-1α in different cell types is
  discussed. In mitochondria, elevated levels of HIF enhance the upregulation of BNIP3L,
  resulting in increased mitophagy and decreased ROS production. Elevated ROS levels
  compromise the integrity of cellular tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, Occludin,
  and Claudin-5, which in turn increases vascular permeability and contributes to
  vasogenic cerebral edema. In endothelial cells, the accumulation of HIF-1 results
  in the upregulation of VEGF, consequently increasing vascular permeability, compromising
  the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and inducing vasogenic cerebral edemaIn
  microglia, HIF activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway facilitates the release
  of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, increases vascular
  permeability, and contributes to cerebral edema
