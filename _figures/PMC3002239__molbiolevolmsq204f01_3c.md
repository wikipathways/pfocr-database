caption: Metabolic pathways in 35 metabolites in Arabidopsis. (A) Open circles and
  dots denote chemical compounds and enzyme reactions, respectively. The chemical
  compounds of 17 amino acids (red circles) were quantified in this study. All metabolic
  pathways synthesized by less than five enzyme reactions from the 17 amino acids
  are shown in this figure. All the pathways were collected from the TAIR Aracyc database
  (version 5.0). As small molecules, including water, O2, ATP, NADP, NADPH, polyphosphates,
  CO2, H+, phosphates, ADP, UDP, Co-A, NAD, NADH, AMP, and Acetyl-CoA, are involved
  in many reactions or are used as carriers for transferring electrons, they were
  excluded from this map. (B) As an example of the structure of a metabolic pathway,
  two reactions as a minimum metabolic pathway from Gly to Trp are shown. (C) Metabolic
  pathway of 18 secondary metabolites in Arabidopsis. The chemical compounds shown
  in red were quantified in this study. Abbreviation of each metabolite is shown in
  supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online. The metabolic pathways are
  modified from .
