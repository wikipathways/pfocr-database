caption: 'Vigabatrin (VGB) accumulates and increases GABA in the eye, resulting in
  molecular/cellular alterations in the mTOR pathway and GABAergic/glutamatergic receptor
  expression. VGB-treated mice manifest elevated mitochondrial number in the retinal
  pigment epithelia and elevated redox stress markers in whole eye extracts. Partial
  correction of these pathologies ensue with administration of the mTORC1/2 (mTOR
  complex) inhibitor Torin1, which correlate to involvement of hyper-p2448-mTOR activity
  (). Gene expression studies demonstrated down-regulation of the γ subunit of the
  mTOR inhibitor AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), the latter sensitive to altered
  energy levels. AMPK activates autophagy indirectly via mTOR inhibition, while simultaneously
  activating autophagy through Ulk1 (Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) phosphorylation
  (e.g., during glucose starvation). mTOR responds to multiple cues (growth factor,
  tyrosine kinase, insulin, IGF (insulin growth factor) receptor signals), as well
  as amino acid levels, in its coordination of growth and catabolic processes. When
  amino acid levels are high, signaling to mTORC1 favors anabolic processes and inhibition
  of autophagy. Amino acids signal to mTOR through RAG (Ras-related GTP binding protein)
  GTPases and Ragulator at the lysosome. Elevation of RAG proteins and/or transcripts
  with conditions of elevated VGB/GABA suggests that GABA, a non-protein amino acid,
  may increase mTORC1 inhibition of autophagy, resulting in accumulation of mitochondria,
  and potentially other organelles or proteins. Impaired nutrient sensing in response
  to fasting conditions (metabolic changes), and accumulation of aged mitochondria,
  may further disrupt cellular homeostasis resulting in other pathological changes.
  Chronic elevation of GABA in eye downregulates GABA receptor expression (e.g., Gabra,
  Gabrd, Gabbr1/2) while simultaneously altering metabotropic glutamate receptors
  (Grm1/6), the GABA/taurine transporter GAT2 (Slc6a13), and the excitatory vesicular
  glutamate transporter EAAT4 (Slc1a6). These complex signaling processes (autophagic
  flux, mitochondrial accumulation, mTOR and AMPK signaling) and neurological mechanisms
  induced by elevated VGB/GABA may underlie the variable occurrence of ocular pathophysiology
  observed in some children, and less frequently in adults, utilizing VGB. Additional
