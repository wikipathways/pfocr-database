caption: De novo sphingolipid metabolism occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  and starts with the condensation of palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and serine by serine
  palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which can be negatively regulated by ORM1-like protein
  3 (ORMDL3), followed by series of enzyme catalyzed reactions finally forming ceramide.
  Ceramide, generated either from the de novo pathway or from degradation of sphingomyelin
  (SM) or glycosphingolipids (GluCer) can be either phosphorylated by ceramide kinase
  (CerK) to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) or transferred into sphingosylphosphorylcholine
  (SPC) by SM deacylase or deacylated by ceramidase to sphingosine, which is then
  phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by sphingosine kinases (SphKs).
  S1P can be dephosphorylated to sphingosine by a sphingosine phosphate phosphatase
  (SPPase) or converted to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal by S1P lyase (SPL)
  which can then be further converted to glycerolipids.S1P is exported from cells
  by a specific transporter, Spns2, and carried by proteins such as high density lipoprotein
  (HDL)-associated apoM and albumin to the circulation. Extracellular S1P also activates
  five S1P receptors, namely S1P1–5 and function in diverse cell signaling pathways.CDase,
  ceramidase; CerS, ceramide synthase; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; GCase, glucosylceramidase;
  ORMDL3, ORM1-like protein 3; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; Pase, phosphatase;
  SMase, sphingomyelinases; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase.
