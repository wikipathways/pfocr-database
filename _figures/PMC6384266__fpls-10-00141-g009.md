caption: Proposed model for the ISR/PGPR-like response induced during B. japonicum–soybean
  interaction. Red arrows and circles indicate the already described signaling pathway
  involved in AON. Green arrows and circles indicate the proposed signaling pathways
  arising from this research. In wt plants, rhizobia-induced CLE peptides (RIC1 and
  RIC2) are produced in root after NFR5-dependent symbiont perception. Then, CLE peptides
  are transported via xylem to shoot, where they bind to GmNARK triggering the production
  of the SDI, which moves back to the roots and inhibits nodule formation (red arrows
  and circles). A potential role for the systemic ROS production in the AON mechanism
  as well as in the ISR/PGPR-like response is proposed. In this sense, cytokinins
  play a dual role, participating in the mechanism involved in AON and in the ISR/PGPR-like
  response (green arrows and circles). AON, autoregulation of nodulation; CKs, cytokinins;
  GmNARK, Glycine max nodulation autoregulation receptor kinase; ISR, induced systemic
  resistance; NF, Nod factors; NFR5, Nod factor receptor 5; PGPR, plant growth-promoting
  rhizobacteria; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RIC, rhizobia-induced CLE peptides;
  SDI, shoot-derived inhibitor.
