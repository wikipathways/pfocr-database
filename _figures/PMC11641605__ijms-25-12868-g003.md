caption: Intracellular signaling regulation of the ECM signal transmission. The extracellular
  matrix (ECM) conveys signals into cells via focal adhesions, initially phosphorylating
  FAK at the Y397 site. Assisted by Src family kinases (SFKs), FAK is further phosphorylated
  at the Y576 and Y577 sites, leading to its full activation. Activated FAK then phosphorylates
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), VAV2, and GTPase-activating proteins
  (GAPs), thereby activating Rho GTPases, which remodel the cytoskeleton and inhibit
  fiber polymerization, ultimately regulating the activity of the Hippo signaling
  pathway within the cell. Besides, ECM can activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  by releasing stored growth factors that bind to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  on the cell membrane. Akt influence protein expression through the mTORC1 pathway,
  leading to an increased LATS1/2 expression, which ultimately inhibits the nuclear
  translocation of YAP/TAZ. Conversely, when Akt phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3β,
  the reduction of YAP/TAZ phosphorylation allows them to evade 14-3-3 protein binding,
  facilitating their entry into the nucleus to perform functions, which highlights
  the dynamic and complex nature of biological systems. Created with BioRender.com

    Besides, ECM can activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by releasing stored growth

    influence protein expression through the mTORC1 pathway, leading to an increased
