caption: 'Virus-mediated modulation of RAS in COVID-19 patients and influence of sex
  hormones. ACE2 and its analogue ACE are key molecular regulators of RAS, which regulates
  blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance and systemic vascular resistance.
  ACE2 competes with its analogue ACE to keep a balance of the pathways regulating
  these functions. ACE2 metabolises Ang II to Ang 1–7 which further act through Mas1R
  present in lung epithelial cells favouring vasodilatation, anti-inflammation and
  antifibrosis. Conversely, an ACE prevents metabolising Ang II which further acts
  on its cognate receptor AT1R favouring vasoconstriction, fibrosis and increased
  inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 potentially downregulates ACE2 (but not ACE) in the infected
  epithelial cells thus favours an ACE/Ang II/AT1R-mediated pathway leading to vasoconstriction,
  lung fibrosis and increased inflammation resulting in increased disease severity.
  Sex hormones can effectively modulate RAS axis influencing severity of disease in
  COVID-19 patients. Higher serum levels of oestrogen in females plausibly downregulates
  ACE and AT1R, and upregulates ACE2 and Mas1R, thus favours ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas1R-mediated
  regulation of RAS resulting in less severe disease. Conversely, higher serum levels
  of testosterone in male produces an opposite effect. Testosterone by regulating
  expression of TMPRSS2 gene through AR causes increased internalisation of ACE2:
  SARS-COV-2 complex. The increased consumption of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 causes its depletion
  on epithelial cells thus activating the ACE/Ang II/AT1R-mediated pathway favouring
  vasoconstriction, increased tissue inflammation and fibrosis resulting in severe
  COVID-19. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; Ang II, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin
  type II receptor 1; Mas1R, Mas1 proto-oncogene, G protein-coupled receptor.'
