caption: Cystine enters cells via system Xc-, where it is reduced to GSH by thioredoxin
  reductase 1 (TXNRD1)-dependent cystine-reducing pathway. GSH is a potent reducing
  agent that acts as a cofactor for GPX4, promoting the intracellular reduction of
  phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOHs) to the corresponding alcohols (PLOHs) of PLOOHs.
  Glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) utilizes electron-catalyzed oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) provided by NADPH to regenerate GSH. Overloading of iron transporters causes
  an increase in intracellular iron ions, which induces the Fenton reaction, where
  the resulting peroxy radicals attack lipid molecules and oxidize them to lipid peroxides
