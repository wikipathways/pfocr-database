  enzymes abbreviations are noted as follows: NCS, (S)-norcoclaurine synthase; 6OMT,
  (S)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, (S)-coclaurine-N-methyltransferase;
  CYP80B2, (S)-N-methylcoclaurine 3′-hydroxylase; 4′OMT, (S)-3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine-4′-O-methyltransferase;
  BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; SMT, (S)-scoulerine-9-O-methyltransferase; CYP719A1,
  (S)-canadine synthase; THBO, (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase. Broken lines
  indicate uncharacterized enzyme reactions.'
