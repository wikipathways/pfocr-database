caption: Schematic overview of metabolic pathways of P. agglomerans strain P5. The
  portrayed pathways were identified based on the genomic data, which show the strain
  carries genes consistent with the ability to solubilize phosphate compounds. The
  genome also includes a complete carbohydrate metabolic pathway involving glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate metabolism and the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). The latter includes the genes responsible for gluconic acid synthesis
  from D-glucose, such as gcd and gdh and the related pathways. Similarly, the synthesis
  of other organic acids is shown in their specified pathway.
