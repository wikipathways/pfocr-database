caption: PepMV infection of tomato affects the citrate cycle and PTGS. A, Graphic
  representation of the citrate cycle, with intermediate products indicated as blue
  dots and enzymes in italic type (black = represented, gray = not represented on
  the tomato GeneChip). Expression data at 4 and 8 DPI (P < 0.05) are plotted using
  the indicated fold change color scale, with A = the aggressive CH2 isolate and M
  = the mild CH2 isolate. Expression levels similar to the control are indicated in
  gray. B, Graphic representation of the PTGS pathway with expression data at 4 and
  8 DPI (P < 0.05) plotted using the indicated fold change color scale. Expression
  levels similar to the control are indicated in gray. HEN, Hua enhancer (RNA methyltransferase);
  RDR, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; SDE, silencing defective; SGS, suppressor of
  gene silencing.
