caption: A. DIII/IV regions of Aux/IAAs and ARFs are homologous and the DIII/IV of
  most Aux/IAAs and ARFs form a PB1 domain that comprises both an acidic (+) and a
  basic (−) faces.B. When auxin level is low, Aux/IAA proteins and ARFs form multimers
  through directional interaction between the acidic and basic interfaces of their
  DIII/IV regions. Aux/IAAs in the multimers recruit co-repressor complexes, which
  at least consist of TPLs and HDACs and repress transcription of target promoter
  through removing acetyls (Ac) from local chromatin. In addition, Aux/IAAs in the
  multimers may block ARFs from efficient binding to AuxREs in their target promoters.
  When auxin level is high, auxin promotes ubiquitination and degradation of Aux/IAAs
  through a SCFTIR1/AFB-proteosome module, and the released ARFs form dimers and even
  higher-order complexes that activate expression of target genes.
