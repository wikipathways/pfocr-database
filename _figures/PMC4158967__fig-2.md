caption: Overview of central metabolic pathways in the chloroplast. NADPH, Fdx, and
  ATP produced by the photosynthetic light reactions at the thylakoid membrane are
  used by different metabolic pathways in the stroma such as the carbon fixation cycle
  and the synthesis of starch, lipids, amino acids, and chlorophyll (Chl). In the
  dark, NADPH is produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPP), while
  carbon derives from starch degradation. For Abbreviations, see Abbreviations Used
  section. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version
