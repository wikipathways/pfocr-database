caption: Distinct pyrimidine metabolism strategies of Dinoroseobacter shibae phages.
  Selected metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway (adapted from KEGG pathway
  pyrimidine metabolism map00240) are shown to illustrate different pyrimidine metabolism
  strategies used by phages R2C, R4C, R7L, and R26L. Fold changes of detected metabolites
  at different stages of infection are presented. The metabolites participating in
  recycling and de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides are highlighted by boxes.
  The enzymatic reactions encoded by phages are indicated by phage-encoded AMGs
