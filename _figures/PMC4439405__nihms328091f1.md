caption: 'Schematic of the β-cell exocytosis regulatory system. Top: KATP channels
  is the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, RRP is the readily releasable granule pool, DGP
  is the docked granule pool, NGP is the restless newcomer granule pool, RGP is the
  reserve granule pool, TPRi and TPRf are the inactive and activated free target protein
  pool for RRP, TDPf is the free “target protein” pool for docking and priming. Bottom:
  cAMP pathway. Ca2+/CaM is Ca2+-bound calmodulin, Synthesis and degradation of cAMP
  are catalyzed by adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE), respectively.
  AC was activated by stimulatory G protein and Ca2+/CaM and deactivated by inhibited
  G protein, whereas PDE activity was enhanced by Ca2+/CaM, PKA is the protein kinase
  A; PKAa is the activated PKA, EPAC is the guanyl exchange protein, EPACa is EPAC
  activated by cAMP; GLP-1 is glucagon-like peptide-1. Solid lines indicate fluxes,
  and dashed lines indicate inhibitory or stimulatory effects on currents or fluxes.'
