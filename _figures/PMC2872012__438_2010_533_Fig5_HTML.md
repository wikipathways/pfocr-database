caption: Detailed representation of the interactions between the components of the
  gene network. The term “mixed interaction” is used to denote the presence of both
  types, congruent interactions and interactions whereby genes encoding the components
  of the complexes are both congruent and at the same time synthetically lethal, none
  of the types being predominant (see embedded tables for details). Numbers represent
  the raw values for synthetic lethality profile similarity (i.e., the number of genes
  in genetic interaction with both of the genes) and were obtained with the bioPixie
  tool (Myers et al. , http://pixie.princeton.edu/pixie). (SYN-LETH synthetic lethality)
papertitle: Genetic interactions between a phospholipase A2 and the Rim101 pathway
  components in S. cerevisiae reveal a role for this pathway in response to changes
  in membrane composition and shape.
