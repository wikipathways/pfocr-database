caption: Schematic depicting the effect of the PI3-K/Akt pathway and the JNK pathway
  on Bad activation in the peripheral area after brain ischemia/reperfusion injury
  and pharmacological manipulation. The PI3-K/Akt pathway promotes phosphorylation
  of Bad and the association of Bad with 14-3-3, which mediates cell survival. In
  contrast, the JNK pathway encourages the dissociation of Bad from 14-3-3, the dephosphorylation
  of Bad, and the dimerization of Bad with Bcl-XL or Bcl-2, followed by cell death.
  After ischemia/reperfusion injury, the signal balance between the PI3-K/Akt pathway
  and the JNK pathway regulates Bad activation. Bad might play a crucial role as a
  determinant of cell fate after cerebral ischemia. MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; P, phosphate
  group.
