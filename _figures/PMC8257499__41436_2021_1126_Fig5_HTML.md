caption: (a) Signaling pathways enriched in cases by gene disrupting, rare coding
  CNVs detected in the US and Qatar cohorts. Shown are Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) plots. Several of these pathways in both cohorts emerged as enriched in SB
  cases. PCP planar cell polarity, RAR retinoic acid receptor. (b) Metabolic processes
  of choline transport and one-carbon metabolism that are disrupted by rare coding
  CNVs found in SB cases are labeled 1–6. Purple = deletions; blue = duplications.
  Their corresponding CNVs are represented in the lower panel in (b) using the Integrative
  Genomics Viewer (IGV) (for CNV 1–5) and samplot (for CNV 6). Chol choline, Hcy homocysteine,
  Gly glycine.
