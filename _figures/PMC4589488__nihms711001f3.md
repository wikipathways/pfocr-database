caption: A schematic view of bench-to-bedside aspects of colorectal cancer epigenetics.
  This figure illustrates how a normal colonic epithelium undergoes a series of genetic
  and epigenetic alterations and transitions into an adenomatous polyp (via the “traditional
  pathway), or a serrated polyp (via the “serrated pathway’). Thereafter, these polyps
  acquire additional epigenetic alterations and genetic alterations and develop into
  primary CRCs. This normal-polyp-cancer multi-step cascade is governed by the acquisition
  of gene mutations and epigenetic alterations, including aberrant DNA methylation
  and dysregulated expression of several miRNAs. The molecular alterations during
  each step of colorectal cancer development can be measured in tissues (tissue-based
  biomarkers), as well as non-invasively in serum/plasma (blood-based biomarkers)
  and stool (stool-based biomarkers) and thus have potential to be diagnostic, prognostic
  and predictive biomarkers for colorectal cancer.
