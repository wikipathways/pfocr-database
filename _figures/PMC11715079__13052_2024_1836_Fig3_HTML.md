caption: 'T-cells mediated adaptive immune responses. CD4+ T cells trigger the activation
  of APC by secreting Th1 to initiate CTL and secrete IL-2. Pcbps1 promotes CD4 + T
  to generate proinflammatory CK. Splicing RUNX1 exon 6 in PCBPS2 regulates IL-2 signal
  transduction through interaction with mTORC2, facilitating CD4+ T cell activation.
  Two molecular pathways of CD8+ T cells can induce apoptosis in infected cells: the
  granule exocytosis pathway and the Fas-FasL pathway. Created by http://www.Biorender.com'
