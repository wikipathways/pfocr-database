caption: 'Toll-like receptor (TLR) dependent signaling pathways. TLR 2, -4, -10 are
  localized to the cell membrane, while TLR3, -7, -8, -9 are localized to the endosomal
  compartment. Homo- or heterodimerization initiates the signaling via two major downstream
  adaptor proteins, MyD88 and TRIF. MyD88 dependent signaling is common in all the
  TLRs except TLR3. However, TLR4 can signal through both MyD88 and TRIF dependent
  pathway. The TLR engagements results in the formation of myddosome, which consists
  of MyD88, IRAK1 and IRAK4. In the myddosome, IRAK4 activates IRAK1 which in turn
  activates TRAF6. TRAF6 then promotes lysine-63 (K63) linked polyubiquitination (Ub)
  of itself and TAK1. TAK1 forms a complex with the regulatory subunits TAB1, TAB2,
  and TAB3, which interact with polyubiquitin chains generated by TRAF6 to mediate
  TAK1 activation. Together this complex phosphorylates the canonical IKK complex,
  consisting of IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory subunits NEMO, leading to phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation of IκB. This ultimately results in the NF-κB (p65/p50)
  translocation into the nucleus, and the subsequent transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines. MyD88 dependent pathways can lead to the production of type I IFNs, as
  shown by TLR7 and TLR9 in the endosomal compartment, which requires recruitment
  of TRAF3 and IKKα to the MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6 complex and subsequent phosphorylation
  of IRF7 by IRAK1 and IKKα. TLR engagement also induces TRIF activation following
  TRAF6 and TRAF3 recruitment. TRAF6 recruits RIP1, which activates the TAK1 complex
  and IKK complex, leading to MAPK, NF-κB, and inflammatory cytokines activation.
  TRADD is involved in RIP-1 activation. Additionally, Pellino 1 binds to RIP1 to
  mediate the activation of IKK. TBK1 and IKK complex formation results in the activation
  and translocation of IRF3 and IRF7 to nucleus, resulting in transcription of type
  I IFNs. ‘P’ indicates phosphorylation. CMV: Cytomegalovirus; HCV: Hepatitis C virus;
