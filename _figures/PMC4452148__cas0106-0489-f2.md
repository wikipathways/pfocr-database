caption: Notch signaling pathway. In mammals, four Notch family members, Notch1–4,
  are known. Ligands for Notch receptors are Jagged1 and 2, and Delta1, 3, and 4.
  Because Jagged and Delta ligands are membrane proteins, direct cell-to-cell interaction
  is required for activation of the Notch signaling pathway. (a) Without ligands,
  Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) and silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid
  hormone receptor (SMRT) bind with the transcription factor complex CSL (C promotor
  binding factor (CBF)/Su(H)/Lag1), recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC), and suppress
  transcription of target genes. Numb inhibits nuclear transport of Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). (b) When ligands bind to Notch receptors, the ligand/Notch extra
  cellular domain (NECD) is incorporated by endocytosis of ligand-producing cells.
  The NICD is cut by γ-secretase and is transported to the nucleus. It forms a complex
  with CSL/MAML (mastermind-like), recruits histone acetyltransferase (HAT), and activates
  transcription of target genes.
