caption: Overview of effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the muscle and bone. The SARS-CoV-2
  infection elicits systemic inflammation (Cytokine storm), which activates the tryptophan-kynurenine
  pathway. Kynurenine is broken down into several downstream metabolites, which further
  activates AhR signaling, affecting the integrity and structure of the musculoskeletal
  system. (Figure is created by using http://BioRinder.com.)
