caption: Transcriptome and metabolic flux analyses in the central carbon metabolism
  in ST687 and ST1 (non-producer) strains. The differentially expressed genes in ST687
  compared with ST1 are highlighted with color. All the fluxes were normalized to
  the glucose uptake flux (set as 1). The values in the first and second lines correspond
  to the flux distributions in ST687 and ST1 strains, respectively. Black numbers
  are fluxes calculated from 13C analysis and grey numbers are predicted fluxes from
  the genome-scale model. glc glucose, g6p glucose-6-phosphate, 6pgl d-6-phospho-glucono-δ-lactone,
