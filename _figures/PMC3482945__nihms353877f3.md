caption: In the upper panels, a graphical depiction of relationships within and across
  conditions for a small pathway related to prostate cancer identified by a recent
  paper () is shown. The two networks in (a) and (b) show biweight midcorrelations
  observed among these genes within this pathway in noncancerous and cancerous subjects,
  respectively, using the Monzon data. In the lower panels, relationships within and
  across conditions for a network of 12 genes greedily built up from a seed of PARM1
  are shown, based on meta-analysis posterior probabilities of DC (but again illustrated
  using the Monzon data for (c) noncancerous and (d) cancerous subjects). In both
  sets of panels, deepness of color indicates strength of correlation, where correlations
  of magnitude 0.5 or greater receive the deepest hue; see the color bar. These figures
  appear in color in the electronic version of this article.
