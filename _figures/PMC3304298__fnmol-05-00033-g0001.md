caption: The AKT signaling pathway. AKT is activated by PI3K, which itself is activated
  by several upstream signaling pathways such as insulin receptors, receptor tyrosine
  kinases, G protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, etc. After activation,
  it targets several downstream molecules and change their activity by phosphorylation
  or complex formation. AKT is involved in cell proliferation, glucose metabolism,
  cell survival, cell cycle, protein synthesis, and in neuronal morphology and plasticity
  by regulation of several downstream molecules shown in this figure. AKT is involved
  in cell proliferation through interaction with a number of proteins involved in
  cell cycle, including Cyclin D1, p21Cip, p27Kip, Myt1, and Wee1. AKT also plays
  a crucial role in cell survival through interaction with Bad, MDM2 and the subsequent
  regulation of p53, FoxO1, Bcl-2, and Bax. AKT regulates glucose metabolism through
  regulation of GSK-3, PFKFB2, PIP5K, and AS160. It could also affect protein synthesis
  through interaction with S6 kinase, TSC1, and mTOR signaling. In more recent years,
  AKT's role in neurodegeneration was uncovered, mediated through phosphorylation
  of Huntingtin and Ataxin-1. AKT also has a role in synaptic plasticity, by phosphorylation
  of GABAA receptor. Pathway diagram reproduced courtesy of Cell Signaling Technology,
