caption: Mechanical cue-dependent scarring. a TGF-β activates fibroblasts to transform
  into myofibroblasts and the latter give rise to α-SMA, endowing wound aberrant contraction
  force. b Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in inflammatory environment causes
  fibrosis related gene expression through diverse pathways. RAS-responsive element
  binding protein 1 (RREB1) serves as a connector between MAPK and Smad pathways.
  c Inflammatory factors leak from damaged vascular endothelium; imbalance between
  growth and regression of neovascularization causes irregular vessel cluster; blood
  flow in irregular vessel produces aberrant shear stress. d Nerve damage within wound
  launches neurogenic inflammation where neuropeptides [calcitonin gene-related peptide
  (CGRP) and substance P] from nerve endings mediate harmful vascular events including
  abnormal vasodilation and plasm extravasation. e Neutrophiles and macrophages, as
  the main innate immunocytes within wound, upregulate inflammatory factors and provide
  fibroblasts with enduring activating signals. Created with BioRender.com. TGF-β
