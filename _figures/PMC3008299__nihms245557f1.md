caption: AA is released from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme
  and metabolized by COX-1 or COX-2 into PGH2 which is further converted to prostaglandins
  and thromboxanes by specific terminal synthases. AA can also be metabolized to leukotrienes
  through lipooxygenases, and to epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) and dihydroxyacids
  through cytochrome p450 epoxidase. The cyclopentenones PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 are non-enzymatic
  degradation products of PGD2.
