caption: The effect of autophagy on T cell function. (A) The difference in metabolic
  function between normal CD4+ T cells and autophagy-deficient CD4+ T cells. Autophagy
  deficiency in CD4+ T cells is marked by enlarged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due
  to the accumulation of misfolded protein. The increment of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) by autophagy deficiency causes damaged mitochondria, resulting in increased
  apoptosis. (B) The increased apoptotic pathway in autophagy-deficient CD4+ T cells.
  (C) The difference in CD4+ T cell development between normal CD4+ T cells and autophagy-deficient
  CD4+ T cells. Autophagy deficiency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in bone marrow
  (BM) causes reduced cellularity of BM, resulting in BM failure. Autophagy deficiency
  in the thymus causes abnormal double-negative (DN)/double-positive (DP) transition,
  resulting in reduced overall cellularity in the thymus. Autophagy deficiency in
  peripheral organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes is marked by reduced peripheral
  cellularity. (D) The abnormal cell cycle and reduced intracellular calcium signaling
  in autophagy-deficient CD4+ T cells.
