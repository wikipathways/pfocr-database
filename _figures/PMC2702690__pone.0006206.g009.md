caption: (A) Under hypoxia, brain tumor cells undergo HIF-1α stabilization, due to
  PHD2 degradation probably mediated by FKBP38. Consequentially, HIF-1α dependent
  transcriptional control occurs, with inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling probably through
  REDD1 and TSC1/2. Moreover, HIF-1α inhibits SMAD1/5/8 activation . Under hypoxia
  tumor cells remain in an undifferentiated cell state . (B) Raise of extracellular/intracellular
  oxygen tension and/or exogenous BMP2, or silencing of HIF-1α, besides activating
  BMP signaling , promote activation of Akt/mTOR pathway. Consequentially mTOR induces
  activation of its downstream targets, such as Stat3 (pro-survival, glial differentiation)
  and p70S6K (pro-translational responses). Under these conditions, HIF-1α, which
  is also controlled by mTOR at the transcriptional and translational level, is down-regulated
  especially in the long term . We showed that HIF-1α degradation is also related
  to BMP2 dependent increase of SDH activity, this leading to intracellular succinate
  level decrease and consequential PHD2 activation, in accordance with previous report
  . We hypothesize that BMP signaling, either independent or dependent on SMAD1/5/8
  activation, may also down-regulate FKBP38, thus impeding PHD2 proteasomal degradation
  and consequentially stabilizing PHD2 protein. Moreover, BMP2 dependent FKBP38 downregulation
  correlates also to activation of mTOR signaling, as FKBP38 is known to be a mTORC1
  inhibitor .
