caption: Medicinal plants and bioactive compounds that activate autophagy. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway
  is a negative modulator of the Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK-1) complex. Activation
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and ULK-1 complex is required for initiation.
  Light chain 3-I (LC3-I) is cleaved to light chain3-II (LC3-II) to drive the elongation
  phase. This is followed by maturation to form the autophagosomes. Phosphatase and
  tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative modulator of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and
  microRNA-21 (miR-21) inhibits PTEN. Ursolic acid activates autophagy through inhibition
  of miR-21, thus allowing PTEN to inhibit PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, leading to activation
  of the ULK-1 complex. In addition, ursolic acid activates the PI3K complex. Therefore,
  ursolic acid is involved in the initiation phase of autophagy. Astragalus mongholicus
  and genistein inhibit mTOR, leading to activation of ULK-1. Ursolic acid and Vinga
  angularis drive the formation of LC3-II and the elongation phase.
