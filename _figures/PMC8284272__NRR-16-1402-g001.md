caption: 'Processing of APP by α- and β-secretases.The APP holoprotein is sequentially
  cleaved in either the amyloidogenic or nonamyloidogenic pathways. The former is
  mediated by the β-secretase and results in the generation of extracellular sAPPβ
  and CTFβ. The latter is then cleaved by the γ-secretase complex to yield AICD and
  Aβ species. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the α-secretase cleaves APP, resulting
  in the formation of extracellular sAPPα and CTFα. Subsequent γ-secretase cleavage
  of CTFα releases AICD and p3. Aβ: Amyloid beta; AICD: amyloid precursor protein
  intracellular domain; APP: amyloid precursor protein; CTFα: C-terminal fragment
  α; sAPPα: soluble amyloid precursor protein α.'
