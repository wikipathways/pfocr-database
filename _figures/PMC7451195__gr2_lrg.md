caption: A comprehensive overview of SARS-CoV-2-induced endothelial injury and thrombotic
  complications. SARS-CoV2 infects a number of cell types, including type II alveolar
  cells, macrophages, T cells and endothelial cells, leading to hyperinflammation,
  hypoxia, apoptosis and imbalance of renin-angiotensin system. High levels of proinflammatory
  cytokines/chemokines can directly induce endothelial leak, cause cell apoptosis
  or also promote systemic inflammation and thrombosis. High levels of Ang-II switch
  endothelium to a proinflammatory and procoagulant phenotype. The ARDS- induced hypoxia
  can cause endothelial dysfunction by mitochondrial ROS generation, intracellular
  acidosis, cell signalling pathway activation, and can increase blood viscosity.
  Together, a dysregulated immune response, hypercytokinemia, imbalance of RAS, complement
  activation and hypoxemia induce an exacerbated endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis.
