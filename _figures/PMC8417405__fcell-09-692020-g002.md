caption: 'The interplay among “aging” pathways that have been a major focus of aging
  research over the last decades: IGF1/AKT/FOXO3 growth signaling, TP53/P21/P16 apoptosis
  and senescence, and mTOR/S6K autophagy and survival pathways. This Figure illustrates
  the complexity of the interactions between these pathways regulating cell responses
  to stress and damage, which may in turn impact tissue resilience, and, ultimately,
  influence organismal survival and lifespan. This Figure was prepared using MetaCore
  Pathway Map Creator (PMC) tool () from Clarivate Analytics. The PMC allows to connect
  gene products selected by the user in a picture showing the molecular interactions
  occurring between members of respective cellular processes and pathways. The latter
  are defined, annotated, and manually curated by Clarivate Analytics scientists based
  on the up-to-date literature and pathway libraries. Main protein classes shown on  are
  annotated in .'
