caption: Impact of the FSGD on the melanocyte/-phore signaling network. Many                             components
  have been identified by pigmentation mutants in both, mammals                             and
  teleosts. Diverse external signals are integrated on the promoter of                             the
  Mitf transcription factor gene, the master                             regulator
  of melanophore development (; ). Mitf regulates the expression                             of
  melanogenic enzymes, which catalyze the biosynthesis of melanin from                             tyrosine
  in melanosomes. The αMSH peptide is encoded by the                                 Pomc
  gene. Lef1 is a downstream target of the Wnt                             signaling
  pathway. Red indicates duplications as result of the FSGD                             present
  in all five teleost genomes analyzed and gray indicates                             singleton
  genes. Molecules with divided red/gray shading indicate genes                             retained
  in duplicate in some teleost lineages but singleton in others                             (see
  ). Most of the key                             regulators of the melanophore signaling
  network have been retained in                             two copies in teleosts.
