caption: The metabolic fluxes as calculated in a computer simulation. The values are
  averages between fluxes obtained in two simulations. Numbers in boldface type are
  fluxes for the glucose cultivation, and numbers in italics are fluxes for the glucose-glycerol
  cultivation. All fluxes are given in mmol · g (dry weight)−1 · h−1. The numbers
  in circles show exchange coefficients for reversible reactions, calculated as MIN
  (v_forward, v_reverse)/100 + MIN (v_forward, v_reverse), where v_forward is the
  forward flux, and v_reverse is reverse flux. The function MIN (v_forward, v_reverse)
  gives the smaller flux (forward or reverse) as the result.
