caption: Indirect antiviral activities of PARPs through immunomodulation. PARP1 and
  PARP11-induced MARylation of the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP),
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1) ubiquitination
  and degradation (1). Concerning RNA virus sensing pathways, PARP13 overexpression
  enhances oligomerization of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (2), which leads
  to robust activation of downstream antiviral signaling through the interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) pathway. On the other hand, PARPs can also downregulate the antiviral
  defenses. PARP7 MARylates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), decreasing IRF3 activation
  and leading to impaired IFN production (3). Otherwise, PARP12 enhances the signaling
  cascade, leading to NF-κB activation, whereas PARP10 exerts negative feedback on
  this pathway through MARylation of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) (4). PARP13
  mediates the degradation of several host IFN mRNAs (5), thereby acting as a negative
  feedback regulator of the interferon response. The PARP9–DTX3L complex is a direct
  binding partner of STAT-1, promoting STAT-1 phosphorylation and nuclear relocalization,
  thereby increasing ISG transcription and leading to amplification of the innate
  immune response (6). PARP14 specifically binds to STAT-6 responsive promoters (7),
  preventing STAT-6-mediated transcription. The inflammatory environment influences
  PARP9–DTX3L and PARP14 immunomodulatory properties. In the presence of the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-4 (8), PARP14 carries out its own MARylation by an autocatalytic process
  that allows binding of STAT-6 and transcription activation. PARP9–DTX3L potentiates
  the response to IFN-γ by enhancing phosphorylation of STAT-1, whereas PARP14, by
  ADP-ribosylating STAT1, decreases the response while increasing phosphorylation
  of STAT-6, thereby promoting the anti-inflammatory response mediated by IL-4. PARP9–DTX3L
  can in turn inhibit MARylation of STAT-1 by PARP14.
