caption: A proposed model showing that apigenin promotes pigmentation through the
  c-KIT/Raf-1/MAPK/CREB signaling pathway. Apigenin activates the c-KIT receptor,
  leading to phosphorylation of Raf-1. Once activated, Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates
  MAPK, resulting in CREB phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of
  CRTCs. Phosphorylated CREB, in association with CRTCs, promotes MITF transcription,
  which in turn induces the expression of Tyrosinase, Rab27a, and Cdc42. This cascade
  of events drives melanosome maturation and transport. Tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2
  are key regulators of melanosome maturation. Cdc42 facilitates dendrite extension
  and filopodia formation, while Rab27a interacts with its effectors, Mlph and Myosin
  Va, to regulate actin-dependent melanosome transport and anchoring to the plasma
  membrane. c-KIT, cellular-KIT; Raf-1, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-1; MAPK,
