caption: Proposed mechanism of the regulation of embryonic diapause in the roe deer.
  Endometrial E2 signaling is inhibited during embryonic diapause. The increase in
  the rate of proliferation in the embryo coincides with a decrease in microRNA let-7–driven
  gene expression in the embryos and a simultaneous increase in mTORC1 signaling.
  The increase in mTORC1 signaling is related to an increased expression of genes
  involved in the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle, and one
  carbon metabolism.
