caption: Scheme of the proposed functional link between the respiratory chain capacities
  (KCN-sensitive and AOX-dependent) and the skoto-morphogenic programme. In mitochondria,
  the KCN-sensitive transport of electrons (ETC) from NADH is used for O2 reduction
  and ATP production. Only a limited fraction of electrons is diverted to the AOX
  enzyme for reduction of O2 without concomitant ATP production. In etiolated rpoTmp,
  rug3, atphb3 or KCN-treated WT plants, the KCN-sensitive electron flux is strongly
  decreased, inducing a strong dysfunctional stress (indicated in red). This stress
  activates the canonical (ANAC017-dependent) mitochondrial retrograde pathway which
  activates AOX1a expression. It may be supported by yet unknown factors (represented
  by a yellow oval with question mark). Additional AOX regulation by dysfunctional
  stress at the level of protein accumulation and modification might be possible (thick
  black arrow). As ultimate effect the capacity of the AOX-dependent chain is upregulated
  and more electrons can be diverted by this pathway, releasing the stress (indicated
  in green). The dysfunctional stress in combination with the highly increased AOX
  capacity, however, sends a signal via an unknown transmitter (represented by a grey
  circle with question mark) that triggers the formation of the triple-like response
  (or parts of it). (Online version in colour.)

  description: Scheme of the proposed functional link between the respiratory chain
