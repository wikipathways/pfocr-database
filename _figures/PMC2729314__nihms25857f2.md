caption: Schematic diagram of the Wnt signaling network. Highlighted are key components
  identified in the (A) Wnt/β-catenin and the (B) Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathways. When
  the so-called “canonical” or Wnt/β-catenin path is inactive, a degradation complex,
  including Axin, GSK-3, and APC, phosphorylates β-catenin inducing its rapid destruction
  by the proteasome. Once the Frizzled(Fz)/LRP co-receptor complex is bound by Wnt,
  Fz interacts with Dsh, which modifies the destruction complex and leads to β-catenin
  stabilization. Nuclear β-catenin interacts with LEF/TCF to promote the transcription
  of Wnt target genes. The so-called “non-canonical” Wnts are thus named as they appear
  to act independently of β-catenin. Wnt binding to Fz leads to activation of Dsh,
  an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKC. Increased intracellular
  Ca2+ can then lead to a secondary activation of PKC as well as to activation of
  CaMKII and NFAT. Increased intracellular Ca2+ and activated calcium sensors have
  been shown to antagonize β-catenin, noted as red bars. The PCP pathway also signals
  through Fz and Dsh which then signals through small GTPases (Rho) and C-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) to modulate cytoskeletal elements. The PCP pathway utilizes core components,
  shown are stbm and pk. Fz, Dsh and pk are all capable of activating Ca2+ release.
