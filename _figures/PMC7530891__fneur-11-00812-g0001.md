caption: 'Possible mechanisms of remote ischemic preconditioning. The protective signals
  generated from the remote organ(s) are transmitted to the brain possibly through
  three pathways: neuronal (pink shading), humoral (purple shading), and immunological
  pathway (green shading). After being transmitted to the brain through the above
  three pathways, these signals induce autophagy activation and functional changes
  in the mitochondria, which is called a common signaling pathway.'
