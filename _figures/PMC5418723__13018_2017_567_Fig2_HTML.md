caption: ReactomeFI analysis of iTRAQ data from serum samples. a Workflow pathway
  enrichment analysis iTRAQ data. All proteins quantified in the iTRAQ experiment,
  regardless of the disease state, were uploaded in cytoscape via ReactomeFI application.
  Genes were clustered based on pathway and sub-network annotations. A pathway enrichment
  analysis indicated that 90 pathways were enriched within the proteomic space of
  serum samples. b Reactome analysis serum samples. Proteins were clustered using
  ReactomeFI, and 13 major modules were identified. A pathway enrichment analysis
  was completed for each module using an FDR >0.01
