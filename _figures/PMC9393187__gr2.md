caption: 'A generalized mechanistic overview of candidate vaccines: (A) represents
  inactivated vaccines that uses whole virion of SARS-coV-2 as immunogen (S-protein),
  directly contacting with ribosomal units for protein (HA) translation; (B) shows
  m-RNA based vaccines, encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle, and after injecting, the
  lipid-nanoparticle remains outside of the plasma membrane of human cell and m-RNA
  penetrates the plasma membrane to cytoplasm and then to ribosomal subunits for protein
  translation (antigen); (C) is a viral vector vaccine or vector-based vaccine different
  from A and B, and is a DNA based vaccine that used adeno-virus as vector and post
  injection, the DNA penetrates plasma membrane following contact with cell nucleus,
  however, without integrating with DNA, converting to m-RNA via enzyme (RNA polymerase),
  and transported to cytoplasm for protein synthesis. The immune response generated
  by vaccines: MHC genes expressed to produce surface antigens – e.g., MHC-II expresses
  on antigen presenting cells to activate TH, and linked through TCRs and cluster
  of differentiation-4 (CD4) T cells will be activated and release cytokines further
  activate B-cells to proliferate and differentiate to form plasma cells that result
  antibodies, directing against S-proteins and start neutralization. Similarly, MHC-I
  protein present endogenous antigens after neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 the cell
  will destroy. Infected cell by activating Tc cells via CD8 cells create pores in
  the infected cells via proteins called “perforins.” FAO represents fatty acid oxidation
  pathway; it aids modulating macrophage''s inflammatory function, and crucially controls
  the innate and adaptive immune systems. AA reveals amino acid pathway; a signaling
  pathway triggering inflammatory responses via TH cell by secreting cytokines. Pentose
  pathway; signaling pathway support LPS-induced cytokines secretion which then help
  in B-cell activation and proliferation.'
