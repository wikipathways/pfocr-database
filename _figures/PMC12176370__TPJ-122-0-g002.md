caption: Abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway in plants.ABA is synthesized de
  novo in the plastids from a C40 epoxy carotenoid precursor. The initial intermediates
  originating from glycolysis products, pyruvate, and glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate to
  isopentenyl diphosphate via the Methyl Erythritol Phosphate pathway are not depicted
  here. The C15 intermediate xanthoxin is converted into ABA through a two‐step reaction
  involving ABA‐aldehyde in the cytosol. The enzymes involved in ABA biosynthesis
  are highlighted in green ovals. Created with BioRender.com
