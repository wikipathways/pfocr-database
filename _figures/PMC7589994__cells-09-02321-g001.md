caption: Schematic representation of the role of the best-characterized HDACs in liver
  fibrosis. TGFβR activation induces the phosphorylation of the SMAD2/SMAD3 complex,
  which binds to SMAD4 to translocate to the nucleus and regulates gene expression.
  Cellular responses to TGFβ are modulated in part by HDACs. HDAC2 inhibits the expression
  of SMAD7, a negative regulator of TGFβ signaling. HDAC4 inhibits the expression
  of MMPs genes, and HDAC9 appears to be involved in the expression of α-SMA and COL1A1
  genes. The activation of HSCs can be enhanced by NFκB-mediated signaling, which
  promotes the formation of the HDAC1-p50 complexes. This complex inhibits the expression
  of BAMBI, which is a negative regulator of the TGFβ pathway. On the contrary, SIRT1
  has an antifibrogenic role through the inhibition of the SMAD2/SMAD3/SMAD4 complex
  and the HMT EZH2 via lysine deacetylation.
