caption: This signaling pathway is activated when a growth factor (ligand) binds to
  its respective growth factor receptor. Once activated, the RTK transmits the extracellular
  signal inside the cell via the adaptor protein GRB2. The membrane bound GTPase,
  RAS, then becomes activated by the exchange of GDP for GTP. This is facilitated
  by the nucleotide exchange factor, SOS. Activated RAS then initiates the signaling
  cascade of MAP kinases. Finally, activated ERK can phosphorylate its cytosolic or
  nuclear effectors. The latter results in changes to transcription and ultimately
  cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. GRB2 – growth factor receptor
  bound protein 2; ERK (MAPK) – extracellular-signal related kinase; MEK – MAPK/ERK
  kinase; RAF (MAPKKK) – rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; RAS (MAPKK) – rat sarcoma
  protein; RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase; SOS – sons of sevenless
