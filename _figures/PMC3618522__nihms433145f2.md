caption: 'Under conditions where RARα is functional and the RARβ promoter is not epigenetically
  silenced, physiological levels of RA can activate RARβ expression. A small number
  of solid tumors display this phenotype. Under less ideal conditions in which the
  RARβ promoter is hypoacetylated, pharmacological doses of RA are needed to activate
  RARβ. In the majority of solid tumor types, the RARβ promoter is methylated and/or
  the histones are significantly deacetylated. In this case, treatment with pharmacological
  doses of RA is not sufficient to overcome the repressive effect of epigenetic silencing.
  Epigenetic-modifying drugs such as DNA methytransferases or histone deacetylase
  (HDAC) inhibitors are needed to release the epigenetic stress and activate the RARβ
  gene. NCOR: nuclear receptor co-repressor 1; SMRT silencing mediator for retinoid
