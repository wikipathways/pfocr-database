caption: Biosynthesis of lyso-PAF and PAF via the remodelling pathway. The initial
  hydrolysis of the acyl moiety of alkylacylglycerophosphocholine to form lyso-PAF
  and arachidonic acid (AA) can be catalyzed by the action of a direct phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) or a CoA-independent transacylase (CoA-IT). Lyso-plasmalogen and other
  lyso-glycerophospholipids can act as the acyl acceptor in the CoA-independent transacylase
  type of reaction. The lyso-PAF is then converted to PAF by the acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF
  acetyltransferase. Above, are the names of selective inhibitors used to identify
  the enzymes involved in VEGF-mediated PAF synthesis upon remodelling pathway activation.
  R=(CH2)n-CH3 where n=15 to 17 and R′=(CH2)2N+(CH3)3.
