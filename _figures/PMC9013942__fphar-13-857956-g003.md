caption: The molecular mechanisms of celastrol in liver cancer (edited by Biorender
  software). Celastrol exert anticancer effect by restraining their cell growth, metastasis,
  and inflammatory response, while boosting ER stress, apoptosis, and autophagy depending
  on modulated different signaling pathways. Firstly, celastrol can activate cancer
  cell apoptosis through inhibiting JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation, then downregulated
  BCL-2 family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and upregulated caspase family proteins
  (caspase 3 and caspase 9). Secondly, celastrol repressed tumor cell proliferation
  by suppressing cyclin D1 and c-myc through E2F1 and STAT3; Lastly, celastrol prohibited
  tumor metastasis by NF-κB signaling pathway modulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the
  CXCR4-related signaling pathway, as well as the ROCK2-mediated phosphorylation of
  ezrin at Thr567. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; JAK1, Janus kinase1; JAK2, Janus kinase2;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2;

  kappa B; MMP2, Matrix metallopeptidase 2; MMP9, Matrix metallopeptidase 9; circ_SLIT3,
