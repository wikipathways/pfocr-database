caption: Annotation of the insulin/TOR network in Apis showing methylated and differentially
  methylated genes. In those cases in which more than one paralog has been found only
  one is referred to by the consensus protein name, with the others designated by
  the GB numbers from the official honey bee gene list (www.beebase.org). The nutrient-independent
  activation of the PI3K pathway by ALK is highlighted in pink. Gene annotation is
  shown in Table S3.
