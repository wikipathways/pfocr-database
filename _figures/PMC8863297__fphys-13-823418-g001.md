caption: The ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway and Halloween enzymes. As the conversion
  steps between 7-dehydrocholesterol and 5β-ketodiol have not been chemically characterized,
  they are collectively called the “Black Box.” Notably, spo and spok are paralogous
  to each other (; ). Although genetic and physiological analyses have suggested that
  Nobo plays a role in cholesterol intake or trafficking in the PG, endogenous substrates
  of Nobo have not been identified. Therefore, the role of Nobo is indicated by the
  dashed arrow in this illustration.
