caption: A thick arrow toward hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 encoded by SPI1
  gene is a novel pathway reported in this study. Signaling from ABL1 to STAT5A, STAT5B,
  or STAT3 (dotted arrow) leading to SOCS3 and PU.1 expression is suggested by this
  study but its generalization in leukemic patients requires further validation. A
  negative feedback loop from JAK2 to STAT proteins and to SOCS3, which inhibits JAK2,
  was previously established. Enhanced expression of PU.1 may be involved in MPN development
  via its transcriptional control of genes regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation.
