caption: Enhanced high-level diagram (EHLD) for signaling by interleukins. EHLDs use
  familiar and consistent graphic elements that identify the regions of the graphic
  that are links to subpathways, which represent full molecular details. In this example
  interleukins are represented as circles, and interleukin receptors or families are
  represented as pairs or trios of rods with cupped ends. Further icons provide a
  minimal and generalized representation of signaling. The EHLD design incorporates
  labels as part of the selectable region for users who are not able to interpret
  the iconography. The figure has been copied under CC-BY with permission from Reactome.
  An interactive version with links to detailed subpathway representations is accessible

  description: Enhanced high-level diagram (EHLD) for signaling by interleukins. EHLDs
    use familiar and consistent graphic elements that identify the regions of the
    graphic that are links to subpathways, which represent full molecular details.
    In this example interleukins are represented as circles, and interleukin receptors
    or families are represented as pairs or trios of rods with cupped ends. Further
    icons provide a minimal and generalized representation of signaling. The EHLD
    design incorporates labels as part of the selectable region for users who are
    not able to interpret the iconography. The figure has been copied under CC-BY
