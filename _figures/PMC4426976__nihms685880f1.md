caption: The WNT–β-catenin signalling cascade has crucial roles in cell fate, proliferation,
  survival and migration. In the absence of extracellular WNT glycoproteins, a destruction
  complex — including the proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK3β) and AXIN — phosphorylates β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitylation
  and proteasomal degradation. The binding of WNTs to Frizzled receptors and the co-receptors
  LRP5 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5) and LRP6 relays a signal
  through Dishevelled (DVL), which results in inhibition of the destruction complex
  and nuclear entry of β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a bridge between
  members of the T cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors and the basal
  transcriptional apparatus via co-activators (CREB-binding protein (CBP), E1A-associated
  protein p300, the co-activator Pygopus (PYGO), B cell lymphoma 9 (BCL-9), and so
  on). Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified inhibitors at various
  points along the pathway, a few of which have recently entered clinical trials.
  These are discussed in detail within the main text. CK1α, casein kinase 1α; CRD,
  cysteine-rich domain; MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyltransferase.
