caption: Mechanisms of Poly-SNO-HSA as a safe and strong multiple antitumor agent.
  Fast and pronounced transfer of NO from Poly-SNO-HSA into the cell mainly takes
  place via cell-surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and to a minor extent via
  60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60). Within the cell, a high concentration of NO induces
  apoptosis by the mechanisms mentioned, and perhaps by other means not yet identified.
  NO also reverts dx resistance partly by activating a cGMP dependent pathway. Finally,
  NO reverts drug resistance by decreasing the efflux of the drug. The latter effect
  is brought about by decreasing the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
  and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, Poly-SNO-HSA inhibits hypoxia-induced autophagy
  via downregulation of the cell signaling factors LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1. The
  green and red arrows represent increasing and decreasing effects, respectively.
