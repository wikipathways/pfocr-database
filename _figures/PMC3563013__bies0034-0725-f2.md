caption: Tar1p as a putative suppressor of hypersuppressive mitochondrial transmission
  advantage. Upon activation of the retrograde response pathway, Rtg2p stimulates
  Rtg1/3p-dependent transcription. At the same time, Rtg2p-dependent suppression of
  ERC formation ceases and rDNA pol-II transcription is stimulated. We propose that
  this process upregulates expression of the rDNA/ERC-encoded TAR1 gene. Our model
  is that Tar1p, which is known to be mitochondrially imported, acts to suppress the
  replication or transmission advantage that petite mitochondria (in particular hypersuppressive
  petites) have over wild-type mitochondria.
