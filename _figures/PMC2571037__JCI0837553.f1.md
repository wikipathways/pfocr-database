caption: In healthy cells, mitogenic growth factors signaling through the MAPK pathway
  trigger sequential phosphorylation and activation of MEK and ERK kinases, which
  in turn leads to stabilization of Mcl-1, activation of Bcl-2, and degradation of
  Bim, thereby promoting cell survival. In tumors with B-RAF mutations, B-Raf causes
  pathway activation independent of upstream signaling by either directly activating
  MEK1/2 or activating c-Raf, depending on the B-Raf variant present. In this issue
  of the JCI, Cragg et al. show that MEK inhibitors such as U0126, PD098059, and PD325901
  upregulate Bim but do not induce regressions of tumors harboring B-RAF mutations
  (). The authors also propose that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL neutralize the increased Bim,
  thereby diminishing the potential apoptotic effect of the MEK inhibitors. Consistent
  with this model, the authors show that addition of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737
  enhances the apoptotic effect of MEK inhibition. When Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are antagonized,
  the upregulated Bim binds to Mcl-1, causing it to release Bak and/or Bax, leading
  to cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptosis. Because tumors with B-RAF mutations
  are dependent on the MAPK pathway rather than the Akt pathway for survival, combining
  a MEK inhibitor and a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist appears to be a promising strategy
  for treating these tumors. c-FLIP, cellular FLICE (caspase 8) inhibitory protein;
