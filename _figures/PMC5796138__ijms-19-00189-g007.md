caption: Suppressive behaviors of DIM on E2- or CYP-induced EMT and metastasis of
  Ishikawa cells. CYP was presented by acting as xenoestrogens via acceleration of
  the proliferation of estrogen-responsive Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells. CYP
  also enhanced EMT, migration, and invasion of Ishikawa cells by regulating EMT-related
  genes, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Snail, as well as metastasis-related
  genes, including Cathepsin D and MMP-9 in an ER-dependent manner, as did E2. Conversely,
  DIM was found to significantly suppress E2 and CYP-induced proliferation, EMT, migration,
  and invasion of Ishikawa cancer cells, implying that while CYP has the capacity
  to enhance the metastatic potential of estrogen-responsive endometrial cancer, DIM
  has an anti-estrogenic chemopreventive effect that withdraws the cancer-enhancing
  effect of E2 and CYP (⊥; decrease or inhibit, arrows; increase or promote).
