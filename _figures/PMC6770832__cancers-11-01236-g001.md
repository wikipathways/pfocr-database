caption: A map of potential pathways and their potential interactions activated by
  a soluble factor- radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) signal. While not entirely
  inclusive, this map was constructed to be displayed as a working reference point
  for current and future research. The pathways outlined in the legend have been identified
  as candidates for RIBE-intracellular and extracellular signalling. The following
  , ,  and  are entirely derivative of this one and attempt to more closely showcase
  potential signalling within each pathway. Black lines or “generic pathways” represent
  interactions belonging to the other four pathways that could not be specified in
  this figure for clarity.
