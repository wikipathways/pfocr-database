caption: Targeting immunometabolism in macrophages to prevent graft rejection. Monocytes
  from the circulation enter a transplant and acquire either proinflammatory functions
  (M1) that contribute to graft rejection or immunoregulatory functions (M2) that
  promote graft tolerance. M2 macrophages generate energy mainly through oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glutamine metabolism, while M1 macrophages increase
  metabolic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. HIF-1α
  and Akt increase glycolysis by upregulating the expression of glycolytic enzymes
  and the glucose transporter GLUT1, respectively. The cholesterol pathway intermediate
  mevalonate, which can be blocked using statins, is involved in the epigenetic fixation
  of the proinflammatory phenotype. Itaconate is an anti-inflammatory metabolite whose
  expression is upregulated upon macrophage activation
