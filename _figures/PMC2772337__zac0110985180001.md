caption: Metabolic pathway and mode of action of 5FC in Candida yeasts. 5FC and 5FU
  are transported into the cell by cell membrane-associated cytosine-purine permeases.
  In Candida spp., these are encoded by two genes that display amino acid sequence
  homology with the FCY2 gene of S. cerevisiae (). Upon entry into the cell, 5FC is
  then deaminated to 5FU by Fca1p, encoded by FCA1. 5FU is then phosphorylated by
  UPRT, encoded by FUR1, yielding 5FUMP. 5FUMP inhibits thymidylate synthetase, which
  leads to thymidine depletion in the cell and which ultimately interrupts DNA synthesis.
  5FUMP is also metabolized by two kinases, yielding fluorouridine diphosphate (5FUDP)
  and, subsequently, fluorouridine triphosphate (5FUTP), the latter of which is incorporated
  into RNA in the place of UTP, which leads to miscoding and the inhibition of protein
  synthesis.
