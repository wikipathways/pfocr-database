caption: Schematic diagram of mechanism on this research. H. cordata and 2-undecanone
  could effectively activate the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative
  enzymes HO-1 and NQO-1 and thus to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby
  attenuating DNA damage and inflammation caused by B[a]P stimulation and playing
  a role in the chemoprevention of B[a]P-induced lung carcinogenesis
papertitle: Houttuynia cordata Thunb. and its bioactive compound 2-undecanone significantly
  suppress benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung tumorigenesis by activating the Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1
  signaling pathway.
