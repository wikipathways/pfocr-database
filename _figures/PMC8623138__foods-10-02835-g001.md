caption: General pattern of xanthophylls synthesis in microalgae. The implicated enzymes
  in each step of biochemical conversion are listed in red. Their corresponding genes
  are noted in parentheses. The microalgae Porphyridium sp. (orange border), Tetraselmis
  sp. (green border), Pleurochrysis (brown border) and Haemotococcus sp. (pink border)
  are presented as principal producers of β-carotene, lutein, fucoxanthin and ASX,
  respectively.
