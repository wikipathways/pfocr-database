caption: 'Model of SPTM-Hmyc activity. (a) Wild-type situation of Notch signaling
  pathway: ligands like Delta activate Notch, releasing the intracellular Notch domain
  (ICN). On its way to the nucleus, ICN binds to Su(H) in the cytoplasm. Together
  with other activator molecules, this complex activates the Notch target genes. Outside
  the Notch activation domain (dashed lines), the process is antagonized by Hairless,
  which binds Su(H) in the cytoplasm and transports it in the nucleus, where, together
  with co-repressors, it forms a repressor complex to silence Notch target genes;
  (b) SPTM-Hmyc integrates into membranes (cell membrane and ER and/or Golgi), sequestering
  freely available Su(H). Consequently, less activator and repressor complexes are
  present on the DNA. Since the ratio between activation and repression remains almost
  unchanged, little phenotypic consequences are observed. Yet, a slight downregulation
  of Notch activity indicates reduced availability of Su(H) for recruitment by ICN;
  (c) Overexpression of both, SPTM-Hmyc and Su(H), gives a mixed result: repression
  of Notch targets at places of highest Notch activity, and activation of Notch targets
  elsewhere. The former may reveal insufficient availability of Su(H) due to sequestration
  by SPTM-Hmyc. The latter may result from recruitment of ectopic Su(H) into activator
  complexes by spurious levels of ICN in cells that are normally repressed by H activity;
  (d) Su(H)LLL is deficient for the binding of H, here shown by a defective C-terminal
  domain (brown and clipped, instead of a full orange circle). Ectopic Su(H)LLL hence
  acts independently of SPTM-Hmyc, causing a much higher Notch activation than in
  (c). Note that SPTM-Hmyc is still able to sequester wild-type Su(H), yet affecting
  likewise activator and repressor complexes as in (b).'
