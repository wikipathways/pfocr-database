caption: (A) Heatmap of 23 genes differentially expressed between LMP and HGSOC tumors
  in two independent GEO expression profiles, GSE17308 (9) and GSE9891 (12), organized
  by median fold change. (B) The “cellular movement, cancer, and cellular development”
  network is enriched for genes differentially expressed between LMP and HGSOC, as
  determined by pathway analysis. In both panels, red represents overexpression and
  green represents underexpression in HGSOC. Genes highlighted in orange are well-known
  ovarian cancer genes that have been used as biomarkers and targets for drug design.
