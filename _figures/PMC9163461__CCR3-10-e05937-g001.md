caption: Pathway of heme biosynthesis. The eight steps of heme synthesis are shown
  below, and each number represents the enzyme that catalyzes each step. Defects in
  steps 2, 3, 6, and 7 cause acute porphyria; step 2 representing ALA dehydratase
  and its deficiency of ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, step 3 representing
  porphobilinogen deaminase and its deficiency of acute intermittent porphyria, step
  6 representing coproporphyrinogen oxidase and its deficiency of hereditary coproporphyria,
  and step 7 representing protoporphyrinogen oxidase and its deficiency of variegate
  porphyria. This figure is created with BioRender.com
