caption: Foods that we consume are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. Thousands
  of microbiotas in the gut participate in metabolism, breaking down the dietary substrates.
  (a) The metabolism of some important carbohydrates. Monosaccharide fructose can
  be directly absorbed in the intestinal tract. If it is ingested in the form of sucrose,
  it is hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose under the action of sucrase and then
  absorbed. Xylooligosaccharides are degraded into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
  as substrate of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract. Fructooligosaccharides
  (including inulin) are metabolized in the cecum by the intestinal microbiota to
  hydrogen, short-chain carboxylic acid, carbon dioxide, L-lactic acid, and other
  metabolites. Starch is hydrolyzed to glucose by amylase and then absorbed. Resistant
  starch is not digestible and is used by microorganisms in the colon. Cellulose cannot
  be digested. (b) In kynurenine pathway, tryptophan turns to kynurenine. Kynurenine
  will be catabolized to kynurenic acid by kynurenine amino-transferases, and to 3-hydroxykynurenine
  by kynurenine monooxygenase. 3-hydroxykynurenine will be catabolized to 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid, picolinic acid and quinolinic acid through a series of metabolic processes.
  In addition, tryptophan will be catabolized to serotonin, indole, and the other
  metabolites. At present, the known pathway that is mediated by gut microbiota is
  that phenylalanine converts into phenylpyruvic acid and phenylacetic acid, while
  tyrosine metabolites to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid
  and finally p-cresol []. (c) Lipids are classified into cholesterol, linoleic acid
  and choline. Cholesterol is metabolized to bile acids by gut microbiota and linoleic
  acid is converted into conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Choline becomes trimethylamine
  (TMA) firstly and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the further step.
