caption: Working model for the PEX5L-PEX7-mediated import pathway. After its assembly
  in the cytosol, the trimeric PEX5L-PEX7-PTS2 protein complex docks at the docking/translocation
  machinery (DTM) (arrow 1). This receptor-cargo complex then becomes inserted into
  the DTM (arrow 2). This step culminates with the PTS2 cargo protein being delivered
  to the organelle matrix (where the PTS2 is cleaved) and PEX5L displaying a transmembrane
  topology (i.e., stage 2 PEX5L). At this stage, PEX7 is completely protected from
  exogenous proteases, exposing at least its N terminus to the peroxisome matrix.
  PEX7 may be completely released from the DTM into the matrix milieu (pathway A)
  or may be retained at the DTM until the export step (pathway B). Following insertion
  into the DTM, PEX5L is monoubiquitinated at the conserved cysteine 11 residue (arrow
  3), yielding stage 3 PEX5L. Monoubiquitination of PEX5L allows its ATP-dependent
  extraction from the DTM (arrow 4) and the subsequent export of PEX7 (arrow 5). After
  deubiquitination of PEX5L (arrow 6), the protein transport cycle restarts.
