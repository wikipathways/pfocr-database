caption: Broad targeting of E1, E2 and proteasome are possible, but targeting the
  E3 enzymes offers specificity. Here the E3 ligase is represented by the SCFSKp2,
  an E3 that has multiple regions on which small molecules have been designed. Also
  of interest are DUB inhibitors.DUB: Deubiquitination enzyme.
