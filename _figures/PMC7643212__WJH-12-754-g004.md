caption: 'Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 pathways involved in
  T cell survival. Scheme of T cell survival pathways. Interleukin (IL)-7/IL-7 receptor
  (CD127) increases the level of the anti-apoptotic molecule myeloid leukemia cell
  differentiation protein (Mcl-1) via signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5. After T cell receptor activation, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated
  factor 1 (TRAF1) level is upregulated via nuclear factor-kappa B. TRAF1 is the signal
  transducer of the positive checkpoint TNFR superfamily member 9 (4-1BB). 4-1BB stimulation
  downregulates Bim via extracellular signal-related kinase. IL-7 induces TRAF1 expression,
  increasing its anti-apoptotic effect by improving 4-1BB signaling. Together, 4-1BB
  and CD127 balance Bim and Mcl-1. HCV: Hepatitis C virus; 4-1BB: Tumor necrosis family
  receptor superfamily member 9; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TRAF1:
  Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1; Mcl-1: Myeloid leukemia cell
  differentiation protein; IL: Interleukin; NF-Κb: Nuclear factor kappa B; MHC: Major
  histocompatibility complex; TCR: T cell receptor.'
