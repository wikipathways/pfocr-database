caption: Mechanism of diosgenin and its analogs in lipid metabolism. Diosgenin and
  its analogs can affect plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and fatty acid levels by
  inhibiting SREBPs and its downstream proteins related to lipid metabolism via regulation
  of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, Akt/FoxO signaling pathway, LXR signaling pathway
  and inhibiting lipid metabolism enzymes (LPL, PL, HL). In addition, PPAR signaling
  pathway and PGC1α/ ERα signaling pathway also play important roles in plasma lipid
  metabolism. Diosgenin and its analogs can also inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis
  by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and increase HDL by improving LCAT. Among these
  analogs, tomatidine can inhibit cholesterol esterification by inhibiting ACAT, thereby
  reducing serum LDL and cholesterol esters. During local plaque cholesterol metabolism,
  diosgenin and its analogs also inhibit foam cell formation by inhibiting Notch signaling
  pathway and inhibit cholesterol intake by regulating scavenger receptors (SR-A,
  CD36 and LOX-1) via inhibition of p38 MAPK and promote cholesterol efflux mediated
  by ABCA1 via inhibition of the expression of miR-19/miR-33a/b. Diosgenin and its
  analogs can also promote the excretion of liver cholesterol, inhibit the absorption
  of intestinal cholesterol by promoting the expression of ABCG 5/8 and inhibiting
  the expression of NPC1L1 in the liver and intestine. In addition, diosgenin can
  promote the CES-1/SRB1/ CYP7A1/ FXR signaling pathway in the liver, which promote
  the transformation of cholesterol into bile acids and excretion from feces, and
  can also decrease CES-1, SRB1 and FXR in the intestine, which inhibits cholesterol
  absorption. At the same time, MPD and PD promote the up-regulation of LDLR and the
  transport of circulating cholesterol to the liver by inhibiting PCSK9.
