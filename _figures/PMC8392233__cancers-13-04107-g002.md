caption: Signaling pathways activated by CB1 and CB2 receptors in prostate cancer
  cells. The coupling of Gi/o protein heteromers (αβγ subunits) reduce intracellular
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by inhibiting adenyl cyclase activity.
  Downregulated protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses PKA mediated signaling events. On
  dissociation of the α and βγ subunits, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein
  kinase B are stimulated, which further induces the phosphorylation of mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK). The CB1 receptor can switch G-protein coupling of Gi/o to
  Gs and Gq and activate several MAPKs such as ERK1/2, p38 and JNK under certain circumstances.
  CB1 also transduces non-G protein pathway signaling by activating β-arrestins. CB1-mediated
  signaling is dependent on the ligand and the sub-cellular environment. Arrows indicate
  stimulation/activation and blunted red arrows indicate inhibition.
