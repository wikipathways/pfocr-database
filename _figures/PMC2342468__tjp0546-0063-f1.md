caption: All NOS isoforms (eNOS, nNOS, iNOS and mtNOS) within specific subcellular
  compartments of the cardiomyocyte (e.g. sarcolemmal caveolae, SR-T-tubule junction,
  sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria) are represented, as well as associated regulatory
  proteins. The net effect of eNOS-derived NO on contractility depends on the specific
  stimulus (e.g. agonists on β3-adrenoceptor and muscarinic M2 receptor, or stretch),
  the subcellular compartment (cytosolic or subsarcolemmal) involved and the subsequent
  amount of NO produced as well as the oxidative status of the cell. On one hand,
  NO exerts anti-adrenergic inotropic effects after β3-adrenoceptor-dependent activation
  of eNOS and through cytosolic (and mostly cGMP-dependent) modulation of the main
  targets of the classical β-adrenergic cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, i.e.
  (1) the voltage-operated L-type Ca2+ channel (VOC); (2) the ryanodine receptor Ca2+-release
  channel type 2 (RyR2); (3) phospholamban (PLN; involved in regulation of sarcoendoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)); (4) the troponin I (TnI) limiting the sensitivity
  of troponin C (TnC) to Ca2+. On the other hand, eNOS-derived NO may exert positive
  inotropic effects, e.g. (1) after sarcolemmal stretch, through subsarcolemmal activation
  of protein kinase B (PKB), eNOS and probably direct nitrosylation of RyR2 by NO;
  (2) direct nitrosylation of VOC; (3) direct activation of adenylate cyclase (AC);
  (4) increase of cAMP after phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibition; (5) activation
  of RyR2 through protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent ADP ribosyl cyclase phosphorylation.
