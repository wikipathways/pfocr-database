caption: 'Proposed mechanism of selenium nanoparticles mediated growth and fatty acid
  improvement in sesame: (1, 2) glycerol 6 phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate are transported
  to plastids by GPT and PPT transporters, embedded in the membrane, while selenium
  showed lowered MDA content in our results, hence with higher membrane stability
  and improved functioning of transporters, resulting in high content of raw material
  for oil biosynthesis. (3) Acetyl CoA carboxylase (catalyze rate-limiting step in
  oil biosynthesis) sulfur-dependent enzyme, its activity is enhanced when S is replaced
  with Se; in case of higher selenium content, sulfur is replaced with selenium, which
  exerts higher kinase activity of ACC enzyme, hence enhancing oil biosynthesis. (4)
  Selenium nanoparticles result in an improved photosynthetic pigment content (also
  shown I pour results) along with antioxidant role, thus preventing the oxidative
  damage to the photosynthetic machinery. Sugar and food provide raw material for
  oil biosynthesis; hence, SeNPs improve photosynthetic activity with higher photosynthetic
  product, which eventually feed for oil biosynthetic pathway. (5) Glycerol-3-phosphate
  (G-3-P) and acetyl-CoA produced by glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are the raw materials
  for FA biosynthesis and TAG assembly, indicating that carbohydrate metabolism may
  have important implications for the improvement of oil content in plants. (6) As
  SeNPs have also been reported to have an upregulation of enzymatic antioxidant defense
  system and hormone concentration resulting in overall growth and oil yield improvement'
