caption: Proposed model in which gal-3 mediates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the BMM-induced
  drug resistance of AL. hBM-MSCs induce gal-3 expression in ALCs. Gal-3 mediates
  Akt phosphorylation, which promotes phosphorylation of GSK-3β and thus decreases
  its activity. Inactivation of GSK-3β leads to a reduction in β-catenin degradation.
  Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of
  its specific target genes, which ultimately leads to drug resistance in ALCs.
