caption: (A) The aryl sulfonamide type MG compounds’ chemical structures; (B) the
  substrate receptor DCAF15-involved E3 ligase protein complex model. Each compound
  in (A) was documented to engage the same E3 ligase protein complex (CRL4DCAF15)
  to polyubiquitinate the compound’s neosubstrates shown in . Then, the polyubiquitinated
  neosubstrates/protein targets in  would be degraded through the ubiquitination proteasome
  pathway.
