caption: Main pathways of inflammation mediated by the immune system and possible
  polysaccharide signaling mechanisms that contribute to the immunosuppression of
  pro-inflammatory substances production pathways. A) Direct route mediated by mitochondria;
  B) MyD88 protein signaling pathway; C) MAPK protein signaling pathway. In addition,
  the main polysaccharide-mediated immunosuppression pathways are shown with red arrows.
