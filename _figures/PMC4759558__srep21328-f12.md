caption: 'The process of progesterone production requires the following enzymes: cholesterol
  side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (CYP11A1, P450scc), 3-βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  (3βHSD), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). Thecal cells from rodents
  produce progesterone/testosterone as precursors for estradiol production in neighboring
  granulosa cells. Expression levels of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes are regulated
  by many different factors within the antral follicle, including hCG, the stimulatory
  factors are shown in Green arrow. DHT treatment inhibits hCG induction through BMP4
  pathway in red T shapes, while Chemerin stimulates the effect of DHT through its
  receptor, CMKLR1. hCG, Human chorionic gonadotropin. DHT, dihydrotestosterone. BMP-4,
  bone morphogenetic protein 4.'
