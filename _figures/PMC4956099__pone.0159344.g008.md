caption: Only the predominant pathways involved in post-UVR regulation of ATR and
  ATM recruitment during G1 and S phase of cell cycle are considered. G1 phase cells
  possess UVR-induced lesions which primarily recruit core components of NER pathway.
  Formation of the NER complex in turn facilitates the recruitment of ATR and ATM
  to initiate repair and in parallel the downstream events leading to G1 checkpoint.
  In S phase cells, replication fork encounters the UVR-induced lesions which result
  in the formation of ssDNA breaks and recruitment of ATR to processed single strand
  ends. Replication fork collapse results in DSBs where ATM is recruited. Both of
  these SSBs and DSBs lead to the initiation of S phase replication checkpoint and
  are repaired by HR pathway.
