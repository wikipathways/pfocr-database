caption: 'Leptin signaling pathways. Six isoforms of the leptin receptor are obtained
  by alternative splicing and named LepRa–LepRf. All isoforms share identical extracellular
  binding and transmembrane domain. LepRe is the soluble receptor isoform—a cleavage
  product of the extracellular domain of the LepRb. Five isoforms—LepRa–LepRd and
  LepRf—are bound to the cell membrane (depicted as two thick gray lines). Their intracellular
  domains differ—the number below isoform indicates the number of amino acids in the
  intracellular domain. LepRb possesses the longest intracellular domain and contains
  motifs for the complete activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway. After leptin binds
  the LepRs they oligomerize (here depicted only as dimerization) and activate associated
  JAK2. The autophosphorylated JAK2 can lead to the activation of PI3K/AKT, ROCK (Rho/ROCK),
  and AMPK pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates LepRb, the three important tyrosine residues
  in the cytoplasmic tail (Tyr985/1077/1138). Via phospho-Tyr985 activated at least
  three MAPK pathways: ERK, JNK, and p38. STAT5 binds to phospho-Tyr1077 and phospho-Tyr1138,
  while STAT1 and STAT3 bind to phospho-Tyr1138. LepRa also activates JAK2 and MAPK-ERK
  pathway. Solid arrow—one or more proteins in the pathway. Dashed arrow—more proteins
  in the pathway. LepR—leptin receptor, JAK2—Janus-activated kinase 2, STAT—signal
  transducer and activator of transcription, PI3K—phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT—Protein
  kinase B, also known as Akt, ROCK—Ras homolog gene family/Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming
  protein kinase, AMPK—adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, MAPK—mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, ERK—extracellular signal-regulated kinase, JNK—c-Jun-N-terminal
  kinase. See text for more details.'
