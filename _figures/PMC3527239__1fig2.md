caption: '(A) Metabolic pathways of TAG synthesis and degradation and their subcellular
  localization (adapted from  and ). Phospholipids and TAG share DAG and PA as common
  precursors. In the de novo synthesis of phospholipids, PA serves as the immediate
  precursor of CDP-DAG, precursor to PI, PGP, and PS. PA is dephosphorylated to DAG,
  which serves as the precursor of PE and PC in the Kennedy pathway. DAG also serves
  as the precursor for TAG and can be phosphorylated, regenerating PA. The names of
  the enzymes that are discussed in detail in the text are shown adjacent to the arrows
  of the metabolic conversions in which they are involved, and the gene–enzyme relationships
  are listed in . Lipids and intermediates are boxed, with the most abundant lipid
  classes boxed by bold lines. Enzyme names are indicated in boldface type. TAG, triacylglycerols;
  PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidic acid; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol; Gro, glycerol; Gluc-6P, glucose-6 phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, PS, phosphatidylserine; FFA, free fatty acids;
  Ins, inositol. Nucl, nucleus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mito, mitochondria; LD,
  lipid droplets; G/E/V, Golgi, endosomes, vacuole; Pex, peroxisomes; Cyt, cytoplasma;
  PM, plasma membrane. See text for details. (B) Metabolic pathways of fatty acid
  metabolism. FA de novo synthesis and elongation: FA (type I) de novo synthesis requires
  the synthesis of malonyl-CoA by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc1. This cytosolic
  trifunctional enzyme harbors a covalently bound biotin, an N-terminal biotin carboxylase
  domain, and a C-terminal transcarboxylase domain (). Malonyl-CoA is used by the
  cytosolic FA synthase complex, consisting of Fas1 (β-subunit) and Fas2 (α-subunit),
  which are organized in a hexameric α6β6 complex. Fas1 harbors acetyl transferase
  (AT), enoyl reductase (ER), dehydratase (DH), and malonyl-palmitoyl transferase
  (MPT) activities; Fas2 contains the acyl carrier protein (ACP), 3-ketoreductase
  (KR), 3-ketosynthase (KS), and phosphopantheine transferase activities. The product
  of FA synthesis in yeast is acyl-CoA, typically C14–C16 carbon atoms in length ().
  Activated FAs may be elongated to VLCFAs by the activity of Elo1, Fen1/Elo2, and
  Sur4/Elo3 (condensing enzymes); Ybr159w (reductase); Phs1 (dehydratase); and Tsc13
  (enoyl-CoA reductase). Yeast also expresses a set of bacterial type II enzymes (as
  individual polypeptides) that perform the same reactions in mitochondria, but are
  encoded by nuclear genes (). Mitochondrial FA synthesis presumably generates FA
  only up to C8, which is a precursor for lipoic acid synthesis. FAs are degraded
  by β-oxidation. β-oxidation in yeast occurs exclusively in peroxisomes. Medium chain
  fatty acids enter peroxisomes as free fatty acids (FFA) and are activated by a peroxisomal
  acyl-CoA synthetase, Faa2. ATP that is required for this activation step is imported
  into the organelle via Ant1. Long chain fatty acids, such as oleate, are activated
  outside the organelle by Fat1, Faa1, or Faa4 and taken up as CoA esters (acyl-CoA)
  via a peroxisomal ABC transporter that consists of the heterodimer Pxa1/Pxa2. Inside
  peroxisomes, CoA esters undergo dehydrogenation by Pox1, hydratation/dehydrogenation
  by Fox2, and ultimately thiolytical cleavage by Pot1, leading to acetyl-CoA and
  an acyl-chain shortened by two carbon atoms. Hydrogen peroxide produced by Pox1
  is degraded by peroxisomal catalase T, Cta1. NADH is exported to the cytosol via
  a malate shuttle that involves peroxisomal (Mdh3) and cytosolic (Mdh2) malate dehydrogenases.
  The transporter for malate and oxaloacetate has not been identified yet. Acetyl-CoA
  is transported to the cytosol via carnitine-dependent acetyl-CoA transport (involving
  Cat2) or via the glyoxylate cycle (see ). Unsaturated FAs, such as oleic acid with
  the double bond between C9 and C10, can be fully oxidized only in the presence of
  auxiliary enzymes, but the precise mechanism is controversial. Eci1 is a Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA
  isomerase in the so-called isomerase-dependent major pathway, which catalyzes the
  positional and stereochemical isomerization of cis-3-enoyl-CoA to trans-2-enoyl-CoA;
  this reaction is required after oleic acid (as coenzyme A derivative) has been shortened
  by three rounds of β-oxidation, since only trans-2-enoyl-CoA is a β-oxidation substrate.
  Eci1 also isomerizes a fraction of 2-trans, 5-cis-dienoyl-CoA to 3,5-dienoyl-CoA,
  which has two conjugated double bonds in trans (3) and cis (5) configuration. This
  compound is presumably degraded by the minor pathway that involves Dci1, Sps19,
  and Eci1. Alternatively, 3,5-dienoyl-CoA is hydrolyzed by Tes1 thioesterase-dependent
  pathway) to the free FA and coenzyme A.'
