caption: Different signaling pathways and their related functions in GSC. The Notch
  signaling pathway mediates interactions between GSC and endothelial cells, thereby
  promoting cancer cell invasion/migration. The Wnt pathway regulates angiogenesis,
  cancer cell invasion/migration, and the maintenance of stemness in GSC. The Sonic
  hedgehog pathway drives GSC self-renewal, proliferation, and drug resistance, while
  also inducing the secretion of stem cell factors. The NF-κB pathway sustains GSC
  self-renewal and proliferation, enhances drug resistance, and increases invasive
  capacity. The JAK/STAT pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of GSC stemness
  maintenance. The PI3K/AKT pathway facilitates cancer cell invasion/migration and
  supports stem cell proliferation and survival (By Figdraw)
