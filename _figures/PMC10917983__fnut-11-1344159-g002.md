caption: Biogenesis and mechanism of miRNAs. The production of the pri-miRNA transcript
  marks the beginning of canonical miRNA biogenesis. The pri-miRNA is broken down
  through the microprocessor complex made up of DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region
  8 (DGCR8) and Drosha to create the precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA). Thus, the pre-miRNA
  has been processed to create a mature miRNA duplex within the cytoplasm in a way
  that is reliant on Exportin5 and RanGTP. The mature miRNA duplex is then loaded
  onto a member of the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins to create a miRNA-induced
  silencing complex (miRISC). Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) has been first cut via the
  microprocessor complex in the non-canonical pathways and then transported to the
  cytoplasm by Exportin5/RanGTP. They undergo more processing via cleavage that relies
  on AGO2 but not Dicer. Dicer is required for the 7-methylguanine capped (m7G)-pre-miRNA
  and the mirtrons’ cytoplasmic maturation, although their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
  differs. While Exportin1 exports m7G-pre-miRNA, Exportin5/RanGTP exports mirtrons.
  A functioning miRISC complex has been the end outcome of every possible path. Most
  frequently, target mRNAs are bound by miRISC to prevent translation; probably by
  interacting with the eIF4F complex, this is achieved. The poly (A)-deadenylases
  CCR4-NOT and PAN2/3 are then recruited through GW182 family proteins that are coupled
  to Argonaute. The decapping complex might remove the target mRNA’s m7G cap since
  deadenylation, initiated by PAN2/3 and completed by the CCR4-NOT complex, has taken
  place. The exoribonuclease XRN1 might then cause decapped mRNA’s 5’–3’ degradation,
