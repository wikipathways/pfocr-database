caption: 'The diagram illustrates the possible mechanism of tumor cells-secreted CCN1
  in regulation of pancreatic carcinogenesis through the regulation of SHh signaling.
  The studies postulated that CCN1-mediated induction of SHh is regulated via integrin-αvβ3-Notch-1-signaling
  pathway. CCN1 recruits active Notch-1 for the regulation of SHh by stabilizing the
  active Notch-1 receptor through blocking the proteasomal degradation process. The
  studies also speculate that Jagged1, one of the ligands of Notch-1, may participate
  in CCN1-induced activation of Notch-1 as Jagged1 is regulated by CCN1 in pancreatic
  cancer cells (supplemental Fig. S2). ICD: notch-1 intracellular domain, and TC:
  transcriptional complex.'
