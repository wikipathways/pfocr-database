caption: Biosynthesis of N-3 and N-6 PUFAs. The biosynthesis of N-3 and N-6 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) involves competition between the N-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA),
  and the N-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), for binding to delta (∆)-6 desaturase.
  Depending on the amount of dietary intake of PUFAs, one of these metabolic pathways
  is activated. If the intake of N-6 PUFAs is higher than N-3 PUFAs, the metabolic
  pathway leads to the synthesis of arachidonic acid (AA). On the other hand, if the
  intake of N-3 PUFAs is higher than N-6 PUFAs, the metabolic pathway leads to the
  synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DHA).
