caption: Metabolic reconstruction of Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, SAR406, and SAR202,
  based on the top three or four most complete genomes. Colors indicate pathway elements
  based on the number of genomes in which they were recovered, according to the key.
  Black outlines and/or arrows indicate genes that were not observed. Boldface black
  numbers correspond to annotations supplied in Table S1 at http://thethrashlab.com/publications.
