caption: Exogenous GM3 and the EGFR-mediated PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Exogenously
  added GM3 binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR and inhibits its dimerization
  [] without inhibiting ligand binding []. Exogenous GM3 inhibits EGF-induced phosphorylation
  of EGFR at the Tyr-1173 residue []. After inhibition by blocking phosphorylation,
  the inhibited signal from the EGFR prevents one of the three downstream signaling
  pathways, PI3K, AKT, or mTOR. PI3K and AKT activation is reduced []. Upon inhibition
  of the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT subsequently suppresses the phosphorylation
  of mTOR, which mediates protein synthesis []. This mechanism for suppressed EGFR
  activity might reduce cell proliferation and inhibit the repair of DNA damage [].
  The activation changes of these pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins is initiated in
  mitochondria []. Continuous mitochondrial regulation releases pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as cytochrome c into the cytoplasm causing caspase cascades processed by apoptosis,
  the programed cell death [].The most compelling evidence shows that GM3 treatment
  decreases phosphorylated EGFR levels and regulates down-stream EGFR activation in
  cumulus-oocyte complexes COCs. Consequently, GM3 exposure reduces EGFR-delivered
  PI3K/AKT signaling for proliferation during in vitro maturation of porcine COCs
  [].
