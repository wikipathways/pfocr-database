caption: Runx2-deficient cells exhibit suppression of genes by insulin at multiple
  stages of the signaling pathway. Proteins at different stages of the pathway from
  the receptor, transducer, nuclear effecter, and target gene are shown. Expressions
  of respective genes are downregulated upon addition of insulin to Runx2-null cells
  (indicated by red arrows), while insulin robustly induces these genes in 3T3-L1
  cells (indicated by green arrows).
