caption: Intracellular pathway associated with IGF1R activation. IGF1R activation
  by INS, IGF1 and IGF2, leads to autophosphorylation on tyrosines 1131, 1135 and
  1136 in the kinase domain, followed by recruitment of specific docking intermediates,
  such as members of the IRS family (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, IRS-4). This molecule link
  the IGF1R to diverse signalling pathways, allowing the induction of growth, transformation,
  differentiation and protection against apoptosis, primarily through the activation
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the Ras GTPase/Raf-1 (Raf)/Mek (MAPK)/Erk (ERK1/2) signalling
  pathways.
