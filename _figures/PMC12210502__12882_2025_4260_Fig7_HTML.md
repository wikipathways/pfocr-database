caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and renal angiomyolipomas development (by
  Figdraw). In patients with TSC1 mutations, RAML usually occurs at a later age with
  relatively small lesion size and growth potential, whereas patients with TSC2 mutations
  are predisposed to develop RAML at an earlier age and have a higher probability
  of bleeding and hematuria complications. Studies suggest that human proximal renal
  tubular epithelial cells may be the origin of RAML. Interestingly, reduced expression
  of MITF negatively regulates RAML development by inhibiting cell growth, invasion,
  and migration. It can act by regulating CyR61, which suggests that CyR61 is a novel
  target for MITF to regulate RAML progression, and both MITF and CyR61 are expected
  to be potential targets for future clinical treatment of RAML. TSC1/2: Tuberous
  sclerosis complex 1/2; RAML: Renal angiomyolipomas; MITF: Microphthalmia transcription
  factors; CyR61: Cysteine-Rich Angiogenic Protein 61'
