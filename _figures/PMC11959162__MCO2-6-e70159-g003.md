caption: Ubiquitination in bone homeostasis and osteoporosis. (A) Ubiquitination is
  a reversible process mediated by a cascade of enzymes, including E1‐activating,
  E2‐conjugating, and E3‐ligating enzymes, while the Ub can be removed by DUBs and
  thus preventing protein from proteasome degradation. (B) Several E3 ligases, including
  NEDD4, WWP2, SMURF1, RNF138, and SKP2, target RUNX2 for ubiquitination and degradation,
  thus suppressing commitment to osteoblast in BMSCs, and USP10 also inhibits osteogenesis
  through deubiquitination of SKP2. (C) ubiquitin signaling is also involved in bone
  homeostasis and osteoblast differentiation. FGF signaling is inhibited or promoted
  through the regulation of SMURF1 and OTUB1 respectively. SMURF 1 is also involved
  in the regulation of BMP signaling pathway through ubiquitinating SMAD1/5, while
  SMURF2, which can ubiquitinated by TKF4, targets SMAD proteins for modification
  and degradation, leading to BMP signaling deactivation. In the regulation of WNT
  signaling, osteoblast differentiation is promoted through stabilization of YAP1
  and β‐Catenin mediated by USP7, USP26, and USP53 respectively, while β‐Catenin ubiquitinated
  by FBXO31
