caption: The proposed interaction and intermediates exchange between phospholipids
  pathway and galactolipid pathway in maize under NaHCO3 (100 mmol). The glycerolipid
  synthesis pathways were depicted, and the involving genes and lipid metabolites
  were symbolized. The relative change of lipid molecular species was marked as arrows.
  Red and blue arrows indicate increased and decreased lipid metabolites, respectively.
  The colored and bold lines represent activated steps by NaHCO3 (100 mmol).
