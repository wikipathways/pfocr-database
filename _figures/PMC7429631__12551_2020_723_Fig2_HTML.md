caption: Profilin can be phosphorylated at S137 by Rho associated kinase (ROCK) downstream
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling, reducing actin polymerisation
  rates. The phosphorylation of profilin at S137 prevents the binding of proteins
  through proline repeat domains (PRD). Many of these proteins regulate actin polymerisation
  resulting in decreased actin polymerisation, cell survival and proliferation. The
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) enzyme regulates the balance between phosphorylated
  and de-phosphorylated profilin. ROCK may also have a role in regulating the interaction
  between profilin and the formin mDia VEGFR and the downstream kinase Src directly
  phosphorylate profilin at Y129, with opposite effect to the Rho/ROCK pathway. Y129
  phosphorylated profilin has a higher affinity for actin, and accelerates actin polymerisation
  rates, leading to angiogenesis and vascular hypertrophy
