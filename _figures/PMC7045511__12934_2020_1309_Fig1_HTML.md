caption: 'β-ionone biosynthesis pathway in the engineered Yarrowia lipolytica. a The
  biosynthesis pathway was organized into three modules: Module 1, the cytosolic acetyl-CoA
  supply module; Module 2, the MVA module; Module 3, the β-ionone synthesis module.
  Exogenous and endogenous genes are indicated in blue and red, respectively. b The
  detailed view of all the seven units. The genes expressed encode the following enzymes:
  PK phosphoketolase, PTA phosphotransacetylase, ERG10 acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, ERG13
  hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, tHMGR truncated hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase,
  ERG8 phosphomevalonate kinase, ERG12 mevalonate kinase, ERG19 mevalonate diphosphate
  decarboxylase, IDI isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, ERG20 geranyl/farnesyl diphosphate
  synthase, GGS1 GGPP synthase, carB phytoene dehydrogenase, carRP phytoene synthase/lycopene
  cyclase, CCD1 carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase'
