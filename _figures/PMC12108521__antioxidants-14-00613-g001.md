caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and key regulatory pathways. This figure
  systematically elucidates the core driving mechanism of ferroptosis and its inhibitory
  regulatory network: iron overload catalyzes the lipid peroxidation process of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) via the Fenton reaction, in which ACSL4/LPCAT3-mediated PUFA-CoA
  esterification and phospholipid membrane incorporation are critical for initiation
  (left). System Xc—the GSH-GPX4 antioxidant axis maintains oxidative homeostasis
  by reducing lipid peroxides (right). Important inhibitory pathways include the FSP1/CoQ10H2
  axis to neutralize lipid free radicals via the ubiquinone regeneration system and
  the BH4 metabolic pathway to synergistically regulate oxidative stress. The nodes
  labeled in the figure (e.g., GPX4, FSP1, etc.) are potential therapeutic targets,
  and their network of interactions provides a molecular basis for ferroptosis-related
  disease intervention'
