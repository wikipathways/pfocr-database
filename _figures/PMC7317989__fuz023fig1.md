caption: Model illustrating the steps of EBV infection of epithelial cells. In the
  first step (Step I), EBV binds to target cells using variable host cell surface
  receptors and multiple viral envelope glycoproteins. In some cases, binding of EBV
  virions can induce signaling pathway activation (Step II). After binding to the
  cell surface receptors, (either by direct membrane fusion or fusion with the endosomal
  membrane) (Step III), the viral capsid is then transported in the cytosol to the
  nuclear periphery (Step IV). Once at a nuclear pore, the viral genome is released
  into the nucleus through a nuclear pore (Step V). Integrins (αvβ5, αvβ6 and αvβ8),
  NRP1 and NMHC-IIA interact with corresponding glycoproteins indicated as black-dashed
  arrows. EphA2 binds to both gH/gL (red solid arrow) and gB (black-dashed arrow).
  EphA2 is the most important entry receptor for EBV epithelial cell infection and
  is therefore indicated in red.
