caption: Biosynthesis pathway of complex type N-glycans. The reactions of α1,6-FucT,
  GnT-IV and GnT-V and complex type N-glycan structures in this study are highlighted.
  GnT-IV and GnT-V increase number of antenna, and some of them are modified by α1,6-FucT.
  Then, they are galactosylated by β1,4- galactosyltransferase as shown as black arrows.
  The products of GnT-V were modified by GnT-IV in this study, so we have indicated
  that GnT-V works after GnT-IV in the biosynthetic pathway. However, it is possible
  that GnT-V may act at an earlier step than GnT-IV.
