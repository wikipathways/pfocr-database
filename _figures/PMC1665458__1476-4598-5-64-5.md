caption: 'Network of interactions between the 31 differentially expressed proteins.
  TNF is not one of the 31 proteins but is shown here as it interacts with many components
  of the network. Nodes represent proteins and links indicate known interactions or
  modulations from neighboring nodes. Proteins at the bottom of the figure are in
  the 31 protein set but are not involved in the network. Links scheme -gray square:
  regulation; -green square: direct regulation; -green circle: promoter binding; -green
  open square: molecular transport; -blue open square: molecular synthesis; -blue
  square: expression; -yellow circle: protein modification; -purple circle: binding.'
