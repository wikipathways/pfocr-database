caption: 'a AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), along with its metabolites, and β-
  and γ-secretase enzymes are found in MERCS. The APP is first cleaved by β-secretase
  and then γ-secretase to release Aβ. Aβ has been shown to alter lipid metabolism
  at MERCS. b ALS: TDP-43 and FUS in the cytoplasm activate GSK3β by dephosphorylating
  it at cysteine 9. GSK3β can then disrupt VAPB and PTPIP51 binding, uncoupling the
  ER from the mitochondria and altering Ca2+signalling. Sig-1R can bind IP3R, stabilising
  it in the membrane, while loss of Sig-1R can result in ALS-like symptoms in mice
  and uncoupling of MERCS. c PD: WT or mutated α-Synuclein interacts with VAPB altering
  its binding to PTPIP51, disrupting MERCS and Ca2+signalling. Miro is present in
  MERCS and can disrupt Ca2+signalling and autophagy. PINK1 and Parkin, under mitophagy
  induction, have been shown to localise to MERCS and also impact on Ca2+signalling
  and to promote the phosphoubiquitination of MFN2, resulting in its degradation and
  the uncoupling of the mitochondria from the ER. PINK1 and Miro have also been associated
  with altered mitophagy as PINK1 interacts with BECN1. Key autophagy genes (e.g.,
  ATG14L and ATG5) are also present in MERCS and impact on mitophagy, a pathway dysregulated
  in PD.'
