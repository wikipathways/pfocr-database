caption: 'Schematic illustration of synaptic and non-synaptic interactions with retinal
  ganglion cells in optic nerve regeneration. (A) After optic nerve injury, various
  types of cells interact with RGCs and participate in optic nerve regeneration. These
  post-injury intercellular interactions could be classified into two broad categories:
  synaptic interactions, involving with ACs and BCs (not shown in the figure), and
  non-synaptic interactions, including glial cells (oligodendrocytes, reactive astrocytes,
  and microglia) and inflammatory cells (macrophages and neutrophils). (B) Synaptic
  interactions: (1) Purified ACs inhibit axon outgrowth through co-culture with RGCs
  in direct contact. (2) Mobile Zn2+ accumulated in ACs is transported in pre-synaptic
  vesicles by ZnT-3 and then transfer into RGCs through vesicular release to inhibit
  axon regeneration. (3) Inhibitory neurotransmitters released by ACs bind to post-synaptic
  receptors and attenuate axon regeneration induced by IGF-1. (C) Non-synaptic interactions:
  Nogo-A, MAG, and OMgp expressed by oligodendrocytes; CSPGs, Sema3A, and tenascins
  derived from reactive astrocytes; and Ocm secreted by macrophages and neutrophils
  all accumulate around damaged axons and bind to specific receptors on RGCs to inhibit
  axon regeneration. RhoA/ROCK/LIMK1 pathway is the primary signaling downstream of
  glial cell interactions and leads to subsequent actin polymerization and axon regeneration
  inhibition. PirB and Trk convey inhibitory signals of axon regeneration through
  two downstream cascades SHP-1/2 and POSH. The potent pro-regenerative effects of
  Ocm are mediated by increased level of intracellular cAMP. ACs, amacrine cells;
  BCs, bipolar cells; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CSPGs, chondroitin sulfate
