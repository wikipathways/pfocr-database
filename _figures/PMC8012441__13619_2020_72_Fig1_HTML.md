caption: The diagrams of Notch and Wnt pathways. a The Notch receptor and ligand are
  localized at the plasma membranes of neighboring cells. Their binding triggers the
  sequential cleavage of Notch receptor by ADAM family of metalloproteases and γ-secretase,
  leading to the release of Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates
  into the nucleus and facilitates the CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/LAG1) transcription factor,
  along with the coactivator Mastermind-like (MAML), to activate the transcription
  of target genes. b Without Wnt ligand, β-catenin is hyperphosphorylated within a
  cytoplasmic destruction complex including Dishevelled (Dvl), Axin, casein kinase
  1 (CK1), Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
  and then degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. When Wnt ligand binds to
  a seven-pass transmembrane receptor Frizzled (Fz) and a single-pass transmembrane
  co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), the Dvl/Axin/CK1/APC/GSK3
  complex is dissociated, allowing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and subsequently
  translocate into the nucleus, where β-catenin interacts with transcriptional factors,
  such as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor1/T cell-specific transcription factor (LEF/TCF),
  to induce the expression of target genes
