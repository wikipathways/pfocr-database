caption: Schematic representation depicting the potential mechanisms of Hv (hepatic
  vagotomy) aggravating hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Expression of IL-22 induced
  by IR injury in the liver was significantly downregulated when the hepatic vagus
  branch was cut off. Following this, the activation of STAT3 signaling pathway is
  downregulated, and then the expression of cyclin D1 is downregulated, which eventually
  aggravates liver injury. In mice treated with exogenous IL-22, the aggravating effect
  of Hv on liver injury was reversed due to the IL-22 supplementation.
