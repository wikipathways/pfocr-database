caption: Simplified schema of TGFβ signaling in PDAC cells. TGFβ family ligands associate
  with the N-terminal extra-cellular ligand-binding ectodomain of the type 2 TGFβ
  receptor (TGFBR2), which then recruits the type 1 TGFβ receptor (TGFBR1). TGFBR1
  phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins via its serine/threonine kinase domains,
  leading to the formation of a heteroligomer with SMAD4. This activated SMAD complex
  then translocates to the nucleus, and SMAD4 associates with CAGAC motifs (or SMAD-binding
  elements) via its MH1 domain to alter gene expression. In benign and neoplastic
  pancreatic epithelial cells, the TGFβ/SMAD pathway can arrest the cell cycle via
  transcriptional upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors including
  p15INK4A, p21CIF1/WAF1, and others. This blocks the transition from G1 to S phase
  by repressing cyclin–CDK complexes, as well as direct several additional cellular
  processes as described in this review. TGFβ signaling also involves several non-SMAD
  components, most notably the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which occurs through the direct
  phosphorylation of ShcA. TGFβ signaling also involves crosstalk with several additional
  pathways, including PI3K, NFκB, and many others. Although the biologic effects of
  these signaling events are varied, most non-SMAD TGFβ signaling appears to facilitate
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration.
