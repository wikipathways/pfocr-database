caption: The roles of protein kinase C (PKC) in DPN. Hyperglycemia-induced alternative
  glucose metabolic pathways lead to diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation, which then
  activates PKC. Hyperglycemia-induced inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase also results PKC
  activation. Active PKC stimulates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which breaks
  down the phospholipids and liberates arachidonic acid (AA), leading to an increased
  production of PGE2. PGE2 inhibits the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase. The inhibition
  of Na+-K+-ATPase has been associated with NCS and impaired nerve regeneration. In
  addition, PKC can induce the phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin,
  promoting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced increase in endothelial
  permeability, leading to impaired blood flow to the nerves. PKC-mediated transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates diabetic neuropathy with neuroinflammation and
  is associated with hyperalgesia and allodynia
