caption: 'Relative expression of DEGs in the pathways involved in production of antioxidant
  and chloroplast organization of stylo treated by phloretin and pterostilbene during
  C. gloeosporioides infection. The mean FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript
  per million mapped reads) values for the DEGs were calculated from three biological
  replicates. The progression of the color scale from blue to red represents an increase
  in the FPKM values. (A) AsA-GSH cycles. APX: ascorbate peroxidase, AsA: ascorbate
  acid, MDHA: monodehydroascorbate, MADHAR: monodehydroascorbate reductase, DHA: Dehydroascorbic
  acid, DHAR: dehydroascorbate reductase, GSH: glutathione, GSSH: oxidized glutathione,
  GR: glutathione reductase. (B) GSH-related pathways. CLT: CRT-like transporter,
  GRX: Glutaredoxin. (C) Flavonoids biosynthesis. 7-IOMT: isoflavone-7-O-methyltransferase,
  CYP17D9: flavonoid 6-hydroxylase, CHS: chalcone synthase. (D) Subunits of photosystem
  I. (E) Photosystem II-related. CYP38: cyclophilin38, FKBP20: peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
  isomerase FKBP20-2, CAB215: chlorophyll a-b binding protein 215, NYC1: chlorophyll
  b reductase NYC1. (F) Carotenoid metabolic pathway. ABA2: short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase
  2, AAO3: aldehyde oxidase 3, ABA: abscisic acid, PAL: phenylalanine ammonia lyase'
