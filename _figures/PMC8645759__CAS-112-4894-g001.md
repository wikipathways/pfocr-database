caption: Schematic illustration of Notch‐1 activation and the downstream signaling
  pathway for McTNs formation of suspended cancer cells. Notch‐1 signaling triggers
  Cdc42‐mediated McTNs formation to facilitate suspended cancer cells reattachment.
  The activation of Notch‐1 signaling increased the polymerization of microtubule
  by the Cdc42/HDAC6 pathway as well as suppressed the actomyosin by Cdc42/MLC pathway,
  thereby promote the McTNs formation and cell reattachment. By this co ordination
  regulation, Notch‐1 signaling plays a critical role in the balance between the outward
  extension of microtubules and inward contractility of actin in McTNs formation
