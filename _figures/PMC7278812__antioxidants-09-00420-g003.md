caption: The selenium-dependent antioxidant system of glutathione peroxidases (GPx)
  and thioredoxin reductases (TrxR). Reducing equivalents necessary to counter unwanted
  oxidations are obtained from glucose via the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) reduces NADP+ to NADPH, which in turn is used by glutathione
  disulfide reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) to reduce glutathione
  disulfide (GSSG) and oxidized thioredoxin (TrxSS) back to 2GSH and Trx(SH)2, respectively.
  Glutathione “recycles” GPx enzymes, e.g., GPx1 and GPx4. NAPDH is also a cofactor
  for the reduction of TrxSS, carried out by TrxR. GSH and the GPxs along with Trx(SH)2
  and peroxiredoxins (Prx(SH)2) work via separate nodes to reduce H2O2 to H2O. Adapted
  from [].
