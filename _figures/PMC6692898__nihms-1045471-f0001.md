caption: N-Dealkylation of terbinafine pathways leading to formation of reactive TBF-A.
  Three N-dealkylation pathways for terbinafine yield TBF-A (m/z 384, dansyl labeled).
  Pathway 1 (red) is a single-step pathway directly yielding TBF-A and N-methyl-1-naphthyl
  methylamine (m/z 405, dansyl labeled) as a co-metabolite (Step 1.1). Pathway 2 (blue)
  is a two-step pathway first yielding desmethyl-terbinafine (m/z 511, dansyl labeled)
  and formaldehyde via N-demethylation (Step 2.1), followed by the generation of 1-naphthyl
  methylamine (m/z 391, dansyl labeled) and TBF-A from desmethyl-terbinafine (Step
  2.2a). Pathway 3 (green) is a two-step pathway first yielding 1-naphthaldehyde (m/z
  404, dansyl labeled) and N-methyl-6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-yn-1-amine (Step 3.1),
  which undergoes N-dealkylation to yield TBF-A (Step 3.2a). There are three non-N-dealkylation
  primary metabolites of terbinafine from alternate pathways. Hydroxyterbinafine (m/z
  308) and two isomers of terbinafine dihydrodiol (m/z 326) were also observed in
  this study (shown in the box). Carboxyterbinafine has been reported by others, but
  was not observed under our steady-state conditions.,
