caption: Molecular mechanisms of LGR4 in bone metabolism. (Left) Competitive binding
  of LGR4 and RANK to RANKL activates the GSK-3β signaling pathway and inhibits the
  RANKL-RANK signaling pathway, which inhibits the production of the transcription
  factor NEATC1, thereby inhibiting differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells
  (OPCs) to osteoclasts (OCs) and podosomes fusion. miR-34c could have been the transcription
  of lgr4 mRNA. (Middle) RSPO1 binding to LGR4 activates Wnt/β-catenin, which promotes
  ALP production and the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)
  to osteoblasts(OBs). miR-137 and miR-193a-3p could have been the transcription of
  lgr4 mRNA, inhibiting this process. BMP9 and BMP2 could promote the expression of
  LGR4 and the expression of LGR4 in turn promotes their production. (Right) LGR4
  activates the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway by binding to ligands and thus promotes
  the secretion of ATF4, which is essential for bone formation and development. And
  LGR4 can Stabilize with Lrp5 and activate the GSK-3β signaling pathway, which promotes
  the expression of PDK1 and bone development
