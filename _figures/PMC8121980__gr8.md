caption: A schematic illustration of the working model of this study. The present
  study demonstrated that hypoxia acclimation-associated inflammatory cytokines upregulate
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and activate G6PDH by increasing the O-GlcNAcylation,
  which improves pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)-mediated redox homeostasis, and alleviates
  acute cardiac I/R injury.
