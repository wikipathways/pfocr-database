caption: Working model shows that MET inhibitor inhibited the positive feedback loop
  between high STMN1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and hepatic stellate cells
  (HSC). STMN1 mediates intricate crosstalk between HCC and HSC by triggering the
  HGF/MET signal pathway. In the coculture system between HCC cells and HSC, HSC secreted
  more HGF and activated the MET pathway to increase STMN1 expression in HCC cells,
  and STMN1 subsequently promoted platelet‐derived growth factor homodimeric protein
  (PDGF‐BB) expression, which might facilitate HSC activation to acquire cancer‐associated
  fibroblast characteristics and further elevate hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) protein
  level. MET inhibitor crizotinib could block the MET pathway to effectively inhibit
  HCC‐HSC crosstalk and shrink tumor growth when both high STMN1 HCC cells and HSC
  were coinoculated in mice
