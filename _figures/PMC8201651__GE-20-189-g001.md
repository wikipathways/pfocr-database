caption: Cell–molecule circuitry of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during liver regeneration.
  Wnt/β-catenin is a major regulator of hepatic repair. After insult, sinusoidal endothelial
  cell-secreted Wnts bind to Frizzled receptors (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL)-related protein-5/6 coreceptors (LRP5/6) on hepatocytes, stabilize β-catenin,
  induce cyclin D1 expression, and promote hepatocyte proliferation. Shear stress
  and hypoxia are most likely the drivers of Wnt expression and secretion from endothelial
  cells after PH. RSPO–LGR4/5–ZNRF3/RNF43 module and heparan sulfate proteoglycans
  (HSPGs) potentiate Wnt/β-catenin by dispersal of hydrophobic Wnt ligands, by stabilization
  of Wnt receptors on the membrane, and by fine-tuning interactions of ligands and
  receptors. Modulators like transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) and lncRNA are also involved
  in this process. Several drugs, including GC-1/Sobetirome, AMBMP, pan-Fzd agonist,
  and bispecific RSPO are under evaluation and stand as promising candidates for hepatic
  regenerative medicine due to their positive impact on Wnt/β-catenin signaling at
  various key nodes in the cell-molecule circuitry of the pathway.
