caption: After a sustained hyperinflammatory response, in addition to fresh neutrophils
  (Ly6Ghi), many immature neutrophils (Ly6GloCD123hi) with impaired immune functions
  are also released into the peripheral blood or tissues. Moreover, microbial capture
  via phagocytic receptor SIGNR 1 on macrophages induces T cell death-dependent histone
  release. Cytokines induced by histones will selectively deplete mature neutrophils
  and increase immature neutrophils. Additionally, bacteria-induced aged neutrophils
  (CXCR4hiCD62Llo) inhibit TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion from T cell via upregulation
  of PD-L1 and the release of arginse-1. Monocytes, NK cells, more mature DC3s and
  mergDCs also overexpress PD-L1, and further suppress T cell proliferation. However,
  mregDCs might be also equipped with antigen-presenting ability due to upregulation
  of CD80. As shown in the blue zoomed-in section, typhoid toxin from Salmonella induces
  the upregulation of senescent-related gene p16INK4a. Macrophages exhibit SASP via
  activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway, and macrophages-released SASP-related
  components can trigger T cell to exhibit SASP and inhibit T cell proliferation.
  Moreover, SASP-related components could further promote SASP in macrophages via
  phosphorylation of GCN2 and eIF2α. Additionally, inflammatory cytokine storm during
  sepsis, including IL-33 or S1P, could directly induce thymus involution or atrophy,
  which results in aberrant aging of T cells and shows adverse impacts on immune surveillance.
  To be specific, senescent-related genes, such as p16 and p21, are upregulated, while
  activation and proliferation-related genes, such as Cd27 and Cd28, are downregulated
  in CD4+ T cells. Bacteria can increase the expression level of p16INK4a in B cells
  via DNA damage. *Created with BioRender.com
