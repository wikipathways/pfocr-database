caption: Mechanism of hyperglycaemia-induced cellular senescence. (A) Hyperglycaemia
  induces ROS overproduction via mitochondria overload which results in oxidative
  stress. ROS causes DNA damage response (DDR) activation, due to DNA oxidative damage,
  and p38 MAPK pathway activation. DDR and p38 MAPK determines cell cycle arrest and
  NF-κB upregulation. NF-κB activation results in SASP secretion. ROS also generates
  ER stress via chemical modification of ER proteins. ER stress activates the unfolded
  protein response (UPR). The activation of the ATF6α branch of the UPR causes expression
  of SA-β-Gal and changes in cellular morphology via cytoskeletal vimentin rearrangement.
  (B) Hyperglycaemia increases polyol pathway activity, causing reduced antioxidant
  glutathione synthesis due to reduce NADPH availability. Glutathione deficiency contributes
  to the inability of the cell to counteract oxidative stress. (C) Hyperglycaemia
  causes advance glycation end products (AGEs) via glycation of intracellular and
  extracellular proteins. Intracellular AGEs cause ER stress which results in SA-β-Gal
  activity and change in cellular morphology. Extracellular ages cause AGE receptor
  (RAGE) activation which results in ROS production and NF-κB activation. This ultimately
  results in cell cycle arrest and SASP secretion. (D) Hyperglycaemia results in increased
  hexosamine pathway activity due to increased glucose-6-phosphate production. This
  pathway produces N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) which induces TGF-β expression. TGF-β
  activates the p38 MAPK which results in cell cycle arrest and SASP secretion. (E)
  PKC signalling contributes to the activation of senescence pathways. Hyperglycaemia
  results in increased diacyl glycerol production and activation of PKC δ isoform.
  PKC δ activation causes TGF-β expression and ROS production which, in turn, activate
  PKC δ in a positive feedback loop mechanism. In addition, ROS also activate PKC
  η which induces SA-β-Gal activity. Downregulation of aPKC and cPKC results in inactivation
  of FoxO3a which results in ROS production. Cell cycle arrest, SASP secretion, change
  in cellular morphology and SA-β-Gal activity are the major characteristics of senescence.
