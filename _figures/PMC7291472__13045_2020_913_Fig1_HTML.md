caption: Diagram of CD155/CD112-mediated immunoregulatory pathway on NK cells. Interaction
  between TIGIT and CD155/CD112 induces inhibition of NK cell function via the phosphorylation
  of the ITIM domain and recruitment of SHIP1. This, in turn, inhibits MAPK, PI3K,
  and NF-κβ signaling. Interaction between DNAM-1/CD96 and CD155/CD112 provides an
  activating stimulus to NK cells. Upon binding, DNAM-1 relocates to lipid rafts where
  it homodimerizes and crosslinks with LFA-1 receptors. These cause phosphorylation
  of the Tyr322 residue of DNAM-1 resulting in NK cell cytolytic activity, cytokine
  secretion, and degranulation
