caption: Epstein-Barr virus interactions with the Bcl-2 protein family and apoptosisEBV
  infection disrupts normal cell death and survival pathways in various human tumor
  cells, including lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. Interconnected
  signaling pathways mediate apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic signals are mediated by BZLF1,
  down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression involving the repression of CD74 and
  p65. Pro-survival pathways occur mainly via EBV gene products (shown in light green).
  The activation of BHRF1 results in repression of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM,
  PUMA, and Bid; the activation of BARF1 causes the up-regulation of pro-survival
  Bcl-2 protein levels; LMP-1 stimulation results in the CTAR1 and CTAR2 regions of
  LMP-1 interacting with TNFR/CD40, including TARF1, and then activates the NF-κB/c-JNK/AP-1
  pathway and CAM-1, and finally up-regulates bfl-1 and Bcl-2 expression. In addition,
  the activation of LMP-1 inhibits or activates MCL-1; MIR-BART5 stimulation results
  in the repression of the pro-apoptotic protein PUMA; the activation of LMP2A results
  in activation of the Ha-Ras, PI3K/Akt pathway and the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as well
  as NF-κB, and then increases the expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. All of these result
  eventually in the inhibition of apoptosis. Unfortunately, the results of other interactions
  are not clear. BHRF1 is known to interact with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bok, BAK,
  BOD, and BIK. BALF1 interacts with Bax and BAK. Likewise, EBNA2 interacts with the
  pro-survival proteins Bcl2L1, Bcl-2, and MCL-1 and the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM
  and Bid. EBNA3A and EBENA3C inhibit BIM expression, and EBNA3C targets BIM directly.
  EBER-1 and EBER-2 up-regulate Bcl-2 expression by inhibiting PKR or MAPK and C-jun.
  EBNA2, mimicking Notch-IC, activates CBF-1 to up-regulate bfl-1. EBV also impacts
  the apoptosis pathway via the FAS/IFN-γ receptor and by binding to ced4/Apaf-1.
  Interestingly, the Bcl-2 family members, with which diverse EBV gene products interact,
  are essential in the ‘decision’ step of apoptosis, and then the activation of caspases
  mediates the ‘execution’ phase. These are both important steps in apoptosis
