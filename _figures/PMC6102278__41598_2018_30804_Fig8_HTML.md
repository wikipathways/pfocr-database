caption: Schematic representation of Fas-mediated EGF-induced EGFR signaling A proposed
  model of the robust EGF-induced EGFR signaling pathway mediated by the pro-survival,
  phosphorylated Fas that can lead to aggressive behavior of cancer cells is presented
  here. I. The presence of Fas is required for the efficient autophosphorylation and
  thus the activation of EGFR. II. Upon the binding with EGF, the Fas-dependent EGFR
  activation occurs concomitantly with the activation of the non-apoptotic mode of
  Fas by death-domain tyrosine phosphorylation at Y291. III. A protein complex comprising
  EGFR, Fas, Yes-1, STAT3, and Src is formed in a pY291 Fas-dependent manner. IV.
  STAT3 is then phosphorylated by Yes-1. V. pY-Fas, pY-EGFR, and pY-STAT3 are then
  translocated to the nucleus. VI. The accumulated nuclear EGFR acts as a transcriptional
  co-activator, possibly in association with STAT3, to upregulate cyclin D1 expression,
  leading to the enhanced cancer cell proliferation and migration. VII. The pY291-Fas-dependent
  hyperactivity of STAT3 promotes expressions of its target genes, leading to the
  upregulation of Akt and Erk activities, and thus the enhanced cancer cell proliferation
  and migration.

  description: Schematic representation of Fas-mediated EGF-induced EGFR signaling
    A proposed model of the robust EGF-induced EGFR signaling pathway mediated by
    the pro-survival, phosphorylated Fas that can lead to aggressive behavior of cancer
    cells is presented here. I. The presence of Fas is required for the efficient
    autophosphorylation and thus the activation of EGFR. II. Upon the binding with
    EGF, the Fas-dependent EGFR activation occurs concomitantly with the activation
    of the non-apoptotic mode of Fas by death-domain tyrosine phosphorylation at Y291.
