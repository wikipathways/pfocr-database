caption: 'The first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of AA (20:4n-6) from
  dietary LA (18:2n-6) is Δ6-desaturase. Phospholipid-bound AA is mobilized by cPLA2,
  and free AA may be metabolized by COX-1 and -2 enzymes to produce PGH2 and PGE2.
  PGE2 stimulates the biosynthesis of IL-6, and proinflammatory cytokines including
  IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α stimulate the biosynthesis of the acute-phase protein CRP,
  increase HPA-axis activity and reactivity, and serotonin metabolism (5-HIAA). This
  proinflammatory signaling pathway is downregulated (−) by dietary n-3 fatty acids
  (i.e., α-linolenic acid), which competes with and decrease Δ6-desaturase-mediated
  LA→AA biosynthesis. Mood-stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic medications, as well
  as LCn-3 fatty acids, decrease PLA2-mediated AA mobilization from phospholipids,
  and aspirin and celecoxib decrease COX-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis. Different antidepressant
  medications have been found to augment PLA2-mediated AA turnover, without altering
  COX enzyme activity or PGE2 production, and to downegulate serotonin metabolism
  (5-HIAA).5-HIAA: 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid; AA: Arachidonic acid; COX: Cyclooxygenase;
