caption: Scheme that represents a model for metabolic utilization of acetyl-CoA and
  malonyl-CoA by FAS and Pfa pathways. In a cell carrying the Pfa system, there is
  competition for substrate, acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA between Pfa and FAS biosynthetic
  pathways. Malonyl-CoA is mostly consumed by FAS synthase for canonical FA production.
  Partial inhibition of the initial step of FAS activity either by gene deletion (KO,
  red cross) or cerulenin enzymatic inhibition (block sign) increases DHA production
  due to lower consumption of the substrates by FAS, which accumulate in the cytoplasm
  and can be redirected to the alternative Pfa pathway. KS ketosynthesis, KR ketoreduction,
  DH dehydration, ER enoylreduction

  Pfa genes.
