caption: Potential mechanisms by which hyperleptinemia influences cardiac function,
  and potential association with the JAK/STAT pathway according to the results of
  our study. Hyperleptinemia may exert maladaptive effects through hemodynamic factors,
  such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, metabolic and inflammatory changes,
  including dyslipidemia, reduced cardiac output, or structural cardiac changes, such
  as myocardial hypertrophy.
