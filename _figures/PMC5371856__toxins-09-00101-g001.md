caption: Schematic of outer membrane protein-mediated pathogenesis. (A) BabA interacts
  with Lea antigen and enhances CagA translocation via the Type 4 secretion system
  (T4SS). HopQ interacts with CEACAMs, and is essential for CagA translocation. BabA
  and HopQ might interact with the T4SS in the membrane region of H. pylori, although
  this is unclear. (B) Absence of sLex antigen expression in the healthy stomach.
  H. pylori infection induces β3GnT5 expression in gastric epithelial cells and biosynthesis
  of the sLex antigen; sLex localizes to the membrane region of gastric epithelial
  cells. As a result, H. pylori can colonize by utilizing SabA, which interacts with
  the sLex antigen. Although the detailed mechanism is unclear, TNF and the T4SS are
  suggested to induce β3GnT5 expression. (C) OipA is suggested to induce phosphorylation
  of EGFR, leading to activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Akt-related signaling.
  Activated FAK induces actin stress fiber remodeling via the MAPK and Erk1/2 signaling
  pathway. In addition, phosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO transcription factors
  and induce IL-8 production. The binding partner of OipA and whether OipA can cooperate
  with the T4SS are unclear.
