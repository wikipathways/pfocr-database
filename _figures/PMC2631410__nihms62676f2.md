caption: Biosynthesis of (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine moiety (3) of
  C-1027 (1, boxed). (A) A sub-cluster of genes within the C-1027 gene cluster that
  encode biosynthetic proteins for 3 production and (B) proposed biosynthetic pathway
  for 3 from L-α-tyrosine (2) and structures of 1 and engineered analogs 7, 8, and
  9.
