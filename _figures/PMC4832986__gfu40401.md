caption: Schematic representation of complementary renoprotective actions of ACEi/ARB
  and vitamin D in chronic kidney disease. Vitamin D may provide renoprotection through
  RAAS-mediated effects, i.e. by suppression of renin gene expression. This effect
  is through VDR signaling. The second renoprotective pathway of vitamin D is through
  reduction of TGF-beta/SMAD signaling. Negative regulation indicated by blue arrows,
  positive regulation by red arrows. ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor;
  ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; TGF-beta,
  transforming growth factor-beta. See text for references.
