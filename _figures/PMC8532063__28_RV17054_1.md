caption: 'Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides (TGs) in TG-rich lipoproteins
  (TGRLs), such as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and chylomicrons (CMs) to
  liberate free fatty acids (FFAs), which are utilized by peripheral tissues (e.g.,
  muscle, heart, and adipose tissues). Activity of LPL is regulated by a quaternary
  structure (monomer/dimer/oligomer) as well as by multiple LPL-pathway proteins 210-212)
  . LMF1 is required for the synthesis of LPL in parenchymal cells of these peripheral
  tissues. GPIHBP1 is a transmembrane protein that tethers LPL on the endothelial
  cell surface to provide a platform for TG hydrolysis. GPIHBP1 captures LPL in the
  subendothelial (interstitial) space of peripheral tissues, transports LPL from the
  subendothelial surface to the luminal surface of endothelial cells by transcytosis,
  and anchors LPL on the luminal surface facing the bloodstream to facilitate lipolysis.
  For the hydrolytic activity of LPL, two apolipoproteins, apoC-II and apoA-V, are
  required. ApoC-II is necessary for the enzymatic activity of LPL. ApoA-V primarily
  enhances the interaction between TGRL and LPL by forming TGRL-apoA-V-GPIHBP1-LPL
  complex via its dual binding affinity to TGRL and GPIHBP1. Defects in LPL pathway
  proteins (LPL, LMF1, GPIHBP1, apoC-II, apoA-V) due to genetic mutations or autoantibodies
  cause primary chylomicronemia (PCM). LPL activity can be measured after releasing
  LPL from the luminal surface into the circulation by i.v. injection with heparin.
  Abbreviations: apoA-V, apolipoprotein A-V; apoC-II, apolipoprotein C-II; GPIHBP-1,
