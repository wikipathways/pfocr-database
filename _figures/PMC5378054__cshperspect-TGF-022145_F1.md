caption: 'The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and its context-dependent
  regulation. (Left) A schematic diagram of TGF-β signaling. (Right) TGF-β signaling
  is regulated at several levels by context-dependent factors: (1) Different combinations
  of paired type I and type II receptors allow for diverse ligand binding as well
  as intracellular signaling. (2) Accessory proteins at the plasma membrane that regulate
  the binding efficiency and specificity of TGF-β to their receptors influence downstream
  responses. (3) Proteins that regulate the recruitment and access of R-Smads to TGF-β
  receptors. (4) Several proteins regulate TGF-β signaling by posttranslational modification
  of R-Smads or by preventing their association with TGF-β receptors. (5) A specific
  TGF-β response can be determined by the expression and activity of transcription
  cofactors.'
