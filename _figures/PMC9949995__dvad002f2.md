caption: 'The folate and methylation pathway. Folic acid enters the cell through the
  FOLR1, which is upregulated with injury. The folic acid molecule is then converted
  into the active tetrahydrofolate (THF) form by DHFR. This allows the eventual production
  of nucleotides and certain amino acids, as well as the transfer of the methyl group
  into the methionine-methylation cycle. The latter occurs through the B12-dependent
  MS step. Subsequently, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the substrate used by the methyltransferase
  enzymes for the methylation reactions. The inhibition of FOLR1, DHFR, MS, and DNMT
  suppresses CNS regeneration. In turn, the activation of DNMT enhances CNS regeneration
  (MTX: methotrexate; 3-ABA: 3-aminobenzamide; SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine) (reproduced
  from previous publication) []'
