caption: 'NK-1R induces signal transduction through the activation of G proteins.
  Heterotrimeric G proteins consist of three different subunits: the Gα subunit that
  binds GDP/GTP, and the Gβ and Gγ subunits that form the Gβγ complex. The binding
  of an agonist (in this case Substance P) to NK-1R induces the activation of G proteins
  which in turn induce their own signaling cascade, such as the activation of the
  MAPK pathway or the phosphorylation of c-Src. The activation of the MAPK pathway
  in turn contributes to raising MMP secretion, which increases the cleavage of membrane-anchored
  ligands that in turn will bind the EGFR receptor. On the other hand, c-Src directly
  phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tails of both EGFR and HER2, allowing the binding
  of scaffold proteins that will further activate signal transduction. Based on our
  results, we propose that this direct phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tails of
  EGFR and HER2 by c-Src may overcome the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or
  antibodies or molecules against extracellular domains [], since c-Src may act independently
  of EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinase activity. This figure has been made using Servier
