caption: This schematic proposes a role for SPCA pumps in Ca2+ loading of Golgi-derived
  vesicles in microcalcification of breast tumor cells. Pi can enter the cell through
  the Na-Pi cotransporter and can be shuttled into organelles. Whereas both SPCA isoforms
  function to concentrate Ca2+ into the Golgi and secretory vesicles, only SPCA2 activates
  store-independent calcium entry (SICE) through the Orai1 Ca2+ channel. Accumulation
  of Ca2+ and Pi ions leads to precipitation of hydroxyapatite crystals inside vesicles.
  The vesicles are trafficked to the plasma membrane to be released to the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) where the ions can react with exogenous hydroxide ions (OH−) to form
  microcalcifications. These crystals, together with bone matrix proteins, lay down
  a foundation for mineralization.
