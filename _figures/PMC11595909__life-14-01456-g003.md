caption: 'LIF signaling mechanism upon binding to LIF receptor that is constituted
  by LIFRβ and gp130 heterodimer. This binding process activates the RAS signaling
  pathway that stimulates Raf, followed by MEK and ERK signals. Another signaling
  process is via the PIK3 signaling process stimulated by the PIP2 and PIP3 conversion
  that activates AKT and mTOR signals. Both pathways produce various cellular responses,
  including (a) oligodendrocyte maturation and proliferation; (b) remyelination; and
  (c) oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation. Abbreviations: LIF, leukemia-inhibitory
  factor; LIFRβ, leukemia-inhibitory factor receptor β; gp130, glycoprotein 130; RAS,
  rat sarcoma; Raf, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP2/PIP3, phosphatidyl-(4,5)-bisphosphate/phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate;
  AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin'
