caption: The representative miRNA-gene network interactions between the genes with
  an altered expression levels when comparing tumor to normal tissue and their respective
  miRNAs, generated using miRNet. (A) shows mRNA–miRNA network for down-regulated
  genes in PTC, involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (n = 15, p-value = 0.000212),
  Axon guidance (n = 18, p-value = 0.0359) and basal cell carcinoma (n = 10, p-value
  = 0.0373), while (B) shows mRNA–miRNA network for up-regulated genes in PTC, associated
  with the p53 signaling pathway (n = 16, p-value = 0.0000254), ECM-receptor interaction
  (n = 18, p-value = 0.0000254) and pathways in cancer (n = 29, p-value = 0.0935).
  The genes belonging to these aforementioned pathways are highlighted with blue dots,
  while the red dots represent the genes with altered expressions involved in other
  interconnected pathways. The blue squares represent the miRNAs that target the altered
  genes, where the size of the square is proportional to the number of signaling pathways
  involved (based on KEEG classification).

  description: The representative miRNA-gene network interactions between the genes
    with an altered expression levels when comparing tumor to normal tissue and their
    respective miRNAs, generated using miRNet. (A) shows mRNA–miRNA network for down-regulated
    genes in PTC, involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway (n = 15, p-value = 0.000212),
    Axon guidance (n = 18, p-value = 0.0359) and basal cell carcinoma (n = 10, p-value
