caption: Mechanism of cGAS-STING signaling pathway. STING can be activated by both
  dsDNA and CDNs produced by pathogens. Activated STING transferred from the ER to
  the Golgi apparatus, where STING promotes the phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-κB
  by TBK1. IRF3 and NF-κB then induce the production of type-I IFNs. These cytokines
  then promote the maturation of several immune cells such as dendritic cells, natural
  killer cells, T cells, and macrophages. dsDNA, double-strand DNA; CDNs, cyclic dinucleotides;
  TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B
