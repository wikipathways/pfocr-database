caption: The mTOR and MAPK pathways affect the translatome by modulating the expression
  of specific subsets of mRNAs. Phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs by mTOR leads to their
  dissociation from eIF4E, which stimulates the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G and
  assembly of the eIF4F complex. mTOR also promotes S6K-dependent phosphorylation
  of PDCD4 and eIF4B, which in turn regulate eIF4A levels and activity, respectively.
  eIF4E is the most limiting subunit of the eIF4F complex and is thus critical for
  the recruitment of eIF4A to the mRNA and unwinding of the secondary structure of
  its 5′UTR during ribosome scanning toward the initiation codon. The Ras/ERK pathway
  also regulates eIF4A activity by promoting RSK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4B
  and PDCD4. eIF4E activity is also regulated by MAPK pathways by direct phosphorylation
  of eIF4E by the MNK protein kinases. Although the eIF4F complex regulates the translatome
  at a global scale, each subunit also appears to modulate the translation of specific
  subsets of transcripts. For instance, overexpression of eIF4E appears to selectively
  affect translation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in tumor initiation and maintenance
  (e.g., cyclins, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and BCL-xL). Phosphorylation
  of eIF4E also seems to bolster the translation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved
  in tumor dissemination (e.g., SNAIL and MMP3). Various stresses activate eIF2 kinases
  (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that phosphorylate eIF2 (alpha subunit), which reduces
  global protein synthesis but promotes the translation of mRNAs containing upstream
  open reading frames (uORFs), such as those encoding ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34. eIF4A
  promotes the translation of mRNAs with G/C-rich 5′ UTR sequences, such as the 12-nucleotide
  guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif, which can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Red T-bars
  represent inhibitory signals, whereas black arrows indicate stimulatory signals.
  P denotes phosphorylation. Abbreviations and detailed explanations about this signaling
  network are provided in the text.
