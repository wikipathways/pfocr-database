caption: The NAA and citrate pathways to acetyl-CoA. The NAA-ASPA-ACSS2 pathway to
  acetyl-CoA formation is shown in blue, whereas the citrate lyase pathway is shown
  in red. High NAA levels inhibit ACLY activity in brown adipose tissue, and this
  may turn out to be a more general phenomenon in other cell types including oligodendrocytes
  and certain types of cancer cells. This would shift mitochondrial output of the
  tricarboxylic acid cycle from citrate to NAA, which would in turn activate the ACSS2
  pathway to acetyl-CoA formation. When this pathway is activated in the cell nucleus,
  it can affect the activity of select transcription factors and modulate transcriptional
  activity.
