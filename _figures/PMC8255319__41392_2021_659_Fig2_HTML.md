caption: Metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer cells. KRAS activation and mutant
  TP53 enhance glucose metabolism to provide biosynthetic precursors for anabolic
  pathways, including the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). KRAS activation reprograms glutamine
  metabolism to sustain cellular redox homeostasis by increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio
  and recycling glutathione (GSH) via reduction of oxidized GSH. The BCAT2-mediated
  BCAA catabolism driven by KRAS plays a critical role during pancreatic cancer development.
  Enhanced nutrient salvaging, via the induction of macropinocytosis and autophagy,
  provides energy and regenerative nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, lipids,
  and nucleosides
