caption: Roles of the retromer machinery in the trafficking and metabolism of AD-related
  proteins. Endosomal trafficking plays a key role in the processing of APP and the
  biogenesis of Aβ peptides. Under physiological conditions (left panel), the Aβ peptide
  is synthesized through the proteolytic cleavage of APP by BACE1 (also known as β-secretase)
  and γ-secretase on the plasma membrane, early endosomes, and TGN. Retromer complex
  contributes to the retrograde transport of APP, BACE1, γ-secretase, and related
  proteins (e.g., SorLA and SorCS1) from endosomes. The SorLA-mediated transport of
  APP to the plasma membrane requires the support of SNX27. In addition to the endosomal
  pathway, the retromer might participate in surface recycling of the AMPAR subunit
  GluA1, thereby modulating synaptic plasticity. In AD brains, in which retromer function
  is compromised (right panel), APP, BACE1, γ-secretase, and associated proteins accumulate
  in early endosomes, thereby increasing Aβ production with hypertrophic changes in
  endosomal compartments. Besides the amyloidogenic pathway, retromer malfunction
  perturbs the cell surface recycling of GluA1, which may influence on synaptic plasticity.
