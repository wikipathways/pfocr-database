caption: A model showing association of PAX5, CD19, CD3, p53, Ras, Raf, MAPK and Zap70
  in B-cell and T-cell type non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The (+) sign indicates the positive
  relationship and (?) indicates presumed relationship. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma affects
  B- and T-cell types by modulating their specific markers. In B-cell CD19, PAX5 and
  p53 expression upregulated whereas in T-cell CD3 may have a role in the upregulation
  of ZAP70, Ras, Raf and MAPK. PAX5 positively regulates expression of ZAP70 and ZAP70
  might be a regulatory point of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by Ras-Raf dependent pathway.
  Increased p53 and PAX5 levels induce apototosis which is also supported by upregulation
  of HIF1A and LDH. PAX5, paired box gene 5; CD19, cluster of differentiation 19;
  ZAP70, zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70; RAF, rapidly
  accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase; RAS, rat sarcoma GTPase family; p53, tumour protein
  53; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HIF1A, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
