  T cell activation increases the expression of amino acid transporters that import
  glutamine and arginine. Glutamine catabolism plays a crucial role in regulating
  the differentiation of naïve CD4 + T cells into Th1 cells, Th17 cells, or Treg cells.
  Excessive serine accumulation leads to mTOR hyperactivation and impairs the suppressive
  function of Treg cells. Arginine catabolism fuels polyamine biosynthesis and is
  necessary for maintaining CD4 + T cell subset identity. B The glutamine-glutamate-α-KG

  glutarylation), and removes toxic ammonia in CD8 + T cells. CD8 + T cells require
  methionine and its downstream metabolite SAM to regulate histone methylation, STAT5
  expression, and antitumor responses. Serine and glycine metabolism fuels one-carbon
  metabolism, glutathione generation, and de novo sphingolipid synthesis in CD8 + T
  cells. Tryptophan depletion or supplementation with its downstream product kynurenine
  inhibits T cell proliferation. Arginine metabolism promotes the activation and survival
  of antitumor CD8 + T cells. Arginine methylation in Sm proteins facilitates signal
  transduction by regulating pre-mRNA splicing of IL2rg and JAK3. α-KG α-ketoglutarate,
