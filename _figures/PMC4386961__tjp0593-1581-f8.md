caption: Model for coincidence detection during classical conditioningThe signalling
  pathways shown are simplified to focus on the coincidence detection function of
  the receptors described here. Pairing of the CS and US during conditioning induces
  two distinct postsynaptic processes. First, there is direct activation of the AC–cAMP
  cascade through the G protein-coupled adenosine 2A receptor; and secondly, these
  receptors phosphorylate TrkB through transactivation by using the Src family tyrosine
  kinases. Phosphorylation of TrkB recruits it to the membrane within 5 min of paired
  nerve stimulation, where it stimulates the activity of PI3K and PDK1 in a conditioning-dependent
  manner. The accumulation of cAMP through direct activation of A2A acts to release
  the catalytic subunits of the PKA holoenzyme, allowing it to become phosphorylated
  by the convergent activity of PDK1 that is required for downstream substrate phosphorylation
  by PKA to initiate the signal transduction cascade that underlies conditioning.
  Alternatively, unpaired nerve stimulation activates p75NTR receptors and the sphingomyelin
  signalling pathway that results in a reduction in PI3K and PDK1 activity. Interestingly,
  this pathway is also controlled by A2A receptors, which immunoprecipitate with p75NTR,
  possibly through a unique form of transactivation (i.e. transinhibition).
