caption: (A) In neoplastic mast cells, mutant Kit is trafficked to the PM along the
  secretory pathway and then moves to endolysosomes through endocytosis. Kit activates
  Akt only on endolysosomes as previously described (Obata et al., 2014). Note that
  M-COPA inhibits the activation of Akt through blocking ER export of Kit. STAT5 activation
  is enhanced by M-COPA because it is activated by ER-localized Kit. HM, high mannose;
  CG, complex glycosylation. (B) Tyr568/570, Tyr703, Tyr721, and Tyr936 in Kit are
  phosphorylated on the ER in neoplastic mast cells.
