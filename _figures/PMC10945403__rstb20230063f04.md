caption: Immune signalling pathways and the specific transcriptional responses of
  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to bacterial and fungal challenge. (a) Simplified representation
  of the Imd signalling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster (left) and Ae. aegypti
  (right). (b) Simplified representation of the Toll signalling pathway in D. melanogaster
  (left) and Ae. aegypti (right). Receptors and transducers are depicted in purple;
  inhibitors and inhibitory domains in red; terminal transcription factors in yellow.
  Aedes aegypti possesses many genes encoding spaetzles and Toll receptors (in grey);
  the exact genes that mediate the initiation of Toll signalling in the context of
  infection remain uncertain. The precise molecular signals that activate Imd and
  Toll signalling remain undetermined in mosquitoes. While many genes have been shown
  to be transcriptionally regulated by Rel2 and Rel1 in mosquitoes, there is still
  uncertainty over which genes are specifically regulated by one pathway versus the
  other. (c) Live and heat-killed bacteria (including Gram-negative and Gram-positive
  species) promote disproportionate (as compared to fungi) upregulation of defensins,
  cecropins and holotricin (GRRP) in Ae. aegypti by an undetermined signalling pathway.
  (d) Fungal pathogens promote disproportionate (as compared to bacteria) upregulation
  of glycine-rich putative antimicrobial peptides by an undetermined signalling pathway
