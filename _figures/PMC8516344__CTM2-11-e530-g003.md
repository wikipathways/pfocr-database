caption: Cardiac voltage‐gated L‐type calcium channel (Cav1.2) and Ryr2 structure,
  accessory proteins and signaling. (A) The contribution of inward current ICaL (upper)
  mediated by Cav1.2 to action potential (AP) Phase II (lower). (B) The L‐type calcium
  channel Cav1.2 is formed by the interaction of the pore‐forming α1 core subunit
  with auxiliary subunits, including α2δ and intracellular β. The α1 subunit consists
  of four homologous domains with a voltage sensor S4 and pore‐forming S5 and S6 in
  each domain and connected by cytoplasmic linkers (ICLI‐II, ICLII‐III, and ICLIII‐IV).
  The β subunit is localized exclusively at the cytosolic face of the channel and
  its GK domain interacts with the α‐interaction domain (AID) of the α1 subunit I‐II
  loop to mediate Cav1.2 trafficking by antagonizing ER retention signals. The α2δ
  subunit binds to extracellular regions, including domain III of the α1c subunit.
  δ is linked with a larger α2 polypeptide via a disulfide bridge. The α1 subunit
  interacts with several proteins, receptors and subunits of other channels. The amino‐terminal
  domain NTD, ICLI‐II and carboxyl‐terminal domain (CTD; LZ motif) of Cav1.2 interact
  with AKAP. PKA and β2‐AR CTD also bind to AKAP. PP2A binds to site next to S1928
  in the CTD. CaM binds to the IQ motif. KChIP2, an accessory subunit of Kv4.3, directly
  interacts with the inhibitory module at the NTD of the Cav1.2 α1 subunit. The Cav1.2
  β subunit interacts with the AID of the α1 subunit I‐II loop. The β‐AR/cAMP/PKA,
  β1‐AR/CaMKII, TrkB R/CaMKII signaling pathways are involved in modulating the expression
  and function of Cav1.2 in the heart. PKA‐related phosphorylation pathway (red arrows)
  and CaMKII‐related phosphorylation pathway (purple arrows). (C) RyR2 is a large,
  square, homotetramer in the configuration of a four‐leaf clover. Each subunit of
  the homotetramer consists of a large cytosolic domain (called the foot structure),
  which is responsible for interaction with protein modulators, and CTTD. Four identical
  carboxyl‐terminal transmembrane domains (CTTDs) are responsible for forming the
  central ion‐conducting pore. RyR2 is located beneath Cav1.2 in T‐tubules and is
  connected with α1 subunit of Cav1.2 by sorcin. In addition, CaM and FKBP12/12.6
  also interact with the cytosolic foot structure. Kinase (PKA, CaMKII) and phosphatase
  (PP1 and PP2A) exert phosphorylation/dephosphorylation effects on Ryr2. Type 2 calsequestrin
  (CASQ2) interacts with the luminal surface of Ryr2 to increase the open probability.
  In addition, class A of trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC‐A) channels on the SR
  membrane directly interact with the cytosolic region of RyR2 (Figure ) via its carboxyl‐terminal
  tail domains to facilitate Ca2+ release from the SR
