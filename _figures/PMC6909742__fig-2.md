caption: Skeletal muscle Nox2 implicated in insulin resistance and exercise adaptation.
  (A) Skeletal muscle expresses Nox2, Nox4, and DUOX1/2. (B) In obesity and diabetes,
  Nox2 is upregulated. Increased Nox2 levels and ROS production induced by hyperglycemia
  and hyperlipidemia contribute to skeletal muscle insulin resistance, potentially
  through reduced insulin activation of Akt. (C) In response to exercise, an ATP-PKC
  pathway activates Nox2 leading to cellular adaptation, potentially mediated through
  PGC-1α. Akt, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
  Color images are available online.
