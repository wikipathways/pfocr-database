caption: Effect of BM polarity on procession of recombination intermediates. A, in
  the RAD51 pathway, a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is processed by 5′ end resection
  to produce DNA with a 3′ ssDNA tail. RAD51 (gray ovals) forms a filament with an
  exposed 3′ ssDNA tail and promotes DNA invasion to form JMs. After DNA repair synthesis,
  JMs are then either extended or dissociated through BM by specialized enzymes (blue
  shape). B, in the RecA pathway, a lesion (X shape) in the leading strand of DNA
  replication results in a stalled replication fork, exposing a region of ssDNA. The
  RecA filament (gray ovals) forms on the exposed ssDNA and promotes invasion with
  the lagging strand template, forming JMs. Then RuvAB (blue shape) will extend JMs
  through BM in the 5′→3′.
