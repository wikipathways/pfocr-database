caption: 'Regulation of gene activity through microRNA-mediated repression of translation
  accompanied by post-translational regulation of microRNA targets. (A) The conserved
  RNA-binding protein LIN-28 indirectly (indicated by the dotted line break) regulates
  the transcription () and activities () of let-7-family (mir-48, mir-84, mir-241)
  microRNAs, which inhibit the synthesis of HBL-1. LIN-28 also represses the expression
  of LIN-46 ( preprint), which controls the nuclear accumulation of HBL-1. Temporal
  downregulation of LIN-28 at the end of the L2 stage allows LIN-46 to accumulate,
  which acts together with the let-7 family microRNAs to ensure precise and robust
  temporal downregulation of HBL-1 activity. (B) Hypothetical activity trajectories
  of a microRNA and its target(s) against time are plotted. Dashed blue lines represent
  the trajectory in the absence of the hypothetical post-translational regulator.
  Black arrows indicate a specific critical time when the target must be downregulated
  to permit normal development. A post-translational regulator of a microRNA target
  can increase the precision of temporal downregulation of the target (red arrow,
  left) or confer robustness against irregularities in microRNA expression (red arrow,
  right). This second scenario is similar to what is thought to happen in C. elegans
  larvae developing in the presence of pheromones or other L2d-inducing conditions:
  let-7-family expression is delayed (; ) and LIN-46 activity becomes more important
  for downregulating HBL-1 (). Thus, LIN-46 confers robustness against a physiological
  delay in the expression of let-7 family microRNAs.'
