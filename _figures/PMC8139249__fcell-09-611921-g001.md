caption: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), TGF-, and FGF-dependent SMADs pathways
  for regulation of stem cell differentiation. TGF- super-family members binding to
  the receptors which propagate phosphorylation signal to receptor-regulated SMAD
  proteins (R-SMADs in blue). BMP signaling occurs through SMADs 1/5/8 phosphorylation
  and TGF- signaling through SMADs 2/3 phosphorylation. Once activated, their binding
  with the common partner (Co-SMAD in green) SMAD 4 results in complexes which translocate
  to the nucleus to activate other transcription factors and regulate specific genes
  expression. MSX2, NCAM, and HOXA2 expression leads to the differentiation of ESCs
  whereas Oct4, NANOG, and SOX2 expression contributes to the undifferentiated proliferation.
  BMP signaling negatively regulates TGF- signaling via the expression of the inhibitory
  SMAD 6 (I-SMAD in orange). FGF signaling promotes TGF- receptor (TGFBR1) activation,
  resulting in self-renewal transcription factors activation and, in turn, FGF expression.
  FGF signaling also directly represses SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, inhibiting the
  BMP pathway.
