caption: Influences of apoptosis and pyroptosis on the progression of pneumoconiosis.
  The activation of Fas/FasL pathway mediated by silica results in apoptosis. Cytochrome
  c can lead to the combination of APAF-1 and pro-caspase 9, resulting in the enzymatic
  cascade and apoptosis. Caspase-3 is activated by caspase-8, initiating a caspase-cascade
  and cell apoptosis. The inhibition of Caspase-12 results in apoptosis. TNFR1/Phox
  interaction inhibits the formation of mtROS, reducing macrophage apoptosis. TNF-α,
  NO, and exosomes are also involved in the development of apoptosis. Pyroptosis is
  mediated by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
