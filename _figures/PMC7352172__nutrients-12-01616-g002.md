caption: Activation of the NMRK2 pathway represent a common adaptive mechanism in
  the failing heart where NAD+ levels are low. NAD+synthesis from NR through the NMRK2
  pathway may be favored, as the NMN synthesis from NR by NMRK enzymes requires only
  one ATP molecule while synthesis from NAM by NAMPT requires at least three ATP equivalents.
