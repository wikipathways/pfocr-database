caption: PkcA is shown in its activated form, according to the S. cerevisiae model.
  Activation occurs after the dissociation of the interaction between C1, C2 and pseudosubstrate
  site (ψ), possible after the priming phosphorylation of the protein at the C-terminal
  kinase (AGC kinase signature) domain (see text for details), by unidentified kinases
  in A. fumigatus. The domain organization of the protein and color scheme is shown
  as in . The HS and congo red (CR) response is thought to emerge mainly from the
  MidA mechanosensor located at the cell membrane and funneled into Rom2, a guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor and the small Rho GTPAse Rho1, leading to the activation
  of PkcA. In the likely absence of DAG stimulation of fungal PkcA via C1 domain,
  Rho1 can be the linking component that tethers C1A and C1B PkcA domains to the cell
  membrane, thus suggesting the importance of C1B domain, where the G579R mutation
  is located (red line). This polypeptide region is important for the interaction
  of Hsp90 with PkcA since this interaction is abolished in the PkcAG579R isoform
  (right). A. fumigatus Rho1 is also an Hsp90 client (data not shown in this study).
  For all recorded physical interactions, Hsp90 chaperone is shown as a homodimer
  (green) in its closed state, i.e., bound to ATP since we recorded here all the structural
  and thermodynamic signatures of this protein and ATPase activity. PkcA activates
  unknown downstream targets in A. fumigatus and the MAP kinase cascade (green arrow),
  which ends in the quick activation of MpkA upon HS. MpkA is a constitutive Hsp90
  client. The phosphorylation of MpkA is highly dependent on a fully functional PkcA
  (left). MpkA migrates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates the TF
  RlmA. RlmA is also an Hsp90 partner and the MpkA/Hsp90/RlmA complex reside in the
  nucleus under physiological or HS condition. Transcriptional targets of RlmA involved
  in the CW integrity and HS response are activated. HS (right) stimulates the migration
  (disappearance) of wild-type and mutated PkcA from the cytosol’s hyphal tips. The
  return (recruitment) of PkcAG579R isoform is faster in comparison to the PkcA isoform.
  Although this model does not explain if PkcA located at the hyphal tip or other
  cell compartment under basal conditions is enzymatically active, the faster recruitment
  of PkcAG579R to the original sites may suggest an inefficient function of the mutated
  isoform due to the overall alterations in the polypeptide structure that potentially
  impacts the C1 domain. This diagram is based on data from this article and the following
