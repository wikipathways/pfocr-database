caption: 'Orexins/OXR system-modulated signaling patways involved in anti-inflammatory,
  neuroprotective and anti-tumoral effects. The orexin/receptors system may trigger:
  (1) anti-inflammatory functions through the inhibition of NFκB and the activation
  of PLC/Ca2+ pathways, (2) in the CNS, neuroprotective actions via the inhibition
  of caspases 3/7 by Akt pathway and (3) in the context of cancer, anti-tumoral effects
  through the activation of caspases 3/7 by SHP2 signaling pathway ().'
