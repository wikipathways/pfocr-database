caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical regulation of HIF signaling. a Oxygen- dependent
  regulation of HIF-α. Under normoxic condition, the ODD module within HIF-1α will
  be degraded via binding to VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which consisting of pVHL,
  Cullin 2 (Cul-2) and Elongin B. This process is mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway, which α-ketoglutarate-dependent PHDs catalyze the hydroxylation of ODD
  domain which is recognized by VHL, eventually leading to proteasomal degradation
  of HIF-α. More, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) inhibits the binding of p300 to HIF-α
  by hydroxylating asparagine residue within C terminal domain, which play a role
  of inhibition on HIF-α activity. b Regulation of the HIF pathway at mRNA and protein
  level. In hypoxic conditions, inhibition of PHDs promote the heterodimer formation
  consisting of HIF-α and ARNT. Extracellular signaling TNF-α stimulates I-κB kinase
  (IKK) complex which is comprised of IKKα and IKKβ, and other normal TNF signaling
  (NIK), which contribute to p65/50 complex and p52/RelB complex formation. Many other
  components NF-κB together activate target genes, including HIF-α, and further induce
  inflammation. More, PI3K, PDK and PKB activation induced by growth factors (GFs)
  activates mTOR pathway results in elevated HIF-α transcriptional activity. And phosphorylation
  of FoxO1 PI3K/PKB, which is transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, prevents
  FoxO1 from acting on HIF-α. G9a/GLP methylates HIF-1α protein and inhibits HIF-1α
  activity within solid tumors, making it unable to bind to the hypoxic response element
  (HRE) of its target genes, resulting in inhibition of the downstream HIF pathway.

  to the activation of polymerase II, which ultimately activates HIF-1α target genes
  transcription. IκB, nuclear factor of κB inhibitor, alpha; IKK, IκB kinase; 4EBP1,
