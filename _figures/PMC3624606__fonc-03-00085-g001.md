caption: '(A) Oncogenes and tumor suppressor modulate metabolic reprograming in cancer
  cells. HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; TIGAR, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis
  regulator; MYC, Proto oncogene c-Myc; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLS2,
  glutaminase 2. (B) Proposed model highlighting the role of PI3K-Akt-mTOR and Wnt
  pathways in regulation of the cell cycle progression in cancer cell: according to
  the presented model, activation of insulin/IGF receptor by nutrients/growth factors
  activates PI3K-Akt pathway. Akt phosphorylated on T308 activates mTORC1. One of
  the downstream target of mTORC1, the p70S6Kinase, phosphorylates the serine residues
  on IRS and inhibits the insulin/IGF signaling in a regulatory feedback control.
  The activated mTORC1 activates the protein synthesis, but inhibits autophagy. Inhibition
  of autophagy rescues Dvl and this lead to activation of Wnt pathway. The activated
  Wnt pathway up regulates cyclin D and C-Myc, which trigger the activation of cell
  cycle and metabolic reprograming. The metabolic activation in cancer cells leads
  to the production of reaction oxygen species (ROS), which activate the FoxO. FoxO
  is the transcription factor of rictor, one of the key components of mTORC2 recognized
  as the kinase phosphorylating Akt on S473. Rictor also inhibits c-Myc, which according
  to the present model is required for exit of G1/S restriction point. Akt, protein
  kinase B (T308, S473 are the phosphorylated sites Threonine 308 and Serine 473 of
  Akt), c-Myc is the oncoprotein activated by Wnt signaling, FoxO, fork head transcription
  factors of O group; GLUT, glucose transporter; IGF, insulin growth factor; IRS,
  insulin receptor substrate; mTORC1, 2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex
  1 and 2, PIP2, phosphoinositide 4,5 bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphoinositide 3,4,5 trisphosphate;
  rictor, a component of mTORC2; P70S6K, the p70 ribosomal S6K; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome ten; ROS, reaction oxygen species; PDPK1
  (also abbreviated as PDK1), phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase.'
