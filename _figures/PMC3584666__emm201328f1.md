caption: Overview of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. When TLRs are
  stimulated by their respective ligands, they dimerize and recruit downstream adaptor
  molecules, such as myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88),
  MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL), Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), which
  activate other downstream molecules leading to the activation of signaling cascades
  that converge at the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interferon (IFN) response factors
  (IRFs) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. These molecules induce the transcription
  of several proinflammatory molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12, and
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The secretion of these molecules counters the threat
  posed by microbes and helps activate other immune components. AP1, activator protein
  1; ATF, activating transcription factor; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; IKK, inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer
  in B-cell kinase; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MD, myeloid differentiation factor; MKK, MAPK kinase; NA,
  nucleic acid; TAB, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7-binding
  protein; TAK, transforming growth factor-activated kinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1.
