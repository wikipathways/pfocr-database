caption: RBP-j-dependent and independent Notch signaling is required for proper epidermal
  differentiation and lipid biogenesis in the skin to form a competent barrier. The
  RBP-j-independent signals may be non-cell autonomous. Embryonic loss of Notch signaling
  leads to aberrant epidermal differentiation/lipid biogenesis and, therefore, the
  defective barrier formation. In response, TSLP is released by keratinocytes that
  fail to differentiate, triggering a systemic B-LPD in newborns that results in neonatal
  lethality at the highest level.
