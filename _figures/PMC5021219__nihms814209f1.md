caption: 'Upon cytokine binding, JAK2 molecules are recruited and activated by cytokine
  receptors, which results in phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways such
  as PI3K, RAS, and STAT3/5. STAT heterodimers and homodimers translocate to the nucleus
  and bind cognate DNA sequences at the promoter regions of genes involved in proliferation
  and apoptosis. In the presence of JAK2V617F mutations, the JAK/STAT pathway is constitutive
  activated. JAK2 inhibitors abrogate the JAK/STAT pathway through the inhibition
  of the kinase activity of JAK2V617F kinase. The activity of the JAK2/STAT pathway
  is negatively regulated by SOCS1 and LNK. Recently, JAK2 and JAK2V617F kinase have
  been shown to localize to the nucleus of hematopoietic precursors where it phosphorylates
  histone H3 (H3Y41), thus preventing its binding to the repressor heterochromatin
  protein 1 alpha (HP1α). The latter results in increased expression of the oncogene
  lmo2. These effects are reversible upon exposure to JAK2 inhibitors. JAK2V617F also
  binds and phosphorylates the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, which hampers its
  interaction with methylosome protein 50 (MEP50), thus decreasing global arginine
  methylation of histones H2A and H4. The figure is modified from Quintás-Cardama,
  et al (reference #)'
