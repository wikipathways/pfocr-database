caption: 'The proposed photorespiratory pathway within the context of photosynthetic
  carbon and nitrogen metabolism. The solid red lines represent reactions of the photorespiratory
  pathway, the solid blue lines represent reactions of the proposed alternative photorespiratory
  pathway, the solid purple lines represent reactions of amino acid synthesis, and
  the dotted lines represent associated transport processes. Numbered reactions are
  catalyzed by the following enzymes: 1. Rubisco, 2. Malic enzyme, 3. Phosphoglycolate
  phosphatase, 4. Glycerate kinase, 5. Glycolate oxidase, 6. Glutamate:glyoxylate
  aminotransferase, 7. Glycine decarboxylase complex, 8. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase-1,
  9. Serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, 10. Hydroxypyruvate reductase-1, 11. Malate
  dehydrogenase, 12, Nitrate reductase, 13 Nitrite reductase, and 14. Glutamine synthetase.
  PETC designates photosynthetic electron transport chain and RETC, respiratory electron
  transport chain. Adapted from ref. []. Copyright 2018 Springer Nature Ltd.'
