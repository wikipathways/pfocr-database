caption: (A) Dachs might bridge Zyx and Wts within a trimeric complex; the simplest
  version of this model (stoichiometric amounts) would predict that in order for Zyx
  to be co-precipitated with Wts, Dachs and Zyx levels within the complex would have
  to be equivalent, which was not observed. (B) Dachs might induce a conformational
  change in Zyx (either directly through binding as shown or by recruiting other factors),
  exposing the LIM domains and enabling them to bind Wts. (C) illustrates the distinct
  roles of the LIM-domain proteins Zyx and Jub in Hippo signaling. Zyx influences
  the levels of Wts protein, presumably by promoting Wts degradation, whereas Jub
  inhibits Wts activation. The ability of Zyx to interact with Wts is regulated by
  Dachs, and Dachs in turn is regulated by Fat.
