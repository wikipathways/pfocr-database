caption: FAM72A antagonizes UNG2 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to reduced
  processing of the AID-induced dU in Ig genes, which leads to increased G:U mismatches.
  The increased G:U lesions can either be replicated to produce transition mutations
  at G:C basepairs, or can engage the mismatch repair system to enhance mutagenesis,
  or provide DNA lesions, in collaboration with UNG2 that are required for CSR. In
  the absence of FAM72A, the protein expression and enzymatic activity of UNG2 are
  enhanced, resulting in increased excision of dU, which favors faithful repair by
  base excision repair pathway, as evidenced by diminished mutation frequencies in
  both μ switch region and JH4 region. Furthermore, the accelerated removal of dU
  in the context of FAM72A deficiency fails to recruit the mismatch repair system
  in the G1 or S phase, which is required for both CSR and SHM. One question that
  arises, is why doesn’t CSR increase with increased UNG2 protein/activity in Fam72a−/−
  B cells? The key is the engagement of the MMR system by FAM72A to induce CSR. First,
  deleting FAM72A in Msh2−/− CH12 cells and Msh2−/− spleen B cells moderately increases
  CSR (, ) consistent with an increased UNG2 level and activity inducing larger number
  of breaks to facilitate CSR. Importantly, CSR is not increased to WT levels. For
  SHM, the increased UNG2 activity in Fam72a−/− B cells would cause an increase in
  ssDNA breaks in the V-region, but ultimately lead to faithful repair of the dUs,
  thereby erasing many AID-induced uracil lesions. Second, removal of either Ung or
  Msh2 leads to a defect in CSR that is not additive suggesting an interaction between
  these two proteins during CSR (, ). For SHM, UNG and MMR pathways converge to induce
  error-prone repair. The exact mechanism likely involves the interruption of faithful
  MMR repair by uracil excision by UNG2. The interaction between these both pathways
  has not been formally shown in CSR, although there was evidence for this notion
  in the literature (e.g. see  in). As to how MMR and UNG2 work together to induce
  CSR is not clear, and requires more work, but the mechanism might be similar to
  that hypothesized to what occurs during SHM. For CSR, we therefore hypothesize that
  FAM72A antagonizes UNG2, leading to the accumulation of U:G mispairs that can be
  engaged by the MMR system to induce CSR.
