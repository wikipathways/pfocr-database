caption: EMT-related signaling pathways in mediating radioresistance. EMT regulated
  by a variety of signaling pathways plays an important role in inducing ridioresistance
  of tumor cells. PI3K/Akt pathway participates in the regulation of Snail and Twist.
  PI3K/Akt activation can also increase phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation
  of GSK-3β, thus decreasing its degradation to Snail. Wnt/β-catenin signaling can
  promote the radioresistance by increasing nuclear translocation of β-catenin and
  transcriptional upregulation of EMT-related genes expression. TGF-β signaling can
  regulate the expression of EMT markers to induce EMT by Smad or non-Smad-dependent
  ways, thus enhancing the resistance of cancer cells to irradiation. Notch signaling
  can increase the expression of ZEB1, Slug, Snail, NF-κB and Vimentin to promote
  the EMT phenotype. NF-κB pathway has the important roles in EMT-mediated radioresistance.
  It is involved in the regulation of EMT genes such as Twist, Slug and SIP1. IL-6/JAK/STAT6
  pathway can induce EMT by mediating ZEB1 and EMT-related markers, resulting in enhanced
  tumor resistance to radiotherapy.
