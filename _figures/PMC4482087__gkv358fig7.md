caption: 'The rewired upstream transcription subnetwork in regulating the downstream
  pentose phosphate pathway in biomass conversion in Y-50049 yeast strain versus the
  wild-type. In the rewired upstream transcription subnetwork identified by ChiNet
  (P-value = 1.97 × 10−14), orange edges are significantly rewired transcription regulation;
  blue edges are significantly conserved transcription regulation; and short dashed
  edges are known transcription regulation but may be inactive. Oval nodes represent
  known TFs: those over-expressed in Y-50049 are in red, darker for strongly over-expressed;
  those under-expressed in Y-50049 are in green, darker for strongly under-expressed.
  In the downstream metabolic pathway, the square boxes labeled with enzyme commission
  numbers represent enzymes. Those in green are annotated. Those with an accompanying
  orange box with gene name were measured in our gene expression experiment. The open
  circles indicate metabolites. Edges associated with boxes and circles together represent
  enzymatic reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway diagram is based on KEGG Pathway
  ().'
