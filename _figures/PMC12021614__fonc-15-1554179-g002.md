caption: 'Multiple mechanisms of circRNA in tumor immunomodulation and immunotherapy.
  1. miRNA Sponge: circRNAs (e.g., circIL4R) bind to specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-761),
  alleviating the translational repression of target mRNAs, thereby influencing tumor
  cell proliferation and invasion. 2. Signaling Pathway Regulation: circRNAs participate
  in regulating key signaling pathways (e.g., TGFβ/SMAD) by modulating the activity
  of transcription factors (e.g., SMAD2/3/4), further affecting cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and immune responses. 3. Immune Cell Polarization: Certain circRNAs
  (e.g., circPOLQ) can influence the polarization of macrophages into M1 or M2 phenotypes,
  shaping the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment through the secretion
  of cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGFβ, M-CSF, IL-35). 4. Immune Evasion: circRNAs (e.g.,
  circ_0020397) interact with immune checkpoint pathways such as the PD-1/PD-L1 axis,
  promoting tumor cell evasion from immune surveillance and destruction. 5. Potential
  Therapeutic Targets: circRNAs (e.g., circPTK2) play a critical role in regulating
  tumor cell proliferation and immune responses, making them promising targets for
  novel strategies in tumor immunotherapy through modulation of their expression or
  function'
