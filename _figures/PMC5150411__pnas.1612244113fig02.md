caption: 'Metabolic landscape in the deep subsurface. Bubbles represent the gas in
  the fracture head space, with font size representing the relative abundance of the
  species. Radiolytic species are originated from the rock. Blue, yellow, and brown
  arrows, respectively, represent the N, S, and C metabolic pathways detected, with
  the large arrows representing the principal pathways and the smaller arrows representing
  the less expressed. CBB stands for Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle, the dominant CO2
  fixation pathway. Circles are numbered to show various microbial taxa and are colored
  based on their phylogenetic origins: 1 for Sulfuritalea- and Sulfuricella-like taxa,
  2 for Thiobacillus- and Thauera-like taxa (class β-proteobacteria); 3 for Rhodospirillaceae
  (class α-proteobacteria); 4 for Ectothiorhodospiraceae, 5 for Methylococcaceae (class
  γ-proteobacteria); 6 for Brocadiaceae (phylum Planctomycetes); 7 for Desulfobulbaceae
  and Desulfovibrionaceae (class δ-proteobacteria); 8 for Bacillaceae, 9 for Peptococcaceae
  including Candidatus Desulforudis (phylum Firmicutes); 10 for ANME, 11 for methanogenic
  Methanosarcinaceae (phylum Euryarchaeota). Orange bars indicate S–N coupling due
  to the abundant autotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing, denitrifiers Sulfuritalea, Thauera,
  Thiobacillus, and Sulfuricella. Isotopic data () are given in rectangles.'
