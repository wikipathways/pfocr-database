caption: (A) Representation of the evolutionarily conserved Man gene cluster and its
  corresponding enzymes involved in the conversion of Mannose to GDP-Fucose in Escherichia
  coli and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. (B) Reorganization of the genes within the
  Pathway into functionally relevant modules (GCMs) by considering gene context information.
  The GCM ‘D-Mannose to GDP-L-Fucose’ was present in E. coli and its corresponding
  pfams for the chosen cut-off and window size are highlighted in (C). (D) Absence
  of the module in B. thetaiotaomicron.
