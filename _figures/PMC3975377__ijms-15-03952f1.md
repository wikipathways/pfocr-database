caption: Hypothetical model to describe the mechanisms and outcomes of MAPK activation
  induced by different levels of ROS. If a pro-apoptotic stimulant induces release
  of ROS that is high enough to quench MKP, this may lead to prolonged JNK activation
  and apoptosis (B); Low levels of ROS may lead to transient activation of JNK due
  to presence of active MKP and end up in a protective response (A). The specific
  pathway mediating activation of Mst1 is unclear. ROS, reactive oxygen species; MAP3K,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; MAP2K, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; Mst1,
  mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1.
