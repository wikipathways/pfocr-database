caption: Summary of cell wall recycling gene expression and proposed mechanism of
  synergistic mechanism of imipenem and fosfomycin combination in A. baumannii A10
  (A) and AB250 (B). The cell wall recycling expressions in Fig.  were summarized
  in this scheme. Green and red symbols are represented the gene expression in the
  presence of 0.5× fosfomycin MIC and in the combination of 0.5× fosfomycin MIC and
  1× imipenem MIC, respectively. Upward arrows, downward arrows, and equal arrows
  are represented upregulation, downregulation, and not change of expression compared
  to without antibiotic, respectively. Question marks and dash arrows are represented
  the proposed results that did not determined. Red words in the boxes are represented
  metabolites in the cell wall recycling pathway. Blue words in the boxes are represented
  metabolites in the de novo cell wall synthesis.
