caption: 'The Vick and Zimmerman pathway leading to the synthesis of jasmonic acid,
  and the concurrent AOS and HPL reactions. Pathway intermediates are indicated as
  follows: 13-HPOT, (9Z11E15Z13S)-13-hydroperoxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid; EOT,
  12,13(S)-epoxy-9(Z),11,15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid; ODA, 12-oxo-cis-9-dodecenoic
  acid; OPDA, cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid. Enzymes are indicated as follows: AOC,
  allene oxide cyclase; AOS, allene oxide synthase; HPL, hydroperoxy lyase; LOX, 13-lipoxygenase.
  Note that EOT is short-lived and spontaneously disintegrates into volatile α-ketols
  and γ-ketols as well as racemic OPDA.'
