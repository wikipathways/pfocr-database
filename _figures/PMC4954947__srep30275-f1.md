caption: Phospholipase C, activated by G-protein-coupled receptors, hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
  4,5 biphosphate (PIP2) to produce the two secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which activate cellular responses. DAG is
  phosphorylated to give phosphatidic acid (PA) and then ligated to a cytidine giving
  cytidine monophosphorylphosphatidate (CMP-PA). The latter can be attached to a myo-inositol
  molecule and form phosphatidylinositol (PI) which can be then converted to PIP2.
  IP3 then undergoes a series of hydrolysis to generate inositol monophosphates, from
  which the final hydrolysis of myo-inositol monophosphate (IP) to inositol and inorganic
  phosphate (Pi) is catalyzed by myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase). Released free
  inositol (I) is then recycled into PIP2. IMPase is also involved in the de novo
  synthesis of inositol by converting glucose-6-phosphate into IP.
