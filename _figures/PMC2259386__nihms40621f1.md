caption: The prototypical myelin-derived neurite growth inhibitors, their receptors
  and intracellular signaling pathway. Oligodendrocyte-expressed Nogo, MAG, and OMgp
  all bind to GPI-anchored protein NgR1, which recruits co-receptor p75 or TROY and
  LINGO-1 to form a receptor complex to transduce the inhibitory signals in neurons.
  MAG also binds to NgR2, where the identity of co-receptors has not been confirmed.
  In neurons, the NgR1 receptor complex stimulates the dissociation of Rho-GDP from
  GDI and the subsequent formation of active Rho-GTP, which with additional downstream
  effectors leads to rearrangement of cytoskeletons to inhibit neurite outgrowth.
  Other downstream effectors for axon growth inhibition include PKC and EGFR, which
  are related to calcium influx. However, cAMP/PKA plays an opposite role by relieving
  the growth inhibition.
