caption: 'An overview of the antiviral pathway of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). A:
  Process of viral infection. Enveloped viruses invade through fusion and endocytosis,
  whereas naked viruses enter the cell through endocytosis. The vesicles of some viruses
  rely on the endosomal pathway, which requires fusion with late endosome/lysosome
  to release viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. Subsequently, viral nucleic acid
  synthesizes proteins to assemble virions, a process in which some proteins mature
  through post-translational modifications (PTMs). B: Activation of interferon (IFN)
  stimulated genes-cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) antiviral pathway relying on
  the IFN signaling pathway. After induction by viral dsRNA/LPS/Poly (I:C), Toll-like
  receptors 3/4 recruits an adaptor protein, Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  IFN β, to dimerize with it and stimulate expression of IFN α/β. IFN α/β binds to
  the IFN α receptor and promotes the expression of CH25H via the JAK-STAT pathway
  to catalyze cholesterol to 25HC. C: Antiviral pathways of 25HC. First, 25HC alters
  cholesterol homeostasis to impede viral internalization and the release of viral
  nucleic acids. Second, 25HC disturbs the PTMs of proteins, causing the formation
  of abnormal viral protein.'
