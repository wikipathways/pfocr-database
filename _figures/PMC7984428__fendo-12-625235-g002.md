caption: Simplified canonical model of NMD pathway activation (A) in human cells which
  is controlled by three different ways so far and yet to be identified (B). Inter-individual
  variation of NMD efficiency due to transcript variants modifies the presentation
  of clinical phenotypes and response to the PTC read-through drug PTC124 treatment
  (B). At early ER stress, UPR suppresses NMD to provide maximum capacity of UPR proteins
  replenishment. Once ER stress is being resolved, the UPR is downregulated, while
  NMD is supposed to return to its normal activity to eliminate unproductive transcript
  isoforms, thereby leading to further downregulation of the UPR as UPR transcripts
  isoforms are NMD specific targets. Unresolved ER stress induces apoptosis which
  in turn suppresses NMD pathway to execute the cell to avoid deleterious outcomes
  (C) (, , , ).
