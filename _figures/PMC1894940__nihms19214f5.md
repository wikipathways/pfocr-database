caption: Inhibition of COX-2 modulates multiple functional pathways during acute inflammation
  and pain. Theoretical schematic diagram depicts the genes and their pathway modulated
  by rofecoxib treatment during acute inflammation. Besides inhibiting COX-2 activity,
  rofecoxib may also produce its anti-inflammatory effect through (1) up-regulating
  annexins and SOD2 expression, which directly suppress the activity of phospholipase
  A2; (2) up-regulating SOCS3, which inhibit cytokine signaling by negative feedback
  regulation of JAK/STAT cascade; (3) down-regulation of the gene expression IL1 and
  C3. However, by shunting down the cyclooxygenase pathway and reducing COX-2-derived
  PGs production, rofecoxib may induce the over-expression of the pro-inflammatory
  mediators (4) leukotrienes (indicated by the thicker solid lines), and (5) IL6 and
  CCL2 (MCP-1). The latter may play a critical role in the development of the adverse
  effects attributed to COX-2 inhibitors. The solid lines indicate facilitation and
  the dashed lines indicate inhibition.
