caption: Akt regulates numerous biological functions by phosphorylating distinct protein
  substrates. For instance, Akt protects cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating and
  inactivating proapoptotic proteins, such as Bad and Foxo3a. Akt regulates cell growth
  and protein translation by phosphorylating and inactivating TSC2, resulting in activation
  of the mTOR pathway. Akt regulates cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis by phosphorylating
  and activating oncogenic proteins, such as Skp2, Mdm2, and IKKα. Akt can orchestrate
  glucose metabolism by regulating the activity of GSK3β. Akt may also regulate cell
  migration by inducing the phosphorylation and activation of Skp2, Girdin/APE, ACAP1,
  and PAK1.
