caption: 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway with heatmaps showing fold changes
  in the expression of genes encoding key enzymes in this pathway. (a) Exud vs. NExud;
  (b) M7 vs. NM7; (c) M28 vs. NM28. Key enzymes encoded by DEGs that were annotated
  in metabolic pathways are shown in red. An enzyme highlighted in yellow indicates
  that both upregulated and downregulated genes encode the enzyme. An enzyme that
  is not highlighted in yellow indicates that no genes encoding the enzyme were annotated.
  Enzymes: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate transferase; C3H, coumarate
  3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA-O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase;
  F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl
  alcohol dehydrogenase.'
