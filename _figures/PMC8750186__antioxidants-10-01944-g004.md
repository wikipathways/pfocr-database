caption: Intracellular FH interacts with factors associated with the proteasomal pathway
  and the RB1/E2F pathway. The hTERT-RPE1 lysates were incubated with either unspecific
  immunoglobulin G (control) or anti-FH antibody, and immunoprecipitation was perfromed
  using protein-G labeled agarose beads. Proteins were purified and digested with
  trypsin before mass-sprectrometric analysis. (a) Experimental workflow. (b) Gene-ontology
  analysis using Enrichr [] identified the proteasomal pathway and cell cycle as the
  most represented pathways. (c) Protein-protein interaction network analysis via
  Metascape [] defined two clusters of FH interacting factors. Cluster 1 included
  members of the 20S/26S proteasome (PSMD13, PSME3, PSMB6, PSMB3, PSMA3), cluster
  2 included factors involved in RB1/E2F signaling and cell-cylce control (E2F3, E2F4,
  TFDP2, TFDP1, RB1).
