caption: Mitochondrial TCA as the hub for integrating metabolism and signaling in
  the aging network. The four hub metabolites (red boxes) are interconnected via the
  mitochondrial TCA cycle. NAD+ is utilized during the TCA cycle to generate NADH
  and is regenerated during oxidative phosphorylation and during formation of lactate
  from pyruvate. NAD can also be produced by dietary supplementation of precursors
  of NAD such as nicotinamide (NAM) that is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT). NADP is synthesized
  from NAD via the enzyme NAD kinase (NADK) that is localized to the cytoplasm and
  mitochondria. NADPH is generated during the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and
  used in biosynthetic and redox responsive pathways. αKG is a TCA intermediate, either
  generated from pyruvate or from glutamine by the enzyme αKG dehydrogenase (αKGDH).
  βHB, a ketone body, serves as an anaplerotic source for acetyl‐CoA in the TCA cycle.
  It is generated during starvation/fasting via the β‐oxidation of lipids in the liver
  and transported to tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain or can be generated
  by ketogenic amino acid (e.g., BCAA during exercise).
