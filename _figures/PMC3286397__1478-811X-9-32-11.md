caption: Model for C. jejuni-induced signaling leading to Cdc42 activation and bacterial
  invasion. C. jejuni adheres to host cells via the fibronectin-binding protein CadF,
  which acts as a bridge engaging the integrin-β1 receptor. Integrin occupancy and
  clustering in lipid rafts leads to recruitment and activation of the non-receptor
  tyrosine kinase FAK. Phosphorylation of FAK and Src triggers a cascade of signals
  resulting in the formation of protein complexes leading to activation of other signaling
  factors as indicated. Assembly of integrin-dependent signal complexes leads to phosphorylation
  and transactivation of PDGFR and EGFR, followed by stimulation of PI3-K and Vav2.
  Activated Vav2 then induces the activation of Cdc42. This signaling potentially
  causes localized actin and/or microtubule rearrangements at the site of C. jejuni
  entry, resulting in bacterial uptake. In addition to CadF, the C. jejuni flagellum
  also appears to play a role in the described signal cascades. If the flagellum participates
  by sole bacterial motility, by translocating bacterial effector proteins or targeting
  a host receptor directly is not yet clear and needs to be investigated in future
  studies.
