caption: Cortisol biosynthesis and the first reported forms of Congenital Adrenal
  Hyperplasia (CAH). Identifying urinary metabolites and defining these conditions
  confirmed the postulated adrenal biosynthetic pathway determined by in vitro experimentation.
  The first form of CAH investigated was 21-hydroxylase deficiency [], followed by
  11β-hydroxylase deficiency [] and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency [].
  LAH patients [] essentially had absence of urinary metabolites, with adrenal cholesterol
  build-up. 17-Hydroxylase deficiency [] was the final form defined during the classical
  era. The major urinary metabolites are shown in italics, steroid hormones and their
  precursors in conventional script
