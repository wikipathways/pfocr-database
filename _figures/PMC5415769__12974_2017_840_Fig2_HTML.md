caption: Canonical pathways form groups for each individual protein. The table on
  the left contains the name of each pathway in the cluster, as well as the proteins
  for which the pathway enriches. To illustrate the interrelationships of the proteins
  in each cluster with upstream regulators determined by IPA, the proteins that enriched
  for the pathways in clusters 1, 2, and 3 as well as upstream regulators were visualized
  as a network using IPA. Downstream proteins that were detected in the proteomics
  experiment are denoted by fold change and p values beneath them. Red color indicates
  an upregulation and green a downregulation with color intensity related to expression
  value. Upstream regulators are listed in the table to the right of the figure and
  contain the downstream proteins effected. Upstream regulator are colored with orange
  (upregulation) or blue (downregulation). The lines connecting various proteins are
  meant to describe the predicted effect that the observed change has on that particular
  relationship. A blue line would suggest that due to the differential expression
  of the upstream protein, it is having an inhibitory effect on the downstream target.
  With this graphic representation of the networks, the complex interactions and nodes
  of intersection can be presented. For example, note that RICTOR, one of the top
  upstream regulators identified, is central to both clusters 1 and 2
