caption: NAADP produced by CD38 and angiogenesis. Type II CD38 is expressed on the
  cell surface and internalized into endolysosomes through endocytosis. Endolysosomes
  provide an acidic environment where NADP and nicotinic acid are transformed into
  NAADP by base exchange reaction. NAADP acts on Ca2+ channels of Endolysosomes to
  promote the release of Ca2+ (as a second messenger), which is conducive to angiogenesis
  and tumor cell metastasis. VEGF binds with its receptors VEGFR2 to stimulate the
  release of Ca2+ by VEGFR2/NAADP/TPC2/Ca2+signaling pathway leading to angiogenesis.
