caption: For simplicity purposes, the corrin ring is represented as a rhomboid, and
  lower ligands hydroxyl groups or water molecules are not shown. AdoCby, adenosylcobyric
  acid; AdoCbi-P, adenosylcobinamide-phosphate; AdoCbi-GDP, adenosylcobinamide-GDP;
  AdoCbl-P, adenosylcobalamin-phosphate; AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; AP-P, aminopropanol
  phosphate; DMB, 5, 6-dimethylbenzimidazole; NaMN, nicotinate mononucleotide. CbiP
  (AdoCby synthase) and CbiB (AdoCbiP synthetase) catalyze the last two steps of the
  de novo corrin ring biosynthetic pathway. CobU (AdoCbi kinase/AdoCbi-P guanylyltransferase),
  CobS (AdoCbl-P synthase), CobT, NaMN:DMB phosphoribosyltransferase, and CobC (AdoCbl-P
  phosphatase) comprise the nucleotide loop assembly pathway, also known as the late
  steps. CobA (ATP :Co(I)rrinoid adenosylytransferase) is the housekeeping corrinoid
  adenosylating enzyme required for de novo corrin ring biosynthesis, and for the
  salvaging of incomplete corrinoids like cobinamide. The phenolic substrates for
  ArsAB and the resulting Cbas synthesized using the α-phenolic-ribotide products
  are highlighted in black and white. Structures of O-glycosidic phenolic ligands
  are shown next to corresponding cobamide name. Phenolic ligands do not form a coordination
  bond with the Co ion of the ring.
