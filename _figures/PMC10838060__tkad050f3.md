caption: cGAS-STING and JAK–STAT pathways. JAK is activated after receiving the ligand.
  When the ligand leptin produced by adipocytes is transmitted to the brain, the brain
  will transmit the signal to promote energy metabolism and reduce appetite. When
  the ligand is IFN produced by the cGAS-STING pathway, cascade reactions will generate
  IFN-I/III and finally generate SASP; this pathway is inhibited by cytokine SOCS1/3
  and USP18. Furthermore, in diabetes, JAK–STAT activation will lead to decreased
  insulin sensitivity and obesity-related inflammation, but ABT317 and RNase7 can
  inhibit it. cGAS cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, cGAMP 2′3′cyclic GMP–AMP, STING stimulator
