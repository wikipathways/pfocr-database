caption: Ameliorative Management Strategies for DTP Tumors. A, B The focused approach
  is prevention/reversal of DTP status and induction of DTP death. On the one hand,
  we can prevent or reverse the DTP state through strategies such as regulating the
  transcriptional process, blocking the DTP survival pathway, and inhibiting the DTP
  apoptotic escape. On the other hand, methods to induce DTP death include increased
  intracellular stress, cell cycle and DNA damage-related death, and metabolism-related
  cell death. C Based on scientific, mathematical, and computer science-based mathematical
  models, the optimal drug regimen for the individual patient can be determined, including
  the dose, time, route, and frequency of administration, as well as the time and
  interval of withdrawal. D Immune surveillance or attack of DTP also plays an important
  role in the management of DTP tumors. These include TKI-induced immune cell recruitment,
  STING checkpoint, PD- 1/PD-L1 inhibitor, anti-fibrosis/ECM strategy, adaptive TCR
  or CAR-T, and personalized cancer vaccines and healthy lifestyle. Image made with
