caption: Proposed signaling pathways underlying the BK channel downregulation through
  E3 ubiquitin ligases in coronary smooth muscle cells. In diabetes, increased PKC
  stimulation overproduced ROS, which inhibits the PI3k/Akt pathway. Decreased Akt
  phosphorylation suppresses FOXO-3a and then upregulates FBXO expression. Nrf2 is
  downregulated in diabetic coronary smooth muscle cells. Decreased Nrf2 upregulates
  NF-κB and MuRF1. FBXO and MuRF1 are muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, which
  enhance the ubiquitination and the degradation of the BK β1-subunit. The coronary
  vasoconstriction in diabetes is increased due to the impaired BK channel expression
  and function. PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PI3k, phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinases; FOXO-3a, the forkhead box O family transcription factor-3a; FBXO, F-box
  protein; Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B;
  MuRF1, muscle RING finger protein 1.
