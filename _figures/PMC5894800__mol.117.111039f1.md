caption: Enzymes and binding proteins involved in vitamin A and retinoic acid metabolism.
  Endogenous concentrations of the depicted retinoids in human serum are from prior
  reports (; ; ) and are shown in parenthesis under each retinoid. For all-trans-retinaldehyde
  (atRAL) no concentrations in human serum have been reported and hence concentrations
  in mouse serum are provided. The metabolic pathway is adapted from previous publications
  (; ). ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; CRBP, cellular retinol
  binding protein; LRAT, lecithin retinol acyltransferase; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase;
  REH, retinyl ester hydrolase.
