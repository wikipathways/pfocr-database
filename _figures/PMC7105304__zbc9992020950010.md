caption: Schematic diagram of leptin-mediated MTP regulation through long- (ObRb)
  and short- (ObRa) forms of leptin receptors. Leptin exerts its effects by binding
  to cell-surface receptors and activating its downstream signaling mediators. Upon
  binding to the long-form of leptin receptor (panel A), which is abundantly expressed
  in the enterocytes, leptin activates the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase
  resulting in JAK2 autophosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of tyrosine
  residue Tyr1138 of the receptor. pY1138 recruits STAT3, phosphorylates it resulting
  in the dimerization of phosphorylated STAT3 and translocation to the nucleus to
  mediate transcriptional events that result in decreased expression of MTP by unknown
  mechanisms. The short-form leptin receptor, which is ubiquitously expressed, lacks
  the cytoplasmic domain necessary for STAT3 signaling (panel B). Short-form leptin
  receptor in the liver may signal through the ERK-MAPK pathway to activate downstream
  signaling transcription factors that increase the expression of MTP.
