caption: CD4+ T cells are T lymphocytes that express T cell receptors (TCRs) recognising
  peptide antigens presented in the context of Class II major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC II) molecules. CD4+ T cells express the TCR co-receptor CD4, which binds to
  the β2 domain of MHC II and facilitates TCR engagement with peptide-MHC II complexes
  on antigen-presenting cells []. During thymic development, the cell fate of developing
  thymocytes is decided by their TCR affinity for self-peptide-MHC complexes presented
  by thymic epithelial cells. Thymocytes that have little to no affinity for self-peptide
  do not initiate activating signals from their TCR complexes and thus die by neglect.
  Conversely, thymocytes with high self-reactivity are negatively selected and deleted
  by apoptosis. Thymocytes with intermediate TCR affinities below the negative selection
  threshold receive positive selection via activating TCR signals and complete thymic
  maturation as naïve conventional T cells (TH0). Some thymocytes with moderately
  high affinities to self-antigen are redirected into the regulatory T cell (Treg)
  developmental pathway, where they acquire immunosuppressive function to regulate
  tissue homoeostasis and resolution of immune responses [, ]. Upon receiving cues
  from the cytokine milieu together with TCR activation, naive CD4+ T cells upregulate
  expression of key transcription factors regulating subset differentiation, which
  in turn drive the expression of major effector cytokines associated with each particular
  subtype [, ]. Key transcription factors and cytokines involved are indicated for
  individual subtypes. CD4+ T cells augment the development of the CTL response [,
  ] and are required for the development of CD8+ T cell immunity (reviewed extensively
  here []) in their role as central co-ordinators of adaptive immunity. Unlike CD8+
  T cells, whose primary function is to mediate cell contact-dependent cytotoxicity
  of infected or malignant cells, CD4+ T cells exhibit a diverse repertoire of effector
  functions and exhibit considerable phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity depending
  on local context and microenvironment [, ]. CD4+ T cells activated in the periphery
  can also differentiate into induced Tregs (iTregs), which are able to mediate immunosuppression
  similar to thymic Tregs (tTregs).
