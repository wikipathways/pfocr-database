caption: Rb1 pathway. Chart shows the pathway in which Rb1 protein blocks cell cycle
  progression. This pathway may be disrupted in patients with glioblastoma by direct
  mutation of Rb1, which makes it ineffective, or through overexpression of cyclin-dependent
  kinase 4 (CDK4), which occurs either directly or by deletion of CDKN2A, which inhibits
  CDK4.
