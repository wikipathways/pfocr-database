caption: Working model of the PLV pathway in maize (green gene names) and Arabidopsis
  (black gene names). The graph shows both C18:3-derived (A) and C18:2-derived (B)
  PLV synthesis. Dashed arrows indicate hypothetical reactions. Alcohol dehydrogenase
  (ADH), acetyl transferase (AT), reductase (RED), non-enzymatic (NE), isomerase (ISO).
  The names of biologically relevant PLVs are blue, the names of trace PLVs are black,
  and the names of 13-carbon compounds () are orange. Adapted from .
