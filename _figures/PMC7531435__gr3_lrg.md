caption: 'Integrin Crosstalk with the Clathrin Machinery Regulates Adhesion Turnover,
  Mechanotransduction, and Endocytosis.Microtubules deliver clathrin adaptors that
  trigger disassembly of focal adhesions (FAs) and recruit the integrins and their
  ligands into clathrin-coated pits [,]. Binding of clathrin adaptors to integrins
  is also involved in the formation of the more static flat clathrin lattices (FCLs),
  which develop when αvβ5 forms stable interactions with immobilized vitronectin;
  this prevents the formation of pits and thereby ‘frustrates’ the endocytic process
  [,,]. These structures depend on high rigidity of extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands,
  but are associated with low intracellular tension, as they do not depend on myosin
  II-activity []. Yet, increases in cytoskeletal tension, for example, by guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1/RhoA-mediated actomyosin contractility in response
  to microtubule depolymerization, stimulate FA assembly and integrin translocation
  from the FCLs to FAs [,]. Abbreviations: AP, adaptor protein; ARH, autosomal recessive
  hypercholesterolemia; Dab2, Disabled-2; EPS15, epidermal growth factor receptor
  pathway substrate 15.'
