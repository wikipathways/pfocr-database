caption: VEGF signaling pathways and their role in the pathogenesis of MPE. VEGF increases
  vascular permeability and promotes tumor angiogenesis by binding to one of its three
  receptors VEGFR1, −2 and −3 on vascular endothelial cells. Upon activation, the
  VEGFR undergoes phosphorylation and subsequently activates cell type-dependent signaling
  cascades, including PLC, PI3K, NOS and MAPKs. Many factors of the local tumor environment
  may contribute to the induction of VEGF expression in tumor cells, including the
  occurrence of hypoxia and presence of various growth factors (e.g., VEGF and IL-6).
  Hypoxia can activate hypoxia-associated transcription factors, including HIF-1,
  resulting in transcription of the VEGF gene. Through its role in regulation of vascular
  permeability and angiogenesis, VEGF serves a central role in the accumulation of
  pleural effusion in tumor patients. HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; IL, interleukin;
