caption: 'Plant responses to oxygen deprivation: (A) Physiological and hormonal responses
  to soil flooding where gs is stomatal conductance, E is transpiration rate, and
  A is the photosynthesis rate; (B) ethylene and N-degron pathway coordinate the tissue
  response to both normoxia and hypoxia O2 conditions, C* indicates the modification
  of Cys to Cys-sulfinic acid in the presence of O2; and (C) molecular players involved
  in the interaction of the core abscisic acid (ABA) signaling with O2 conditions
  at molecular level in higher plants.'
