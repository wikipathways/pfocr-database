caption: Proposed pathway for RQ biosynthesis in C. elegans. Either 3HAA or AA are
  proposed to be arylamine precursors to RQ. The Q biosynthetic enzymes, COQ-2 and
  COQ-6, may be used to form the common precursor, 2-amino-3,4-dihydroxy-5-nonaprenylbenzoic
  acid (compound 4). O-Methylation of compound 4 can be achieved using a S-adenosylmethionine–dependent
  methyltransferase, most likely COQ-3. The resulting compound 5 must be decarboxylated
  and hydroxylated, respectively, using the COQ enzyme(s), which would be analogous
  to those used in the Q biosynthetic pathway, to form the final 1,4-hydroquinone
  precursor to RQH2 (compound 6). The COQ-5 C-methyltransferase is proposed to catalyze
  the final methylation step to form RQH2, which can be oxidized to RQ. In C. elegans,
  R represents a tail with nine isoprenoid units (n = 9).
