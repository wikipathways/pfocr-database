caption: Endothelial Nogo-B is a critical mediator of hypertension and vascular dysfunction
  through negative regulation of sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis. Endothelial-derived
  S1P has a crucial function in flow-mediated vasodilation through an autocrine S1P1-eNOS
  signaling axis. S1P is transported out of endothelial cells, where it activates
  S1P1-eNOS pathway in an autocrine fashion, leading to NO production and blood pressure
  regulation. Left, in the absence of Nogo-B, SPT activity is enhanced and endothelial
  cells produce increased amounts of S1P, resulting in increased flow-mediated vasodilation
  and decreased basal tone. Myriocin, a specific inhibitor of SPT, and W146, an S1P1
  antagonist, reinstate the normal response to blood flow and pressure in Nogo-A/B-deficient
  resistance arteries. SEW2871, an agonist of S1P1, lowers blood pressure in hypertensive
  mice. Right, the lack of Nogo-B in smooth muscle cells leads to an increase in sphingolipid
  biosynthesis and ceramide levels, resulting in decreased myogenic tone. EC, endothelial
  cell.

  description: Endothelial Nogo-B is a critical mediator of hypertension and vascular
    dysfunction through negative regulation of sphingolipid de novo biosynthesis.
    Endothelial-derived S1P has a crucial function in flow-mediated vasodilation through
    an autocrine S1P1-eNOS signaling axis. S1P is transported out of endothelial cells,
    where it activates S1P1-eNOS pathway in an autocrine fashion, leading to NO production
    and blood pressure regulation. Left, in the absence of Nogo-B, SPT activity is
    enhanced and endothelial cells produce increased amounts of S1P, resulting in
    increased flow-mediated vasodilation and decreased basal tone. Myriocin, a specific
    inhibitor of SPT, and W146, an S1P1 antagonist, reinstate the normal response
    to blood flow and pressure in Nogo-A/B-deficient resistance arteries. SEW2871,
    an agonist of S1P1, lowers blood pressure in hypertensive mice. Right, the lack
    of Nogo-B in smooth muscle cells leads to an increase in sphingolipid biosynthesis
    and ceramide levels, resulting in decreased myogenic tone. EC, endothelial cell.
