caption: Working model for DAF-7/TGFβ pathway modulation of dauer formation in larvae
  and of germ line mitosis in the adult. The DAF-14 and DAF-5 Smads are components
  of dauer signaling, but are not involved in DAF-3-mediated feedback repression of
  daf-7 and daf-8 transcription. The DAF-7 ligand activates the DAF-4 and DAF-1 receptors,
  which in turn activate DAF-8. Genetic data showing that DAF-8 inhibits the DAF-3
  Co-Smad to prevent dauer formation in larvae is extended here by demonstration of
  direct protein-protein interactions between DAF-8, DAF-14 and DAF-3. In adults,
  DAF-8 acts independently of DAF-14 and DAF-3 to repress (directly or indirectly)
  lag-2 transcription. The adult pathway for modulation of germ line mitosis does
  not involve DAF-14 or DAF-3. Although we have not shown directly that DAF-1 signals
  to DAF-8 to inhibit adult germ line mitosis, it is a likely candidate because DAF-1
  is co-expressed with DAF-8 in DTCs, and daf-1(m40) shares the extended mitotic zone
  phenotype with daf-8 (see Fig. S2A in the supplementary material).
