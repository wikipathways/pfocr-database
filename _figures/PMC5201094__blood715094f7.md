caption: A hypothetic model illustrating the pivotal role of CD37 status for R-CHOP
  outcome in DLBCL and the important molecular mechanisms for R-CHOP resistance in
  CD37−DLBCL and CD37+ABC-DLBCL. (A) Antiapoptotic and immune escape mechanisms existed
  in both CD37+ and CD37− DLBCL before R-CHOP treatment. Comparably, CD37+ DLBCL had
  higher frequencies of ABC cell of origin and CXCR4 overexpression, whereas CD37−
  DLBCL had higher frequencies of TP53 mutations and nuclear p50, STAT3, and Myc (only
  in GCB-DLBCL) overexpression. (B) CD37 positivity independently predicted favorable
  outcome, likely because CD37+ DLBCL is sensitive to R-CHOP owing to the increased
  CD20 and ICOSLG whereas decreased PD-1 expression (depicted by green 1, 3, and 2,
  respectively), as well as CD20-independent CD37 function in enhancing antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis upon CD20-rituximab ligation (*). This
  favorable impact can be hindered by ICOSLG and MHC-II downregulation, upregulation
  of PD-L1, AICDA, LILRA/B, IL10/IL10RA, and antiapoptotic pathways downstream of
  the chronic active BCR signaling in ABC-DLBCL. (C) CD37 loss robustly predicted
  poor survival. Rituximab efficacy is limited due to decreased CD20 levels (depicted
  by yellow 1, with postulated reasons of attenuated BCR, cytokine, and trogocytosis)
  and loss of CD37-rituximab signaling. The significantly worse prognosis is also
  contributed by 1 increased PD-1 (highlighted by yellow 2), ICOSLG downregulation
  (highlighted by yellow 3), and frequent TP53 mutations, Myc, STAT3, or p50 overexpression
  in CD37− DLBCL (which were probably oncogenic drivers acquired during lymphomagenesis
  and further escaped from immune surveillance by various mechanisms as depicted).
  Illustrated immune escape mechanisms include upregulation of PD-L1/L2, LILRB/A,
  TIM3, CTLA4, and the IL6/IL10 pathway, and downregulation of MHC-I/II, CIITA, and
  costimulatory molecules CD58 and CD40. The model is based on our biomarker correlation,
  GEP, and survival analysis, except the speculated CD37 functions during R-CHOP treatment
  as denoted by an asterisk (*).
