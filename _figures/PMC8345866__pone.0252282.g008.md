caption: Our epileptogenic mechanism model shows three target points for potential
  anti-epileptogenic drugs. First, a Wnt inhibitor may target the upstream of this
  pathway, but current treatments do not cross the BBB. Secondly, altered metabolism
  can be targeted by ketogenic diets and Stiripentol. Thirdly, mTOR activation can
  be targeted with mTOR inhibitors (e.g., Sirolimus and rapamycin). Collectively,
  the ideal therapy is a combination and nontoxic therapy aimed at multiple targets
  to alter remodeling and neuronal differentiation during the epileptogenic period
  to forestall the progression of chronic seizures.
