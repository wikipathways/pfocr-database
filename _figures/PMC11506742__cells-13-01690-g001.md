caption: An overview of the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway. The TLR/IL-1R pathway is
  activated following TLR or IL-1R binding to their respective ligands, including
  PAMPs, DAMPs, LPSs, or cytokines from the IL-1 family. This binding triggers the
  recruitment of MyD88 and assembly of the myddosome complex, comprising MyD88, IRAK4,
  IRAK2, and IRAK1. IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, initiating an auto-phosphorylation
  cascade that results in hyperphosphorylated IRAK1. Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1 then
  dissociates from the myddosome complex and associates with TRAF6. IRAK-M functions
  to inhibit the dissociation of IRAK1 from the myddosome. The interaction between
  IRAK1 and TRAF6 activates the IKK complex, leading to the degradation of IκB, which
  releases NF-κB for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Additionally,
  IRAK1 and TRAF6 interaction leads to the assembly of the catalytically active TAK1-TAB
  complex, which activates the MAPK pathway. In addition to activating the IKK complex,
  MAPK activates downstream effectors ERK, p38, and JNK, all of which are involved
  in the transcriptional activation of several inflammatory cytokines through AP-1.
  Moreover, IRAK1 translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates STAT3 at the
  serine 727 residue, promoting the IL-10 gene activation. Created with BioRender.com
