caption: O-glycosylation is initiated by a family of enzymes known as the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide
  N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts); these enzymes catalyze the transfer
  of GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group on Ser or Thr residues (S/T). A
  – Biosynthesis of O-linked glycans of circulatory IgA1 can be initiated by GalNAc-T1,
  2, 11, and possibly by other GalNAc-Ts and followed by addition of Gal from UDP-Gal
  catalyzed by the Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GalT1). Synthesis of the
  stable enzyme C1GalT1 depends on Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase-specific chaperone
  (Cosmc). The Core 1 disaccharide can be elongated with sialic acid residue(s) transferred
  from CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) by sialyltransferases to either Gal
  or GalNAc or both. The reactions are catalyzed by a Galβ1,3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase
  (ST3Gal) and a α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc), respectively. In IgA1-producing
  cells, sialylation of GalNAc is catalyzed exclusively by ST6GalNAc-II ,. Patients
  with IgAN have elevated serum levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1, with some
  of their O-glycans Gal-deficient and, thus, composed of GalNAc or sialylated GalNAc
  . This aberrancy is a result of changes in the activities of two glycosyltransferases,
  decreased C1GalT1 and increased ST6GalNAc-II, in the IgA1-producing cells in the
  patients with IgAN . Sialylated GalNAc represents a terminal step of the O-glycosylation
  pathway, as it cannot be further modified (for review see ). B – Biosynthesis of
  O-linked glycans of MUC1 on mammary epithelial cells is initiated by GalNAc-T1,
  2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, and followed by addition of Gal from UDP-Gal catalyzed by C1GalT1.
  The Core 1 disaccharide can be elongated with sialic acid residue(s) transferred
  from CMP-NeuAc by sialyltransferases to either Gal or GalNAc or both. The reactions
  are catalyzed by a Galβ1,3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) and a α2,6-sialyltransferase
  (ST6GalNAc), respectively. In breast epithelial cells, sialylation of GalNAc is
  catalyzed by ST6GalNAc-I. The Core 1 can be branched by addition of GlcNAc, catalyzed
  by Core 2 β1,6-GlcNAc transferase (C2GnT), and further elongated by β1,4-Gal-transferase
  and β1,3-GlcNAc-transferase. In breast cancer epithelial cells, MUC1 is aberrantly
  expressed, and it contains less Core 2 glycans, more Core 1 glycans, and elevated
  level of sialylated Core 1 glycans and sialylated GalNAc. The aberrant glycosylation
  stems from decreased activity of C2GnT and increased activity of sialyltransferases,
  ST3Gal and ST6GalNAc-I ,,-. Furthermore, ST6GalNAc-I, C1GalT1, and C2GnT compete
  for the same acceptor, GalNAc ,,. Biosynthetic pathway of Core 3 O-glycans is not
  shown for simplicity, as these glycans are relatively uncommon on MUC1.
