caption: Expression analysis of up-regulated differentially expressed genes (UDEGs)
  involved in flavonoids biosynthesis pathway in Glycyrrhiza uralensis under drought
  stress. Blue words represent the identified UDEGs involved in flavonoids biosynthesis
  of G. uralensis under PEG6000-induced drought stress. Different colored blocks indicated
  different expression levels with red and blue to represent high and low levels,
  respectively. PAL, Phenylalanineammonialyase; C4H, Trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase;
