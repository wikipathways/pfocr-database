caption: Proposed model of immunopathogenesis of Borreliella burgdorferi during early
  cutaneous infection. After deposition into the skin by the tick vector, B burgdorferi
  are detected by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of resident innate immune cells, notably
  tissue macrophages (histiocytes) and dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines that recruit leukocytes from the peripheral blood and
  drive the differentiation of interferon (IFN)-γ-expressing Th1 cells. Calprotectin,
  an antimicrobial heterodimer (S100A8/S100A9) secreted by keratinocytes, mononuclear
  cells, and granulocytes may contribute to immune cell recruitment. Some spirochetes
  are internalized by phagocytic immune cells, possibly via Fc gamma receptors (FCGR1A,
  FCGR1B), and elicit production of type I IFNs through endosomal TLRs and the IRF7
  signaling pathway. Interferon-α and IFN-γ stimulate the expression of IFN-responsive
  genes through JAK/STAT signaling and, in combination, shape the development of IDO1-expressing
  tolerogenic DCs that drive the differentiation of regulatory T cells through tryptophan
  depletion. Borreliella burgdorferi may exploit the resulting localized immunosuppression
  to promote hematogenous dissemination to distal tissues. Symbols for genes with
  significantly elevated expression in EM biopsies relative to control skin are indicated
  in red font.
