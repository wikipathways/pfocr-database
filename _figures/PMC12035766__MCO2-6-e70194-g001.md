caption: Mechanisms of molecular hydrogen alleviating IBD and intestinal injury. This
  illustration summarizes the process of hydrogen therapy for IBD and the key molecules
  and targets involved in the regulation process. Hydrogen promotes the metabolism
  of dietary fiber into SCFAs by GM, and the resulting SCFAs are absorbed into the
  colon via monocarboxylic acid transport proteins, ultimately providing energy to
  cells in the form of ATP. Bacterial toxins activate TLR expression which further
  activates and phosphorylates NF‐κB, promoting the release of inflammatory factors
  such as TNF‐α, IL‐6, IL‐1β, and so on, while NF‐κB translocates from cytoplasm to
  nucleus inducing transcriptional activation NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles leading
  to increased expression inflammatory factors as well as activation NLRP3 inflammasome
  producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS overload is thought to be involved
  in IBD pathogenesis. Hydrogen not only directly inhibits ROS generation but also
  inhibits the NF‐kB signaling pathway, thus suppressing oxidative stress and inhibiting
  the release of proinflammatory factors. Moreover, hydrogen administration resulted
  in a significant decrease in the expression of eIF2 α, ATF4, XBP1s, and CHOP proteins,
  that is, hydrogen‐inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. As there is an accumulation
  of M1‐like macrophages in the diseased area of IBD patients, which produce proinflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐6, IL‐1β, ROS, and so on, which perpetuate inflammatory
  damage to the intestinal mucosa, hydrogen administration reduces the level of TNF‐α,
  thus slowing down intestinal damage caused by IBD
