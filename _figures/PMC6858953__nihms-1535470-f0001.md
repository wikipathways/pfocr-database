caption: 'Claudins inhibit multiple oncogenic pathways. Left: In normal epithelial
  cells, claudins interact with LATS1/2 to form a complex and suppress YAP/TAZ and
  PDK1 activity. Claudins can also inhibit IGF-1R and AKT. Suppression of YAP/TAZ
  can lead to preserved PTEN activity, resulting in suppression of the PI3K/PDK1/AKT
  pathway. Right: In cancer cells, loss of claudins leads to activation and nuclear
  translocation of YAP/TAZ, as well as activation of the IGF-1R/PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway.
  Activated YAP/TAZ suppress PTEN, further activating PI3K and its downstream effectors.
  Activation of PDK1 and AKT results in nuclear translocation, leading to increased
  cyclin D1. Blue boxes indicate tumor suppressor genes and pink boxes indicate oncogenes.
  Blue lines and boxes indicate suppression and pink arrows and boxes indicate activation.'
