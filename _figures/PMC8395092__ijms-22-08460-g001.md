caption: 'Overview of macrophage metabolism. (A) Classically activated macrophages
  (proinflammatory macrophages [M1]) present a more glycolytic metabolism, even in
  the presence of oxygen. Their increased GLUT-1 transporter enables higher glucose
  influx and enhances pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, which is essential
  for the inflammatory phenotype. The incomplete TCA cycle generates excess citrate,
  which is crucial for de novo lipid synthesis. The membrane of M1 macrophages has
  a high content of saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid. LPS binding to
  TLR-4 activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), responsible for transcription of
  proinflammatory cytokine genes. (B) Metabolism in alternatively activated macrophages
  (anti-inflammatory macrophages [M2]) mainly produces ATP via the TCA cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) fueled by fatty acid β-oxidation. There is low glycolysis
  and PPP activity in this subtype of macrophage. Abbreviations: CD: cluster of differentiation;
