caption: PI3K/AKT and MAPK signal transduction pathway activation in response to IR.
  IR activates the EGFR family of RTKs, which triggers both PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling.
  On the left, activation of RAS by the RTK leads to activation of RAF-1. Active RAF-1
  initiates a cascade of phosphorylation-dependent activation, first of MEK1/2 followed
  by ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation results in the activation of p90rsk, which promotes
  the transcription of anti-apoptotic factors, including miRNAs such as miR-21. Importantly,
  miR-21 targets PTEN, which inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway, promoting PI3K/AKT signaling.
  On the right, the RTK activates PI3K, which, in turn, phosphorylates AKT. Activated
  AKT promotes the transcription of anti-apoptotic factors and inhibits the transcription
  of pro-apoptotic factors. miRNA regulation of the FOXO proteins is shown. Other
  members of the apoptotic pathway will be discussed later in . miRNA regulation is
  extensive in both these pathways. miRNAs that have been bolded indicate miRNAs which
  have multiple targets in the same pathway. Additional underlining identifies miRNAs
  that are involved in almost every pathway of the DDR. Dotted arrow indicates potential
  for a positive feedback loop. ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1/2, MAPK kinase 1/2; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; RAS; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
