caption: 'Schematic representation of the effects induced by Exe plus CBD in MCF-7aro
  cells. This combination compromises the binding of estrogens, produced by aromatase,
  to ERα, decreasing ERα protein levels and the transcription of some ERα-targeted
  genes, including EGR3. The reduction in EGR3 levels inhibits the activation of ERK1/2
  signaling pathway, which prevents the inhibition of pro-caspase-8, that is converted
  to caspase-8, and, together with caspase-9, activates caspase-7, promoting apoptosis.
  Moreover, the effects of the combination on ERα modulate AR through an unknown crosstalk,
  contributing to the decreased EGR3 levels, avoiding the estrogen-like effect. Exe:
  Exemestane; CBD: cannabidiol; A: androstenedione; E: estrogens; ARO: aromatase;
  ER: estrogen receptor; AR: androgen receptor.'
