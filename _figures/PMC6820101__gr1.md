caption: CDP-choline pathway and choline kinase coupled enzyme assay. Synthesis of
  phosphatidylcholine is accomplished by the sequential action of three enzymes, choline
  kinase (CK), which converts choline to phosphocholine, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase
  (CCT), which produces CDP-choline from phosphocholine, and choline phosphotransferase
  (CPT), the enzyme that synthesizes phosphatidylcholine from CDP-choline and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). The coupled assay is one of the traditional methods used to determine choline
  kinase activity. In this assay, the ADP product from choline kinase catalysis serves
  as a substrate for pyruvate kinase to generate pyruvate, which is then reduced by
  lactate dehydrogenase to lactate by transferring a hydride from NADH. The absorbance
  is monitored at 340 nm and an absorbance decrease is associated with NADH oxidation
  to NAD+. ATP is adenosine 5’-triphosphate, ADP is adenosine 5’-diphosphate, CTP
  is cytidine 5’-triphosphate, PPi is pyrophosphate, and CMP is cytidine 5’-monophosphate.
