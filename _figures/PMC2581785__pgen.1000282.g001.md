caption: We show that new information on the functional basis of the observed associations
  can be inferred from the biochemical properties of the affected metabolites. Moreover,
  both genes were previously reported to be associated with common clinical phenotypes,
  FADS1 in an extent which would not attract immediate attention for follow-up in
  a genome-wide context. Since several genes and pathways are involved in the development
  of a clinical endpoint, the IP focuses on one pathway (e.g., cholesterol or a given
  metabotype) which is already known to be involved in the clinical endpoint (e.g.
  coronary artery disease (CAD)). It is much easier to identify the genes which are
  associated with the IP since the associations of genetic variation with the IP is
  much stronger than with the clinical endpoint. Environmental factors interact at
  different levels with the IPs and thereby add to the variability in the system.
  The closer the IP is related to the genetic polymorphism, the stronger the association
  is expected to be. In our case the association reflects enzymatic activity of FADS1
  and LIPC which results in very strong effect sizes of the genetically determined
  metabotype.
