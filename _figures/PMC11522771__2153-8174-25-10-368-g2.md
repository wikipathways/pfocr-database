caption: 'Schematic diagram of signaling pathways involved in cardiac  fibrosis. It
  depicts two primary signaling cascades: the transforming growth  factor beta (TGFβ)
  pathway on the left and the bone morphogenetic protein  2 (BMP2) pathway on the
  right, both converging on SMAD proteins (refers to homologies with C. elegans SMA
  (“small” worm phenotype) and Drosophila MAD (“mothers against decapentaplegic”)
  genes), which are  critical mediators of fibrosis. In the TGFβ pathway, the  receptor
  is shown activating SMAD2/3 complexed with Smad anchor for receptor  activation
  (SARA). This complex subsequently activates Rho-associated kinase  (ROCK), a downstream
  effector known to promote fibrosis, leading to the  pathological remodeling of cardiac
  tissue, which is illustrated by a cluster of  myocardial cells interlaced with fibrotic
  tissue. The BMP2 pathway involves  SMAD6. Notably, SMAD6 forms a complex with Smurf1
  (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1), which negatively regulates the  TGFβ
  pathway, providing a potential anti-fibrotic mechanism. Secreted protein acidic
  and rich in cysteine (SPARC)-related modular calcium binding 1 (SMOC1) is depicted
  as an inhibitor, shown by a  downward red arrow, which suggests that it reduces
  the activity of SMADs or other  intermediaries in the pathway, potentially leading
  to a decrease in fibrotic  response. This figure was created with BioRender.com'
