caption: Schematic illustration of plausible pathways for protein folding and degradation
  of ABCG2 WT and Q141K variant protein. BiP(Grp78) is one of the abundant ER chaperones
  and is closely related to cytosolic Hsp70. Because of its location, BiP can immediately
  interact with the unfolded nascent peptide chain and hence contribute to the translocation
  of nascent chains into the ER (). BiP reportedly has an ATPase domain and a peptide-binding
  domain that coordinate cycles of ATP hydrolysis and ADP exchange, which stimulate
  the binding and release of the unfolded protein, respectively (). During de novo
  synthesis in the ER, cysteine disulfide bonds are formed and oligosaccharides are
  added to asparagine (N-glycosylation) or serine residues (O-glycosylation) of glycoproteins.
  The ER has a unique oxidizing potential that supports disulfide bond formation during
  protein folding (). In addition to the well-known oxidoreductases, such as PDI and
  ERp57, many novel oxidoreductases have been identified over the past few years whose
  functions and substrates are unknown (, ). Some of them are likely to be involved
  in the formation of disulfide bonds at Cys592, Cys603, and Cys608 in the ABCG2 protein.
  Furthermore, N-linked glycans are added en block to proteins as “core oligosaccharides”
  (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2). In the ABCG2 protein, Asn596 is an N-glycosylation site (, ).
  Calnexin (CNX) is located near the translocon and can interact with nascent peptide
  chains of N-glycosylated proteins. N-linked glycans are subjected to extensive modification
  as glycoproteins mature and move through the ER via the Golgi apparatus to their
  final destination, for example the plasma membrane. After remaining in the plasma
  membrane domain for a certain period, ABCG2 WT is degraded by the endosome-lysosome
  pathway. In contrast, Q141K undergoes both lysosomal proteolysis and ubiquitination-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. The proteasomal degradation is inhibited by MG132.
