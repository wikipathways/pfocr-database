caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified
  in this study. (A): Protein‐protein interaction network constructed with selected
  disease‐enriched proteins in sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) tumorous tissues
  compared with paired normal thyroid tissues using Cytoscape software. No connecting
  DEPs were excluded. The gray node, RET, represents a protein not identified in the
  present study. Blue dotted ovals represent known biomarkers of MTC. Dark green dotted
  ovals represent RET‐associated DEPs. (B–E): Visualization of Wikipathways enrichment
  analyses of DEPs. Gray nodes represent proteins not identified in the present study.
  (B): Visualization of the focal adhesion pathway. (C): Visualization of matrix metalloproteinase
  pathways. (D): Visualization of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling pathway.
  (E): Visualization of the synaptic vesicle pathway. All DEPs are represented by
  colored nodes labeled with the gene name. Upregulated and downregulated DEPs are
  shown in red and green, respectively, whereas the fold‐changes of DEPs are reflected
  by color intensity. Five shared DEPs and clinical biomarkers (CALCA and CEACAM5)
  subsequently investigated by Western blot or immunohistochemistry (see Fig. ) are
  highlighted with red circles.'
