caption: The MapMan photosynthesis pathway. The figure illustrates the differential
  expression of 82 and 20 genes in plants treated with the flash (above) and 60 s
  (below) treatments, respectively. The number of genes altered by the flash treatment
  is four times greater than that of the 60 s treatment. This indicates that the photosynthetic
  apparatus is more profoundly impacted by the flash treatment than by the 60 s treatment.
  In the case of the flash treatment, 31 and 16 DEGs are associated with PSII and
  PSI, respectively, while seven and three genes are associated with PSII and PSI,
  respectively. The genes of photorespiration comprise 12 and four in the flash and
  60 s treatments, respectively. The genes that are overexpressed are indicated in
  red, while those that are underexpressed are indicated in blue
