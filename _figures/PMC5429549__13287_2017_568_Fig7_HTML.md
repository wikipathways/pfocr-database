caption: Signaling transduction pathway of AMSC differentiation to ECs and negative
  crosstalk between ERK and JNK. ERK receives signals from VEGFR2, and induces the
  transcription of EC markers during AMSC stimulation for EC differentiation. ERK
  activation phosphorylates MKP-7 and blocks the JNK signaling pathway. ERK extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGFR2 vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor-2, JNK c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, MKP-7 MAP kinase
  phosphatase-7, EC endothelial cell
papertitle: ERK signaling is required for VEGF-A/VEGFR2-induced differentiation of
  porcine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells into endothelial cells.
