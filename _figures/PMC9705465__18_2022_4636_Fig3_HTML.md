caption: Endogenous and exogenous sources of H2S and its further fate. Endogenous
  synthesis of H2S occurs primarily through an enzymatic pathway, and the main precursor
  is l-cysteine derived from the metabolism of homocysteine and cystathionine. l-cysteine
  can be converted to H2S by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) or cystathionine γ-lyase
  (CSE). Other enzymes involved in H2S synthesis may be D-amino acid oxidase (DAO)
  and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), which convert d-cysteine and l-cysteine, respectively,
  to 3-mercaptopyruvate, for further metabolization by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
  (3-MST). Exogenously, H2S can be delivered with food and in the form of chemical
  donors, including inorganic sulfide salts or new-generation synthetic donors. Another
  approach to increase the level of gasotransmitter through external sources is gene
  therapy based on the overexpression of H2S-generating enzymes. Subsequently, H2S
  acts as a gasotransmitter, exerting numerous biological effects or is catabolized
  through several pathways. It can be scavenged by methemoglobin to form sulfhemoglobin,
  metabolized into thiosulfate and sulfate in the kidney and liver, or exhaled directly
  by the lungs. The main catabolic pathway is based on oxidation in the mitochondria.
  In subsequent reactions catalyzed by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and persulfide
  dioxygenase (ETHE1), H2S is converted to a persulfide and sulfite, respectively.
  Sulfite may be turned into sulfate or thiosulfate by sulfite oxidase (SUOX) and
  thiosulfate transferase, TST (also called rhodanese). In the cytosol, H2S is methylated
  by thiol S-methyltransferase (TMT) to methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide, which can
  be further processed by TST to thiocyanate and sulfate. GSH, glutathione; SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine
