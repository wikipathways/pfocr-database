caption: Genotoxic stress signaling pathway. Components and mechanisms ensuring signal
  transduction in the two proposed pathways are depicted, with black arrows indicating
  ubiquitination processes and grey arrows phosphorylation. M1- and K63-linked polyubiquitination
  is indicated with yellow and green hexagons, respectively. Blue squares labeled
  S indicate sumoylation whereas red hexagons indicate monoubiquitination. The participation
  of RIPK1 in the cytoplasmic events is indicated but with a question mark since how
  it relates to these two pathways, or another one, is unclear. See text for details.
