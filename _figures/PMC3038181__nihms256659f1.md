caption: Mechanisms of activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in cancer. The traditional
  mechanism for activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is illustrated for normal cells,
  where growth factors bind to their receptors (e.g. EGFR) to promote their activation
  and phosphorylation of targets, such as Gab1, creating phosphotyrosine-binding sites
  for proteins that contain SH2 domains, such as the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85.
  Subsequent activation of PI3K initiates signalling through the pathway. Termination
  of signalling is accomplished by direct dephosphorylation of Akt by PP2A and PHLPP
  and elimination of the lipid second messenger PIP3 by the lipid phosphatase PTEN.
  Other mechanisms to suppress signalling through this pathway include DEPTOR and
  PTENP1. In cancer cells mutations in these kinases or phosphatases, coupled with
  decreased expression of negative regulators (DEPTOR and PHLPP) promotes hyper-activation
  of this pathway. Filled red shapes indicate negative regulators of the pathway.
