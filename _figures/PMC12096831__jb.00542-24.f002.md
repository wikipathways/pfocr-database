caption: 'Carbon overflow pathways can modulate bacterial cell death and mediate metabolic
  adaptation during the stationary phase. S. aureus cultured in excess glucose undergoes
  CcpA-mediated catabolite repression, which inhibits the TCA cycle and increases
  activation of the transcriptional regulator CidR, which upregulates enzymes of overflow
  metabolism: acetolactate synthase/decarboxylase (AlsSD) and pyruvate oxidase (CidC).
  AlsSD and CidC convert pyruvate into the metabolites acetoin and acetate, respectively.
  While acetoin counters weak acid-mediated intracellular acidification of the cytoplasm,
  acetic acid-mediated intracellular acidification triggers cell death. The activities
  of both the AlsSD and CidC pathways modulate cell death at the population level,
  affecting the amount of cell death biomass important for achieving optimal biomass
  and structural integrity during biofilm development (38, 86). In S. enterica, peroxide
  stress induces expression of the methylglyoxal pathway—via upregulation of methylglyoxal
  synthase (mgsA)—an overflow metabolic pathway of glycolysis. This pathway enables
  increased glucose utilization necessary to satisfy the energetic, biosynthetic,
  and redox demands of oxidative stress resistance. In addition, methylglyoxal detoxification
  by its reaction with glutathione (GSH) consumes GSH, which is recycled from the
  S-lactoyl-glutathione as D-lactate is produced (71)'
