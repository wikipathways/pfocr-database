caption: A. Under normal conditions, insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) on
  endothelial cells and this initiates phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate
  1 and 2 (IRS) and downstream activation of PI3K, Akt and eNOS. Activation of eNOS
  causes increased production of NO, vasodilatation, and is believed to inhibit atherosclerosis.
  This pathway also results in suppression of VCAM-1 expression, a monocyte adhesion
  receptor known to promote atherosclerosis, and inhibition of FoxO nuclear translocation
  and activation of pro-atherogenic target genes. B. Endothelial insulin resistance
  is characterized by a reduced ability of insulin to activate the anti-atherosclerotic
  PI3K-Akt-eNOS pathway, mediated by increased expression of PKCβ2, Nox2 and perhaps
  an increased activation of insulin-IGF-1 hybrid receptors. Under these conditions,
  insulin signaling may be shifted to a more pro-atherogenic pathway mediated by ERK
  and downstream events, such as increased production of endothelin-1 (ET-1). Molecules
  framed by black are pro-atherogenic and molecules highlighted in white have been
  shown to exert anti-atherogenic effects in mouse models.
