caption: 'Experimental design. (A) Biosynthetic pathway of GPI-anchored proteins.
  GPI-anchor precursors are synthesized and attached to proteins in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The resulting GPI-anchored proteins are expressed at the cell surface.
  Out of 26 genes involved in this pathway, four (shown in red) were excluded from
  our screening (see text). Dol-P-Man, dolichol-phosphate-mannose. (B) Schematic screening
  procedure. (C) Functional complementation assay. Upper, principle of the assay.
  Lower, representative culture fields of Pigl m mutant ESCs unrestored (left) and
  restored (right) by plasmid transfection (scale bars, 50 μm). For clarity, original
  images shown in Additional file : Figure S1C were trimmed.'
