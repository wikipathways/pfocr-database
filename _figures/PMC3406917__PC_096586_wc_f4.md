caption: Proteins Acting in Peroxisomal β-Oxidation.(A) Mutants disrupting peroxisomal
  function frequently have IBA response and Suc-dependent phenotypes. Left, wild-type
  seedlings grown with applied IBA have shorter primary roots and abundant secondary
  roots, whereas peroxisome-defective mutants (e.g., pxa1 mutant shown) do not respond
  to IBA application because of their inability to β-oxidize IBA to IAA. Right, wild-type
  seedlings germinate and grow normally without an external carbon source, but peroxisome-defective
  mutants have disruptions in seedling establishment, ranging from failed to delayed
  development. Bar = 2 mm. (Images reprinted from , cover photo, and , Figure 8.)(B)
  Major metabolic pathways in peroxisomes use a core set of enzymes. Fatty acid β-oxidation
  (center) in developing seeds involves conversion of very-long-chain fatty acids
  (VLCFA) stored as TAG through long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), medium-chain fatty acid
  (MCFA), and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) intermediates. Each round of β-oxidation
  releases two carbons as acetyl-CoA. IBA (left) and OPDA (right) are metabolized
  in parallel pathways that use an overlapping but distinct set of enzymes; OPDA is
  produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in a multistep pathway in chloroplasts.
  *, CTS/PXA1/PED3 may import unmodified substrates or CoA derivatives. For all pathways,
  substrate activation by acyl-CoA synthetases is shown in purple, the initial oxidation
  enzymes are in red, the hydration/oxidation intermediate steps (frequently performed
  by a multifunctional enzyme) are shown in blue, and the thiolysis step is shown
  in green; if known, specific isozymes catalyzing the reaction are indicated. Peroxisomal
  acetyl-CoA is a central intermediate in various branches of cellular metabolism,
  including (1) the conversion to succinate via the glyoxylate cycle, which enters
  gluconeogenic pathways to produce Glc; (2) the production of malate, necessary for
  the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle to reoxidize NADH produced by MFP2/AIM1; and (3)
  the conversion to citrate, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
