caption: (a) Schematic EntAcro10 cell with pink arrows representing KEGG pathway reconstructions
  based on intact genes coding for proteins metabolizing specific compounds and pink
  rectangles crossing the plasma membrane representing predicted transporter genes
  that import metabolites from the ant gut lumen where fungal biomass and imbibed
  fluids are digested (cf symbols next to the transporter rectangles). GlcNAc is present
  in fungal tissues () or plant material that may have been decomposed by the fungal
  cultivar, citrate and glucose/fructose are present in fruit juice and possibly plant
  sap that ants drink (; ), arginine is mainly provided by the ingested fungal tissues
  or juices from leaves and fruits (; ; ; ), and glycerol is commonly available in
  the cytoplasm of eukaryote cells (; ; ; ). Dotted lines between metabolic products
  represent intermediate genes and other metabolic products not shown. Arginine metabolism
  produces NH3, which will be excreted and help the bacteria survive the acidic conditions
  () to end up in the fecal droplets used to manure the ants fungus-garden. The bacterial
  cell shape and the estimated size (scale bars) were obtained using TEM data from
  a previous study (). (b) Schematic representation of the EntAcro1 cell with the
  functional KEGG pathway reconstructions and predicted transporters inferred from
  the EntAcro1 genome that are identical to EntAcro10 in panel ‘a’ as pink arrows.
  Unique additional pathways and transporters only found in EntAcro1 are drawn in
  green, and include the anaerobic citrate fermentation pathway, which produces acetate
  that can be taken up by ant cells, and the GlcNAc pathway that results in byproducts
  that can enter glycolysis in the bacterial cells.
