caption: Targeting of Signaling Pathways by ATO in AML Cells. ATO treatment of leukemic
  cells results in inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway; and pharmacologic targeting
  of this pathway enhances the antileukemic effects of ATO. The potential involvement
  of other MAPK pathways, such as the p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK pathways, which play important
  roles in the control of growth and survival of other types of leukemic cells. ATO
  could suppress angiogenesis factor indirectly by suppress PI3K/AKT pathway.
