caption: 'Overview of the main volatile organic compounds’ biosynthetic pathways:
  terpenoids (pink), phenylpropanoids/benzenoids (blue) and fatty acid derivatives
  (yellow). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are secondary metabolites of which the
  precursors are products of primary metabolism. These are transformed into volatile
  terpenes (monoterpenes, diterpenes and sesquiterpenes) by the mevalonic acid (MVA)
  and methyleruthirol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Phenylpropanoid/benzenoid biosynthesis
  follows the shikimate and arogenate pathways. Meanwhile, fatty acid derivatives
  such as jasmonate (JA) and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) come from the lipoxygenase
  (LOX) pathway. Volatile terpenoids and phenylpropanoids are transcriptionally controlled
  by transcription factors (continuous lines) and may be epigenetically controlled
  by small and long non-conding RNA, as well as by DNA methylation and histone modification
  (dashed lines). Volatile fatty acid derivatives may be regulated by transcription
  factors (TFs) and epigenetic mechanisms.'
