caption: Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its modulation
  by vitamins A, D, E, and K. APP can be cleaved in two different processing pathways.
  In the amyloidogenic processing pathway (right) APP is first cleaved by β-secretase
  BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) generating soluble sAPPβ (soluble β-secreted
  APP) and the C-terminal anchored fragment C99/βCTF (β-cleaved C-terminal fragment),
  which is further cleaved by the γ-secretase complex to release amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides.
  Aβ peptides can be degraded by several processes or aggregate to build up neurotoxic
  amyloid plaques. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway (left) APP is first cleaved within
  the Aβ domain by α-secretases (members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)
  protein family) leading to the release of soluble sAPPα (soluble α-secreted APP)
  and the generation of the C-terminal membrane-tethered fragment C83/α-CTF (α-cleaved
  C-terminal fragment), which is also cleaved by the γ-secretase complex to release
  the non-toxic peptide p3. In both processing pathways the APP intracellular domain
  (AICD) is liberated into the cytosol. GE = gene expression; S = sorting; A = activity;
  RA = retinoic acid; Vit = vitamin; TP = tocopherol; PL = protein level; TT = tocotrienol;
  PS1 = presenilin 1; PS2 = presenilin 2; IDE = insulin degrading enzyme; NEP = neprilysin.
  The effects of vitamins on AD-relevant mechanisms are indicated by solid arrows,
  the impact of vitamins on lipid homeostasis is delineated by dashed arrows. + =
  increase; − = decrease.
