caption: 'NAD+ is produced through three independent pathways: the de novo synthesis,
  Preiss-Handler, and salvage pathways. The QPRT and CD38 enzymes are responsible
  for the decline in NAD+ levels with age. The de novo synthesis pathway from diet-derived
  tryptophan occurs through the kynurenine pathway. The first step in this pathway
  is the conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkin. After two more reaction steps, N-formylkin
  is transformed into QA, which is then converted into NAMN by the rate-limiting enzyme,
  QPRT. NAMN is a shared metabolite with the Preiss-Handler pathway, which uses NA
  from a dietary source. NAMN is then transformed into NAAD. The final step of both
  the de novo and Preiss-Handler pathways requires glutamine as a gamma-amide nitrogen
  donor to transform NAAD into NAD+ with NADS. The NAD+ salvage pathway uses NAM,
  which is either generated as a by-product of the enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming
  enzymes such as SIRTs and CD38, or derived from food. NAM is transformed into NMN
  to make NAD+. NR is also a precursor of NMN. NR and NMN are potent NAD+ boosters
  in vivo. N-formylkin N-formylkynurenine, QA quinolinic acid, QPRT Quinolinate phosphoribosyl
  transferase, NAMN nicotinic acid mononucleotide, NA nicotinic acid, NAAD nicotinic
  acid adenine dinucleotide, NAM nicotinamide, NR nicotinamide riboside, NMN nicotinamide
  mononucleotide.'
