caption: Interplay of cardiomyocyte death signalling pathways in sepsis. PAMPs and
  DAMPs activate pyroptosis via classical NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. TLR4 involves
  pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis. Decreased ATP production following mitochondrial
  damage increases TLR4-mediated atypical pyroptosis activation pathway. Activation
  of RIPK1 regulates necroptosis and induces apoptosis under oxidative stress and
  inflammatory processes. Level of intracellular calcium ions, function of MCU, and
  iron transporters are associated with occurrence of mitochondria-mediated pyroptosis
  and ferroptosis. Beclin-1 regulates autophagy and apoptosis during infection. DAPK1
  regulates necroptosis, apoptosis, autophagy and ferroptosis, inhibits necroptosis
  by activating P38 MAPK pathway and regulates mitochondrial autophagy by promoting
  expression of SIRT1. FSP1/CoQ/NADPH pathway regulates ferroptosis. PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; RIPK, receptor-interacting protein kinase; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase
