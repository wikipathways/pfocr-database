caption: Rescue of the aged fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation by amplification
  of TGF-β signaling via the Tak1/AMPK/p38MAPK pathway. Stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts
  derived from young animals (Young) with TGF-β1 resulted in phosphorylation of Smad3
  and increased expression of β-SMA(left panel). Cardiac fibroblasts derived from
  30-month-old animals (Aged) demonstrated reduced expression of both TβRI and TβRII,
  which resulted in decreased signal transduction and diminished α-SMA expression
  (middle panel). AICAR/TGF-β1 synergistically activated Tak1, AMPK, and p38MAPK,
  resulting in up-regulation of α-SMA expression (right panel). Large and small font
  sizes indicate, respectively, up-regulation or reduction of expression. (reprinted
