caption: Intersection of BC modules 143, 79 and 82. Module 143, designated by square
  nodes, shows interactions among cyclins, SKP2 and BRCA2. Module 79, designated by
  rectangular nodes shows interactions among cytokines, SOCS genes and genes in the
  JAK-STAT pathway. The JAK-STAT pathway is associated with B-cell growth and proliferation
  and a number of genes in this pathway are related to cancer. Module 82, designated
  by circular nodes, shows interactions among the MET oncogene and critical cancer-associated
  growth factors including IGF1R, PDGFRA, VEGFA, and ERBB4. Among genes in this module,
  IRS2 and FGF7 are differentially regulated and may be interesting targets for further
  research. Red nodes designate cancer-associated genes based on descriptions in OMIM.
  Node sizes correspond to the absolute values of the fold change of differentially
  regulated genes (up- or down-regulated). Blue edges are derived from HPRD, green
  from KEGG, and orange from both databases.
