caption: Drug-induced cellular stress by CYP-mediated drug combinations of ASMs, CYP
  substrate + CYP inducer co-treatment which may have contributed towards oxidative
  stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrantly expresses an imbalance
  of increased BAX (pro-apoptotic) and decreased Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic) levels, possibly
  leading to a decrease in SIRT3 activity and expression. ROS release and increased
  phospho-ERK levels influence cytotoxicity at cellular levels. However, CYP inhibition
  completely abolished the altered cascade of apoptotic signaling pathway, thereby
  restoring cell integrity and mitochondrial function.
