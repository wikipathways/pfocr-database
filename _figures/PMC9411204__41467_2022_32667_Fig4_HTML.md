caption: a The biosynthetic pathway from 5 to 2 illustrating the formation of oxygenated
  miltiradiene derived intermediates catalyzed by the action of TwCYP82’s (blue arrows)
  and TwCYP71BE’s (red arrows) on the A- and C-ring of the abietane diterpene backbone,
  respectively. Underlined compounds or diastereomers hereof have previously been
  identified in plant extracts from Tripterygium species (Supplementary Table ). b
  a hypothetical Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement reaction (W.-M.) to account for the
  methyl shift of C-18 to C-3 in the abietane carbon backbone. Cpd I and Cpd II represents
  states of the heme in the CYP catalytic cycle. Red line at heme bound hydroxyl symbolizes
  inhibition of oxygen rebound facilitating e- transfer as proposed by for CYP mediated
  carbocation formation. Compound 13 and oxygenated compounds hereof including 14,
  17, and 18, would be products caused by the failure to inhibit oxygen rebound and
  additional oxygenation likely to be catalyzed by the TwCYPs heterolgously expressed
  in S. cerevisiae. Alternatively, the C18(4→3) could be mediated via a mechanism
  relying on the radical formed by the Compound II (CpdII) state of the involved CYP
  enzyme (Supplementary Fig. ).
