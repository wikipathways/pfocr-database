caption: 'Schematic Representation of Metabolic Reprogramming During Cell Transformations:
  The nutrient, mechanical, or proliferative stress induces the EMT in cells, and
  the cells transform to the mesenchymal state. Suppression of mTORC1 arrests the
  translation of proteins, which results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins
  and enhances the ER stress and activates two parallel pathways, the general control
  nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and the AMPK. GCN2 suppresses the translation process
  and rescues cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 α). But under limited supply of amino acids
  GCN2 activates translation of the transcription factor, ATF4, which controls the
  transcription of several genes involved in cellular homeostasis. AMPK pathway activates
  the autophagy in cells, which hydrolyses several intracellular membrane proteins
  and the matrix proteins and increase the intracellular non-essential amino acids,
  induces the membrane plasticity, and activates EMT. AMPK suppresses PFK1 and activates
  the PPP, one-carbon metabolic pathways and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathways,
  which modulate temporal changes in nutrient transporters (see Fig. ). Protein degradation
  increases the availability of amino acids and the arginine -proline-glutamate cycle
  activates the NO production and the nucleotide synthesis. The GLUD1 produces ammonia
  for pyrimidine synthesis, and 2-OG activates the isocitrate synthesis, when coupled
  to the oxPPP (FIG.9). 2-OG is an epigenetic modifier and activates the demethylases
  and suppresses the HIF1 transcription factor. It has lesser effect on the HIF2 transcription
  and the glutamine and BCAA transporters. Stress induces the activation of adrenergic
  receptors, and the catecholamines activate the cAMP pathway, which activates the
  lipolysis and the anchorage independent proliferation. Fatty acids and their metabolites
  activate the GPCRs and produce the second messengers and protein kinases as well
  as the acetyl-CoA and ketoacids, which remodel the cell metabolism by epigenetic
  modulation, cholesterol synthesis. Insulin activates the Pi dependent mitochondrial
  glutamine metabolism and activates the cell cycle exit by coordinating the synthesis
  of membrane lipids and tubulins for mitotic spindle formation. Insulin resistance
  inhibits the mitotic exit, but ASNS activates the asparagine synthesis and cell
  survival. Surviving cells evade the G2 check point by mitotic slippage (See also
