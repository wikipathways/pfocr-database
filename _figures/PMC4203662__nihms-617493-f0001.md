caption: 'PI3K consists of a family of lipid kinases and class IA PI3Ks are made up
  of a catalytic p110 subunit and a regulatory p85 subunit. RTKs are the principle
  proteins upstream of PI3Ks. Following ligand binding and RTK activation, p110 subunit
  is free to catalyze the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3, which subsequently locates
  AKT to the plasma membrane. AKT is fully activated when its T308 and S473 are phosphorylated
  by PDK1 and mTORC2. Once activated, AKT separates from the plasma membrane and phosphorylates
  a wave of targets to promote cell survival, proliferation, mobility and metabolism.
  The mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase. It associates with different proteins to
  form two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The
  key components of mTORC1 include mTOR, RAPTOR, mLST8 and PRAS40. The mTORC1 signaling
  can be initiated by AKT, ERK1/2 and changes to the energy status of cells. The mTORC1
  pathway promotes protein translation and cell growth predominantly through activating
  S6K and inhibiting eIF4E. The mTORC2 complex is mainly made up of mTOR, RICTOR,
  mLST8, PROTOR1 and mSIN1. The principle downstream targets of mTORC2 include AKT,
  SGK1 and PKC. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is controlled by several negative regulators.
  For example, PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to active PIP3, whereas the tumor suppressor
  PTEN converts PIP3 to inactive PIP2 and, thereby, impairs AKT activation. As a downstream
  target of mTORC1, S6K also mediates negative feedback through degradation of IRS-1
  and IRS-2 and subsequently weakens the PI3K activation by IGF receptor signaling.
  The PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis communicates with other pathways, such as the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  cascade and PI3K can also be activated through RAS. Arrows represent activation,
  whereas bars represent inhibition.IRS: Insulin receptor substrate; mTORC2: mTOR
