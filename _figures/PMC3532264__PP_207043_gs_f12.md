caption: Model for the role of CPL1. A, Role of CPL1 in root-shoot  distribution.
  CPL1 in the stele likely promotes the root-to-shoot transport of  and attenuates
  the  deficiency signal in shoots. Communication between different cell types in
  shoot tissues is omitted in this model. B, Coregulation of a subset of osmotic stress/
  response genes by  and  deficiency signals and its attenuation by CPL1. Solid and
  broken arrows indicate pathways that operate during  deficiency and in the presence
  of , respectively. White bars indicate the repression activity of CPL1, which is
  absent in cpl1 mutants. CPL1 attenuates the  deficiency signaling pathway upstream
  of FIT and group Ib bHLH. Direct targets of CPL1 in the pathways are currently unknown.
  B3 family transcription factors up-regulate the expression of a subset of osmotic
  stress/-responsive genes through the RY motif in response to  deficiency and  signaling.  also
  promotes gene expression via the -responsive element. When  levels are elevated,
  the enhanced expression of -responsive genes causes slow growth, which inhibits
  the expression of  utilization genes.
