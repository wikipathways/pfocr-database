caption: NO produced by NOS activates sGC, resulting in the production of cGMP, and
  subsequent relaxation of VSMCs and inhibition of platelet aggregation and leukocyte
  adhesion, among others. In turn, cGMP is broken down to GMP by PDE5, which can be
  inhibited by Sildenafil. ROS can interact at various levels with this pathway, including
  facilitating the oxidation of the iron in the heme-prosthetic group of sGC. The
  resulting heme-free sGC (apoGC) is no longer functional and a target for rapid ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolytic degradation. However, BAY 58-2667 can bind heme-free sGC and reactivate
  cGMP production independent of NO. BAY 41-2272, on the other hand, can stimulate
  the activity of functional (reduced-heme) sGC synergistically with NO. Nitrite,
  a hypoxia selective NO donor, can also be used to stimulate this pathway selectively.
  No cell specific effects for the compounds or enzymes are assumed, they are shown
  as such for simplicity only. Arrows indicate binding, interaction or induction;
  bold arrows indicates increased production; dashed lines indicate an inhibitory
  effect; bold/underlined text indicates NO/cGMP-mediated effects; ‘apoGC’ = heme-free
  sGC. Figure was produced using Servier Medical Art.
