caption: Schematic representation of metabolic pathway readjustment in strain SCD00
  and SCD78. The pathway map represents the metabolic reactions which are differentially
  regulated at enzymatic level. There are two comparison groups depicted on the pathway
  map—SCD00 vs. SSK42 and SCD78 vs. SCD00
