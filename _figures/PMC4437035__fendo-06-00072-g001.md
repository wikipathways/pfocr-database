caption: 'Diagram illustrating the influence of intracellular renin due to internalization
  or to expression of renin transcript on chemical communication between heart cells.
  The interaction between renin and pro (renin) receptor occurring inside a cytoplasmic
  vesicle can induce: the formation of Ang II, and the translocation of PLZF to the
  nucleus [see Ref. ()], and consequent generation of oxidative stress through PI3K-Akt
  pathway with consequent decline of gap junction communication.'
