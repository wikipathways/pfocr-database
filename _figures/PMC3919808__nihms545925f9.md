caption: 'The death receptor pathway (left) is initiated by the binding of a ligand
  (Eg: FasL) to its receptor Fas, which results in the sequential recruitment of FADD
  and pro-caspase-8. c-FLIP can block the recruitment of pro-caspase-8 to the complex.
  The proximity of several pro-caspase-8 molecules results in its activation. Caspase-8
  can proteolytically activate caspase-3, or it can cleave Bid to its truncated form
  t-Bid, which binds to Bax and gets integrated into the mitochondrial membrane to
  release cytochrome c. In response to various cellular stress-induced apoptotic stimuli,
  the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is activated. This pathway involves the translocation
  of proapoptotic molecules such as Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane.
  Bax can release cytochromec from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochromec
  associates with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome and subsequent activation
  of caspase-3. Mitochondria also release AIF and Endo G, which may exert their effects
  on the nuclei. Mitochondria released Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 sequesters inhibitors
  of apoptosis (IAPs) to prevent them from inhibiting caspase-3. BNIP3 is a Bcl2 family
  member that is translocated and integrated into the mitochondria. Unlike other Bcl2
  family members, BNIP3 can induce necrotic cell death in response to death stimuli.
  Activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) leads to NAD+ depletion and may
  induce mitochondrial depolarization to release AIF. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
