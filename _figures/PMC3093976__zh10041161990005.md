caption: Working model to explain the antidiabetic effect of Ad36. Overall, data from
  – suggest that, in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver of mice, Ad36 downregulates
  insulin signaling yet upregulates the Ras-PI3K pathway, which upregulates Glut1
  and Glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and downregulates Glut2 in liver.
  Furthermore, Ad36 increases adiponectin, which may activate AMPK. Collectively,
  this leads to greater glucose uptake by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and reduces
  hepatic glucose release, which may contribute to Ad36-induced improvement in systemic
  glycemic control.
