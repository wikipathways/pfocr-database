caption: 'Two signalling pathways downstream of mGluR5 affect translation the MEK-ERK-Mnk1
  and the PI3K-mTOR pathway . Several FMRP target mRNAs (PP2A and PI3K) are members
  of second messenger cascades converging on ERK. ERK is a point of convergence of
  several signalling cascades. Phospho-ERK can trigger translational activities via
  Mnk1 and S6K. ERK phosphorylation is regulated by phosphatases such as PP2A. In
  Fmr1 KO mice, PP2A is overactivated after mGluR5 stimulation, causing the rapid
  deactivation of ERK. Thus, misregulated ERK activation can be a first indicator
  for deficient translational regulation at the synapse. Activation of mTOR is one
  of the primary triggers for the initiation of cap-dependent translation via phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP and S6K. After stimulation of mGluR5, PI3K phosphorylates the membrane
  phospholipid PIP2, converting it to PIP3. PIP3 recruits Akt to the membrane where
  it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1. Akt activates mTOR by inhibiting TSC,
  a heterodimer of TSC1 and TSC2. TSC2 contains a GAP domain for the small G-protein
  Rheb. When TSC2 is phosphorylated, its GAP activity decreases, activating Rheb and
  mTOR. Subsequently, mTOR interacts with Raptor, which binds both 4E-BP and S6K.
  Active mTOR can phosphorylate S6K resulting in the phosphorylation of S6. In addition,
  active mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP. Unphosphorylated 4E-BP binds tightly to eIF4e,
  whereas phosphorylated 4E-BP does not, thereby permitting eIF4F to form a translational
  initiation complex. Phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP finally results in mRNA translation.
  The role of FMRP in the mTOR pathway is indicated. Upon mGluR5 stimulation, PP2a
  activity is enhanced (<1 minute), which rapidly dephosphorylates FMRP so mRNAs are
  translated . Extended mGluR5 activation (>5 minutes) suppresses PP2a activity and
  FMRP is phosphorylated by S6K. Phosphorylated FMRP represses the translation of
  target mRNAs . Abbreviations: MEK, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ERK,
