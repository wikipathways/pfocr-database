caption: Scheme of the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR has three response branches
  controlled by stress sensor proteins in the ER membrane, the ATF6, the inositol-requiring
  enzyme-1 (IRE1), and the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). Activated ATF6
  translocates to the Golgi where it is cleaved by proteases to the short form (sATF6)
  that translocates to the nucleus and activates expression of sATF6 target genes
  coding for ER chaperons, and proteins involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
  and autophagy. ER stress turns IRE1 into an endonuclease that cleaves X-box binding
  protein-1 (Xbp1) mRNA. IRE1-induced splicing of Xbp1 mRNA triggers a frame-shift
  of the coding region, and formation of a new 54-kDa protein, XBP1s. XBP1s is a transcription
  factor that regulates expression of genes coding for ER chaperones, proteins involved
  in ERAD and in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that activates O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine
  modification of proteins (O-GlcNAcylation). Activated PERK is turned into a kinase
  that phosphorylates eIF2α and thereby blocks the initiation process of translation.
  This promotes translation of Atf4 mRNA into the ATF4 protein, a transcription factor
  that activates expression of genes coding for pro-apoptosis protein including CHOP.
