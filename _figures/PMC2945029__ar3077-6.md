caption: Pathways and networks related to chondrocyte proteins identified by proteomics
  as altered by GS and/or CS. Pathway Studio software was used to map the identified
  proteins into characterized human pathways and networks that associate proteins
  based on known protein-protein interactions, mRNA expression studies and other previously
  described biochemical interactions. Abbreviations are shown as in Table . Most of
  the proteins modulated by GS belong to the unfolded protein response (UPR) system,
  while CS seems to affect mainly energy production (glycolysis) and metabolic pathways.
