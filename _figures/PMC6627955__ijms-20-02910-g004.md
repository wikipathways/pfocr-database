caption: (A) Demonstrates a simplified pathway of sphingolipids (SLs) together with
  the responsible key genes involved in regulating the pathway. (B) Demonstrates a
  simplified pathways of de-novo synthesis of fatty acids (FAs) as well as imported
  essential polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) together with responsible genes involved in
  regulating the pathway (the figure was adapted from Kiamehr et al. []).
