caption: The Roles of Platelets and the Signal Transductions Identified as the Major
  Cascades in Hepatocyte Proliferation. After liver injury, Kupffer cells can play
  a crucial role in the accumulation of platelets in the liver sinusoids and the production
  of cytokines, such as, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα).
  Moreover, Kupffer cells induce the translocation of platelets into the space of
  Disse and the direct contact between platelets and hepatocytes, which trigger the
  release of growth factors, such as, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-1, which are necessary for hepatocyte proliferation. Platelets
  also have direct contact with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which
  trigger the release of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P induces the secretion
  of IL-6 from LSECs, which promotes hepatocyte proliferation. During hepatocyte proliferation,
  IL-6 binding induces both the dimerization and the phosphorylation of gp130 and
  promotes the docking site of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
  (STAT3). STAT3 is then phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus. Phosphatidyl
  inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is essential for the platelet-induced
  hepatocyte proliferation and is activated via the receptor tyrosine kinases through
  the stimulation of HGF, IGF, IL-6, and many other signaling molecules. Phosphorylated
  Akt activates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which induces DNA synthesis and
  cellular mitosis in hepatocytes. Other downstream Akt factors including mTOR and
  p70S6K also play critical roles in regulating the growth of hepatocytes. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling
  pathway is also immediately activated after hepatectomy and thereafter phosphorylated
  ERK translocates to the nucleus. TNFα/nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway
  is activated via the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). NFκB is a heterodimer composed of two
  subunits, p65 and p50, with inactivated by inhibitor of NFκB (IκB). After stimulation
  with TNFα, NFκB is activated by the removal of IκB from its p65 subunit, followed
  by the migration to the cell nucleus.
