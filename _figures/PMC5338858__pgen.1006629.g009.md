caption: A) Carbon flux into the energy production is favored by CsrA, whereas production
  of the storage molecule PHB is repressed. Additionally, amino acids and glucose,
  but not glycerol are the preferred carbon source in presence of CsrA. Proteins in
  red represent a negative effect of CsrA on the pathway, whereas in green, proteins
  are shown to be under positive control of CsrA. In black, CsrA interacts with the
  RNA, but no quantitive difference was observed under our condition. PrsA (Lpp0607),

  of the translation initiation process by blocking the ribosome binding site of the
  RNA and hence, interfering with its ribosome interaction. Examples in L. pneumophila
  are the transcriptional regulator FleQ and the quorum sensing response regulator
  LqsR. Binding of CsrA leads to a conformational re-organization of the target-RNA.
  As a consequence, the RBS is better accessible for the ribosome yielding in a translational
  activation due to CsrA interaction. This mode of action might be relevant for the
  relA mRNA in L. pneumophila. CsrA interaction with the RNA can stabilize the target-RNA
  by blocking RNase-specific binding sites. Contrary, also a destabilization can be
  triggered by CsrA when its binding leads to conformational changes of the RNA that
  facilitate the attack of an RNase. In Legionella, we suggest that the fur mRNA is
  protected by CsrA against degradation by binding to an A(N)GGA motif overlapping
  a putative RNase E recognition site. Finally, CsrA can affect transcriptional elongation
  in a negative (promoting termination) or in a positive way (stabilizing an anti-terminator
  structure). The transcription of the gap gene in L. pneumophila is only guaranteed
  in presence of CsrA as binding of the protein prevents the Rho-dependent termination
  downstream of the tkt gene part of the PPP/Glycolysis operon.
