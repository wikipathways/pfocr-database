caption: Mechanisms involved in hypofibrinolysis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
  patients. The main contributors to hypofibrinolysis in T2DM are platelet activation,
  endothelial cells (ECs) dysfunction, enhanced thrombin generation, proinflammatory
  state, increased fibrinogen level along with its modifications, and altered fibrin
  structure. Obesity represented by high body mass index (BMI), hyperinsulinemia,
  and hyperglycemia (high glucose, Glc) all lead to platelet activation reflected
  by increased release of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), P-selectin, plasminogen activator
  inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and platelet microparticles (PMPs). Another contributor to
  platelet activation is oxidative stress, which is reflected by increased synthesis
  of F2-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), a product of low-density-lipoprotein
  (LDL) cholesterol peroxidation, represented by oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Down-regulation
  of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  pathways with enhancement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) result in decreased
  nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and increased PAI-1 release, leading to endothelial
  dysfunction. Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) stimulate overactive NADPH oxidases
  (NOX), reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme complexes, which in turn generates
  tissue factor (TF) in ECs. AGE stimulate monocytes (Mo)/macrophages (Ma) to produce
  increased amounts of TF. Another source of TF are the vascular smooth muscle cells
  (VSMCs). Increased TF initiates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and together
  with factor VII (VIIa, activated factor VII) lead to enhanced thrombin generation.
  Weibel-Palade bodies release increased amounts of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which
  along with increased factor VIII (VIIIa, activated factor VIII) and factor IX (IXa,
  activated factor IX), form the intrinsic pathway of thrombin generation. Increase
  in both components of the prothrombinase complex, activated factor X (Xa) and V
  (Va). Other factors underlying enhanced thrombin generation are central obesity
  represented by increased waist-hip circumference (WHC) ratio, elevated C-reactive
  protein (CRP), low glycemia, and time since T2DM diagnosis exceeding 5 years. Hyperglycemia,
  increased interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), along with ROS stimulate neutrophils
  to form the neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), with an important stage of chromatin
  decondensation mediated by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), followed by a release
  of nuclear components depicted in light blue, i.e., cell-free DNA (cfDNA), citrullinated
  histone H3 (H3Cit), and granular components depicted in dark blue, i.e., myeloperoxidase
  (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE). Obesity represented by increased BMI elevates
  both CRP and complement C3 (C3) levels. IL-6 and insulin resistance contribute to
  elevated fibrinogen concentration, while hyperglycemia and ROS result in posttranslational
  modifications, such as fibrinogen glycation (–Glc) and oxidation (–ROS). The fibrin
  network formed from modified fibrinogen, with increased amounts of incorporated
  α2-antiplasmin (a2AP), NETs, and complement C3, characterized by enhanced crosslinking
  by factor XIII (FXIII), dense and less permeable, being composed of thinner and
  highly branched fibrin fibers. Additionally, increased amount of polyhedrocytes
  are found in the contracted thrombi of diabetic patients. Decreased plasmin generation,
  diminished binding of plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to fibrin,
  along with increased PAI-1, originating from adipocytes and hepatocytes, are also
  involved in hypofibrinolysis observed in T2DM. Glycation of plasminogen was reported
  in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients and therefore is marked with asterisks. α2-antiplasmin
  is another protein implicated in fibrinolysis and found to be glycated in T2DM.
