caption: 'Activation of myeloid cells through metabolic modifications. In polarized
  M1 macrophages, the PI3K pathway and overexpression of HIF-1α promote glycolysis
  via an increase in glycolytic enzymes GLUT1, HK2, PKM2 and LDHA. Glutamine is metabolized
  in the TCA cycle to support the synthesis of FAs and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is then converted by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  into L-arginine and nitric oxide (NO) which play a major role as cytotoxic effector
  molecules against tumor cells (left). Like Tregs, the proliferation of polarized
  M2 macrophages is supported by FA oxidation. Lipids carried by the CD36 transporter
  are oxidized through the TCA cycle to produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS). In M2, the enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1) converts L-arginine to polyamine to
  support tumor growth (right). ATP: adenosine triphosphate; APC: antigen-presenting
  cell; Arg1: arginase 1; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; FAS: fatty acid synthase; GLUT1:
