caption: The de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis pathway
  (also known as the kynurenine pathway or tryptophan–kynurenine pathway) consists
  of eight steps that convert dietary tryptophan to NAD+. Tryptophan has multiple
  metabolic fates that compete with its conversion to N-formylkynurenine, which is
  catalysed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). N-formylkynurenine
  is hydrolysed to kynurenine by arylformamidase (AFMID). Kynurenine is hydroxylated
  to 3-hydroxy-kynurenine by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). 3-Hydroxy-kynurenine
  is a major branch point in the pathway as this metabolite can be converted to xanthurenate
  or other molecules. Kynureninase (KYNU) catalyses the formation of 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid, which is converted to α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde (ACMS) by 3-hydroxyanthranilate
  3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO). ACMS can either spontaneously cyclize to form quinolinic
  acid or can be decarboxylated by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD) to form picolinic acid.
  The only known fate of quinolinic acid is conversion to nicotinate mononucleotide
  (NAMN) by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Quinolinic acid is therefore
  the first metabolite in the pathway that is committed to NAD+ biosynthesis. Nicotinamide
  mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) catalyses the final step to create NAD+.
