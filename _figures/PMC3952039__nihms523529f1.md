caption: '(A) Illustration shows RET gene structure with 20 exons (solid boxes) and
  the putative two major RET isoforms: short RET 9 (1072 aa) or long RET 51 (1114
  aa). The different isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and differ only
  in the number of aa residues in the cytosolic tail. RET 9 has nine amino acids at
  the carboxyl terminus that are different than the 51 terminal residues in RET 51.
  The extracellular domain consists of 4 cadherin motifs. The key tyrosine (Y) residues
  in the cytoplasmic domain are labeled. Note that the RET 51 isoform has an additional
  tyrosine residue Y1096. (B) Schematic shows RET signaling components using RET 51
  as an example. GFRα1, the essential co-receptor of RET, is a glycophosphatidylinositol
  linked protein present on cell surface in the epithelia or in the mesenchyme. Two
  molecules of GDNF, ligand for RET signaling, bind to homodimers of Gfrα1 which then
  recruit two RET molecules in the cell membrane. Formation of this hexameric complex
  induces autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular kinase
  domain that serve as docking sites for the intracellular adaptors and activates
  the indicated downstream signaling cascades. Asterisks on SHC denote that other
  adaptors including SHC, IRS1–2, FRS2, DOK 1–6, and ENIGMA can also bind to the multi-docking
  Y1062 site. Activated SHC can either trigger the PI3K-AKT pathway or the ERK-MAPK
  pathway depending on the adaptor complex recruited. RET 51 has the additional residue
  Y1096 which can also activate the PI3K-AKT pathway. (aa = amino acids; UB = ureteric
  bud; PLCγ = phospholipase Cγ; PKC = protein kinase C)'
