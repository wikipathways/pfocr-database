caption: Mechanisms by which HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs) enhance radiosensitivity.
  Nelfinavir and other HPIs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulting in
  unfolded protein response (UPR) which leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2 α (eIf2α) leading to global inhibition of protein synthesis and reduced
  tumour cell survival. A second mechanism is by activation of growth arrest and DNA
  damage-inducible protein (GADD 34) and protein phosphatase1 (PP1) complex that dephosphorylates
  phospho-AKT to AKT resulting in decreased DNA replication and increased radiosensitivity.
  Dephosphorylation of AKT also reduces expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1α)
  and vascular endothelial growth factor f (VEGF) leading to increased tumour cell
  oxygenation and decreased angiogenesis which indirectly contributes to enhanced
  radiosensitivity of the tumour. The third mechanism is by inactivation of nuclear
  factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) which leads to apoptosis
  and reduced tumour cell survival and thereby indirectly enhancing radiosensitivity.
  Dephosphorylation of pAKT also activates proapoptotic proteins and inactivates antiapoptotic
  proteins resulting in activation of apoptotic pathway. Adapted and reproduced from  of
