caption: Central regulation of leptin signaling, autonomic innervation of the adipocyte
  and β-cell, and the starvation response. (A) The arcuate nucleus transduces the
  peripheral leptin signal as one of sufficiency or deficiency. In leptin sufficiency,
  efferents from the hypothalamus synapse in the locus coeruleus, which stimulates
  the sympathetic nervous system. In leptin deficiency, efferents from the hypothalamus
  stimulate the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. (B) Autonomic innervation and hormonal
  stimulation of white adipose tissue. In leptin sufficiency, norepinephrine binds
  to the β3-adrenergic receptor, which stimulates hormone-sensitive lipase, promoting
  lipolysis of stored triglyceride into free fatty acids. In leptin deficiency, vagal
  acetylcholine increases adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (documented only in rats
  to date), promotes uptake of glucose and free fatty acids for lipogenesis, and promotes
  triglyceride uptake through activation of lipoprotein lipase. (C) Autonomic innervation
  and hormonal stimulation of the β-cell. Glucose entering the cell is converted to
  glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme glucokinase, generating ATP, which closes an ATP-dependent
  potassium channel, resulting in cell depolarization. A voltage-gated calcium channel
  opens, allowing for intracellular calcium influx, which activates neurosecretory
  mechanisms leading to insulin vesicular exocytosis. In leptin sufficiency, norepinephrine
  binds to α2-adrenoceptors on the β-cell membrane to stimulate inhibitory G proteins,
  decrease adenyl cyclase and its product cAMP, and thereby reduce protein kinase
  A levels and insulin release. In leptin deficiency, the vagus stimulates insulin
  secretion through three mechanisms. First, acetylcholine binds to a M3 muscarinic
  receptor, opening a sodium channel, which augments the ATP-dependent cell depolarization,
  increasing the calcium influx, and insulin exocytosis. Secondly, acetylcholine activates
  a pathway that increases protein kinase C, which also promotes insulin secretion.
  Thirdly, the vagus innervates L-cells of the small intestine, which secrete glucagon-like
  peptide-1, which activates protein kinase A, contributing to insulin exocytosis.
  Octreotide binds to a somatostatin receptor on the β-cell, which is coupled to the
  voltage-gated calcium channel, limiting calcium influx and the amount of insulin
  released in response to glucose. (Lustig, ; reprinted with kind permission of Humana,
