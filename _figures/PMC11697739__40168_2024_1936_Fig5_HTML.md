caption: A multi-omics analysis was performed to understand microbiota and metabolite
  community changes in the athletes. Metabolites that changed with probiotic use but
  not placebo were identified. a The SparCC algorithm was used in a correlational
  analysis of taxa, pathways, and metabolites that changed over time. In this way,
  we identified a list of taxa, pathways, and metabolites that correlate with each
  other. b) A biosynthetic pathway approach was used to understand how the different
  correlating taxa, pathways, and metabolites were related, and a cluster was identified
  that was associated with menaquinone production and reduced oxidative stress. Nicotinic
  / picolinic acid is a biosynthetic product of tryptophan. In our data, we found
  significant correlations between nicotinic / picolinic acid and menaquinol biosynthesis
  and arginine / ornithine degradation. Arginine / ornithine is metabolized into menaquinol
  and nitric oxide with citrulline as a byproduct. Menaquinol is converted into menaquinone
  (vitamin K) and nitrous oxide (N2O) Citrulline can be converted back to ornithine
  to continue this process. The Bacteroides genus and some Eubacterium species are
  known producers of menaquinones
