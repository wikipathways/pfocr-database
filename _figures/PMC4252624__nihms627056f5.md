caption: Glutathione peroxidase activity pathway which was significantly altered in
  the liver of female LMB, obtained from GSEA, featuring GO terms. Blue color indicates
  down-regulation, and red indicates up regulation of gene expression; color intensity
  indicates the degree of response, grey indicates the potential processes likely
  affected, and purple represents potential diseases associated with gene changes.
  The abbreviations of the genes are listed in the abbreviations list.
