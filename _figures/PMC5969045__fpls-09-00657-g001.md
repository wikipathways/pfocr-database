caption: Metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation from endodormancy
  until ecodormancy. From endodormancy to ecodormancy, metabolism is of primary importance.
  Storage lipids and amino acids are degraded through the gluconeogenesis pathway
  to yield glucose. Glucose car be interverted to starch and/or sucrose. It can also
  be degraded through the glycolysis pathway to yield pyruvate that will migrate to
  the mitochondria and will be metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  to enable oxidative phosphorylation to occur with reducing power in the form of
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavine adenine dinucleotide (FADH2).
  This progressive reactivation of oxidative phosphorylation during endodormancy release
  is partly responsible for ROS formation with gluconeogenesis. Glucose may also be
  oxidized via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to yield reducing power in the
  form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), enabling the detoxification
  system to operate. During endodormancy release period, there is a net positive accumulation
  of ROS that trigger mechanisms of endodormancy release. During ecodormancy, oxidative
  phosphorylation is more efficient and enable energy production and mechanisms of
  growth that are necessary for bud bursting and flowering.
