caption: Signaling pathways in the TME. PD-1 is an important receptor expressed on
  the surface of T cells and exerts immunosuppressive effects by prohibiting T cells
  from reacting excessively. Accordingly, tumor cells produce the corresponding ligand
  (PD-L1) on their surfaces to prevent T cells from attacking them. In this process,
  the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 leads to immunosuppression in the TME. The
  Notch signaling pathway mainly affects the integrity of vascular endothelial cells,
  therefore promoting metastasis. The (CXCL)3-CXCR2 axis promotes hepatic metastasis
  by attracting immunosuppressive neutrophils to the TME, while the Wnt signaling
  pathway mainly infiltrates granulocytes. The MondoA-TXNIP axis affects the identity
  of Treg cells. In addition, HH and the Gas6/Axl pathway participate in the formation
  of an immunosuppressive TME
