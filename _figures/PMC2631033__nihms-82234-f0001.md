caption: The binding of the TNF trimer to TNFR1 causes trimerization of TNFR1, resulting
  in formation of the Complex I consisting of TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2 and RIP. Complex
  I mediates the NF-κB activation pathway through the MEKK3-IKK-IκB- NF-κB cascade,
  leading to expression of a battery of genes including those encoding antiapoptotic
  facvtors such as IAPs and c-FLIP. The JNK activation pathway is also mediated by
  Complex I. Sustained JNK activation is apoptotic. The internalization of the TNFR1
  complex ensues formation of Complex II that contains RIP, TRADD, FADD and Caspase
  8. Caspase 8 is autoactivated to trigger activation of the executor caspases −3,
  and −7, resulting in apoptosis. Cleavage of Bid by caspase 8 activates the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway that involves release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria.
  Cytochrome c binds Apaf1 to activate caspase 9-mediated activation of executor caspases.
  The NF-κB activated factor c-FLIP suppresses caspase 8 activation while IAPs inhibit
  executor caspases. Smac released from the mitochndria suppresses IAPs to release
  the apoptosis brake. Complex II also mediates a necrotic cell death through ROS.
  See text for details.
