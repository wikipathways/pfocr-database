caption: 'Homocysteine metabolic pathway. Homocysteine sits at the intersection of
  the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways. In the remethylation pathway, THF
  is converted to N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and then to MTHF by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (encoded by the gene Mthfr). The methyl group is donated to Hcy and in
  the presence of methionine synthase (encoded by Mtr), and B12 is converted to methionine.
  Methionine is used in many methyl transfer reactions. When the diet is replete with
  methionine, Hcy is converted, via the transsulfuration pathway, to cystathionine
  by cystathionine-β-synthase (encoded by Cbs) and then converted to cysteine via
  the action of cystathionase (encoded by Cth, also abbreviated Cse) in the presence
  of B6. Cysteine is converted to several beneficial downstream products, some of
  which are essential for retinal function (glutathione and taurine). This current
  work investigated at the RNA and protein levels various aspects of this pathway
  in mice heterozygous for Mthfr and Cbs, which have mild Hhcy. Figure adapted with
