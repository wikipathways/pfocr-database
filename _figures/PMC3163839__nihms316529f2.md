caption: Sirt1 activity as it relates to AD etiology. Activation of Sirt1 enables
  the deacetylation of a variety of proteins, resulting in a robust, protective cellular
  response. Of particular note is the activation of RARβ by Sirt1 that confers the
  non-amyloidogenic processing of AβPP as well as the instigation of notch signaling
  (both through ADAM10 promotion). Sirt1 is also a regulator of proteins and genes
  involved in antioxidant response (FOXO3),,  anti-inflammatory response (NFκB), anti-apoptotic
  response (p53), and mitochondrial biogenesis/ROS sequestration (PGC1-α). As noted
  in the figure, Sirt1 inhibits p53 and NFκB, and activates FOXO3, RARβ, and PGC1-
  α. The net phenotype of a Sirt1-activated cell displays reduced amyloid oligomerization,
  reduced oxidative stress, and increased resistance to apoptosis/inflammation-induced
  toxicity.
