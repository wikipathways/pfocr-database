caption: Amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway in U. esculenta. Based on
  the amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway in plants and fungi, the putative
  amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathway map of U. esculenta was drawn. Sets
  of genes encoding biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, which showed differences
  in the genome of U. maydis, U. esculenta and Z. latifolia, were marked in blue box.
  Therein, the red genes ID in the box filled with yellow indicated the genes cannot
  find in U. esculenta, the red genes ID in the box with white bottom colour showed
  the genes only can find in Z. latifolia, while the green genes ID indicated the
  genes cannot find in U. maydis. All the genes marked with * means the up-regulated
  expression during stem swollen progress based on transcriptome sequencing data basic
  analysis.
