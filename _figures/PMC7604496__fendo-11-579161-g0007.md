caption: Scheme depicting the mechanism underlying chronic G1-induced cytoprotective
  effects against H2O2-induced cell death. In cultured H9c2 myoblasts, treatment with
  the cytotoxic agent, H2O2 increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS, ) production,
  which promotes the phosphorylation of MST1 (p-MST1). p-MST1 initiates activation
  of cascades that lead to phosphorylation of YAP (p-YAP). p-YAP is sequestered in
  the cytosol and subsequently degraded. In addition, increase in p-MST1 promotes
  the phosphorylation of JNK that upregulates proapoptotic genes. On the other hand,
  chronic GPER1 activation with its agonists E2 or G1 stimulates subcellular signaling
  that preserves mitochondrial structure and polarization leading to reduced ROS production
  and delayed mPTP opening. Reduction in ROS production is postulated to mitigate
  the phosphorylation of MST1, which increases the non-phosphorylated YAP. Thereafter,
  YAP translocates into the nucleus to upregulate prosurvival genes that, therefore,
  promote cell survival.
