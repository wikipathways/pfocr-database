caption: Mechanisms of the growth inhibitory (upper panel) and proapoptotic (lower
  panel) effects of cannabinoids on melanoma cells demonstrated so far. Where a mouse
  is shown, the data were confirmed by in vivo experiments. The figure does not include
  experimental data from publications in which no experiments on the intracellular
  mechanism of action of cannabinoids on melanoma cells were performed. The arrows
  indicate the sequential causal relationships of activations, inductions, downregulation
  and inhibitions triggered by the indicated substances. In the cases where URB597
  is listed with an inhibitory arrow directed at FAAH, URB597 resulted in an enhancement
  of the endocannabinoid effect shown. The dashed arrow indicates that a causal relationship
  between CB1 receptor inactivation and the subsequent signalling pathway has not
  been shown. All abbreviations are given in the text.
