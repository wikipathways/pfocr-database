caption: Schematic diagram of TRPM7 structure and cardiac fibroblast signalling. (A)
  Basic structure of alpha subunit of TRPM7. Each TRPM7 alpha subunit is comprised
  of six transmembrane-spanning domains (S1–S6), with a pore loop between S5 and S6,
  melastatin homology domains (MHD) at the amino termini, and a TRP-box (TRP), a coiled-coil
  domain (CCD), and an atypical α-type serine/threonine protein kinase domain (α-kinase)
  at the carboxyl termini. (B) Known TRPM7 homotetrameric ion channel signalling in
  cardiac fibroblasts. Ang II drives activation of TRPM7 and is coupled to increased
  nuclear activity of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as well
  as upregulation of markers of fibrosis including connective tissue growth factor
  (CTGF). H2O2 activates TRPM7 and promotes MF differentiation and ECM remodelling
  via the ERK-1/2 MAP kinase pathway. TGF-β1 and isoproterenol treatment both induce
  upregulation of TRPM7 expression and Ca2+ influx leading to myofibroblast differentiation.
  TRPM7 expression can be inhibited by miR-135a expression. See main text for details.
