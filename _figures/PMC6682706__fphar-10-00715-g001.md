caption: 'Key events during the development of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and target pathways for therapeutic use of natural plant compounds (NPCs).
  The diagram shows key essential steps for the EMT course. Briefly, BMP7 and hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) are responsible for maintaining the cellular epithelial phenotype.
  Both molecules maintain E-cadherin and Smads1, 5, 7 and 8 expressions, and block
  Smads 2 and 3. On the other hand, inflammatory conditions triggered by exogenous
  or endogenous factors lead to a dysregulation of Th17/Treg equilibrium with IL6
  synthesis that stimulates NFκB and induces EMT. Advanced glycation end products
  (AGEs) induce proteins structural crosslink, stimulate inflammatory response (monocytes),
  oxidative stress and finally uprregulation of Snail, leading to EMT. These effects
  are mediated through specific receivers called RAGES. Reactive oxigen species (ROS)
  generate oxidation and stimulate TGF-β, αSMA, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade and matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs) upregulation initiating cell migration. TGF-β initiates
  the classic route of EMT induction overexpressing Snail, Slug, N-Cadherin, Smads
  2 and 3 and downregulating E-Cadherin and Smads 1, 5, 7 and 8. TGF-β also stimulates
  RhoA/ROCK and finally NFκB. Growth factors also stimulate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade
  and MMPs upregulation, again inducing cell migration and invasion. Likewise they
  stimulate the P13k/ integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/ protein kinase B (Akt) cascade
  and GSK3β is blocked. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 also stimulates signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) and MMPs inducing migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Finally Notch-1C
  directly induces mesenchymal genes such as N-Cadherin. The numbers in green indicate
  where each NPC acts. Many of them have an effect on several molecules or pathways.
  Depending on the target route over which the corresponding NPC acts, we have defined
  the following groups (green numbers). Group 1 acts by increasing ZO-1 expression:
  (Plumbagin), Group 2 acts by decreasing IL-1β action: (Baicalin), Group 3 acts by
  blocking Smad 2/3 phosphorilation; Paeoniflorin, Eupatolide, Gallic acid, Cairicoside
  E. Group 4 acts by up-regulating E-cadherin expression: α-solanine, Osthole, coumarin,
  Betanin, Cinnamomum cassia extracts, Genisteín, Withaferin A, Gedunin, Celastrus
  orbiculatus extract, Celastrol, Black rice anthocyanins, Duchesnea extracts, Cordycepin,
  Nitidine chloride, Phoyunnanin E, Epicatechin-3-gallate, Honokiol, Gallic acid,
  Piperlongumine, Brusatol, Berberine. Group 5 acts by inhibiting NFk-β signaling:
  Honokiol, Parthenolide, Baicalin and baicalein Group 6 acts by inhibiting NEDD9/Rac1
  signaling: Acid plectranthoic. Group 7 acts by blocking TGF-β-1 signaling: Cryptotanshinone,
  Resveratrol, Oximatrina, Ligustrazina, Osthole, coumarin, Codonolactone, Betanin,

  Paeoniflorin, Gambogic acid, Arctigenin, Curcumin, Baicalin and baicalein, Baicalin
  and Cairicoside-E. Group 8 acts by downregulating hedgehog (Hn) signaling: Resveratrol,
  Sedum sarmentosum Bunge and extract Nitidine chloride Group 9 acts by decreasing
  Twist and ZEB expression: Resveratrol, Paeoniflorin, Jatrophone, Gedunin, Nitidine
  chloride, Plumbagin, Honokiol, Phoyunnanin E, Gallic acid, Piperlongumine, Brusatol,
  Nimbolide, Baicalin and baicalein. Group 10 acts by downregulation Snail expression:
  Resveratrol, Osthole, coumarin, Paeoniflorin, Gedunin, Celastrol, Nitidine chloride,
  Plumbagin, Phoyunnanin E, Piperlongumine, Berberine and Nimbolide. Group 11 acts
  by Inhibit Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress signaling pathway: Betanin, Salvianolic-acid-A
  and Plumbagin. Group 12 acts by Suppressing focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/AKT signaling:
  Phoyunnanin, Epicatechin-3-gallate, Gigantol and Eupatolide. Group 13 acts by blocking
  P13K/Akt cascade: Berberine, Nimbolide, and Curcumin. Group 14 acts by blocking
  Wnt/β-catenin Wnt signaling: Withaferin A, Jatrophone, Ginsenoside-Rb1 and Withaferin-A.
  Group 15 acts by down-regulated β-Catenin expression: Celastrol, Sulforaphane, Arctigenin,
  Plumbagin, Curcumin and Luteolin. Group 16 acts by down-regulating MMPs expression:
  α-solanine, Resveratrol, Cinnamomum cassia extracts, Paeoniflorin and Celastrus
