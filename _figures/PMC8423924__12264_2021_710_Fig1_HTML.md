caption: Schematic of Aβ-induced synaptic impairments in AD. Left panel, an increase
  in NO as a result of toxic Aβ and/or an oxidized milieu leads to SNO-Uch-L1 formation
  and inhibition of Uch-L1 activity. This altered Uch-L1 activity promotes Aβ production/oligomerization
  as well as downregulation of the PKA/CREB pathway, resulting in synaptic impairments.
  Middle panel, Aβ oligomers in turn induce NO generation which then activates the
  Uch-L1/Cdk5/Drp1 transnitrosylation cascade, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and synaptic impairments. Right panel, the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction promotes
  further ROS production and an oxidizing environment, where increased NO generation
  triggers the transnitrosylation cascade and further disrupts mitochondrial function.
  Together, this form a vicious cycle where Aβ triggers increased NO production resulting
  in the Uch-L1/Cdk5/Drp1 transnitrosylation cascade leading to mitochondrial and
  synaptic impairments, and at the same time increasing Aβ and ROS production, so
  the cycle continues.
