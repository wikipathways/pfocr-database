caption: A model for the repair of abortive TOP2 cleavage complexes. Top, TOP2 becomes
  transiently linked to the 5′-terminus of a DSB during its normal catalytic cycle
  via a phosphotyrosine bond, represented by the 'Y' on the DNA strand. Occasionally,
  these TOP2 cleavage complexes (TOP2cc) can become abortive, and thus require DSB
  repair for their removal. TOP2 can be removed from the 5′-termini of the DSBs by
  a potentially mutagenic mechanism that employs nucleases such as MRE11/RAD50/NBS1
  (MRN) complex and CtIP. The DNA double strand break can then be repaired by homologous
  recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Alternatively, abortive
  TOP2cc can be repaired by TDP2-dependent mechanisms, providing an error-free route
  that does not require DNA degradation. Middle, the abortive TOP2cc is sumoylated
  by ZATT (left), and/or ubiquitylated (right). Bottom, TDP2 is recruited to the abortive
  TOP2cc by interaction with SUMO (left), and/or possibly ubiquitin (right), releasing
  TOP2 from the DSB by a hydrolytic mechanism. Note that the pathway on the left does
  not require proteosome activity, because ZATT and/or SUMO renders the phosphotyrosine
  bond accessible to TDP2. In contrast, the pathway on the right employs proteosome
  activity to render the 5′-phosphotyrosine bond visible to TDP2. Both TDP2-dependent
  pathways result in a DSB that can be ligated during NHEJ without nucleolytic processing,
  providing an error-free mechanism for DSB repair. Small black circles represents
  SUMO2 chains and orange circles represents ubiquitin chains.
