caption: 'Schematic representation of the crosstalk between the IGF-1 system and estrogens
  in breast cancer. Binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R triggers both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathways, leading to enhanced breast cancer growth and proliferation.
  S6K1, a downstream molecule of the AKT/mTOR pathway induces phosphorylation of ERα.
  Activated ERα acts as transcription factor, through direct binding to promoter of
  target genes, consequently upregulating IGF-1, IGF-1R and other ERα-induced genes
  which also stimulate breast cancer progression. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) along with
  HER2 and both phosphorylated AKT and MAPK enhance aromatase activity through post-transcriptional
  mechanisms leading to elevated estrogen levels. Estrogens further contribute to
  transcriptional regulation of both IGF-1 and IGF-1R, consequently recycling the
  system’s signaling, enhancing growth and proliferation of breast tumors. S6K1: Ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase 1 protein; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; HER2: human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 2 protein.'
