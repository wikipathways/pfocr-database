caption: Eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway and its activation by RTK/GFR → ERK1/2 signaling.
  Four major branches of the AA metabolic pathway are shown. COX-1/2, cyclooxygenase-1/2-dependent
  branch. COX-1/2 is also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) 1/2;
  LOX, lipoxygenase-dependent branch; CYP450, cytochrome P450-dependent branch; Non-enzymatic,
  free radical only-dependent branch. Unboxed abbreviations depict proteins and biosynthetic
  pathways. The boxed symbols identify AA and its metabolites that were measured in
  the current study by LC/MS/MS.
