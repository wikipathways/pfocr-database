caption: Mechanisms of cellular immunity in reversing immunosuppression for tumor
  therapy with T. gondii vaccination. The myeloid cells in tumor stroma are in an
  immunosuppressive state, resulting in the decline of antigen-presenting ability
  of the dendritic cells (DCs) and the subsequent low degree of immune responses.
  T. gondii infection in hosts or in situ of the tumor tissues can relieve this low
  immune response of the myeloid cells in the tumor tissues. DCs in the peripheral
  blood or tumor tissues can be activated, thus stimulating DC activation and changing
  the tumor microenvironment by secreting IL-12 to expand the signal of Th1 immune
  response. T. gondii antigens are powerful inducers of IL-12 production, which can
  trigger the expression of IL-12 through the host’s myeloid differentiation factor
  88 (MyD88) signaling pathway. As a cytokine with a wide range of biological activities,
  IL-12 mainly acts on natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.
  IL-12 is not only a determinant of Th1 cell immune response, but also an angiogenesis
  inhibitor. Finally, CD8+T cells, NK cells, and macrophages were recruited to the
  tumor tissue to play the role of scavenging tumor cells together with their secreted
  IL-12 and IFN-γ.
