caption: (a) Glycolysis is the biochemical pathway in which glucose is broken down
  by cells to make energy. In a normoglycemic environment, that is, in patients without
  diabetes, glycolysis proceeds down its well described path without shunting into
  the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, or pathways that would lead to AGE production
  or PKC activation. (b) In a hyperglycemic environment, as would be seen in patients
  with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, high glucose conditions lead to activation
  of excess superoxide which then inhibits the enzyme GADPH. This prevents glycolysis
  from proceeding down its natural course and creates a backlog of glycolysis precursors.
  Increased levels of glucose upregulate the polyol pathway whereas increased levels
  of fructose-6-phosphate upregulate the hexosamine pathway. Increased levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  upregulate both AGE precursors and DAG, the latter being a cofactor for PKC activation.
