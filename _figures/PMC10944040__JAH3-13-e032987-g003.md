caption: IL‐1 binding to its receptor IL‐1R1 and to IL‐1R AcP results in a downstream
  activation that eventually leads to IRAK4 and IRAK1 recruitment in order to bind
  to the adaptor protein MyD88. A series of IRAK4/1 phosphorylation and activation
  at multiple sites subsequently leads to IRAK1 dissociation from the receptor complex,
  leading to signaling cascades that induce transcription of proinflammatory genes.
  IL‐1β indicates interleukin‐1 beta; IL‐1R1, interleukin‐1 receptor type‐I; IL‐1R
  AcP, IL‐1 receptor accessory protein; IRAK1/4, interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated
  kinase 1/4; and MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88
