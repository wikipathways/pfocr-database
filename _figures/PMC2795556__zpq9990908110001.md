caption: Abridged outline of the completed 3-hydroxypropionate pathway of CO2 assimilation
  in C. aurantiacus showing two distinct stages. In the first part of this scheme,
  CO2 fixation leads to the formation of glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA. The second part
  of the pathway involves the assimilation of glyoxylate, with propionyl-CoA, to eventually
  form a dicarboxylic CoA ester, which is then cleaved to generate pyruvate and acetyl
  CoA. The acetyl-CoA formed in the second stage allows closure of the cycle with
  the first stage, while the pyruvate produced is used as a precursor metabolite for
  all subsequent metabolism.
