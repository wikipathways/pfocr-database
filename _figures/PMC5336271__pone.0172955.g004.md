caption: Venn diagram of keloid disease (KD) centre, margin and extralesional expression
  vs normal skin (NS), where A) refers to the epidermis and B) refers to the dermis.
  The red circle and text refer to the centre vs NS alone, the blue to margin vs NS
  and the green to extralesional keloid site alone vs NS. The black arrows and text
  refer to the enrichment results of where the expression of the indicated sites overlap.
  The orange arrow and text refers to the enrichment analysis of the indicated number
  of genes in common to all three keloid sites over NS. In both A) and B) enrichment
  analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and included canonical
  pathways, diseases & functions, networks and upstream regulators of interest. ANGPT2,
  angiopoietin 2; BCO1, beta-carotene oxygenase 1; BMP2, bone morphogenetic protein
  2; BRD4, bromodomain containing 4; DAB2, Dab, mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein,
  homolog 2 (drosophila); EGF, epidermal growth factor; EIF3E, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 3 subunit E; EOMES, eomesodermin; FBN1, fibrillin 1; FLT3, fms
  related tyrosine kinase 3; GSTP1, glutathione s-transferase pi 1; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor; HOXA13, homeobox A13; IFN, interferon; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor
  binding protein; IL, interleukin; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; JAK, janus
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MYC, c-Myc; MYOCD, myocardin; NRG1,
  neuregulin-1; OCT4, octamer-binding transcription factor 4; ORMDL3, orosomucoid
  like 3; OSM, oncostatin M; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PXR, pregnane X receptor; PRRX1, paired related homeobox 1RXR,
  retinoid X receptor; SERPINE1(PAI-1), serpin peptidase inhibitor. Clade E (plasminogen
  activator inhibitor 1); SMO, smoothened; SNAI1, snail family zinc finger 1; SOCS,
  suppressor of cytokine signalling; SPHK, sphingosine kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; STK11, serine/threonine kinase 11; TGF, transforming
  growth factor; TGM2, transglutaminase 2; TLE1, transducin like enhancer of split
  1; TNF(R), tumour necrosis factor (receptor); TP53, tumour protein 53; TSPYL5, testis-specific
