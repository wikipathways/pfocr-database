caption: Targeting the regulation of inflammatory immune responses using autophagy
  modulators at different stages of COVID-19. COVID-19 is divided into 3 stages, including
  the incubation, early and mild stage (81%), severe stage (14%), and critical and
  deceased stage (5%). The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and
  fatigue, and in more severe cases, breathing difficulties can occur. During the
  early phases of COVID-19, induction of the type I IFN response is essential in limiting
  viral replication and modulating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Upon
  entry into host cells via TMPRSS2 and ACE2 during the incubation, early, and mild
  stages, SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by the endosomal single-stranded (ss)RNA sensors TLR7/8
  and the cytosolic double-stranded (ds)RNA sensor RIG-I/MDA-5. Then, these sensors
  recruit adaptor proteins, including MyD88 and MAVS, which leads to the activation
  of the transcription factors IRF3/7 and the subsequent production of type I interferons
  (IFN-α/β). IFN-α/β bind to their receptor to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway,
  which leads to the formation of the STAT1–2-IRF9 complex and the subsequent induction
  of antiviral ISGs, such as RNase L. In addition, treatment with autophagy inhibitors,
  such as CQ/HCQ, can inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 by interfering with
  terminal N-glycosylation, as well as the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 and viral genome
  release, which ultimately reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection and increases the antiviral
  immune response of COVID-19. When COVID-19 enters the severe or critical and deceased
  stage, OXPLs accumulate in infected lungs and activate macrophages through the TLR4-TRAF6-NF-κB
  pathway. In addition, the virus in the endosome activates the TLR7-IRAK4 pathway,
  which promotes the activation of the TRAF6-NF-κB pathway and releases many inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α. Meanwhile, the NLRP3
  inflammasome is activated by the virus and ROS generated from damaged mitochondria,
  as well as other DAMPs, leading to the release of a large number of cytokines, including
  IL-1β and IL-18, which ultimately induce cell pyroptosis. Under the condition of
  a proinflammatory response in M1 macrophages, treatment with autophagy enhancers
  inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduces the production of cytokines
  and maintains the homeostasis and survival of macrophages.
