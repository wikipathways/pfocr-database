caption: A working schema of the senescence pathway performed by the dually located
  WHY1 in combination with H2O2. The nuclear isoform of WHY1 is represented as both
  a large molecular mass protein (L-band, bigger letters) and a small molecular mass
  protein (S-band, smaller letters). The WHY1 has dual functions in plastids and the
  nucleus. Loss of WHY1 or shifting the proteins to plastids increases H2O2 accumulation
  through an unknown pathway, resulting in a senescence phenotype. Elevated H2O2 represses
  nuclear WHY1 accumulation, promoting H3K9ac enrichment and RNAP II recruitment globally
  and specifically at the WRKY53 locus, and stimulating early senescence. Thus, distribution
  of WHY1 organelle isoforms and the putative feedback of H2O2 form a circularly integrated
  regulatory network during plant senescence in Arabidopsis. Plastid is shown as a
  green ovary, nucleus as a grey ovary, lines for regulation, fat arrows for transfer
  or translocation, and broken lines for uncertainty.
