caption: 'Schematic diagram of the BPV system based on a two-species microbial consortium
  with constrained electron flow. The microbial consortium comprises an engineered
  cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 (Syn2973-omcS-ldh) and an engineered
  Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (S. oneidensis-ΔnapA). Strain Syn2973-omcS-ldh, equipped
  with the photosynthetic machinery and a d-lactate synthesis pathway, harvests light
  to perform H2O photolysis and generates high-energy electrons (e−). The electrons
  are transferred and the subsequently generated NADPH and ATP are used for CO2 fixation
  and d-lactate production. Strain S. oneidensis-ΔnapA, a napA deletion mutant, equipped
  with a d-lactate oxidation pathway and the EET machinery, releases electrons from
  d-lactate and transfers them to the anode for electricity production. The released
  CO2 can be re-assimilated by cyanobacteria for d-lactate production. The dotted
  arrows show the routes of electron transfer in the photosynthetic machinery and
  EET machinery. PSI/II: photosystem I/II; PQH2: plastoquinol; Cyt b6f: cytochrome
