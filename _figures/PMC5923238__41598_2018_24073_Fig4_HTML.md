caption: Key genes differentially regulated in the fatty acid synthesis pathway in
  C. chekiangoleosa. Image shows the key enzymes encoded by DEGs highlighted in the
  pink box in the fatty acid synthesis pathway. The heatmap at the bottom right shows
  the expression levels of the corresponding DEGs in the pathway. LY and HY represent
  the low-yield and high-yield phenotypes of C. chekiangoleosa. ACC, FabF, FabG and
  FabB represent the key enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 [EC:6.4.1.2], 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]
  synthase II [EC:2.3.1.179] (FabF), 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] reductase [EC:1.1.1.100]
  (FabG), and fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B [EC:3.1.2.14] (FabB), respectively. ACC-1,
  -2, and -3 represent three different encoding genes.
