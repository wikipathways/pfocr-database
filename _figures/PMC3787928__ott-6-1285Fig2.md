caption: 'Mechanisms of action of Smac mimetics.Notes: IAPs are important regulators
  of NF-κB-activating signaling pathways. Upon TNFα stimulation, cIAPs and RIP1 are
  recruited to TNFR1 via the adaptors TRADD and TRAF2. cIAPs trigger self-ubiquitination
  and ubiquitination of RIP1. These ubiquitin chains serve as a scaffold for the recruitment
  of IKK, TAK, and LUBAC. Once activated, IKK complex triggers phosphorylation of
  IκBα, which is then degraded by the UPS and releases NF-κB dimer, which promotes
  the transcription of target genes. In the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation,
  cIAPs promote the degradative ubiquitination of NIK and associated TRAF proteins
  and prevent the activation the IKK complex required for transcription factor activation.
  On the other hand, cIAPs and XIAP prevent the assembly of RIP1-containing initiator
  caspase-activating complexes, named complex-II and Ripoptosome; and XIAP inhibits,
  through a direct interaction via BIR2 and BIR3, the activity of caspase-3, -7, and
  -9. SMs bind to the BIR domains of cIAPs and stimulate their E3-ubiquitine ligase
  activity. This results first, in the ubiquitination of RIP1, leading to the canonical
  NF-κB activation, and second, in the rapid autoubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated
  degradation of cIAPs. Depletion of cIAPs releases NIK, resulting in the noncanonical
  activation of NF-κB, and NF-κB target gene expression, including TNFα, MCP-1, and
  IL-6. TNFα engages TNFR1 via an autocrine pathway. In the absence of cIAP1, stimulation
  of TNFR1 triggers the assembly of the secondary RIP1-containing cytoplasmic complex
  (complex II), leading to cell death. SM-mediated IAP depletion can also favor the
  formation of the Ripoptosome, leading to cell death.Abbreviations: BIR, baculoviral
