caption: TCM polysaccharides’ role in regulating tumor innate immune response. TCM
  polysaccharides (such as Ginseng polysaccharides) can trigger the DCs to secrete
  the TNF-α and IL-12 through the typical NF-κB signaling pathway by binding to TLR4/TLR2.
  Meanwhile, TCM Polysaccharides promote NK cells to kill tumor cells by directly
  recognizing the TLRs-MyD88 complex and eventually activating the MAPK and NF- κ
  B signaling pathway to produce TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. TCM Polysaccharides (such
  as Astragalus membranaceus Polysaccharide) enhance the differentiation of monocytes
  into M1 macrophages through the combination with CD11 and CD14/TLR-4 complex. The
  elevated transcription of iNOS and expression of NO, TNF-α, and IL-1β is helpful
  in inhibiting tumor growth. TCM Polysaccharides can also activate the macrophages
  directly by binding to the TLR4
