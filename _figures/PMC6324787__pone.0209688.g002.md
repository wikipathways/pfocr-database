caption: 'Solid arrows indicate the directions of metabolic processes. Dotted arrow
  shown in the pentose phosphate pathway (purple circle) indicates further reactions
  down the pathway. Double arrows indicate transports of molecules. Proteins whose
  names have been striked through indicate that homologs could not be identified among
  S. pneumonia strains. To correspond to , candidate gene products in our study (SP
  0317, SP 0318, SP 0320), the PTS transport system (SP 0321, SP 0323, SP 0324, SP
  0325) along with glucuronyl hydrolase (SP 0322), and the hyaluronate lyase (Hyl)
  protein have been highlighted in orange, pink, and green, respectively. We postulate
  that SP 0675 functions as a glucose dehydrogenase, catalyzing the conversion of
  D-glucose to D-gluconate. In S. pneumoniae, KDG can be derived from two sources:
  mannonate and D-gluconate, via catabolism of hyaluronate (a glycosaminoglycan) and
  L-idonate, respectively. Catabolism of hyaluronate is initiated by a hyaluronate
  lyase (Hyl, encoded by SP 0314, located downstream to the kdg region). Hyl cleaves
  hyaluronate into disaccharides [], which enter bacterial cell via a PTS transport
  system (encoded by SP 0321, SP 0323, SP 0324, SP 0325, upstream to the kdg region)
  [, ]. Once inside the cell, the disaccharides are further broken down into monosaccharides
  (D-glucuronate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) through glucuronyl hydrolase (Ugl), encoded
  by SP 0322 [, ]. It is likely that the monosaccharide D-glucuronate is metabolized
  to KDG in S. pneumoniae via the enzymatic actions carried out by glucuronate isomerase
  (UxaC), fructuronate reductase (UxuB) and mannonate dehydratase (UxuA) as described
  in E. coli [, ]. Although the homolog of E. coli’s UxuB, which catalyzes the conversion
  of fructuronate to mannonate, could not be identified in S. pneumoniae (with mannitol-1-phosphate
  5-dehydrogenase [SP 0397] being the closest homolog, sharing 25% amino acid identity),
  it is possible that an uncharacterized enzyme or an enzyme with multiple functions
  could carry out this process. Interestingly, the homologs of UxaC and UxuA of E.
  coli (which respectively catalyze the conversions of glucuronate to fructuronate
  and mannonate to KDG) were only identified in the single S. pneumoniae strain, 70585
  (their names are respectively SP70585_ 2238 and SP70585_ 2237). In addition to the
  degradation of hyaluronate, which yields mannonate as a precursor molecule of KDG,
  metabolism of L-idonate and its subsequent conversion to D-gluconate is an alternative
  source of KDG in S. pneumoniae. Metabolism of L-idonate to D-gluconate occurs via
  two enzymatic processes: 1) the conversion of L-idonate to 5KG, carried out by L-idonate
  5 dehydrogenase (IdnD) (encoded by SP 0285); and 2) conversion of 5KG to D-gluconate
  by IdnO (encoded by one of the candidate genes in our study: SP 0320) []. Although
  it has been shown in other organisms that KDG could be derived from other sources,
  such as the hexuronate galacturonate and plant pectin [–], these are less likely
  to be relevant in S. pneumoniae as none of the homologs required for the metabolism
  of galacturonate and pectin could be identified in S. pneumoniae. Metabolism of
  KDG to G3P via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (shown in green) requires the enzymatic
  actions of KdgK and KdgA, which are respectively encoded by two of the genes in
  our study: SP 0318 and SP 0317. KdgK and KdgA convert KDG to KDGP and KDGP to G3P
  and pyruvate, respectively. G3P produced could subsequently enter the latter steps
  of glycolysis (circled in orange) to yield further pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate.
