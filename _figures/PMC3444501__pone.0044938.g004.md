caption: (A) Constructed minimum protein-protein interaction network between targets
  of AGS-IV. Red and green nodes denote putative targets of AGS-IV. Red nodes have
  been reported in the literature as drug targets or potential targets for CVD therapy;
  green nodes are predicted by the INVDOCK but with no literature support. Grey nodes
  are proteins that link the targets together. The network was decomposed into topological
  compact modules, labeled with numbers, by a simulated annealing algorithm. (B) Drug-target
  network for cardiovascular drugs related to AGS-IV. Circles and triangles represent
  drugs and targets, respectively. AGS-IV and its putative direct targets are highlighted
  in red. Nodes for other drugs are colored according to their ATC codes at the 4th
  level (ATC codes are codes in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification
  System used for the classification of drugs, which is controlled by the WHO Collaborating
  Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC). Drugs are classified into groups
  at 5 different levels in this coding system, in which the 4th level of the code
  indicates the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup). (C) Target-pathway
  network for putative targets of AGS-IV. Circles and squares represent targets and
  pathways, respectively. Target nodes are colored according to Drugbank drug classes.
  Known targets of approved CVD drugs are highlighted in red. (D) Pathway associated
  with myocardial ischemia injury. This pathway was constructed by integrating pathways
  reported to be involved in the process of myocardial ischemia injury, including
  the calcium signaling, MAPK, JAK-STAT and NF-KB pathway. Red and pink boxes indicate
  putative target proteins of AGS-IV; targets in red were experimentally validated
  in this study.
