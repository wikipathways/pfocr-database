caption: Schematic depiction of major regulatory signaling pathways of autophagy.
  (a) Possible role of AMPK–mTOR–ULK1/2 signaling cascade. Mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) activation is controlled by the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2) and
  ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). Under conditions of low-energy (high AMP/ATP
  ratio), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and activates TSC1/2,
  thereby inhibiting mTORC1. Under glucose starvation, AMPK promotes autophagy by
  directly activating Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1/2 (ULK1/2) through
  phosphorylation. The two protein complexes AMPK and mTORC1 are known to oppositely
  regulate the autophagy inducing complex ULK1/2-Atg13-Atg101-FIP200. ULK1 directly
  phosphorylates beclin-1 and enhances pro-autophagic lipid kinase VPS34 to promote
  autophagy. (b) Amino acid signaling to mechanistic target of mTORC1. mTORC1 interacts
  with the Ragulator-Rag complex on the surface of the lysosome in response to amino
  acid levels in the cell. Under amino acid sufficiency, the v-ATPase-Ragulator complex
  is activated through a lysosomal mechanism, which in turn promotes the GTP-charging
  of RagA/B via a GEF function of the ragulator. Activated Rags then recruit mTORC1
  to the lysosomal surface, where mTORC1 can be activated by Rheb which integrates
  amino acid signals with other upstream signals converging on the Rheb GTPase. (c)
  ZKSCAN3, a zinc finger family DNA-binding protein, and transcription factor EB (TFEB)
  regulate autophagy in opposite directions. The transcriptional repressor ZKSCAN3
  downregulates autophagy-related gene expressions. The subcellular localization and
  activity of TFEB are regulated by mechanistic target of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation.
  Under normal nutrient-rich conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTORC1 on the lysosomal
  surface and is retained in the cytoplasm. During nutrient deprivation (starvation)
  or lysosomal stress (physical exercise), mTORC1 is inactivated and no longer able
  to phosphorylate TFEB. Dephosphorylated TFEB can freely translocate to the nucleus,
  where it activates the transcription of a network of genes that regulates the lysosomal/autophagic
  pathway. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
