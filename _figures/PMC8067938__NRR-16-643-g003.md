caption: Gain-of-function of Hippo signaling triggers cell death by various mechanisms.Figure
  shows mechanisms of actions of Hippo pathway to cause cell death. (a) Activation
  of Hippo pathway results in inactivation of Yki leading to cell death. (b) Cell
  death caused by activation of downstream target Wg in Drosophila eye. (c) Caspase
  induced cell death. (d) Cell death caused by activation of Hippo pathway which further
  activates JNK signaling directly or through a feedback loop as seen in Alzheimer’s
  disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (e) Stress induced activation of pro-apoptotic
  genes resulting in cell death.
