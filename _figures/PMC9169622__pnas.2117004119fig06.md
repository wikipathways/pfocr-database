caption: Progesterone/GPR126-mediated cellular function is dependent on Gi-triggered
  SRC activation. (A) Cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with progesterone
  (P4, 10 nM), Src-I1 (2 μM), and PTX (100 ng/mL) for 72 h alone or in combination
  was detected using MTT assay. Cell viability in P4 treated cells were compared to
  that in vehicle group cells, relatively. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM
  and Student’s t test was used for comparisons between two groups. ns, not significant,
  ***P < 0.001. (B) Schematic diagram of progesterone and 17OHP induced-GPR126 activation
  in promoting TNBC development via the Gi-SRC pathway. TNBC, cell membrane, G proteins
  and DNA cartoon elements were obtained from BioRender.
