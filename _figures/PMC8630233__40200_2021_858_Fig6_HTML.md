caption: LPS triggering the inflammatory pathway. LPS is recognised and bound by LBP.
  Bacterial fragments and LPS are recognised by TLRs. LPS binds and activates TLR4,
  triggering dimerisation, and the recruitment of downstream adaptor molecules such
  as MyD88/MAL to mount an inflammatory response. Activated MyD88/MAL recruits IRAK),
  TRAF6, TAK1, JNK and IKK complexes. The IKK complex converges at NF-kB, which is
  maintained in the inactive state by IKKB. This, in turn, is degraded by proteasomes,
  resulting in the translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus, activating the release
  of pro-inflammatory molecules TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS
