caption: The biosynthesis of aquastatin-related heteromeric depsides. (A) Phylogenetic
  analysis of TE domain sequences from selected fungal NR-PKSs. TE domain sequences
  from depside-forming NR-PKSs that utilise the SAT domain for depside bond formation
  are distantly related to NR-PKSs that employ the TE domain for this purpose. TE-releasing
  mechanisms are indicated. A more extensive phylogenetic analysis is presented in
  Fig. S119†. (B) The proposed biosynthetic pathway to the aquastatins
