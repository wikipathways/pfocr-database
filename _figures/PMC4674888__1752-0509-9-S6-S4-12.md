caption: LRRK2 in neurons in Parkinson's disease which is the fifth scored pathway
  map in MetaCore enrichment analysis results. Mutation in LRRK2 (R1441C, R1441G,
  R1441H, Y1699C, I2020T and G2019S) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's
  disease, and LRRK2 stimulates various pathways leading to progression of Parkinson's
  disease. Ubiquitin was down-regulated in stoke samples at 3, 5, 24 hours and overall
  stroke samples as compared with control. LRRK2 was up-regulated in overall stroke
  samples.
