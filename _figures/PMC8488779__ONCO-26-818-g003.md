caption: 'Therapeutic inhibition of oncogenic signaling in ETV6‐NTRK3 fusion–positive
  tumors. The wild‐type transmembrane TRKC protein dimerizes and auto‐phosphorylates
  following NT‐3 binding, leading to regulated activation of the PI3K‐AKT pathway.
  NT‐3 also binds with lower affinity to wild‐type TRKA and TRKB, activating downstream
  signal trasnduction effectors including PI3K‐AKT, RAS‐MAPK, and PLCγ. In ETV6‐NTRK3
  fusion–positive tumors, the intracellular ETV6‐NTRK3 chimeric protein undergoes
  ligand‐independent homo‐ or hetero‐dimerization, leading to constitutive, aberrant
  activation of oncogenic signaling, causing increased cell growth, survival, and
  differentiation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved TRK inhibitors larotrectinib
  and entrectinib bind and block the ATP binding site of the ETV6‐NTRK3 fusion protein
  to prevent its oncogenic signaling. Created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations: AKT,
  anaplastic lymphoma kinase; ETV6, ETS variant transcription factor 6; MAPK, mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase; NT‐3, neurotrophin 3; NTRK3, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase
