caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the multiple actions of HVH-2930 on the HER2
  signaling pathway and the HSP90-HSF1 axis in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive
  breast cancer. HVH-2930 exerts potent antitumor activity by addressing trastuzumab
  resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer without triggering the HSR. As a novel
  C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor, HVH-2930 downregulates full-length HER2, p95HER2, and
  other HER family members. It also attenuates heterodimerization of HER2/HER3 or
  HER2/EGFR, leading to the disruption of multiple survival pathways, including PI3K/AKT
  and MEK/ERK signaling. These phenomena are associated with the direct modulation
  of the HSP90 chaperone complex without HSF1 activation. Furthermore, the impairment
  of the HSP90-HSF1 axis by HVH-2930 leads to the suppression of CSC-like properties
  and the downregulation of MDR1, a multidrug efflux pump. In trastuzumab-resistant
  xenograft models, HVH-2930 retards tumor growth and angiogenesis, and impedes metastatic
  ability. Notably, the combination of HVH-2930 and paclitaxel eliminates both rapidly
  proliferating cancer cells and CSCs, resulting in a synergistic increase in antitumor
  efficacy
