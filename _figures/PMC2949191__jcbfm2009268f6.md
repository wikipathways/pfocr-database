caption: Scheme outlining the novel role of Nogo-A in controlling neuronal survival
  in the ischemic brain. When Nogo-A signaling pathway is active, through the putative
  receptor and/or directly through its N-terminal inhibitory region (NiG) (as shown
  in A), the small GTPase RhoA is active, whereas the Rho GTPases members Rac1 and
  RhoB are inactive. As a consequence of Rac1 inactivation, the p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2
  pathways are inhibited, and PTEN activity is controlled and maintained low by increasing
  its phosphorylation via Rock2, and the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways are active,
  thus enhancing p53 degradation and promoting neuronal survival. Nogo-A signaling
  inhibition, on the other hand (as shown in B), deactivates RhoA, at the same time
  overactivates Rac1 and RhoB, the former of which mediates the activation of the
  p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2 stress response via direct interaction. Deactivation of
  RhoA, as a consequence of Nogo-A inhibition, inactivates its direct downstream effector
  Rock2, therefore the latter looses PTEN phosphorylation control, whereby the PTEN
  phosphatase is activated, which in turn deactivates PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways
  and induces death signaling by stabilizing p53. Black complete lines were used for
  direct signaling pathways, and black dashed lines were used for indirect signaling
  pathways.
