caption: ISM5939 facilitates the accumulation of extracellular cGAMP by blocking ENPP1-dependent
  degradation, thereby triggering the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs). This activation effectively enhances the activity of CD8 + T cells.
  Additionally, ISM5939 diminishes adenosine production by inhibiting ENPP1-mediated
  ATP hydrolysis, potentially mitigating the suppression of tumor-infiltrating T cells
