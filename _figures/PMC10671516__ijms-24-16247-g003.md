caption: Effects of granulosa cell glucose and lipid metabolism on oocytes. Glucose
  metabolism in granulosa cells mainly includes glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway, and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Granulosa cells deliver energy
  precursors such as pyruvate and lactate to granulosa cells through glycolysis. GSH
  and NADPH are supplied to oocytes through the pentose phosphate pathway, which contributes
  to oxidative stress inhibition and mitotic regulation. Hyaluronic acid dissection
  is stabilized through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway to maintain oocyte energy
  supply. Granulosa cell lipid metabolism is mainly divided into fatty acid metabolism
  and steroid metabolism. For fatty acid metabolism, granulosa cell β-oxidation products
  and oocyte meiosis-related factors promote each other to meet the meiotic energy
  supply. For steroid metabolism, granulosa cells can metabolize estrogen, progesterone,
  cortisol, and other hormones to achieve oocyte growth regulation. MCG—mural granulosa

  description: Effects of granulosa cell glucose and lipid metabolism on oocytes.
    Glucose metabolism in granulosa cells mainly includes glycolysis, the pentose
    phosphate pathway, and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Granulosa cells deliver
    energy precursors such as pyruvate and lactate to granulosa cells through glycolysis.
    GSH and NADPH are supplied to oocytes through the pentose phosphate pathway, which
    contributes to oxidative stress inhibition and mitotic regulation. Hyaluronic
    acid dissection is stabilized through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway to maintain
    oocyte energy supply. Granulosa cell lipid metabolism is mainly divided into fatty
    acid metabolism and steroid metabolism. For fatty acid metabolism, granulosa cell
    β-oxidation products and oocyte meiosis-related factors promote each other to
    meet the meiotic energy supply. For steroid metabolism, granulosa cells can metabolize
    estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, and other hormones to achieve oocyte growth
    regulation. MCG—mural granulosa cell; PFK—phosphofructokinase; PDK—pyruvate dehydrogenase
