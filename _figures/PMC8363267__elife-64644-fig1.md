caption: '(A) Five pathways are included in the model: calcium activation of (1) RasGRF
  followed by RasGTP production or (2) CaMKII phosphorylation of SynGap followed by
  increasing RasGTP and Rap1GTP lifetime; cAMP activation of (3) Epac or (4) PKA phosphorylation
  of Src family kinase, leading to Rap1GTP production; Gi subtype of GTP binding protein
  (Giβγ) (5) recruits Src family kinase followed by activation of RasGTP. (B) Four
  effects of CaMKII on SynGap were evaluated. KCK: No autophosphorylation of CaMKII,
  KSyn1: No pCaMKII binding to SynGap, KSyn2: SynGap binds to pCaMKII, but cannot
  be phosphorylated, KSyn3: SynGap phosphorylated, but not dispersed to the dendrite.
  (C) LTP protocols: four trains of 100 Hz (each 1 s duration) spaced by different
  intertrial intervals: 3, 20, 40, 80, and 300 s. Figure 1—source data 1.Reactions
  and rate constants involved in signaling pathway leading to Ras and Rap1 activation.  Figure
