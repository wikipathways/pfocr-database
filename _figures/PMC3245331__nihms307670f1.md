caption: 'The presumed biosynthetic route to 1a-d is shown along with isolable intermediates
  and shunt products. Abbreviations: IM (initiation module = ketosynthase III, acyl
  carrier protein, acyl-ACP thioesterase); min PKS (minimal polyketide synthase =
  ketosynthase/chain length factor (KS/CLF), acyl carrier protein (ACP), malonyl-CoA:ACP
  transacylase (MAT)); C9 KR = C-9 ketoreductase encoded by actIII; ARO = 1st ring
  aromatase encoded by actVII; CYC = 2nd ring cyclase encoded by actIV; C3 KR = C-3
  ketoreductase encoded by actVI-ORF1; ER = enoyl reductase encoded by actVI-ORF2;
  OXY = oxygenase, encoded by an unidentified enzyme in the S. coelicolor genome.
  The natural product frenolicin A, (3) produced by S. roseofulvus, and the natural
  product actinorhodin, (4) produced by S. coelicolor, are also shown forming from
  their corresponding carboxylic acids, 2. For details, see text.'
