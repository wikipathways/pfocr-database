caption: A summary of the main enzymes involved in the classic and alternative bile
  acid biosynthesis pathways. The classic pathway is controlled by the rate limiting
  enzyme CYP7A1 and the alternative pathway is controlled by CYP27A1; both pathways
  culminate in the production of cholic acid (CA) and chenodexoycholic acid (CDCA),
  the ratio of which depends on the activity of CYP8B1. Briefly, bile-acid biosynthesis
  begins with the modification of the ring structure of cholesterol, which involves
  oxidation and shortening of the side chain []. In the classic pathway, cholesterol
  is converted into 7 α-hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1 and in subsequent steps, cytochrome
  P450 Family 8 Subfamily B Member 1a (CYP8B1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1)
  are required for the synthesis of cholic acid (CA). Without CYP8B1, the product
  is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which is formed via the activity of CYP27A1 alone.
  The acidic pathway (or alternative pathway) is initiated by CYP27A1 and relies on
  25-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) to produce CDCA.
