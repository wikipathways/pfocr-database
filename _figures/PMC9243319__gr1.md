caption: Single stranded DNA breaks (ssDNA) can be repaired by PARP pathway. PARP
  inhibitor (PARPi) treatment restrain PARP repairing ssDNA and lead to double-stranded
  DNA (dsDNA) breaks which then undergo homologous recombination (HR). When coming
  to DNA repair via HR pathway, BRCA mutated cells are unable to undergo and lead
  to cell death. Both PARP inhibition and BRCA mutation are needed for cell death.
  In case of defects of both HR and NHEJ, inhibition of PARP restrains activation
  of alternative NHEJ (Alt-EJ) which contributes to dsDNA repairment when NHEJ components
  are missing. With the formation of PARP-DNA complexes PARP trapping may occur restraining
  DNA replication and transcription. But PARP inhibitors' trapping ability varies
  significantly.
