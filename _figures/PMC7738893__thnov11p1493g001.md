caption: Mechanisms of action of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in cancer therapy. Antibody-based
  therapeutic strategies (A-E) in solid tumors include both direct and indirect tumor
  cell killing. A) Antibodies acting by functional neutralization of receptor(s) on
  tumor cells. Antibody binding to overexpressed HER family receptors (HER1, HER2,
  HER3) on tumor cells, interfere with ligand binding or inhibit their homo- and hetero-
  dimerization with other HER family members and inhibit activation of downstream
  MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways that promote growth, migration, and proliferation
  of tumor cells. Antibodies against c- met receptor block STAT3/JNK and PI3K/AKT
  signaling and inhibit tumor cell transformation, survival, and proliferation. Recently
  developed class of agonistic antibodies to TNF superfamily death receptors DR4 and
  DR5 stimulate apoptosis through Bax/Bak and Caspase 9 pathway. B) Binding of antibodies
  to tumor vasculature receptors VEGFR1, VEGFR2, or their ligand VEGFA inhibits endothelial
  cell proliferation, migration, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis by interfering
  with PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and MEK/ERK signaling. C) Antibodies to immune checkpoint molecules,
  which include inhibitory (CTLA4) and co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1) present on immune
  cells or their ligands upregulated by tumor cells (PD-L1), reverse T cell exhaustion.
  Anti-PD-1 antibodies interfere with tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 recruitment and allow
  TCR (CD3) induced PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling activation, cell survival, and proliferation.
  Anti-CTLA4 antibodies inhibit PP2A recruitment and CD3 dephosphorylation and activate
  PI3K/AKT, mTOR, NF-kB signaling pathways. D) Antibodies bound to tumor cells display
  antibody-dependent cell cytotoxic (ADCC) activity by engaging FcγR, present on the
  effector cells such as NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. This interaction
  induces ITAM phosphorylation and binding to tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and SYK, which
  in turn activate PI3K and SOS. PIP3 generated through PI3K activation recruit BTK
  and PLCγ. RAS, BTK, and PLC activate downstream ERK, p38 and JNK signaling pathway
  along with calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which result in
  the release of cytokines and cytotoxic granules as IFNγ, perforin, and granzymes
  from NK cells and actin remodeling, which finally cause tumor cell apoptosis. Antibody
  bound tumor cells are recognized by neutrophils and macrophages and trigger oxidative
  burst and phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages, leading to lysosomal degradation
  of tumor cells. E) Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) possess specificity of mAb and
  cytotoxic potential of payload drug. ADCs bind to target antigen, get internalized,
  and undergo endocytic processing. Once in the cell, ADCs cleavage occurs, and the
  active cytotoxic drug is released into the cytoplasm where it inhibits microtubule
  polymerization and subsequently, tumor cell death. HER, human epidermal growth factor
