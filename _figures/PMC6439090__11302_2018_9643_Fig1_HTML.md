caption: The purine nucleotide degradation pathway in the CNS. ATP (1) is an extracellular
  signaling molecule that is metabolized to ADP (2) and AMP (3) by various ectonucleosidases.
  3 is metabolized by 5′-nucleotidase to form adenosine (4), which is taken up into
  the cell by nucleoside transporters. Adenosine (4) is a neuromodulator that exhibits
  anti-inflammatory effects. 4 is converted to inosine (5) via the action of adenosine
  deaminase. Accumulation of 5 is associated with worsening PD and disruption of the
  purine metabolic pathway. In addition, 4 can be rapidly phosphorylated to 3 by adenosine
  kinase. Nucleoside phosphorylase catalyzes de-ribosylation of 5 to hypoxanthine.
  Xanthine oxidase converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and uric acid (6), which is an
  antioxidant and is correlated with decreased PD progression
