caption: Hypothetic schema of EP3 signaling in the migration of human cervical cancer
  cells. Inhibiting EP3 signaling contributes to phosphorylation of extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK1/2) and translocation of p53 from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus, resulting in an increased transcription of PAI-1. High expression
  of PAI-1 reduces uPAR cleavage (Magnussen et al. ), thus leading to decreased migration
  of cervical cancer cells. The EP3 signaling pathway is similar to the one that transforming
  growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) induces PAI-1 gene expression via the rapid generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the mobilization
  of p53 signaling (Samarakoon et al. ; Wilkins-Port et al. ). In addition, cytoplasmic
  p53 is decreased in the cervical cancer cells with high expression of uPAR, which
  is correlated with poor prognosis in overall survival rates of cervical cancer patients
  with advanced FIGO stages (III/IV). Therefore, we believed that EP3 signaling regulates
  the migration of cervical cancer cells through plasminogen activator inhibitor type
  1 (PAI-1) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)
