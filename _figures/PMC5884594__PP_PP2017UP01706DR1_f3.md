caption: Overview of the plant ethylene signal transduction pathway. Ethylene binds
  the ethylene receptors (ETR) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in autophosphorylation
  of the receptor and inactivation of the downstream kinase CTR1. In the absence of
  ethylene, CTR1 phosphorylates the ER-localized EIN2, directing it for proteasomal
  degradation by the ETPs(EIN2 TARGETING PROTEINS). When ethylene is present, the
  EIN2 C-terminal part (EIN2-C) is not phosphorylated and gets cleaved and migrates
  to the nucleus, where it activates the master transcription factor EIN3 and EILs.
  In the absence of ethylene, EIN3 and EILs are targeted for proteasomal degradation
  by the ETHYLENE BINDING FACTOR (EBF). EIN3 and EILs, in turn, activate ethylene
  response factors (ERFs) or ethylene-responsive genes. The EIN2-C also can interact
  with the mRNA of selected transcripts, including the 5′ untranslated region of the
  EBF mRNA, to inhibit translation.
