caption: RGMa signaling in aNSCs. Adult neural stem cells residing in the subgranular
  zone of the dentate gyrus are self-renewing, multipotent cells that differentiate
  into neurons and neuroglia throughout adulthood. We found that RGMa activates the
  RhoA/ROCK pathway in aNSCs via the Neogenin receptor. This activation causes inhibition
  of neurite growth and induction of cell death, resulting in RGMa-mediated suppression
  of adult neurogenesis. aNSCs indicates adult neural stem cells; RGMa, repulsive
  guidance molecule A; RhoA, ras homolog gene family member A; ROCK, Rho-associated
  protein kinase.
