caption: Targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway for normal tissue protection. Molecular binding
  on receptor associated to heterotrimeric G-proteins activated Rho protein by a shift
  between Rho-guanosin diphosphate (Rho-GDP) to Rho-guanosin triphosphate (Rho-GTP).
  This activation of Rho induced in cascade Rho kinase activation. As a consequence
  immune response, fibrosis and vascular damage were modulated. Rho protein anchorage
  to cytoplasmic membrane depends on the isoprenylation. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) required for this post-translational modification come from cholesterol metabolism,
  and may be inhibited by statins.
