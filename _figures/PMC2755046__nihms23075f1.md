caption: Adiponectin-mediated regulation of inflammatory responses in different cell
  types. Adiponectin negatively regulates CRP and TNF-α expression in adipose tissue,
  whereas adiponectin expression is inhibited by TNF-α and IL-6. Adiponectin inhibits
  IL-8, VCAM-1 and ROS production in endothelial cells through cAMP-PKA-dependent
  signaling. Adiponectin also stimulates AMPK activation in endothelial cells, leading
  to activation of eNOS. Adiponectin suppresses TNF-α production in cardiac cells
  through its ability to stimulate the COX-2-PGE2 pathway. In macrophages, adiponectin
  attenuates TNF-α and IL-6 production through its ability to suppress NF-κB activation,
  and enhances IL-10 expression resulting in increase in TIMP-1 production. Adiponectin
  inhibits foam cell formation by reducing SR-A expression.
