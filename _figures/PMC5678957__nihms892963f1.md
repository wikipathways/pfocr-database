caption: (A) APOL1 enters the trypanosome as a component of HDL3 particles via endocytosis
  at the flagellar pocket and is trafficked to the lysosome. Independent studies report
  different mechanisms of trypanosomal killing. Activation of the APOL1 channel activity
  within the lysosome has been reported to cause lysosomal swelling and trypanolysis.
  Others have found trypanolytic activity has localized to the plasma membrane, or
  the mitochondria. (B) Studies overexpressing APOL1 in human cells have reported
  that its expression leads to the movement of the transcription factor EB (TFEB)
  from the cytosol to the nucleus where it induces the transcription of genes necessary
  for the upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis and increases endosomal trafficking.
  The upregulation of these pathways contributes to the restriction of HIV-1 infection
  in this report. (C) Other investigators found that overexpressed APOL1-G1 and-G2,
  but not G0, can localize to the plasma membrane where it allows the efflux of potassium
  driving the phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK and inhibition of gp130-STAT3
  signaling that may change the cells transcriptional program. Activation of the p38/STAT3
  pathway downstream of channel activity at the plasma membrane was observed only
  after expression of the kidney disease risk variants of APOL1.
