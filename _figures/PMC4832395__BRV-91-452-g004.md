caption: Regulation of de novo lipogenesis by SREBP1c and ChREBP. Insulin activation
  of the insulin receptor leads to phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1
  (IRS1), which subsequently activates phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K), leading to
  the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)‐bisphosphate (PIP2) to form phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)‐trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates both phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) (Gan et al., ). mTORC2
  and PDK1 each lead to phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), with mTORC2 promoting
  PKB‐mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Hagiwara et al.,
  ). PKB also activates mTORC1, leading to activation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase
  1 (S6K1) which leads to nuclear localisation of liver X receptor α (LXRα) (Hwahng
  et al., ), heterodimerisation with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and subsequent transcription
  of lipogenic genes including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c).
  Full maturation of SREBP1c is promoted by the activity of mTORC1 through inhibition
  of lipin 1 (Peterson et al., ), as well as through inhibition of GSK3β by PKB. Both
  of these events leads to disinhibition of SREBP1c maturation and nuclear localisation.
  The nascent SREBP1c is a transmembrane protein in the lipid bilayer of the endoplamic
  reticulum (ER), associated with SREBP cleavage activated protein (SCAP), and insulin‐induced
  gene 1 (INSIG1). INSIG1 inhibits the SCAP‐mediated shuttling of SREBP1c to the Golgi
  apparatus via coat protein II (COPII)‐coated vesicles. When SREBP1c and SCAP are
  phosphorylated or sterols bind to SCAP it changes conformation dissociating from
  INSIG1 and allowing interaction with COPII coat proteins. SREBP1c is subsequently
  cleaved by two proteases, site 1‐protease (S1P) and site 2‐protease (S2P), in the
  Golgi leading to dissociation of SREBP1c from SCAP and removal of the transmembrane
  domain to allow the mature form of SREBP1c to localise to the nucleus. Once in the
  nucleus SREBP1c promotes transcription of lipogenic genes including fatty acid synthase
  (FAS), stearoyl‐CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), elongation of long‐chain fatty acids family
  member 6 (ELOVL6), and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Glucose delivery to the hepatocyte
  also stimulated the transcription of lipogenic genes via the activation of carbohydrate
  response element binding protein (ChREBP). This occurs as glucose enters hepatocytes
  via glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and enters the glycolytic pathway. Initially
  glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6‐phosphate (G6P), followed by isomerisation
  to fructose 6‐phosphate (F6P) and further phosphorylation to fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphate
  (F2,6P) through glycolysis. It has been suggested that both G6P and F2,6P through
  incompletely elucidated pathways lead to the dephosphorylation of ChREBP and dissociation
  from the cytosolic protein 14‐3‐3. This allows nuclear localisation of ChREBP and
  subsequent transcription of its target lipogenic genes, including FAS, SCD1, ELOVL6,
  ACC and pyruvate kinase, liver and RBC (Pklr).
