caption: 'Quorum sensing system in P. aeruginosa and the interference of natural products
  on quorum sensing system. There are three key pathways in the P. aeruginosa QS system:
  two LuxI/LuxR-type QS pathways and the pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) system,
  named Las, rhl, and pqs. The synthesis of AI’s 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL is modulated
  by Las and Rhl, which serve as their autoinducers, respectively. In addition, alkyl-4-quinolones
  (AQs), including PQS and HHQ, are signal molecules in the PQS pathway. Interconnections
  between the three pathways regulate the activity of the QS system, resulting in
  changes in cell adhesive proteins, virulence factors, biofilm formation and proteases.
  Quercetin inhibited LasI, LasR, RhlI, RhlR gene expression and baicalin inhibited
  Pqs system.'
