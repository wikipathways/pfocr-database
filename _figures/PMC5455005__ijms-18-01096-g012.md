caption: Neuroprotective mechanism of 1T3O. When cells are stimulated by 6-OHDA, a
  significant increase in ROS is observed. The transcription factor Nrf2 is activated,
  enters the nucleus, and binds to AREs to initiate transcription and induce the production
  of type-II enzymes, HO-1 and SOD, for cell protection. This is known as the endogenous
  antioxidant mechanism. 6-OHDA causes cellular apoptosis by decreasing the expression
  of phosphorylated Akt and ERK, and significantly activating p38 phosphorylation,
  resulting in caspase-3 activation. Administration of 1T3O activates the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway and causes the transcription factor Nrf2 to enter the nucleus
  and bind to AREs to induce an increase in both HO-1 expression and SOD activity
  to protect cells and counter oxidative stress. In comparison with the administration
  of 6-OHDA alone, the administration of 1T3O can better activate this signaling pathway
  to elicit its protective effects. In addition, 1T3O can inhibit the expression of
  caspase-3 via the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, and can also attenuate the activation
  of p38 to prevent subsequent activation of caspase-3 expression to achieve its antiapoptotic
  and neuroprotective effects.
