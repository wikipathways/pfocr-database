caption: Schematic representation of the inositol polyphosphate biosynthesis pathway
  in C. neoformans. Phospholipase C1 (Plc1) hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce IP3. Arg1 is
  a dual-specificity kinase converting IP3 to IP4 and IP4 to IP5. Ipk1 is the proposed
  IP5 kinase, providing IP6 as a substrate for Kcs1. Kcs1 is the major IP6 kinase
  generating PP-IP5 (IP7), and Asp1 is an IP7 kinase generating PP2-IP4 (IP8). The
  physiological roles of Kcs1-derived IP7 are indicated.
