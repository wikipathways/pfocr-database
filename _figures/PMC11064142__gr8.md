caption: A) Interaction of mir15a/16-5p cluster and mir-7641 with targeted genes involved
  in intrinsic and extrinsic signalling pathways of apoptosis. As depicted above,
  the mir-15a/16 cluster contributes to apoptosis induction by suppressing anti-apoptotic
  genes such as Bcl-2 and Mc-1. Moreover, miR-16-5p probably inhibits glioma cell
  viability and invasion through miR-16-5p/Talin-1 (TLN1) Axis. It is worth mentioning
  that miR-15a and miR-16 can induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by suppressing
  cyclin D1 (CCND1). On the other hand, miR-7641, as an oncogenic miR, promotes tumour
  cell proliferation by improving intercellular communication. B) Network construction
  of top differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and their target mRNAs
