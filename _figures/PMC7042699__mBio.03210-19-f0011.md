caption: Summary of the effects of low-dose Tmp on B. thailandensis. Several pathways
  impinge on mal; the most important of these is inhibition of DHFR by Tmp leading
  to long-range inhibition of Met biosynthesis, as a result of lowered levels of 5-Me-THF,
  and to increased levels of homoCys and homoSer. The latter induces mal via malR.
  Low-dose Tmp treatment also triggers the SOS response, leads to enhanced NTPs and
  amino acids, and downregulates scmR and mftR, resulting in modulation of numerous
  BGCs in B. thailandensis, though these do not constitute the major pathway by which
  Tmp induces mal.
