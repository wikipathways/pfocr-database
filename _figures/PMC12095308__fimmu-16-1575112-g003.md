caption: Hantavirus life cycle. The hantavirus life cycle consists of ten major steps,
  that are necessary to release new viral particles. [1] Hantaviruses bind to their
  respective receptor on the surface of the host cell with the envelope glycoproteins
  Gn/Gc. [2] Entry of the viral particles occur either via clathrin-dependent (OWHVs,
  e.g., PUUV) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (NWHVs). [3] The viral glycoproteins
  dissociate from the cellular receptors and traffic through the endocytic pathway.
  [4] Low pH of the endosomes and other cellular factors trigger a membrane-fusion
  process between viral and cellular membranes. [5] Viruses are uncoated and viral
  genome and proteins are released into the cytoplasm. [6] Viral RNA (vRNA) is transcribed
  by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and [7] mRNA is subsequently translated
  into different viral proteins, which are necessary to hijack the host cell machinery.
  [8] vRNA is synthesized and [9] new viral particles are assembled at the [9a] Golgi-complex
  (OWHVs, e.g., PUUV) or at the [9b] cell membrane (NWHVs). [10] Viral particles are
  released by fusion of the Golgi-complex (OWHVs, e.g., PUUV) or viral vesicle (NWHVs)
  with host cell membrane. E.E., early endosome; L.E., late endosome. Created with
