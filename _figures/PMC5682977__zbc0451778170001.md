caption: The Opi1p–Scs2p interaction is required for Opi1p translocation from the
  nucleus and for PA transport into the mitochondria. Gaspar et al. () propose that
  distinct pools of PA are present in the ER. One pool is associated with de novo
  synthesis of major phospholipids. A smaller pool is used for CL and DAG synthesis.
  DAG can either be acylated to TAG or used to synthesize PC via the Kennedy pathway.
  Exogenous choline competes for DAG through the Kennedy pathway and depletes the
  smaller pool of PA, which is required for Opi1p translocation from the nucleus,
  whereupon it binds to Scs2p and PA in the ER membrane. Additionally, the interaction
  of Opi1p with Scs2p is required for PA transfer to the mitochondria for CL synthesis.
