caption: Tumor-induced CD8+ Treg cells and their potential role in tumor microenvironment.
  TGF-β1 can be released by cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. The suppressive
  activity of Treg cells mainly mediated through tumor-derived exosome TGF-β1. We
  previously reported that TGF-β1 secreted by OC cells could generate CD8+ Treg cells
  by promotion of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Tumor microenvironment influences
  T-cell immune responses by altering cellular metabolism. mTORC1 regulates glucose
  metabolism in CD8+ Treg cells’ differentiation through regulating the expression
  of HIF1α. Treg cells use different strategies to inhibit target cells within the
  tumor mass. Among the surface molecules expressed by CD8+ Treg cells, CD25, CD122,
  CD28, CTLA-4 and Foxp3 have a well-demonstrated role in promoting tumor progression.
  Treg cells secrete several immune-modulatory cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10, TNF-α and
  IL-2). Tumor-induced-CD8+ Treg cells could also directly modulate activation and
  function of immune cells. CD8+ Treg cells may play a role in promoting imbalance
  of the immune system in tumor growth. These immune-tolerance mechanisms may also
  be exploited by cancer cells to achieve immune escape, which becomes more pronounced
  with tumor formation, progression and metastasis. CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
  associated protein 4; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; IL, interleukin; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex
