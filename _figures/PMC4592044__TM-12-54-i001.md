caption: The only known receptor for NO is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). The α1β1
  heterodimer is the predominant isoform of sGC that is obligatory for catalytic activity.
  NO binding at histidine 105 of β1 subunit leads to sGC activity and cGMP production
  (). The NO and 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (NO/cGMP) pathway plays a central role
  in many physiological processes such as induction of vasodilation. On the other
  hand, the effects of NO can be attributed to the cGMP-independent pathway, which
  is mediated mainly by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species such as highly reactive peroxynitrite
  (ONOO) []. The role of NO and cGMP signaling in tumor biology has been extensively
  studied during the past three decades. NO has been shown that affect GBM in great
  variety of ways []. It is almost proved the role of NO in peritumoural and tumoural
  cortex, and that the increase in NOS activity may play a role in tumour vascularization
  and progression []. Many researches showing that NO treatment results in the induction
  of apoptosis, radiosensitization and chemosensitization in tumor cells, and in increased
  permeability of the BBB [].
