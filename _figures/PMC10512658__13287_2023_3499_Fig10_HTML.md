caption: Working hypothesis for hUC-MSC-mediated therapeutic effect on PND in aged
  mice. Anesthesia and surgery initiate peripheral inflammatory responses and promote
  release of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines; these cytokines can infiltrate the
  blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activate the microglia and astrocytes to produce a
  wide range of inflammatory cytokines and negatively affect the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling
  pathway, leading to the impairment of the endogenous neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
  hUC-MSC treatment inhibits early systemic inflammatory responses to anesthesia and
  surgery and further down-regulates neuroinflammatory responses and restores neurogenesis
  and neuroplasticity dysfunction by activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway
  and modulation of its potential downstream effect on lipid metabolism. The combined
  mechanisms contribute to cognitive improvement in aged mice with PND. hUC-MSCs,
  human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; TrkB, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein. BBB, blood–brain barrier
