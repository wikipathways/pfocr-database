caption: Mechanism for the modulating effect of C22:6n-3 and uric acid on glucose
  metabolism. IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1R, insulin
  growth factor 1 receptor; Tyr, tyrosine; Ser, serine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDK1, 3-phosphatidylinositol-dependent
  kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; UA, uric acid. (1) β cell secreted insulin, and insulin
  combined with IR or IGF-1R; (2) the complex of insulin and IR lead to the Tyr-phosphorylation
  of IRS-1, and the Tyr-phosphorylated IRS-1 binds to PI3K; (3) the complex of Tyr-phosphorylated
  IRS-1 and PI3K generated PIP3, which recruited AKT, and AKT is activated by PDK1;
  (4) activated AKT increased the uptake of glucose; (5) AKT increased the synthesis
  of glycogen; (6) UA leads to the Ser-phosphorylation of IRS-1, and thus blocked
  the insulin signal pathway; (7) UA increases the secretion of insulin by β cell
  in T2DM subjects, and thus lowered blood glucose; (8) high blood glucose leads to
  osmotic diuresis, increases the clearance rate of UA, and decreases plasma UA level
  in sequence; (9) C22:6n-3 increases the expression of IRS-1, and in this way lowers
  blood glucose.
