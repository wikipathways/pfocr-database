caption: Signal transduction pathways in the regulation of RNA transcription (broken
  lines) and splicing (solid lines). Three major pathways associated with RNA splicing
  are phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) (), mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) (, , ), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (). Regulation of RNA
  splicing involves signal transduction-mediated phosphorylation of SR proteins ()
  or subcellular distribution of splicing factors (). NF-AT, nuclear factor of activated
  T cells; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein; SRF, serum response
  factor; TCF, ternary complex factor; SR, serine/arginine-rich protein.
