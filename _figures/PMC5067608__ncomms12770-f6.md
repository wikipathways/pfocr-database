caption: Proteomic evidence are indicated with green boxes, and the genomic evidence
  with white boxes. This microorganism reduces SO42− to HS− using electrons from H2
  (grey compartment), thus producing a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane.
  The intracellular proton translocation is coupled to ATP generation. ATP and electrons
  (the latter being transferred via reduced ferredoxin and NADH/NADPH) can be used
  to reduce CO2 to acetyl-CoA via the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (orange compartment).
  Biomass biosynthesis takes place through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (green compartment),
  and gluconeogenesis (blue compartment). Fatty acids and amino acids biosynthesis
  is not described in detail, but the proteins involved are listed in purple and red
  boxes, respectively. Finally, this bacterium can also use acetate and propionate
  as a source of carbon (yellow compartment). All proteins of this figure are listed
  in .
