caption: p53 directs lipid and amino acid metabolism during stress. In response to
  a shortage of lipids (orange arrows) or serine (blue arrows), p53 is activated by
  nutrient-sensing pathways including 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and eIF2α.
  For lipids, p53 acts to suppress fatty acid synthesis and promote increased fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) to maintain mitochondrial respiration. Similarly, serine withdrawal
  causes p53 to promote cell-cycle arrest, increased glutathione production, and decreased
  nucleotide synthesis to conserve remaining stores. FAs, Fatty acids, mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; GSH, glutathione;
  AA, amino acid; FASN, fatty acid synthetase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACLY,
  ATP citrate lyase; FA, TCA, tricarboxylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; lightning
  bolt, phosphorylation event; red cross, pathway inhibition.
