caption: Overview of miRNAs and genes regulation patterns in the poplar response to
  M. brunnea. The red letters are upregulated genes or miRNAs or pathways, and the
  green letters are downregulated genes or miRNAs or pathways. “ → ” represents induction
  of mentioned elements or pathway, while “⊥” stands for suppression. A dashed line
  indicates speculated pathways. SNARE, soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor
  attachment adaptor protein receptor; ABC transporter, ATP-binding cassette transporter;
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; POD, peroxidase;
  F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
