caption: Simplified schematic of isoprenoid metabolism in photosynthetic plant cells
  and its relationship to photosynthesis, glycolysis, respiration, and photorespiration.
  Although the  pathway is found in the cytosol and the  pathway is found in the chloroplast,
  some cross talk occurs between the pathways through the exchange of intermediates
  (dashed arrows). CO2 assimilated by the Calvin cycle, entering the  pathway as  and
  ending up as carbon atoms 1 through 3 of isoprene, is shown in green. Figure modified
