caption: The role of autophagy in the differentiation/function of osteoclast, osteoblast
  and osteocyte. During RANKL-RANK induced osteoclast differentiation, the protein
  levels of ATG5/7/12 are increased, accompanied with enhanced conversion from LC3-I
  to LC3-II and p62 degradation, which plays an essential role in the generation of
  F-actin ring. Besides differentiation, autophagy also plays decisive roles in osteoclast
  function, that the physiological levels of Atg5/7/4B are required for lysosomal
  [containing H+ and cathepsin K (CatK)] trafficking and fusion with the plasma membrane
  to generate mature ruffled border, as well as to release H+ and cathepsin K to resorb
  bone. During osteoblast differentiation, the binding of BMP2 to its receptors (BMPR)
  activates Smad signaling pathway to initiate osteogenesis, which also induced the
  expression of beclin 1 and LAMP2 (autophagy-related proteins) as well as autophagy
  pathway. Autophagosomes are utilized for transporting mineral crystals to extracellular
  matrix and thereby facilitating mineralization. Autophagy reduces oxidative stress
  during osteoblast differentiation via clearance of damaged mitochondria, which also
  suppresses RANKL production and hence inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Compared with
  osteoblast, the autophagy level is increased in osteocyte, which not only maintains
  homeostasis of osteocyte, but also guarantees a physiological osteocyte-derived
  regulation on bone remodeling.
