caption: (A) Summary of changes observed in the expression of numerous metabolic enzymes
  after treatment with taxol for 48 h, as measured by quantitative proteomics. Taxol
  treatment increased the expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate,
  and hexosamine biosynthesis and lipid synthesis pathways in detriment of those involved
  in gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism (TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation,
  and mitochondrial β–oxidation). Enzymes that show amplified expression after taxol
  treatment are shown in red, and enzymes that are decreased are shown in green. Cellular
  metabolic pathways that may be up-regulated are boxed in red, and those that may
  be down-regulated are boxed in green. (B) Summary of changes observed in the expression
  of numerous autophagy and senescence-related proteins after treatment with taxol
  for 48 h, as measured by quantitative proteomics. Taxol amplified the expression
  of proteins involved in senescence, autophagy, mitophagy and vesicle formation and
  trafficking. Proteins that show increased expression after treatment are shown in
  red. (C) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of azathioprine and taxol-treated hTERT-BJ1
  fibroblasts predicted p53, TFEB and CCL5 to be activated in these cells.
