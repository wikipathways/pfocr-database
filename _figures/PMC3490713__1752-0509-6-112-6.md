caption: Pathway enrichment map [] of first degree partners of targets of functional
  miRNAs predicted in Figure. A. Nodes represent significant enriched pathways, links
  indicate the gene overlap between pathways. Node size represents the pathway enrichment
  significance, the larger the node, the more significant the enrichment pathway is.
  Results revealed that the targets of miRNAs and their partners are highly associated
  with focal adhesion and path-ways in cancer.
