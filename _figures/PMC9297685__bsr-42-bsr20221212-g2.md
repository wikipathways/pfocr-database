caption: PKB/Akt phosphorylates RabGAPs (AS160/Tbc1d4, Tbc1d1) to prevent their inhibitory
  action (red type), increasing translocation of vesicles containing the glucose transporter
  GLUT4 to the membrane (blue arrow). This increases glucose uptake into the cell.
  Hexokinase II (HKII) converts glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). It is tethered
  to the mitochondrial membrane, interacting with the voltage-dependent anion channel
  (VDAC), allowing it to access ATP directly from the mitochondria, and facilitating
  direct transfer of ADP back into the mitochondria. HKII expression and activity
  is increased by PKB/Akt signalling (blue type) increasing production of G6P. Glycolysis
  (centre). G6P is converted to fructose 6-phosphate which is then converted to fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase (PFK) in the rate-limiting step of the pathway.
  Fructose 6-phosphate interconversion with fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is performed
  by the cardiac isoform of phosphofructokinase 2 (PFKB2), an enzyme with dual kinase
  (K) and phosphatase (P) activity. PKB/Akt phosphorylates and inhibits the phosphatase
  activity, resulting in accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric
  activator of PFK. This increases glycolytic flux to produce pyruvate for oxidative
  phosphorylation in the mitochondria. If oxidative phosphorylation is insufficient
  to manage additional pyruvate, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH). This causes acidification and excess lactate is exported from the cell. Pentose
  phosphate pathway (left section). G6P is converted to 6-phospho-gluconolactone by
  G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH), relying on production of G6P that is increased by PKB/Akt
  signalling. This reaction produces NADPH, required to reduce oxidised glutathione
  (GSSG) to GSH. GSH is a critical antioxidant in the cell, scavenging reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). 6-phospho-gluconolactone can be returned to the glycolytic pathway
  via further oxidative and non-oxidative reactions.
