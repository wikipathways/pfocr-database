caption: 'Eicosanoids synthesis pathways. Arachidonic acid is produced by the cell
  membrane through phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Arachidonic acid is metabolized to eicosanoids
  via three major pathways: the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome
  P450 pathways. In the COX pathway, arachidonic acid is converted to the intermediate
  prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), which is further reduced to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by
  COX. PGH2 is then metabolized to prostanoids (prostaglandins) and thromboxanes (TX)
  via prostaglandin and thromboxane (TX) synthases, respectively. In the LOX pathway,
  arachidonic acid is converted to leukotrienenes (LT) via 5-LOX and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HPETEs) via 12-LOX and15-LOX, arachidonic acid is converted to 5-HPETE, which
  is then metabolized by 5-LOX to produce the unstable leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4
  is subsequently converted to LTB4 via LTA hydrolase and LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 via
  LTC synthase. Drawing was adapted from  ().'
