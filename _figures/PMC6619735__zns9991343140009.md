caption: A proposed model illustrating the mechanism of arctigenin-mediated Aβ production
  inhibition and Aβ clearance promotion. Aβ is generated from a sequent cleavage of
  APP by BACE1 and γ-secretase. It could be degraded by autophagy. Arctigenin dephosphorylated
  PERK and eIF2α, causing the suppression of BACE1 translation and further the inhibition
  of Aβ production. Arctigenin also initiated autophagy with AMPK/Raptor signaling
  activation and AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition, resulting in enhanced Aβ clearance.
