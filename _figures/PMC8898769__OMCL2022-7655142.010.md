caption: 'TNF-α is the key factor in IDD, which leads to human NP cell apoptosis in
  two ways: (1) TNF-α triggers inflammation and causes further oxidative stress in
  mitochondria, which gives rise to disordered metabolism and NP cell apoptosis. (2)
  TNF-α induces NP cell apoptosis through the death receptor pathway. The accumulation
  of apoptotic NP cells breaks the dynamic balance between the ECM destruction and
  synthesis via a malignant positive feedback loop, resulting in IDD and eventually
  LBP. Naringin, an autophagy inducer, regulates autophagy levels by activating AMPK
  and upregulating SIRT1 expression. This increase in autophagic flux inhibits the
  inflammatory cascade and ROS induced by TNF-α and phagocytizes useless organelles
  to provide more energy for NP cells. All of these events improve mitochondrial energy
  synthesis, decrease the expression of catabolic enzymes, and attenuate apoptosis
  of cells to effectively promote the formation of ECM to delay the process of IDD.'
