caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathways for melatonin and serotonin in plants and
  animals. AADC: aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; ASMT: acetylserotonin methyltransferase;
  COMT: caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase; HIOMT: hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase;
  T-5-H: Tryptamine-5-hydroxylase; TDC: tryptophan decarboxylase; TPH: tryptophan
  hydroxylase; SNAT: serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Green arrows indicate an established
  biosynthetic pathway in plants, red arrows an established biosynthetic pathway in
  animals, black a step shared by both the animal and plant established pathways and
  blue arrows indicate a newly proposed alternate step in the biosynthetic pathway.'
