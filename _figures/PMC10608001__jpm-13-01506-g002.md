caption: Physiology of contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Muscle
  contraction occurs in response to the activation of receptors present in the membrane,
  such as the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (a1R), the vasopressin-1 receptor (V1R)
  and the angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R); their activation by the selective agonist
  promotes the phosphorylation of the Gq protein and with that, the signaling pathway
  starts. With this, there is the release of calcium by the endoplasmic reticulum
  through phosphatidylinositol-3 (IP3); the calcium released in the cytosol binds
  with calmodulin (CaM), forming the calcium-calmodulin complex that phosphorylates
  myosin and promotes contraction. On the other hand, the nitric oxide (NO) produced
  by the endothelium reaches the smooth muscle, converting GTP into cGMP. cGMP dephosphorylates
  myosin and promotes relaxation. In addition, NO activates ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels (KATP), leading to hyperpolarization and inhibition of vasoconstriction.
