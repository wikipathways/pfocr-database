caption: Schematic Diagram of Matrix Protein Import into Peroxisomes.Cytosolic PEX5
  and PEX7 recognize their cargo proteins (square and round shapes) via binding of
  specific targeting sequences, PTS1 and PTS2, respectively. Cargo-loaded PEX5 associates
  with the membrane via interactions with PEX13 and PEX14 and probably also via interactions
  with the lipid phase. PEX7 cannot dock to the membrane on its own and depends on
  physical interaction with PEX5 for docking. PTS1- and PTS2-bound cargo is released
  to the matrix, and the receptors are recycled back into the cytosol via a mechanism
  that probably requires ATP-dependent ubiquitination of PEX5 (represented by a star)
  by PEX4 and the RING complex comprised of PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12. The ubiquitinated
  PEX5 is then removed from the membrane via the action of the AAA ATPases PEX6 and
  PEX1, which are tethered by APEM9. The route that PEX7 takes through the pathway,
  in particular whether it accompanies PEX5 throughout the import cycle, is unknown.
