caption: Schematic diagram for a proposed molecular mechanism of CFH regulation in
  lung cancers. STATs are phosphorylated by JAKs and other tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylated
  STATs translocate to the nucleus and drive transcription of target genes. Activated
  STATs are negatively regulated by SOCS family proteins, phosphatases, and PIAS proteins.
  The current study demonstrated that constitutively phosphorylated STAT4 directly
  binds to the CFH promoter and drives the transcription of CFH. However, for some
  reason, such as epigenetic modification excluding promoter methylation, the expression
  of SOCS was low in lung cancer, resulting in no negative feedback of the JAK/STAT
  pathway, causing the overexpression of CFH. The promoter regions of the SOCS family
  were unmethylated in both normal and lung cancer cells, indicating that methylation
  is not involved in differential regulation of SOCS family expression in lung cancer.
  Instead, the methylation status was significantly different in the regulatory region
  of STAT4; as a result, CFH is overexpressed. Consequently, CFH overexpression is
  due to the regulatory imbalance in the JAK–STAT–SOCS signaling pathway. In particular,
  the action of constitutively phosphorylated STAT4 and silenced SOCS family plays
  an important role in lung cancer.
