caption: A model for Okazaki fragment maturation in B. subtilis. (A) In wild-type
  cells, DNA Pol I and RNase HIII serve as the primary pathway. YpcP may help facilitate
  primer removal, and RNase HII may provide a less-efficient backup for RNase HIII
  activity. (B) In the absence of YpcP, the pathway remains the same. However, when
  DNA Pol I is absent, YpcP can excise the RNA primer possibly with help from the
  RNase H enzymes. After removal, the remaining gap would need to be filled by another
  DNA polymerase, likely DnaE, because it has an established role in lagging strand
  synthesis (). The squiggly line denotes the position of RNA.
