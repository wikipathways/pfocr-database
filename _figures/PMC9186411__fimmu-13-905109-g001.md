caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway and its regulation. (1) cGAS is activated
  upon binding to dsDNA to synthesize cGAMP from ATP and GTP. Some cGAMP is lost to
  intercellular spread via gap junctions or degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDE),
  but the remainder can bind to STING. (2) cGAMP-bound STING trafficks from the ER
  to the Golgi apparatus through COPII and becomes activated en route. (3) Activated
  STING recruits TBK1 and IKK to upregulate transcription of Type I interferons and
  NF-κB. (4) STING signaling is terminated when it is either degraded in the autolysosome
  or recycled back to the ER via COPI. (Inset) Extracellular cGAMP can trigger STING
  activation after import by the SLC19A1 transporter or by direct binding to pm-STING.
  Numbers also refer to stages described in text. pm, plasma membrane; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum. Created with BioRender.com.
