caption: 'Model of mitochondrial and lysosomal network regulation via coupled Mid51/Fis1
  oligomerization complex. (A) Model—Normal: (1 and 2) Mid51 and Fis1 undergo coupled
  oligomerization in a Mid51/Fis1 complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane; (3
  and 4) Mid51 oligomers promote Drp1 oligomerization and subsequent Drp1 GTP hydrolysis
  via Mff (red arrow), while Fis1 oligomers promote TBC1D15 (Rab7-GAP) recruitment
  to mitochondria to drive Rab7 GTP hydrolysis at mitochondria–lysosome tethers (green
  arrow). Inhibiting either Mid51/Fis1 oligomerization (Fis1(LA)), Rab7 GTP hydrolysis
  (TBC1D15(D397A)), or Drp1 GTP hydrolysis (Drp1(K38A); Mid51) disrupts this pathway
  (grey arrows). See Discussion for details. (B) Rab7 GTP hydrolysis promotes mitochondria–lysosome
  and inter-lysosomal contact untethering, while Drp1 GTP hydrolysis promotes mitochondrial
  fission and inter-mitochondrial untethering, resulting in untethering events which
  help redistribute both mitochondrial and lysosomal networks. (C) Model—Mid51 mutants);
  left: Mid51(Y240N) Drp1-binding domain mutant which is linked to dominant optic
  atrophy disrupts Drp1 recruitment but not Mid51 oligomerization, leading to the
  selective inhibition of Drp1 GTP hydrolysis; right: Mid51(R169W) oligomerization
  domain mutant which is potentially linked to Parkinson’s disease disrupts Mid51
  oligomerization but not Drp1 recruitment, leading to uncoupled and defective Fis1
  oligomerization and the selective inhibition of Rab7 GTP hydrolysis, resulting in
  the misregulation of lysosomal tethering dynamics.'
