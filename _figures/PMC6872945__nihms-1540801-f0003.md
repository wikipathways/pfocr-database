caption: Overlay of BMAL1 target genes (indicated in red) on diverse metabolic pathways
  in the liver. BMAL1 occupancy data are from a previously published ChIP-seq dataset
  (). The original metabolic pathway is from a KEGG analysis (used with permission)
  and has been simplified to show major nodes (, ). In KEGG, nodes indicate enzymes
  and lines indicate connections in metabolic pathways, with colors indicating pathways
  serving similar functions. The red dots and lines indicate BMAL1 interactions with
  genes involved in these pathways.
