caption: IDO1-Kynurenine-AhR signaling in TME immunosuppression. A, IDO1 in tumor
  cells, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts. TDO in hepatocytes are the rate-limiting
  enzymes in the conversion of tryptophan to Kynurenine and Kynurenine derivatives.
  Kynurenine binds to and activates the AhR, a ligand-activated transcription factor,
  in regulatory T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. B, Activation and nuclear translocation
  of the AhR () in dendritic cells induces synthesis and release of IL-10 and inhibits
  IFNβ signaling, () in NK cells induces synthesis and release of IL-10 and IFNγ,
  and () in Tregs promotes Treg development. C, Tregs and IL-10 promote immunosuppression
  within the TME, whereas inhibition of IFNβ by AhR releases regulation of immunosuppression
  from inhibitory IFNβ signaling. In addition, both IL-10 and IFNγ promote IDO1 activity,
  establishing a positive feedback loop for IDO1-Kynurenine-AhR signaling.
