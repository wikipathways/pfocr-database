caption: Boxed items are treatments currently approved to lower LDL cholesterol. (1)
  Statin treatment targets HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway,
  lowering cellular cholesterol and activating SREBP-2. (2) SREBP-2 is also inhibited
  by an E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6, and transcriptionally induces LDLR expression,
  which increases LDL uptake. (3) LDLR is bound by extracellular PCSK9, leading to
  its lysosomal degradation. Anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies including evolocumab
  and alirocumab are approved to block the PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation to maintain
  LDL uptake. (4) The sterol sensor LXR transcriptionally induces IDOL which, (5)
  with its cognate E2 ubiquitin ligase UBE2D, ubiquitylates LDLR for lysosomal degradation.
  (6) LDLR’s subsequent deubiquitylation by USP8 is necessary to sort it into the
  lysosomal degradation pathway. (7) Inhibition of DUB activity has been shown to
  induce IDOL expression via an unknown transcription factor binding site (TFBS).
  (8) MARCH6 also inhibits HMGCR, lowering cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates
  that would activate LXR and IDOL transcription. The coloured proteins depict the
  new pathway described in this issue by Nelson and Sorrentino et al. (9) USP2’s DUB
  activity decreases the ubiquitylation of both IDOL and LDLR, protecting the former
  from proteasomal degradation and the latter from lysosomal degradation. USP2 activity
  therefore maintains membrane expression of LDLR and LDL uptake.
