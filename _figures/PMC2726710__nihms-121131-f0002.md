caption: Intracellular signaling consequences of calpain-mediated substrate cleavage.
  Examination of the effects of calpain cleavage on its numerous substrates can be
  categorized by subcellular localization or protein class. Here, calpain substrates
  are divided into receptor, cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear, structural, and myelin
  proteins (see key). Intracellular calcium concentration is tightly regulated by
  membrane and endoplasmic reticulum associated receptors. Calpain propagates its
  own activation by blocking the calcium purging actions of PMCA and NCX, increasing
  calcium influx via l-type calcium channel cleavage and causing ER release of calcium
  via cleavage of SERCA, RyR, and IP3R. Cleavage of mGluR1α and the NMDAR NR2A subunit
  the C-termini uncouples both receptors from prosurvival CREB activation and potentiates
  increased calcium levels via increased PLC activity. Cleavage of calcium-regulated
  proteins such as PKC and CamKIIα also increase their activity to potentially hyperphosphorylate
  and cause aggregation of α-synuclein and tau. CaN A cleavage increases its activity
  causing dephosphorylation and translocation of transcription factors NFAT and FKHR
  leading to increased Bim and FasL levels. Cleavage of p35 to p25 alters Cdk5 activity,
  which is also involved with hyperphosphorylation of α-synuclein and tau, and also
  translocates to the nucleus and turns off prosurvival gene expression via MEF2D
  and increases ROS by inhibition of Prx2. The substrate β-catenin may also be involved
  with calpain induced cell death as cleavage mediates gene transcription. Finally,
  in the cytosol, calpain cleavage products from proteins such as mhtt, CRMP, PrPSc,
  and potentially tau translocate to the nucleus and are neurotoxic. Calpain also
  has substrates involved with mitochondria-associated programmed cell death. Calpain
  directly cleaves most of the caspases, Bax and Bcl-xL, and AIF, and it indirectly
  activates Bad via increased CaN A activation to initiate programmed neuronal death.
  However, calpain can also inactivate this pathway by cleaving Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  in a model-dependent manner. Calpain is also active in the nucleus where it cleaves
  CamKIV and PARP, the transcription factors Sp3, Sp4, and the immediate early genes
  c-Jun and c-Fos. The effect of CamKIV and PARP cleavage has not been delineated.
  Sp3, Sp4, c-Fos, and c-Jun cleavage is thought to decrease housekeeping gene transcription
  leading to cell death; however, c-Jun-mediated transcription has also bee implicated
  in cell death. Lastly, structural proteins such as α-spectrin, MAP-1/2, and α- and
  β-tubulin are calpain substrates. Cleavage of these proteins is thought to impair
  microtubule transport and cell body and synaptic neuronal structures, potentially
  leading to neuronal death. α-Syn α-Synuclein, AIF apoptosis-inducing factor, AMPAR
