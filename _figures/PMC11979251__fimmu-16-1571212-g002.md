caption: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by epigenetic modifiers of DNA methyltransferase,
  histone deacetylase and proteasome inhibitors. DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylase,
  and proteasome inhibitors can enhance immune responses and ultimately regulate ICD.
  The histone deacetylase HDAC3 and the demethylating agent decitabine can promote
  interferon-I signaling and increase CXCL10 expression, which further induce ICD.
  HFY-4A can promote the transcription of TUSC2 by facilitating the acetylation of
  histone H3K56 on the TUSC2 promoter. The expression of ANXA1 is inhibited by methylation,
  and DNMTi can restore the expression and secretion of ANXA1 during ICD. Bortezomib
  and carfilzomib can induce the expression of CRT through the endoplasmic reticulum
  stress pathway IRE1-XBP1
