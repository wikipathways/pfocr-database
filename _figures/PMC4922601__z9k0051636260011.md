caption: 'Spatial circuitry models in dark- and light-adapted conditions. A: in dark-adapted
  conditions, OFF bipolar cells receive wide spatial inhibition from wide-field GABAergic
  amacrine cells. Coupling between both AII and other glycinergic amacrine cells likely
  contribute to increasing the wide spatial spread of glycinergic signals to OFF bipolar
  cells. B: in light-adapted conditions, OFF bipolar cells receive spatially narrow
  glycinergic input, likely due to uncoupling of AII and other glycinergic amacrine
  cells. Light stimuli distant from the bipolar cell likely active serial inhibitory
  connections between GABAergic amacrine cells, which would shorten spatial GABAergic
  signals to OFF bipolar cells. C: functional schematic of changing bipolar cell center-surround
  sizes. In dark-adapted conditions, OFF bipolar cells receive wide and strong inhibition,
  so their inhibitory surrounds are large. If 2 small spots of light are presented
  to the retina, spot A stimulates excitatory output from the center of one OFF bipolar
  cell, whereas spot B stimulates surround inhibitory connections to that same cell.
  Overall output is reduced in this instance due to the addition of inhibitory input.
  In light-adapted conditions, OFF bipolar cells receive narrow and weaker inhibition,
  so their inhibitory surrounds are small. In these conditions, spot B does not stimulate
  the inhibitory surround, and there is no reduction in excitatory bipolar cell output
  from spot A. Thus the strength of the bipolar cell output in the light-adapted case
  is stronger.'
