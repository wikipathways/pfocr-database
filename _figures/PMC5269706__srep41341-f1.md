caption: '(A) MG1655 Δtig ΔdnaKJ mutant containing plasmid pSE380NcoI vector (−),
  pSE-AckA, pSE-LdhA, pSE-Lpd, pSE-PykF, pSE-TalB, pSE-csrB or pSE-csrC were grown
  at 22 °C, serially diluted 10-fold, and spotted on LB ampicillin agar plates with
  (25 or 100 μM) or without IPTG inducer. Plates were incubated for 1 day at 34 °C
  or 2 days at 22 °C. (B) Schematic representation of previously identified in vivo
  DnaK interactors by Calloni and coworkers (2012) within the central metabolic network.
  Interactors of DnaK are depicted in blue and newly identified suppressors from (A)
  are highlighted with a dark blue frame. Proteins significantly increased in the
  ΔdnaK mutant are underlined in green and those significantly decreased in red. Heat-shock
  proteins are marked with an asterisk. Metabolic network includes the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  (EMP) pathway, the Pentose Phosphate (PP) pathway, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway
  and the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle (TCA cycle). Abbreviations: glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), 6- phosphogluconate (6PG), ribose-5-phosphate
  (R5P), 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phospho-gluconate (KDPG), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP),
  2-phospho-D-glycerate (2-PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate (PYR), acetyl-CoA
  (AcCoA), acetyl-phosphate (AcP), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), succinate (Suc), malate
  (Mal) and oxaloacetate (OXA). (C) Transformants of MG1655 PTetONdnaKJ containing
  plasmid pSE380NcoI vector, pSE-AckA, pSE-LdhA, pSE-Lpd, pSE-PykF, pSE-TalB, pSE-csrB
  or pSE-csrC were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C in LB supplemented with ampicillin
  and anhydrotetracycline to ensure expression of DnaKJ, serially diluted 10-fold,
  and spotted on LB ampicillin agar plates with or without IPTG. Note that the anhydrotetracycline
  inducer was not present in the plates to ensure the repression of the dnaKJ operon.
  Plates were incubated for 1 day at 30 °C or at 39 °C.'
