caption: 'Apoptosis signaling and cell death relevant drugs. Cell death based cancer
  therapy can be approached by targeting proteins in the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway.

  IAP: Inhibitors of apoptosis; tBID: Truncated BID; FADD: Fas-associated protein
  with death domain; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL: Tumor necrosis factor related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
