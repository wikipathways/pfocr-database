caption: Summary of mitochondrial-damage-induced VC. In total, mitochondria could
  affect VC in three main ways. Direct damage to mtDNA caused by various of factors
  could damage the structure and function of ETC, such as mtDNA inherited defects
  or POLG-related Pol γ defects and high-phosphate environment VC such as the high-phosphate
  environment or due to POLG mutations and eventually lead to VC. Second, mitochondria
  could also directly participate in the process of VC by oxidative stress injury.
  ROS is a core factor for VSMCs calcification caused by activating related signaling
  pathway or breaking the balance of mitochondrial fusion–fission. Finally, mitochondria
  could indirectly regulate VC process through some biological behavior, such as autophagy/mitophagy
  and apoptosis; these behaviors could regulate the release of EVs or MVs and further
  participate in the development of VC. ETC, electron transport chain; mtDNA, mitochondrial
  DNA; Pol γ, DNA polymerase gamma; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1; EV, extracellular
  vesicle; MV, matrix vesicle; Pi, inorganic phosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  ADP, adenosine diphosphate; NF-ϰB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase-B; Runx2, Runt-related transcription factor 2; VSMC,
