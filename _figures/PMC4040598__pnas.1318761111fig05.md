caption: Model depicting effect of ADAM17 variant on the canonical TGFβ signaling
  pathway. TGFβ ligand induces heteroligomerization of TβRII and TβRI, activation
  of TβRI by TβRII, and phosphorylation of Smad2 by TβRI kinase. P-Smad2 oligomerizes
  with Smad4 to shuttle to the nucleus and instigate a Smad-mediated transcriptional
  response. The model proposes differential shedding and consequent inactivation of
  TβRI by the NIH versus C57 variants of ADAM17. The C57 ADAM17 isoform has relatively
  weak inhibitory activity against TβRI, consequently elevating nuclear P-Smad2/3
  and Smad2/3-mediated transcription in cells harboring this variant.
