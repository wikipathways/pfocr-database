caption: A Model Explaining the Hyperrecombinogenic Phenotype of AtCEN2-Deficient
  Plants.In response to UV irradiation, cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers, (6-4)-photoproducts
  (blue trapezium) are formed. In addition, DNA DSBs are introduced. Different repair
  processes are activated. In AtCEN2 wild-type plants, DNA photolyase contributes
  efficiently to the direct repair of UV damage, whereas NER contributes to the dark
  repair of this damage. For the recognition step of the UV lesion, a complex consisting
  of RAD4-RAD23 (blue hexagon-green triangle, respectively) is stabilized by CEN2.
  DNA DSBs can be formed as the result of an extra nick in a single stranded region
  because of mechanical stress of a chromosome. These DSBs are mainly repaired by
  the NHEJ (bold), and recombinational DNA repair (HR) remains a minor pathway (lower
  case). In the Atcen2-deficient plants, the lower mRNA steady state level of photolyase
  (lower case) could contribute to a lower efficiency of direct repair of UV damage.
  In addition, the lack of CEN2 as well as the reduced amount of RAD4 may reduce the
  stability/efficiency of the recognition complex involved in the first step of the
  NER pathway. Therefore, the reduced efficiency of the two major UV repair pathways
  may lead to the accumulation of DSBs. Repair of these is taken over by HR (bold).
  Concomitantly, the DSB repair process could be activated by the ATM signaling pathway.
  MIM may also contribute to remodel chromatin during the HR process.
