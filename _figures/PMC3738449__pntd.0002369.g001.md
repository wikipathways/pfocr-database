caption: (A) Structure of a T. cruzi GPI anchor, according to Previato et al. . (B)
  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of GPI anchor in the endoplasmic reticulum of T. cruzi.
  N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is added to phosphatidylinositol (PI) in step 1 and,
  during the following steps, deacetylation and addition of four mannose residues
  occur. The addition of ethanolamine-phosphate on the third mannose (step 7) enables
  the transferring of the completed GPI anchor to the C-terminal of a protein (step
  8). Dolichol-P-mannose acts as a mannose donor for all mannosylation reactions that
  are part of the GPI biosynthesis. This pathway was based on the structure of the
  T. cruzi GPI and sequence homology of T. cruzi genes with genes known to encode
  components of this pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Trypanosoma
  brucei and Plasmodium falciparum. Not shown in the figure, free glycoinositolphospholipids
  (GIPLs), also present in the T. cruzi membrane, are likely to be by-products of
  the same GPI biosynthetic pathway.
