caption: Impact of HIF-1α on autophagy in mammalian cells. Macro-autophagy is controlled
  by the energy sensor AMPK, induced by HIF-1α. AMPK promotes ULK1 activity while
  blocking mTOR, inhibitor of ULK1. ULK1 triggers the start of the macroautophagic
  pathway, facilitating the recruitment of several ATG proteins, Beclin-1 and LC3-II,
  necessary for the formation of the double membrane, termed phagophore, where the
  cytoplasmic components targeted for degradation are attached through anchor proteins
  such as p62. HIF-1α promotes this process by increasing LC3-I lipidation to form
  LC3-II and inducing the expression of BNIP3 and NIX, which separate Beclin-1 from
  its inhibitor Bcl-2. Macro-autophagy progresses as the autophagic cargo is enclosed
  in a double membrane organelle called autophagosome, which fuses with the lysosome,
  forming the autophagolysosome. The lysosomal enzymes are responsible for degrading
  the substrates. HIF-1α has not been linked to Chaperone-mediated autophagy, which
  starts with the unfolding of a damaged proteins by chaperones. The unfolded substrate
  is detected by the lysosomal LAMP2 receptor, which translocates this substrate to
  the lysosome for its degradation.
