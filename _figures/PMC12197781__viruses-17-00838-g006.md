caption: Effect of Ad14 miRNAs on the NF-κB signaling pathway. IPA was used to predict
  the effects of Ad14 miRNAs on proteins involved in activating NF-κB-dependent transcription.
  Lines ending with an arrowhead show the direction of activation, while lines ending
  with a dash show the direction of inhibition. Solid blue lines indicate validated
  repressive effects of miRNA–target interactions, while dashed blue lines are for
  predicted repressive effects of miRNA–target interactions. Red crescents are miRNAs,
  and the remaining shapes are proteins in the NF-κB pathway. Dark blue shapes are
  direct targets of the Ad14 miRNAs, while light blue shapes are predicted to have
  decreased activation based on repression of an upstream activator
