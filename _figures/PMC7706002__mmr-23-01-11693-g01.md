caption: DEGs PPI network complex. (A) PPI network of DEGs was generated using the
  Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database. The gradual
  node color represented the fold change (HKFs vs. HDFs) of DEGs in GSE44270 dataset.
  The redder the color of the node, the greater the fold change of the gene. Conversely,
  the greener the color of the node, the smaller the fold change of the gene. The
  gradient color line represented the degree of connection between each node (the
  green line represented the closest connection, the red line represented the most
  distant connection) The gradual node volume represented the P-value of each node,
  and the larger the P-value, the larger the volume of the node. (B) The hub genes
  (network-centric genes; including PRKG1, FGF2, Runx2, IL6, HAS2, BGN, CDK2, VEGFA,
  CFH, THBS1, CXCL8, EGR1, SNAI1, FOS, EDN1, MMP2, POSTN, DCN, and COL1A1) from the
  PPI network were identified and visualized using the plug-in MCODE in Cytoscape.
  The different colors represented different degree value and the redder the color,
  the greater the degree value of the node. DEGs, differentially expressed genes;
  PPI, protein-protein interaction; HKFs, primary human keloid fibroblasts; HDFs,
  human dermal fibroblasts; PRKG1, protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1; FGF2, fibroblast
  growth factor 2; Runx2, RUNX family transcription factor 2; IL6, interleukin 6;
  HAS2, hyaluronan synthase 2; BGN, biglycan; CDK2, cyclin dependent kinase 2; VEGFA,
  vascular endothelial growth factor A; CFH, complement factor H; THBS1, thrombospondin
  1; CXCL8, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8; EGR1, early growth response 1; SNAI1,
  snail family transcriptional repressor 1; FOS, Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription
  factor subuni; EDN1, endothelin 1; MMP2, matrix metallopeptidase 2; POSTN, periostin;
  DCN, decorin; COL1A1, collagen type I α 1 chain.
