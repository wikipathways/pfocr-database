caption: Activation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Liver tissue cell is infected
  with hepatitis B virus(HBV) or hepatitis B virus(HCV), the viruses promote liver
  tissue cell to secretion of IL-6, IL-6 binds to the cellular surface receptor, thereby
  phosphorylating the JAK protein and phosphorylating the STAT3 monomer to form a
  STAT3 dimer. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers are transported to the nucleus, promoting
  the transcription of targeted genes. The activated STAT3 complex is transferred
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription of STAT3 targeted genes
  (including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, VEGF, Src, CXCR4, MMP2/9, etc.) and thus participate in
  cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis etc. PIAS, SOCS, and
  PTP are negative regulators of IL-6/STAT 3 by inhibiting the activation of JAK or
  STAT3 phosphorylation itself.
