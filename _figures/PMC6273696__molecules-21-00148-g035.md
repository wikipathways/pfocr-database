caption: UPR signaling pathway was regulated by vancomycin in HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells
  were treated with 50 μg/mL vancomycin for 24 h and the protein samples were subject
  to quantitative proteomic analysis. Green indicates a down-regulation. The intensity
  of green color indicates the degree of down-regulation. Solid arrow indicates direct
  interaction.
