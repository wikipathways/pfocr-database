caption: 'The “two-hit” hypothesis of PCOS. The “two-hit” hypothesis of polycystic
  ovary syndrome (PCOS) suggests that two insults are required for the syndrome''s
  full phenotypic expression. For the first “hit,” one or more of a number of different
  mechanisms, including: (1) Primary adrenal, ovarian, and/or neuroendocrine abnormalities;
  (2) insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia; and/or (3) prenatal, immediate postnatal,
  and/or peripubertal androgen exposure, lead to increased androgen production. For
  the second “hit,” the preexisting hyperandrogenism reduces the sensitivity of the
  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator to progesterone-mediated slowing
  during pubertal maturation, thereby initiating a series of changes in the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian
  (HPO) axis that result in ovulatory dysfunction and sustained hyperandrogenism.
  Thus, a cycle is established whereby the presence of hyperandrogenism, the final
  common pathway for the development of PCOS, begets more hyperandrogenism. E2, Estradiol;
  LH, luteinizing hormone; FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; E2, estradiol. (Figure
