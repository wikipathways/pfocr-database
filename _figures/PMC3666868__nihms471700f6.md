caption: Hypothesized reaction mechanism for SPL (The residues are numbered according
  to the protein sequence in Bs SPL). This mechanism implies that SPL uses a minimum
  of four H atom transfer processes (labeled in blue numbers) in each catalytic cycle.
  One of the four processes occurs between a tyrosine and a cysteine, suggesting that
  SPL uses a novel HAT pathway for SAM regeneration. The role of Y97(Bs) in SPL catalysis
  needs further elucidation and is thus not shown here.
