caption: Schematic overview of M1 protein-induced IL-8 expression in human keratinocytes.
  The binding of M1 protein to TLR2 on keratinocytes induces activation of intracellular
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88). MyD88 is then responsible
  for transmitting the inflammatory signal by recruiting interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK1) and IRAK4 together with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
  This complex activates transforming growth factor β-activated kinase (TAK) and TAK-binding
  protein (TAB), both of which can activate the MAPK signaling cascade and the NF-κB
  pathway. At the end of this chain of events, the localization and promoter binding
  of AP-1 and NF-κB trigger the transcription of IL-8 inside the nucleus and its subsequent
  secretion. IKK, IκB kinase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase;
  MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.
