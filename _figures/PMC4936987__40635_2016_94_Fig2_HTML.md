caption: Pathway diagram of the glycolysis pathway. Statistically significant genes
  (p < 0.01) (between critically ill and healthy controls) are coloured in either
  red or green. Red colour denotes up-regulation, and green colour denotes down-regulation.
  Lines with one-direction arrow (i.e. irreversible reaction) represent key regulatory
  control steps of the pathway. Lines with arrows on both directions denote reversible
  reactions determined by mass effect (i.e. forward and backward reaction can occur
  depending on substrate concentration)
