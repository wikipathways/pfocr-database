caption: Relationship between GPxs and the NF-κB pathway in the antiproliferation
  action of butyrate. In response to proatherogenic stimuli, ROS, including hydroperoxides
  and lipid peroxides, are produced, which activate the redox-sensitive NF-κB signal
  cascade leading to the expression of target genes. Treatment of VSMC with butyrate
  causes a strong antioxidant effect by upregulating GPxs along with an increase in
  the cellular GSH level and upregulation of several isoforms of GSTs (not shown in
  the scheme), which reduces ROS [] and blocks the NF-κB cascade early in the pathway.
  Besides, butyrate appears to inhibit the activation of the NF-κB cascade mainly
  by inhibiting the synthesis of its core components, which coincides with the inhibition
  of the activation of the NF-κB cascade. This results in the inhibition of NF-κB
  target gene expression, causing an anti-inflammatory response. Thus, there is a
  link between the antioxidant effect and anti-inflammatory response in butyrate-arrested
  VSMC proliferation, a crucial factor in atherogenesis.
