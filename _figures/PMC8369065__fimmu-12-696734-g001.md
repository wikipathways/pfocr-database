caption: 'The immune mechanisms of BCG and helminths protect against allergic asthma
  (A) The protective effect of neonatal BCG is mediated through two pathways: the
  first pathway (left) is induction of Th1 cells polarization by IL-12 secreting macrophages,
  the resultant IFN-γ inhibits Th2 response with subsequent suppression of asthma.
  Another pathway (right) is the upregulation of Tregs polarization through interaction
  with TLR2, TLR4 and PD-1 expressed on DCs, the resultant IL-10 and TGF-β reduce
  TH2 response and suppress asthma. (B) The protective effect of chronic helminth
  infection is mediated through 2 pathways: the first pathway (left) is the induction
  of T and Bregs differentiation by IL-10 secreting antigen presenting cells (APCs).
  Then, Th2 response is inhabited by IL-10 and TGF-β or the direct contact between
  Tregs and Th2 cells, which leads to suppressing asthma. The second pathway (right)
  is the saturation hypothesis in which helminth infections induce polyclonal IgE
  (blue) that binds to and saturate high affinity FcϵR on mast cells, preventing binding
  of allergen-specific IgE (red) and subsequent blocking of mast cell degranulation.'
