caption: FA/BRCA pathway and crosstalk between FA and other DNA repair pathways. In
  response to upstream DNA damage signaling (such as phosphorylation by ATR/ATM),
  in the FA/BRCA pathway [], the FA core complex forms––comprising FANCA (A), FANCB
  (B), FANCC (C), FANCE (E), FANCF (F), FANCG (G), FANCM (M), and FANCL (L) proteins,
  plus FAAP20, FAAP24, and FAAP100 (FAAP). This core complex binds UBE2T(T) via FANCL,
  which then activates FANCD2/I dimers through mono-ubiquitination. The activated
  FANCD2/I (D2/I) complex then translocates to DNA - damage sites and recruits downstream
  FA effector proteins––including BRCA1 (S), BRCA2 (D1), RAD51 (R), BRIP1 (J), PALB2
  (N), RAD51C (O), SLX4 (P), and ERCC4 (Q), plus other DNA repair molecules (such
  as FAN1) to the lesion site to repair damage. In the FANCM/BS pathway [], the FA
  core complex binds to the BS complex by way of interactions between FANCM-RMI1 and
  TopoIIIα of the BS complex and translocates to the lesion site. In the FANCD2/ATM
  pathway [], in response to ionizing radiation or ICL-inducing agents, FANCD2 is
  phosphorylated by ATM and co-localizes with the NMR complex to repair DNA damage
  or cause S-phase arrest. ICL interstrand cross-links, ATR ataxia-telangiectasia-Ser/Thr-protein
