caption: 'Intervention to reduce ROS for the prevention of CIN: evidence from in vitro,
  in vivo and clinical studies. In response to the mechanisms involved in ROS production
  in CIN, interventions to reduce ROS via complex pathways are illustrated. The MAPK
  pathway was inhibited by statins, GKT137831 and probucol. The SIRT1 pathway was
  inhibited by resveratrol. Rho/ROCK pathway was inhibited by fasudil. The Nrf-2/HO-1
  pathway was inhibited by sulforaphane and salvianolic acid B. Antioxidant agents
  reported to exert benefits in CIN prevention have also been shown in this figure.
