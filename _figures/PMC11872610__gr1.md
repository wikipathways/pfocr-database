caption: Schematic illustration of design and preparation of Qu-CDs for the treatment
  of burn wound healing. (a) Qu-CDs can accelerate the transition of wounds to the
  repair phase by modulating immune responses, and reinforce wound re-epithelialization
  by actively inducing the EMT phenotype via the smad1/5 signaling pathway, ultimately
  facilitating the reconstruction of the normal epidermal barrier and achieving rapid
  wound closure. (b) Typical TEM images of Qu-CDs
