caption: 'Since excess hepcidin leads to ACD, blocking the signaling pathways responsible
  for hepcidin synthesis, neutralizing hepcidin''s effect on ferroportin or promoting
  ferroportin function may ameliorate ACD (red lines).Hepcidin production can be effectively
  inhibited by the following BMP6-HJV-SMAD inhibitors: soluble HJV.Fc protein (Ferrumax
  Pharmaceuticals), monoclonal anti-BMP6 antibodies, or the glycosaminoglycan heparin
  sequester BMP6, preventing its interaction with BMPR and membrane anchored HJV;
  the dorsomophin derivative LDN-193189 inhibits BMP type I receptor activity. Alcohol
  may also inhibit hepcidin synthesis by dampening the BMP-SMAD pathway.Anti-inflammatory
  therapeutics suppress IL-6 mediated hepcidin gene expression by: blocking antibody
  to IL-6 Siltuximab (Janssen Biotech Inc); neutralizing antibody to IL-6 receptor
  Tocilizumab (Genentech); or STAT3 pathway inhibitors, which block the phosphorylation
  of STAT3 (AG490) or its transcription factor binding activity (PpYLKTK).Vitamin
  D can also downregulate hepcidin transcription but the mechamism is unknown.Hepcidin
  protein expression or activity may be inhibited directly by: hepcidin siRNA [];
  hepcidin anti-sense oligonucleotides (Xenon Pharmaceuticals and ISIS Pharmaceuticals);
  or direct hepcidin antagonists, including anti-hepcidin antibodies (Amgen, Eli Lilly),
  hepcidin sequestering anticalins (Pieris AG) or hepcidin binding spiegelmers (NOXXON
  Pharma).Ferroportin agonists/ stabilizers, which modify the ferroportin-hepcidin
  interaction or increase ferroportin''s resistance to hepcidin (Eli-Lilly), may theoretically
  ameliorate anemia by maintaining ferroportin activity and allowing iron influx.'
