caption: Many vegetables including spinach, lettuce and beetroot are extremely rich
  in inorganic nitrate. Ingested nitrate from dietary sources is rapidly absorbed
  in the small intestine and in the circulation it mixes with endogenous nitrate from
  the NO pathway. While much of the circulating nitrate is eventually excreted in
  urine, up to 25% is actively extracted by the salivary glands and concentrated in
  saliva. In the mouth commensal anaerobic bacteria effectively reduce nitrate to
  nitrite by the action of nitrate reductase enzymes. Until recently this entero-salivary
  circulation of nitrate and bacterial reduction to nitrite has received attention
  only because of nitrites ability to form potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines.
  However, the link between dietary nitrate and gastric cancer is still very uncertain
  despite more than 40 years of active research. More recently it was shown that in
  the acidic stomach nitrite is spontaneously decomposed to form nitric oxide and
  other bioactive nitrogen oxides which serve to regulate important physiological
  functions. Gastric NO helps to kill ingested pathogens and also protects the gastric
  mucosa against luminal aggressors via stimulation of mucosal blood flow and mucus
  generation. Moreover, much nitrite is also absorbed intact into the ciculation and
  can convert back to bioactive NO in blood and tissues. This enterosalivary nitrate
  circulation and serial reduction to nitrite and NO explains the recently described
  reduction in blood pressure seen after dietary supplementation with nitrate. It
  has been suggested () that the well-known cardioprotective effects of a diet rich
  in vegetables is related to their high nitrate content.
