caption: Mechanisms of VEGF/VEGFR-mediated protection of cardiomyocytes from pressure
  stress and ischemia, and potential interactions of sunitinib and sorafenib. Hypertensive
  stress in the heart and the resulting relative ischemia/hypoxia of cardiomyocytes
  activate HIF-1, leading to the release of angiogenic factors including VEGF. VEGF
  activates VEGFRs on the surface of endothelial cells (EC), activating a number of
  pathways that induce vasodilation (NO and PGI2), EC proliferation and survival (Akt
  and ERKs), and the further release of proangiogenic factors, all of which lead to
  angiogenesis in the heart, allowing compensated hypertrophy to occur.,  Sunitinib
  and sorafenib inhibit VEGFRs in ECs, potentially blocking angiogenesis and leading
  to decompensated hypertrophy. Sunitinib, via an off-target effect, may also inhibit
  various cytoprotective pathways in the heart (e.g. RSK, which would otherwise inhibit
  pro-apoptotic Bad). Sorafenib, by inhibiting the Raf/ERK pathway, could also induce
  apoptosis in ECs and cardiomyocytes.
