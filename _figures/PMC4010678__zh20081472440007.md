  link between p38 MAPK and IL-R signaling pathway activated by oxalate in HK-2 cells.
  Increased luminal oxalate levels may either lead to increased intracellular oxalate
  levels or may trigger p38 MAPK activation by acting on cell membranes; however,
  exact mechanisms have not been established. In any case, activated p38 MAPK may
  result in phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors that drive transcriptional
  activation of IL-2Rβ and consequent increase in IL-2Rβ protein levels.
