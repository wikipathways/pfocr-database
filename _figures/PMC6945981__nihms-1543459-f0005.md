caption: 'The effects of perlecan deficiency on transcriptome changes in (A) the 1-day
  study groups and (B) the 7-day study groups. Venn diagrams show the number of DETs
  (Hypo vs. WT) and percentage of increased (red) or decreased (green) transcripts
  in both non-loaded and loaded bones. (C). Significant enrichment was found for ECM-receptor
  interaction and focal adhesion pathways in the cases of 1-day loaded (HL/WL) and/or
  7-day non-loaded (HN/WN) and loaded (HL/WL) comparisons. (D) Suppression of ECM-receptor
  interaction pathway in Hypo bone following 1-day loading (1D HL/WL) was mainly due
  to decreased transcripts of ECM molecules. (E) Suppression of Focal adhesion pathway
  in Hypo bone following 7-day loading (7D HL/WL) was due to both decreased ECM and
  down-stream MLCK and MLC gene/gene groups. Box color: red ↑(increased transcripts);
  green ↓(decreased transcripts); white →(no change in transcript levels).'
