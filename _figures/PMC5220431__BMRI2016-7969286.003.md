caption: Modes of HH-GLI signaling pathway activation in cancer. (a) HH ligands constitutively
  activate the HH pathway in HH ligand-producing cancer cells by autocrine signaling.
  Cancer cells produce HH ligand, and secreted HH ligands activate the HH signaling
  pathway in these cancer cells. (b) Cancer cell-mediated production of HH ligands
  also activates the HH pathway in stroma cells (e.g., CAFs) to maintain cancer cells
  by paracrine signaling. (c) GLI family transcription factors are activated in a
  SMO-independent manner, called the noncanonical pathway. (d) SMO can also activate
  other signaling molecules in cancer cells.
