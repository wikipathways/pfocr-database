caption: Connection between chloroplast redox/ generation and cytosolic signaling
  pathways. The focus is given to the MAPK and OXI1 pathways. The high-energy metabolite  and  are
  exported and feed into the MAPK pathway.  activates the OXI1-dependent pathway.
  Both processes induce changes in gene expression for acclimation, defense, and eventual
  cell death. The MAPK pathway also feeds back into the chloroplast and affects .
