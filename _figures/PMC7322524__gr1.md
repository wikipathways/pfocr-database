caption: Cell death pathways triggered by DNA sensors. (A) The AIM2-like receptors
  AIM2 and IFI16 recognize dsDNA and induce pyroptosis. AIM2 resides in the cytosol,
  while IFI16 can sense viruses such as KSHV in the nucleus. Acetylation (Ac) of IFI16
  promotes its nuclear export. KSHV antagonizes IFI16 by inducing its proteasomal
  degradation. AIM2 and IFI16 bind to dsDNA via their HIN200 domains (HIN) and subsequently
  recruit ASC via Pyrin domain (PYD) interactions. ASC contains a CARD domain, which
  interacts with the CARD of pro-caspase-1, forming a large molecular weight complex
  called the “ASC-speck”. Autocatalytic cleavage of procaspase-1 results in the formation
  of active caspase-1, which cleaves GSDMD releasing the cytotoxic N-terminal fragment
  (p30) that forms pores in the cell membrane. Caspase-1 also cleaves pro-IL1β, leading
  to the maturation into its biologically active form. (B) The cGAS/STING pathway
  detects the presence of dsDNA inside the cytosol and promotes antiviral immunity
  by inducing type I IFN production. On binding of dsDNA, cGAS synthesizes the cyclic
  dinucleotide cGAMP, a ligand for the ER-resident protein STING. cGAMP analogues,
  bacterial cyclic dinucleotides and other molecules such as DMXAA can also bind STING.
  Activated STING recruits the kinase TBK1, which phosphorylates the transcription
  factor IRF3. IRF3 then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it controls
  type I IFN gene expression. STING also induces the activation of the pro-inflammatory
  transcription factor NF-κB. Engagement of cGAS/STING can also induce cell death
  presumably via the cell-intrinsic caspase-9 mediated apoptotic pathway. Active caspase-9
  activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7. Other outcomes of cGAS/STING stimulation
  include cellular senescence, inhibition of T cell proliferation and autophagy. The
  signaling pathways that control these processes are poorly characterized.
