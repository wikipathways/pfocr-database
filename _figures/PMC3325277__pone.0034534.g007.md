caption: Each node represents molecules (microRNAs, gene) and the biological relationship
  between two nodes is represented as a line. These networks include microRNAs with
  expression changes obtained by comparison of the injury 7dpo group (LS7) with respectively
  non-injured control group (CT)(network 1 and 2), Sham 7dpo group (SH7)(network3)
  and injury 1dpo (LS1) (network4). The top four functions associated with networks
  are (A) Inflammatory Disease, Cell Morphology, Cellular Assembly and Organization,
  (B) Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, Cardiac Damage, Cardiovascular Disease,
  (C) Nervous System Development and Function, Tissue Morphology, Cellular Development
  and (D) Cell Death, Nervous System Development and Function, Cellular Function and
  Maintenance.
