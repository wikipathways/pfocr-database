caption: A schematic of the mechanism of NMs-mediated SCs in PNR. (A) NMs can induce
  reprogramming of SCs into repair SCs by activating the key transcription factor
  c-Jun. (B) NMs can enhance the clearance of myelin debris by activating autophagy
  in repair SCs. (C) Nanofibers can promote SCs migration and subsequent formation
  of Bungner's bands by regulating integrin receptor-associated signaling pathways
  that modulate cytoskeletal reorganization. (D) NMs, including nanofibers and electroactive
  NMs, can stimulate SCs proliferation and Bungner's band formation through the activation
  of YAP/TAZ signaling and calcium ion (Ca2+) pathways. (E) NMs can facilitate the
  transition of repair SCs into myelinating SCs by upregulating myelination-specific
  genes
