caption: 'Gray indicates elements common to both genomes, while orange and green show
  elements specific to UASB14 and UASB270, respectively. Both filament types have
  the genes necessary to produce acetate, ethanol, lactate, and hydrogen (and possibly
  propionate) as fermentative end products, likely generating energy through the glycolytic
  Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway and the fermentation of amino acids and sugars.
  Abbreviations: ETF, electron transfer flavoprotein; Fd-ox and Fd-red, oxidized and
  reduced ferredoxin, respectively; UQ, ubiquinone.'
