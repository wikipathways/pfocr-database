caption: 'A summary of the antioxidant strategies in vivant. Flavonoid core, even
  if possess aromatic rings as the other antioxidant molecules, does not share other
  structural characteristics with MAAs, betalains, and melanins and does not contain
  nitrogen. Metabolic pathway of betalains and melanins are simple, several reaction
  are spontaneous, whereas flavonoid biosynthesis involves many reactions mediated
  by enzymes and several branches, that lead to several classes of flavonoids. It
  is interesting how the complexity of chemical molecules and the metabolic pathway
  follow an inverse proportion: melanins possess the most complex structure and the
  simplest biosynthetic pathway, the contrary occurs in the flavonoid metabolism.
  S: spontaneous chemical reaction.'
