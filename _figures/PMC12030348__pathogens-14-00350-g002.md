caption: Calcium/calcineurin pathway based on C. albicans. The activation of this
  cascade occurs when the extracellular calcium stimulus is detected by the Cch1-Mid1
  channel, which is activated and begins to introduce Ca2+ into the cell. Ca2+ accumulates
  in the cytoplasm, and CaM is activated when the Ca2+ concentration increases. Subsequently,
  CaN is activated by CaM, and then, Crz1 is dephosphorylated by CaN. The suggested
  inhibitors, at least in C. albicans, for CaN are FK506, Hsp90, and CsA [88,89,90].
  Once the transcription factor Crz1 is active, it alters the transcription of the
  genes FKS2, CEK1, BMT3, CCH1, PMC1, and ERG26. Figure created with Biorender.com
