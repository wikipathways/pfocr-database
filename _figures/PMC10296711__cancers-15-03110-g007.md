caption: Schematic Illustrations of the cell wall components of Gram-negative (A)
  and Gram-positive (B) bacterial organisms. The LPS of Gram-negative bacteria is
  very important for danger signaling through the activation of TLR4, while the LTA
  of Gram-positive bacteria activates the TLR2 signaling pathway. Created with BioRender.com
