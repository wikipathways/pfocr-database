caption: The TREMs signaling pathway during the course of immune-inflammatory response.
  TREMs associated with the DNAX activation protein-12 (DAP-12) chain subunit can
  activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the phosphorylation of phospholipase
  (PL) Cγ and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 [–]. TREM-1 can act as
  an amplifier of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with infection
  [–]. TREM-2 can act as a negative regulator inhibiting TLR-mediated inflammatory
  response, and enhance the host's ability to eradicate damaged cells and invading
  pathogens [–]. TREMs, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells.
