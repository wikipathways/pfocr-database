caption: Control of Gamma Globin Gene Transcription. Gamma globin production for the
  generation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) occurs through the transcription of the HBG1/2
  genes. (1) This can be negatively regulated through expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia
  11A gene (BCL11A), which has been extensively studied in CRISPR knockout models
  for the induction of gamma globin expression (Frangoul et al. (), Lamsfus-Calle
  et al. (), Khosravi et al. (), Wu et al. (). (2) Kruppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) can
  directly activate gamma globin gene repressors such as BCL11A to play a role in
  switch from gamma to beta globin. CRISPR knockout studies of KLF1 have showed induction
  of gamma globin expression [Shariati et al. ()]. (3) Zinc finger protein 410 (ZNF410)
  can regulate BCL11A repression of gamma globin gene expression via induction of
  the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) complex component CHD4. BCL11A contains
  a motif that can interact with a variety of NuRD-associated molecules, thus allowing
  for activation and then subsequent repression of gamma globin gene expression. CRISPR
  knockout studies of ZNF410 have identified its role as a possible gene target for
  induction of gamma globin expression [Lan et al. ()]. Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP)
  not included in the pathway.
