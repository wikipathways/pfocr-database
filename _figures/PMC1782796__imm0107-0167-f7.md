caption: 'Affinity maturation, a turning point between life and death for germinal
  centre (GC) B cells: a working hypothesis. As shown in  and , and as exhaustively
  reported by many laboratories, B cells will mercilessly die upon entry to the GC.
  Should somatic hypermutation hit the appropriate codons that result in a quasi-perfect
  antigen-binding match, a series of signals could be transduced, leading to CD4–CD154-dependent
  cell survival and the abrogation of apoptosis. Conversely, failure to produce the
  expected antibody specificities could prevent AT-hook transcription factor (AKNA)
  expression, thus leading to poor or no CD154-mediated signalling and the execution
  of the default-death pathway. The other side of the sword considers: non-discriminatory,
  strong, and sustained CD40–CD154 signalling; defective Fas or Fas ligand (FasL)
  function, via mutations;– excessive and non-discriminatory Fas–FasL signalling;
  and variations of the same theme. The equilibrium between the mechanisms that control
  life and death within GC therefore determines the virtual difference between homeostasis
  and disease.'
