caption: Role of nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite in cardiovascular pathophysiology.
  On the one hand, NO by activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cGMP signal transduction
  pathway mediates various physiological/beneficial effects in the cardiovascular
  system including vasodilation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory,
  antiremodelling, and antiapoptotic effects. On the other hand, under pathological
  conditions associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation (myocardial
  infarction, ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, etc.),
  NO and superoxide (O2•−) react to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) which induces cell
  damage via lipid peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes and other proteins by oxidation
  and nitration, and also activation of stress signaling, matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) among others (see also ). Peroxynitrite also triggers the release of proapoptotic
  factors such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria,
  which mediate caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic death pathways. Moreover,
  peroxynitrite, in concert with other oxidants, causes stand breaks in DNA, activating
  the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Mild damage of DNA activates
  the DNA repair machinery. In contrast, once excessive oxidative and nitrosative
  stress-induced DNA damage occurs, like in various forms of myocardial reperfusion
  injury and heart failure, overactivated PARP initiates an energy-consuming cycle
  by transferring ADP-ribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to
  nuclear proteins, resulting in rapid depletion of the intracellular NAD+ and ATP
  pools, slowing the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, eventually
  leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)
  degrades poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers, generating free PAR polymer and ADP-ribose.
  Overactivated PARP also facilitates the expression of a variety of inflammatory
  genes leading to increased inflammation and associated oxidative stress, thus facilitating
  the progression of cardiovascular dysfunction and heart failure.
