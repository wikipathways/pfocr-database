caption: Participation of tRNAs to peptidoglycan synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus.
  (A) Peptidoglycan assembly pathway. Aminoacyl-transferases FmhB, FemA and FemB assemble
  a pentaglycine side chain. The essential role of FmhB (for growth) and of FemA and
  FemB (for methicillin resistance) stems from the fact that the amino group at the
  extremity of the pentaglycine side chain is used for peptidoglycan cross-linking
  in the last step of peptidoglycan polymerization. (B) Alignment of S. aureus tRNAGly
  isoacceptors. P1 and P2, proteogenic isoacceptors; NP1, NP2 and NP3, non-proteogenic
  isoacceptors. Stars indicate the position of invariant nucleotides in the five sequences.
  Bases highlighted in blue and red are divergent within the proteogenic and non-proteogenic
  tRNA groups, respectively. The anticodon is highlighted in grey. (C) Cloverleaf
  representation of the five tRNAGly isoacceptors. Two arrows point to positions 8
  and 19 corresponding to potential sites of posttranscriptional modification of non-proteogenic
  tRNA as discussed in the text (4-thiouridine and 5,6-dihydrouridine, respectively).
  The remaining arrow points to position 32 that determines the capacity of the unmodified
  UCC anticodon to decode all four tRNAGly. The UUC or UGC triplet in the T loop is
  boxed in red.
