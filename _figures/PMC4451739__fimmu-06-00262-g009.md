caption: Regulation of the alternative pathway. (A) FH as a master regulator of C3b
  in the fluid phase and on the cell surface. FH binds to C3b in fluid phase preventing
  novel convertase formation. FH may bind to C3b and GAGs on the cell surface and
  the architecture of the complex depends on the level of activation of the cell and
  the density of deposited C3 fragments. Resting cells have only a few C3b molecules
  that are deposited and FH binds to them with the regulatory domains CCP1-4. CCP7
  and CCP20 interact with GAG on the membrane. Alternately, CCP19 may bind to the
  TED domain of C3b allowing CCP20 to interact with GAGs. If the cell is activated
  and C3b and C3d (or two C3b molecules) are deposited in close proximity, FH may
  bind to two of these molecules, allowing GAG binding by CCP20. (B) On resting cells,
  C3b will immediately be inactivated to iC3b by the action of FI and the assistance
  of cofactors (FH, MCP, CR1). iC3b cannot bind FB and forms C3 convertases. Only
  the cofactor CR1 allows FI to execute a second cleavage generating C3c (released
  in the fluid phase) and C3dg, which remains bound to the cell. C3dg is rapidly transformed
  to C3d by tissue proteases. (C) If the host cell is activated, the complement control
  will not be sufficient to prevent any complement deposition and C3 convertases could
  be formed. To avoid cell damage, these convertases need to be dissociated. Multiple
  complement regulators such as DAF, CR1, and FH decay the C3bBb complex formed on
  host cells. Remaining C3b will be inactivated by FI, using FH, MCP, or CR1.
