caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanisms related to SARS-CoV-2 and
  S protein effect on vascular dysfunction and BBB disruption. Vascular cells and
  pericytes of the BBB can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by the binding
  of the spike protein to ACE2 and b-integrin receptors. The imbalance of the RAS
  pathway mediated by ACE2 downmodulation can lead to activation of the Ang II/AT1R
  axis. Both AT1R activation and viral infection itself can trigger several intracellular
  signaling, such as Ca2+ influx and activation of TMEM16F-scramblase and externalization
  of PtdSer to the outer cell membrane, culminating in the activation of ADAM17. The
  ADAM17 sheddase activity, together with AT1R-mediated RAGE activation may play a
  preponderant role in the inflammatory process by activating inflammatory factors
  such as NOTCH and NF-kB proteins, which in turn can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory
  factors such as TNF-α, IL-6, R-IL6, IL1-β. Figure created with BioRender.com
