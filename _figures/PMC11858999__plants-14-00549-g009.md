caption: Integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the flavonoid biosynthetic
  pathway. Red solid circles indicate up-regulation of DAMs, green solid circles indicate
  down-regulation of DAMs, and values on the right side represent the log2 fold change
  of DAMs (BRAC vs. LEAF). Heatmap represents the expression difference of DEPs and
  was generated based on the log2 fold change values (bracts vs. leaves). Detailed
  annotation information of these DEPs can be found in Table S4
