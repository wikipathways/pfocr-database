caption: Proposed model of how TNF-α and RIPK3 induce KC death following PH. Following
  PH, IL-6 acts on KC as a pro-survival signal. In the absence of tumor, TNF signaling
  leads to the activation of complex IIb and the apoptosis of KC through activation
  of caspase-8 between day 1 and day 2. The presence of tumor cells within the organ
  leads to a switch in the activation of cell death pathways and the RIPK3-dependent
  activation of caspase-1, probably through the activation of inflammasome macromolecular
  complexes. This KC death was linked with a CCL2-dependent recruitment of Ly6Clow
  macrophages. This latter population was shown to favor tumor development, while
  KC maintenance accelerated antitumoral responses. Critical elements demonstrated
  in the paper are described with red arrows and fonts, while deduction from the literature
  is in blue.
