  protease HTRA1, and anti-NTNG1 autoantibodies respectively. (A): 1. In Heymann nephritis,
  anti-Fx1A antibodies bind primarily to megalin on podocytes and activate the classical
  complement pathway (via the IgG2b subclass). 2. Anti-RAP antibodies are also detected
  and may represent epitope spreading due to the association between megalin and RAP,
  which assists the transport of megalin from ER to cell surface. 3. Complement activation
  may be potentially exacerbated by binding of anti-Fx1A antibodies to complement
  regulatory proteins Crry and CD59. 4. Sublethal C5b-9 injury causes intracellular
  calcium influx, activating cPLA2, which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids of the
  podocyte, ER and nuclear envelope. This causes ER stress, generation of ROS, disruption
  of the slit diaphragm protein nephrin, and release of AA with subsequent COX-mediated
  generation of prostanoids (PGE2, TxA2) that increase glomerular filtration pressure,
  exacerbating proteinuria. Glomerular IgG and complement deposition attract glomerular
  infiltrates of CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, and macrophages, potentially via the IgG
  Fc receptor and anaphylatoxins C3a/C5a. 5. Autoantibody production in Heymann nephritis
  is at least in part dependent on Qa-1-expressing Tfh cells, which are inhibited
  by CD8+ Tregs. (B): 1. In primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), autoantibodies are
  predominantly directed against PLA2R, and 2. less commonly against THSD7A, 3. NELL1,
  PCDH7, serine protease HTRA1 and NTNG1, except in pediatric PMN where Sema3B is
  the most common podocyte antigen targeted by autoantibodies. 4. Increased B cells
  and Tfh cells are observed, which interact in the germinal center of lymph nodes
  to induce differentiation of B cells into high-affinity antibody-producing plasma
  cells. Autoantibodies in PMN are primarily of the IgG4 subclass, potentially due
  to Th2-mediated IL-4 production. Loss of tolerance to podocyte antigens such as
  PLA2R may be due to loss of thymus-derived podocyte antigen-specific Tregs. 5. Glycosylated
  anti-PLA2R IgG4 bind the MBL/MASP-1/2 complex to activate the lectin complement
  pathway. 6. This causes activation of C3aR and C5aR as well as deposition of C5b-9,
  which activates cathepsin L- and an aspartic protease-mediated proteolysis of the
  actin cytoskeleton protein synaptopodin and slit diaphragm protein NEPH1 respectively.
  Anti-PLA2R antibody-containing serum is also associated with reduced FH, impaired
  autophagy and reduced adhesion to the GBM, though it is unclear whether these effects
  are mediated via complement activation. 7. Impairment in autophagy results in internalization
  of nephrin and the actin cytoskeleton protein α-actinin-4. 8. Reduced FH leads to
  intracellular fumarate accumulation, which is associated with increased generation
  of ROS, reduced slit diaphragm protein ZO-1 and reduced transcription of WT-1, which
  normally activates the expression of podocyte proteins nephrin and podocalyxin.
  The mechanisms of podocyte injury of other autoantibodies associated with PMN remain
  incompletely understood.'
