caption: 'NO/cGMP and calcium signaling in osteoblast mechanotransduction.  Osteoblast
  exposure to fluid shear stress leads to a rapid increase in  intracellular calcium
  through activation of mechanosensitive and voltage-gated  calcium channels (MSCC
  and VGCC, respectively), and possibly  through calcium release from intracellular
  stores  (,  ,  ,  ,  ). An initial burst of NO  synthesis may require calcium activation
  of NO synthase (NOS), but  sustained NO synthesis is calcium-independent and may
  involve activation of NO  synthase by phosphorylation  (,  ). NO activates sGC and
  the  resulting cGMP activates membrane-bound PKG II, which phosphorylates  substrates
  leading to activation of the MEK/Erk pathway. The MEK/Erk pathway  increases transcription
  of c-fos, fra-1, fra-2, and  fosB/ΔfosB through the following: (i) RSK-mediated  phosphorylation
  and activation of the CREB; (ii) direct phosphorylation of Elk  that forms a complex
  with and activates serum-response factor (SRF);  and (iii) recruitment of AP-1 (Fos/Jun)
  complexes to the promoters  (). Calcium activates the  MEK/Erk pathway through Ras/Raf
  activation of MEK, and can directly activate  CREB through calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase (CamK)  (). Inhibitors used in this  study are indicated in gray.
