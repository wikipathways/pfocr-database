caption: 'DeregulatedWntsignalling in a pathological cascade linked to neurodegeneration.
  Both FAD mutations and genetic variants linked to SAD have been demonstrated to
  deregulate Wntsignalling by both direct and indirect pathways, such as Ab toxicity.
  The red-hued pathway reflects Wntdown regulation as a secondary effect of abnormally
  stimulated cell cycle events by an ab, which results in programmed cell death. The
  possible overactivation of Wntsignalling and its repercussions as a result of FADPSEN
  mutations are depicted in blue. The potential mechanism that connects tau hyperphosphorylation
  and related neurodegeneration to the attenuation of the Wnt signal is shown in grey.Other
  interactions that cause a departure from the typical Wnt/b-catenin signal are shown
  in black. When a pathway is denoted by a question mark, it means that the relationship
  between the two is either unclear or that there are conflicting findings regarding
  the interaction: Li+ , lithium; NFTs, neurofibrillary tangles().'
