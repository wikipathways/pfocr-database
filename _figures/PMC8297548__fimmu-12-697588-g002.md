caption: TIRAP interacting machinery in the activation of inflammatory signaling.
  The membrane localized TIRAP initiates the downstream signaling via its interaction
  with upstream membrane bound receptors TLR4, TLR2 and RAGE as well as with membrane
  localized kinases BTK, p85α subunit of PI3K and BCAP. In TLR4 mediated signaling,
  the membrane localized TIRAP also interacts with TRAF6 for transactivation of the p65
  in NF-κB pathway. The downstream inflammatory signaling via cytoplasmic TIRAP involves
  an interaction with protein kinase PKCδ and p38 MAPK as well as with IRAK2 and AP-1
  subunit c-Jun, respectively. The negative regulators of TIRAP protein including
  SOCS1, CLIP170, IRAK1/4 and Triad3A are involved in interactions with TIRAP for
  its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (U&PD) and hence downregulation in
  inflammatory response mediated via TIRAP. TLR- Toll -interleukin-1 receptor; TIRAP-
