caption: Proposed mechanistic diagram of the multi-faceted, anti-neoplastic effects
  of GSE against lung cancer. Through downregulating oncomirs miR19-a, -19b, -106b
  and modulating their respective downstream targets (increases in tumor suppressors
  PTEN, IGF2R and decrease in activated p-Akt by miR-19a/b; increase in the tumor
  suppressor P21 by miR-106b), as well as modulating major eicosanoids signaling pathways
  (decreases in PGE2 and PGI2 due to COX-2 inhibition, while an increase in PTGIS
  results in an overall increase in PGI2, and an increase in 15-HETE likely due to
  shunting of the arachidonic acid precursor toward the 15-LOX pathway in the setting
  of COX-2 inhibition), GSE increases apoptosis, decreases cell proliferation, decreases
  inflammation, thereby reduces the driving forces of cancerization.
