caption: Alterations in the TCA cycle and glutaminolysis pathway after gp120 treatment.
  TCA cycle and glutaminolysis pathway metabolites that are upregulated (green), downregulated
  (red), and not significantly changed (blue) in LUHMES treated with gp120 compared
  to control cells. Graphs show changes in the associated TCA cycle and glutaminolysis
  pathway metabolites in control and gp120 treated LUHMES. Bar Graphs black bars are
  control samples, gray bars are gp120 treated samples (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
