caption: The mechanism by which phanginin A activated SIK1 to promote glucose uptake
  in skeletal muscle. SIK1 activation leads to the inactivation of HDAC4/5, relieving
  the inhibition on MEF2a and consequently promoting GLUT4 expression. Additionally,
  SIK1 activation induces inactivation of HDAC7, resulting in the upregulation of
  JUP expression and Akt/AS160 signaling pathway, and thus facilitating GLUT4 translocation
