caption: PRV evades the TLR and RLR signaling pathways. TLRs, which are located on
  the cell membrane and within endosomes, detect viral components, such as ssRNA,
  dsRNA, dsDNA, and CpG DNA. Upon recognition, TLRs transmit signals through TRIF
  and MyD88 adaptors, leading to the activation of IRFs and NF–κB. TLRs can also detect
  peptides such as cathelicidins, further activating IRF3 and inducing IFN-β production.
  In the RLR signaling pathway, RIG-I and MDA5 sense viral RNA and signal through
  MAVS on the outer mitochondrial membrane, triggering the activation of IRFs and
  NF–κB. Both the TLR and RLR pathways produce interferons and inflammatory factors,
  which contribute to the antiviral response. PRV-encoded proteins inhibit the TLR
  and RLR signaling pathways, thereby allowing the virus to evade immune detection
  and response
