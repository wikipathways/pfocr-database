caption: Biosynthesis routes of ceramides. Ceramides are synthesized via 3 pathways.
  Firstly, de novo synthesis of ceramides starts in endoplasmic reticulum by coupling
  amino acid serine to palmityl-CoA using palmitoyltransferase in a multi-step process
  and yielding dihydroceramide that will be activated into ceramide by dihydroceramide
  desaturase. Secondly, in Golgi apparatus ceramides can be generated by sphingomyelin
  hydrolysis via acidic/neutral sphingomyelinase. The third biosynthesis method is
  through salvage pathway in which glucosylceramide is converted into ceramides via
  glucosylceramidase. Moreover, ceramides can be metabolized into less toxic sphingosine
  that get phosphorylated to sphingosine-1phosphate via sphingosine kinase. [aSMase,
  acid sphingomyelinase; nSMase, neutral sphingomyelinase; SM, sphingomyelin].
