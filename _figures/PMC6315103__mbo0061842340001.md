caption: ProQ-dependent changes in Salmonella-infected HeLa cells. (a) Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) heat map showing human pathways that were significantly altered
  (FDR < 0.1; normalized enrichment score [NES] > 2 or < −2) between the infections
  of HeLa cells by wild-type (WT) or proQ deletion (ΔproQ) Salmonella strains. Some
  of the most drastically affected pathways are labeled. The results stem from two
  biological replicate experiments. (b) Schematic overview of the classical MAPK signaling
  pathway with comparative Dual RNA-seq data (ΔproQ- versus wild-type-infected HeLa
  cells; 8 and 16 h postinfection [p.i.]) plotted on top. The scheme was drawn manually
  using the human KEGG Pathview representation as the template. The yellow-shaded
  regions highlight branches of the pathway that were most severely affected (on the
  transcript level) by the absence of ProQ. Many of the downstream regulatory events
  are mediated by phosphorylation (+p), and thus, differences are not expected to
  be directly reflected in transcriptome data. Individual branches of the pathway
  converge at the activation of cFOS (black arrow). log-2 f.c., log2 fold change;
  PM, plasma membrane. (c) Western blot analysis confirms alterations in cFOS levels
  in differentially infected host cells. HeLa cells were infected (MOI of 50) with
  either wild-type Salmonella (WT), or the deletion (ΔproQ) or overexpression (proQ++)
  strain of ProQ—the two latter strains have highly similar invasion efficiencies
  and replication kinetics in this system (see  and  in the supplemental material)
  and are therefore directly comparable. Cells were harvested after 16 h p.i., sorted
  into invaded (GFP-positive) cells and uninfected (GFP-negative) bystanders or left
  unsorted (bulk), and total protein samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel,
  transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with cFOS-specific antibodies. Tubulin
  (TUBA1A) serves as a human loading control, and detection of bacterial GFP confirms
  the purity of the sorted fractions.
