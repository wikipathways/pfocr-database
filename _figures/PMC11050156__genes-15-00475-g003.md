caption: Genes and environmental factors involved in the regulation of DON synthesis.
  Factors of the environment, such as oxidative stress and nutrition, induce DON synthesis
  during F. graminearum infection. The transmembrane protein FgSho1 is required for
  deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis in F. graminearum. FgSho1 physically interacts
  with the MAPK module FgSte50-Ste11-Ste7. Gpa1 and Gpb1 act as negative regulators
  of DON production. FgCap1 interacts with adenylate cyclase Fac1 and modulates DON
  production via cAMP signaling. Cpk1 is the major PKA catalytic subunit gene involved
  in DON synthesis. The cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde2 and the regulatory subunit of
  PKA (PKR) also negatively regulate DON production. DON biosynthesis is blocked when
  all three MAPKs are deleted in F. graminearum. Tri6 activates the expression of
  most genes in the DON biosynthetic pathway. TRI10 has been suggested to act upstream
  of TRI6. AreA mediates the regulation of deoxynivalenol (DON) synthesis by cAMP
  signaling. AreA is involved in the transcriptional regulation of TRI genes through
  its interaction with Tri10. FgSR and FgRrg-1 are closely related to the synthesis
  of DON and the expression of DON synthesis-related genes. Deleting the heterochromatin
  protein Hep1 suppresses the expression of TRI5 and TRI6. FgSet1-mediated histone
  3 lysine 4 methylations (H3K4me) modulate the expression of TRI genes. Histone acetyltransferase
  (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes have been shown to be associated
  with DON synthesis. Tri5 cyclizes farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to trichodiene (TDN).
  TDN is then converted to calonectrin (CAL) by nine reactions sequentially catalyzed
  by Tri4, Tri101, Tri11, and Tri3. CAL is hydroxylated by Tri1 and deacetylated by
  Tri8, leading to the formation of either 3-ADON or 15-ADON, followed by DON. Tri1
  and Tri4 are localized to toxisome which is formed through remodeling of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and involved in the early and late steps of DON biosynthesis. Tri12
  facilitates the transport of trichothecene metabolites across a membrane barrier
  and confers toxin resistance
