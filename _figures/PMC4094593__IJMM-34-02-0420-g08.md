caption: Diagram of the roles of miR-206 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells.
  First, miR-206 overexpression downregulated Notch3 expression and, in turn, Bax
  was expression increased, Bcl-2 expression was reduced, which activated caspase-3
  and induced cellular apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Moreover,
  the decreased Notch3 expression resulted in the downregulation of Hes1 and the upregulation
  of p57 expression, and induced cell cycle G1 phase blockage in the HepG2 cells.
  In addition, miR-206 inhibited cell migration through the Notch3-matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9) pathway.
