caption: NADPH oxidase-derived ROS down-modulate protein tyrosine phosphatases, consequently
  increasing FAK phosphorylation. FAKY397 phosphorylation creates a high-affinity
  site for cSrc, as well as stimulates actin polymerization and focal adhesion stabilization,
  positively modulating cell motility, proliferation and survival. NADPH oxidase inhibition
  by DPI or NOX4 siRNA reduces ROS production, what probably leads to an increased
  protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, which, in turn, could inhibit focal adhesion
  formation/stabilization and induce MV3 human melanoma cells death.
