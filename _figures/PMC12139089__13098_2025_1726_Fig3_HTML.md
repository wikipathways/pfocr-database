caption: Activation of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β1) signalling in the development
  of DKD. Hyperglycaemia results in increased advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
  which bind to its receptor (RAGE), resulting in ROS generation in kidney cells.
  It also upregulates the transcription of the TGF-β1 gene, giving rise to TGF-β1
  production. TGF-β1 interacts with key inflammatory and fibrotic pathways, including
  extracellular signal­ regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and the Smad cascade, to drive
  fibrotic gene transcription in the nucleus, promoting mesangial expansion and fibrosis.
  Hyperglycaemia further activates angiotensin II (Angil), which engages the Janus
  kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, further
  promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) formation and ultimately fibrosis.
  The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) promotes
  ECM deposition as well through the non-Smad pathway
