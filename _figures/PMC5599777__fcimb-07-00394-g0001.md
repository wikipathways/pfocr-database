caption: Schematic of chlamydial iron acquisition. Solid black arrows denote iron
  trafficking pathways of the host whereas dashed-line arrows indicate possible mechanisms
  of iron acquisition by Chlamydia. The depiction of endosome-associated Rab-family
  GTPases is not intended to be exhaustive and is based on the findings of Ouellette
  and Carabeo (). Ferric iron (Fe3+) is bound by apo-transferrin (Tf) and endocytosed
  upon recognition by the transferrin receptor (TfR). The holo-Tf-TfR complex proceeds
  into the early endosome, upon which TfR-containing endosomes acquire DMT1, STEAP3,
  and Rab5. Acidification of the early endosome potentiates the dissociation of Fe3+
  from Tf, which can then be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+) by STEAP3. Fe2+, exported
  from the endosome by DMT1 into the cytoplasm, is shunted to ferritin for iron storage
  or incorporated into host iron metabolic processes such as the electron transport
  chain or TCA cycle. It is possible that labile Fe2+ is passively transported through
  the inclusion membrane and the chlamydial outer membrane to be sequestered in the
  periplasm and trafficked into the bacterial cell. A fraction of the TfR-containing
  endosomes will acquire Rab11 and Rab4, proceeding through the slow recycling endosomal
  pathway to be trafficked back to the eukaryotic plasma membrane. In an Chlamydia-infected
  cell, slow recycling Tf-containing endosomes associate with the chlamydial inclusion,
  where a “kiss & run” mechanism may deliver free ferric or ferrous iron into the
  inclusion lumen. Novel siderophores, siderophore receptors or porins may function
  to traffic iron to the periplasm. This outer membrane transport may be dependent
  upon TonB-like energy transduction, given that Chlamydia possess ExbB and ExbD homologs.
  Once inside the periplasm, Fe3+ can be bound by YtgA and shuttled to the membrane
  permease likely formed by YtgC and YtgD. ATP hydrolysis mediated by YtgB likely
  provides the energy to import iron into the chlamydial cytosol. The reduction of
  Fe3+ to biologically useful Fe2+ may be performed by an unidentified ferrireductase.
  Upon acquisition of Fe2+, Chlamydia can then incorporate iron into the electron
  transport chain via porphyrin biosynthesis, divert iron to Fe-S cluster biosynthesis
  or utilize iron in other metabolic processes.
