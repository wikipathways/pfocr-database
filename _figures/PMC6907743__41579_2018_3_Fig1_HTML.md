caption: In host cells, various pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which leads to the activation of
  transcription factors and the induction of the interferon (IFN) response. Endosomal
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize viral nucleic acids and recruit the adaptor
  proteins TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein MYD88, relaying signals to the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  and mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Binding to MYD88 or TRIF
  causes Beclin 1 to dissociate from the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitory complex,
  resulting in the induction of autophagy. TRIF is targeted by selective autophagy
  by the tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32)–TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1)
  complex for degradation. JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylates BCL-2 to initiate
  Beclin 1-mediated autophagy. During RNA virus infection, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I) senses double-stranded (ds)RNA and signals through mitochondrial
  antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3),
  leading to the production of IFN. To suppress RIG-I signalling, the autophagy protein
  5 (ATG5)–ATG12 complex disrupts the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Interferon-induced,
  dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2α) to induce autophagy. During DNA virus infection, the
  DNA sensor cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) produces the secondary messenger
  cGAMP, which activates stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), IRF3 and
  IFN expression. Furthermore, cGAS competes with Rubicon for Beclin 1 binding, thus
  triggering autophagy. Beclin 1 also suppresses cGAMP production and activates ULK1
  to phosphorylate STING for its degradation. ATG9 inhibits the aggregation of STING
  on Golgi apparatus-derived compartments to suppress the DNA sensing. STING undergoes
  desumoylation and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated degradation. Finally,
  extracellular IFN is recognized by the interferon receptor (IFNAR) and activates
  JAK–STAT (Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription) signalling.
  JAK1 and non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2 phosphorylate insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, leading to the activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR (phosphoinositide
  3-kinase–AKT–mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway and forkhead box 3 transcription
  factor (FOXO3) as well as the expression of autophagy-related genes. ISGs, interferon-stimulated
  genes; MDA5, interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1; SENP2, sentrin-specific
  protease 2; TBK1, tank-binding kinase 1; TUFM, elongation factor Tu, mitochondrial;
  VPS34, vacuolar protein sorting 34.
