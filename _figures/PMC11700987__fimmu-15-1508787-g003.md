caption: Activation of Nrf2 in S. pneumoniae and M. tuberculosis infections. (A) The
  inflammatory and redox response to S. pneumoniae infection (green spheres) in lung
  epithelial cells is initiated by their interaction with pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) that stimulate the activation of the inflammatory response mediated by NF-κB,
  which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of TNF-α, iNOS, and
  COX-2. Simultaneously, S. pneumoniae induces the generation of mitochondrial reactive
  species (i.e. H2O2). An increment of H2O2 activates the transcription factor Nrf2.
  This in turn promotes expression of antioxidant and autophagy genes, allowing elimination
  of H2O2, promoting bacterial phagocytosis, and reducing the inflammatory response
  by blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. (B) M. tuberculosis (purple rods)
  uses a mechanism very similar to that employed by S. pneumoniae because it interacts
  specifically with host cell TLRs, activating NF-κB-mediated inflammation. At the
  same time, the increase in H2O2 upon infection activates Nrf2, which promotes the
  expression of antioxidant enzymes thereby re-establishing cellular homeostasis,
  reducing inflammation, and favoring bacterial clearance through the autophagosome
  pathway. (C) Nrf2 activation by molecules such as SFN, TBHQ, and resveratrol, among
  others, restores the host redox imbalance, tissue damage and inflammation. These
  compounds are also able to regulate bacterial persistence and burden by inducing
  the expression of genes targeting autophagy. ARE, antioxidant response element;
