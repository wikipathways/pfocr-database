caption: Pathways associated with the sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to
  metformin under normoglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions. (A) Under normoglycemic
  conditions metformin opposes the expression of MYC and tumor cells display sensitivity
  to metformin-induced killing. (B) Under hyperglycemic conditions metformin-induced
  prevention of MYC expression is abolished. MYC upregulates the expression of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), which in turn inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. Glycolytic
  flux is therefore increased and tumor cells display resistance to the toxic effects
  of metformin. The red “X” symbol denotes inhibition of a signaling pathway. Upward
  pointing arrow denotes upregulation.
