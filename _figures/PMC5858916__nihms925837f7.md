caption: In intestinal epithelial cells, rotaviruses are recognized by the pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX58 (RIG-I) and
  interferon (IFN)-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (MDA5). These PRRs
  then signal through mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) to stimulate
  the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway
  to induce IFN type I, II or III responses. In an autocrine manner, this initially
  stimulates IFN signalling through the IFN receptor and then stimulates signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT)1, STAT2 and IRF9 to induce transcription of
  IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that amplify IFN production. In human cells in vitro,
  evasion of the innate IFN response is mediated principally by rotavirus non-structural
  protein 1 (NSP1) through inhibition of NF-κB activation via degradation of F-box/WD
  repeat-containing protein 1A (BTRC; also known as β-TrCP),. A second mechanism is
  mediated by NSP1 and inhibits STAT1 activation, therefore blocking type I and type
  III IFN responses. Indeed, results from experiments using human rotavirus strains
  in human intestinal enteroid cultures support the findings that homologous rotavirus
  infection is very efficient at evading the type I and III IFN responses in mice.
  Other viral proteins (VPs) might be involved in the suppression of the IFN response
  through inactivation of MAVS. IFNAR1, IFN-α/β receptor 1; IκB, inhibitor of nuclear
  factor-κB; IKK-ε, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit ε; JAK1, Janus kinase 1; ISRE,

  tyrosine kinase TYK2.
