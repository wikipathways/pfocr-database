caption: Regulation of PTPIP51 interactions in breast cancer. The inhibition of EGFR
  in Her2 amplified breast cancer cells induces the same effects as observed in the
  HaCat cell line upon EGFR inhibition regarding the formation of the Raf-1/14-3-3β/PTPIP51
  complex. The sensitivity of Her2 amplified breast cancer cells towards EGFR-targeted
  TKIs correlates with the regulation of the interaction of PTPIP51 with c-Src. The
  selective inhibition of Her2 induces a formation of a PTPIP51/Her2/c-Src complex,
  which depicts a potential resistance mechanism against anti-Her2 therapies (black
  arrows indicate a phosphorylation/activation, arrows with vertical bar as arrow
  head indicate an inhibition of interaction/activation) (A); regulation of PTPIP51
  interactions in Glioblastoma multiforme. The left side of the figures depicts the
  regulation of PTPIP51 interactome under EGFR inhibition. Contrary to the expectations,
  the inhibition of the EGFR induces a disruption of the Raf-1/14-3-3β/PTPIP51 complex.
  The right side of the figure shows that the upregulated 14-3-3 protein levels in
  gliomas of high malignancy potentially inhibit the translocation of PTPIP51 to the
  mitochondrion and thus its apoptosis-inducing effects (black arrows indicate a phosphorylation/activation,
  arrows with vertical bar as arrow head indicate an inhibition of interaction/activation,
  dotted black arrows indicate a dissolution of the Raf-1/14-3-3β/PTPIP51 complex
  via EGFR inhibition) (B).
