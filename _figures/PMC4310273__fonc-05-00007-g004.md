caption: Intracellular post-translational modifications of calreticulin. Mis-folded
  proteins directly leave the ER and are ubiquitinated in the cytosol before degradation
  in the proteasome. Calreticulin has been shown to be transported to the cytosol
  possibly via the nucleus. Within the nucleus, calreticulin is exposed to protein
  arginase deaminase 4 (PAD4) where it may be citrullinated before being shuttled
  to the cytosol in association with nuclear export proteins. There is no evidence
  of calreticulin being ubiquitinated in the cytosol, but it does encounter arginyl-tRNA
  transferases, which can arginylate the protein. The addition of arginine on the
  protein can be further citrullinated in the cytosol in the presence of iNOS as a
  byproduct of nitric oxide production from the conversion of arginine to citrulline.
  Both citrullinated and arginylated isoforms of calreticulin have been found outside
  of the cell, where they exert specific biological functions. Artificial glycosylation
  of calreticulin leads to the secretion of calreticulin out of the cell via the secretory
  pathway and glycosylated isoforms of calreticulin have been observed in human myeloid
  cells.
