caption: Possible targets of transition metals (TMs) on the HPHE signaling pathway.
  TMs may enter renal cells via transporters and channels for essential metal ions,
  such as Fe2+. One of these transporters is the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1).
  TMs may compete with Fe2+ and thereby prevent entry of Fe2+ via DMT-1, resulting
  in depletion of intracellular iron needed as a cofactor for PHDs (1). TMs contribute
  to augmented generation of free radicals, either by interfering with reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) scavenging mechanisms (2), by their own redox activity (3), or by
  disrupting the mitochondrial electron transport chain (4). Increased ROS inhibit
  PHDs by oxidizing PHD bound Fe2+ to Fe3+. TMs may activate HIFs by substituting
  for Fe2+ in PHDs and inactivation of the enzyme (5). TMs may deplete intracellular
  ascorbate (AA) and consequent oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the catalytic center
  of PHDs (6). TMs may stabilize HIF by occupying the VHL-binding domain thereby inhibiting
  the interaction between VHL protein and hydroxylated HIFs (7). For further details,
