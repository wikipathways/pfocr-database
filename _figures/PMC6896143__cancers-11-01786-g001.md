caption: Bcl-protein dependent apoptotic pathway in a normal cell, cancer cell and
  a cancer cell treated with apoptotic inducers. (a) In a normal cell, Bcl-2 acts
  as an inhibitor of apoptosis and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak)/B-cell
  associated X protein (Bax) complex initiates apoptosis upon stress. Bcl-2 homology
  domain 3 (BH3) forms a complex with Bcl-2 to deactivate Bcl-2 and Bax/Bak can initiate
  apoptosis by forming symmetric poly-oligomers which causes mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) and releases cytochrome C in the cytoplasm for initiation
  of apoptosis. (b) However, in cancer cell, Bcl-2 is over-expressed and the concentration
  of BH3 is comparatively low. Thus, Bcl-2 is upregulated resulting in inhibition
  of apoptosis. (c) Navitoclax and TW-37 mimic BH3 and form a complex with Bcl-2 to
  deactivate proliferation and initiate apoptosis by Bak/Bax protein complex formation.
