caption: Agonist binding to MORs can result in the activation of multiple downstream
  pathways. Different agonists can selectively activate one or a number of these pathways
  that give rise to agonist-selective signaling through a single receptor subtype.
  G protein-dependent processes include the regulation of ion channels and inhibition
  of adenylyl cylase. Mechanisms involved in desensitization may involve selective
  activation of one or another kinase dependent pathway. G protein-independent processes,
  including the steps leading to endocytosis and interactions with scaffolding molecules
  and kinases, may influence MOR signaling by both direct and potentially indirect
  mechanisms.
