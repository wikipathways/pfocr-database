caption: 'Metabolic flux in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) after oxidative stress
  and/or GAPDH inhibition in cells (adapted according to Kuehne et al. []). The metabolic
  rerouting in oxidative and nonoxidative PPP has important physiological roles in
  stabilization of the redox balance and ROS clearance. Acute activation of oxidative
  PPP is considered a first-line response to oxidative stress in cells. Oxidants induce
  rerouting of glucose flux into oxidative PPP within seconds. Initial rerouting is
  independent of GADPH inhibition. Multiple cycling of carbon compounds in the oxidative
  PPP potentially amplifies NADPH production. The metabolic PPP activation might be
  involved in resistance against ROS, particularly in cancer cells. Gray arrow indicates
  that in cancer cells this step is not reversible due to the loss of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  activity. The black blunt end indicates the inhibition of GAPDH. G6DH: glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPP: pentose phosphate
  pathway; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
