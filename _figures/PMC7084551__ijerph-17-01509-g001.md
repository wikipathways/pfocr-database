caption: A schematic diagram illustrating potential (speculative at the moment) cellular
  mechanisms of MP/NP toxicity. MPs/NPs can be taken up through ingestion and inhalation.
  MPs/NPs could damage the plasma membrane and impair the gut barrier (left). These
  could also perturb signaling of cell surface receptors, and alter gene expression
  in the nucleus. Endocytosed MPs/NPs could also perturb the endocytic pathway function
  and compromise the endosomal membranes. Stresses arising from the above could activate
  the cellular innate immune system, with endogenous and secreted damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMP) inducing the innate immunity-mediating toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). Stresses could induce ROS production from the NADP oxidases (NOXs). Mitochondrial
  impairment, either by MPs/NPs from endosomes or in response to stresses, could also
  produce more ROS through impairment in the efficiency of electron transport chain
  (ETC) processes. MPs/NPs gain access into the circulation if the gut–vascular barrier
  is compromised or it may speculatively occur by transcytosis, thus reaching other
  organs. The lung probably has a more direct access to airborne MPs/NPs (right).
