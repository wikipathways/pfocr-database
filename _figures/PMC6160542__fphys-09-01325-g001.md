caption: 'Fibrogenic secretome pathways implicated in the development of fibrosis
  and their dependence on SIRT1. Secretomic findings of DKK3 and Jagged1 are shown
  in red. DKK3 induces the Wnt pathway activating the frizzled receptor with its co-receptors
  LRP5/6. Further activation of the GSK3β leads to β-catenin nuclear translocation
  and therefore inducing the TCF/LEF family, target genes of the Wnt pathway. Jagged1
  activates the Notch pathway with further NICD nuclear translocation and activation
  of Hes and Hey genes. Lack of SIRT1 leads to less degradation of NICD, which also
  leads to more β-catenin nuclear translocation, combining the Wnt and Notch pathway.
  Abbreviations: Wnt, wingless-related integration site – a signaling glycoprotein;
  Fz, frizzled receptor – a family of G protein-coupled receptor proteins serving
  as Wnt receptors; Disheveled – a family of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins downstream
  of frizzled receptors, which are involved in canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling;
  NICD, notch intracellular domain; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; TCF/LEF
  family is a group of transcription factors involved in the Wnt signaling pathway;
  Hes, hairy and enhancer of split transcription factor protein; and Hey hairy/enhancer-of-split
  related transcription factor protein.'
