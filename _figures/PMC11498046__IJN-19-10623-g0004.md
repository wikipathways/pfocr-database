caption: (A) Preparation of PGRsEV-siYTHDF1. (B) PGRsEV-siYTHDF1 inhibits gastric
  cancer progression by targeting FZD7 and modulating its translation through an m6A-dependent
  mechanism. This action disrupts the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Additionally,
  it enhances immunotherapy by promoting the self-presentation of immunogenic tumor
  antigens and employing a CD47 blockade strategy, which intensifies the cytotoxic
  effects of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
