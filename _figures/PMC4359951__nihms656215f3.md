  are classified as activating (high-level amplification or known activating mutation
  colored red), inactivating (homozygous loss or truncating mutation colored blue),
  or potentially cancer associated (COSMIC mutation colored white). For each pathway,
  we show integrated heatmaps (similar to ) to show the detailed alteration pattern
  of each gene; however, we now also include light red and light green to represent
  low-level CNAs. Note that each heatmap is sorted independently across the samples,
  to best illustrate the pattern of mutations, such as mutual exclusivity or concurrence.
