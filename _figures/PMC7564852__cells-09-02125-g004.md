caption: Schematic representing the molecular mechanism of transcriptional repression
  in TCF/LEF-dependent Wnt outcomes. Β-catenin-TCF/LEF-regulated transcription can
  be inhibited via various mechanisms, including 1. interfering with the interaction
  between β-catenin and TCF/LEF, as shown for ICAT (aka CNNTBIP1, β-catenin-interacting
  protein 1), DACT2 (Dapper homolog 2), Chibby, CtBP (C-terminal-binding protein 1),
  2. binding with β-catenin to facilitate its nuclear export, such as Chibby and CtBP,
  3. interfering with the interaction between β-catenin and its co-activators, such
  as ICAT—targeting the β-catenin-p300 complex and LATS2—targeting the β-catenin-BCL9
  complex and 4. interfering with the binding of TCF/LEF to DNA, such as OSX (Osterix).
