caption: 'Role of TGF-β signaling in the Drosophila antibacterial response. The TGF-β
  pathway ligands dpp and daw are activated differently during bacterial infection,
  with dpp activated by injury and the daw ligand activated by Gram-positive bacteria
  (Micrococcus luteus) but repressed by Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli).
  Once activated, the TGF-β pathway is implicated in four primary responses to bacterial
  infection: Repression of antimicrobial peptides, modulation of the melanization
  response, changes in metabolic rates, and regulation of inflammatory responses.
  Each of these responses functions to promote organismal survival during infection.'
