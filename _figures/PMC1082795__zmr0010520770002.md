caption: 'Selected examples of gene assembly leading to novel carotenoids in E. coli.
  Combining enzymes from different source organisms can lead to rare or novel carotenoids.
  In some cases, such as with CrtC and CrtD (, ), new pathway branches can be uncovered
  by replacing an enzyme with its counterpart from a different organism (). Carotenoids
  in boxes had not been previously identified in biological material or chemically
  synthesized. Enzyme abbreviations: Al-1, phytoene desaturase from Neurospora crassa
  (five-step); CrtC, neurosporene 1,2-hydratase; CrtD, 1-OH-neurosporene 3,4-desaturase;
  CrtIEu, phytoene desaturase from Erwinia uredovora (four-step); CrtIRc, phytoene
  desaturase from Rhodobacter capsulatus (three-step); CrtW, β,β-carotene 4,(4′)-ketolase;
  CrtX, zeaxanthin glycosylase; CrtY, lycopene β-cyclase; CrtZ, β,β-carotene 3,(3′)-hydroxylase.
  Other enzyme subscripts: Aa, “Agrobacterium aurantiacum” (current designation, Paracoccus
  sp. strain MBIC1143); Eu, Erwinia uredovora (current approved name, Pantoea ananatis);
  Rg, Rubrivivax gelatinosus; Rs, Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Natural pathways leading
  to the synthesis of demethylspheroidene and β,β-carotene are shaded. The dotted
  arrow represents trace enzymatic conversion, and the crossed-out arrow denotes undetectable
  enzymatic conversion. References to original publications describing the biosynthesis
  of various compounds are given in brackets beside compound names.'
