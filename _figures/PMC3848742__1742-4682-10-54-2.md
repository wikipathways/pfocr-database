caption: cAMP and cGMP pathways. Reaction pathways triggered by sympathetic and parasympathetic
  neural stimuli invoking cAMP [] and cGMP-mediated [] modulation of various sub-cellular
  targets respectively. ACh-mediated effects of junctional receptor on Na+ current
  and background Na+ current and extrajunctional muscarinic M 2/K ACh receptor on
  I K,ACh (direct muscarinic pathway) and cAMP-mediated effects of β-adrenoreceptor
  (adrenergic pathway) and cholinergic M 2/ADC receptor (indirect muscarinic pathway)
  on L-type Ca2+ (I Ca,L), K+ (I K), hyperpolarization-activated (I f), and Na+/ K+
  (I NaK)currents are shown ‡. Although cAMP-dependent modulation of I Ca,L and Iup
  are known to be PKA-mediated, we make use of a lumped cAMP term to model this influence.
  A similar lumped cAMP term is employed to modulate phosphorylation of PLB which
  in turn affects the SERCA pump. ACh triggered NO-mediated synthesis of cGMP by sGC
  is modeled employing a 3-state model for sGC transition based on Yang et al. [].
  cGMP is involved in suppressing cAMP activity via PDE. cGMP also enhances IPMCA,
  Ca2+ activated K+ channel (IKCa) and suppresses ICa,L, Icyt,serca via PKG (not explicitly
  modeled, but lumped into a cGMP term). ‡The rat ventricular cell model used in this
  study is however limited to Ca2+ related channel, exchanger and pumps (ICa,L, INaCa,
  IPMCA and Icyt,serca), while lacking exclusive Na+ or K+ related channels and transporters
  (as shown in Figure , Krishna et al. []). The part of the model describing cAMP-mediated
  pathway used in our study is highlighted (blue).
