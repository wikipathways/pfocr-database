caption: Innate immune evasion by coronaviruses. Upon viral RNA sensing, the expression
  of type I and III interferons (IFNs) is activated. IFNs are secreted in an autocrine
  and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)
  through the STAT1/2 signaling pathway. RNA-processing enzymes Nsp15 and Nsp16 are
  essential for the escape from viral RNA sensing, while other expressed non-structural
  or accessory proteins inhibit the STAT1/2 pathway. The regions encoding for the
  NSP15 and NSP16 proteins are highlighted with black color and their 3D structures
  are displayed in cartoon representation based on PDB files 6WXC and 6WVN respectively.
