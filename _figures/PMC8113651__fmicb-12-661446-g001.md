caption: HIV-1 modulation of autophagy during early infection and viral non-productive
  bystander cell contact, and in persistent infected cells/tissues. Cell scheme summarizing
  the effect of HIV-1 on autophagy and associated factors in different HIV-1 scenarios.
  (A) HIV-1 Env mediates autophagy inhibition during early infection in CD4+ T cells.
  Autophagy associated factors affected by HIV-1 Env signaling are shown in blue boxes.
  (B) This scheme shows that HIV-1 Env requires active ARF6 associated autophagy factor
  for productive infection in CD4+ T cells. (C) This panel shows autophagy associated
  factors (blue boxes) that are activated during non-productive virus-bystander cell
  contacts. This HIV-1 Env-triggered late autophagy activation leads to CD4+ cell
  death. (D) This panel shows autophagy associated factors (in blue boxes) that are
  activated by HIV-1 infection in persistent infected cells and/or tissues. Arrow
  colors represent the reported positive (green) and negative (red) effects on the
  different steps of the viral life cycle, with dotted arrows signaling the HIV-1
  activation pathway. This figure supports the information summarized in . Cell schemes
  were created with BioRender.com.
