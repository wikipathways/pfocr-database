caption: Schematic of proposed effects of IGFBP1 on vascular endothelial cells. IGFBP1
  forms high-affinity complexes with circulating IGFs in the circulation (1) and confers
  dynamic regulation of IGF-I activity at the type 1 IGF receptor (2). IGF-I acts
  in a similar manner to insulin in endothelial cells, stimulating NO generation by
  activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (4). In the current study, we have demonstrated
  that IGFBP1, which is expressed in the vascular wall as well as present in the circulation,
  stimulates NO production independently of IGF and the type 1 IGF receptor. Although
  the receptor for IGFBP1 (6) and the proximal signaling intermediaries are yet to
  be identified, IGFBP1-stimulated NO production is also mediated through the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, culminating in phosphorylation of eNOS (7) and an increase in NOS activity.
  In addition to direct effects on endothelial cells, IGFBP1 also enhances insulin
  sensitivity in endothelial cells potentially by upregulating signaling via the insulin
  receptor (8). It is likely that this is a chronic effect, considering that we observed
  enhanced insulin signaling in isolated vessels ex vivo in the absence of hIGFBP1.
  Enhanced NO bioavailability may contribute to the lower blood pressure, reduced
  atherosclerosis, and improved insulin sensitivity we observed in hIGFBP1-overexpressing
  mice. It is also possible that IGFBP1 improves whole-body insulin sensitivity by
  stimulating the PI3K/Akt pathway in canonical insulin-sensitive tissues. IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate.
