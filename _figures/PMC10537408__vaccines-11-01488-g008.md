caption: miRNAs in the HSV-2 infection of macrophages. HSV-2 infection of the macrophages
  elevates the expressions of hsa-miR-374a, -miR-29b, -miR-195 and miR-181a, and encourages
  the suppression of their respective target expressions. With the suppression of
  the targets of miR-374a, miR-195 and miR-181a, i.e., IL10, AKT1 and PI3K, AKT1 is
  ultimately suppressed, and is therefore, unable to inhibit autophagy. Suppression
  of AKT1 should have activated Bax-induced Caspase 3 elevation to trigger apoptosis,
  however, the elevated levels of miR-29b inhibit Caspase 3 in HSV-2 infection. Similarly,
  HSV-2 represses the expression of miR-211, which targets SOS1 and CAV1. These two
  targets are not suppressed by miR-211 and are able to inhibit mTOR and AKT1, respectively,
  leading to induction of autophagy. Thus, autophagy may be induced in HSV-2 infection
  of the macrophages in many ways. Further, a combinatorial miRNA exposure before
  HSV-2 infection is able to decrease the viral replication in the THP-1 macrophages
  and therefore, restrict the release of new virus particles. The arrows represented
  in green and blue indicate the findings shown in this manuscript, where green arrows
  represent upregulation or activation and blue arrows represent suppression or inhibition.
  The arrows in red represent the pathways already reported before this manuscript.
  The dotted arrows are indicative of the events that would have occurred but were
  interrupted due to HSV-2 infection. All-in-all, the miRNAs recognized to be modulated
  by HSV-2 infection can be ectopically expressed and may work synergistically to
  reduce HSV-2 infection in the macrophages.
