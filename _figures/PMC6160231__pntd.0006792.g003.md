caption: 'Cellular pathways associated with the altered phosphoproteins as a result
  of T. cruzi infection were derived and grouped at the meta-level using enrichment
  analysis of significant protein changes mapped to the following canonical pathway
  groups: immunological response, fibrotic extracellular response, neuronal response,
  intracellular signaling, and stress-associated signaling. Proteins were categorized
  into type or class (node color) and degree of connection to their respective cellular
  signaling pathways (node size).'
