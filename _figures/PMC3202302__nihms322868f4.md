caption: Signaling via the BCR and BAFF-R are both critical for B-cell maturity and
  homeostasis. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the immunoreceoptor tyrosine
  activation motifs (ITAMs) of the cytoplasmic tails of BCR-associated Igα and Igβ
  chains initiates BCR-proximal signaling and the formation of an active signalosome.
  Phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines by Src family kinases leads to the recruitment
  and activation of the kinase Syk and the Tec family kinase BTK, as well as phosphorylation
  and recruitment of the adaptor BLNK and the lipase PLCγ2. The assembly of an active
  BCR-proximal signaling complex ultimately leads to activation of MAPKs (not pictured)
  and canonical NFκB signaling via PKCβ and the CARMA1-MALT1-BCL10 complex which functions
  to activate IKK1/IKK2. Activation of the IKK1-IKK2-NEMO complex results in phosphorylation
  of IκBα, marking it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Activation of
  canonical NFκB signaling by the BCR leads to induction of transcription of p100,
  BAFF-R, and cRel (among others), which are critical for BAFF-R signaling. The CD19
  coreceptor molecule promotes activation of the PI3K pathway leading to activation
  of AKT. AKT activation promotes B-cell survival and metabolism through the inhibition
  of FOXO1, upregulation of MCL-1 and inhibition of BIM, as well as activation of
  the mTORC1 complex. BAFF-R signaling also activates PI3K (via an unknown mechanism),
  as well as non-canonical NFκB signaling. Following BAFF engagement of the BAFF-R,
  TRAF2 and TRAF3 are recruited leading to the release of NIK, which phosphorylates
  IKK1 leading to p100 processing to p52 and activation of non-canonical NFκB.
