caption: TEAD1 promotes the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition during TAC or Ang-II-induced
  pathological cardiac remodelling through the Wnt signalling pathway. TAC or Ang
  II stimulation induces TEAD1 expression, which binds to the promoter of Wnt4 to
  promote its expression through interaction with BRD4. The overexpressed Wnt4 enhances
  the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thus activating the canonical Wnt signalling
  pathway to promote the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. This figure was drawn
