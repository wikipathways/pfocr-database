caption: Outline of pathways controlling the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
  in C. elegans. (A) Cell autonomous pathways controlling UPRmt within a cell include
  signaling through the ATFS-1 transcription factor, which is normally targeted to
  mitochondria and degraded, but can get routed to the nucleus when mitochondrial
  protein import is blocked. The other pathway involves activation of GCN-2, which
  inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis. (B) Cell nonautonomous UPRmt is triggered
  in intestinal cells by neurotransmitters (serotonin and FLP-2) that are secreted
  by stressed neurons.
