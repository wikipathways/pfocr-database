caption: 'Proteasomes, which in yeast are concentrated in the nucleus, separate into
  core particle (CP) and regulatory particle (RP) during starvation for nutrients
  such as nitrogen or carbon. Both CP and RP relocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  under these conditions. Nitrogen starvation induces degradation of proteasomal particles
  through the macroautophagy pathway, and this requires ESCRT factors. Under low glucose
  conditions, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated, and proteasomes can
  either move into proteasome storage granules (PSGs) or get degraded by one of two
  autophagic mechanisms, macroautophagy or microautophagy; only the latter is ESCRT-dependent
  under these conditions. The microautophagy pathway appears to preferentially remove
  aberrant proteasomes. ILV: Intralumenal vesicle.'
