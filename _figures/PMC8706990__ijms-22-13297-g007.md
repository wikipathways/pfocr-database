caption: 'Genome-wide overview of the results of Reactome pathway analysis. Pathways
  are arranged in a hierarchy. The centre of each of the circular “bursts” is the
  root of a higher level track, e.g., “Immune system”. Each step away from the centre
  represents the next lower level in the track hierarchy. The colour coding denotes
  the overrepresentation of that track in its input dataset: yellow means overrepresentation,
  while light grey means that tracks are not significantly overrepresented.'
