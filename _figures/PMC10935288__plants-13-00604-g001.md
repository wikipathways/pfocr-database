caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ginsenoside Ro. Up to the oleanolic acid synthase,
  key enzymes on this synthetic pathway have been cloned and characterized in several
  species. The reported glycosyltransferases from different plants of the Ginseng
  genus directly involved in the synthesis of ginsenoside Ro are marked with different
  colors, and the relevant glycosyl groups in the glycosylation modification steps
  they catalyze are marked with the corresponding colors. Yellow arrows mark the main
  glycosylation modification pathways
