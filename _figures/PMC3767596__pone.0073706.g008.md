caption: CD9 expression is downregulated by either inactivation of HDAC (e.g., by
  LPS or cigarette smoke exposure) or activation of the mevalonate pathway. The loss
  of CD9 causes the transfer of the LPS-signaling mediator CD14 from tetraspanin-enriched
  microdomains to lipid rafts and thereby leads to augmentation of LPS-induced inflammatory
  signaling in macrophages. Theophylline and dexamethasone (which activate HDACs)
  or statins (which inhibit the mevalonate pathway) upregulate CD9 and may reverse
  this cascade in inflammatory lung diseases, including COPD.
