caption: Subgraph of 1-hr BNM highlighting four potential SMM pathway. Nodes represent
  the metabolite, genotype and phenotype variables and edges represent the conditional
  dependencies between them. The maternal features are represented by square nodes
  and the offspring features are represented by circle nodes. Newborn outcome variables
  are grey, genotypes are green, and the remaining colors correspond to different
  metabolite classes. The solid, red edges correspond to the four purported SMM pathways
  involving 1-hr metabolites with statistically significant IDE after FDR correction
  and positive proportion mediated in the training data set, with nominal significance
  and positive PM confirmed in the validation data set. Dashed, grey edges correspond
  to nodes adjacent to the SMM pathways. AA, amino acid; AC, acylcarnitine; CHO, carbohydrate;
  FA, fatty acid; GC/TCA, glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid cycle; OA, organic acid; PUR/PYR,
  purine or pyrimidine.
