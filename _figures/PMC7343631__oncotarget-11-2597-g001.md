caption: This figure includes an explanation of our previously described work establishing
  the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model []. The cartoon on the top left
  side, with the black arrow lines, shows that immunodeficient mice were subcutaneously
  implanted with the primary osteosarcomas obtained from a seven-year-old girl after
  definitive surgery, but prior to chemotherapy. Successful grafted human tumors propagated
  in mice in passage 1 (P1*), passage 2 (P2*), passage 3 (P3*), and later passages
  (black line). A PDX tumor called OS-33 was chosen to be an in vivo mouse tumor model
  in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium and has been used to test numerous
  anticancer agents, including rapamycin []. In this study, we established a novel
  cell line, COS-33, from a P3* tumor of OS-33. The cartoon on the bottom right side
  with red arrow lines shows that the primary cells have been propagated in in vitro
  cell culture more than 50 passages so far. The COS-33 line can be used as a cellular
  model to study OS cell biology and to screen for cancer drugs.
