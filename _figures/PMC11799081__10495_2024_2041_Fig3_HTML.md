caption: 'Mechanisms of Ferroptosis. The mechanisms of ferroptosis can be primarily
  categorized into two pathways: GXP4-dependent and non-GXP4-dependent. The former
  pathway is inhibited by erastin and RSL3, and the inactivation of GPX4 results in
  the accumulation of PLOOH, potentially leading to rapid and irreparable membrane
  damage, ultimately causing cellular iron toxicity. The latter pathway involves FSP1,
  which loses its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis when its
  NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity is compromised. In addition, electrons
  may escape from cellular redox reactions and be trapped by oxygen to form peroxides
  (H2O2). The fenton reaction then oxidizes Fe2+ and H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals,
  which react with lipids to form lipid free radicals, triggering lipid peroxidation
  and leading to ferroptosis. GXP4: glutathione peroxidase 4; PLOOH: phospholipid
  hydroperoxide; FSP1: ferroptosis suppressor protein 1'
