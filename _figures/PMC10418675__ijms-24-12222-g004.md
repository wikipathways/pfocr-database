caption: Targeting multiple pathways in drug-resistant cells. The impact of many therapies
  on signalling in drug-resistant cells is depicted in this picture. (A) When targeting
  a single signalling pathway, such as PGFR signalling, cancer cells become resistant
  to PDGFR inhibitors (such as CHMFL-PDGFR-159) by activating compensatory signalling
  pathways of alternative RTKs (e.g., FGFR or VEGFR) leading to cell survival and
  migration. (B) However, resistance and signalling reactivation can be overcome by
  combination therapy and multi-target kinase inhibitors that target multiple signalling
  pathways leading to effective inhibition of cancer progression and drug resistance.
