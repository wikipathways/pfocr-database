caption: 'Glutathione synthesis and degradation pathways in Arabidopsis. Arrows indicate
  metabolic fluxes and inter-compartment transport. Metabolites are in black, and
  enzymes in blue. Known transporters are circled. A question mark indicates that
  experimental evidence is incomplete. GSH is synthesized in the chloroplast by the
  enzymes GSH1 and GSH2 from Glu, Cys and Gly. The reaction catalyzed by GSH2 also
  occurs in the cytosol. Degradation of GSH is catalyzed by the enzymes GGCT, AtLAP1
  and 5-OPase in the cytosol. This sequence of reactions recycles the amino acids
  used in GSH synthesis. Degradation of GSSG occurs in the apoplast by GGT1, GGT2
  and a dipeptidase still uncharacterized. This pathway also recycles Glu, Cys and
  Gly, which can be taken up by the cell and serve in GSH re-synthesis. GGT4 catalyzes
  the partial degradation of the glutathione moiety of GS conjugates in the vacuole.
  GSH pools are also present in mitochondria, ER and peroxisomes (not represented
  in the figure). The heatmap recapitulates the main regulatory features discussed
  in the text (regulation at the gene and enzyme levels). Green: positive effect;
  grey: no effect or not discussed. MeJa, methyl jasmonate.'
