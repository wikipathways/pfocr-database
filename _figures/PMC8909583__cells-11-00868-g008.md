caption: The RYR2 channel provides a novel pathway for rapid Zn2+ transport in cardiomyocytes.
  Schematic illustrating three pathways (one novel) for Zn2+ transport across the
  cardiac SR membrane. Two Zn2+ transporter protein families, ZIP and ZnT, play an
  essential role in cardiac Zn2+ homeostasis and mediate a slow-rate transport. In
  the heart, Zn2+ release through the RYR2 channel, accompanying a robust Ca2+ release
  triggered by small Ca2+ entry through the L-type Ca2+ channel, could also contribute
  to global and/or local Zn2+signaling which requires a fast-rate transport. At the
  local scale, the Zn2+ current flowing through the RYR2 channel might target its
  intrinsic Zn2+ finger situated within the C-terminal tail of all four RYR2 subunits.
  In addition, the RYR2 channel (colored gray) might be stimulated by Zn2+ cations
  emanating from the neighboring RYR2 channel (colored white). Arrows indicate the
  direction of Zn2+ (red) and Ca2+ (black) mobilization.
