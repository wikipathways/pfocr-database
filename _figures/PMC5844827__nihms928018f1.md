caption: Sendai virus infects murine airway ciliated epithelial cells, leading to
  accumulation of CD49d expressing neutrophils (PMN) in a CysLTR1 dependent fashion.
  Through CD11b and an unknown ligand, these cells interact with lung conventional
  dendritic cells (cDC) driving expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)
  on cDC. At the same time, anti-SeV IgE (Antiviral IgE) is made; crosslinking of
  FcεRI on the cDC leads to production of the chemokine CCL28, which recruits IL-13
  producing lymphocytes to the airways. IL-13 drives development of mucous cell metaplasia
  and airway hyperreactivity. As shown on the right side of the figure, intranasal
  exposure to an innocuous environmental antigen (shown as peanut or pollen) during
  the antiviral immune response in mice results in IgE production against that antigen.
