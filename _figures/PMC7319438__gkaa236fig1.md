caption: 'Overview of SPEED2 application We manually selected pathway-specific perturbation
  experiments and estimated their pathway-relevance. For each experiment z-scores
  are mapped on a scale between –1 and 1 (Zrank) and significance was asserted per
  gene and pathway by testing the Zranks against a uniform null model (p) and corrected
  for multiple testing (q). These pathway-specific significance measures (along with
  their regulation direction) are now used to evaluate a user-provided gene list for
  two aspects: (i) testing for pathway enrichment by deviation from the uniform mean
  (Bates test) or uniform variance (χ2 var test) on P-rank ordered continuous pathway
  signatures and (ii) filtering the list of genes for pathway-representatives ranked
  by q-value (see main text). The first result gives indications of upstream signalling
  that might have caused the gene expression change and the second result provides
  candidate genes to e.g. carry out follow up investigations. We illustrate these
  SPEED2 outputs on a well defined MAPK target list from Uhlitz et al. ().'
