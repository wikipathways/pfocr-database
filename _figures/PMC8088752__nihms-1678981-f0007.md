caption: 'Signals from various cellular stresses, some listed in the Figure, activate,
  in a stress type-specific manner, one or more members of the family of eIF2α kinases:
  PKR, GCN2, PERK, and HRI. In a number of cases, signaling pathways leading to kinase
  activation have been elucidated and are described in text. The detailed pathway
  for heme-independent HRI activation shown in the Figure depicts mitochondrial stress-induced
  depolarization activating mitochondrial protease OMA1, which cleaves DELE1 inside
  of the organelle. One of DELE1 fragments is then released to the cytosol where it
  binds to and activates HRI. Full activation requires autophosphorylation and dimerization
  of the kinases. Activated kinases converge on phosphorylation of eIF2α at serene
  51; this is the “integrating” event and the core of the integrated stress response
  pathway. eIF2α phosphorylation results in severe global attenuation of cap-dependent
  translation and also in concomitant initiation of the preferential translation of
  ISR-specific mRNAs, many encoding transcription factors. Some of these transcription
  factors, and/or products of genes activated by them, act as inducible components
  of the RdRp complex; their availability allows assembly of the complex and thus
  the activation of the mammalian RNA-dependent mRNA amplification process. Termination
  of the ISR is regulated by the constitutively expressed CReP and stress-inducible
  phosphatase GADD34 that, in conjunction with PP1 phosphatase, dephosphorylate eIF2α.'
