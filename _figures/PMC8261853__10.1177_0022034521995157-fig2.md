caption: Cellular targets of host modulation agents in periodontitis. Conventional
  synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are currently
  being prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Biological DMARDs inhibit
  the expression of key proinflammatory markers in periodontitis, such as IL-17 and
  IL-6, and suppress the proliferation of CD4+ T cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal
  antibody targeting CD20 that results in the depletion of B cells. Bisphosphonates
  disrupt osteoclastic activity, inhibit bone degradation, and promote osteoblastic
  activity. Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) regulate fatty acid
  metabolites of inflammatory cells, suppress proinflammatory gene expression by inhibiting
  proinflammatory pathways, and decrease the production of inflammatory mediators.
  n-3 PUFAs are the substrates for the generation of specialized proresolving lipid
  mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, maresins, and protectins, which orchestrate
  the active resolution of inflammation. Statins exert their anti-inflammatory and
  bone-preserving actions by modulating the ERK, MAPK, PI3-Akt, and NF-κB pathways.
  They also induce the upregulation of SPMs, namely 15-epi-LXA4 and 13-series resolvins,
  via the LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymatic pathways, respectively, especially when combined
  with aspirin. Complement inhibitors such as Cp40 suppress osteoclastogenesis and
  bone loss and decrease IL-17 and the RANKL/OPG ratio in nonhuman primates. Probiotics
  reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway
  and promote the accumulation of Tregs by inhibiting histone deacetylases. SPMs downregulate
  cytokines/chemokines and promote bone regeneration. D-resolvins antagonize IL-17,
  induce the expression of the endothelial anti-inflammatory marker Del-1 through
  the GSK-3b-C/EBPb pathway, and decrease CD4+ cells. SPMs restore viability, proliferation,
  and migration of human PDLSCs and enhance differentiation of cementoblasts/osteoblasts.
  IL, interleukin; PDLSC, periodontal ligament stem cell.
