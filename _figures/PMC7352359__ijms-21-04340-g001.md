caption: A current model of BR signaling. When BRs (brassinosteroids) are absent (left),
  BRI1 (Brassinosteroid-Insensitive1) is kept inactive by its autoinhibitory C-terminus
  and BKI1 (BRI1 Kinase Inhibitor1) association. BIN2 (Brassinosteroid-Insensitive2)
  is constitutively active and phosphorylates BES1 (bri1-EMS suppressor1)/BZR1 (Brassinazole-resistant1)
  transcription factors to promote their degradation and 14-3-3-mediated cytosolic
  retention, and to directly inhibit their DNA-binding activities. When BRs are present
  (right) and bind to the extracellular domains of BRI1 and its co-receptor BAK1 (BRI1
  Associated receptor Kinase1) to activate the two receptor kinases, leading to dissociation
  of BKI1 from BRI1, phosphorylation and activation of BSKs (BR-signaling kinases)/CDGs
  (Constitutive Differential Growth) and BSU1 (bri1 suppressor1). The activated BSU1
  dephosphorylates and inactivates BIN2 while KIB1 (Kink suppressed in bzr1-1D1) promotes
  BIN2 degradation, causing nuclear accumulation of PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A)-dephosphorylated
  BES1/BZR1 that bind BRRE (BR response element)/E-box-containing promoters to regulate
  expression of thousands of BR-responsive genes important for plant growth and development.
