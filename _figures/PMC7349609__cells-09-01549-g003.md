caption: 'Model for the major events in the Notch signaling pathway: Signals initiated
  by the engagement of the ligand lead to metalloprotease (MP) cleavage at site S2.
  γ-Secretase complex cleaves Notch1 at the S3 site within the transmembrane domain.
  Intracellular Notch (NICD) is released from the membrane, translocates to the nucleus,
  and forms a complex with CSL and MAM.'
