caption: The hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway showing hh ligands (Shh, Dhh, Ihh) and
  their receptor Ptch 1. Upon binding with Ptch1, the pathway causes internalization,
  and Smo inhibition is released. After this, Smo is phosphorylated causing a cascade
  activation through downstream regulation, and Gli1/2 is processed into the activator
  forms GliA and GliB. After translocation of GliA into the nucleus, it stimulates
  target gene expression. The transcriptional repressor precursor Gli3 remains inactive.
