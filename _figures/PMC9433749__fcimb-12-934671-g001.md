caption: 'Protective versus pathogenic T cell immunity to Gram-negative bacteria.
  Left panel: Upon infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), antigen presenting cells
  (APC) recognize and present pathogenic peptides to T cell subsets in local lymph
  nodes. APC release polarizing cytokines (e.g., IL-23) that activate TH17 and γδ
  T cells. These T cell subsets produce IL-17 and stimulate airway epithelial cells
  (AEC) to express chemokines (e.g., CXCL1) that mediate neutrophil recruitment to
  the infection site. Activated neutrophils phagocytose and kill bacteria, therefore
  enhancing Kp clearance and resolution of local inflammation. IL-22 serves a protective
  role by promoting AEC repair. Right panel: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-derived toxin
  activates the amphiregulin (Areg) – Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor pathway
  to induce a type 2 inflammatory response and increase mucus production, enhancing
  pathogen survival. Deviation of the immune response toward pathogenic expansion
  of TH2 immunity, creates a favorable niche for PA colonization and chronic infection.
  Chronic PA exposure can result in increased TH17 cell activation, persistent neutrophil
  recruitment, and lung tissue damage (not shown).'
