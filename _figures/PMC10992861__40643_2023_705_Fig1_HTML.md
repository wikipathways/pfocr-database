caption: Currently known seven natural autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways. The respective
  carbon fixing enzymes (red) and ATP demand are depicted. Aerobic pathways (mint)
  include the CBB cycle, 3HP/4 HB cycle and 3HPA bicycle. The WL pathway, rGly pathway,
  rTCA cycle and DC/HB cycle are anaerobic pathways (orange). (modified after Shi
  et al. )
