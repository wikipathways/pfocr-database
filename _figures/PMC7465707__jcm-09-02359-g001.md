caption: 'Synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial cells. NO is released by the
  action of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) on its substrate, L-arginine. For this
  reaction, several cofactors, such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), oxygen (O2), and
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) are required. eNOS is activated
  by calcium-dependent and -independent pathways. Intracellular Ca is increased as
  a response to the function of NO agonists (including acetylcholine (Ach), bradykinin
  (BK), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin,
  thrombin, and histamine) or by influx into the endothelial cell following the opening
  of the store-operated calcium channel (SOC) and other calcium permeable channels
  in the plasma membrane. Ca binds to calmodulin, and this complex dissociates eNOS
  from the inhibitor caveolin-1, located in the caveolae. eNOS can also be activated
  by the calcium-independent pathway of post-translational phosphorylation, which
  is triggered as a response to shear stress and the function of growth factors and
  hormones. After NO is generated, it diffuses across the membrane of smooth muscle
  cells and activates the guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes the reaction from
  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate (cGMP). The effect of this reaction is the transportation of calcium
  out of the cell, which downregulates the activity of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK),
  causing relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cell. Abbreviations: Ach, acetylcholine;
