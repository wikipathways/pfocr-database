caption: Reconstruction of the metabolic pathway associated with VFAs formation and
  arginine biosynthesis between warm and cold seasons. The red KO in parentheses indicates
  enrichment in cold season yaks. The metabolic pathway for VFAs formation is referenced
  from Zhang et al. (2016). The metabolic pathway for arginine biosynthesis is referenced
  from Guo et al. (2021)
