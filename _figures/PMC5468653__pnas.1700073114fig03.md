caption: 'Prolific nicotine production in the genus Nicotiana evolved from stepwise
  duplications of two primary metabolic pathways. (A) Metabolic organization (brightly
  colored and dashed line outlined branches) and evolution of Nicotiana-specific nicotine
  biosynthesis via pathway and single gene duplications. Light green and light blue
  branches on the side indicate the two ancient gene modules with housekeeping functions
  in plants for the biosynthesis of the NAD cofactor and metabolism of polyamines.
  Different gene duplication types are indicated by arrows, annotated as follows:
  NSD, Nicotiana-specific duplications; WGT, whole-genome triplication in Solanaceae;
  pWGT, gene duplication occurring before WGT. Phylogenetic analyses are presented
  in . Nicotiana QS (quinolinate synthase) and A622 did not duplicate but experienced
  an increase in root expression compared with their tomato homologs (). (B) Phylogenomic
  analysis of grape, tomato, and N. attenuata gene sets highlighting the gradual assembly
  of the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. Duplication patterns of ODC, PMT, and MPO
  support the ancient origin of the ornithine-derived N-methyl-Δ1-pyrrolinium, which
  is notably used as a building block for the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids in
  Solanum. AO, aspartate oxidase; BBL, berberine bridge enzyme-like; DAO, diamine
  oxidase; MPO, N-methylputrescine oxidase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; PMT, putrescine
  methyltransferase; SPDS, spermidine synthase.'
