caption: Probiotic bacteria products blocking ACE2 receptors may attenuate COVID-19
  infection. Immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Virus invasion is carried out through
  ACE2 receptor and viral protein S (Spike S glycoprotein) is activated by TMPRSS2
  leading to the proinflammatory cytokine cascade. The massive release of cytokines
  (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IFNγ, TNFα, IP10, etc.) from innate immune cells induces
  the activation of NF-kΒ signaling pathway that regulates the transcription of NLRP3
  inflammasome-related components as well as pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. As soon as it
  is formed, NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-caspase-1 and converts it into its active
  form, caspase-1 [,,]. Subsequently, caspase-1 proceeds with the cleavage of inactive
  precursors pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their mature forms IL-1β and IL-18 respectively;
  at the same time GSDMD is cleaved by the same protease in two domains, an N-terminal
  and a C-terminal. Following the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD assembles pores in
  the plasma membrane, inducing pyroptosis and cell death []. Experimental studies
  have shown that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry could be potentially prevented through the
  antagonistic effect of specific probiotic strains. PB, except for their ability
  to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens in the intestinal epithelium, compete with
  pathogens for nutrients and produce antimicrobial substances (e.g., bacteriocins),
  providing immunomodulatory action and enhancing epithelial barrier function [].
  Their anti-inflammatory effect suppresses cytokine production. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2
  evokes inflammation by infecting host cells through the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2
  inducing proinflammatory cytokine release. Lactobacillus plantarum metabolic product
  (Plantaricin) blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by binding with ACE2 [,,,,]. Parts
