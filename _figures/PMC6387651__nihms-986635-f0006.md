caption: (A) In normal liver, LSECs express high levels of ALK1 receptors, favoring
  TGFβ/ALK1 signaling, which shifts signaling away from the TGFβ/ALK5 pathway and
  thereby downregulates TSP-1 gene expression. Furthermore, LSECs in normal liver
  shed HB-EGF from the cytosolic membrane, which maintains HSC quiescence. (B) In
  fibrotic liver, increased levels of TGFβ and lower expression of the ALK1 receptor
  favor TGFβ/ALK5 signaling in BM-derived LSECs, resulting in increased TSP-1 expression.
  TSP-1 binds to CD47 and CD36, which inhibits both sGC and cGMP-dependent protein
  kinase I (cGKI), as well nitric oxide synthase activation. ADAMTS13 is also upregulated
  and inhibits the NO pathway by binding to CD36. The consequent downregulation of
  the NO pathway by TSP-1 and ADAMTS13 prevents maturation of BM-derived LSECs, manifested
  by lack of fenestration and downregulation of key HB-EGF sheddases. Inability to
  release HB-EGF permits HSC activation.
