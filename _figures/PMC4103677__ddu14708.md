caption: Schematic diagram of proposed heparanase 2 function in FGF signalling and
  motor neuron development. (A) In normal development, heparanase 2 inhibits the activity
  of heparanase 1, both biochemically by sequestering HSPGs () and possibly transcriptionally
  (this study). This inhibition maintains normal levels of FGF signalling and downstream
  genes within the embryo, allowing correct motor neuron functional development. (B)
  Loss of heparanase 2 causes upregulation of FGF signalling (and subsequent deregulation
  of downstream pathway components), perturbing expression of genes required for motor
  neuron development.
