caption: The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (reduced); R-5-p I, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; R-5-p Epimerase, ribulose-5-phosphate
  epimerase. O1-O10 represent each metabolite of the OPP pathway and the number before
  the red arrows indicate the number of papers that report an increase in abundance,
  the number before the green arrows indicates the number of papers that report a
  decrease in abundance and the number before the black dashes indicates the number
  of papers that report no change in abundance.
