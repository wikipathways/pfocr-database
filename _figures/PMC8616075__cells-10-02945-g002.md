caption: 'Metabolism of energetic substrates in kidney cells. The basal and insulin-dependent
  glucose uptake into kidney cells is mediated by the Glucose Transporters (GLUT)
  1 and 4. Free fatty acids (FA) enters kidney cells by a route supported by the protein
  CD36, FA transport proteins (FATPs) [], and FA binding proteins (FABPs) []. FA uptake
  by kidney cells is not hormonally regulated and driven by their circulating availability.
  Glucose follows multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogen synthesis
  (glycogenogenesis), polyol pathway (with sorbitol and fructose formation), conversion
  to either diacylglycerol (DAG) to activate protein kinases or to dicarbonyls (i.e.,
  methylglyoxal) to form advanced glycation end products (AGE), and is shuttled into
  the hexosamine biosynthetic or pentose phosphate pathways. Pyruvate is either converted
  to lactate (aerobic glycolysis []) or transported into mitochondria via a mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier to be converted by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to acetyl-CoA (AcCoA)
  for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. For simplicity, extramitochondrial glucose
  fluxes are not shown in detail. After entry into the cell, long chain FAs are activated
  to FA-CoA that is either esterified as triacylglycerol (stored in the cytosol, not
  shown) or enter the mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT1 and 2)
  to be oxidized. The end products of each FA β-oxidation cycle are NADH, FADH2, and
  acetyl-CoA, which are further oxidized by the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes
  or TCA, respectively, ultimately leading to ATP synthesis via mitochondrial oxidative
  phosphorylation. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is the main ATP provider.
  While electrons are transferred from the reducing equivalents, NADH and FADH2, to
  oxygen by the ETC complexes, an electrochemical gradient is built across the mitochondrial
  inner membrane (IM), which is used by the ATP synthase (complex V) to form ATP.
