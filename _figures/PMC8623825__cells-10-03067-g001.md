caption: 'Cellular sources of ROS in respiratory viral infections. Activation of receptors
  liganded by RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 envelope proteins and the recognition
  of viral PAMPs by intracellular sensors (NLRs, TLRs) trigger signaling pathways,
  leading to activation of oxidoreductases located in cell membranes, endoplasmic
  reticulum, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are the primary
  enzyme complexes in nearly all cell types, particularly in granulocytes and macrophages,
  along with oxidoreductases in mitochondrial complex I and II, which partially oxidize
  oxygen molecules to generate superoxide anion (O2•−). O2•− via Fenton and/or Haber-Weiss
  reactions are converted into hydroxyl radical (•OH). The highly reactive •OH reacts
  with proteins, lipids and DNA. ROS themselves, but particularly peroxidation of
  polyunsaturated fatty acids, trigger nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which heterodimerizes with small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma
  (MAF) transcription factor and binds the cis-acting enhancer antioxidant response
  element (ARE), leading to the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including Cu/Zn-superoxide
  dismutase (SOD1), glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and catalase (CAT). However, in
  RSV and SARS-CoV-2infected cells and lungs there is a progressive decrease in levels
  of NRF2 via increased protein ubiquitination and its degradation through a proteasomal
  pathway [,,,]. Although ROS generation in RSV, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells is similar,
  it seems that NRF2 primarily modifies influenza A entry and replication []. In addition
  to the above-described pathways, activated monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells,
  in particular, neutrophils, have been shown to produce ROS. Abbreviations: NLR,
  nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors; TLR, TOLL-like receptors,
  PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; NOX, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) oxidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
