caption: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/pAkt-kinase pathway as a central CCL5/CCR5
  signalling cascade in cancer cells. Upon CCL5 binding to its cognate receptor CCR5,
  primarily the PI3K/Akt pathway is triggered. This favours the phosphorylation of
  PIP2 to PIP3, a secondary messenger responsible for the activation of the Akt kinase,
  which in turn phosphorylates several downstream effectors. This causes the inhibition
  of pro-apoptotic effectors and the upregulation of survival genes. Another target
  of PI3K is the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which also activates
  the Akt kinase. However, it has also been shown that a secondary intracellular target,
  Focal Adhesion kinase (FAK) binding-SRC kinase complex can be activated, resulting
  in additional PI3K activation (in prostate cancer).
