caption: 'Signal transduction pathways for the Al+ADAl3–4 vs. Al–CK comparison. (A,B)
  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway (ko04146,
  (A)) and plant hormone signal transduction pathway (ko04075, (B)). The circles and
  frames with a red background, upregulated genes; with a green background, downregulated
  genes; and with a blue background, both up- and downregulated genes in the same
  family. The overlapping part of the two pathways are enclosed by both red and green
  frames. (C) RT–qPCR validation of the indicated genes. There are three technical
  replicates per experiment, and three independent experiments per sample. * p < 0.05;
  ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. Student’s t-test. Abbreviations: FLS2, Flagellin Sensitive
