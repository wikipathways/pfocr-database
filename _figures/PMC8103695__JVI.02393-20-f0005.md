caption: Schematic summary of the pathway induced by the GSK-3i tideglusib, leading
  to activation of AKT/mTOR signaling. All phosphorylation events reported here were
  experimentally confirmed by NanoString analysis or whole-cell phosphoproteomics.
  Solid arrows/lines indicate interaction previously reported in the literature; dotted
  arrows/lines represent proposed interactions. Green arrows/lines indicate activation;
  red arrows/lines indicate inhibition (note that in many circumstances, a negative
  regulatory phosphorylation blocks the inhibitory effect of a protein, leading to
  activation). The indicated phosphorylation sites represent activating (green) or
  inhibitory (red) phosphorylation events.
