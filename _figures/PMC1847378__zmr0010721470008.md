caption: 'Possible biosynthetic pathway for phospholipids in archaea compared with
  their bacterial counterpart. Enzymes confirmed by in vitro experiments are as follows:
  1, G-1-P dehydrogenase; 2, GGGP synthase; 3, DGGGP synthase; 4, CDP-archaeol synthase;
  5, archaetidylserine synthase. Reactions and enzymes 6 to 9 are indicated by in
  vivo experiments or database searches of the relevant genes. 6, archaetidylserine
  decarboxylase; 7, archaetidylinositol synthase; 8, archaetidylglycerophosphate synthase;
  9, archaetidylglycerophosphate phosphatase. The established enzymes for phospholipid
  biosynthesis in bacteria are as follows; 1′, G-3-P dehydrogenase; 2′, lysophosphatidic
  acid synthase; 3′, phosphatidic acid synthase; 4′, CDP-diacylglycerol synthase;
  5′, phosphatidylserine synthase; 6′, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; 7′, phosphatidylinositol
  synthase; 8′, phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase; 9′, phosphatidylglycerophosphate
  phosphatase. P and PP in the structural formula are phosphate and pyrophosphate,
  respectively.'
