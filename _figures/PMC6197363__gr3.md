caption: 'A: Scheme of the ventricular tachycardia (VT) circuit and pacing site. B:
  Concealed entrainment was obtained by pacing with a pacing cycle length (PCL) of
  325 ms. Propagation conducted through slow pathway 1 (SP1). C: The wavefront propagated
  through slow pathway 2 (SP2) by pacing with a PCL of 320 ms during VT. The SP1 refractory
  period might be shorter than that of SP2, although the conduction time in SP2 was
  longer than that in SP1. The exit site distal to both SP1 and SP2 was considered
  the same site. D: Termination with nonglobal capture with conduction block of SP2
  repeatedly occurred by continuous pacing with a PCL of 320 ms. S-QRS = stimulus
  to the QRS complex.'
