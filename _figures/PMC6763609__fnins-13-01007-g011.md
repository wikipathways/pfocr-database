caption: DEGs are potentially related to Alzheimer’s relevant pathways and functions.
  (Top) IPA pathway analysis of DEGs in the Aβ42 vs. H9 comparison identified “decreased
  memory” (z = –2.213) and “increased neuronal cell death” (z = 1.658) as the lowest
  and highest scoring functional pathways. Individual genes are shown as graphic symbols
  representing molecule type and color coded by FC values (red = UP, green = DN).
  (Bottom) The most relevant IPA disease-related canonical pathway was “Neuroprotective
  role of THOP1 in Alzheimer’s disease” (p = 9.95E–03, overlap = 2 of 40 total genes
  in this pathway). The pathway genes were MME (aka NEP, neprilysin) an Aβ degrading
  metalloproteinase and SERPINA3 (aka ACT, alpha-1 antitrypsin) a protease inhibitor
  found in AD plaques (Top, circled in blue). MME is not directly included in the
  IPA “decreased memory” function but could potentially be related through its relationship
  to GRP.
