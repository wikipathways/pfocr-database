caption: 'The mechanism of Sirtuins in the occurrence and development of obesity.
  A Downregulation of SIRT7, which promotes SIRT1 autoactivation. ERα induces SIRT1
  expression, SIRT1 deacetylation, ATK and STAT3 activation, and inhibits adipogenesis
  via the mTOR-ULK1 and p55 cascades. SIRT6 deficiency can activate insulin signaling,
  promote Akt phosphorylation, promote BAT and muscle glucose uptake, and promote
  FoxO1 phosphorylation, reduce ATGL synthesis and reduce TG hydrolysis efficiency.
  SIRT3 promotes ATP production in mitochondria through deacetylation of proteins
  in the electron transport chain complex. B EA promotes PPARγ deacetylation, regulates
  PGC-1α-TFAM-UCP1, and remodels WAT into BAT. Berberine regulates PPARγ deacetylation
  through AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. C Multiple adipokines, such as APN and LP, that can
  be derived from adipocytes. SIRT1 can regulate the expression and secretion of adiponectin
  in adipocytes. Overexpression of SIRT1 in the hypothalamus can increase sensitivity
  to LP and inhibit weight gain. SIRT1 and APN decreased with increasing total and
  trunk fat mass, whereas the opposite was true for leptin. Abbreviation: ERα, estrogen
  receptor α; AceCS2, acetylase a synthetase 2; ATGL, triglyceride lipase; BAT, brown
  adipose tissue; EA, electroacupuncture; APN, adiponectin; LP, leptin'
