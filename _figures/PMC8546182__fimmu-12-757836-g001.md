caption: Metabolic Targets of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease. The conditioning regimen
  mediates tissue damage releasing PAMPs and DAMPs, these prime APCs to activate T
  cells. Alloreactive T cells expand and differentiate into inflammatory Th1, Th17
  and CTLs. Alloreactive T cells contribute to the inflammatory milieu through secretion
  of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-a. These activated alloreactive donor T cells can be recruited
  to target organs including the skin, GI tract and liver to mediate the inflammatory
  phenotype characteristic of aGVHD. Indicated in blue are metabolic targets for the
  treatment of aGVHD. Trimethylamine (TMA) lyase inhibitor prevents the polarization
  of macrophages into M1 cells. Inhibitors against the nicotinamide phosphoribosyl
  transferase pathway (Fk866), lactate dehydrogenase (NCI-737), sirtuin-1 (Ex-527),
  lysosomal lipase (orlistat), fatty acid oxidation (etomoxir); along with activators
  of 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (metformin) and nuclear factor 2 (sulforaphane)
  may or have been shown to target allo-reactive T cell function in aGVHD. NaHCO3
  has been shown to abrogate lactate accumulation in allo-reactive T cells. Inhibitors
  of fatty acid synthesis (FAS) (5-(Tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), Soraphen
  A), reactive oxygen species (NecroX-7), and glutamine administration improve the
  suppressive function and increase Tregs aiding to alleviate aGVHD. Lastly, GSK3β
  inhibitor (SB216763) has been shown to enhance regulatory B cells (Bregs) differentiation
  and suppressive function and may be a therapeutic target in aGVHD. Indicated in
  red are metabolites that have been shown to accumulate during aGVHD, these include
  succinate in IECs due to reduced SDHA activity, and lactate and acylcarnitines in
  allo-reactive T cells. Indicated in purple are microbial metabolites that act on
  cells during aGVHD, these include short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), long chain fatty
  acids (LCFAs), indoles and polyamines which can act on immune (macrophages, T cells,
  Tregs) and non-immune (IECs) cells. Created with BioRender.com.
