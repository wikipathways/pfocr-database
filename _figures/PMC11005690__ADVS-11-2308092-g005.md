  a1) Antioxidant by activating the Nrf2/HO‐1 pathway, a2) Anti‐inflammatory by activating
  the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibiting several key pathways including p38/ERK MAPK,
  p65 NF‐κB, JAK‐STAT3, and HIF‐1‐induced glycolysis, b) Mucosal barrier repair by
  protecting IECs from oxidative apoptosis, promoting IECs proliferation via the RAS/MAPK/AP‐1
  pathway, and increasing TJPs expression; c) Modulate the gut microbiota by eliminating
  pathogens and increasing the richness and diversity of the gut microbiome.
