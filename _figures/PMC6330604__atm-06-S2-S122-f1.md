caption: 'DSBR pathways and the effect of RAD51 paralog loss on pathway choice. (A)
  Schematic of homologous recombination. Double strand breaks are detected by the
  sensor protein MDC1, which recruits the ATM dimer. ATM autophosphorylates, becomes
  a monomer and then phosphorylates H2A.X, which serves as a recruitment signal for
  additional complexes including exonucleases. Exonucleases resect the broken ends
  in a 5'' to 3'' direction to generate 3'' overhanging ssDNA fibres, which are then
  coated with RPA. BRCA2 loads RAD51 onto the fibres by exchanging it with RPA. The
  RAD51-ssDNA fibres are remodelled and stabilized by RAD51 paralogs, and filaments
  are engaged in homology searching the genome. RAD51 catalyses the annealing of the
  ssDNA fibres to their homologous template for resynthesis. The junction structure
  is then resolved and ligated to generate intact duplex. (B) Schematic of alternative
  DSBR mechanisms: (i) alt-NHEJ. Binding of the KU70/80 heterodimer to the break recruits
  DNA-PK or PARP-1 and their associated end processing factors. Once 3'' hydroxyl
  and 5'' phosphate termini are restored ends are blunt-ligated; (ii) SSA. Regions
  of microhomology between ssDNA fibres are annealed, generating 3'' overhanging flaps.
  These are cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases and the remaining gaps are
  filled and ligated; (iii) SDSA. Single strand invasion occurs as in HR, but only
  one end of a break aligns with a homologous template for polymerase extension. The
  newly synthesized DNA is then melted from its template and annealed to the existing
  3'' ssDNA overhang on the other break end; (iv) effect of RAD51 loading defects
  on pathway choice. RAD51 paralog or BRCA2 deficiency lead to instability or loss
  of RAD51 ssDNA fibres. Without RAD51 fibres HR cannot be completed and alternative
  error prone repair mechanisms are engaged. In these circumstances PARP-dependent
  alt-NHEJ is a critical repair mechanism. Chemical inhibition of PARP causes an overuse
  of classical DNA-PK driven NHEJ with subsequent cytotoxic deletions and chromosome
  structural aberrations. NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; ssDNA, single-stranded
  DNA; SSBR, single strand break repair; DSBR, double strand break repair; RPA, replication
  protein A; SSA, single strand annealing; SDSA, synthesis dependent strand annealing;
  HR, homologous recombination; DDR, DNA damage repair.'
