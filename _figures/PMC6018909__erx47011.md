caption: A model that illustrates how CSLD3 acts downstream of the ethylene-response
  pathway in root hairs and during cell elongation in Arabidopsis. CSLD3 controls
  root-hair growth and root elongation, probably through cellulose biosynthesis and
  cell wall formation. The model highlights that CSLD3-mediated root elongation is
  sensitive to ethylene treatment, in particular under phosphate starvation, but that
  CSLD3-mediated hypocotyl elongation proceeds largely independently of ethylene signaling.
  The model also assumes a co-ordinated effort between CSLD3 and root hair-specific
  expansin genes. Arrows indicate positive regulation; lines ending in bars indicate
  negative action; solid lines indicate that the effects are experimentally supported;
  dashed lines indicate hypothetical links. (This figure is available in colour at
  JXB online.)
