caption: 'Schematic depiction of how complement modulates T-cell immunity. Cognate
  T-cell–APC interactions result in the upregulation and release of alternative pathway
  complement components by both partners and in the downregulation of (a) cell-surface
  DAF, which permits local complement activation resulting in the production of (b)
  C3a and C5a. These split products bind to their G-protein-coupled receptors expressed
  on T cells, signaling through PI3Kγ and AKT to induce proliferation and inhibit
  apoptosis, while simultaneously activating APCs to upregulate B7 and innate cytokine
  (for example, IL-12) production. APC, antigen presenting cell; DAF, decay-accelerating
  factor; IL-12, interleukin-12; PI3Kγ, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase-γ.Reproduced with
