caption: Model for RIM101-dependent and RIM101-independent control of alkaline responses.
  Alkaline pH stimulates Rim101p activity through increased expression and proteolytic
  activation, both of which require Rim8p and Rim20p. Full-length Rim101p-long does
  not have a known activity. Processed Rim101p-short is required for the alkaline
  response, which includes activation of alkaline-induced genes, repression of alkaline-repressed
  genes, and filamentation. Since RIM101 is an alkaline-induced gene, its expression
  may depend on autoregulation by Rim101p-short. Alkaline pH also stimulates a RIM101-independent
  pathway. (We have diagrammed one RIM101-independent pathway for simplicity, but
  there may be several.) This pathway activates PHR2 expression (in the absence of
  a functional RIM101 pathway) and stimulates filamentation in conjunction with Rim101p.
