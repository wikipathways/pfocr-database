caption: 'HGF/c-Met signaling cascades.Notes: Upon binding of HGF to its receptor
  c-Met, c-Met is dimerized and activated by phosphorylation of Tyr 1234 and Tyr 1235
  residues. The other two tyrosines (Tyr 1349 and Tyr 1356) in the C-terminal tail
  are also phosphorylated, providing a docking site for multiple substrates of downstream
  signal cascades such as GAB1 and GRB2. The activated HGF/c-Met signaling pathway
  regulates diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation,
  migration, invasion, and survival.Abbreviations: GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2; GAB1, GRB2-associated binding protein 1; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3.'
