caption: Assembly of mature α4β2 nAChRs from a precursor pool of individual subunits
  can be upregulated by nicotine, possibly acting as a chaperone to increase α4+β2
  subunit association and subcellular transport. The mechanisms through which choline
  and TNFα influence this process is to ultimately increase β2 subunit production
  (favoring pentameric α4+β2 assembly) through a p38MAPK mechanism that is inhibited
  by SB202190. The activity of p38MAPK is balanced by constitutive inhibition by PI3kβ
  (inhibited by PI828) and promoted by an increase in Jak2 kinase activity (inhibited
  by AG490). Jak2 activation is stimulated by choline acting through a choline kinase
  (CK) pathway that is distinguished by hemicholinium3-sensitivity (HC3) pathway or
  signaling by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) acting
  through its receptor, TNFR1. The choline mediated upregulation mechanism through
  the HC3-insensitve pathway (CK-, in light grey) is not yet characterized but also
  produces upregulation through increased β2 production.
