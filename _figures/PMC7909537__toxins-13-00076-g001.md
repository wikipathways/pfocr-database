caption: Simplified ergovaline pathway showing pathway intermediates and the key genes
  proposed for each biosynthetic step. DMAPP = dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, DMAT =
  dimethylallyl tryptophan. Underlined genes were deleted in this study. Ergovaline
  (boxed) is a mammalian toxin with bioactivity towards black beetle. A comprehensive
  review of this pathway is reported in Young et al., 2015 [].
