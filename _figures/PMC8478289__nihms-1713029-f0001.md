caption: When the Hippo pathway is “on”, YAP1 is phosphorylated and retained in the
  cytoplasm or degraded. When the Hippo pathway is “off,” YAP1 translocates into the
  nucleus where it serves as a transcription co-regulator of TEA-Domain (TEAD), induces
  the expression of genes such as Survivin, Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF),
  Jagged Canonical Notch Ligand 1 (JAG1), and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61
  (CYR61), thus promoting the migration and proliferation of cancer cells.
