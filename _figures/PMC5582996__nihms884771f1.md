caption: (A) In flies, Ft binds to Ds, and the strength of this interaction is regulated
  by phosphorylation by the Golgi kinase Fj. Ft binds intracellularly to Discs overgrown
  (Dco), Lowfat, Fbxl7, Dlish/Vamana and Atrophin (Atro) and its activity is regulated
  by Approximated (App). Ft/Ds interactions lead to asymmetric distribution of the
  myosin Dachs, activation of the Hippo pathway and consequently the control of proliferation
  and tissue polarity. There is no known ligand for Fat-like. However, it signals
  through binding to the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) to promote cytoskeleton rearrangements.
  (B) In flies, the Ft/Ds system is activated along a gradient, extending along the
  proximal (Px)-distal (Dt) axis of the wing or from the poles (Pl) to the equator
  (Eq) of the eye. Ft is uniformly expressed, with Ds and Fj in opposing gradients.
  The resulting gradient of Ft activity results in asymmetric localization of Dachs
  (D) and hence polarized alignment of cells along this gradient. (C) In vertebrates,
  the Ft ortholog Fat4 binds to the Ds ortholog Dchs1. Intracellularly, Fat4 binds
  to the MUPP1-Pals1 complex, and possibly to Atrophin1 and Atrophin 2L (Atn1/2L).
  Fat2 mediates homophilic interactions, whereas the ligands for Fat1 and Fat3 remain
  to be elucidated. Fat1 binds to a variety of intracellular molecules, including
  cytoskeletal regulators such as Ena/VASP, Homer1 and Homer3, and probably WRC, as
  well as the Atn transcriptional regulators. Fat3 binds to WRC and Ena/VASP. How
  any of these interactions actually influence polarity remains unclear.
