caption: Signalling cascades following activation of a G-protein coupled receptor
  (GPCR). Biogenic amine receptors are activated after binding of the respective ligand.
  The activated GPCR in turn can activate a stimulatory G-protein (Gs) and thus initiate
  a cAMP signalling pathway (A) or it can activate a G-protein of the Gq/o family
  (Gq/o), which couples the amine receptor to IP3/DAG signalling pathways (B).A. The
  activated G-protein stimulates an adenylyl cyclase (AC), which catalyses the production
  of cAMP from ATP. The increasing intracellular concentration of cAMP activates cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA). This kinase can phosphorylate a number of target proteins
  on serine and threonine residues.B. Members of the Gq/o-protein-family activate
  phospholipase C (PLC). This enzyme hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to specific
  receptors (IP3-R), which form ligand-gated ion channels in the membrane of the endoplasmatic
  reticulum. Opening of IP3-Rs causes an efflux of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum
  into the cytoplasm. DAG and the increased intracellular Ca2+ levels lead to activation
  of protein kinase C (PKC) which, like PKA, can phosphorylate different target proteins.
