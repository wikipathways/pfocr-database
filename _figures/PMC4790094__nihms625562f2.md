caption: (a) A broad range of functions can be rapidly deployed through Ca2+ signals.
  One major Ca2+ function is the regulation of gene expression involved in cell activation,
  differentiation and cytokine production. Ca2+ controls the activation of NFAT via
  CaM-CN, CREB and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) via CaMK and CaM and NF-κB via
  PKC and CaMKII. Ca2+ controls exocytosis through Ca2+-sensitive proteins such as
  synaptotagmins (Syt) and Munc13. S100 proteins are Ca2+-binding proteins involved
  in the cytoskeleton organization during migration, lysosome-phagosome fusion during
  phagocytosis. In neutrophils, Ca2+ controls ROS production by NOX2 via PKC and S100
  proteins (S100A8/A9). (b) In T and B cells, Mg2+ is regulating Ca2+ mobilization
  via SOCE, by modulating PLC-γ activation. In T cells, the TCR-induced MAGT1-dependent
  Mg2+ flux is required to activate PLC-γ1. In B cell, TRPM7 kinase domain participates
  in PLC-γ2 activation together with Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in a Mg2+-dependent
  manner. (c) Zn2+ is involved in the recruitment of kinases such as PKC or LCK. Zn2+
  enhances MAPK activation through inhibition of the MAPKP. Zn2+ controls gene expression
  through NF-κB and through inhibition of CN (which promotes CREB activation). In
  innate immune cells, Zn2+ binding-proteins such as MT and S100 proteins (S100A8/A9)
  are playing anti-microbial roles by chelating Zn2+. Zn2+ inhibits IL-6 signaling
  by inhibiting the activation of STAT3. Finally, Zn2+ regulates the cAMP pathway
  through the inhibition of AC or PDE.
