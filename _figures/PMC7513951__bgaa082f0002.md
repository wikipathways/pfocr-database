caption: MUC1-C promotes loss of polarity in the integration of inflammatory and proliferative
  responses. (A) The MUC1-C subunit consists of the 58 aa extracellular domain (ED),
  28 aa transmembrane region and 72 CD. The CD includes a CQC motif, which is activated
  by increases in ROS in responses to infection, damage and other forms of stress.
  The CQC motif is necessary for MUC1-C homodimerization, nuclear import and function
  as an oncoprotein. The CD is otherwise an intrinsically disordered protein that
  has the capacity for modifications by diverse kinases and thereby structural alterations
  for direct interactions with signaling molecules and transcription factors (TFs).
  (B) Inflammation is associated with disruption of redox balance and increases in
  ROS. MUC1-C is activated by ROS-induced homodimerization and, in turn, disrupts
  the (i) CRB complex by suppressing CRB3, HUGL2 and PATJ and (ii) adherens junction
  by downregulating E-cadherin. As a result, MUC1-C contributes to loss of polarity
  and is repositioned from the apical surface to over the entire cell membrane. There,
  it interacts with effectors, such as RTKs, that are otherwise restricted to the
  basolateral borders of polarized epithelial cells. Figure modified from Kufe ().
  (C) MUC1-C contributes to RTK activation and their downstream proliferative signaling
  pathways. MUC1-C CD is phosphorylated by RTKs, resulting in SH2 domain binding motifs
  for (i) PI3K and activation of AKT→mTOR signaling, (ii) SRC, which can promote transformation
  and (iii) GRB2 with induction of the RAS→MEK→ERK pathway, linking inflammation and
  loss of polarity with proliferative responses.
