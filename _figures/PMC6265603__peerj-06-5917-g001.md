caption: Binding of insulin molecule to insulin receptor leads to auto-phosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues present on insulin receptor. A phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
  (PI3K) is translocated to the cell membrane and activated. As a result, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) is produced, which recruits Akt. The interaction of PIP3 with the PH domain
  of Akt induces conformational changes in Akt, thereby exposing the two main phosphorylation
  sites at T308 and S473. Phosphorylation at T308 and S473 by protein serine/threonine
  kinase 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2)
  respectively, is required for maximal Akt activation. Activated Akt can have a number
  of downstream effects such as glucose uptake via GLUT-4, regulation of apoptosis,
  promotion of cell survival and protein synthesis. PI3K/Akt pathway forms the junction
  for cross-talk between diabetes and breast cancer. As shown in the figure, increased
  insulin resistance leads to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia which further leads
  to breast cancer progression. OGT is overexpressed in both the systems and deregulation
  of cellular energetics effects GLUT-4 expression causing either insulin resistance
  (diabetes) or increased insulin sensitivity (breast cancer).
