  description: Contribution of transcription factors (TFs) to disease progression.
    Multiple transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers contribute to disease
    progression. Some are pleiotropic and affect multiple key biological pathways
    (multi-colored). Others (although affecting several systems in a global way) predominantly
    affect single key developmental and biochemical pathways such as growth (purple
    array) and lineage determination or differentiation (green array). Moreover, pleiotropic
    TFs may be predominantly active at an early stage in disease evolution, whilst
    single pathway TFs are most prominent later in disease progression. This is exemplified
    by the phenomenon that localized prostate cancer (PCa) does not display a high
    proliferative index or huge fluctuations in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
    level prior to treatment (a marker of a transformed, differentiated prostate).
    As such, TFs are ever-present throughout disease evolution and collaborate to
    promote tumor differentiation, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
    The purple array includes tumour protein 53 (TP53), E2 factor (E2F) and retinoblastoma
    protein (RB1). The green array includes the twist family BHLH transcription factor
    1 (TWIST1), achaete-scute family BHLH transcription factor 1 (ASCL1), N-Myc and
