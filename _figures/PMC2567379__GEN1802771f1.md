caption: A model of SIR1-dependent and -independent contributions to silencing. The
  dominant pathway for assembling Sir2–4 chromatin at the HM loci is SIR1 dependent
  (symbolized by thick arrow from SIR1 to Sir2–4 chromatin). This pathway involves
  direct protein–protein interactions between Sir1 and silencer-bound proteins, such
  as ORC, and Sir proteins, such as Sir4. However, it is clear that other SIR1-independent
  pathway(s) contribute to HM silencing and the ability of Sir2–4 proteins to bind
  to silencers. These pathways can be revealed only in sir1Δ cells. In a previous
  study (), we acquired evidence that one such pathway is associated with the cell-cycle
  regulatory genes FKH1 and CLB5. Genetic analyses described in this previous study
  provide evidence that FKH1 functions as a positive regulator of this pathway (“?”
  below FKH1 and CLB5) whereas CLB5 functions as a negative regulator of this pathway.
  The molecular nature of this pathway is unknown, but we speculate that it might
  involve mechanisms that control the association of the HM loci with a region of
  the nuclear periphery where pools of Sir2–4 proteins are concentrated. We propose
  that this SIR1-independent pathway is the pathway most sensitive to cell-cycle perturbations
  because, for example, the activities of specific proteins that define this pathway
  are regulated during the cell cycle. In this study, a genetic screen was performed
  to identify genes encoding proteins regulated by FKH1 and CLB5 or any additional
  genes that might contribute to SIR1-independent modes of HM silencing.
