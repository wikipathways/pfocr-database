caption: Extracellular ATP (ATPe) dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes.
  The parasite induces a general increase of solute permeability at the host cell
  membrane (EPM; erythrocyte plasma membrane), via new permeability pathways (NPPs),
  which includes an increase of ATP efflux mediated by several proteins like pannexin
  1 (Pnx-1), anionic channels such as voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) coupled
  to partner proteins, generic solute pores as plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC)
  and novel parasite proteins yet to be discovered. ATPe hydrolysis by red blood cells
  (RBCs) E-NTPDases (ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases) is extremely
  low but strongly increases under infection, though participation of parasite NTPDases
  at the host membrane remains to be proven. Still, ATPe and its metabolic byproducts
  should be able to activate functional P1 and P2 receptors of the host, triggering
  intracellular signaling. In uninfected RBCs, part of this signaling was shown to
  affect ATP efflux. On the other hand, accumulation of nucleosides (due to hydrolase
  activities of E-NTPDases and CD73) will promote their uptake by host equilibrative
  nucleotide transporters (ENT). Nucleosides will then transverse both unspecific
  vacuolar pores (Pore) of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and PfENT1 of
  the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to gain access to the parasite. Nucleosides will
  then serve as substrates in the parasite pathway for de novo synthesis of nucleotides.
  The parasite traslocon PTEX was shown to transport parasite protein(s) to the host
  membrane, EPM, upregulating Ca2+ uptake. Once in the RBC cytoplasm, Ca2+ may be
  transported through the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) by a calcium ATPase transporter,
  potentially reaching the parasite cytoplasm through a P2X-like receptor conductance.
  On the other hand PTEX may be involved in the translocation of parasite proteins
  to the NPPs, as e.g., PSAC.
