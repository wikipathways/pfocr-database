caption: Currently, the drugs targeting autophagy initiation, membrane nucleation,
  and lysosomal degradation are under experimental or clinical investigation. Other
  regulatory steps of autophagy, including the membrane fusion mechanism, could also
  serve as drug targets to block autophagy with high potency and selectivity. TORC1,
  Target of rapamycin complex 1; PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SNARE, Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor Attachment protein REceptors.
