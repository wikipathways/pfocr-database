  An overview of the main biochemical changes of red blood cells (RBC) ageing in vitro
  under blood bank conditions.Cation homeostasis (K+, Ca2+) is dysregulated by low
  temperatures and progressive depletion of high-energy phosphate reservoirs (adenosine
  triphosphate - ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate - DPG). Glucose (additive solution)
  is internalised through GLUT transporters and consumed through the Emden-Meyerhof
  glycolytic pathway, in order to produce ATP, lactate (LAC) and promote pH lowering.
  Storage also results in a progressive decrease of S-nitrosothiol-haemoglobin (Hb).
  However, low temperatures and the progressive accumulation of oxidative stress (probably
  triggered by Hb-mediated Fenton reactions) promote a metabolic diversion towards
  the pentose phosphate pathway, in order to produce oxidized glutathione (GSSG)-
  reducing NADPH from glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). Pentose phosphate pathway intermediates
  can re-enter glycolysis or proceed towards the purine salvage pathway (also influenced
  by adenosine and inosine in the additive/rejuvenation solution). Alterations to
  calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis (and of other second messenger signalling molecules,
  such as cAMP and AMP) promote the activation of specific kinases (e.g. PKC, PKA,
  AMPK) or activate proteolytic enzymes (such as calpains) that start digesting structural
  and functional proteins in the cytosol and membrane, above all band 3 (AE1). Anion
  exchanger 1/band 3 (AE1) is responsible for the chloride shift, whereby bicarbonate
  (HCO3−) is exchanged for chloride (Cl−), thus modulating anion homeostasis, intracellular
  pH and, indirectly, Hb-oxygen affinity and thus gas exchange. Fragmentation of the
  cytosolic domain of AE1 (also mediated by reactive oxygen species, ROS) promotes
  displacement of glycolytic enzymes (thereby bound/inhibited) and structural proteins
  (ankyrin, ANK, band 4.2 and 4.1). Enhanced oxidation of cytosolic proteins is partly
  challenged by antioxidant defences (SOD1, PRDX2) and chaperone molecules (heat shock
  proteins, HSP), while they progressively result in the accumulation of redox modifications
  to proteins (carbonylation, glycation of haemoglobin [HbA1c], protein fragmentation)
  and lipids (lipid peroxidation, accumulation of prostaglandins in the supernatant).
  Alternative degradation strategies for proteins (proteasome, eventually extruded
  in the supernatant) and lipids (sphingomyelinase-dependent accumulation of ceramides)
  also play a role in this process. Progressive leaching of plasticizers (DEHP) from
  the plastic bag results in local accumulation in cell membranes. At the membrane
  level, AE1 clusters, exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet, and
  lipid raft formation alter the pro-immunogenic potential of RBC. Taken together,
  these alterations affect membrane deformability, increase osmotic fragility and
  promote vesiculation, a process in which micro- and nanovesicles are shed in order
  to eliminate irreversibly altered proteins (including traces of glycolytic enzymes),
  enriched with haemoglobin and lipid raft proteins, membrane portions (also exposing
  common rheological antigens, such as CD47, Rh, RhAG, glycophorin A-GPA). Reprinted
