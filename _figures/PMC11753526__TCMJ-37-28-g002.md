caption: 'A comprehensive examination of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-mediated
  signaling pathway. TLR9 binds to its ligands inside endosomal compartments, such
  as CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) viral dsDNA (human papillomavirus). The TIR domain
  of TLR9, located in the cytosol, attracts the adaptor protein MyD88 and other signaling
  molecules, including IRAK-4 and TRAF6, which are necessary to form the signaling
  complex. Transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), IRF-5
  (not seen in this diagram), and IRF-7 are further brought into the complex and stimulated,
  as the text explains. The intricate structure then triggers additional signaling
  pathways that result in the activation of nuclear factor-κB and AP-1. These activated
  transcription factors stimulate a variety of genes associated with immunity. NF-κB:
  Nuclear factor-κB, TLR9: Toll-like receptor 9, TNF: Tumor necrosis factor, IL: Interleukin,
  IFN: Interferon, IRF: Interferon regulatory factor'
