caption: The JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Signals from extracellular cytokines are
  transmitted to the cell nucleus via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The transmembrane
  receptor of a cytokine binds to it and activates receptor associated JAKs, which
  phosphorylate STAT proteins. The transcription of the target genes is modulated
  by activated STAT proteins, which migrate into the cell nucleus as homo- or heterodimers
