caption: Simplified schematic of LPS-induced inflammatory pathway. Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) recognises and binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Binding activates two signal
  transduction pathways through the stimulation of myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)
  adaptor molecules. MyD88 and TRIF activates two transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB
  (NFκB) and interferon response factors (IRFs). IRFs enhance the expression of Type
  I interferon genes, resulting in the secretion of type I interferons. NFκB promotes
  transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, resulting
  in acute inflammation and initiation of the adaptive immunity. NFκB signalling also
  induces NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain–containing protein 3 (NLRP3) gene expression,
  essential for inflammasome formation. The NLRP3-inflammasome cleaves and activates
  caspase-1, which cleaves the inactive precursor pro-IL-1β into its biologically
  active and secreted form, IL-1β. IL-1β secretion results in enhanced inflammation
  and immune cell infiltration. Caspase-1 also cleaves and activates Gasdermin D (GSDMD),
  leading to pore formation in the plasma membrane, triggering pyroptosis and further
  inflammation. This inflammatory pathway is a key regulator of the inflammation associated
  with CF.
