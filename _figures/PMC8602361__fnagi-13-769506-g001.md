caption: Schematic illustration of neuronal death and protection induced by the activation
  of microglia via α-synuclein and the relationship between α-synuclein and T cells.
  Accumulated α-synuclein released from neurons binds the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)
  or Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to induce a proinflammation cascade. At the same
  time, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is activated to induce the MyD88 pathway for
  M1 microglia activation. α-synuclein can also be transferred into microglia by exosome.
  Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β) can be released from activated M1 microglia to result in neuronal death.
  Damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in the
  infiltration of T cells including cluster of differentiation 4 + (CD4 +) T cells,
  cluster of differentiation 4 + (CD8 +) T cells, and regulatory T cells from the
  peripheral blood that can infiltrate into central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS,
  microglia and astrocyte act as the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to present the
  α-synuclein to the T cells. Activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells release cytokines
  that promote neuronal death, while Tregs exert a protective effect on neurons.
