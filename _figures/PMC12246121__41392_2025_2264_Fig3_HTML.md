caption: 'Structure of different PRRS in the cytoplasm and nucleus. a The structure
  of cGAS. Upon cytosolic DNA detection, cGAS synthesizes 2''3’-cGAMP from ATP and
  GTP. The produced 2''3’-cGAMP acts as a second messenger, binding to and activating
  the ER-resident protein STING. This interaction leads to the dimerization and autophosphorylation
  of STING, which then recruits and activates TBK1. Subsequently, TBK1 phosphorylates
  the transcription factor IRF3, promoting its dimerization, nuclear translocation,
  and activation of ISGs. This pathway is crucial for the induction of type I interferon
  responses against intracellular pathogens. b The functional domains of HNRNPA2/B1.
  The N-terminal of HNRNPA2/B1 proteins contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1
  and RRM2), and the C-terminal is a glycine-rich low-complexity region (LC) containing
  an RGG box, an M9 nuclear localization signal (NLS), and a core prion-like domain
  (PrLD), reference from.602 c The structure of NLRs. NLRs are composed of three main
  domains: one is the central nucleotide-binding domain, also known as the NACHT domain
  (synthesized by the abbreviations of the following four kinds of NLR members: NAIP,
  CIITA, HETE, and TEP1; LRRs at the C-terminus, which are used to identify ligands;
  and the N-terminal effector domain, which is the protein interaction domain, such
  as CARD or PYD. Based on their distinct N-terminal effector domains, the NLRs can
  be categorized into five subfamilies. NLRA, NLRB, NLRC, NLRP, and NLRX1. d The structure
  of CLRs, exemplified by AIM. Structurally, AIM2 consists of a C-terminal HIN-200
  domain and an N-terminal PYD. Acting as a cytosolic DNA receptor, AIM2 directly
  interacts with dsDNA through its HIN-200 domain. The PYD of AIM2 engages with the
  corresponding PYD of the inflammasome adapter protein ASC. Subsequently, the CARD
  of ASC connects with the CARD of procaspase-1, leading to the formation of the AIM2
  inflammasome. This figure is created by BioRender (https://app.biorender.com)'
