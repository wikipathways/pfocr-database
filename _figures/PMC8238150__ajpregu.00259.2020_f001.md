caption: 'Influence of renal prorenin receptor (PRR) on water and sodium homeostasis
  and blood pressure. A: in the principal cells of the collecting duct, the binding
  of vasopressin (AVP) to the vasopressin receptor (V2R) stimulates cAMP and upregulates
  PRR [via the activation of the prostaglandin (PGE2) pathway], which increases of
  the expression of aquaporin (AQP2) and water reabsorption. The intercalated cells
  secrete soluble PRR (sPRR) that binds to the frizzled-8 (FZD8) /LDL receptor related
  protein 6 (LRP6), increases AQP2 gene expression, and participates in water reabsorption
  in the principal cells. Both PRR and sPRR bind prorenin and renin and increase ANG
  II generation, which, in turn, stimulates angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and
  influences AQP2 trafficking. PRR influences Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure regulation
  via modulation of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression. B: PRR, via ERK1/2 signaling,
  has proinflammatory and fibrotic effects in podocyte and mesangial, and proximal
  tubule cells. C: PRR activates ERK1/2 pathway in the macula densa (MD) cells, which
  increases the synthesis of prostaglandin (PGE2) via the activation of cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX2) and PGE-synthetase (mPEG-1), and increases (pro)renin release by juxtaglomerular
  cells.'
