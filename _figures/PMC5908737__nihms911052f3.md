caption: A. MUC1-C activates (i) BMI1 and RING2 by MYC-mediated mechanisms, and (ii)
  RING1 through the NF-κB p65 pathway . Thus, targeting MUC1-C is associated with
  downregulation of BMI1, RING2 and RING1 expression in TNBC and NSCLC cells . B.
  Schemas of the BMI1, RING2 and RING1 promoters with highlighting of the MYC and
  NF-κB binding sites. C. MUC1-C binds directly to BMI1 by an interaction dependent
  of the MUC1-C CQC motif . Complexes of MUC1-C and BMI1 have been detected on the
  CDKN2A promoter . In support of the depiction, targeting MUC1-C genetically or with
  the GO-203 inhibitor (i) decreases H2A ubiquitylation, (ii) increases HOXC5 and
  HOXC13 expression, and (iii) activates CDKN2A and expression of p16INK4a . The findings
  thus support a role for MUC1-C in contributing to BMI1-driven tumor promotion, self-renewal
  capacity, the CSC state, and genomic instability.
