caption: Simplified photosynthetic metabolism in the chloroplasts of C3 plants considered
  for M_DFBA. This consisted of 8 metabolites (Rubisco, RuBP, PGA, ATP, ADP, Pi, NADP,
  and NADPH) and 5 reactions (V1, dark reaction; V2, photorespiration; V3, RuBP regeneration;
  V4, light reaction; V5:, ATP synthesis). Through pathway analysis the main output
  of this network is defined as PGA, thus the simplified input consists of Pi, CO2,
  and O2.
