caption: A Proposed Model for the Role of AF-1 in the Response of ERβ to Erk ActivationActivation
  of Erk in cells promotes ERβ phosphorylation at the AF-1 domain which mediates a
  favored recruitment of transcriptional coactivators SRC-1 and CBP, and subsequent
  transactivation (  ). The phosphorylation of AF-1 also promotes the recruitment
  of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-AP to ERβ which results in receptor ubiquitination,
  transcriptional repression, clustering into inactive nuclear compartments, and degradation
  by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This activation-degradation pathway is highly
  dependent upon the phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of ERβ at distinct sites and
  does not require the presence of hormone, thereby providing an exclusive and functional
  role for the AF-1 to integrate receptor activity and turnover to kinase signaling
  pathways.
