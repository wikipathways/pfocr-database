caption: A schematic model for downstream signaling pathway of TROY/RKIP interaction
  in glioma RKIP interacts with upstream regulatory molecules of NF-κB (IKKα, IKKβ,
  NIK and TAK1) and negatively modulate activation of NF-κB (left). After FBS exposure,
  the RKIP are retained by TROY receptor through interaction. These retention subsequently
  attenuate the inhibitory effects of RKIP on the upstream active regulators of NF-κB
  and result in the liberation from the upstream inactive complex, IκB, which resulting
  in NF-κB activation. This activation can in turn lead to the downstream transcriptional
  activation of cell-cycle genes, promoting proliferation and cell cycles following
  extracellular stimulation (right)
