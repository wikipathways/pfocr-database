caption: IL-38 signaling pathways. The N-terminus of IL-38 requires cleavage, but
  which protease(s) is responsible remains unknown. The process may involve an intra-
  or extracellular protease(s). IL-38 is mainly reported to exist in two forms—a truncated
  form and a full-length form. However, which form(s) of IL-38 is naturally present
  in the human body remains unknown. Interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-36R
  are activated by the agonists IL-1 and IL-36, respectively. The heterodimeric receptor
  complex consisting of IL-1R1 or IL-36R and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein
  (IL-1RAcP) results in myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) recruitment
  through the intracellular toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain, and the downstream
  signaling pathways that are activated include (A) the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  pathway and (B) the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through extracellular
  regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which stimulate
  the activator protein-1 (AP-1). NF-κB and AP-1, then bind DNA and stimulate the
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, IL-38 acts
  as an antagonist of IL-1R1 and IL-36R, restraining the recruitment of IL-1RAcP and
  the binding of agonists, similar to what occurs for IL-1Ra and IL-36Ra. IL-1Ra and
  IL-36Ra recruit the inhibitory receptor single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule
  (SIGIRR), which interferes with the TIR domain to exert antagonist properties, it
  remains unknown whether IL-38 can recruit SIGIRR. In addition, truncated IL-38 antagonizes
  IL-RAPL1 by recruiting a not-yet-identified inhibitory coreceptor and suppressing
  the JNK/AP1 pathway, full-length IL-38 activates the pathway.
