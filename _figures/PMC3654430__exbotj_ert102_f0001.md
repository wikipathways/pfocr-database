caption: Biosynthesis of steroids and BRs, and the Arabidopsis enzymes involved. The
  metabolic products are shown in boxes and the enzymes involved in the pathway are
  depicted in red. The predominant pathway to synthesize BL runs from the campestanol
  (CN)-independent pathway and late C-6 oxodation pathway and is indicated by the
  red arrows. The CN-dependent pathway is represented by the green arrows. Compounds
  measured in this study are indicated in a green box.
