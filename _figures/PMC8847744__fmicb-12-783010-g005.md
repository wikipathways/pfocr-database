caption: Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) protect the
  intestinal epithelial barrier. The activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2) are resulted in by Leptin binding to the long form LRb, which causes
  follow-up phosphorylation of downstream tyrosine residues (Tyr985, Tyr1077, and
  Tyr1138) in the intracellular tail of LRb. The phosphorylation-dependent activation
  of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) are bound and mediated
  by Phosphorylated Tyr1138, activating transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3 (SOCS3) and other positive effectors of leptin action. The SH2-containing tyrosine
  phosphatase SHP-2 is recruited by Phosphorylated Tyr985, activating the signaling
  path culminating in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. The
  C-EPIYA-CagA-mediated JAK/STAT Pathway and gp130-mediated STAT1/3 signaling plays
  a protective role in intestinal epithelium.
