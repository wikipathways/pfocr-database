caption: Modes of d‐alanine's action on systemic circadian rhythm. d‐Alanine acts
  on the brain to modulate circadian rhythms, conveying these rhythms to peripheral
  organs and inducing behavioral changes. Notably, d‐alanine exhibits its own circadian
  rhythm within the hypothalamus. In the kidney, d‐alanine directly stimulates gluconeogenesis,
  a circadian‐related metabolic pathway that generates glucose from intermediates
  of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Conversely, both the brain and kidney contribute
  to the regulation of d‐alanine's intrinsic rhythm
