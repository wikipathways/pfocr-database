caption: Potential therapies targeting RASGAPs in urological cancers. Therapies aimed
  at increasing RASGAP levels result in increased RASGAP gene expression by contributing
  to the demethylation of RASGAPs. Therapies targeting pathways activated by RASGAPs
  are shown. By targeting these pathways, the aim is to sensitize cancer cells to
  inhibitors, therapy, or ionizing radiation, thereby reducing cell proliferation
  and invasion. Consequently, these strategies seek to mitigate the effects of RAS
  signaling in urological cancer cells, either by enhancing the expression of RASGAPs
  or by directly interfering with downstream signaling pathways
