caption: The DEGs related to LC were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. ECM1 was
  selected from the DEGs and was then used to modify HF-MSCs. The cells were injected
  into mice with CCl4-induced LC through the tail vein. Four weeks after cell transplantation,
  serum and liver tissue were collected for HE and Masson staining and Western blotting
  and immunofluorescence detection.
papertitle: ECM1 modified HF-MSCs targeting HSC attenuate liver cirrhosis by inhibiting
  the TGF-Î²/Smad signaling pathway.
