caption: Cardioprotection is typically initiated by activation of G-protein coupled
  receptors, which result in activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. This leads
  to phosphorylation and activation of AKT and eNOS and activation of PKC and ERK
  (not shown). Activation of the PI3K pathway also leads to phosphorylation and inactivation
  of GSK. Inhibition of GSK has been reported to result in a reduction in ATP entry
  into the mitochondria thus reducing consumption of glycolytically generated ATP,
  which is consumed by reverse mode of the F1-F0ATPase. Inhibition of GSK has also
  been reported to inhibit the MPTP, the precise mechanism is unclear, but inhibition
  of GSK has been reported to inhibit phosphorylation of cyclophilin and to correlate
  with inhibition of MPTP opening. In the figure p-GSK indicates inactive GSK, which
  inhibits ATP entry via VDAC and cyclophilin activation of MPTP at least in part
  by a decrease in phosphorylation. PKC has also been reported to phopshorylated and
  inhibit BAD, and to phosphorylate and activate mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase
  (not shown). Activation of NOS leads to generation of nitric oxide that in turn
  activates guanlyly cyclase that has been reported to activate the mitochondrial
  K ATP channel (not shown). Nitric oxide also leads to protein S-nitroyslation (SNO)
  and SNO of PTEN results in its inhibition leading to enhanced signaling via PI3K.
  SNO of the L-type Ca channel reduces calcium entry resulting in less calcium to
  enter the mitochondria and thus less calcium activation of the MPTP. SNO inhibits
  the F1-F0ATPase further reducing consumption of glycolytic ATP. The reduction in
  ATP consumption reduces lactate generation and thereby reduces calcium entry via
  Na-Caexchange coupled to Na-H exchange. The inhibition of the F1F0ATPase also result
  in a more rapid and complete decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential and
  since the mitochondrial membrane potential is the driving force for calcium entry
  into the mitochondrial, this will also reduce mitochondrial calcium. SNO of complex
  I has been shown to reduce generation of ROS. Thus the cardioprotective signaling
  pathways lead to reduction in calcium and ROS the triggers for MPTP.
