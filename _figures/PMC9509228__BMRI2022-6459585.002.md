caption: Mitochondria-endoplasmic communication-mediated autophagy. Mitochondria and
  endoplasmic reticulum can control the distance between the two organelles through
  PTPIP51 and VAPB protein, thereby affecting the Ca2+ exchange between mitochondria
  and endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ is the second messenger in cells, and its content
  can regulate the degree of oxidative stress and autophagy of mitochondria and endoplasmic
  reticulum. (1) When oxidative stress occurs, the mitochondrial membrane potential
  decreases, PINK/parkin pathway is activated, and membrane proteins are ubiquitinated.
  Ubiquitinated membrane proteins bind to LC3 and p62 to localize autophagosomes to
  damaged mitochondria. (2) Mitochondria can also activate ULK1 complex and PIK3C3
  complex by phosphorylating Beclin1 and inhibiting mTOR to enhance the expression
  of autophagy genes and promote the formation of autophagosomes. (3) The FUNDC1 receptor
  on the mitochondrial membrane has a good affinity with ULK1 and can bind to it to
  induce mitochondrial autophagy. (4) The endoplasmic reticulum-unfolded protein response
  can phosphorylate eIF2α by activating PERK, thereby promoting the expression of
  autophagy-related genes and enhancing the transcription of CHOP, thereby recruiting
  autophagosomes. IRE1 can also increase the expression of CHOP transcription factors
  by activating JNK. ATF6 can upregulate the activity of death-related proteases,
  phosphorylate Beclin1, and induce autophagy. (5) Increased Ca2+ in the cytoplasm
  can activate CAMK2B, thereby activating AMPK and inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of mTOR. (6) The combination of FAM134B and LC3 accelerates the fragmentation of
  damaged endoplasmic reticulum and promotes the formation of autophagic membranes.
