caption: Changes in gene expression in central carbon metabolism (A) and ergosterol
  synthesis (B). The oxygen-dependent part of the ergosterol pathway in highlighted
  with a gray box. The log fold change in expression is shown; genes with increased
  expression are shown in red, those with decreased expression are shown in green,
  and genes that were not detected or are not differentially expressed are shown in
  gray. Hyp, hypoxia; Keto, ketoconazole; CoA, coenzyme A.
