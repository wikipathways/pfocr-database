caption: An IL-1-induced signaling pathway is mediated by K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of IRF1. Upon stimulation by IL-1, IL-1R recruits MyD88 adapter, IRAK4, IRAK1, MEKK3
  and TRAF6. This results in recruitment of a series of signaling molecules and consequent
  activation of MAPKs, followed by translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it
  induces the expression of genes encoding IRF1, cIAP2 and a variety of cytokines.
  Newly synthesized IRF1 undergoes K63 polyubiquitination with TRAF6-associated cIAP2.
  This K63-linked polyubiquitination is regulated by S1P, which is generated by SphK1
  upon activation of IL-1. Subsequently, IRF1 translocates to the nucleus and activates
  expression of IRF1-dependent genes, including those encoding chemokines such as
  CCL5 and CXCL10. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB.
