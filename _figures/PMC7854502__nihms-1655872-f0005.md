caption: In the injured and fibrotic liver, hepatocyte developmental pathway activity
  results in proliferation and cellular transformation. Notch activation induces a
  range of cell-cycle genes, the autocrine mitogen Igf2, and biliary and progenitor-associated
  genes (that is, Sox9 and Spp1) that regulate the tumour microenvironment (TME) and
  cellular plasticity. Enhanced cell–cell contact and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness
  as well as a variety of nutrient factors, such as bile acids and cholesterol, increase
  YAP–TAZ stability, nuclear translocation, and transcription factor TEAD activity
  to augment proliferation and influence cellular metabolism and the TME to favour
  tumorigenesis, and might drive further Notch activity. In parallel, β-catenin activation,
  in part due to driver mutations in Ctnnb1, induces a T cell factor (TCF)-dependent
  proliferative response, alters hepatocyte metabolism via regulation of glutamine
  synthetase (encoded by Glul) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (encoded
  by Ppara), and promotes tumoural T cell exclusion. HSC, hepatic stellate cell; NICD,
  Notch intracellular domain; RBPJ, immunoglobulin-κJ region.
