caption: Cellular and soluble factors in MPM-ME. The interconnection between tumor

  permissive environment for cancer growth, immune escape and invasiveness []. Tumor
  cells, by the release of the growth factors FGF-2 and PDGF-AA, recruited fibroblast
  at tumor sites promoting their pro-tumoral activity as CAFs. In turn, these CAFs

  supporting tumor growth [,]. Additionally, MPM cells have been found to express
  the CTGF as modulator of ECM-related proteins and supporter of cancer invasiveness
  []. CAFs as well as tumor cells, via the release of the angiogenic VEGF, promoted
  the recruitment of endothelial cells and the vasculogenesis [,,]. Exhausted Th and
  CD8+ T cells are also present in TME, characterized by the expression of immune
  checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1, TIM3, LAG3 []. Moreover, PD-L1 signaling induced
  Th cells reprogramming in Treg cells []. Moreover, the NK cells showed an immunosuppressive
  phenotype and low cytotoxicity []. TAMs, which represent the most abundant immune
  population [], are recruited at tumor sites by tumor-produced CCL2 []. MPM cells

  and chemoresistance [,]. Recently, the inhibition of CSF-1R has been shown to reduce
  mesothelioma progression and increase the susceptibility of MPM to immune checkpoint
  inhibitors []. The activation of the IL-1β/IL-1R signaling pathway in tumors by
  TAMs is correlated with the acquisition of a CSC-like phenotype []. As observed
  in other tumor types, adenosine (ADO) pathways may be involved in MM cells-TAMs
