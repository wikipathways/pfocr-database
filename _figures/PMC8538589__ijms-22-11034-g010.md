caption: Model summarizing the members of Ser and Mel biosynthetic pathway of rice,
  highlighting their regulation. The crosstalk between genes encoding enzymes for
  Ser and Mel biosynthesis (identified by genome-wide analysis) harboured in different
  sub-cellular compartments, have been illustrated under stress conditions, based
  on transcript profile validations. The miRNA-based regulation of specific gene family
  members has also been indicated. The black dotted arrows depict the stress-inducibility
  of specific transcripts regulating Ser and Mel biosynthesis under various stress
  conditions, as validated by qRT-PCR. Solid black lines depict regulation of transcripts
  with specific miRNAs. Coloured arrows depict the genes encoding the enzymes involved
  in the Ser and Mel biosynthesis.
