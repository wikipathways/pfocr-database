caption: Acetyl-CoA metabolism in endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. Acetyl-CoA is
  transported from the cytoplasm to endoplasmic reticulum by the acetyl-CoA transporter
  1. It may be taken up directly from cytoplasm or generated by ACLY or ACSS2, forming
  functional complexes with AT1. Structurally competent proteins are then acetylated
  in ER lumen by protein acetyltransferases and released by a secretory pathway. Misfolded
  and damaged proteins are directed to autophagosomes. The nuclear membrane is fully
  permeable to cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA. However, some amounts of this metabolite are
  synthesised within the nucleus by ACLY, ACSS2 or PDHC from respective precursor
  metabolites. They provide acetyl-CoA directly to HATs, which acetylates multiple
  histones, thereby regulating expression of different parts of the genome.
