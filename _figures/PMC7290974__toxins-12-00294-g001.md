caption: 'Toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich
  repeat (NLR) receptor signaling in response to L. monocytogenes (Lm). TLR2 recognizes
  lipoproteins (LP) or lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and transmits via a signal transduction
  pathway including Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), IL-1R-associated
  kinase (IRAK) proteins and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). NOD1 and NOD2
  recognize diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) respectively, resulting
  in RIPK2 recruitment and activation. These converge on TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
  which triggers two diverging pathways: activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex
  resulting in NF-κB activation and; Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade
  which culminates in the activation of the transcription factor Activator protein-1
  (AP-1). IKKβ then phosphorylates the IκB which is ubiquitinated and degraded by
  the proteasome. NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other genes involved in immune processes. NOD1/2
  and TLR3 (via TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)) can also
  stimulate type-I interferon production via TANK-binding protein 1 (TBK) and interferon
  regulatory transcription factors 3/7 (IRF3/7).'
