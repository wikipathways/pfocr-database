caption: 'Types of Unconventional Protein Secretion in Eukaryotes. The classical secretion
  of proteins containing signal peptides involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
  the Golgi complex during normal conditions. These proteins are transported through
  vesicles that bud off the Golgi complex and fuse with the plasma membrane. However,
  leaderless proteins can be secreted through an unconventional pathway (UPS) that
  bypasses the Golgi during stress conditions. There are four different USPs in eukaryotes:
  Type I, in which proteins are secreted through a pore in the plasma membrane; Type
  II, with the transport of proteins through the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) transporters (not shown in the figure); Type III, which uses autophagosomes/endosomes
  to transport proteins to the extracellular; and type IV, in which proteins containing
  a signal peptide are secreted bypassing the Golgi. Brain tumors can make use of
  three different types of UPS: type I (membrane pores), type III (differential vesicles),
  and type IV (Golgi bypass). The plethora of proteins secreted through UPS can interact
  with neighboring cells, promoting distinct pathways of key importance in GBM biology,
  such as proliferation (orange), migration (blue), invasion (pink), inflammation
  (yellow), angiogenesis (red) and drug resistance (green).'
