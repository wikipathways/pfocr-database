caption: Mechanistic proposal for the catalytic cycles of SnoN and SnoK. Generation
  of the high-valent iron-oxo species is likely to be identical in the two enzymes
  (black outline). In the carbocyclization reaction by SnoK (inner circle, gray outline),
  two hydrogen atoms H5′′ and H2 (purple) are sequentially abstracted from the substrate
  5. In the stereoinversion reaction by SnoN (outer circle, purple outline), an external
  source of electrons is most likely required to complete the reaction cycle after
  abstraction of the H4′′ (purple) atom. Two primary substrates 2 are converted for
  each α-KG.
