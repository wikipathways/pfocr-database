caption: The role of Siglec-G in various immune cells. (A) Antigen recognition by
  the B cell receptor (BCR) on B-1a cells triggers a Ca++ influx and activates NFATc1
  via calcineurin. This leads to the survival, proliferation, and activation of B-1a
  cells. Siglec-G is recruited to the antigen-activated mIgM, where it binds sialic
  acid moieties on the mIgM. The ITIM domain of Siglec-G is phosphorylated by Lyn
  kinase, resulting in the recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1, inhibiting
  both mIgM-induced Ca++signaling and NFATc1 expression. Siglec-G also inhibits NF-κB
  activation and regulates NF-κB-dependent B-1a cells activation, proliferation, and
  survival. (B) Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HMGB1, HSP70, and
  HSP90 are released from damaged cells during sterile or infectious inflammation.
  DAMPs are recognized by TLRs, which subsequently activates NF-κB and increases the
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines. CD24 expressed on the surface of dendritic
  cells (DCs) binds DAMPs. CD24 also binds to Siglec-G, thereby forming a tri-molecular
  complex. This leads to the activation of SHP1 through Siglec-G-mediated signaling.
  SHP1 inhibits DAMPs-mediated activation of NF-κB, ultimately leading to the decreased
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (C) In macrophages, double-stranded RNA
  viruses enter into the cells and recognize RIG-1 coupled with MAVS receptors and
  activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3. NF-κB increases the expression
  of Siglec-G as a positive feedback loop mechanism, and increases the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IRF3 increases the expression of type I IFNs. RNA
  viruses also bind to Siglec-G and activates its associated SHP2, which causes Cbl-dependent
  ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of RIG-I, leading to the suppression
  of IFNβ expression through a negative feedback loop. (D) HMGB1 induces TCR-, and
  CD28-mediated T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production through
  TLR4-NF-κB- and STAT3-dependent pathway. HMGB1 increases Siglec-G expression through
  TLR4-NF-κB pathway. HMGB1 binds to CD24, and CD24 binds to Siglec-G. This tri-molecular
  complex activates SHP1 and SHP2 to inhibit NF-κB and STAT3 activation, leading to
  the decreased cellular activation and proliferation.
