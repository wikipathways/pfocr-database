caption: The Nodal signaling pathway. After processing of the Nodal precursor by convertases,
  Nodal ligands signal through activin receptors and EGF-CFC coreceptors. Cerberus
  and Lefty act as extracellular inhibitors. MicroRNAs belonging to the miR-430 family
  target Nodal (zebrafish squint) and Lefty mRNAs for degradation and repression.
  Mir-15/16 represses the type II activin receptor. Rap2 is involved in the recycling
  of activin receptors whereas Dapper 2 targets activin receptor complexes for degradation
  in the lysosome. Pathway activation is mediated by phosphorylation of Smad2 and
  its association with Smad4 and transcription factors such as FoxH1, Mixer, and p53.
  Phospho-Smad2 is dephosphorylated by PPM1A and exported from the nucleus by RanBP3.
  Smad4 activity and stability is regulated by the ubiquitinase Ectodermin and the
  deubiquitinase FAM/Usp9x. See text for details.
