caption: IPA identified “Tec kinase family signalling” as the canonical pathway in
  the cells with the highest predicted potential/significance of being affected by
  the treatment of caerin 1.9, based on iTRAQ data. The up/downregulations of proteins
  induced by caerin 1.9 are indicated by nodes with range of red and green intensities.
  The activation or inhibition of certain signalling was shown in orange or blue,
  respectively. Lines connecting the proteins represent known interactions, and arrows
  indicate the directions of up/downstream regulations.
