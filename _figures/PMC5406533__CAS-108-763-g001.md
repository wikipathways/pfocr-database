caption: Schematic models of multiple mechanisms of action underlying the antitumor
  activity of combined treatment with lenvatinib plus everolimus in renal cell carcinoma
  (RCC) xenograft mouse models. (a) Lenvatinib plus everolimus combination enhances
  the inhibition of both fibroblast growth factor (FGF)‐ and vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF)‐induced tumor angiogenesis (e.g. Caki‐1 model). (b) Lenvatinib
  inhibits tumor angiogenesis and everolimus inhibits tumor cell proliferation, resulting
  in enhanced antitumor activity against RCC (e.g. A‐498 model). (c) Lenvatinib and
  everolimus cooperate to enhance activity against RCC cell proliferation that is
  dependent on the FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway. This model is hypothetical
  but is plausible in light of reports of the importance of the FGF pathway in RCC
  pathogenesis. (d) Mechanistic model of the dual inhibition of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)/FGFR
  and downstream mTOR signaling pathway. The increased inhibition of phosphorylation
  at S6K (T421/S424) and S6 (S235/S236) due to combined treatment with lenvatinib
  plus everolimus may result from the dual inhibition of both the Erk1/2 and mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
