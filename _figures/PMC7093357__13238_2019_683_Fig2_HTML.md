caption: Epidermal keratinocytes modulate nociceptive sensory neuron activity. Keratinocytes
  produce both pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive substances, which bind to the
  intra-epidermal free nerve endings (FNEs) to modulate neuronal activity. (1) Painful
  cutaneous injury activates nociceptive FNE. (2) Keratinocytes are also exposed to
  injury. (3) This exposition to injury induces the release of FNE activators by keratinocytes,
  such as ATP, PGE2, NGF, IL-1β, IL-6, and endothelin-1, which sensitize nociceptive
  neurons. Endothelin-1 links to endothelin-A receptors (EAR) on sensory neurons (pro-algesic
  pathway). (4) In return, peptidergic C-fibres release substance P (SP) and CGRP
  to activate keratinocytes through an amplification loop leading to the neuronal
  sensitization. (5) Keratinocyte-released endothelin-1 also links to endothelin-B
  receptors (EBR) on keratinocytes. In response, superficial keratinocytes release
  β-endorphin, which activates μ- and κ-opioid receptors (OR) in FNEs, and inhibits
  pain (analgesic pathway)

  description: Epidermal keratinocytes modulate nociceptive sensory neuron activity.
    Keratinocytes produce both pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive substances, which
    bind to the intra-epidermal free nerve endings (FNEs) to modulate neuronal activity.
    (1) Painful cutaneous injury activates nociceptive FNE. (2) Keratinocytes are
    also exposed to injury. (3) This exposition to injury induces the release of FNE
    activators by keratinocytes, such as ATP, PGE2, NGF, IL-1β, IL-6, and endothelin-1,
    which sensitize nociceptive neurons. Endothelin-1 links to endothelin-A receptors
    (EAR) on sensory neurons (pro-algesic pathway). (4) In return, peptidergic C-fibres
    release substance P (SP) and CGRP to activate keratinocytes through an amplification
    loop leading to the neuronal sensitization. (5) Keratinocyte-released endothelin-1
    also links to endothelin-B receptors (EBR) on keratinocytes. In response, superficial
