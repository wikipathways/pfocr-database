caption: 'Schematic drawing illustrating possible role of Eps8 in coordinating apical
  ES disassembly and BTB restructuring. Left panel: seminiferous epithelium of adult
  rat testes at a relatively static state, with intact cell junctions at the apical
  ES and the BTB, such as stages I–VII and X–XIV of the seminiferous epithelial cycle.
  Actin filaments at the apical ES and the basal ES/TJ at the BTB are tightly packed
  to provide robust support for the junction complexes. The presence of Eps8 plausibly
  contributes to the maintenance of F-actin organization, such as via its actin bundling
  capability. Right panel: a restructuring seminiferous epithelium where apical ES
  disassembly and BTB “restructuring/opening” take place simultaneously, such as at
  stages VIII–IX of the epithelial cycle. At the BTB, down-regulation of Eps8 promotes
  the internalization of occludin-based TJ complexes, thereby destabilizing the BTB
  to facilitate the transit of primary preleptotene spermatocytes. Concomitantly,
  the disruption of the apical ES before elongated spermatid disengagement at spermiation
  is also promoted by a reduced Eps8 steady-state level. In addition, the status of
  the junction integrity at the apical ES and/or BTB is known to be regulated, at
  least in part, by the relative contribution of androgens (e.g., testosterone) and
  estrogens (e.g., estradiol-17β) . Much work is needed in future studies to examine
  the role of these sex hormones on Eps8 and other actin regulatory proteins. Junctional
  complex proteins at the Sertoli cell-elongating/elongated spermatid interface (i.e.,
  apical ES) are α6β1-integrin-laminin-333, nectins-afadins, and cadherins/catenins.
