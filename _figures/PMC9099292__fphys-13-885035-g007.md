caption: Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs validated by qPCR in the
  S10 vs. S13 comparison (A), S10 vs. S16 comparison (B) and S13 vs. S16 comparison
  (C). The square represents the pathway that containing genes. The diamond represents
  the S10 group, the circle represents the S13 group, and the triangle represents
  the S16 group. The shape of the graph is determined by the unigene RPKM values,
  where red represents upregulation, green represents downregulation, and blue represents
  the pathway. The solid line represents a positive correlation, the gray dashed line
  represents a negative correlation, and the purple dashed line indicates the relationship
  between the genes and the pathways they are involved in.
