caption: Lipid sources include the de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway and exogenous
  lipid uptake. In this process, citric acid from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA
  cycle) crosses the mitochondrial membrane and enters the cytosol. Subsequently,
  ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) releases Acetyl-CoA, which plays a crucial role in the
  fatty acid synthesis pathway. Acetyl-CoA is then catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) to form malonyl-CoA (Malony-CoA), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) further catalyzes
  the synthesis of fatty acids and, consequently, lipids. Additionally, fatty acid-binding
  proteins (FABPs) facilitate the conversion of exogenous lipids and lipoproteins
  into lipids. ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FA, fatty acid;
  FABPs, fatty acid-binding proteins; FASN, fatty acid synthase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.
