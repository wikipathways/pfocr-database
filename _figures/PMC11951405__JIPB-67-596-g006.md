caption: Signaling pathways of small peptides (SPs) in pollen tube growth, fertilization,
  and fruit development (A) RALF4 and RALF19 regulate pollen tube growth by interacting
  with BUPS1/2 receptors, which form complexes with ANXUR1/2 (ANX1/2). LLG2 and LLG3
  act as co‐receptors, enhancing the receptor complex activity. This binding activates
  the MARIS signaling pathway and Mildew Resistance Locus O (MLO) proteins, leading
  to Ca²⁺ influx, which maintains pollen tube integrity and prevents premature rupture
  as the pollen tube elongates toward the ovule. Meanwhile, LURE peptides secreted
  by synergid cells guide pollen tubes to the ovule micropyle by forming a gradient
  sensed through the MDIS1–MIK1/MIK2 receptor complex. LURE1 binding induces receptor
  dimerization, activating MIK1 kinase and downstream signaling. PRK6 amplifies LURE
  signaling by interacting with ROPGEFs to activate ROP1, driving cytoskeletal remodeling.
  LIP1 and LIP2 stabilize the receptor complex for micropylar guidance and ensure
  efficient signal transmission to ROPGEFs and PRK6. This cascade reorganizes actin
  and microtubules, enabling pollen tube reorientation along the gradient. LURE signaling
  redistributes PRK6, MDIS1, and LIP1/2 to the pollen tube tip, enhancing sensitivity
  and promoting fertilization. (B) RALF34 competes with RALF4/19 for binding to the
  BUPS1/2–ANXUR1/2 complex, initiating a downstream signaling cascade that triggers
  pollen tube rupture and releases sperm cells for fertilization. EPFL2 and EPFL9
  regulate ovule initiation and fruit growth through the ERECTA family receptors (ER,
  ERL1, ERL2). EPFL2 ensures proper ovule spacing, preventing twin ovule formation,
  while EPFL9 promotes fruit elongation. PSK signals through PSKR1 to regulate fruit
  development by phosphorylating DREB2F, which activates ripening‐related target genes.
  This pathway is critical for pollen germination, tube growth, and subsequent fruit
  ripening. BUPS1/2, Buddha's Paper Seal 1/2; LLG2/3, LORELEI‐like GPI‐anchored proteins;
