caption: MLK4 activates the JNK pathway leading to increased expression and stabilization
  of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p15 to suppress cellular proliferation. LOF mutations
  in MLK4, similar to DAPK3, act in a dominant negative manner to suppress activation
  of WT MLK4. This results in inactivation of the JNK signaling cascade and decreased
  abundance of p21 and p15 and consequently increased cell proliferation.
