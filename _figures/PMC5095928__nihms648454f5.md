caption: A model for TRR-NFκB function in cell competition, incorporating data from
  both competitive contexts. See text for full description.We propose that in both
  Minute- and Myc-induced competitive contexts, loser cells are eliminated through
  a signaling pathway mediated by Spz,TRRs, and NFκB function. Context-and/or genetic-dependent
  interactions that cause Rel activation trigger expression of Hid, whereas those
  activating Dif and Dorsal trigger expression of Rpr. Apoptosis is the ultimate fate
  of both loser populations. Red denotes genes required for Myc-induced competition,
  blue indicates those required for competition in M/+ mosaics, and orange denotes
  shared requirements.
