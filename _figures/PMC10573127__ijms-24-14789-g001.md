caption: Airway epithelial differentiation pathways. The airway epithelium is mainly
  composed of MCCs, SCs, and BCs, as well as more rare cell types including ionocytes,
  NECs, tuft cells, and deuterosomal cells, according to recent human scRNAseq studies
  [29,44]. BCs have the capacity to self-renew and produce all epithelial cell types
  [33]. NOTCH pathway can regulate cell differentiation processes, where up- and downward
  red arrows indicate stimulation and suppression, respectively. Self-renewal basal
  cells are independent of NOTCH, while the activation of NOTCH signaling will determine
  epithelial cell fate toward secretory (club and goblet) or ciliated cells, for which
  the level of NOTCH2 signaling is decisive [9]. Club cells can undergo trans-differentiation
  into ciliated cells, through NOTCH 1/2 pathway inhibition. For each cell (sub)type,
  its function and the most important cellular markers are indicated. TP63, KRT5,
  KRT6C, KRT14 and KRT15 are basal cell markers, while supra-basal cells are distinguished
  by the expression of KRT4, KRT13, KRT16 and KRT23. The deuterosomal cells express
  CDC20B, CCNO, FOXN4, and DEUP1, and mature ciliated cells are distinguished by the
  expression of FOXJ1, MYB, RFX2/3, and TP73. Club cells are characterized by the
  expression of SCGB1A1, and SCGB3A2, and mature goblet cells express SPDEF, MUC5B,
  and MUC5AC. Supra-basal cells can also differentiate into ionocytes (FOXI1+ and
  CFTR+), NECs (PSMD5 and NGF), or tuft cells (POUF2F2+ and TRPM5+). Tuft cells in
  turn can differentiate either to ionocytes or to neuroendocrine cells. While NOTCH
  signaling seems to be involved in ionocytes’ and tuft cells’ differentiation, it
  is still unclear (?) which signaling pathways are involved in NECs’ lineage. Moreover,
  “Hillocks” TP63+/KRT13+ basal cells give rise to SCGB1A1+/KRT13+ club cells [9].
