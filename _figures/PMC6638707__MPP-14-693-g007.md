caption: Model of BSL6‐mediated interference in Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) replication
  in BSL6 transgenic plants. In wild‐type plants, BaMV‐infected cells will trigger
  the silencing pathway. When BaMV RNA enters the cell, replicase (Rep) is translated
  and bound to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR), and host factors, such as heat shock
  protein 90 (Hsp90) (Huang et al., ), are recruited to form the replication complex
  for BaMV replication. Double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed during replication is cleaved
  into 21‐ and 22‐nucleotide BaMV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Lin et al., ) by
  dicer‐like proteins (DCLs) and targeted back to viral RNAs for silencing BaMV RNA
  in infected cells. BaMV siRNAs can be amplified by RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase
  6 (RDR6) to generate secondary siRNAs for further silencing, and can move into neighbouring
  cells as silencing signals. In satBaMV BSL6 transgenic plants, the expression of
  the transgene will down‐regulate the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway of plant
  innate immunity. The existing satBaMV BSL6 transcripts, transcribed from the transgene,
  are highly amplified and outcompete for Rep with BaMV after BaMV infection, although
  host Hsp90 is recruited by BaMV RNA only (Huang et al., ). In addition, BaMV secondary
  siRNAs are generated through the RDR6 pathway, but satBaMV siRNAs are not. Thus,
  satBaMV achieves preferential replication. Therefore, the highly amplified satBaMV
  can mediate resistance to BaMV infection in BSL6 transgenic plants.
