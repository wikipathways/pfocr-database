caption: The cross talk between pyroptosis and apoptosis or necroptosis. a–b Interplay
  between necroptosis and pyroptosis. MLKL is the terminal executioner of necroptosis,
  which is also a key intermedium between necroptosis and pyroptosis. RIPK1-RIPK3
  association or cytosolic ZBP1 activation results in phosphorylation of MLKL, thus
  forming pores on the membrane and engaging necroptosis. Plasma and K+ efflux mediated
  by MLKL can ultimately lead to cellular stress, triggering NLRP3 activation, inflammasome
  assembly, and caspase-1 cleavage, which is the canonical pyroptosis pathway. ZBP1
  can directly activate NLRP3 inflammasome in response to virus infection. Additionally,
  when TNF binding to TNFR on the cell membrane, complex I is assembled and activated,
  further forming ripoptosome complex. Caspase-8 from ripoptosome complex can in turn
  promote the initiation of caspase-3 and -7 to execute GSDME-mediated pyroptosis.
  b–c Interplay between pyroptosis and apoptosis. Caspase family of proteases and
  its targeting downstream molecules connect apoptosis with pyroptosis. In extrinsic
  apoptosis, recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 promotes the initiation of the death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) when death receptor is activated. Then, activated caspase-8
  from DISC can promote the initiation of caspase-3 and -7 and execute GSDME-mediated
  pyroptosis. In intrinsic apoptosis, Bcl-2 family member Bid can be cleaved by caspase-8
  and pyroptosis-inducing caspase-1 into proapoptotic tBID, together with intracellular
  stress, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is induced, subsequently
  triggering cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation and caspase-9 activation,
  which in turn promotes activation of caspase-3 and -7
