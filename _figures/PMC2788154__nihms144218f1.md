caption: Signaling pathways that lead from activated KIT and aggregated FcϵRI to mast
  cell responses. Aggregation of IgE-occupied FcϵRI induces activation of the Src
  family tyrosine kinase Lyn, whereas stem cell factor–induced dimerization of KIT
  induces activation of its intrinsic kinase. Phosphorylation (indicated by red circles)
  of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domains of each of these receptors recruits
  SH2 domain–containing signaling molecules. In the case of FcϵRI, Syk is recruited
  through FcϵRI by ITAMs contained in γ chain cytoplasmic domains. Resulting activation
  of Syk leads to phosphorylation of LAT and LAT2. These proteins then serve as scaffolds
  for multimolecular signaling complexes for the binding of cytosolic adapter molecules,
  such as Gads, Grb2, SLP76, and SHC; guanosine triphosphate exchangers, including
  Sos and Vav1; and the signaling enzymes PLCγ1 and PLCγ2. PLCγ catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of PIP2 to yield diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which, respectively,
  result in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the liberation of intracellular
  calcium. These signals lead to mast cell degranulation and eicosanoid generation
  and contribute to activation of transcription factors required for cytokine and
  chemokine production. In parallel, PI3K is activated after binding to Gab2 on phosphorylation
  of this cytosolic adapter molecule by Fyn, Syk, or both; phosphorylation of the
  p85 adapter subunit of PI3K; and activation of the catalytic subunit by small guanosine
  triphosphate (GTP)–binding proteins. In the case of KIT, the p85 subunit directly
  binds to the phosphorylated molecule. The subsequent formation of membrane-associated
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) results in the recruitment of pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domain–containing signaling molecules, such as Btk and PLD. PI3K-regulated
  pathways serve to enhance/maintain LAT/PLCγ1-regulated degranulation. KIT- and FcϵRI-mediated
  activation of the Ras–Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after
  Sos- and Vav-regulated guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–GTP exchange of Ras contributes
  to these processes. MAPK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling
  also regulates phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation, which leads to the generation
  of eicosanoids. LAT2 can both upregulate and downregulate antigen-mediated responses
  and appears to be required for KIT to enhance FcϵRI-dependent degranulation. In
  addition to its role in mast cell mediator release, KIT signaling regulates mast
  cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration, and adhesion. JAK, Janus
  kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. For other abbreviations,
  please refer to text. This figure is based on one published in the article by Gilfillan
  and Rivera.
