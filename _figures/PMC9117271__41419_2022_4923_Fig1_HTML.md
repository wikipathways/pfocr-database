caption: Apoptosis can be triggered by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. BH3-only
  proteins have crucial roles in intrinsic apoptosis, which can bind to anti-apoptotic
  proteins and inhibit their function, thereby inducing mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP). Afterward, released cytochrome c binds apoptotic peptidase
  activating factor 1 (APAF1) and leads to the formation of apoptosome. The caspase
  9 is activated in this complex, in turn, it activates the executioner caspase 3/7.
  The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by ligand‐receptor binding, and then
  these death receptors can recruit caspase-binding adapter proteins to form the “death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC)”, which activates caspase 8 and downstream effector caspases
  3 and 7. The executioner caspases further cause internucleosomal DNA fragmentation,
  membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation. Macrophages can recognize the ‘eat
  me’ signals on the surface of these bodies, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), to
  mediate efferocytosis. Whereas, lipid metabolism disorder and calcium-phosphate
  imbalance can give rise to phagocytic dysfunction of macrophages and increased release
  of pro-calcific matrix vesicles. Furthermore, apoptotic bodies serve as nucleation
  points for calcium crystals with the deposition of hydroxyapatite. Together, these
  changes lead to vascular mineralization.
