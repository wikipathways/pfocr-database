caption: 'Alteration of synthesis and degradation pathways of glycosphingolipids in
  the physiopathology of HSP. The different steps of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis
  occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus by progressive addition
  of the molecules indicated in the top right panel. Following internalization by
  endocytosis, plasma membrane glycosphinglipids are progressively degraded in lysosome
  into basic building blocks. The products of HSP-mutated genes that are implicated
  in the metabolism of glycosphingolipids are highlighted in red. FA, fatty acids;
  hFA, hydroxylated fatty acids; Cer, Ceramide; Gal-Cer, Galatosyl-ceramide; Glc-Cer,
  Glucosyl-ceramide; Lac-Cer, Lactosyl-ceramide; Sulf: Sulfatides; Sph, Sphingosine;
  FA2H, fatty acid-2-hydroxylase; GBA2, β-glucosidase 2; B4GALNT1, β-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase;
  GALC, Galactosyl-cerebrosidase; ARSA, Arylsulfatase A. It has been proposed that
  some gangliosides could be recycled from the lysosomes using a salvage pathway.
  Whether spatacsin could be implicated in such pathway is still unclear.'
