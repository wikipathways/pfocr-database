caption: 'Model of Rho/F-actin pathway repression by EWS-FLI1 via MRTFB/YAP-1/TEAD
  transcriptional perturbation. A673/TR/shEF: left: EWS-FLI1-low state: EWS-FLI1 binds
  to distal genomic elements of EWS-FLI1-anticorrelated target genes and thereby likely
  hinders MRTFB/YAP-1/TEAD interaction and transcriptional activation of genes involved
  in actin–cytoskeletal structure (TAGLN, TPM-1 and CALD-1) or are involved in binding
  to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and insulin growth factors (IGF; CYR61, CTGF).
  Low expression of these genes might affect cytoskeletal integrity due to compromised
  actin polymerization and upstream signalling via ECM–receptor interactions. As a
  consequence, cells exhibit few focal adhesions and stress fibres (F-actin filaments)
  and F-actin polymerization is reduced.,  Right: upon knockdown of EWS-FLI1 (EWS-FLI1-low),
  expression of MRTFB/YAP-1/TEAD target genes, which regulate cytoskeletal key factors,
  is increased and thereby likely promoting signalling via Rho both upstream and downstream
  of actin polymerization. Consequently, cell morphology is drastically altered with
  increased numbers of focal adhesions and stress fibres as compared to the high EWS-FLI1
  cell state.'
