caption: The diagram of the inhibition of TSLP Signaling by HZ-1127 and TEZE. The
  left panel depicts the canonical TSLP signaling pathway initiated by TSLP binding
  to its receptor complex, consisting of TSLPR and IL-7Rα on the cell surface. This
  interaction activates the JAK1/JAK2 pathway, leading to the phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation of STAT5 and STAT3, which ultimately results in cytokine gene
  expression and subsequent inflammatory response. Right panel demonstrates the inhibitory
  action of HZ-1127, and TEZE as a positive control, on TSLP signaling. HZ-1127 effectively
  blocks the binding of TSLP to its receptor, thereby preventing the downstream activation
  of the JAK/STAT pathway, NF-κB, PI3K, and MAPK pathways, culminating in the suppression
  of cytokine gene expression and the mitigation of the inflammatory response
