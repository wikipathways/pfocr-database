caption: 'The major intracellular pathways underlying the protective effect of metabolism-related
  peptides on DAergic neurons. Insulin: Activation of the Raf1-MEK-MAPK pathway is
  involved in the promotion of protein expression to stimulate the growth and maintenance
  of neurons and synaptic plasticity. The PI3-K-Akt pathway plays a role in apoptosis
  inhibition and cellular activation as well as in the expression of inflammatory
  mediators. GSK3β and NFκB are downstream mediators related to the regulation of
  inflammation in DAergic cells. GLP-1: GLP-1 upregulates intracellular cAMP expression
  and activates PI3-K, which are involved in two main pathways: cAMP-PKA-MAPK and
  PI3-K-AKT-CREB. Leptin: Leptin activates the PI3-K and MAPK-ERK pathways, which
  reduces apoptosis and enhances the survival of DAergic neurons. Leptin also activates
  the MEK-ERK1/2-CREB pathway to protect cells. Leptin increases UCP2 levels to maintain
  mitochondrial functions. Ghrelin: Ghrelin exerts its antioxidative effect by reversing
  Cyt release, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and reducing caspase-3 activation. Ghrelin
  also upregulates UCP-2 and enhances neuroprotection by buffering ROS production.
  Nesfatin-1: Nesfatin-1, whose receptor remains unknown, decreases the activity of
  caspase-3 and activates the C-Raf-ERK1/2 pathway to protect DAergic neurons.'
