caption: 'a Constructed flavonoid homeostasis network of activation and feedback regulation
  mechanisms in mulberry fruits. MYBA-bHLH3-TTG1 regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis,
  and TT2L1/TT2L2-bHLH3/GL3-TTG1 regulate the biosynthesis of PAs. bHLH3 is the key
  component of the regulatory network and participates in the regulation of most structural
  genes. All these MBW complexes activate the expression of MYB4, and then, MYB4 inhibits
  the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs in a competitive manner to prevent plants
  from producing excessive anthocyanins and PAs. MYBF regulates flavonol biosynthesis
  without any partner. An unknown activator may determine bHLH3 expression. b Altered
  pigmentation in mulberry fruits caused by differences in bHLH3 expression. In HG2
  (purple fruits), flavonoid biosynthesis is controlled in an orderly manner by regulators
  in this regulatory network. In BYW (white fruits) and CS (yellow fruits), abnormal
  expression of bHLH3 disrupts this dynamic equilibrium mechanism: MYB4 cannot be
  effectively activated by bHLH3, causing the feedback regulation mechanism to fail
  during fruit pigmentation, and the MBW complexes dependent on bHLH3 cannot effectively
  activate their target genes, thereby reducing flavonoid accumulation. A decrease
  in DFR expression causes carbon flux to the upstream branch, resulting in higher
  proportions of flavonols in CS and BYW than in HG2. Because of the low expression
  of MYBF and the high expression of FNS in CS, blockage of the anthocyanin and flavonol
  pathways diverts carbon flow to the upstream flavone pathway, resulting in the highest
  flavone content in CS'
