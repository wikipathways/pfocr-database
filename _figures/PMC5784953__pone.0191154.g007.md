caption: (A) Recommended methods for specific scenarios based on experimental design,
  available input data, platform density, sample size and expected number of differentially
  expressed genes. (B) The most important deregulated genes in particular methods.
  Individual methods prefer different genes as the most important for pathway deregulation,
  and these preferences represent another factor for optimal method selection. The
  genes are defined mostly by their topological properties (e.g. number of interactions).
  Examples of genes must be interpreted within specific pathway (p53 signalling pathway
  for p53, Non-small cell lung cancer for others), and specific pathway pre-processing
  (graphite). (C) An illustrative example of the most important genes in the Non-small
  cell lung cancer pathway from KEGG database as available in the graphite package.
