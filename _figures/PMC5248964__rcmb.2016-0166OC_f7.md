caption: Schema of putative pathways increasing miR-27a and reducing PPARγ that increase
  ET-1 and endothelial dysfunction in sickle cell disease (SCD). The current findings
  suggest that products of hemolysis in SCD, such as hemin, activate the transcription
  factor ETS1 to stimulate the expression of miR-27a. Increases in miR-27a reduce
  PPARγ, leading to increased ET-1, endothelial dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension
  (PH). Stimulation of PPARγ with pharmacological ligands such as RSG attenuates increases
  in miR-27a and downstream ET-1 levels and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that
  this pathway may provide an opportunity for new therapeutic targeting and intervention
  in SCD-PH.
