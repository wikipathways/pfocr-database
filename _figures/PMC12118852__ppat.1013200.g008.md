caption: During TMUV infection, duTRIM14 specifically targets the TMUV NS1 protein,
  promoting its K27/29-linked ubiquitination at Lys141, leading to proteasomal degradation
  of NS1 and inhibition of TMUV replication. Additionally, duTRIM14 catalyzes K63-linked
  polyubiquitination of duTBK1, which activates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of IRF7. This process triggers the IFN-β signaling pathway, further suppressing
  viral replication. Created in BioRender
