caption: CLUH and astrin-1 form a complex to couple the control of mitochondrial metabolism
  and cell cycle progression. On the one hand, CLUH is required for astrin synthesis
  and for protein stability. Additionally, CLUH promotes mitochondrial anaplerotic
  reactions and OXPHOS function by ensuring CLUH target expression. This provides
  energy and building blocks to increase anabolic pathways like nucleotide synthesis,
  glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and polyamine synthesis required for growth
  in G1 and allowing cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary. Astrin-1, on the
  other hand, regulates CLUH localization, controls metaphase to anaphase progression
  in M phase and inhibits mTORC1.
