caption: a AA stimulation activated NF-κB, which acts as a transcriptional factor
  of miR-382 and promoted miR-382 expression. MiR-382 negatively regulated PTEN by
  combining with 3′UTR of pten. Inhibition of PTEN-activated AKT signaling pathway
  and then played roles in the progression of EMT, release of inflammatory cytokines
  and deposition of ECM. b Proposed the possible mechanism of AKI-to-CKD. AA treatment
  induced tubule injury, which would recovery after moderate tubule redifferentiation
  or would regulate NF-κB/miR-382/PTEN/AKT signaling axis resulting in sustained redifferentiation,
  EMT and expression of profibrotic signaling. In the process, inflammation response
  also promoted EMT process and prevented tubule recovery and finally led to tubule
  atrophy, deposition of ECM and renal interstitial fibrosis.
