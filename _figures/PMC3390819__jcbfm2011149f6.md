caption: Contribution of glucose- and glycogen-derived lactate to support different
  phases of neuronal activation. (A) Early phase. Activation of glutamatergic afferents
  leads to synaptic release of glutamate, AMPA receptor (AMPAR) activation, and generation
  of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) caused by Na+ entry within the postsynaptic
  spine (1). Depolarization propagates to the dendrite and causes opening of voltage-sensitive
  Na+ channels, leading to further Na+ entry. Reestablishment of ion gradients is
  accomplished by the Na+/K+ ATPase (2), which creates considerable energy expenditure.
  As a consequence, oxidative phosphorylation is activated (3) and mitochondrial nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NADH) levels first decrease (). Then, enhanced tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle activity will ensue (4) to supply NADH for oxidative phosphorylation
  and support ATP production. As pyruvate utilization in the TCA cycle increases and
  its cytoplasmic levels decrease, the conditions become favorable for both enhanced
  glucose and lactate use. Surprisingly, activation of AMPA receptors and coupled
  Na+ entry lead to a reduction in glucose uptake and utilization in neurons (5),
  thus further favoring lactate utilization as preferential oxidative substrate (6).
  This would cause a transient drop in extracellular lactate levels as measured in
  vivo. (B) Late phase. Glutamate released in the synaptic cleft is taken up by astrocytes
  to be recycled via the specific glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT1 (1). A large
  Na+ influx caused by glutamate uptake takes place and activates the Na+/K+ ATPase
  (2), glucose transport (3) and (4) glucose utilization in astrocytes. The enhancement
  of aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes first causes a large increase in cytosolic NADH
  that normalizes with the conversion of pyruvate into lactate and its release via
  monocarboxylate transporters expressed on astrocytes (mainly MCT1 and 4) (5). Such
  a lactate release following glutamatergic activation corresponds to the increase
  in extracellular lactate levels measured in vivo. Lactate produced by astrocytes
  during this later phase of activation not only replenishes the extracellular pool
  but also could help sustain neuronal energy needs as activation persists. Metabolic
  events occurring in the early and late phases described above constitute the so-called
  astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle and its importance grows with the degree of glutamatergic
  activation. Such a view is supported by a series of experiments conducted in vivo.
  (C) Intense and prolonged stimulation. On strong and long-lasting stimulation that
  occurs in certain conditions, glucose utilization becomes very important, in part
  due to intense glutamate reuptake in astrocytes, that extracellular glucose levels
  are insufficient to sustain such uptake (1). In such a situation, glycogen present
  in the astrocyte is mobilized to provide the necessary glycosyl units (2) as previously
  demonstrated in vivo. Glycolysis is the predominant pathway (3) and lactate is produced
  (4) to maintain the high glycolytic rate. Resynthesis of glycogen will cause additional
  glucose uptake that might contribute to create a mismatch between glucose utilization
  and oxygen consumption, a phenomenon known as ‘uncoupling.' Taken from .
