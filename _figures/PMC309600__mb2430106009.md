caption: Working model for Smad6 functions in BMP signaling. The BMP signaling pathway
  is illustrated with points of Smad6 action. Smad6, an immediate-early gene product
  of BMP signaling, inhibits R-Smad activation and R-Smad-Smad4 heteromerization and
  directly represses transcription in the nucleus. RI, BMP type I receptor; RII, BMP
  type II receptor; GTF, general transcription factors such as TATA-binding proteins
  and associated factors.
