caption: Model explaining how PAs are mostly composed of epicatechin subunits in plants
  such as M. truncatula (red shadow) or catechin subunits in H. vulgare (blue shadow).
  In M. truncatula, the separate contribution of ANS and LDOX in parallel pathways
  provides starter and extension units via dual ANR activity. To generate the direct
  precursor of extension units, flav-3-en-3,4-diol is reduced to 2,3-cis-3,4-cis-leucocyanin
  by ANR. Water elimination from C-4 and subsequent protonation at C-3 may result
  in the carbocation that can react with nucleophilic centers such as C-8 on flavan-3-ols
  as proposed (). Nonenzymatic conjugation of leucocyanidin and cysteine leads to
  flavan-3-ol-cysteine, representing a potential regulatory mechanism to control the
  level of carbocation and PA polymerization (). In barley seeds, possession of an
  ANR enzyme lacking ability to produce 2,3-cis-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin and (−)-epicatechin
  is consistent with accumulation of catechin-based PAs via conjugation of 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin
  and (+)-catechin.
