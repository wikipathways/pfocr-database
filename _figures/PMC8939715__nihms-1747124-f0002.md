caption: Transdermal stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagal nerve of the
  ear modulates vagal afferent inputs which activate regions of the brain such as
  the locus coeruleus, the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex, the postcentral gyrus,
  the posterior cingulate gyrus and the insula cortex. This can modulate perception
  and mood (1). Projection via nucleus tractus solitary (NTS) increases activity of
  neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), increases inhibition of sympathetic
  pacemaker neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and increases vagal
  activity in the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Increased vagal activity and reduced sympathetic
  neural activity (SNA) to the sinus atrial node reduces heart rate (2). Vagal stimulation
  mobilizes the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through sympathetic axons supplying
  the spleen. It increases norepinephrine (NE) release in the spleen. NE activates
  beta2 receptors expressed in splenic macrophages and attenuates cytokine production
  when signaling through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 7 subunit (alpha7nAchR)
  is present (3). All these effects are beneficial for patients with postural tachycardia
  syndrome (POTS).
