caption: Diverse flux modes interconnecting glycolysis and PPP in different metabolic
  situations (modified from ). Major metabolites are shown in red box and the stoichiometry
  of each mode is denoted. The PPP and glycolysis are reversibly linked by bi-directional
  transketolase (TKT) and transaldolase (TALDO1), as shown below.
