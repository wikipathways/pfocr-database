caption: Proposed model for progesterone and retinoid action in endometrium and endometriosis.
  The deficient genes and pathways in endometriosis compared with normal endometrium
  were indicated using arrows and dotted lines. In endometrium, progesterone action
  is mediated by PR in stromal cells. Blood vessels that transport progesterone (P4)
  are adjacent to stromal cells. Stromal PR activated by circulating P4 produces a
  number of paracrine factors including RA. RA and other paracrine factors stimulate
  differentiation and oppose estradiol (E2)-dependent proliferation in neighboring
  epithelial cells. Moreover, RA stimulates the enzyme, HSD17B2, which converts biologically
  active E2 to estrogenically weak estrone (E1). On the other hand, significantly
  lower stromal PR expression causes deficient formation of RA and other paracrine
  factors. Consequently, epithelial cells differentiate poorly and do not express
  HSD17B2, leading to accumulation of E2. The mechanisms for retinoid transport between
  these two cell types are not well understood. STRA6 in endometrial stromal cells
  serve as a receptor for the uptake of RBP-bound retinol from the circulation. Retinol
  is converted to RA, which is then transported to nuclear RARs by the shuttling protein
  named cellular RA binding protein-2 (CRABP2). RA-RAR enhances differentiation and
  apoptosis in endometrial stromal cells. PR, in a ligand-independent fashion, induces
  stromal STRA6 and CRABP2. Deficiency of PR, STRA6, and CRABP2 disrupts this pathway
  in endometriosis. Moreover, expression of the RA-metabolizing enzymes CYP26B1 and
  CYP26A1 in stromal and epithelial compartments are perturbed in endometriosis. 4OH-RA,
  4-Hydroxy-RA.
