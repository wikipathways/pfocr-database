caption: The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway is regulated by Ras (indicated in green
  ovals), as well as various upstream growth factor receptors (indicated in purple)
  and PTEN indicated in a black rectangle. Sites where various small molecule inhibitors
  suppress this pathway are indicated by red octagons. The downstream transcription
  factors regulated by this pathway are indicated in yellow diamond shaped outlines.
  The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway also interacts with key proteins involved in protein
  translation (indicated in green ovals). The two pathways aid in the assembly of
  the protein translation complex (indicated in purple ovals) responsible for the
  translation of “weak” mRNAs (indicated in a red line folding over on itself) important
  in the prevention of apoptosis. Other key proteins inactivated by PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
  pathway (e.g., TSC, PTEN, beta-catenin, Foxo and 4E-BP1 are indicated by black ovals,
  diamonds and rectangles. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Blocked
  black arrows indicating inactivating events in pathways. GF = growth factor, GFR
  = growth factor receptor.
