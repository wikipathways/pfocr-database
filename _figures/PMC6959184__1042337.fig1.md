caption: The role of MYD88 signaling in normal physiology and lymphomagenesis. Recognition
  of pathogens by TLR, IL1R, and IL-18R induces an immune response through activation
  of MYD88 and generates the myddosome complex with IRAK4 and IRAK1 or IRAK2, which
  is stabilized by HSP110. IRAK1 and IRAK2 activate the MAPK and NF-κB pathways through
  TRAF6 and TAK1, causing proliferation and survival of B cells. MYD88(L265P) allows
  for increased formation of the myddosome complex, preferentially with IRAK1, and
  constitutively activates the NF-κB pathway. In addition, the formation of the My-T-BCR
  supercomplex leads to increased activation of mTOR and the CBM complex, promoting
  lymphomagenesis. Lastly, constitutively active NF-κB increases autocrine signaling
  of IL-6 and IL-10, which further promote B-cell proliferation and survival via the
  alternative JAK/STAT signaling cascade.
