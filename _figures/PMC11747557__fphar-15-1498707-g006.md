caption: The active ingredients of Radix Codonopsis exert anticancer effects in gastric
  and livercancer. Stigmasterol was shown to inhibit tumor growth in mice. It was
  found that theincrease of IFN-y+ CD8+ T cells and Treg cells and the upregulation
  of Caspase3, Bax and P53 expression led to the death of tumor cells. luteolin can
  inhibit the proliferation, invasionand promote apoptosis of gastric cancer cells
  by inhibiting cMet/Akt/ERK signaling pathway
