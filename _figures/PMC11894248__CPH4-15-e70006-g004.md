caption: Scheme illustrating potential mechanisms by which activation of the p21 activated
  kinase (Pak1) may shift Hippo signaling to an OFF state suppressing pathological
  signaling by modifying upstream signals to Yap/Taz. As shown, signals engaging the
  Hippo pathway include GPCR activation by ligands and mechano‐signaling that shift
  from ON to OFF states. Shown are the effects of Pak1 activation to shift to an OFF
  state in which homeostasisis restored
