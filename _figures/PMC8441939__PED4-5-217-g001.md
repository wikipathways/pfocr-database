caption: Basic molecular mechanisms of innate immune cells in response to SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection. (1) Cells of the innate immune recognize pathogen‐associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), like viral proteins and double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA), through transmembrane
  or intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll‐Like receptors
  (TLRs) or RIG‐I‐like receptors (RLRs) consisting of the retinoic acid‐inducible
  gene‐I (RIG‐I) and the melanoma differentiation‐associated protein 5 (MDA5). (2)
  This recognition leads to the activation of the transcription factors, nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF‐κB), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7, resulting in the
  expression of interferons (IFNs) α/β. (3) The binding of INF‐α/β to interferon‐alpha/beta
  receptor (INFAR) activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which leads to (4) the
  expression of interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs), by the signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT2 and IRF9, and (5) finally to release of different
  cytokines, chemokines and anti‐viral proteins. The figure was designed by the biorender
  in silico tool (https://app.biorender.com/).
