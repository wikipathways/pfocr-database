caption: Conceptualization of mechanisms underlying immune defenses in oyster hemocytes
  during challenge by Vibrio spp. of differential virulence. V. alginolyticus WT challenge
  gives rise to accumulation of  and H2O2, resulting in upregulation of p53 target
  protein-mediated hemocyte apoptosis, along with an increase in intracellular cGMP.
  V. alginolyticus △vscC infection leads to attenuation of cellular defense of the
  host, along with lower levels of apoptosis. In addition, sGC-cGMP signaling pathway
  was specifically downregulated during attenuated V. alginolyticus △vscC strain infection.
  Interestingly, Toll-like receptor 6 were significantly upregulated during V. alginolyticus
  △vscC infection, which transduce immune signals for further elimination of pathogens
  through immune effector molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (, ). Solid
  lines, regulatory mechanisms experimentally verified in this study; dotted lines,
  conjectural conclusions from the proteomic data.
