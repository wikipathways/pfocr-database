caption: Diagram showing the interactions of the cell signaling studied in sensitive
  and resistant lines. Signaling in PX-866 sensitive tumors comes from an increased
  reliance on the PI-3-kinase pathway, arising from aberrant activation through growth
  factors (GF) or mutated components of the pathway itself (*). Tumors with an activated
  Ras protein show a minimal response to inhibition of the PI-3-kinase pathway due
  to a shared reliance on alternate signaling pathways including the Raf and RalGDS
  pathways.

  activity of the inhibitor PX-866 while oncogenic Ras is a dominant predictor for
  resistance.
