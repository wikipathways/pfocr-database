caption: Experimental data suggests that pro-phagocytic signals (including calreticulin,
  Mfg-e8 and Mertk) are reduced in atherosclerosis due to inflammation, post-translational
  modifications and/or genetic variability. Exacerbating this loss of ‘eat me’ signaling
  is a concomitant upregulation of the CD47-Sirp-α ‘don’t eat me’ pathway, which furthers
  decreases the ‘edibility’ of cells within the necrotic core. The end result is that
  apoptotic cells in the growing plaque becomes poor substrates for phagocytic cells
  such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Such uncleared cells become secondarily
  necrotic and release additional proinflammatory stimuli, thus promoting a positive
  feedback loop.
