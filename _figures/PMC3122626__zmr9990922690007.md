caption: 'The C. neoformans life cycle. C. neoformans exists most commonly as a budding
  yeast; however, it is capable of undergoing a dimorphic transition to filamentous
  growth by two main differentiation pathways: mating and monokaryotic fruiting. The
  mating pathway is initiated, under nutrient-limiting conditions, with the fusion
  of haploid cells of opposite mating types to produce dikaryotic filaments. During
  this time the two parental nuclei migrate coordinately in the hyphae, a septum forms
  to separate the cells, one nucleus is transferred to the penultimate hyphal cell
  via a clamp connection, and the clamp cell and hyphal cell fuse. During this hyphal
  growth, blastospores can bud from the hyphae and divide mitotically in the yeast
  form. Some hyphal cells can enlarge and form chlamydospores. As the basidium continues
  to develop, meiosis occurs, where eventually four chains of basidiospores are produced.
  The second pathway regulating morphogenesis, monokaryotic fruiting, occurs when
  haploid spores produce filaments and basidiospores in response to severe nitrogen
  starvation or water deprivation in the absence of a mating partner. Cells of one
  mating type form diploid monokaryotic hyphae, where rudimentary clamp connections
  are formed, which do not fuse to the preceding cell. Blastospores and chlamydospores
  can also form. At the stage of basidium development, meiosis occurs, and haploid
  basidiospores are produced in four chains. Finally, C. neoformans is capable of
  forming extremely large polyploid cells, referred to as “titan cells” or “giant
  cells,” in a human host. Microscopy images of the various stages of the C. neoformans
  life cycle are included beside their cartoon representations. Red circles represent
  MATα nuclei, blue circles represent MATa nuclei, purple circles represent diploid
  nuclei with a/α content, and gray circles represent either MATα or MATa nuclei.
