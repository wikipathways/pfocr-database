caption: Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis is regulated by both canonical and noncanonical
  signaling pathway. (A) Canonical inflammasome pathway (left) constitute a Nod-like
  receptor (NLRP3), the adaptor protein ASC and pro-caspase-1, which converts pro-IL-1β
  into its active form. Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to unleash the NT-GSDMD,
  which mediates bioactive IL-1β release and ultimately causes cell pyroptosis ().
  (B) Cytosolic LPS released from Gram-negative bacteria () and the extracellular
  protozoan Eh can trigger the activation of caspase-4 (), leading to activation of
  the noncanonical signaling pathway (right). Activated caspase-4 in turn, cleaves
  GSDMD in a similar fashion as canonical caspase-1 to mediate the secretion of mature
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (). NINJ1 is a cell-surface protein that contains two
  transmembrane domains and is a mediator of plasma membrane rupture that can release
  pro-inflammatory cytokines ().
