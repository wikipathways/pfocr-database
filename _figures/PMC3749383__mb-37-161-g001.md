caption: The C. neoformans HOG pathway. The HOG pathway consists of multiple signaling
  components and is involved in a variety of stress responses, including osmotic,
  oxidative, and heavy metal stresses, breaches of cell wall integrity, and anti-fungal
  drug responses. Following exposure to an environmental cue, signals are transmitted
  to downstream genes of the HOG pathway via a two-component-like phosphorelay system
  and a HOG MAPK module composed of Ssk2 MAPK kinase kinase, Pbs2 MAPK kinase, and
  Hog1 MAPK.
