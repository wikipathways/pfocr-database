caption: Schematic view of a hypothesis that the crosstalk of AR signaling pathway
  with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway facilitate de novo synthesis of cholesterol via activation
  of SREBPs and thereafter the androgen (testosterone) production increases in a neuroblastoma
  cell. In view of this hypothesis, a statin in cooperation with abiraterone acetate
  inhibits cholesterol and androgen production and therefore they turn on a repression
  of AR-SCAP-SREBPs-HMGCR-Cholosterol-CYP17A1-Androgen positive feedback loop. VEGF-mediated
  angiogenesis in MYCN-amplified NB cells depends on PI3K/Akt-driven signaling that
  most likely bypasses mTOR (), while inhibition of AR signaling by combined statins
  with AA is likely independent of MYCN status. Yellow arrow, activation, induction,
  up-regulation, or directions of movements; red drumstick, inhibition; dashed blue
  arrow, synthetic route of cholesterol and androgen under the control of key enzymes.
  HMGCS, HMGCR, FDPS, and CYP17A1, all of them are transcriptionally regulated by
  SREBP-n (N-terminal of SREBPs); SRE, sterol response element; ARE, androgen receptor
  response element.
