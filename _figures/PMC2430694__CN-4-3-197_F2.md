caption: Inflammatory mediators and intracellular signalling pathways modulating TRPV1.NGF
  and other mediators activating tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors promote the insertion
  of TRPV1 into the membrane, from a pool located in subcellular vesicles, via a pathway
  in which PI3K plays an early role while the downstream tyrosine kinase Src activates
  trafficking to the membrane by phosphorylating Y199 in the N-terminal tail of TRPV1.
  These receptors also couple to a lesser extent to TRPV1 via PLCγ and PKCε. Seven-transmembrane
  G-protein coupled receptors activated by a range of inflammatory mediators, including
  bradykinin and ATP, activate PLCβ and consequently PKCε, which enhances the activity
  of TRPV1 in the surface membrane by phosphorylating S502 and S800. Prostaglandins
  PGE2 and PGI2 activate EP and IP receptors, which couple to PKA and PKCε. Glutamate
  (and probably other agonists such as bradykinin) appears to act at least in part
  via an indirect route in which the production of arachidonic acid (AA) leads to
  the synthesis of prostaglandins via the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway and activation
  of prostaglandin receptors.
