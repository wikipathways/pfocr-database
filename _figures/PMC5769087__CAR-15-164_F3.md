caption: 'Mapping of meta-analysis data onto biochemical pathways. Several metabolic
  and synaptic pathways are depicted. Metabolic pathways include anaplerosis, glycolysis,
  and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), all shown as boxes. The synaptic pathways
  include the cholinergic (boxed), glutamatergic (boxed) and GABA. The relevant metabolic
  enzymes and CSF metabolites and amino acids were mapped to these biochemical pathways,
  with increases (green arrows) or decreases (red arrows), and significant changes
  denoted with their p-values. Note: for simplicity, several additional sources of
  glutamate are not depicted e.g. from the TCA cycle. For enzyme data lacking standard
  deviation, these values were imputed. The GDH fold change based on 1 publication
  [].'
