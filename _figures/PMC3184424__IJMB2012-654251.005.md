caption: Proposed model of functions of N-glycosylation in A. fumigatus. Proteins
  that are required for cell wall synthesis or cell wall stress sensing require N-glycosylation
  for their proper folding, localization, and function. Disruption of N-glycosylation
  in A. fumigatus results in misfolding and degradation of these proteins, which thus
  causes cell wall defects and then leads to the activation of the Rho-type GTPases
  (Rsr1p/Bud1p-Cdc42p-Rho1p-) mediated CWI pathway to compensate for cell wall defects.
  Meanwhile activation of the CDC42 in the CWI pathway also activates SepA, an upstream
  component of actin rearrangement, leading to abnormalities in polarized growth.
