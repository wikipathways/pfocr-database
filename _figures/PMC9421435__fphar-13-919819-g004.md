caption: Macropinocytosis in the tumor microenvironment. Macropinocytosis in CAFs
  provides PDAC with a source of amino acids, while CDEs taken up by cancer cells
  through pathways similar to macropinocytosis promote tumor growth. Neutral lipids
  accumulating in lung neutrophils are transferred to metastatic tumor cells via the
  macropinocytosis-lysosome pathway, enhancing their survival and proliferation. Nab-paclitaxel
  absorbed via macropinocytosis enhances the polarization of M1-type macrophages and
  the inhibition of tumor cells. Endothelial cells in PCs have characteristics that
  facilitate macropinocytosis that promotes cancer growth. Macropinocytosis by BMSCs
  is important in cancer progression via uptake of exosomes.
