caption: Defective viral genome (DVGs) are sensed by the RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I
  and MDA5 and activate the downstream signaling component MAVS (1). MAVS signaling
  leads to the production of TNFR2, TRAF1, IFN, and TNF (2). IFN and TNF are secreted
  to act in an autocrine or paracrine manner (3). In DVG-high cells expressing TNFR2
  and TRAF1, a prosurvival pathway is activated and virus persistence is established.
  In cells high in standard virus genome but with few or no DVGs the TNFR1 pathway
  is activated leading to cell death (4).IFN: Interferon; MAVS: Mitochondria antiviral-signaling
  protein.
