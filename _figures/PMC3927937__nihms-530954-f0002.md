caption: 'A representative MLL fusion protein complex is shown that recruits a transcriptional
  activation complex. Varieties of this complex have been termed EAP [], SEC [] and
  AEP []. Included in the recruitment are p-TEFb and the histone H3K79 methyltransferase
  DOT1l. Menin and PAFc bind directly to MLL fusion proteins, aiding in target recognition.
  BRD4 associates with PAFc and is required for MLL fusion protein function. GSK3
  is shown associated with Axin and APC, which are involved in several signaling pathways
  including the WNT/β-catenin pathway. FLT3 activates several signaling pathways,
  including the Ras pathway that cooperates with MLL fusion proteins leading to leukemia.
  Compounds known to inhibit some of these processes and protein interactions are
  shown.ac: Acetylation; me: Methylation; MLL: Mixed-lineage leukemia; PAFc: PAF complex.'
