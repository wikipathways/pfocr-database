caption: '(A) Canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. When WNT signaling is OFF (top), cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is phosphorylated by a destruction complex comprising of APC, AXIN, GSK-3β,
  and CK1α [,]. This phosphorylation marks it for proteasomal degradation, and consequently
  it is unavailable to bind to LEF/TCF elements in the nucleus to drive transcription
  of target genes [,]. When WNT signaling is ON, WNT ligands bind to LRP and Frizzled
  receptors leading to the destabilization of the destruction complex by a mechanism
  that may involve DVL protein [,]. The degradation complex is, thus, unable to phosphorylate
  and degrade cytoplasmic β-catenin [,]. β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and
  then enters the nucleus to bind to TCF/LEF elements and drive transcription of WNT
  target genes [,]. (B) Direct interplay of TERT and β-catenin signaling. β-catenin
  enhances transcription of TERT by binding to its promoter region []. In mouse ES
  cells, this β-catenin-TERT interaction is facilitated by Klf4 []; another study
  showed that β-catenin induced an increase in TERT mRNA and telomerase activity is
  dependent on TCF4 binding to TERTp []. TERT modulates WNT signaling by interacting
  with BRG1 (a chromatin-remodeling protein; “?” indicates uncertainty as some groups
  did not observe this association), binding to the promoter of WNT responsive genes,
  and acting as a co-factor []. This transcriptional upregulation of WNT target genes
  by TERT is independent of its catalytic activity []. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; and
  DVL, disheveled.'
