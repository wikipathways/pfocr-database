caption: Transcriptional changes of genes involved in basic metabolism in Bgt during
  asexual development on Chancellor. DEGs are shown in red font. The relative expression
  levels at 3, 4, and 5 dpi are indicated using heat maps below or aside these genes.
  Solid and dotted arrows indicate one-step and multiple-step reactions during the
  catalytic process, respectively. The detail information of these genes is listed
  in Supplementary Table . AMY, α-amylase; FCK, FGGY carbohydrate kinase; SUC, sucrase;

  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; UGPase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase;
  GYS, glycogen synthase; GBE, glycogen branching enzyme; SGI, self-glucosylating
  initiator of glycogen synthesis; XK, xylulose kinase; TKT, transketolase; TAT, transaldolase;
  KGD, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; IDH, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; ACO, aconitase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase;
  SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FR, fumarase; COX, cytochrome c oxidase complex; COQ4,
  ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ4; COb2, cytochrome b2 L-lactate cytochrome-c
  oxidoreductase; ICL, isocitratelyase; MS, malate synthase; KAT, β-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase;
  MFP, multifunctional enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway
  (carrying putative function of enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase); ECI, enoyl CoA isomerase; PDCR, peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA
