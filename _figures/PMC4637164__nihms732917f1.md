caption: Activation of the complement cascade and its role in tumorigenesis. The complement
  cascade can be activated via the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway; each
  of which results in the production of tumorigenic complement proteins. C3, C3a,
  C5, C5a, C9, and the membrane attack complex (MAC). Many of these complement fragments
  have been implicated as pro-tumorigenic molecules since they can enhance tumor angiogenesis
  or inhibit apoptosis, and thus facilitate tumor progression.
