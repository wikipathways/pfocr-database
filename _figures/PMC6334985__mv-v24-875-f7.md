caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) Core Analysis downstream effects depicts
  protein enrichments within our total retinal phosphoproteome across the top five
  retina-specific components of a larger network of proteins categorized within IPA
  under “Ophthalmic Disease”. These proteins can be found in Appendix 1. Each protein
  network is displayed by individual function (the single item listed on the right
  side) and geographic distribution within the cell. These graphics are intended to
  aid researchers to identify proteins of interest as they relate to ophthalmic pathologies.
  The five retinal networks are: (A) Abnormal morphology of the retina; # of molecules:
  99, P < 4.28E-08. B: Abnormal morphology of photoreceptors; # of molecules: 50,
  P < 8.36E-09. C: *Retinal Degeneration; # of molecules: 71, P < 4.09E-06. D: *Degeneration
  of photoreceptors; # of molecules: 42, P < 2.27E-06. E: Abnormal electrophysiology
  of the eye; # of molecules: 46, P < 6.52E-09. *graphic contains proteins with z-scores
  high enough for IPA to predict signaling effects (blue lines, which also represent
  an inhibitory effect), whereas gray lines reflect no predicted effect, and yellow
  lines indicate findings are inconsistent with the state of downstream molecule.
  Color intensity of protein node reflects expression ratio magnitude (here, Sequest-HT
  score).'
