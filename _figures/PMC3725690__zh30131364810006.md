caption: Working model for the NOX dependence of TNF-α production by the liver following
  I/R injury. We propose that the hepatocyte is one of the first cell types to respond
  to I/R injury by secreting low levels of NOX1/2-dependent TNF-α, priming Kupffer
  cells to mount an increased inflammatory response including high levels of TNF-α
  production. In this context, both hepatocyte Rac1/Nox1 and/or Rac1/Nox2 can contribute
  to ROS production by the hepatocyte, which activates c-Src and NF-κB pathways to
  induce TNF-α production by the hepatocyte. As in other cell types (), c-Src in the
  hepatocyte appears to potentiate H/R-induced NOX-mediated ROS production in the
  hepatocyte. On the basis of our Kupffer cell-depletion experiments on the various
  NOX KO backgrounds, we propose that, in vivo, Kupffer cell-derived factors repress
  a partially NOX2-dependent pathway (labeled “Anti-inflammatory”) that otherwise
  would inhibit NOX1 activity in the liver. In vivo, this anti-inflammatory pathway
  may limit NOX1 activity in hepatocytes. In cultured primary hepatocytes (i.e., ex
  vivo), where this extrinsic factor is absent, NOX1 predominates as the pathway to
  activate TNF-α following H/R in the absence of other hepatic cell types. In NOX1
  KO mice, NOX2 in the hepatocyte compensates for the loss of NOX1, and I/R responses
  are similar to WT animals. In NOX2 KO mice, NOX1 can still lead to low levels of
  acute-phase TNF-α production following I/R; however, the amplification of proinflammatory
  responses by the Kupffer cells is absent since NOX2 is the predominant NOX in this
  cell type. In Nox1/2 double-KO mice, ROS-dependent signaling that activates much
  of the TNF-α response following I/R is absent. In WT mice lacking Kupffer cells,
  a NOX2-dependent anti-inflammatory state is induced by the lack of Kupffer cell-secreted
  proinflammatory factors, and I/R-mediated TNF-α responses are attenuated. In NOX1
  KO animals lacking Kupffer cells, the NOX2-dependent anti-inflammatory state is
  maintained, whereas Kupffer cell proinflammatory contributions are eliminated, leading
  to diminished I/R-mediated plasma TNF-α levels. In NOX2 KO Kupffer cell depleted
  animals, the NOX2-dependent anti-inflammatory state is no longer present and this
  transitions to a proinflammatory state raising both the baseline and I/R-induced
  TNF-α production by hepatocytes and potentially other non-Kupffer hepatic cell types.
  In this case (the absence of NOX2 and Kupffer cells), NOX1 activity may increase
  in the hepatocyte and/or other cell types, leading to enhanced NOX1-dependent production
  of TNF-α. In NOX1/2 double-KO animals depleted for Kupffer cells, the proinflammatory
  state caused by absence of both NOX2 and Kupffer cells is attenuated since NOX1
  is not present to induce TNF-α production.

  description: Working model for the NOX dependence of TNF-α production by the liver
    following I/R injury. We propose that the hepatocyte is one of the first cell
