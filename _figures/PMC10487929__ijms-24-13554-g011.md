caption: Downstream effect analysis of molecules downstream ACE2 and upstream of the
  NISP in the network connectivity pathway map of ACE2’s downstream effects of simulated
  SARS-CoV-2 infection on predicted activity of SNCA and PD. Downstream effect analysis
  was performed on the intermediary, computing an overall p-value of 0.000027 and
  an overall z-score of −4.199345911
