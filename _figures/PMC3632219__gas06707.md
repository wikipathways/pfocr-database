caption: Proposed roles of PLCβ1 in degradation of endocannabinoids at implantation
  sites. (A) FAAH expression at the implantation sites can be stimulated by (1) the
  blastocyst directly (), (2) ovarian steroid hormones (), or through (3) up-regulation
  by PLCβ1, which can also act (4) via the estrogen pathway (as demonstrated here).
  PLCβ1 is involved in both the up-regulation of (5) MAGL (as suggested here) and
  (6) COX2 (). FAAH then degrades anandamide, while both MAGL and COX2 degrade 2-AG
  (). (B) In the KO uterus, failure of endocannabinoid degradation contributes to
  the implantation block in these mice, demonstrating a key role for PLCβ1 in the
  degradation of endocannabinoids during implantation.
