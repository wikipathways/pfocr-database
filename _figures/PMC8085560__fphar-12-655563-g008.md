caption: Diagram of metabolic pathway interaction network. The pathway analysis was
  performed with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg)
  and the picture was generated by Cytoscape. The bigger node represents more pathways
  connection. Red nodes represent pathway impact factors greater than 0.1 (Pathway
  impact >0.1), green nodes represent pathway impact factors greater than 0.05 (Pathway
  impact >0.05), and pink nodes represent pathway impact factors less than 0.05 (Pathway
  impact <0.05).
