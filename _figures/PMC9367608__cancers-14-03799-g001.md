caption: Metabolic landscape in PDAC. (1) To promote glucose uptake in PDAC cells,
  KRAS and HIF1 upregulate the GLUT family of genes and other genes associated with
  glycolysis. While a portion of the glycolytic cascade is used to fuel oxidative
  phosphorylation and the production of ATP, or alternatively to promote lactate,
  which helps to create an acidic microenvironment, another branch of the process
  is directed toward the PPP pathway to provide precursors for nucleotide and amino
  acid biosynthesis. (2) Cellular redox homeostasis and energy generation are both
  regulated by amino acid metabolism. Glutamine is transformed into glutamate and
  aspartate, which are then transported to the mitochondria to maintain redox balance.
  (3) Citrate is shuttled from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm to stimulate the
  de novo lipid synthesis pathway, and at the same time, redox processes are balanced
  by NADPH–NADP+ conversion. This process activates the lipid synthesis pathway. In
  addition, exogenous lipid intake is boosted to meet the need for nutrients for rapid
  proliferation. (4) Different metabolites/nutrients, such as Ala and Pro, generated
  from collagen degradation or PSC secretion and transformed into pyruvate, are supplied
  to PDAC cells by the tumor microenvironment.
