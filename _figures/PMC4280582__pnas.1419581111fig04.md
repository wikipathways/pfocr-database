caption: 'Schematic representation of the HTRA2 protein and its activation against
  mitochondrial stress. (A) Locations of all reported mutations in HTRA2 in persons
  with essential tremor or Parkinson disease. The full-length HTRA2 protein consists
  of a transmembrane domain (TM; residues 105–124), a conserved catalytic trypsin-like
  serine protease domain (Tryp_SPc; residues 178–342), and a C-terminal PDZ domain
  (residues 363–445). Phosphorylation sites are at Ser142 and Ser400. (B) Oxidative
  stress results in the activation of p38 stress kinase pathway. In HTRA2, p38 phosphorylates
  serine at residue 142 in a PINK1-dependent manner; CDK5 phosphorylates serine at
  residue 400, increasing the proteolytic activity of HTRA2. Active HTRA2 induces
  stress-responsive caspases. PINK1 also recruits Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin protein
  ligase, from cytosol to mitochondria to induce mitophagy. Red diamonds represent
  phosphorylation sites at residues 142 and 400. P, phosphorylation. Adapted by permission
