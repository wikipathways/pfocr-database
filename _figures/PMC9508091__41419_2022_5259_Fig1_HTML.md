caption: The active oncogenic KRAS mutant triggers glycolysis for energy generation
  and building block biosynthesis and shunting into the nonoxidative arm of the pentose
  phosphate pathway for nucleic acid biosynthesis and the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis through upregulation of key enzymes
  in glycolysis. In addition, micropinocytosis and autophagy ensure that mutant KRAS
  cancer cells obtain energy and biosynthetic building blocks from the microenvironment.
