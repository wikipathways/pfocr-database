caption: Membrane dynamics processes in host cells that are involved in the life cycle
  of viral infection. The schematic representation of a cell and the different intracellular
  membrane-compartments, constitutive or putative sites formed by viruses to accomplish
  their infection processes, are shown. The non-regenerative viral membrane of enveloped
  viruses and the dynamics cell-host membranes play an important role during early
  infection process, since these two opposed membranes need to fuse, either at cell-surface
  or in an endocytic route (clathrin-, caveolae- or pinocytosis-dependent), to promote
  viral entry and infection. Endocytosis is initiated at the plasma membrane and progress
  through early and late endosomes, where some viruses replicate and are recycled
  back to the plasma membrane or transported to lysosomes to complete the life cycle.
  In the case of HIV-1, this enveloped virus requires Arf6-membrane dynamics to efficiently
  fuse with plasma membrane and promote entry and infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes
  (Asterisk scheme and ). The non-endocytic route followed by HIV-1 during early infection
  is decisive to establish viral latent infection. Once inside the cell, many viruses
  accomplish their replication process through exploiting or modulating membrane traffic,
  and generating specialized compartments to assure viral survival, such as Viral
  Factories (VF), multivesicular bodies (MVB), double-membrane compartments, budding
  on plasma membrane and exosomes (it is conceivable that some viruses may actually
  be released as exosomes ). These membrane structures, cell-constitutive or arranged
  by the different viral proteins, are required for viral-gene replication, morphogenesis,
  export, viral maturation and release from cell-surface, and also serve to evade
  the immune responses against viral genomes. Viral proteins could enter the secretory
  pathway by co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; only
  a part of the perinuclear ER is shown), to be further transported from the ER to
  the Golgi complex in vesicles and in a coatomer protein complex (COP) II-dependent
  manner. Viral complexes formed inside MVBs, in communication with vesicles, mitochondria,
  Golgi cisternae and ER-membranes, could be transported through the Golgi network
  to the plasma membrane to be released as viral particles. Viral budding of enveloped
  viruses is mainly under the control of the activity of ESCRT-III complexes that
  are recruited to the site of viral release by ESCRT-I or Alix proteins that interacts
  with matrix viral proteins located on cell-surface.
