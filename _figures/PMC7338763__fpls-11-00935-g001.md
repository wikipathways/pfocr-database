caption: 'Schematic representation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) related metabolic
  pathways in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate malic enzyme (NADP-ME) type
  C4Flaveria species In MC, PEP is used as a substrate for PEPC catalyzed carboxylation
  (blue lines). It is also a substrate of the shikimate pathway (SP) in chloroplasts,
  which is expected to exist in both MC and BSC (purple lines); moreover, phosphoenolpyruvate
  transporter (PEP) is a substrate for the citrate pathway in mitochondria (red lines)
  and glycolysis in cytosol (black lines). PEP is also involved in nitrogen recycling
