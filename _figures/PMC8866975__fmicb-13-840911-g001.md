caption: Role of non-canonical translation in virus-induced autoimmunity. (A) Proteins
  synthesized from canonical open reading frames (ORFs) are degraded via the proteasomal
  degradation pathway. The peptides produced thereof localize to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) via TAP and are loaded on MHC-I molecules. The presented complexes however,
  fail to activate autoreactive T-cells as T cells against a majority of self-peptides
  are eliminated during the selection process in the thymus. (B) During viral infection,
  stress responses alter the translational machinery to synthesize novel proteins/polypeptides
  from both viral and cellular non-canonical ORFs, initiating at non-canonical AUG
  (nAUG) or other codons (e.g., CUG). These novel proteins are highly unstable and
  are preferentially degraded via several mechanisms including both proteasomal independent
  and dependent mechanisms, cytoplasmic endopeptidases and peptides formed through
  endo-lysosomal digestion of infected cells. The novel cryptic peptides, previously
  invisible to the immune system can now activate specific T-cell clones triggering
  an autoimmune-like response (Created using biorender.com).
