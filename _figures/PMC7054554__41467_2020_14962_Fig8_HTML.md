caption: The mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a central regulator
  of cell growth and metabolism. A variety of upstream signals regulate mTOR activity,
  including growth factors and nutrients. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) by growth factors activates the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as the RAS and MEK/ERK
  pathway, which promote mTORC1 activation. Chronic rapamycin treatment inhibits mTORC1
  activity and in some cell types also mTORC2 activity. In telomerase-deficient mice
  with short telomeres, the G2 Terc−/− mice, the RAS and PI3K/AKT pathways are upregulated
  concomitantly with increased mTORC1 activity and increased levels of the mTORC1
  downstream target pS6. The results shown here support a model in which hyperactivation
  of these metabolic-related pathways as the consequence of telomerase deficiency
  and short telomeres constitute a compensatory survival mechanism in response to
  the telomeric defects. In agreement with this, inhibition of the mTOR pathway by
  chronic rapamycin treatment or by genetic deletion of S6K1 is deleterious for telomerase-deficient
  mice.
