caption: (A) Use of a genome-scale integrated analysis of gene networks (GIANT())
  with AGTR2, CRKL, TBX2, and SLC26A2 as inputs analyzed across all tissue types (relationship
  confidence > 0.5 and max number of genes set to 20). (B–C) Microarray analysis was
  performed on mRNA from (B) BJAB WT and LEXR samples and (C) MDA-231 SENS and TRAILR
  samples after treatment with TRAIL (100ng/mL), followed by GSEA analysis. (B) The
  KEGG Pancreatic signaling pathway (consisting mostly of ErbB/EGFR signaling pathways)
  is displayed with core genes upregulated (enriched) in the trail treated BJAB-LEXR
  samples as compared to trail treated BJAB-WT samples in red. (C) The KEGG ErbB signaling
  pathway is displayed with core genes upregulated (enriched) in the trail treated
  MDA-231 TRAILR samples as compared to the trail treated MDA-231 SENS samples.
