caption: Schematic representation of the BMP signaling pathway. BMPs undergo several
  processing and post-transcriptional modifications prior to forming homodimers composed
  of two identical subunits. The homodimers then bind to heterodimeric type I and
  type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The formation of this complex results
  in the activation of receptor-activated Smads (RA-Smads, Smad1/Smad5/Smad8), which
  then recruit the co-factor Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus. However, the
  activation of RA-Smads, the recruitment of Smad4, and the subsequent nuclear translocation
  can be inhibited by the presence of Smad6 and Smad7.
