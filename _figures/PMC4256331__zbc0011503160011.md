caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways affected by Syk that drive
  Aβ production, neuroinflammation, and Tau hyperphosphorylation. Our data show that
  Syk regulates NFκB activity, which besides its well known role in neuroinflammatory
  processes also regulates BACE-1 expression, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible
  for Aβ production. Aβ has been shown to stimulate Syk activity resulting in microglial
  activation and neurotoxicity (). In addition, Syk phosphorylates Tau directly at
  the residue Tyr-18 (), which is considered to be an early event in the pathophysiology
  of AD. Our data illustrate that Syk also plays an important role in the regulation
  of GSK3β, one of the main kinases involved in pathological Tau phosphorylation.
  When Syk is inhibited, this induces an activation of PKA that phosphorylates the
  inhibitory Ser-9 of GSK3β resulting in GSK3β inactivation and a reduction of Tau
  hyperphosphorylation at multiple GSK3β-dependent epitopes. Activated PKA also phosphorylates
  CREB, which is expected to be neuroprotective and to improve cognition. In addition,
  Syk inhibition prevents NFκB pathway activation lowering neuroinflammation and BACE-1
  expression, resulting in a reduction of Aβ accumulation. Neuroinflammatory events
  with the ensuing gliosis, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and Aβ accumulation seem therefore
  intertwined and have the potential for feed-forward effects that can create a self-propagating
  pathological cascade in AD, which can be interrupted by inhibiting Syk activity.
