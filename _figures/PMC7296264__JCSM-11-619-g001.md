caption: Molecular signalling involved in muscle wasting during cancer cachexia. Inflammatory
  mediators, such as pro‐inflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1 and tumour necrosis
  factor‐α) and myostatin, and proteolysis‐inducing factor (PIF), derived from the
  tumour and/or immune cells, activate intracellular signals. Cytokines and PIF, through
  nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB), activate forkhead box O (FOXO) leading to increased
  transcription of ubiquitin ligase genes—Atrogin 1 and muscle RING finger‐containing
  protein 1 (MURF1)—that promote muscle protein degradation. The activation of p38
  and Janus kinase/mitogen‐activated protein kinase (JAK/MAPK) cascades by PIF, cytokines
  and myostatin, leads to apoptosis mediated by caspases. Myostatin can also activate
  protein degradation through FOXOs. Additionally, myostatin may decrease protein
  synthesis, inhibiting protein kinase B (AKT) through SMAD. Insulin‐like growth factor‐1
  (IGF‐1) is decreased during muscle wasting, suppressing the IGF‐1 pathway (dashed
  lines) and therefore inhibiting protein synthesis. Peroxisome proliferator‐activated
  receptor‐γ co‐activator 1α (PGC1α) increases uncoupling protein (UCP) expression,
  leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. The consumption of high levels of amino acids,
  such as glutamine, by the tumour increases protein breakdown in skeletal muscle,
  contributing to cancer cachexia. PIFR, PIF receptor; ACTRIIB, activin receptor type
  IIB; IGF1R, insulin‐like growth factor‐1 receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase;
