caption: The proposed mechanism by which the HSP-peptide complex interacts with APC’s
  consists of cell surface receptor interaction. Primarily, CD91 has been shown to
  endocytose the complex and via either proteasome dependent or independent pathways
  lead to the presentation via MHC-class I receptor. In addition, a portion of the
  internalized complex enters an acidic compartment which leads to its loading onto
  MHC-class II receptors. Additional cell surface receptors, such as TLR2/TLR4, and
  others that have not been elucidated are also involved in eliciting a downstream
  effect which leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Upon activation, proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines are generated and secreted in order to further augment
  a proinflammatory response.
