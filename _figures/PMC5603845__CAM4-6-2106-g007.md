caption: NAD+ metabolism is elevated in MIBC as compared with NMIBC. The de novo pathway
  of NAD+ synthesis is enhanced, whereas the salvage pathway is repressed in more
  advanced urothelial carcinoma. Increased of kynurenine, 3‐hydroxykyurenine, and
  quinolinate suggest a potential role for inflammatory mediators in MIBC.
