  description: Metabolic pathway of isoleucine, leucine, and valine from glucose.
    The allosteric regulations are labeled by orange lines. IlvA is allosterically
    regulated by isoleucine. IlvI/ilvH is allosterically regulated by isoleucine,
    leucine, and valine. Three enzymes, PPC, aspC, and asd, are overexpressed in plasmid
    pBAPA to enhance the metabolic flux toward threonine, which is the substrate of
    ilvA.
