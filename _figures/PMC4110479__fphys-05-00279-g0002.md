caption: Proinflammatory properties of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). pDCs are
  capable to sense a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such
  as viral and bacterial peptides, peptidoglycans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), RNA,
  and DNA through a range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs), double strand RNA-sensing receptor helicases (PRK, RIG-1, MDA5,
  and LGP2), and cytoplasmic receptors recognizing viral RNA and DNA (LRRFIPI, cGAS,
  DAI, DDX, and DNA polymerase III) or peptides (NOD1 and NOD2). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8,
  and TLR9 recognize pathogen-associated molecules in intracellular exosomes. PAMP-induced
  activation of PRRs leads to the activation of interferon-regulating factors IRF-3
  and IRF-7 and transcription factor NF-κB that drive transcription of Type I interferon
  (IFN) genes such as IFN-α and IFN-β. In response to infection, pDCs secrete large
  amounts of IFN-α and IFN-β that display a variety of stimulatory activities on innate
  and adaptive immunity through activation of phagocytic and cytotoxic activities
  of macrophages, antigen-presenting function of conventional DCs (cDCs) and production
  of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin(IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
  and IFN-γ. IFN-I-induced up-regulation of IFN-γ production by natural killer (NK)
  cells and T cells is of great value since IFN-γ is a potent antiviral agent. IFN-I
  also inhibit virus replication and invasion and arrest bacterial proliferation.
  IFN-I is able to induce a positive feedback autocrine response through binding to
  the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) on the surface of pDCs. The activation of the IFNAR
  leads to the recruitment of IRF9 that forms a heterotrimeric transcription complex
  IGGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor) capable to recognize specific regulatory motifs
  called interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter regions of
  IFN-I-inducible target genes. As a result, many genes are expressed including PRRS,
  chemokines, caspases, inflammasome (cryopyrin, Nlrp3), and apoptotic cell surface
  death receptor Fas. Caspase-1 and caspase-11 are required for the activation of
  inflammasome components and IL-1β. Release of IL-1β and inflammasome induce death
  of infected cells through the pypoptotic mechanism and activates inflammatory response.
  pDCs also secrete IL-6 and TNF-α that activate cDCs and stimulate B cell differentiation
  to antibody-producing cells. pDCs could display cytotoxic properties in an IL-3-dependent
  manner. IL-3 produced by activated T cells could activate signaling pathway mediated
  by signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5 and induce
  expression of granzyme B (GZMB), whose release causes death of infected host cells.
