caption: Integrin-dependent adhesion and tensile force mechanotransduction modulate
  cellular behavior. Cells dynamically probe the biomechanical properties of the surrounding
  ECM using a host of cell surface receptors including, integrins and syndecans, and
  activate intracellular signaling pathways accordingly. Soft substrates are not strong
  enough to activate integrin-mediated signaling and the subsequent mechanotransduction
  of tensile forces. Consequently, integrins exhibit a low-affinity configuration
  that hinders either the stabilization of FAs or the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.
  In fact, the softness of the matrix elicits the endocytosis and degradation of integrins,
  enhancing this effect. In contrast, rigid substrates promote integrin recruitment
  and their effective anchoring to the ECM in a stiffness-dependent manner. Likewise,
  the cell glycocalyx is compressed by the ECM fibers, which mechanically stresses
  the integrins, upregulating their activation. Accordingly, integrin activation triggers
  vinculin coupling and the subsequent activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src
  complexes that stabilize the FA clutches. Mature FAs bind to actomyosin machinery
  to sustain the contractile forces required during cell spread. Similarly, syndecan-matrix
  interaction can activate myosin II to promote cell contractibility and migration
  in a feedforward positive loop. The mechanotransduction of ECM-derived tensile forces
  also promotes the YES-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ complex translocation into the
  nucleus, which triggers the transcription of many oncogenes involved in MET processes.
  On the other hand, FAK/Src produces downstream signaling events, regulating the
  activity of Rho GTPases. The crosstalk between RhoA and Rac1 controls the mechanosensitivity
  of the ECM and provides high cellular plasticity to adapt cell´s mechanobiology
  to the ECM properties. Indeed, RhoA activates ROCK-signaling concomitant with MLC
  activation, which stimulates actomyosin contractility and FA assembly. In parallel,
  the expression of Rac1 and Cdc42 at the leading edge induces the extent of actin-rich
  membrane protrusions -i.e., lamellipodia and filopodia- promoting directed cell
  migration. Furthermore, FAK-mediated signaling also promotes pro-survival and invasiveness
  signals via Rac1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, the biomechanical properties of the
  ECM largely determine efficient integrin-dependent adhesion and stress mechanotransduction,
  which stimulate Rho GTPase signaling and trigger oncogene transcription. Accordingly,
  these events modulate cell behavior, favoring tumor cell transformation and proliferation,
  survival, and/or invasion phenomena.
