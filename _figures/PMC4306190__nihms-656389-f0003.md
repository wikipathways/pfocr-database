caption: Glucose metabolism and energy production starts with glycolysis where glucose
  undergoes a series of metabolic steps to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate can either enter
  Kreb’s cycle for further metabolism processing and energy production via aerobic
  pathways or get converted to lactate (ending its metabolic transformation). The
  intermediates formed during glycolysis can enter into different pathways of metabolism
  such as Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP),
  Protein kinase C pathway and advanced glycation end-product pathway (AGE). Glucose
  itself can also enter polyol pathway instead of glycolysis to form fructose. Altered
  glycaemia can hamper/affect any of these other pathways of glucose metabolism, leading
  to oxidative stress and potential cell damage.
