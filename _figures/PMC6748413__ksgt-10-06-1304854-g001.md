caption: Roles of biosynthetic trafficking for animal development. (A) The biosynthetic
  secretory pathway and its molecular regulators. The Sar1 small G protein promotes
  anterograde traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by promoting the assembly
  of COPII-coated vesicles. At the Golgi, Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5 regulate retrograde
  COPI vesicle trafficking. At the trans Golgi network (TGN), Arfs assemble clathrin-coated
  vesicles to deliver biomolecules to endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane
  (PM). (B) Developmental processes under high secretory demand. Left, delivery of
  membrane to cleavage furrows promotes their ingression for embryo cleavage. Middle,
  PM growth promotes dendritic growth and arborisation. Right, secretion of ECM promotes
  bone development. (C) Developmental processes regulated by biosynthetic trafficking
  in polarized epithelial cells. Left, increases in apical membrane and apical ECM
  secretion promotes lumen growth in epithelial tubes. Middle, trafficking of polarity
  determinants promotes the establishment and maintenance of planar cell polarity.
  Right, biosynthetic trafficking promotes the formation and maintenance of primary
  cilia. See main text for details.
