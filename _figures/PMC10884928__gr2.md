caption: The hypothesis that Prevotella may improve MASLD by enhancing carbon metabolism
  and BCAA metabolism after supplementation with NADOn the one hand, Prevotella encodes
  all the enzymes required for the Embden meyerhof pathway. The succinate produced
  by enhanced carbon metabolism can undergo glucose neogenesis through Prevotella,
  while Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or Pyruvate can participate in the liver TCA cycle
  and regulate the NAD+/NADH ratio. On the other hand, Prevotella contains BCAA biosynthesis
  genes, which can be converted into metabolic intermediates in the TCA cycle through
  skeletal muscle and liver metabolism, and further regulate the NAD+/NADH ratio.
  Therefore, specific microorganisms such as Prevotella may play a unique role in
  using NAD supplements to improve MASLD. (Created with BioRender.com)
