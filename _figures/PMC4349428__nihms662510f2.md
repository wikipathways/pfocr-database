caption: The relationship between genotypes and phenotypes of the nucleotide excision
  repair pathway and risk of SCCHN. The numbers on the right are for the common tagging
  SNPs of each of the 8 core NER genes. NER, nucleotide excision repair; SNP, single
  nucleotide polymorphism; DRC, DNA repair capacity; SCCHN, squamous cell carcinoma
  of the head and neck. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is
