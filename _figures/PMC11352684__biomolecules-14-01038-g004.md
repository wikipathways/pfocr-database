caption: TRIM proteins in the cellular signaling pathway of MAFLD. The figure shows
  the mechanism of MAFLD, mainly involving NF-κB, MAPK, AMPK, and other signaling
  pathways. TRIM proteins regulate the disease by targeting its upstream and downstream
  molecules at both the gene and protein levels. MAFLD is also regulated by combining
  FASN, which is a key enzyme in lipid synthesis, the lipid peroxide clearance process,
  and ferroapoptosis
