caption: Working model for the bis‐(3′,5′)‐cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate
  (c‐di‐GMP) signalling pathway in Dickeya dadantii. (A) The regulation of c‐di‐GMP
  signalling on pectate lyase (Pel) production in D. dadantii is complex, involves
  several Gcp and Ecp proteins, and takes place at both transcriptional and post‐transcriptional
  levels. The Rsm system is a central component in c‐di‐GMP‐related Pel regulation.
  GcpA and EGcpB modulate the same c‐di‐GMP pool to control pelD gene expression through
  the H‐NS–rsmB–RsmA pathway. EcpC modulates a different c‐di‐GMP pool that directly
  targets RsmB, bypassing H‐NS. GcpA positively regulates RsmA at the post‐transcriptional
  level. PCWDE, plant cell wall degrading enzyme. (B) The regulation of GcpA on type
  III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression is dependent on its impact on RsmB,
  which controls the expression of hrpL at the post‐transcriptional level. This regulation
  is different from that of EGcpB and EcpC, which regulate hrpL at the transcriptional
  level via the RpoN–hrpL pathway. (C) GcpA and EGcpB regulate swimming motility through
  H‐NS, whereas EcpC is different. ⊥, negative control; →, positive control. The broken
  lines indicate the regulatory mechanisms identified in this study.
