caption: NF-κB activation pathway. The inhibitor protein I-κB, when bound to NF-κB
  in the cytoplasm, renders NF-κB inactive. A variety of cellular stimuli result in
  the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of I-κB, thereby targeting it for proteasome
  mediated degradation. Bortezomib, by inhibiting the proteasome, results in increased
  I-κB inhibition of NF-κB, thus resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Reproduced

  of cancer. Drug Discov Today. 2003;8(7):307–315. Copyright © 2003 Elsevier.
