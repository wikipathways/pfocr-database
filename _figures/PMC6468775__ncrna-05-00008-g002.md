caption: Biogenesis and function of the PRG-1/21U-RNA pathway and its antagonistic
  signals. (A) In the C. elegans germline, the USTC complex, with SNPC-4, PRDE-1 and
  TOFU-4/5, recognize the upstream motif and promote 21U-RNA transcription by RNA
  PolII. 21U-RNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for further processing. 5′ processing
  may be undertaken by the PETISCO complex, whereas PARN trims the 3′ ends of 21U-RNAs.
  21U-RNAs subsequently associate with PRG-1 and are 2′-O-methylated at the 3′ end
  by HENN-1. PRG-1 scans the germline transcriptome and stimulates 22G-RNA production,
  by RdRPs and mutator factors, from foreign transcripts. Then, 22G-RNAs bind to cytoplasmic
  WAGOs, leading to PTGS of targets or to HRDE-1, which promotes TGS. Accessory NRDE
  factors are required for HMT recruitment and deposition of repressive chromatin
  marks. Moreover, NRDE factors may directly impair the activity of RNA PolII. (B)
  CSR-1 and PATCs inhibit repressive PRG-1 signals. The regulatory outcome of a germline-expressed
  gene will depend on the balance between associated CSR-1/22G-RNAs and PRG-1/21U-RNAs.
  Germline genes are strongly recognized by CSR-1 and have PATCs throughout their
  sequence, thereby inhibiting PRG-1 targeting. In contrast, non-self sequences tend
  to lack the PATC signature and will not be strongly targeted by CSR-1. In this case,
  stronger PRG-1 targeting will flag these transcripts for degradation. HMT, Histone
  methyltransferases; PolII, RNA Polymerase II; PTGS, post-transcriptional gene silencing;
  RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase; RNAa, RNA-induced epigenetic gene activation;
  RNAe, RNA-induced epigenetic silencing; TGS, transcriptional gene silencing.
