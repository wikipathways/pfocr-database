caption: A schematic model of the three apoptosis signaling pathways. (1) The extrinsic
  pathway mediated by death receptors, (2) the intrinsic pathway centered on mitochondria,
  and (3) the perforin pathway induced by granzyme B. Each pathway activates its own
  initiator caspase (casp 8, 9, and 10) which in turn will activate the executioner
  caspase 3. A solid arrow indicates activation or upregulation, while a line terminated
  by a bar indicates inhibition or downregulation. The arrows with broken red lines
  indicate the cross-talk between these pathways.
