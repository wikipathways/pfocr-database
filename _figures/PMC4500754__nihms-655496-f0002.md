caption: 'Oxidative stress induces aberrant signaling pathways. Maternal diabetes-induced
  oxidative stress activates PKCα, -βII and -δ, stimulates lipid peroxidation, which
  aggravates oxidative stress; and induces apoptosis and diabetic embryopathy. The
  ERK1/2 and PI3K/ATK pathway is suppressed by oxidative stress induced by maternal
  diabetes, which further inhibits cell proliferation and survival signaling. Another
  pathway affected by maternal diabetes is the ASK-JNK1/2 signaling pathway, which
  is activated and subsequently induces ER stress and apoptosis events. These aberrant
  signaling pathways suppresses proliferation, which may contribute to diabetic embryopathy.
  DAG: diacyl glycerol; PKC: protein kinase C; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2.'
