caption: Schematic Representation of the Mevalonate Pathway, Dolichol Synthesis, and
  the Requirement of Dolichyl Phosphate (Dol-P) for N-Linked Oligosaccharide GenerationFarnesyl
  diphosphate (FPP), an important pre-squalene intermediate of the mevalonate pathway,
  undergoes DHDDS/NUS1-catalyzed condensation with multiple isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) units to generate polyprenyl pyrophosphate (diphosphate), and ultimately the
  obligate glycan carrier, Dol-PP. Gene products involved in synthesis of dolichol
  and Dol-P-saccharide/oligosaccharide intermediates, and hence implicated in CDG-1
  (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation), have been represented. The enzymatic activity
  provided by DHDDS and NUS1 catalyzes the commitment step of dolichol synthesis;
  hence mutations in either DHDDS or NUS1 are hypothesized to block protein N-glycosylation,
  and are classified as CDG-I. Dolichol (structure in inset), is an acyclic isoprenoid
  consisting of 18–21 isoprene units.
