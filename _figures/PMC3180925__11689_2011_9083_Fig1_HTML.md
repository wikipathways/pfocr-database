caption: Wnts signal through a “canonical” pathway involving β-catenin mediated transcriptional
  regulation (at left) and through “non-canonical” pathways involving calcium and
  Rac/JNK-mediated signaling (at right). In the absence of Wnt, the β-catenin destruction
  complex, whose core members are the scaffold proteins axin and adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), binds and
  phosphorylates β-catenin. Phospho-β-catenin is then ubiquitinated and destroyed
  in the proteosome. Wnt binding to Fzd and LRP5/6 activates Disheveled, which breaks
  up the β-catenin destruction complex. This leads to accumulation of β-catenin in
  the cytosol and translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus, where it forms complexes
  with LEF/TCF transcription factors to promote transcription of selected gene targets.
  Wnt binding to Fzd can also trigger the Wnt/calcium signaling pathway involving
  calcium-dependent activation of CamK and PKC, or to the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway
  which leads to regulation of small GTPases and JNK. Wnt signaling is inhibited extracellularly
  by Dkk proteins, which specifically bind to LRP5/6 and thereby antagonize only Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, or by secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) and Wnt inhibitory factor
  (WIF), which bind Wnts extracellularly to antagonize all Wnt-activated signaling
  pathways
