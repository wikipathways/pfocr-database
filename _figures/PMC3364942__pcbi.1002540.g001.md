caption: One genomic metabolon containing a) 6 genes represented by arrows (gA–gF)
  of which two are gaps (gB and gE); and b) 5 reactions represented by rectangles
  (r1–r5) of which one gap (r4). Sequential genes are joined. Reactions are joined
  together by shared main compounds, i.e. compounds relevant to at least one biological
  pathway, represented here as deep blue circles. Gene annotations are materialized
  by Known gene-reaction association edges, in green. Potential gene-reaction associations
  are proposed between gene and reaction gaps, in dotted pink. For each Potential
  association, a Minimal Path Length (“MPL”) is computed. The MPL is defined here
  as the minimal number of non-Potential edges that must be walked to join a gene
  gap to a reaction gap (illustrated in the detail shot). Each Potential association
  is then weighted by αpotential/MPL, where αpotential is arbitrarily set to 0.1.
