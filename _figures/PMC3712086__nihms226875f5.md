caption: Diagram illustrating the signaling mechanism of how CARD9 may be inhibiting
  apoptosis from TNF-alpha. Upon binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1, the receptor trimerizes
  and activates 1 of 2 signaling cascades. Activation of the FADD pathway results
  in further activation of a caspase cascade resulting in apoptosis. Activation of
  the TRADD pathway results in activation of NF-KB which signals to the nucleus to
  increase the number of survival proteins resulting in cell proliferation. Shear
  stress is known to result in phosphorylation of IκB, thus releasing NF-KB from its
  inhibitory state in order to signal to the nucleus. Our study suggests that CARD9
  is one of the survival proteins that may be interacting with the caspase-induced
  pathway of TNF-alpha, thus protecting endothelial cells from apoptosis during chronic
  shear.
