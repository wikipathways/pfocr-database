caption: (A) Caffeine arrests the cell cycle on G0/G1 phase in GBM cell lines. Normally,
  GO/G1 cell cycle phase is regulated by the CdkD and CdkE, which interacts with Cdk4,
  Cdk6 and Cdk2 forming CdkD/Cdk4,6 and CdkE/Cdk2 complexes. The CDK complexes are
  responsible for retinoblastoma (Rb) inactivation through phosphorylation and consequently,
  releasing the transcriptional factor E2F, retaining the cell cycle active. Caffeine
  appears to arrest the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase in GBM cell lines C6, U251, and
  U87MG by CDK complex inhibition. No caffeine effects were observed on S, G2, or
  M phases. (B) Effects of caffeine and compounds derived from caffeine on invasion/migration
  capacity and angiogenesis impairing in GBM cell lines. The caffeine can inhibit
  the IP3R3, an ER calcium receptor, which leads to a lower concentration of intracellular
  calcium, decreasing cell invasion and migration capacity. The rho-associated protein
  kinase (ROCK) cathepsin B/FAK/ERK pathway, associate with cellular invasion and
  migration, is also inhibited by caffeine through targeting phosphorylated p38 (p-p38)
  and ROCK proteins direct or by indirect inhibition through the TIMP-1 and integrins
  β1 (I-β1) and I-β3, leading to lower MMP-2 and MMP-9. In addition, PT93, a compound
  derived from CA, acts direct in the inhibition of MMP-2 and contributing to lower
  cellular invasion or migration capacity. In the same way, the CA derivatives FLVM/FLVZ
  can either inhibit IL17 and HIF-1, leading to VEGF inhibition and angiogenesis impairing.
  The euphol derivative (IngC), on the other hand, acts in PKC and Wnt/β-catenin (β-C)
  pathways, inhibiting the PDK1, leading to lower concentration of β-C, an effector
  protein, consequently inhibiting the tumor invasion and migration.
