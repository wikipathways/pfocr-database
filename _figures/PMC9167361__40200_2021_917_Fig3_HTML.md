caption: consists of major biochemical cycles and shows the relevance of important
  metabolites, that most of them are effective in obesity. Biochemical cycles are
  closely related with each other. So that the product of each cycle is used as a
  primary material or auxiliary agent in another cycle. Thus, the overall biochemical
  cycle is formed for the metabolism of the living organism. Certainly, fluctuations
  in the metabolites due to disease or genetic defects are affecting this pathway
  and cause consecutive fluctuations in the amount of metabolites. Therefore, tracking
  these fluctuations can act as a good biomarker to diagnose diseases and even to
  develop a therapeutic method for them. Here the focus of the study is on obesity
  and a review of the overall metabolic cycle based on the metabolites that are effective
  in obesity. Based on the studies conducted in this article, metabolites that are
  effective in obesity have been identified. Also, most obesity biomarkers are present
  in the overall metabolic cycle. (Figure 3) Therefore, it is possible to follow the
  process of obesity and develop a therapeutic method for it. Meanwhile, there are
  a number of important biomarkers in obesity that include amino acids such as phenylalanine,
  tyrosine, lysine, glutamic acid, alanine and BCAA (branched chain amino acids),
  polyamines that most notably is putrescine and ketone bodies including acetoacetate
  and 3-hydroxy butyrate
