caption: The phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphates, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3,
  are key signaling molecules in lymphocyte activation. A. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is primarily
  produced by sequential phosphorylation of PtdIns by the PtdIns 4-kinase (PI4K) and
  PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase (PIP5K). Phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PtdIns 3-kinase
  (PI3K) yields PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. B. Crosslinking of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR,
  membrane-anchored antibody) by cognate antigen triggers B cell activation. Phosphorylation
  of the BCR-associated proteins Igα and Igβ initiates a cascade of signaling events
  that engage the phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) and PI3K pathways. PLCγ2 hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P2,
  yielding soluble InsP3 and membrane-associated diacylglycerol (DAG). InsP3 stimulates
  the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn, leads
  to entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol. Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ results
  in the activation of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) transcription
  factor. DAG binds protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) and, together with increased cytosolic
  Ca2+, activates this Ser/Thr kinase to initiate a series of events that lead to
  nuclear translocation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B) transcription factor.
  DAG also binds RASGRP (Ras guanyl nucleotide releasing protein), recruiting this
  guanyl nucleotide exchange factor to the plasma membrane where it activates the
  small G protein RAS. This event initiates the RAF, MEK (mitogen-activated protein
  kinase/ERK kinase), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway,
  generating additional transcriptional regulators that, along with NFAT and NF-κB,
  induce genes that promote lymphocyte activation, proliferation and survival. PI3K
  phosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2, yielding PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which recruits pleckstrin
  homology domain-containing proteins such as the AKT kinase. AKT mediates regulatory
  events such as the phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO (Forkhead Box subgroup
  O) transcription factors that suppress cell proliferation and survival. Thus, AKT-mediated
  signaling is one way the PI3K pathway promotes lymphocyte activation, proliferation
  and survival.
