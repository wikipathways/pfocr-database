caption: 'Simplified representation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathways. AhR
  ligands (FICZ: 6-formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole; TCDD: 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin;
  PAH: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) cross the plasmatic membrane and bind to
  AhR present in the cytoplasm. The presence of antagonists in the medium is susceptible
  to block the interaction with the agonists. The ligand-receptor complex translocates
  into the nucleus and the complex heterodimerizes with its partner ARNT (AhR Nuclear
  Translocator). The heterodimer binds specific DNA sequences located in the promoter
  regions of target genes known as xenobiotic response elements (XRE). Among target
  genes, CYP1A1 (Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) is a hallmark
  of AhR signalling. CYP1A1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily
  of enzymes which one of their roles is to degrade the AhR natural ligands. Numerous
  genes coding for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory products are induced by
  this mechanism, which is referred to as the AhR genomic pathway. Non-genomic pathways
  are also described such as interactions of AhR with other transcription factors
  or modulation of calcium transport. Altogether these AhR pathways are able to control
  positively or negatively the immune response.'
