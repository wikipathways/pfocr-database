caption: The ternary complex model. According to this model, the receptor in its inactive
  state (R) undergoes a conformational transition, which leads to the formation of
  an active state (R*). This active state in turn interacts with heterotrimeric G
  proteins (G). Note that according to this model, the relative degree of activation
  of each effector pathway by the tested agonists must be the same
