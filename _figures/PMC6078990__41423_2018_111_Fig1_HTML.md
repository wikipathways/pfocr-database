caption: YAP regulates innate antiviral immunity via a transcription-independent mechanism.
  YAP/TAZ are major effectors of the Hippo pathway and are involved in organ size
  control and tissue homeostasis in normal cells. However, when dysregulated, they
  act as oncoproteins and promote cellular responses that are associated with tumor
  initiation, growth and metastasis. In general, these functions require the interaction
  of YAP/TAZ with TEAD family transcription factors (TEAD1–4) and thus rely on transcription-dependent
  mechanism. Now, Wang et al. have identified a transcription-independent function
  of YAP as a negative regulator of innate antiviral immunity. YAP4, a transcriptionally
  inactive isoform, also blocks the activation of IRF3 at the dimerization step and
  thus limits IFN-β expression in response to viral nucleic acids. Notably, IKKɛ that
  is activated by viral infection induces lysosomal degradation of YAP via phosphorylation
  at Ser403 and thereby relieves the YAP-mediated suppression of IRF3. Thus, YAP is
  likely a new physiologic regulator of innate antiviral immunity and a potential
  therapeutic target for the modulation of IFN-β expression.
