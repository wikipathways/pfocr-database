caption: Adiponectin signaling pathway regulates intracellular metabolism and neuronal
  plasticity in (A) physiological- and (B) chronic stress-associated conditions. (A)
  Activation of the adiponectin receptors, which are present at synapses, orchestrates
  signaling pathways that are essential for proper bioenergetic balance and plasticity.
  AdipoR1/2 phosphorylates the APPL1 and activates the AMPK and PPARα pathways, whereas
  APPL1 itself forms a complex with NMDA receptors and couples neuronal activity with
  the activation of the insulin signaling pathway (PI3K/Akt). PI3K/Akt induces mTORC1
  activity, protein synthesis, and cellular growth by suppressing TSC1/2. Upon synaptic
  activation, increased AMPK signaling is necessary to upregulate substrate oxidation,
  mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, maintaining the intracellular energetic
  reserves necessary for LTP maintenance. PPARα, on the other hand, directly upregulated
  CREB transcription. (B) Chronic stress downregulates PPARα and AMPK expression and
  phosphorylation, as well as downregulates the expression of upstream modulators
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin.
  Currently, a direct connection between APPL1 and stress-associated deficits remains
  unknown.
