caption: Scheme of relevant adipocyte alterations interacted with ATM in response
  to lipolysis. Representation of apoptotic adipocytes surrounded by ATM in CLS in
  lipolysis, with the small black square enlarging alterations of adipocytes. The
  signaling pathways that link these components by activation (green arrows) or inhibition
  (red inhibitory lines) are also indicated. Light yellow bar indicates secretome
  of adipocytes, while light purple one indicates secretome of ATM. Briefly, ADRB3
  activation mediated by the canonical cAMP/PKA/HSL axis as well as the JNK/NFκB/COX2
  axis liberates various lipid metabolites like FFAs and PGE from adipocytes, which
  would trigger infiltration of lipolysis-associated ATM. In addition, ADRB3 signaling
  also leads to IL-6 production from adipocytes, through p38 activation stimulated
  by FFAs building up or downstream of the JNK/AP-1/SPHK1 signaling pathway. IL-6
  could induce adipocyte remodeling by activation of the JAK/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling,
  further enhancing catabolism and liberation of lipids from adipocytes. Also, IL-6
  is an important signal node for ATM accumulation. Bilaterally, ATM participate in
  affecting adipocyte lipolysis via secretion of different molecules. On the one hand,
  ATM-derived GDF3 can inhibit lipolysis via activation of ALK on cell surface of
  adipocytes and subsequent lipase inhibition. Additionally, AIM secreted from ATM
  leads to irregular and persistent lipolysis due to inhibition of PPARγ and reduction
  of FSP27 and PLIN levels. On the other hand, M2-like ATM inhibit adipocyte lipolysis
  by undefined mechanisms.
