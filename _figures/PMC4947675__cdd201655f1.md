caption: Non-canonical autophagy in the clearance of dead cells. LC3-associated phagocytosis
  (LAP) is the process by which phagosomes become decorated with LC3 and are subsequently
  trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. LAP uses a subset of the canonical autophagy
  machinery, but notably does not need the ULK1 pre-initiation complex, and again,
  distinct from canonical autophagy, requires Rubicon and Nox2. Following ingestion,
  dying cells are rapidly degraded and do not induce an autoimmune response. However,
  when components of the LAP pathway are genetically deleted, although dying cells
  are engulfed normally they are not degraded and hence the nuclear material escapes
  and leads to an immune response. Consequently, a systemic inflammatory disease resembling
  lupus develops
