caption: Mechanism of Hearing Impairment Induced by Teprotumumab. IGF-1 binds to IGF-1R
  on cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, activating intracellular signaling
  pathways such as PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, which are crucial for cell survival,
  proliferation, and functional maintenance. Teprotumumab binds to IGF-1R, blocking
  IGF-1 from activating these pathways, leading to impaired cell survival and proliferation,
  and ultimately resulting in hearing impairment
