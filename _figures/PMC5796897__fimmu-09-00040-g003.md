caption: 'Schematic representation of the fatty acid (FA) synthesis in different cell
  types. Cancer cells (CC: orange) show increased expression of ACCS2 favoring conversion
  of pyruvate to acetyl-coA as well as fatty acid synthase (FASN) for conversion of
  malonyl-coA to FA. The latter, is also overexpressed in M2 macrophages (blue). CCs
  can also obtain FA from exogenous sources via converting triglycerides (TG) into
  FA, which are taken up by the CD36 transporter. Overexpression of monoacylglycerol
  lipase (MAGL) in CC is related to synthesis of lipids involved in cell signaling.
  Increased expression of SCD1 in CC balances higher presence of unsaturated FA essential
  for maintenance of ER homeostasis. Enhanced expression of ACC1 shifts T cell differentiation
  toward T regulatory cells (Treg: dark green).'
