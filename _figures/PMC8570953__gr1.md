caption: Illustrative representation of Swertia chirayita mediated anti-proliferative
  effects on human non-small lung cancer A549 cells. Sw-EtOH was found to exert its
  anti-cancerous effects on A549 cells by impelling the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  mediated by enhanced expression of caspase-8 enrouted to activation of Fas receptors
  by Fas-L. Sw-EtOH also indicated towards activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  via augmentation of intracellular ROS levels concomitantly followed by increased
  levels of caspase dependent cleaved PARP protein. Furthermore, Sw-EtOH was also
  successful in modulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway which eventually culminated
  in altered expression of signals required for cell survival and proliferation (as
  indicated by upwards and downwards arrow).
