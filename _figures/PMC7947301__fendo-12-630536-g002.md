caption: 'Structure and function of nuclear receptors. (A) Canonical structures of
  nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are composed of a N terminal activation function
  domain whose activity is independent of ligand binding, a DNA binding domain (DBD),
  a hinge region (Hr) and a ligand binding domain (LBD). Their respective activity
  is mentioned accordingly. Dimer: dimerization (B) Nuclear receptors work as homo
  or heterodimers which bind a response element present in the promoter of their target
  genes. Response elements are composed of two AGGTCA half-sites separated by one
  to four nucleotides (X). In the absence of ligand, NRs (except class I) preferentially
  bind co-repressor and inhibit gene transcription. In the presence of a ligand, co-repressors
  are degraded by the proteasome and co-activators are recruited, which then allows
  the binding of a mediator complex and the ARN polymerase II.'
