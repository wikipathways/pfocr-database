caption: Alzheimer’s disease (highlighted in red) In Alzheimer’s disease, SIRT1 has
  been shown to promote non-amyloidogenic APP processing pathway by decreasing levels
  of ROCK1 kinase (). SIRT1 may also target the retinoic acid receptor β, which activates
  ADAM10 to facilitate processing of APP along a non-amyloidogenic pathway (). SIRT1
  has also been shown to directly deacetylate tau in several tauopathy models enabling
  ubiquitin ligases to promote clearance of this protein (; ). Parkinson’s disease
  (highlighted in blue) SIRT1 has been shown to deacetylate HSF, which induces transcription
  of molecular chaperones that promote protein folding (; ; ). In addition to its
  effects on the heat shock response, SIRT1 may also function to regulate autophagy
  and mitophagy, which may affect α-synuclein toxicity in the context of PD (; ).
  There is also evidence that PGC1α may be a relevant target in mouse models of PD
  (). Huntington’s disease (highlighted in green) Several different molecular mechanisms
  account for the protective effect of SIRT1 overexpression against mutant huntingtin
  toxicity (; ). Mutant huntingtin protein was found to inhibit the enzymatic activity
  of SIRT1 during HD pathogenesis. One proposed mechanism is that SIRT1 deacetylates
  TORC1, facilitating BDNF transcription through CREB (). An alternate explanation
  for the protective effect of SIRT1 in HD mice was that this protein might maintain
  TrkB signaling and DARPP32 levels as HD progresses. Foxo3a deacetylation was another
  SIRT1 target implicated in promoting cell survival in the HD models (). Amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (highlighted in beige) The proposed mechanism for SIRT1’s activity
  in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parallels one of the pathways observed in PD. SIRT1
  has been shown to deacetylate HSF1, which increases transcription of molecular chaperones
  including HSP70 and HSP25 that help to maintain intracellular protein homeostasis,
  reducing toxicity to motor neurons (; ; ; ). It has also been shown to affect mitochondrial
  biogenesis in cell culture models of ALS and this may be due to deacetylation of
  PGC1α (Wang et al.) Multiple sclerosis (highlighted in orange) In experimental autoimmune
  encephalitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), the mechanism of
  protection in whole animal models has not been completely elucidated. In adult neuronal
  precursor cells (NPCs), SIRT1 binds Hes1 under oxidative conditions, inhibiting
  Mash1 transcription and driving NPCs toward astroglial differentiation () and increasing
  the oligodendrocyte population may help remyelinate lesions, reduce axonal damage
  or decrease astrogliosis. An alternate approach has identified increased BDNF and
  NAMPT as possible targets to explain neuroprotection due to SIRT1 overexpression
  in EAE ().
