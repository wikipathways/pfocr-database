caption: MetaCore pathway analysis of coiled-coil domain-containing protein 167 (CCDC167)-co-expressed
  genes in breast cancer patient databases. CCDC167-co-expressed genes in breast cancer
  from TCGA and METABRIC databases were acquired and identified by the Venn diagram
  analysis in . These 945 genes were further exported to the MetaCore pathway analysis
  tool to identify gene networks and signaling pathways. The “cell cycle role of anaphase-promoting
  complex (APC) in cell cycle regulation” was the most significantly associated pathway.
  APC forms a complex with cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) or cadherin-1 (CDH1) to
  regulate the cell cycle.
