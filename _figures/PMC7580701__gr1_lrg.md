caption: 'Possible checkpoints that suppress the immune response of patients who are
  co-exposed to environmental pollution and SARS-CoV-2 aerosol.Airway innate immune
  cells, such as epithelial cells, DCs and pulmonary macrophages, function at different
  stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both xenobiotic and virus act as AhR ligands in
  individuals exposed to aerosol effect, which contains various environmental pollutants
  and SARS-CoV-2. While xenobiotics pass through the plasma membrane by passive diffusion,
  SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and enters into cell, thereby both form a ligand-receptor
  complex with AhR ("double-hit hypothesis"). After this complex is transported to
  nucleus, it heterodimerizes with its partner ARNT and genomic pathway is activated.
  This initiates the "Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome" (SAAS) via multiple AhR signaling
  pathways. SARS-CoV-2 blocks the production of type 1 IFNs and binding to the IFNARs,
  thus directly antagonizes the actions of ISG. Delayed IFN-I signaling results in
  excess virus replication in the epithelial cells and leads to severe complications.
  AhR activation by xenobiotic ligands and SARS-CoV-2 increases the expression of
  the IDO1 in DCs. Increase in IDO1 activity results in the production of immunosuppressive
  tryptophan metabolites via kynurenine pathway. The AhR-IL-6 STAT3 pathway induces
  the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells toward Th17 cells, while inhibiting Treg
  cells, leading to Treg/Th17 imbalance and SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion. Persistence
  of the inflammatory vicious circle and the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR pathway hyperactivation
  culminate with cytokine storm. The intensity of AhR activation, and AhR/IL-22 signaling
  pathway may enhance the thromboembolism and fibrosis in multiple organs (Abbreviations:
