caption: During the process of infection, antigen-presenting cells (like dendritic
  cells) in the draining lymph nodes may use B7-H1 to co-stimulate the differentiation
  of effector cells. After migration into the infected tissues, activated effector
  T cells release more IFN-γ after encountering with target cells. At this early stage,
  the target cells may express no or less B7-H1, and a rapid immune response is warranted
  for a complete clearance of infection. As the infection continues, the accumulated
  IFN-γ induces high level of B7-H1 in the target cells and higher PD-1 expression
  on effector T cells. Thus, the inhibitory signal of B7-H1/PD-1 pathway may eventually
  delay the T cell response and results in a chronic immune response with an incomplete
  clearance of infection.
