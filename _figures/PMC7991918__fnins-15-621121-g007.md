caption: 'Targeted molecular and biological pathways’ interaction map analysis performed
  on the genes from the red module. Using Pathway Studio 10.0, altered differential
  proteins relevant to transplantation in mouse brain were analyzed. Direct interactions
  algorithm was used to generate and map the targeted network of biological processes
  and interactions among altered proteins in: (A) The dopaminergic system. (B) Neurogenesis,
  axonogenesis, neurotransmission, and neuron development. (C) Neuroprotection, nerve
  cell differentiation, and regeneration. Each of the proteins is displayed within
  a subcellular compartment or organelle. The shape of each given protein is indicative
  of its functional class as shown in the legend. Included in the legend is the definition
  of the lines connecting two proteins.'
