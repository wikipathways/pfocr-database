caption: Schematic figure showing an overview of interactions between proteins involved
  in HSP and associated stress-response pathways likely involved in cattle heat stress.
  These interactions decide the fate of the downstream signaling pathway. The HSPs
  and associated proteins interact with the cell surface receptors and/or with each
  other in response to different stimuli, including accumulated unfolded/misfolded
  proteins, hormones and cellular/environmental stress (including cattle heat stress)
  and regulate different molecules affecting a spectrum of biological functions such
  as apoptosis, autophagy, cell migration and alterations in the immune response.
