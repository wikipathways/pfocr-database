caption: Hypothetical model of solid tumors cancer stem cells using breast cancer
  as an example. In the middle is a hypothetical differentiation pathway for normal
  mammary epithelial cells. Bipotential stem cells give rise to bipotential progenitors
  that can become committed myoepithelial or luminal progenitors differentiating into
  mature myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells, respectively. During the differentiation
  process the self-renewal capacity of the cells gradually decreases. Cancer stem
  cells could potentially be derived from bipotential stem cells or from more differentiated
  cells that acquired self-renewal capabilities. Cancer stem cells, however, have
  restricted differentiation potential and only produce tumors with features of a
  particular lineage (eg, luminal or basal like).
