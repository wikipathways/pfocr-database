caption: Potential biological mechanisms underlying the association between ultra-processed
  foods and CVD. The diagram describes plausible biological pathways through which
  a diet high in ultra-processed foods may contribute to CVD. Key mechanisms include
  altered serum lipid concentrations, modified gut microbiota and host–microbiota
  interactions, obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress, dysglycemia, insulin resistance,
  and hypertension and hormonal imbalances. Arrows indicate stimulation of a pathway.
