caption: Diagram of the hypothesis model in this study. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
  Aβ can inhibit the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through
  reducing the expression level of M1 type acetylcholine receptors (M1 mAChR) in the
  brain. In the gut, inhibition of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway leads
  to decreased acetylcholine transferase (CHAT) levels, which reduces acetylcholine
  (Ach) secretion. As decreased Ach, the activation of α7 acetylcholine receptor (α7
  nAChR), a receptor of Ach on the surface of macrophages in the intestine, is reduced.
  Then, the macrophages shift more toward pro-inflammatory phenotype by upregulating
  the NF-kb signaling pathway, leading to damage of enteric neurons, disruption of
  the intestinal mucosal barrier, and promotion the amyloidogenic pathways in the
  gut. Finally, gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs in AD
