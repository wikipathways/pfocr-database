caption: We previously reported a working model for Class II CCE [], showing that
  decreased cell numbers in cotyledons were exclusively attributed to decreased TAG-derived
  Suc, and that CCE might be mediated by IBA-derived IAA related mechanism. Here,
  we confirmed that IBA-derived IAA is essential for enhancing post-mitotic cell expansion.
  Based on our previous findings and this research, the scenario for Class II CCE
  in fugu5 can be summarized as follows. First, upon seed imbibition, excess cytosolic
  PPi in fugu5–1 leads to inhibition of Suc synthesis de novo from TAG, by inhibiting
  the gluconeogenic cytosolic enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase; []). Second,
  during seedling establishment, reduced Suc contents somehow promote the IBA-to-IAA
  conversion and lead to increased endogenous IAA concentration at 8–10 DAS, which
  is apparently a crucial transition point to drive CCE in fugu5 cotyledons (). Third,
  one can assume that high endogenous IAA triggers the TIR/AFB-dependent auxin signaling
  pathway through ARF7 and ARF19, and subsequently activates the vacuolar type V-ATPase
  leading to an increase in turgor pressure. This ultimately triggers cell size increase
  and CCE. This scenario is also valid for other mutants, namely icl-2, mls-2, pck1–2,
  and ibr10–1, all of which exhibit a typical Class II CCE, not because of excess
  PPi, but due to compromised gluconeogenesis from TAG []. Finally, this IAA-mediated
  CCE is not valid for Class I []. Nonetheless, our findings that V-ATPase activity
  is critically important for CCE in Class II and Class III [, ], may suggest that
  all three CCE classes may converge at this checkpoint and use the V-ATPase complex
  activity as the final driving force to inflate cell size. Although the above scenario
  is plausible, its robustness still needs to be challenged experimentally in the
  future. Succ, succinate. DAS, days after sowing.
