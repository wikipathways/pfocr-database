caption: The receptor for IL-6 consists of the ligand binding component (IL-6R) and
  the signal-transducing gp130. The soluble form of the IL-6R may form a complex with
  IL-6 having the ability to bind gp130 (trans signaling) expressed by T cells and
  to activate the anti-apoptotic STAT-3 dependent genes bcl-2 and bcl-xl. In inflammatory
  diseases, targeting of IL-6 signaling pathway modulates inflammation at least in
  part through the regulation of T cell expansion and the expression of adhesion molecules.
