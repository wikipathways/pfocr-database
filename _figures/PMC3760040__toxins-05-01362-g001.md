caption: 'Schematic representation of the endosomal pathway of cellular entry of diphtheria
  toxin, DT (adapted from []). The toxin consists of three domains: receptor-binding
  (R) domain, responsible for initiating endocytosis by binding to the heparin-binding
  EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like receptor; translocation (T)-domain; and catalytic
  (C)-domain, blocking protein synthesis via modification of elongation factor 2.
  This review is concerned with pH-triggered conformational change of the T-domain
  resulting in refolding, membrane insertion and translocation of the C-domain (highlighted
  by the red rectangle).'
