caption: The cross-talk between glucocorticoid receptor and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways.
  The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling pathway and the YAP/TAZ pathway cross-talk
  via 1) glucocorticoid (GC)-induced changes in ECM and actin cytoskeleton may lead
  to increased nuclear translocation of YAP; 2) the GRα-GC complex binds directly
  to the YAP gene promoter and increases its expression; 3) YAP/TAZ signaling inhibits
  GR signaling as TAZ prevents the binding of GRα to glucocorticoid response elements
  (GRE’s) which inhibits target gene transcription
