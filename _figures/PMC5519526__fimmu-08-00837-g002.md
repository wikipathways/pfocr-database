caption: '[1] Glycolysis, [2] tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation,
  [3] fatty acid oxidation, [4] pentose phosphate pathway, [5] ornithine cycle, and
  [6] glutamine metabolism. This figure shows the main metabolic pathways in relation
  with nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK). NO is produced by NOS with l-arginine as the substrate while
  succinate, the intermediate of the TCA cycle stabilizes and activates HIF. Adenosine
  triphosphates (ATPs) are hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), while some are
  converted to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) via adenylyl cyclase. The increase in
  AMP/ADP:ATP ratio as well as other extracellular metabolic stressors activate AMPK.
  The effect of these mediators on metabolic reprogramming is listed in Table . PFKFB3
  converts fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which in turn activates
  phosphofructokinase-1 and promotes the rate of glycolysis. Citrate metabolism produces
  acetyl-CoA, which is converted to malonyl-CoAs for fatty acid synthesis. Arachidonic
  acid and its derived inflammatory prostaglandins are produced from the same pathway.
  Arginase regulates the ornithine cycle, which is involved in the production of polyamines,
  a prominent feature of metabolism in M2 macrophages.'
