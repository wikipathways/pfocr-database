caption: Genes are represented as nodes, biological relationships between two nodes
  as lines. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up- (red) or down-
  (green) regulation in CRI-G1-RS cells relative to CRI-G1-RR cells; gray node color
  indicates genes showing no differential expression between RR and RS cells, while
  white node color marks genes that were not present on the array. Protein complexes/gene
  groups are indicated by nodes with double outlines; color shading within such a
  node indicates that genes within the complex/gene group showed different expression
  changes. The analysis was performed on 3917 probes with FDR-adjusted p-value≤0.001,
  regardless of the fold change. When multiple probes were present for a single gene,
  the probe with the smallest p-value was used.
