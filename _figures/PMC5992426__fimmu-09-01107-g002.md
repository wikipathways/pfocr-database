caption: Potential venues of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) altering neuroinflammation.
  Moderate PAE leads to epigenetic alterations of neural gene expression that may
  extend to glial-immune cells altering their basal activation status and function
  (not shown here). Based on current supporting evidence, this schematic diagram shows
  several other potential mechanisms underlying PAE’s contribution to central nervous
  system (CNS) inflammation. (A) PAE-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated
  signaling activates the NFκB pathway in microglia and astrocytes leading to production
  of various inflammatory cytokine, as explored in high-alcohol exposure models. PAE-induced
  expression and function of TLRs may lead to altered neuroimmune responses followed
  by subsequent immune activation. (B) PAE increases C–C motif chemokine ligand-2
  (CCL2) production in the CNS that may be released damaged neurons in the CNS and
  also via blood-brain-barrier (BBB). CCL2 acts on peripheral leukocytes to recruit
  them to the CNS. Glial cells also express C–C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)
  and produce inflammatory cytokines in response to CCL2. Similarly, PAE-induced increases
  in adhesions molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1, binds
  with very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) on leukocytes] and leukocyte function-associated
  antigen-1 (LFA-1), in conjunction with altered morphology of glia limitans, may
  facilitate and increase the magnitude of peripheral leukocyte migration across BBB
  following subsequent immune activation. (C) PAE decreases glutamate aspartate transporter
  (GLAST) expression and/or function, decreasing normal glutamate removal by astrocytes,
  with consequent increased neuronal activation, augmenting pathological neuroimmune
  interactions.
