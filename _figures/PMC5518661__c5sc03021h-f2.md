caption: . Organization of the azolemycin biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed pathway
  for azolemycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.264. It is likely that AzmF
  produces exclusively the E-oxime and that azolemycin B arises from facile isomerization
  of the oxime group in azolemycin A. Azolemycin C and D appear to arise from AzmE-catalysed
  O-methylation of the oxime group in azolemycins A and B, respectively.
