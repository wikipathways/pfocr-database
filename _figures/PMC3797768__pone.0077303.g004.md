caption: According to IPA categorization, up-regulated proteins are coloured in red.
  The assessment of significantly enriched processes networks for differentially expressed
  proteins was performed by evaluating the probability of a random intersection between
  the differentially expressed proteins with functional processes by applying the
  hypergeometric test. The pathway components identified by the algorithm or with
  no significant differences in their expression levels are reported in white and
  blue, respectively. Molecules are named according to IPA software.
