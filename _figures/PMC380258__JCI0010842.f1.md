caption: Pleiotropic effects of insulin to promote adipose storage. Insulin stimulates
  differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. In adipocytes, insulin promotes
  lipogenesis by stimulating the uptake of glucose and lipoprotein-derived fatty acids
  and by inducing ADD-1/SREBP-1c, which regulates genes promoting fatty acid synthesis
  and lipogenesis, not only in adipocytes but also in hepatocytes. Insulin may also
  regulate transcription through Forkhead transcription factors. Insulin diminishes
  triglyceride breakdown by inhibiting lipolysis. Many of these metabolic pathways
  are regulated by the PI3K signaling pathway.
