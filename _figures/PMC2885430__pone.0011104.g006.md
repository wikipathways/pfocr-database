caption: (a) Non-stressing conditions. The CRD domains of Wsc1 sensors interact with
  cell wall glucans. Two representative glucan chains of the cell wall (CW, shaded
  in grey) are depicted as interconnected orange dots. Binding of the CRD domain should
  be transient to allow for lateral movement of sensors in the cell wall and plasma
  membrane. The CRD domain is followed by a Ser/Thr-rich (STR) region, with blue lines
  indicating mannosylation. The single transmembrane domain (TMD) of Wsc1 is shown
  as a red cylinder spanning the plasma membrane (PM). The cytoplasmic tail is curled
  and not competent for signalling to the thus inactive downstream components Rom2
  and Rho1 (light blue and yellow, respectively). (b) As a first response to cell
  wall stress, the glucan chains are stretched, exerting a force on the Wsc1-STR nanospring  through
  their coupling to CRD. The induced conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain
  of the sensor, designated by the straight red bar, allows it to interact with and
  activate Rom2 (dark blue), which in turn promotes activation (exchange of GDP for
  GTP) of Rho1 (bright yellow), and signalling to the downstream components of the
  CWI pathway. Concomitantly, the CRD domain adapts an interaction-competent surface
  structure. (c) Intermolecular interactions of the CRD domains promote sensor clustering,
  with a concomitant increase of the downstream-signalling components at the internal
  side of the plasma membrane. This local accumulation enhances the stress signal
  and the cellular response. We propose to call this signalling complex a sensosome.
