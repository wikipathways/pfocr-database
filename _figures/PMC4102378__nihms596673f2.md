caption: The WNT signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway is a central regulatory
  mechanism of gene expression that is present in vertebrates and invertebrates and
  is highly conserved in both. It has an essential role in embryonic development but
  also functions in differentiated cells in a variety of processes including cell
  cycle regulation. Activation of the ‘canonical’ pathway is primarily mediated via
  the binding of soluble Wnt ligand(s) to Frizzled (Frz), a serpentine receptor, and
  the low density lipoprotein receptor-related (LRP) co-receptors, LRP5 and 6(see
  ). This transduces an activating signal to Disheveled (Dsh). Upon activation, Dsh
  is released from its complex with the cytosolic end of the Frz receptor and acts
  as an inhibitor of proteolytic degradation of β catenin. Targeting of β catenin
  for proteolysis is accomplished by axin-mediated phosphorylation (in association
  with a large complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC), type 2 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP2A)) of serine
  and threonine residues on a region of β catenin that is encoded by exon 3 of the
  β catenin gene. As proteolysis of β catenin is blocked by Dsh, steady state cytoplasmic
  levels rise which is followed by translocation of β catenin into the nucleus where
  it accumulates. Overexpression of D-type cyclins abrogates G1/S checkpoint controls
  that can lead to the accumulation of oncogenic mutations. Cytoplasmic levels of
  β catenin are also regulated by cell-cell and/or cell-substrate interactions via
  E-cadherin and integrin cell surface receptors respectively. In the case of E-cadherin,
  β catenin bound to the actin cytoskeleton with α catenin is released into the cytoplasm
  by receptor activation. In the cytoplasm, β catenin may either be translocated into
  the nucleus or targeted for degradation by phosphorylation. Integrins act to modulate
  cytoplasmic levels of β catenin by inactivating GSK-3 by phosphorylation thereby
  inhibiting the proteolytic degradation of β catenin mediated by the GSK-3/APC/PP2A/axin
  complex.
