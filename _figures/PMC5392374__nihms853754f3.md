caption: '(Left) Symbiosis: A symbiotic gut microbiota operates under a functional
  intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier, with steady state proportions of mucus,
  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), antimicrobial peptides, and secretory IgA,
  which in turn contain the microbiota in the intestinal lumen. Under tight control
  by IECs, the intestinal immune system within the gut lamina propria becomes largely
  tolerant to the resident commensals. Signaling cascades that occur downstream of
  toll-like receptors (TLRs) are used by IECs to detect microbes through PRRs. Upon
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of TLRs, the MYD88 protein is recruited, activating
  the NF-κB pathway, leading to production of antimicrobial proteins and proinflammatory
  cytokines. In a symbiotic gut, IECs are desensitized by repeated exposure to LPS
  or are attenuated by LPS-mediated downregulation of the IL-1 receptor–associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK1), an activator of the NF-κB cascade. Exposure to LPS induces epithelial
  cells to secrete TGF-β, B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), and a
  proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), all of which promote the development of tolerogenic
  responses to the microbiota. CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) support the development
  of regulatory T (Treg) cells to secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, and together they stimulate
  the production of commensal-specific IgA. (Right) Dysbiosis: Increased intestinal
  exposure of diverse PAMPs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic debris, and toxins
  leads to microbial dysbiosis and overgrowth of “pathobionts”, transformed symbiotic
  bacteria now under pathologic conditions. Pathobiont overgrowth leads to the loss
  of barrier integrity and a breach in the IEC barrier. Translocation of bacteria
  and bacterial components triggers the intestinal immune system through TLR activation,
  resulting in potentially harmful effector T cell responses set to clear invading
  bacteria. Ultimately, the secretion of IL-1 and IL-6 from IECs fuels a TH1 and TH17
  response by DCs and macrophages and leads to higher levels of commensal-specific
  IgG by B cells.'
