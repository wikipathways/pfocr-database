caption: A role for FabD in ACP balance and as a determining factor of FASII bypass
  is proposed. Indicated pathways and regulatory functions are as previously identified.
  In grey, the inhibited FASII elongation pathway. FASII initiation enzyme FabD uses
  ACP and malonyl-CoA to synthesize malonyl-ACP. In FASII inhibitory conditions, PlsX
  would compete for ACP pools to convert exogenous fatty acids (turquoise) into phospholipids.
  Less efficient activity of FabD196 variants () would leave ACP available for the
  PlsX reaction in the indicated direction (PlsX is a potentially reversible enzyme),
  as indicated by orange dashed arrow. Fak-PlsY and Fak-PlsX-PlsC as proposed here,
  mediate acyl group joining respectively to positions 1 and 2 of the glycerol-3-phosphate
  (G3P) backbone. FA, fatty acid; FA-ACP, acyl-ACP; FA-PO4, acyl-phosphate.
