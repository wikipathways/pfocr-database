caption: The regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in idiopathic pulmonary
  fibrosis (IPF) by ferroptosis. TGF-β1 stimulation upregulates the expression of
  transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) in human lung fibroblasts, leading to increased intracellular
  Fe2+ levels, which promotes EMT. TGF-β1 also suppresses the GPX4-GSH defense pathway
  against ferroptosis, while RSL3 can induce both EMT and ferroptosis in IPF by directly
  inhibiting GPX4. NRF2 translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with small Maf proteins,
  and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE), thereby activating transcription
  of target genes to maintain cellular homeostasis. Bach1 inhibits the NRF2 signaling
  pathway by competitively binding to NRF2 dimers, thereby facilitating EMT
