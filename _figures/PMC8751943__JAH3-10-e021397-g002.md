caption: A, Treated HIV infection decreases production of angiopoietin1, whereas untreated
  HIV infection increases production of angiopoietin2. Angiopoietin1 binds to and
  activates the Tie2 receptor, signaling to inhibit cell apoptosis via protein kinase
  B‐AKT pathway. AKT inactivates forkhead transcription factor FKHR‐1, which induces
  angiopoietin 2. Angiopoietin 1 activation of Tie2 also inhibits the nuclear factor‐kB
  pathway, thus inhibiting inflammation and endothelial permeability. Overall, angiopoietin1
  stabilizes the endothelium. On the other hand, angiopoietin2 antagonizes the effects
  of angiopoietin1. It is released from the endothelial cell Weibel‐Palade bodies
  in response to cytokines and environmental stressors. Overall, angiopoietin2 destabilizes
  the endothelium triggering endothelial activation and permeability. B, Our study
  results suggest that HIV infection—particularly treated HIV infection—also directly
  impairs microvascular function independent of the Tie2 pathway. ANG indicates angiopoietin;
  NF‐kB, nuclear factor kappa B; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; and VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.
