caption: 'Activation of the NF‐κB signaling pathway in macrophages. Activation of
  NF‐κB in macrophages is mainly associated with pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as
  TNF‐α, or recognition of microbial products by TLRs. These ligand–receptor interactions
  converge on IKK activation through diverse upstream signaling pathways. The IKK
  complex, consisting of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, can degrade IκB and thereby activate
  NF‐κB. Activated NF‐κB mediates the expression of a series of pro‐inflammatory cytokine
  and chemokine genes. In addition, TLR4 can mediate type I interferon expression
  by activating IRF3 through TRIF, and TNF‐α mediates caspase‐3‐dependent apoptosis
  by activating FADD through TNFR1. Abbreviations: TLR, Toll‐like receptor; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary‐response protein 88; TRIF, TIR domain‐containing
  adaptor protein inducing IFN‐β; IRAK, IL‐1R‐associated kinase; TRAF, tumor‐necrosis

  kinase; TAB, TAK1‐binding protein 1; TBK, TRAF‐family‐member‐associated NF‐κB activator‐binding
  kinase 1; IKK, inhibitor of nuclear factor‐κB (IκB)‐kinase; SHP2, Src homology 2
