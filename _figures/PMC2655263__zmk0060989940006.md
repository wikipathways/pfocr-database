caption: Proposed model for the role of Mph1, Esc2, and Sgs1 in processing recombination
  intermediates and mediating checkpoint signaling. MMS-induced DNA lesions cause
  discontinuous DNA synthesis, leading to the accumulation of postreplicative ssDNA
  gaps. These ssDNA gaps become coated with RPA, which directly activates the DNA
  damage checkpoint. ssDNA gaps can be repaired by Rad51-dependent homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) or by other redundant repair pathways (e.g., translesion synthesis).
  Esc2 and Sgs1 act downstream of Rad51 to process distinct HRR intermediates (denoted
  as 1 and 2, respectively) and communicate with the checkpoint machinery. Mph1 may
  act at an intermediate step, downstream of Rad51, to control the overall balance
  between the putative Esc2- and Sgs1-dependent processes. The Esc2 arm of the pathway
  (left) is entirely Mph1-dependent, whereas the Sgs1 pathway (right) is largely independent
  of Mph1, although a fraction of Sgs1 substrates are Mph1-dependent. In the absence
  of both Esc2 and Sgs1, checkpoint activation is impaired after DNA damage, and cells
  attempt to traverse mitosis with unprocessed HRR intermediates, leading to an aberrant
  mitosis. Mutation of RAD51 abolishes HRR of MMS-induced DNA lesions and leads to
  the accumulation of unrepaired RPA-coated ssDNA gaps. These cause prolonged activation
  of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to a checkpoint-mediated arrest.
