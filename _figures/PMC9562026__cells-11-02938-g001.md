caption: 'Cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The primary method of obtaining energy is
  the oxidation of glucose; under normoxic conditions, this begins in the cytosol
  through glycolysis, followed by the decarboxylation of pyruvate, then the TCA cycle
  where NADH and FADH2 are obtained, which, by giving up their electrons to the chain
  transport electrons, create an electrochemical proton gradient in the mitochondrial
  intermembrane and allow ATP synthase to release ATP molecules. In hypoxia, the enzymes
  involved in the glycolytic pathway, such as PDH, are inhibited by PDK1, decreasing
  the production of acetyl-CoA and increasing the production of lactate due to the
  activity of the enzyme LDH. Abbreviations: TCA: Tricarboxylic acid; NADH: reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FADH2: reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide; ATP:
  adenosine-5’-triphosphate; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase;
  HIF-α: Hypoxia Inducible Factor α subunit; HIF-β: Hypoxia Inducible Factor β subunit;
  Dotted line: HIF-α mitochondrial target gene.'
