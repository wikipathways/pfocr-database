caption: Signaling pathways involved in radiation-induced pyroptosis and ferroptosis.
  Various pathways induce ferroptosis directly or indirectly by affecting the activity
  of glutathione peroxidase(GPXs). These pathways include system Xc-, P53, GPX4, transportation
  of voltage-dependent anion channels/VDACs, methionine sulfur transfer pathway, heme
  oxygenase 1/HO-1, and the internal iron source of transferrin.
