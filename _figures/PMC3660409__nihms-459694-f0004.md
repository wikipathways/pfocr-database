caption: Regulation of alternative splicing by signaling. The p38 kinase transduces
  stress signals to hnRNP A1 by the MAPK pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway, by regulating
  GSK3, phosphorylates and potentiates the activity of PSF by releasing the splicing
  regulator from the inhibitory complex with TRAP150. Growth factor signals activate
  both the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to modify Sam68 and thePI3K-Akt pathway. Activated
  Akt binds to SRPKs and induces their release from the inhibitory heat shock complexes.
  This triggers nuclear translocation of SRPKs, which is antagonized by 14-3-3 proteins
  and enhanced by Hsp90. In the nucleus, SRPKs act in synergy with Clk to phosphorylate
  SR proteins. There is evidence suggesting that activated Akt may also regulate Clk
  in the nucleus. In addition, it is likely that signal transduction pathways highlighted
  here may induce post-translational modification of multiple splicing regulators,
  which may function in a combinatorial fashion to modulate splice site selection
  in the nucleus. The unique spectrum of splicing regulators, coupled with distinct
  activities of individual signaling pathways, may be responsible for specific splicing
  programs in different cell types or during development.
