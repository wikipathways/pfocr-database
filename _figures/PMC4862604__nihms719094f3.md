caption: 'During the HR process, once resection occurs, homology search and DNA-strand
  invasion generate D loops, a key intermediate for all subpathways of HR. This reaction
  catalyzed by RAD51 is negatively controlled at different levels. At the presynaptic
  level, Polυ prevents RAD51 nucleofilament formation. Postsynaptically, many proteins
  such as yeast Srs2 or human PARI, RECQL5, and BLM are able to dismantle formed RAD51
  nucleofilaments. Additionally, HR can also be regulated at the level of strand exchange
  by RTEL1- or FANCM-mediated D-loop displacement. Concomitantly, players that negatively
  regulate HR promote DSB repair through alternative error-prone mechanisms such as
  alt-EJ or SSA. Abbreviations: CO, crossover; SDSA, synthesis-dependent strand annealing;
  TLS, translesion synthesis; SSA, single-strand annealing; alt-EJ, alternative end
  joining; DSB, double-strand break; HR, homologous recombination.'
