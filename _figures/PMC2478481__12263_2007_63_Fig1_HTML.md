caption: Regulation of NF-κB activation by cellular signaling molecules. Upon stimulation
  of cells, activation of protein kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) induce phosphorylation of IKKα/β. IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated by
  IKKα/β and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The resulting free NF-κB
  dimer (p50-p65) translocates to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of
  multiple target genes. Some of the aforementioned proteine kinases may also catalyze
  the phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NF-κB, facilitating the nuclear translocation
  and/or interaction with the coactivator CBP/p300. Chemopreventive phytochemicals
  can inhibit phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination of IκBα or phosphorylation of
  p65 induced by several oncogenic stimuli, thereby hampering the nuclear translocation
  and DNA binding of NF-κB. The cysteine residues present in IKKα/β are critical for
  catalytic activity and can be oxidized by prooxidants or covalent modified by electrophiles,
  leading to inactivation of the enzyme. Some dietary phytochemicals or their metabolites
  can act as prooxidants capable of directly oxidizing cysteine thiol or indirectly
  by altering cellular redox status and subsequently releasing ROS. Other groups of
  chemopreventive phytochemicals, especially those capable of acting as Michael reaction
  acceptors, are electrophilic per se and can hence directly modify the cysteine residues
  of IKK. Similar thiol modification by electrophilic phytochemicals was also found
  to occur for the p50 subunit of NF-κB [], but this event is not included in this
  illustration to avoid complexity
