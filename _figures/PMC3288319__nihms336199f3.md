caption: Phytoestrogens-induced NO release from endothelial cells. Like estradiol,
  phytoestrogens bind to ER on EC and increase the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3), which stimulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ forms
  a complex with calmodulin (CAM), which in turn binds to and causes initial activation
  of eNOS, its dissociation from caveolin-1, and translocation to intracellular sites.
  Phytoestrogens may also activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), leading
  to transformation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates Akt. ER-mediated activation of Akt or
  MAPK pathway causes phosphorylation of cytosolic eNOS and its second translocation
  back to the cell membrane where it undergoes myristoylation and palmitoylation,
  a process required for its full activation. Activated eNOS promotes the transformation
  of L-arginine to L-citrulline and the production of NO, which is released by EC
  and causes VSM relaxation.
