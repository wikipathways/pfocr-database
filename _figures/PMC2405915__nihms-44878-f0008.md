caption: Summary of the signaling pathways involved in hair follicle morphogenesis
  and regeneration. This schematic summarizes many of the signaling pathways involved
  in hair follicle morphogenesis and hair follicle regeneration. Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  acts early in hair follicle specification and quiescent bulge stem cell (SC) activation.
  The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway acts in the second step to promote embryonic
  and adult hair germ proliferation. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Notch, and
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways act further downstream to allow the normal differentiation
  of matrix cells into the hair shaft (HS) and its inner root sheath (IRS) envelope.
