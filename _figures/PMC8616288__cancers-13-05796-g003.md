caption: Involvement of FGF/FGFRs in cellular processes during the development of
  drug resistance. The active FGF/FGFR complex leads to avoidance of apoptosis through
  increased expression of apoptosis inhibitors (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), inhibition of its
  activators (BAD, BAX) or activation and stabilization of MDM2, with consequent increased
  ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Additionally, p53 degradation can be enhanced
  by the formation of a ternary complex of p53, MDM2, and Enigma protein. Another
  mechanism of action is indirect inhibition of caspase 3/7 and caspase 8 by increasing
  the expression of survivin or c–FLIP, respectively. It is also likely that increased
  nuclear localization of FGFRs may be associated with enhanced survival of cancer
  cells and development of drug resistance. FGF/FGFR (especially involving FGF2) also
  promotes angiogenesis through increased expression of VEGF, HA, and c-MYC, and enhanced
  secretion of HGF. EMT, in turn, is a consequence of activation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway leading to stabilization of Twist, switching of FGFR isoforms from IIIb
  to IIIc, switching of cadherins (from E-cadherin to N-cadherin), upregulation of
  mesenchymal markers (such as Twist and vimentin) and transcription factors (Slug
  and Snail), and activation of downstream signaling proteins (such as Smad3 and mTOR).
  Furthermore, the FGFR4-R388 mutant can interact with matrix metalloproteinases (e.g.,
  MT1-MMP), proteins involved in tumor invasion.
