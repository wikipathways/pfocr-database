caption: SHIP2 regulates the insulin signalling pathway. A, Simplified cartoon of
  the insulin signalling pathway indicating various points of regulation of its activity.
  Binding of insulin to its receptor leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase
  (PI3K), phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‐trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) and subsequent activation
  (phosphorylation, P) of Akt. This leads to translocation of insulin responsive glucose
  transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane and uptake of glucose into cells. The
  activity of the pathway can be modulated at the level of (1) the insulin receptor
  and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, (2) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  of phosphatidylinositols and (3) exocytosis or (4) endocytosis of GLUT4. Examples
  of proteins regulating the different steps in podocytes are indicated. B, SHIP2
  suppresses the insulin signalling pathway by hydrolysing PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2.
  This reduces glucose uptake
