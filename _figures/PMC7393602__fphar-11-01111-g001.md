caption: Nav1.5 promotes the activity of NHE-1, resulting in the acidification of
  the peri-membrane, which favors the proteolytic activity of Cat and MMPs (yellow
  line). Nav1.5 also promotes invasiveness by the CD44-src-cortactin signaling pathway.
  After phosphorylation, cortactin releases actin-severing cofilin, promoting the
  formation of actin barbed ends of invadopodia (red line). Overexpression of CD44
  upregulates the expression and activity of NHE-1, resulting in the expression level
  of MMPs (MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14) by increasing phosphorylated ERK1/2 (black line).
  Nav1.5 dependent Vm depolarization regulates Rac1 activation by its interaction
  with phosphatidylserine (blue solid line). Rac1 regulates the Arp2/3 complex and
  is closely associated with phosphorylation of cortactin and cofilin, promoting the
  promigratory phenotype (blue dotted line). High expression of NaV1.5 induces expression
  of SNAI1, triggering the EMT and pro-metastatic effect of breast cancer cells (purple
  line). (Dotted line indicates that the mechanism exists but has not been confirmed
  in breast cancer).
