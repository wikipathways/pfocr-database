caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways activated by mitogenic concentrations
  of TNF-α and roles of furin, MT1-MMP, and MMP2 in the activation of the nSMase in
  mesenchymal cells. nSMase is the first step of the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway,
  which leads to S1P generation (when the intermediate steps, including ceramidase
  and SK, are working). S1P can in turn interact with Edg/S1P receptors, which trigger
  a signaling mitogenic cascade involving ERK1/2 activation. This effect is mimicked
  by adding exogenous activated MT1-MMP and MMP2 (light blue). The sites of action
  of the molecular and pharmacological inhibitors used in the paper are indicated
  by green labels. Sm, sphingomyelinase.
