caption: GRAIL and Otub1 regulation by the mTOR pathway controls naïve CD4 T cell
  proliferation. (left panel) Productive activation of naive CD4 T cells leading to
  proliferation comes about through TCR engagement (signal 1) and CD28 costimulation
  (signal 2); IL-2 production, signaling through the IL-2R leading to phosphorylation
  of Akt and activation of mTOR, expression of Otub1 protein, and subsequent GRAIL
  degradation, allowing proliferation to occur. (Right panel) Three independent mechanisms
  that block mTOR activation result in inhibition of naïve T cell proliferation. CTLA4-Ig
  blocks CD28 costimulation, does not allow IL-2 production, thus prevents Akt phosphorylation,
  mTOR is inactive, and Otub1 protein is absent, leading to the maintenance of GRAIL,
  inhibiting proliferation. Anti-IL-2 blocks IL-2R engagement, thus preventing Akt
  phosphorylation, mTOR is inactive, and Otub1 protein is absent, leading to the maintenance
  of GRAIL, inhibiting proliferation. Rapamycin blocks the activity of mTOR, prevents
  protein expression of Otub1, leading to the maintenance of GRAIL, inhibiting proliferation.
