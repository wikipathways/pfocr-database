caption: 'The mechanism of P. gingivalis in suppressing macrophage immune response:
  Extracellular P. gingivalis increases CR3 activation in macrophages while breakdowns
  C5 into C5a. The interaction of P. gingivalis with CR3 activates ERK 1/2, which
  reduces the cytokines level. The hemagglutinin/adhesion domain of gingipains cleave
  the LPS receptor CD14 from the surface of macrophages, resulted in a lower ability
  to phagocytize bacteria. The PD-L1 in macrophages is upregulated by P. gingivalis,
  which binds to PD-1 on T-cells and inhibits T-cell immune surveillance. CD47 is
  a phagocytosis inhibitor expressed on almost all cancer cells, it is regulated by
  P. gingivalis and protects cancer cells for macrophage phagocytosis. Once P. gingivalis
  enters into macrophages, intracellular P. gingivalis secretes OMVs containing SLs
  reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and initiates C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk
  signaling, activate the downstream PI3K pathway to suppress phagolysosomal maturation,
  avoiding being killed.'
