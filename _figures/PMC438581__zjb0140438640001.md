  with PYR plus GA3P leading to the formation of MEP from DXP and through subsequent
  steps via the LytB enzyme to IPP and DMAPP (, , , , , , ). Fosmidomycin (white arrow)
  inhibits the synthesis of MEP and blocks the growth of the bacterium. Asterisks
  denote differences in Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 where PYR, DXP, and MEP do not
  serve as substrates in vitro; where IPP isomerase activity has not been observed;
  and where fosmidomycin does not inhibit isoprenoid biosynthesis or growth in the
  cyanobacterium (), and the triangle indicates where pentose phosphate cycle substrates
  may possibly enter downstream of MEP.
