caption: 'The apoptotic pathways of NF-κB: TRAIL mediating the extrinsic pathway and
  p53 mediating the intrinsic pathway. Numbers in circles indicate the steps of the
  apoptotic pathways inhibited by molecules that are induced by NF-κB activation including
  c-FLIP, Bcl-2 family''s molecules, and IAPs. (1), the activation of procaspase 8
  and 10 is inhibited by cFLIP. (2), the prosurvival signals, such as Bcl2, Bcl-XL,
  Mcl-1 inhibit the pro-apoptotic molecules Bak/Bax. (3), the inhibitors of apoptosis
  (IAPs) family proteins inhibit the effector caspases 3, 6 and 7. (4), NF-κB inhibits
  directly or indirectly the transcription factor p53. Arrows indicate activating
  steps, and bars indicate inhibitory steps.'
