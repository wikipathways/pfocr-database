caption: The role of dietary fiber in regulating serotonin signaling pathway and placental
  and fetal development in gestating sows. Serotonin, as known as 5-hydroxytryptamine
  (5-HT), is mainly produced in the gut by enterochromaffin cells (ECs). In the gut,
  tryptophan is first converted to 5-hydroxytroptophan (5-HTP) by tryptophan hydroxylase
  1 (TPH1), and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) subsequently converts 5-HTP
  into serotonin. Gut-derived serotonin can be transported into platelets via serotonin
  transporter (SERT) which allows the distribution of gut-derived serotonin to peripheral
  tissues (including the placenta) to regulate diverse functions. The placenta was
  also capable of producing serotonin. Dietary fiber supplementation increased the
  colonic concentration by promoting serotonin synthesis in the colon by changing
  the microbial composition and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), leading to an increase
  in the concentration of maternal serotonin. Meanwhile, dietary fiber supplementation
  enhanced the serotonin transport from the mother to the placenta, and then increased
  the placental serotonin concentration, accompanied by the promotion of fetal and
  placental development. The deprivation of dietary fiber inhibited the serotonin
  synthesis in the colon and the serotonin transport from the mother to the placenta,
  leading to the decrease of serotonin in the placenta. However, the deprivation of
  dietary fiber increased the serotonin transport from the colon to the blood and
  the serotonin synthesis in the placenta, which might be a compensatory response
  by the body to compensate for the deficient serotonin in the mother and placenta.
