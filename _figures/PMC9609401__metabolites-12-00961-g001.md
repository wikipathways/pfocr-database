caption: One carbon metabolism is a collection of cyclical metabolic pathways that
  orchestrates myriad metabolic processes. The one carbon pathway is comprised of
  the folate cycle and the methionine cycle. Folate enters the pathway through a two-step
  reaction that generates tetrahydrofolate (THF) with the dihydrofolate reductase
  enzyme (DHFR). Within the methionine cycle, dietary methionine is catabolized by
  methionine adenosyltransferase 2A or 1A (MAT2A/MAT1A) to produce the universal methyl
  donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Upon substrate methylation, SAM is converted to
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and then converted by adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY)
  to homocysteine (Hcy). The methionine cycle is completed by the conversion of Hcy
  back to methionine by methionine synthase (MS). Alternatively, Hcy can fed into
  the transsulfuration pathway for glutathione synthesis and redox metabolism using
  vitamin B6-dependent enzymes. The methionine salvage pathway also sparks off the
  methionine cycle to produce the by-product methylthioadenosine (MTA) from methionine
  for polyamine biosynthesis. Figure made with BioRender.
