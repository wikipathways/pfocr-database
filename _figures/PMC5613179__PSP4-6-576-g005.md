caption: Multiple clearance pathways affecting the pharmacokinetics of a monoclonal
  antibody (mAb). Depicted is a typical two‐compartment PK model for a mAb with administration
  of a dose (D) that may undergo presystemic degradation (degradation rate constant
  [kdeg]), concentrations of the mAb in the central (Ab1) and peripheral (Ab2) compartment,
  and interdepartmental clearance (Q). The PK model includes two linear clearance
  pathways representative of unspecific proteolytic degradation, one from the central
  compartment (CL1) and one from the peripheral compartment (CL2), as well as recycling
  through the neonatal neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn)‐mediated salvage
  pathway (recycling rate constant (Krmr)). Added to these clearance pathways is,
  on the right‐hand side, a target‐mediated disposition pathway that constitutes interaction
  of the mAb with its pharmacologic target receptor, which is in a homeostatic equilibrium
  of synthesis and degradation (rate constants ksyn and kdeg). The dynamic equilibrium
  for the formation of the resulting mAb‐receptor complex (Ab‐R) is determined through
  the association rate constant kon and the dissociation rate constant koff. The formation
  of Ab‐R not only elicits the pharmacologic effect but also triggers degradation
  of the complex. Thus, target binding and subsequent Ab‐R degradation constitute
  an additional clearance pathway for the mAb (CL3). The left‐hand side of the graphic
  depicts the effect of an immune response to the mAb resulting in anti‐drug antibody
  (ADA) formation. Again, the circulating concentration of the ADA is determined by
  a homeostatic equilibrium between its formation rate (kformation) and a catabolic
  turnover process (rate constant (kcat)). The ADA response results in the formation
  of immune complexes with the drug (ADA‐Ab), dependent on the dissociation constant
  Kd. Dependent on the size and structure of the immune complexes, endogenous elimination
  pathways through the reticuloendothelial system may be triggered, most likely via
  fragment crystallizable‐gamma (Fcγ)‐mediated endocytosis. Thus, immune complex formation
  and subsequent degradation may constitute an additional clearance pathway (CL4)
  for mAbs (modified from ref. 97; reproduced with permission of Springer).
