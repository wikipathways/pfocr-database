caption: Cross talk between the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family and Wnt
  signaling at multiple points. In the absence of TGF-β stimulation (middle), Smad3
  can form a complex with Axin and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, where it is
  phosphorylated by GSK-3β, leading to its degradation. In the presence of TGF-β or
  bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) stimulation (right), GSK-3β also phosphorylates
  the activated R-Smads (Smad1 or Smad3) in the linker region to inhibit their activity
  and promote degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3β and stabilizes the Smad proteins.
  Other components of the TGF-β pathway, including Smurf1, Smurf2, and Smad7, also
  modulate Wnt signaling. In response to stimulation by Wnt, the canonical Wnt pathway
  and the Smad pathway can synergize to activate transcription of target genes. Smad3
  facilitates β-catenin nuclear translocation and coordinates with the complex of
  β-catenin and T-cell factor (TCF) or lymphoid enhancer–binding factor 1 (LEF1) at
  regulatory promoter sequences of target genes that contain TCF- or LEF1-binding
  sites and/or Smad-binding sequences to regulate gene expression.
