caption: Role of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase downstream of the B cell receptor. Signaling
  cascade showing important events downstream of B cell receptor (BCR). Antigen engagement
  by the BCR results in the formation of a micro-signalosome whereby BTK activates
  four families of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases that transduce key signaling
  events including phospholipase Cγ, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation,
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-кB) pathway components
  and activation of the serine/threonine kinase AKT (PKB). In addition, BTK mediated
  signaling events are regulated by various phosphatases that can be recruited to
  the cell membrane, following crosslinking of inhibitory receptors, e.g., FcγRIIB
  that is exclusively expressed on B cells and signals upon immune complex binding.
