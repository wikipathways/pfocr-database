caption: The 10-miRNA-score predicts defects in the HR pathway in ovarian cancer.
  (A) The genomic alterations in HR pathway related genes between the high 10-miRNA-score
  (green) and low 10-miRNA-score (red) groups in ovarian cancer. (B) Frequency of
  HR defects. The left panel shows the frequency of HR genes in the high 10-miRNA-score
  group compared with that in the low 10-miRNA-score group. The right panel shows
  the number of tumours with amplification of EMSY or copy number loss of PTEN in
  the high 10-miRNA-score and low 10-miRNA-score groups. (C,D and E) Alterations of
  the PI3K/RAS (C), RB (D) and FOXM1 (E) signalling pathways that are commonly altered
  in ovarian cancer. Alterations are defined by somatic mutations, amplifications
  and up- or downregulated gene expressions. The background colour of each node represents
  activation (light blue) or inactivation (light red). The percentages of alteration
  are in green frames for the low 10-miRNA-score group or in red frames for the high
  10-miRNA-score group.
