caption: 'The most prominently affected gene network in response to FA in TM 93 cells.
  Network was classified as: Cell Cycle, Cell-mediated Immune Response, Cellular Assembly
  and Organization. Regulation of this network in TM 93 cells is compared across treatment
  with DEX, FA or TA. Pathway contains jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 1B transcriptional
  repressor (JARID1B), which occupies a central position in this network. Red: induction;
  green: repression; white: unaffected; color intensity correlates with fold change;
  number: fold change. The diagram was obtained from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity®
  Systems).'
