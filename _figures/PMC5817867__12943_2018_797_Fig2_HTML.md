caption: RTK-regulated signaling in breast cancer progression. VEGFR activates JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway to induce cancer stem cell phenotype through Myc and Sox2 expression.
  Mutant p53 induces the expression of VEGFR through the interaction with SWI/SNF
  complex. EGFR-regulated signaling also plays pivotal role in angiogenesis and metastasis.
  EGFR regulates the activation of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathway to induce expression
  of Sox2 and other stem cell markers leading to enrichment of cancer stem cells.
  EGFR induces Akt phosphorylation to promote inflammation. PDGFR is expressed on
  stromal cells such as fibroblasts and is a marker of fibroblast activation. PDGFR-regulated
  STAT activation is involved in regulation of miR-9-mediated differentiation of cancer
  cells to endothelial cells leading to angiogenesis. FGFR-activated MAPK pathway
  induces EMT and CSC phenotype. Cooperation between the FGFR and HER2 regulates nuclear
  translocation of Cyclin D1 leading to enhanced cancer cell proliferation
