caption: Summary of carbohydrate and amino acids connection nodes and number of active
  flux reaction within amino acid pathways. Standard three-letter amino acids code
  is used to denote the pathway names. The carbohydrate nodes of the central metabolism
  are highlighted as red and the branching out amino acid pathways are boxed in blue.
  The purple boxes denote the fatty acids connections from Acetyl Co A and Acetoacetyl
  Co A. The numbers of reactions for each pathway are represented in the parenthesis.
