caption: 'Schematic overview of cyanobacterial decarboxylation pathway’s integration
  into C3 photosynthetic pathway. The integrated pathway includes: ATP synthesis through
  light reaction in thylakoid membrane, RuBP carboxylation and synthesis of intermediates
  responsible for regeneration of RuBP, and starch synthesis through Calvin cycle
  in chloroplast stroma, Photorespiratory pathway which involves oxygenation of RuBP
  and production of respective pathway intermediates in chloroplast and cytosol, cyanobacterial
  decarboxylation pathway with 4 enzymes involved in GCA catabolism and generate 2
  molecules of CO2 in chloroplast, and sucrose synthesis pathway in cytosol. The compartment
  labelled is TM, transport membrane.'
