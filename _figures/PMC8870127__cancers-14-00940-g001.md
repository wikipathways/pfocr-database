caption: Canonical TGF-β Signaling. The TGF-β signaling pathway initiates with the
  binding of the TGF-β ligand to TGFβRII. Activated TGFβRII forms a complex with and
  phosphorylates TGFβRI. Upon phosphorylation by TGFβRI, R-Smads, Smad2, and Smad3,
  form a transcriptional complex with the co-Smad, Smad4. This complex then translocates
  into the nucleus, associates with DNA by cooperating with various cofactors, and
  regulates target gene expression. Smad6 and Smad7, the I-Smads, function as negative
  regulators of TGF-β/Smad signaling.
