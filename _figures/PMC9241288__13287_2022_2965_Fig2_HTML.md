caption: The mechanisms of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for ICH. A After ICH occurs,
  it can cause brain edema through the MAPK signaling pathway. Macrophages can also
  cause brain tissue edema by secreting cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.
  In addition to directly inhibiting the above two methods, MSCs can also secrete
  BDNF to relieve cerebral edema. TNF-α secreted by macrophages can act on MSCs with
  the help of TNFR-1 and finally increase the level of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. PGE2 binds to EP2/EP4 on the surface of macrophages
  to promote IL-10 secretion, thereby inhibiting inflammation. MSCs can directly increase
  the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) through ERK1/2, thereby
  exerting neuroprotective effects. B Damaged tissue stimulates inflammatory cells
  (macrophages, astrocytes) to increase peroxynitrite (ONOO–), a strong oxidant, levels
  through signal pathways. Increased ONOO– can directly damage tight junction proteins
  and can also promote the production of Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and damage
  tight junction proteins, ultimately leading to the blood–brain barrier BBB damage.
  TIMP-1 as a MMP inhibitor can inhibit MMP activation, but increasing ONOO– can also
  inhibit the biological effects of TIMP-1. ONOO– can also inhibit sodium potassium
  pump and cell metabolism to damage BBB. MSCs can secrete TSG-6, which inhibits the
  NF-κB signaling pathway through CD44, thereby inhibiting subsequent biological processes
  to improve damaged BBB
