caption: LCBs, PA, MAPKs, and ROS in the signaling pathways that lead to cell death
  to prevent proliferation of biotroph pathogens. The presence of a biotrophic or
  a hemibiotrophic pathogen is perceived and the information is transduced as a surge
  of long-chain bases at the endoplasmic reticulum in a pathway that involves MPK
  cascades and ROS as illustrated. As a result, cell death is unchained in a very
  restricted zone of the plant tissue. This avoids substrate availability for pathogen
  proliferation, preventing its dissemination. This programmed cell death is a fundamental
  part of the hypersensitive reaction or HR, a successful and effective way of defense
  against pathogens. Exposure to the non-virulent bacterial strain Pst (AvrRpm1) or
  to FB1, the toxin secreted by F. verticillioides, both result in increased levels
  of LCBs and LCB-Ps within the endoplasmic reticulum. Accumulation of these mediators
  ultimately leads to PCD through a mechanism involving the synthesis and accumulation
  of ROS within the chloroplast, following activation of a MAPK cascade that includes
  MPK6. LCB, free long-chain base; LCB-P, phosphorylated form of long-chain base;
  MKK4/MKK5, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activators of MPK6, MPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MP3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; PCD, programmed
  cell death; Pst avrRPM1, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 expressing avrRPM1,
  a bacterial avirulence determinant that responds to the NDR1-dependent CC-NBS-type
  R gene; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
