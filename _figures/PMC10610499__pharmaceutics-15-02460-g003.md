caption: The liver manages a complex antigenic load from the blood, relying on immune
  tolerance mechanisms and mainly LPS tolerance. Myd88-dependent pathways activated
  after LPS engagement to the LPS-MD2 complex are negatively regulated in the case
  of LPS rechallenge. The main mechanisms include the increased activity of TLR4 negative
  regulators (i.e., IRAK-M,A20), decreased TLR4-Myd88 association, decreased IRAKs
  activity, decreased IkBα degradation resulting in decreased NF-κΒ nuclear translocation,
  and the decreased MAPK-mediated activation of JNK,p38 and ERK, resulting in decreased
  AP-1 induced transcription. The net result of these alterations is a reduction in
  the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after repeated exposure to LPS. AP-1,
  activator protein 1; ERKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRAKs, IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinases; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK,mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MD2, myeloid differentiation factor 2; NF-κΒ, nuclear factor-kappa
  B; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor.
