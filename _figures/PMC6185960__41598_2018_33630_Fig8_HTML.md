caption: 'PRT6 regulation of germination and seedling establishment. Model depicting
  regulation by PRT6 of different processes identified or confirmed in this study.
  (A) In wild type plants, PRT6 promotes germination by mediating proteasomal degradation
  of ERFVII transcription factors, which repress germination when stabilised. Germination
  of prt6 seeds is hypersensitive to inhibition by ABA, a phenotype that requires
  the action of ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5 transcription factors. PRT6 and ERFVIIs play several
  roles in seedling establishment: ERFVII stabilisation in the absence of PRT6 function
  leads to an accumulation of oil bodies in endosperm and hypocotyls, indicative of
  a role for PRT6 in reserve mobilisation. Previously, ERFVIIs have been shown to
  repress photomorphogenesis in prt6 seedlings, which have a slow greening phenotype.
  Neither of the establishment functions of PRT6 appears to involve ABA INSENSITIVE
  (ABI) loci, although ABI4 is known to repress photosynthetic gene expression and
  the current study demonstrated that ABI4 transcripts are up-regulated in etiolated
  prt6 seedlings, in an ERFVII-dependent manner. (B) Establishment of prt6 seedlings
  is hypersensitive to exogenous sucrose, an effect that requires ERFVII and ABI action.'
