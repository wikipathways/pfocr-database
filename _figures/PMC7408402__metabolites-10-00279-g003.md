caption: Hypercholesterolemia disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and Treg
  stability. IL-2 signaling induces phosphorylation of STAT5, known to induce and
  sustain Foxp3 expression. GGPP, a product of the mevalonate pathway, is indispensable
  for Treg stability and enhances STAT5 phosphorylation. Accumulation of intracellular
  cholesterol during hypercholesterolemia may inhibit the mevalonate pathway or reduce
  expression of IL-2Rα, leading to diminished Treg stability. Unstable Tregs can lose
  their suppressive phenotype and adapt proatherogenic features, thereby promoting
  atherosclerotic disease development.
