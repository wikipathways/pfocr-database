caption: T-cells in patients with ACS. Atorvastatin decreases toll like receptor (TLR)-4
  gene expression, a pattern-recognition receptor stimulated by several pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including
  bacterial lipolysaccaride (LPS) and ox-LDL, that has been implicated in the initiation
  and progression of atherosclerosis. TLR-4 stimulation induces intracellular pathways
  converging on nuclear factor (NF)-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),
  with subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory
  molecules. Atorvastatin also reduces the expression of the chemokine (C-C motif)
  receptor 2 (CCR2), which is the receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1
  and is involved in CD4+T-cell transendothelial migration and recruitment at the
  site of tissue damage and inflammation. CCR2 intracellular pathway also converges
  on MAPK pathway, resulting in the activation of ERK and JNK and, eventually, of
  nuclear transcription factors FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS)
  and early growth response 1 (EGR1), implicated in the immune response. Indeed, we
  observed an important decrease of EGR1 gene and protein expression by a single high-dose
  of atorvastatin both ex-vivo and in-vivo, suggesting a specific direct effects of
  atorvastatin on EGR1. The final net effect is a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine
  secretion and of chemokine and chemokine receptor synthesis, and an increase of
  anti-inflammatory pathways. *Green arrows indicate the effects of atorvastatin according
  to molecular assays (reduced expression of the TLR4, CCR2, FOS and EGR1 genes and
  of EGR1 protein); † black arrows indicate the opposite effects of atorvastatin on
  IFN-γ (reduced intracellular expression by CD4+CD28nullT-cells) and IL-10 (increased
  intracellular expression by CD4+CD25highT-cells) as assessed by flow-cytometry.
