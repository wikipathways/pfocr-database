caption: 'Adenosine receptor signaling pathway. A1R and A3R are coupled to Gi proteins,
  whereas A2AR and A2BR are coupled to Gs proteins. Grey line: activation of A2AR
  and A2BR leads to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, while
  A1R and A3R trigger a decrease in cAMP production, which is involved in PKA-mediated
  phosphorylation of CREB. Blue line: in addition to the effects on the cAMP pathway,
  all four types of adenosine receptors also interact with PI3K/Akt and MAPK cascades.
  Red line: A2BR and A3R also activate PLC through Gq and are implicated in DAG/PKC
  and Ca2+ signaling. PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; PKC,
