caption: Origin and management of microenvironment acidity in GBM. (A) Glucose and
  glutamine are the primary energy metabolites necessary for driving rapid GBM growth.
  Glucose is the metabolic fuel necessary for nearly all brain functions under normal
  physiological conditions and is the major source of carbons for biomass synthesis
  through the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways in tumor cells. Tumor cells
  metabolize glutamine to glutamate, which is then metabolized to alpha-ketoglutarate.
  Significant energy is generated from the succinyl CoA ligase reaction (substrate
  level phosphorylation) in the glutaminolysis pathway using alpha-ketoglutarate-derived
  succinyl CoA as substrate (see ). In contrast to extracranial tissues, where glutamine
  is the most available amino acid, glutamine is tightly regulated in the brain through
  its involvement in the glutamate-glutamine cycle of neurotransmission (, , ). Glutamate
  is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that must be cleared rapidly following synaptic
  release in order to prevent excitotoxic damage to neurons (, –). Glial cells possess
  transporters for the clearance of extracellular glutamate, which is then metabolized
  to glutamine for delivery back to neurons. Neurons metabolize the glutamine to glutamate,
  which is then repackaged into synaptic vesicles for synaptic release (). This cycle
  maintains low extracellular levels of both glutamate and glutamine in the normal
  neural parenchyma. Disruption of the cycle can provide neoplastic GBM cells access
  to glutamine. Besides serving as a metabolic fuel for the neoplastic tumor cells,
  glutamine is also an important fuel for cells of myeloid linage, which include macrophages,
  monocytes, microglia, and especially the invasive mesenchymal cells in GBM (, ,
  –). In contrast to the proliferative GBM stem cells, the neoplastic GBM mesenchymal
  cells are thought to be derived from microglia or from microglia-stem cell fusion
  hybrids, which would have immuno-suppressive properties (, ). As long as GBM cells
  have access to glucose and glutamine, the tumor will grow and acidify the microenvironment
  making long-term management difficult. The current treatments for GBM (radiation
  and TMZ chemotherapy) will further increase glucose and glutamine availability,
  creating an unnecessary metabolic storm that will enhance microenvironment acidification
  and rapid tumor recurrence. The red hue is indicative of the inflammation and acidification
  of the tumor microenvironment (see text for further details). (B) The simultaneous
  restriction of glucose and glutamine, while elevating non-fermentable, anti-inflammatory
  ketone bodies, will reduce acidification, restore the pH balance of the microenvironment,
  and growth arrest or kill most of the neoplastic cells (–). RAC, reactive astrocytes;
