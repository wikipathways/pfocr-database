caption: Increased MALAT1 in GC cells could impair autophagic flux to aggravate IL-6
  secretion to activate converts NFs to CAFs via paracrine signalling, which resulted
  in GC cell progression. Increased MALAT1 could destabilize PTEN mRNA stability to
  activate AKT/mTOR pathway, which blocked autophagic flux leading to IL-6 overexpression
  induced by SQSTM1/NF-κB pathway. In addition, IL-6 secretion from GC cells stimulates
  NF conversion to CAFs.
