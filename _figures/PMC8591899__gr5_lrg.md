caption: The Keap1/Nrf2 signalling pathway involved in antioxidant production. In
  healthy conditions, Nrf2 is constantly ubiquitinated (Ub) by Keap1 in the cytoplasm
  and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. In presence of ROS or electrophiles,
  Keap1 is inactivated, leading to the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytosol and subsequent
  translocation to the nucleus where it stimulates transcription of many target genes
  with antioxidant response elements (ARE) sequences in their promoters.
