caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and acute kidney injury development (by
  Figdraw). In mouse kidneys undergoing IRI or LPS-induced injury, deletion of TSC1
  in fibroblasts caused activation of Rheb, which in turn activated the mTORC1 signaling
  pathway, causing a significant increase in the downstream abundance of p-S6, and
  consequently protecting renal tubular cells from acute injury. Meanwhile, EDN1 was
  upregulated in renal fibroblasts after TSC1 knockdown and was dependent on the mTORC1-JNK
  pathway, which improved renal function in LPS-induced AKI mice. In a cisplatin-induced
  mouse model of AKI, deletion of Rheb1 signaling in renal tubular cells resulted
  in tubular cell death, mitochondrial defects, and worsening of AKI. In the Lyz-TSC1
  CKO mouse model, deletion of TSC1 promoted macrophage polarization toward M1 early
  in the disease, leading to increased renal impairment after IRI. In contrast, during
  the repair phase of IRI, TSC1 deficiency led to a reduction in macrophage polarization
  toward the M2 type, which attenuated renal fibrosis. IRI: Ischemia-reperfusion injury;
  LPS: Lipopolysaccharides; TSC1: Tuberous sclerosis complex 1; Rheb: Ras homolog
  enriched in brain; p-S6: Phospho-S6; mTORC1: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1; EDN1: Endothelin−1; mTORC1-JNK: Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1-c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase; AKI: Acute kidney injury; Lyz-TSC1 CKO: Myeloid cell-specific
  knockout of TSC1; Rheb1: Ras homolog enriched in brain 1'
