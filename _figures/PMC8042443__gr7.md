caption: A, schematic diagram showing two separate DGKζ signaling complexes, one for
  Rac1 activation (left) and one for RhoA activation (right). Rac1 activation requires
  DGKζ catalytic activity (indicated by the pink glow), which converts DAG to PA.
  Signaling events downstream of Rac1 activation leading to lamellipodia formation
  and macropinocytosis are shown by blue arrows. PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of
  the DGKζ MARCKS domain promotes the assembly of a RhoA signaling complex and decreases
  DGKζ catalytic activity. PKCα-mediated release of RhoA from RhoGDI uses a noncanonical
  activation mechanism requiring PI(4,5)P2 binding to the C2 domain. Activated RhoA
  signals to downstream effectors (red arrows) to drive actomyosin contractility and
  membrane blebbing. The relevant ligands and receptors that activate guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs) specific for each pathway, although somewhat speculative,
  are shown for physiological context. B, proposed switch-like mechanism to regulate
  the balance of Rac1 and RhoA signaling. Left, high DGKζ activity favors Rac1 activation
  and leads to inhibition of Rho signaling by Rac1. Right, PKCα-mediated phosphorylation
  of the MARCKS domain decreases DGKζ catalytic activity, which decreases Rac1 activation
  (dashed arrow), leading to decreased inhibition and a relative increase in RhoA
  signaling. C, schematic diagram of DGKζ showing the N-terminal domain (blue), C1
  domains (green), MARCKS domain (dark blue), catalytic domain (red), ankyrin repeats
  (purple), and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The binding sites for Rac1, RhoA,
  PKCα, and syntrophin (Syn) are indicated. PKCα binds to a region in the catalytic
  domain and phosphorylates DGKζ at Ser-265 in the MARCKS domain. Both Rac1 and RhoA
  bind to the C1A domain and their binding is differentially regulated by MARCKS phosphorylation.

  description: A, schematic diagram showing two separate DGKζ signaling complexes,
    one for Rac1 activation (left) and one for RhoA activation (right). Rac1 activation
    requires DGKζ catalytic activity (indicated by the pink glow), which converts
    DAG to PA. Signaling events downstream of Rac1 activation leading to lamellipodia
    formation and macropinocytosis are shown by blue arrows. PKCα-mediated phosphorylation
    of the DGKζ MARCKS domain promotes the assembly of a RhoA signaling complex and
    decreases DGKζ catalytic activity. PKCα-mediated release of RhoA from RhoGDI uses
    a noncanonical activation mechanism requiring PI(4,5)P2 binding to the C2 domain.
    Activated RhoA signals to downstream effectors (red arrows) to drive actomyosin
    contractility and membrane blebbing. The relevant ligands and receptors that activate
    guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) specific for each pathway, although
    somewhat speculative, are shown for physiological context. B, proposed switch-like
    mechanism to regulate the balance of Rac1 and RhoA signaling. Left, high DGKζ
    activity favors Rac1 activation and leads to inhibition of Rho signaling by Rac1.
    Right, PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of the MARCKS domain decreases DGKζ catalytic
    activity, which decreases Rac1 activation (dashed arrow), leading to decreased
    inhibition and a relative increase in RhoA signaling. C, schematic diagram of
    DGKζ showing the N-terminal domain (blue), C1 domains (green), MARCKS domain (dark
    blue), catalytic domain (red), ankyrin repeats (purple), and the C-terminal PDZ-binding
    motif. The binding sites for Rac1, RhoA, PKCα, and syntrophin (Syn) are indicated.
    PKCα binds to a region in the catalytic domain and phosphorylates DGKζ at Ser-265
    in the MARCKS domain. Both Rac1 and RhoA bind to the C1A domain and their binding
    is differentially regulated by MARCKS phosphorylation.
