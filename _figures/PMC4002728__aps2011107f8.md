caption: A flow chart depicting how 14-3-3σ induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M, which
  may not rely on p21waf1/cip1 and p53-dependent pathway in CRC cell models following
  satraplatin treatment. (A) Upon DNA damage caused by satraplatin treatment, we assumed
  that the ATM and ATR genes are activated, which induces the downstream signaling
  of cell cycle and cell death modulators. This results in p53 accumulation, which
  induces the expression of its primary cell cycle modulator, p21waf1/cip1, an inhibitor
  of Cdks, and its activation sequesters cyclin B1/cdc2 complexes, which can lead
  to an accumulation of cells at the G2/M transition. Alternatively, p53 could also
  be activated through 14-3-3σ (a conserved phosphoserine binding protein) to induce
  an accumulation of cells at G2/M by sequestering the cyclin B1/cdc2 complexes. (B)
  In cells that lack p53 or contain mutant p53, we observed that there was also a
  G2/M perturbation that was independent of p21waf1/cip1 activation because we first
  identified impaired S phase entry and then identified arrest at G2/M. (C) These
  cells might also activate 14-3-3σ independently of p53 action because p53mut and
  p53null cells demonstrated an elevated expression of 14-3-3σ and subsequently arrested
  at G2/M. (D) Loss of clonogenicity patterns were observed following satraplatin
  induced DNA damage, which led to cell mortality.
