caption: Schematic representation of BBR in cardiac myocytes. BBR upregulated expression
  of NICD and Hes1 by activating Notch1, which is distributed on the cell membrane.
  PTEN/Akt, the downstream signaling pathway, also participates in this process. Activation
  of the SIRT1/FOXO signaling pathway might also play a key role in the antiapoptotic
  action of BBR. BBR activates AMPK and other pathways that inhibited the Akt pathway,
  further acting on the mTOR factor. In addition, activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  participates in the action of BBR on ER stress. BBR also promotes mitophagy via
  the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway. SIRT1, silent information regulator 1; FOXO, forkhead
  box O; ER, endoplasmic reticulum stress, JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog;
  AKT, protein kinase B; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; mTOR, mammalian/mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATP/AMP, adenosine triphosphate/adenosine
  monophosphate; Hes1, hairy and enhancer of split 1; NICD, Notch intracellular domain;
  HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; NIX, BNIP3L.
