caption: The TGFβ/Smad canonical signaling pathway. TGFβ belongs to a superfamily
  of growth factors that also includes the activins and BMPs. The active TGFβ ligand
  is a dimeric molecule composed of two monomers linked by a disulfide bridge and
  hydrophobic interactions. Each TGFβ subunit is synthesized as a large inactive precursor
  molecule bound to accessory proteins (LAP and LTBP). This precursor is stored in
  the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be rapidly cleaved and activated by several
  proteolytic mechanisms to become bioavailable. Signal transduction starts with ligand
  binding to a complex of specific serine/threonine kinase receptors (type I, type
  II). The type II receptor is constitutively autophosphorylated and, upon ligand
  binding, transphosphorylates the juxtamembrane region of the type I receptor. This
  is followed by phosphorylation and recruitment of the R-Smads to the type I receptor
  and phospho-R-Smad complex formation with common partner Smad4 in the cytoplasm.
  The Smad complex is then translocated to the nucleus where it interacts with various
  transcription factors, coactivators, or corepressors to regulate target gene expression.
  The table lists the different ligands from the superfamily and their interactions
  with specific receptors and R-Smad proteins.
