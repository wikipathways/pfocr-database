caption: N-acetylaspartate (NAA), also one of the most abundant molecules in the mammalian
  brain, is a metabolite specific to the nervous system which is synthesized in neuronal
  mitochondria from aspartate (Asp) and acetylcoenzyme A (CoA) (4.1)[]. This synthesis
  is mediated by the presence of Asp N-acetyltransferase (ASP-NAT) and differs from
  that in other tissues in that brain mitochondria synthesize relatively higher NAA
  amounts[]. In the brain, NAA is critically involved in lipid and myelin synthesis,
  in energy production and in the synthesis of N-Acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), which
  is the third-most-prevalent neurotransmitter in the CNS. The regulatory pathway
  of NAA involves biosynthesis with the participation of ASP-NAT followed by neuronal
  release, uptake by oligodendrocytes and subsequent degradation by aspartocylase
  (ASPA) (4.3–4.4)[]. NAA is transported across the neuronal membrane by Na+-dependent
  high-affinity dicarboxylate transporters (NaDC3) which maintain the osmotic balance
  of NAA within the neuron (4.2)[]. During the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, NAA is broken
  down into acetate via ASPA, which is further converted into acetyl-CoA and aspartate
  using the cytosolic/nuclear enzyme acetyl-CoA synthatase 1 (4.6)[]. Histone acetyltransferases
  (HATs) transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the N-terminal of histones and
  thereby turn gene expression on or off (4.7–4.9)[]. Acetyl-CoA also serves as a
  precursor to acetylcholine (Ach) because the former combines with choline (Cho)
  to form Ach (4.10). Metabolic changes due to TBI lead to alterations in biomolecule
  concentrations which are indicative of hypoxia and/or mitochondrial dysfunction.
  One such biomolecule is lactate (Lac); under normal conditions, energy production
  relies on glucose (Glc) as the primary energy source due to the ease of its transportation
  across the BBB. Lac is produced as a byproduct of Glc metabolism via the Embden-Meyerhof
  (EM) pathway, which involves conversion of Glc to pyruvate (Pyr) and then to Lac
  by Lac dehydrogenase (4.11–4.12)[],[]. Lac is also metabolized along the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), but the brain’s dependence upon this pathway is more limited
  than in the case of the EM pathway. The initial steps of the PPP pathway lead to
  the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), involved in
  reductive biosynthesis of lipids and steroids (4.13). NADPH contributes to the production
  of reduced forms of glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) - cofactors of glutathione
  peroxide enzymes (GPx) and of peroxiredoxins (Prx), respectively (4.14–4.15). A
  protective effect induced by Trx involves the conversion of deoxyribonucleotide
  from ribonucleotide (4.16), which contributes to DNA synthesis and balances apoptotic
  factors. MRS is ideally suited for detecting changes in the levels of both neurometabolites
  (NAA, Cho, Cr, Lac) and neurotransmitters (Glu, GABA). Furthermore, the concentration
  gradient following TBI may be insufficient to allow Lac movement across the BBB.
  So Lac uptake is assisted by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (4.17). Along with
  a high Lac concentration, an increase in the Lac/Pyr ratio (LPR) may be present
  in extracellular fluid and associated with hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction
  (4.18–4.20). TBI also raises brain tissue acidosis (4.21), causing binding of Op18/stathmin
  (STMN1; 4.22) to tubulin and slowing microtubule growth (4.23).
