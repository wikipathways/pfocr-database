caption: Activation and regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. The STAT3 signaling
  pathway is turned on by the activation of cell surface receptor (growth factor or
  cytokine receptors) leading to recruitment and activation of JAK-family of proteins,
  which in turn recruits and phosphorylates STAT3. STAT3 can also be directly phosphorylated
  by non-tyrosine kinase receptors (Src or c-abl). Phosphorylated STAT3 homodimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression. The signaling
  pathway can be switched off by the actions of a phosphatase which dephosphorylates
  STAT3 and prevents dimer formation. Also, PIAS and SOCS family of protein can directly
  compete with STAT3 for either binding opportunities with the activating receptor
  or for dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. STAT3, signal transducers
  and activators of transcription 3; JAK, Janus kinase; SOCS, suppressors of cytokine
  signaling; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated
  STATs.
