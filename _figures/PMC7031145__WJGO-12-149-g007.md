caption: 'Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, phosphatase and tensin homolog, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase and RAS pathways modulated by caffeine. Three signaling pathways
  can be initiated by epidermal growth factor receptor: p38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/ mTOR pathways. p38 MAPK can be phosphorylated
  following the activation of MAPK kinase kinases and MAPK kinases. Caffeine can inhibit
  the activation of p38 MAPK though modulating the Ca2+ concentration and reactive
  oxygen species generation. Additionally, caffeine can exert a dual function on ERK,
  the downstream factor of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway. At a high concentration, caffeine
  activates the ERK pathway. At a moderate concentration, caffeine shows an inhibitory
  effect on the ERK pathway. PI3K can convert phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP)
  2 to PIP3, and PTEN can reverse this conversion. Caffeine can activate PTEN and
  inhibit PI3K, in which case PIP3 can be reduced and PIP2 can be increased. Then,
  PIP3 can activate AKT, through which p53 and Bcl-2 can be activated, and the mTOR
  pathway can be inhibited. Caffeine can inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT by suppressing
  its residues Thr308 and Ser473. Moreover, caffeine can directly inhibit mTOR pathways.
