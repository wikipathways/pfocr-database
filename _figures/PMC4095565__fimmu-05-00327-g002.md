caption: Model of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling cascades. NOD1 and NOD2 recognize bacterial
  PGNs, iE-DAP, and MDP, respectively. Following ligand sensing the NODs recruit their
  common adaptor RIP2 by CARD–CARD interactions and induce RIP2 to undergo phosphorylation.
  The members of the TRAF family (TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6), the IAP family (XIAP,
  cIAP1, and cIAP2), and the BCL2 family (BID) bind to RIP2 and facilitate its ubiquitination
  allowing the recruitment of TAK1 and ubiquitinated NEMO to the Nodosome. On one
  hand, NEMO instigates activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating
  IKKα and IKKβ, by inducing IκBα phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, and
  by freeing p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits. On the other hand, TAK1 recruits TAB1 and
  TAB2/3 inducing both (p38, ERK, and JNK) MAPK and NF-κB activation. Stimulation
  of both arms culminates in the induction of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), cytokines,
  and chemokines. The formation of the Nodosome promotes autophagy and conversely,
  a fully functional autophagy machinery helps in signal transduction through the
  Nodosome. ATG16L1 along with ATG5 and ATG12 is required for autophagosome formation,
  however, independently of its autophagy functions, ATG16L1 negatively regulates
  NOD/RIP2 signaling.
