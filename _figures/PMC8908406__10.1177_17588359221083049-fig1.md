caption: Pivotal signaling pathways, including CLDN18.2, TGF-β, FGFR2, and MET, in
  DGC.MET and FGFR2 are members of the RTK family. Binding the ligands, such as hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growing factors (FGFs), to the RTK receptor leads
  to cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the activation of MAPK and
  PI3 K-AKT signaling via the recruitment of various effector molecules, such as growth
  factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2), GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) son of
  sevenless (SOS), and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ). FGFR2 activates not only MAPK and
  PI3 K-AKT signaling via FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) as an adaptor protein, but also
  FRS2-independent cascades, including protein kinase C (PKC)-glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β)-β-catenin axis, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (STAT) axis, and c-Jun-Yes-associated protein1 (YAP1) axis. Activated
  ras homolog family member A (RhoA) interacts with downstream effectors, including
  Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), and focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK). CLDN18.2 may interact with the RhoA signaling pathway. YAP1 is activated
  by RhoA signaling, in addition to the Hippo and FGFR2 signaling pathways. The canonical
  TGF-β signaling pathway involves ligand-dependent assembly of a heteromeric receptor
  complex and subsequent accumulation of Smad proteins as transcriptional regulators
  in the nucleus. The mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is frequently
  dysregulated in DGC via overexpression of phosphorylated mTOR and PI3 K-AKT signaling
  activated by PTEN loss and RTKs, such as MET and FGFR2. ADCs, antibody–drug conjugates;
  BiTE, bispecific T cell engager; CAR-T, chimeric antigen receptor T; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HSPG, heparan
  sulfate proteoglycan; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate;
  TKIs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
