caption: Schematic diagram showing the critical role of FDPS in normal prostate and
  prostate cancer and its associated potential mecahnism (s). (i) FDPS is a crucial
  intermediate enzyme required for cholesterol and sterol biosynthesis. This enzyme
  catalyzes production of geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate from isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate and dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate. Apart from enzyme catalysis, FDPS
  is involved in posttranslational modifications (protein prenylation) of GTPases.
  Inactivation of FDPS through interferon disrupts specialized cell membrane-associated
  microdomains, such as lipid rafts, required for protein and receptor trafficking,
  cell signaling, and neurotransmission regulation. (ii) FDPS is overexpressed in
  prostate cancer and associated with tumor recurrence. FDPS also regulates intra-tumoral
  androgens, which further interferes with ADT therapy in the localized and locally
  advanced stages of prostate cancer. (iii) Flow diagram describes various mechanisms
  associated with FDPS overexpression in prostate cancer cells. FDPS may be stimulated
  by androgens and ectopic overexpression of FDPS resulted in activation of AKT and
  ERK signaling for sustained proliferative signals, but deactivates STAT1 pathway,
  disrupting its tumor suppressive function. ZOL potentially inhibits FDPS thereby
  modulating the prenylation of small GTPases resulting in deactivation of AKT, ERK
  and STAT signaling in prostate cancer cells.
