caption: 'Schematic diagrams of the role of STAT1 in antimycobacterial, antiviral
  and antifungal immunity. In the three panels, proteins for which mutations in the
  corresponding genes have been identified and associated with MSMD, HSE and CMC,
  respectively, are shown in blue. STAT1 is shown in red. Top panel: The phagocytosis
  of mycobacteria leads to cytokine production and cooperation between phagocytes/dendritic
  cells and NK/T cells. The IL-12/23/IFN-γ loop, the CD40/CD40L pathway and the oxidative
  burst (mediated by CYBB, a component of NADPH oxidase) are crucial for protective
  immunity to mycobacteria in humans. STAT1 deficiency is associated with an impaired
  IFN-γ response. Middle panel: The recognition of dsRNA by TLR3 induces activation
  of the IRF-3 and NF-kB pathways via TRIF, leading to IFN-α/-β and/or IFN-λ production.
  TLR3, UNC-93B, TRIF, TRAF3, TBK1 and NEMO deficiencies are associated with impaired
  IFN-α/-β and/or IFN-λ production, particularly during herpes virus infection. The
  binding of IFN-α/-β or IFN-λ to its receptor induces the phosphorylation of JAK1
  and TYK2, activating the signal transduction proteins STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. This
  complex is translocated as a heterotrimer to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional
  activator, binding to specific DNA response elements in the promoter region of IFN-inducible
  genes. STAT1 deficiency is associated with impaired IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ responses.
  Bottom panel: Following the recognition of C. albicans, the CARD9 adaptor molecule
  mediates the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production by myeloid and epithelial
  cells. These pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-23, activate T lymphocytes
  via STAT3, inducing the differentiation of these cells into IL-17-producing T cells;
  these cells constitute a major component of immune defenses against C. albicans.
  Gain-of-function mutations in STAT1 inhibit this differentiation in response to
  IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ and IL-27 or the impairment of normal IL-6, IL-21 and/or IL-23
  signaling, through an as yet undetermined mechanism.'
