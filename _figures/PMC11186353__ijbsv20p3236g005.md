caption: Illustration representing the sites of action of different polyphenols in
  cancer pathway. Activation of oncogene triggers abnormal cell division and finally
  results in tumor cells followed by metastasis. DNA crosslinking, DNA damage, abnormal
  p53 activities, and microtubule disruption collectively result in abnormal apoptosis
  and cell cycle arrest which cause cancer. Different polyphenols probably work on
  these pathways to prevent cancer. The figure was designed by Biorender.com program
