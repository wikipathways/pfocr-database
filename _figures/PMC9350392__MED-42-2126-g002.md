caption: Simplified representation of the mechanism of action of SARS‐CoV‐2. Initially,
  the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) approaches the
  cell membrane (1) and it binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2; colored
  in red) (pink arrow, step A) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral
  spike (S) protein. The S protein suffers a conformational change and it is cleaved
  by the transmembrane serine protease‐2 (TMPRSS2; colored in blue) (pink arrow, step
  B), when this protease is expressed in the cell. The S protein has two cleavage
  sites, represented by the dotted lines, S1/S2, which is between the S1 and S2 domains;
  and S2′, which is within S2 domain; also, the RBD is housed in the S1 domain (pink
  arrow, step C). After binding ACE2 and being cleaved by TMPRSS2, the virus fuses
  with the cell membrane (2A) and and the viral RNA is released in the cytosol (2B).
  Alternatively, the virus can enter the cell through endocytosis (3A). In the endosome,
  the viral particle is cleaved by cathepsins B and L (CatB/L) (3B). The viral particle
  fuses with the endosome membrane (3C) and the viral RNA is released in the cytosol
  (3D). After the release of the viral RNA, either by previous binding of the viral
  particle to ACE2 or by previous endosome encompassing, the virus undergoes the replication
  step (4), in which it subverts the cell machinery (not shown). After this step and
  the synthesis of the viral polyproteins (pp) pp1a and pp1ab, the viral proteases
  main protease (Mpro) and papain‐like protease (PLpro) play important roles in releasing
  themselves by autoproteolytic activity and in processing the central and the C‐proximal
  region of pp1a/pp1ab (Mpro) and the N‐proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab (PLpro) (not
  shown). After replication, a new viral particle is generated and it is released
  from the cell (5). The presence of the viral RNA detected in other cells elicits
  the release of cytokines, such as interleukin‐6 (IL‐6, not discussed in this paper),
  in the body. IL‐6 binds to its cell membrane receptor, it activates the JAK/STAT
  pathway (6A) and it promotes the cytokine storm (7) in the targeted cells. In parallel,
  the release of viral RNA in the cytosol (steps 1, 2A, and 2B, or steps 3A, 3B, and
  3C) can also directly activate the JAK/STAT pathway in the same cell (6B and 6C),
  and then it promotes the cytokine storm (7). ACE2, catB/L and TMPRSS2 are ubiquitously
  expressed in the body. TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease‐2 [Color figure can
