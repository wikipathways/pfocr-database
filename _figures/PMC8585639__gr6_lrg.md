caption: Proposed cell death signaling mechanisms following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. The 3a protein can trigger apoptosis
  through the extrinsic pathway and death receptors. Pyroptosis can occur following
  response to S protein or to excessive Ang II activation by the AT1R in the hematopoietic
  stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The 3a protein may also trigger the pyroptosis signaling,
  similar to the SARS-CoV 3a protein. The RIPK3-mediated necroptosis can be another
  cell death signaling that the activation of RIPK3 by 3a can induce necroptosis,
  in an MLKL-independent manner. Created with BioRender.
