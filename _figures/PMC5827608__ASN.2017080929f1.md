caption: 'Uremic thrombosis axis (uremic solutes-AHR-TF) in humans. Working hypothesis
  of the uremic thrombosis axis: Tryptophan degraded to indole by intestinal bacteria
  undergoes conversion to indolic solutes such as IS in the liver. Tryptophan absorbed
  through the portal circulation also undergoes metabolism in the liver to Kyn. IS
  and Kyn are retained in patients with CKD and their elevated levels activate the
  AHR pathway to increase TF levels in the vessel wall to enhance thrombosis. The
  uremic solutes–AHR–TF axis is a novel and CKD-specific thrombotic signaling pathway.'
