caption: 'Potential mechanisms of aging-associated salt-sensitive hypertension and
  crosstalk between Wnt noncanonical pathway and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vasoconstrictive
  pathway. In aged mice with reduced serum klotho levels, high salt intake stimulates
  adipocytes and macrophages to produce cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-17, which in
  turn stimulate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to secrete Wnt3a and Wnt5a.
  Inflammatory cytokines also upregulate Wnt5a expression in macrophages and adipocytes
  via paracrine and autocrine signaling. Secreted Wnt5a activates the noncanonical
  Wnt-RhoA (PCP) pathway by binding to its receptor Frizzled (FZD) and the Wnt coreceptor
  tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR2 in VSMCs. Activated RhoA/Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK) increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of VSMCs, leading to vasoconstriction.
  On the other hand, Ang II-induced RhoA/ROCK activation needs Wnt5a, and there is
  the crosstalk between Wnt noncanonical pathway induced- and Ang II-induced vasoconstriction
  in the process of RhoA activation. Consequently, total peripheral resistance (TPR)
  increases, and renal blood flow (RBF) decreases in the development of salt-sensitive
  hypertension. Aging-related salt-sensitive hypertension is thought to be related
  to increased vascular sensitivity to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) as well as Ang II. The
  canonical Wnt3a-β-catenin pathway is already enhanced with a normal salt diet, which
  might be a general feature of aging, regardless of klotho deficiency. Increased
  levels of complement C1q also activate the Wnt-β catenin pathway via cleavage of
  the Wnt coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6. High salt intake further increases Wnt3a-β-catenin
  signaling in the setting of klotho deficiency, leading to cardiac and vascular damage
  and arterial stiffness. Dvl, Dishevelled; LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
