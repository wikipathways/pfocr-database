caption: A suggested relationship between the defatting cocktail and intracellular
  lipolytic metabolic pathways. Forskolin activates the glucagon membrane receptors,
  which in turn stimulate the cAMP–protein kinase A pathway; thus, the cytoplasmic
  lipases are attracted to the surface of LDs. Glycerol and FFAs will then be released,
  serving not only as substrates for the cell metabolism but also as ligands to nuclear
  receptors (PPAR and liver X receptor), increasing the transcription of enzymes involved
  in the catabolism of FFAs in the mitochondria and peroxisome. Diverse cocktail drugs
  (GW7647, GW501516, hypericin, scorparone) also act as ligands to other nuclear receptors
  (PXRs and CARs), boosting the transcription of key enzymes. Cytosolic FA reacts
  with ATP, producing fatty acyl‐CoA. Acyl‐CoA in turn reacts with apolipoprotein
  B to generate lipoproteins to be exported from the cell and/or reacts with the hydroxyl
  group of carnitine via carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Acyl‐carnitine is transported
  inside the mitochondria by a carnitine‐acyl‐CoA transferase, and a carnitine is
  transferred outside. Acyl‐CoA is processed by β‐oxidation. The acetyl‐CoA produced
  then will follow to ketogenesis or for complete oxidation via the Krebs cycle and
  the electron transport chain with the production of ATP. Increased production of
  aspartate and CO2 stimulate the urea cycle, increasing the production of urea. Alternatively,
  long chain and very long chain FFAs are also oxidized in the peroxisomes. Glycerol
  is a gluconeogenic precursor; it is converted to pyruvate, producing glucose‐6‐phosphate
  through the gluconeogenesis pathway. Glucose‐6‐phosphate will be released as glucose
  in the perfusate and stimulate the enzyme glycogen synthase, increasing the production
  of glycogen. The squares contain the specific enzymes that have an up‐regulation
  in the transcription as a consequence of this stimulus. Drugs and supplement used
  in the cocktail are presented in yellow squares.
