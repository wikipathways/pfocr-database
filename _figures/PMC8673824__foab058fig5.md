caption: Rewiring signals in the pheromone and starvation response pathways. Both
  S. cerevisiae and K. lactis respond to pheromone by activating a highly conserved
  MAPK cascade that culminates in activation of the transcription factor Ste12. Similarly,
  both species respond to starvation by triggering the Ras-cAMP pathway and inhibiting
  protein kinase A (PKA) activity. There is a fundamental difference, however, at
  the Rme1 (syn. Mts1 in Kluyveromyces) node. In S. cerevisiae, Rme1 is a direct target
  of PKA and the consequence of carbon starvation is a reduction in active Rme1. There
  is a complex control system but reducing Rme1 activity ultimately leads to transcription
  of IME1, thereby triggering meiosis. There is no direct connection between pheromone
  signalling, which is important during haploid growth, and meiosis, which only occurs
  in diploid cells. In K. lactis, Msn2 (the single orthologue of Msn2 and Msn4) has
  acquired transcriptional control of RME1. Inhibition of PKA (i.e. starvation) increases
  activity of Msn2, leads to more transcription of RME1 and more Rme1. Rme1 is a transcriptional
  activator of the MATα3 and KAT1, two transposon-derived genes encoding endonucleases
  important for mating-type switching. Rme1 also inhibits meiosis and has taken over
  the function of a1-α2 in inhibiting hsg (not shown). Rme1 also activates expression
  of STE12, thereby linking starvation and pheromone responses. Red lines in the figure
  depict responses at the level of protein activity, whereas black lines indicate
  transcriptional regulation. For clarity, some components of the signalling pathways
  are omitted, and further details may be found in the references cited in the main
  text.

  description: Rewiring signals in the pheromone and starvation response pathways.
    Both S. cerevisiae and K. lactis respond to pheromone by activating a highly conserved
    MAPK cascade that culminates in activation of the transcription factor Ste12.
    Similarly, both species respond to starvation by triggering the Ras-cAMP pathway
    and inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) activity. There is a fundamental difference,
    however, at the Rme1 (syn. Mts1 in Kluyveromyces) node. In S. cerevisiae, Rme1
    is a direct target of PKA and the consequence of carbon starvation is a reduction
    in active Rme1. There is a complex control system but reducing Rme1 activity ultimately
    leads to transcription of IME1, thereby triggering meiosis. There is no direct
    connection between pheromone signalling, which is important during haploid growth,
    and meiosis, which only occurs in diploid cells. In K. lactis, Msn2 (the single
    orthologue of Msn2 and Msn4) has acquired transcriptional control of RME1. Inhibition
    of PKA (i.e. starvation) increases activity of Msn2, leads to more transcription
    of RME1 and more Rme1. Rme1 is a transcriptional activator of the MATα3 and KAT1,
    two transposon-derived genes encoding endonucleases important for mating-type
    switching. Rme1 also inhibits meiosis and has taken over the function of a1-α2
    in inhibiting hsg (not shown). Rme1 also activates expression of STE12, thereby
    linking starvation and pheromone responses. Red lines in the figure depict responses
    at the level of protein activity, whereas black lines indicate transcriptional
    regulation. For clarity, some components of the signalling pathways are omitted,
    and further details may be found in the references cited in the main text.
