caption: Analysis of genes modulated following RPL19 knockdown identified five interlinked
  pathways principally affected (Supporting Information ). Four of these include genes
  encoding MMP enzymes (A); the ICAM1-integrin complex (B); the NFκB complex (C) and
  PI3K regulation (D). This analysis confirmed several genes modulated by down-regulated
  expression of RPL19 to be interconnected, emphasizing the numerous pathways for
  cross-talk between apparently distinct biological processes.
