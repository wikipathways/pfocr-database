caption: Proposed model for the regulation of phenazine biosynthesis by the TCST system
  in GP72. Solid straight arrows point to genes that are positively regulated. Blunt
  lines point to genes that are negatively affected. A dashed arrow indicates an unknown
  or as-yet uncharacterized regulatory pathway. In GP72, the sensors GacS and RpeB
  are activated by a putative environmental factor. Lon protease negatively affects
  GacA by controlling its protein stability. GacA positively controls the expression
  of rsmX, rsmY, and rsmZ, which in turn activates phenazine production by titrating
  the translation suppressor RsmE. In the absence of RpeA, RpeB is possibly over-phosphorylated
  by small phospho-donors (PD), resulting in the increased expression of the pip,
  phzR/phzI and the phenazine biosynthetic genes
