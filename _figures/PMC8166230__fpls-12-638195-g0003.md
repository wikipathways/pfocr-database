caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of steroidal glycoalkaloids. Levels of detectable metabolites
  are expressed as fold/ISTD (Internal Standard: formononetin) in parental lines male
  P1 “(67/3)”, female P2 (“305E40”), and the F1 progeny. Metabolites marked in red
  have been identified by the untargeted analysis, in blue by the targeted one.'
