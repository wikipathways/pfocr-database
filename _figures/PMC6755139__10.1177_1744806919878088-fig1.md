caption: 'An overview of the two analytic approaches used to evaluate for cytoskeleton-
  and axon morphology-related gene (G) expression patterns associated with paclitaxel-induced
  peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer survivors (S) with (C) and without (N) PIPN:
  [1] PIA and [2] WGCNA. The KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology categories were evaluated
  for cytoskeleton and axon-morphology biological processes. DGE: differential gene
  expression; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; MLR: multiple logistic
  regression; PIA: pathway impact analysis; PPI: protein–protein interaction; WGCNA:
  weighted gene co-expression network analysis.'
