caption: Model of FTO regulation of leptin action and glucose homeostasis through
  the LepRb-STAT3 signaling pathway. A) The binding of leptin to its receptor triggers
  the activation of JAK2 and the phosphorylation of STAT3 on a tyrosine residue (Y705).
  This modification causes the STAT3 protein to relocate to the nucleus, where as
  a dimer, it regulates gene expression (upregulation of both SOCS3 and LepR and reduction
  of G6P). Our data further suggest that FTO could be a STAT3-upregulated gene in
  hepatocytes. B) FTO overexpression reduces Y705 STAT3 phosphorylation, reducing
  its nuclear translocation and leading to a downregulation of both SOCS3 and LepRb
  and an upregulation of G6P mRNA levels. Just to opposite, FTO overexpression induces
  S727 phosphorylation of STAT3, favorizing its mitochondrial localization, where
  it induces mitochondrial density and function. All these effects are associated
  in vivo with hyperleptinemia, hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia and glucose intolerance.
  Altogether, these data indicate that FTO controls leptin action and glucose metabolism
  in liver.
