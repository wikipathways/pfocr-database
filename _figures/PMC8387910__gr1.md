caption: Mechanism of adiponectin actions in prevention of insulin resistance and
  diabetes. Adiponectin actions are mediated by its interaction with adiponectin receptors
  1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). AdipoR1 is tightly associated with the activation
  of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, while AdipoR2 appears to be linked
  to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) pathway.
  AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and liver respectively.
  However, both receptors express in other major organs as well. Adiponectin exerts
  its metabolic effects on the skeletal muscle mainly by activating the AdipoR1-AMPK
  signalling pathway. It boosts insulin sensitivity by stimulating glucose uptake
  and fatty acid oxidation, and also stimulates the expression of target genes leading
  to an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis while markedly reduces oxidative stress.
  In the pancreas, it stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion through activation
  of fatty-acid oxidation and prevention of beta cell apoptosis. In case of liver,
  adiponectin induces fatty acid oxidation while reduces glucose production, fat formation
  and fatty acid uptake through activation of AdipoR2-PPARα signalling pathway; thereby
  exerting an insulin sensitizing effect on this organ. In adipose tissue, it exerts
  insulin sensitizing property by its anti-inflammatory action combined to a rise
  in glucose uptake and also speeds up the adipogenesis process.
