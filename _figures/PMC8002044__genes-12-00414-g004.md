caption: The potential network of signaling pathways contributing to the chicken lipid
  metabolism. The above-mentioned pathways (gray boxes) might be the crucial pathways
  for lipid deposition in chicken breast muscle. Activation of PPARγ in the PPAR signaling
  pathway leads to upregulation of lipogenic genes, including ADIPOQ, LPL, SCD, or
  CD36, to promote TG synthesis. Moreover, PPARγ may promote the interaction of PLIN1with
  CIDEC to accelerate LD formation. Meanwhile, upregulation of cholesterol synthesis
  genes, such as DHCR24 and NSDHL, in the steroid biosynthesis pathway may upgrade
  the steroid ester synthesis. Ses, Sterol esters; TGs, Triglycerides; LD, lipid droplet;
  PLIN, Perilipins; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; ADIPOQ, adiponectin;
  LPL, lipoprotein lipase; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; CD36, cluster of differentiation
  36; DHCR24, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase; NSDHL, NAD (P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like;
  LSS, Lanosterol synthase; MSMO1, Methylsterol monooxygenase 1; CH25H, Cholesterol
  25-hydroxylase. Black, red, and green arrows indicate possible regulatory relationship,
  bidirectional regulatory relationship, and reported regulatory relationship, respectively.  was
