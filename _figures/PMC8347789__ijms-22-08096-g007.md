caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the effects of roscovitine. Optic nerve crush
  increases calcium influx and activates the calpain signaling pathway, which then
  activates Cdk5 through a mechanism involving P35/P25. Activation of Cdk5 causes
  abnormal phosphorylation of tau, leading to the death of the RGCs. Roscovitine reduces
  the degree of activation of Cdk5 and decreases the abnormal phosphorylation. Cdk5
  is also associated with excitotoxicity, and roscovitine may decrease calcium influx
  through a mechanism involving excitotoxicity. In addition, roscovitine may block
  some calcium channels and thereby suppress the calpain signaling pathway.
