caption: Retrograde signaling of ECS in a Glutamatergic synapse. Anandamide (AEA)
  and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are synthesized on demand in the postsynaptic
  neuron following an increment of Ca2+ concentration. AEA is synthesized starting
  from the membrane lipid N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) by N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing
  phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) activity, while diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) converts
  the diacylglycerol (DAG) in 2-AG. AEA and 2-AG move across the cell membrane through
  a purported endocannabinoid membrane transporter (EMT). Cannabinoid receptor type
  1/2 (CB1/2) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), are the main receptor
  targets of AEA and 2-AG on the presynaptic neuron. Activation of CB1/2 receptors
  triggers the Ca2+-mediated release of glutamate, in the presynaptic neuron, with
  subsequent activation of NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic neuron. Moreover, the
  transduction pathway of CB1/2-mediated determines the K+ efflux which opposes the
  depolarization in the presynaptic neuron. AEA is hydrolyzed by FAAH enzyme while
  in the 2-AG catabolism are involved MAGL, ADBH6, and ADBH12 enzymes. The outcome
  of this process is the inhibition of glutamatergic activity. Moreover, eCB signaling
  can also proceed by a non-retrograde mechanism, in which AEA and 2-AG active CB1
  receptors or TRPV1 channel on the postsynaptic neurons.
