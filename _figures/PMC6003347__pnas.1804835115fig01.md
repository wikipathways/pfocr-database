caption: The biosynthetic pathway for SGAs in tomato, cultivated eggplant, and other
  Solanum species. (A) In the tomato plant, the conversion of dehydrotomatidine to
  tomatidine was previously predicted to be a single-step reaction driven by a hypothetical
  hydrogenase enzyme (, ). SI Appendix, Fig. S3, provides a more detailed SGA pathway
  schematic. (B) In cultivated eggplant, solasodine, an unsaturated aglycone is glycosylated
  by STEROL ALKALOID GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASEs (SGTs) to produce unsaturated α-solasonine
  and α-solamargine SGAs (Left). Cultivated eggplant varieties likely lack a GAME25-like
  enzyme and therefore do not produce saturated SGAs. Some wild Solanum species (e.g.,
  S. dulcamara) produce a saturated soladulcidine aglycone from solasodine and further
  glycosylate soladulcidine aglycone to soladulcine A and β-soladulcine (saturated
  SGAs) (Right). This suggests the presence of GAME25 homologs in S. dulcamara (wild
  Solanum relative) and other Solanum species producing saturated SGAs starting from
  solasodine.
