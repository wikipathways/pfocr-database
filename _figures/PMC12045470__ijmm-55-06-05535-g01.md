caption: Protective mechanism of dexmedetomidine against multiorgan dysfunction. LPS
  regulate tissue cell inflammation by modulating the MAPK, TLR4, or HMGB1/NF-κB signaling
  pathways; regulate tissue cell oxidative stress by modulating Nrf2/HO-1, P13K/Akt
  and NOX4 signaling pathways; and regulate cellular autophagy by modulating the P13K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathways. In addition, lipolysis can lead to endothelial damage, abnormal
  coagulation function and immune imbalance. Lipopolysaccharides induce multiple organ
  dysfunction through these mechanisms; however, dexmedetomidine alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced
  multiple organ dysfunction by regulating these pathways. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
