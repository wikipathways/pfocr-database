caption: aPathway A shows the formation of possible proximal epoxides (1) by cyt P450
  followed by direct nucleophilic attack to form guanine         adducts at the N2
  position (2) or hydrolysis by epoxide hydrolase to form a diol product, and a second
  cyt P450-mediated epoxidation         forming diol epoxides (3), and the final nucleophilic
  attack forming a guanine adduct at the N2 position (4). Pathway B shows the         one-electron
  oxidation by cyt P450 to form the reactive cation radical (5) with subsequent nucleophilic
  attack on guanine (6) or adenine         (7) forming adducts at the N7 position
  on the nucleobases.
