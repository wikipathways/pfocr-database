caption: The role of the PARPs in protection from genetic instability. (A) Milliseconds
  after a DSB, PARP-1 secures an open pathway choice via protection of the HR pathway
  from interference by the Ku70/80 complex and by recruiting but temporarily antagonizing
  MRE11-containing exonuclease complexes [,,,,]. Chromatin remodelers recruited to
  PAR marks open the chromatin for the repair factors. Consecutively, PARP-1 facilitates
  the recruitment of the 53BP-RIF1 complex and NONO, suppressors of DNA resection,
  which enhance NHEJ. At the same time, PARP-1 stimulates the interaction of BRCA1,
  a governing factor of HR, with the inhibitory RAP80 complex [,,]. PARP-3 enhances
  the retention of the XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex at the DSB site before the completion
  of NHEJ [,]. PARP-2 facilitates DNA resection, leading to a different pathway choice
  in favor of HR [,] TNKS1/2 facilitate the arrival of BRCA1 by recruiting and promoting
  chromatin remodeling through MDC1. TNKS1/2 also stabilize the BRCA1 complex through
  the recruitment of MERIT40 []. (B) PARylated PARP-1 or other proteins serve as a
  scaffold for XRCC1, DNA Polβ, FEN1, and PNKP during BER. PARP-1 directly stimulates
  strand replacement synthesis by Polβ and 5′-flap cleavage by FEN1 during LP-BER
  []. (C) PARP-1 directs DDB2 and XPC to the UV-induced lesions. Tripartite interactions
  between PARP1, XPA, and RPA answer for the spatio-temporal fine-tuning of the NER
  complex assembly. (D) TNKS1 is indispensable for the regulation of sister telomere
  resolution during the cell cycle. TNKS1 associates with the telomere and is K63-ubiquitylated
  in late S/G2 by RNF8, reinforcing telomere cohesion. (E) At stalled replication
  forks, PARP1 delays the activation of the DNA helicase RECQ1, postponing fork restart
  []. PARP-1, PARP-2, and BRCA2 cooperate to stabilize RAD51, facilitating fork reversal.
  Fork reversal is necessary for clearing the way for lesion repair [,]. PARP1 also
  recruits and, together with BRCA2, fine-tunes the exonuclease activity of MRE11,
  which is required for DNA resection at the reversed fork before it can be restarted
  [,]. (F) PARP-1, PARP-3, PARP-6, and TNKS1/2 associate with the centrosome and control
  its amplification, preventing the formation of supernumerary spindles. The cytokinesis
  regulating factor ETC2 is recruited to spindle microtubules PARylated by TNKS1 during
  metaphase []. PARP-1 and PARP-2 interact with CENP-A, CENP-B, and the mitotic checkpoint
  complex (MCC) at active centromeres to regulate the metaphase-anaphase transition
  [,].
