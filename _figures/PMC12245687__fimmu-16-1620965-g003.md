caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway mechanism of TLRs. After activation
  of different TLRs by pathogenic microorganisms in the intestine, with the help of
  MyD88-dependent as well as non-dependent pathways, the downstream NF-κB signaling
  pathway was activated, which promoted the expression of inflammatory factors and
  led to the impairment of intestinal permeability, which then contributed to the
  development of intestinal sepsis. Created with BioRender.com
