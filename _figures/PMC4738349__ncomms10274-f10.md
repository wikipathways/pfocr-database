caption: During crystallophathies, crystals are formed and deposited inside the organ,
  for example, kidney stone disease or joint, for example, gouty arthritis. Upon crystallization,
  crystals are phagocytized by parenchymal cells where they activate the RIPK1, RIPK3
  and MLKL pathway of necroptosis, a prototype form of regulated necrosis, by inducing
  a series of phosphorylation events. Cellular necroptosis lead to release of DAMPs,
  which activate immune cells surrounding the parenchymal cells. Activated immune
  cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α and
  so on. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α can also activate the RIPK1, RIPK3
  and MLKL pathway of necroptosis via TNFR1. The auto-amplification loop between cell
  death and inflammation, called necroinflammation, leads to aggravation of tissue
  injury, and if remain uncontrolled then to organ failure. In the current settings,
  the loop of crystal-induced necroinflammation can be blocked by using a soluble
  TNFR1-hIgG1 fusion protein etanercept to inhibit TNF-α, TNFR inhibitor R-7050, RIPK1
  inhibitor necrostatin-1 or MLKL inhibitor necrosulfonamide. RIPK, receptor-interacting
  protein kinase; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain like; DAMPs, danger associated
  molecular patterns; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumour-necrosis factor; TNFR, tumour-necrosis
  factor receptor.
