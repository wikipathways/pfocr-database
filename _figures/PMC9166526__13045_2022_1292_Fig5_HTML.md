caption: The role of HIFs in cancer invasiveness and metastasis. HIF1A regulates the
  sonic hedgehog signaling pathway to promote the invasive abilities of cancer cells.
  Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1A upregulates differentiated embryonic chondrocyte
  gene 2 (DEC2) at the transcriptional level, which in turn promotes HIF1A activation,
  ultimately contributing to cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and
  invasiveness. HIF2A directly induces transcription of the stem cell factor (SCF)
  gene via the hypoxia response element in the SCF promoter and upregulates SCF expression,
  thereby promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Zinc finger MYND-type containing
  8 (ZMYND8) is regarded as a direct target gene of HIF1A and HIF2A. The ZMYND8/HIF
  axis increases breast tumor angiogenesis and decreases cancer cell death to promote
  cancer metastasis. Protein kinase growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6)/AXL is activated
  by HIF1A and HIF2A. The SRC proto-oncogene nonreceptor tyrosine kinase is a direct
  target of GAS6/AXL signaling; it activates MET proto-oncogenes, thereby regulating
  the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis. Overexpression
  of HIF1A promotes production of CD24, which leads to tumor growth and metastasis,
  and HIFs regulate EMT to promote cancer metastasis. Hypoxia-induced HIFs promote
  EMT by enhancing snail, β-catenin, Wnt, and Notch signaling, thereby inducing cancer
  cell survival, metastasis, and immune escape. EMT promotes expression of PD-L1,
  facilitating tumor cells escape and recognition and attack by immune cells
