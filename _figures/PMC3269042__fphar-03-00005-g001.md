caption: Metabolism of retinoids (A) and isoprenoids (B). (A) all-trans-Retinol, 13-cis-retinol,
  and 9-cis-retinol are oxidized to the corresponding retinoic acids through retinals
  by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH). Retinoic acids
  regulate cell function including differentiation through binding to retinoic acid
  receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). AKR1B10 effectively reduces retinals
  into retinols, and is considered to promote cell proliferation by inhibiting the
  retinoic acid formation. (B) Farnesyl pyrophosphate, an isoprenoid intermediate
  of the mevalonate pathway, is converted by its dephosphorylation into farnesol,
  which is further oxidized into farnesal and farnesoic acid by ADH and ALDH. Geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate is similarly metabolized. The two isoprenyl pyrophosphates are used
  in the prenylation of small G-proteins such as Ras, leading to activation of MAP
  kinase cascade and resultant increase in proliferation potential of cells. AKR1B10
  efficiently reduces farnesal and geranylgeranial to farnesol and geranylgeraniol,
  respectively, which are phosphorylated into the isoprenyl pyrophosphates. Up-regulation
  of AKR1B10 in carcinomas and chemoresistant cancer cells may increase the cellular
  levels of the two isoprenyl alcohols by reducing back their aldehyde metabolites,
  and then promote proliferation of the cell.
