caption: Regulation of BA synthesis by FXR and FGF19 in humans. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) initiates the conversion of cholesterol to PBAs through the classical pathway
  in hepatocytes. BAs are transported from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculus through
  the bile salt export pump (BSEP). BAs then enter the small intestine via the common
  bile duct. In the terminal ileum, enterocytes absorb BAs through the apical sodium-dependent
  bile salt transporter (ASBT). Here, BAs can activate the nuclear BA receptor, farnesoid
  X receptor (FXR), which results in the upregulation of fibroblast growth factor
  19 (FGF19) and subsequent release of FGF19 into the portal circulation. BAs also
  enter the portal circulation via the organic solute transporter α/β (OST α/β) located
  in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. BAs from the portal circulation are
  reabsorbed back into the liver via the Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide
  (NTCP). FGF19 also binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). Both these
  actions result in the inhibition of CYP7A1, thus resulting in the downregulation
  of BA synthesis. BA, bile acid; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; BSEP, bile salt
  export pump; ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter; FXR, farnesoid
