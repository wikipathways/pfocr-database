caption: IRS acetylation by abnormal cytoplasm-appearing P300 causes insulin resistance.
  (A) Insulin-mediated activation of PI3K-AKT signaling leads to FOXO1 phosphorylation,
  nuclear exclusion and degradation, subsequently inhibition of gluconeogenic gene
  expression in the liver. (B, C) Overnutrition induced abnormal cytoplasm-appearing
  P300 acetylates IRS1 and IRS2 to disrupt their association with insulin receptors
  and insulin signaling. FOXO1 cannot be phosphorylated by AKT (B), leading to its
  nuclear accumulation and stimulation of overexpression of the gluconeogenic gene
  in the liver (C). The solid arrows indicate the direct effects, the dashed arrows
  indicate indirect effects, and the crossed line indicates the blockade of the pathway.
