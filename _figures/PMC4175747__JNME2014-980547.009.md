caption: Schematic diagram of fructose-mediated adipocyte expansion and potential
  mechanisms underlying HO-1-mediated improvement of fructose-induced adipocyte hypertrophy.
  Excessive fructose consumption is accompanied by decreases in HO-1 gene expression
  and a concurrent increase in cellular heme levels. Increase in cellular heme results
  in lipid peroxidation of the essential fatty acid, arachidonic acid, via activation
  of ROS. The metabolite of this process is isoprostane and, therefore, heme catalyzes
  isoprostane synthesis. Isoprostane release induces adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction.
  In contrast, the increase in HO-1 expression and HO activity by pharmacological
  agents, for example, CoPP, leads to a decrease in the cellular heme pool and an
  increase in the canonical Wnt pathway and of adiponectin. Adiponectin enhances the
  antioxidant mechanisms, thereby decreasing lipid droplet size along with attenuation
  of isoprostane production. An increase in HO activity lowers lipid peroxidation,
  thereby decreasing isoprostane production and diminishing expression of the adipogenic
  markers Peg-1/Mest, FAS, and aP2, resulting in the lowering of adipocyte hypertrophy.
  Thus, activation of the HO-1-adiponectin axis along with an increase in the canonical
  Wnt cascade results in decreased heme (prooxidant) levels and isoprostane production
  in adipocytes and a decrease in fructose-mediated adipocyte dysfunction and lipid
  accumulation.
