caption: Key proteins involved in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are
  depicted focusing on the components with known links to autophagy mentioned in the
  text. The extrinsic pathway results from the binding of extracellular death ligands
  which transduce a signal resulting in the formation of the death inducing signaling
  complex and activation of caspase-8. This activation is potentiated by p62-mediated
  aggregation leading to efficient activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 then activates
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization through the formation of Bax/Bad/Bak
  pores leading to cytoplasmic Cytochrome-C, that activates the apoptosome and effector
  caspases (Caspase-3), and the release of SMAC (Diablo), a protein that disables
  Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). Activated effector (executioner) caspases
  then cleave multiple targets resulting in cell death.
