caption: Simplified diagram of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) stress signalling
  pathway. GR (unfolded) is unable to bind cortisol when bound to Bag1, and release
  of Bag1 allows GR to bind cortisol with low affinity, whereas Fkbp51 (encoded by
  Fkbp5) and p23 (encoded by Ptges3) are involved in increasing GR affinity to cortisol
  by stabilizing the GR heterocomplex into a high affinity state. Furthermore, Fkbp52
  (encoded by Fkbp4) dislocates Fkbp51 and facilitates nuclear translocation of the
  cortisol-bound GR heterocomplex into the nucleus to activate or repress target genes.
  Thus, higher Fkbp51 would promote GR retention in the cytoplasm, rendering target
  genes less responsive to stress [,,,]. GR = glucocorticoid receptor; Hsp = heat
  shock protein.
