caption: NF-κB and IRF signaling in response to mosquito-borne flavivirus infection
  and their antagonism in humans. Following viral infection, human cells recognize
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral RNA through pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) that include membrane-bound TLRs such as TLR-3 and
  -7 and cytoplasmic members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family, including RIG-I
  and melanoma-differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) [,]. In TLR signaling,
  TLR-3 and -7 detect double-stranded and single-stranded viral RNAs, respectively.
  Activated TLR-3 and -7 signal through the adaptor proteins Toll/interleukin receptor
  (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-including interferon (IFN)-β (TRIF) and myeloid
  differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), respectively. On the other hand, RLR
  signaling is activated once double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are sensed by RIG-I and
  MDA5, which, in turn, allows these receptors to bind the mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling (MAVS) protein through 14-3-3ε []. In addition, the cytosolic sensor cGAS
  is able to detect mosquito-borne flaviviruses as they disrupt mitochondrial morphodynamics,
  leading to the release of mitochondrial DNA that acts as a ligand for the activation
  of the cGAS-STING pathway [,]. cGAS induces the production of cGAMP which then binds
  to STING. Taken together, signaling through TRIF, MyD88, MAVS, and STING leads to
  the activation of different signaling molecules, including receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP)-1, NF-κB essential modular (NEMO), downstream kinases such as Tumor
  necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family member-associated NF-κB
  activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), I-kappa-B-kinase ε (IKKε), and the IKK-αβγ
  complex, which subsequently activate transcription factors that include NF-κB, IRF3,
  and/or IRF7 [,,]. Consequently, NF-κB, IRF3, and/or IRF7 are translocated to the
  nucleus where they elicit the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines
  and type I IFN, respectively [,]. However, virus-encoded antagonists of mosquito-borne
  flaviviruses (DENV in purple, ZIKV in green, WNV in light blue, JEV in orange, YFV
  in black) are able to block these pathways. See main text for details.
