caption: Schematic illustration showing the mechanisms for the protective effects
  of DR-Ab. DR-Ab protects against Ang II-induced cell injury by stabilization of
  membrane NKA and stimulation of its activity. This helps to maintain the normal
  intracellular ion homeostasis, thus reserves the cell size. DR-Ab inhibits NADPH
  oxidase activity by downregulation of p22phox and p47phox expression. Meanwhile,
  DR-Ab inhibits mitochondrial ROS generation and preserves mitochondrial function
  through stimulation of the AMPK/Sirt-3/PPARγ signaling pathway.
