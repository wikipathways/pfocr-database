caption: Several metabolic pathways are influenced by AR, leading to a metabolic switch
  observed in prostate cancer. AR can increase the uptake of glucose and glutamine.
  Further, AR can modulate the subsequent metabolism of nutrients. For example, AR
  regulates glucose flux through glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the pentose phosphate
  pathway and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. AR also increases de novo lipogenesis
  (through controlling expression of SCAP (SREBP cleavage protein)), fatty acid uptake
  and lipid storage. Elevated polyamines have also been demonstrated to promote cancer.
  Accordingly, AR directly regulates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key step in
  polyamine synthesis. AR androgen receptor; ACLY ATP citrate lyase; ACACA acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase alpha; FASN fatty acid synthase; ODC ornithine decarboxylase; TCA tricarboxylic
