caption: Organoid models of the female reproductive tract. In the human female reproductive
  tract, organoid models have been derived from the endometrium, fallopian tube, ovary,
  and cervix tissues and recapitulate the epithelial structure of the tissue of origin.
  All systems have been cultured in basal medium including Advanced DMEM/F12, B-27,
  and N-2 supplements, antibiotics, and L-Glutamine but also include a cocktail of
  growth factors and inhibitors to promote proliferation and maintain undifferentiated
  or progenitor cell-like conditions. Common to all models is the growth factor EGF
  and the WNT signalling activator R-Spondin-1, as well as the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632
  and BMP pathway inhibitor Noggin, and Nicotinamide, a survival factor, and ROCK
  inhibitor. Other factors which are often added include the TGFB receptor inhibitor
  A83-01, the activin/ BMP/TGFB inhibitor, SB431542, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190;
  Growth factors FGF-10 (fibroblast growth factor) and WNT3A as well as other factors
  such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (antioxidant), β-estradiol (mitogen), heregulin-β (growth
  factor), forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator), and hydrocortisone (glucocorticoid).
