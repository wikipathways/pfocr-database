  defense related components. B. Network generated by pathway studio software showing
  interaction between ROS regulatory components. C.Network generated by pathway studio
  software showing interaction between storage related component. D. Manual integrated
  network showing interaction and interconnections between defense related components
  (red box, green bordered red star) ROS regulatory components (blue box, red star)
  and storage related component (black star). Defense components TOR(Serine threonine
  protein kinase), ROC (Peptidylprolylcis trans isomerase), BGL2 (Beta glucosidase),
  ATGLX (Lactolylglutathionelyase), ST2A (Sulfotransferase), MPK6 (MAP kinase), CSLD3
  (Cellulose synthase), PGIP (Poly galactouronase inhibiting protein), LIN2 (Coproporphirinogen
  III oxidase), Storage component PLA2A (Patatin like protein), ROS related component
  ATP1(V type ATPase), VHA-A (V type ATPase), ATCBR(Cytochrome b5 reductase), RBOH
  (Respiratory burst oxidase), CSD/MSD (Manganese or copper superoxide dismutase),
  RSR4 (Reduced sugar response 4), NTRC/B (NTRC/ NADPH-dependent thioredoxinreductase
  C/B).
