caption: Schema of the FUS1 pathway. Activation of FUS1 in normal cells in response
  to apoptotic stimuli, stress, or restoration of wt-FUS1 function by ectopic gene
  transfer in FUS1-deficient tumor cells activates the intrinsic mitochondrial apopto-sis
  pathway. Activation of FUS1 triggers cytochrome c (Cyt C) release from the inner
  membrane of mitochondria to the cy-tosol, selectively and directly interacts with
  Apaf-1 and recruits it to a critical subcellular location, and activates Apaf-1
  by induction of its ATPase activity in situ thus facilitating downstream Apaf-1-mediated
  apoptosome assembly, caspase activation, and apoptosis induction. Activation of
  FUS1 may also block MDM2-associated proteolytic degradation of p53 and enhance the
  p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. The potent tumor suppressor activity of FUS1 is
  also in part mediated by its inhibition of multiple oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases
  (PTKs) including EGFR, PDGFR, c-Abl, c-Kit, and AKT that are up-regulated in cancer
  cells. FUS1-mediated inactivation of these oncogenic PTKs leads to induction of
  apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and survival.
