caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of genes with eQTL associations with identified
  disease-associated SNPs. (A) Enriched pathways of genes with eQTL associations with
  identified disease-associated SNPs. The ‘primary immunodeficiency pathway (hsa05340)’
  was enriched from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes () and is illustrated.
  Genes whose expression were quantitatively associated with the identified disease-associating
  SNPs are highlighted in red. Cell developmental stages are annotated using green
  boxes. HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; DP, CD4+CD8+; NK, natural killer; eQTL, expression
  quantitative trait loci.
