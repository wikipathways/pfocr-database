caption: We have previously shown that ICP10PK activates Ras by phosphorylation (inactivation)
  of the negative regulatory GTPase Ras-GAP (), as well as recruitment of the Grb2/Sos
  complex () and it, in turn, activates the Raf-1/MEK/ERK downstream pathway components
  (, ; ). Our present findings indicate that ICP10PK can also activate the adenylate
  cyclase/PKA pathway, which converges with MEK on ERK activation. This results in
  Bag-1 and Bcl-2 stabilization and Bad phosphorylation (inhibition) leading to inhibition
  of caspase-3 activation. In addition, ERK activation causes XIAP upregulation and
  Smac/DIABLO downregulation through XIAP-mediated proteosomal degradation. XIAP upregulation
  and Smac/DIABLO downregulation inhibit the activity of cleaved (activated) caspase-3.
  The outcome is apoptosis inhibition. The dotted lines represent the hypothetical
  involvement of AP-1, upregulated/activated by ICP10PK through the activation of
  the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway (; ) in AC upregulation directly, or through PAC1.
