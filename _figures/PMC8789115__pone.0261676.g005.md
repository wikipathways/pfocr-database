caption: Spring embedding of FSAHF based on normalised graphlet adjacency  (left)
  and  (right), where nodes represent non-cancer-related genes (red) and known cancer
  driver genes RB1 and TP53 (yellow), and edges represent weighted normalised graphlet
  adjacency (see legend). Graphlet G6 is indicated in translucent purple in the spring
  embedding based on G0, connecting genes RB1, TP53, HMGA2 and CABIN1. The subnetwork
  obtained by inducing these same nodes is also indicated in translucent purple in
  the spring embedding based on graphlet adjacency . Although only connected via HMGA2
  when considering regular adjacency, TP53 and RB1 are directly connected to CABIN1
  in the spring embedding based on graphlet adjacency , illustrating how graphlet
  adjacencies can capture functionally relevant indirect relationships between nodes.
