caption: Morphoproteomic analyses shows a similarity among DSRCT, ES and WT in the
  constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway, evidenced by the expression of p-mTOR
  and p-p70S6K. We also found that mTORC2 is the dominant form in both ES and DSRCT,
  whereas mTORC1 is activated in WT. Our results also suggest a mechanism that may
  be used to predict response to IGF1R/mTOR inhibitor therapy, which is to compare
  Akt/mTOR pathway and Ras/Raf/ERK pathway activation. If the IGF1R/mTOR pathway is
  the dominant pathway, the patient may respond to IGF1R-related therapy.
