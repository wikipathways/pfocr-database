caption: Shown are the changes in the signaling pathways during the first 24 hours
  of blast colony development. Both Wnt and Numb are indicated as active in the isolated
  Flk-1+ population (0h) as well as in the 12 hour colonies. The Notch pathway is
  not active in the starting Flk-1 population, but is activated within the first 12
  hours of colony growth. The activation of Notch induces different Wnt inhibitors,
  which in turn inhibits the Wnt pathway by 24 hours. Arrows below the line indicate
  specification to the primitive erythroid and definitive hematopoietic lineages.
  The thicker red arrow at 24 hours represents a higher proportion of primitive erythroid
  progenitors at this stage, whereas the thicker blue arrow at 48 hours depicts an
  expansion of the definitive lineages.
