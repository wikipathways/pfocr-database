caption: Proposed model of MBZ in regulating migration and apoptosis in NSCLC cells.
  (A) Chemical structure of MBZ. (B) Graphic demonstrating the action of MBZ in regulating
  migration and apoptosis in an NSCLC model. MBZ-induced ROS accumulation inhibits
  the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and the downstream genes including, BCL-xl, C-MYC,
  SNAI1, and TWIST1, resulting in the inhibitory effect on cell migration and the
  initiation of cell apoptosis. MBZ, mebendazole; ROS, reactive oxygen species; JAK,
  Janus kinase; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3; NSCLC,
  non-small cell lung cancer; BCL-xl, Bcl-2-like protein 1; C-MYC, Myc proto-oncogene
  protein; SNAI1, Zinc finger protein SNAI1; TWIST1, Twist-related protein 1
