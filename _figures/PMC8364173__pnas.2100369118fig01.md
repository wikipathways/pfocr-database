caption: Proposed mechanistic models for the Rcs stress response. Rcs components (orange)
  are shown in the context of the envelope structure and biogenesis pathways. The
  sensory lipoprotein RcsF and the negative regulator IgaA are central to the regulation
  of RcsCDB phosphorelay. RcsF is exported to the OM by the Lol pathway; the Bam complex
  assembles RcsF with partner OMPs, leading to a partially surface-exposed topology.
  Red arrows represent proposed signaling events in response to stress (red stars)
  that are not yet fully understood. (A) Proposed model for the OM/LPS sensing by
  RcsF. Cell surface localization of RcsF NTD enables RcsF to monitor the integrity
  of the outer leaflet. Upon LPS stress (e.g., PMB treatment), the signal is transduced
  to the periplasmic CTD through the conformational change in the RcsF/OMP complex
  stimulating downstream signaling. (B) Proposed model for the Bam complex sensing
  function of RcsF. Envelope stress by an unknown mechanism inhibits the Bam complex
  function; as a result, RcsF/BamA interaction is prevented, and RcsF is accumulated
  in the periplasmic-facing orientation stimulating downstream signaling.
