caption: Schematic representation of TGF-β signaling as well as the role of TGF-β
  signaling pathway in cancer onset and progression. TGF-β activates both Smad-dependent
  canonical and Smad-independent noncanonical signaling pathways. TGF-β binds to TβRII
  which then activates TβRI. TβRI-phosphorylated Smad2/3 form complexes with Smad4,
  entering nucleus and regulating the transcription of different targeted genes in
  both early and late stages of tumor development, contributing to tumor suppression
  and tumorigenesis, respectively. Smad7 antagonizes TGF-β signaling through blocking
  Smad2/3 activation and interfering with the formation of Smad2/3/4-DNA complex.
  In the noncanonical signaling pathways, TGF-β receptors initiate the signal through
  MAPKs, PI3K, and Rho family of small GTPases etc. Activated JNK/p38/ERK either interact
  with SMADs or induce their individual transcriptional programs directly to affect
  cancer cells. Rho-activated Rho-associated protein kinase is involved in cytoskeleton
  modification in the process of EMT. Through PI3K-AKT pathway, TGF-β can also activate
  mammalian target of rapamycin to regulate protein translation. In addition, TGF-β
  activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor proteins can
  also induce NF-κB signaling for inflammatory response.
