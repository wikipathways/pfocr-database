caption: 'Comparison between the opposite effects of probiotics and early-life use
  of antibiotics in NOD mice. (A) T1D protective effects of probiotic bacteria in
  NOD mice: Lactobacillus johnsonii N6 enhances the expression of INFγ and indolesamine
  2,3-dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) which in turn increase the production of claudin-1
  tight junction protein that maintains the integrity of the gut epithelium. Lactobacillus
  casei has probiotic properties, lowering the number of the splenic CD8+ cytotoxic
  T cells and promoting the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL2, IL10)
  leading to increased immune tolerance in the gut. VSL3# probiotic has immune-modulatory
  functions, enhancing the expression of IL-33 cytokine that is necessary to maintain
  immune-tolerance in the gut and mesenchymal lymph nodes (MLN). (B) Role of antibiotic
  mediated dysbiosis in enhancing autoimmunity and pancreatic β-cells destruction
  in NOD mice: dysbiosis mediated by the use of antibiotics enhances the growth of
  pathogenic bacteria which promotes the inflammatory response via the TLR pathway
  which influences the gut permeability leading to metabolic endotoxemia. Endotoxemia
  stimulates the autoreactive T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes leading to insulitis
  and β cell destruction. The figure was created using BioRender.com and Science slides
  software.'
