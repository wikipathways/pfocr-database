caption: Canonical pathway of KEAP1-dependent NRF2 degradation. Under unstimulated
  conditions, the interaction between KEAP1 and NRF2 favors its ubiquitination by
  the CUL3 ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and promotes NRF2 proteasomal degradation in
  the cytosol. In presence of ROS and other electrophiles, KEAP1 is modified and NRF2
  escapes from degradation, enters into the nucleus, and transactivates a large number
  of cytoprotective genes after heterodimerization with members of the small Maf proteins.
