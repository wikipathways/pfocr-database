caption: (a) Synthesis of UDP-L-FucNAc requires the sequential activity of enzymes
  CapE, CapF and CapG. The enzyme CapE is a bifunctional enzyme catalysing the 4,6-dehydration
  of UDP-D-GlcNAc and a subsequently C5-epimerization. CapF catalyses the C3-epimerization
  of the previous intermediate, followed by the reduction of the keto-sugar at position
  C4. CapG catalyses a C2-epimerization to yield the final product UDP-L-FucNAc. The
  asterisks indicate the chemical groups subjected to enzymatic modification. This
  pathway is adapted from previous mechanistic studies [,]. (b) Structure of the substrate
  analogue UDP-6N3-GlcNAc, where the hydroxyl group at C6 of the substrate is replaced
  by an azide substituent [].
