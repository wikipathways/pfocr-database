caption: 'The underlying link between Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Notes:
  Insulin resistance reduces the degradation of Aβ by IDE, and makes the combination
  of insulin and insulin receptor impaired. Under normal conditions, the insulin signaling
  pathway can inhibit Aβ production and tau protein phosphorylation through inhibiting
  the translation of β-site amyloidogenic cleavage of BACE1 and its substrate APP,
  and inhibiting phosphorylation of GSK-3β. In addition, the insulin signaling pathway
  prevents abnormal intracellular accumulation of Aβ by accelerating its trafficking
  from the Golgi and trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and increasing its
  extracellular secretion. However, insulin resistance and deficiency make insulin
  signal conduction abnormal, leading to increased production of Aβ in the brain with
  Alzheimer’s disease. Increased Aβ monomers gather into oligomers. Aβ oligomers cause
  abnormal activation of the TNF-α/JNK pathway, resulting in insulin resistance. Further,
  insulin and IGF-1 deficiency promote Aβ accumulation by decreasing the Aβ-binding
  carrier proteins. Aβ oligomers can also induce oxidative damage of the mitochondria.Abbreviations:
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid-β; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; BACE1,
  β-site amyloidogenic cleavage of precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1; GSK-3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β; IRs, insulin receptor substrates; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor
  alpha; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1.'
