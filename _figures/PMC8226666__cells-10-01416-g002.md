caption: 'A proposed model for Hippo pathway regulation by metabolism and Hippo pathway
  targets for metabolism. Metabolism can regulate or be regulated by the Hippo pathway
  through different mechanisms. In a nutrient-rich environment, glucose through glycolysis
  and mitochondrial OXPHOS inactivates AMPK by increasing the ATP:AMP ratio; in an
  energy stress environment, active AMPK inhibits YAP/TAZ by direct phosphorylation
  and/or activating LATS1/2. Amino acids induce the activation of mTOR, which also
  activates YAP/TAZ through various mechanisms. Fatty acids increase the expression
  of JCAD, which inhibits LATS2. Hippo core kinases MST and LATS regulate lipogenesis,
  as LATS2 can directly bind to SREBP precursors (SREBPs) and inhibit its processing
  to mature cleaved SREBP (SREBP-C), thus blocking its transcriptional activity. One
  possible mode of the Hippo pathway regulating metabolism is as follows: Hypo-phosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ accumulate in the nucleus, where they can bind to various TFs (such
  as HIF1α and SREBP) or TEAD family, to direct transcription and expression of enzymes
  involved in complex metabolic pathways. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; JCAD,
  junctional protein associated with coronary artery disease; LATS, large tumor suppressor;
  MST, mammalian sterile 20 like; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; SREBP, sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein; TEAD, TEA domain protein; TFs, transcription
  factors; YAP/TAZ, yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding
  motif.'
