caption: 'CADBIOM model for the canonical TGF-β pathway. (A) Schematic representation
  of the canonical pathway. Binding of TGF-β to the receptor induces recruitment and
  phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Activated Smad2/3 heterodimerizes with Smad4 and the
  complex migrates to nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. (B) Two examples
  of translations from the PID database (left) into the CADBIOM representation (right).
  Top: interaction of Smad2/3 with Smad4. The CADBIOM representation uses two transitions
  from a component toward the complex, conditioned by the presence of the other component
  and leading to the synchronization of the transition. The same event h1 is associated
  with the two transitions that occur simultaneously. Bottom: migration of the Smad
  complex to the nucleus. The CADBIOM representation uses a transition between the
  two places “SMAD3_SMAD4_active_cytoplasm” and “SMAD3_SMAD4_active_nucleus” conditioned
  by the presence of importins within the guard. The event h1 indicates the timing
  of the transition. (C) CADBIOM illustration of the canonical pathway after integration
  of the three PID pathways: “TGF-β receptor signaling” (PID Ref: tgfbrpathway), “regulation
  of cytoplasmic and nuclear Smad2/3 signaling” (PID Ref: Smad2-3pathway) and “regulation
  of nuclear Smad2/3 signaling” (PID Ref: Smad2-3nuclearpathway).'
