caption: Key neuroanatomical pathways of the circadian system. The light-dark detection
  pathway begins at the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs),
  activated by the presence of light with a wavelength of approximately 460 nm during
  the day. Light activates the pathway via the melanopsin-containing ipRGCs which
  phototransduces light stimuli into electrophysiological impulses that are further
  conveyed through the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
  the master biological timekeeper. Projections from the SCN mainly innervate the
  paraventricular nucleus, which travels down to the intermediolateral cell column
  and superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Noradrenergic SCG projections to the pineal
  gland activate melatonin secretion into the bloodstream. In the presence of light,
  the SCN provides an inhibitory (via ϒ-aminobutryiuc acid) signal to this pathway
  to suppress melatonin secretion. Conversely, glutamatergic output from the SCN to
  the PVN enhances melatonin synthesis and secretion during darkness. Figure reproduced

  regulation. Rev Endocr Metab Disord 2009; 10, 261–270
