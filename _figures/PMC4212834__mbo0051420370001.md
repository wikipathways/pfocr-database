caption: Engineering a pathway for butyrate synthesis. The C. ljungdahlii native pathways
  for acetate and ethanol formation are indicated in grey. The added butyrate pathway
  is in black. Genes encoding enzymes are in parentheses. The thick black “x” indicates
  pathways that were disrupted in this study.
