caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. a In the absence of Hh ligand, PTCH prevents
  activation of SMO. SMO cannot inhibit protein kinases including PKA, GSK-3β, and
  CK1. These protein kinases phosphorylate GLI protein in complex with SUFU resulting
  in cleavage of GLI into a repressed form. The repressed form will translocate to
  the nucleus inhibiting Hh target gene expression. b Hh ligand binds PTCH1 (transmembrane
  receptor). Smoothened (SMO) is relieved and inhibits proteolytic cleavage of GLI
  protein resulting in an active form. The active GLI protein translocates to nucleus
  and activates transcription factors. Cyclopamine binds to SMO preventing signal
  transduction to GLIS
