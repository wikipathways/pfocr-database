caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway. Three distinct forms of TGF-β, TGF-β1, -β2,
  and -β3, can bind to the heterodimeric TGF-β receptor complex, consisting of the
  type I receptor (TβRI) and type II receptor (TβRII). Once TGF-β1 binds to the receptor
  complex, intracellular Smad2 and Smad3 are recruited and phosphorylated by TβRI
  at their C-terminal SSXS motif. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 subsequently bind
  to Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to initiate target gene expression in collaboration
  with co-factors and other transcription factors (TFs). TGF-β can also activate the
  PI3K, RhoA, TAK1, and Ras/MAPK pathways in a Smad-independent manner.
