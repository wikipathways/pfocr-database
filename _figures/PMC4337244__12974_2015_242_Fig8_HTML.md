caption: 'Schematic illustrating proposed mechanism of TLR4 activation and downstream
  signaling in the PVN hypertension. One of the mechanisms of sustained elevation
  of blood pressure in essential hypertension could be due to increased activation
  of TLR4 in the PVN and subsequent activation of NFκB pathway to produce inflammatory
  alterations, sympathoexcitation, and cardiac hypertrophy. Blockade of TLR4 in the
  PVN attenuates hypertensive response and prevents detrimental inflammatory changes
  associated with hypertension. Besides reduction in MAP in VIPER treated SHR rats,
  we also observed reduction in plasma NE levels. Therefore these beneficial effects
  might be also due to reduction in plasma NE and HMGB1 levels as observed in this
  study: HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; MAP, mean arterial pressure; NE, norepinephrine;
  NFĸB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PVN, paraventricular nucleus; SHR, spontaneously hypertensive
  rat; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; VIPER, viral inhibitory peptide of TLR4.'
