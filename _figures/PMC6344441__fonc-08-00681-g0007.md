caption: Schematic figure for sildenafil-mediated apoptotic sensitization pathways.
  Doxorubicin induces cell apoptosis, which is associated with DNA repair processing
  composed of both HR and NHEJ repair pathways. Sildenafil results in impairment of
  both repair systems that are evident by Rad51 down-regulation and its decreased
  foci formation in the nucleus in HR pathway, and a decrease of the DNA end-binding
  of Ku80 in NHEJ pathway. The combination treatment ultimately causes an enhanced
  decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, leading to the activation of caspase
  cascades and cell apoptosis.
