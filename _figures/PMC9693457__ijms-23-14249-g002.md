caption: Autonomous signaling in CLL cells. The mechanisms leading to autonomous signaling
  ((B), right) are depicted and compared with the continuous signaling delivered by
  mutated EGFR in cancer epithelial cells ((A), left). In normal epithelial cells,
  dimerization of a proportion of the membrane’s EGFR molecules by EGF causes the
  activation of the downstream pathway, which is transient and lasts until EGF is
  present in the micro-environment (top). In neoplastic cells, “mutated” EGFR molecules
  aggregate spontaneously, providing continuous signaling to the cells which are induced
  to proliferate (bottom). In normal B cells, BcR stimulation is caused by the presence
  of a specific antigen and is transient (top). In CLL, in which autonomous signaling
  occurs, BcR signaling is constantly activated since the BcR binds to a specific
  structure of the BcR itself (marked in blue).
