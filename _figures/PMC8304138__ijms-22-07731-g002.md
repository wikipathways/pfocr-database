caption: This figure illustrates the RA signaling pathway which plays a role in tissue
  homeostasis. Retinol, travels through the bloodstream bound to retinol-binding protein
  (RBP) and transthyretin (TTR). An integral plasma membrane protein, stimulated by
  retinoic acid 6 (STRA6), allows cellular uptake of retinol across the cell membrane
  into the target cell cytoplasm. Inside the cell, retinol binds to cellular retinol-binding
  protein (CRBP), which delivers it to the enzymes that convert it to ATRA in two
  steps. First, retinol is reversibly oxidized into retinal by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase
  or retinol dehydrogenase (ADH/RDH) or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs,
  not shown). Next, retinal is irreversibly converted to retinoic acid or all-trans
  retinoic acid by the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme family members. ATRA either
  gets degraded by ATRA-degrading cytochrome P450 reductases, such as CYP26A1, which
  converts ATRA to inactive metabolites, or it binds to cellular retinoic acid-binding
  proteins (CRABPs) and gets transported into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus,
  ATRA functions as a ligand and binds to a heterodimer of retinoic acid receptor
  (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). The RAR/RXR heterodimer binds to retinoic acid
  response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory region of target genes, which triggers
  a conformational change by inducing the release of co-repressors and the recruitment
  of co-activator complexes.
