caption: Intersection network of the miRNA target pathway network. The illustrated
  network was generated from the data of the miRNA target pathways in coronary atherosclerotic
  plaque, ruptured coronary plaque, carotid plaque and advanced carotid plaque. A.
  The network showed that the whole blood miRNA targeted Signaling by Rho GTPases
  and Hemostasis in the four atherosclerotic lesion. B. The network showed that the
  plasma miRNA targeted Signaling by Hemostasis and Rho GTPases in four atherosclerotic
  lesions.
