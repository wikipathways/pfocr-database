caption: 'The VEGF-A/VEGFR2 axis drives HB pathogenesis via angiogenesis stimulation.
  Upon activation of the VEGFR2 receptor in vascular endothelial cells, VEGF-A triggers
  multiple downstream signaling pathways that promote angiogenesis, including gene
  expression, cell proliferation, migration, and survival. These pathways include
  the following: (1) Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway: Activation of VEGFR2 initiates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  signaling cascade, which promotes endothelial cell proliferation and enhances angiogenesis.
  (2) PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway: VEGFR2 activation leads to the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, promoting cell survival and proliferation, thereby facilitating vascular
  formation. (3) JAK/STAT pathway: Additionally, VEGFR2 activates the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway, which promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration, further enhancing
  angiogenesis and facilitating tumor metastasis. (4) p38/MAPK/HSP27 pathway: VEGFR2
  also activates the p38/MAPK/HSP27 signaling pathway, influencing intracellular actin
  reorganization and directly promoting angiogenesis. While these signaling pathways
  perform distinct biological functions, they exhibit synergistic effects that collectively
  enhance the development of tumor-associated neovascularization, ultimately driving
  the growth and malignant progression of HB'
