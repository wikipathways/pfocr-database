caption: 'Main signaling pathways activated by cannabinoid receptors. The canonical
  signaling pathway initiated by the binding of a cannabinoid to CBRs involves the
  coupling of the receptor to Gi/0 proteins. αi subunits can inhibit the activity
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and the synthesis of cAMP. This results in a decreased
  activation of PKA and an increased activation of potassium channels type A, which
  leads to membrane hyperpolarization. α0 subunits can in turn inhibit voltage dependent
  Ca2+ channels contributing to the inhibition of membrane depolarization. βγ subunits
  interact with other intracellular pathways related to PI3K or PKB/Akt. CBRs are
  also coupled to neutral sphingomyelinase (EMN), an enzyme that mediates the generation
  of ceramide from sphingomyelin (EM) in the plasma membrane. Ceramide acts as an
  intracellular signaling molecule than can activate several transcription factors
  including ERK, JNK and p38, and is involved, among other functions, on the control
  of cell fate and survival. AC: adenylyl cyclase; FAN: factor associated with neutral
  sphingomyelinase activation; N, P/Q: voltage-dependent calcium channels type N,
  P/Q; PKA: protein kinase A; PKB/Akt: protein kinase B; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; PI3K: phosphoinositide-3
  kinase.'
