caption: A simplified model proposing how DRT111/SFPS-mediated seed development and
  germination are regulated in part by interactions among members of the ABA signaling
  pathway and components of the light signaling pathway. Arrows indicate activation
  and T-bars represent inhibition. Solid and dashed lines represent direct and indirect
  regulation, respectively. AS, Alternative splicing; RRC1, REDUCED RED LIGHT RESPONSES
  IN cry1cry2 BACKGROUND1. The pathway shown in blue is based on , , and the pathway
  shown in black is based on  and .
