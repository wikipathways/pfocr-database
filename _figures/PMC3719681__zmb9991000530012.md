caption: Model illustrating the role of the AKAP-Lbc/p38 activation complex in the
  regulation of compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. AKAP-Lbc assembles a signaling complex,
  which includes the scaffolding protein PKNα, as well as MLTK, MKK3, and p38α. In
  response to pressure overload, AKAP-Lbc promotes the formation of RhoA-GTP, which
  in turn induces the sequential activation of PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α within the
  AKAP-Lbc complex. This results in the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway that
  controls protein synthesis and promotes compensatory cardiac hypertrophy, which
  temporarily preserves the function of the stressed heart.
