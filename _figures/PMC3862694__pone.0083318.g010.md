caption: In a simplified scheme, insulin signalling to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is
  mediated through phosphorylation of the insulin receptor 1 or 2 (IRS 1/2), subsequent
  activation of PI3K class I and protein kinase B/AKT, which either directly, or indirectly
  via inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/TSC2) and activation
  of the small GTPase RHEB, activates mTORC1 (an inhibitor of autophagy). Adenosine
  5-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can inhibit mTOR indirectly after
  activation of TSC1/TSC2 by phosphorylating residues different from those phosphorylated
  by AKT. PTEN, through its lipid phosphatase activity inhibits the generation of
  phosphatydilinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatydilinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) caused by the above mentioned activation of class I PI3K. This leads to the
  inhibition of AKT/PKB signalling, which activates the TSC1/2 complex, restrains
  mTORC1 and consequently induces autophagy. By contrast, in U87MG cells, expression
  of PTEN under the control of a tetracycline-inducible system activates autophagy
  and inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) through a lipid phosphatase-independent
  activity and in an mTOR-independent way. ERK1/2 and PKA may be involved in this
  signaling pathway. In contrast to autophagy, much less is known on the regulation
  of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Both catabolic pathways are closely interrelated
  (indicated by the double headed arrow interconnecting them) and, therefore, it could
  be also possible that PTEN directly affects only one of them.

  description: In a simplified scheme, insulin signalling to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
    is mediated through phosphorylation of the insulin receptor 1 or 2 (IRS 1/2),
    subsequent activation of PI3K class I and protein kinase B/AKT, which either directly,
    or indirectly via inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/TSC2)
    and activation of the small GTPase RHEB, activates mTORC1 (an inhibitor of autophagy).
    Adenosine 5-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can inhibit mTOR indirectly
    after activation of TSC1/TSC2 by phosphorylating residues different from those
    phosphorylated by AKT. PTEN, through its lipid phosphatase activity inhibits the
    generation of phosphatydilinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatydilinositol

    in U87MG cells, expression of PTEN under the control of a tetracycline-inducible
    system activates autophagy and inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
    through a lipid phosphatase-independent activity and in an mTOR-independent way.
    ERK1/2 and PKA may be involved in this signaling pathway. In contrast to autophagy,
    much less is known on the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Both
    catabolic pathways are closely interrelated (indicated by the double headed arrow
