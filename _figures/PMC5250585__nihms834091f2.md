caption: A) TET-assisted active demethylation. The TET enzymes sequentially oxidize
  methylated cytosines (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, then 5-formylcytosine (5fC)
  and finally 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). These altered cytosines can then be excised
  by the thymine DNA glycosylase enzyme (TDG) and replaced with an unmodified cytosine
  by part of the base-excision repair pathway. B) TET-assisted passive demethylation.
  The TET enzymes oxidize methylated cytosines into 5hmC, which are a poor substrate
  for DNMT activity after DNA replication. With each cycle of replication, the methylation
  status is further diluted.
