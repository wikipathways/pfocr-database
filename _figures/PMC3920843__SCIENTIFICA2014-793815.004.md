caption: NF-κB signaling pathway and its regulation by influenza virus. (a) The canonical
  pathway involves activation of the IKK complex, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation,
  and subsequent degradation, resulting in nuclear translocation of the heterodimer
  RelA(p65)/p50. (b) The noncanonical pathway is dependent on phosphorylation-induced
  p100 processing. This leads to activation/translocation of the RelB/p52 complex.
  (c) Influenza virus activates the NF-κB pathway to facilitate the amplification
  of vRNAs and production of progeny viruses. Newly synthesized influenza viral proteins
  antagonize the activation of NF-κB signaling and inhibit the function of antiviral
  proteins or immunoregulatory molecules induced by the pathway.
