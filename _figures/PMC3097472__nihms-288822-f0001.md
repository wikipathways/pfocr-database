caption: Methionine, an essential amino acid required for protein synthesis, is the
  source of methyl groups for a number of methylation reactions such as methylation
  of nucleic acids, proteins, biogenic amines, phospholipids, and for creatine synthesis
  etc. []. During its metabolism, methionine is converted to its active form s-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM) (). Following SAM-dependent transmethylation, the product s-adenosyl
  homocysteine (SAH) is metabolized to adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine, either
  via transsulfuration pathway, is converted to cystathionine or is re-methylated
  back to methionine. The methyl group required for the methylation of homocysteine
  is obtained from either the folate dependent one carbon pool (5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate)
  or from (non vitamin-dependent) betaine in certain tissues. S-adenosyl methionine
  is also converted to SAH by glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), an enzyme abundant
  in the liver [, ]. The synthesis of SAM by s-adenosylmethionine synthase is regulated
  by hypoxia [], glutathione [], and availability of methionine [], and modified by
  oxidant injury [] and redox state [] of the cell. Although the effect of ATP availability
  on SAM synthesis is not known, an increase in s-adenosylmethionine synthase activity
  in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells caused a depletion of ATP []. Whether
  a limited availability of ATP as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo can
  cause decreased synthesis of SAM is not known. A decrease in synthesis of SAM in
  methionine adenosyl transferase 1A knockout mice predisposes the animal to hepatic
  injury and more susceptible to choline-deficient diet induced fatty liver []. Decreased
  SAM biosynthesis is also a consequence of all forms of chronic liver injury [].
