caption: Cold reduces DNA methylation via upregulation of genes within the ROS1-pathway.
  Model depicting the observed transcriptional effect of cold treatment on expression
  of sugar beet homologs of DNA methylation- or demethylation-related genes a) mediating
  synthesis of s-adenosylmethionine or acting within b) the RdDM, c) methylation maintenance,
  or d) DNA demethylation pathways. The schematic illustration depicts differentially
  expressed sugar beet homologs of Arabidopsis genes, known to participate in the
  corresponding pathways as colored objects (blue to orange). (Homologs of) Additional
  genes contributing to each pathway, which were not differentially expressed in sugar
  beets in response to cold or for which no sugar beet homolog was identified, are
  shown as black-and-white structures to provide an overall representation of the
  entity of known players mediating the depicted mechanisms. Labels (corresponding
  to the gene name of each Arabidopsis homolog) and corresponding sugar beet accessions
  are provided for all DEGs in Additional File . For detailed functional description
  of the depicted genes and pathways, see main text
