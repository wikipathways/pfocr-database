caption: Molecular regulation of hepcidin by iron and inflammation. Increased systemic
  iron stimulates the production of the ligand bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6),
  which binds to the BMP Type I (ALK2/ALK3) and II (ACTRIIA) receptors, and the co-receptor
  HJV to stimulate phosphorylation of the SMAD1/5/8 intracellular signaling molecules.
  Phosphorylated SMAD 1/5/8 binds to SMAD4 and translocates to the nuclease to activate
  hepcidin transcription. The mechanism by which the hemochromatosis protein HFE and/or
  TFR2 regulate hepcidin expression is unknown but appears to involve an interaction
  with the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway. It has been proposed that an interaction between
  HFE and TFR1 is reduced under high iron conditions due to competitive binding of
  holotransferrin to TFR1. Displaced HFE could then associate with TFR2 and possibly
  the HJV-BMP receptor complex to regulate hepcidin. Inflammation also stimulates
  hepcidin production, in part via a canonical janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in which inflammation increases interleukin
  6 (IL6) binding to the IL6-receptor (IL6R) and thereby stimulating phosphorylation
  of JAKs and STAT3. Phosphorylated-STAT3 homodimers translocate to the nuclease and
  bind to the hepcidin promoter to stimulate hepcidin expression. Other mediators
  of inflammation and infection can also regulate hepcidin expression in this context
  (not shown). A mechanism of crosstalk between inflammatory signals and BMP signaling
  has been proposed in which inflammation induces activin B, which binds to BMP receptors
  to stimulate SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. SMADs and STAT3 may also interact at the
  level of the hepcidin promoter.
