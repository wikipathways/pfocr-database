caption: APA-linked genes are connected in protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks
  with known cancer-risk genes, such as CASP8 in breast and skin cancer. Pathway enrichment
  analysis shows that 3′aTWAS genes are enriched in cancer-related pathways, including
  the metabolic reprogramming pathway like intracellular protein transport (P = 1.13
  × 10−2, the apoptosis-related pathway (P = 8.75 × 10−4) and TRAIL signaling pathway
  (P = 6.07 × 10-4). Each node represents one APA-linked gene. Blue links between
  nodes represent a negative Z-score in 3′aTWAS, implying that usage of the short
  3′UTR increases cancer risk, whereas red lines represent positive z-scores, indicating
  that usage of the longer 3′UTR leads to increased cancer risk. Gray dashed line
  indicated the PPI interactions between APA genes and the known cancer genes in CGC
