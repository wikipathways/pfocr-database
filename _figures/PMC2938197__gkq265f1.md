caption: 'Predicted hydroxy/hydroperoxy wybutosine biosynthesis pathway and domain
  architecture of key enzymes involved in its synthesis. (A) Shown above each enzyme
  of the reaction pathway, in colored squares, is the phyletic profile of the protein
  family. The color intensity of the outline is used to depict its distribution within
  a particular lineage. Thus, darkly colored squares are used when an enzyme is present
  in most members of that eukaryotic lineage. Lighter coloring is used for enzymes
  that are present only in some members of a lineage. When an enzyme is completely
  absent from a lineage, the square is not colored. The Tyw4 enzyme in plants, apicomplexans
  and stramenopiles is a specialized case and marked with an asterisk in the phyletic
  profile. In these cases, the kelch domain of TYW4 is found between Tyw3 and Tyw2.
  These also have a solo LCMT domain that in trees groups with LCMT1 and may substitute
  for the LCMT2 seen in Tyw4. The eukaryotes are divided into eight major groups and
  the expansion of the abbreviations within the boxes are as follows: An, animals;
  Cf, choanoflagellates; Fu, fungi; Am, Amoebozoa; Pl, plants; Al, Alveolates, Ap,
  Apicomplexa; St, Stramenopiles; Ki, Kinetoplastids and Heterolobosea; He, Heterolobosea
  only; Ba, the basal lineages diplomonads and parabasalids. We predict that the hydroperoxywybutosine
  reaction seen in some lineages is catalyzed by the same wybutosine hydroxylase.
  (B) Domain architectures from representative eukaryotes are labeled with the gene
  name, species abbreviation and Genbank index number separated by underscores. Domains
  are labeled with standard names. X and Y represent poorly characterized globular
  domains. The phyletic profile for the domain architecture is shown next to them
  in colored boxes. The abbreviations are the same as in (A).'
