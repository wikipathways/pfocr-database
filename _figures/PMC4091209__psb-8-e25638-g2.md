caption: 'Figure 2. OS elicitation selectively activates genes in the phenylpropanoid
  pathway at 5 h after elicitation. Schematic representation of the phenylpropanoid
  pathway with the color coded representation of interactive effect response metric
  for two different comparisons: (A) Control vs. W+OS, (B) W+OS vs. W+W. Activation
  of gene expression in response to OS in treated leaves 1 h post elicitation is supported
  by the high value of the response metric at 1 h while the differential activation
  of these genes specifically to OS at 5 h in untreated leaf tissue in response to
  application of OS is reflected by the high value of response metric obtained from
  W+OS vs. W+W comparison at 5 h.'
