  on the basis of differentially expressed genes and metabolite content alteration.
  The rice variety IR-64 was germinated and allowed to grow for 5 d at 37°C and then
  transferred to Hewitt solution for growth. After 10 d of growth, seedlings of uniform
  size and growth were treated with 100 μM of Cr (VI) under standard physiological
  conditions. The microarray was performed using one-cycle target labeling and control
  reagents. The hybridization data were analyzed using dCHIP software. Metabolites
  in rice roots exposed to 100 μM Cr (VI) for 24 h analyzed mainly by GC-MS and NMR.
