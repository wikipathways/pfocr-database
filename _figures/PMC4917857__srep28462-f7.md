caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates downstream of lanosterol have recently
  been proposed to act as endogenous RORγ ligands. Analysis of the transformation
  of several cholesterol intermediates with four CYP enzymes revealed potential novel
  metabolites. These compounds have increased polarity due to the addition of a keto
  or a hydroxyl group to either the main sterol ring or to the side chain. Although
  they have yet to be characterized with regards to their RORγ activating potential,
  the results of Santori et al. indicate that the addition of hydroxyl groups to positions
  7, 24, 25, and 27 do not abolish RORγ specific activity.
