caption: Potential functions of Gcs1p during sporulation. Gcs1p is involved in multiple
  steps of membrane trafficking during sporulation. Gcs1p may aid in the transport
  of vesicles from the Golgi and/or in vesicle fusion at the site of prospore membrane
  synthesis. The interrupted arrow indicates that Gcs1p stimulation of Spo14p is most
  likely indirect. Additionally, Gcs1p functions in endosome-to-vacuole trafficking.
  Whether this pathway contributes to the sporulation process is uncertain, as indicated
  by the dashed arrow and question mark.
