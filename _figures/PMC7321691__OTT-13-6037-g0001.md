caption: 'The RT activates the IFNs-JAK/STAT1 pathway in cancer cells. After exposure
  to the IR, Type I and II IFN bind to their respective receptors to induce a number
  of signal transduction cascades, then the JAK kinase and the STAT1 being recruited
  to the receptor and phosphorylated in cytoplasm. The phosphorylated STAT1 triggers
  the heterodimers (ISGF3) or homodimers, and migrate to the nucleus. These complex
  bind to ISRE or interferon-gamma-activated sequence (GAS) gene promoter elements,
  respectively drives the downstream IFN-regulated genes expression and perform cellular
  functions, which are associated with radioresistance. Phosphorylated STAT1 also
  contributes to develop cisplatin resistance, as well as upregulate clustering in
  docetaxel-resistant cells. The miRNAs and SOCS proteins functions as the major regulators
  to control of the IFNs/STAT1 pathway.Abbreviations: EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; GAS, interferon-gamma-activated sequence; IR, ionizing radiation; IRF9,
  interferon regulatory factor 9; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; ISRE,
  interferon-stimulated response element; IFN, interferon; JAK, Janus kinase; miRNA,
  microRNA; RT, radiation therapy; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; STAT1,
  signal transducer and activation of transcription 1.'
