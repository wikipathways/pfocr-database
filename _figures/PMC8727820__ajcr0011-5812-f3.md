caption: Effect of the gut microbiome on tumor cell pathways. A. ETBF can stimulate
  the overexpression of BFAL1, BFAL1, and miR-155-5p, moreover, miR -200a-3p competitively
  binds to activate the RHEB/mTOR pathway and promote tumor growth. BFT secreted by
  ETBF binds to the receptors of tumor epithelial cells to increase the permeability
  of epithelial cells and stimulate the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein
  E-cadherin, enhances β-catenin nuclear signal transduction, increases the expression
  of oncogene c-Myc, and promote the proliferation of cancer cells. B. Clostridium
  butyricum can be regulated by Wnt signaling, and intestinal microbiota inhibits
  the development of intestinal tumors. It may also regulate colon cancer by inhibiting
  the NF-κB pathway and promoting apoptosis. C. Fusobacterium nuclei increase the
  expression of KRT7-AS/KRT7 by activating the NF-κB pathway. It activates the IL-6/p-STAT3/c-MYC
  signaling pathway in a TLR4-dependent manner. Activating the TLR4/MYD88/NK-κB pathway
  upregulates MicroRNA-21 expression. D. In aging hepatic stellate cells in the tumor
  microenvironment, the COX2 pathway driven by intestinal microbes produces the lipid
  mediator PGE2, thereby inhibiting tumor immunity.
