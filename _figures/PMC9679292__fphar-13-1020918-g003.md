caption: The mechanisms of ferroptosis in ischemic stroke. Following ischemic stroke,
  the BBB is disrupted, which allows Fe3+ in the blood to be released into cells through
  TF and TFR1, then stored in the endosome, where Fe3+ is converted into Fe2+ and
  transported to the cytoplasm by DMT1 with the cooperation of STEAP3. The excess
  Fe2+ generates ROS and participates in the synthesis of PUFA lipid peroxides (L-OOH),
  which can induce ferroptosis; System Xc− is simultaneously impaired, which inhibits
  cystine-glutamate exchange and reduces the generation of GSH and GPX4, thereby inhibiting
  lipid alcohol (L-OH) production, ultimately leading to ferroptosis. Additionally,
  the Nrf2 pathway can inhibit ferroptosis and alleviate ischemic stroke injury by
  inducing GSH, SLC7A11, and GPX4 transcription.
