caption: Overview of the transcriptional regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis
  pathway. Transcription factors involved are RegA (○, based on gene expression studies;
  ⌷ based on both gene expression and DNA binding studies), FnrL (◊, repressor; ◈,
  activator), AerR (⊗), CrtJ (★), HbrL (⊥). Arrows indicate a feedback control by
  heme operated through CrtJ or HbrL. Genes identified from bioinformatics analysis
  only, with no experimental studies, are specified with a question mark.
