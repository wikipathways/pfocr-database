caption: A suggested model of brassinosteroid (BR) regulation of immunity at multiple
  levels. BAK1 (BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1) is considered to mediate the growth
  and immunity tradeoff because it serves as a coreceptor for both BR-mediated responses
  via BRI1 and innate immunity mediated responses via flg-sensing 2 (FLS2). The scheme
  suggests an inhibition of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR, independent of complex
  formation with coreceptor BAK1, when the inhibition occurs downstream of BAK1. BRI1
  (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1) represents a BR receptor; flg22 (flagellin 22) is
  a type of pathogen- and microbe-associated molecule pattern (MAMP/PAMP); FLS2 (flg-sensing2)
  is a flg22 receptor; BIK1 (BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1) is a coreceptor of FLS2; BZR1/BES1
  (BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1/BRI1-EMS SUPPRESSOR 1, respectively) are the major transcriptional
  factors of the BR signaling pathway; MAPKs (mitogen activated protein kinases) are
  a class of marker proteins which indicate various stress conditions.
