caption: Crosstalk between hypoxia and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways.
  Hypoxia induces protein misfolding due to the lack of oxygen required for the formation
  of disulphide linkages, which leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the
  activation of UPR. Under basal conditions, BIP binds to PERK, IRE1α and ATF6 and
  prevents their activation. In response to ER stress during hypoxia, BIP dissociates
  from the three sensors, allowing their activation. Activated IRE1α mediates XBP1
  mRNA splicing (XBP1s) that it is translocated to the nucleus and regulates the expression
  of genes involved in cellular maintenance pathways. Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α resulting in a general slowdown of protein synthesis that allows the activation
  of ATF4, a master transcription factor which induces the expression of target genes
  such as CHOP. Moreover, there is an inhibition of mTOR-dependent protein translation.
  Besides, HIF-1α avoids proteasome degradation promoted by prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs)
  and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which allows its nuclear translocation and
  the induction of genes required for adaptation to a hypoxic environment. In this
  context, the inhibition of PHD3 activity enables ATF4 stabilization. Furthermore,
  ATF4 and XBP1 upregulate the expression of the ubiquitin ligase Siah2, which in
  turn provokes the degradation of PHDs favoring HIF-1α expression, thus establishing
  another link between hypoxia and UPR pathways. Moreover, XBP1 and HIF-1α trigger
  a transcriptional complex that regulates the expression of genes associated with
  HIF-1α through the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In addition, hypoxia-induced
  cell damage is counteracted by the UPR pathway through the upregulation of autophagy
  by ATF4 and IRE1α. Direct induction of autophagy may be also achieved by BIP-dependent
  activation of AMPK, which attenuates AKT-mTOR signaling.

  description: Crosstalk between hypoxia and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways.
    Hypoxia induces protein misfolding due to the lack of oxygen required for the
