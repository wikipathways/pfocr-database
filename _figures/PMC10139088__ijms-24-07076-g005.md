caption: Effects of metabolic plasticity regulation on tumour microenvironment. The
  stages of tumour development are also per stage of adapting and transforming for
  the microenvironment. (A) At the early stage of tumour development, CAAs produced
  by the death of tumour cells can be taken up by DCs, and CAAs are transmitted to
  the naive CD8+ T cells and differentiate into effector CD8+ T cells, then recognize
  the tumour cells and initiate the death of the tumour. This repetitive process is
  called CIC. The uptake of glucose, glutamine, and other nutrients can be utilized
  by glycolysis and OXPHOS. At the same time, OXPHOS can produce ROS, causing more
  damage to the tumour cells and then inducing DNA mutations, which increase its immunogenicity.
  Moreover, S1P and IL-7 can influence the differentiation of naive CD8+ T cells by
  S1P-driving OXPHOS and IL-7-driving glycolysis. Differentiated memory CD8+ T cells
  have better mitochondrial activity, and upon TCR and CD28 stimulation, their glycolytic
  metabolism can be promoted by activating the PI3K-mTOR-signaling pathway and differentiating
  into effector T cells. In addition, IFN-γ secreted by Th1 can activate macrophages
  to develop into M1-type macrophages but is unstable in an acidic microenvironment.
  NK cells can kill target cells directly, which is closely related to metabolic changes
  such as the activation of NK cells needed to switch its metabolism from mitochondrial
  oxidation to glycolysis. (B) In the progression of tumour development, the microenvironment
  favourable for the tumour was formed. The transition of OXPHOS to glycolysis or
  lactic acid can reduce cells’ immunogenicity, thus inhibiting the CIC. Excessive
  lactic acid (LA) produced by glycolysis is the inhibitory molecule of all anti-tumour
  immune cells, which can be absorbed by Treg cells, then suppressing effector CD8+
  T cells. An acidic microenvironment caused by LA can make IFN-γ unstable. Thus,
  it inhibits the differentiation of Th1 cells and turns to Th2, which antagonizes
  the differentiation of M1-type macrophages. Except for tumour cells, CAFs are the
  main source of lactic acid, which is recruited by platelet-derived growth factor
  (PDGF) secreted through the tumour cells. Moreover, CAFs are the origin of TGF-
  β, which can induce FBP1 expression. This weakened the glycolytic level of NK cells,
  thereby inactivating NK cells. Angiogenesis is an important characteristic of tumour
  cells, and glycolysis contributes to this process. Lactic acid and hypoxia can promote
  this process by stabilizing HIF-1, VEGF, bFGF, VEGFR2, etc. The formation of vascular
  buds is crucial in the process of angiogenesis, which is guided and initiated by
  tip endothelial cells and stalk cells. Glycolysis can promote endothelial cells
  to compete for “tip” sites and “stalk” sites, and this process is accompanied by
  the overexpression of the glycolytic regulatory PFKFB3.
