caption: Shc/Grb2/Gab2/PI-3K Akt pathway. (A) Shc signals to the PI-3K pathway via
  a Grb2-Gab2 complex. Shown are routes from the IL-3/GM-CSF/IL-5 receptors, which
  utilize βc, and the IL-2/IL-15 receptors, which signal via IL-2Rβ. For βc, tyrosyl-phosphorylated
  Shc provides the major route to the Grb2-Gab2 complex; tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp-2
  may provide an alternate route. In IL-2Rβ signaling, Shc provides the only route
  to PI-3K/Akt. (B) Model for Gab2 phosphorylation by βc cytokines. Following receptor
  activation, βc is phosphorylated on multiple sites. Y577, which is the Shc binding
  site, provides the major route to Grb2 tyrosyl phosphorylation, whereas Y612, the
  major Shp-2 binding site, as well as a minor binding site for Shc, is a minor route.
  Both Shc and Shp-2 become tyrosyl phosphorylated upon receptor stimulation and can
  bind Grb2, which is constitutively associated with Gab2, most likely via one or
  more proline-rich domains. This results in recruitment of Gab2 to the receptor complex
  and its tyrosyl phosphorylation. (C) Shc may integrate the Ras and PI-3K pathways.
  Shown are two potential means by which Shc might simultaneously nucleate complexes
  containing both Grb2/Sos and Grb2/Gab2/PI-3K. Such multicomplexes might facilitate
  Ras activation of PI-3K. For details, see the text.
