caption: 'SCF is highly expressed in IPF lungs and blood. A: ingenuity IPA was utilized
  to generate KIT-KITLG interaction and transcriptional activation network. The resulting
  network was then overlaid with gene expression data sets from IPF lung biopsies
  relative to normal lung explants (GSE24206). KIT-activated kinases and transcription
  factors are shown in large font and direct downstream targets for the activated
  transcription factors are shown in small fonts. Solid arrowheads indicated activation
  (A) or expression (E). Significantly upregulated (≥ 1.5-fold change and P ≤ 0.05)
  and downregulated (≥ −1.5-fold change and P ≤ 0.05) are depicted in red and green
  color, respectively. B: serum from normal (n = 9) or patients newly diagnosed with
  IPF by high-resolution computed tomography assessment (n = 41) were measured for
  SCF levels using a specific ELISA (R&D Systems, Rochester, MN). Levels of SCF were
  measured in serum collected after diagnosis. IPA, Integrated Pathway Analysis; IPF,
  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; SCF, stem cell factor.'
