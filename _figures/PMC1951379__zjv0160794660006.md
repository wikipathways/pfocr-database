caption: Model of IFN signaling during the clinical evolution of SARS. The IFN signaling
  canonical pathway from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to model the
  microarray ANOVA data (mean ratios) from precrisis SARS patients (n = 14), crisis-phase
  SARS patients (n = 13), and SARS patients at discharge (n = 6) compared to healthy
  controls (10 patients), as well as the mean change (n-fold; see scale) of the same
  groups from the IFN-α and IFN-γ cytokine analysis. Red indicates upregulated molecules,
  green indicates downregulated molecules, and hatched molecules were not represented
  on the microarray. (A) The precrisis phase of SARS is hallmarked by robust expression
  of IFN-α and IFN-γ and high transcriptional activation of ISGs. (B) Despite continued
  upregulation of ISGs in SARS patients during crisis, TAP1, a component of the TAP
  heterodimer responsible for cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules, is
  downregulated. (C) For SARS patients that recover, TAP1 is upregulated at discharge
  from hospital and ISG expression has returned to healthy control levels.
