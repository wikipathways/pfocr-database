caption: Mechanisms by which lipid metabolism regulates the STING signalling pathway.
  (1) LXR activation induced by cholesterol promote SMPDL3 A-catalyzed degradation
  of cGAMP, therefore inhibiting STING activation. (2) Lipotoxic molecules such as
  PUFAs and 7-HOCA induce mtDNA release, activating cGAS-STING signaling pathway.
  (3) SCFA engages GPR43, causing a rise in intracellular calcium and mtDNA release,
  inducing cGAS-STING signaling pathway. (4) cGAMP reduces ER cholesterol level, unlocking
  the retention of STING on ER, thus promoting its translocation. (5) SCAP and SREBP
  facilitate STING transport through physical connections. (6) Some lipid molecules
  disrupt the palmitoylation of STING through modification, inhibiting its activation.
  (7) PI4P promotes the post-Golgi transport of STING, enhancing its activity. (8)
  PI4P drives the formation of non-canonical autophagosomes that package and transport
  activated STING to immune cells
