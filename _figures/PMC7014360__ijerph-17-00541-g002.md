caption: Scheme of the metabolic pathway and relative metabolite levels in the experimental
  group including control, non-gardening, and gardening subjects. The pathway was
  modified from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
  The red characters indicate the metabolite detected by Gas chromatography time-of-flight
  mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography Linear-ion-trap
  Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS) with no significance. The colored
  squares (blue-to-red) represent the relative metabolite abundance in the experimental
  group including control, non-gardening, and gardening.
