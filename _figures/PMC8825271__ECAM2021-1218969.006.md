caption: Human cytomegalovirus infection pathway, the important target genes were
  mainly distributed in the P13K-AKT signaling pathway, the NF-kB signaling pathway,
  the MAPK signaling pathway, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Arrows represented activation
  impact, T-arrows represented inhibition impact, and segment showed activation or
  inhibition impact.
