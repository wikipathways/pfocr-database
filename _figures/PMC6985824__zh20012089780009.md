caption: 'Hypothesized signaling in distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells in normokalemia
  versus hypokalemia. A: in normokalemia, K+ efflux via the basolateral Kir4.1 channel
  and subsequent Cl− efflux via the basolateral Cl−channel Kb (ClCKB channel) are
  low, with no lysine (WNK)4 therefore inhibited by high intracellular Cl− concentration
  ([Cl−]i). Consequently, Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and Na+-Cl−
  cotransporter (NCC) activation are impeded. B: in hypokalemia, K+ and Cl− efflux
  are increased, and kidney-specific (KS-)WNK1 forms WNK bodies (yellow circle). WNK4
  and SPAK are subsequently recruited to WNK bodies, in which WNK4 and KS-WNK1 form
  dimers, enabling WNK4 autophosphorylation by relieving inhibition of WNK4 by Cl−.
  WNK4 then activates SPAK by phosphorylation (p), thereby enabling trafficking of
  SPAK to the apical membrane to activate NCC. In parallel, basolateral Cl− efflux
  disinhibits free cytoplasmic WNK4 not bound to KS-WNK1, providing an alternative
  pathway to NCC activation. Oxidative stress-responsive kinase-1 (OSR1) may take
  the place of SPAK. [K+]e, extracellular K+ concentration.'
