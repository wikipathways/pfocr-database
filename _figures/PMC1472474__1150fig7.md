caption: A quorum signaling pathway linking environmental sensing to morphogenesis
  and entry into stationary phase in S. cerevisiae. Aromatic alcohols are autosignaling
  molecules capable of stimulating morphogenesis in Saccharomyces by elevating the
  level of Flo11p through a Tpk2p-dependent mechanism. The production of aromatic
  alcohols is tightly controlled by environmental conditions. High ammonium represses
  their production by inhibiting the transcription of key genes in the biosynthesis
  pathway (such as ARO9 and ARO10), whereas low ammonium activates it. Cell density
  also controls the production of aromatic alcohols. High density stimulates the production
  by activating the expression of ARO9 and ARO10, whereas low cell density inhibits
  it. Moreover, the production of aromatic alcohols is under positive feedback control
  by tryptophol. Both the cell density-dependent and feedback regulation require transcription
  factor Aro80p. Aromatic alcohols also regulate the expression of many stationary-phase
  genes, suggesting a potential role in modulating the entry of Saccharomyces cells
  into stationary phase.
