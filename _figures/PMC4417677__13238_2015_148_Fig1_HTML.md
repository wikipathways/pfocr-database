  Inhibition of OCT1 (e.g., metformin treatment) results in lowered hepatic thiamine
  uptake, and consequently reduced TPP levels. The reduced ATP production, due to
  the decreased PDH and OGDH activity, triggers AMPK activation. The inhibition of
  SLC13A5 leads to lowered cytosol citrate contents, which attenuate the activating
  effect of citrate in malonyl-CoA synthesis. Both OCT1 and SLC13A5 inhibition reduce
  TG synthesis in the liver. Inhibition of ZnT8 causes reduced zinc release from the
  β-cell, and thus attenuates the autocrine effect of zinc in glucose induced insulin
  production; the hepatic zinc content is also reduced, with concomitant increased
  insulin clearance. The effects of OCT1, SLC13A5 and ZnT8 inhibition are shown with
  red, yellow and blue arrows respectively
