caption: A predicted mechanism of avenanthramides (Avns)-mediated anti-inflammatory
  in skeletal muscle C2C12 cells. Avns, the polyphenolic molecules identified solely
  in oats, exhibit anti-inflammatory activity mainly by inducing nuclear factor-kappaB
  (NF-κB) inactivation in C2C12 cells. Avns downregulated the expression of IκB kinase
  beta (IKKβ) as an inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit beta in cellular response to
  tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-meditated oxidative stress and attenuated the expression
  tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) at the transcriptional
  level under the same condition. Furthermore, Avns reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2) protein, along with decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels. The downregulated
  COX2/PGE2 pathway leads to the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis
  suppression, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis in various cell lines. Thus, Avns
  can be potent inhibitors of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response following the downregulation
  of IKKβ activity in C2C12 cells [,].
