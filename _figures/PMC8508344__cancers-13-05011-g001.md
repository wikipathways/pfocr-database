caption: Ovarian steroidogenesis. During a female reproductive age, the thecal and
  granulosa cells surrounding the developing ovarian follicle and the corpus luteum
  synthesize progestagens, androgens and estrogens; the Δ5pathway converts pregnenolone
  to 17-α-pregnenolone, which subsequently gives rise to androgens and estrogens,
  and is the preferred pathway in thecal cells. The Δ4pathway converts pregnenolone
  to progesterone, and is the main pathway in the granulosa lutein cells of the corpus
  luteum; however, estrogen synthesis also occurs. In OC tissue, local estrogen synthesis
  might take place from circulating androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S),
  dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione) (left green box) and estrogen precursors
  (estrone sulfate, estrone) (right green box) via the aromatase and sulfatase pathway,
  respectively. CYB5A, cytochrome b5 type A; CYP11A1, cytochrome P450 cholesterol
  side chain cleavage; CYP17A1, cytochrome P450 17A1; CYP19A1, cytochrome P450 19A1
