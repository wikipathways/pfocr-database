caption: Proposed model for the modulation of PAMP-induced Mϕ activation through AhR
  ligand exposure. After entering the cytoplasm, AhR ligands such as BaP or I3C bind
  to a complex of several proteins, containing AhR, HSP90, XAP2, P23, and Src. AhR
  ligand binding induces a conformational change in this protein complex resulting
  in translocation of the whole complex into the nucleus where it is degraded to release
  the AhR molecule. Inside the nucleus, AhR associates with the Aryl hydrocarbon nuclear
  translocator (ARNT) and binds to the Aryl hydrocarbon response element (AHRE) in
  the promotor region of target genes, i.e., Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, inducing their
  transcriptional activity (➪ canonical, genomic targets). This study confirms or
  suggest the expressional activation of several key immune genes, i.e., Il21r, Irf1,
  but also Spint1, Slpi, and Ido2 as putative AHRE motif-possessing canonical targets.
  In the cytoplasm, the AhR complex included src tyrosine kinase phosphorylates STAT3
  leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus STAT3 binds
  to a response element in the Il10 promotor, and thus inducing IL-10 production ().
  This is the most prominent non-canonical AhR-dependent pathway. If IL-10 is secreted,
  it exerts autocrine and paracrine anti-inflammatory effects, leading to the suppression
  of gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., Il1b, Tnfa, Il12a/b. Further,
  this study suggests the AhR-dependent expressional induction of key immune genes
  for Mϕ activation, such as Il12rb1, Fcgr1, Cd84, that do possess an AHRE motif and
  thus, are regulated by non-canonical or secondary mechanisms. Of note, from several
  expressional profiles it is anticipated that the transcriptional activation of type
  I (IFN-α, IFN-β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferons is regulated by AhR via so far
  unknown molecular mechanisms possibly including both canonical and non-canonical
  pathways. Gene expressional profiles and bioinformatic approaches suggest an autocrine/paracrine
  effect of secreted interferons partly explaining the here presented results. Solid
  lines ⟹ known mechanisms covered in the figure; dashed lines ⟹ known mechanisms
  not covered in the figure; dotted line ⟹ unkown mechanisms. Boxes indicate genes
  expressionally induced in the study.
