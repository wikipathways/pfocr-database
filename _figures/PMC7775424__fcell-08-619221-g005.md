caption: Hypothetical contribution of exRNA to virus infection and subsequent cardiovascular
  disease. Upon infection of the tissue (vascular endothelium) by (SARS-CoV-2) virus,
  DAMPS including exRNA are released from tissue cells (; ). Virus particles activate
  tissue and immune cells of the host to release inflammatory mediators, including
  exRNA, which in turn can induce vascular hyper-permeability in a VEGF-receptor-2-neuropilin-1
  (NRP1)-dependent manner (). This allows virus particles to further invade particular
  tissue sites to disseminate their infection potential, including the liberation
  of cytokines (; ). A major docking site for SARS-Cov-2 is the endothelial cell-associated
  metalloproteinase ACE2, whose processing, carried out by ADAM17, could be triggered
  by exRNA to allow virus entry (; ). Together, these mostly hypothetical exRNA-mediated
  processes not only could provoke a robust cytokine release, associated with hyper-inflammation
  and cardiovascular disease. In addition, exRNA as a pro-thrombotic cofactor can
  further induce the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, resulting in the thrombotic
  phenotype of COVID-19 patients. As a general antagonist or potential therapeutic
  agent, RNase1 may inhibit or prevent the multiple actions of the damaging exRNA,
  associated with viral infections and their adverse side effects. For details please
  see text.
