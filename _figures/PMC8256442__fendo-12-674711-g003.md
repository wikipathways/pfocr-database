caption: Proposed G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling pathways regulating
  ecdysteroidogenesis in the YO. MIH and limb autotomy factor - proecdysis (LAFpro)
  activate cyclic nucleotide/NO-dependent signaling via distinct receptors. It is
  hypothesized that LAFpro, secreted by secondary limb regenerates during early premolt,
  is an insulin-like peptide similar to dILP8 in Drosophila that binds to Lgr3. Cyclic
  phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity inhibits MIH and LAFprosignaling by hydrolyzing
  cAMP and cGMP to AMP and GMP, respectively. An unknown ligand, possibly serotonin
  or other biogenic amines (see Ca2+/Diacylglycerol/Protein Kinase C Signaling Section),
  binds a GPCR to activate the Ca2+/diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway.
  Both pathways converge on mTOR signaling, possibly by phosphorylation of tuberous
  sclerosis complex (TSC) by protein kinase G (PKG) to inhibit ecdysteroid synthesis
  or by phosphorylation of Akt by PKC to stimulate ecdysteroid synthesis (, , , ).
