  dysregulated, DAMP-promoted pathways in light of the exposome and AOP concepts.
  The figure illustrates the sequelae of key events proposed to leading to ARDS and
  SIRS, reflecting the adverse outcome in COVID-19. The promoted dysregulated pathways
  leading to COVID-19 starts with the sequelae of events (MIE → KE4→n) as described
  for the controlled pathway (Fig. ). However, instead of proceeding to homeostatic
  events, the DAMP-induced pathways now provoke “pathogenic” KEs key events resulting
  in ARDS and/or SIRS/sepsis. The triggering “aberrant” event is the fifth KE that
  refers to pulmonary hyperinflammation, as characterized by intrapulmonary emission
  of DAMPs in excessive, which may spread out systemically. The adverse outcomes refer
  to ARDS and/or SIRS/sepsis. AO adverse outcome, ARDS acute respiratory distress
  syndrome, DAMPs damage-associated molecular patterns, KE key event, KER key event
  relationship, MAMPs microbe-associated molecular patterns, MIE molecular initiating
  event, PRMs pattern recognition molecules, SIRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome.Source:
