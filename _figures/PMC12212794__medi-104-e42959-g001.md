caption: Summary of the causes of polycythemia in Saudi Arabia. High altitude and
  smoking induce hypoxia that triggers the production of erythropoietin which leads
  to an increase in RBCs mass. Neonatal polycythemia, neonates born in high-altitude
  areas, post transplants and genetic mutations of the JAK2 gene are also among the
  reported causes of polycythemia among Saudis. JAK-STAT signaling pathway, where
  cytokine binding activates JAK, leading to STAT activation, nuclear translocation,
  and gene expression. JAK2 mutations, such as V617F, cause persistent pathway activation,
  resulting in excessive red blood cell production and increased polycythemia risk.
