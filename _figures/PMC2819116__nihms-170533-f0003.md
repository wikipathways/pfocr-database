caption: 'Overview of chemotactic signalling in neutrophils. (a) Several signalling
  pathways could regulate neutrophil motility. Chemoattractants, such as f-Met-Leu-Phe
  (fMLP), trigger signalling by activating their specific G-protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs) and Gi proteins at the surface of neutrophils, leading to release of the
  Gβγ subunit, which in turn activates directly or indirectly numerous signalling
  pathways in neutrophils, several of which have been suggested to regulate neutrophil
  motility (dotted arrows). (b) Putative signalling pathway regulating chemoattractant-induced
  activation of Rho GTPases in neutrophils. The Gβγ subunit, freed from the activated
  heterotrimeric G protein, activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) and
  cytosolic tyrosine kinases. The combined actions of tyrosine kinases and the PI3Kγ
  lipid products, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and/or
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2], increase the activity of
  a specific GDP–GTP exchange factor (GEF; e.g. Vav) for the Rho GTPases. The activated
  GEF in turn activates the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 that ultimately transmit signals
  to the actin-polymerization machinery. Abbreviations: cPKC, classical protein kinase
  C; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; PLCβ, phospholipase
  C β.'
