caption: Model depicting how Shh promotes CGNP proliferation through combined effects
  on Gli1/2 and the mTOR pathway components eIF4E and S6K. Shh binding to Ptc leads
  to Smo activation, resulting in up-regulation of Gli and N-myc. eIF4E mRNA and protein
  are up-regulated, up-stream of the PP2A-B56γ subunit, which directs PP2A activity
  towards S6 kinase. Inactivation (dephosphorylation) of S6 kinase results in IRS1
  stabilization, which can also drive N-myc expression, thus creating a pro-proliferative
  feed-forward loop in CGNPs.
