caption: The nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc resides at the nexus of protein and lipid
  glycosylation. (A) Dynamic, nutrient-sensitive O-GlcNAc cycling is modulated by
  metabolite and enzyme availability. Glucose, acetyl-CoA, ATP, glutamine, and uridine
  are required for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, the ultimate product of the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP). OGT uses the nucleotide sugar to modify proteins, whereas
  OGA catalyzes the modification’s removal. hOGT and hOGA splice variants are depicted.
  OGT and OGA isoforms have unique subcellular distributions and interaction partners,
  including one another. The O-GlcNAcylation of ID protein domains is known to influence
  protein secondary structure. MTS, mitochondrial targeting sequence; PPO, phosphoinositide
  binding domain. (B) Although most cellular glucose (Glc) is metabolized by glycolysis,
  2–3% enters the HBP () and is phosphorylated and isomerized in two enzymatic steps
  to yield fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P; ; ). Next, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate-amidotransferase
  (GFAT) acts to convert fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P)
  in the HBP’s rate-limiting step (; ,). The installation of an acetyl group () is
  followed by a second isomerization by phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3), yielding GlcNAc-1-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-1-P; ). In the final step, UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase utilizes UTP and
  GlcNAc-1-phosphate to produce UDP-GlcNAc (). Importantly, along with other mechanisms
  of regulation, GFAT is sensitive to UDP-GlcNAc inhibition, thereby modulating the
  cellular UDP-GlcNAc available to glycosyltransferases (GlycoTs) at any given time
  within the cell (). Salvage pathways can also introduce glucosamine and GlcNAc to
  enter the HBP directly bypassing GFAT (; ). Cells can rapidly take up exogenous
  glucosamine via the glucose transporter, which can be fully processed to UDP-GlcNAc
  (). Cellular GlcNAc from lysosomal degradation or the degradation of nutritional
  constituents can be converted by GlcNAc kinase to GlcNAc-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P)
  and then converted to UDP-GlcNAc (). The diseases associated with deregulation of
  each HBP enzyme (left) are indicated on the right side of the figure, connected
  to the enzyme by a line. Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; GlcNAc-6-P, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate;
  GK, glucokinase; EMeg32, glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; NIDDM, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. (C) The activated nucleotide
  sugar UDP-GlcNAc is used by concentration-sensitive enzymes in the nucleus, cytoplasm,
  and on the plasma membrane to glycosylate substrates. Nucleotide sugar transporters
  actively transport UDP-GlcNAc into cellular organelles including the ER and Golgi.
  The relative cellular volumes of these organelles that differ in their permeability
  characteristics make estimates of cytoplasmic and nuclear concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc
  complicated. The relative abundance of O-GlcNAc is roughly inversely related to
  the abundance of more complex glycans.
