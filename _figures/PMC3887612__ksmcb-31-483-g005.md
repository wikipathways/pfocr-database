caption: A proposed model for the tau signaling cascade in LPA induced neurite retraction
  in differentiated Neuro2a cells. LPA increased tau phosphorylation, which was followed
  by activation of the GSK-3β signaling pathway. The activated GSK-3β and PKA signaling
  pathway mediated the hyperphosphorylation of tau, which subsequently resulted in
  differentiated Neuro2a cell neurite retraction.
