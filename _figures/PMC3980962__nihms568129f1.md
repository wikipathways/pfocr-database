caption: A model representing our current understanding of the maintenance of the
  pluripotent state in mouse pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors OCT4,
  SOX2 and NANOG (commonly referred to as OSN) form an autoregulated core that upregulates
  other pluripotency factors, as well as signalling pathways of ectoderm or mesendoderm
  fates and the pro-differentiation MAPK1 pathway. At the same time, OSN factors repress
  lineage-specific programmes (in concert with Polycomb group (PcG) chromatin regulators).
  When cultured in the presence of LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor; which acts through
  STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)) and BMP4 (bone morphogenetic
  protein 4; which acts through ID (inhibitor of differentiation) and SMAD1), MAPK1-enabled
  differentiation is blocked in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Perturbations to
  the pluripotency network are likely to have distinct functional consequences for
  in vitro differentiation depending on which part of the network is affected. Disruptions
  to the differentiation signalling cascade infrastructures (red boxes) are more likely
  to be apparent at the expression level in the pluripotent state, whereas disruptions
  to either lineage commitment and differentiation programmes or genetic programmes
  responsible for rapidly repressing the pluripotency network upon differentiation
  (blue boxes) are more likely to remain silent until directed to differentiate. FGF,
  fibroblast growth factor; MEP, mesendodermal progenitor; miR, micro RNA; EP, ectodermal
  progenitor; OLIG2, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2; OTX1, orthodenticle homolog
  1; RBL2, retinoblastoma-like 2; TBX3, T box 3; ZIC2, zinc-finger protein of the
  cerebellum 2.
