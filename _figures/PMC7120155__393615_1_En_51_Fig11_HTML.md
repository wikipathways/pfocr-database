caption: Antifibrosis therapy. The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of
  natural products against fibrosis. a TGF-b exerts a profibrotic effect through Smad-dependent
  [Target (1)] and Smad-independent pathways [Target (2)]. In the Smad-dependent pathway,
  TGF-b1 directly phosphorylates and activates the downstream mediator Smad2 and Smad3
  through TGF-b receptor I, and then Smad2 and Smad3 bind Smad4, which forms a complex
  that moves into the nucleus and initiates gene transcription. Smad7, transcribed
  by Smad3, is a negative regulator of TGF-b/Smad signaling, and the imbalance between
  Smad3 and Smad7 contributes to fibrosis. PI3K, ERK, and p38 MAPK are downstream
  mediators of the Smad-independent TGF-b pathway. PPARg [Target (3)] could inhibit
  TGF-b to reduce fibrosis, while CTGF [Target (4)], a matricellular protein, contributes
  to wound healing and virtually all fibrotic pathology. Additionally, Gas6 contributes
  to fibrosis through the TAM receptor, which further activates the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Similarly, LPA triggers fibrosis through the LPA1 receptor [Target (5)] that stimulates
  b-catenin to induce fibrogenesis. The activation of the hedgehog pathway [Target
  (6)] induces the transcriptional activity of Gli to express target genes, which
  have an important role in interstitial fibrosis, undergoing myofibroblast transformation
  and proliferation. IL pathway [Target (7)] stimulates NF-kB [Target (8)] to activate
  TGF-b to induce fibrogenesis, while Nrf2 [Target (9)] antagonizes NF-kB activity
  to protect against fibrosis. b The chemical structures of isolated compounds and
  their therapeutic targets are presented. CTGF, connective tissue growth factor;
  IL, interleukin; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RI, transforming
  growth factor-b receptor I; RII, transforming growth factor-b receptor II; SARA,

  TCF, T-cell factor; TGF, transforming growth factor. (Reprinted from Chen et al.
