caption: The PI3K/Akt non-Smad pathway. TGF-β can activate PI3K and Akt, possibly
  by inducing a physical interaction between the p85 subunit of PI3K and the receptors.
  The activated PI3K/Akt pathway then controls translational responses through mTOR/S6K,
  which collaborates with Smad-mediated transcriptional responses during EMT. In the
  growth arrest response, TGF-β may inhibit S6K by inducing an interaction between
  the Bα subunit of PP2A and the receptors. Akt is also capable of antagonizing TGF-β-induced
  apoptosis and growth arrest by sequestering Smad3 in the cytoplasm and by inhibiting
  the activity of FoxO transcription factor.
