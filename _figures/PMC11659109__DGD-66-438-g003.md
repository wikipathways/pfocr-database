caption: Glucose metabolism in cardiac regeneration. Glucose is taken up into cells
  through glucose transporters (Gluts), which are more strongly expressed in the myocardium
  during the fetal period than postnatally. Glucose is used in the glycolytic system,
  which branches into the nucleic acid synthesis pathway, known as the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and the Polyol pathway. Pkm2, which acts downstream in the glycolytic
  pathway, links the PPP to angiogenesis and enhances proliferative potential. Interventions
  such as the overexpression of Glut1, inhibition of Pkm2, or its downstream enzymes
  Pdk and others, modulate glucose and mitochondrial metabolism and induce cardiac
  growth and regeneration. Images are created using BioRender.com
