caption: Extracellular and intracellular triggers of inflammation in CF airways cells.
  Pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses ①, as well as increased levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, protease and ROS chronically present in CF airways ② lead to a constant
  stimulation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, resulting in NF-κB/IκB complex dissociation
  and NF-κB activation ③. NF-κB activation results in increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF, IL-8, IL-17 ④, leading to increased neutrophil influx ⑤,
  which contributes to the vicious inflammatory circle by releasing high amounts of
  oxidants, proteases and pro-inflammatory cytokines ⑥. Retention of ΔF508CFTR in
  the endoplasmic reticulum of airway epithelial cells induces unfolded protein response
  (UPR) ⑦, cell stress, NF-κB constitutive activation ⑧ and increased pro-inflammatory
  cytokines production ④, perpetuating the inflammatory response in the airways. In
  CF cells, the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by mitochondria
  ⑨, as well as increased intracellular ceramide levels ⑩ contribute to NF-κB activation
  ③ and sustained inflammation, as well as cell apoptosis ⑪.
