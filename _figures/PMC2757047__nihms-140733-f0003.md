caption: The Cip/Kip family of CKIs regulate the actin cytoskeleton during neuronal
  migration by inhibiting the Rho signaling pathway. While p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 are
  important for neuronal migration, a role for p21Cip1 has not been reported. Cdk5
  regulates the stability of p27Kip1, which in turn promotes cofilin phosphorylation.
  Whether p57Kip2 and p21Cip1 promote neuronal migration through a similar mechanism
  remains unclear. In the nucleus, Rb, and possibly E2F3, is essential for the expression
  of genes implicated in neuronal migration.
