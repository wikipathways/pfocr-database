caption: Schematic of the biologically induced snowball initiation scenarios. The
  right side represents the sulfate reduction plus pyrite formation pathway, which
  increases alkalinity and therefore reduces pCO2; the left side represents the iron
  reduction path, which leads to the deposition of siderite and reduction in the size
  of the DIC pool, and therefore, again, to the reduction of pCO2. Note the shoaling
  of the (dashed blue) interface between the anoxic and oxic ocean depth ranges, in
  response to the enhanced export production, potentially leading to a reduction of
  both oxygenic production and aerobic remineralization. These scenarios are demonstrated
  using a single box model described in the text.
