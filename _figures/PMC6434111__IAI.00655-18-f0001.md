caption: '(A) l-Arginine de novo synthesis pathways. Reactions 1 to 7 take place in
  small intestinal enterocytes, reactions 8 and 9 take place in proximal tubular cells
  of the kidney, and reaction 10 takes place in microvascular endothelial cells in
  many organs of the body. The definitions of steps 1 to 10 are as follows: 1, glutaminase;
  2, pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthetase; 3, pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthetase (a
  bifunctional enzyme); 4, nonenzymatic reaction (equilibrium favors pyrroline-5-carboxylase):
  5, proline oxidase; 6, ornithine aminotransferase; 7, ornithine carbamoyltransferase;
  8 argininosuccinate synthetase; 9, argininosuccinate lyase; 10, nitric oxide synthase.

  nor a net gain of amino acids. The de novo synthesis of arginine occurs from the
  metabolism of glutamine in the gut and kidney, and arginine is also derived from
  proteolysis and the diet. Arginine is disposed of through the synthesis of proteins,
  proline, creatine, agmatine, and polyamines, as well as oxidation to carbon dioxide
  and water (, ). The action on arginine by arginase can occur within the liver as
  part of the urea cycle or extrahepatically, in many cell types, as part of arginine
  oxidative degradation. Arginine succinate synthetase and arginine-succinate lyase
