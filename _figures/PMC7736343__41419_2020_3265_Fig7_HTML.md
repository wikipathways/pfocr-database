caption: When TFEB was activated and transported into the nuclear in cells, VMP1 transcript
  was upregulated and VMP1-miR-21 transcript was down-regulated, Meanwhile, pri-miR-21
  transcript was also reduced due to the binding of transcription factors to pri-miR-21
  promoter were blocked by TFEB-induced high transcriptional activation of VMP1, such
  as STAT3 (dashed lines). When VMP1 transcription was inhibited by TFEB phosphorylation,
  both VMP1-miR-21 and pri-miR-21 transcripts were increased. Subsequently, the high
  expression of miR-21 increased phosphorylation of AKT by inhibiting PTEN, and then
  phosphorylated AKT promoted phosphorylation of TFEB and repressed its nuclear translocation,
  leading to VMP1 transcription was further inhibited and miR-21 transcription was
  further increased (solid lines).
