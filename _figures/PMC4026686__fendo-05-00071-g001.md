caption: Illustration of changes in cAMP–pCREB and MAPK–SRE signaling pathways induced
  by agonist actions at NTR1–D2R heterodimers and at NTR1 receptor homodimers and
  D2 receptor homodimers. NT produces via an antagonistic allosteric NTR1–D2 receptor–receptor
  interaction a reduction in the D2R agonist-induced activation of Gi/o leading to
  a marked reduction of activity in the cAMP–pCREB pathway. Instead, β-arrestin-mediated
  internalization and signaling may be favored due to a biased modulation of the D2R
  protomer via the allosteric receptor–receptor interaction in the heterodimer (see
  left part). The coagonist treatment also results in a facilitatory interaction in
  the activation of the MAPK–SRE pathway, which may take place in this signaling pathway
  at the level of PKC. Thus, the NTR1 agonist can activate the NTR1 protomer, which
  activates the MAPK–SRE pathway via Gq/11–PLC–PKC. The D2R agonist can target the
  D2R protomer and produce its activation of the MAPK–SRE pathway via several mechanisms,
  including β-arrestin–PI3k–PKC or β-arrestin–Scr–PKC (see left part). It should also
  be noted that this facilitatory interaction can also involve the D2R receptor homodimers
  and the NTR1 receptor homodimers (see right part). However, the facilitatory interaction
  may become stronger in the NTR1–D2R heteromer signaling since the NT protomer-induced
  antagonism of D2R protomer-mediated Gi/o signaling may favor the switch toward β-arrestin
  recruitment and signaling.
