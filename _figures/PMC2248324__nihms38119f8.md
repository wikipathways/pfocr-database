caption: Schematic diagram of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and
  stimulating effects of peroxynitrite. MAPKs are activated by a dual phosphorylation
  at a specific tripeptide motif, as indicated on the left, mediated by a conserved
  protein kinase cascade, involving MAPK kinases (MAPKK or MKK) and MAPK kinase kinases
  (MAPKKK or MKKK). The activation of the upstream MKKK is mediated by various cell
  surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTK), such as the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGFR), which activate
  several small G proteins, such as Ras, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Three groups of MAPKs
  exist in mammalian cells, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase
  (ERK), p38 MAPK, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), whose upstream signaling
  intermediates include raf-1 and MKK1–2 (ERK pathway), MLK/Ask-1 (mixed lineage kinase/apoptosis-signal
  regulating kinase-1) and MEK 3–6 (p38), and MLK-1/Ask-1 and MKK 4–7 (JNK). Downstream
  targets of MAPKs are transcription factors, enzymes, and various proteins, which
  regulate cell growth, apoptosis, as well as inflammation. The Western blots at the
  bottom show the activation pattern of the three MAPKs, evidenced by their phosphorylation,
  induced in the cardiomyoblast cell line H9C2 by treatment with increasing concentrations
  of peroxynitrite. [Adapted from Pesse et al. ().]
