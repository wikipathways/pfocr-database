caption: 'The complex interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
  (SARS-CoV-2), nicotine and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. SARS-CoV-2
  binds to the its functional receptor on alveolar epithelial cells, that is angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE)2. This binding results in viral endocytosis and replication, along
  with ACE2 downregulation. Nicotine might interact with RAAS in multiple ways: 1)
  by upregulating angiotensin II type I receptor, and thus by inducing angiotensin
  II deleterious effects; and 2) by downregulating ACE2, and thus reducing the number
  of potential virus entries or by upregulating ACE2, via nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor α7 subunit (α7-nAChR). The latter signalling pathway may also result in
  the downregulation of cytokine production by the macrophages [, ]. AT1R: angiotensin
  II type I receptor; TNF: tumour necrosis factor; IL: interleukin.'
