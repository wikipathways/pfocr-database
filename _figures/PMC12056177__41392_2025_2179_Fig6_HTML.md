caption: MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK signaling pathway. In a typical MAPK cascade, MAP3K activates
  MAP2K (also known as MKK, MEK) by phosphorylating two conserved Ser/Thr residues
  in the activation loop, and the MAP2Ks directly phosphorylate MAPKs. The activation
  of MAPK cascades is initiated by various extracellular stimuli, including growth
  factors, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, stress, and cytokines. Activated
  Ras recruits and activates Raf, which phosphorylates and activates downstream MEK1/2.
  MEK1/2 then phosphorylates ERK1/2, which translocates to the nucleus and regulates
  gene transcription. Stress signals (e.g., reactive oxygen species or osmotic stress)
  and cytokines activate distinct MAPKKKs, leading to the phosphorylation of different
  MAPKKs. MKK4/7 phosphorylates and activates JNK/p38 MAPK, while MKK3/6 phosphorylates
  p38 MAPK. The hierarchical organization of the MAPK pathways ensures signal specificity,
  playing a critical role in cell apoptosis, cell survival, and other cellular events.
