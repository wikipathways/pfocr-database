caption: Diagram of the putative regulatory mechanisms of the FNM process. External
  signals are sensed by FG and may trigger the FNM process. The DEGs, which are found
  in comparison between developing and abortive ovules, are involved in phytohormone
  pathways and the cell cycle process. The phytohormone pathway contains the following
  genes involved in auxin biosynthesis (YUC and ASA), auxin signal transduction (AUX1,
  ARF, AUX/IAA and SAUR), cytokinin degradation (CKX) and signal transduction (CER1/AHK,
  AHP and A-ARR), ABA biosynthesis (NCED) and signal transduction (PYR/PYL and ABF).
  The gene expression may also regulate the cell cycle process by up- or down-regulated
  key genes, such as genes encoding CDKB, ICK1, APC/C and MCM proteins. The line arrow
  indicates direct interaction between subjects. The dot line arrow suggests the indirect
  influence or abbreviated multi-step between two subjects. ABF, ABA responsive element
  binding factor; AHK, Arabidopsis histidine kinase; AHP, Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer
  protein; ARF, auxin response factor; AUX1, AUXIN1; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome;
  ASA, anthranilate synthase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKX, cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases;
  CRE1, cytokinin response 1; CYC, cyclin; ICK, CDK inhibitory protein; MCM, minichrome
  maintenance; NCED, 9-cis-Epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; PYL, PYR1-Like protein; PYR,
  pyrabactin resistance 1 protein; SAUR, small auxin-up RNA; YUC, YUCCA.
