caption: IBD is characterized by mucosal adherent bacteria and the induction of continuous
  and overshooting immune responses against normally commensal gut microbiota. Different
  defects in the intestinal barrier integrity, which affect the innate immune system,
  are linked to specific subgroups of IBD. Small intestinal CD is associated with
  defects in Paneth cell antimicrobial defense, which includes reduced α-defensin
  expression and Impairments in the Wnt pathway. In the colon, Crohn's disease is
  characterized by reduced inducability of HBD2 as well as diminished constitutive
  expression of HBD1 and the HBD1 reducing, and thereby activating thioredoxin. UC
  on the other hand shows an impaired inflammation associated induction of factors,
  which are important for goblet cell differenciation, which affects the mucus layer
  effectiveness. Such defects in the first line of mucosal defense can result in mucosal
  adherent bacteria as well as microbial translocations, which then promote ongoing
  inflammatory and adaptive immune responses.
