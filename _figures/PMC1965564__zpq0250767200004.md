caption: The ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway as studied in isocitrate lyase-negative R. sphaeroides.
  Crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase was identified as the key enzyme of the herein-described
  acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway distinct from the glyoxylate cycle. Mutations in
  the genes encoding β-ketothiolase and mesaconyl-CoA hydratase were previously shown
  to result in an acetate-minus phenotype (). The bifunctional β-methylmalyl-CoA/malyl-CoA
  lyase catalyses the cleavage of β-methylmalyl-CoA as well as the condensation of
  acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate to form malyl-CoA (). Dotted lines indicate steps that
  have not been elucidated so far. Exogenous CO2 is not required for growth with acetate
  as sole carbon source, indicating that the two molecules of CO2 fixed in the ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway are derived from the oxidation of acetyl-CoA.
