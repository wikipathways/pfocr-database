caption: Schematic diagram of mechanism of action of linaclotide‐mediated signaling
  pathway. Proposed mechanism of action of the guanylate cyclase‐C (GC‐C) agonist
  linaclotide, through activation of the GC‐C/cyclic guanosine‐3′,5′‐monophosphate
  (cGMP) pathway, stimulating fluid secretion in the intestinal lumen. (1) Linaclotide
  binds to and activates GC‐C, expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial
  cells. (2) Activation of GC‐C results in hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
  and increased production of intracellular cGMP. (3) Increased cGMP concentrations
  activate cGMP‐dependent protein kinase, type 2 (PKG‐II), leading to phosphorylation
  and activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
  ion channel, stimulating the secretion of chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3−)
  ions in the lumen. (4) CFTR‐mediated secretion of Cl− and HCO3− ions is accompanied
  by the passive efflux of sodium (Na+) ions and water (H2O), following the electronegative
  osmotic gradient. Due to its minor role in linaclotide‐stimulated GC‐C/cGMP‐dependent
  fluid secretion, PKA cross‐activation is not shown.
