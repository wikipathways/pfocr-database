caption: Potentially drug targetable pathways associated with clear cell RCC include
  chromatin remodeling and altered tumor metabolism. A, mutations in several chromatin
  remodeling genes such as PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1 are common in clear cell RCC and
  result in altered transcription profiles due to the specific effects of loss of
  each of these genes. As knowledge of these pathways increases, potential therapies
  could target downstream transcriptional gain of function or loss of function events.
  B, higher grade, high stage low survival clear cell tumors are associated with a
  metabolic shift consistent with a suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and a
  subsequent dependence upon glycolysis for energy. This would result in a dependence
  on glucose for ATP and for the conversion of pyruvate to lactate for excretion while
  suppressing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to aid fatty acid production and
  growth. The enzymes and transporters involved in these processes, such as Hexokinase
  2 (HK2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and glucose transporters 1/4 (GLUT1/4),
  are potential targets (highlighted in red). Additionally, the increased need for
  fatty acids for growth requires an alternative carbon metabolite to enter the citric
  acid cycle to produce the necessary citrate. These tumors would increase their glutamine
  uptake and conversion to glutamate for entry into the Krebs cycle and both the glutaminase
  (GLS) and fatty acid synthesis enzymes, such as ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) and Fatty acid synthase (FAS), are potential therapeutic targets.
  Due to the suppression of the normal flow in the citric acid cycle the alternative
  reductive carboxylation pathway in used to convert α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to citrate
  via the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes that provide further potential targets.
