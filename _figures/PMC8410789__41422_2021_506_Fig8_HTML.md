caption: Under acidic environment, the metabolic enzyme MDH1 promiscuously catalyzes
  the conversion of α-KG to L-2HG, which then boosts ROS level. This signal is responded
  by the plasma membrane-localized death receptor DR6 by inducing the oxidation of
  DR6. Oxidized DR6 internalizes into the cytosol, and then recruits both pro-caspase-8
  and GSDMC to the DR6 receptosome, in which active caspase-8 cleaves GSDMC, thereby
  inducing pyroptosis. This story demonstrates a novel pathway from ROS-initiated
  DR6 endocytosis to caspase-8-cleaved GSDMC for pyroptosis induction.
