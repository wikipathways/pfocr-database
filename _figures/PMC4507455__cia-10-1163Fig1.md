caption: 'The process of Aβ aggregation.Notes: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is
  a transmembrane protein. APP processing includes non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic
  pathways. Non-amyloidogenic pathway (left): APP is cleaved by α-secretase in the
  middle of Aβ with production soluble APPα (sAPPα) and C-terminal fragment α (CTFα).
  Then CTFα is hydrolyzed by γ-secretase to generate APP intracellular domain (AICD).
  Amyloidogenic pathway (right): APP is cleaved by β-secretase resulting in N-terminal
  soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) leaving the C-terminal fragment β (CTFβ) which is hydrolyzed
  by γ-secretase to yield Aβ and AICD. Presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective
  1 (APH-1) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2) are the parts of γ-secretase. PSEN mutation
  might increase γ-secretase activity to cause plaque forming.Abbreviations: AICD,
  APP intracellular domain; APP, amyloid precursor protein; APH-1, anterior pharynx-defective
  1; CTFα, C-terminal fragment α; CTFβ, C-terminal fragment β; sAPP, soluble APP;
  PEN-2, presenilin enhancer 2.'
