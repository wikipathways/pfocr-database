caption: Hypothetical model of anti-HBV mechanism of TLR3 signaling of HSCs. Stimulation
  of HSCs with PolyI:C (dsRNA) activates TLR3 signal pathway, which facilitates phosphorylation
  and translocation of IRF3 and IRF7, initiating the production of IFN-β and IFN-λ.
  IFN-β and IFN-λ released from HSCs could binds to their corresponding receptors
  in hepatocytes and activate STAT signal pathway, inducing anti-HBV IFN-stimulate
  genes (ISGs), which can inhibit HBV replication in hepatocytes.
