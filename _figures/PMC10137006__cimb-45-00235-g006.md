caption: Summary of the pathways involved in the development of cervical cancer. The
  figure illustrates the upregulated (pink region) and downregulated pathways (green
  region) involved in cervical carcinogenesis, from normal cervix to SIL and SCC.
  The main signaling events mediated by HDAC Class III, necroptosis, and viral carcinogenesis
  are downregulated in the transformation from the normal cervix to SIL, which then
  become upregulated during the progression from SIL to SCC. The same pathways are
  also found to be upregulated in SCC compared to normal cervix, suggesting that their
  activation pathways trigger cancer formation. In contrast, the PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway and integrins in angiogenesis are downregulated in the transition from normal
  cervix to SIL, as well as in SCC compared to normal cervix, which are involved in
  cell proliferation, growth and metastasis.
