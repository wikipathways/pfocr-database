caption: Construction of the altered metabolic state used gene expression data to
  constrain and alter the reference fluxes obtained from a metabolic network compatible
  with the reference condition. The example network contained six metabolites (A–F),
  two uptake reactions, six enzymatic reactions, and one biomass reaction. In the
  reference condition, the biomass function contained equal amounts of metabolites
  E and F, set to 1.0 millimoles per gram dry weight of the organism (mmol/gDW), and
  the uptake rates for the metabolites A and B were each assigned an upper limit of
  2.0 mmol/(h·gDW). In Step I, we obtained the minimum and maximum fluxes under the
  optimal biomass production rate via flux variability analysis and calculated the
  average normalized flux for the reference metabolic network. In Step II, the gene
  expression ratios were mapped to their corresponding reactions. In Step III, we
  initially set constraints for reactions that were associated with altered gene expression
  values. These constraints were based on the normalized reference network with the
  biomass production rate set to one and resulted in increased normalized fluxes through
  reactions related to up-regulated genes (reactions A→B and D→F) and decreased fluxes
  related to down-regulated genes (reaction C→D). Because biological activities other
  than gene transcription can influence reaction fluxes, we introduced a set of non-negative
  slack variables (L1, L2, and L3) to account for possible violations of the constraints.
  In Step IV, we further performed a number of optimizations subject to the constraints
  from the previous step and obtained a new minimum and maximum normalized flux for
  each reaction. We first minimized the overall violation of the developed constraints
  in the form of the sum of the slack variables (highest priority). We then minimized
  the modifications in the biomass objective function and those in the upper limits
  of metabolite uptakes (medium priority), and, last, we minimized and maximized each
  reaction flux (lowest priority). Finally, in Step V, we constructed the new metabolic
  state by calculating the new average normalized flux for each reaction as the mean
  of its new minimum and maximum fluxes. This metabolic state was representative of
  the new condition and in this case was associated with altered uptake rates, pathway
  preferences, and an altered biomass composition.
