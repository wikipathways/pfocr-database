caption: Schematic representation of host immune response induced by multidrug-resistant
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) in endophthalmitis. MDR-PA triggers an initial response
  which leads to higher infiltration of leukocytes and macrophages in the vitreous
  cavity, followed by release of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-1α, TNF-α, IL-18), chemokines
  (CXCL-5, CCL-6), MPO, granzyme, and MMPs. It is beneficial for the host when the
  aforementioned cytokines are produced in appropriate amounts, but toxic when produced
  in a deregulated fashion. Transcriptome analysis revealed that pathways like NF-κβ,
  MAPK, TNF signaling, JAK-STAT, and complement cascade are among the top enriched
  pathways. IL-1β and TNF-α promote TRAF1–TRAF6–NF-κβ pathway, while IL-6 promotes
  STAT-6-JAK/STAT pathway which in turn can modulate the immune response. NF-κβ pathway
  further promotes the recruitment of immune cells and cytokines. TNF-receptor proteins
  are known to activate p38 and its downstream target MAPK kinase-activated kinase-2
  (MK2). MDR-PA also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and its main effector caspase
  1, leading to the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18. It also activates TLR4-dependent
  caspase-4, leading to pyroptosis. In the presence of caspase-1, caspase-8 acts as
  a positive modulator of the NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 signaling cascades that drive
  both IL-1β production and pyroptotic death. All together, these pathways again contribute
  to the cytokine/chemokine storm by releasing massive amounts of proinflammatory
  cytokines which might be the reason behind the collateral damage. Rapid and excessive
  production of these molecules compared with the endophthalmitis caused by the antibiotic
  susceptible strain, necessitates the usage of targeted anti-inflammatory agents
  along with antibiotics to control and reduce the bystander damage to the retina.
