caption: Proposed metabolic activation pathway of GS-6620. The enzymes involved in
  the pathway are based on the results shown in . The primary intracellular activation
  pathway was proposed to proceed from GS-6620 to GS-465124, to metabolite X, and
  to GS-558272. The formation of metabolite B was not observed in our biochemical
  assays.
