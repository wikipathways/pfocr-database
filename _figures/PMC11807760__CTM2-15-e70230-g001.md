caption: Development of paclitaxel‐related drugs from green manufacture to oxetane
  motif utilisation and taxane derivatives discovery. (A) Elucidation of biological
  synthesis pathway promotes sustainable paclitaxel production via heterologous expression
  in chassis such as plants, yeast and bacteria. (B) Catalytic versatility of enzymes,
  as exemplified by Taxane Oxetanase (TOT) and Taxadiene 5α‐hydroxylase (T5αH), and
  the substrate promiscuity, as demonstrated by diverse taxane ring systems where
  nomenclature reflects the number of carbons in the taxane skeleton rings (e.g.,
  a 6/8/6 ring system indicates a skeleton composed of three rings with 6, 8 and 6
  carbon atoms, respectively), jointly facilitate the discovery of novel taxane derivatives.
  (C) Oxetane motif plays a crucial role in creating novel drug candidates with diverse
  properties and potential therapeutic applications. (1) geranylgeranyl diphosphate,
