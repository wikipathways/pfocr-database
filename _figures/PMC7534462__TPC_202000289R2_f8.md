caption: OsCCA1 Integrates the Sugar Response and Expression of OsTB1, D10, D14, and
  IPA1 to Regulate Tillering and Panicle Development.OsCCA1 positively regulates expression
  of OsTB1, D10, D14, and IPA1. Boxed region indicates SL pathway related genes and
  their actions, leading to negative regulation of tiller-bud development (via OsTB1,
  D14, and IPA1) and positive regulation of panicle development (via IPA1; ; ). D10
  and D14 encode SL biosynthesis and receptor proteins, respectively. Perception of
  SL (blue circle) by D14 leads to degradation of D53, which relieves the repression
  of transcriptional activation of IPA1 by D53. OsCCA1 may also participate in SL
  signaling through OsTB1. In roots and tiller buds, photosynthetic sugars can serve
  as a negative regulator to repress OsCCA1 expression, balancing tiller-bud and panicle
  development. OsPRR1 negatively regulates the expression of OsCCA1 to mediate rice
  plant architecture. Solid and dashed lines indicate the steps with experimental
  evidence from this study and previous reports, respectively. Arrows and stops show
  positive and negative regulation, respectively. In the rice plant, photosynthetic
  sugars (red hexagon) produced in leaves are transported (dashed arrows) into roots,
  tiller buds, and panicles. Note that other pathways such as auxin, cytokinin, and
  brassinosteroid can also regulate tiller-bud outgrowth.
