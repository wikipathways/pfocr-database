caption: G2/M DNA damage check point signaling pathway was regulated by vancomycin
  in HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells were treated with 50 μg/mL vancomycin for 24 h and the
  protein samples were subject to quantitative proteomic analysis. Green indicates
  a down-regulation. The intensity of greencolor indicates the degree of down-regulation.
  Solid arrow indicates direct interaction.
