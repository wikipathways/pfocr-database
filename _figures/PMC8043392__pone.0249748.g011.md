caption: A working model on how Wnt gene expression coincides with regenerative processes
  in the distal injured rat nerve. Red illustrates up-regulation. A, shows (early)
  denervated Schwann cells (bottom) as found in the injured distal peripheral nerve
  from 3-5d p.i. Schwann cells de-differentiate and produce Wnt4 and Wnt5b for autocrine
  and paracrine signalling, and possibly signal to arriving growth cones (top). B,
  shows recently regrown axons (top) at 14–28d p.i. together with Schwann cells (bottom)
  of the injured nerve. Schwann cells produce Wnt4 and Wnt5b to signal towards regenerating
  axons that have up-regulated multiple Wnt receptors including Ryk. Wnt5b and Wnt5
  also mediate Schwann cell autocrine signalling, at 14d p.i. through altered Wnt
  receptor availability initiates differentiation and re-myelination due to activation
  of the β-catenin pathway as demonstrated by Axin2 up- regulation. C, exhibits the
  late regenerative response at 28–90d p.i., with regrown axons (top) and a re-myelinating
  Schwann cell (bottom). Re- myelinating Schwann cells still produce Wnt4 and Wnt5b
  but axons have returned their Wnt receptor expression to baseline. Schwann cells
  signal with Wnt ligands in an autocrine fashion to stimulate the β-catenin pathway
  as indicated by Axin2 up-regulation.
