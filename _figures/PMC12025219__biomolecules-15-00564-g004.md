caption: Changes in skeletal cells caused by cold environment. Exposure to the cold
  environment causes spindle-like and fibroblast-like changes in BMSCs and reduces
  their proliferation. However, the cold environment also promotes osteogenic differentiation
  of BMSCs through the p38 MAPK pathway. Runx2 is significantly inhibited in the cold.
  Low temperature exposure leads to perturbation of the NHOst cytoskeleton and affects
  the mitochondrial activity of NHOst. This may be related to the fact that the cold
  shock protein RBM3 is increased during hypothermia. Overexpression of RBM3 increases
  the expression of osteogenic genes, such as Runx2 and OCN, and promotes the phosphorylation
  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, promoting OB production.
  In addition, cold stimulation affects OBs by promoting the production of BAT, which
  upregulates the levels of ALP, OCN, leptin, and Runx2 and promotes osteogenic differentiation.
  Osteocytes are highly differentiated cells derived from OBs. Exposure to cold leads
  to apoptosis of OBs, and dead OBs exhibit higher RANKL expression in neighbouring
  cells. Cold decreases E11/podoplanin, resulting in altered dendritic differentiation
  of osteoblasts in the skeletal system of rats. Exposure to a cold environment increases
  microvascular permeability and VEGF levels, leading to plasma leakage of large proteins
  and endothelial damage. In patients with osteonecrosis, a decrease in ECs due to
  the cold environment leads to a decrease in blood supply and death of OCs. OC surface,
  OC number, and percentage of eroded surface are significantly increased in the cold
  environment. Cold stress promotes free radical production in fresh bone marrow cells,
  which enhances RANKL expression and contributes to OC formation. In addition, BAT
  secretes the cytokine IL-6, which indirectly promotes the formation of OCs and bone
  resorption by promoting RANKL expression
