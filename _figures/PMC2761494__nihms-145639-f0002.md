caption: Ligation of HLA class I molecules by anti-HLA antibodies activates signaling
  cascades that result in EC survival and proliferation. Class I mediated EC survival
  and proliferation involves the activation of two distinct signaling pathways depending
  upon the antibody concentration. Ligation of class I molecules with high titer antibodies
  stimulates intracellular signals that synergize with FGF receptors to stimulate
  cell proliferation via the MAPK signaling pathway. Ligation of class I molecules
  with low titer antibodies stimulates cell survival and cell proliferation through
  phosphorylation of Src, FAK and paxillin followed by downstream activation of mTORC1
  and mTORC2. Class I ligation leads to the activation of several downstream targets
  of mTORC1 signaling including S6K at Thr389, S6RP at Ser235/236, and 4E-BP1 at Thr37/46
  and increases cell proliferation. Class I mediated activation of mTORC2 promotes
  cell survival by activating Akt at Ser473 and upregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression.
