caption: OXPHOS Inhibitors. Figure 4 illustrates the electron transport chain, which
  involves the transfer of electrons through a series of oxidoreduction reactions
  occurring in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This metabolic pathway, known as
  OXPHOS, generates a proton gradient as electrons flow through complex I (I), complex
  II (II), Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), complex III (III), cytochrome c (Cyt C), and complex
  IV (IV), with O2 serving as the terminal electron acceptor. The electron transport
  chain is coupled with ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP to ATP by utilizing
  the proton gradient. Currently studied OXPHOS inhibitors targeting each complex
  are highlighted in red boxes. Figure created with BioRender.com
