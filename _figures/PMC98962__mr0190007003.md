caption: Diagram of the biosynthetic pathway of cell wall assembly. As discussed in
  the text, the generation of cell wall precursors begins in the cytoplasm, resulting
  in the synthesis of UDP-MurNAc–l-Ala–d-iGlu–l-Lys–d-Ala–d-Ala (Park’s nucleotide).
  The peptidoglycan precursor subunit is transferred to a lipid carrier in the membrane
  to generate lipid I. After further modification, the lipid-anchored peptidoglycan
  precursor is translocated to the extracellular face of the cytoplasmic membrane.
  The peptidoglycan precursor is subsequently incorporated into the cell wall by transpeptidation
  and transglycosylation reactions with the concomitant displacement of the lipid
  carrier. The terminal d-alanine of the wall pentapeptide is subject to substitution
  by cross-linking to other wall subunits or can be removed by the action of a d-alanyl–d-alanine
  carboxypeptidase. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; MN-GN, MurNAc-GlcNAc.
