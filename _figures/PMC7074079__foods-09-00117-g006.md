caption: Metabolic pathway visualization and relative metabolite abundance for soybeans
  fermented by Aspergillus oryzae (AO) or Bacillus subtilis (BS) after water extraction
  at 55 °C. Fold changes from AO to BS were converted into log2FC (BS/AO) values ranging
  from −5.50 to 5.50. Positive log2FC values imply higher levels in BS-fermented soybeans
  and are shown in red, while negative log2FC values imply higher levels in AO-fermented
  soybeans and are shown in green. Extremely significant differences between AO and
  BS groups were identified by the t-test (* p < 0.0001).
