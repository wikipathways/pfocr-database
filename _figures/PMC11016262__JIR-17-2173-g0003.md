caption: Immune cells along the gut-lung axis. Immune cells such as ILC2s, ILC3s and
  Th17 could transfer from the intestine to the lungs and participate in the inflammatory
  responses. The migration of immune cells is expedited by intestinal bacteria and
  their metabolites via IL-33 and IL-25; Intestinal bacteria could change the activity
  of T lymphocyte subsets through NF-κB and STING signaling pathways; L-selectin expressed
  by naive T cells binds to MAdCAM-1, exposing binding sites for α4β7 activation and
  ultimately altering the cytoskeleton; Pathogenic bacteria can be transferred to
  the lung through the gut-lung axis to trigger inflammatory responses, while probiotics
  could migrate to the lungs and reduce the inflammatory responses by the production
  of antibodies and enhancement of NK cells; Bifidobacterium enhances the inflammatory
  responses caused by the migration of pathogenic bacteria
