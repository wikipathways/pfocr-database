caption: 'AID-associated gene network. Gene network displaying AID as key gene was
  created using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (IPA; http://www.ingenuity.com).
  Different gene modules are spatially separated for visualization: stimuli controlling
  AID expression and activity (green color code); transcriptional regulators (red
  color code); an additional level of AID regulation is displayed by a group of miRNAs
  (brown color code); direct and indirect AID-interacting molecules associated with
  functional activity of AID (blue color code); molecules modulated by AID activity
  including various Ig isotypes as consequence of CSR events and examples of affected
  pluripotency genes as a result of AID-mediated reprogramming and DNA demethylation
  as well as TP53 being a prominent target of AID as genome-wide mutator (cyan color
  code)'
