caption: A model for the predicted G protein α-subunit signaling in S. macrospora.
  GSA1 and GSA2 propagate signals within the pheromone signaling pathway, in which
  GSA1 is the predominant regulator of fruiting body development upstream of the STE12
  transcription factor. GSA3 and SAC1 act on sexual development in a less characterized,
  parallel signaling pathway. Putative myristoylation of Gα-subunits GSA1 and GSA3
  is indicated by tails. Putative farnesylation of PPG2 is shown by a serrated tail.
