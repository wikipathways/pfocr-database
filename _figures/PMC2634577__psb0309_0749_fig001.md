caption: A model of the feedback regulation loop mediated by EIN3 and EBF2 in ethylene
  signaling. EIN3 is ubiquitinated by the SCFEBF complex and then degraded by the
  26S proteasome. Ethylene represses this degradation pathway and the resulting accumulation
  of EIN3 activates the transcription of target genes. Simultaneously, EIN3 binds
  and activates the EBF2 promoter. EBF2 is recruited into an SCF complex (SCFEBF2)
  that promotes the ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of EIN3.
