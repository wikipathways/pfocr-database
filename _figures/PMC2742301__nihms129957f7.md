caption: The broad range tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG18 blocks the potentiation of
  AR transcription by MAA. Activation of tyrosine kinase(s) at the cell surface, or
  elsewhere in the cell, leads to the activation of multiple intracellular signaling
  pathways, including the ERK MAP kinase pathway (left) and PI3 kinase signaling (right).
  MAA treatment activates phosphoryation of the MAP kinase ERK1 and ERK2, however,
  inhibition of this pathway using the MEK inhibitor U0126 does not block MAA-induced
  AR potentiation. In contrast, inhibition of PI3 kinase signaling using LY294002
  blocks the enhancement of AR transcriptional activity by MAA. The detailed mechanism
  whereby PI3 kinase causes super-activation of AR (AR*) is unknown but could involve
  the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (a common target of PI3 kinase), leading
  to downstream effects such as an increase in coactivator binding or chromatin modifications
  associated with an increase in AR transcriptional output.
