caption: Diagram of reaction mechanisms involving drought and salt in rice. The left
  box of the larger picture is the regular mechanism of underground and aboveground
  parts under drought stress. Root composition can affect the water absorption and
  it is crucial to improve plant drought resistance. Leaf morphology and stomatal
  conductance of aboveground plants play a decisive role in water retention. The right
  box is the response mechanism under salt stress. The rejection of Na+ in roots can
  reduce the accumulation of Na+ in tissues. The response mechanisms of ion transport,
  reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ content in aboveground parts can effectively alleviate
  the effects of salt stress. The rightmost box shows the co-response mechanism under
  drought and salt stress. Some secondary messengers, such as Ca2+, and ROS can alleviate
  the damage of osmotic stress to plants and improve the drought and salt tolerance
  through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways. The main components in the core
  ABA signaling transduction pathway include ABA receptor PYLs, SnRK2s, ABA co-receptor
  branch type A 2C protein phosphatase (PP2Cs) and SnRK2.

  description: Diagram of reaction mechanisms involving drought and salt in rice.
    The left box of the larger picture is the regular mechanism of underground and
    aboveground parts under drought stress. Root composition can affect the water
    absorption and it is crucial to improve plant drought resistance. Leaf morphology
    and stomatal conductance of aboveground plants play a decisive role in water retention.
    The right box is the response mechanism under salt stress. The rejection of Na+
    in roots can reduce the accumulation of Na+ in tissues. The response mechanisms
    of ion transport, reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ content in aboveground parts
    can effectively alleviate the effects of salt stress. The rightmost box shows
    the co-response mechanism under drought and salt stress. Some secondary messengers,
    such as Ca2+, and ROS can alleviate the damage of osmotic stress to plants and
    improve the drought and salt tolerance through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent
    pathways. The main components in the core ABA signaling transduction pathway include
    ABA receptor PYLs, SnRK2s, ABA co-receptor branch type A 2C protein phosphatase
    (PP2Cs) and SnRK2.
