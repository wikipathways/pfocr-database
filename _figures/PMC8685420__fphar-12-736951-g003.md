caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis predictions. (A) IPA predicted higher tumor progression
  inhibition in PC-3 compared to the LNCaP cell line following TOPO METRO at 72 h
  treatment. FOS, CDKN1A and SERPINB5, PLAUR, TNF and BCL2 are key genes in the tumor
  progression pathway that were expressed differentially between the two different
  treatment regimens, which predicted higher tumor progression inhibition for METRO-TOPO
  treatment. (B) Anti-angiogenesis (inhibition of angiogenesis) pathway. where METRO
  treatment resulted in higher downregulation in PC-3 compared to the LNCaP cell line
  for TOPO METRO at 72 h treatment.
