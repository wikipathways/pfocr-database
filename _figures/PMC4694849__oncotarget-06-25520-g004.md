caption: A. RNA-Seq was conducted on the A-H, A-L, S-H and S-L cells. In total, 612
  genes were significantly differentially expressed in A-H cells compared with A-L
  cells, and 594 genes were differentially expressed genes were identified in S-H
  cells compared with S-L cells (P < 0.05 and fold change > 2.0). B. The PI3K pathway
  plays a pivotal role in many human malignancies [, ]. The extracellular matrix (ECM)
  activates focal adhesion kinases (FAKs), and the PI3K pathway can be activated by
  FAKs []. High ECM1 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis and metastatic
  potential in human carcinomas [, ]. The most studied type I PI3Ks include the α,
  β, γ and δ subtypes; mutations or abnormal expression of PI3Kα(PIK3CA) are the most
  commonly reported in cancer [, ]. PI3Kγ(PIK3CD) is activated by only stimulated
  G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) []. The survival mechanism initiated via PI3K
  is primarily activated through AKT. Increased AKT activation exerts anti-apoptotic
  effect, antagonizes cell cycle arrest, modulates angiogenesis, and activates mRNA
  translation via mTOR signaling []. P-TEN inhibits PI3K pathway activity [, ]. Under
  the regulation of AKT, Nur77 induces a conformational change in Bcl-2 and promotes
  apoptosis []. Additionally, PKC is located in downstream of mTOR. The β isoform
  of PKC (PRKCB) might play significant roles in promoting human breast cancers growth
  [, ].
