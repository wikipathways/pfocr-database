caption: 'Crosstalk between complement and coagulation cascade in COVID-19: There
  are 3 major self-regulating and overlapping pathways of complement activation system.
  The classical pathway triggered by binding of SARS-CoV antigens with immunoglobulins
  (IgG or IgM) to form immune complexes, which bind to the complement component (C)
  1 complex. These antibodies are not necessarily the ones produced in to response
  to the virus as naturally occurring antibodies are known to bind injured cells and
  activate complement []. The lectin pathway is activated by the binding of mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) with the viral spike protein. The classical and lectin pathways lead
  to the formation of the C3 convertase (C4bC2a) of the classical/lectin pathways.
  The alternative pathway is uninterruptedly activated in plasma by hydrolysis of
  C3 which forms C3(H2O) and promptly engages factors B (B) and D (D) to form a C3
  convertase [C3(H2O)Bb] of the alternative pathway. The C3 convertases cleave C3
  into C3a, an anaphylotoxin, and C3b, which deposits on cell surfaces. Additionally,
  C3b contributes to the formation of the C5 convertases that cleave C5, producing
  the anaphylatoxin C5a that attracts and activates inflammatory leukocytes, and C5b.
  C5b initiates the late events of complement activation, leading to the formation
  of the C5b-9 membrane-attack complex (MAC). C3a and C5a are potent chemoattractants
  for neutrophils and monocytes. Activated neutrophils generate web-like extracellular
  traps (NETs), in a process recognized as NETosis, that surround components such
  as C3, properdin, factor D (D) and factor B (B) that activate the alternative complement
  pathway and engage an inflammation. MAC also induces endothelial damage and tissue
  injury. MAC-induced endothelial injury results in thrombosis which stimulates the
  release of serine proteases, such as thrombin and kallikrein. It was shown that
  thrombin [] and kallikrein [] is capable of activating complement system. Complement
  activation product C5a can be cleaved by thrombin in the absence of C3a []. Factor
  XII cleaves C1s and thereby activates the classical complement pathway []. These
  alterations amplify a crosstalk between complement and coagulation pathways. Such
  interactions among endothelial injury, NETosis, inflammation, hypercoagulability,
  and complement activation cause tissue damage, such as acute kidney injury (AKI),
  acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke, and are frequently accompanying
  with a thrombotic microangiopathy.'
