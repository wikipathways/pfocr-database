caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of XIAP in HFD-induced steatohepatitis.
  In response to a prolonged challenge with fat-rich diet ingestion, enhanced oxidative
  stress injury caused by circulatory free fatty acid promotes NLRP3 inflammasome
  mediated inflammation infiltration, followed by generation of down-stream pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, ultimately facilitates metabolic disorder associated lipid accumulation
  in liver. In contrast, activated XIAP and Nrf2 activity are associated with decreased
  oxidative stress. Circulatory free fatty acid may suppress XIAP expression, further
  reduce Nrf2 pathway activation. Up-regulation of XIAP may act as the upstream to
  inhibit ROS generation and induce Nrf2 and other antioxidants activity. In addition,
  elevated Nrf2 activity and down-stream anti-oxidants including HO-1, NQO-1, SOD
  or GST further inhibit inflammatory response, finally relieve lipid deposition in
  liver and hepatic inflammation.
