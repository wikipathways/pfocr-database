caption: WNT pathway is significantly upregulated in invasive mutant TP53 cells. Ingenuity
  Pathway analysis shows networks of genes, known to be regulated by WNT signaling
  in gene expression data, are significantly associated with TP53 mutations. Upregulated
  and downregulated genes are indicated by dark shade and light shade, respectively.
  The lines and arrows represent functional and physical interactions and the directions
  of regulation, as indicated in the literature.
