caption: Substrate metabolism and metabolic flexibility in ICG001-treated TAC mice.
  Data were normalized to an internal control when the unit is indicated by area ratio.
  (a) Metabolic profiling in the glycolysis pathway and the TCA cycle of heart tissues
  from mice in the indicated group (n = 4–5). Lactate, aspartate, and alanine levels
  were significantly lower in the ICG001-treated TAC mice (blue squares) compared
  to the vehicle-treated TAC mice. (b) Metabolic profiling in methionine and cysteine
  showed the oxidative stress index calculated from the ratio of reduced (GSH) and
  oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (GSH/GSSG) (n = 4–5). (c) Essential amino acid levels
  in heart tissues from mice in the indicated group (n = 4–5). Statistical significance
  of distributed data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons
  test. ns not significant, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 vs. vehicle group.
  G1P glucose-1-phosphate, G6P glucose-6-phosphate, G3P glycerol-3-phosphate, AKG
  alpha-ketoglutarate, Glu glutamic acid, Gln glutamine, OAA oxaloacetic acid.
