caption: A diagrammatic illustration of the circRNA-miRNA-TF signaling axis in the
  progression or suppression of cancer. c-Myc, a cell cycle regulator is modulated
  by circMTO1 and circITCH via sponging miR-9, miR-17/miR-224 resulting in an enhanced
  p21 level and cell cycle progression. Increased expression of Circ-ZNF609 also promotes
  cell proliferation via c-Myc. The expression of pro-tumorigenic SNAIL and TWIST
  is also regulated by circRNA which interacts with the signaling pathways and promotes
  EMT. For instance, circPRMT5 via sponging miR-30c promotes the expression of SNAIL
  and TWIST which stimulate EMT via enhancing the expression of N-Cadherin/Vimentin
  and inhibiting E-CADHERIN. Circ-CTNNB1 binds to DDX3 facilitating the interaction
  of DDX3 with YY1 thereby transactivating YY1 and enhancing the expression of WNT1
  and WNT3 which further bind to Frizzled receptor leading to amplification of Wnt/ß-Catenin
  pathway. Amplified Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling inhibits GSK3ß mediated destruction of
  ß-catenin, allowing translocation of cytoplasmic ß-Catenin to nucleus and initiation
  of transcription of the effectors involved in the process of EMT. circ ß-Catenin
  act as a decoy for GSK3ß and protects ß-Catenin from the GSK3ß mediated degradation
  resulting in the promotion of Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling and EMT in HCC. Circ-Foxo3
  plays a pro-apoptotic role via sponging miR-22 and miR-138. Circ-UBAP2 and circOMA1
  play anti-apoptotic roles by sponging miR-143 and decoying miR-145-5p respectively.
  The expression of HIF-1α is regulated by PI3K/AKT pathway. HIF-1α promotes the expression
  of VEGF thereby promoting angiogenesis. An upregulated circ_0010729 sponges miR-186
  and inhibit the miR-186 mediated degradation of HIF-1α thus promoting angiogenesis.
  Circ-MYLK serves as a decoy for miR-29a and promotes the stability of VEGF resulting
  in angiogenesis.
