caption: Coagulation profile of endothelial surface during normal (left panel) and
  activated state (right panel). The anticoagulant profile is normally obtained by
  inhibition of thrombin (TR) activation of factor X by thrombomodulin (TM) expression
  on endothelial surface with formation of the activated protein C complex (APC).
  Antithrombin III (ATIII) further inhibits Thrombin activity by preventing its binding
  with receptor (TRr). Also tissue factor (TF) is not expressed on the endothelium,
  while its main physiological inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI),
  is normally released by the intact endothelium. Finally the tissue plasminogen activator
  (tPA) catalyzes the zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, while tissue plasminogen activator
  inhibitor type-1 (tPAI-1) is reduced. After hypoxia, injury, or sepsis, the damaged
  endothelium expresses large amounts of TF, while TFPI release is inhibited. Also
  thrombomodulin receptor is internalized thus reducing APC formation, while decreased
  ATIII synthesis and degradation by serine protease increases the activity of thrombin.
  Finally tPAI-1 synthesis and release are increased thus reducing the formation of
  plasmin
