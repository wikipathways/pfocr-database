caption: 'Metabolic requirements of protein and DNA methylation and protein acetylation.
  S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) acts as a methyl donor for histone and DNA methylation.
  SAM is produced through one-carbon metabolism. Demethylation can require the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle intermediate α-KG as a co-factor, and can be inhibited by other
  TCA cycle products: Succinate, fumarate or 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Histone demethylation
  by lysine-specific histone deacetylase 1 (LSD1) can also require the flavin adenine
  dinucleotide reduced form (FADH2), whose pools are dependent upon fatty acid oxidation
  and the TCA cycle. Histone acetylation requires acetyl-CoA, obtained from citrate
  or fatty acid oxidation in the TCA cycle. Histone deacetylation by sirtuin (SIRT)
  histone deacetylases is NAD+-dependent. NADH pools derive from multiple metabolic
  pathways, including glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
  the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, amino acid oxidation and OXPHOS. The metabolites
  involved in different pathways are shaded in different colors: Glycolysis (green),
  one carbon metabolism (yellow), pentose phosphate pathway (purple), TCA cycle (blue),
  NADH and FADH2 (pink) and glutaminolysis (orange).'
