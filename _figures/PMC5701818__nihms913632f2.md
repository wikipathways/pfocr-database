caption: Glucose transported into neurons is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6P)
  and processed to pyruvate via glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  In mature neurons, the PPP is the main route for glucose metabolism. NADPH produced
  in the PPP regenerates GSH to maintain a proper redox homeostasis in cells. NO-related
  species affect glucose utilization through S-nitrosylation (SNO) of key enzymes
  in glycolysis, such as hexokinase (HK), aldolase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Additional studies are needed to examine if other glycolysis
  or PPP enzymes are regulated by S-nitrosylation or related redox-mediated events.
  Glycolysis- or PPP-derived pyruvate enters mitochondria and is fully metabolized
  through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain
  (ETC), producing ATP. In astrocytes, high glycolysis activity generates pyruvate;
  in turn, lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5) converts pyruvate to lactate, which is then
  shuttled to neurons via the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) system. In neurons,
  the transported lactate is utilized by LDH1, converting lactate back to pyruvate
  for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.
