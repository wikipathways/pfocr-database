caption: The role of astrocytic AQP4/9, P2X7R, and Kir6.1 channels in PD. AQP4 deficiency
  fails to upregulate TGF-β1 and GDNF expression, and upregulates the IKK/NF-κB pathway,
  which subsequently facilitates TNF-α and IL-1β production and results in an inflammatory
  response. AQP9 channels are located on the IMM and allow environmental toxins such
  as MPP+ to enter the mitochondria. In addition, Kir6.1 deficiency fails to upregulate
  LC3-II and PINK1/Parkin, leading to impairment mitophagy, which can result in excessive
  damage of the mitochondria, and subsequently lead to ROS production. Kir6.1 deficiency
  can also lead to NF-κB activation and subsequently facilitate complement C3 production.
  Complement C3 then acts on neuronal C3aR to cause dopaminergic neuronal death. Astrocytic
  P2X7R overexpression can result in excessive Ca2+ influx; this can upregulate the
  level of lipid mediators of cysteinyl leukotrienes and subsequently lead to inflammation.
