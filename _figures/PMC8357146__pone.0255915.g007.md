caption: A. In normal gastric epithelium, ASPN is not present in the tumor microenvironment,
  DCN exerts its inhibitor activity by binding with TGFβ ligand, thereby, impede TGFβ
  signaling cascade and subsequent EMT, angiogenesis. (B). In GC tissue, DCN expression
  is lacking, ASPN binds with TGFβ ligand, triggers the canonical pathway by phosphorylating
  Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated Smads translocate to the nucleus and activates EMT
  and angiogenesis. Blunted lines, inhibition; dotted line, activation; cross, disrupted
  interaction.
