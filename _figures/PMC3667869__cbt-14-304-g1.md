caption: Figure 1. A schematic of the molecular pathways implicated in resistance
  to EGFR TKIs. Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain (predominantly T790M, which accounts
  for 50–60% of EGFR inhibitor resistance) abrogate the ability of first generation
  EGFR TKIs to inhibit mutant EGFR. Second generation EGFR TKIs BIBW2992, PF299804
  and WZ4002 are currently in clinical trials and show promise as inhibitors of EGFR
  T790M. EGFR TKI resistance can also occur via upregulation or activation of other
  RTKs, such as AXL (20–25%), MET (5%) and HER2, which can bypass the inhibition of
  oncogenic EGFR signaling and activate downstream effector pathways. RTK-independent
  activation of some of these downstream effectors can also occur, leading to resistance.
  PTEN loss and activating PI3K mutations (i.e., E545K) have been observed, leading
  to constitutive AKT activation. Activating BRAF V600E mutations and MAPK1 amplification
  have been reported which lead to hyper-activation of MAPK signaling and resistance.
  NFκB pathway activation has been associated with resistance to EGFR TKI treatment.
  The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and transition to small-cell neuroendocrine
  phenotype have each been associated with resistance to EGFR TKIs, though the mechanistic
  underpinnings of these observations are unclear.
