caption: Cuprizone induced myelin loss could be due to reduced myelin protein production
  and the subsequent destabilization and vacuolation of the myelin sheath. (1) Cuprizone
  administration leads to reduced levels of certain amino acids (Glycine, Alanine,
  and Proline) in the blood plasma. This amino acid starvation could lead directly
  or indirectly – through the amino acid response pathway – to reduced protein synthesis
  in the oligodendrocyte. (2) In the cuprizone model several proteins are reduced,
  that are either part of the myelin sheath or enzymes that produce components of
  the myelin sheath. For example, MAG and MBP are reduced – both are crucial stabilizers
  of the myelin sheath. CGT and HMG-CoA reductase are reduced as well. CGT is crucial
  in producing Galactocerebrosides. HMG-CoA is involved in the cholesterol synthesis
  pathway. Both Galactocerebrosides and cholesterol are important parts of the myelin
  sheath membrane. Lack of MAG, MBP, galactocerebrosides, and cholesterol could lead
  to myelin sheath destabilization, formation of intramyelinic vacuoles, and subsequence
  myelin and axonal damage degradation
