caption: Working model of PKS5-mediated  signaling processes relative to the core  signaling
  pathway. A simplified model for PKS5/CIPK11/SnRK3.22-mediated  signaling relative
  to SnRK2- and SnRK1-mediated  signaling processes is shown. When challenged by abiotic
  stresses (i.e. high salt or drought), endogenous  or Ca2+ significantly increases,
  which is a requirement for the establishment of adaptive responses in plants. When
  bound to , PYL receptors inhibit clade A PP2Cs. The inhibition of PP2Cs in turn
  leads to SnRK2 or SnRK1 activation. Activated SnRK2s or SnRK1s mediate  signaling
  through the phosphorylation of downstream effectors (ABI5 or ABFs). Once activated
  by unknown upstream proteins, PKS5 is able to positively modulate  signaling at
  least partly via the phosphorylation of ABI5 at Ser-42. The complex of Ca2+-C2-DOMAIN
  ABSCISIC ACID-RELATED PROTEIN (CARs)-PYLs may facilitate the  signaling in plants.
  Arrows depict activation, and intersecting lines indicate inhibition. Abiotic stresses
  and adaptive responses are shown in semitransparent format. The core  signaling
  pathway is circled with pink dotted lines. The activation of PKS5 by  likely undergoes
  cross talk at other levels (dotted lines). For a detailed description, see “Discussion.”
