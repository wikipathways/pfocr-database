caption: Metabolic pathways of neutrophils and macrophages. Macrophages and neutrophils
  utilize their differing metabolic capacities to maintain their effector function.
  In short lived, rapidly responding neutrophils, glucose is rapidly processed to
  form ATP via glycolysis and NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway. These activities
  enable neutrophils to engage in chemotaxis, phagocytose and maintain respiratory
  burst via NADPH. Neutrophil NOX can be associated with the plasma membrane, rather
  than the mitochondria. This glucose‐maintained NADPH source is important for many
  ROS related functions such as NET formation; however fatty acid and glutamine fueled
  mitochondrial function has also been demonstrated to play a significant role in
  NET formation and the maintenance of ROS when glucose availability or NOX function
  is limited. Neutrophils also build and utilize glycogen, possibly to further aid
  function in glucose‐depleted environments. Macrophages are also able to process
  glucose via glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to maintain ATP and NADPH
  respectively. ATP‐stimulation of macrophages helps maintain mitochondrial membrane
  potential, cell viability and induces cytokine expression. As a longer‐lived cell,
  macrophages also contain significant mitochondrial capacity and utilize this to
  process glutamine and fatty acids. This mitochondrial capacity is enhanced during
  activation with IL‐4 and reduced under IFN‐γ and LPS stimulation in an NO‐dependent
  mechanism
