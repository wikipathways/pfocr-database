caption: 'The landscape of synergic epigenetic interactions with JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway in PD development. JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation involves multiple
  epigenetic events. (A) Hyperacetylation of Histone H2, H3, and H4 results in the
  overexpression of the SNCA gene, which leads to α-synuclein aggregation and JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway activation. (B) Higher expression of miR-155 and circPTK2 sponging
  with miR-29b inhibit SOCS1 expression that accelerates neuronal apoptosis through
  SOCS-1-JAK2/STAT3-IL-1β signaling. (C) Similarly, synergic interaction of lncSNHG1
  sponging with miR-7 and lncGAS5 sponging with miR-223-3p activates NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which transforms glial cells to the inflammatory phenotype and the aggregation of
  α-synuclein. Moreover, lower expression of PGC-1α also contributes to JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway activation. Altogether, these epigenetic mechanisms interact with each other
  and with JAK/STAT signaling pathways to induce neuroinflammation in PD development.
  Note: ↓ shows downregulated expression, and ↑ shows an upregulated expression.'
