caption: Composite cytokines of CLF1 and CLC or CLF1 and the p28 subunit of IL-27
  are assembled in the cell and secreted. It is unknown if CLF1 is secreted in the
  absence of its partners. CLF1/CLC has been found to signal via the tripartite receptor
  complex of CNTFRa, LIFRβ, and gp130. CLF1/p28 was also found to bind IL-6Ra complexed
  with gp130 and WSX-1. Engagement of these receptors leads to downstream signaling
  events via the JAK/STAT pathway (particularly STAT3), MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT. The
  full range of cells that are potentially responsive to CLF1 stimulation is unknown.
  The effect of CLF1 on these cells also remains unknown.
