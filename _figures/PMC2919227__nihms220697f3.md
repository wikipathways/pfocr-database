caption: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binds to the VEGF receptor, a receptor
  tyrosine kinase, leading to receptor dimerization and subsequent auto phosphorylation
  of the receptor complex. The phosphorylated receptor then interacts with a variety
  of cytoplasmic signaling molecules, leading to signal transduction and eventually
  angiogenesis. Examples of both pre-clinical and clinical compounds that inhibit
  the pathway are shown.
