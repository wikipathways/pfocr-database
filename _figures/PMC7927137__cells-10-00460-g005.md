caption: 'The circadian clock machinery regulates the biosynthesis of NAD+ through
  control of the NAD+ salvage pathway. BMAL-1:CLOCK heterodimer binds to the promoter
  region of NAMPT to regulate the rhythmic transcription of this gene and thus the
  levels of NAD+. Expression of SIRT1 silences the expression of NAMPT (the rate-limiting
  enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis), which leads to a decrease in the concentration of
  NAD+, diminishing the activity of SIRT1. When the activity of SIRT1 decreases significantly,
  then the activity of CLOCK:BMAL-1 begins to increase, which restores the expression
  levels of NAMPT and thus completes the cycle. NAMPT: nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;
  CLOCK: basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor; BMAL1: Brain and muscle
  ARNT-like 1 protein; NMN: nicotinamide mononucleotide; NAM: nicotinamide.'
