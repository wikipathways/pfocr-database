caption: Scheme illustrating the influence of ROS on the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The nuclear factor κβ (NF-κB) family comprises five subunits, which are
  NF-κB1 (p105/p50), NF-κB2 (p100/p52), RelA (p65), RelB, and cREL. The canonical
  NF-κB pathway is primarily activated by proinflammatory receptor stimulation, such
  as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. These receptors activate the canonical
  signaling cascade by activating the kinases IκB (IKK) complex composed of IKKα and
  IKKβ (catalytic kinases) and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (NF-κB essential modulator,
  NEMO). As a result of ubiquitination and proteasome degradation, the heterodimer
  p50/RelA is released, undergoes nucleocytoplasmic transport, binds to κB sites,
  and activates the transcription of the gene. Noncanonical NF-κB activation is associated
  with the inducible kinase NF-κB (NIK). The stabilization of NIK leads to further
  noncanonical signaling events. Phosphorylation of p100 by IKKα, followed by ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation, allowing the release of p52 and its partner for DNA
  binding in the nucleus. ROS = reactive oxygen species, P = phosphate group, IκB
  = inhibitory protein kappa B, Trx = thioredoxin-1
