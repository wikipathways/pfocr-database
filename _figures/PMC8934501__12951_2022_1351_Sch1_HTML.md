caption: Schematic illustration showing the inhibition mechanism of osteogenesis in
  wear particle-induced osteolysis. Abnormal activation of glycogen synthesis kinase
  3β (GSK-3β) triggered by Ti nanoparticles participates in the posttranslational
  modification and degradation of Gli1, which is the key transcription factor of osteogenesis
  in the Hedgehog pathway. In addition, inactivation of GSK-3β rescued Ti nanoparticle-induced
  osteogenesis inhibition as a result of increasing the accumulation of Gli1 and its
  translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
