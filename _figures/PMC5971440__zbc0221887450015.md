caption: Arteriosclerotic G3BP1/RIG-I signaling in aortic VSM, a working model. We
  () and others () previously identified that LRP6 expression in VSM restrains noncanonical
  Wnt signals that (a) promote phenotype modulation and neointima formation and (b)
  enhance arteriosclerotic mineralization. We demonstrated that protein Arg methylation
  is profoundly altered with LRP6 deficiency and have identified G3BP1 as a key MMA
  target that is negatively regulated by LRP6. We further show that RIG-I, also known
  as Ddx58, functionally and physically interacts with G3BP1 to enhance G3BP1 Arg
  methylation and the noncanonical Wnt/NFAT pathway. This is mediated in part via
  NFATc4 nuclear translocation and association with osteogenic genomic targets such
  as the OPN and TNAP promoters. The mechanisms whereby nuclear Runx2 transactivation
  is enhanced by the G3BP1/cRIG-I cascade have yet to be determined (indicated by
  the ?). Not shown are the contributions of nuclear USF1 and Sp1 recently identified
  as also held in check by VSM LRP6 signaling (, ). See text for details.
