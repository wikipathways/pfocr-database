caption: Proposed signaling model of crosstalk between TSHR and PI3K signaling pathway.
  In thyroid cancer cells, TSHR couples to Gα12/13, interacts with LARG and then activates
  RhoA to increase migration. PI3K signaling activation increased LARG levels in cancer
  cells and altered its localization to facilitate the interaction of LARG with Gα12/13
  and enhance TSHR-Gα12/13signaling. Gα12/13signaling also might participate with
  PI3K to inhibit the pathways downstream Gαssignaling.
