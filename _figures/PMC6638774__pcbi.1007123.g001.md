caption: Our simulation consists of four consecutive models (left to right). Given
  the position of the sun, a realistic skylight model [] provides the predicted luminance,
  degree and angle of linear polarisation for every point in the sky-dome. This provides
  input to the eye model, based on biological data from insects [, ], which defines
  an array of polarisation sensitive photo-receptors facing different parts of the
  sky, and uses opponent processing to produce luminance-independent POL-neuron responses.
  The compass model provides a hypothesis for the unknown neural process that converts
  the POL-neuron response to a true compass signal in the TB1 neurons; this also utilises
  information about tilt of the sensor array, and allows for the movement of the sun
  with passing time. Finally, the compass neurons’ output is used along with speed
  as input to an anatomically grounded model of the central complex [] which performs
  path integration and produces an output signal that can steer the insect back home.
  Blue boxes represent known systems in the pathway of the skylight; the red box represents
  a fuzzy/unknown system, which is the main focus of modelling in this paper.
