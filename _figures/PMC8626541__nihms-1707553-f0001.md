caption: Interstrand crosslink (ICL) stalled replication forks are recognized by FANCM
  and its binding partner FAAP24, allowing for precise localization of the FA core
  complex to damaged chromatin. The FA core complex, a multimeric ubiquitin ligase,
  is comprised of at least 8 subunits including FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF,
  FANCG, FANCL and FAAP100. Once bound to the FANCM/FAAP24 docking platform, FANCL
  of the core complex associates with E2-conjugating ligase UBE2T (FANCT) to monoubiquitinate
  a heterodimer of FANCD2 and FANCI (FANCD2-I). Ubiquitination of FANCD2-I triggers
  assembly of the downstream ICL repairosome, with recruitment of SLX4 (FANCP), activating
  various endonucleases, including ERCC4 (FANCQ), MUS81, and SLX1. Cleavage at ICL
  sites by these enzymes separates the DNA strands, to which the FA core complex recruits
  REV1, REV3, and REV7 (FANCV) to form the translesion synthesis polymerase complex
  (REV1–pol ζ). Pol ζ bypasses the ICL, with the nascent strand re-establishing one
  of the original DNA duplexes. The double-stranded break of the remaining damaged
  duplex is then repaired via homologous recombination. First, BRCA2 (FANCD1) and
  its binding partner PALB2 (FANCN) localize to the break. BRCA2 initiates the homologous
  strand exchange process by recruiting recombinase RAD51 (FANCR), which facilitates
  invasion of the cleaved strand into the intact sister chromatid. This RAD51-guided
  recombination filament searches for and identifies the complementary sister sequence
  upon which repair synthesis and ligation are completed.
