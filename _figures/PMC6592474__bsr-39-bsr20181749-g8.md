caption: In response to ER stress, Bip dissociates from ER stress transducers and
  binds to unfolded and misfolded proteins, resulting in the activation of ER stress
  transducers PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Upon activation, PERK increases phosphorylation
  of eIF2α, leading to a global attenuation of protein synthesis and a concomitant
  increase in ATF4 translation. In turn, ATF4 induces CHOP, a proapoptotic transcription
  factor. After the dissociation of Bip, IRE1 splices the mRNA of XBP1, and produces
  an active transcription factor named spliced XBP1, which upregulates ER chaperones
  and proteins implicated in the ER-associated protein degradation. Furthermore, IRE1
  recruits TRAF2 to trigger activation of ASK1 and JNK resulting in SGC apoptosis.
  Meanwhile, TRAF2 liberates procaspase 12 and allows its dimerization and translocation
  in the cytosol, finally leading to apoptosis. Besides, ASK1 can also activate p38,
  the activated state of which functions to phosphorylate CHOP, thereby enhancing
  its pro-apoptotic effect. In addition, ATF6 translocates to Golgi apparatus, where
  it is activated by site 1 and site 2 Golgi resident proteases. Activated ATF6 transcriptionally
  induces ERAD genes and upregulates CHOP expression.
