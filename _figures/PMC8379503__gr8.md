caption: 'Schematic illustrating the effects of cardiac frataxin-deficiency on the
  development of mitochondrial (Mito) homeostatic dysregulation. (A) In 10 week-old
  frataxin KO mice hearts, enhanced mitochondrial proliferation was evident by the
  up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (involving Pgc1α, Nrf1 and Tfam) and increased
  mtDNA. The increased Pgc1α protein could be potentiated by transcriptional regulation
  via increased Ampk and decreased Paris. Concurrently, there was also increased Pgc1α
  acetylation suggesting inhibition of the protein at 10 weeks, which could be due
  to decreased Sirt1 expression and activity caused by a feedback inhibition due to
  increased NAM. The NAD+ salvage pathway was also dysregulated with the inhibition
  of Nampt but up-regulation of Nmnat1, causing increased NAM and reduced NMN, respectively.
  Moreover, increased NAD+ consumption via increased glycolysis and Kreb cycle, together
  with decreased mitochondrial complex I activity, would result in a decreased NAD+:
  NADH ratio and impaired energy metabolism in 10 week KOs. (B) In FA, frataxin-deficiency
  progressively leads to LV mitochondrial iron-accumulation and inhibition of the
  electron transport chain that causes mitochondrial redox stress. Asymptomatic 4
  week frataxin KO mice progressively develop a fatal, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
  by 10 weeks. Our data in the frataxin-deficient heart identified progressive activation
  of: (1) mitochondrial dysfunction, involving the mitochondrial recruitment of Pink1
  and Parkin observed from 4 week; (2) mitochondrial fission, involving mitochondrial
  translocation of Drp1 and increased Fis1 from 4 week; (3) mitochondrial fusion,
  involving enhanced Mfn1 and Opa1 expression that was significant at 10 weeks; and
  (4) mitophagy from 4 week, and increased autophagic flux at 10 week. Overall, there
  is progressive dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis in the frataxin-deficient
  heart that contributes to FA cardiac pathology.'
