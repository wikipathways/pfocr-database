caption: The role of soluble ENG in endothelial dysfunction and vascular malformation.
  (A) Endoglin (ENG) mediates the TGFβ signaling pathway in endothelial cells (ECs).
  The mutation of Eng (haploinsufficiency) reduces TGFβ signaling. MMP-14 cleaves
  to the extracellular domain of ENG in ECs, producing a soluble form of ENG (sENG).
  The sENG acts as a decoy receptor for the TGFβ, resulting in impaired TGFβ signaling.
  Therefore, both mutant ENG and sENG lead to the disruption of TGFβ signaling and
  subsequently mediate EC dysfunction and vascular malformation. TM, transmembrane.
  (B) Soluble ENG stimulates microglia (by an unknown mechanism) and leads to microglial
  activation with up-regulation of inflammatory/angiogenic mediators. The microglia-derived
  inflammatory/angiogenic mediators possibly induce hyper-angiogenic signaling on
  ECs and cause EC dysfunction. Taken together, the sENG-induced disruption of TGFβ
  signaling in ECs and the activation of microglia may work together to drive vascular
  malformations.
