caption: 'Sessile serrated and traditional serrated pathways. The first pathway consists
  of molecular profile cancers which are CpG island methylator phenotype-high (CIMP-high)
  and BRAF mutation positive with microsatellite instability being high (MSI-H) or
  stability (MMS). The precursor of these cancers may be MVHP and SSA. The second
  pathway consists of CpG island methylator phenotype-low (CIMP-low), KRAS mutations
  positive with microsatellite stability or instability being low (MSI-L). The precursor
  lesion in this second pathway may be TSA. MVHP: microvesicular hyperplastic polyp;
  SSA: sessile serrated adenoma; TSA: traditional serrated adenoma.'
