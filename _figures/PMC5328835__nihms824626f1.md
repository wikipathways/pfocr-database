caption: The expression of Sost/sclerostin is tightly regulated by complex mechanisms
  involving crosstalk between systemic hormones, cytokines and mechanical stimuli
  (black lines). The chaperone LRP4 presents sclerostin to the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6,
  thus facilitating sclerostin inhibition of Wnt/βcatenin signaling. The consequent
  inhibition of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway leads to decreased bone formation due to
  impaired osteoblastogenesis and decreased osteoblast survival (green line). Novel
  findings suggest that activation of osteocytic Wnt/βcatenin signaling itself increases
  the expression of Sost/sclerostin, which in turn acts in a negative feedback limiting
  bone formation driven by the pathway. Sclerostin not only regulates bone formation,
  but also bone resorption (blue lines). Inhibition of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in osteoblasts
  and osteocytes decreases the expression of Opg, and direct actions of sclerostin
  on osteocytes increase the expression of RANKL. In addition, inhibition of Wnt/βcatenin
  signaling in osteoclast precursors directly favors their differentiation. Thus,
  by antagonizing Wnt/βcatenin signaling, sclerostin has the potential to stimulate
  osteoclast differentiation and enhance bone resorption. Further, sclerostin increases
  in osteocytes the expression and activity of enzymes that remodel perilacunar matrix
  leading to osteolytic osteolysis.
