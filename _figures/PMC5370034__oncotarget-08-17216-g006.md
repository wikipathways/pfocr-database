caption: 'As illustrated in the figure, cell cycle has four distinct phases: G1 or
  gap 1(cells grow and prepare to synthesize), S or synthesis (DNA Synthesizes), G2
  or second gap (cells ready to divide) and M or mitosis phase (cell division occur).
  The cell cycle progression is controlled by a series of signaling cascade by which
  cell replicates its DNA thus allowing cell division and growth. The expression of
  the key regulatory gene p53 was elevated with the resveratrol treatment and also
  with the combination of RES+ DTX at the 48h time point. P53 acts as a transcription
  factor by binding to specific DNA sequences and induce the increased expression
  of pro-apoptotic gene BAX and cell cycle inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1. The
  up-regulation of BAX and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic (BCL-2 family) gene
  causes the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol and activates
  caspase cascade family protein cleaved PARP that induced the apoptosis. Moreover,
  the p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1 binds to cyclin D, E /CDK complex and inhibits kinase
  activity, and blocks the G1/S transition of the cells. The treatment with RES arrests
  the transition of cells at G2/M checkpoint by altering the CDK1/cyclin B complex
  formation. Moreover, the elevated level of p21WAF1/CIP1and p27KIP1 inhibits cell
  cycle progression through the interaction with PCNA and stops the further DNA replication.'
