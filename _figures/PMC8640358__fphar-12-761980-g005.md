caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis in Cytoscape 3.8.2
  software. The KEGG screening was conducted using Cytoscape 3.8.2 software. The association
  network between target genes and pathways was constructed. The target genes and
  KEGG pathways were scored according to the connectivity degree. A total of eight
  high expression of target protein include CASP3, BAX, RELA, EGFR, BCL2, CCND1, MAPK8,
  and VEGFA. The pathway involved in this process mainly includes the apoptosis pathway
  by KEGG analysis.
