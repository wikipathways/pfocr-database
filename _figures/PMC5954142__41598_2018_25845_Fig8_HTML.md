caption: Juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid hormone biosynthesis with number of hits
  from the P. solenopsis transcriptome. (a) The analysis of the transcriptome identified
  homologues genes coding for enzymes of the Juvenile Hormone biosynthetic pathway,
  including Farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (Fpps); Juvenile Hormone Acid Methyltransferase
  (Jhamt); and Cytochrome P450 (CYP15A1); and for degradation of the Juvenile Hormone,
  with Juvenile Hormone Epoxide Hydrolase (Jheh); Juvenile Hormone Esterase 1 (jhe1),
  with respective number of identified hits at e < e−30 by Blastx. Chemical structures
  obtained from KEGG. (b) The analysis of the transcriptome identified homologues
  genes coding for enzymes of the Ecdysteoid hormone biosynthetic pathway, including
  Cholesterol 7-dehydrogenase (Neverland); and a series of cytochrome P450 enzymes
  encoded by the Halloween genes, such as spook (CYP307A); phantom (CYP306A1); disembodied
  (CYP302A1); shadow (CYP315A1); and shade (CYP314A1). For ecdysteroid inactivation,
  a 26-dehydroxylase (CYP18A1), with respective number of identified hits at e < e−30
  by Blastx. Chemical structures obtained from KEGG.
