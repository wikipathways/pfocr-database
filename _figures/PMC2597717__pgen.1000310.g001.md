caption: Functional assignments of the catabolic genes are based on biochemical work
  in B. subtilis . All of the genes for this catabolic pathway are present in the
  C. crescentus myo-inositol catabolic locus diagrammed in , except the gene iolJ.
  Protein CC3250, annotated as a fructose bisphosphate aldolase, has a high similarity
  to IolJ of B. subtilis (BLAST score<e−40). This gene is upregulated 1.9-fold in
  myo-inositol relative to glucose. We propose it is the most likely candidate to
  carry out the enzymatic function of IolJ in C. crescentus.
