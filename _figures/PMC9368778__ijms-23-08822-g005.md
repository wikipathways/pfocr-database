caption: Schematic representation of the Hippo signaling pathway and Omicron MOD_LATS_1
  intervention. (A) Snapshot of the multiple sequence alignment of spike proteins
  from Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron along with the specific mutations in the Omicron
  that lead to the emergence of the SLiMs. (B) Modulation in the Hippo signaling pathway
  during Omicron infection. When the Hippo signaling pathway is active/on, YAP/TAZ
  proteins become phosphorylated by LATS1/2 kinases and remain in inactive form. However,
  during Omicron infection, cellular LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate viral MOD_LATS_1
  leaving active cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ, which can negatively regulate immune response
  and facilitate Omicron survival.
