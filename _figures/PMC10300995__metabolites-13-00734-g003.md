caption: 'Altered fatty acid metabolism and potential drugs in DLBCL. Fatty acids
  are transported into DLBCL cells via CD36. Fatty acids are finally converted to
  acetyl-CoA by a series of oxidation reactions and enter the TCA cycle. A product
  in the TCA cycle, citrate is transported out of mitochondria by CTP. In cytoplasm,
  citrate and CoASH are converted to acetyl-CoA catalyzed by ACLY. FASN, the key enzyme
  in fatty acid synthesis, inhibits the activation of PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2
  to PIP3, and then activates AKT/mTOR pathway to promote cell survival. On the contrary,
  PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3. Fasnall is a selective FASN inhibitor. Metformin is
  an inhibitor of CD36. TCA: tricarboxylic acid; FAO: fatty acid oxidation; FASN:
  fatty acid synthesis; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; ACLY: ATP-citrate lyase; PYR: pyruvate;
  CTP: citrate transporter protein; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homologue; mTOR:
  metabolic regulator mammalian target of rapamycin; CoASH: coenzyme A. PIP3: phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate'
