caption: 'Schematic descriptions of the apoptotic death pathways induced by anticancer
  drugs in gastric and breast cancer cells. (A) In gastric cancer cells, anticancer
  drugs activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein 1 (AP-1), induce
  Bax, release Cyt c, and activate the caspase cascade leading to apoptotic cell death
  via an intrinsic pathway. AP-1 activation is involved in growth arrest- and DNA
  damage-inducible gene 153 (Gadd153) induction. Induced Bax and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-xS
  interact to promote this death, which involves caspase-dependent and -independent
  pathways. Combination therapy with anticancer drugs and antisense (AS) Bcl-2 enhances
  the therapeutic effect by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax, activating
  a caspase cascade leading to apoptotic cell death. (B) In breast cancer cells, anticancer
  drugs activate extrinsic pathways via death receptor (DR)4/5 and Fas, leading to
  the activation of caspase-8 and Bax, release of Cyt c, activation of the caspase
  cascade, and ultimately apoptotic cell death. In drug-resistant cells, anticancer
  drugs block extrinsic pathways but activate intrinsic pathways involving the induction
  of Bax, Cyt c, and the caspase cascade, leading to apoptosis. Combination therapy
  with anticancer drugs and AS Bcl-2 enhances therapeutic efficacy through the downregulation
  of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated (p)Akt and upregulation of Bax, which activates the
  caspase cascade and leads to apoptotic cell death. Abbreviations: Casp, caspase;
  UPR, unfolded protein response; ER endoplasmic reticulum. This figure was custom-made
