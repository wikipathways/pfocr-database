caption: The mechanisms by which carbon-based nanoparticles induce cytotoxicity of
  macrophages. Exposure of macrophages to carbon nanomaterials triggers a cascade
  of cellular and molecular events, such as ROS generation and lysosome damage, which
  serve as the mechanisms underlying carbon nanomaterial-induced cell death, including
  necrosis, apoptosis and pyroptosis. Carbon nanomaterials cause the mitochondrial
  dependent apoptotic cascades through ROS-activated MAPKs pathway. ROS could activate
  several transcription factors, such as NF-κB that regulates the inflammatory response.
  Carbon nanomaterials induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), resulting
  in the translocation of cathepsins to the cytoplasm. ROS and LMP were reciprocal
  causation generating an amplification loop. LMP could potentially cause autophagy
  dysfunction. And inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis was initiated characterized by
  cleavage of caspase 1 and downstream IL-1β release
