caption: 'Functional role of CDKN2B in cancer. a In cis and in trans gene regulation
  of CDKN2B-AS1 through chromatin modification complexes. CDKN2B-AS1 acts as docking
  for the epigenetic regulators, PRC1 and PRC2 polycomb complexes, to modify the histone
  code. The PRC1 complex includes multiple subunits, such as PHC, CBX7, BMI1, and
  RING1a/1b, which are implicated in the maintenance of silencing by catalyzing monoubiquitination
  of histone H2A (H2AK119ub1). The PRC2 complex comprises the JARID2, EED, SUZ12,
  and EZH2 subunits which maintain chromatin repression by catalyzing mono-/di-/trimethylation
  of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3). b Automatic CHAT classification
  of the PubMed literature according to the hallmark of cancer taxonomy. Breast cancer
