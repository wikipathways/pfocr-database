caption: Regulation of metabolism and metabolically-regulated signals by integrins.
  (A) Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a role in the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1
  pathway upon integrin activation. mTORC1 activation by β1 integrin regulates Twist,
  which promotes EMT and transition to aerobic glycolysis. TGFβ1 stimulation also
  leads to integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-dependent PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway, as ILK
  binds to Rictor, a protein component of mTORC1. The ILK-mTORC1 interaction regulates
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); (B) integrin signaling regulates the Hippo
  signaling pathway through ILK. ILK inhibits upstream regulators of YAP/TAZ, which
  allows for YAP/TAZ activation and translocation to the nucleus, and thus upregulation
  of genes promoting cell proliferation and survival; (C) β1 integrin interacts with
  CD98, a protein involved in amino acid transport; increased amino acid levels activate
  mTORC1. CD98 controls β1 integrin recycling and clustering, leading to increased
  cell surface levels of β1 integrin, and FAK/PI3K signaling events; (D) α5 integrin
  controls Rac activation and collagenase I expression through a signaling mechanism
  involving mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production, indicating integrin-dependent
  control of mitochondrial metabolism. Red lines indicated positive regulation (arrowheads)
  or negative regulation (bars).
