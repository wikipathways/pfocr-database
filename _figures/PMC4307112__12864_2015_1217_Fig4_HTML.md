caption: 'Differentially expressed genes in appetite control pathway between grass
  carp before and after food habit transition from transcriptome analysis. The most
  important pathways are appetite control (A), adipocytokine signaling (B), glutamatergic
  synapase, calcium signaling and GABAergic synapase (C). The colors of ellipses or
  rectangles were shaded according to the different expression (red: the mRNA expression
  levels of fish in Group C were significantly higher than those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001,
  the absolute value of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1); green: the mRNA expression levels of fish
  in Group C were significantly lower than those in Group A (FDR ≤ 0.001, the absolute
  value of log2[Ratio] ≥ 1)). All of these genes were not differentially expressed
  between Groups A and B.'
