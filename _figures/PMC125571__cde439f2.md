caption: Fig. 2. Known signalling mechanisms of extracellular HMGB1. Extracellular
  HMGB1 (green spheres) stimulates smooth muscle cells (red) to migrate. This response
  is mediated through RAGE, a Gi/o protein and the MAP kinase pathway, but the exact
  connection between these participants in the signal transduction cascade is not
  known. Neurite outgrowth in neurons (yellow) is activated by HMGB1 binding to RAGE,
  and the signal is channelled through the Rho family of small GTPases. Signalling
  of HMGB1 through RAGE also activates the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, leading ultimately
  to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and its nuclear translocation. Other
  receptors (green) might also mediate responses to extracellular HMGB1.
