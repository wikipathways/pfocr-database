caption: TGF-β triggers the downstream activation of important signaling events of
  rat sarcoma (RAS) which are involved in the cooperation with the TGF-β/Smad family
  including the RAS-activated factor (RAF)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK),
  extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling).
  Moreover, TGF-β phosphorylation activates the Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 signaling
  cascade involved in the fibrotic process. SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the excess activation
  of TGF-β which in turn triggers the process of fibrosis. Decorin can effectively
  inhibit TGF-β, thereby sequestering the whole signaling pathway resulting in the
  reduction of fibrotic scar. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
