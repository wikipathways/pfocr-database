caption: Cartographic representation of the metabolic network for E.coli. Each circle
  represents a module and is coloured according to the KEGG pathway classification
  of the reactions belonging to it, while the arcs reflect the connection between
  clusters. The area of each colour in one circle is proportional to the number of
  reactions that belong to the corresponding metabolism. The width of an arc is proportional
  to the number of reactions between the two corresponding modules. For simplicity,
  bi-directed arcs are presented by grey edges.
