caption: 'Tumour angiogenesis: molecular pathways and potential interventional strategies.
  VEGF axis is recognised as the primary factor responsible for tumour angiogenesis
  resistance. Upon VEGF binding, the receptor tyrosine is activated. VEGF/VEGFR activates
  oncogenic signalling via mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway, the
  phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K-AKT) pathway, and the phospholipase-C-γ (PLC-γ)
  pathway leading to cell proliferation, survival, migration, and vascular permeability.
  Chronic VEGF/VEGFR inhibition has been found to lead to the emergence of compensatory
  signalling pathways that sustain angiogenesis. Several of these VEGF-independent
  signalling pathways, rely on key proteins, including the FGF/FGFR, angiopoietin-2
  (Ang2), and the MET oncogene. Complementary therapies focused on these alternative
  pathways have been developed to abrogate acquired resistance. Pan-FGFR inhibitors
  are used to inhibit the FGF/FGFR axis. The MET/HGF pathway is inhibited by HGF antagonists
  and by the anti-MET antibody cabozantinib. Ang-Tie axis can be targeted with trebananib,
  a peptibody that inhibits the binding of Ang1/2 to their receptor. Tumour microenvironment
  and interactions between tumour cells and non-malignant cells as fibroblast and
  leukocytes also affect angiogenesis by interfering with the signalling pathways
  required for cell recruitment and vascular construction.'
