caption: (A) mRNAs and miRNA-targets network of pathways. List of differentially expressed
  genes and miRNA targets were used to perform a global GeneTrail2 enrichment analysis
  and identify enriched pathways. A pathway-connections network was built in Cytoscape.
  Node colored labels represent the categories (mRNA, miRNA targets or combination)
  from which the pathways were enriched. Red circles are miRNA pathways, yellow are
  miRNA and mRNA pathways, green are mRNA pathways. (B) PPAR signaling pathway in
  2 levels, one for mRNA and one for miRNA targets.
