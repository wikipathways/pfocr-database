caption: 'There are two mechanisms by which macrophages release SQSTM1 into the extracellular
  environment (active secretion or passive release). Extracellular LPS induces SQSTM1
  lysosomal secretion by activating the TLR4-MYD88-STING1 pathway, while intracellular
  LPS triggers the pyroptotic release of SQSTM1 by activating the CASP11-GSDMD-GSDMD-N
  pathway []. After its release, SQSTM1 binds to the receptor INSR to activate the
  NFκB pathway, causing the polarization of pro-inflammatory macrophages (aka ‘M1’),
  and finally mediating septic death in mice through excessive inflammation and coagulation
  []. Abbreviations: CASP11, caspase 11; GSDMD, gasdermin D; INSR, insulin receptor;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MYD88, MYD88 innate immune signal transduction adaptor;
  NFKB, nuclear factor-κB; PLCG1, phospholipase C gamma 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  STING1, stimulator of interferon response CGAMP interactor 1; SQSTM1, sequestosome
  1; TLR4, toll like receptor 4.'
