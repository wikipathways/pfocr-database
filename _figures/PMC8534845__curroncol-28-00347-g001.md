caption: 'Factors affecting SCLC biology. Molecular Variables, Signaling Pathways,
  Transcription factors, Epigenetics, and Cell-surface Receptors. Evolving concepts
  in the understanding of SCLC include the following: The ubiquitous loss of TP53
  and Rb1 involved mainly in the G1-S phase cellular cycle checkpoints; NEUROD1, ASCL1,
  and POUF2 expression as determinants of SCLC subtypes; Over-expression of AURKA
  involved in the G2-M checkpoint, and characterizing the MYC-driven NEUROD1 high
  SCLC-N subtype; Role of DNA damage response mediators such as Chk1, WEE1, ATM/ATR,
  as well as AURK; Role of epigenetics such as EZH2 and LSD1; Role of EZH2 influencing
  response to chemotherapy by alteration of SLFN11 and immune phenotype by effect
  on MHC-I presentation; Role of EZH2 in affecting ASCL1 expression responsible for
  SCLC-A phenotype through TGF-beta-SMAD pathway; Variable expression of chemokine
  receptors dependent on STING pathway; PD-L1 and DLL3 studied as targetable cell-surface
  receptors.'
