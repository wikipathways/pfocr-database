caption: 'Biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins in maize. (A) Phenylpropanoid
  biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of anthocyanins. Genes (enzymes)
  in the pathway are: pal (PAL), phenylalanine-ammonia lyase; c4h (C4H), cinnamic
  acid hydroxylase; 4cl (4CL), 4-coumaryl:CoA ligase; c2 (CHS), chalcone synthase;
  chi1 (CHI), chalcone isomerase; f3h (F3H), flavanone 3-hydroxylase; pr1 (F3′H),
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (* = based on enzyme activity assay); a1 (DFR), dihydroflavanone
  reductase; a2 (AS), anthocyanidin synthase; bz1 (UFGT), UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  and bz2 (GST), glutathione S-transferase. (B) Close-up photos show red and purple
  aleurones in kernels of pr1 and Pr1 ears, respectively.'
