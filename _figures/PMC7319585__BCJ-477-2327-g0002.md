caption: Endophilin pre-enrichment on the plasma membrane (Stage I) is a prerequisite
  for FEME and mediates the promptness of the pathway to activate upon stimulation.
  FEME in itself only starts upon receptor activation and thus, corresponds to Stages
  II to V. Stage I. Plasma membrane priming cycle. Step 1, at high Pi(3,4,5)P3 patches,
  active GTP-loaded Cdc42, recruits FBP17 and CIP4 through their REM domains (R).
  Step 2, FBP17 and CIP4 cluster 5′-phosphatases SHIP1 and 2 as well as Lamellipodin
  (Lpd) through their SH3 domains. Lpd is further stabilized by Pi(3,4)P2 locally
  produced by SHIP1/2, Step 3, Endophilin is recruited from the cytosol (where it
  is autoinhibited) and concentrated by Lpd. From there, pre-enriched Endophilin mediates
  prompt FEME carrier formation upon cargo activation. In absence of cargo activation,
  the FEME priming complex aborts and disassembles (Step 4), upon local Cdc42 deactivation
  by the GAPs RICH1, SH3BP1 and Oligophrenin (OPHN1). Stage II. FEME activation upon
  cargo stimulation. Activation of receptors by their ligands stabilizes pre-enriched
  Endophilin patches and starts FEME. The exact signals driving this stage are still
  unclear. However, stages II to IV are inhibited by Cdk5 and GSK3β, which hold off
  FEME. Upon receptor activation, PI3K, AKT and ERK signaling inactivate GSK3β, thereby
  releasing its inhibitory action and activating FEME. Stage III. Cargo sorting. Activated
  receptors are recruited to nascent FEME pits either through direct binding to Endophilin
  (e.g. β 1 adrenergic receptor) or through binding of adaptor proteins (e.g. Cbl–CIN85
  complex recruiting EGFR). Stage IV. FEME carrier formation. Local addition of Endophilin
  molecules by activated cargoes trigger membrane curvature, likely supported by local
  actin polymerization. Dynamin is recruited by Endophilin but excluded from the main
  body of the tubules, likely to avoid premature membrane scission. Detachment of
  FEME carrier is achieved by the synergy of GTP-dependent membrane pinching by Dynamin,
  membrane tension imposed by local actin cytoskeleton and friction-driven scission
  (FDS) lipid diffusion barrier by the N-BAR domains of Endophilin. Stage V. FEME
  carrier transport. Swiftly after budding, FEME carriers are rapidly transported
  on microtubules by Dynein, recruited onto the tubules by Bin1. The precise timing
  of Dynein loading on FEME carriers (Stage IV or V) is not yet clear.
