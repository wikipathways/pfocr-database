caption: Model for the regulation of expression of genes in the p53 pathway by PARN
  deadenylase-associated p53 in different cellular conditions. (A) PARN deadenylase
  decreases the stability of the p53 mRNA in nonstress conditions. The AREs in the
  3′ UTR of the p53 mRNA have an important role in this regulatory process. (B) Under
  DNA damage conditions, p53 protein accumulates, allowing its association to and
  activation of PARN deadenylase resulting in the decrease levels of target mRNAs
  in the p53-dependent DDR pathway.
