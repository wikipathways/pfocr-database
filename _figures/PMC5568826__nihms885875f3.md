caption: Insulin signaling pathways are initiated by insulin binding to the extracellular
  alpha subunit of the insulin receptor (IR), followed by a conformational change
  in the beta subunit of the IR, which has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Receptor
  activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS and subsequent activation
  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Activation of PI3K leads to stimulation
  of various downstream serine kinases, including protein kinase B (Akt), which is
  involved in the translocation of the major glucose transporter GLUT4. Among the
  mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes from patients with obesity
  or diabetes is increased serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Phosphorylation
  of IRS proteins at particular serine residues inhibits the interaction of IRS proteins
  with the insulin receptors, resulting in a reduction in activity of the abovementioned
  signaling pathway and impaired cardiomyocyte glucose uptake. Lipid derivatives stimulate
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein kinase C (PKC), and IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated
  phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine residues. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction
  increases ROS production, which causes activation of serine/threonine kinases, including
  p38MAPK, JNK, IKKβ, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which increase
  serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Overnutrition, resulting in increased free
  fatty acids, also contributes to impaired insulin signaling through mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR)–S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)-mediated serine phosphorylation of
  IRS. MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; Other abbreviations as in .
