caption: The Fsr quorum-sensing system and its regulation in E. faecalis. The FsrD
  propeptide (encoded by fsrD) is exported and processed to produce small lactone
  gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP) via FsrB. FsrC is part of a
  two-component regulatory system that responds to extracellular GBAP and phosphorylates
  the intracellular response regulator, FsrA, which then induces the expression of
  ef1097, ef1097b, fsr locus, gelE (encoding a gelatinase), and sprE (encoding a serine
  protease). The pre-proprotein (170 amino acids) encoded by ef1097 is cleaved (N-terminal
  34 amino acids are removed) and transported through the Sec-dependent pathway, where
  gelatinase further trims the precursor to form enterocin O16 (68 C-terminal amino
  acids). ZBzl-YAA5911 (competitively) and NaCl (concentration-dependently) inhibit
  the interaction of GBAP with FsrC. Ambuic acid inhibits FsrB activity. Siamycin
  I, Sviceucin, and WS9326A inhibit the phosphorylation of FsrC.
