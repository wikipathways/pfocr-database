caption: The research strategy that integrates omics data to explore bioactive products
  and biosynthesis pathway analysis of hispidin. The solid lines represent the confirmed
  metabolic pathway. Dotted lines represent presumed metabolic pathway. The red arrows
  represent the upregulated steps in A67 strain. Dotted arrows represent the presumed
  steps. The histograms represent the relative expression level of the proteins in
  the SH1 and A67 strains.
