caption: Interplay between HOG1 and the RTG pathway in osmoadaptation. Hog1 is activated
  by osmostress to promote glycerol biosynthesis as a rapid and transient cellular
  stress response. Intracellular glycerol accumulation is controlled by its own synthesis
  and by the aquaglyceroporin Fps1p. RTG signaling is activated in a later phase,
  as determined by CIT2 up-regulation, to sustain mitochondrial function and metabolic
  homeostasis for cellular adaptation.
