caption: '(A) Creation, (B) Recall, and (C) Update modes. Explained in text but some
  details follow: (A) Creation mode details: (1) Noise in the system prevents any
  ties of excitation of DG'' cells during representation creation, so exactly K DG''
  cells fire. (2) Potentiation of synaptic weights of EC''in synapses on each DG''
  or CA3′ cell occurs in such a way that the weights of potentiating synapses sums
  to one; such normalization of weights is needed so that the representations of contexts
  created with larger numbers of EC''in neurons active do not dominate in later KWTA
  competitions. Other synapses potentiate in one step to fixed weights. (B) Recall
  mode details: (1) During production of the pre-recurrent CA3′ activity pattern CA3Ptrno,
  noise in the system prevents any ties of excitation, so at most, exactly K DG''
  cells fire. If the number of active neurons in CA3Ptrno is less than K0, CA3′ activity
  is extinguished until the next attribute is sampled. (2) The excitation evoked by
  recurrent collateral activity causes the K most excited CA3′ cells to fire to produce
  CA3Ptrn1 and higher order patterns with ties not being broken, so more than K cells
  may fire; allowance of more than K cells is necessary for convergence to the correct
  pattern (see Supplementary Material, Topic B). (3) When evidence for two patterns
  is exactly equal, CA3PtrnFnl will contain more than K active cells, and further
  downstream actions will be suppressed. (C) Update mode specifics: (1) EC''in–EC''out
  transmission is enabled bi-directionally (purple top block arrows) so that the representations
  of all currently sampled and recalled attributes will be active in both EC''in and
  ECout. (2) Transmission in a powerful “backward” pathway from CA3′ to DG'' (up-pointing
  purple block arrow) and KTWA control of DG'' firing are enabled. As a result, DG''
  activity mirrors CA3Pfnl, which will be the complete representation with no other
  cells active. (3) EC''in, DG'', CA3′ and CA3′-EC''out synapses become LTP-susceptible,
  and all coactive EC''in-DG'' and CA3′ synapses and all CA3′-ECout synapses become
  potentiated if they are not already so. As in representation creation, synaptic
  weights of active EC''in synapses on each active DG'' and CA3′ cell are normalized
  to a sum of one. *Information flow in the biological dentate-CA3 pathway is usually
  considered to be only in the forward direction, and therefore the above use of “backward”
  transmission may seem biologically implausible. However, a backward pathway from
  CA3 to dentate has in fact been described (Scharfman, ; Myers and Scharfman, ),
  and there is also some evidence for retrograde chemical signaling across synapses
  in the forward pathway. Contractor et al. () that could imaginably trigger LTP at
  presynaptically active synapses on dentate neurons innervating active CA3 cells.
  We therefore do not consider this computationally motivated feature biologically
  implausible.'
