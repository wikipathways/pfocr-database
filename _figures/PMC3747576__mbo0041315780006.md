caption: Urokinase pathway model. (A) Representation of the unperturbed urokinase
  pathway signaling pathway. (B) Without the presence of Serpine1, an inhibitor of
  both PLAU/urokinase and PLAT/tPA, there is increased cleavage of plasminogen into
  the active plasmin and thus increased breakdown of fibrin clots and hemorrhage compared
  to an unperturbed system. Red T shapes indicate inhibition, and blue arrows indicate
  activation.
