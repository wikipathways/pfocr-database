caption: TLR2/IFN-λ3 protein-protein interaction was performed by using String software.
  The interleukin 6 (IL6) and INF-α, connecting TLR2 and IFN-λ3, can turn on the JAK/STAT
  pathway, the most important pathway in mediating the inflammatory response to HCV
  via induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The final effect of ISGs results in
  antigen presentation and a differential expression profile of certain immunomodulatory
  genes targeting different immune cells and resulting in the polarization of Th1
  and Th2 cells, in the modulation of regulatory T-cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and in the differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) from monocytes (; ; ; ; ).
