caption: 'Temporal changes in cellular metabolite levels related to the central metabolic
  pathway in a synchronized C. merolae culture. Cells were cultured in an inorganic
  photoautotrophic medium and subjected to an LD cycle. The metabolome at indicated
  time points (the onset of the second light period was defined as h 0) was examined
  by CE-MS. The metabolite concentration (y axis; nanomoles/milligram cellular dry
  weight), except for the energy charge, is shown at indicated time points (x axis).
  The energy charge was calculated according to the following equation:  (). Each
  data point represents means ± standard deviations (SD) of results from three independent
  cultures. The red and blue arrows in the diagram indicate that the mRNA encoding
  the corresponding enzyme was upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during
  the night as described in the  legend.'
