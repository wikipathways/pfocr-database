caption: Canonical and non‐canonical TGF‐β signaling. Transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β
  ligands initially bind to TGF‐β receptor(TβR)II, and thereafter recruit TβRI. A
  heteromeric TGF‐β receptor complex is formed in which the TβRII kinase transphosphorylates
  TβRI. A, In canonical TGF‐β signaling, intracellular effectors mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog (SMAD)2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated by TβRI, which thereafter can bind
  to SMAD4. This complex translocates into the nucleus, and together with other co‐factors,
  regulates the expression of TGF‐β target genes in a context dependent manner. A
  negative feedback loop is created through induced expression of inhibitory SMAD7,
  which by partnering with Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor(SMURF) E3 ubiquitin
  ligases, targets the TβRI for ubiquitin‐mediated degradation. B, Non‐canonical TGF‐β
  signaling includes multiple different signaling pathways that are not unique for
  TGF‐β signaling, an overview is given in this figure. TGF‐β can elicit different
  responses in different cell types, depending on the cellular context. In tumor cells,
  TGF‐β/SMAD pathway can induce cytostatic effects through upregulation of cell cycle
  arrest and apoptosis genes. Pro‐tumorigenic effects of TGF‐β occur through SMAD‐dependent
  upregulation of EMT transcription factors and also non‐canonical signaling play
  a role. In hepatic and stellate cells, TGF‐β can induce cytostatic effects, but
  also differentiation and regeneration. During injury, TGF‐β signaling promotes fibrosis
  through e.g. matrix deposition and stimulating EMT. In immune cells, TGF‐β dampens
  immune responses. Cytotoxic effects of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells
  are repressed, while regulatory CD4+ T cells and (immune suppressive) macrophages
  are promoted

  description: Canonical and non‐canonical TGF‐β signaling. Transforming growth factor
    (TGF)‐β ligands initially bind to TGF‐β receptor(TβR)II, and thereafter recruit
