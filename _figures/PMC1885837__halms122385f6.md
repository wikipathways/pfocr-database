caption: TGFβ has been shown to be an important regulator of many of the processus
  leading to tubulointerstitial fibrosis including EMT, cellular infiltration and
  apoptosis leading to tubular atrophy and interstitial accumulation of extracellular
  matrix proteins. Binding of TGFβ to the transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor
  type II (RII) leads to the recruitment-phosphorylation and activation of the type
  I receptor kinase (RI) which in turn, phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad 3 proteins thus
  able to bind Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate the transcription
  of target genes by binding to their specific promoter-sequences. In addition to
  this classical TGFβ signaling pathway there is now increasing evidence that Smad-independent
  pathways like activation of RhoA and p38MAPKs are involved in EMT. Smad3 knockout
  mice are protected against UUO-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis and showed the
  existence of a TGFβ autocrine loop during UUO. Furthermore, UUO on knockout mice
  showed that the production of active TGFβ is controlled by integrins, plasmin and
  decorin.
