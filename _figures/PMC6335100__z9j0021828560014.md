caption: DEPTOR [Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain-containing mTOR-interacting
  protein] as a tumor suppressor. Oncogenic activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) signaling activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and
  reduces the expression and the stability of DEPTOR. Low DEPTOR expression relieves
  inhibition on mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2), which further amplifies
  their activity. The activation of mTORC1 linked to low DEPTOR expression stimulates
  anabolism, growth and proliferation. On the other hand, activation of mTORC2 promotes
  the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced
  protein kinase 1 (SGK1), which increases cell survival and resistance to stress
  and reduces apoptosis. The reduction in DEPTOR expression and the activation of
  AKT signaling promotes cancer by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  cell migration, and metastasis.
