caption: Flow chart for prioritizing candidate small molecules based on OMICS data.
  The first step in prioritization is to obtain two pathway sets. One is cancer-related
  pathways determined by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and the other
  is small molecule-related pathways (SMPs) for each candidate small molecule determined
  by performing pathway-enrichment analysis. The second step is to compute the SE
  scores for each of 1294 small molecules using the two pathway sets and to rank the
  prioritizing small-molecule list according to the SE scores (GEO, Gene Expression
  Omnibus; cmap, Connectivity Map; SE, specificity and effect).
