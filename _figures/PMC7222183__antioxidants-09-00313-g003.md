caption: 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) pathways related to oxidative stress.
  CMT is clinically divided into three main types, the demyelinating form, characterized
  by a decrease in the nervous conduction velocity; axonal CMT, where there is a loss
  in the number of axons and an intermediate clinical form with some decrease in the
  velocity of conduction and a decrease in the number of axons. At least 80 different
  genes are affected in the disease. Some of them produce oxidative stress or mitochondrial
  impairment. MFN2 and GDAP1 are the best known. HSPB8 has been related to the Nrf2
  pathway. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum, GDAP1: ganglioside induced differentiation associated
  protein 1, GSH: glutathione, HSPB8: Small Heat shock protein 8, MFN2: mitofusin
  2, Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
