caption: uPAR can interact with different types of Integrins and participates in the
  activation of the MEK/ERK and Rac pathways, both leading to mesenchymal migration.
  Active, matrix-bound PAI-1 blocks the association of Integrin and uPAR with the
  extracellular matrix and subsequently supports cell blebbing by activating the RhoA
  pathway. If only matrix-bound PAI-1 is available, as in our experimental model,
  the RhoA pathway is activated either through biomechanical transmission (implicating
  an unknown co-actor) or transduction (implicating a transmembrane receptor; altogether
  these events might lead to amoeboid migration.
