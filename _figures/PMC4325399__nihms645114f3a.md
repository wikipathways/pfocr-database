caption: Panel A. Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from L-arginine in endothelial cells
  lining the pulmonary artery by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
  NO is a gaseous radical that diffuses into arterial smooth muscle cells, where it
  binds the reduced (Fe2+) heme-containing prosthetic group of the dimeric enzyme
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Upon binding, NO induces the cleavage of a key
  heme-histidine bond that connects the heme group and His105 residue of sGC’s β-subunit.
  NO-induced disruption of this bond functions as a molecular switch activating sGC.
  Active sGC catalyzes the rapid conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a diffusible second messenger that mediates many
  beneficial physiological effects, notably pulmonary artery vasodilatation.Panel
  B. NO bioavailability is diminished in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This
  loss of NO may be complete or partial and occurs for many reasons, including diminished
  expression or function of eNOS and increased destruction of NO. In addition, sGC
  itself may be dysfunctional in diseases such as PAH. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−), the
  product of NO and superoxide anion, and other reactive oxygen species can oxidize
  and inhibit sGC. Oxidized sGC is relatively NO-insensitive and can become completely
  insensitive to NO if it loses its heme moiety. Pharmacological agents called NO
  stimulators bind a postulated stimulator-binding site present in sGC, thereby enhancing
  the sensitivity of sGC to NO. They can also stimulate sGC in an NO-independent manner.
  However, these agents do require the presence of a heme moiety. Riociguat (Adempas®)
  is an NO stimulator that is approved for treatment of WHO Group 1 and Group 4 pulmonary
  hypertension. A related class of drugs called sGC activators act as substitutes
  for the entire heme-NO complex, and can activate sGC even when it is oxidized and/or
  the heme group is lost. There are currently no clinically approved sGC activators.
  Both sGC stimulators and activators increase the conversion of guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
