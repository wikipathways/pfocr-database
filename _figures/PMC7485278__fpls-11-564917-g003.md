caption: General schema of sugar signaling in carotenoid synthesis. Several evidences
  highlight the relationship between sugar content and carotenogenesis (; ). While
  sucrose appears to be involved chromoplast differentiation (; ), the molecular cascade
  remains unknown. Modulation of ClPHT4;2 expression through bZIP TF, which in turn
  are regulated by sugars and ABA, has been described to be involved in carotenoid
  accumulation during domesticated watermelon ripening (). While sugar catabolism
  can fuel carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by providing precursor building blocks
  through glycolysis, a regulating role over the pathway seems to exist, as demonstrated
  by the effect upon phytoene synthase (PSY) expression (). In addition, sugar effect
  on carotenoid synthesis may also impact its crosstalk with ABA, as carotenoid turnover
  yields apocarotenoids, which serve as ABA precursors.
