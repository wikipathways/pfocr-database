caption: The canonical inflammasome is assembled from intracellular sensor proteins
  in response to PAMPs and DAMPs. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  and results in the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 that are subsequently released
  from the N-GSDMD pore. Active caspase-1 also cleaves GSDMD, releasing N-GSDMD to
  form nonselective pores on the plasma membrane, which allows the release of mature
  IL-1β and IL-18. In the noncanonical pathway, LPS directly binds to pro-caspase-4/5/11,
  resulting in activation of caspase-4/5/11, which cleaves GSDMD to trigger pyroptosis.
  In apoptotic caspase-induced pyroptosis, TNF activates caspase-8, which cleaves
  GSDMC and then induces pyroptosis in cancer cells. In addition, chemotherapeutic
  drugs trigger pyroptosis through the caspase-3/GSDME, caspase 1/GSDMD or caspase-8/GSDMC
  cascades. In the granzyme-A/B-dependent pyroptosis pathway, GzmA and GzmB from NK
  cells and CD8 + T cells enter cancer cells via perforin and recognise GSDMB and
  GSDME, respectively, to induce pyroptosis.
