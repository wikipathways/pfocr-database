caption: Involvement of specific protein kinase C isoform in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.
  In the normal status, activated insulin signaling enhances PKCδ through mTORC1 signaling
  pathway in hepatocytes. Activated PKCδ maintains LDLR protein expression by inhibiting
  expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Under insulin
  resistance status, impaired insulin signaling results in suppression of mTORC1 and
  PKCδ expressions, which enhances PCSK9 expression and promotes LDLR degradation,
  contributing to diabetes-associated dyslipidemia. Hyperglycemia activates PKCβ to
  decrease eNOS activity and increase TGFβ expression, which enhances adhesion molecules,
  such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, expression in ECs. Moreover, Hyperglycemia further promotes
  macrophage inflammation and adhesion to ECs via PKCβ activation. Those data reveal
  that PKCδ and PKCβ play central roles in diabetes-associated atherosclerosis.
