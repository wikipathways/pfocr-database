caption: SP/SA is necessary for Hebbian long-term depressions. In WT spines that contain
  SP/SA, mGluR5 is stabilized by long Homers in the presence of SP. Upon activation
  of mGluR1/5, they trigger the release of phospholipase C (PLC), diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) to activate IP3R and ribosomes. IP3R and ribosomes
  are found on SA, and they release Ca2+ and produce “LTD proteins” in order to promote
  endocytosis of AMPAR (signaling pathway shown in black arrows). NMDAR-LTD requires
  calcium entry from both NMDAR and RYR to activate the calcium-sensitive enzymes
  (calcineurin, PP1), to induce AMPAR internalization (signaling pathway shown in
  green arrows). In SPKO, due to the absence of SP and SA in spines, the postsynaptic
  mechanism of mGluR-LTD is completely switched to presynaptic mechanism through endocannabinoid
  signaling. The endocannabinoid is produced by mGluR1 alone, due to the loss of mGluR5
  in the absence of SP, and retrograde signals back to presynaptic CB1R, leading to
  decreased glutamate release. As for NMDAR-LTD, the loss of RYR in the absence of
  SP/SA impairs intracellular Ca2+ release, leading to improper enzymatic signaling
