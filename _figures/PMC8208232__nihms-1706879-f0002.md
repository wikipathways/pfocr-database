caption: 'the schematic shows the HIV-induced UPR activation in neurons. HIV-mediated
  neurotoxins through infected microglia and astrocytes increase the level of ER-stress
  inducers including: free radicals, imbalance Ca2+, accumulation of free fatty acids
  (FA) as well as triglyceride (TG) that leads to UPR activation. Moreover, accumulation
  of unfolded/misfolded proteins and toxic lipid species such as ceramides is associated
  with HIV toxicity in neurons. Although there is no direct evidence indicating the
  link between UPR and neuronal apoptosis in HAND, it has been suggested that accumulation
  of HIV-induced ER-stress markers (BiP and ATF6) can cause cell death. The luminal
  side of ATF6 and PERK are bound to the BiP which keep them inactivated. Upon UPR
  activation BiP releases from this complex to assist with refolding proteins and
  in response to FA and TG accumulation. Activated ATF6 passes through the nucleus
  and upregulates the ERSE (ER stress response Elements) regulated genes expression
  such as CHOP which activate the apoptosis pathway. IRE1-α also activates in response
  to increased amount of saturated FA and sterol, as well as unfolded protein accumulation.
  In sum, this schematic briefly shows the overlaps between HIV-derived lipid dysregulation
  and accumulation of unfolded proteins in UPR activation(Created with BioRender.com).'
