caption: In normal non-hepatic tissues, miR-34a and miR-34b negatively regulate MAT2A
  expression mainly by suppressing its protein translation. In cancer cells miRNA-34a
  and miR-34b are often down-regulated, releasing the inhibition on MAT2A expression.
  This indirectly raises MAT2B expression as the two proteins interact and stabilize
  each other. Higher MAT2A and MAT2B expression leads to cancer cell growth, migration
  and invasion. Treatment with SAMe or MTA in cancer cells increases the expression
  of miR-34a and miR-34b. Potential mechanisms involved include via lowering DNA methylation
  of miR-34a/b promoters, and inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. SAMe and
  MTA could also suppress MAT2A and MAT2B by other mechanisms not shown. Collectively
  this results in lower MAT2A and MAT2B expression, increased apoptosis, decreased
  cell growth, migration and metastasis.
