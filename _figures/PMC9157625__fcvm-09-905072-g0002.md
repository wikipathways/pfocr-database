caption: Mitochondrial quality control by mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Mitochondrial
  health is maintained through the interaction between mitochondrial dynamics and
  mitophagy which is a selective separation of damaged mitochondria by autophagy.
  Stress induces mitochondrial fission, which divides stress-damaged mitochondria
  by healthy and damaged parts. Damaged mitochondria result in accumulation of PINK1,
  which phosphorylates Mfn2, in turn activating Parkin. Parkin then ubiquitinates
  Mfn2, and the Mfn2-Parkin interaction triggers mitophagy. P62 is recruited and binds
  the Parkin-ubiquitinated substrates, linking them to LC3. Mitochondria are then
  engulfed after elongation of the isolation membrane, referred to as the autophagosome.
  Mitophagy by the PINK1-Mfn2-Parkin signaling pathway is achieved by elimination
  of damaged mitochondria. P, phosphorylation; Ub, Ubiquitination.

  description: Mitochondrial quality control by mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy.
    Mitochondrial health is maintained through the interaction between mitochondrial
    dynamics and mitophagy which is a selective separation of damaged mitochondria
    by autophagy. Stress induces mitochondrial fission, which divides stress-damaged
    mitochondria by healthy and damaged parts. Damaged mitochondria result in accumulation
    of PINK1, which phosphorylates Mfn2, in turn activating Parkin. Parkin then ubiquitinates
    Mfn2, and the Mfn2-Parkin interaction triggers mitophagy. P62 is recruited and
    binds the Parkin-ubiquitinated substrates, linking them to LC3. Mitochondria are
    then engulfed after elongation of the isolation membrane, referred to as the autophagosome.
    Mitophagy by the PINK1-Mfn2-Parkin signaling pathway is achieved by elimination
    of damaged mitochondria. P, phosphorylation; Ub, Ubiquitination.
