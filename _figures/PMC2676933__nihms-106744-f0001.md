caption: Molecular mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration. Normal tau interacts
  with tubulin and stimulates its assembly and stabilizes microtubules. In AD brain,
  because of an imbalance in tau kinase and phosphatase activities and a change in
  its conformation induced by other post-translational changes or mutations as in
  inherited cases of FTDP-17, tau becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated. The abnormally
  hyperphosphorylated tau resulting from any one of the above causes behaves as an
  inhibitory/toxic protein; it not only is unable to stimulate microtubule assembly
  and bind to microtubules, but also sequesters normal tau, MAP 1A / MAP1B and MAP2,
  and leads to inhibition of assembly and disruption of microtubules. The breakdown
  of the microtubule network in the affected neurons compromises axonal transport,
  leading to retrograde degeneration which, in turn, results in dementia. The association
  between the AD P-tau and normal tau in the presence of glycosylation results in
  the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles are ubiquitinated for degradation
  by the non-lysosomal ubiquitin pathway, but apparently this degradation, if any,
  is minimal. Unlike the non-polymerized abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, the neurofibrillary
  tangles are inert but, with disease progression, these lesions grow in size and
  eventually might physically choke the affected cells to death.
