  that are negatively involved in the signaling are indicated with black boxes. (A)
  Yeast RTG-dependent signaling pathway. BMH1/2 are 14-3-3 proteins that bind to MKS1
  when RTG signaling is inactive (Liu et al. ). The figure was modified from Butow
  and Avadhani (). (B) Retrograde signaling pathways involved in G1 phase to S phase
  cell-cycle transition of Drosophila compound eye development. ASK1 is a mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, JNK is a stress-responsive kinase and Foxo is a forkhead transcription
  factor involved in the positive regulation of p27. The figure was modified from

  is an Apetalla2 transcription factor that suppresses the mRNA expression of Light
  Harvesting Chlorophyll a/b Binding (LHCB) protein encoding gene (Koussevitzky et
  al. ). The figure was modified from Woodson and Chory (). (D) How about CMS? X could
  be a gene ectopically overdriven in CMS background like yeast CIT2, where MCAG may
  be the factor that starts the retrograde signaling. X may represent homeobox genes
  that changed expression in alloplasmic CMS plants, or AOX genes that showed abnormal
  up-regulation in rice CMS plant (Fujii et al. ). Y is possibly important for normal
  plant male development like Drosophila CycE, where it is presumed to be suppressed
  by the presence of MCAG.
