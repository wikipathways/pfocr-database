caption: A model summarizing 1O2-induced signaling pathways in the chloroplast. (A)
  Under high L, 1O2 is mainly produced in the GC (PSII RC) by transfer of energy from
  excited triplet state P680 chlorophyll (3P680) to ground state oxygen (3O2) ().
  The 1O2 produced in the PSII RC leads to rapid turnover of the D1 protein () and
  oxidizes β-carotene (). The β-carotene oxidation product β-CC can induce a signaling
  cascade that confers plant tolerance to photo-oxidative stress (). (B) 1O2 produced
  in the PSII RC can also lead to programmed cell death (PCD) via a pathway that involves
  OXI1 kinase and jasmonic acid (JA) (). (C) In the GMs, 1O2 is mainly produced from
  intermediates of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (Pchlide, ProtoIX) (, ) and in lesser
  amounts from free chlorophyll resulting from PSII RC turnover (). 1O2 generated
  from ProtoIX damages the chloroplasts, which are subsequently ubiquitinated and
  degraded. This process involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase PUB4 and is independent
  of the EX1 protein (). (D) However, when 1O2 is produced from Pchlide, EX1 is necessary
  for initiating another signaling transduction cascade (). 1O2 generated from Pchlide
  oxidizes proteins nearby, including EX1. The oxidized EX1 proteins are then cleaved
  by the FtsH protease, and the proteolysis products of the EX1 protein (DEX1) probably
  serve as a signal to induce PCD in young seedlings and growth inhibition in mature
  plants (, ). (E) The 1O2 generated from Pchlide can induce an EX1-independent signaling
  pathway that is suppressed by the SAFE1 protein. The stroma-localized SAFE1 protein
  is a negative regulator and functions as a “protector” of GMs. Without this protector,
  1O2 generated from Pchlide would damage GMs, and the damaged GMs (DGM) would initiate
  EX1-independent signaling and would lead to cell death in young seedlings and growth
  inhibition of mature plants. The signaling cascades suggested by recent studies
  are indicated by solid arrows, while the predicted cascades are shown by dashed
  arrows.
