caption: 'Anticancer strategies targeting lactylation. 1. Target therapy a) Fargesin:
  By targeting key enzymes PKM2 and LDHA in the glycolytic process, it inhibits histone
  lactylation, reducing cell proliferation. b) Tanshinone I: By inhibiting Foxk1/Foxk2,
  the expression of glycolysis-related enzymes, such as LDHA, PFK, HK2 and ENO2, is
  reduced. This inhibition of H3K18la slows down the progression of cancer. c) RJA:
  By inhibiting H3K9la, it reduces the expression of Caspase 8 and Bcl, thereby inhibiting
  LDHA and suppressing the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. d) Demethylzeykasteral:
  By inhibiting H3K9la and H3K56la, it reduces the expression of Bcl, LDHA, and CD133
  proteins, inhibiting cancer stemness. e) Evadomine: It can inhibit HIF-1α lactylation
  on histones, suppress the expression of PD-L1, and promote Sema3A to inhibit angiogenesis.
  f) Honokiol: Targets SIRT3 to inhibit the lactylation of CCNE2, suppressing cell
  autophagy. 2. Immunotherapy 2-DG (as an example): Glycolysis inhibitors reduce the
  production of lactate, thereby inhibiting histone lactylation and consequently enhancing
  the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. 3. Emerging therapy CircXRN2: After binding
  with LATS1, it inhibits the ubiquitination of LATS1, increases LATS1 levels, activates
  the Hippo pathway, and suppresses the Warburg effect in cancer, thereby affecting
  cancer progression'
