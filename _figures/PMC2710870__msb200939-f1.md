caption: Signaling cascades of the RP regulation. (A) Pathway diagram of the signaling
  cascades. There are two positive-feedback pathways (α, β) and two feedforward inhibitory
  pathways for CaMKII activation (γ, δ). (B) Schematic representation of positive-feedback
  system of CaMKII (marked ‘α' in A). After activation by Ca2+/CaM binding, CaMKII
  autophosphorylates Thr286/287 and Thr305/306 (marked by *). Phosphorylation of Thr286/287
  maintains the enzymatic activity without Ca2+/CaM. (C) Phosphorylation of PDE1 by
  CaMKII forms a positive-feedback loop (marked ‘β' in A). CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation
  of PDE1 reduces the affinity to Ca2+/CaM. As a result, PDE activity is reduced,
  leading to augmentation of PKA activity. As PKA activity indirectly supports CaMKII
  activity, reduced PDE1 activity contributes to CaMKII activation.
