caption: (A) EGFR structure and mutations. EGFR consists of three domains namely an
  extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular
  domain consists of four subunits that are responsible for binding to the ligand
  and resulting in dimerization. This results in downstream signaling. The intracellular
  domain consists of tyrosine kinase (TK) and a regulatory domain (RD), which are
  responsible for regulating the signaling and physiological process of the EGFR.
  The TK domain consists of an exon (18–21) that shows mutation. The mutations mainly
  occur at T790M and L858R. (B) Mechanism of inhibiting EGFR. When an EGF ligand binds
  to the PTK site, it results in the activation of the downstream signalling. Two
  different pathways are possible. It can activate PI3K pathway or the RAS pathway.
  PI3K results in the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, which is further followed by the
  activation of mTOR and AKT, whereas RAS activation results in the activation of
  RAF and MEK. Also, there can be activation of JAK-STAT pathway. Whichever pathway
  it follows, there’s an increase in the cell proliferation, differentiation, and
  apoptosis of the cell. In cancer, these downstream signaling are enhanced and hence
  there is uncontrolled cell growth. Therefore, pyrimidine analogues are found to
  inhibit the PTK site where the EGF ligand binds and results in decreasing the downstream
  signaling. This reduction in downstream signaling helps in reducing the cell proliferation
  and differentiation of cancerous cell.
