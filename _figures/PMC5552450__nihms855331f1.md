caption: Glucose is the most highly consumed carbon substrate, and its entry initiates
  glycolysis, which contains several anabolic arms. The pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) directs glucose-derived glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) toward oxidative PPP where
  NADPH is generated. From ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P), the non-oxidative PPP continues,
  supplying building blocks for nucleotide biosynthesis and reversibly exchanging
  metabolites with glycolysis via fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP). Serine and glycine metabolism branches from 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and
  connects central carbon metabolism with one-carbon metabolism. The end product pyruvate
  can be converted to lactate or can enter the TCA cycle in the form of acetyl-CoA,
  which can also be derived from acetate under certain conditions. Glutamine is metabolized
  to glutamate and then α-ketoglutarate, which can enter the TCA cycle for replenishing
  anaplerosis or be reductively metabolized via a carboxylation reaction to fuel de
  novo lipogenesis. Various pathways are altered to sustain the uncontrolled proliferation
  exhibited by cancer cells. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
  Akg, α-ketoglutarate; Cit, citrate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; Oxa, oxaloacetate.
