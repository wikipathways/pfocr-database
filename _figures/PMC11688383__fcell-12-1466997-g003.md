caption: The inflammatory signaling pathway regulated by UPR. IRE1α-dependent sXBP1
  activation during the inflammation of human bronchial epithelia can trigger the
  storage of Ca2+ in the ER and subsequently amplify Ca2+-dependent cytokine generation
  and release. IRE1α activation leads to the recruitment of TRAF2 and ASK-1, which
  activate JNK and NF-κB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines. The
  IRE1/TRAF2/ASK1 complex activates inhibitory κ B kinase, which induces the phosphorylation
  of IκB, leading to the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus and induction of
  expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. PERK signaling can activate the signaling
  of TXNIP, leading to the upregulation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3. PERK modulates
  NF-κB activation and apoptosis by activating the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis. Additionally,
  the activation of ATF6 can cause transient phosphorylation of AKT, leading to the
  activation of NF-κB. ATF6 also positively affects NF-κB activation by inhibiting
  AKT/GSK3β
