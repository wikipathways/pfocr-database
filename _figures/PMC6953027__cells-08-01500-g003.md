caption: The balance of signaling pathways in the regulatory networks of pluripotent
  and teratocarcinoma stem cells. The LIF/JAK/STAT3, ActivinA/Nodal/Lefty/Smad2/3,
  PI3K/AKT, and BMP/Smad2/58 signaling pathways promote the maintenance of pluripotent
  stem cell identity and self-renewal, although the BMP/Smad1/5/8 signaling branch
  contributes to the regulation of pluripotent stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
  The MAPK pathway supports viability and induces differentiation. WNT signaling blocks
  GSK3 activity and stabilizes the expression of pluripotency-specific genes. The
  increased activity of the ActivinA/Nodal/TGFβ/Smad2/3 and BMP/Smad1/5/8 signaling
  pathways activates lineage-specific gene expression and thus induces different embryonic
  lineages. The activity of both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways is significantly
  attenuated during differentiation, but they contribute to the proliferation and
  viability of stem cell descendants. WNT/β-catenin signaling induces differentiation
  through the TCF3-mediated expression of lineage-specific genes. In teratocarcinoma
  stem cells, both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways are up-regulated, whereas
  ActivinA/Nodal/TGFβ/Smad2/3 signaling pathway activity is reduced. Reduced TGFβ
  family signaling pathway activity leads to various rearrangements in gene regulatory
  networks and impairs the differentiation potential of teratocarcinoma stem cells.
