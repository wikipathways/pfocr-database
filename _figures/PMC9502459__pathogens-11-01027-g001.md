caption: HPV oncoproteins interfere with apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms.
  E6 (yellow) induces the proteasomal inactivation of p53, the internal detector of
  cellular stress, and by this activity, it impacts the expression of survivin, YY1
  and Cdc2. E6 also degrades the pro-apoptotic proteins BAK, AIF and c-MYC, and cooperates
  with E5 in inhibiting FAS-mediated apoptosis. By inhibiting TNF-triggered apoptosis,
  E6 effectively abrogates the external apoptotic pathway and by blocking procaspase
  activation, it stops the downstream signaling. E6 also utilizes its PDZ-binding
  motif (PBM) to degrade PDZ domain-containing proteins, leading to the disruption
  of the apoptotic cascade. E7 (blue) abrogates the binding of SIVA-1 to BCL-XL and
  thereby prevents the neutralization of anti-apoptotic effects of BCL-XL. E5 (pink)
  impacts the internal and external apoptotic pathways by inducing the degradation
  of the pro-apoptotic protein BAK, and impairing the signaling from FAS- and TRAIL-ligands.
