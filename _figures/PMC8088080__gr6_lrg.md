caption: Overview of the major immunological signaling events linking atherosclerosis
  and COVID-19 in cardiomyocytes. In response to both dying cells and SARS-CoV-2,
  TLR4 and TLR2 might be initiating inflammatory response by activating MyD88. MyD88
  might be either activating NF-κB pathway or by itself initiating release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines – CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8 and IL-1β which leads to cytokine storm in
  cardiac tissue.
