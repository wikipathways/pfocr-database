caption: Suicide gene delivery system mediated by MSCs. (A) The hsv-tk gene is one
  of the suicide genes employed in MSC-based anti-tumor studies. Nontoxic pro-drug
  GCV is converted into toxic compound GCV-triphosphate (GCV-ppp) due to HSV-TK activity
  in HSV-TK-producing MSCs. GCV-ppp is then delivered to the target tumor cells through
  the gap-junctional system, and it is subsequently incorporated into cell metabolic
  pathways, causing eventual cell death. (B) CD also found its application in MSC-based
  studies. MSCs modified do produce a CD carry-out enzymatic reaction of nontoxic
  pro-drug 5-FC to produce the toxic product 5-FU, which is secreted and reaches target
  tumor cells, eliciting tumor cell death. (C) iCas-9 system. Inducible caspase-9
  system is based on the pro-apoptotic activity of the caspase-9 delivered to the
  target tumor cell by adenoviral transfection. First, MSCs are genetically engineered
  to produce an invasive form of adenoviral construct containing the icas-9 gene.
  After target tumor cell delivery, iCas-9 protein is effectively produced followed
  by the small-molecule CID stimulation, which triggers iCas-9 dimerization and apoptosis
  pathway induction. 5-FC, 5-fluorocytosine; 5-fluorouracil; CD, cytosine deaminase;
  CID, chemical inducer of dimerization; GCV, Ganciclovir; HSV-TK, herpes simplex
  virus-thymidine kinase.
