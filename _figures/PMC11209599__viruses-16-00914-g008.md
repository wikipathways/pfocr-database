caption: The hypothesis that ISKNV triggered ROS-mediated stress signals both modulate
  the autophagic flux pathway and anti-oxidants response on enhancement of viral replication
  in fish cells. The ISKNV shows a novel approach, using ROS-mediated stress response
  that can either activate the AMPK/mTOR autophagy signaling pathway via phosphorylation
  or induce the oxidative defense stress signal in the early replication stages in
  fish cells. The ISKNV-induced AMPK/mTOR autophagy signaling pathway is primed by
  ROS-mediated stress signals on either phosphorylation of AMPK on threonine 172 or
  suppresses phosphorylation of mTOR on serine 1448 for autophagy induction. On the
  other hand, the oxidative stress response also upregulates the stress transcriptional
  factor Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/MnSOD (SOD1) and ZnSOD (SOD2), which
  are correlated with metabolized ROS, such as superoxide, for the recovery of biological
  functions in proteins. Thus, ISKNV induced ROS-mediated AMPK/mTOR autophagy pathway
  on enhanced viral replication that can be inhibited by treatment with antioxidants
  NAC, which provides a novel strategy for viral control
