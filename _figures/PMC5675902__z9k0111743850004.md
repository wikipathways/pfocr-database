caption: 'Summary of studies and new suggested working model of the Q pathway to pMF.
  A: former working model of the Q pathway to pMF in which Gq-coupled receptors elicit
  complex downstream signaling. The initiating receptor was initially postulated to
  signal via PKCθ, leading to new BDNF synthesis with subsequent TrkB receptor activation.
  Downstream signaling was thought to be dependent on TrkB induced MEK/ERK signaling,
  ultimately leading to pMF (; ; ; ). B: we activated the Q pathway by pharmacologically
  manipulating key proteins involved in the signaling cascade leading to pMF (BDNF/TrkB).
  We administered inhibitors that blocked the three canonical TrkB signaling pathways
  including MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and PLC/PKC (PKCθ), followed by intrathecal BDNF administration
  to elicit pMF. C: present study demonstrates that PKCθ is the only pathway necessary
  for BDNF/TrkB induced pMF. Thus our working model of the Q pathway to pMF (A) requires
  revision; MEK/ERK must be signaling upstream from BDNF/TrkB signaling, whereas PKCθ
  is a downstream mediator (C).'
