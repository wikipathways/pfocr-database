caption: Mechanisms of Cell Death in Reperfused Myocardial InfarctionA schematic illustration
  of mechanisms contributing to multiple cell death pathways attributable to necrosis,
  necroptosis, apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis and pyroptosis. Necrosis is the cell
  death which is morphologically characterized by rupture of mitochondria, rupture
  of the sarcolemma and an inflammatory response.14,16,97 Traditionally, all IS which
  was quantified by lack of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining98 or gadolinium
  contrast enhancement in CMR99 was considered as necrosis. It is currently unclear
  to which extent the novel, more regulated modes of cell death are reflected in lack
  of TTC staining or contrast-enhanced CMR. Apoptosis is, in strong contrast to necrosis,
  morphologically characterized by lack of sarcolemmal rupture and lack of an inflammatory
  reaction; the nucleus displays chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and
  mitochondria are small and rounded. Necroptosis shares features with both necrosis
  and apoptosis, is characterized by sarcolemmal rupture but still a regulated mode
  of cell death which is initiated by sarcolemmal receptors, resulting in a characteristic
  necrosome complex of receptor-interacting protein kinase, death domain proteins
  and caspases which induce cytoplasmic and organelle disintegration.100,101 Pyroptosis
  is an "inflammatory" mode of cell death in response to damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) such as mitochondrial DNA and pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) such as endotoxins.102,103 Ferroptosis was originally related to iron overload
  and the generation of reactive oxygen species but is now more precisely related
  to a deficiency or reduced activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). This reduction
  of GPX4 activity increases the formation reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause
  lipid peroxidation and damage to cellular organelles and sarcolemma.104,105 Autophagy
  differs from the other regulated modes of cell death in that it serves primarily
  a physiological function, that is, the removal and re-circulation of damaged cellular
  organelle material, notably mitochondria, through a signaling pathway which centers
  on the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and induces the formation
  of double-membrane autophagosome vesicles.106, 107, 108 Adapted with permission
