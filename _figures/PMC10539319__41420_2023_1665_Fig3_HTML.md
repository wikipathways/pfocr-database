caption: There are two forms of iron circulation in the seminiferous tubules (SFT).
  First, extracellular iron enters the Sertoli cells of the testis through the TF-TFR1
  pathway, which is the main route of exogenous iron intake in Sertoli cells. As with
  other iron metabolic pathways, exogenous TBI is transported to Sertoli cells, and
  TBI is transported to endosomes. The FPN in Sertoli cells is responsible for iron
  release into the SFT gap. Sertoli cells synthesize and secrete CP, which oxidizes
  ferrous iron in the SFT gap to TF-bound iron. Iron output to the basement membrane
  of the SFT also requires TF, which is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum of
  Sertoli cells. Fe3+ binds to newly synthesized TF and is uptaken by spermatogenic
  cells into the circulation of iron. The second type of iron is derived from transport
  among spermatogenic cells at all levels. Iron is absorbed by spermatogonia and preleptotene
  spermatocytes through the TF-TFR1 pathway, and it is continuously transferred to
  round spermatids via different mechanisms. Eventually, round spermatids release
  some of the iron, which circulates to the apical compartment of Sertoli cells, and
  the rest of the iron is carried away by elongated spermatids. In addition, mitochondria
  in mature spermatozoa are phagocytosed by Sertoli cells in the form of residual
  bodies, and Sertoli cells store the iron in ferritin and return it to the iron cycle
  of primary spermatocytes, thereby completing the autonomous cycle of iron transport
  in the SFT. The loss of iron during spermatogenesis is compensated for by the absorption
  of exogenous iron. In addition to iron metabolism disorders, xCT/GPX4 system disturbances,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may increase the
  susceptibility to ferroptosis in the testis. Some transcription factors, such as
  NRF2, regulate genes related to ferroptosis under oxidative stress. ACSL4 acyl-CoA
