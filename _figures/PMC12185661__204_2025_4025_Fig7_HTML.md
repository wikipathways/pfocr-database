caption: A proposed mode by which low concentrations of BPA suppress the TR transcription.
  I. The direct genomic signaling pathway is the conventional route of GR-mediated
  signaling. It involves the direct binding of GR to GRE sequences, either alone or
  in conjunction with TF. II. The non-genomic signaling pathway is initiated by the
  binding of a ligand to GR located in the plasma membrane, which leads to the activation
  of several protein kinase cascades. GR glucocorticoid receptor; TF transcription
  factor; RE response element; GRE glucocorticoid response element; PI3K phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; Akt protein kinase B; PKA protein kinase A; PKC protein kinase C; CaMKII
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
