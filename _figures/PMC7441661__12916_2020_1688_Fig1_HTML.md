caption: Metabolic signaling of insulin is anabolic. Insulin signaling through the
  insulin receptor engages several pathways and results in an anabolic state of metabolism.
  The canonical pathway via phosphokinases PI3K and AKT/PKB promotes glucose uptake
  and glycogen and lipid syntheses, whereas lipolysis is inhibited in adipocytes,
  as well as hepatic gluconeogenesis. In addition, AKT kinases activate mTORC1 which
  supports de novo lipogenesis and protein synthesis. The insulin signaling pathway
  via SHC and the MAP kinases MEK and ERK promotes cell proliferation and protein
  synthesis. Another insulin signaling pathway involves NOX4 and the inhibition of
  PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K-AKT pathway
