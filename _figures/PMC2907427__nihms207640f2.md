caption: Glycolysis (blue) metabolizes glucose to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in
  an NAD+-dependent manner. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetate dissimilation requires the Pta-AckA pathway (red).
  The enzyme PTA (phosphotransacetylase) converts acetyl-CoA and inorganic phosphate
  (Pi) into coenzyme A (CoA) and the high-energy pathway intermediate acetyl phosphate
  (acetyl-P). The enzyme ACKA (acetate kinase) converts acetyl-P and ADP to acetate
  and ATP. The acetate freely diffuses across the cell envelope into the environment.
  Acetate assimilation (green) requires the high-affinity enzyme ACS (acetyl-CoA synthetase).
  In a two-step process that involves an enzyme-bound intermediate (acetyl-AMP), Acs
  converts acetate, ATP, and CoA into AMP, pyrophosphate (PPi), and acetyl-CoA. The
  acetyl-CoA replenishes the NAD+-dependent tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (orange).
  Mammalian ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) uses ATP and CoA to convert the TCA cycle intermediate
  citrate into oxaloacetate (OAA), ADP, Pi, and acetyl-CoA (purple). Figure adapted
  from ().
