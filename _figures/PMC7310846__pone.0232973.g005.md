caption: 'Inspection of the individual GOs revealed additional insight in the complexity
  of energy metabolism in P. laevis. Amongst others, Trinotate associated many P.
  laevis transcripts directly (without parent terms) with corresponding GO terms (),
  including genes like Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein and Long-chain fatty
  acid transport protein 4. In addition, there were many GOs referring to coenzyme
  A, which is commonly known to transfer carbons into the Krebs cycle. Pomphorhynchus
  laevis should additionally be capable of lactic acid fermentation (), just as reported
  for Moniliformis dubius []. However, with only a single P. laevis transcript pointing
  to such an engagement (see : D-lactate dehydrogenase), the pathway should be of
  less significance than in platyhelminths, which have a high number of lactate dehydrogenase
  genes []. Furthermore, the annotation of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase could point
  to the excretion of acetate, which before was observed in the archiacanthocephalan
  M. dubius [] and other parasitic taxa [].'
