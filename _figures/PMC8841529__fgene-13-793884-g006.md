caption: The Late response and pathway choice. (A) 53BP1-dependent recruitment of
  PTIP recruits Artemis to sites of DSBs for slow-kinetic cNHEJ. (B) Recruitment of
  BRCA1 to sites of DSBs can be BARD1-dependent, RAP80-dependent, MRN-dependent (not
  shown) or PARP1-dependent (not shown). (C) Recruitment of RIF1 and Shieldin to 53BP1.
  (D) 53BP1, RIF1, and Shieldin can block resection, or recruit the CST-Polα primase
  complex for gap fill-in, promoting the fidelity of both slow-kinetic cNHEJ and HR.
  (E) Schematics or structures of PTIP, Artemis, RAP80, RIF1, Sheildin and CST- CST-Polα
  primase. Where known structure is superimposed within overall architecture as illustrated.
  (i) PTIP is recruited to phosphorylated 53BP1. (ii) Artemis is the nuclease responsible
  for the 1–5 nt resection required for slow-kinetic cNHEJ. (iii) RAP80 can bind to
  polyubiquitination of H2A(X)K13 and H2A(X)K15 to recruit BRCA1. (iv) RIF1 forms
  a dimer via its large N-terminal domain, which can also bind directly to DNA (not
  shown), and interacts with 53BP1 via phosphorylation. (v) The Shieldin complex is
  made up of SHLD1, SHLD2, SHLD3, and REV7. REV7 and SHLD3 undergo conformational
  changes that facilitate their interaction, the so-called ‘seatbelt’ interaction.
  (vi) The CST complex forms a decameric supercomplex containing CTC1, STN1, and TEN1
  () and interacts with Polα-primase. Polα-primase itself is composed of two subunits
  A and B.
