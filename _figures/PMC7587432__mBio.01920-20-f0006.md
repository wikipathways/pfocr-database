caption: Model depicting the role of 5-PP-IP5 in CDK stability and PHO pathway activation
  in C. neoformans. The binding of 5-PP-IP5 to the SPX domain of Pho81 in C. neoformans
  promotes Pho81 association with Pho80-Pho85 (A) and Pcl6/7-Pho85 (B). 5-PP-IP5,
  which is negatively charged, forms electrostatic interactions with the lysine surface
  cluster in the SPX domain of native Pho81 and with unidentified basic residues in
  cyclins Pho80 and Pcl6/7 and therefore stabilizes each CDK complex irrespective
  of phosphate status. In panel A, 5-PP-IP5-bound Pho81 inhibits Pho85 during phosphate
  deprivation, preventing phosphorylation of Pho4 and triggering PHO pathway activation
  to promote pathogenicity. In contrast, 5-PP-IP5 binding-defective Pho81 cannot form
  a stable complex with Pho80-Pho85 and Pho85 remains active, phosphorylating Pho4
  to prevent PHO pathway activation. In panel B, 5-PP-IP5-bound Pho81 may also regulate
  Pcl6-Pho85 to fine-tune glycogen metabolism. In both panels A and B, 5-PP-IP5 binding-defective
  Pho81 is unstable and becomes degraded.
