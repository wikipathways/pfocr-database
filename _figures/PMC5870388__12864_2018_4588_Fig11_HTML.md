caption: A model depicts inhibitory effect of heat stress on growth of tall fescue
  and improved growth by exogenous melatonin (MT) and 24-epibrassinolide (EBL). Heat
  stress affected nucleotide metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism,
  polyamine metabolism, redox, hormone pathway, energy pathway, and regulated expression
  of stress responsive genes, resulting in inhibited photosynthesis, increased cell
  damage, degradation of protein and other macromolecules, and increased ROS content.
  Growth of tall fescue was then inhibited. However, exogenous application of chemicals
  like MT and EBL modulated expression of stress responsive genes, as well as genes
  involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, and then alleviated inhibitory
  effects of heat stress, leading to improved growth of tall fescue plants
