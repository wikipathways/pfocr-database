caption: Pathophysiology of inflammation-induced depression. Activation of innate
  immunity by binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (e.g., lipopolysaccharide)
  to Toll-like receptors and inflammasome elements induce the production and release
  of proinflammatory cytokines at the periphery, which in turn recruit immune-to-brain
  communication pathways and activate microglia. Activated microglia produce and release
  proinflammatory cytokines that organize the sickness response to pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (not represented in the figure). Activation of indoleamine 2,3
  dioxygenase at the periphery increases kynurenine that is transported into the brain
  by LAT1 and metabolized into neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites (e.g., quinolinic
  acid) at the level of activated microglia via a series of enzymatic reactions initiated
  by mitochondrial kynurenine monooxygenase. Quinolinic acid alone or in combination
  with extracellular glutamate released by activated microglia activates N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptors.
