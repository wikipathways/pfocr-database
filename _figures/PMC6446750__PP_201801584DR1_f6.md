caption: A model explains the interaction between BCAA catabolism and TAG homeostasis
  in Chlamydomonas. Blue lines indicate potential flow of reducing equivalents; red
  lines indicate flow of ATP and black lines indicate carbon flow. When N starved,
  the free AA pool in cells is depleted. The degradation of some of these free AAs,
  namely BCAAs, produces acetyl-CoA as well as NADH, which is fed into the mitochondrial
  respiratory chain. The production of acetyl-CoA and ATP from BCAA catabolism contributes
  to TAG synthesis during N starvation. In addition, upon N resupply in the dark,
  the production of ATP through the BCAA catabolic pathway becomes essential to initiate
  the β-oxidation of fatty acids, as its earlier steps require two molecules of ATP
  (first, the transport of free fatty acids into peroxisomes is an ATP-requiring reaction,
  catalyzed by the ABC transporter called comatose [CTS]; second, the activation of
  free fatty acids to their CoA esters is an ATP-dependent reaction, catalyzed by
  long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase [LACS]). Furthermore, BCAA could also play a regulatory
  role in governing lipid homeostasis. ETC, Electron transport chain; FA, fatty acid;
  FAS, fatty acid synthase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
