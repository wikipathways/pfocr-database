caption: The lysosomal system refers to the autophagic pathway and the endocytic pathway,
  and mediates the transport and proteolytic degradation of cellular waste. In the
  endocytic pathway, early endosomes (EE) mature into late endosomes (LE) prior to
  full acidification (Lysosome). In the autophagic (macroautophagy) pathway, a preautophagosomal
  structure (PAS) is formed, enveloping an area of cytoplasm or a selected substrate,
  and developing into a double-membrane autophagosome (AP). Lysosomes fuse with autophagosomes,
  generating single-membrane autolysosomes (AL), and ultimately lysosomes. Upon fusion
  with autophagosomes, lysosomes introduce proteolytic enzymes which carry out the
  degradation of substrates as the compartment becomes more acidic. The acidification
  of these compartments is mediated by the v-ATPase. Chaperone-mediated autophagy
  (CMA) is another type of autophagy, during which a chaperone protein complex (Hsc70
  complex) recognizes a cytoplasmic target protein via a KFERQ motif, and shuttles
  the target protein to the lysosomal lumen for digestion via interaction with the
  LAMP2 protein complex, which serves as the lysosomal CMA receptor. (Figure modified
