caption: Two pathways of antigen presentation underlying initiation of type 1 diabetes.
  In the islet of Langerhans, the resident macrophages are in close contact with the
  β cells. This “β cell-macrophage synapse” involves extensive membrane activities
  and results in passage of β cell granules to the macrophages. In the context of
  autoimmunity, the macrophages that take up the granules adequately present β cell
  antigens to the T cells that have entered the islets (intra-islet pathway), a key
  process in mediation of local inflammation. The physiological roles of the macrophages
  at the steady state are less well understood. One possibility is to sense phlogogens
  in the blood and orchestrate the defense against pathogens. The β cells spontaneously
  generate insulin peptides in a set of vesicles termed crinophagic bodies. The crinophagic
  pathway is a natural mechanism by which the β cells catabolize excessive production
  of regular insulin dense core granules. In response to glucose, these catabolized
  products are released into circulation and can be presented by APCs in the secondary
  lymphoid tissues and recognized by T cells (peripheral pathway). Although the effects
  of the released peptides in T cell biology are not completely understood, one indicator
  T cell acquires an activation phenotype that promotes diabetogenicity. APC, antigen
  presenting cell ; MHC-II, major histocompatibility complex II; TCR, T cell receptor.
