caption: Neuroendocrine Evolution and drug resistance mechanism of prostate cancer.
  Evolution of NEPC. On the one hand, under the pressure of endocrine therapy, adenocarcinoma
  cells with reduced or no AR expression undergo neuroendocrine transformation; on
  the other hand, neuroendocrine cells in the prostate gland that share a common origin
  with basal and official cells progress directly to NEPC. Among them, lncRNAs can
  participate in the transformation of prostate cancer to NEPC by regulating the NED
  process; lnc RNAs can also mediate the resistance process of enzalutamide through
  the epigenetic pathway, the AR pathway, and related non-AR pathways. AR, androgen
  receptor; ADT, androgen deprivation therapy; NED, neuroendocrine differentiation;
  CRPC, castration-resistant prostate cancer; NEPC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer;
  lncRNAs, Long noncoding RNAs
