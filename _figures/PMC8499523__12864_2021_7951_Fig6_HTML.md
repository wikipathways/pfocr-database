caption: Acrylamide exposure leads to the activation of immune-associated gene networks.
  A, B Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to construct gene interaction networks
  taking into account cellular localisation that connected key genes (white) with
  differentially regulated genes (red = up-regulated, green = down-regulated) and
  enriched categories of diseases and functions. Networks predicted from these data
  include A haematological system development (16 differentially regulated genes),
  and B haematological system development and function and immune cell trafficking
  (14 differentially regulated genes). Initial construction of the network was created
  in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and schematics were redrawn using BioRender software
