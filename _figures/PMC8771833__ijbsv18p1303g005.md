caption: Downstream of Slit-Robo Signaling in Bone Metabolism. (A) When Slit binds
  to Robo, Slit-Robo GTPase activating protein (srGAP) is recruited to the intracellular
  domain of the Robo receptor, resulting in inactivation of Rho GTPase, which inhibits
  actin polymerization and stress fiber formation and affects cell polarity and cell
  movement. Slit2 mainly inhibits Cdc42 GTPase, while Slit3 mainly inhibits Rac1 GTPase.
  (B) In osteoclasts, activated Rac1 can stimulate the expression of Slit3. Slit3
  acts on osteoclasts in an autocrine way, binds with Robo1 and recruits srGAP2 to
  form a complex, and inhibits the activation of Rac1 to form a negative feedback
  loop. (C) After binding to the Slit ligand, the Robo protein forms a multimolecular
  complex with Abl kinase, adaptor protein cables, N-cadherin and β-catenin. Then,
  Abl kinase phosphorylates β-catenin on tyrosine 489, resulting in the release of
  N-cadherin-related β-catenin, leading to the loss of N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion.
  The released β-catenin can also enter the nucleus to activate target genes and regulate
  the life activities of cells.
