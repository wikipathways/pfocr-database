caption: 'Included are glycolysis (blue), the glyoxylate cycle (rose), fermentation
  (green), and the citric acid cycle (orange), as well as the connecting steps between
  the pathways. Also shown are the routes for entry of galactose and glycerol catabolic
  products into the core glycolysis pathway. Abbreviations not described in the text
  are as follows: Fru-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Fru-1,6-BP, fructose-1,6-bisphophate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 1,3-BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  2-PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Gal-6-P, galactose-6-phosphate;
  Glu-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; UDP-Glu, UDP-glucose; UDP-Gal, UDP-galactose; Acetyl-Carn,
  acetylcarnitine; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; Succ-CoA, succinyl-CoA; GUT2, mitochondrial
  G3P dehydrogrenase; ETC, electron transport chain.'
