caption: Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence of hedgehog ligand, Ptch
  inhibits Smo, resulting in formation of Gli repressor that inhibits target genes.
  Ptch and SUFU function as tumor suppressors. Hedgehog ligand’s interaction with
  Ptch results in its degradation, allowing a signaling cascade mediated by Smo that
  forms GliA. This transcription factor activates genes associated with tumor proliferation.
  Inhibitors of Smo represent a potential therapeutic target against GSCs. GliA—Gli
  activator, GliR—gli repressor, HH—hedgehog ligand, Ptch—Patched, Smo—smoothened,
  SUFU—Suppressor of fused homolog.
