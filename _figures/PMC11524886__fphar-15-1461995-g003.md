caption: Schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms by which exercise-mediated
  release of irisin exerts antidepressant effects. Exercise induces FNDC5 expression
  in skeletal muscle. The FNDC5 protein is subsequently cleaved to irisin, which enters
  the brain by crossing the BBB. Irisin can increase BDNF production by activating
  cAMP/PKA/CREB, PGC-1/FNDC5 signaling. Irisin inhibits NF-κB phosphorylation through
  downregulation of TLR4/MyD88 pathway, induces the conversion of M1-type macrophages
  to M2-type macrophages, and activates the BDNF/ERK/CREB pathway, thereby reducing
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, irisin reduces ROS production
  by activating the BDNF/UCP2 and AKT/ERK pathways and by inhibiting the ROS-NLPR3
  inflammatory signaling pathway
