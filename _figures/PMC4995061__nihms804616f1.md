caption: Norepinephrine, a catecholamine synthesized and released by the sympathetic
  nervous system, binds and activates α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors (α1R and α2R)
  on target cells. This process results in the recruitment of the G proteins Gq and
  Gi and subsequent downstream activation of phospholipase-C (PLC) by α1R or inhibition
  of adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways by α2R, effects that
  both promote ERK activation. α1R- and α2R-mediated activation of ERK induces arterial
  gene programming, in part, through increasing the expression of EfnB2, Dll4, Nrp1
  and negatively regulating the expression of venous-associated genes EphB4, CoupTFII,
  and Apj. VEGF-mediated ERK activation is also known to positively regulate arterial
  endothelial cell fate, although how sympathetic innervation interacts with this
  pathway is not clear.
