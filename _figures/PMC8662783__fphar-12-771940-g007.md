caption: 'Hypothetical mechanisms of LCA-conferred cardio-protection against obesity-related
  AF. Possible mechanism proposed in this study: HFD-induced imbalance between FAs
  uptake and expenditure causes lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity, which triggers
  a set of chain reactions, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, inflammation and
  insulin resistance, and finally contributing to atrial remodeling and greater propensity
  for AF. Promotion of FAO via LCA combats obesity-induced AF by reducing myocardial
  lipotoxicity, alleviating atrial remodeling, including left atrial dilatation, cardiac
  hypertrophy, gap junction remodeling and interstitial fibrosis. Mechanistically,
  LCA supplement amended lipid metabolism through AMPK-dependent pathway. STD, standard
