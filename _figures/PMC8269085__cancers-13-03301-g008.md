caption: A schematic model of OK-432-induced IFN-γ production via the CD40-IL-12 axis
  in PBMCs (A) and its inhibition by CM derived from oral cancer cells (B). OK-432
  upregulates CD40 and CD40L expression. Binding of CD40 on antigen-presenting cells
  and CD40L on activated T cells may induce the expression of IL-12p40, which associates
  with IL-12p35 to produce IL-12. Secreted IL-12 may induce the production of IFN-γ,
  and then promotes T cell differentiation and activation. CM including uncertain
  soluble factor(s) suppresses the CD40/CD40L–IL-12 axis.
