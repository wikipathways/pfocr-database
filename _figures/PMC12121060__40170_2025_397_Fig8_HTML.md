caption: Schematic diagram showing FH signaling pathway in breast cancer. FH promotes
  breast cancer cell proliferation through upregulation of OCR, which results in upregulated
  ROS production. ROS further inhibits p21, which leads to upregulated MMP1 and p-ERK
  protein expression, resulting in upregulated cell proliferation and migration ability
  of breast cancer cells. Therefore, tumor growth and metastasis are enhanced
