caption: 'Major pathways of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells include cholesterol
  biosynthesis, uptake, efflux, and esterification. Cholesterol is synthesized through
  the mevalonate pathway in the ER in an extremely complex process: It starts with
  acetyl-CoA, then mevalonate and squalene are synthesized, and finally cholesterol
  is generated. Cholesterol uptake depends on the LDLR-mediated endocytosis pathway.
  Cholesterol efflux is mediated by ABCA1 and ABCG1. Cholesterol is a precursor of
  CEs, which are generated via the action ACAT1. The transcription of cholesterol
  metabolism-related genes (such as HMGCR, LDLR, ABCA1, and ABCG1) is mediated by
  mature SREBP-2. SREBP-2 is cleaved to form mature SREBP-2 in the Golgi apparatus.'
