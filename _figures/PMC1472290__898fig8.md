caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the interactions between FLC and the photoperiod
  pathway in the leaf and meristem and the effect of vernalization on these interactions.
  Prior to vernalization (diagram on left), FLC acts in the leaf to repress transcription
  of FT and of other genes that are illustrated as X. In the meristem, FLC represses
  transcription of FD and of SOC1. Vernalization reduces FLC expression both in the
  leaf and the meristem. Removal of FLC from the leaves causes FT and X to be expressed.
  FT controls a systemic signal (shown in blue) that is required for SOC1 expression
  at the meristem. FT mRNA was recently proposed to move from the leaves to the meristem
  during floral induction (), and therefore this signal might be comprised of FT mRNA.
  FD is also required at the meristem for SOC1 expression, and because FT and FD interact
  (; ), this heterodimer might activate SOC1 expression directly or indirectly. FD
  expression at the meristem also rises during floral induction. The increase in FD
  expression does not require FT but is blocked by expression of FLC in the leaves.
  Therefore we propose that in the leaves, FLC blocks expression of X, which controls
  a second systemic signal (shown in red) that increases FD expression at the meristem.
  The reduction of FLC expression in the meristem during vernalization allows FD and
  SOC1 expression in the meristem to rise in response to the X signal and FT/FD, respectively.
