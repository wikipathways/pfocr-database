caption: Relative contribution of 13C tracers to amino acids from hydrolyzed cell
  protein and glycogen of A. gossypii B2 grown on complex medium with rapeseed oil.
  The 13C labeling patterns of the amino acids were obtained at the end of the growth
  phase after 36 h. Respective contribution of [U13C] yeast extract (purple), [13C5] glutamate
  (light blue), and other media components (grey) are depicted by the bar next to
  the respective amino acid. The full length bar represents 100%. Data represent summed
  fractional labelings (SFLcorr), corrected for natural labeling and dilution effects
  through unlabeled pre-culture medium. Data were obtained from three independent
  replicates. Note that the conversion of citrate to isocitrate via aconitase most
  likely does not occur in the peroxisome []. 3PG, 3-phosphoplycerate; CH2-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
