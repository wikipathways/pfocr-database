caption: Schematic representation of the role of mitoROS-PKCδ-mediated endoplasmic
  reticulum stress (ERS)-dependent induction of the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis in
  response to the αSynagg-induced reactive microglial activation state. The treatment
  of microglial cells with αSynagg triggers mitoROS and PKCδ activation resulting
  in ERS-dependent activation of proinflamamtory signaling events including the TXNIP/NLRP3
  activation response. Both mitochondria-driven oxidative stress and PKCδ activation
  contribute to the αSynagg-induced reactive microglial activation state via ERS through
  a feed-forward mechanism. An association between TXNIP and NLRP3 may partly explain
  the NLRP3 inflammasome-associated innate immune response. Moreover, αSynagg-induced
  microglial ERS causes indirect DAergic neurotoxicity. Importantly, Mitoapo and PKCδ-silencing
  suppress ERS and the associated TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis in response to αSynagg,
  thereby attenuating the reactive microglial activation state. Finally, salubrinal
  (SAL) attenuated the indirect DAergic neurotoxicity elicited by αSynagg, further
  highlighting the pivotal role of ERS in the expression of a neurodegenerative microglial
  phenotype and associated DAergic neurotoxicity.
