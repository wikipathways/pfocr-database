caption: (A). Cross-talk between NGF signaling and INFS. NGF stimulates the MAP/ERK
  pathway resulting in increased RSK1 activity , , which is known to promote the release
  of newly synthesized FGFR1 from pre-Golgi membranes into the cytosol and accumulation
  in the cell nucleus . RSK1 binding to FGFR1 in the nucleus decreases FGFR1 mobility
  promoting the FGFR1 nuclear retention accumulation . Increased nuclear FGFR1 correlates
  with FGFR1 interaction with Nur proteins ,  and Nurs also decrease nuclear FGFR1
  movement . The FGFR1/Nur complexes generated by NGF stimulation activate Nur-responsive
  sites on diverse genes. In addition, upregulation of fgf-2 mRNA by NGF () could
  also contribute to FGFR1 nuclear trafficking since the nuclear accumulation and
  retention of FGFR1 is facilitated by its ligand FGF-2 ,  (not shown on diagram).
  (B) The end-point ssTF of NGF stimulation, in addition to Nurs, include CREB, AP1,
  and NFKB . The same end-point factors were shown to be activated by nuclear FGFR1
  through the CBP/RSK1-dependent feed forward mechanism . This common INFS step may
  enable coordinated programing of diverse genes necessary for NGF-induced neuronal
  differentiation.
