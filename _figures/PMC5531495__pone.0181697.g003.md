caption: Metabolites were mapped to a pathway database (in this case Reactome), and
  nodes, representing pathways (identified by pathway name in the database), is proportional
  to the number of metabolites contained in the pathway. Node colour intensity is
  associated to hypergeometric test accounting number of metabolites associated with
  home range and those potentially present in the specific pathway (node), while as
  edge width represent the percentage of shared metabolites between pathways and edge
  colour indicate the number of metabolites associated with home range.
