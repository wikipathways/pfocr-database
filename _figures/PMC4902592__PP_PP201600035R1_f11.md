caption: Preliminary model of ILK1’s roles during stress. A, A model of possible signaling-related
  functions of ILK1 in -triggered innate immunity. After flg22 recognition by BAK1-FLS2,
  Ca2+ influxes trigger anion export, which depolarizes the membrane and induces K+
  efflux. Calcium sensors such as CML9 may modulate ILK1 kinase activity that phosphorylates
  HAK5 or other signaling molecules to activate an unknown signaling pathway. This
  pathway, which may involve K+-sensing to repress early MPK3/MPK6 signaling, has
  a net positive effect on plant innate immunity and regulates growth in response
  to . Flg22-triggered membrane depolarization involves rapid activation of several
  unknown channels, which may include GLR3.3 and are influenced by HAK5 and ILK1 in
  a kinase-independent manner. B, A model of proposed ILK1 roles in potassium transport
  for plant responses to abiotic stress. During osmotic stress and limited K+ supply,
  ILK1 and CML9 promote HAK5 maturation and transport to the membrane. Low intracellular
  K+ concentrations lead to accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ and signaling through
  CML9/ILK1 or CBLs/CIPK23, which activate HAK5.
