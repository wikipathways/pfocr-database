caption: 'MPC mesengenic and angiogenic differentiation pathways are mutually exclusive.
  Mesangiogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) are isolated in vitro as quiescent adherent
  cells with a unique morphology resembling that of cultured macrophages (A). Following
  the induction of mesenchymal differentiation (B), MPCs rapidly activate the non-canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway and start to proliferate as flat and multi-branched cells
  (B.1). As a result of canonical Wnt signaling activation, cells acquire the definitive
  MSC phenotype and functions (B.2). Under angiogenic stimuli and independently of
  Wnt signaling activation (C), MPCs proliferate and sprout from spheroids in 3D cultures,
  resembling the activity of endothelial tip cells (C.1). Once sprouted, MPCs acquire
  the ability to form capillary-like tubes in vitro (C.2). These two differentiation
  pathways are mutually exclusive, and shortly after mesengenic induction (B), MPCs
  lose their angiogenic potential, and vice versa. (MSCs: mesenchymal stromal cells,
  CLMDZ: calmidazolium chloride)'
