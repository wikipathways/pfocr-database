caption: Schematic representation of the leptin-induced pathways. After leptin binds
  to the long isoform of the leptin receptor (LepRb), Jak2 is activated at the box
  1 motif, resulting in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues and phosphorylation
  of tyrosines that provide docking sites for signaling proteins containing src homology
  2 (SH-2) domains. The autophosphorylated Jak2 at the box 1 motif can lead to activation
  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Akt can regulate a wide range
  of targets including FOXO1 and NF-κB. Both Tyr1077 and Tyr1138 bind to STAT5, whereas
  only Tyr1138 recruits STAT1 and STAT3. STAT3 proteins form dimers and translocate
  to the nucleus to induce expression of genes such as c-fos, c-jun, egr-1, activator
  protein-1 (AP-1), and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). SOCS3 negatively
  regulates signal transduction by leptin by binding to phosphorylated tyrosines on
  the receptor, to inhibit the binding of STAT proteins and the SH-2 domain-containing
  phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). SHP-2 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and
  p42/44 MAPK through an interaction with the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (GRB2), to induce cytokine and chemokine expression in immune cells.
