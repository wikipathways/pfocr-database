caption: 'As outlined in the flow diagram (upper panel) and as illustrated in the
  figure (lower panel), the four gene classes associated with Alzheimer’s disease
  are directly or indirectly linked to endosomal traffic jams. These traffic jams
  can occur by altering the balance of membrane traffic into the early endosomes via
  the endocytosis pathway (indicated by the green arrow in the figure), or more commonly
  by altering one of the three traffic pathways out of the early endosome (indicated
  by the numbered green arrows): 1. The degradation pathway, which is initiated by
  sorting cargo to the intraluminal vesicle (ILV). 2. The ‘recycling’ pathway to the
  cell surface. 3. The ‘retrograde’ pathway back to the trans-Golgi network. The four
  gene classes are:Endosomal Trafficking Genes. Typified by SORL1, BIN1, CD2AP and
  PICALM, this class directly affects the balance of membrane trafficking in and mainly
  out of the early endosome, upstream to amyloid accumulation. A downstream consequence
  is to increase APP and/or BACE1 at the endosomal membrane, leading to intracellular
  accumulation of βCTF and Aβ42, or to a decrease in the intraneuronal clearance of
  Aβ42. As illustrated, βCTF and/or Aβ42 can feed back and worsen endosomal traffic
  jams, creating a vicious cycleCholesterol Metabolism Genes. Typified by APOE4, this
  class can decrease the clearance of extracellular Aβ42, which can lead to increases
  in intracellular Aβ42. Additionally, this class can increase endocytosis or more
  likely reduce endosomal recycling, with a direct effect on endosomal traffic jams.Immune
  response genes. Typified by TREM2 this class can decrease the clearance of extracellular
  Aβ42, leading to increases in intracellular Aβ42, which in turn can contribute to
  endosomal traffic jams.APP processing genes. Including mutations in APP and the
  presenilins, this class leads to an intracellular accumulation of Aβ42 and/or βCTF
  and, which can act as drivers of endosomal traffic jams.'
