caption: MYC regulatory networks in pluripotent stem cells. Schematic representation
  of part of the molecular mechanisms through which MYC affects the PSC identity.
  MYC supports the pluripotent state by favoring both the typical cell cycle structure
  and metabolism of PSCs. In addition, it contributes to repress developmental genes,
  in collaboration with MIZ-1 and PRC2. MYC further extends its regulatory action
  by integrating a complex network of ncRNAs, which finally affects all aspects of
  the PSC life. Moreover, by interacting with chromatin modifiers and remodelers,
  MYC controls the epigenetic state of PSCs. Finally, it is also a downstream effector
  of the LIF pathway and involved in modulating both the MAPK/ERK and the WNT signaling,
  which converge on the core of PSCs. For detailed description see the text. Solid
  green and red arrows indicate a MYC-mediated positive or negative regulation of
  nearby genes, respectively. Dotted green and red arrows are used to indicate the
  integration of multiple roles of MYC, which can either sustain or counteract the
  pluripotent state, respectively. Solid black arrows and flat lines indicate activation
  or repression, respectively. Red crosses indicate lack of transcription of reported
  genes.
