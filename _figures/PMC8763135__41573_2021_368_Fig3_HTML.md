caption: a | Anti-cytokine and cytokine receptor antibodies. b | Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs (NSAIDS) targeting cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and/or COX2. c | Minocycline exhibits
  indirect effects on multiple components of the kynurenine pathway and is hypothesized
  to induce a neuroprotective effect. d | P2X7, an ion channel on the surface of glial
  and neuronal cells, is opened by high concentrations of ATP, leading to activation
  of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and release
  of IL-1β. This pro-inflammatory signalling pathway is blocked by JNJ-54175446, an
  antagonist of the P2X7 receptor, and could also theoretically be blocked by an NLRP3
  inflammasome inhibitor. BMP, bone morphogenic protein; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO, kynurenine
  3-monooxygenase; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PGI2,
  prostaglandin I2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; TXA2,
  thromboxane A2.
