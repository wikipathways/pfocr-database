caption: Schematic representation of the IL-7R-JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The IL-7R-JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway is activated when interleukin-7 (IL-7) binds to the IL-7 receptor
  (IL-7R), which consists of IL-7Ralpha (IL-7Rα) and the common gamma chain (γc),
  resulting in the phosphorylation and thus activation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and
  JAK3. Activated JAK proteins phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5 (STAT5), and phosphorylated STAT5 homodimerizes and translocates to the nucleus
  where it regulates the expression of STAT5 target genes, such as BCL2, CISH, MYC,
  OSM and PIM1. Negative regulators of the pathway include the protein tyrosine phosphatases
  (PTP) non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and receptor type C (PTPRC, also known as CD45),
  as well as the large GTPase dynamin 2 (DNM2) which plays a role in the clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis of IL-7R.
