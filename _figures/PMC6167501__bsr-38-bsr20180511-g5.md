caption: The NF-κB cascade can be initiated by several types of receptors, which will
  trigger either the canonical or the non-canonical pathway. When the canonical pathway
  is initiated by receptors such as TNFR, the activated receptor interacts with associated
  proteins (TRAFs), which recruit RIP1 kinase to be phosphorylated by the receptor.
  This pathway culminates in the phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex
  formed by scaffold protein NEMO, IKKα, and IKKβ. NF-κB dimers are conjugated with
  inhibitor IKB in the cytoplasm. IKK complex is responsible for phosphorylating IKB
  and therefore targetting it for degradation, releasing NF-κB to translocate into
  the nucleus and promote transcription of target genes by binding to the κB site
  in the DNA. The non-canonical pathway is initiated by other receptors, which relies
  on the activation of IKKα homodimer by the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), assisted
  by TRAF. p100:RelB, the most common NF-κB dimer in this pathway, is phosphorylated
  on the p100 subunit, which will be cleaved in its inhibitory domain and release
  active p52:RelB dimer to exert its nuclear functions. In melanoma, UV light exposure
  is one of the factors that might activate NF-κB by inducing cytokines that signals
  through this pathway to induce a pro-inflammatory response. Sustained activation
  of NF-κB also promotes the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, as well as invasion-
  and metastasis-related genes.
