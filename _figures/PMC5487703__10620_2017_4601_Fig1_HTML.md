caption: Trypsin-dependent pathological pathway in chronic pancreatitis. Activation
  of PRSS1 trypsinogen to active trypsin in the pancreas is responsible for disease
  onset and progression. Protective mechanisms to control trypsinogen activation include
  trypsin inhibition by SPINK1 and trypsinogen degradation by chymotrypsin C (CTRC)
  and trypsin. CTRC cleaves the Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond, and trypsin cleaves the
  Arg122-Val123 peptide bond; the combination of these two cleavages results in irreversible
  trypsinogen degradation. CTRC also stimulates autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen
  by cleaving the Phe18-Asp19 peptide bond in the activation peptide. The shortened
  activation peptide is more susceptible to trypsin-mediated activation at the Lys23-Ile24
  peptide bond. The indicated hereditary pancreatitis-associated PRSS1 mutations increase
  trypsinogen autoactivation by inhibition of CTRC-dependent trypsinogen degradation
  (red arrow) or by increasing CTRC-dependent stimulation of autoactivation (green
  arrow, mutations in orange type). Activation peptide mutations directly stimulate
  autoactivation independently of CTRC function (green arrow, mutations in black type).
  Loss-of-function mutations in SPINK1 reduce inhibitor expression and thus compromise
  trypsin inhibition. Loss-of function mutations in CTRC reduce secretion, block zymogen
  activation, diminish catalytic activity or promote degradation by trypsin, and therefore
  impair protective trypsinogen degradation. p.insIDK indicates mutation p.K23_I24insIDK.
