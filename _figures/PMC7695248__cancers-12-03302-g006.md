caption: Sex-dependent metabolic and transcriptional changes after disrupted Cyp51
  from cholesterol synthesis align with hepatocarcinogenesis in humans. Arrows indicate
  active connections between enriched genes, KEGG pathways, and TFs. Blocked arrows
  represent repression. Hatched arrows represent possible transcription regulation
  of the selected pathway or connection between selected pathways in KO mice. Metabolites,
  DE genes, KEGG pathways, and TFs are violet if positively enriched and green if
  negatively enriched. Icons were used from the Reactome icon library. All selected
  mouse signalling and metabolic pathways and TFs were aligned with human literature
  data.
