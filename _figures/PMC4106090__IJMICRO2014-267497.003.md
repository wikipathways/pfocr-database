caption: The GPI anchorage pathway. GPIs are glycolopids that act as a membrane anchor
  for many cell surface proteins and are composed of an inositol molecule that is
  sequentially modified in the ER with a Man3GlcN glycan and phosphoethanolamine groups.
  Numbers show sequential steps for the synthesis of a Man3GlcN glycan bearing GPI.
  A GPI-transamidase complex acts upon the phosphoethanolamine group linked to the
  terminal mannose to add the surface protein. The C. albicans Smp3 adds a fourth
  mannose residue that is essential for protein transfer; but in humans it is not
  essential for transamidation and its expression appears to be restricted to brain
  and colon.
