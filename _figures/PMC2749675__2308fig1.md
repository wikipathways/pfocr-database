caption: 'Scheme of the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt glycoproteins are produced
  by the neighboring cells and secreted in a process that involves many components,
  such as a multiprotein retromer complex, and the multispanning transmembrane protein
  Wntless (Wls). The secreted Wnt ligands bind to the receptors of the seven-membrane-spanning
  Frizzled family and single-spanning LRP family. Secreted factors like secreted Frizzled-related
  proteins (sFRPs) bind to Wnts and block the interaction with Frizzled receptors.
  Dickkopf antagonizes Wnt signaling by blocking LRP receptors. Three main branches
  are activated downstream from the Wnt signals: canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  (blue and red, in the center and on the left), and the noncanonical Jun kinase and
  Wnt/Ca2+ pathways (green and orange on the right). The central component of the
  canonical Wnt signaling is β-catenin (red). (Left and right) In the absence of the
  Wnt signals, β-catenin forms a stable complex with E-cadherin and participates in
  adherens junction formation. (Left) Excess β-catenin is captured by a destruction
  complex containing GSK3β, Axin1, Axin2/Conductin, and APC, where it gets N-terminally
  phosphorylated and, following ubiquitination by β-Trcp, targeted to proteosome-mediated
  degradation. In contrast, in the presence of the Wnt ligands, disassembly of the
  destruction complex occurs through phosphorylation of LRP5/6 by GSK3β and CK1α,
  and binding of Axin to LRP, thereby preventing β-catenin degradation. Free cytoplasmatic
  β-catenin can then enter the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptionally active
  complex with Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors, by replacing Grouchos from
  chromatin, and interacting with other coactivators like CBP, BCL9, and Pygopus.
  The three pathways branch at the level of Dishevelled (Dsh) protein. In the noncanonical
  Jun kinase pathway, Dsh via Daam1, is connected to downstream effectors, such as
  Rho, and regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell polarity. The Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  leads to the release of intracellular calcium, and involves activation of Phospholipase
  C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC). Ca2+ can activate Calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase C (CaMKII), and Nemo-like kinase (NLK), and suppress canonical Wnt signaling.'
