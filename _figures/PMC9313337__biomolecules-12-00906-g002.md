caption: Schematic illustration of five BN reconstruction strategies. A hypothetical
  gene network, constituting 7 nodes (genes) and 9 edges is synthesized as an example
  to present the principle of each BN reconstruction method. Three cyclic structures
  {A -> B -> D ->A}, {A -> C -> D -> A}, and {D->E->D} are introduced in this network.
  (A) PROPS method orders each edge randomly and adds edges one by one. The edges
  that lead to cyclic structures are abandoned. Here, edge ④, edge ⑤, and edge ⑥ are
  removed. (B) Clipper method excludes cyclic edges with the most undesired p-value
  from the linear regression significance test. Edge ②, edge ⑤, and edge ⑦ are the
  lowest-ranked in three cyclic structures thus removed. (C) BNrich method firstly
  removes cyclic structures according to intuitive biological rules, herein edge ③
  and edge ⑥ due to them being opposite in the direction of signaling transmission.
  Additionally, BNrich employs LASSO to further simplify the network. The coefficient
  of edge ⑨ is shrunken to zeros during LASSO regression, thus removed. (D) Ensemble
  method breaks cycles and preserves its graph hierarchy as much as possible. Edges
  in a cyclic structure with the highest voting score are excluded, Herein edge ①,
  edge ④, and edge ⑥ are removed to break corresponding cycles. (E) BPA method orders
  nodes arbitrarily (here in alphabetical order) and adds new edges from smaller numbered
  nodes to larger numbered nodes. Parent nodes of cyclic structure are also connected
  to each of the nodes in the cycle. Firstly edge ③ and edge ⑤ are removed and edge
  ⑩ is added in cycle 1. Then edge ⑥ is removed and node A and node C, two parent
  nodes of node D, are connected to node E constituting edge ⑪ and ⑫.
