caption: Toward a model of B cell activation through CD40-regulated gene expression.
  Partially overlapping dependence of CD40-regulated gene subsets (represented by
  numbers of pathway-dependent genes in the Venn diagram) on three major pathways.
  Small arrows indicate the major contributions of different pathways to gene up-
  and/or down-regulation. The overall gene regulation response to CD40 stimulation
  consists of a number of partially overlapping gene expression subsets, each depending
  on a particular pathway. The partially overlapping nature of these subsets suggests
  a balance between independent control (i.e., distinct gene subsets being regulated
  by different pathways) and collective control (i.e., a subset of genes whose regulation
  depends on all pathways tested). Thus, all pathways contribute to the regulation
  of a single group of genes (the collective control cluster), whereas each pathway
  also regulates a distinct subset of genes in its independent control cluster.
