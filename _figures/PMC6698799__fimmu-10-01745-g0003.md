caption: Proposed interaction model of Yersinia pestis effectors, Yops, with the pyrin
  inflammasome. Yersinia pestis effectors YopE (by promoting GTP hydrolysis) and YopT
  (by catalyzing cleavage and detachment of RhoA from the plasma membrane) inactivate
  RhoA. This results in reduced PKN1/2 activity, which in turn promotes the assembly
  of a pyrin inflammasome. Other bacterial toxins such as Clostridium difficile toxin
  B/TcdB (by glycosylation) or deleterious mutations in key enzymes of the mevalonate
  kinase pathway (Mut-MVK) also cause RhoA-inactivation. By delivering the additional
  effector YopM to the host cell, Yersinia pestis maintains virulence. YopM stimulates
  the PKN-1/2-mediated phosphorylation of pyrin and thereby the inhibition of pyrin
  inflammasome by hijacking host kinases PKN-1/2.
