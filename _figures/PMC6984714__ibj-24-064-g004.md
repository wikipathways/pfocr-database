caption: CREB signaling pathway. Several signaling pathways, including those involving
  PKA, PKC, DHT, and DHEA, have been associated with the regulation of de novo protein
  synthesis in the context of synaptic plasticity, converging on the phosphorylation
  of CREB at Ser133 residue to repair cognition dysfunction. PKA, protein kinase A;
  DHT, dehydrotestosterone; DHEA, dhedroepiandrosterone; CRE, cAMP response elements.
  The following binding DHT and DHEA to their receptors in the cytoplasmic membrane,
  several enzymes like PKC, PKA and CaMK are activated. On the other hand, the mentioned
  hormones activates CREB protein directly using phopsphorylation on Ser133. Activated
  CREB protein passes through the nucleus membrane and is bonded to its receptor to
  occur the gene expression
