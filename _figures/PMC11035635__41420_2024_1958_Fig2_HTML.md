caption: 'A The extrinsic pathway (left) is triggered by the activation of death receptors,
  such as TNFR1, Fas, and the TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. This leads to the formation
  of DISCs and the activation of caspase 8. The intrinsic pathway (right) is initiated
  by intracellular signals, such as DNA damage, cellular stress, and loss of survival
  signals, resulting in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and subsequent
  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This triggers the activation of caspase
  9. Activated caspase 8 and caspase 9 cleave downstream caspase 3 and caspase 7,
  which mediate the execution of apoptosis. B Autophagy initiation is mediated by
  the ULK complex, which eventually activates the class III PI3K complex. This complex
  produces PI3P on autophagic membranes to recruit the autophagy conjugation machinery,
  which is subsequently transformed into the autophagosome. The autophagosome then
  fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. C The central biochemical and metabolic
  event in ferroptosis is oxidative damage to cellular membranes resulting from the
  abnormal accumulation of lethal lipid peroxidation products within cells. This effect
  is mainly caused by an imbalance between ferroptosis-driving (left) and ferroptosis-defense
  (right) mechanisms. The classic antioxidant network includes the GPX4-GSH system,
  the FSP1-CoQ10 system, the DHODH-CoQH2 system, and the GCH1-BH4 system. D Pyroptosis
  is mediated through two main mechanisms: the canonical (left) and noncanonical pathways
  (middle). The canonical pyroptosis pathway responds to cell DAMPs and PAMPs, leading
  to inflammasome formation. Inflammasomes then recruit proteins to activate caspase-1,
  which subsequently cleaves GSDMD and promotes IL-1β/IL-18 maturation. In the noncanonical
  pathway, caspases-4/5/11 are activated by cytosolic LPS, triggering pyroptosis by
  cleaving GSDMD. CAFs have been shown to modulate different types of RCD, including
  apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, mainly through exosomal secretion
  and paracrine signaling pathways.'
