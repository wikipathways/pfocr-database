caption: illustrates one pathway accounting for the observed silylations, although
  details on the mechanism await further investigation. Initial oxidative addition
  of Pd(0) to allylic ether 1, aided by presumably high concentrations within micellar
  nanoreactors, produces allyl palladium intermediates 5, 5’ and 5”, each containing
  the bidentate ligand. Slow transmetallation of a π-allyl palladium complex 5” suggests
  that σ-allyl palladium species 5 and/or 5’ more likely undergoes transmetallation
  with disilane to give allyl silyl palladium 6 and/or 6’, leading to the corresponding
  branched and/or linear products, respectively, strongly favoring the latter.
