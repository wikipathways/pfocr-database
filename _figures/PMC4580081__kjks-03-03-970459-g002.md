caption: Interactions of chaperone proteins with Stat3 panel (A) and Jak2 panel (B).
  Stat3 requires interaction with TRiC for optimal biogenesis (portion 1). As most
  TRiC clients also interact with nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), HSP70/HSP40,
  and prefoldin, we hypothesize that these chaperones are also involved in de novo
  Stat3 folding. Inactive Stat3 is found in large complexes in the cytoplasm containing
  chaperone proteins HSP90 and ERp57 (portion 2). Stat3 is recruited to activated
  cytokine receptors, and HSP90 is required for Stat3 interaction with JAK kinases,
  Stat3 phosphorylation, and dimerization of activated Stat3 (portion 3). It is thought
  that HSP90 stabilizes activated Stat3, making Stat3 phosphorylation and tail-to-tail
  dimerization more favorable. HSP90/Hop is required for Stat3 nuclear translocation
  (portion 4). HSP90/Hop co-localizes with Stat3, stabilizing Stat3 while it is bound
  to DNA (portion 5). Although data are limited, others have hypothesized that mtHSP90
  is involved, in conjunction with TOM/TIM, with Stat3 mitochondrial translocation
  (portion 6). ERp57 activity within the ER decreases Stat3 activity in the cytoplasm
  (portion 7). The activity of other chaperone proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP22,
  is associated with increased Stat3 activity (not pictured). In panel B, tyrosine
  kinases are classic HSP90 clients that require interaction with HSP90 for de novo
  folding and maturation as well as activation. HSP70 plays an important role in the
  degradation of tyrosine kinases, which can occur at any stage of tyrosine kinase
  maturation or after activation. In the presence of HSP90 inhibitors tyrosine kinases
  are preferentially degraded.
