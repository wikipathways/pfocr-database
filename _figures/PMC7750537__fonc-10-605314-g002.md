caption: Overview of the autophagic pathway. Autophagy is induced by different stress
  stimuli including nutritional status, hypoxia and ROS. The autophagic process is
  initiated by the activity of ULK1 complex, which is regulated negatively by mTORC1
  and positively by AMPK. ULK1 complex initiates phagophore nucleation by phosphorylating
  components of the PI3KC3 complex that leads to the recruitment of several ATGs to
  assist autophagosome formation. The elongation step involves two ubiquitin-like
  conjugation complex, the ATG5-ATG12 complex and the LC3-PE complex, which are required
  for proper phagophore membrane expansion and subsequent closure of the autophagosome.
  Completed autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome, where
  hydrolytic enzymes degrade the enclosed material. The degrading metabolites are
  transported back to the cytosol for macromolecule synthesis and energy production.
  In addition, the autophagic machinery is associated with unconventional secretory
  processes. See the text for additional information. AMPK, AMP-activated protein
