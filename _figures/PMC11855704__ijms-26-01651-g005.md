caption: 'GLP-1 targets and regulates insulin, controlling blood glucose. Notes: GLP-1
  can actvate adenylate cyclase (AC) after binding with GLP-1R, and the activated
  AC will stimulate the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine phosphate (cAMP) and
  increase the concentration of cAMP. cAMP further activates protein kinase A (PKA)
  and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Epac2). On the one hand, the activated PKA
  can close the ATP-dependent K+ channel and depolarize the cell membrane; on the
  other hand, it can activate the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel to make Ca2+ flow
  in and generate an action potential. PKA can also promote Ca2+ release by activating
  inositol triphosphate (IP3). Activated Epac2 can further activate Ras protein 1(Rap1)
  and phospholipase C (PLC), thereby activating the IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG) pathways
  and promoting Ca2+ release. All of these pathways lead to an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration, which promotes mitochondrial synthesis of ATP, allowing insulin
  particles to be released into the bloodstream'
