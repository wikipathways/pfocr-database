caption: 'The main energy source of the cell, glucose enters catabolic processes in
  glycolysis followed by TCA or the anabolic chain of PPP. Nrf2 regulates rate-limiting
  enzymes to control the flow of substrates to these pathways. Oxidative phosphorylation
  is the main contributor to ROS. Cellular redox status is managed by enzymes such
  as SOD1 and SOD2 that converts superoxides to peroxides which eventually neutralized
  by catalases and peroxidases. Nrf2 also regulates the transcription of enzymes involved
  in glutathione synthesis, the main cellular reducing currency. Iron is another source
  of cellular ROS, managed by Nrf2 transcribed transporters. Enzymes whose transcription
  is directly regulated by Nrf2 is highlighted in yellow. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: mitochondrial
  complexes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; Cat: Catalase; C: cytochrome C; FeS: Iron-sulfur clusters
