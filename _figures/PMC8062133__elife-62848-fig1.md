caption: The chemotaxis pathway controls the direction of motor rotation via CheY
  protein which, on phosphorylation, binds to the FliM protein of motor-switch complex
  (FliG, FliM, and FliN) and causes clockwise (CW) rotation of one or more flagella.
  The concentration of phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) is dictated by the binding of
  ligands to their specific transmembrane receptors. Attractants such as glucose/2Dg
  bind to the periplasmic glucose-binding protein (BP) and are sensed by the Trg chemoreceptor
  protein. The binding results in a decrease in the autophosphorylation activity of
  CheA, which is part of CheA-CheW-receptor complex, leading to a lower concentration
  of CheY-P. The CheY-P binds to the FliM protein causing the motor to rotate in the
  CW direction. The proteins CheR and CheB control the degree of methylation of the
  receptors and allow the cell to adapt to the present concentration of attractant
  and sense subsequent changes. Additionally, glucose is a metabolizable ligand and
  is also sensed by an alternate pathway, namely, the phosphotransferase system (PTS),
  whose signals integrate into the chemotaxis pathway. The PTS generates a constant
  flow of phosphate groups via the PTS transporters (EI, HPr, and EII) from phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) and activates the sensory complexes CheA-CheW thereby communicating with the
  motor via reduced levels of CheY-P. The CheZ protein accelerates the dephosphorylation
  of CheY-P. The motor rotation is generated via ion flow through the membrane-bound
  stator units comprising of proteins, MotA and MotB, while the speed is controlled
  via the intracellular concentration of the second messenger molecule, cyclic diguanosine
  monophosphate (c-di-GMP). The latter is produced by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes
  from GTP and degraded by specific phosphodiesterases. Nutrient depletion conditions
  trigger production of c-di-GMP, which forms complex with YcgR protein and hinders
  the motor rotation. The present study suggests a signaling pathway that links the
  chemotaxis receptor to the motor speed via stator unit recruitment.
