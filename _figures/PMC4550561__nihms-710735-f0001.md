caption: Potential role of Lp(a) and PCSK9 in CAVD. Lp(a) may get taken up and metabolized
  by cells via Lp(a) receptors (receptors for which Lp(a) is a ligand). However, in
  the presence of PCSK9 some of these receptors may be internalized and degraded instead
  of recycled back to the cell surface (A). As such more Lp(a) derived oxidized lipids
  may be converted to LPA and be taken up by VICs via LPA receptors. This may lead
  to the production of inflammation related cytokines (e.g., IL6) through NF-κB nuclear
  localization that in turn increase BMP and/or other calcification inducing processes
  leading to valve calcification. PCSK9 inhibitors may act to block PCSK9 interaction
  with Lp(a) receptors, resulting in Lp(a) receptors being recycled back to the cell
  surface where they can take up more Lp(a) (B). Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps
  in the pathway.
