caption: Signaling pathways in serum-free and feeder cell-free culture systems (on
  laminin-511). Cadherin is activated by a cell junction. When N-cadherin is activated,
  transcriptional enhancement of FGFR occurs. As a result, the FGF2 signal pathway
  is activated. This signaling pathway has an important role in the expression of
  FGFR attachment to the cell membrane. In cultures using a laminin-511 scaffold,
  the E-cadherin-α6β1 integrin signal pathway is required to control cell death in
  hiPSCs. PI3K signaling promotes expression of Rac1. Rac1 binds to cadherins, and
  cadherins prevent endocytosis. When α6β1 integrin is combined with laminin-511,
  Fyn-RhoA-ROCK signaling is induced. As a result, hiPSC death caused by ROCK is repressed.
  Laminin-511 can directly bind to α3β1 integrin and, thereby, activate the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway through Ras. In addition, linkage of α6β4 activates the MAP kinase
  pathways directly through Ras.
