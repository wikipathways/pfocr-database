caption: Heterogenous stromal cell populations metabolically cooperate with cancer
  cells directly or indirectly in the tumor microenvironment. Ovarian cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) provide cysteine (Cys) and reduced GSH to withstand oxidative
  stress. Ovarian CAFs also provide cancer cells with glutamine (Gln) and utilize
  cancer cell-derived glutamate (Glu) to regenerate Gln. Pancreatic CAFs provide cancer
  cells with alanine (Ala) through autophagy, with lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs)
  to support phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and indirectly with collagen-derived proline
  (Pro) to support survival under nutrient limitation. Similarly, breast CAFs supply
  cancer cells with autophagy-derived dipeptides. Prostate and pancreatic CAF-derived
  exosomes provide nutrient cargo to cancer cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) shuttle
  mitochondria and/or mitochondrial DNA into leukemia, lung and breast cancer cells,
  and consume cystine to provide leukemic cells with Cys. Tumor cell-derived Lactate
  (Lac) stimulates CD4+ T cell differentiation into regulatory T cells (Tregs), promotes
  tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization, but inhibits natural killer (NK)
  cells and effector T cells (Teffs). Similarly, tumor cell-derived kynurenine (kyu)
  facilitates Tregs differentiation but limits function of Teffs. Murine sarcoma-derived
  retinoid acid (RA) promotes intratumoral monocyte differentiation toward TAMs. TAMs
  promote tumor growth partly by providing metabolites such as polyamines. Adipocytes
  provide ovarian and breast cancer cells with fatty acids (FAs), pancreatic cancer
  cells with Gln, and engage in an arginine (Arg) cycling pathway using citrulline
  (Cit) to produce nitric oxide (NO).
