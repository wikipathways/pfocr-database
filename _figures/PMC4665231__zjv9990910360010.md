caption: Model of differentiation-coupled induction of HCMV replication via enhancer
  RARE, CRE, and kB in quiescently infected NT2. (A) Synopsis of early time course
  results for RVP-induced MIE RNA and protein expression from WT virus (rWT) versus
  viruses without functional enhancer RARE (rR−), CRE-kB (rKB−), or CRE-kB-RARE (rCKR−).
  Our model proposes a threshold level of spliced MIE RNA expression, above which
  MIE protein is produced (MIE protein positive). The MIE RNA level is measured across
  the entire NT2 population. The MIE+ NT2 population size is proportional to this
  level. A substantial reduction in MIE RNA level also reduces the MIE protein level
  (MIE protein low). (B) Extended timeline of RVP's effects on the actively infected
  NT2 population in relation to locations of enhancer mutations. The size of the actively
  infected NT2 population represents the number of MIE+/vGFP+ NT2 clusters (>6 MIE+/vGFP+
  cells) multiplied by the number of cells in these clusters. (C) V activates the
  PKA-CREB-TORC2-CRE signaling cascade (). P activates the PKC-delta-CREB-NF-κB p65/p50-CRE-kB
  pathway (). In transient assays, R-coupled retinoic acid receptor (RAR) binding
  to the retinoic acid receptor elements (RARE) activates viral MIE enhancer/promoter
  segments (, ). Corepressors (Co-Rep) and activators (Co-Act) regulate R-coupled
  RAR activity, and other signaling pathways regulate them (, ). We postulate that
  RVP produces an active R-liganded RAR coregulatory complex that strengthens MIE
  gene expression, which is not achieved with R alone.
