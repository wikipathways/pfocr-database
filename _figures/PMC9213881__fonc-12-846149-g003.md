caption: Metabolic difference between ALL and CLL LSCs. B-ALL LSCs are reliant on
  Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis where as T-ALL LSCs rely more on
  glutamine metabolism. CLL on the other had sees an increase in ROS and is reliant
  on OXPHOS. Increase in glutathione metabolism is also reported as an antioxidant
  to the high amount of ROS.
