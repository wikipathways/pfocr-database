caption: The regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 in AD. Under oxidative stress (electrophiles
  or ROS conditions) Nrf2 is released from Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex for translocation
  into the nucleus followed by its heterodimerization with sMaf which leads to its
  binding with the antioxidant response elements (AREs), and transcription of ARE-driven
  genes. Nrf2 activation may increase the levels of p62 which is responsible for the
  autophagic process and inhibit the BACE1 that generate amyloid-β peptides in the
  neurons. Moreover, Nrf2 counteracts neurofibrillary, tau proteins tangle and amyloid-β
  plaques.
