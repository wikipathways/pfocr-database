caption: Modifications of chromatin structure in response to enriched environmental
  stimulation or injury in the mature CNS. On the left side of the figure, DNA methylation-dependent
  gene silencing is shown. Signaling pathways between neuronal activity and DNA methylation
  are still unclear. Methylation of specific sites in the genome recruits methyl-DNA
  binding proteins locally. All proteins that bind to methylated DNA also have a transcription-regulatory
  domain, which binds to adapter proteins, which in turn recruit histone deacetylases.
  Histone deacetylases alter chromatin structure through removal of acetyl groups
  (CH3COO−) from histone core proteins (blue circles), leading to compaction of chromatin
  and transcriptional suppression. On the right side of the figure, the signaling
  pathway involving ERK, MSK, and CREB, implicated in the control of histone acetylation
  and chromatin structure, is shown. Phosphorylation and thus activation of CREB recruits
  CREB binding protein (CBP), which has histone acetyltransferase activity and leads
  to activation of gene transcription.
