caption: The Ragulator complex in SEGAs. (A) Schematic overview showing the Ragulator
  complex dependent mTORC1/MAPK signalling. Crystal structure of the Ragulator complex
  revealed that LAMTOR1 holds together the LAMTOR2/3 and LAMTOR4/5 heterodimers and
  anchors the complex to the late endosomes/lysosomes (). In the presence of amino
  acids and growth factors, the Ragulator complex can promote Rag GTPase- dependent
  mTORC1 activation and MEK1 dependent ERK activation via direct interaction of RagA-D
  and MEK1 with LAMTOR2/3 heterodimer (; ). Furthermore, the Ragulator complex interacts
  with vacuolar H+-ATPase and neutral amino acid transporter SLC38A9 and thereby can
  promote mTORC1 activation in the presence of amino acids (; ). Rapamycin inhibits
  mTORC1, whereas U0126 inhibits the MEK1 dependent ERK activation. (B–F) RT-qPCR
  of LAMTOR1 (B), LAMTOR2 (C), LAMTOR3 (D), LAMTOR4 (E) and LAMTOR5 (F) in SEGA (n
  = 19) compared to control tissue (n = 8), which together can form the Ragulator
  complex. Data are expressed relative to the expression observed in control tissue.
  *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test. (G) A String functional
  protein association network of the Ragulator complex (LAMTOR1–LAMTOR5) interactions
  identified by StringApp for Cytoscape. High confidence interactions were selected
  (0.7), identifying interactions with proteins related to the MAPK/ERK and mTORC1
  pathway. The outer circle indicates overexpression (red) or under-expression (blue)
  on RNA level based on the RNA-Seq data. The inner circle indicates to which enriched
  pathways each protein-interactor belongs to.
