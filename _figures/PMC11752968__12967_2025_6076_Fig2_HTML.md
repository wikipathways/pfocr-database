caption: 'Three signaling pathways of the unfolded protein responseWhen misfolded
  or unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP is
  displaced from the ER lumen, triggering the activation of three ERS sensors: IRE1α,
  PERK, and ATF6. This activation leads to downstream signaling pathways through phosphorylation:ATF6
  Signaling Pathway: ATF6 signaling is initiated when ATF6 is cleaved by Site 1 protease
  and Site 2 protease in the Golgi apparatus. The cleaved subunit (p50ATF6) acts as
  a transcription factor, regulating the expression of genes involved in stress response
  and protein foldingIRE1α Pathway: Upon phosphorylation, IRE1α forms dimers. Phosphorylated
  IRE1α (p-IRE1α) induces the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, generating the transcription
  factor XBP1s. Once XBP1s enters the nucleus, it activates the transcription of CHOP.
  Additionally, p-IRE1α activates the JNK signaling pathway via TRAF2, which leads
  to the phosphorylation of JNK and the subsequent activation of Caspase-12-mediated
  apoptosis. Furthermore, p-IRE1α promotes the degradation of mRNA through the RIDD
  processPERK Pathway: PERK undergoes autophosphorylation, resulting in dimerization.
  Activated PERK then phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which
  in turn enhances the translation of the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 activates
  the transcription of CHOP, initiating a pro-apoptotic program and promoting cell
  apoptosis'
