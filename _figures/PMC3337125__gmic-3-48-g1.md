caption: Figure 1. Biochemical pathway for polyamine anabolism and catabolism. ODC,
  a rate-limiting enzyme, converts L-ornithine into putrescine (Put), which can then
  be converted to spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) by spermidine synthase and spermine
  synthase, respectively. Spermine or spermidine is metabolized by the enzyme SSAT
  to acetylspermine and acetylspermidine, respectively, which are then acted upon
  by APAO to form spermidine and putrescine. Spermine can be oxidized directly and
  specifically to spermidine by spermine oxidase, resulting in the generation of H2O2
  and 3-aminopropanol.
