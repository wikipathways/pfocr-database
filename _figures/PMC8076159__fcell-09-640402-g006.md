caption: Proposed model of novel circGFRα1 exports to the cytoplasm mediated by METTL14,
  and promotes self-renewal of FGSCs. METTL14 alters the m6A modification of circGFRα1
  and increases its export to the cytoplasm, while circGFRα1 promotes FGSC self-renewal
  by acting as a ceRNA that sponges miR-449, leading to enhanced GFRα1 expression
  and activation of the GDNF signaling pathway, and finally affecting self-renewal
  of FGSCs.
