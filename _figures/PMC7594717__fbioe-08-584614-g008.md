caption: Metabolic flux map for C. glutamicum WT cultivated under continuous conditions
  at growth rate μ = 0.41 h– 1 using glucose as main carbon source. Fluxes were estimated
  using isotopic stationary 13C-MFA with a data set generated in a CLE with 33% (1-13C)-
  and 67% (U-13C)-D-glucose. Shown are net flux values, normalized to glucose uptake
  rate (vGLC = 4,086 μmol gCDW– 1 h– 1), together with their standard deviations.
  The complete absolute and relative flux distributions are provided in the . The
  flux map is drawn using the network editor and visualization tool Omix (Omix Visualization
  GmbH, Lennestadt, Germany, www.omix-visualization.com). UPT, uptake; PPP, pentose-phosphate
  pathway; ANA, anaplerotic section; BM, biomass; EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas; AAS,
  amino acid synthesis; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
