caption: A proposed model of the WT and LBP-deficient rats after LPS administration.
  The upregulation of Ifng, Cxcl10, Serpine1, and Lbp in WT rats triggers NF-κB signaling
  pathway-induced inflammation response at 6 h after LPS injection, while the PPAR
  signaling pathway plays a part in bacterial clearance via the formation of NET by
  highlighted genes of C5, Cyp4a1, and Eci1 at 24 h after LPS administration in SD
  rats and of Dhrs7b and Tysnd1 in the LBP−/− rats.
