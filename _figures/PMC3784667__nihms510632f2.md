caption: Intracellular cycling of MUC1MUC1 is phosphorylated by EGFR and other receptor
  tyrosine kinases. Under normal conditions, the cytoplasmic tail of MUC1 cycles from
  the cell membrane to endosomes and then back to the cell membrane. When overexpressed,
  MUC1 activates the wnt-β-catenin pathway. MUC1 competes with E-cadherin for binding
  to β-catenin. CagA and PKC-δ promote MUC1 binding to β-catenin, whereas GSK3β blocks
  MUC1 binding to β-catenin leading to β-catenin degradation. Persistence of the MUC1-β-catenin
  complex facilitates cycling to the nucleus where MUC1-β-catenin binds TCF7L2 on
  the cyclin-D1 promoter, coactivates cyclin-D1 and interacts with other transcription
  factors such as STAT1/3, NF κB RelA, and ERα. Transport of MUC1 to the mitochondria
  leads to inhibition of apoptosis.
