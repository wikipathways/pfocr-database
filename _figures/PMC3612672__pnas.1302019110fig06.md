caption: Phenylpropanoids (PP) are enriched in the cortex cell type. A scheme of the
  PP pathway with relative mRNA expression and metabolite accumulation in the core
  five cell types examined is shown. Gene expression () and metabolite accumulation
  are colored in representations of a root transverse section and a cut-away of a
  root tip. (A) Expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes (log2) is enriched in the
  cortex relative to other cell types. (B) The majority of PPs show maximal abundance
  (log10) in the cortex relative to other cell types.
