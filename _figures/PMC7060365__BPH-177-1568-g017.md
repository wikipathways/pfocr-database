caption: Mechanism of action of compound 5d in herpes simplex virus (HSV)‐infected
  Vero and HeLa cells. (a) In Vero cells, compound 5d may block the initial binding
  of HSV gB protein to cellular heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSPG; 1) and interfere
  with the fusion process at plasma membrane (2), so as to inhibit the adsorption
  and entry process of HSV. compound 5d also inhibits the activation of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway in early stage of HSV life cycle to reduce virus replication. (b) In HeLa
  cells, compound 5d may block the initial attachment of HSV particle to cellular
  HSPG (1) before gD protein binding to its receptor. After virus endocytosis (2),
  and endosomal acidification (3), compound 5d may block gB‐mediated fusion at endosomal
  membrane (4), so as to inhibit the capsid egress from endolysosome compartments.
  Compound 5d may also block the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway to inhibit subsequent
  virus replication
