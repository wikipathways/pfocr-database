caption: 'Nucleocytoplasmic transport and chaperone function of karyopherins. Left:
  Schematic diagram showing the RanGTP/GDP cycle through the nuclear pore complex.
  In the cytoplasm, RanGAP1, together with RanBP, hydrolyses RanGTP to maintain high
  cytoplasmic concentrations of RanGDP. In the nucleus, RCC1 (nuclear RanGEF) facilitates
  GTP-GDP exchange, causing high concentrations of RanGTP. These regulators maintain
  higher concentrations of RanGDP in the cytoplasm whilst preserving high levels of
  RanGTP in the karyoplasm, leading to a gradient required for energy-dependent nucleocytoplasmic
  transport. Right: Schematic diagram of the classical nuclear import and export pathway.
  During nuclear import, KPNB1 binds to KPNA, which itself is bound to the classical
  NLS (cNLS) of cargo, forming a trimeric complex. KPNA also exerts chaperone function
  to cargo-cNLS by shielding basic residues from hydrophobic/ionic interactions, which
  maintains a cargo protein in its native soluble state. KPNB1 carries the complex
  through the nuclear pore complex, where RanGTP binds, causing a conformational change
  in the bound importin (note, some KPNBs shown as beta bind directly to cargo forming
  a dimeric complex which directly translocates to the nucleus). This results in a
  trimeric complex of KPNA, nuclear export factor CAS, and RanGTP, and a dimeric complex
  consisting of KPNB1 and RanGTP. Both complexes then translocate back to the cytoplasm
  where their respective RanGTPs are hydrolysed to bind to the next cargo. During
  export, Exportin/KPNB (beta) bound to RanGTP binds to the cargo-NES of the cargo
  in the nucleoplasm. This complex is exported through the nuclear pore complex into
  the cytoplasm where RanGTP is hydrolysed, which triggers cargo release. CAS = cellular
  apoptosis susceptibility protein; RAN = Ras-related nuclear; RCC1 = regulator of
