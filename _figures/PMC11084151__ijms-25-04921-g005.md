caption: 'Differential gene expression in the lignin biosynthesis pathway of GhMYB52
  Like-knockout cotton. This figure illustrates the lignin biosynthesis pathway, with
  arrows connecting corresponding substrates and products; the abbreviated letters
  along the arrows represent the enzymes involved in the process. This figure also
  integrates differentially expressed genes (denoted by colored dots and gene IDs)
  obtained from the transcriptional profiling data of 16 DPA cotton fiber samples
  from both the wild type (HM-1) and the GhMYB52 Like mutant (line 377). For robustness,
  each sample was analyzed using two replicates. Gene expression differences were
  identified with strict parameters, namely, a minimum count threshold of 5 and an
  absolute log2 fold change (|log2FC|) of 1 or more, pinpointing the most significantly
  altered genes in the pathway. The corresponding genes from HM-1 and line 377 are
  depicted using heatmap dots to illustrate relative transcription levels: within
  the respective samples, red dots signify higher transcription levels of the gene,
  while green dots indicate lower expression. This color-coded map facilitates the
  identification of upregulated and downregulated genes within the pathway, providing
  insights into the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in response to the GhMYB52
  Like mutation. The full names of the enzymes involved in the pathway are as follows:
  PAL (Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase), C4H (Cinnamic Acid 4-Hydroxylase), 4CL (4-Coumarate-Coenzyme
  A Ligase), HCT (Hydroxycinnamoyl Transferase), C3H (p-Coumarate 3-Hydroxylase),
  CcoAOMT (Caffeoyl Coenzyme A 3-O-Methyltransferase), CCR (Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase),
  F5H (Ferulate 5-Hydroxylase), COMT (Caffeic Acid O-Methyltransferase), CAD (Cinnamyl
  Alcohol Dehydrogenase), and PER (Peroxidase). In the pathway diagram presented,
  the conversion of phenylalanine to 4-coumaroyl CoA—encompassing the initial three
  steps of lignin synthesis involving PALs, C4Hs, and 4CLs—constitutes a core set
  of reactions shared by both the phenylpropanoid pathway and the phenylpropanoid–acetate
  pathway. 4-Coumaroyl CoA can then be converted into lignin monomers through subsequent
  steps mediated by HCTs or CCRs, or it can undergo derivative transformations via
  enzymes associated with the phenylpropanoid-acetate pathway. It is commonly understood
  that in angiosperms, the content of S- and G- lignin monomers is greater than that
  of H-monomers'
