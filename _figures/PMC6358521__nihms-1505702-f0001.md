caption: Bacterial components are recognized by TLR1/2, TLR2/6 and TLR4, triggering
  recruitment of the TIR domain-containing adapter molecules TIRAP and MyD88, while
  TLR5 and IL-1R directly activate MyD88, followed by recruitment of IRAK family members.
  Upon sensing of fungal infections, CLRs signal through the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex.
  Both signaling pathways eventually lead to activation of the IKK complex (IKKα,
  IKKβ, and NEMO/IKKγ) and to the phosphorylation of IκBα via TAK1 (the classic MyD88-dependent
  pathway). After IκBα degradation, NF-κB heterodimers (p50:RelA or p50:cRel) translocate
  to the nucleus (canonical NF-κB pathway). By contrast, the noncanonical NF-κB pathway
  is induced upon activation of some TNF-R super-family members, such as CD40, BAFF-R
  or LT-β receptor, and involves the IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of p100 associated
  with RelB, leading to the generation of transcriptionally active p52:RelB complexes.
  IKKα activation and the phosphorylation of p100 depend on NIK activation. NFκB activation
  and translocation results in the induction of inflammatory cytokine genes (such
  as IL-21, IL-23 and IL-6). Upon binding to their receptors (expressed on T and innate
  lymphoid cells), the pro-inflammatory cytokines activate T cells via the transcription
  factor STAT3 and upregulate RORγT expression, resulting in the differentiation of
  these cells into IL17-producing T cells. *gp130 is a ubiquitously expressed protein
  scaffolding many cytokine receptors, such as IL6R, IL-11R, IL-27R, oncostatin M
  and other. B) IFN-γ/IL-12 response to mycobacterial infection and Salmonella. Upon
  mycobacterial infection, the IFN-γ/IL-12 axis is induced in APCs and T/NK cells.
  IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ are secreted in a positive loop between them, and through
  their receptors (IL-12Rβ1/2, IL-12Rβ1/IL-23R and IFNGR1/2) activate downstream signaling
  via TYK2, JAK1–2 and STAT1, finally inducing the transcription of ISGs. For all
  proteins shadowed in grey mutations have been described.
