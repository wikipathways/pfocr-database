caption: Pathways by which Mekk1 regulates p53 function. JNK-dependent pathways are
  shown on the left. JNK-independent pathways are shown on the right. Arrows show
  positive effects on p53 and/or p53 regulated genes (increased p53 protein or increased
  p53 transcriptional activation). The blocked arrow shows Mekk1 co-repression of
  p53 target genes. In the case of the PKD1 gene, this negative effect would down-regulate
  PKD1 expression, possibly causing PKD1 haploinsufficiency and cyst formation in
  response to stress pathway stimuli including TNFα.
