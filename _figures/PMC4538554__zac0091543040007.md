caption: Proposed mechanisms of ADS-4 in azole responses and resistance. Azole stress
  activates ads-4 transcription by an unknown signaling pathway, and then ADS-4 activates
  transcription of downstream genes (indicted in rectangles) involved in biological
  processes important to azole adaptation and resistance.
