caption: 'Tumour growth and metastasis: Role of NPP2-catalyzed reactions. In the extracellular
  milieu the tumour-motility stimulating factor NPP2 generates LPA from LPC. LPA promotes
  cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. In a coupled reaction with 5′-nucleotidase,
  NPP2 has the potential to hydrolyze ATP, which is cytotoxic for tumours, to adenosine,
  a tumour-growth promoting factor and stimulator of angiogenesis. The expression
  of both NPP2 and 5′-nucleotidase is increased by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which
  is activated in many cancers.'
