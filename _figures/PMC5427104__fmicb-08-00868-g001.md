caption: 'Activation and evasion of lectin pathway (LP) of complement. (A) The LP
  is activated when the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) Mannose-Binding Lectin
  (MBL), ficolins or collectin-10/-11 recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) on microbial surfaces. Pathogen recognition activates the PRM-associated
  serine proteases, MASPs, that catalyze C4 and C2 cleavage, leading to C3 convertase
  (C4b2a) formation. The C3 convertase cleaves C3 into the opsonin C3b and the anaphylatoxin
  C3a. Activation of C3 also leads to downstream formation of the C5 convertase (C4b2a3b)
  which cleaves C5 into the anaphylatoxin C5a and the fragment C5b. Attachment of
  C5b to the pathogen surface initiates formation of the lytic terminal membrane attack
  complex (C5b-9). The functions of these generated cleavage products include opsonization
  and lysis of the pathogen as well as generation of an inflammatory response. Complement
  inhibitory proteins like C1-INH and C4BP prevent excessive complement activation
  on host cells. (B) Microorganisms have developed multiple ways to evade complement
  actions and the mechanisms known to interfere with LP activation are: (1) masking
  of the PAMPs and thus avoiding being recognized by PRMs, (2) surface expression
  or secretion of proteins that bind and inhibit LP PRMs by disruption of the PRM:MASP
  complex and/or by impairment of PRM ligand-binding, (3) secretion of proteases that
  cleave and destruct LP components, (4) recruitment of the host’s complement inhibitory
  proteins; C1-INH that inhibits the MASP activity and C4BP that inactivates C4b,
  (5) utilization of LP components for voluntary opsonization by intracellular pathogens,
  (6) prevention of C3 convertase assembly by hijacking C2 via a surface expressed
  protein or by blocking the C2 binding-site on C4b via a secreted protein.'
