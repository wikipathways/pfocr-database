caption: Possible apoptotic pathway induced by photoactivated ZnPcSmix in monolayer
  cells 24 h post PDT. TNF triggers the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by binding to
  the TNF receptor and initiating the caspase cascade. CASP8 can directly induce apoptosis
  or cleave BID into truncated Bid which translocates to the mitochondria. In the
  mitochondria, BID can result in the release of cytochrome C (cyt c) which activates
  CASP9 and eventually CASP3. However, in this study, CASP3 and CASP6 were downregulated.
  BCL2L10 blocks apoptosis induced BAX which in turn is antagonized by BAK 1.
