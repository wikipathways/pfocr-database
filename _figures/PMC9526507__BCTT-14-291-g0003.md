caption: '(A) The mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway and its role in T cells;
  (B)Relationship between immune cells and Notch signaling pathway in breast cancer:
  ① Notch signaling mediates the anti-tumor effect of IFN-γ secretion by NK cells
  on breast cancer. ② Notch pathway activation promotes the secretion of INF-γ by
  CD4+ T cells to produce pro-cancer effects. ③ Notch pathway promotes SLEC differentiation
  of CD8+ T cells through the Hes1-PTEN axis, thus affecting the development of breast
  cancer. ④ Notch pathway increases the percentage of Treg cells by upregulating the
  expression of FOXP3, which in turn affects the development of breast cancer. ⑤ Notch
  pathway activation upregulates the expression of PD-1/PD-L1, which leads to immune
  escape from breast cancer. ⑥ Notch pathway upregulates HES1 expression to promote
  T-cell development, which in turn affects the development of breast cancer. ⑦ Silencing
  of the Notch pathway promotes the polarization level of M2 and down-regulates the
  polarization level of M1, which in turn affects the development of breast cancer.'
