caption: 'Downstream targets of IGF-1R. The binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-1R results
  in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the receptor. This leads to activation
  of the kinase domain and also provides the docking sites necessary for adaptor proteins
  to bind, thereby beginning a diverse cascade of intracellular signaling. Pathways
  that have been well described include Grb2, which then signals though Ras, Raf,
  and ultimately MAPK, leading to cell proliferation. Additionally, recruitment of
  PI3K results in cell survival by diminishing apoptotic signals. More recently, investigators
  have shown that the mTOR pathway is important in regulating protein translation,
  and that inhibition of mTOR results in a feedback loop, leading to an increase in
  Akt phosphorylation.Abbreviations: 4EBP, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  4E binding protein; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; IGF-1R, insulin-like
  growth factor receptor 1; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-triphosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched
  in brain; SAPK/JNK, stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; SGK,
  ribosomal S6 kinase; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex.'
