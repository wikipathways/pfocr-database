caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and renal fibrosis and CKD development (by
  Figdraw). Overexpression of TRIM6 leads to increased ubiquitination levels of TSC1
  and TSC2, thereby promoting activation of the mTORC1 pathway and exacerbating renal
  fibrosis. Additionally, TSC1-related mTORC1 signaling mediates the progression of
  renal interstitial fibrosis by regulating glycolysis in RTE cells. Notably, in an
  in vitro model of TGF-β-induced renal fibrosis, exosomes derived from mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSC) carrying anti-let−7i−5p activate the TSC1/mTOR signaling pathway,
  thereby alleviating renal fibrosis. Furthermore, in a UUO-induced renal fibrosis
  model, TSC1 serves as the binding target for the anti-let−7i−5p exosomes. TSC1 significantly
  impacts the progression of renal fibrosis by regulating the mTORC1 pathway, and
  targeting this pathway may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for renal fibrosis.
