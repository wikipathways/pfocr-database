caption: Abnormal regulation of the GSK3 activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  (ALS). A number of studies have found the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and Wnt pathway
  in injured motor neurons of ALS pathological condition. This leads to abnormal activation
  of the GSK3 signaling in ALS neurons. The final outcome of disease phenotypes cause
  by GSK3 activation is further modulated by other mechanisms, which are currently
  incompletely understood. Further studies are needed to examine how ALS-causing genes
  such as SOD, TDP-43, and FUS increase GSK3 activity in neurons and how GSK3 activation
  is involved in the cytoplasmic aggregate formation of toxic proteins.
