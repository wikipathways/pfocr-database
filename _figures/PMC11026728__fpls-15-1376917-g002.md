caption: 'A schematic representation of SA-JA crosstalks in response to herbivory:
  (A) An overview of SA and JA induction in response to different feeding guilds depicting
  that chewing insects are more prone to induce JA-responsive plant defenses and sucking
  insects exhibits the tendency to trigger SA-responsive plant defenses. The overview
  of SA-JA cross-talk that is represented by red lines demonstrating the orientation
  of reciprocal suppression by respective transcription factors (TFs). The proposed
  models suggest two (cytosolic and nuclear) crosstalks steps between SA and JA via
  activated NPR1 (carrying a star). NPR1 activation occurs through the induction of
  a transition from an oligomeric state (NPR without star) to a monomeric state (with
  star), a prerequisite for its effective functioning. The activated NPR1 may participate
  directly in crosstalk, either within the cytoplasm or following translocation into
  the nucleus. The molecular consequences of possible crosstalk models as a function
  of reciprocal suppression effects of respective TFs. The side by side panels, (B–F)
  are consisted of three steps, first box showing the basal level of two TFs (boxes
  with two squares) which means plants are not under attack and the defense mechanisms
  are not induced, the second box showing the induced TF upon herbivory and the third
  box showing the suppressive effect of the antagonistic TFs. (B) indicates the suppression
  of MYC TFs by NPR1 that refers to SA-dependent plant responses are in control. (C)
  shows the suppression of ERF TFs by NPR1 that refers to SA-dependent plant responses
  are in control. (D) depicts the suppression of NPR1 by ERF1 and MYC, respectively,
  that refers to JA-dependent plant responses are in control. (E) shows the suppression
  of NPR1 by ERF1 and MYC, respectively, that refers to JA-dependent plant responses
  are in control. (F) depicts the crosstalk within JA signaling pathway which results
  in suppression of ERF1 by MYC. The arrows in (B–F) panels indicate the direction
  of working scheme of crosstalks between TFs. The circles in each box (under (B–F)
  panels) depicts the induction of respective TF while a single circle of suppressed
  TF is intentionally left in each crosstalk final to show the suppressive effect
  of the suppressor TF. The colors of squares and circles in (B–F) are based on the
  colors of TFs (NPR1, MYCs and ERF1 and respective genes) in panels (A) and (B) The
  background of panels (B–F) are based on SA and JA signaling pathways'
