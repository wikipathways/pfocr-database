caption: Proposed lipid metabolism in E. coli (A) and C. glutamicum (B). (A) In the
  case of E. coli, cells grown on carbon sources usually synthesize acyl-acyl carrier
  proteins (acyl-ACPs) to build membrane lipids, irrespective of the functions of
  Tes and FadD. After entry into the stationary growth phase, membrane lipids of cells
  are subject to phospholipase-mediated hydrolysis to release free fatty acids, which
  are then activated to acyl-CoAs by FadD and subsequently metabolized by the β-oxidation
  pathway to generate a source of carbon and energy. In the case of fadD mutants of
  E. coli, the fatty acids cannot be activated to acyl-CoAs and are thus destined
  to be excreted extracellularly. (B) In contrast, C. glutamicum needs to hydrolyze
  some portion of acyl-CoAs by TesA to supply free fatty acids for the synthesis of
  the outer layer of mycolic acids. In this context, a surplus of the TesA-generated
  free fatty acids is recycled to acyl-CoAs by the two FadDs (FadD5/15) for phospholipid
  synthesis. Therefore, interception of the cyclic metabolic route at the FadD step
  results in fatty acid overproduction. Although concomitant activities of acyl-CoA
  hydrolysis and resynthesis create a futile cycle, this has significance as the recycling
  system of excess fatty acids, especially in an organism that cannot use free fatty
  acids as a source of carbon and energy. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane;
