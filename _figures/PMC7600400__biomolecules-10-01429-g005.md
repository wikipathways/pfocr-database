caption: Biosynthesis pathway of glutathione (GSH) from amino acid precursors. GSH
  is synthesized in two consecutive ATP-dependent reactions within the cytosol coupled
  with GSH degradation to its constituent amino acids via 5-oxoproline and cysteinyl
  glycine, which forms the GSH cycle. Precursor sources are indicated by green arrows.
  GSH synthesis is regulated through inhibition of GCLC by GSH. GCLC, glutathione
  cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic subunit; GCLM, glutathione cysteine ligase (GCL)
  modifier subunit; GS, glutathione synthase. Further explanation of synthesis processes
  is provided in the text.
