caption: Pathways involved in BCC pathogenesis. (A) Canonical Hedgehog (HH) pathway
  is involved in epidermal physiology. Extracellular HH ligands bind to PTCH1 receptor
  relieving the inhibition of smoothened (SMO) by PTCH1 itself. SMO activates a signaling
  cascade of interacting proteins, including suppressor of fused (SUFU), resulting
  in activation of GLI family of transcription factors. The HH target genes include
  GLI1, PTCH1, and HH interacting protein (HHIP1) that regulate the pathway itself
  (B,C) Aberrant activation of HH pathway is a tumor-driver in BCC pathogenesis. Human
  BCCs may display loss or inactivating mutation in PTCH1 or SUFU, as well as activating
  mutations in SMO or GLI. However, activation of noncanonical HH pathways (e.g.,
  EGFR, IGF, TGFβ pathways) may contribute to BCC development by transcription or
  post-translational modification of GLI bypassing the HH-mediated SMO activation.
  GLI activity is regulated positively by RAS, TGFβ, PI3K/AKT, NF-kB, and aPKCι/λ,
  and negatively by p53 and PKA. (D) Mutations in other genes have been implicated
  in BCC development, including components of WNT, Notch1, and Hippo pathways. Canonical
  WNT pathway is required for HH pathway-driven development of BCCs in a mouse model.
  WNT pathway activation has been identified in human BCCs that exhibit overexpression
  of WNT proteins and nuclear localization of β-catenin. Although Notch1 cannot be
  considered a tumor driver, its inhibition promotes tumor persistence in PTCH1 conditional
  mice whereas its activation induces tumor regression. In fact, human BCCs display
  inactivating mutation of Notch1 that is a regulator of epidermal differentiation.
  Inactivating mutations in LATS1/2 and PTPN14 genes of Hippo pathway have been found
  in human BCCs. Those mutations induce nuclear translocation of YAP and, in turn,
  cell proliferation. Activated or inactivated pathways are reported in orange or
  green, respectively [].
