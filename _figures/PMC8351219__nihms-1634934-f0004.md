caption: (a) The p53-dependent activity of Nutlins 3 and 3a. Nutlins bind to the p53
  binding pocket in MDM2 and inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction. In addition, Nutlin-3a
  also inhibits p53 hyperubiquitylation, allowing the re-import of p53 into the nucleus
  to activate apoptosis. In neuroblastoma cells, Nutlin-3 also activates HIPK2 to
  increase the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 46, resulting in apoptosis. (b) The
  p53-independent activity of Nutlins. Nutlin-3 inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
  multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and increases the sensitivity of cancer cells
  to chemotherapeutic drugs. Nutlin treatment also decreases VEGF production and angiogenesis
  in neuroblastoma cells, and blocks the interaction of MDM2 with p73, resulting in
  increased expression of p73 and PUMA/Noxa to induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.
