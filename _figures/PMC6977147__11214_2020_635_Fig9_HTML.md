caption: The reactivity of the Fe(Ni)S surfaces of Hadean alkaline hydrothermal vents
  could have promoted reactions analogous to those of the acetyl CoA pathway and incomplete
  reverse Krebs cycle. (A) Carbonylation of a bound acetyl group by bound CO (from
  CO2 reduction), followed by elution through nucleophilic attack by a sulphydryl
  or hydroxyl ion yielding thiopyruvic acid or pyruvic acid, respectively. (B) Reversible
  adsorption of oxaloacetate followed by hydrogenation of its keto group by two electrons
  (from H2 oxidation by Ni2+ in the alkaline phase) and H+ ions from surface mineral
  protonation yielding malic acid. Nickel atoms channel electrons from H2 catalysing
  a two-electron reduction. Recast from Camprubi et al. ()
