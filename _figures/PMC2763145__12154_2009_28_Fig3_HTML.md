caption: The Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Aux/IAA proteins regulates auxin response.
  In the absence of an auxin stimulus, Aux/ IAA proteins inhibit ARF transcriptional
  activity by forming heterodimers. Auxin perception (by an unknown receptor) targets
  the Aux/IAA proteins to the SCFTIR1 complex, resulting in their ubiquitination and
  degradation, thereby derepressing the ARF transcription factors. Among the ARF targets
  are the Aux/IAA genes themselves, which produce nascent Aux/IAA proteins that restore
  repression upon the pathway in a negative feedback loop
