caption: Simulated metabolic pathway from glucose to pyruvate. Arrows denote the modeled
  reactions. Vi, i = 0, …, 10, and V3A, V3B, are the reaction rates; for bidirectional
  arrows, the direction is determined by the sign of the corresponding reaction rate
  with the positive direction being from the top down. GLC, glucose; G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; F16BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; F26BP,
  fructose 2,6-bisphosphate; GAP glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; 13BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate.
