caption: Schematic representation of members of the human epidermal growth factor
  receptor (HER) family, their natural ligands, interaction with the HER2-targeted
  therapies trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), lapatinib, and
  neratinib, and the downstream consequences of these interactions. Circles on EGFR,
  HER2, and HER4 represent the active kinase domain; the kinase domain on HER3 is
  inactive. Ligand binding initiates homo- or heterodimerization of HER family members,
  leading to intracellular signaling cascades that are dependent on the dimers formed
  (e.g., PI3K/AKT and MAPK [Ras/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)]).
  HER-family signaling affects multiple cell processes including cell cycle, metabolism/protein
  synthesis, proliferation, migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and
  apoptosis. Trastuzumab inhibits HER2 signaling and can engage in antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Pertuzumab can also mediate ADCC and inhibits
  HER2 dimer formation, abrogating HER2 intracellular signaling. The trastuzumab-based
  antibody–drug conjugate T-DM1 maintains the functions of trastuzumab but also delivers
  a cytotoxic payload (emtansine) on internalization of the receptor/T-DM1 complex.
  Lapatinib and neratinib are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting
  the cytoplasmic ATPase domain of HER family members. This figure is adapted from
  publications by Roskoski et al. [], Segovia-Mendoza et al. [], Kourie et al. [],
  Appert-Collin et al. [] and references cited therein; further detail can be found
  within those publications. Signaling pathway interactions adapted from the KEGG
  pathway database. AKT, protein kinase B; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HB-EGF, heparin-binding
  EGF-like growth factor; JAK, Janus kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase; NRG, neuregulin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C;
  PLCγ, phospholipase C-γ; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; TGF, transforming growth factor.
