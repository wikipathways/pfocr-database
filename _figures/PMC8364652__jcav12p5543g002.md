caption: The upregulation of ROS inhibits T cells and NK cells, recruits macrophages,
  and induces M2 macrophage polarization. The overproduction of ROS attenuates the
  phosphorylation of eIF2B, thereby downregulating NKG2D/NKG2Dls and suppressing NK
  cell-mediated ADCC activity. Elevated ROS downregulate CD16ζ expression in NK cells,
  thus inhibiting the cytotoxicity of NK cells. The upregulation of ROS enhances the
  production of VEGF via stabilizing HIF-1α, thus interfering with T-cell differentiation.
  ROS trigger ERK activation of PARP-1, thereby causing the release of AIF and finally
  leading to T-cell death. The production of ROS also decreases CD3ζ chain expression,
  thereby impairing the formation of TCR, and blocking the differentiation and activation
  of T cells. The inhibition of T cells and NK cells favors tumor development. Increased
  ROS activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and promote the secretion of VEGF-C,
  CCL7, IL-8, and CSF-1, thus resulting in macrophage recruitment. ROS also activate
  TNF-α/TNFR1 signaling, which results in macrophage recruitment. Macrophages in turn
  elevate the secretion of ROS and finally promote tumor invasion and metastasis.
  ROS/PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent CSF-1 production induces M2 polarization of macrophages,
  thus contributing to tumor cell growth. NKG2DLs, NKG2D ligands; ADCC, antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; CCL7, cytokines chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand 7.
