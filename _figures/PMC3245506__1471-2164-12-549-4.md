caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in HMGA1 transgenics at 12 months
  (nonparametric approach). Using 425 differentially expressed genes as the focus
  gene set identified from a nonparametric approach and IPA, the highest-scoring network
  was Inflammatory Response, Immunological Disease, and Neurological Disease (score
  = 44). Colors, arrows, lines and abbreviations are described under Figure 1.
