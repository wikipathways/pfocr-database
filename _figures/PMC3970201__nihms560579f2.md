caption: A–C | Inhibition of apoptosis and anoikis by autophagy. A | Distinct types
  of proteins, lipids and metabolites may induce mitochondrial damage. Once established,
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) leads to the release of catabolic
  hydrolases (apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or endonuclease G (EndoG)) and caspase
  activators (such as cytochrome c and SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase)) into the cytoplasm. These changes usually mark the ‘point-of-no-return’
  of intrinsic apoptosis. The selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy)
  delays intrinsic apoptosis by limiting the release of pro-apoptotic factors. B |
  The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is triggered by the binding of trimeric ligands
  to so-called death receptors, which include CD95, the tumour necrosis factor receptor
  1 (TNFR1, depicted in the figure) and the TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand) receptors. One key event in this pathway is the activation of caspase 8.
  Selective clearance of active caspase 8 by autophagy may delay the onset of extrinsic
  apoptosis after death receptor stimulation. As caspase 8-induced apoptosis often
  relies on the cleavage and activation of the BH3-only protein BID (BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist), which is a potent MOMP inducer, mitophagy may also inhibit
  lethal signalling via death receptors. C | The selective clearance of the SRC protein
  by autophagy, which is overactivated in response to disrupted focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK) signalling, delays the onset of anoikis, which is induced by cell detachment
  from the extracellular matrix. D, E | Role of autophagy proteins in cell death.
  Although it generally constitutes a cytoprotective process, autophagosomes or ATG
  proteins may participate in lethal signalling in some specific circumstances. Da
  | Autophagosomes may act as platforms for caspase 8 activation, although the precise
  mechanism (or mechanisms) underlying this event remain poorly understood (indicated
  by the question mark). Db | In Drosophila melanogaster, the selective autophagy
  of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bruce (BIR-containing ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme; an orthologue of the mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)),
  contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Dc | Autophagosome accumulation, due
  to the saturation of the degradative capacity of lysosomes, may facilitate PTP opening
  and thus lethal MOMP by hitherto unknown mechanisms (indicated by the question mark).
  Ea | Certain pro-apoptotic stimuli, such as C6 ceramide or tunicamycin, induce the
  interaction of ATG12 with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 or MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence
  1) proteins, thereby inhibiting their function and increasing apoptosis. Eb | ATG7

  apoptotic pathway, after lysosomal photodamage. DISC, death-inducing signalling
