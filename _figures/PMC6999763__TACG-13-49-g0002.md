caption: Metabolic pathway with enzymes dependent on the molybdenum cofactor. Left,
  the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism, with the accumulation of sulfite and
  s-sulfocysteine due to sulfite oxidase deficiency (dependent molybdenum cofactor
  enzyme). On the right, the purine metabolism with accumulation of hypoxanthine and
  xanthine in blood, as well as the decrease of uric acid levels in the blood.
