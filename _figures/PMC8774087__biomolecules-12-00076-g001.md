caption: ACE2 pathway. ACE2 is >300 times more effective converting Ang II to Ang
  1–7 than Ang I to Ang 1–9, in the presence of NEP or ACE, can convert Ang I and
  Ang 1–9 to Ang 1–7. ACE2 membrane-anchored protein at the catalytically active ectodomain
  undergoes shedding because of ADAM17, forming a soluble form of ACE2. ACE = angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Ang = angiotensin; NEP = neprilysin;
  PCP = prolylcarboxypeptidase; ADAM17 = disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
  protein 17; Zn = metalloproteinase zinc-binding site.
