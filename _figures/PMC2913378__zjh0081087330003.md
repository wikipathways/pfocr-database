caption: Signaling pathways that mediate actomyosin-dependent disruption of the epithelial
  barrier in inflammation. Two signaling pathways that are activated by different
  inflammatory stimuli and result in disruption of the epithelial barrier are presented.
  The first pathway involves activation of MLCK resulting in a modest contraction
  of perijunctional actomyosin belt and reversible increase in paracellular permeability
  without gross alterations in AJC structure. The second pathway involves activation
  of the GEF-H1-Rho-ROCK pathway that leads to profound actomyosin contraction and
  AJC disassembly.
