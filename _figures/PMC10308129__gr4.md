caption: The role of KLF10 in adipogenesis, adipocytes metabolism and T cell immunity (A)
  SMAD 1/5/8 can be phosphorylated by BMPs, which will then increase the expression
  of PPARγ and other adipogenic factors. TGFβ can activate SMAD2/3, which will then
  induce the hyper-phosphorylation of SMAD 1/5/8 to inhibit the expression of PPARγ
  and other adipogenic factors. As a downstream factor of TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway,
  KLF10 may be also involved in regulating adipogenesis through this pathway, which
  is worthy of further investigation. During the early stage of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation
  (0–48 h post-adipogenic induction), C/EBPβ can facilitate mitotic clonal expansion
  (MCE). After 48 h of MCE, C/EBPα and PPARγ which inhibit MCE and enhance terminal
  adipocyte differentiation, are transactivated by C/EBPβ. During the early phase
  of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, KLF10 can be transactivated by C/EBPβ and then
  it would inhibit the transcription of C/EBPα and PPARγ by interacting with HDAC1
  to facilitate MCE, thereby ensuring adipogenesis at an appropriate level (B) Blockade
  of TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling contributes to the decreased expression of WAT-fat genes
  Leptin, Fabp4, Resistin and increased expression of BAT-fat genes Ucp1, Pgc-1α,
  Prdm16, which promotes the browning of WAT. Because KLF10 is a downstream factor
  of TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway, the potential role of KLF10 in regulating the browning
  of WAT merits further investigation (C) KLF10 deficiency in CD4+ T Cells can cause
  decreased Treg differentiation and mobilization to the adipose tissue pool and liver,
  which leads to more severe inflammation in adipose tissue. And KLF10 deficiency
  also causes higher IL-17 production in Vγ4+γδ27−-17 cells, whose role in regulating
  adipose tissue inflammation merits further study.
