caption: piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing in the germline and soma. The mechanisms
  that drive piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing are not well understood. Here
  we summarize speculative models based on the available data. (A) Ping-pong amplification
  in the germline. Transcripts from functional transposons (blue) and piRNA clusters
  (blue and red) are exported from the nucleus. Aub, preprogrammed with piRNAs generated
  through the primary biogenesis pathway, cleaves complementary transposon and cluster
  transcripts (blue), yielding randomly sized RNA fragments that bind Ago3. 3′-end
  trimming produces mature Ago3-sense strand piRNA complexes, which cleave anti-sense
  cluster transcripts (red). The resulting fragments bind to Aub and 3′-end processing
  generates anti-sense piRNAs, completing the amplification cycle. (B) Primary piRNA
  biogenesis in the soma. Anti-sense precursor transcripts (red) from flam and other
  uni-strand clusters are cleaved by Zuc to produce intermediate species that bind
  to Piwi. 3′ processing generates mature anti-sense piRNAs. (C) Primary piRNA biogenesis
  in the germline. Long-sense (blue) and anti-sense (red) precursor transcripts from
  piRNA clusters are cleaved by sequence-independent nucleases, which could include
  Zucchini (Zuc) and/or Squash (Squ), producing intermediates that bind Ago3 and Aub.
  Processing and modification of the 3′ ends generates mature piRNA complexes that
  drive that ping-pong amplification loop. (D) Potential modes of piRNA-mediated transposon
  silencing. (1) Transcriptional silencing of target transposons. piRNAs bound to
  Piwi, which accumulates in the nucleus, direct heterochromatin assembly at target
  elements. (2) Post-transcriptional target destruction. Transposon transcripts are
  recognized by Aub–piRNA complexes in the nuage, which catalyze homology-dependent
  cleavage. (3) Aub–piRNA complexes bind transposon transcripts and repress translation.

  description: piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing in the germline and soma.
    The mechanisms that drive piRNA biogenesis and transposon silencing are not well
    understood. Here we summarize speculative models based on the available data.
    (A) Ping-pong amplification in the germline. Transcripts from functional transposons
    (blue) and piRNA clusters (blue and red) are exported from the nucleus. Aub, preprogrammed
    with piRNAs generated through the primary biogenesis pathway, cleaves complementary
    transposon and cluster transcripts (blue), yielding randomly sized RNA fragments
    that bind Ago3. 3′-end trimming produces mature Ago3-sense strand piRNA complexes,
    which cleave anti-sense cluster transcripts (red). The resulting fragments bind
    to Aub and 3′-end processing generates anti-sense piRNAs, completing the amplification
    cycle. (B) Primary piRNA biogenesis in the soma. Anti-sense precursor transcripts
    (red) from flam and other uni-strand clusters are cleaved by Zuc to produce intermediate
    species that bind to Piwi. 3′ processing generates mature anti-sense piRNAs. (C)
    Primary piRNA biogenesis in the germline. Long-sense (blue) and anti-sense (red)
    precursor transcripts from piRNA clusters are cleaved by sequence-independent
    nucleases, which could include Zucchini (Zuc) and/or Squash (Squ), producing intermediates
    that bind Ago3 and Aub. Processing and modification of the 3′ ends generates mature
    piRNA complexes that drive that ping-pong amplification loop. (D) Potential modes
    of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing. (1) Transcriptional silencing of target
    transposons. piRNAs bound to Piwi, which accumulates in the nucleus, direct heterochromatin
    assembly at target elements. (2) Post-transcriptional target destruction. Transposon
    transcripts are recognized by Aub–piRNA complexes in the nuage, which catalyze
