caption: The cGAS–cGAMP–STING pathway detects cytoplasmic DNA after DNA damage and
  activate type I IFNs and other cytokines. Like DDR, the immune response is induced
  by various forms of genotoxic stress, ranging from ionizing radiation, DNA-damaging
  drugs, oxidative stress, oncogenic signaling, telomere shortening, and chromosome
  missegregation to viral infections and activation of endogenous retroelements. Nuclear
  DNA damage can generate cytoplasmic DNA in two possible ways. First, certain genomic
  damage causes chromosome to missegregate in subsequent cell division; the chromosome
  failing to partition into the new nuclei will form micronuclei. When the nuclear
  evelope (NE) of micronuclei ruptures, the DNA content is exposed to cGAS surveillance.
  Second, nuclear DNA damage can also generate ssDNA in the cytoplasm in a less understood
  process (dashed line and question mark). Such cytoplasmic DNA is degraded by Trex1,
  the loss of which leads to cGAS activation. Active cGAS dimerizes to synthesize
  cGAMP from GTP and ATP. cGAMP acts as a second messenger to activate STING on the
  ER surface. STING then activates transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB via kinases
  TBK1 and IKK, respectively. IRF3 and NF-κB translocate into the nucleus to elicit
  the expression of IFNs and other cytokines. Damage to mitochondria or mitochondrial
  DNA can also lead to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol, resulting
  in cGAS activation and sterile inflammation (not depicted).
