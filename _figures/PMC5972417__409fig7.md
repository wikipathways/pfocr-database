caption: The FA pathway and SPR-5 cooperate in DNA repair and regulation of histone
  demethylation. (a) C. elegans FNCM-1 is required for recruiting FCD-2 and its downstream
  nuclease FAN-1 in the germline. The potential helicase/translocase domain in FNCM-1
  is necessary for this process. (b) SPR-5 and FNCM-1 interact with each other and
  their colocalization in the germline is extended under conditions leading to stalled
  replication forks. (c) FNCM-1 and FCD-2 are necessary for maintaining proper H3K4
  dimethylation levels. (d) SPR-5-dependent S-phase checkpoint activation is required
  in response to the single-stranded DNA region formed in the absence of FNCM-1 in
  germline nuclei.
