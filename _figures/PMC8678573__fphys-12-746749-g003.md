caption: IgE cross-linking mediated activation of mast cells leads to degranulation
  and release of large amounts of bioactive lipids, including prostaglandin D2 and
  leukotriene (LT). After FcεRI is cross-linked with each other, the phosphorylation
  of ITAM activates Fyn and Syk, which in turn mediates activation of PKC through
  the PI-PLCγ signaling chain, resulting in increased intracellular calcium concentration
  and phosphorylation of the intracytoplasmic myosin light chain, leading to degranulation
  and release of bioactive mediators. Phosphorylation of ITAM activates the mitogen-activated
  protein (MAK) kinase signaling pathway, causing the breakdown of phospholipid choline
  (PC) in the presence of phospholipase A2 to produce arachidonic acid (AA), which
  is then combined into PGD2 and LT, respectively, via the cyclocythase and lipoxygenase
  pathways. Activation of MAPK also increases the transcription of several nuclear
  transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP1. After FcεRI is cross-linked, LDs are
  not only the source of calcium ions in mast cells but also the sinks of calcium
  ions, acting as the source and absorber of calcium ions, thereby affecting the corresponding
  signal pathways. The LDs-associated proteins Perilipin 5 and SNAP23 play crucial
  roles in the physical and metabolic connections between LDs and mitochondria. The
  synthesis of LDs is mainly carried out in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied
  by the synthesis of TAG, PC, and PE with FA as the substrate under the action of
  various enzymes.
