caption: Schematic representation of the interrelationships between reactive oxygen
  species (ROS, antioxidant defense system, nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S) signaling system in the kidney to control blood pressure and renal function.
  Imbalanced nutrition can activate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
  species (RNS), leading to kidney damage and vasoconstriction. Several oxidative
  enzymes can produce superoxide anion (O2−), such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase,
  and mitochondrial respiration. The superoxide anion can interact with nitric oxide
  (NO) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl anion
  (OH−) are reactive byproducts of superoxide. These ROS can be produced via superoxide
  dismutase (SOD), catalase, or glutathione peroxidase (GPx). On the other hand, dietary
  nutrients provide L-arginine and L-methionine for the synthesis of NO and H2S, respectively.
  Both NO and H2S are vasodilators and play a key role in maintaining renal physiology.
  While L-arginine can also be posttranslational methylation to form asymmetric or
  symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA or SDMA), both are endogenous inhibitors of nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS). There is a relationship between the L-arginine-NO and the
  H2S-synthesizing pathway. The protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) methylate
  L-arginine to generate ADMA/SDMA and concurrently demethylate methionine to form
  homocysteine. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is used as a substrate for methyl transfers
  that yield S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Homocysteine can further be broken down
  to generate L-cysteine and glutathione.
