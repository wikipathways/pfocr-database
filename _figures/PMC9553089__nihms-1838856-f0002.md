caption: Schematic representation of proposed genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
  based on GSE147507. (A) SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes downregulation of the membrane
  receptors CyPA and Basigin, both of which are involved in viral internalization.
  CyPA also contributes to chemotaxis. (B) SARS-CoV-2 upregulates Rab5A, which is
  involved in early endosome formation, viral replication, and autophagosomal maturation.
  (C) SARS-CoV-2 upregulates SAMHD1, which colocalizes to endosomes when CD81 expression
  is decreased. SAMHD1 is also involved in the reverse transcription of HIV. (D) SARS-CoV-2
  downregulates SCAP/SREBP, which modulates the mevalonate pathway through activation
  of FDPS promoter (E). SARS-CoV-2 downregulates FDPS and FDFT1. These genes are involved
  in downstream geranyl/farnesylation and cholesterol synthesis, respectively (F).
  SARS-CoV-2 downregulates p53, which helps in preventing SARS-CoV replication (G).
  SARS-CoV-2 upregulates RAR-α, which is involved in CD4 T-cell activation and autophagy
  inhibition (H). SARS-CoV-2 downregulates HMGB1, which promotes autophagosome formation
  when present in the cytoplasm and has chemotactic activity when released extracellularly
