caption: Biosynthetic pathway of 1,8-cineole, sabinene and bornyl diphosphate in Salvia
  officinalis L. Three distinct monoterpene synthases, i.e. 1,8-cineole synthase (CS),
  (+)-sabinene synthase (SS), and (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase (BS) are responsible
  for production of 1,8-cineole, sabinene and bornyl diphosphate, respectively
