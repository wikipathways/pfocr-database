caption: 'Induced glutathione and reduced beta-alanine metabolism during IS sensing
  and signaling in response to oxidative stress. (A) Metabolomic analysis of IS-treated
  cells compared with control. Relative metabolite abundance of the glutathione metabolism,
  TCA cycle, urea cycle, oxidate pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and glycosis are
  plotted. Color code: orange, P < 0.05; yellow, 0.10 > P > 0.05; white, P > 0.10;
  gray, not analyzed. (B) Pathway analysis based on impact and P value showing that
  glutathione metabolism is enhanced and beta-alanine is reduced in IS-treated cells
  compared with control. Larger circles farther from the y axis and orange-red color
  show higher impact of pathway. P-CoA, pantothenate and co-A biosynthesis; P, propanoate
  metabolism; CC, citrate cycle; GST, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. *P
  < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.'
