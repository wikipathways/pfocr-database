caption: A model for regulation of TGF-β signaling by Dab2 and cholesterol. TβRI is
  distributed in multiple plasma membrane domains, including CCPs and cholesterol-rich
  domains/caveolae. Although Smad signaling in response to TGF-β is not affected by
  TβRI localization to either domain, TGF-β stimulation of the JNK pathway is initiated
  mainly in the cholesterol-rich domains. Dab2, which binds both TβRI and clathrin,
  targets TβRI preferentially to CCPs, shifting the balance of TGF-β signaling such
  that Smad signaling is retained while JNK activation is diminished.
