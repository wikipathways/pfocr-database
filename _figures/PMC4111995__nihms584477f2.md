caption: (A) Merlin activates the Hippo pathway to suppress YAP/TAZ through regulation
  of core kinase components at the plasma membrane, through inhibition of the CRL4DCAF1
  E3 ubiquitin ligase in the nucleus, and by regulating cell junction-associated proteins
  that modulate Hippo signaling. (1) At adherens junctions, E-cadheren promotes Hippo
  signaling while α-catenin sequesters 14-3-3 protein-bound YAP. Merlin interacts
  with α-catenin at maturing adherens junctions in skin epithelium, plausibly influencing
  Hippo signaling at this subcellular compartment. (2) At the plasma membrane, Mn
  recruits the Lats kinases and coordinates their activation by Mst1, driving phosphorylation
  and inhibition of YAP/TAZ. (3) The Crumbs homolog (CRB) complex recruits Angiomotin
  (AMOT), which directly binds Hippo pathway components. AMOT serves as a scaffold
  for Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 activation and also directly binds and inhibits YAP. Conversely,
  the p180 isoform of AMOT promotes YAP function in the nucleus. Merlin interacts
  with AMOT at tight junctions to suppress Rac activity, however, it remains to be
  determined how Merlin influences Angiomotin's inhibition of YAP at tight junctions
  or YAP-activating functions in the nucleus. (4) Dephosphorylated Merlin translocates
  to the nucleus and inhibits CRL4DCAF1, preventing this E3 ligase from ubiquitinating
  and inhibiting Lats1/2. These core Hippo pathway components, activated by an upstream
  kinase, phosphorylate and inactivate YAP/TAZ.(B) Merlin's regulation of CRL4DCAF1
  impinges on multiple downstream epigenetic mechanisms and blocks oncogenic gene
  expression. In contact inhibited cells, active Merlin translocates to the nucleus
  where it binds to and inhibits the CRL4DCAF1 E3 Ubiquitin ligase. Active or dysregulated
  CRL4DCAF1 induces an oncogenic gene expression program by promoting downstream Hippo
  pathway targets via inhibition of the Lats1/2 kinases and through modulation of
  epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors.
