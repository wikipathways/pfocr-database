caption: 'Schematic representation of the molecular basis of morphine peripheral analgesia.
  The activation of opioid receptors in primary nociceptive neurons by morphine triggers
  the activation of the PI3Kγ/AKT pathway that in turn might cause the stimulation
  of nNOS and an increase in NO production. In last instance, NO, indirectly through
  stimulation of cGMP/PKG, causes the up-regulation of KATP currents and promotes
  the hyperpolarization of primary nociceptive neurons. The results described in the
  figure indicate the following treatments: (A) wortmannin, AS605240, LY294002, and
  AKT inhibitor IV, and (B) N-propyl-L-arginine. Morphine did not showed peripheral
  antinociceptive effect in (B) nNOS−/− and (A) PI3Kγ−/− mice.'
