caption: The red rectangles for upregulation, the blue rectangle for downregulation.The
  red arrows for promotion, the blue arrows for inhibition.AIRN by promoting mTOR
  degradation, it further suppresses mitophagy and eventually leads to hepatocyte
  injury; LINC01093 Inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the ICAM-1-mediated
  NF- κ B signaling pathway;CRNDE promotes apoptosis of hepatocytes by altering MAPK
  activity. Moreover, CRNDE also activates cytokines such as IL-6, which participate
  in the inflammatory response
