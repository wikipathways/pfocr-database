caption: 'Combinatorial effect of a Cancer Terminator Virus (Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7) and
  a BH3 mimetic (BI-97D6) in eradicating prostate cancer (CaP): Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 was
  mixed with decorated (targeted) microbubbles (MB) specifically targeting and binding
  to the prostate tumor vasculature that overexpresses VCAM-1, and injected intravenously
  (by tail vein injection) followed by delivery to the prostate region by the ultrasound-targeted
  microbubble-destruction (UTMD) approach. Following release and subsequent infection
  of the CaP cells, Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 selectively replicates in CaP cells resulting
  in production of mda-7/IL-24, which upon translation into protein can be secreted
  into the circulation or directly kill infected cancer cells. MDA-7/IL-24 can promote
  mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis via the Bcl-2-family pathway (as well as extrinsic
  apoptosis via death receptors), as well as ER stress or toxic autophagy in prostate
  tumors (primary site of infection). BI-97D6, which displays some antitumor activity
  in CaP as a single agent, synergistically co-operates with Ad.tCCN1-CTV-m7 in inducing
  cancer-specific apoptosis. BI-97D6 also stabilized mda-7/IL-24 mRNA further enhancing
  the production of MDA-7/IL-24 protein. The secreted MDA-7/IL-24 protein acts as
  a cytokine on adjacent uninfected CaP cells or tumors located distantly (lung, bone
  metastasis) via receptor dimerization and signal transduction culminating in cancer-specific
  apoptosis. It can also activate anti-angiogenesis effects and antitumor-immune responses
  further amplifying the antitumor effects of MDA-7/IL-24, thereby culminating in
  eradicating the primary CaP as well as any metastasis to distant sites in the body.'
