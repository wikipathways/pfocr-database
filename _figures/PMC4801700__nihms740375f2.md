caption: Receptor-dependent and independent actions of PGJ2. Some of the PGJ2 effects
  are receptor mediated. The DP2 receptor, which is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)
  for PGD2, is coupled to Gi, thus decreasing cAMP levels and increasing intracellular
  calcium. DP2 activation is linked to neuronal injury. We established that the peptide
  PACAP, which binds to its PAC1R receptor and increases cAMP, prevents some of the
  adverse effects of PGJ2. The nuclear receptor PPARγ is a transcription factor. PPARγ
  activation is associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective signaling. Moreover,
  unlike most prostaglandins, PGJ2 and its metabolites (Δ12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2) have
  a cyclopentenone ring with reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups (red star) that
  mediate their receptor-independent effects. Through S-alkylation, these groups form
  covalent Michael adducts with free sulfhydryls in cysteine residues in glutathione
  and cellular proteins. This covalent posttranslational modification by PGJ2 in the
  brain represents a novel pathologic change and could play a critical role in neurodegeneration
  in AD and PD. Pathologically activated therapeutics (PATs) are small molecules that
  become chemically activated at sites of tissue injury undergoing oxidative stress.
  These PATs are postulated to counteract the effects of electrophiles such as PGJ2,
  by activating the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE transcription pathway. Activation of the latter
  pathway induces the synthesis of endogenous antioxidant phase 2 enzymes that protect
  against oxidative and electrophilic stresses.
