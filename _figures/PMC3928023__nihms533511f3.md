caption: '(A) Pyramidal cells emit the first axons in cerebral circuits. They exhibit
  moderate CB1R expression with these receptors distributed all along the axis of
  the elongating axon. Sn-1-diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLα/β) are co-expressed in excitatory
  axons permitting cell-autonomous endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling that drives axonal
  elongation. Target-derived 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) might act as an additional
  attractive force. (B) Later-arriving GABAergic axons do not express DAGLs in their
  growth cones, but do express high levels of CB1Rs that sense a microenvironment
  that contains hotspots of 2-AG emanating from excitatory afferents (red shading).
  In these neurons, upon eCB stimulation, CB1Rs are removed from motile filopodia
  and translocated to the central growth cone domain where they activate the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) pathway, and RhoA GTPases. RhoA activation
  leads to a collapsing response on the side of the growth cone facing the eCB gradient
  thus contributing to growth cone steering decisions. Consequently, GABAergic axons
  target specific dendritic domains of postsynaptic neurons whose subcellular distribution
  and size are defined by excitatory afferents. Abbreviations: AEA, 2-arachidonoylethaloamine/anandamide;
  CB1R, CB1 cannabinoid receptor; CRIP1a, cannabinoid receptor interacting protein
  1a; NAPE-PLD, N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-selective phospholipase D; RhoA/Cdc42/Rac,
  members of the Rho family of small GTPases'
