caption: Circuit model for the CS-induced activation of the feeding CPG. The diagram
  summarizes the current knowledge of the pairing-induced cellular changes in the
  CNS. The CS pathway does not produce a behavioral response before pairing and only
  attenuated (blocked) spikes are conducted to the distal axonal regions of the N1M.
  Following pairing the CS triggers a feeding response. A strengthening of the excitatory
  pathway is proposed between the CS sensory pathway and the CBIs. Conditioning reduces
  N3t inhibition of the N1M bringing it closer to the threshold potential for firing
  with full sized spikes present in the N1M distal axon (see text for further discussion).
