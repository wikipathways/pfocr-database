caption: Stimuli including PAMPs and DAMPs trigger the onset of various upstream signaling
  pathways, and these pathways converge to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (left panel).
  The upstream positive signals promote the de-ubiquitination of NLRP3 and allow NLRP3
  to begin recruitment of ASC and caspase-1. The formed mature NLRP3 inflammasome
  then becomes competent for enzymatically processing pro-IL-1β into IL-1β by active
  caspase-1. EPEC and other A/E pathogens use NleA to subvert the normal pathway leading
  to the assembly of the mature NLRP3 inflammasome. This blockade of the pathway occurs
  at stage of NLRP3 activation where NleA directly associated ubuiqtinated and non-ubiqutiinated
  NLRP3, which would prohibit the subsequent inflammasome assembly, resulting in dampening
  of the processing of pro-IL-1β for secretion.
