caption: Effects of hyperglycemia leading to endothelial damage. Healthy endothelium
  (A) has signaling through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2)
  pathway which increases production of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD1).
  Additionally, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) increases expression of glutathione
  peroxidase. Both of these processes decrease oxidative injury. Furthermore, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces increased quantities of nitric oxide (NO),
  which in turn increases vasodilation allowing for healthy circulation. During endothelial
  dysfunction (B), hyperglycemia increases production of vasoactive substances including
  endothilin-1 (EDN1, a vasoconstrictor), von Willebrand factor (VWF, a circulating
  glycoprotein involved in coagulation), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1,
  an inhibitor of fibrinolysis). Thrombosis is increased during endothelial dysfunction
  through an increase in VWF and PAI-1. Endothelial cell proliferation and vasoconstriction
  are promoted by a decrease in NO production by eNOS [,,]. Additionally, an increase
  in angiotensin II (Ang II) pathway activation further promotes vasoconstriction.
  Endothelial activation (C) occurs when advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) bind
  AGEs Receptor (AGER) and activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway
  [,,,]. This upregulates expression of inflammatory markers and cellular adhesion
  molecules like intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion
  molecule-1 (VCAM-1) to encourage macrophage (MΦ) adhesion and chemotaxis [,,,].
  Moreover, IL-1B binds to its receptor on the endothelium and, along with AGEs binding,
  causes inflammation, proliferation, and oxidative stress.
