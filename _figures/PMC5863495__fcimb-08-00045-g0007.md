caption: 'Model for branched signaling pathway of Lvr hybrid two-component system:
  An unknown input signal modulates the autokinase activity of N-terminal HK module
  in LvrA. Upon switching to a kinase-on state, there would be phosphotransfer to
  its downstream HRR module, as well as to LvrB in a branched pathway. Alternatively,
  LvrB can be activated by a small molecule signal such as AcP (Acetyl Phosphate).
  After phosphotransfer events, Lvr proteins influence the expression of virulence
  and motility genes either by activation of putative downstream RRs or by protein-protein
  interactions.'
