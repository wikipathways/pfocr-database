caption: Notch signaling pathway in CCA cells. Notch ligands, such as members of the
  DLL or the JAG family, attach to the Notch receptors to activate the ADAM and γ-secretase
  enzymes. The ADAM cleaves NECD outside the cell membrane and the γ-secretase enzyme
  cleaves the NICD inside of the cell membrane. After being cleaved, the NICD translocates
  to the nucleus and interacts with the DNA-binding protein to promote expression
  of the target genes, such as Hes and Hey, which are associated with proliferation,
  migration and, invasion of CCA cells. CCA, cholangiocarcinoma; Hes, hairy and enhancer
  of split; Hey, Hes-related to YRPW motif; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease;
  NECD, Notch extracellular domain; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; DLL, delta-like
  family; JAG, Jagged family.
