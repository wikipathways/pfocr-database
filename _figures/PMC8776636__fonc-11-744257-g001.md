caption: Ovarian developmental processes and some of the mechanical pathways involved.
  (A) The growth and development process of follicle and related signal pathways.
  Follicle development goes through primordial, primary, secondary, and mature follicles
  four stages. (B) PI3K/AKT signal pathway participate in primordial follicles activation.
  PI3K was activated by growth factor KIT LIGAND (KL) and converted phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) at
  the cell membrane, leading to AKT phosphorylation and activation, eventually lead
  to primordial follicles activation (). (C) Activated state of Hippo signaling in
  granulosa cells (left). Uncharacterized upstream factors stimulate the Hippo signaling
  cascade (MST1/2 and LATS1/2) to phosphorylate and restrict the activition of two
  transcriptional coactivators (YAP and TAZ). Disruption of Hippo signaling in granulosa
  cells (right). Physical force disrupt the Hippo signaling cascade by translocating
  un-phosphorylated YAP/TAZ into the nucleus to bind the TEAD transcriptional factors,
  thus induce expression of CCN which are involved in granulosa cell proliferation
  and survival, leading to follicle growth (). (D) Other related signal pathways in
  follicle development.
