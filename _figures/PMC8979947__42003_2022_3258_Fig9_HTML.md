caption: 'Talin rod domains exhibit strong tension-dependent conformational changes
  which can further be modulated by both classes of chaperones: unfoldase and foldase.
  In the absence of chaperones, R3 unfolds at 10 pN force while it shifts to 15 pN
  or 7 pN, in the presence of foldase and unfoldase chaperones, respectively. This
  altered-mechanical stability could influence cellular physiology by tuning the downstream
  signaling pathways. Unfoldases such as Hsp70 and Hsp40 shift the folding dynamics
  of R3 domain towards the unfolded state, thereby, favoring the RIAM dissociation
  and vinculin interaction. Subsequently, this induces RhoA signaling, downstream
  MLC-2 activation, and thus, enhances the force generation at growing adhesion to
  facilitate cell migration. By contrast, foldase (DsbA) shifts the folding dynamics
  towards the folded state which subsequently promotes RIAM binding to the talin domains
  and localization in nascent adhesion. This negatively regulates the RhoA pathway
  which in turn abrogates MLC-2 activation, force generation, and cell migration.'
