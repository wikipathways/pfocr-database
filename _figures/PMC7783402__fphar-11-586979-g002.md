caption: Role of IIS signaling pathway in reproduction and its longevity Schematic
  diagram elicits that IIS is actively involved in reproductive function and lifespan
  in C. elegans D. melanogaster or mice. In brief, ILP receptor binds with transmembrane
  for IIS tyrosine kinase receptor (DAF-2 in C. elegans), that autophosphorylates
  and recruits and finally stimulating key substrates, through different channels
  directly or via receptor substrate intermediate. Once the simulation of PI3k/Akt
  branch of IIS (left) takes place, it converts PI(4,5)P2 into second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3;
  which are negatively regulated by phospholipid phosphatases such as the PI3-phosphatase
  PTEN. Activation of PI (3,4,5) P3 causes recruitment 3-phosphoinositide–dependent
  protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) and its substrate, Akt/protein kinase B. Once the Akt pathway
  stimulates different cellular substrates not mentioned here, consisting of Rab-GTPase–activating
  protein AS160, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and TSC1/TSC2. The Akt is a key regulator
  of FoxO transcription factor (DAF-16 in C. elegans); that phosphorylates by Akt
  resulting in inhibition of transcriptional activity through bringing Akt back into
  the cytoplasm. On the other hand, Ras/MAPK branch of IIS (right), binds with adaptor
  protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Son of sevenless (SOS)
  to the activated IIS receptor, either directly or through docking protein, and hence
  it allows SOS to catalyze from inactive GDP-bound Ras to active GTP-bound Ras. The
  stimulation of small GTPase Ras activates of the serine/threonine kinase Raf, that
  leads to stepwise phosphorylation and activation of MEK1/MEK2 and then ERK1/ERK2.
  While the stimulation of ERK1 phosphorylates numerous cellular and nuclear substrates
  not display here, RSK and ELK1. Green color shows phosphorylation (kinase activity),
  whereas, (orange color) highlight dephosphorylating (phosphatase activity).
