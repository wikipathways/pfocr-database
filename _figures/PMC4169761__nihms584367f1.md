caption: 'Leptin binding to LepRb activates the LepRb-associated JAK-2 tyrosine kinase
  (green arrows), leading to the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on JAK-2
  and the phosphorylation of Tyr985 and Tyr1138 on the intracellular tail of LepRb
  (green arrows). Tyr985 and Tyr1138 are directly autophosphorylated after activation
  of LepRb, and phosphorylated Tyr1138 mediates the activation of the transcription
  factor STAT-3, and phosphorylated Tyr985 binds to SHP-2. Among other targets, STAT-3
  induces the transcription of SOCS-3 during LepRb signalling in the nucleus (blue
  arrow). SOCS-3 is produced and released from the nucleus (grey arrow). The binding
  of phosphorylated Tyr985 to SHP-2 provides an important site of inhibition for SOCS-3
  (red arrow). Furthermore, SOCS-3 inhibits STAT-3 and via binding to the LepRb-JAK-2
  complex it attenuates LepRb-mediated signalling, and thereby LepRb-mediated signalling
  via the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway. At high levels of circulating leptin as observed in
  obesity, LepRbs are highly activated and subsequently tyrosine residues are intensely
  phosphorylated. In case of LepRb this will lead to increased ‘leptin signalling’
  via the JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway, while phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues will
  lead to increased expression of SOCS-3 which inhibits LepRb-mediated signalling.
  This inhibition could attenuate most of the expected increase in LepRb signalling,
  and explain leptin resistance in obesity. ()Abbreviations: LepRb: Leptin receptor
