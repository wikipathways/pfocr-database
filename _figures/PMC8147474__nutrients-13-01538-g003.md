caption: Various factors affecting skeletal muscle maintenance in aged patients with
  advanced CKD/HD. In aged patients with advanced CKD/HD, various factors have interaction
  with and transduce their effects intracellularly, thus affecting skeletal muscle
  maintenance. Insulin and IGF-I positively regulate skeletal muscle maintenance via
  binding of their cognate receptors. Subsequent activation of mTORC1 through PI3K/Akt
  is necessary for protein synthesis. Simultaneously, insulin-stimulated PI3K/Akt
  increases FOXO phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of its translocation into
  the nucleus. On the other hand, myostatin, a negative regulator, binds to ActRIIB.
  Subsequent phosphorylation of Smad2/3 reduces Akt activation and decreases FOXO
  phosphorylation. Intranuclear translocated FOXO activates transcription of MuRF1
  and Atrogin-1, which accelerates protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. Defective mitochondrial quality control (derangements in fusion-fission)
  leads to ROS production and results in muscle protein degradation. Vitamin D is
  involved in muscle differentiation and proliferation by binding VDR, which is accompanied
  by interaction with muscle protein metabolism. Among amino acids, leucin activates
  mTORC1 by binding to Sestrin2, leading to protein synthesis. In addition, satellite
  cells, which can be modulated by the various aforementioned factors, may contribute
  to muscle maintenance. CKD, chronic kidney disease; HD, hemodialysis; ActRIIB, activin
