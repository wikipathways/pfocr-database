caption: Ensemble representation of EGF signalling network. Alternate signal transmission
  routes connecting the extracellular ligand EGF to the sentinel marker of pathway
  activity MAPK3 (ERK). Shortest paths (Ai), and total number of paths as a function
  of path length (Aii), color-coded by database source. (B) The “consensus” linear
  EGF pathway, with edges color-coded by source, plus additional connections through
  the ensemble network color-coded grey. Note the Ensemble network edges are derived
  from multiple sources, with all connections in the consensus pathway represented
  in at least 3 different databases.
