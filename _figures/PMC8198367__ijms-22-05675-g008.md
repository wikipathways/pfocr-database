caption: The schematic representation shows that DHA attenuates H2O2-induced hepatocyte
  injury through ERK1/2-dependent mitophagy. Oxidative stress would induce hepatocyte
  apoptosis by impairing mitochondrial function. DHA and TUG891 (a agonist of GPR120)
  supplementation activates GPR120/ERK1/2 signaling pathway which regulates PINK1/Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy. The up-regulation of protective mitophagy level promotes mitochondrial
  renewal and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis during oxidative injury. However,
  inhibiting the activation of ERK1/2 and autophagy by selective inhibitor U0126 or
  3-MA, respectively, could block the protective effect of DHA.
