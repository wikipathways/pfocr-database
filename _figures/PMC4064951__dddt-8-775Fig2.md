caption: 'Resistance to BRAF inhibitors: intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.Notes:
  Multiple different mechanisms have been described in resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
  Resistance mechanisms are generally grouped as intrinsic to the MAPK pathway or
  extrinsic to the MAPK pathway. Each mechanism is listed in the fgure. Intrinsic
  pathway: (a) Extracellular growth factor receptor upregulation. Upregulation of
  several extracellular growth factor receptors including IGFR1, EGFR, and PDGFR have
  been described at the time of resistance to BRAF inhibition. (b) Mutation in NRAS.
  Activating NRAS mutations, which are present in 20% of cutaneous melanomas, have
  been described at the time of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. (c) BRAF amplification
  and splice variants. While additional mutations in BRAF have not been reported,
  amplification of BRAF as well as activating splice variants have been described
  in the setting of BRAF-inhibitor resistance. (d) Mutations in MEK (MEK1). Activation
  mutations in the downstream kinase, MEK1, have been described in the setting of
  resistance to a BRAF inhibitor. (e) CRAF-dependent activation. Eelevated CRAF levels
  can lead to a shift of tumor cells’ dependency from BRAF to CRAF. (f) Increased
  expression of COT. The increased expression of COT, a MAPK, leads to ERK activation
  through MEK independent of BRAF signaling, promoting BRAF-inhibitor resistance.
  (g) NF1 mutation. The loss of function of the tumor suppressor NF1, which inhibits
  RAS activity, has also been associated with resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
  Extrinsic Pathway: (h) PTEN loss. The loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN, is associated
  with BRAF-inhibitor resistance, and patients with PTEN loss treated with a BRAF
  inhibitor had a decreased PFS as compared to patients without loss of PTEN. (i)
  HGF. Increased production of HGF by stromal cells has been observed in the setting
  of BRAF-inhibitor resistance. (j) Gain of function of PIK3CA. Gain-of-function PIK3CA
  mutations have been reported in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. (k) TORC1 expression.
  Higher pretreatment levels of TORC1, a downstream component of the AKT-PI3K pathway,
  are associated with resistance to BRAF inhibitors. (l) Cyclin D1 and CDK4. BRAF-mutant
  melanoma cell lines that overexpressed both cyclin D1 and CDK-4 exhibited primary
  resistance to BRAF inhibitors.Abbreviations: AKT-PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
