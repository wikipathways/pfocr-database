caption: Functional analysis of IL20RB in ccRCC. (a) The PPI (protein-protein interaction)
  networks of IL20RB are displayed by STRING. Genes involved in the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway are in red, genes involved in the PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway
  in cancer are in green, and genes involved in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance
  are in blue. (b) Gene set enrichment analysis between the high and low IL20RB expression
  groups.
