caption: Proposed pathway disturbances in the pathogenesis of PCOS-related skeletal
  muscle dysfunction. Inter-organ crosstalk highlighting liver, adipose tissue, myokines,
  chronic inflammation and androgen excess with likely bidirectional implications
  for metabolic perturbations in PCOS. Intracellular androgen receptor binding with
  nuclear translocation of the androgen-bound AR receptor demonstrated.AMPK, adenosine
  monophosphate–activated protein kinase; CHO, carbohydrate; DAG, diacylglyceride;
  FFA, free fatty acid, IMTG, intramyocellular triglyceride; IR, insulin resistance;
  LCFA, long-chain fatty acid; PGC1a, peroxisome proliferator coactivator 1a; PI(3)K,
  phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase; PKB/Akt, protein kinase B/Akt; TBC1D4, TBC1 domain
  family member 4, also known as Akt substrate 160 (AS160).
