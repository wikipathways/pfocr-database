caption: In the absence of inhibition HOX and PBX dimerize, enter the nucleus, and
  bind to HOX/PBX consensus sequences present in numerous target genes. These include
  cFos, DUSP1, and ATF3, all of which are inhibited by HOX/PBX dimers. HXR9 mimics
  the hexapeptide loop of HOX proteins that binds to a pocket in PBX, thereby acting
  as a competitive inhibitor of this interaction. HOX/PBX inhibition greatly increases
  cFos transcription, and the resulting protein can dimerize with Jun (not shown)
  to activate FasL transcription. FasL protein then binds to the Fas receptor (FasR)
  and activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The transcription of ATF3 and DUSP1
  is also enhanced by HXR9. ATF3 stabilizes p53, which in turn promotes mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis and blocks proliferation, while DUSP1 dephosphorylates MEK and ERK, silencing
  Ras mediated signalling.
