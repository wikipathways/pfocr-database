caption: 'Upon binding B7-1 or B7-2, CTLA-4 recruits the phosphatases SHP2 and PP2A
  via the YVKM motif in its cytoplasmic domain. SHP2 recruitment results in attenuation
  of TCR signaling by dephosphorylating the CD3ζ chain. PP2A recruitment results in
  downstream dephosphorylation of AKT, further dampening the T cell activation pathway.
  PD-1 ligation by PD-L1 or PD-L2 also recruits SHP2 to the ITIM domain, resulting
  in membrane proximal decreases in TCR signaling. LAG-3 signaling is dependent on
  interaction with its ligand, MHC II, as well as its intracellular KIEELE domain.
  TIM-3 binds to Galectin-9, as well as other ligands. In the absence of ligand binding,
  TIM-3 is associated with Bat3, protecting the cell from TIM-3 mediated inhibition
  and allowing for greater activation. However, once TIM-3 binds to Galectin-9, Y265
  is phosphorylated and the interaction with Bat3 is disrupted, allowing TIM-3 to
  deliver inhibitory signals to the T cell. BTLA and CD160 bind to Herpes Virus Entry
  Mediator (HVEM). BTLA contains an intracellular ITIM domain that may be important
  in signaling. 2B4 binds to CD48, but further signaling mechanisms are poorly understood.
  Ig domains are depicted in orange, mucin domains in green, cysteine rich domains
  in brown, and GPI anchors are depicted as bolded black lines.Current therapeutics
  to block checkpoint signaling molecules include both monoclonal antibodies and Ig
  fusion proteins. 1) Anti-CTLA-4: Ipilimumab (BMS-734016), Tremelimumab (CP-675,206)
