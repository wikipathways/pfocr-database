caption: Summary diagram of the proposed mechanisms underlying protective effects
  of C3G against glutamate-induced oxidative/ER stress apoptosis in HT22 cells. Prolonged
  glutamate-induced ROS production stimulates oxidative stress lead to ER stress.
  The resultant oxidative stress activate the specific ER stress apoptosis mechanisms
  involving calcium ion-mediated calpain activation contribute to caspase-12 cascades
  apoptosis signal, together with CHOP apoptosis pathway. C3G is able to reduce ROS
  and trigger survival marker proteins including p-ERK/ERK and Nrf2 expression, leading
  to an increase level of the endogenous antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes
  function. As a consequence, these effects resulted in the inhibition of apoptotic-ER
  stress signaling proteins and enhancing HT22 neuronal cell survival via the ERK/Nrf2
  signaling pathway
