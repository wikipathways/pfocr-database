caption: We show in normal human astrocytes (NHA) that cocaine treatment increased
  type I interferon responses in a concentration-dependent manner (). In parallel
  to increases in type I interferon, cocaine increases intracellular DNA fragmentation
  and ROS levels that are reduced with antioxidants PPF and PIO (). Likewise, antiviral
  signaling pathway, TBK1/IRF3, is activated by cocaine and HIV-1, but can be prevented
  with PPF and PIO (). Phosphorylation and translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus results
  in type I interferon gene transcription, including ISG15, IFNα1 and IFNβ1, which
  are increased upon cocaine, but reduced with PPF and PIO, exposure (). Moreover,
  HIV-1 increased antiviral genes which were also reduced upon cocaine pretreatment;
  the glial modulators PPF and PIO reduced either cocaine or HIV-1-mediated increases
  in type I interferon back to baseline levels (). Lastly, at the RNA and protein
  levels, we demonstrated that cocaine pretreatment reduced the ability of HIV-1 or
  ZIKV to initiate robust type I interferon responses when compared to virus alone
  ( and ). Thus, our work demonstrates that preventing cocaine-mediated increases
  in type I interferon by targeting oxidative stress and cytotoxicity with glial modulators,
  PPF or PIO, may recover viral-mediated increases in astrocyte antiviral responses,
  allowing for astrocytes to initiate a stronger innate immune response to infiltrating
  viruses.
