caption: 'Overview of the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway and the role of A20 and
  OTULIN proteins (created by Biorender). Mutations in proteins that can result in
  BD-like phenotypes are shown in bold. Induction of the pathway by Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), T-cell receptors (TCRs), B-cell receptors (BCRs) and cytokine receptors
  (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, etc.) initiates a cascade, followed by the stimulation of IκB
  kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of three subunits: IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (NEMO,
  NF-κB essential modulator). Activation of IκBα via phosphorylation leads to release
  of NF-κB1, which is essentially a dimer composed of RelA/p65 and p50. RelA/p50 complex
  subsequently translocates to the nucleus, leading to activation of the NF-κB pathway,
  regulation of genes and, ultimately, transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.
  Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that consists of HOIL-1, HOIP and
  SHARPIN activates NF-κB pathway by ligation of linear ubiquitin chains to NEMO and
  RIP1. OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN) functions as a
  deubiquitinating enzyme that catalyzes linear ubiquitin chains from proteins modified
  by the LUBAC, thereby controlling overactivation of the NF-κB pathway. Similarly,
  A20 protein is also shown to contain deubiquitinase and E3 ligase domains, which
  also results in deubiquitination of NF-κB upstream proteins, hence negatively regulating
  inflammation. These findings may elucidate the mechanisms by which mutations in
  A20 and OTULIN result in overactivation of the NF-κB signalling pathway and, consequently,
  enhanced inflammatory response. Abbreviations: IKKα and IKKβ, inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa kinase subunit α and β; LUBAC, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex;
