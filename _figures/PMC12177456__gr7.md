caption: A working model for the FLR2–CPR5–OsEIL1 signaling pathway underlying rice
  immunity to Magnaporthe oryzae.The receptor-like kinase FLR2, which is localized
  at the plasma membrane, phosphorylates the N-terminal domain of CPR5 (CPR5-N). This
  phosphorylation modulates the function of CPR5 in RNA metabolism, influencing the
  alternative polyadenylation (APA) of OsEIL1 pre-mRNA. The modified poly(A) tail
  increases the translational efficiency of OsEIL1 mRNA, thereby increasing OsEIL1
  protein production. OsEIL1 directly activates the expression of OsRBOHA/B, which
  leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and coordinates jasmonic acid
  (JA)-mediated phytoalexin production. These responses promote plant immunity to
  M. oryzae. This regulatory mechanism warrants further investigation
