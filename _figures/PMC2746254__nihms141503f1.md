caption: 'Pathway model for studying the influence of drug-binding kinetics on EGF
  signaling in non-small cell lung cancer. A:B represents a complex between A and
  B. A-P denotes the phosphorylated form of A and A-PP represents the doubly phosphorylated
  form of A. A* indicates the activated form of A. (Note: The single-direction arrows
  do not imply all reactions are unidirectional – some represent reversible reactions.)'
