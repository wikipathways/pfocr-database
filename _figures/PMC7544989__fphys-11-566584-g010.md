caption: 'Overview of ouabain effects in cultured human skeletal muscle cells. (A)
  In the first phase (1–6 h), ouabain stimulates proteolysis of NKA and starts to
  suppress the basal phosphorylation of STAT3 and the HIF-1 pathway. The Akt pathway
  is activated. (B) In the second phase (6–12 h), ouabain activates the ERK1/2 pathway,
  possibly via Src-dependent and independent mechanisms, as well as the mTOR pathway.
  (C) In the third phase (12–24 h), ouabain upregulates expression of NKAα1 (ATP1A1
  gene) as well as expression and secretion of IL-6. The IL-6/STAT3 and the HIF-1
  pathways are markedly suppressed (Note: Alterations in the [K+]i:[Na+]i ratio are
  inferred based on the published data. The thickness of lines indicates the intensity
  of the effects).'
