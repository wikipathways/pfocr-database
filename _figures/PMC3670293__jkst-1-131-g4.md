caption: Figure 4. Interaction between the JAK-STAT pathway and the CLP-1-P-TEFb transcriptional
  regulatory mechanism. In the absence of hypertrophic signals, STAT3 remains cytoplasmic
  and CLP-1 inhibits P-TEFb. This keeps RNA pol II in the initiation state and STAT-responsive
  genes untranscribed. In the presence of hypertrophic signals, STAT3 is activated
  and STAT3 dimers are mobilized to the nucleus where they bind to cdk9-cyclin T1
  complexes (active P-TEFb) and prevent binding by the CLP-1 repressor. The STAT3-P-TEFb
  complex is then recruited to STAT3 target genes via binding to specific STAT3 binding
  sites within the proximal promoter of these genes. Recruitment of chromatin modifiers
  by STAT3 (not shown) opens chromatin to access by RNA pol II, which upon phosphorylation
  by active cdk9 kinase resumes synthesis of paused, nascent RNA transcripts.
