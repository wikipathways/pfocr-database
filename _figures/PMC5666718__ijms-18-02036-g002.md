caption: Loss of proteome stability during ageing impacts on genome (and metabolome)
  integrity, resulting in disease prone cells/organisms. Young biological systems
  are characterized by low levels of damaged biomolecules due to highly active proteostatic
  pathways and stress responses (e.g., the Nrf2 pathway). This period of life is characterized
  by genome stability as a result of precise duplication and effective repair pathways
  (blue arrows in left panel denote balanced cross-talk among shown pathways and regulatory
  modules). On the other hand, the age-related collapse of proteostatic modules functionality
  and/or expression levels (red arrows; upper right panel), along with increased oxidative
  stress and the accumulation of non-functional polypeptides and/or protein aggregates
  (black arrows; upper right panel), compromises proteome integrity leading to significantly
  reduced chances of survival/health due to metabolic alterations and/or genomic instability
  (caused by ineffective DNA maintenance and/or repair). Eventually, a vicious circle
  (red arrows; lower right panel) may be formed where a mildly unstable genome accelerates
  proteome instability (and consequently metabolic alterations) due to synthesis of
  mutated polypeptides, which progressively increase the attrition of protein machines.
  This vicious circle gradually results in an increasingly stressful cellular landscape
  that favors the appearance of age-related diseases (e.g., cancer).
