caption: 'FSH signaling pathway in SCs. After FSH binds to FSHR on the membrane of
  SCs, FSH signaling is activated. FSHR recruits different types of G proteins to
  mediate different signaling pathways. Recruitment of Gβγ subunits activates the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promoting the translation of mRNAs. Recruitment
  of the Gɑ subunit activates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Activated PKA directly
  phosphorylates the CREB protein in the nucleus. Phosphorylated CREB binds to CREs
  of target genes to regulate transcriptional activity. In addition, PKA activates
  ERK during Sertoli cell proliferation. ERK activation is also mediated by recruiting
  the Gɑi subunit. Recently, FSH-induced RA signaling was reported. FSH promotes RA
  biosynthesis through a cAMP-dependent pathway. RA translocates into the nucleus
  and binds to RAR/RXR to regulate target gene transcription. The cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway participates in Sertoli cell differentiation, SSC self-renewal and differentiation,
  spermatogonia proliferation and their entry into meiosis, as well as BTB dynamics.
  The cAMP/PKA/ERK signaling pathway and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induce Sertoli
  cell proliferation. The cAMP/RA signaling pathway has been shown to participate
  in SSC differentiation, spermatogonia differentiation and their entry into meiosis.
