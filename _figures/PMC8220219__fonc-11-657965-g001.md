caption: Regulation of Hippo pathway. LATS1 mediated phosphorylation of YAP prevented
  its nuclear accumulation. However, (A) THAP9-AS1 inhibited LATS1 mediated phosphorylation
  of YAP and promoted its nuclear accumulation. YAP interacted with TEAD and transcriptionally
  upregulated THAP9-AS1. LINC01559 and UCA1 also inhibit phosphorylation of YAP and
  promote its nuclear accumulation. (B) UCA1 formed a complex with MOB1 and LATS1/2
  and not only inhibited MOB1-mediated activation of LATS1/2 but also blocked phosphorylation
  of YAP. TGFβ/SMAD pathway is regulated by lncRNAs. Linc00462 enhanced the expression
  of TGFRI and TGFRII by interfering with miR-665-mediated targeting activity. DLEU2
  also served as an oncogenic lncRNA and inhibited miR-455-mediated targeting of SMAD2.
