caption: The networks of Ingenuity Canonical Pathways results of mRNA of APP/PS1 and
  SAMP8 mice brain tissues. Control and model group that received oral distilled water,
  AEG-treated group at a dosage of 100 mg/[kg⋅d] in AEG, and the extracts were dissolved
  in distilled water and were given by intragastric administration once daily for
  24 weeks, alcohol (AEG) extracts from G. lucidum by gavage. (A) is the increased
  E2F3 signaling_upstream_regulator by AEG; (B) is increased RARA signaling_upstream_regulator
  by AEG and (C) is the Network of different expression mRNA using IPA pathway analysis.
