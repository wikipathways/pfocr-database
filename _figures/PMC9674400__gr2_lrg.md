caption: Schematic diagram of a) the viral structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The
  structural proteins include the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope
  (E) proteins and the RNA viral genome. The key mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and transmission is via infected respiratory droplets, where the viral infection
  is initiated directly or indirectly through contact with the oral mucosal, nasal,
  or conjunctival secretion. b) The structure of the S protein upon binding to the
  ACE2 receptor. c) The viral replication pathway inside the host cells. The S protein
  binds to the ACE2 receptors leading to the fusion of the viral envelope to the host’s
  cell membrane and the subsequent release of the viral genetic material, the viral
  RNA. The release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome into the host cell cytoplasm indicates
  the episodes of viral gene expression. Intracellularly, viral genome expression
  and replication take place to produce copies for incorporation into newly assembled
  viral particles. (Created with BioRender.com).
