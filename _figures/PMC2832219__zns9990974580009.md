caption: Schematic graph showing the signaling pathway involved in hyperdopamine/D2-mediated
  inhibition of synaptic NMDA receptors. High concentration of DA/activation of D2
  receptor activates GSK-3β via its upstream regulator PP2A. GSK-3β in turn phosphorylates
  β-catenin (Ser33/37/Tyr41), which interacts with NR2B, controls the NR2B gene transcription,
  and thus affects the protein synthesis of NR2B subunits. Phosphorylation of NR2B-Ser1480
  and dynamin play an important role for NR2B endocytosis in the DA-induced inhibition
  of NMDA current.
