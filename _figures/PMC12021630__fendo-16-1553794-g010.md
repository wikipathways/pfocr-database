caption: Molecular mechanisms of PGRN in diabetic nephropathy. PGRN expression was
  significantly reduced in the kidneys of STZ-induced diabetic mice, and PGRN deficiency
  resulted in significantly higher kidney weights, kidney weight to body weight ratios,
  dilation of glomerular tunica and capillary atrophy, thickening of the glomerular
  GBM, and widening and loss of podocyte pedicle synapses, which were reversed by
  r-PGRN. Under HG conditions, PGRN expression was reduced in human podocytes (HPC),
  mouse podocytes (MPC), and human renal proximal tubule HK2 cells, and cleavage of
  caspase-3 and PARP1 was reduced, with the opposite result for r-PGRN treatment.
  In vivo, ko-PGRN decreased the ratio of LC3II/I and aggravated autophagy damage
  in the kidneys of diabetic mice foot cells; in vitro, r-PGRN treatment was the opposite.
  PGRN activates AMPK signalling and inhibits mTORC1 activity in HG-treated podocytes,
  resulting in enhanced ULK1 Ser555 phosphorylation sites and reduced ULK1 Ser757
  phosphorylation sites in podocytes, whereas inhibition of the AMPK signalling pathway
  impairs PGRN-rescued autophagy and podocyte survival under hyperglycaemic conditions.
  CAMKK is activated by PGRN in podocytes under HG condition, silencing of the CAMKK-β
  gene or specific inhibition of CAMKK activity reduces PGRN-mediated phosphorylation
  of the AMPKα Thr172 phosphorylation site and ULK1 Ser555 phosphorylation site, and
  BAPTA-AM chelating of the cytoplasmic calcium-free antagonises the PGRN-activated
  AMPKα signalling pathway
