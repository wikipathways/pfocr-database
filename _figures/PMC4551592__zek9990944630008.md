caption: Model for turnover of PM sensors of the filamentous growth pathway. In the
  model, Msb2p, Sho1p, and Opy2p are delivered to the PM by exocytosis. Msb2p is processed
  into a shed extracellular domain (Msb2EX) and a cell-associated signaling domain
  (Msb2P). The proteins regulate the filamentous growth pathway at the PM. Msb2P is
  rapidly turned over in an Rsp5p-dependent manner to attenuate the filamentous growth
  pathway (big arrow). Opy2p is turned over at an intermediate rate (medium arrow),
  and Sho1p is turned over at a low rate (small arrow). How the turnover of Opy2p
  and Sho1p is regulated is not clear (question marks). After endocytosis from the
  PM, Msb2p and Opy2p proteins are trafficked to the vacuole in an ESCRT-dependent
  manner. How Sho1p is delivered to the vacuole is not clear. Ub, ubiquitin.

  description: Model for turnover of PM sensors of the filamentous growth pathway.
    In the model, Msb2p, Sho1p, and Opy2p are delivered to the PM by exocytosis. Msb2p
    is processed into a shed extracellular domain (Msb2EX) and a cell-associated signaling
    domain (Msb2P). The proteins regulate the filamentous growth pathway at the PM.
    Msb2P is rapidly turned over in an Rsp5p-dependent manner to attenuate the filamentous
    growth pathway (big arrow). Opy2p is turned over at an intermediate rate (medium
    arrow), and Sho1p is turned over at a low rate (small arrow). How the turnover
    of Opy2p and Sho1p is regulated is not clear (question marks). After endocytosis
    from the PM, Msb2p and Opy2p proteins are trafficked to the vacuole in an ESCRT-dependent
