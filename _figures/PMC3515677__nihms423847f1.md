caption: 'Summary of the mechanisms of DC-mediated HIV-1 transmission to CD4+ T cells.
  Incoming HIV-1 (virions with green membrane) can be transmitted from DCs to CD4+
  T cells by three distinct mechanisms. First: Trans-infection via the virological
  synapse: HIV-1 can bind to DC-SIGN on the DC surface, “surf” along actin ruffles,
  and become polarized to a pocket structure on the cell surface. When DC contact
  with a CD4+ T cell is established, the virological synapse is formed and stabilized
  through interactions between ICAM-1 and LFA-1. The CD4+ T cell extends a filipodium,
  via actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, into the pocket on the DC surface to capture
  the HIV-1. Second: Trans-infection via the exosome secretion pathway: Endocytosed
  HIV-1 can converge with the exosome secretion pathway in the multi-vesicular bodies
  and HIV-1 can be released in association with exosomes to infect nearby CD4+ T cells.
  Third: Cis-infection: HIV-1 can enter the DC by fusion and undergo its complete
  replication cycle and newly formed infectious HIV-1 (virions with blue membrane)
  bud from the DC and is able to infect nearby CD4+ T cells. DC-SIGN dendritic cell-specific
  intercellular adhesion molecule 3-non-grabbing integrin, ICAM-1 intercellular adhesion
  molecule-1, LFA-1 leukocyte function-associated molecule-1'
