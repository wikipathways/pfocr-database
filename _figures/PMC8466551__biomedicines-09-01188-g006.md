caption: 'A schematic representation of the Smoothened (SMO)-independent regulation
  of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) transcription factors by oncogenic pathways.
  As shown above, GLI transcription factors can be regulated at the protein or transcriptional
  level depending on the oncogenic pathway involved. In the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, sonic hedgehog
  (Shh) produced by tumor cells activates hedgehog (Hh)/GLI signaling in the stromal
  cells, leading to the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFa).
  Paracrine feedback of VEGFa to tumor cells is initiated upon binding of the VEGFa
  to neuropilin 2 (NRP2), which induces α6β1 integrin-mediated activation of kirsten
  rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/ mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  (MEK)/ERK cascade. Active ERK1 then phosphorylates GLI1 protein, leading to its
  activation. Oncogenic KRAS mutations also lead to the constitutive activation of
  the MAPK/MEK/ERK pathway, consequently promoting GLI1 phosphorylation and activation.
  In the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target
  of rapamycin kinase (mTOR)pathway, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) stimulation
  results in the activation of the mTOR complex, which in turn activates S6K2. Consequently,
  activated S6K2 phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) at serine
  9, leading to its inactivation. Inactivated GSK3β is not able to phosphorylate GLI1,
  relieving the inhibition of GSK3β on GLI1. Activation of the mTOR complex also activates
  S6K1 by phosphorylation, and activated S6K1, in turn, phosphorylate GLI1 at Ser9
  to promote its activation. In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, stromal cells produced
  Wnt3a that binds to the LRP5/6 receptor. The signal is then transduced to β-catenin,
  which forms a complex with T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4). The β-catenin-TCF-4 complex
  upregulates the protein expression of coding region determinant binding protein
  (CRD-BP), which stabilizes GLI1 mRNA and consequently enhances GLI1 protein levels.
  In the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-B)/SMAD pathway, stimulation by TGF-β results
  in the activation of SMAD2/3. SMAD2/3 cooperates with the β-catenin-TCF-4 complex
  to upregulate the expression of GLI2 by binding to the SMAD and TCF binding site
  within the GLI2 promoter. In the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway, the p65
  subunit of the NFκB complex binds to the kB binding site within the GLI1 promoter
  to initiate its transcription. Red upward triangle-headed arrow: upregulation.'
