caption: Graphic summary of findings. Pathway 1 shows that morphine administration
  causes tolerance by activation of the EGFR. We have shown that morphine administration
  causes tolerance by activating the EGFR. EGFR (or PDGFR) inhibition eliminates or
  reverses analgesic tolerance, restoring or maintaining the full analgesic effect
  of morphine. Pathway 2 details the effects of EGF administration on tolerance and
  mechanical sensitivity. Giving EGF (or PDGF) to animals chronically induces mechanical
  allodynia and reduces the analgesic effectiveness of a subsequent dose of morphine,
  in effect causing a pre-tolerant state in the absence of prior opioid exposure.
  Both of these phenomena can be blocked or reversed by EGFR or PDGFR inhibition.
  Pathway 3 shows that nerve injury induces release of EGF and PDGF, which subsequently
  activates the EGFR and PDGFR and induces mechanical allodynia. However, EGFR or
  PDGFR inhibition does not reverse the allodynia caused by nerve injury. This is
  likely due to the concomitant activation of a variety of other mediators of allodynia
  by nerve injury. Nerve injury also induces a pre-tolerant state that can be eliminated
  or reversed by EGFR or PDGFR inhibition, suggesting that pre-tolerance is selectively
  mediated by EGFR and/or PDGFR signaling. In sum, we can conclude that EGFR and PDGFR
  signaling mediate morphine analgesic tolerance and can induce a pre-tolerant state
  in opioid-naive animals. While EGFR and PDGFR signaling can induce mechanical allodynia,
  allodynia induced by nerve injury appears to involve a more complex set of mediators.
  However, EGFR or PDGFR inhibition still selectively reverse the decrease in morphine
  analgesia induced by nerve injury (pre-tolerance), suggesting that using these inhibitors
  clinically could permit the sustained treatment of nerve injury pain using far lower
  doses of opioids for extended periods of time.
