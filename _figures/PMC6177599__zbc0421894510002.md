caption: βAPP processing by η-secretase. Full-length βAPP can be processed by an alternative
  pathway involving a first cleavage by η-secretase (MT5–MMP) releasing a soluble
  fragment sAPPη and a membrane-anchored fragment ηCTF. ηCTF is then cleaved either
  by α-secretase or by β-secretase, producing soluble fragments named Aηα and Aηβ,
  respectively. Aηα can undergo subsequent cleavage by β-secretase. Membrane-anchored
  CTFs (αCTF and βCTF) are processed by γ-secretase activity to give rise to AICD,
  full-length Aβ peptides, and Aβ(17-X) peptide.
