caption: This schematic shows the numerous pro-inflammatory mediators produced by
  peri-implant tissue and immune cells reacting to implant debris, which can negatively
  affect bone turnover. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha are
  thought to be some of the most potent cytokines in this cascade of signaling. The
  inflammasome pathway within cells such as macrophages has recently been reported
  to be central to implant debris mediated pro-inflammatory reactivity. Ingestion
  of the debris phagocytosis results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  that affect local cell types and induce a widening zone of soft-tissue damage and
  inflammation. (Courtesy of BioEngineering Solutions Inc)
