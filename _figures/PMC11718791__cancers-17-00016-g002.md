caption: PI3K, cell cycle, and ER pathways crosstalk in HR+ HER- BC. AKT1 phosphorates
  ER and activates the ligand-independent ER pathway. ER can bind p85 and increase
  PI3K pathway signaling. The CCND1/CDK4/6 complex phosphorylates Rb and can negatively
  regulate the TSC1/2 complex to activate mTORC1. A dynamic complex network is formed
  in cancer cells due to the regulation of many substrates and crosstalk between components
  within the pathway or the communication with other signaling pathways. ER and cell
  cycle pathway components are present in gray. The interplay between PI3K and cell
  cycle or ER pathway is indicated by dotted lines. (Figure created in BioRender.com)
