caption: Role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase pathway in the pituitary and ovary.(a) GnRH released from hypothalamus binds
  to GnRH receptor on anterior pituitary gonadotropic cells, leading to MAPK/ERK pathway
  activation. Activated ERK will regulate expression of genes involved in gonadotropin
  synthesis including αGSU, LHβ and FSHβ. The expression of MAPK phosphatases is also
  regulated by activated ERK in order to control ERK function; (b) pituitary-secreted
  LH and FSH in granulosa cell causes ERK activation and subsequent p-ERK accumulation
  and steroidogenesis. Synthesized steroids will inhibit pituitary and hypothalamic
  function in a negative feedback loop.αGSU, gonadotropin α subunit; E2; estradiol,
  ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; FSHβ,
  FSH beta; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; LHβ, LH
  beta; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; p-ERK, phosphorylated ERK; P4; progesterone;
  GNRHR, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor.
