caption: Effects of estrogens on myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer and autoimmune
  diseases. Estrogens promote the development of estrogen receptor-positive cancers,
  but not estrogen receptor-negative cancers, by binding to the ER and activating
  signaling. Estrogens activate the STAT3 pathway in bone marrow myeloid precursors
  through the ER, leading to increased MDSCs with immunosuppressive activity on T
  cells in the tumor microenvironment. Estrogens also contribute to the accumulation
  of MDSCs in blood by promoting TNF-α secretion in SLE. MDSCs have a proinflammatory
  role in the pathogenesis of SLE by regulating the Th17 cell/Treg balance. Estrogens
  are strongly implicated in the gender differences in autoimmune diseases and may
  have an important role in MDSCs. EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis;
