caption: 'Cross-talk of Dyrk1B in signaling pathways in development and disease. Serum
  mitogens down-regulate Dyrk1B through the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In
  turn, Dyrk1B is implicated in glucose homeostasis through the inhibition of the
  RAS–RAF–MEK pathway in metabolic syndrome which is accompanied by diabetes. In cancer,
  Dyrk1B is involved in a complex cross-talk with Hedgehog (Hh). Dyrk1B inhibits ‘canonical’
  Hh signaling initiated by Smoothened, while it promotes ‘non-canonical’ Hh signaling
  and oncogenic Gli1 activity by promoting PI3K/mTOR/AKT signaling and PI3K–AKT-mediated
  stability of the Gli1 transcription factor. Conversely, activated AKT directly inhibits
  the expression of Dyrk1B. In cancer, oncogenic mutant RAS (KRAS) initiates the ‘non-canonical’
  HH pathway through the activation of Dyrk1B, via an elusive mechanism, employing
  several RAS effectors such as RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and RLF/RAL. Dashed lines represent
  indirect mechanisms and yellow star represents phosphorylation HH: Hedgehog; ERK:
