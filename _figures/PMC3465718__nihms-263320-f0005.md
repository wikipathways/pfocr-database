caption: (A) Summary of the regulation of phase II and anti-oxidative genes via the
  Keap 1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. In the cytoplasm, under basal level, newly synthesized
  Nrf2 is constitutively bound to Keap 1 forming a dimmer. Nrf2-Keap 1 which is then
  directed to go through ubiquitination (ubiquitin, Ub) and converted to Nrf2-Ub is
  degraded by proteasomal degradation (blue arrows). Oxidants such as ROS, RNS and
  dietary chemopreventive compounds react with redox reactive cysteines in Keap 1
  (SH groups), disrupting the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap 1, hence allowing
  the transcriptional factor Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2
  dimerizes with small MAF (sMAF)-family proteins and bind to antioxidant response
  element (ARE), which is located in the promoter of the phase II and anti-oxidative
  genes, resulting in increased transcriptional activity (red arrows). Numerous reports
  have found that chemopreventive agents also interact with other kinase signaling
  pathways, please see the text for more detailed discussion. (B) A simplified putative
  model for crosstalk between Nrf2 and NfkB in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Stimulus
  from ROS, RNS and / chemopreventive compounds could directly interact with members
  of MAPKs family, as well as interacting with Nrf2 and NfkB pathways concurrently,
  such multiple interactions allow chemopreventive compounds to exert their beneficial
  cancer preventive and therapeutic properties.
