caption: (A) The IL-1 signaling loop is initiated by microbial stimulation of TLRs,
  which through canonical TLR signaling via IRAK1, IRAK4, TRAF6, IKK complex, and
  NF-κB activation, leads to IL-1β production. IL-1β activates its own receptor, which
  also signals via the same TLR pathway components to produce IL-1β. Through an unknown
  mechanism, impaired SHP1 function in Ptpn6spin cells results in a failure to downregulate
  IL-1 signaling, which continues to stimulate its own production. This uninhibited
  IL-1 signaling loop (B) ultimately causes chronic inflammation and autoimmunity
  in Ptpn6spin mice. Derivation into a germfree environment and inactivating mutations
  in MyD88, IRAK4, and IL-1R suppress disease in Ptpn6spin mutants.
