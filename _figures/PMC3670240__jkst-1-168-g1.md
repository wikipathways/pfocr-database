caption: 'Figure 1. Regulation of the LIF-mediated signaling pathway in mouse ESCs.
  LIF causes heterodimerization of LIFR and gp130. LIF causes phosphorylation and
  activation of JAK, which is tethered to the intracellular region of gp130. Activated
  JAK phosphorylates gp130 and its tyrosine phosphorylations causes interaction with
  STAT3. Then STAT3 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK and is homodimerized via
  its SH2 domains. The dimerized STAT3 translocates to the nucleus and activates target
  gene transcription. JAK-STAT3 activates Klf4, which maintains Oct3/4 expression
  via Nanog. JAK activates PI3K, which acts as an activator for AKT. AKT then upregulates
  Tbx3 as another pluripotency gene. The JAK-STAT pathway is negatively regulated
  by several inhibitory systems: dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases including
  SHP and physical inhibition or ubiquitin-mediated degradation of JAK by SOCS. JAK
  phosphorylates SHP and then SHP interacts with the Grb2/SOS complex to activate
  the MAPK pathway, leading to inhibition of Tbx3 and Nanog. TRIM8 likely negatively
  regulates Hsp90β-mediated translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus of ESCs. SLIM
  is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the JAK-STAT signal pathway,
  but SLIM is expressed at a low level in mouse ESCs. P, phosphorylation.'
