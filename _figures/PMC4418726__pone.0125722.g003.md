caption: 'The top and bottom panels showed the detailed pathways and genes involved
  in the biosynthesis of four types lignin and PhGs, respectively. Red diamonds represent
  the common pathway shared by lignin and PhGs. Green dotted lines were used to represent
  the synthesis pathway of 5-Hydroxyl-Guaiacyl lignin, which was identified in COMT
  deficient plants. Abbreviation: PAL(Phenylalanine ammonialyas), 4CL(4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase), CYP73A(trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase), CCR(cinnamoyl-CoA reductase),
