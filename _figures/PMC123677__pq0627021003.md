caption: Model for the action of S-phase checkpoints in the suppression of spontaneous
  genome instability. Three different checkpoints that respond to DNA damage (errors)
  that occur during DNA replication are illustrated. (A) The RAD24 intra-S checkpoint
  branch in which the MEC1–DDC2 complex and RAD17–MEC3–DDC1 complex (loaded by RAD24–RFC2-5)
  assemble onto DNA damage and then interact with RAD9–RAD53 and PDS1 through CHK1.
  Interaction with the RAD50–MRE11–XRS2 (MRE11) complex occurs through TEL1 in a MEC1-independent
  manner. The MRE11 complex appears to be required for the full activity of MEC1-
  and TEL1-dependent responses. (B) The SGS1 intra-S checkpoint branch, which is similar
  to that in A except that SGS1 substitutes for the RAD17–MEC3–DDC1 and RAD24–RFC2-5
  complexes. (C) The replication checkpoint in which the MEC1–DDC2 complex and the
  POL2–DPB11–DRC1 complex and presumably PCNA, loaded by RFC, assemble onto replication
  damage and interact with PDS1 and DUN1. Interaction with the MRE11 complex occurs
  through TEL1 in a MEC1-independent manner. The MRE11 complex appears to be required
  for the full activity of TEL1-dependent but not MEC1-dependent responses. SGS1 also
  may play a minor role in this checkpoint. Within each illustrated checkpoint branch,
  the thick arrows indicate the major signaling pathways consistent with genetic interaction
  analysis, and the thin arrows indicate the less important signaling pathway. The
  dashed arrow indicates that MEC1 may only weakly interact with the MRE11 complex.
  The arrows from the MRE11 complex to the central checkpoint proteins indicate the
  cases in which MRE11 complex activity is required for full activity of the checkpoint.
  The shading indicates those genes in which single mutations cause major increases
  in genome instability, presumably through inactivation of the replication checkpoint.
