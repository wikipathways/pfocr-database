caption: The class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Class IA
  PI3Ks consist of p110α/p85, p110β/p85, and p110δ/p85. Upon growth factor or insulin
  stimulation, receptor tyrosine kinases activate class IA PI3Ks by direct interaction
  with the p85 subunit or indirectly through adaptor proteins associated with the
  receptors (e.g. insulin receptor substrate 1, IRS1). The activated PI3K converts
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), an important secondary messenger, at the membrane. Phosphatase and tensin
  homolog deleted (PTEN) functions as a lipid phosphatase to antagonize this conversion.
  When PTEN is lost or mutated, as is the case in many types of cancers, PIP3 accumulates
  and recruits proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to the cell membrane,
  including serine threonine protein kinase AKTs and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1). Once positioned at cell membrane, AKTs are activated by PDK1 at T308 and
  mTORC2 at S473. Activation of AKT promotes a broad spectrum of downstream events,
  including protein synthesis, proliferation, and glucose metabolism through phosphorylation
  of myriad cellular substrates, including mTORC1, GSK3β, FOXO1, and BAD. There are
  also non-AKT-dependent effectors of PI3K signaling, such as RAC1, SGK and PKC. In
  another scenario, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are activated by chemokines
  or lysophosphatidic acid, activate class IB PI3K (p110γ/P101) through the Gβγ subunit
  of trimeric G proteins. BAD, BCL2-associated aganist of cell death; FOXO1, forkhead
  box O1 (also known as FKHR); GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; PKC, protein kinase C; RAC1, RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
  1; SGK, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase; S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase;
  4E-BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1.
