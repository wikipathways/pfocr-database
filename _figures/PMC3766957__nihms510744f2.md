caption: A schematic representation of the metabolic routes interconnected with fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) is shown. Central metabolic processes are depicted such as
  glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the Krebs cycle, the electron transport
  chain (ETC) and FAO. Fatty acids for FAO can either be of extracellular origin (through
  a first shortening in the peroxisomal FAO for very long fatty acids) or be obtained
  through the metabolism of triglycerides from lipid droplets. The fate of FAO products
  is summarized. NADH and FADH2 are oxidized in the ETC for ATP production and acetyl
  CoA enters the Krebs cycle to produce citrate, which can be exported to the cytoplasm
  to engage NADPH-producing reactions. Importantly, the accumulation of fatty acids
  that do not undergo β-oxidation can induce lipotoxicity. Of note, FAO-independent
  activities of components in this route are depicted. Dashed arrows represent indirect
  effects or serial reactions. 6PGLDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP kinase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; IDH1, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1; ME1, malic enzyme; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) kinase; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor; UCP, uncoupling protein.
