caption: Metabolic reprogramming of HSCs during hepatic fibrosis. HSC activation is
  accompanied by a sequence of metabolic changes that allow the cell to meet their
  energetic demands that are required to materialize their newly acquired capabilities.
  Recent classification has subdivided activated cells depending on their expression
  profile, being pro-regenerative (increased growing factors), anti-regenerative (high
  pro-fibrogenic profile), and a subgroup with mixed phenotype. Once activated, genes
  that are related with retinol catabolism, such as retinyl ester hydrolase (REH),
  are upregulated, while enzymes that are involved in retinol esterification, such
  a lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), are downregulated. Consequently, lipid
  droplets disappear and they are metabolized to fuel the β-oxidation pathway. Enzymes
  that are involved in lipid metabolism such as the Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are upregulated
  and adipogenic regulators such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c)
  are downregulated. Interestingly, the activated HSCs increase also their rate of
  aerobic glycolysis and the corresponding relevant enzymes while gluconeogenesis
  enzymes are reduced. Lactate accumulates intracellularly as well as the reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, while the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) pathway is downregulated. These metabolic changes are controlled, at
  least partially, by the activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway via the expression
  of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) together with transforming growth factor-β1
  (TGF-β1). Glutaminolysis and protein metabolism is also upregulated alongside their
  rate-limiting enzymes, such as glutaminase-1 (GLS-1). This process is also regulated
  by the Hh pathway, this time via the transcription factor Yes-associated protein
  1 (YAP) and its transcriptional cofactor TAZ. Interestingly, RNA-binding proteins
  (RBPs) such as polyadenylation-element-binding protein 4 (CPEB4), human antigen
  R (HuR), and tristetraprolin (TTP) have been described as key regulators of these
  metabolic rewiring in HSCs. Once the liver damage is relieved, the activated HSCs
  could become inactivated, dead, or senescent followed by their elimination via the
  immune system. The figure created with BioRender.com.
