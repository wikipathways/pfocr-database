caption: The simultaneous inhibition of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in PCa will leave no dimerization
  partner for ErbB3 and halt its oncogenic signaling. The only possible ErbB dimers
  in PCa are EGFR homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2, ErbB2-ErbB3, and ErbB1-ErbB3 heterodimers
  (see text). All these dimers would stimulate cell survival, for example, though
  the PI3K/Akt pathway (shown) as well as by other pathways (not shown). ErbB1 inhibitors
  would disrupt ErbB homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 and ErbB1-ErbB3 homodimers, but signaling
  would still continue through the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers. Similarly, ErbB2 inhibitors
  would prevent signaling downstream of ErbB1-ErbB2 and ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers but
  allow signaling downstream of EGFR homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB3 heterodimers. However,
  dual inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB2 would inhibit all 4 dimers, thereby eliminating
  cell survival downstream of the ErbB receptors.
