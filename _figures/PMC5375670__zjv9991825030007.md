caption: Model of the Wnt-IFN signaling intersection. Innate activation by viral infection
  or dsRNA treatment (via Toll-like or RIG-I-like receptors) induces TBK1 phosphorylation
  (a), subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation/homodimerization (b), and translocation into
  the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of type I IFNs and interferon-stimulated
  genes (c). Simultaneous activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by viral infection
  (d) culminates in the repression of GSK3b phosphorylation (e), which feeds back
  positively into the IFN signaling pathway through interactions with TBK1 (f). The
  intersection between these two pathways suggests that the Wnt pathway can function
  to modulate the host inflammatory response as a way of controlling innate signaling.
  Inhibition of Wnt signaling by miR-34 (g) results in enhanced signaling through
  IRF3, promoting an antiviral state in the cell. IKK, IκB kinase.
