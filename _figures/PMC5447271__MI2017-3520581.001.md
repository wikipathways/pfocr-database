caption: Illustration of Wnt signaling cascades. Based on the dependence of β-catenin,
  Wnt signaling can be classified as β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling pathway (canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway) and β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling pathway (noncanonical
  Wnt signaling pathway). In canonical Wnt signaling pathway, in the absence of Wnt
  ligand(s), cytoplasmic β-catenin is targeted for phosphorylation by a multiprotein
  complex comprised of Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β), and casein kinase 1α (CK1α). The phosphorylated form of β-catenin is
  recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (β-TrCP) and then targeted for proteosomal
  degradation, resulting in low cytosolic levels (left panel); in the presence of
  Wnt ligand(s), Wnt ligand binds to a FZD and LRP coreceptors, which triggers a signaling
  cascade by activating Dvl. The activated Dvl inhibits GSK3β, which destroys the
  stability of the multiprotein complex and accordingly leads to the intracellular
  accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin. The stable and active β-catenin then translocates
  into the nucleus, in which it acts as a transcriptional coactivator with TCF/LEF
  to activate Wnt-responsive target genes (left panel). In a noncanonical Wnt signaling
  pathway, Wnt ligand (such as the Wnt5a, a typical noncanonical Wnt) binds to its
  receptor (FZD) and coreceptor (Ror1/2) and triggers noncanonical signaling cascades,
  which include the Wnt/calcium (Ca2+) and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways.
  In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway (left panel), Wnt protein binds to FZD and Ror2 receptor
  and leads to activated G proteins, resulting in enhanced intracellular calcium level
  or decreased cGMP; the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or
  protein kinase C (PKC) was then activated. In the Wnt/PCP pathway (right panel),
  the Wnt ligand binds to a FZD receptor on the cell surface, followed by activating
  Rho/Rac small GTPase and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to assist with cytoskeletal
  organization and gene expression (right panel).
