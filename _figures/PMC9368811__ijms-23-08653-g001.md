caption: 'Classical pathway: miRNA synthesis. (1) miRNA is mostly transcribed by RNA
  polymerase II through genomic regions. (2) pri-miRNA, a hairpin sequence, is then
  processed by DROSHA and DGCR8 proteins, which results in pre-miRNA. (3) pre-miRNA
  is transported to the cytoplasm through Exportin 5. (4) In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA
  is processed by Dicer, which removes the terminal loop generating a 19-25nt miRNA.
  (5) miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-inducing silencing complex (RISC) with Argonaute
  (AGO) protein that retains one of the strands, the mature miRNA, while the other
  strand is degraded. (6) Mature miRNA associated with AGO and RISC binds its seed
  sequence in the target miRNA response element (MRE) in the mRNA. After binding,
  mRNA translation might be inhibited by two main mechanisms. (7) RISC represses translation
  or (8) RISC leads to mRNA degradation.'
