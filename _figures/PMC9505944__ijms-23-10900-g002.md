caption: LPS–TLR4 signaling cascades in nucleated cells. LPS-binding protein (LBP)
  binds to LPS, inducing the exposure of the lipid A moiety and acting as a lipid-transfer
  protein. LBP drives the interaction of LPS with CD14, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored
  glycoprotein. CD14 acts as a monocyte membrane coreceptor, but it can be released
  as a soluble protein. The interaction with CD14 allows the transfer of LPS to myeloid
  differentiation factor 2 (MD-2), a protein that interacts and cooperates with TLR4,
  activating the signal transduction. MyD88-dependent pathway involves MyD88, TIRAP,
  IRAK4, and IRAK 1/2, constituting the Myddosome. It activates TRAF6, which in turn
  activates two transcription factors (AP-1 and NF-κB) that allow the expression of
  proinflammatory cytokines. MyD88-independent pathway does not involve MyD88, but
  activates TRAF3, which in turn activates IRF3, another transcription factor, involved
  in type I interferon expression [,,,].
