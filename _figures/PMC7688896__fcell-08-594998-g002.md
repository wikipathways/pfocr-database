caption: Signaling pathways that regulate ADF/cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  during LTP and LTD. During LTP, activation of NMDA receptors causes calcium influx
  into dendritic spines. The increased intracellular calcium activates CaMKII which
  in turn activates small Rho GTPases, including Rac, Cdc42 and RhoA. These small
  GTPases bind to and activate PAKs and ROCKs that can directly phosphorylate and
  activate LIMK1. LIMK1 can also be activated following the activation of neuroligin
  1 receptors during LTP through SPAR-Rac signaling pathway. Activated LIMK1 phosphorylates
  and inactivates cofilin resulting in the enlargement of dendritic spines. In addition,
  the LTP-induced calcium influx diminishes local translation of cofilin mRNA in dendrites
  through a FRMP 1-dependent manner. Translocation of cofilin into spines during LTP
  occurs through yet to be discovered mechanisms. During LTD, the activation of NMDA
  receptors and influx of calcium activates CIN which activates SSH through the PI3K-dependent
  pathway. Activated SSH dephosphorylates and activates cofilin which results in dendritic
  spine shrinkage. In addition, LTD-induced calcium influx mediates translocation
  of cofilin into spines in a β-arrestin 2-dependent manner. During mGLuR-LTD, GluA2
  interaction with cadherin/β-catenin activates Rac-PAK which then activate SSH. Additionally,
  SSH can also dephosphorylate and inactivate LIMK1.
