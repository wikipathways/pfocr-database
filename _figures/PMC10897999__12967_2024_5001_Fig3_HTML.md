caption: CircRNAs work as translational templates to contribute to the proliferation
  and progression of GC. A. CircCOL6A3_030 encodes a 198-amino-acid peptide that promotes
  the metastasis of GC through currently unknown mechanisms. B. CircAXIN1 produces
  a 295-amino-acid peptide that interacts with APC to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  ultimately promoting the proliferation of GC. C. CircGSPT1 gets translated into
  a 283-amino-acids-long peptide that interacts with the vimentin/beclin1/14-3-3 complex,
  inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and suppressing the proliferation
  and metastasis of GC. D. Hsa_circ_0004872 (circMAPK1) encodes a 109-amino-acid peptide
  that interacts with MEK1 to inhibit MAPK1 expression, thereby inhibiting the proliferation
  and metastasis of GC. E. A 529-amino-acid peptide is translated from circDIDO1,
  which interacts with PARP1 and decrease PARP1 activity. Moreover, circDIDO1 bind
  to both RBX1 and PRDX2 to promote the degradation of PRDX2. This process finally
  inhibits the proliferation and metastasis and promotes the apoptosis of GC. F. Hsa_circ_0069982
  (circMTHFD2L) encodes a 248-amino-acid peptide that disrupts the interaction between
  SET and PP2A, which attenuates the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and P65 and thus,
  inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of GC
