caption: During chewing of raw broccoli sprouts, plant myrosinase converts glucoraphanin
  (GRP) to sulforaphane (SFN) in the mouth. In the gut lumen, GRP is further converted
  to either SFN or sulforaphane-nitrile (SFN-NIT) by the gut microbiome. It is unclear
  if microbes conjugate SFN to glutathione (GSH), however, only free SFN is taken
  up into enterocytes. Within the enterocyte, SFN-GSH is either excreted back into
  the gut lumen or enters circulation where it is exists as SFN-GSH or in its free
  form which conjugates with blood proteins. SFN is transported to either tissues
  where it exerts its bioactivity or to the liver where it is metabolized via the
  mercapturic acid pathway. Mercapturic acid metabolites, SFN-cysteine (SFN-Cys) and
  SFN-N-Acetyl-Cysteine (SFN-NAC), from the liver are either exported to the bile
  for excretion to the feces, or back into the blood to go to tissues. SFN also goes
  to the kidney where it is converted to SFN-NAC and excreted into the urine. Un-hydrolyzed
  GRP is either excreted into the feces or absorbed where it is either transported
  to the kidneys to be excreted in urine or to the liver where it is excreted into
  bile. GRP that undergoes enterohepatic circulation and is either hydrolyzed in the
  gut or excreted to the feces. SFN-NIT is absorbed from the gut lumen where it is
  transported to kidneys for excretion into urine. SFN-NIT metabolism in humans needs
  further investigation.
