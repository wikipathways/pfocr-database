caption: Schematic representation of the Notch signaling pathway. The inactive monopeptide
  precursor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi
  where it is cleaved by furin converting enzyme (S1 cleavage) and transported to
  the cell membrane, where it binds to the ligand, where it is cleaved a second time
  by a member of the ADAM family (S2) to form the membrane-bound Notch Exhaustive
  Notch Transcript (NEXT), which is further processed by the precursor-independent
  γ-secretase complex at two sites (S3 and S4) to generate the active form of the
  Notch receptor. This fragment is further processed by the precursor-independent
  γ-secretase complex at two sites (S3 and S4) to generate the Notch intracellular
  structural domain (NICD), the active form of the Notch receptor, which enters the
  nucleus and exerts its transcriptional activity in the transcriptional regulation
  of downstream target genes. Ubiquitylation of the NICD leads to its proteasomal
  degradation. In addition, mature Notch receptors can return to the cytoplasm via
  endocytosis, activate introns by interacting with certain proteins lacking the DSL
  structural domain, and directly participate in other signaling pathways
