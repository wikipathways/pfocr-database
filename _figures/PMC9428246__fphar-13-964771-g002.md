caption: Propofol regulation in macrophage phagocytosis, pyroptosis and production
  of inflammatory cytokines. High-dose propofol activates pro-caspase-1 via NLRP3
  and AIM2 inflammasomes via the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Propofol-induced mitochondrial
  ROS may trigger the activation of NLRP3. The clinical dose of propofol inhibits
  pyroptosis by activating STRT1. Propofol inhibits pressure effects on macrophage
  phagocytosis by activating the GABAA receptor and inhibiting p130cas. Propofol reduces
  microglial production of MFG-E8 and inhibits cellular phagocytosis using the MFG-E8-dependent
  SRC-AMPK pathway. Propofol inhibits the ROS-mediated AKT and NF-κB pathways. Propofol
  also inhibits MAPK/ERK, the upstream regulator of NF-κB. Dissociated NK-κB is transferred
  to the cytoplasm and further induces the release of HMGB1, which inhibits the production
  of pro-inflammatory factors. Propofol inhibits the release of inflammatory factors
  via apoM in an HNF-α- and Fox2-dependent manner. Through the expression of lncRNA
  LOC286367, the expression of ABCA1 inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory factors,
  and the inhibitory effect of propofol on LPS-activated TLR4 may be related to its
  down-regulation of miR-155 expression. Propofol also inhibits the expression of
  HIF-1α and GLUT1, which results in a decrease in ATP cytosolic accumulation and
  lactic acid accumulation. By regulating these signaling pathways and related molecules,
  propofol may play an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory
  factors.
