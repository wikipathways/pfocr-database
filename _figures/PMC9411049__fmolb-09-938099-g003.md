caption: The role of ER chaperones in proteostasis. The ER-localised chaperones have
  numerous roles in this cellular organelle. (A) ER chaperones enable the translocation
  of proteins into the ER. Newly synthesized proteins are targeted by the signal recognition
  particle (SRP) as they emerge from the ribosomes. The SRP-bound protein enters the
  ER through the Sec61 translocon protein channel and is bound by Hsp70 (Grp78/BiP)
  inside the ER lumen for active import. (B) Chaperones also facilitate post-translational
  ER membrane insertion of proteins. (C) The CNX/CRT chaperone system facilitates
  proper glycosylation of proteins targeted for various cellular compartments. (D)
  ER chaperones are involved in processing the exit of the proteins via the ERGIC
  pathway. (E) Proteins that are not properly folded are bound by ERdj5, BiP, and
  Grp94 in the ER and channelled for degradation by autophagy or through the ERAD
  pathway in the cytosol.
