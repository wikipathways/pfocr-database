caption: MKI treatment induced hypertension. Inhibition of VEFGR causes hypertension,
  as VEGFR receptors are present on both healthy vascular endothelial cells and in
  cancer cells, causing the MKI treatment to also affect healthy endothelial cells
  [] (adapted from [,]). NO production is inhibited, and the endothelin-1 pathway
  is activated leading to vasoconstriction. VEGF is important for the integrity of
  the capillary network and inhibition of the VEGFR leads to reduction in capillary
  density []. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), VEGFR (vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase), eNOS (endothelial
  nitric oxide), sGC (soluble guanylate cyclase), cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate),
