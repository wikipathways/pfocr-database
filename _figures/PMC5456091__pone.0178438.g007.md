caption: An enzyme responsible for conversion from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, Pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1; GSMUA_Achr5P25000_001_MUSAC) was present 3.7-fold lower
  in abundance in inoculated samples. Aconitate (EC 4.2.1.3; GSMUA_Achr11P01170_001_MUSAC)
  and succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.5.1; GSMUA_Achr6P31640_001_MUSAC and ITC1587_Bchr7_P18621_MUSBA)
  too, was present in lower abundance level in inoculated samples. Two types (EC 1.1.1.41
  and EC 1.1.1.42) of isocitrate dehydrogenase (GSMUA_Achr1P05110_001_MUSAC) were
  detected only in inoculated samples (marked with black stars). Enzymes present in
  lower abundance levels in inoculated samples were marked with black arrows pointing
  downward.
