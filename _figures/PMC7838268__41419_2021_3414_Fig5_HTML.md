caption: a In untreated HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2 and its signaling effectors,
  supported by the Hsp90 chaperone, promote the survival of cancer cells. b In the
  HER2-positive breast cancer cells sensitive to Ganetespib, Ganetespib blocks the
  oncogenic HER2 signaling pathway at multiple levels leading to tumor regression/stagnation.
  Ganetespib also stimulates the HSF1 transcription factor to activate inducible HSPs,
  e.g., Hsp27. c In the HER2-positive breast cancer cells resistant to Ganetespib,
  the upregulated HSPs, in particular Hsp90B, Hsc70 and Hsp27, stabilize multiple
  compensatory RTKs and their effector Akt/phospho-Akt, leading to tumor survival
  and growth. Therefore, Akt represents a central actionable node downstream of the
  HSP/p-RTK resistance program and a therapeutic vulnerability.
