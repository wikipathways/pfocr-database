caption: Proposed model for the events occurring downstream of the FUL-AP2 pathway
  in the control of meristem arrest at the end of the reproductive phase. We previously
  reported that meristem arrest at the end of flowering in Arabidopsis associates
  with the indirect repression of WUS expression in the SAM by AP2 (). AP2 could mediate
  the meristem arrest through the repression of HB21 and KMD genes as well as genes
  involved in the perception and response to light (PHYA, PAR1, PAR2, and HFR1) and
  cold (CBF3). During inflorescence development, AP2 allows high CK response and low
  ABA levels that promote meristem activity, while at the end of flowering, the low
  levels of AP2 allow the rise of KMD genes and HB21, which reduce the CK response
  and increase that of ABA, respectively, promoting meristem arrest. In a second level,
  AP2 could also repress the response to light (far-red) and cold. The reduction of
  AP2 levels at the end of flowering would allow the SAM to respond to changes in
  key environmental signals, such as daylength or low temperatures, to induce arrest.
  Gray gene names indicate low expression levels.
