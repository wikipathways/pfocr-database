caption: PARPi resistance mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms of resistance against PARPi
  have been identified. (1) Restoration of HRR by BRCA reversion mutations which re-establish
  the ORF of BRCA is the most commonly observed mechanism of PARPi resistance. BRCA
  (BReast CAncer gene) reversion mutations restore the open reading frame of BRCA1/2
  and can be identified in circulating cfDNA. (2) Rewiring of the DNA damage response
  network via 53BP1 loss or replication fork stabilization can cause reactivation
  of the HRR pathway. It has been shown that loss of 53BP1-RIF1-REV7-Shieldin signaling,
  which is involved in NHEJ, in BRCA1-deficient cells reactivates resection, rescues
  HRR activity, and thereby causes PARPi resistance. Mutations in TMEJ-specific signals
  are often present in BRCA-mutated, PARPi-resistant cells.53BP1 loss and a depletion
  of the TMEJ gene POLQ display synthetic lethality with each other and have shown
  to enhance sensitivity of HRR-deficient cells to PARPi. (3) Additionally, drug-specific
  mechanisms such as downregulation of PARP1 expression and increased parylation as
  well as (4) overexpression of the drug transporter and thereby insufficient accumulation
  of the PARPi can restore BRCA signaling. DDR, DNA damage response; HRR, homologous
  recombination repair; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; PARPi, poly (ADP-ribose)
  polymerase inhibition; TMEJ, theta-mediated end joining.
