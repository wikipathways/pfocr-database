caption: 'Schematic representation of the components of growth and neurotrophic factors
  signaling pathway.Most of them exert their trophic effects through tyrosine kinases
  receptors classical activation. The FGFR (βFGF), PDGFR (PDGF), TRKA (NGF), TRKB
  (BDNF), and EGFR (EGF) dimerization triggers many intracellular signaling pathways,
  including the Ras-MAPK, the PI3K, AKT/mTOR, and PLCγ-dependent pathway. However,
  GFRα1 and CNTFRα1, which bind to GDNF and CNTF respectively, need to form a complex
  multisub unit receptors system to signal. GDNF can be signaled by GDNF-GFRα1-RET
  signaling complex (canonical way), or by GDNF-GFRα1-NCAM complex (alternative pathway)
  and activate AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathway. CNTF can signal by a heterotrimeric receptor
  (CNTFRα-gp130-LIFRβ) activating JAK/STATs pathway and other signaling ways. TRKs
  activation by these factors can promote neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity,
  neurite outgrowth, axon growth, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation. AKT:

  factor; CNTFRα1: ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor α1; EGF: epidermal growth
