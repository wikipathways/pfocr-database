caption: (a) Cdk5 is active during the dark portion of the day. Active Cdk5 with its
  co-activator p35 phosphorylates PER2, which leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation
  of this protein that is abundant at zeitgeber time (ZT) 12. At the same time CDK5
  phosphorylates DARPP32, which inhibits the PKA signaling pathway. (b) Light perceived
  in the dark phase at ZT14 leads to detachment of p35 from Cdk5 stopping Cdk5 activity.
  DARPP32 is not phosphorylated and hence can’t inhibit PKA. PKA that is activated
  by the light signal is phosphorylated and can mediate cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) phosphorylation via T-type calcium channels (Cav3.1) and the CaMK
  pathway leading to a transcriptionally active complex on the CRE element present
  in the promoters of many light-responsive genes such as Per1, Dec1, Gem, and Sik1.
  Overall, a light pulse at ZT14 will activate CREB phosphorylation and a protein
  complex will form. This complex needs phosphorylated PER2 that has accumulated in
  the nucleus between ZT12 and ZT14 to initiate the transcription of light-responsive
  genes. Both arms are necessary to build up a transcriptionally functional complex.
  Both arms depend on the presence and activity of CDK5, which therefore gates the
  light signal at ZT14. It is very likely that the amount of PER2 protein in the nucleus
  determines at least in part the magnitude of the phase delay, which depends on the
  timing of the light signal
