caption: Schematic modeling of multiple transnitrosylation steps from Uch-L1 to Cdk5
  to Drp1 in the pathogenesis of AD. In AD, oligomerized Aβ, other misfolded proteins,
  aging, and neuroinflammation can all increase intracellular NO• levels in neurons.
  The increase in NO• occurs via extrasynaptic (e)NMDAR-mediated nNOS activation in
  neurons and iNOS activation in glia cells. Excessive elevation of NO• causes aberrant
  mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in bioenergetic compromise with consequent
  neuronal damage and synaptic loss. This loss of synapses contributes to cognitive
  decline in AD. The aberrant transnitrosylation pathway that triggers the loss of
  synapses involves transfer of NO+ from SNO-Uch-L1 to Cdk5 to Drp1. Accounting for
  the mitochondrial damage, the formation of SNO-Drp1 activates its GTPase activity
  and increases mitochondrial fragmentation. This multistep transnitrosylation cascade
  represents a non-canonical signaling pathway distinct from the known enzymatic functions
  of Uch-L1, Cdk5, and Drp1. Aβ, amyloid β; AD, Alzheimer's disease; Cdk, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor; nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide
  synthase; NO•, nitric oxide; Uch-L1, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1.
