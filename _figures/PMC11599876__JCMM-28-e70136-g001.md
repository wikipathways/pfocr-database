caption: Role of IL‐15 in muscle and bone. (1) IL‐15 enhances mitochondrial biogenesis
  in myofibers and the skeletal muscle energy supply by promoting the expression of
  PPAR δ and PGC‐1α. (2) IL‐15 acts through the JAK/STAT pathway, inhibits the lipogenic
  differentiation of FAPs, and promotes myofiber regeneration. (3) IL‐15/IL‐15Rα signalling
  regulates the differentiation of osteoblasts and mediates the generation of osteocytes,
  thereby affecting the structure of bone tissue. (4) IL‐15 and RANKL act synergistically
  through the ERK signalling pathway to promote osteoclastogenesis and affect bone
  tissue structure
