caption: Current paradigm of asthma endotypes and related therapies. (A) Eosinophilic
  asthma is depicted as the most current clinical presentation. Driven by Th2 cytokines
  (IL-5, IL-4, IL-13), eosinophils chronically infiltrate bronchi and cause bronchial
  remodeling. Many biotherapies targeting those pathways (red-circled star) have been
  developed in recent decades. (B) Non-eosinophilic asthma physiopathology is poorly
  understood. Immune cells (mostly neutrophils and Th1 lymphocytes), cytokines (IL-17A
  and related molecules) and the immune pathway (inflammasome) seem to be involved,
  though their precise role remains unclear, restraining the development therapeutic
  drug targets (orange-circled star). Bronchial smooth muscle is an important therapeutic
  non-drug target because of bronchial thermoplasty (green-circled star). Subepithelial
  inflammatory cytokines (alarmins such as IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP) are of growing
  interest in both endotypes since they are far upstream of the inflammatory cascade
  (yellow-circled star).
