caption: Novel AR axis-directed therapy for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
  Mechanism underlying androgen synthesis pathway inhibition (e.g., abiraterone and
  MK-5684) and AR-targeted mechanisms inhibit AR function by blocking (1) agonist
  binding, (2) nuclear translocation, and/or (3) DNA binding, and thus transcription
  of AR (e.g., enzalutamide, darolutamide, and rezvilutamide). Alternative therapeutic
  options include AR PROTAC degraders via a ubiquitin/E3 ligase system or AR-V7 antagonists.
  Castration resistance can develop through several AR-dependent and -independent
  processes, including AR mutations that enable non-androgenic hormonal activation.
  AR, androgen receptor
