caption: Schematic representation of Pi and Fe homeostasis interactions in plants.
  The phosphate (Pi) deficiency promotes the iron (Fe) accumulation (A); conversely,
  Fe deficiency induces the high Pi in plants at the physiological level (B). For
  the molecular bases of the Pi-Fe cross-talk, the PHR1, PHL1, PHO1;1, PHO1; H1, FER1,
  STOP1, and MPK6 act as potential integrators of Pi and Fe nutrient signals in plants.
  (A) Under Pi deficiency, the PHR1 and PHL1 function as the core transcription factors
  controlling the expression of Pi transporters PHT1 and PHO1 via the PHR1-miR399-PHO2-signaling
  pathway. Moreover, PHR1 and PHL1 act as the positive regulators of the transcription
  of Fe transporters FER1, NAS3, and YLS8 responsible for Fe homeostasis in plants.
  On the other hand, Pi deficiency also induces the STOP1-modulated signaling to promote
  Fe accumulation in roots. However, under Fe sufficiency, as a key cis-acting element
  of plant iron homeostasis, IDRS (iron-dependent regulatory sequence, which is bound
  by unknown factor X) is responsible for the upregulation of ferritin genes FER2,
  FER3, and FER4, whereas the central regulator FIT is inactivated to inhibit the
  expression of FRO2 and IRT1. (B) By contrast, Fe deficiency activates the interacting
  bHLH IVc (bHLH34/104/105/115) and bHLH121 complex to positively regulate the expression
  of bHLH Ib (bHLH38/39/100/101) and FIT. The bHLH Ib and FIT interact with each other
  to induce the expression of Fe uptake-related genes FRO2 and IRT1 as well as PHO1
  Pi transporter genes PHO1; H1, and PHO1;1 for Pi homeostasis. However, the dynamics
  in Pi also elicits the MAPK-mediated Pi sensing, signaling, and responses in plants,
  while Fe deficiency reduces the MAPK6 activity to repress the PHT1 family genes
  downstream of the WRKY75 transcription factor, indicating the role of MPK6 in the
  coordination of the responses to Pi and Fe nutrients in Pi uptake and homeostasis.
  The arrows and flat-ended lines indicate the positive and negative influences, respectively.
  The confirmed influences are presented with solid lines, whereas non-confirmed influences
  are shown with dashed lines.
