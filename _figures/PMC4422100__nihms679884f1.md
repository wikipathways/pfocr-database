caption: 'Major known oxidant/antioxidant pathways in living organisms. Many pathologic
  processes including inflammation, ischemia, irradiation, etc. as well as physiological
  functions such as cellular respiration can trigger or increase superoxide radical
  (O2•−) production. The antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) facilitates
  the dismutation reaction of O2•− to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 can be reduced
  to water (H2O) via different ways: the glutathione cycle in which the reduced form
  of glutathione (GSH) was oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and then will
  again be reduced to GSH plays the major role; mainly glutathione peroxidase (GPX)
  glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), but also glutathione
  synthethase (GS), glutaredoxin (GRX) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) are involved
  in this system. Catalase (CAT), thioredoxin (TRX) and peroxiredoxin (PRX) are also
  fighting against H2O2 overproduction; heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and several metal
  chelators are other important members of the endogenous redox state regulatory systems.
  If free Fe3+ or Cu2+ are present around H2O2, another possible - but unwanted -
  pathway is the production of the hydroxyl radical (•OH), one of the most reactive
  species known, via the Fenton and following Haber-Weiss reactions; •OH have the
  ability to oxidize almost all biomolecules. Another unwanted pathway is, in the
  presence of excessive amounts of nitric oxide (NO•) produced mainly by the inducible
  isotype of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the outcompeting of SOD for its substrate
  O2•−. In this case the reaction of NO• with O2•− will produce peroxynitrite (ONOO−),
  a highly reactive molecule; S-nitrothiols (RSNOs) such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)
  can be produced in following steps. On the other hand, the radical or non-radical
  reactive species can trigger the activation of ‘redox sensitive transcription factors’
  such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) or activator protein-1 (AP-1) which can mediate
  both a lot of physiological functions or inflammatory responses via several cytokines.
  Particularly in chronic pathologies, the re-activation of reactive molecules can
  lead to a vicious circle. Please note that ‘antioxidants’ cover a large broad of
  molecules and they can act in much more steps of redox reactions than simply shown
  in the figure; e.g. inhibiting ROS generating enzymes, supporting the production
  of endogenous defense molecules, scavenging free radicals. [Other abbreviations:
