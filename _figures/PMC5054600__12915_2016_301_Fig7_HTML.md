caption: Working model of lifespan extension induced by impt-1 knockdown in C. elegans.
  IMPACT acts as an inhibitor of GCN-2. Impt-1 knockdown activates the GCN-2 branch
  of the ISR, increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α and induces ATF-5 expression.
  This pathway is further stimulated by an increase in uncharged tRNAs exerted by
  dietary restriction. In early larval stages, ATF-5 induces SKN-1 or acts in concert
  with it to activate a stress response program that leads to DAF-16 induction in
  adults and confers lifespan extension. Impt-1 also interacts with hsf-1 during larval
  stages and with aak-2 and let-363 during adulthood to control lifespan
