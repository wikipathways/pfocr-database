caption: 'Chemical structure and therapeutic mechanisms of statins. A. A list of statin
  family members has a molecular structure similar to HMG-CoA. B. Statins inhibit
  the mevalonate pathway by competitively suppressing the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR
  for cholesterol synthesis, thereby reducing cholesterol synthesis. In addition,
  reduced cholesterol synthesis upregulates the expression of LDL receptors, promoting
  the absorption of LDL in the liver. Inhibiting the mevalonate pathway can reduce
  protein isoprenylation, affecting various physiological activities. Unleashing the
  potential of statins: unraveling the intricacies of pleiotropy'
