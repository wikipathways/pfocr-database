caption: The molecular interactions of ZIKV and DENV with the type-I IFN pathway.
  Once produced and secreted from infected cells type-I IFNs bind to their cognate
  cell surface receptor, activating janus kinase-signal transducer and activator (JAK-STAT)
  signaling (black arrows). This leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2,
  their heterodimerzation and subsequent complexing with IRF9 to form the complex
  ISGF3. ISGF3 then transcriptionally upregulates interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)
  that have antiviral effects against ZIKV and DENV. Several stages of the IFN pathway
  are inhibited by ZIKV and DENV mediated evasion mechanisms (red).
