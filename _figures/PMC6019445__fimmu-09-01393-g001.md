caption: Schematic describing invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell development and
  function in the thymus. Thymus-settling progenitors emigrate from the bone marrow
  and then mature into early thymic progenitors and progressively commit to the T
  cell lineage by maturing from the double negative 2 cell stage to DN3, DN4, and
  eventually to the double-positive (DP) cell stage. Here, they begin to rearrange
  their TCRα loci and can then be selected by MHC-I- and MHC-II-expressing cortical
  thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). Cells that successfully undergo positive selection
  by cTECs can become immature CD8+, CD4+, and Treg cells. By contrast, a small proportion
  of DP cells rearranges its TCRα locus to generate the iNKTα chain and is selected
  by other DP cells expressing CD1d and signaling lymphocytic activated molecules
  family receptors. Intracellular calcium levels are high in these post-selected stage
  0 cells, which leads to NFAT translocation into the nucleus and upregulation of
  Egr2 and CD69. An alternative pathway (depicted by a dashed arrow) wherein a small
  number of DN4 thymocytes rearrange their TCRα loci to generate the iNKTα chain that
  can then give rise to stage 0 iNKT cells upon positive selection has also been described.
  These cells then transition through an uncommitted PLZFhi stage before diverging
  into the functionally distinct iNKT2, iNKT17, and iNKT1 subsets defined by the transcription
  factors GATA-3, RORγt, and T-bet, respectively. iNKT2 cells migrate from the cortex
  to the medulla where they begin to produce IL-4 at steady-state. This IL-4 production
  (as designated by red arrows) has been linked to conditioning surrounding CD8+ T
  cells to become innate-memory CD8+ T cells, promoting certain dendritic cell populations
  to secrete the chemokines CCL17 and CCL22, preventing ETP commitment to the T cell
  lineage and inhibiting thymic export of single positive (SP) thymocytes into peripheral
  tissues. RANKL expressed by medullary iNKT2 (and iNKT17) cells also promotes maturation
  of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) into Aire+ MHC-IIhi mTECs, which mediate
  negative selection of medullary SP thymocytes and Treg maturation.
