caption: 'Simplified scheme of the interactions among the biosynthetic pathways responsible
  for volatile and non-volatile stress metabolites in plants. Pathway names are in
  italics, volatile compound classes are in bold font inside ellipses, and the key
  enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways are next to the arrows in italics.
  Abbreviations: acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; AOS, allene oxide synthase; DAHP,
  3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; DMADP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DMNT,
  4,8-dimethyl-1,3E,7-nonatriene; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; Ery4P, erythrose
  4-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FDP, farnesyl diphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GDP, geranyl diphosphate; HPL, fatty acid hydroperoxide
  lyases; IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate; JMT, jasmonic acid carboxyl methyl transferase;
  LOX, lipoxygenase; MEP-pathway, methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway; MVA, mevalonic
  acid; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Phe, phenylalanine;
  TMTT, 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3(E),7(E),11-tridecatetraene. The lipoxygenase pathway
  starts with the dehydrogenation of linolenic and linoleic acids at C9 or C13 position
  by lipoxygenases forming 9-hydroperoxy and 13-hydroperoxy derivates of polyenic
  acids (; ). These compounds are further cleaved by hydroperoxide lyases into oxoacids
  and C6-aldehydes. These aldehydes can be converted into the corresponding alcohols
  by alcohol dehydrogenases (; ; ). Terpenoids originate from isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IDP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMDP), which are synthesized via two different
  pathways. The cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway starts with the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA
  (), while the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP pathway) starts with condensation of pyruvate and
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (; ). The route in plastids provides precursors for the
  biosynthesis of isoprene, mono-, and diterpenes, while the cytosol-localized pathway
  for sesqui- and triterpenes. Precursors of terpenes have been experimentally demonstrated
  to be transported from plastids to the cytosol (; ), referred to as the “cross-talk”
  between the MEP- and MVA-pathways (for recent reviews on terpenoid synthesis see
  ; ; ). Aromatic volatiles are formed via the shikimic acid pathway, starting by
  condensation of erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP. After numerous steps via 3-dehydroshikimic
  acid and chorismate, phenylalanine (Phe) is produced. Phe is further converted to
  trans-cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Trans-cinnamic acid is a starting
  point for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids, (e.g., phenylethanol, phenylethylbenzoate)
  and benzenoids (benzaldehyde, methyl benzoate, methyl salicylate etc.; ; ). Additionally,
  tryptophan (Trp), which is the precursor of volatile indole, is biosynthesized via
  shikimic acid pathway () in chloroplast, while indole itself is synthesized in cytosol
  ().'
