caption: Metabolic alterations in hematological malignancies. Metabolic alterations
  in hematological malignancies are mainly reflected in the increase in glucose and
  glutamine uptake and fatty acid metabolism to promote the rapid synthesis of nucleotides,
  proteins, and lipids. Different metabolic pathways are marked with distinct colors.

  malignancies are labeled. Some special enzymes or reaction processes in the metabolic
  process, which can be used as potential therapeutic targets, are marked with an
  asterisk. The yellow capsules represent the drugs in clinical trials, whereas the
