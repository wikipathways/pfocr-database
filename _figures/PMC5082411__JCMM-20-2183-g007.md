caption: Proposed mechanism of TGF‐β1‐induced fibrogenesis. CTGF, acts as an important
  downstream effector of TGF‐β1/PI3K signalling pathway, linking TGF‐β1 with ECM production
  during pulmonary fibrosis. The signal pathway of TGF‐β1/PI3K/CTGF plays an important
  role in the fibrogenesis of human alveolar epithelial cells, which may be a novel
  therapeutic approach to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis.
