caption: IL-1 signaling leads to actin stress fiber formation. The IL-1 signaling
  complex (green symbols) is assembled when IL-1 binds to its receptor IL-1RI. The
  heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP leads to the recruitment
  of MyD88 and IRAKs (see text). Subsequently, IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1, which in
  turn phosphorylates Pellino-1, an E3-ligase that causes poly-ubiquitination (Uq,
  yellow symbols) of IRAK1. Traf6 is also polyubiquitinated as a result of IRAK2 activity.
  These events lead to the activation of the NF-κB pathway (purple symbols) by providing
  a platform for the recruitment of TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1, a MAPK kinase
  kinase) and the IKK complex. TAK1 activates IKK2, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα,
  thereby freeing NF-κB. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB leads to the transcriptional
  regulation of multiple genes (e.g., increased MLCK expression, see text). MLCK phosphorylates
  myosin light chain (MLC), thereby promoting actomyosin contraction (pink symbols).
  Other than the NF-kB pathway, IL-1 signaling also activates the Rho-ROCK pathway
  (blue symbols, see text). Phosphorylation of ROCK and LIM kinase (LIMK) leads to
  the phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin, thereby promoting actin stabilization.
  Additionally, ROCK inhibits MLC phosphatase and thus promotes actomyosin contraction.
  As such, IL-1 signaling leads to the remodeling of actin filaments associated with
  intercellular junctions (dark purple symbols) or focal adhesion complexes (orange
  symbols)
