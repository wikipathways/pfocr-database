caption: 'Proposed mechanism of DCLF/cytokine-induced cytotoxic synergy. DCLF treatment
  causes early activation of the ER stress response pathway (). ER stress results
  in release of Ca++ from the ER via IP3 receptors, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic
  free Ca++ (). Ca++ released from the ER during ER stress can participate in a feedback
  amplification loop, leading to persistent ER stress, which is known to be associated
  with apoptosis (). Consistent with its induction of the ER stress pathway, DCLF
  treatment caused an increase in intracellular Ca++. Although not shown in the diagram,
  TNF/IFN treatment caused a delayed enhancement of the DCLF-mediated increase in
  intracellular Ca++. The increase in intracellular free Ca++ contributes to the cytotoxic
  DCLF/cytokine interaction not only by contributing to persistent ER stress but also
  by activating JNK and ERK. TNF treatment causes modest, early activation of JNK
  that is transient in the absence of DCLF but persistent in its presence (). Persistent
  activation of JNK is essential for DCLF/TNF-induced apoptosis presumably by contributing
  to mitochondrial permeability transition (; ).DCLF-induced activation of JNK contributes
  to activation of ERK which plays a role in the IFN-mediated enhancement of DCLF/TNF-induced
  cytotoxicity (). IFN alone leads to phosphorylation of STAT-1 at Tyr 701 which allows
  translocation of STAT-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Translocation allows
  STAT-1 to be phosphorylated at Ser 727 (), leading to full activation. In our model,
  dual phosphorylation of STAT-1 occurs through exposure to IFN only in the presence
  of DCLF and is mediated through ERK which is activated in response to DCLF. Full
  STAT-1 activation enhances apoptosis caused by the interaction of DCLF and TNF.
