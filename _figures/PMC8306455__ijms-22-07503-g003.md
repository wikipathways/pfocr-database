caption: Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) Signaling and Inhibition. The TLR signaling pathway
  begins after a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) binds to the TLR. There
  are two main signaling pathways activated by TLRs. TLR activation through MyD88
  results in the formation of a myddosome, which includes MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2, and
  IRAK4. The myddosome then activates TRAF6, which activates TAK1. TAK1 phosphorylates
  the IKK complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκB. IκB phosphorylation triggers
  its proteasomal degradation and the subsequent release of the transcription factor
  NF-κB. The second pathway involves TRIF associating with the TLR. TRIF activates
  TRAF3, which activates TBK1 and IKKi. These phosphorylate IRF3. As in the STING
  pathway, IRF3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to induce an interferon
  response. The HCMV protein US7 inhibits signaling by targeting TLR3 and TLR4 for
  proteasomal degradation, while the HCMV protein US8 inhibits signaling by destabilizing
  TLR3 and TLR4. Of note, HHV-6A and HHV-6B have been shown to downregulate TLR9 protein
  levels.
