caption: Both in vitro and in vivo, CEACAM1 induces mitochondrial translocation of
  Bax and mitochondria dysfunction with consequent activation of the cytochrome C-caspase-3
  apoptotic signaling pathway, which promotes hypoxia-induced apoptosis and of post-infarction
  cardiac remodeling. In addition, CEACAM1 promotes hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis through GRP78 and CHOP pathway.
