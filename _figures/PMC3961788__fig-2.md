caption: Cross-talk of heme degradation pathway and cell metabolism. The heme degradation
  pathway is the only catalytic process that enables removal of toxic heme in cells
  and tissues. Heme is a part of hemoproteins and regulates its own synthesis. Generation
  of carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin/bilirubin (BV/BR), and iron influences several
  cellular processes, including glucose lipid and nucleotide metabolism.
