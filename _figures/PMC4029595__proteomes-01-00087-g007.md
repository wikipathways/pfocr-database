caption: Proposed breast cancer signaling pathway based on the KEGG network pathway
  analysis of hypoxia-activated tumor cell migration. In EGF-stimulated SKBR3 cells
  with decreased VPS4B expression, the assembly of F-actin and the formation of filopodia
  were promoted, suggesting that the dysfunction of the MVB pathway stimulates the
  migration of tumor cells under hypoxic conditions.
