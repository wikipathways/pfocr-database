caption: Signaling pathways that can cross talk with TNT formation. The Akt-dependent
  TNT formation pathway cross talks with signaling complexes from the lysosome and
  the mitochondria. Increased oxidative stress, through increased ROS formation from
  aggregates within the cytosol or from lysosomal aggregation of protein, can cause
  mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal dysfunction, which act in a feedback loop
  to create increased ROS. Increased localized ROS is believed to be responsible for
  TNT formation () through the Akt pathway. Lysosomal stress can also alter TFEB signaling,
  which is directly responsible for increasing lysosomal exocytosis (). Direct interaction
  between α-synuclein and TFEB has been demonstrated (), and thus, cytosolic aggregates
  may influence TFEB signaling in a way that affects its intercellular transfer.
