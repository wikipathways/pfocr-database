caption: TA biosynthetic pathway from the C4/C5 cleavage of Asc. The carbon atoms
  in each molecule were indexed according to the numbering in Asc. VvL-IdnDH catalyzing
  the conversion of l-idonic acid to 5-keto-d-gluconic acid was characterized previously
  by DeBolt et al. (). Vv2KGR responsible for the conversion of 2-keto-l-gulonic acid
  to l-idonic acid was identified in the present study.
