caption: Model representing Vip3A proteins-insecticidal mechanism through pore formation
  and apoptosis. (A) The ∼62–66 kDa fragments along with ∼19–22 kDa fragment can bind
  with receptors leading to pore formation and cell death. (B) This represents that
  Vip3A-protoxin can bind to all three specific receptors in the target insect. Thereafter,
  enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and induced activation of caspases,
  DNA damage, and lysosome-induced disruption of the mitochondrial membrane which
  leads to apoptosis process in Sf9 cells and ultimately insect mortality. However,
  the responsible signaling pathway is still undefined.
