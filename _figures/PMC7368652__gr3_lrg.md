caption: The role of phosphorylated GSK3β on polycystin-1/2 mutation of polycystic
  kidney disease. MIF stimulates cyst initiation and expansion via p-ERK/mTOR mediated
  cell proliferation pathway. GSK3β inhibitor (TDZD-8) or berberine may decrease renal
  cell proliferation and cyst expansion via p-ERK/p70-S6/c-Myc/Cyclin-D1/β-catenin
  modulation. From the macrophage aspect, high level of MIF in cyst modulate PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/MCP-1
  axis and promotes renal tubule cell proliferation and cyst expansion. Phosphorylated
  GSK3β (inactive form) results in MCP-1 production and β-catenin activation during
  the process of vascular remodeling and aneurysm. M1/M2 macrophages participates
  in different stages of aneurysm development. Long-term lithium treatment may influence
  podocyte cell cycle and renal function by GSK3β suppression (phosphorylated form).
  GSK3β degradation by microRNA-92a triggers podocyte re-entry cell cycle and renal
  failure via Ajuba and YAP/TAZ signal pathway.
