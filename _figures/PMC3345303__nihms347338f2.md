caption: During strong postysnaptic depolarization, which is mediated by AMPA receptors
  (AMPA-R), calcium (Ca2+) entry through NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) and voltage-gated
  calcium channels (VGCC) initiates synaptic plasticity. Calcium-dependent protein
  kinases (e.g. protein kinase A, protein kinase C and protein kinase M ζ, and Ca2+/calmodulin
  protein kinase II) regulate the trafficking of AMPA-Rs into the synapse as well
  as the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, which can directly interact with transcription
  factors, such as CREB, within the nucleus. Calcium ions can also travel directly
  to the nucleus and interact with Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IV, also leading to the
  activation of CREB. Gene transcription within the nucleus results in a plethora
  of newly synthesized proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
  activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and c-fos. Importantly,
  BDNF regulates the ERK/MAPK pathway (), in addition to activating mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR; ). mTOR activation results in the insertion of AMPA-R subunits
  into the membrane as well as the regulation of protein synthesis. In addition, BDNF
  is secreted from the neuron and binds to TrkB receptors, which are thought to be
  important for the late phase of long-term potentiation (; ). Arc protein, in contrast,
  interacts with actin filaments of the cytoskeleton; this interaction has been shown
  to be crucial for changes in structural plasticity, such as dendritic spine enlargement
  in neurons ().
