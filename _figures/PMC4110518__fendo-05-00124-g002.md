caption: 'Signaling pathways in follicular cells are shown. The main regulators of
  thyroid proliferation and function act through TSH signaling and GF pathway. THs
  control the secretion of TSH, which binds to TSH-R and induces the coupling of G-proteins
  stimulating AC and PLC. TSH also acts via PI3K pathway. GFs act via MAPK and PI3K
  pathways regulating the expression of genes involved in survival, cell cycle progression,
  and proliferation. Estrogens regulate proliferation, cell motility, differentiation,
  and apoptosis through four different mechanisms: (1) genomic (or classical) estrogen-signaling:
  E2–ER complex translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to ERE-sequences; (2)
  ERE-independent genomic actions (TFs cross-talk): genes lacking in ERE-sequences
  are activated by other TFs in the nucleus through protein–protein interactions;
  (3) non-genomic (or membrane-initiated) estrogen-signaling: E2 activation of plasma
  membrane-associated ER and GPR30 trigger the activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways
  and/or increases the Ca2+ levels; (4) ligand-independent signaling: in absence of
  E2, GFs can stimulate ERs directly or indirectly through MAPK and/or PI3K pathways.
  THs play a critical role in development and homeostasis. Nuclear TRs activate gene
  expression by binding to RXR, which in turn bind to TRE-sequences. Given that EREs
  share a similar nucleotide sequence with TREs, ERs and TRs can interact and regulate
  several transcriptional responses. The cross-talk between genomic and non-genomic
  pathways and other integrative signaling lead to a synergic cell response.'
