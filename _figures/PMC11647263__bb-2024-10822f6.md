caption: 'In SAE, Nogo-A plays a critical role through a series of complex signaling
  pathways. Firstly, Nogo-A regulates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and MAM, leading
  to the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the ER, which in turn causes mitochondrial
  overload. This overload induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  Increased ROS levels promote the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and affect
  mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) by activating STING (stimulator of interferon
  genes) and modulating the phosphorylation status of PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) and
  SHP2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase 2). In this process, STING activation further
  triggers the phosphorylation of IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) and NF-κB
  (nuclear factor kappa B), enhancing the production of inflammatory factors such
  as interferon (IFN), IL-1β, and TNFα. The increase in these inflammatory factors
  leads to the M1 polarization of microglia, further exacerbating the neuroinflammatory
  response. In summary, Nogo-A exacerbates SAE by inhibiting SHP2 and activating ROS,
  PERK, and STING, which results in ER stress, aberrant mitochondrial autophagy, and
  intensified neuroinflammatory responses. SAE: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy;
  MAM: mitochondrial-associated membrane'
