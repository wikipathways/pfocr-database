caption: Concerted effects of iAs-induced Nrf2 and HIF1α on glycolytic metabolism.
  A. Venn diagrams showing overlapping of genes enriched with Nrf2 and HIF1α induced
  by iAs as determined by ChIP-seq. B. KEGG pathway analyses of the iAs-induced Nrf2-enriched
  genes (upper) and HIF1α-enriched genes (bottom). C. Diagram of glycolysis and the
  key enzymes at the indicated steps of glycolysis. Cyan color indicates the genes
  that are mainly enriched with Nrf2 in response to iAs; pink color indicates the
  genes that are mostly enriched with HIF1α induced by iAs; and yellow color shows
  the genes that are enriched with both Nrf2 and HIF1α in the cells treated with iAs.
  Right panels are the screenshot examples of the glycolytic genes enriched with Nrf2,
  HIF1α or both.
