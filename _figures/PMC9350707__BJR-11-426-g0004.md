caption: Involvement of T helper 2 (Th2) cells in the immune regulation of rheumatoid
  arthritis (RA). Interleukin (IL)-5 is able to differentiate and mobilize eosinophils
  from the bone marrow. IL-4 also shows an inhibitory effect on bone resorption by
  affecting the activity and survival of osteoclasts. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13
  share the same receptors, and both are capable of activating the signal transduction
  and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signalling pathway. Strong activation of
  the STAT6 signalling pathway was found in IL-4- and IL-13-induced haematopoietic
  cells, inducing a shift in macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory ‘M2-like’
  phenotype, which is responsible for the suppression of arthritis. In addition, IL-4
  and IL-13 have direct anti-inflammatory effects in the synovium of RA, where they
  reduce the production of IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by synovial macrophages,
  as well as their expression of CD16 and CD64.
