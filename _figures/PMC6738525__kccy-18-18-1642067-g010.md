caption: Schematic representation of the effect of EPCAM on hepatic fibrosis and biological
  activities of HSCs in mouse models of AH. During the process of hepatic fibrosis,
  the highly expressed EPCAM activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which
  up-regulated Bcl2 and down = regulated caspase-3, leading to inhibited apoptosis
  of HSCs.
