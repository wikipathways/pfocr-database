caption: Crosstalk of ROS with NF-κB signaling pathways. ROS interacts with NF-κB
  at various places within the signaling pathway. Many of these interactions occur
  in a cell type-specific manner. ROS has been proposed to both activate and inactivate
  the IKK complex leading to an effect on the downstream targets. Often ROS has been
  shown to activate NF-κB through alternative IκBα phosphorylation, which may or may
  not result in the degradation of IκBα. Lastly, ROS may influence the DNA binding
  properties of the NF-κB proteins themselves. Oxidation of p50 on its DNA binding
  domain has been shown to prevent its DNA binding, and must be reversed in the nucleus
  by a Trx1-dependent process involving Ref-1. On the other hand, the phosphorylation
  of RelA that is influenced by ROS-dependent processes leads to greater NF-κB activation.
