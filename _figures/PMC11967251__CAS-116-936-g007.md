caption: A mechanism graphic in this study. This study unveiled the mechanism wherein
  IGF2BP3 was overexpressed in human LUAD tissues, promoted cell migration and invasion,
  EMT, lymphangiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis by binding the m6A site of the
  3′UTR region of SRC and maintaining its stability so as to activate STAT3 signaling
  pathway and promote VEGFC expression in LUAD
