caption: When Hippo signaling is low, Yki/YAP/TAZ enter the nucleus, where they use
  their N-terminal homology (NH) domain to interact with the C-terminal domain of
  the DNA-binding transcriptional factor Sd/TEAD. The DNA-binding TEA domain of Sd/TEAD
  targets the Yki/YAP/TAZ-Sd/TEAD complex to Hippo Responsive Elements (HREs) of target
  genes, where Yki/YAP/TAZ activate target gene transcription by recruiting multiple
  transcriptional complexes, including the Trr (MLL3/4 in mammals) H3K4 methyltranferase
  complex (through direct binding of its NcoA6 subunit), the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF
  chromatin remodeling complex, and the Mediator complex. When Hippo signaling is
  high, Yki/YAP/TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm and Sd/TEAD instead interacts
  with Tgi/VGLL4 and other unknown corepressors to repress target gene transcription.
