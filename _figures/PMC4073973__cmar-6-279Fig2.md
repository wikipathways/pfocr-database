caption: BRAF inhibitor pathway. BRAF inhibitors block the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase pathway thus increasing melanocyte antigen presentation, which is recognized
  by T-lymphocytes and leads to increased antitumor response by activating transcription
  factors and increasing proliferation of lymphocytes.
