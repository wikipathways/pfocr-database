caption: The schematic drawing illustrating the action mechanisms underlying the effects
  of SF on ameliorating the cognitive impairments induced by STZ in rats. Our findings
  revealed that SF was able to suppress the activation of microglia and astrocytes
  to reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, while
  promoting the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator such as IL-10. SF also
  inhibited tau protein phosphorylation by modulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway.
  Moreover, SF ameliorated neuroinflammation stimulated by LPS in BV-2 cells through
  inhibiting the NF-κB p65 translocation to the nucleus and regulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β
  pathway. All these molecular actions of SF collectively contribute to its therapeutic
  effects on the experimental models of AD.
