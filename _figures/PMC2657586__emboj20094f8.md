caption: 'Working model of COP1 and UVR8 function in the UV-B photoregulatory pathway.
  Left panel: under white light (WL), active photoreceptors partially inhibit COP1,
  which balances the response by repressing light signalling through degradation of
  HY5, HYH and other positive regulators of photomorphogenesis. A portion of UVR8
  is constitutively associated with chromatin, for example, at the HY5 promoter region.
  A yet unidentified protein X represses HY5 transcription, possibly through keeping
  UVR8 inactive. Right panel: under supplementary UV-B (WL+UV-B), the specific perception
  by a UV-B photoreceptor (PR) results in rapid UVR8–COP1 interaction. This interaction
  is very closely linked to the UV-B PR function and confers UV-B-specific function
  to COP1, changing its substrate specificity away from HY5/HYH and functionally related
  proteins towards repressor protein X. Degradation of X then allows UVR8-mediated
  activation of genes, including HY5, that confers UV acclimation and protection.'
