caption: Schematic diagram of the Notch signaling pathway. The Notch/γ-secretase/Jagged
  signaling pathway is an important regulator of differentiation and helps specify
  cell fate. Notch signaling pathways have been shown to be activated in both breast
  CSCs and in endothelial cells in response to radiation. MK-0752 and R4733 are drugs
  under development targeting γ-secretase in this signaling pathway.
