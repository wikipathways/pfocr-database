caption: Cytokine activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway is the gateway to the
  second phase of immunologically-mediated oncogenesis. A number of cytokines, most
  notably IL-6,IL-11 and IL-22 are induced by upstream pro-inflammatory factors and
  activate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Th17 responses, possibly induced by bacteria
  in the microbiome are important initiators of IL-6 and IL-22 production. However,
  there is recent evidence that such activation is favored by the presence of particular
  non-pathogenic members of the microbiome.
