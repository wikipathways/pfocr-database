caption: A. U1 snRNA utilizes both Rnt1-dependent and Rnt-independent mechanisms to
  achieve 3′ end formation. The RNAseIII, Rnt1, cleaves at a stem loop region generating
  a substrate for 3′ to 5′ exonucleases giving rise to the mature product, which can
  also be generated through termination followed by exonucleolytic trimming. A polyadenylated
  intermediate may also be formed that may cycle back to an exonuclease substrate.
  B. U2 snRNA uses both a Rnt1-dependent and Rnt1-independent mechanism to generate
  its 3′ end. The Rnt1-dependent is similar to the U1 snRNA 3′ end pathway but the
  Rnt1-independent utilizes Polyadenylation Sequences (PASs) located downstream of
  the Rnt1 cleavage site. This generates a cleavage and polyadenylation substrate
  and ultimately poly(A)+ U2 snRNA.
