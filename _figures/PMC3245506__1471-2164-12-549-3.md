caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in transgenics at 2 months (parametric
  and nonparametric approaches). Using 21 differentially expressed genes as the focus
  gene set from the overlap of genes identified from the parametric and the nonparametric
  approaches and IPA, the highest-scoring network was Immunological Disease, Cellular
  Development, and Cellular Function and Maintenance (score = 30). Colors, arrows,
  lines and abbreviations are described under Figure 1.
