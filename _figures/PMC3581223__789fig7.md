caption: A diagram shows the existence of positive feedback between the Wnt and GLP-1/cAMP
  signaling pathways in the brainstem and hypothalamus. In the brainstem, β-cat/TCF7L2
  positively regulates gcg expression and the production of GLP-1, which inhibits
  food intake at least partially by attenuating hypothalamic AMPK activity (). GLP-1
  also stimulates brain Wnt activity via increasing β-cat Ser675 phosphorylation and,
  possibly, TCF7L2 production. In the brainstem, this leads to increased gcg expression
  (positive feedback), whereas in hypothalamic neurons this is among the anorectic
  effects of GLP-1. How the hypothalamic Wnt activation modulates peripheral glucose
  homeostasis and insulin signaling is currently unknown. (A high-quality color representation
  of this figure is available in the online issue.)
