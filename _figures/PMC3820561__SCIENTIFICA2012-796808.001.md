caption: BRCA1 domain structure and subcellular transport pathways. (a) Protein domain
  structure of BRCA1 showing the location of nuclear localization signals (NLSs),
  nuclear export signals (NESs), and binding sites for BARD1 and gamma-tubulin. The
  RING and BRCT protein interaction domains are shown at the amino and carboxy termini,
  respectively. (b) Diagram summarizing the distribution and movement of BRCA1 in
  the cell. Once translated in the cytoplasm, BRCA1 can move to the centrosome where
  it dimerizes with BARD1 to ubiquitinate proteins such as gamma-tubulin that regulate
  centrosome duplication and microtubule nucleation, or to the mitochondria where
  it is implicated in cell survival and/or apoptosis regulation. BRCA1 enters the
  nucleus through the importin-alpha/beta pathway and locates at nuclear DNA replication
  sites. In response to DNA damage, BRCA1 is sequestered (as a dimer with BARD1) to
  different types of DNA repair complexes at foci. The interaction with BARD1 tends
  to trap BRCA1 in the nucleus through the masking of its NES. If BRCA1 is not bound
  to BARD1, it is exported to the cytoplasm by the CRM1 export receptor, and this
  has been linked to the roles of BRCA1 in apoptosis and in centrosome duplication
  as revealed by functional comparison of wild-type and NES-mutated forms of BRCA1.
