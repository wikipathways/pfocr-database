caption: Summary of the metabolic changes within tumour cells arising from the Warburg
  effect. In healthy cells, glucose is taken up and converted into ATP via oxidative
  phosphorylation. In the tumour cell, mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate via the
  Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain is reduced, mediated by increased
  expression of lactate dehydrogenase A and pyruvate kinase M2 which shuttles pyruvate
  into lactate production. The loss in ATP synthesis is compensated by increased expression
  of the glucose transporter and hexokinase expression, which is induced by Akt signalling.
  The increase in hexokinase activity is supported by the diversion of mitochondrial
  ATP to hexokinase, mediated by the binding of Akt to mitochondrial porin. Intermediate
  products of glycolysis are diverted into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which
  generates the riboside 5-phosphate and NADPH arising from the increased demand for
  nucleotide synthesis and lipogenesis arising from the increasing tumour mass. Excess
  lactate is excreted from the cell, acidifying the extracellular environment, and
  thus promoting the tumour phenotype over non-tumour cells.
