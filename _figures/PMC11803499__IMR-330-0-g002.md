caption: B cell signaling is integrated downstream of activating receptors to regulated
  B cell‐specific cellular functions and B cell fate decisions. Receptor engagement
  activates B cells, triggering multiple signaling pathways such as the canonical
  (NF‐κB1) and non‐canonical (NF‐κB2) NF‐κB pathways, along with MAP kinase pathways,
  which support gene expression and cell survival. B cell receptor (BCR) signaling
  also promotes gene expression, proliferation, and survival. Additionally, the activation
  of the mTOR signaling pathway, involving mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, facilitates
  protein synthesis, cell growth, and differentiation. Proteins associated with each
  signaling pathway are depicted in the figure. Examples of activating receptors are
  shown, with phosphorylation of specific intermediates highlighted in yellow, including
  the phosphorylated residues. Arrows indicate cross‐talk between different pathways,
  with the scheme primarily focusing on the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
