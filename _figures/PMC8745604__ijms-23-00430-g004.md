caption: 'YAP/TAZ role in oncotherapy resistance. (A) Targeted therapy resistance.
  YAP/TAZ resistance to targeted therapy occurs mainly in EGFR and MAPK inhibitors,
  in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma takes place thanks to the induction of high
  transcription levels of AXL. Meanwhile, YAP promotes resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition
  in neuroblastomas, with a hyperactive signaling of the RAS gene in cells treated
  with trametinib. Consequently, the overexpression of YAP produces transcription
  of genes that stimulate cell cycle entry, EMT, survival and cell death evasion,
  thus increasing resistance. (B) Chemotherapy resistance. The main mechanism used
  by YAP/TAZ to induce chemotherapy resistance is by binding to TEA domains, which
  produces the activation of the promoters of the Cyr61/CTGF oncogenes, causing resistance,
  evasion of apoptosis and hypoxia when overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells
  in breast cancer. In juxtaposition, the downregulation of MYPT1 produces the activation
  of the transcriptional module of the Hippo pathway, enhancing resistance to chemotherapy
  and the emergence of CSC phenotypes in ovarian cancer. (C) Immunotherapy resistance,
  PD-L1, CSF1-3, IL-6 and CXCL5 transcription create an enhanced immunosuppression
  activity by inhibiting monoclonal antibodies whose target is PD-L1. Subsequently,
  this phenomenon leads to the suppression of cytotoxic lymphocytes activity and a
  decrease in the production of cytokines resulting in T cell exhaustion. YAP: Yes-associated
