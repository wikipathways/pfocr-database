caption: 'Ingenuity pathways analysis summary. To investigate possible interactions
  of differently regulated genes, datasets representing 568 genes with altered expression
  profile obtained from the RNAseq data for HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 were imported into the
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool and the following data is illustrated: The network
  representation of the most highly rated network (Gene Expression, Cell Death, Lipid
  Metabolism). The genes that are shaded were determined to be significant from the
  statistical analysis. The genes shaded red are up-regulated and those that are green
  are down-regulated. The intensity of the shading shows to what degree each gene
  was up or down-regulated. A solid line represents a direct interaction between the
  two gene products and a dotted line means there is an indirect interaction. Genes
  associated with Cell Death are circled with orange color.'
