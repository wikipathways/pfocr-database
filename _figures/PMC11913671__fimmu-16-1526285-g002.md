caption: Inflammatory pathways in glomerular disease. This figure depicts the key
  mechanisms of glomerular disease injury, mainly including the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway, CCL2/CCR axis, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and Toll-like receptor signaling.
  Several pathological responses, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory response,
  and fibrosis are among the major causes mediating the activation of these pathways.
  In addition, several inflammatory factors (including SOCS, IL35, PTPN2, CCL2, NLRP3,
  etc.) have been found to act on these signaling pathways to modulate glomerular
  injury
