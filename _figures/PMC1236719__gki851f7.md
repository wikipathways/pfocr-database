caption: Schematic of mutation pathways for pso-TFO crosslinks. The pso-TFO crosslinks
  enter an ERCC1/XPF dependent base substitution pathway as a result of a block to
  duplex unwinding incurred during transcription, replication, etc. An intermediate
  may also be formed in the absence of replication through the action of NER/CSB,
  although this is speculative. Base substitutions are introduced during translesion
  synthesis by pol ζ. Translesion synthesis could be by error free polymerase(s) without
  mutation. Error free recombination pathways may also resolve the intermediates generated
  by ERCC1/XPF. Deletion formation is not dependent on NER/TCR/or ERCC1/XPF and but
  does require cleavage of strands on either side of the crosslink (heavy arrows).
  These may arise in duplex DNA (A) or at a blocked replication fork through a series
  of breakage and cleavage reactions (B) or as a result of the collision of two replication
  forks on either side of the crosslink, followed by breakage of one arm of each fork
  (C). Unresolved crosslinks, or unrepaired ends may be the precursors for large rearrangements.
