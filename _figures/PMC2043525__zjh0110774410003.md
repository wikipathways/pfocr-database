caption: Gene profiles associated with TP53 status. Pathway analyses revealed the
  central relevance of TP53, highlighted with a blue arrow, in the signaling networks
  of the genes differentially expressed between cases with wild-type and mutant TP53,
  supporting the experimental design by which they were identified. Overexpressed
  genes in patients with wild-type TP53 are highlighted in red, and underexpressed
  probes in these cases are highlighted in green. Fold changes are indicated in parentheses
  with positive and negative signs, respectively.
