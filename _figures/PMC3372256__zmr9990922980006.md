caption: Secretory pathway two-hybrid systems. (A) Secretory pathway. Proteins for
  secretion are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum, transported in vesicles
  to the Golgi apparatus (optionally for further processing), and secreted into the
  extracellular fluid by fusion of a secretory vesicle with the plasma membrane. Each
  compartment hosts one of the available two-hybrid systems. (B) Screening for interactions
  between extracellular proteins (SCINEX-P) (). Wild-type Ire1 detects the presence
  of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of Ire1 leads to homodimerization,
  trans-phosphorylation, and, finally, splicing of Hac1 mRNA into correctly translatable
  mRNA. In SCINEX-P, the bait protein X is fused to an Ire1 variant (Ire1 K702R) that
  can splice Hac1 mRNA only while the prey protein Y is attached to an Ire1 variant
  (Ire1 Δtail) that can phosphorylate only its associated Ire1 partner. Upon an X-Y
  interaction within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, Ire1 Δtail phosphorylates
  Ire1 K702R, which in turn splices Hac1 mRNA, leading to correct translation of Hac1.
  Hac1 activity can be sensed by detection of inositol synthesis and by activation
  of reporters regulated by Hac1-dependent promoters. (C) Golgi two-hybrid system
  (). The catalytic (CAT) and membrane-attaching (LOC) domains of the mannosyltransferase
  Och1 are fused to the bait protein X and prey protein Y, respectively. Interaction
  of the bait with the prey within the Golgi lumen prevents loss (by secretion) of
  the Och1 catalytic domain, leading to cell survival at 37°C or at 30°C in the presence
  of Congo red. (D) Yeast surface two-hybrid system (). The membrane protein Aga1
  keeps the Aga2-bait X fusion at the cellular membrane in the extracellular fluid.
  Binding of the bait with the prey protein Y, tagged with c-Myc, is detected with
  anti-c-Myc fluorescent antibodies. Alternatively, both bait and prey proteins are
  linked with fragments of EGFP. The formation of an X-Y heterodimer results in reassembly
  of the EGFP fragments and in concomitant fluorescence. The EGFP structure image
  is based on the PDB structure under accession number 2Y0G ().
