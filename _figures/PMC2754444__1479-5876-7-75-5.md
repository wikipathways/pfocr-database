caption: T-Cell Activation Pathways Generated by HIV-Modulated Proteins. Graphic representation
  of major proteins and kinases involved in T-cell activation; the pathways were constructed
  by the direct Interaction Function Bioinformatics Programs of Stratagene Pathway
  Architect 2.0.1. All proteins were uploaded and function-specific pathways were
  generated automatically; blue outlines around red ovals (ZAP 70, CRKL, and TNR9),
  indicate the activated proteins. Note numerous cell surface proteins including PI3K
  involved in T-cell activation pathways. Lines between red ovals denote major interactions;
  green circles represent small molecule interactions. Full names of all protein abbreviations
  and accession numbers are listed in Table 1.
