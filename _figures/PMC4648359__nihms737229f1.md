caption: Stress can initiate a systemic response to activate the systemic cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway through an efferent relay and stimulate acetylcholine
  (ACh) release from neuronal cells in the skin (e.g. nerve cells) to potentially
  act on keratinocytes. The non-neuronal cholinergic system in keratinocytes is capable
  of producing ACh that can be released into the extracellular space to activate nAChRs.
  Consequently, nAChR activation dampens AMP production and epidermal barrier integrity.
  Injury or infection during stress can either initiate or exacerbate existing skin
  pathologies. Episodes of more frequent or severe outbreaks of skin disease can signal
  a negative feedback loop back to the brain to provoke a secondary stress response
  to further suppress keratinocyte AMP and barrier function.
