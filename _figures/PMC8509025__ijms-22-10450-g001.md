  The orange box indicates the concerted action of DPE1 and PHO1, which might define
  the fate of the metabolites. The trimmed MOs that are generated by the action of
  DBEs and PHO1 and branched oligosaccharides enter the starch biosynthetic pathway
  together, where they are first elongated by the concerted action of DPE1 and PHO1
  metabolon, followed by the further elongation of by the SBEs and PHO1 complex. Alternatively,
  branched oligosaccharides are further elongated and branched by the combined action
  of PHO1 and isozymes of SBEs. Fusion of the generated products leads to the formation
  of pre-amylopectin via the possible complex of PHO1, SSs, and SBEs isozymes (still
  unknown). Trimming of MOs on the pre-mature amylopectin leads to its maturation
  that further combines with amylose (generated via the action of GBSSI) to form the
  starch granules. Produced from [,,,,,,,].'
