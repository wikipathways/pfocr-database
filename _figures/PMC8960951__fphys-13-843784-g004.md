caption: Potential role of chronic PE on redox system in vitiligo patients. Muscle
  contraction and mitochondrial activity produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide
  during physical exercise, acting as an activation signal for the NF-κB, Nrf2, and,
  PGC1-α metabolic pathway downstream. ATP degradation and calcium release caused
  by muscle contraction also significantly induce the AMP/AMPK/PGC1-α axis. During
  acute exercise, gene transcription of EAS enzymes is significantly induced by the
  NF-κB and Nrf2o pathways; genes encode enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway
  (i.e., for NADPH synthesis) is induced by the Nrf2 pathway; mitochondrial gene transcription
  is induced by the NF-κB, Nrf2, and PGC1-α pathways. Only chronic physical exercise
  will significantly induce the synthesis of mitochondria, EAS enzymes, and NADPH
  synthesis. Muscle contraction also releases a large amount of IL-6 and hydrogen
  peroxide to the extracellular medium, which may exert systemic signaling. Future
  research is needed to identify whether IL-6 and hydrogen peroxide from muscle tissue
  can exert significant signaling in the epidermis. Also, further research will be
  needed to assess whether the increase in mitochondria in muscle tissue can buffer
  the ROS produced by melanocytes in the epidermis of patients with vitiligo and whether
  this has clinical relevance. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
