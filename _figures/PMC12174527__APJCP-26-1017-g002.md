caption: 'Metabolic Pathway of RFC. Reduced Folate enters the cell through the RFC
  carrier and is converted to DHF and THF by the DHFR enzyme. Then, THF proceeds in
  two ways. It was first converted to methylene THF with SHMT1, which is also very
  important in the production of DNA synthesis precursors. By MTHFR enzyme, methylene
  THF is converted into CHO – THF and DHF. In the second path, THF enters into the
  mitochondria where it is converted into Format by the enzyme SHMT2 this pathway
  is known as one-carbon metabolism. DHF: dihydrofolate; DHFR: dihydrofolate reductase;
  THF: tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SHMT1/2, serine
  hydroxymethyl transferase; MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1'
