caption: Molecular networks enriched by miRNAs differentially expressed in H1299/mutant
  p53R273H cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) generated top three significantly
  enriched regulatory networks of mutant p53R273H regulated miRNAs. The networks illustrate
  direct or indirect interactions between altered miRNAs and their target genes. Only
  the highlighted (green/red) miRNAs were present in our dataset. Green and red represent
  down-regulated and up-regulated miRNAs, respectively.
