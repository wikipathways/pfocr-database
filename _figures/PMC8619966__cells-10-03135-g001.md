caption: SHH signaling pathway and its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Right
  panel represents the ON-OFF signaling of the HH pathway. In the absence of HH ligand,
  Ptch1 inhibits surface localization of Smo, leaving Sufu free to bind to Gli, thus
  repressing it and preventing HH target gene expression. In the presence of HH ligand,
  Gli is released from Sufu to translocate into the nucleus, thus activating HH target
  genes. Left panel elaborates different immunosuppressive cell types infiltrated
  into the tumor microenvironment and the associated cytokines and growth factors.
  Oncogenic HH signaling recruits immune cells such as tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs), immune-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) for immune modulation.
