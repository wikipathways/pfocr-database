caption: 'B and T cell activation and metabolism. (A) B cells (plasma cells) are activated
  by a T cell via BCR. Transcription of GLUT-1 is increased and favors glucose uptake
  and aerobic glycolysis. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required for redox
  balance and nucleotide synthesis whereas pyruvate and αKG go to the TCA cycle. Citrate
  excess is redirected to lipid synthesis. CD28 activation is required for long-lived
  plasma cells by stimulating growth and proliferation. (B) T cell activation occurs
  via APCs, in which MHC I or II binds to TCR and the co-stimulatory CD28. Drp-1 regulates
  mitochondrial fission playing an important role in metabolic reprogramming, proliferation,
  and migration in activated T cells. Glycolysis is upregulated and most of the pyruvate
  is excreted from the cell as lactate. Citrate from the TCA cycle is used for lipid
  synthesis. The PPP is important for generating NADPH and nucleotide synthesis. Abbreviations:
  CD: cluster of differentiation; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; G6P: glucose-6-phosphate;
  GLUT-1: glucose transporter; Drp-1: dynamin related protein-1; TCR: T cell receptor;
  MHC: major histocompatibility complex; APC: antigen presenting cell; ACC: acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase. Created with biorender.com.'
