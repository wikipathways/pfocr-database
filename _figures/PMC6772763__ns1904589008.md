caption: Multiple signaling pathways regulate the cell death pathway in sympathetic
  neurons. This schematic diagram depicts three points at which NGF can inhibit further
  progression of the cell death pathway. PI-3-K activity is required for NGF-dependent
  inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation but is not required for inhibition of Bax translocation
  to the mitochondria or release of cytochromec from the mitochondria. MEK/MAPK does
  not account for any of these NGF-dependent events, and the signaling pathways required
  for these two events remain unknown.
