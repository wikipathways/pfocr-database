caption: Role of Sp1 in the Pkc1 signaling pathway of C. neoformans. Pkc1 phosphorylates
  a member of the MAPK signaling pathway, Bck1, with subsequent phosphorylation of
  Mkk2 and the downstream component Mpk1 to mediate cell wall integrity, growth at
  high temperature, and virulence. Pkc1 also regulates the transcription factor Sp1
  by phosphorylation, leading to activation by nuclear translocation as well as by
  transcriptional mechanisms, leading to regulation of osmoresistance, cell wall integrity,
  and virulence in parallel with the MAPK pathway as well as a unique pathway leading
  to resistance to nitrosative stress, capsule production, and caspofungin resistance.
  Laccase (Lac1) is regulated by Pkc1 via an unknown pathway. DAG, diacylglycerol.
