caption: 'A simplified schematic showing our hypothesis about nitrogen metabolism
  and its interaction with carbon metabolism in a water stress-induced CAM-idling
  bromeliad, G. monostachia, submitted to urea nutrition. Urea is taken up at the
  leaf basal part and after its hydrolysis generates NH4+ and CO2. At the green leaf
  part and mainly in the apex portion during the night, the CO2 may be assimilated
  through the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathway. Urea nutrition associated
  with water stress positively stimulated PEPC1 and ALMT9 gene expressions and PEPC1
  activity, resulting in a higher nocturnal vacuolar acidity. NH4+, in turn, mainly
  after entering a cell of the apical leaf region may be assimilated during the light–dark
  period in the cytosol mediated by the enzyme GS1 forming glutamine (Gln). Therefore,
  glutamine and glutamate (Glu) biosynthesis may occur in separate compartments. The
  mitochondria may supply the carbon skeleton for Fd-GOGAT functioning. The key C-compound,
  2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), may derive from sugar respiration reactions. In this pathway,
  citrate is used to generate the isocitrate required for 2-OG synthesis, allowing
  the net Glu production in the chloroplast and then other amino acid formation. Abbreviations
  for enzymes: PEPC1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 1; PPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase kinase; NAD-MDH, NAD-malate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; GS1, glutamine
  synthetase 1; Fd-GOGAT, glutamine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase; and NADP-ICDH,
  NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase. Abbreviations for transporters: ALMT9, tonoplast
  aluminum-activated malate transporter 9; DUR3, urea transporter; AMT3.1, ammonium
  transporter; TIP2.1, tonoplast intrinsic protein; PIP1.2, plasma membrane intrinsic
  protein; AA, amino acid.'
