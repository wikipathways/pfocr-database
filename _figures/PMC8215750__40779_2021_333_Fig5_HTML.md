caption: Schematic drawing of the novel RIG-I signaling pathway in CS-AKI. In the
  crush syndrome related acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) rat model, muscle tissue releases
  large amounts of myoglobin to injure the kidney. Myoglobin binds to RIG-I after
  endocytosis, then mainly activate NK-κB/caspase-3 axis, not the classical IRF-3/IFN-β
  signaling pathway in CS-AKI rat kidney. In this process, the expression of pro-inflammation
  cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α are also increased to some degree
