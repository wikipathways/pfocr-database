caption: '(A) Pathway landscape. The top enriched pathways (with the q-value ≤0.001)
  are reported for the pan-cancer. Node color indicates enrichment frequency, ie,
  shared pathways among down- or upregulated genes. Therefore, blue indicated two
  cancers sharing, red indicates three cancers sharing, and gray indicates more than
  three cancers sharing. Edge color represents pathways enriched among downregulated
  genes (green) and upregulated genes (red). The edge size indicates the DEG number
  enriching the pathway. (B) Pan-cancer KEGG-disease map. Node color indicates enrichment
  frequency, ie, shared diseases among down- or upregulated genes in the pan-cancer.
  Blue: shared between two cancers; Red: shared between three cancers; Gray: shared
  between more than three cancers. Edge color indicates regulation sign, up (red)
  and down (green). Black links indicate genes connecting directly to disease pathways.
  (C) Pan-cancer gene-drug map. Red or green edges stand for up- or downregulation
  in our pan-cancer, respectively. Black links target genes and drugs that refer to
  the source (http://www.mycancergenome.org/) integrated in DGIdb. Disease boxes show
  color according to previous annotations. (D) Pan-cancer druggable gene-disease map.
  Search categories available in DGIdb allow to find druggable DEGs that are associated
  with diseases, and without having a direct known drug (removing all genes appearing
  in the drug map). Solid edges stand for curated gene category interactions, and
  dashed edges stand for predicted interactions. Disease boxes show color according
  to previous annotations.'
