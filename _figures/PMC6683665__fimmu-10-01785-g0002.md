caption: Comparison of Toll and TLR pathways from shrimp (A), Drosophila (B), and
  Human (C). Homologies between signaling components are depicted by similar shapes
  and colors. In shrimp, there are two extracellular-signaling routes leading to Toll
  pathway activation. Considering that many Spätzle (Spz) genes from shrimp have been
  identified and are able to induce Toll-Dorsal-controlled AMPs, the extracellular
  cleavage of Spz mediated by protease cascades could be similar to those of Drosophila.
  In the immune responses to microbial recognition, the protease cascades lead to
  the activation of Spz-processing enzymes (SPEs) to cleave full length Spz. Upon
  proteolytical processing, the Spz prodomain is cleaved, exposing the C-terminal
  Spz parts that are critical for binding of Toll. Spz binding to the Toll receptor
  initiates intracellular signaling. In contrast, shrimp Tolls are able to sense and
  directly bind to some conserved motifs, such as PGN, LPS, and ODN, from microbes,
  which are similar to those of Human. Upon binding to these motifs, shrimp Tolls
  are activated and initiate intracellular signaling. In the intracellular-signaling
  event, signaling cascades of shrimp Toll pathways broadly resemble those of Drosophila.
  After Toll activation, the adaptor MyD88 builds a signaling complex with Tube and
  Pelle. The MyD88-Tube-Pelle complex in turn recruits other regulators, such as Pellino
  and TRAF6, which leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of Cactus and thereby
  releases Dorsal (and/or Dif in Drosophila) to translocate to the nucleus and activate
  transcription. In Human, there are MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signal-transduction
  events. The intracellular signaling of Human can lead to active NF-κB, AP-1 and
  IFN regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) for their nuclear translocation and subsequent
  transcriptional activation of target genes. Of note, Toll3 from L. vannamei and
  Toll2 from P. clarkii have been shown to activate IRF and ATF4, respectively, leading
  to transcriptional synthesis of some antiviral effectors, such as Vago4/5 and ALFs.
