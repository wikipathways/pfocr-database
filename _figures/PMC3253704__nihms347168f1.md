caption: Schematic representation of prominent signaling pathways involved with PDAC
  tumoral compartment and stromal compartment crosstalk. Induction of some of these
  pathways by RAS activation is a contributing factor. The cells of the tumoral compartment
  can both respond to TGF-β pathway activation as well as produce ligand that can
  then act in a paracrine fashion to affect cells of the stromal compartment. Likewise,
  cells of the tumoral compartment can respond to Hh activation and also produced
  ligand to affect the surrounding stromal cells. Chemokines and growth factors produced
  by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and PSCs can stimulate NF-κB signaling in cells
  of both compartments. Likewise, these cells can produce chemokines and growth factors
  to further stimulate NF-κB signaling in a paracrine manner. This schematic greatly
  simplifies the complexity of this crosstalk but highlights its importance in function
  of both cellular compartments.
