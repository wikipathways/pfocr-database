caption: The biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acids. At the top of the figure the formation
  of activated C26-CoA is shown, which is one half of the condensation shown at the
  bottom of the figure. The remainder of the figure is concerned with the formation
  of the meromycolates. The pathway for the formation of the double bonds in the meromycolates
  remains unclear and two possibilities are shown. One of these requires isomerization
  of the normal cis double bond to trans, and the other the use of desaturase enzymes.
  These two possibilities are shown using dotted lines.
