caption: 'Reannotation processes. (a) Full network map of iMO1056. Metabolic processes
  are grouped together, and an effort was made to link pathways to their major carbon
  donors and sinks in central metabolism, although many metabolites occupy two or
  more locations on the map. All internal boxes are meant to highlight metabolic processes
  rather than to denote cellular localizations. The double line surrounding the map
  represents the cell barrier. (b, c, and d) Several types of reannotation that went
  into iMO1056. Large gray arrows denote the reannotation process: initial annotation
  statuses are shown before the arrows, and reannotated gene functions are shown after
  the arrows. The location of each newly annotated gene is highlighted on the map.
  (b) PA3004 was functionally identified by literature mining. (c) A gap in the KDO
  synthesis pathway was identified, and PA4457 was found by a BLAST search to fulfill
  the missing function. (d) NAD initially could not be synthesized anaerobically in
  iMO1056, since O2 was required for NAD synthesis. However, literature mining revealed
  a putative alternate stoichiometry for the l-aspartate oxidase reaction (ASPO8)
  that does not require oxygen.'
