caption: 'Overview of L-arginine metabolism. Simplified diagram summarising the ARG
  pathways, together with polyamine and collagen synthesis. The NOS branch of the
  ARG pathways is highlighted in green, polyamine production in orange and collagen
  production in yellow. L-arginine is an AA that can be derived either from diet or
  from recycled L-citrulline deriving from glutamate, glutamine or proline. L-arginine
  can be metabolised by ARG1 during the urea cycle, L-ornithine and urea being its
  breakdown products. L-ornithine, in turn, can be the precursor of several molecular
  events including the synthesis of L-proline via OAT, the synthesis of the polyamine
  putrescine via ODC, and the production of L-citrulline via OCT. L-proline represents
  a key collagen building block. Putrescine, together with its downstream products
  spermidine and spermine, make up the reversible polyamine pathway that contributes
  to cell proliferation. An important rate-limiting enzyme of the polyamine pathway
  is AMD1. L-arginine is also a secretagogue for growth hormone (GH), which contributes
  to cell proliferation via IGF-1-dependent polyamine pathway enhancement. Finally,
  L-arginine can be metabolised by NOS, the reaction products being NO and L-citrulline.
  Enzymes are highlighted in red. Abbreviations: AA, amino acid; AdoMet, S-Adenosyl
  methionine; AMD1, AdoMet decarboxylase; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate
