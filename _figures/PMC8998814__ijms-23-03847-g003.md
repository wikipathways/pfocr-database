caption: Integration network of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (ERK/MAPK), and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling pathways
  involved in metastasis processes. Several signaling pathways are involved in the
  progress of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and these pathways can
  work together to elicit complete EMT responses. Apart from its ability to promote
  EMT through the expression of mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) proteins, transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β) can also activate the phosphotyrosine 3-kinase/RAC-alpha
  serine/threonine-protein kinase (PI3K–AKT), ERK–MAPK, P38–MAPK, and c-JUN N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. After TβRI phosphorylates the adaptor protein SRC
  homology 2 domain-containing-transforming A (SHCA), it provides a docking site for
  the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and the son of sevenless (SOS),
  an event that signals the initiation of the MAPK cascade involving RAS, RAF, MEK,
  and ERK. Interaction of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) with the TGF receptor
  complex stimulates TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which contributes to activation
  of P38 and JNK. The EMT is facilitated by the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK,
  which increase the expression of EMT transcription factors and proteins involved
  in cell motility or invasion, such as RHO GTPases that activate the RHO-associated
  kinase (ROCK) protein to confer cell contraction. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1)
  (not shown here) can promote EMT by activating the expression of the TWIST protein,
  which acts as a transcription factor. TGFβ signaling involves activation of SMAD
  proteins that stimulates expression SNAI/L and down-regulates the expression of
  VE-cadherin, CD31, and claudin 5 to facilitate the metastasis process. Other EMT-inducing
  transcription factors include forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2), paired mesoderm homeobox
  protein 1 (PRRX1), SLUG, and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB). Furthermore,
  the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway may be activated both by EGFR and TGFβ signaling.
