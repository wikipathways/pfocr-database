caption: SiO32− modulated multicellular differentiation and interactions via the FOXO
  signaling pathway. SiO32− activated the FOXO1 signaling pathway in CD4+ T cells,
  leading to a significant reduction in their differentiation into TH17 cells. Concurrently,
  CS promotes FOXO3 expression in neutrophils and fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting
  their differentiation into NETs and myofibroblasts, respectively. This comprehensive,
  multicellular regulatory mechanism disrupts the harmful interactions between CD4+
  T/TH17 cells and neutrophils/fibroblasts, breaking the vicious cycle of myocardial
  inflammation and blocking the progression of fibrotic lesions post-iDCM. This figure
