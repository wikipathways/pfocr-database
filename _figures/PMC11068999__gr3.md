caption: The Notch signaling pathway. Notch pathway activation occurs when Notch ligand
  (Delta) expressed in signal-sending cells interacts with the Notch receptor, which
  contains extracellular (NECD), transmembrane (TM), and intracellular (NICD) domains.
  In signal-receiving cells, ligand-receptor binding induces the sequential proteolytic
  cleavage of NICD by ADAM and γ-secretase. The NICD translocates to the nucleus and
  attaches to the CSL transcription factor complex, thereby stimulating transcription
  of Notch target genes. Signal-sending cells maintain ligand-NECD binding and internalize
  it, followed by ligand endocytosis or recycling. Ginsenoside Rg5 binds to SIRT1,
  activating its negative regulator of Notch
