caption: 'Upon ER stress, ATF6 disassociates from GRP78 and translocates to the Golgi
  apparatus, where it is cleaved by proteases. Cleaved ATF6 is an active bZIP transcription
  factor: it translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoters of UPR target
  genes, such as BIP/GRP78, CRYAB, and XBP1, and VEGF. These genes directly and indirectly
  regulate the angiogenic process in various ways.'
