caption: Schematic drawing illustrating the effects of Kir4.1 dysfunction on neural
  hyperexcitation and astrocytic BDNF expression. Dysfunction (genetic mutation, down-regulated
  expression, and pharmacological blockade) of Kir4.1 channels increases extracellular
  K+ and glutamate at synapses and causes neural hyperexcitability. The dysfunction
  of Kir4.1 channels activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and facilitates
  BDNF expression in astrocytes. Based on these changes, astrocytic Kir4.1 channels
  play important roles in modulating seizure induction and epileptogenesis. Modified
  from Ohno et al. ().
