caption: 'Inflammatory signaling pathways involved in MDS and associated therapeutic
  targets. S100A8/A9 bind to TLR4 and CD33 and initiate the assembly of the NLRP3
  inflammasome. The binding of S100A8/A9 to TLR4 also activates NF-kB through IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, which results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  (pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18). S100A8/A9 promote NOX activation, leading to excessive
  production of ROS and the subsequent activation of NLPR3 and inflammasome assembly.
  Inflammasomes recruit ASCs to form complexes that facilitate the conversion of pro-caspase-1
  to caspase-1. Mature and activated caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into
  their bioactive forms, which induce pyroptosis. TLR: toll-like receptor; TIRAP:
  toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein; IRAK: interleukin
  receptor-associated kinase; TRAF: tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor;
  IκK: inhibitor of κB kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; NLRP3: nucleotide-binding
  domain and leucine-rich repeat pattern recognition receptor; ASC: apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain; GSDMD: gasdermin D;
  NOX: nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  Ub: ubiquitin; TGF-β: transforming factor-β; IL: interleukin'
