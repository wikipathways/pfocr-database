caption: Structural mutations observed in ΔproA and ΔproB experiments analyzed in
  relation to ArgE underground activity. a Metabolic pathway maps related to ΔproA
  and ΔproB false positive cases. Both are involved in L-proline synthesis. Model
  simulations predict using an alternate pathway related to arginine and ornithine
  synthesis to rescue a proA/proB deficient E. coli strain. Mutations were observed
  in the coding regions of the metabolic genes argD and glnA. It is suggested that
  reduced flux through these enzymes increases flux through the ArgE associated underground
  activity, thus increasing production of L-proline and allowing for cell growth.
  b Mutation analysis in relation to the glutamine synthetase (GlnA) protein structure.
  An I-Tasser-predicted protein structure is provided [] and the amino acid residue
  associated with observed glnA mutations in the ΔproB populations are highlighted
  in red. Those residues associated with ligand binding based on the crystal structure
  of the Salmonella typhimurium GlnA enzyme [] are highlighted in blue. The mutations
  appear to be in buried regions of the homo-dodecameric enzyme at the interface of
  chain-chain interactions
