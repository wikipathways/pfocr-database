caption: The mechanism of canonical Wnt pathway. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  plays a crucial role in normal physiological conditions, both in the presence and
  absence of the Wnt signal. In the absence of an extracellular canonical Wnt signal
  (Wnt off), the intracellular protein dishevelled (Dvl) remains inactive. Consequently,
  the β-catenin “destruction complex”, comprising APC, CK1α, GSK3β, and Axin, facilitates
  the phosphorylation of β-catenin. This phosphorylated β-catenin is then ubiquitinated
  and degraded through the action of the E3-ubiquitin ligase β-TRCP. In the nucleus,
  the transcription factors TCF/LEF function as transcriptional repressors of downstream
  genes by binding to Groucho/TLE. Conversely, when the canonical Wnt signal is present
  (Wnt on), it is recognized by the frizzled (Fzd) receptor and its co-receptor LRP5/6,
  forming a ternary complex. The intracellular domain of Fzd subsequently recruits
  Dvl, which promotes the phosphorylation of LRP6 and facilitates the recruitment
  and inhibition of Axin and GSK3β. As a result, the β-catenin “destruction complex”
  failes to form, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, β-catenin competes Groucho/TLE for binding to TCF/LEF, thereby initiating
  the transcription of downstream target genes
