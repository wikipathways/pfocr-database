caption: SARS-CoV-2 viral entry to host cell pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches
  to host cell surfaces via specific receptors, ACE2 and CD147, via spike protein
  (S1) projecting from the viral envelope. The spike protein first has to be “primed”
  by proteolytic cleavage by TMPRRS2 which can also cleave ACE2 resulting in shedding
  of the ectodomain. In contrast to TMPRSS2, which facilitates virus binding, ACE2
  can also be cleaved by ADAM17, which prevents viral binding and results in shedding
  of the ACE2 ectodomain that can still bind to SARS-CoV-2 and act as a decoy receptor
  reducing viral infection. The entry of the virus is facilitated by the protein chaperone,
  GRP78 that also binds to the spike protein. Metabolic stress in the host cell results
  in upregulation of GRP78 and its translocation to the cell surface. On the cell
  surface ACE2, CD147, GRP78, TMPRSS2, and ADAM17 all cluster within organized cholesterol-rich
  domains called lipid rafts and together can enable viral entry via endocytosis.
  Viral replication within the cell can also be facilitated by GRP78.
