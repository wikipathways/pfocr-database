caption: '(A) Coordinate regulation: By modulating the activity of REV7, a cell can
  simultaneously coordinate two mutagenic DSB repair processes. This would provide
  the cell with a dial to exert significant control over mutagenic processes with
  a single signal. Such a dial could be adjusted based on cell type, cell cycle phase
  or external stimuli. It is also expected to be hijacked in cancer cells to either
  promote rapid growth and mutagenesis or resist chemotherapy. (B and C) Cooperation
  at stalled replication forks: translesion synthesis and double strand break repair
  factors are both known to act at certain types of stalled replication forks, hence
  direct interaction and cooperation between Shieldin and Polζ may be useful in this
  circumstance to inhibit homologous recombination and promote translesion synthesis.
  The ability of REV7 to interact with multiple partners simultaneously and form different
  types of homodimers allows for many possible higher order structures including hybrid
  Shieldin-Polζ complexes. While these have not been experimentally observed, they
  have not been ruled out. One such hypothetical hybrid complex is shown in (B).'
