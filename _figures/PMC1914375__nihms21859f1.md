caption: Pheromone response pathway.(A) The wild-type pheromone signaling pathway.
  The inactive pathway is shown on the left, with the intact heterotrimeric G protein
  complex (Gpa1p, Ste4p, and Ste18p and the inactive MAPK cascade (Ste11p, Ste7p,
  and Fus3p, and the Ste5p scaffold). This leaves the transcription factor (Ste12p)
  unphosphorylated, leading to low transcription from PFUS1. On the right is the active
  pathway, in which pheromone binding (blue circle) to the transmembrane receptor
  drives dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein. Free Ste4p associates with
  the Ste20p kinase and the Ste5p scaffold to initiate the phosphorylation cascade
  resulting in Fus3p activation. Active Fus3p phosphorylates Ste12p, which in turn
  activates transcription from PFUS1. (B)  A schematic of the bistable pheromone response
  with positive feedback. A dominant active protein (the black square) is induced
  by pheromone treatment and, once expressed, maintains the activity of the MAPK cascade
  even after pheromone removal. Addition of Shokat’s Inhibitor (SI, red octagon) blocks
  the pheromone response downstream of the positive feedback, breaking the feedback
  loop and resetting the cell to its uninduced state. Note that either the inactive
  (top) or active (bottom) state can persist in untreated cells, depending on their
  history.
