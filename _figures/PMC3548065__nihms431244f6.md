caption: '(A) TNF-mediated activation of IKKα not only induces NF-κB transactivation
  through the canonical TNF-IKKα-NF-κB signaling pathway but also negatively regulates
  this event by phosphorylating PIAS1 at the S90 residue. Similar to IKKα, TNF-mediated
  activation of MK2 leads to NF-κB transactivation and also activates a negative feedback
  mechanism through which MK2 phosphorylates PIAS1 at the S522 residue to enhance
  its transrepression of NF-κB and p53 SUMOylation, p53 nuclear export, and subsequent
  KLF2-mediated eNOS expression. (B) The domafin structure of PIAS1. SAP domain: scaffold
  attachment factor A and B. PINIT: Pro-Ile-Asn-Ile-Thr motif. RLD: RING-finger-like
  zinc binding domain, protein-protein interactions, interacts with the SUMO conjugase
  Ubc9, sumoylation. AD: highly acidic domain. S/T: serine/threonine rich region.
  PIAS1 S90 site lie in the NF-κB interacting region, whereas PIAS1 S522 site does
  not lie in any of PIAS1’s functional domains involved in NF-κB binding or its SUMO
  E3 ligase activity (RLD) domain.'
