caption: 'Schematic representation of the ER signaling pathway and its key functions.
  Estrogen (E) can bind to the estrogen receptor (ERα, ERβ and GPER) to affect the
  expression and activity of several signaling pathways. Genomic pathway: (I) The
  E2/ER complex can bind to estrogen response elements (EREs) within the target gene
  promoter or regulate gene transcription by interacting with other transcription
  factors (TFs), such as AP-1 and Sp1. (II) The E2/ER complex also activates signaling
  pathways that phosphorylate (green dot) ERs or other associated transcription factors
  (e.g., ERK and NFkB) and modulate gene expression. (III) E2-induced cellular and
  mitochondrial ER/GPER genomic and non-genomic effects regulate mitochondrial respiration,
  ATP production and ROS formation'
