caption: (A) EGR transcription factors are essential in the functional regulation
  of T cells. Upon the TCR stimulation of T cells, the transcriptional activation
  of EGR factors can trigger different cell fate decisions, a process modulated by
  the synergistic action of NFAT and EGR in the promoter region. Regulators in the
  promoter region include cytokines (such as IL-2 and TNF-α), co-stimulatory molecules
  (such as CD40L) and several regulatory molecules, such as FasL and the ubiquitin
  ligase Cbl-b, These factors do not bind directly to gene promoters; they activate
  downstream signalling pathways (such as JAK-STAT, NF-κB and MAPK) by interacting
  with their respective cell surface receptors, which in turn modulate the binding
  of nuclear transcription factors (including STATs, NF-κB, AP-1 and NFAT) to bind
  to promoters, which ultimately affects the transcriptional activity of genes indirectly.
  (B) EGR2 and EGR3 are essential negative regulators in the NFAT pathway and play
  key regulatory roles within the cell. EGR3 upregulates EGR2 expression, and collectively,
  they inhibit T cell function by increasing negative regulatory molecule expression
  (such as Cbl-b) and inhibiting the expression of T-cell activators, EGR1 and NAB2.
