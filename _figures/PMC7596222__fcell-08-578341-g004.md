caption: Molecular pathways triggered by eCSF-derived factors. The growth factors
  found in the eCSF are mainly known to trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPK) pathway (also known as the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway). This molecular signaling
  pathway is involved in the regulation of several essential cellular processes such
  as proliferation, differentiation, survival and death. BMP receptors (BMPR) activate
  the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5, which can activate directly transcription of target
  genes or act via the translocation of YAP into the nucleus. WNT molecules activate
  the Frizzled receptors and LRP6 co-receptors which will allow Disheveled (DVL) to
  inhibit the Axin-APC complex. This complex is a major inhibitor of β-catenin. Therefore,
  upon WNT activation, β-catenin is free to be directed into the nucleus to activate
  its target genes. Finally SHH binds to its receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), which then
  releases the 7 transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) from its inhibition. Smo activation
  triggers the cleavage of Gli transcription factors into their active form (GliA).
  GliA is then enriched in the nucleus to allow transcription of target genes (such
  as Cyclin D1 or Gli itself).
