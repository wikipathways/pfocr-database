caption: PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Insulin binds to its receptor, causing the recruitment
  of downstream signaling molecules, such as IRSs. The phosphorylation of IRS enables
  binding of PI3K, which phosphorylates PIP2 to form PIP3, while PTEN can dephosphorylate
  PIP3. A high concentration of PIP3 causes the recruitment of PDK1, which promotes
  activation of AKT. In turn, AKT induces glycogen storage by inhibiting GSK-3β, and
  increases uptake of glucose by promoting translocation of GLUT4 vesicles. PTP1B
  serves as an important negative regulator of insulin signaling. In addition, AKT
  inhibits mTORC1 by inhibiting TSC1/2, and PI3K/AKT activates eNOS, leading to the
  release of NO. In DCM, the PI3K/AKT pathway is blocked, resulting in decreases in
  intracellular glucose transport and NO bioavailability. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
