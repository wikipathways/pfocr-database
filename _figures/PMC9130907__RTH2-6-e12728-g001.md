caption: Graphical summary of the proposed mechanistic crosstalk between adaptive
  immunity and hemostasis in cancer. (A) Thrombin‐mediated activation of tumor cell‐associated
  PAR‐1 and factor Xa‐mediated activation of TAM‐associated PAR‐2 downregulate T‐cell
  effector functions, limiting adaptive tumor immunity. Thrombin‐mediated activation
  of T cell‐associated PAR‐1 has been linked to upregulation of T‐cell effector functions
  in other contexts, but whether this pathway plays a role in adaptive tumor immunity
  remains to be determined. See text for details. (B) Upregulation of adaptive tumor
  immunity could promote thrombosis through multiple mechanisms. Killing of tumor
  cells could result in release of TF‐expressing microvesicles. T cell activation
  has been shown to result in upregulation of monocyte/macrophage TF expression in
  vitro. Whether this mechanism is relevant in the context of cancer remains to be
  determined. Increased circulating levels of IL‐8 have been associated with an increased
  incidence of thrombosis in patients receiving ICI therapy. IL‐8 has been shown to
  promote NETosis in myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), providing a potential
  link between IL‐8 and thrombosis. See text for details
