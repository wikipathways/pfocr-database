caption: Mevalonate pathway regulates growth and proteostasis through autophagy. (A)
  The mevalonate pathway regulates autophagy at several steps, including autophagy
  initiation and autophagosome maturation. HMGCR is 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  reductase, RAB11 is a small GTPase involved in vesicle transport, and the mTOR pathway
  is the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. (B) Genetic or pharmacological inhibition
  of the mevalonate pathway has various cellular consequences that are caused by reduced
  autophagy and have potential implications for human health.
