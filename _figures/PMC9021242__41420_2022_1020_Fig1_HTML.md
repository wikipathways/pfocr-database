caption: 'The hippo pathway is mainly composed of MST1/2, LATS1/2, SAV1, MOB1, YAP
  or TAZ, and TEAD. When the hippo pathway is unactivated, unphosphorylated YAP enters
  the nucleus and binds to TEAD, thus inducing transcription of target genes. When
  the hippo pathway is activated, TAOK phosphorylates MST1/2. Phosphorylated MST1/2
  binds to SAV1 to form the MST1/2-SAV1 complex. With the assistance of activated
  MOB1, the MST1/2-SAV1 complex induces phosphorylation of the LATS1/2. Phosphorylated
  LATS1/2 activates YAP, resulting in YAP being captured by 14-3-3 proteins in the
  cytoplasm or being degraded by SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase mediated ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. Note: TAOK, thousand-and-one amino-acid kinase; MAP4K1-7 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase kinases 1–7, MST1/2 mammalian STE20-like kinase 1/2,
  SAV1 sav family containing protein 1, LATS1/2 large tumor suppressor 1/2, MOB1 MOB
  kinase Activator 1, TEA TEA domain family, VGLL4 vestigial-like family member 4.'
