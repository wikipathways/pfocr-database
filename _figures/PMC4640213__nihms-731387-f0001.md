caption: Schematic of the HLA class I pathway. Endogenous proteins are degraded by
  the proteasome, and the resulting peptides are transported into the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) by a protein called TAP. Inside the ER, peptides are loaded onto
  HLA class I molecules. Stable HLA–peptide complexes are sent to the Golgi, and then
  they are shuttled to the cell surface for display. Circulating T cells can survey
  cellular health by interacting with HLA–peptide complexes. Tumor-specific peptides
  containing aberrant phosphorylations indicative of malignant transformation, shown
  in red, can induce T cells to specifically kill transformed cells. Almost all nucleated
  cells express HLA class I alleles. The immunological activity of cancer-specific
  HLA-associated peptide antigens makes them strong candidates for future cancer immunotherapeutics.
