caption: 'Simplified scheme of the complement activation network. *Only part of the
  functional spectrum of properdin (FP) is visualized: FP may act as pattern recognition
  molecule and recruit C3b from plasma to the target surface (AP initiation); in addition,
  it stabilizes both the AP C3 and C5 convertases. Only the AP C5 convertase (C3bBb3b)
  is shown; a CP/LP C5 convertase (C4b2b3b) is also formed. **The regulation of the
  CP/LP C3 convertase is depicted a one-step process but follows a two-step mechanism
  similar to C3b, including decay acceleration (C4BP, CD35) and FI-mediated degradation
  to iC4b (C4BP, CD35, CD46). ***The function of C5L2 is not fully described and may
  be content-specific; C5a and C5a-desArg bind equally well to C5L2 whereas their
  binding and signaling profiles on C5aR is distinct. The binding of C3a-desArg to
  C5L2 remains controversial. Abbreviations: AP, alternative pathway; C1-INH, C1 inhibitor;
