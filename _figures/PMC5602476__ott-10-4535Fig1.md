caption: 'EML4–ALK pathways and the mechanism of resistance to crizotinib.Notes: (A)
  Crizotinib binds to the ALK-TKI domain of the EML4–ALK fusion protein and inhibits
  downstream signaling of canonical oncogenic pathways such as the PI3K pathway and
  RAS pathway. (B) Acquired resistance to crizotinib occurs after crizotinib treatment
  due to mutations in ALK. In addition, amplification of C-KIT and/or increased EGFR
  signaling can cause progression, independent of EML4–ALK. Cells remain ALK driven,
  and alectinib successfully improves PFS by inhibiting several ALK mutations that
  cause crizotinib resistance.Abbreviations: EML4–ALK, echinoderm microtubule-associated
  protein-like–anaplastic lymphoma kinase; ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase; TKI, tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RAS, rat sarcoma protein; C-KIT,
  proto-oncogene C-KIT; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PFS, progression-free
  survival; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; Mek, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.'
