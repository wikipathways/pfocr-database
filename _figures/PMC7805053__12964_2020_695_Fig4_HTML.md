caption: Schematic diagram depicting IL17RD (Sef) modulation of the TIR signaling
  pathway. IL17RD regulates TIR signaling by interfering with recruitment of upstream
  and downstream adapter proteins to modulate host immune response. In TLR signaling,
  IL17RD binds to plasma membrane TLR4 and endosomal TLR3 in resting cells. Upon recognition
  of extracellular and intracellular microbial components such as LPS and poly I:C,
  IL17RD associates with adapter proteins MyD88, Mal, TRIF and TRAM to modulate their
  interaction with TRAF6. Therefore, IL17RD indirectly suppresses the ubiquitination
  of TRAF6 to inhibit the activation of the canonical NF-κB and non-canonical IRF3
  pathways and expression of target genes. With respect to signaling downstream of
  IL1 ligands from the TIR family, IL17RD regulates activation of the NF-κB pathway
  downstream of IL1α binding to IL1R, by associating with the IKKβ, IKBα and p50 subunits
  at the Golgi and restricting pathway activation
