caption: 'Nitric oxide metabolism in erythrocytes under aerobic and hypoxic conditions.
  In aerobic conditions, OxyHb reacts with NO, forming metHb and NO3−-metabolic end
  products. However, in a hypoxic environment, RBCs become a NO producer. L-arginine
  is transported through the RBCs membrane by y+ and yL. Subsequently, it is incorporated
  into NOS or the arginase pathway, depending on the redox RBCs status. NO reacts
  with deoxyHb and further undergoes S-nitrosylation, forming HbSNO. NO is finally
  transmitted to GSH, PDI, or cysteine and, as a steady intermediate, leaves the RBCs.
  Alternatively, NO2− is reduced by XOR or deoxyHb and turned into another NO source.
  Abbreviations: GSH: glutathione; GS-NO: S-nitrosoglutathione; HbSNO: S-nitroso hemoglobin;
  LAT 1: L-neutral amino acid transporter 1; L-SNC: S-nitroso-L-cysteine; SNO-PDI:
  S-nitrosylated protein disulphide isomerase; PDI: protein disulphide isomerase;
  XOR: xanthine oxidoreductase.'
