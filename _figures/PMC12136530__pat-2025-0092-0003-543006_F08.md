caption: Proposed mechanism by which arginine inhibits tumor growth. Summary of the
  relationships between arginine, urea cycle, and pyrimidine synthesis pathways inferred
  from the results of this study. Carbamoyl phosphate is necessary for the urea cycle
  and pyrimidine synthesis pathways. Therefore, the consumption of carbamoyl phosphate
  during arginine metabolism through the urea cycle may reduce carbamoyl aspartic
  acid in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, thereby adversely affecting pyrimidine
  synthesis. ARG, arginase; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS1, argininosuccinate
  synthetase 1; ATC, aspartate carbamoyltransferase; CAD, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase
  2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase; Carbamoyl-Asp, carbamoyl aspartic
  acid; Carbamoyl-P, carbamoyl phosphate; CPS, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase; DHO,
  dihydroorotase; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; ORNT1, ornithine transporter
  1; OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase
