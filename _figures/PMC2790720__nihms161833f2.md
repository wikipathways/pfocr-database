caption: Myeloma cells are addicted to IRF4 expression such that even a modest decrease
  in IRF4 levels leads to cell death. IRF4 (green) controls an aberrant gene expression
  program in MM cells that fuses and expands the gene expression programs of activated
  B cells and PCs and directly controls the expression genes critical for cell cycle
  control, transcriptional regulation, plasma cell differentiation, and membrane biogenesis.
  There are several points at which IRF4 activity might be interrupted in a therapeutically
  advantageous manner (X). X1, target the signals activating (star) IRF4 expression,
  such as NF-kB. X2, target the known regulators of IRF4 expression in MM, MYC and
  IRF4 itself. X3, target the ability of IRF4 to interact with a binding partner (blue),
  thereby preventing IRF4 binding to target DNA sequences. X4, target putative post-translational
  modifications of IRF4 that may alter its ability to bind DNA or activate transcription.
  X5, target critical pathways downstream of IRF4. For example, the isoprenoid/cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathway can be targeted by drugs such as statins or farnesylation inhibitors.
  Any reduction in IRF4 activity will result in cell ‘death by a thousand cuts’ due
  to metabolic collapse following the downregulation of several key pathways.
