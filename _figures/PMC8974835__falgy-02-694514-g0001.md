caption: IL-17 signaling pathway. Th0 cells are differentiated into Th17 cells by
  stimulation with TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-21. Th17 cells are matured and maintained by
  IL-23. IL-23 also triggers Th17 to secrete IL-17. In the canonical pathway, upon
  binding to the IL-17R, IL-17 recruits Act1 to the receptor via interaction with
  SEFIR. Act1 further recruits several TRAFs needed for IL-17 transcriptional and
  posttranscriptional regulation. The inclusion of TRAF6 activates the NF-κB, C/EBPβ,
  C/EBPδ, and MAPK pathways, which then activate gene transcription (transcription
  phase). Activation of NF-κB was also carried out via JAK2 activation. Recruitment
  of the TRAF2-TRAF5 resulting in mRNA stabilization by stimulating mRNA stabilizing
  factors and/or by inhibiting mRNA destabilizing factors, thereby maintaining the
  translation of target genes (posttranscription phase). In the noncanonical pathway,
  the IL-17 complex functionally interacts with EGFR, FGF2, NOTCH1, and C-type lectin
  component resulting in enhanced molecular signaling in different cell types. The
  downstream effects of IL-17 signaling are mainly via the secretion of cytokines
  which then affect inflammatory cells such as neutrophil and structural cells, e.g.
  epithelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and fibroblast. IL-17, interleukin 17; IL-17R,
