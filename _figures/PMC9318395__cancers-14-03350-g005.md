caption: Syndecan–syntenin–ALIX couples to ESCRT-dependent MVB formation in healthy
  versus cancer cells. Syntenin-1 interacts directly with syndecans and ALIX, the
  interaction of ALIX with Snf7 of the ESCRT-III complex forms the syndecan–syntenin–ALIX
  pathway which is directly linked to exosome biogenesis. In cancer, several proteins
  in this pathway are altered, leading to enhanced exosome production. Alterations
  leading to the upregulation of either the syndecans, ALIX, and/or CD90 all result
  in enhanced exosome production, whereas any alterations leading to the downregulation
  of the ESCRT-III protein Vsp4 A/B and/or CD63 results in the increased production
  of exosomes seen in cancer cells.
