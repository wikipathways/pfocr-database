caption: 'In vitro cascade for production of GA. Four different methods of synthesizing
  GA in vitro are represented by different colored text and arrows [, –]. a Pink text
  indicates the GA synthesis route starting from sucrose. Sucrose is converted to
  G1P by SP, and then GA is produced by the action of five enzymes—PGM, IPS, IMP,
  MIOX, and Udh. Orange text represents the in vitro synthesis route of GA starting
  from glucurononxylan hemicellulose. Blue text represents a novel synthesis route
  of GA starting from glucurononxylan hemicellulose. b Black text represents the in
  vitro synthesis route of GA starting from G1P. The reaction was divided into two
  parts: high-temperature and low-temperature systems. The enzymes related to the
  GA pathway were connected to zeolite via a peptide linker. AG glucuronidase, AxyAgu115A
