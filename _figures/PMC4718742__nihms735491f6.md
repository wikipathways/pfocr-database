caption: (i) Integrin activation elicits paxillin/p130CAS phosphorylation by tyrosine
  kinases (TK), and, as a result, Crk proteins are recruited. (ii) Abl-induced phosphorylation
  of CrkII forces its dissociation from paxillin/p130CAS and thus results in signaling
  suppression. (iii) Binding of CypA to Pro220 sterically inhibits CrkII Tyr221 phosphorylation
  and CrkII remains in the active form. (iv) GEFs (for example, DOCK180 and C3G) associate
  with CrkII via its SH3N domain, giving rise to efficient localized activation of
  small GTPases at the membrane. (v) CrkI is a short alternatively spliced form of
  Crk that lacks the phosphorylation site and thus forms the active state constitutively.
