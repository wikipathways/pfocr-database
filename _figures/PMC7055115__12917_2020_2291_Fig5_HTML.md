caption: The model that β-catenin inhibits BPIV3 infection via innate immunity pathway
  (a) The inactivated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. β-catenin is constantly phosphorylated
  by GSK3β, and its phosphorylations constitute a signal for β-catenin ploybiquitination
  and hydrolysis by proteasome. b The proposed antiviral response of the β-catenin
  pathway. On the one hand, BPIV3 infection would up-regulate GSK3β to facilitate
  the degradation of β-catenin. On the other hand, the treatment of LiCl would inhibit
  GSK3β to prevent β-catenin degradation, and accumulated β-catenin could enter the
  nucleus to up-regulate expression of IFN-β, which then instigates transcription
  of downstream ISGs, and ISGs could inhibit the proliferation of the BPIV3
