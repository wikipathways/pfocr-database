caption: An overview of multiple signaling pathways deregulated by HBV and their potential
  mechanisms. Dotted lines indicate an unknown mechanism. Binding of Wnt3 to Frizzled-7
  receptor activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling through β-catenin accumulation and enhanced
  TCF-mediated transcription (). HBV infection increases phosphorylation of c-Src
  kinase, causing an increase in HBV transcription and replication and disassembly
  of adherens junctions. The disassembly of adherens junctions, made of E-Cadherin
  bound to β-catenin, results in increased levels of intracellular E-Cadherin and
  β-catenin leading to EMT and increased TCF/LEF dependent β-catenin signaling ().
  Association of β-catenin with the scaffolding protein APC is required for its degradation
  by the APC/Axin/GSK3β complex. HBx protein competitively binds to APC, preventing
  its association with β-catenin, leading to increased β-catenin stabilization ().
  Increased stabilization of β-catenin leads to an increase in levels of its downstream
  effectors like c-MYC and a decrease in E-cadherin expression (Not shown in illustration).
  HBx also transcriptionally regulates MYH9 through β-catenin signaling and interacts
  with Non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) to facilitate ubiquitin mediated GSK3β
  degradation, thus stabilizing β-catenin (). HBx also enhances MAPK/ERK pathway by
  activating Ras-GTP complex formation (). The transcription factor AP1 is activated
  through this pathway (). HBx induces phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB
  inhibitor, IκBα and a decrease in levels of the p52 precursor, p105 (). The precore
  protein p22 also activates Wnt signaling potentially both in the nucleus and the
  cytoplasm (). Created with Biorender.com.
