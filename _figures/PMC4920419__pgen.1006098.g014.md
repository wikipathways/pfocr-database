caption: 'Enhanced intracellular nitrative stress increases the protein nitration
  level and influences yeast growth and aggregation. The nitration of tyrosine residues
  acts as trigger for αSyn and A30P toxicity. Wild-type αSyn, which is highly nitrated,
  inhibits growth and shows a high aggregation rate. A30P is weakly nitrated and therefore,
  does not inhibit yeast growth and has a low aggregation propensity. Yhb1 and its
  human homolog NGB protect the cells against accumulation of nitrative species and
  diminish the aggregate formation. Di-tyrosine crosslinked dimers are formed in reverse
  correlation to cytotoxicity and do not depend on Yhb1. A30P forms twice as many
  dimers as the toxic αSyn variant, suggesting that the di-tyrosine crosslinked dimers
  are not toxic species and are presumably part of a cellular detoxification pathway,
  sequestering the protein off-pathway of αSyn nucleation. The C-terminal tyrosine
  modifications have dual effect on the toxicity of the protein. Y133, which is nitrated
  and phosphorylated, is required for the protective phosphorylation at S129 and for
  the autophagy degradation of αSyn aggregates. Non-modified Y133 promotes the proteasomal
  degradation of αSyn aggregates. N: nitration; P: phosphorylation.'
