caption: In M. tuberculosis, the FAS-II pathway elongates the C18+ acyl-CoAs from
  the type I pathway to C54-C56 fatty acids. The pathway is primed by the CoA-dependent
  β-ketoacyl-AcpM synthase FabH, which condenses the acyl-CoA with malonyl-AcpM to
  generate a β-ketoacyl-AcpM. The β-ketoacyl-AcpM is converted into a saturated enoyl-AcpM
  by the sequential actions of a β-ketoacyl-AcpM reductase (MabA), a dehydrase and
  a trans-2-enoyl-AcpM reductase (InhA). Subsequent rounds of elongation are initiated
  by either the KasA or KasB β-ketoacyl-AcpM synthases. KasA is thought to be responsible
  for the early rounds of fatty acid elongation, while KasB may be involved in later
  steps of mycolic acid biosynthesis (). Also shown is the malonyl-CoA AcpM transacylase
  (FabD) responsible for the synthesis of malonyl-AcpM.
