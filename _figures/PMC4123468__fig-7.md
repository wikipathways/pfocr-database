caption: TNF-α signaling in hepatocytes. After TNF-α binding to TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2,
  and RIP1 are assembled at the cytosolic domain of TNFR1 to form complex 1 (top center).
  Complex 1 subsequently initiates two branches of the trinomial death signaling cascade
  via the phosphorylation of JNK (pathway A) as well as the accumulation of ceramide
  and the subsequent increase in GGD3 synthesis (pathway B). Both routes increase
  mitochondrial O2•− formation (bottom panel), although the exact mechanism of JNK-mediated
  O2•− formation remains elusive (dashed line). The formation of derivative ROS/RNS
  from O2•− and corollary activation of cytochrome c peroxidase activity subsequently
  leads to the dissociation of cytochrome c from the IMM (bottom panel), a prerequisite
  for apoptosis. In addition, sustained JNK-dependent ROS/RNS formation leads to MPT
  and necrosis. Simultaneously, complex 1 triggers survival signaling via activation
  of the IKK complex (pathway D, top right), which phosphorylates IκB-α. This enables
  the dissociation of IκB-α from NF-κB and its translocation to the nucleus to initiate
  the transcription of anti-apoptotic and antioxidative genes. At a later time point,
  TRADD and RIP1 dissociate from complex 1 and associate with FADD, procaspase 8,
  and RIP3 to form complex 2 (upper left corner). Complex 2 mediates the third branch
  of the death signaling cascade (pathway C) by activating caspase 8, which subsequently
  truncates Bid into tBid. Thereafter, tBid induces permeabilization of the OMM via
  the accumulation of Bax and Bak, which enables the release of cytochrome c into
  the cytosol (bottom panel and top left) and consequent induction of apoptosis. When
  caspase 8 is inhibited as a result of oxidation, the RIP1/RIP3 complex (top left)
  fuels mitochondrial ROS/RNS production via upregulation of the TCA cycle and inhibition
  of the ANT in the IMM (bottom panel), which eventually leads to MPT and necrosis.
