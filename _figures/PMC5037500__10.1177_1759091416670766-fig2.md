caption: Model of a glutamatergic synapse and the molecular circadian clockwork. In
  the presynaptic neuron, glutamine (Gln) is converted to glutamate (Glu) by Glutaminase
  and packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT).
  After its release into the extracellular space, Glu binds to ionotropic glutamate
  receptors (NMDAR and AMPAR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the
  membranes of postsynaptic neuron and glia cells. Later, Glu is cleared from the
  synaptic space through excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) on neighboring
  glia cells (GLAST); this Glu uptake leads to Na+ influx, which activates the Na+/Ca2+
  exchanger, increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels. Within the glia cell, Glu is converted
  to Gln by Glutamine synthetase and the Gln is subsequently released by system N
  sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporters (SNAT3/5) and taken up by neurons
  through system A transporters (SNAT1/2) to complete the Glu-Gln cycle. Interestingly,
  Glu plays an important role in circadian rhythms since they express molecular oscillators.
  Glu activates NMDAR-induced Ca2+ influx, which together with other second messengers
  triggers the activation of diverse signal transduction cascades, including calmodulin
  kinase II (CaMKII) activity and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Although the
  cross talk between these diverse cascades is not currently well known, it is plausible
  that a common mechanism involved in this pathway is the phosphorylation of the cAMP
  response element binding protein (CREB). In turn, pCREB activates Per1 and Per2
  transcription (these genes are also activated by CLOCK/BMAL1 binding to E-box).
  Circadian transcription factors also regulate the expression of numerous proteins,
  molecules, and second messengers, including GLAST, GFAP, ATP, and Ca2+. Solid lines
  represent mechanisms that have been described experimentally, and dashed lines indicate
  possible additional links of this pathway. AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoaxazolepropionate
