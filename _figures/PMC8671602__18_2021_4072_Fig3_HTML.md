caption: DExD/H-box helicases regulate the DNA and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
  cGAS, DDX41, and IFIT16 are cytosolic DNA sensors that activate the ER-resident
  adaptor STING, which subsequently translocates to Golgi, resulting in TBK1/IRF3
  and NF-κΒ signaling and the production of IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines. IFN-I
  binds to their cognate receptor IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and triggers the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway. The green/T-shaped arrow indicates the interaction between DExD/H-box helicases
  and adaptors and promotes/inhibits signaling. IFI16, Interferon Gamma Inducible
  Protein 16; cGAS, Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase; STING, Stimulator of interferon genes;
  IFNAR, interferon-α/β receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  P, phosphate; ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element; ISGs, interferon-stimulated
  genes; RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)
