caption: A Tumor-associated NF1-mutant sensory neurons have increased baseline neuron
  excitability and deregulated HCN channel function, leading to elevated COL1A2 secretion.
  COL1A2, in turn, increases NF1−/− Schwann cell proliferation to stimulate pNF growth.
  B Tumor-associated NF1-mutant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) activity is governed by
  two distinct mechanisms. First, visual experience (light)-induced activity enhances
  RGC production of soluble-Nlgn3 (s-Nlgn3), which drives OPG initiation and cell
  growth. Second, tumor-associated NF1-mutant RGCs have increased intrinsic baseline
  neuronal hyperexcitability, which is controlled by HCN channel function. Increased
  baseline HCN channel-regulated RGC excitability triggers increased midkine production
  to induce a T-cell (Ccl4) and microglial (Ccl5) signaling cascade that governs OPG
  progression and growth. PNS, peripheral nervous system, CNS, central nervous system,
  pNF, plexiform neurofibroma, OPG, optic pathway glioma. Small elements of this schematic
