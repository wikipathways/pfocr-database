caption: Interaction between PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways mediates diverse
  cellular effects through downstream messengers. (A) PI3K/Akt pathway (left) is activated
  by binding of insulin or growth factors to the PI3K receptor. Activation of PI3K
  in turn activates AKT, eliciting a broad range of downstream signaling events. The
  canonical WNT pathway (right) is activated by the binding of WNT ligand to the Frizzled
  receptor, activating Disheveled and disrupting the GSK3β/Axin complex, stabilizing
  β-catenin which is then able to translocate to the nucleus and activate WNT target
  genes. These pathways converge both at the GSK3β node and at the level of β-catenin
  nuclear translocation. Additional points of interaction are possible as well. (B)
  In inflammatory bowel disease, the progression from inflammation to carcinoma progresses
  through a number of steps. Immune modulators (red) suppress inflammation and proliferation
  directly. PI3K and AKT inhibitors inhibit the growth of carcinomas. In this study,
  the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was shown to inhibit inflammation and progression to
  dysplasia. Other PI3K and AKT inhibitors may also be useful in preventing inflammation
  and progression to dysplasia and carcinoma.
