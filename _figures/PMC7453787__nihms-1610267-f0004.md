caption: During inflammation, interleukin (IL)-6 binds to its receptor to activate
  Janus Kinases (JAK)2, which induces the dimerization and phosphorylation of the
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3. Phosphorylated STAT3 translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to a STAT3 response element (SRE) to upregulate hepcidin
  transcription. An intact BMP-SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway is necessary for optimal
  hepcidin induction by inflammation by controlling basal hepcidin expression. Activin
  B is also generated during inflammation. In hepatocyte cell cultures, Activin B
  can utilize Activin type II receptors (ACVR2A and ACVR2B) and BMP type I receptors
  (ALK3 and ALK2) to activate SMAD1/5/8 signaling and induce hepcidin production,
  although a study in Inhbb−/− knockout mice (which lack Activin B) did not support
  a role for Activin B in hepcidin regulation by inflammation in vivo.
