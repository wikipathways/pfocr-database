caption: 'Summary of TXNIP regulation and functions. Several factors, such as glucose,
  glucocorticoids, metals, and aging, are known to regulate the expression of TXNIP.
  In contrast, TXNIP induces the emergence of oxidative stress, leading to the release
  of a large amount of ROS and amplifying the body’s oxidative stress response. However,
  owing to changes in the expression of TXNIP, three main effects can be noted: (1)
  The formation and function of the TXNIP–TRX complex. (2) TXNIP functions as a potential
  binding partner of NLRP3. TXNIP dissociates from TRX and binds to NLRP3, resulting
  in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway under ROS. Thus, caspase-1 is activated
  and promotes the maturation and release of the inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-18,
  which eventually leads to cellular inflammation. (3) The mechanism by which TXNIP
  and NLRP3 form a complex to induce the pyroptosis-related factor Gasdermin D remains
  to be determined. Changes in these three mechanisms are the possible underlying
  mechanisms of TXNIP causing the abnormal metabolism of bone cells, mainly osteoblasts,
  osteoclasts, and chondrocytes, ultimately leading to bone metabolism disorders.'
