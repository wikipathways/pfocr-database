caption: Certain leukemia cells take up elevated levels of glucose, leading to increased
  flux through glycolysis and into the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen synthesis,
  nucleotide biosynthesis and the TCA cycle. We hypothesize that increased flux into
  these pathways leads to the production of he rate-limiting substrates necessary
  for glycosphingolipid formation, namely, fatty acyl CoA, UDP-glucose, and NADPH.
  Inhibitors used in the present study are shown in red and enzymes overexpressed
  in the FL5.12 cell line are highlighted in yellow.
