caption: Schematic of proposed function and mechanism of ppGalNAc-T4 in breast cancer
  progression. Loss of ppGalNAc-T4 results in the decrease O-GalNAcylation of TβR
  Ⅰ and R Ⅱ, which promotes the dimerization of them and activates TGF-β signaling
  pathway. These events facilitate the transformation of the epithelial phenotypes
  toward mesenchymal features, with increased migration and invasion abilities in
  human breast cancer cells. ppGalNAc-T4 catalyzes TGF-β receptors O-GalNAc modification
  regulating breast carcinoma cells metastasis potential via EMT process.
