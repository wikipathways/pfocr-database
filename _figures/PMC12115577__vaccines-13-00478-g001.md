caption: The mechanism by which EBV promotes the occurrence and development of nasopharyngeal
  carcinoma. (I) EBV can directly infect epithelial cells; the envelope proteins gH/gL
  and gB of EBV play a critical role in the process. For example, gH and gL can form
  heterodimers and bind to integrins αVβ5, αVβ6, or αVβ8 on the epithelial cell surface
  in the early stage [72,74]. And EphA2 is also a key receptor for EBV to invade epithelial
  cells [82]. NRP1 is an important molecule for EBV to enter nasopharyngeal epithelial
  cells. NRP1 can interact with the CendR special domain of EBV glycoprotein gB, enabling
  EBV to enter nasopharyngeal epithelial cells through macrocytic and lipid raff-dependent
  endocytosis mechanisms and activating the NrP1-dependent EGFR-ERK signaling pathway.
  The activation of the EGFR-ERK signaling pathway and the expression of NRP1 are
  two necessary factors for efficient EBV infection [69]. (II) EBV can efficiently
  transduce B cells to turn to immortalized lymphoblasts, and contact with epithelial
  cells to transfer viruses, and then induce NPC [83,84]. (III) EBNAs are a group
  of nuclear proteins encoded by EBV, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis
  of NPC. For example, EBNA1 can inhibit p53 and Rb, promote cell proliferation and
  genomic instability, and promote the proliferation and survival of tumor cells through
  various mechanisms [85,86,87,88].Arrow ↑ represents promotion and arrow ↓ represents
  inhibition. (IV) EBV infection can cause CpG upregulation, histone modification,
  change in proto-oncogene expression, leading to cell proliferation and apoptosis
  inhibition, and genome instability [89,90,91,92]. (V) The expression of LMP1 and
  LMP2A in EBV-infected cells downregulated MHC-I and reduced antigen presentation,
  leading to immune escape [93,94]. (VI) Environmental factors mainly include macro
  and micro aspects. Microscopic factors mainly form a favorable microenvironment
  for tumor growth through the interaction between viral proteins and host cytokines
  [95,96,97]. Macro factors mainly include environmental pollution, smoking, diet,
  formaldehyde, dust, heavy metal inhalation, etc. [98,99,100,101]
