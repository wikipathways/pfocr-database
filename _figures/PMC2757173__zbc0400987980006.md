caption: miR-331-3p blocks AR signaling via inhibition of ERBB-2 expression and AKT
  activity in prostate cancer cells. AR antagonists such as bicalutamide bind to the
  AR and prevent its activation and expression of AR target genes, such as PSA. Nevertheless,
  AR signaling may persist in prostate cancer cells despite AR blockade, in part via
  increased expression of the ERBB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent activation
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which causes AR phosphorylation and promotes expression
  of AR target genes. miR-331-3p directly targets the ERBB-2 mRNA 3′-UTR to regulate
  ERBB-2 protein expression, thereby reducing PI3K/AKT signaling and AR signaling.
  The combination of an AR antagonist (bicalutamide) and miR-331-3p effectively blocks
  AR signaling (PSA expression and PSA promoter activity) in LNCaP prostate cancer
  cells. (+) indicates activation step of pathway and (−) indicates inhibition of
  pathway component.
