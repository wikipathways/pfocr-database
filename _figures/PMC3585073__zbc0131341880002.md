caption: 'Informatics triage strategy. Two methods were undertaken to select a total
  of 100 genes of highest interest: ranking target genes of interest based on the
  maximum positive or negative -fold induction of ApoA-I secretion (n = 50) or curating
  genes of interest based on existence of genetic associations to HDL/ApoA-I levels
  in human, phenotype associations in knock-out mice, pathway associations and multiplicity
  of independent hits in a given pathway, literature text mining, and druggability.
  After collating the list of genes, additional literature-based research was conducted
  to determine which genes of interest were tractable from a drug development perspective
  (n = 59). Individual siRNAs to each gene of interest were tested for the ability
  to modulate ApoA-I protein, and 40 genes were confirmed as active. GWAS, genome-wide
  association study; MESH, medical subject headings; HuGE, human genome epidemiology.'
