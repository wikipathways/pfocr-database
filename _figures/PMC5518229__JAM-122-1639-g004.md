caption: Cytoscape visualization illustrates the metabolic pathways most differentially
  regulated between treatments. Cytoscape visualization of (a) lipid and (b) amino
  acid metabolic pathways that differ between LP and LP+RBE. For each metabolite,
  node diameter is proportional to the fold difference in LP+RBE compared to LP. Node
  colours indicate the direction of a metabolite's fold difference, where red indicates
  metabolites with a higher scaled abundance in LP+RBE (P < 0·05), blue indicates
  lower abundance in LP+RBE (P < 0·05), pink indicates trending higher in LP+RBE (0·05 < P < 0·10),
  and light blue indicates trending lower in LP+RBE (0·05 < P < 0·10). Black nodes
  indicate metabolites with fold differences that were not significantly altered between
  treatments. The pathway enrichment score is the number in the circles for each subclassification.
