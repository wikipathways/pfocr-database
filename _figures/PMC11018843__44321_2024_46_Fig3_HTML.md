caption: In PD, mitophagy dysfunction due to abnormal PINK1 or parkin expression results
  in mtDNA damage and leakage to the cytoplasm. Misfolded α-synuclein leads to cytosolic
  DNA accumulation by damaging mitochondria and directly binding with DNA. The response
  to cytosolic DNA in PD primarily involves activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and
  IFN-I production. However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether IFN-I is beneficial
  or detrimental to PD.
