caption: 'Positive feedback loop between EGFR and ER-α36.Notes: A positive feedback
  loop has been confirmed that EGFR signaling activates transcription of ER-α36 through
  an AP-1-binding site in the promoter region of ER-α36. In turn, ER-α36 is able to
  stabilize EGFR protein and mediate MAPK/ERK and Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathways. In the
  Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathway, Src functions as a switch by phosphorylation to enhance
  proliferation and malignant properties of cancer.Abbreviations: AP-1, activator
  protein 1; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ER-α36, estrogen receptor-alpha36;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5.'
