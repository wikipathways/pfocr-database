caption: (A) The original network diagram is adapted from Janes et al.  and was used
  as a starting point to construct the FL gates. Network species whose concentration
  was measured by Western blot in the data-compendium are notated with a blue square
  (“pS” for phospho-serine, “pY” for phospho-tyrosine specific antibodies, “clv” for
  the cleaved form, and “pro” for the uncleaved form). Brown circles mark data compendium
  proteins measured by kinase assay. (B) This diagram depicts the global FL model,
  comprised of the 11 local FL gates with time delay and “max” functions. The network
  topology of the model differs from that of the original diagram.
