caption: Interregulation of the PIKK family members DNA-PKcs and ATM and their downstream
  substrates in the DDR pathway activated following DSB induction by IR. The dotted
  arrow represents the regulation at the transcription level. The solid arrow indicates
  the kinase activity-dependent regulation at the post-translational level
