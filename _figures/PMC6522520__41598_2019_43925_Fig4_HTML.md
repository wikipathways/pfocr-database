caption: 'Schematic representation of Primary, Secondary and Antioxidant defence signalling
  during drought response in tea. (a) Primary metabolic pathways (Photosynthesis,
  Glycolysis and TCA cycle); (b) Secondary metabolic pathways (Flavonoid, Theanine
  and Caffeine biosynthetic pathway); (c) ROS detoxification. Boxes in green represent
  transcripts up-regulated in tolerant while red represents transcripts up-regulated
  in sensitive genotypes. (PAL: Phenylalanine ammonia lyase, C4H: Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase,
