caption: 'Mechanisms of primary resistance. (A) Tumors characterized by a high mutation
  burden usually exhibit a more favorable response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy because
  they are more likely to generate immunogenic neoantigens. These neoantigens activate
  CD8+ T cells and stimulate a robust antitumor immune response. (B) Tumor cells that
  have developed resistance to IFN-γ signaling due to primary JAK1/2 mutations may
  not induce PD-L1 upregulation but can still inhibit T-cell reactivity through PD-1/PD-L1-independent
  pathways. In addition, inactivation of IFN-γ signaling leads to reduced expression
  of CXCL9 and CXCL10, which are critical for T-cell recruitment. (C) Tumor cells
  with abnormal expression of antigen presentation pathway components fail to effectively
  present tumor antigens, thus hindering the elicitation of antitumor immunity required
  to eliminate cancer cells. (D) Within the TME, a diverse array of immunosuppressive
  cells can affect the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy by suppressing T-cell reactivity.
  Cytokines produced by tumors attract more immunosuppressive cells into the TME and
  promote their polarization toward a pro-tumor phenotype. (E) Alternative immune-checkpoint
  molecules are upregulated in T cells infiltrating the tumor. This upregulation,
  coupled with increased VEGFR signaling and TOX expression, exacerbates the activation
  of inhibitory signaling pathways. (F) Mutations in oncogenes and aberrant activation
  can thwart the development of an effective antitumor immune response, leading to
  primary resistance to immunotherapy. Abbreviations: CTL-4, T-lymphocyte-associated
