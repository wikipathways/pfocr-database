caption: Parkinson’s disease genes reveal an association of multiple variants that
  converge on deficiencies in cellular clearance. The emergence of several genes associated
  with Parkinson’s disease have highlighted essential cellular pathways key to pathogenesis.
  Genetic variants associated with idiopathic or familial Parkinson’s disease are
  listed above organized by their normal cellular pathway and function. Lysosomes
  are critical for the degradation of α-synuclein, and disruptive lysosomal gene variants
  are expected to enhance the formation of pathogenic α-synuclein oligomers and fibrils
  directly and indirectly through the interaction of lysosomal membrane lipids. Once
  formed, these aggregates actively disrupt trafficking and lysosomal clearance pathways,
  which permits their persistence in neurons and ultimately results in cellular self-destruction.
  Other Parkinson’s disease genes, such as LRRK2, can influence trafficking and autophagic-lysosomal
  function through phosphorylating Rab proteins. Parkinson’s disease genes that disrupt
  mitochondrial function can lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or dopamine-o-quinone
  (DAQ) that can damage lysosomal machinery, leading to α-synuclein aggregate formation.
  Black arrows indicate an inhibitory process and grey arrows indicate enhancement
  of potential pathogenic processes described in red text. GlcCer = glucosylceramide.
