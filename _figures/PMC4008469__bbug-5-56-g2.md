caption: Figure 2. Metabolic engineering of host cell metabolism for improved biotransformations.
  NADPH regeneration can be improved by forcing glucose catabolism to the oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by deletion of pgi, the gene for phosphoglucoisomerase
  (A) or by deletion of the genes for phosphofructokinase genes pfkA and pfkB resulting
  in partial cyclization of the PPP (B). Improved biotransformation capacity resulted
  from various gene deletions primarily encoding tricarboxylic acid enzymes (C).
