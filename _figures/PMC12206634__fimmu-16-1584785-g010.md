caption: Proposed model for the diverse intestinal innate immune pathway responses
  induced by non-S INDEL and S INDEL PEDV strain in weaned (A) and suckling (B) piglets.
  The intestinal transcription pattern in weaned piglets is similar for both PEDV
  strains, whereas in suckling piglets, it differs between the non-S INDEL and S INDEL
  strains. In weaned piglets (A), the PRRs involved in PEDV recognition include TLR3,
  TLR7/8, RIG-I/MDA5, and NLRP3. The primary APs involved in the recognition of PEDV
  infection through TLRs and RIG-I pathways are TRIM25/MAVS/IPS-1, TRAF6, and TBK1.
  These APs activate key TFs like IRFs and NF-κB, which drive the transcription of
  antiviral genes and proinflammatory cytokines. IFN I and III synthesis in response
  to PEDV infection is mainly controlled by IRF7, IRF1, and NF-κB, with minimal involvement
  from IRF3, a crucial early regulator of type I IFNs. As a result, numerous ISGs
  are overexpressed through the JAK-STAT/IRF9 signaling pathway, along with other
  key ISGs and proinflammatory regulators like STAT3 and SOCS1. The primary drivers
  of proinflammatory responses to PEDV are NF-κB, IRF5, and IL-1β-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, which also control the pyroptosis cell death pathway via CASP-1 overexpression.
  Key regulators of cell survival, including MAPKs and the transcription factor AP-1,
  are also overexpressed following PEDV infection. Most of these pathways are activated
  in infected enterocytes of suckling piglets (B) exposed to the non-S INDEL strain
  (black arrows), whereas they are suppressed in response to the S INDEL strain (red
  lines). Created with BioRender.com
