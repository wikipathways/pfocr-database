caption: Hh ligands are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells. The signals are received
  by various types of mesenchymal cells. In the absence of Hh ligands (A), the receptor
  Ptch localises in the primary cilium (PC) and inhibits Smo, a necessary receptor
  to deliver Hh signals, movement to the primary PC. Under such cases, Sufu restrains
  the full-length form of Glioma-associated oncogenes 2/3 (Gli2/3FL) in the cytosol,
  where they are partially phosphorylated and proteolyzed by a multiple protein kinase
  complex composed of PKA, GSK3β, and CK1α. This generates the repressor form, namely
  Gli2/3 repressor (Gli2/3 R), which translocates to the nucleus to bind to and inhibit
  the expression of Hh target genes. In the presence of Hh ligands (B), binding of
  Hh ligands to Ptch removes the inhibitory action of Ptch on Smo and drives the accumulation
  and activation of Smo in the PC, leading to subsequent inhibition of Sufu by Smo
  and the dissociation of Gli2/3FL. kinesin family member 7 (Kif7), a core regulator
  of mammalian Gli proteins, moves from the basal body to the tip of the PC in a Hh-dependent
  manner, assisting Smo accumulation in the PC. Gil2/3FL is then phosphorylated by
  serine/threonine protein kinases, including ULK3 and STK36, resulting in the formation
  of Gli2/3 activator (Gle2/3 A) and translocation into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus,
  Gli2/3 A upregulates the transcriptional targets of Hh signalling, including Ptch
  and another Hh-binding protein, Hhip. Gas1, Cdo, and Boc are co-receptors that promote
  Hh-Ptch binding. Arrows and blunt ends lines indicate activation and inhibition,
