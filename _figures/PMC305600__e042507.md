caption: Fig. 7. EGF and β–adrenergic receptors activate c–Src by different mechanisms
  that lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation of different sets of c–Src substrates.
  EGF receptors, but not β–adrenergic receptors (βAR), activate c–Src by a Ras- and
  Ral-dependent signaling pathway. Importantly, Ral-induced c–Src activation leads
  to Stat3 and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, but not Shc phosphorylation and
  Erk activation. In contrast, βAR activation of c–Src leads to Shc but not cortactin
  or Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Ral can also be activated by Ras-independent
  pathways, such as through calcium, which would allow c–Src to activate downstream
  targets without activating Ras and its multiple effectors. Overall, these findings
  suggest how different receptors may generate specific cellular effects through a
  common kinase.
