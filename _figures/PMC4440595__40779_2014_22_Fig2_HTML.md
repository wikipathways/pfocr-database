caption: The BMP/SMAD signaling pathway. In the pathway, the interaction of BMP6 dimers
  with their receptors leads to the activation of the receptor kinase, followed by
  the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 and the formation of the SMAD1/5/8-SMAD4 complex,
  which, when translocated to the nucleus, activates the promoters of the target genes
  and then regulates SMAD7 and ID1.
