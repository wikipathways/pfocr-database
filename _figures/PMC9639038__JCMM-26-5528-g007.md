caption: Graphical abstract of the RAW264.7 cells experiment. (Step 1) Histone H3
  was released into the extracellular environment when LPS was stimulated. (Step 2)
  Histone H3‐induced ferroptosis. (Step 3) Histone H3 antibody inhibited NOD2, and
  HDAC6 levels, the NF‐κB pathway and ferroptosis in LPS‐stimulated cells. (Step 4–1)
  The NOD2 agonist MDP aggravated t NOD2, and HDAC6 levels, the NF‐κB pathway and
  ferroptosis in histone H3‐treated cells. (Step 4–2) HDAC6‐siRNA reduced the expression
  of HDAC6, the NF‐κB pathway and ferroptosis, but had no effect on NOD2 in histone
  H3‐treated cells. (Step 4–3) MDP increased NOD2, HDAC6 levels, the NF‐κB pathway
  and ferroptosis in RAW264.7 cells administered histone H3 and HDAC6‐siRNA.
