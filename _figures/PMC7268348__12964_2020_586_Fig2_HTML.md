caption: Insulin and Growth Factors can trigger the phosphorylation of AKT via activation
  of the PI3KC1 pathway that provides the needed PIP3. Active AKT can then promote
  the translocation of GLUT1 onto the plasmamembrane to effect the uptake of glucose.
  PTEN can switch off the AKT pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3, through its lipid-phosphatase
  activity, and by directly interacting and dephosphorylating AKT at the Thr308 position,
  through its protein-phosphatase activity
