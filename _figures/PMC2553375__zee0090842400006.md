caption: 'Model for the postprandial response to salt ingestion in the rat, integrating
  previously reported information about UGn and proUGn with new results presented
  in this and a companion publication (). According to the model, ingesting salt triggers
  apical and basolateral secretion of proUGn from intestinal EC cells; note that a
  similar role might be played by ECL cells in the human stomach, where gastric expression
  of UGn is much higher than in the rat. Apically secreted proUGn is converted to
  UGn by proteases residing within the intestinal lumen. UGn then acts intraluminally
  to regulate epithelial electrolyte transport mechanisms. The net effect is to enhance
  the secretion of sodium and chloride into the lumen, and suppress sodium absorption
  from the lumen (blue arrows), thus delaying the delivery of salt to the body. In
  parallel, basolaterally secreted proUGn is delivered to the kidney where it is filtered
  and converted to smaller peptides and free amino acids by brush border proteases
  residing within the proximal tubule. Although not shown in the figure, it is also
  possible that some proUGn may be absorbed from the plasma by tubular epithelial
  cells, which convert it intracellularly to smaller peptides that are then secreted
  into the tubular lumen. Free amino acids are returned to the circulation, and one
  of the luminal peptides (very likely UGn, though possibly an alternate metabolite)
  acts within the nephron to regulate tubular electrolyte transport. Although the
  exact site of action is unclear, the net effect on the kidney is to decrease the
  reabsorption of filtered sodium (blue arrows), thereby accelerating the rate at
  which sodium is excreted from the body. Thus, this novel endocrine pathway can coordinate
  the activity of two principal organs involved in whole body electrolyte homeostasis:
  the intestine, where salt is absorbed, and the kidney, where salt is excreted. Complementary
  actions at these two sites are thought to buffer the rapid influx of sodium, and
  perhaps other electrolytes, that would otherwise accompany a salt-rich meal. The
  proUGn-based signaling pathway may also be activated in disease states that involve
  volume expansion, such as kidney failure and heart failure.'
