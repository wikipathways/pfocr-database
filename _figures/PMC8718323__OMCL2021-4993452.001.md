caption: A mechanism to explain the mitochondrial dysfunction in Chagas disease. NOX2
  is activated in T. cruzi-infected monocytes and macrophages, which can produce ROS.
  On the other hand, T. cruzi infection can induce an intracellular calcium flux (iCa2+),
  which in turn causes mitochondrial membrane permeability, respiratory complex malfunction,
  and electron leakage from the electron transport chain to oxygen, which results
  in increased mtROS production. Most likely, the iCa2+ is associated with changes
  in the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway, which can cause Ca2+
  release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. Both NOX2-produced
  ROS and mtROS can inhibit the activity of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α,
  a coactivator of NRF1, NRF2, and other transcription factors (TF) involved in mitochondrial
  biogenesis, OXPHOS, mtDNA replication, and transcription, altering the redox homeostasis
  of the mitochondria. Additionally, ROS could directly inhibit the activity of NRF1
  and NRF2, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction as well. +1 represents the transcription
  start site of the genes.
