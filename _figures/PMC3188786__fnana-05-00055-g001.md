caption: Altered striatal signaling pathways in HD. Afferent corticostriatal and nigro-striatal
  projections modulate striatal signaling, which is impaired in Huntington’s Disease
  (HD). Neurotrophic factor BDNF release from cortical afferences is decreased in
  cortico-striatal synapses as a consequence of Exp-HTT-mediated down-regulation of
  bdnf transcription and axonal transport in cortical neurons. A shift from synaptic
  to extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent signaling participates to striatal neurons to death.
  In a physiological condition, calcium influx through synaptic NMDAR promotes activation
  of the MAPkinase/ERK signaling pathway along with its nuclear target, the MSK-1
  protein, which phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB. MSK-1 activation promotes
  chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for CREB-mediated pgc-1α transcription, a
  key gene involved in mitochondria biogenesis. Synaptic NMDARs also promote formation
  of non-toxic Exp-HTT inclusion via TRIC. In HD, localization and activity of extrasynaptic
  NMDAR are enhanced by Exp-HTT, which promotes neuronal cell injury and death. The
  toxic effect of extrasynaptic NMDAR is partly due to (i) the upregulation of Rhes
  expression that disaggregates the non-toxic Exp-HTT inclusions (ii) to an impairment
  of mitochondrial functions and (iii) to a decrease of the ERK/MSK-1/CREB signaling
  module to the pgc-1α promoter. Dopamine release from nigro-striatal inputs promotes
  oxidative stress via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which potentiates
  activation of the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway induced by Exp-HTT. In addition, Dopamine
  potentiates Exp-HTT-mediated striatal neurons death through activation of the Rho/ROCK
  signaling pathway downstream D2R.
