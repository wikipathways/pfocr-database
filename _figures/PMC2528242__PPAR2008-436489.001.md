caption: 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and ligands: pathways and functions.
  PPARγ protein exhibits a structural organization consisting of three functional
  domains: an N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a carboxy-terminal
  ligand binding domain (LBD). PPARγ forms heterodimers with a second member of the
  nuclear receptor family, the retinoic X receptor (RXR). Unliganded PPARγ suppresses
  transcription (pathway A) either by interfering with key transcription factors (pathway
  A1) or through recruitment of corepressors (CoRep) on a PPRE element (pathway A2).
  Ligand binding to PPARγ (pathway B) triggers conformational changes that lead to
  dissociation of corepressors (CoRep) and subsequent association of coactivators
  (CoAct). The complex is binding to PPREs and triggers transcription (pathway B).
  PPARs ligands can also exert their action through PPARγ-independent mechanisms also
  (pathway C). For instance in NSCLC cell lines activation of TNF-TRAIL induce apoptosis,
  while PGE2 degradation, trough 15-hydroxyprostagladin dehydrogenase induction, results
  in enhanced epithelial differentiation. In endothelial cells PPARγ ligands can markedly
  boost expression of CD36 which functions as the receptor of endogenous antiangiogenic
  molecule thrombospondin-1, thereby potentiating the apoptotic response. (PFAs: polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, TZDs: thiazolidinediones, PPRE: peroxisome proliferator response element,
  TNF: tumor necrosis factor, TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, NSCLC:
  non-small cell lung carcinoma).'
