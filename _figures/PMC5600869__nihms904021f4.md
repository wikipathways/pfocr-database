caption: Active DNA demethylation pathway. Active DNA demethylation takes place through
  the enzymatic replacement of 5mC with cytosine via the base-excision DNA repair
  pathway (BER) pathway. Cytosine is methylated by Dnmt1, 3a, and 3b and the resulting
  5mC is oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by TET1 proteins. 5hmC is then
  deaminated by AID into 5-hydroxy uracil (5hmU). Finally, 5hmU can be excised by
  TDG and repaired by the BER pathway with unmethylated cytosines. Active DNA demethylation
  pathway is induced in the non-replicating cells.
