caption: Three pathways are posited that can lead to pathogenic conditions such as
  AD. In the familial AD (FAD) pathway, genotype results directly in AD. This pathway
  explains a minority of AD cases. In the sporadic (SAD) pathway, genotype or somatic
  genotype have minimal input (excluding cases of FAD), and it is direct, non–latent
  response to environmental insults (such as metal toxicity or head trauma) that lead
  to AD. In the LEARn AD (LAD) pathway, environment induces epigenetic marker shifts
  in critical gene sequences, resulting in potentially pathogenic, but latent, somatic
  epitype(s). These somatic epitypes would undergo “second hit” environmental effects
  that result in disease.
