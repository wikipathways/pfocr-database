caption: A synthesis pathway yielding an array of macrocyclic compounds. 12, 13 and
  14-membered macrocycles can be generated starting from simple, commercially available
  building blocks. Note that both enantiomers of the chiral oxazolidinone were used
  to construct macrocycles with the R1 building block in both stereochemical orientations
  in the solid and solution phase libraries. AML1 (5) was previously reported to bind
  purified ShhN based on small-molecule microarray (SMM) experiments verified with
  surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
