caption: 'Cancer-associated alterations of Ca2+ fluxes at acidic tumor microenvironment
  and targets. Tumor cells can harness multiple alterations of Ca2+ fluxes at the
  plasma membrane in support of tumor progression or resistance to treatment. The
  channels for calcium inflow include acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), transient
  receptor potential (TRP) channels, store operated calcium entry (SOCE), voltage-gated
  calcium channel (VGCC) and P2X receptors. These channels have been linked to proliferation,
  migration, inflammation, oxidative stress and superior resistance to drugs through
  various calcium related signaling pathways. (1) Ca2+ influx through ASIC activates
  AKT, NF-κB, and Ca2+/RhoA pathways to promote metastasis and produce inflammation
  and oxidative stress. (2) Activation of TRPV1 induces Ca2+ influx, which subsequently
  triggers ERK1/2, PI3K, NF-κB, and STAT3 signaling pathways to promote proliferation,
  migration, and inflammation. (3) TRPV4 and Ca2+ promote tumor metastasis through
  the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway. (4) TRPC1 mediates Ca2+ entry to activate MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways. TRPC5 overexpression activates CaMKII/AMPKA/mTOR as well as
  β-catenin nuclear translocation, ABCB1 expression and leads to chemotherapy resistance.
  (5) TRPP2/AMPK/PERK/eIF2α signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation. (6)
  VGCC may promote tumor cell proliferation through mTORC2/AKT pathway. (7) Ca2+ entry
  through SOCE activates PI3K/AKT/SgK1 to promote migration and leads to drug resistance
  through the CaN/NFAT pathway. (8) P2X stimulation enhances the PI3K/Akt pathway
  and NF-κB activity. Several targeting drugs involve the following channels: (1)
  Drugs targeting ASICs, TRP family members, SOCE, VGCC and P2X receptors; (2) Inhibitors
  targeting signaling pathways (i.e., PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-κB, P-GP, and CaMKII) [Ca2+]i:
