caption: 'The proposed model for the segregated, but functionally related, basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical
  and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. Normally, EG tasks are primarily processed
  through cerebellar-cortical circuitry, with the recruitment of the BG-cortical circuitry
  (Panel A), whereas IG tasks are primarily encoded in the BG-cortical pathway, with
  the recruitment of cerebellar-cortical circuitry (Panel B). In PD, EG tasks also
  are processed primarily via the cerebellar-cortical pathway, though with enhanced
  activity in this circuit, particularly in cerebellulm and PreMC areas (Panel C).
  IG tasks in PD, however, neither adequately activate the BG-cortical pathway (its
  primary processing center), nor cause adequate recruitment of the cerebellar-cortical
  pathway. As a result, both pathways display decreased activity (Panel D). Levodopa
  restores normal cerebellar-cortical activity during the EG task after adequate BG-cortical
  activation (Panel E, compare to Panel A). In the IG task, levodopa administration
  increases functional activity in both BG-cortical and cerebellar-cortical pathways,
  significantly “over-correcting” both circuits (Panel F). The thickness of the lines
  in each pathway reflects the level of activity within that circuit. Abbreviations
  are as follows: PMC: primary motor cortex; PreMC: lateral premotor area; SMA: Supplemental
  Motor Area; SMC; Sensorimotor Cortex; STN; Vla; Ventralis lateralis anterior thalamus;
  VLp: Ventralis lateralis posterior thalamus, also know as ventralis intermedius
  (Vim).'
