caption: 'A schematic representation of RXRα phosphorylation in HCC cells. In normal
  hepatocytes, when the ligand (retinoid) binds to and activates RXRα, the receptor
  becomes able to heterodimerize with other nuclear receptors, including RAR, and
  then activates the expression of the target genes, which may regulate normal cell
  proliferation and differentiation, by binding to the specific responsive element.  In
  HCC cells, the Ras/MAPK pathway is highly activated and phosphorylates RXRα at serine
  residues, thus impairing the functions of the receptor. Therefore, the accumulated
  p-RXRα interferes with the remaining normal RXRα, presumably, in a dominant negative
  manner, thereby playing a critical role in the development of HCC.  L: ligand. Ub:
  ubiquitin.'
