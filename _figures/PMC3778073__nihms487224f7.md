caption: In tumor epithelial cells, glucocorticoids are converted to inactive 11-keto-forms,
  reducing glucocorticoid receptor activity, while 11ßHSD2 deletion leads to increased
  levels of epithelial intracellular active glucocorticoid. The subsequent inhibition
  of the COX-2 pathway and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest through activation of
  retinoblastoma protein (Rb, a tumor suppressor) due to induction of p53 and p21
  and inhibition of the mTOR pathway due to induction of REDD1 lead to inhibition
  of colorectal tumorigenesis.
