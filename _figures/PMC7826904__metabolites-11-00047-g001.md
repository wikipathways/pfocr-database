caption: 'Schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway leading to aliphatic
  glucosinolates, indole glucosinolates and their respective hydrolysis products in
  Arabidopsis thaliana root. Arrows between compounds represent the major enzymes
  (in red font) involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are
  characterized by having a common core structure containing a β-d-glucopyranose residue
  (orange background) linked to a sulfated thiohydroximate (green background) with
  a variable side chain R group (blue background). Side-chain elongation of the precursor
  amino acid methionine (one to six methylene groups are sequentially inserted into
  the methionine side chain) is shown on a dark pink background. Glucosinolate side-chain
  modification is shown on a grey background. Glucosinolates are released from the
  vacuole and brought into contact with endogenous thioglucosidases called myrosinases
  such as Penetration2 (PEN2) or β-thioglucoside glucohydrolases (TGG) that mediate
  the degradation of glucosinolates to a variety of products, including isothiocyanates,
  thiocyanates, nitriles, and epithionitriles (yellow background). Abbreviations for
  intact glucosinolates and full names: 3mtp, 3-methylthiopropyl glucosinolate; 3msp,
