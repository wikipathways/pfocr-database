caption: Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.Schematic representation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
  pathway. Ligand binding, typically by growth factors, activates receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of the receptors.
  This event initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling, involving RAS activation,
  recruitment of RAF to the plasma membrane, and phosphorylation of MEK (Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase/ERK Kinase). Subsequently, ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase)
  is activated and translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression
  associated with crucial cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation,
  and survival. The pathway is tightly regulated, and dysregulation can contribute
  to various diseases, particularly cancer
