caption: (A) PE biosynthetic pathway. Sequential acylations by PlsB and PlsC lead
  to the formation of PA. Subsequently, the CMP moiety is attached by CdsA to form
  CDP-DG. PssA then catalyzes the replacement of the head group with serine to generate
  PS, which is lastly decarboxylated by PSD to yield PE. (B) The catalytic mechanism
  of EcPssA follows a ping-pong reaction, where an initial nucleophilic attack by
  a histidine residue on the substrate leads to the formation of a covalent phosphatidyl-enzyme
  intermediate. This intermediate is then subsequently substituted by serine, resulting
  in the production of PS. G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid;
  PA, phosphatidic acid; CDP-DG, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol; CMP, cytidine
  monophosphate; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine
