caption: Schematic action model of rutaecarpine which exert caloric restrict acting
  on cell metabolism at multiple levels and reduce energy-consuming processes in vivo
  and in vitro. Both AMPK-ACC2 and IRS-1-PI3K-Akt pathway participate regulatory pathway
  stimulated by rutaecarpine. The inhibitory effect on broad range of inflammatory
  cytokines may further suggest the multi-targets of rutaecarpine. The arrows indicate
  the potential targets of rutaecarpine. However, their role in the mechanism still
  need validation.
