caption: Model for the role of Mph1 in the maintenance of genome stability. DNA lesions
  arise spontaneously during DNA replication and are bypassed by an error-free, Mph1-mediated,
  noncrossover pathway of homologous recombination (HR). Mph1 may unwind the leading
  strand from its template, suggested to resemble a D loop (), followed by Rad51/52-mediated
  chicken-foot formation (A) and then resolution by reverse branch migration. A D-loop
  structure could also form when the leading strand switches template (B), and Mph1
  could dissolve this D loop by reverse branch migration. In the absence of Mph1,
  lesions are bypassed by error-prone, Rev3-mediated TLS or they are channeled by
  Srs2 into alternative bypass pathways that can result in GCRs. If TLS is disrupted
  in the mph1Δ mutant, point mutations from TLS are avoided, but GCRs arise as a consequence
  of aberrant repair, most likely nonallelic HR. In the absence of both Mph1 and Srs2,
  cells accumulate at G2/M and lose viability due to Rad51-mediated accumulation of
  dHJs and Mec3-mediated checkpoint activation. In the absence of the checkpoint,
  cells continue through the cell cycle in the presence of DNA lesions. The dotted
  line emerging from Srs2 indicates that Srs2 tightly regulates the levels of dHJ
  formation at paused replication forks by inhibiting Rad51-mediated strand invasion.

  description: Model for the role of Mph1 in the maintenance of genome stability.
    DNA lesions arise spontaneously during DNA replication and are bypassed by an
    error-free, Mph1-mediated, noncrossover pathway of homologous recombination (HR).
    Mph1 may unwind the leading strand from its template, suggested to resemble a
    D loop (), followed by Rad51/52-mediated chicken-foot formation (A) and then resolution
    by reverse branch migration. A D-loop structure could also form when the leading
    strand switches template (B), and Mph1 could dissolve this D loop by reverse branch
    migration. In the absence of Mph1, lesions are bypassed by error-prone, Rev3-mediated
    TLS or they are channeled by Srs2 into alternative bypass pathways that can result
    in GCRs. If TLS is disrupted in the mph1Δ mutant, point mutations from TLS are
    avoided, but GCRs arise as a consequence of aberrant repair, most likely nonallelic
    HR. In the absence of both Mph1 and Srs2, cells accumulate at G2/M and lose viability
    due to Rad51-mediated accumulation of dHJs and Mec3-mediated checkpoint activation.
    In the absence of the checkpoint, cells continue through the cell cycle in the
    presence of DNA lesions. The dotted line emerging from Srs2 indicates that Srs2
    tightly regulates the levels of dHJ formation at paused replication forks by inhibiting
    Rad51-mediated strand invasion.
