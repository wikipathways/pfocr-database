caption: Schematic of the neural pathways involved in eyeblink conditioning. A simplified
  diagram of the minimal circuitry necessary for eyeblink conditioning (EBC). The
  tone-conditioned stimulus (CS) pathway is shown in blue. The air puff (AP) unconditioned
  stimulus (US) pathway is shown in red. The unconditioned response (UR) and conditioned
  response (CR) pathways are shown in black. Arrows indicate direction of inputs and
  outputs. Auditory information from the tone-CS is conveyed to the cochlear nucleus
  (CN) which in turn send projections to the pontine nuclei (PN) and medial auditory
  thalamic nuclei (MATN). The medial auditory thalamic nuclei project to PN neurons
  that give rise to mossy fibers (MF) that contact neurons in the anterior interpositus
  nucleus (AIN) of the deep cerebellar nuclei and granule cells (GC) in the cerebellar
  cortex. The axons of GCs form parallel fibers (PF) that contact Purkinje cells (PC)
  as well as inhibitory interneurons (not shown). Sensory information from the air
  puff-US is conveyed to the trigeminal nucleus (5 N) which in turn sends projections
  to the inferior olive (IO). Neurons of the IO give rise to climbing fibers (CF)
  which contact neurons in the AIN and PCs. Information from the tone-CS and air puff-US
  converged in AIN neurons and PCs. In addition, PCs convey information processed
  in the cerebellar cortex (interneurons are omitted for simplicity) to their target
  nuclear neurons in the AIN which are the final output from the cerebellum. The CR
  is executed by AIN neurons that project to the red nucleus (RN) which in turn activates
  motor neurons in the facial nucleus (7 N) and other brain stem nuclei that together
  elicit an eyeblink CR. Modified from (). (For interpretation of the references to

  description: Schematic of the neural pathways involved in eyeblink conditioning.
    A simplified diagram of the minimal circuitry necessary for eyeblink conditioning
    (EBC). The tone-conditioned stimulus (CS) pathway is shown in blue. The air puff
    (AP) unconditioned stimulus (US) pathway is shown in red. The unconditioned response
