caption: (a) The cellular response of Zn ions to surrounding bone environment, including
  that Zn promotes osteoblast cell development, proliferation, and mineralization;
  Zn prevents osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting the development of osteoclast-like
  cells induced by various bone-resorbing agents. The function of Zn in promoting
  bone formation is to increase protein synthesis in the translational phase by inducing
  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in osteoblastic cells. Reproduced with permission from
  Ref. [140]. Copyright 2009, Springer. (b) Zn2+ enters hBMSCs via two cell receptors,
  TRPM9 and GPR39, then activates cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and triggers intracellular
  Ca2+ response. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [141]. Copyright 2017, American
  Chemical Society. (c) Zn contributes to the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)
  signaling pathway in osteoblasts. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [141]. Copyright
