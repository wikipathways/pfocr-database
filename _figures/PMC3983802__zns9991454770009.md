caption: Schematic diagram of CWC spine signaling pathways. Glutamate activates AMPARs
  and NMDARs producing an EPSP and Ca entry through NMDARs. Synaptic stimulation under
  control conditions also activates L-type Ca channels that contribute to BK channel
  gating, generating a hyperpolarizing current that suppresses both the EPSP and Ca
  transient. Activation of mAChRs reduces Ca entry through L-type channels through
  the PKA signaling pathway, thereby reducing BK activation and enhancing both the
  EPSP amplitude and Ca influx through NMDARs.
