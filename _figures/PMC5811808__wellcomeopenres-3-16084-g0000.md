caption: The labelling patterns arising from [1,2- 13C] glucose ( A & B) as well as
  from [U- 13C, 15N] glutamine ( C for 13C labelling and A– C for 15N labelling) are
  shown. Metabolism of [1,2- 13C] glucose leads to distinctive labelling patterns
  in lactate and alanine ([2,3- 13C] lactate/alanine when using glycolysis and [3-
  13C] lactate/alanine when using the pentose phosphate shunt, PPP) (Panel A). Similarly,
  glutamate and aspartate express different labelling patterns from [1,2- 13C] glucose,
  depending whether they were synthesised via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; resulting
  in [4,5- 13C] glutamate) or via the pyruvate carboxylase (PC; resulting in [2,3-
  13C] aspartate) route (Panel B). Metabolisation of labelled glutamine can reveal
  other anaplerotic pathway activities such as reductive carboxylation (Panel C).
