caption: Potential allosteric inhibition of Aurora-A kinase by the vNAR-D01 intrabody.
  Aurora-A is a Ser/Thr protein kinase primarily involved in cell division and has
  been proven relevant for proliferation in glioblastoma. Moreover, Aurora-A induces
  tumorigenesis via the decontrolled regulation of RAD51 [128]. BCRA1, catenin, p73,
  MDM2, NFκB, cMyc, ERK, AKT, and JAK/STAT pathways [130], followed by downstream
  upregulation of several targets that prompt GBM cell proliferation, survival, inflammation,
  and angiogenesis. AURKA autophosphorylation is inefficient and relies on TPX2 binding.
  vNAR-D01 binding superposes to recognition sites of TPX2, further impeding AURKA
  kinase activity via an allosteric mechanism. Because the vNAR-D01 binding superposes
  to recognition sites of TPX2, the former impedes AURKA kinase activity via an allosteric
  mechanism. Green solid lines depict direct regulation, and green dashed lines depict
  indirect regulation. Red lines depict inhibition as well as red crosses. The vNAR-D01
  3D structure was adapted for [122]
