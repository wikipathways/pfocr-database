caption: Cytoscape session with ENViz application running. (a) Interactive legend,
  Analysis, and Visualization control panels. The Interactive legend shows a schematic
  of the analysis and the overview of the data loaded into Cytoscape for ENViz analysis.
  The Analysis panel controls data input and analysis parameter settings. The Visualization
  panel controls the significance threshold for the enrichment network generation
  and the color coding of the annotation categories based on enrichment scores. (b)
  Bi-partite network for enrichment analysis of breast cancer data. Nodes in this
  network correspond to WikiPathways (colored yellow->red) and miRNAs (gray), and
  edges represent significant enrichments of genes in the pathway correlated (red)
  or anti-correlated (blue) to the miRNA. (c) Cell Cycle WikiPathway with genes color
  coded according to their correlation to mir-301 b. (d) GO terms enriched in genes
  correlated to miR-150
