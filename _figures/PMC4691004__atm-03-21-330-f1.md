caption: Curcumin blocks multiple cancer promoting pathways via miR-21. Curcumin decreases
  miR-21 and thus increases PTEN, leading to decreased PI3K/Akt pathway activity.
  is increased, leading to decreased eIF4A and eIF4G and thus decreased translation.
  PDCD4 can also increase cell death through p21. Blockage of miR-21 also results
  in decreased NF-κB activity and gene transcription. miR-21, microRNA-21; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B; PDCD4,
  programmed cell death protein 4.
