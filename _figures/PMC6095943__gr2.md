caption: A schematic representation of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework.
  An AOP is triggered by a Molecular Initiating Event (MIE), an initial interaction
  with a biological target (Anchor 1) that leads to a sequential cascade of cellular,
  tissue and organ responses (Key Events), linked to each other by key event relationship
  (KER) to result in an adverse outcome (AO) of regulatory relevance.
