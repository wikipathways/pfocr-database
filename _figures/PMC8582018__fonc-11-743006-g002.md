caption: The figure shows the agents or mechanisms that regulate ferroptosis in animal
  models or patients with hematological malignancies. (A) Treatment of ALL cells with
  HD, RSL3 and SMAC resulted in ferroptosis with increased lipid peroxidation levels,
  which was inhibited by antioxidants and DFO; (B) TYP treatment of AML cells could
  lead to ferroptosis in AML cells through activation of AMPK signaling, accompanied
  by ferritin degradation and ROS accumulation; APR-246 action on AML cells decreased
  cystine uptake, resulting in decreased GSH synthesis and lipid peroxidation in the
  cell membrane (this effect can be inhibited by iron chelators, lipophilic antioxidants
  and lipid peroxidation inhibitors); (C) Expression of SLC7A11 would definitely be
  down-regulated in CLL cells, and system Xc- transporting cystine capacity could
  be reduced, leading to increased intracellular ROS and promoting cellular ferroptosis;
  (D) MI-463 action on MLL led to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by ferroptosis
  of its cells, which could be reversed by the use of ferroptosis inhibitors. (E)
  Treatment of DLBCLs with RSL3, Erastin, and DMF resulted in ferroptosis of cells
  accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation levels, increased ROS, and decreased
  GSH levels, which was inhibited by antioxidants, DFO, and vitamin E; (F) Artesunate
  induced ferroptosis in Burkitt‘s lymphoma(BL) cells by activating the ATF4-CHOP-CHAC1
  pathway and degrading GSH; (G) p53 inhibited system Xc- and promoted ferroptosis
  in Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells, while deletion of TP53 gene accelerated the formation
  of Eμ-Myc lymphoma model; (H) MM could generate lipid ROS through high levels of
  H2O2, a byproduct of antibody production, which reacted with excess iron in the
  Fenton reaction, thereby destroying the cell membrane and causing cell death.
