caption: 'The core apoptotic pathway and its regulation by miRNAs in THP-1 cells exposed
  to the lower dose of CdS QDs. The figure depicts events in the intrinsic and extrinsic
  apoptotic pathways. In the whole pathway, point and block arrows indicate activation
  or inhibition, respectively. In the experimental conditions, the arrows next to
  the miRNAs indicate an increase or decrease of the miRNA. A red arrow indicates
  an increase in a specific miRNA and its target repressed is indicated with a red
  cross. A green arrow indicates a decrease with lack of repression of its specific
  target. As a result, the specific step is locked (red light) or could be unlocked
  (yellow light). The expression of most of the gene participants in the pathway are
  blocked by an increase in regulatory miRNAs.Note: DIANA-Tarbase database and DIANA-mirPath
  were used to obtain the data to create this chart.'
