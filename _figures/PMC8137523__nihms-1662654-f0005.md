caption: 'Prenyltransferases mediate the prenylation of proteins through recognition
  of CAAX or dicysteine motifs. There is some overlap in the composition of individual
  complexes: FNTA pairs with different catalytic subunits (FNTB, PGGT1B) to form FTase
  and GGTase I; the catalytic subunit RABGGTB pairs with different subunits (RABGGTA/PTAR3,
  PTAR1) to form GGTase 2 (also known as RabGGTase) and GGTase 3. Chaperone proteins
  REP and SKP1 are respectively required for geranylgeranylation by GGTase 2 and newly
  identified GGTase 3. FTase inhibitors (FTI) have clinical potential in tumors driven
  by H-RAS, which is exclusively farnesylated. Currently available GGTase inhibitors
  (GGTI) competitively inhibit GGTase I by acting as a CAAX peptidomimetic though
  their activity towards GGTase 3 is not well characterized. Clickable prenylation
  probes provide tools to assess the substrates of each prenyltransferase using either
  targeted or global approaches using fluorescent tags like tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)
  azide (N3-TAMRA) or biotin-labeling with biotin azide (N3-Biotin).'
