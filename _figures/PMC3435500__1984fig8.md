caption: Model for phyB- and phyA-dependent control of seed germination. The vertical
  dashed line separates early (left) and late (right) FR-dependent light signaling
  events. (Left) An early FR pulse inactivates phyB in the endosperm. This leads to
  PIF1 stabilization in the endosperm and to PIF1-dependent repression of GA3ox1/2
  expression (GA) and stimulation of NCED6/9 expression (shown as “ABA” in blue) (Supplemental
  Fig. 5C). Low GA synthesis prevents testa rupture and stabilizes RGL2, which further
  stimulates NCED6/9 expression (ABA) (Supplemental Fig. 5A; ). The same early FR
  pulse activates phyA in the embryo, where a simplified model of the phyA signaling
  pathway is shown with red lines, emphasizing (1) PIF1 destabilization by the active
  Pfr form of phyA; (2) PIF1-dependent stimulation of SOM, GAI, and RGA expression;
  (3) SOM-dependent repression of GA3ox1/2 (GA) expression and stimulation of NCED6/9
  (ABA) expression; (4) GA-dependent GAI and RGA destabilization; and (5) GAI- and
  RGA-dependent stimulation of ABA synthesis. Endospermic ABA is released toward the
  embryo (blue line) and joins the pool of ABA synthesized in the embryo (shown as
  “ABA” in black). ABA overrides (black lines) phyA signaling by repressing GA3ox1/2
  (GA) expression and stimulating PIF1, SOM, RGA, and GAI expression, thus further
  repressing GA3ox1/2 (GA) expression and stimulating NCED6/9 (ABA) expression. As
  a result, ABA dominates to repress germination. (Right) A second later FR pulse
  maintains in the endosperm the situation described in the left part of the figure,
  since phyB remains inactive. However, ABA-dependent responses become weaker over
  time, allowing the second FR pulse to stimulate and repress embryonic GA and ABA
  synthesis gene expression, respectively, in a phyA-dependent manner (). GA accumulation
  is expected to further weaken ABA-dependent responses by repressing GAI and RGA
  accumulation. This leads to “explosive” germination, as embryonic growth occurs
  in a context of unruptured testa.
