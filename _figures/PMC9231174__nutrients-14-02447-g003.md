caption: '(a) Mechanisms for the induction of VDES-mediated antibacterial responses
  in monocytes. Pattern recognition receptors (TLR2/1) detect germs to induce the
  expression of CYP27B1 and VDR. The resulting intracrine system for vitamin D (blue
  arrows) converts calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)) into calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D (1,25(OH)2D)), which then binds to the VDR and promotes transcriptional regulation.
  Responses to intracrine activation of the VDES (pink arrows) include the following:
  induction of antibacterial cathelicidin (CAMP) and β-defensin 2 (DEFB4); iron-regulating
  hepcidin (HAMP) suppression; promotion of autophagy; induction of NOD2 expression;
  feedback regulation of toll-like receptor expression (TLR); and increased destruction
  of bacteria. For some responses, accessory immune signals (MDP-noD2 binding and
  IL-1 responsiveness) cooperate with the intracrine VDES through nuclear factor κB
  (NF-κB) (white arrows). (b) Antiviral actions of the VDES and the innate immune
  response: autophagy/apoptosis. Autophagy is a fundamental biological process that
  maintains cellular homeostasis through the encapsulation of the intracellular membrane
  of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. Autophagy is also an essential mechanism
  by which cells cope with viruses. Autophagic encapsulation of viral particles packages
  them for lysosomal degradation and subsequent presentation of antigens and adaptive
  antiviral immune responses. Therefore, autophagy may be highly sensitive to changes
  in serum 25(OH)D levels. The specific mechanisms that enable the VDES to promote
  autophagy involve downregulation of the mTOR pathway, which inhibits autophagy,
  and promotion of Beclin 1 and PI3KC3, key autophagy-driving enzymes. The upregulation
  of intracellular Ca and NO by VDES also stimulates the activity of PI3KC3 to promote
  autophagy.'
