caption: 'Representation of the top canonical pathway ‘interferon signalling’ detected
  when simultaneously analysing the mRNA and miRNA data sets with IPA. Parts related
  to IFN-α/β were removed, and SDE miRNAs targeting the detected genes of the pathway
  were added. Connections between miRNAs and their targets were established by IPA.
  Genes that were differentially expressed in at least one condition are marked with
  filled grey symbols. Expression changes at 3, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h with respect to
  untreated controls are shown as bar charts close to each molecule. For non-significant
  conditions, a line is shown instead of a bar. The last bar on the far right always
  corresponds to JII-treated control (72 h). Connections between main players of the
  signalling pathway are depicted as lines: relationships between miRNAs and target
  mRNAs are shown as thin lines, whereas relationships between TFs and target mRNAs
  are presented by thicker lines either indicating activation or repression.'
