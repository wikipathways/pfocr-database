caption: Vancomycin-resistant lptD suppressors map to cdsA, the gene responsible for
  the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol. (A) The inner membrane
  CdsA protein is predicted to have seven transmembrane domains (). Vancomycin-resistant
  cdsA suppressors mapped mainly within these domains. Mutations V16G, L33P, Δ56–62,
  Y156D, and L236Q were isolated in an lptDV52E-I54E background. I203S was isolated
  in an lptDI54E background, and R263L was isolated in an lptDΔD57ΔK60 background.
  The mutations enclosed in circles, I203S (cdsA7) and R263L (cdsA9), are characterized
  further in this study. (B) Biosynthetic pathway for major phospholipids in Escherichia
  coli. Protein names are in boxes, and they are next to the arrow that signifies
  the step at which they act.
