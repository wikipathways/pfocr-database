caption: a. In the basal state, TGF-β family ligands are either absent or present
  as latent factors, sequestered by binding components of the extracellular matrix
  (ECM) or the membrane of other cells []. Allosteric inhibitors may enforce the inactive
  state of the receptors, all of which are transmembrane serine/threonine protein
  kinases []. SMAD proteins that serve as receptor substrates (R-SMADs), and their
  shared partner SMAD4, continuously transit between cytoplasm and nucleus by direct
  interaction with nuclear pore components []. SMAD partners including lineage-determining
  transcription factors (LDTF), other signal-driven transcription factors (SDTF),
  and the histone binding protein TRIM33, may already be pre-bound to the genome.
  Numbers in circles refer to these and other pathway regulators, as detailed in .b.
  In the activated state, ligand from cells in the microenvironment or released from
  latent complexes allosterically by integrins or enzymatically by proteases [], binds
  to pairs of type I and type II receptors. Ligands can access the receptors directly
  or, in the case of TGF-β, Nodal and BMP9/10, with assistance of accessory co-receptors
  []. Ligand traps [] and antagonistic ligands [] block access to the receptors. In
  the ligand-induced receptor complex, the type II receptor subunits primarily phosphorylate
  and activate the type I receptors, which phosphorylate R-SMADs, with the assistance
  of adaptor proteins []. Receptor-phosphorylated R-SMADs form heterotrimers with
  SMAD4. Pseudo-receptors [], inhibitory SMADs [], and SKI proteins [] inhibit the
  formation of receptor and SMAD complexes and provide negative feedback in the pathway.
  Inhibitory SMADs recruit ubiquitin ligases that target the receptor [], which are
  opposed by deubiquitylases []. In the nucleus, activated SMAD complexes bind to
  hundreds of genomic loci as dictated by context-defining LDTFs and SDTFs []. SMADs
  contact DNA using a highly conserved β-hairpin structure located in the N-terminal
  domain (or MH1) domain. The SMAD C-terminal domain (or MH2 domain) binds not only
  LDTFs and SDTFs but also chromatin binding proteins [], co-activators and co-repressors
  [,]. The nuclear kinases CDK8/9 phosphorylate the SMAD interdomain linker region
  [] for recruitment of additional cofactors []. Subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3
  targets SMADs for ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent degradation [,]. Alternatively,
  SMADs are dephosphorylated [, ] and dissociated from DNA [] for recycling.The signaling
  steps summarized here are reviewed in detail elsewhere,,,,,,.
