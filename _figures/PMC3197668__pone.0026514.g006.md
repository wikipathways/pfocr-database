caption: In normal breast cells, the TGF-beta pathway is active in keeping Estrogen
  receptor-alpha cells from proliferating. A) In cancer cells with a luminal phenotype
  (e.g. MCF-7), the TGF-beta pathway is downregulated, ER-alpha and MTA3 are expressed,
  and Snail expression is inhibited. This results in a differentiated and epithelial
  phenotype with well-preserved cell junctions, and the cells are adherent and non-migratory.
  B) During EMT, expression of Snail (and/or Slug) causes downregulation of ER-alpha
  and upregulation of the TGF-beta pathway. However, TGF-beta now serves a pro-metastatic
  role, and early progenitor markers are induced, resulting in a more ‘claudin-low’
  morphology that is more mesenchymal and highly migratory.
