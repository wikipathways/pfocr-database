caption: 'Phenylpropanoid pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase. The monolignol biosynthetic branch:
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase;
  COMT, caffeic acid o-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA o-methyltransferase;
  F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase. The flavonoids biosynthetic branch: CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase. Dash arrows refer to unspecified steps of a particular metabolic
  pathway. The colored boxes indicate metabolites that are significantly induced by
  both types of stress.'
