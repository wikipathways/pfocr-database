caption: Dependence of different CD95 signalling pathways on a functional DD. Cells
  expressing primarily wild-type CD95 in the presence of stimulating CD95 ligand activate
  both apoptosis and NF-κB/MAPK pathways. Under these conditions, the apoptosis pathway
  prevails by restraining NF-κB activation through robust caspase activity (A). In
  cells expressing one wild-type and one mutant allele with a mutation in DD (X in
  DD) to comparable levels (a situation often found in ALPS type Ia patients), or
  under conditions of low receptor expression, apoptosis cannot be induced efficiently
  owing to the inability of the receptor to form an efficient DISC. However, NF-κB/MAPK
  pathways are activated normally (B). When mutant CD95 receptor is in large excess
  (achievable only in overexpression experiments) or when two CD95 mutant alleles
  are expressed (as in the lprcg mice), neither apoptosis nor NF-κB/MAPK pathways
  can be activated (C).
