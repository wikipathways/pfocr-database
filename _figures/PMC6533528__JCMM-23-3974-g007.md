caption: Schematic model of IL‐1β‐ and Fn‐fs‐mediated ADAMTS‐12 and ‐7 stimulation
  by Runx2 and Wnt/β‐catenin signalling modulation in OA‐SF. Synovial inflammation
  and cartilage ECM degradation are key events in OA pathology. SF and other cells
  in the joint produce proinflammatory mediators including IL‐1β. Fn‐fs are released
  to the microenvironment as consequence of ECM degradation. Binding of IL‐1β and
  Fn‐fs to their receptors, IL‐1 receptor (IL‐1R), and integrins (α, β) and Toll‐like
  receptors (TLRs), respectively, activates MEK‐ERK‐Runx2 axis. This activation converges
  in the transcription of ADAMTS‐12, with the subsequent degradation of COMP. Inhibition
  of MEK, and consequently ERK, with PD98059 (iERK), decreases Runx2 activation, ADAMTS‐12
  transcription and COMP degradation from cartilage ECM. IL‐1β and Fn‐fs also activates
  Wnt/β‐catenin signalling, promoting β‐catenin binding to its nuclear cofactors TCF/LEF
  (T‐cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor), and inducing ADAMTS‐7 expression, also
  converging in COMP cleavage from cartilage ECM. Activation of Wnt/β‐catenin by IL‐1β
  is mediated by induction of Wnt7B, which increases its own expression as well. Mechanisms
  involved in the stimulation of this signalling pathway by Fn‐fs are unknown. DKK1
  inhibits this signalling pathway by blocking Wnt‐binding to its receptor, thus decreasing
  ADAMTS‐7 transcription and COMP degradation
