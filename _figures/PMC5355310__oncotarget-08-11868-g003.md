caption: Epigenetically silenced genes of the calcium-signaling pathway were based
  on the KEGG pathway database. Green proteins were downregulated by hypermethylation
  in more than two solid cancer types. Light blue proteins were downregulated by hypermethylation
  in one cancer type. Black proteins were not downregulated by hypermethylation in
  any cancer type.
