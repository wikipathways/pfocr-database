caption: Orthologs between different organisms are placed in the same relative position.
  If orthologs were not found, the ortholog place marked a question mark (?) with
  a circle. Divergence times of major metazoa groups are presented next to the relevant
  branches. Our result shows that the complete core pathway known from bilaterians
  is represented in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. The pathway is mostly absent
  in non-metazoans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Monosiga brevicollis. The nematode
  Caenorhabditis elegans and its relatives Caenorhabditis Brigssae are deficient in
  several of the pathway components. This may indicate of a functional loss of major
  components in nematodes.
