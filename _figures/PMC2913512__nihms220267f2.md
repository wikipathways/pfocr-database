caption: 'This binding results in conformation changes of the receptor, which induces
  the binding of GTP to G protein α subunit and the dissociation of Gα subunit from
  Gβ and Gγ subunits. The activation of G protein induces downstream signalling pathways,
  such as PLC, DAG, PKA and PKC. Gα subunit triggers the induction of effector molecule
  PI3K/Akt survival pathway, which in turn down-regulates apoptotic factors (BAD,
  caspase-9 and XIAP) and phosphorylates Mdm2, the major inhibitor of p53. Importantly,
  this phosphorylation enhances the nuclear accumulation of Mdm2, which then inhibits
  p53 activity and destabilizes p53 protein to promote cell survival. Upon GPR87 knockdown,
  PI3K/AKT survival pathway become inactive and leads to p53 stabilization and transcriptional
  activity to mediate anti-proliferation and apoptotic responses. Other potential
  prosurvival pathways activated by GPR87 are MAPK pathway and PLC/PKC pathways. Abbreviations:
  Gα, the α subunit of G proteins; PLC, phospholipase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC,
  protein kinase C; PLD, phospholipase D; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PYK2, prolinerich tyrosine kinase 2; MEK, MAP kinase
