caption: Schematic representation of the interaction between Sildenafil, Leucine,
  PDE2, and PDE3. Increasing concentrations of sildenafil cause an increase in intracellular
  cGMP due to eNOS/NO activation and PDE5 inhibition, which is accompanied by a biphasic
  response in cAMP (lower right corner). This biphasic response in cAMP is mediated
  by the interaction of cGMP with PDE2 and PDE3. While PDE3 is inhibited by moderate
  increases in cGMP and consequently cAMP concentrations rise due to reduced hydrolysis,
  higher levels of cGMP activate PDE2 and, therefore, decrease cAMP. These changes
  in cAMP are reflected in downstream events such as AMPK activation, which is most
  likely mediated over the cAMP-EPAC-CamKKβ signaling pathway.
