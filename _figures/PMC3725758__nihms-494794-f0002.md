caption: In the cytoplasm, NF2 is known to disrupt the downstream signaling of Rac1
  and Cdc42 at several points. In addition to directly inhibiting the Rac1/Cdc42 complex,
  NF2 can also inhibit activation of PAKs, and Ras. In either exchange, NF2 prevents
  the activation of JNK and c-Jun, and the assembly of the AP-1 transcription complex.
  A reciprocal interaction also occurs in this pathway whereby PAKs can inhibit the
  actions of NF2. Interestingly, NF2 has differential effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  By inhibiting mTORC2, NF2 prevents the activation of Akt and its repression of FOXO
  and p27, known inhibitors of cell cycle progression. However, NF2 enhances the activation
  of mTORC1 and subsequent dissociation of transcription factors, 4E-BP1 and eIF4E.
  When freed, eIF4E, along with AP-1, can amplify the transcriptional activation of
  cyclin D1, demonstrating the overlapping nature of these separate pathways.
