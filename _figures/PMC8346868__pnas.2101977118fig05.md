caption: 'NAD biosynthesis from 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde pathway together
  with some metabolites from the other four canonical pathways. The second pattern
  metabolites (except niacinamide of the fourth pattern) were colored based on the
  correlation coefficient. Brighter red means more up-regulation, and blue, more colorful,
  more down-regulation. Metabolites shown in triangle symbols were detected in individual
  tissue, except NADPH, caught in BAT and CER. One-way ANOVA P values are shown next
  to the symbol (P value with an asterisk indicates the BAT result), and red arrows
  means a positive increase in the CR groups compared to AL. White metabolites indicate
  those not identified. Abbreviations: AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; CP, canonical pathways; CO2, carbon dioxide; H+, hydron; NAD, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form; NADH,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, its reduced form; NADP, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; and NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.'
