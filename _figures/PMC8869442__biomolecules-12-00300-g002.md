caption: Therapeutic intervention points in the Ubiquitylation and ISGylation machinery
  of the host and of SARS-CoV-2. Polyubiquitin chains are vital mediators in signaling
  downstream of three of the main families of innate immune signaling pathways, TLRs,
  RLRs and NLRs, which act together to sense a variety of PAMPs, including SARS-CoV-2.
  A network of E3 ligases and DUBs (purple) generate new ubiquitin (yellow) and ISG15
  (orange) architectures during viral infection. For instance, LUBAC assembles linear
  ubiquitin chains on pre-existing K63-linked ubiquitin chains, forming branched structures.
  Their structures are reshaped and limited by OTUB1/2, OTULIN (not shown), A20 and
  CYLD. K63-linked ubiquitin chains are assembled on RIG-I by TRIM25, which allow
  its polymerization and activation of MAVS. In addition, the amount of K48-linked
  ubiquitin chains regulates TRIM25 levels, and these chains are cleaved by USP4 and
  USP15. MAVS signaling to IRF3/7 depends on ubiquitylation of NEMO (not shown), but
  this can be removed by OTUB1/2. Some of these pathways end up activating the IFN-I
  pathway, driving production of ISGs, including more IFN and ISG15. ISG15 is conjugated
  by HERC5 to host proteins, which activates antiviral signaling, and to viral proteins,
  which is believed to inhibit viral processes. Signaling from MDA5 and RIG-I to MAVS
  depends on the ubiquitylation of MAVS and RIG-I, as well as on the ISGylation of
  MDA5. Activated MAVS drives IRF3/IRF7-dependent IFN-I gene production. However,
  the cell also produces USP18, an ISG protease that removes ISG15 from cellular proteins,
  fine-tuning IFN signals. An antiviral response is driven by neighboring cells through
  paracrine signaling of type I IFNs. The extent of downstream signaling depends on
  levels of STAT1, which is modulated by K48-linked ubiquitin chains and its removal
  by USP13. Host protease inhibitors have been described for CYLD (Subquinocin), OTUB2
  (OTUB2COV1) and USP4 (NR). SARS-CoV-2 opposes ubiquitin- and ISG15-mediated antiviral
  mechanisms by encoding the multi-activity deubiquitylating/deISGylating enzyme PLpro
  (light green) to inhibit their function. A number of PLpro inhibitors have been
  identified (listed in the yellow box), characterized and are undergoing clinical
  trials. Figure created with BioRender.com in January 2022.
