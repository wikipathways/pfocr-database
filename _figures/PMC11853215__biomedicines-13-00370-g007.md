caption: Proposed simplified signaling pathway elucidating the mechanism underlying
  the amelioration of steatosis induced by Exendin-4. At rest, when the levels of
  extracellular circulating FFAs are low, the uptake of these FFAs is low and the
  expression of MALAT1 and many lipid metabolism genes is downregulated. Following
  stimulation with OA, mimicking an increase in extracellular FFA levels, the expression
  of MALAT1 leads to the modulation of the expression of several genes, including
  SREBP-1, SCD1, FAS, ACC, DGAT1, DGTA2, MTTP, and NR1H2. In the presence of Ex-4
  treatment, a downregulation of MALAT1 is associated with reversal of the modulations
  of numerous genes induced by OA, leading to a reduction in steatosis. Predictive
  upstream and downstream targets are highlighted. Upward and downward arrows indicate
  upregulation and downregulation, respectively
