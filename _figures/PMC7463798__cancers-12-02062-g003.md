caption: Proposed signaling pathways affected by SphK inhibitors. (A) Safingol inhibits
  SphK, and increases sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (DSph), but not ceramide.
  These increased sphingolipids may induce ER stress and ROS production, leading to
  apoptosis and/or autophagy. (B) FTY720 is phosphorylated by SphK2, resulting in
  p-FTY720, which extracellularly inhibits S1PR signaling. Intracellularly, FTY720
  inhibits SphK1, activates PP2A, and suppresses Akt, Erk, c-Myc, and β-catenin. FTY720
  also activates PKCδ through an NADPH-mediated pathway. (C) ABC294640 inhibits SphK2,
  and induces proteasomal degradation of SphK1 and dihydroceramide desaturase (DES).
  Accumulated dihydroceramide (DCer) can induce ER stress, up mark(triangle), increase
  by the inhibitor, and down mark (inverted triangle), decrease by the SphK inhibitor.
