caption: Central illustration. The transcriptomic level of the genes participating
  in EC apoptosis (via the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways) increases up to day 3
  after ischemia onset, whereas EC proliferation occurs from day 3 onwards. In terms
  of angiogenesis modulation, the BPs implicated in new vessel formation are overrepresented
  as early as ischemia onset, while the mechanisms aiming at inhibiting this process
  are detected from day 3 onwards. Image created with BioRender.com, accessed on 13
