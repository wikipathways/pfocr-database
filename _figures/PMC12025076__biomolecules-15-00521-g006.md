caption: Signaling pathway linking TRPM3 channel stimulation with gene transcription.
  Stimulation of TRPM3 channels with pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) induces a direct
  influx of Ca2+ ions through the channel into the cells. Alternatively, activated
  TRPM3 channels can trigger an influx of Na+ into the cells, which leads to a depolarization
  of the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
  The result of both scenarios is an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.
  This increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] leads to the activation of protein kinase ERK1/2
  via the activation of the protein kinases PKC, Raf, and MEK. ERK1/2 translocates
  into the nucleus and induces the transcription of stimulus-responsive transcription
  factors. The transcription factors CREB and Elk-1 are activated via phosphorylation,
  while the activity of c-Jun and c-Fos activity is increased by both increased transcription
  and phosphorylation. Activated stimulus-responsive transcription factors regulate
  the transcription of delayed response genes. Transcription of genes encoding stimulus-responsive
  transcription factors and delayed response genes is controlled by epigenetic regulators.
