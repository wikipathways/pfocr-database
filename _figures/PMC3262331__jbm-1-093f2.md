caption: 'Schematic signaling pathway mediated by the L-CBM complex in T and B lymphocytes.Notes:
  The L-CBM complex acts in the canonical NF-κB (p65/p50, cRel/p50) activation pathway
  mediated by IKKβ downstream of TCRs and BCRs. L-CBM also controls the JNK, particularly
  JNK2, activation pathway through antigen receptors, leading to c-JUN activation.
  Upon antigen receptor stimulation, PKCθ in T cells and PKCβ in B cells phosphorylate
  CARMA1 in the PRD region (see ), enabling the formation and membrane recruitment
  of the L-CBM complex. IKKβ positively and negatively regulates L-CBM signaling.
  These signaling events are regulated by the recruitment of signaling components
  to specific membrane domains, such as lipid rafts, after receptor triggering. In
  MZ B cells, L-CBM mediates signals for canonical NF-κB activation through TLR4-Myd88.
  L-CBM also mediates signals for noncanonical NF-κB (RelB/p52) activation mediated
  by NIK and IKKα downstream of the BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), which regulates the survival
  of MZ B cells.'
