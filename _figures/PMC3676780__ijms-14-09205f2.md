caption: A schematic of the signal transduction pathway in E. coli. The trimer of
  chemoreceptor homodimers spans the cytoplasmic membrane, with a ligand-binding domain
  on the periplasmic side and a signaling domain on the cytoplasmic side. The cytoplasmic
  signaling proteins, denoted Che in the text, are identified by single letters, e.g.,
  A = CheA. Proteins and reactions in red promote counterclockwise (CCW) rotation
  of flagella, and those in blue promote clockwise (CW) rotation of flagella. Receptor
  methylation sites involved in adaptation are shown as white (demethylated) and black
  (methylated) circles.
