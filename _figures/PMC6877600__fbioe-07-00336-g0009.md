caption: Reaction fluxes for (A) scenario 1 (Functional GLOI), and (B) scenario 2
  (Non-functional GLOI). The depicted scenarios are illustrating the flow of flux
  for the objective function (OF). The simulation was performed for the production
  of pyruvate (from glycolysis and glyoxalase pathway) and role of MGO in producing
  AGEs (MGO-Arg and MGO-Lys) and MGO•− free radical. Solid thick black arrows represent
  the direction of main flux flow through the model. Gray arrows are an indication
  of undetermined (zero) flux through the respective reaction. Dotted arrows represent
  the transport of the metabolites.
