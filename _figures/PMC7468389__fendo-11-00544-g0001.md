caption: GPER signaling pathway and effect of its stimulation in female reproductive
  cancers. Subcellular location of GPER has been found at the plasma membrane (1),
  endoplasmic reticulum (2), and the nucleus (3). Black references refer to promotion
  of disease progression, such as cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion,
  metastasis, poor prognosis, drug resistance, and increased recurrence, while the
  references in red suggest an anti-tumor role. Created with BioRender.
