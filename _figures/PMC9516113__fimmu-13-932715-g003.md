caption: CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to model IEIs/PIRDs. The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists
  of the Cas9 protein in complex with a targeting gRNA, forming a ribonucleoprotein
  (RNP). Specificity is conferred through various mechanisms including the sgRNA and
  presence of the PAM sequence. The Cas9 opens and cuts the targeted sequence on both
  strands to generate double-strand breaks (DSBs). This activates DNA repair pathways
  (NHEJ and HDR) in cells and results in modifications at a target locus. The NHEJ
  pathway can be used for scenarios in which genetic variants result in the loss of
  expression of an encoded protein, while HDR can be employed for introduction of
  missense mutations. IEIs, inborn errors of immunity; PIRDs, primary immune regulatory
  disorders; sgRNA, single-guide RNA; PAM, protospacer adjacent motif; NHEJ, non-homologous
  end joining; HDR, homology-directed repair. Adapted from “CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing”,
