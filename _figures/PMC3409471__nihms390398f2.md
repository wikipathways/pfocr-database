caption: Wnt/β-catenin, AKT, TGF-β and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways are deregulated
  in hepatic CSCs. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in β-catenin accumulation
  in the cytosol and translocation into the nucleus, where β-catenin transcriptional
  activates the expression of its targets, such as cyclinD1, EpCAM, and miR-181. AKT
  is activated by two phosphorylation sites Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation of
  Thr308 is promoted by PI3K and suppressed by PTEN. Activated AKT protect hepatic
  CSCs from apoptosis through the induction of BCL-2 and ABCG2 under the pressure
  of chemotherapy. Activated AKT could also interact with HIF-1α to induce VEGF and
  PDGF-BB expression for regulating the homeostasis and drug resistance of hepatic
  CSCs. Impaired TGF TGF-β signaling together with activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway
  is important to regulate the differentiation and chemoresistance of EpCAM+ hepatic
  CSCs. Studies have shown that these pathways are interconnected, which may further
  promote stemness and carcinogenesis in HCC.
