caption: 'Important aspects of the Warburg effect: glycolysis, lactate fermentation,
  TCA cycle, pentose pyruvate pathway (PPP), and glutamine metabolism provide energy
  and substrates needed for cell proliferation and immune functions. Key metabolic
  pathways are colored red, and metabolites shown in green boxes. SIRT6 suppresses
  the activation of HIF-1α, PI3/Akt, NF-κB, and Myc signaling pathways involved in
  the metabolic shift from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis (inset). These signaling
  pathways target several enzymes involved in multiple metabolic pathways. HIF-1α
  activation induces the expression and translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT1
  to the plasma membrane. Also, HIF-1α can increase the expression of lactate dehydrogenase,
  thus increasing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. HIF-1α upregulates the expression
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), the upstream kinase of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH). PDK phosphorylates and inhibits PDH activity and represents another mechanism
  by which HIF-1α puts a brake on the TCA cycle. Similarly, Akt activation also activates
  several steps in the glycolysis pathway, including the expression and membrane translocation
  of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Akt also phosphorylates and activates phosphofructokinase-2
  (PFK-2), generating fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), which is an allosteric
  activator of the rate-limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), hence progressing
  glycolysis. NF-kB also contributes to the Warburg effect by promoting the Akt-induced
  translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane. Myc plays a central role in the activation
  of glutaminolysis. Myc activates glutaminase, which converts glutamine to glutamate.
  Glutamate is then transaminated into α-ketoglutarate, which contributes to citrate
  and malate synthesis. Citrate and malate can be exported out of mitochondria to
  generate acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, respectively, along with NADPH. Further, Myc also
  upregulates the expression of glutamine transporters needed to import glutamine
  into the cell. Together, these metabolic pathways allow the cell to generate sufficient
  raw materials for the synthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides needed for
  the growth and proliferation of immune cells. PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK,
