caption: Interaction between SAMHD1 and deoxyguanosine kinase activities in the regulation
  of mitochondrial dGTP. Synthesis of dGTP occurs in the cytosol by de novo synthesis
  catalyzed by RNR and by salvage of GdR catalyzed by dCK. The two synthetic pathways
  are counteracted by catabolic activities distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
  SAMHD1 degrades dGTP to GdR in the nucleus, whereas in the cytosol 5′-nucleotidases
  (cdN and cN-II) dephosphorylate dGMP to GdR, and PNP degrades GdR to free guanine.
  Due to the permeability of the nuclear envelope to nucleotides and nucleosides,
  nuclear and cytosolic pools represent a single kinetic compartment. The mitochondrial
  dGTP pool derives most of its components from the cytosol via nucleotide and nucleoside
  carriers in the inner mt membrane. In mitochondria, a separate salvage pathway,
  depending on dGK, recycles GdR, creating a dGTP pool protected from the catabolic
  activity of SAMHD1.
