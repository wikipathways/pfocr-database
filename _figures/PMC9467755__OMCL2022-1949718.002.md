caption: The signal pathway of SIRT1-mediated anti-inflammatory in stroke. The picture
  shows the signal pathway of SIRT1-mediated anti-inflammatory in stroke. SIRT1 can
  inhibit the production of proinflammatory factors through the deacetylation of HMGB1,
  NF-κB, and NLRP3 inflammasome, thus achieving an anti-neuroinflammatory effect.
  Through the deacetylation of HMGB1 and NF-κB, the synthesis of some proinflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the nucleus was inhibited. In addition,
  through the deacetylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the function of caspase-1 was
  restricted, and eventually, the pathway of conversion of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to IL-1β and IL-18 was blocked.
