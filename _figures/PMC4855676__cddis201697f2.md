caption: The NFAT signaling pathway. Representation of NFAT activation and translocation
  to the nucleus. The triggering of a G-protein-coupled or tyrosine-kinase receptor
  leads to the activation of phospholipase C, which promotes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2), producing diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). Then, IP3
  binds to IP3R and induces the release of Ca2+ ions from the endoplasmic reticulum
  to the cytoplasm, depleting the intracellular stores. The depletion of calcium stores
  induces the activation of the stromal interaction molecule, which promotes the opening
  of calcium release-activated channel in the plasma, leading to the sustained increase
  in the cytoplasmic calcium levels. Next, the Ca2+ ions bind to calmodulin and activate
  the phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates specific serine residues
  in NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT undergoes a conformational change exposing its NLS
  and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NFAT binds to DNA alone or in cooperation
  with other nuclear partner proteins, activated by other signaling pathways, to regulate
  gene expression. To reverse its activation, NFAT kinases rephosphorylate NFAT and
  promote the concealment of its NLS and exposure of the NES, redirecting NFAT to
  the cytoplasm
