caption: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection. Briefly, NG infection starts with the
  host cell interaction, establishing contact through some host cell receptors (CD46
  and CR3) and type IV pili communication. After cell adhesion, this bacterium starts
  its replication and invasion processes, via transcytosis. Concomitantly, NG releases
  some cellular fragments, such as peptidoglycans and lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS),
  which, in contact with some cell surface molecules, namely, asialoglycoprotein receptor
  (ASGP-R) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family (CEACAM),
  can activate some signaling pathways (such as NF-kB pathway), triggering processes
  such as pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production (including IL-1, IL-6,
  IL-8). In addition, this pro-inflammatory gradient of molecules drives the immune
  cell recruitment to the local, mainly dendritic, cells, macrophages, and neutrophils.
  Although these immune cells’ role is to trigger pathogen destruction, mostly through
  phagocytosis by neutrophils, up to the infection clearance, NG can frequently survive,
  and the infection can persist. Figure created using BioRender.
