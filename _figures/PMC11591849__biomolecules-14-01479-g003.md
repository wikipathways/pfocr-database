caption: 'Schematic illustration of the diverse mechanisms through which anti-diabetic
  pharmacotherapy may affect tumor microenvironment dynamics. Metformin promotes the
  conversion of TAMs into an M1 phenotype, thereby enhancing anti-proliferative activity
  and inhibiting angiogenic processes. Pioglitazone modifies immune responses through
  the targeting of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to increased activation
  of TILs, which are essential for recognizing and attacking tumor cells in the presence
  of mature dendritic cells. Additionally, canagliflozin reduces the release of the
  inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2, which may limit the recruitment of immune
  cells while simultaneously increasing the chemokine CXCL10, ultimately inhibiting
  tumor angiogenesis. Conversely, DPP-4 inhibitors may promote metastatic processes
  by activating the ROS-mediated Nrf2/HO-1/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling axis, resulting in
  elevated production of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and angiogenic
  factors, including IL-6, ICAM-1, and VEGF [29,83,88,124]. Abbreviations: CANA: Canagliflozin;
