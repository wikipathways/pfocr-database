caption: Schematic plot of significantly differentially expressed genes involved in
  GA metabolism and signaling under CK, CCC, and PBZ treatments in roots and shoots.
  The plant growth retardants CCC and PBZ restricted the gene expression in the GA
  metabolism pathway both in the root and shoot in (A)–(D), and PBZ/CCC treatment
  raised the gene expression in the GA signaling pathway in roots in A and B, but
  decreased them in shoots in (C,D). The genes with red color indicated upregulation,
  and the green color genes were down regulated.
