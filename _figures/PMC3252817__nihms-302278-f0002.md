caption: RAS is activated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation with several
  ligands that invoke these intermediates. Activation of the receptor leads to the
  activation of Ras nucleotide exchange factors such as GRB-2 and SOS that mediate
  the exchange of GDP for GTP and the recruitment of Raf and the activation of downstream
  factors such as Rac, Rho that mediate changes in the cytoskeleton, MEK and MAPK
  that mediate proliferation and PI3K and AKT that are necessary for survival. Other
  factors that mediate transcription such as the Janus Activating Kinase (Jak) lead
  to the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) phosphorylation and
  transcription. This pathway has also been linked to tipifarnib response but the
  mechanism is unknown.
