caption: The regulation of molecules in the NMDAR signaling pathway on learning and
  memory. The release of presynaptic glutamate can activate postsynaptic NMDAR, leading
  to the removal of magnesium ions and the influx of calcium. The calcium could bind
  to the calmodulin to activate the calmodulin-dependent PKA and PKC, which are the
  basis for the activation of MAPK. Furthermore, the activated MAPK can be transported
  into the nucleus and activate CREB, resulting the expression of downstream genes,
  such as tPA and BDNF, among others. Finally, the new synthetic substances can cause
  the growth of original synapses and the formation of new synapses, which are the
  basis for synaptic plasticity and learning and memory
