caption: Path-net and gene-gene interaction analysis of differentially methylated
  genes. a Path-net analysis of differentially methylated genes. Cycle nodes represent
  pathways, the size of the node represents the power of the interrelation among the
  pathways, and the lines represent the interaction between the pathways. The more
  edges in a pathway, the more pathways connecting to it and the more central role
  it plays within the network. b Gene-gene interaction analysis of differentially
  methylated genes. Red circle nodes represent up-regulated genes, and blue circle
  nodes represent down-regulated genes. The size of the node represents degree, and
  lines represent interactions between the genes. A straight line represents combinations
  anda dotted line represents indirect effects. a, activation; b, binding; c, compound;
  inh, inhibition; u, ubiquination; s, state change; dep, dephosphorylation
