caption: Schematic illustration of angiogenesis signaling pathways induced by OS.
  According to different responses to OS, two signal pathways of angiogenesis are
  covered, namely, the VEGF-dependent signaling pathway and VEGF-independent signaling
  pathway. In the VEGF-dependent pathway, ROS, NO, OxLDL, and OxPLs strongly stimulate
  the expression of HIF-1a and VEGF. Meanwhile, Poly I:C and LPS promote the expression
  of HIF-1α and VFGF by coupling with their specific receptors (TLR3 and TLR4). These
  further combine to the downstream receptor VEGFR-2 and facilitate angiogenesis by
  activating the HIF-1α/VFGF/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway in a VEGF-dependent manner.
  On the other hand, many mediators are involved in the VEGF-independent pathway,
  including CEP, LPS, MALP-2, PDGF, and ROS. CEP/yyMALP-2 initially couples to their
  receptors (TLR2/6), then sensitizes specific downstream targets (e.g., MyD88 and
  GM-CSF), and finally promotes angiogenesis. Meanwhile, ROS activate the P38 pathway
  via inducing the activation of ATM and ultimately result in angiogenesis. Besides,
  LPS is considered to induce angiogenesis through a TRAF6-mediated activation of
  NF-κB and JNK. As another soluble mediator, PDGF triggers PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling
  by binding to its receptor and promotes neovascularization.
