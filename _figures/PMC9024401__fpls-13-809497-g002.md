caption: The core xanthone biosynthesis pathway in plants. The shikimate pathway supplies
  shikimate and L-phenylalanine precursors (detailed pathway is provided in ) to produce
  benzophenone intermediates, in particular 2,3′,4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone isomers
  used for downstream xanthone biosynthesis. In Gentianaceae family, 3-hydroxybenzoic
  acid is formed from shikimate and subsequently to 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and later
  2,4,5′6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone. Meanwhile, Hypericaceae family utilizes L-phenylalananine-dependent
  pathway through several more reactions to produce 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone and
  later the 2,3′,4,6-tetrahydroxybenzophenone. This latter reaction requires B3′H
  activity of which can be catalyzed by both CYP81AA1 or CYP81AA2 enzymes in Hypericum.
  Multiple arrows indicate multiple steps between intermediates while dotted arrows
  indicate hypothesized/proposed pathways. Protein activities that have been detected
  at molecular level are shown in bold while normal font type indicates protein activities
  detected at biochemical level (refer to ). The two arrows (one unbroken line and
  one dotted) for Cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (CHL) indicate that the enzymatic
  reaction has been characterized at the biochemical level from a crude protein extract,
  but whether this involves one or two enzymatic steps is yet to be validated at the
  molecular level. 3BZL, 3-hydroxybenzoate-CoA ligase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
