caption: Schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in apple regulated
  by MYB10. Flavonoid intermediates (gray boxes) and end products (black boxes) are
  indicated. Enzymes required for each step are shown in bold uppercase letters (PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonia lyase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H,
  flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; GT, unidentified enzyme encoding
  a glycosyl transferase for flavonol glycone synthesis; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase
  (denoted as DFR1 in the text); LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP-glycose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase
