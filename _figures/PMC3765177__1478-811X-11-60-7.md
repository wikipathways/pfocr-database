caption: Schematic illustration showing the interaction(s) among components of the
  early innate immune response at the transcriptional, cellular and organismal level
  during Mtb infection of rabbit lungs. Transcription profile refers to the microarray
  gene expression data from HN878- or CDC1551-infected rabbit lungs. The arrows in
  red (HN878) denote unregulation and those in green (CDC1551) indicate downregulation
  of pathway genes. Pathogenesis refers to the progression of infection into active
  disease (HN878) or containment of infection and establishment of latency (CDC1551)
  in the rabbit lungs at 4 to 12 weeks post-infection.
