caption: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) signaling pathway. Under normoxic conditions,
  HIF1/2 are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-containing enzymes. Hydroxylated
  HIFs are degraded in the proteasomes by von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein
  (VHL) via polyubiquitination. During hypoxic conditions, PHDs and FIH are inhibited
  and HIF-α subunits are translocated into the nucleus, where can dimerize with HIF1-β,
  recruit p300 and CBP, and ultimately, bind to HREs at target genes to cause activation
