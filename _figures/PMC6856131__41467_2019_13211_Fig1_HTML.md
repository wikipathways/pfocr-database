caption: A simplified scheme of core steroidal glycoalkaloid modification in tomato
  and potato species. In tomato, during transition from green to red fruit, the core
  α-tomatine is bitter steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) and converted to the non-bitter
  esculeoside A and additional SGAs. The main SGAs in cultivated potato are α-chaconine
  and α-solanine. Both cultivated potato and S. chacoense share a common pathway up
  to the biosynthesis of α-chaconine and α-solanine. These SGAs are hydroxylated to
  form leptinines (leptinine I and leptinine II) and subsequently leptines (leptine
  I and leptine II) that are unique to the wild potato, S. chacoense. The known SGAs
  biosynthetic genes are shown in blue color. GAME31 and GAME32 genes characterized
  in this study are marked in green. Dashed and solid arrows suggest multiple or single
  enzymatic steps in the pathway, respectively. A detailed tomato SGAs biosynthetic
  pathway is presented in Supplementary Fig. . GAME GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM, SGT
  STEROL ALKALOID GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE, Ac Acetoxy, Glu Glucose, Gal Galactose, Xyl
  Xylose, Rha Rhamnose. α-tomatine-derived SGAs are marked in red while dehydrotomatine-derived
  SGAs are shown in black
