caption: Dysregulation of intestinal epithelial cell RIPK pathways promotes cell death
  in IBD. Dysregulation of RIPK (receptor interacting protein kinase) pathways play
  a key role in the inflammatory processes occurring in IBD (inflammatory bowel disease).
  TNF (tumor necrosis factor) has pleyotropic roles in intestinal epithelial cells.
  In homeostasis, TNF through the activation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells) pathway, where RIPK1 has a scaffold function, it promotes
  cell proliferation, migration and survival, helping to a proper intestinal barrier
  regeneration. In IBD, TNF can induce apoptosis or necroptosis in a kinase dependent
  function of RIPK1 and RIPK1/3 respectively. Cell-to-cell adhesions are also loosened
  in IBD, allowing the translocation of food antigens and bacteria from the gut lumen.
  Another feature of IBD is microbial dysbiosis. Genetic mutations in RIPK2, NOD2
  (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) or ATG16L1 (autophagy-related
  protein 16 like 1) can impair a proper autophagy response allowing the proliferation
  and invasion of the host by pathogenic bacteria.
