caption: 'Network analysis. The Rho signaling pathway played a central role in the
  response to pigment exposure, and was activated via stimulation of TGF-ß and IGF-1.
  Activation of the Rho pathway resulted in MLC upregulation, predicted to lead to
  actin stress fiber polymerization and focal adhesion formation. This process would
  likely result in increased cellular contraction and decreased cellular migration,
  as well as inhibition of phagocytosis. Key tight junction genes, including OCLN
  and CLDN3, were upregulated after pigment exposure. Orange: upregulation, blue:
  downregulation'
