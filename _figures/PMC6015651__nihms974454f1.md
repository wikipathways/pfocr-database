caption: Domains and functions of MCPyV T antigens. a sT can (i) preserve 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation
  resulting in dysregulated cap-dependent translation [], (ii) through inhibition
  of SCF Fbx7 ubiquitin ligase stabilize their cellular targets and MCPyV LT [], (iii)
  interact with NEMO thereby inhibiting NF-κB-mediated transcription [–], (iv) lead
  to a motile and migratory phenotype by promoting microtubule destabilization [],
  (v) elevate aerobic glycolysis by regulating MCT-1 levels [] and (vi) inactivate
  p53 pathway through recruitment of MAX and MYCL and binding to P400 complex resulting
  in increased expression of the p53 inhibitor MDM2. b In tumor cells, the C-terminal
  domains of LT containing several crucial elements required for viral replication
  are consistently truncated by tumor-associated mutations. The truncated LT can (i)
  mediate cell proliferation by binding RB1 [], (ii) lead to gene expression alterations
  most of which require an intact RB binding site [], (iii) disrupt lysosomal clustering
  by binding hVam6p and translocating it into the nucleus [] and (iv) interact with
  Brd4 to RFC to the viral replication sites facilitating replication []. The latter
  two functions seem to be relevant for the normal life cycle of the virus. 4E-BP1
