caption: Model for the regulation of mTORC1 signaling in response to glycolytic flux
  via GAPDH-Rheb interaction. GAPDH acts as a glycolytic messenger that senses the
  glycolytic flow and signals to the mTORC1 pathway by interacting with Rheb. The
  extracellular glucose sufficiency increases the intracellular glycolytic flux, resulting
  in the accumulation of Gly-3-P and GAPDH charged with Gly-3-P, the form that is
  incapable of binding Rheb. Under low-glucose conditions, a decrease in the supply
  of extracellular glucose may result in the accumulation of GAPDH uncharged with
  Gly-3-P, which prevents Rheb from binding to mTORC1 and thereby inhibits mTORC1
  signaling. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
