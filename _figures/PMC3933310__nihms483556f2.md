caption: A) Akt is activated by extracellular signals that activate PI3K. The tumor
  suppressor, PTEN is a phospho-lipid phosphatase that negates the activity of PI3K.
  Akt activation inhibits the FOXO transcription factors and activates mTOR Complex
  1 (mTORC1). By increasing cellular metabolism Akt inhibits AMPK activity and increases
  the level of the by-products of energy metabolism, ROS. The inhibition of FOXOs
  by Akt inhibits the expression of anti-oxidants, which in turn further increase
  ROS levels. There is also interplay between FOXOs and mTORC1, whereby Sestrin3 induced
  by FOXOs activates AMPK and inhibits mTORC1. The activation of mTORC1 by Akt and
  by AMPK inhibition promotes several anabolic functions, but also elicits negative
  feedback loops that inhibit Akt. The high levels of FOXM1 in cancer cells could
  compensate for the suppression of FOXOs through induced expression of anti-oxidants
  genes.B) Energy stress during certain stages of tumor development increases oxidative
  stress by decreasing NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  AMPK activation under energy stress conditions is required to maintain NADPH homeostasis
  and prevent oxidative stress induced cell death. AMPK activation inhibits the consumption
  of NADPH by fatty acid synthesis through the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-coA
  carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and increases NADPH production via fatty acid oxidation, through
  phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC2.
