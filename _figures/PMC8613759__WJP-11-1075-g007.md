caption: 'The proposed signaling pathways for ERVWE1 contributes to mitochondrial
  energy metabolism deficiency in schizophrenia. 1: ERVWE1 suppressed cytoplasmic
  polyadenylation element-binding protein 1 (CPEB1) mRNA and protein expression by
  regulating its promoter activity; 2: ERVWE1 upregulated the expression of NADH dehydrogenase
  ubiquinone flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2) pseudogene (NDUFV2P1) through enhancing its promoter
  activity. CPEB1 downregulated NDUFV2P1 expression and functioned as a mediator of
  NDUFV2P1 transcript induced by ERVWE1; 3: NDUFV2P1 reduced NDUFV2 expression through
  inhibiting its promoter activation. Additionally, ERVWE1 decreased the mRNA and
  protein expression of NDUFV2 and suppressed NDUFV2 promoter through increasing NDUFV2P1
  transcript. Moreover, CPEB1 was involved in regulating NDUFV2P1/NDUFV2 signaling
  pathway triggered by ERVWE1; 4: ERVWE1 reduced complex I activity via regulating
  NDUFV2 and its retrocopies expression. Decreased CPEB1 was involved in the complex
  I activity deficiency induced by ERVWE1; 5: Deficient complex I activity might result
  in mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation and contributed to the development of schizophrenia.'
