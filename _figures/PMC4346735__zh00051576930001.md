caption: Krüppel-like factor KLF10-mediated regulation of transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-β signaling pathway in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. In response to ligand binding
  of active TGF-β1 to the TGF-β type II receptor (II), the type I receptor (I) is
  recruited and trans-phosphorylated. The activated type I receptor undergoes a conformation
  change that allows it to phosphorylate Smads (e.g., Smad2/3), which can hetero-oligermerize
  with a common Smad, Smad4 (not shown), to modulate transcriptional responses, often
  in association with other coactivators or corepressors. In CD8+ T cells (left),
  KLF10 binds to the TGF-βRII promoter, an effect that potentiates TGF-β signaling
  in response to T cell receptor (TCR) activation and maintains CD8+ T cell quiescence.
  In CD4+ T cells (right), KLF10 binds to both the TGF-β1 and Foxp3 promoters, effects
  that regulate CD4+CD25− T cell activation in response to TCR stimulation and the
  acquisition of T regulatory cell differentiation and suppressor function.
