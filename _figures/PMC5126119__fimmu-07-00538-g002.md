caption: Overview of TLR-4/LPS signaling pathway activated by LPS in ALD. Chronic
  ethanol exposure leads to increased translocation of LPS to liver. In liver, LBP
  (the shuttle protein) transfers LPS to CD14, which facilitates the binding of LPS
  to TLR-4/MD-2 complex. TLR4 undergoes dimerization and transduces signal by two
  different pathways, i.e., MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways. The former
  pathway included the recruitment of IRAK4, IRAK1, and TRAF-6, which ultimately leads
  to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the activation of NF-κB and MAPK.
  In the second scenario, TRIF triggers a signaling pathway which controls the production
  of type I interferon and some other cytokines, as well as the late-phase activation
  of NF-κB and MAPK.
