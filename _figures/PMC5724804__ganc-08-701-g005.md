caption: (A) A network pathway showing regulatory interactions among 12 of the 17
  genes modulated ≥2-fold upon SIRT6 knockdown was generated using IPA. Pink boundaries
  indicate involvement of those genes in cancer. Gene-gene interactions are indicated
  by arrows, solid lines denote robust correlation with partner genes, and dashed
  lines indicate statistically significant but less frequent correlations. Upregulated
  genes after SIRT6 knockdown are represented in red color whereas downregulated are
  shown in green. Uncolored nodes indicate genes not tested in the RT-qPCR array.
  (B) IPA was further used to explore the functions of SIRT6-modulated genes. The
  functional annotations leading to inhibition are denoted with blue dotted lines.
  Findings inconsistent with the state of downstream molecules are represented with
  the dark yellow dotted lines.
