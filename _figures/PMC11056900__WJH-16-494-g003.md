caption: 'Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum-associated signaling regulates the
  molecular mechanism of chronic liver disease. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) initiates Ca2+ efflux from Insp3 and Ca ion channels,
  and the Ser36 site is dephosphorylated and can be transferred to mitochondria-associated
  ER membranes (MAMs) to mediate ROS production. ROS promotes Ca2+ in the ER to flow
  to the mitochondria through the MAMs and increases mitochondrial ROS production,
  and conversely, the increase in ROS affects Ca2+ and initiates the opening of permeability
  transition pores, and the swelling of the mitochondria causes the rupture of the
  outer membrane, which can lead to oxidative damage to DNA and cause adenosine triphosphate
  depletion. Beclinl and PINK1/Parkin mediate mitochondrial autophagy, and together
  with PINKI, promote an increase in MAMs and omegasome formation. Excessive accumulation
  of ROS leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of the ATF6, IRE1, and
  PERK, the three unfolded protein response pathways, and the up-regulation of NF-κB
  activity, promoting the secretion of hepatocyte inflammatory factors and chemokines,
  leading to functional deterioration of hepatocytes. MAMs: Mitochondria-associated
  ER membranes; ERS: Endoplasmic reticulum stress; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate'
