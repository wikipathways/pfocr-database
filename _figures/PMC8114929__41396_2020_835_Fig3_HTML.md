caption: a To enable signalling between plants and bacteria, a synthetic biosynthesis
  pathway has been engineered into barley and Medicago that facilitates production
  of the rhizopine scyllo-inosamine (SI) from myo-inositol []. b SI biosensor plasmids
  encoding the periplasmic rhizopine-binding protein MocB and rhizopine-dependent
  transcription factor MocR can be introduced into bacteria enabling genes placed
  downstream of the rhizopine-inducible promoter PmocB to be expressed under rhizopine
  control. c SI signalling circuitry can be used to establish plant host-specific
  expression of rhizobacterial PGP genes, effectively coupling interactions in the
  field and preventing growth promotion of non-target plants. SI signalling could
  also be used to enrich the rhizosphere for engineered bacteria that carry the catabolic
  moc gene which permits utilisation of SI as a sole carbon and nitrogen source [,
  , ]. Like most signalling circuitry, the functionality of SI signalling is not ubiquitous
  across bacterial taxa. By bringing biosynthesis of a secondary signalling molecule
  such as DAPG depicted here, under SI control, the SI signal could be relayed to
  diverse bacteria carrying a second cognate inducible or derepressible promoter system
  such as the DAPG-dependent system controlled by PhlF. SI signalling could also be
  integrated to control multi-layered biocontainment systems such as that described
  by Ronchel et al. [] where the essential acdS gene and lacI repressor, targeted
  for the gef toxin, are each expressed in response to an external stimulus. Integration
  of this signal could restrict proliferation of engineered rhizobacteria to the rhizosphere.
