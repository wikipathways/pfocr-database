caption: Figure 1. Aging and rejuvenation of adult myogenesis. In young muscle, injury
  upregulates the Notch ligand, Delta-like 1, which activates Notch signaling. Active
  Notch promotes a G0 to G1 transition in muscle stem cells after an injury; interplay
  between Notch and Wnt controls myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation.
  In old muscle, which regenerates poorly, in addition to a suppression of activation
  of Notch pathway following injury, there is also an excess of signaling via the
  TGFβ and Wnt pathways, leading to a suppression of myogenesis and a promotion of
  fibrosis. Notch, Wnt and likely other signaling pathways are regulated by systemic
  niche / circulatory milieu, such that in the aged environment, systemic signals
  contribute to the activities that inhibit myogenesis and promote fibrosis. By contrast,
  in the setting of heterochronic parabiosis, young systemic factors restore more
  youthful states and are able to rejuvenate the aged stem cells and stem cell niches
  to promote enhanced muscle regeneration. .
