caption: A sample gene regulatory network. Illustration of the impact of a hypothetical
  external perturbation on a small portion of the Pancreatic Cancer pathway. The pathway
  is taken from the KEGG database. The solid rectangles denote the genes affected
  directly by perturbation, the dashed rectangles indicate genes secondarily affected
  through the networks. The dotted rectangles denote the genes without any change
  in expression. → implies activation and ⊣ implies inhibition. In this figure, genes
  K-Ras, Raf and Cob42Roc are primarily affected and MEK, Ral and RalGDS are secondarily
  affected through interactions.
