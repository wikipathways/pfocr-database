caption: Overall view of HA roles in the cancer metabolic pathway. Cancer cells exhibit
  a high rate of glucose consumption for intracellular energy metabolism and macromolecule
  biosynthesis. Elevated HA biosynthesis accelerates the HBP along with a metabolic
  shift towards glycolysis. The enhanced HBP flux subsequently activates HIF-1 signaling,
  which is responsible for glycolytic enhancement. HIF-1 regulates the expression
  of key glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase (PK), 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase
  (PFK-1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 and 3 (PFKFB2/3),
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), and LDH []. As a consequence of the Warburg
  effect, the lactate is exported to the extracellular space via MCT1 and MCT4 and
  generates an acidic tumor microenvironment. HA-CD44 interactions promote the localization
  of EMMPRIN (CD147), MCT1, and MCT4 in the plasma membrane to efflux lactate. HA
  forms a HA-rich TME to facilitate monocyte/macrophage infiltration and cancer progression.
