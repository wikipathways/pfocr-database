caption: Schematic representation of the main components of the S. cerevisiae Hog1p
  and Pkc1p pathways. (A) The HOG pathway. Two osmosensors, Sho1p and Sln1p, stimulate
  the HOG MAP kinase cascade by different mechanisms. Activation of this MAP kinase
  cascade leads to the phosphorylation of the Hog1 MAP kinase, which is then imported
  into the nucleus. Four putative nuclear targets of Hog1p (Msn1p, Msn2p, Msn3p, and
  Hot1p) are also shown. (B) The Pkc1p pathway. Dotted arrows indicate activation
  of the Pkc1 pathway in which the detailed mechanisms of signal transduction are
  not yet known.
