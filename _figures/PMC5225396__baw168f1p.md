caption: Possible roles of lncRNAs played in the context of RNA-RNA interactions.
  (a) Modulating alternative splicing events through masking splice sites and other
  splicing signals (b) Abrogation of miRNA functions by blocking miRNA target sites;
  (c) Triggering RNA editing by creating dsRNA substrates for ADAR enzymes (d) Guiding
  protein-coding transcripts to degradation in a SMD pathway. Provided are examples
  of lncRNAs and differentially expressed genes predicted to be under their control.
  The genes belong to TGF-β, Hippo and Wnt-related signaling pathways and they all
  are downregulated in KTCN (marked with down arrows).
