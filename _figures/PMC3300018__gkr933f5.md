caption: BER of AP sites in S. pombe. AP sites in S. pombe are mainly repaired by
  the short-patch BER pathway (thick arrows), initiated by incision of the AP site
  by Nth1, leaving 5′-P and 3′-dRP ends. The lethal 3′-block is further processed
  to a 3′-OH by the 3′-phosphodiester activity of Apn2. A DNA polymerase and a DNA
  ligase finally complete the repair by filling the gap and sealing the nick. Alternatively,
  Apn2 initiates repair by incision of the AP site leaving a 5′-dRP end, which can
  be further processed by long-patch (strand displacement synthesis and subsequent
  cleavage of the 5′-flap by Rad2) or short-patch BER (gap insertion and 5′-dRP lyase
  by SpPol4). Apn2 participates in both long-patch and short-patch BER. In this study,
  we propose an AP endonuclease independent branch of BER in S. pombe with Tdp1 working
  as a backup of Apn2 in the repair of 3′-dRP termini left after Nth1 cleavage. Pnk1
  is suggested to work downstream of Tdp1 by processing the 3′-P generated by Tdp1,
  leaving a 3′-OH. Finally, repair is completed by a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase.
