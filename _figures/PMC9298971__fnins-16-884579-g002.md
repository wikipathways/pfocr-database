caption: Gut-brain axis. Obesity or high nutrition diets lead to alterations of gut
  microbiome composition. There is an increase in Firmicutes phyla and the metabolites
  (butyrate) they yield, while Bacteroidetes phyla and their productions (propionate)
  decrease. The change of the enteric microbiome influences brain function directly
  or indirectly through vagal, endocrine, and immune pathways. Metabolites directly
  activate vagal afferents and transfer signaling to the brain in the vagal pathways.
  In the endocrine pathway, enteroendocrine L cells release gut hormones such as glucagon-like
  peptide 1 (GLP1), peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and so on, which can
  in turn influence learning, memory and mood. In the immune pathway, immune cells
  like T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 17 (Th17), regulatory T cell (Treg), neutrophils,
  and macrophages are stimulated. Additionally, intestinal mucosal permeability and
  transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) are altered. CCK, cholecystokinin;
  GLP1, glucagonlike peptide 1; PYY, peptide YY; TEER, transepithelial electrical
  resistance; Th1, T helper 1; Th17, T helper 17; Treg, regulatory T cell.
