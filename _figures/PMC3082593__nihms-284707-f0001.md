caption: The non-mevalonate pathway is the exclusive route to isoprenoid biosynthesis
  in eubacteria and the malaria parasite, P. falciparum. This pathway generates the
  basic isoprenoid building blocks IPP and DMAPP, which are elaborated to create diverse
  downstream products. Cell-permeable alcohol analogs of phosphorylated metabolites,
  such as ME (analog of MEP) and GG-ol (analog of GG-PP) are indicated by dotted arrows.
  Enzyme names in bold.
