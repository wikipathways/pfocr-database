caption: In peripheral T cells, Mst1 is activated after TCR ligation, followed by
  FoxO1/3 activation, which is important for ROS regulation and survival of na誰ve
  T cells. Mst1 might also be activated by Rapl through TCR ligation during migration
  to lymphoid organs, resulting in LFA-1 clustering, as recently reported by others
  , . Arrow size indicates intensity of activation of its target.
