caption: Mechanisms involved in mutant p53 exerting GOF effects. (A) The functional
  modes involved in mutant p53 exerting GOF effects. I) Mutant p53 binds novel sites
  to induce transactivation of target genes. II) Mutant p53 interacts with other TFs
  to induce transactivation of target genes. III) Mutant p53 inhibits other TFs via
  protein-protein interactions to disrupt the expression of genes targeted by those
  TFs. (B) The effects of GOF produced by mutant p53 in tumors. The triple complex
  formed by NF-Y, mutant p53 and P300 proteins can promote the expression of NF-Y
  target genes, including cyclin A and CDK1, thus enhancing DNA synthesis to copy
  with DNA damage. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, mutant p53 participates
  in transcriptional regulation of its target genes including MYC, SMARCD1 and AMPK
  to promote cell proliferation by binding to their DNA domains. By binding to DNA
  regions, mutant p53 can regulate the expression of particular ncRNAs, including
  lincRNA-p21, lncMIR205HG, miR-205-5p and circPVT1, leading to apoptosis, proliferation
  and DNA damage repair. p53 regulates the upregulation of the IL17 signaling pathway
  in the tumor microenvironment and depletes CD8+ cells, thus abolishing the immunotherapeutic
  effect of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in OSCC. Mutant p53 exerts GOF activity by
  interacting with p63 and p73 to inhibit the expression of related proteins, including
  PUMA/Bax, to inhibit apoptosis. GOF, gain-of-function; TF, transcription factor;
  NF-Y, nuclear transcription factor Y subunit α; CDK1, cyclin dependent kinase 1;
  ncRNAs, noncoding RNAs; IL17, interleukin 17; OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma;
  RE, response element; PD-1, programmed cell death protein-1; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X; PUMA, p21/p53 upregulated modulator of
