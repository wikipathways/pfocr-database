caption: 'Proposed coloboma mechanism in Lrp6-null eyes and a possible signaling network
  during early eye development. A: Genetic deletion of Lrp6 severely reduces expression
  of the dorsal retina marker genes and leads to substantial reduction or elimination
  of the dorsal retina territory in Lrp6-null embryos, resulting in dorsal expansion/shift
  of ventral neural retina territory. The dorsal shifting of the ventral retina may
  lead to coloboma in the ventral eye region. Arrowhead indicates the closure site
  of the optic cup/optic fissure at embryonic day (E) 10.5. B: We propose a possible
  molecular mechanism or a signaling network for early eye development that Lrp6 (and
  its mediated canonical Wnt signaling pathway) is acting upstream of the Bmp4 and
  RA signaling pathways in the dorsal eye region and plays significant roles in establishing
  dorsoventral retina boundaries and related morphogenetic movements. The known roles
  of Bmp4 and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathways for early eye development are
  summarized from the literature. Dashed arrows indicate direct or indirect regulations.
  Solid arrows indicate the direct regulations.'
