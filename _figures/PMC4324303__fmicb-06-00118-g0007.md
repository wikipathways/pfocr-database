caption: Model of As (V) and As (III) signaling. A schematic representation of the
  MAPK pathways involved in arsenic signaling is depicted. As (V) triggers phosphorylation
  of both, HOG and CWI pathways. As (V) signaling requires Ssk1 suggesting that signal
  comes from outside the cell. Hog1 and Mkc1 phosphorylation may mediate transcription
  of genes involved in its detoxification or tolerance. As (III) triggers Hog1 phosphorylation
  and therefore, HOG pathway may control the transcription of genes involved in As
  (III) detoxification. As (III) signaling is independent of Ssk1 and others elements
  involves in Cek1 phosphorylation (Sho1, Opy2, and Msb2) but requires Ssk2 and Pbs2.
  The As (III) signaling may enter through an unknown element (represented as a question
  mark) or may enter the cells triggering Hog1 phosphorylation avoiding the three
  components system (Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1).
