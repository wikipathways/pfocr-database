caption: A hypothetical diagram of sirt4 gene regulation by serotonin (5-HT) in the
  preoptic area (POA) of intact adult, chronic citalopram (CIT) treated adult and
  aged animals. (A) In the intact adult, sirt4 gene expression levels do not change;
  (B) in the chronic CIT treated adult, the inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake results in
  decreased presynaptic 5-HT content (pathway ①) or desensitization of postsynaptic
  receptors that could subsequently be less activated in the presence of normal, or
  even increased, synaptic 5-HT concentrations (pathway ②), either of which can result
  in decreased 5-HT neurotransmission and increased sirt4 gene expression; (C) in
  aged animals, the serotonergic system may be impaired by decreased 5-HT synthesis
  (pathway ③) or a decrease in postsynaptic 5-HT receptors (dotted receptor) (pathway
  ④) to explain sirt4 upregulation, or an unknown age related effect could increase
  sirt4 gene expression. These 5-HT signaling pathways could facilitate sirt4 gene
  expression in the POA leading to reproductive and cognitive failure.  5-HT receptors  Desensitized
  5-HT receptors  Decrease 5-HT receptors  5-HT transporter  re-uptake  Inhibition
  of re-uptake  increase  No change in gene expression, ① decrease 5-HT neurotransmission,
