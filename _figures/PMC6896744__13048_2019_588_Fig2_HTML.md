caption: Schematic overview of the hedgehog signaling pathway and some inhibitors
  of the pathway in preclinical and clinical revisions. a In the absence of HH ligands,
  PTCH inhibits the role of SMO, and GLI proteins are changed by proteosomes to the
  transcriptional repressor form (GLIR). b Interaction of HH ligands with PTCH unrepresses
  SMO and creates activated GLI factors (GLIA) which encourage transcription of downstream
  HH genes. The bound of HH/PTHC complex develops adopted in the endosome and degraded
