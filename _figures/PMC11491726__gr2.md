caption: The relationship of class I HDACs and NOXs in CVDs. HDAC1 and HDAC2 up-regulate
  NOX1/4/5 promoter activities, affect NOX expression and the production of superoxide
  and H2O2 partly through JAK/STAT signaling pathway. HDAC3 inhibits Nrf2 activation
  by promoting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction which promotes NOX4-associated H2O2 production
