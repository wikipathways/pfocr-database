caption: 'Structural mapping and trafficking model of Kir2.1. (A) A model for the
  Kir2.1 monomer was generated using AlphaFold2 (accession #P63252) (). Interestingly,
  the AlphaFold2 predicted structure for Kir2.1 reveals an extended alpha-helix spanning
  residues 358–388 that is not observed in the crystal structures for Kir channels
  as this region was removed from the protein prior to crystallization. For simplicity,
  a dimer of Kir2.1 subunits is shown, rather than the tetramer that would typically
  exist at the PM. The left subunit on our dimer denotes binding motifs for trafficking
  factors and the right subunit highlights disease-causing mutations associated with
  aberrant Kir2.1 trafficking. Left: Selectivity filter (pink), Mg2+/spermine binding
  site (gray and green where it overlaps with a cholesterol binding residue), cholesterol
  binding residues (yellow except where they overlap with a Mg2+/spermine binding
  site [light green], a Cav3 binding site [dark green], or a PIP2 binding site [orange]),
  Cav3 binding site (CBS, bright green and one dark green where it overlaps with a
  cholesterol binding site), PIP2 binding residues (red and one orange where it overlaps
  with a cholesterol binding site), Yxxϕ motif (pink), AP-1 binding site (blue), GRIF-1
  interaction region (tan), and ER export signal (purple). Right: The side chains
  of residues mutated in disease and linked to defective protein trafficking are shown
  as spheres. Text indicating the specific mutation associated with each is color-coordinated.
  (B) Trafficking model of Kir2.1 highlighting interacting components at each stage
  including: Golgin-97, AP-1, GRIF-1, dynamin, Rac1, retromer, and ESCRT. Purple arrows
  indicate well-studied trafficking routes for Kir2.1 whereas the red arrow denotes
  a putative endosome-Golgi recycling pathway. MVB, multivesicular bodies; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; PM, plasma membrane.'
