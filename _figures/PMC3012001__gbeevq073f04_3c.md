caption: 'The proposed chloroplast signal transduction pathway coupling the redox
  state of the photosynthetic electron carrier plastoquinone in the chloroplast thylakoid
  membrane with initiation of transcription of chloroplast DNA at the promoter regions
  of the genes psa (encoding reaction center proteins of photosystem I) and psb (encoding
  reaction center proteins of photosystem II). (A) Under light 1, a rate-limiting
  low light selective for photosystem I, electron flow through photosystem I (PS I)
  has a greater potential than that through photosystem II (PS II), and so PQ pool
  is maintained in its oxidized form. CSK is autophosphorylated and active as a protein
  kinase using both SIG-1 and PTK as substrates: SIG-1 and PTK are thus maintained
  in their phosphorylated forms. Phospho-SIG-1 represses transcription at the psa
  promoter while allowing transcription of psb genes. Phospho-PTK is inactive; therefore,
  it cannot suppress chloroplast transcription nonspecifically, and under this circumstance,
  only CSK-mediated—via phospho-SIG-1—specific repression of psa genes occurs. This
  differential reaction center gene transcription increases the stoichiometry of photosystem
  II relative to photosystem I. (B) Under light 2, a rate-limiting low light selective
  for photosystem II, electron flow through photosystem I (PS I) has a lower potential
  than that through photosystem II (PS II), and so PQ pool is maintained in its reduced
  form (PQH2). CSK is inactive as a protein kinase. The repression of psa genes, occurred
  during light 1, is now relieved by the action of a PEP phosphatase that catalyzes
  dephosphorylation of phospho-SIG-1. As a result, PS I transcription increases. Under
  this light condition, PTK is active as a protein kinase acting on subunits of PEP.
  However, the action of PEP phosphatase overrides PTK activity by dephosphorylating
  both SIG-1 as well as PEP subunits so that nonspecific repression of reaction center
  genes is counteracted. The increase in photosystem I transcription in light 2, therefore,
  leads to an increase in photosystem I units relative to photosystem II.'
