caption: 'Metabolic alterations in prostate cancer as a consequence of reduced zinc
  levels. (a) In healthy prostate epithelial cells, a high intake of zinc inhibits
  the conversion of citrate to isocitrate, causing accumulation of citrate. Increased
  aspartate intake functions as a carbon source for citrate production. (b) In malignant
  prostate epithelial cells, reduced levels of zinc lead to citrate being utilized
  further into the TCA cycle. Abbreviation: NAA = N-acetylaspartate.'
