caption: Potential strategies during the first few days of F. graminearum infection
  (biotrophic phase) in wheat continuously infested by S. avenae. S. avenae and their
  endosymbionts excrete a large amount of honeydew, which may provide ready-to-use
  carbon and nitrogen nutrients to accelerate the colonization of F. graminearum.
  To diminish the SA-dependent responses induced by aphid preinfestation, F. graminearum
  could metabolize exogenous SA as a source of carbon or manipulate host physiology
  to produce auxins that would fine-tune the host immune response. Auxins may attenuate
  the SA-dependent responses, possibly by activating the expression of JA biosynthesis-related
  genes and JA-regulated defense genes. Red solid lines represent the hormone-mediated
  upregulation (arrow) or inhibition (blunt-end line). Black blunt-end lines represent
  the inhibitory effects between the transcription factors. Moreover, F. graminearum
  significantly upregulates the expression of genes associated with the plant cell
  wall-degrading enzymes. Steel blue triangles depict the plant cell wall-degrading
  enzymes secreted by F. graminearum. Green lines and arrows indicate the pathways
  for IAA, JA, and SA signaling. Pink arrows indicate the pathway by which IAA weakens
  the plant cell wall. Blue lines and arrows indicate the pathways of SA degradation.
