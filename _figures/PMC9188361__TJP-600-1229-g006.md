caption: Depending on liver glycogen content some dietary glucose bypasses liver and
  enters the systemic circulation. From there glucose is taken up by non‐contracting
  muscles, particularly red and intermediate fibres (James et al. , ). Glycolysis
  in these and other driver tissues results in lactate release into the central venous
  circulation and uptake by the recipient liver from the arterial circulation. Paradoxically,
  this circuitous, ‘indirect pathway,’ is preferred over glucose for hepatic glycogen
  synthesis (Foster, ). In contrast, glucose from dietary consumption or digestion
  or carbohydrate in the GI tract can be taken up by liver on the first circulatory
  pass for ‘direct’ glycogen synthesis. Again as indicated in Fig. , lactate released
  from driver cells and tissues supports cerebral metabolic needs (Glenn et al.  a,)
  and functions such as glutamatergic signalling (Pellerin & Magistretti, ). Similarly,
  systemic lactate and fatty acids from digestion serve as an energy source for the
  heart (Bergman et al. 2009a,b). Figures  and  illustrate the extent of lactate shuttling
  under diverse conditions.
