caption: Interestingly, the acetate incorporation pattern observed here is unusual
  for angucycline class natural products (see ). As exemplified by the biosynthesis
  of urdamycin A (17), vineomycin A1, PD116740, kinamycin D and gilvocarcin V (30),
  in the typical ring closure reaction the linear decaketide (18) formed through the
  action of PKS is cyclized into the benz[a]anthracene backbone (19) in a manner in
  which the head (C-20) and the tail (C-2) of the decaketide chain coincide with C-13
  and C-2, respectively, in the cyclic product (18 → 19). A decarboxylation of the
  last acetate unit (at C-2 to release C-1) is a necessary step in this pathway to
  account for the incorporation pattern. While such a mode of skeletal assembly involving
  simple folding and condensation is found for most augucycline-type natural products
  studied thus far, an alternative pathway has been found in the biosynthesis of PD116198
  (32, see ) from Streptomyces phaeochromogenes WP 3688. In this case, chain elongation
  and ring condensation leads to a linearly fused tetracyclic anthracyclinone intermediate
  (20). Subsequent oxidative bond cleavage between C-10a and C-11 followed by rearrangement
  and recylcization are proposed to give the angular angucyclinone core (20 → 21,
  ). Since BE- 7585A displays the same acetate incorporation pattern as PD116198 (32),
  an analogous ring reconstruction via an enzyme-catalyzed Baeyer-Villiger oxidation
  may also be operative in the biosynthesis of 1. Similar oxidative C–C bond cleavages
  of polyketide-derived tetracyclic substrates have also been proposed for the biosynthesis
  of gilvocarcin (30) and jadomycin (31) based on gene disruption and gene complementation
  experiments., Enzymes responsible for this type of reactions are flavin-dependent
  monooxygenases. Notably, a flavin monooxygenase (MtmOIV) catalyzing the Baeyer-Villiger
  ring opening in the biosynthesis of mithramycin (33) was recently characterized
  and its crystal structure determined.,
