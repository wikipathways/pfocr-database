caption: A new synergistic model of AhR up-regulated by PUN against inflammation and
  infection in inflammatory macrophages. The activation of p90RSK served as a critical
  checkpoint for AhR upregulation by PUN and LPS, which induced AhR upregulation by
  activating MEK/ERK and PDK1 pathways that ultimately targeted c-fos. The partial
  activation of p90RSK by LPS-activated MEK-ERK signaling pathway was the basis for
  its full activation. PUN promoted the full activation of p90RSK through PDK1 pathway,
  and then synergistically enhanced c-fos mediated AhR expression with LPS. Furthermore,
  AhR up-regulated by PUN could inhibit macrophage inflammation and promote its bactericidal
  activity
