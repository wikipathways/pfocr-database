caption: Postulated mechanism of PDGF-C-mediated liver fibrosis and tumor in Smad3-dependent
  and -independent signaling pathways. In response to liver injury, PDGF-C is produced
  by various types of cells including hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). PDGF-C binds
  to PDGF receptors, named PDGFR-αα and -αβ, in HSCs. PDGFR-αα signals increase expression
  of PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and cellular retinol binding
  protein 1 (CRBP1) in Smad3-independent pathway. In contrast, heterodimerized receptor
  PDGFR-αβ may activate Smad3 signaling with TGF-β receptor type II (TGF-βRII), leading
  to increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), connective tissue growth
  factor (CTGF), type I collagen-α (COL1A), and proliferation of HSCs. Altogether,
  Smad3-dependent and -independent pathways in HSCs induce liver fibrosis or drive
  progression of liver fibrosis into hepatocellular carcinoma. Solid lines are clarified
  but dot lines remain to be addressed.
