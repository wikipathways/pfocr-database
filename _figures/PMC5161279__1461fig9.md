caption: A model for meiosis II activation in the C. elegans embryo. A model for the
  fertilization-dependent signal that specifies meiosis II is shown. Sperm provide
  a signal involving secreted MSP protein (blue thunderbolt), which, via interactions
  with gonadal sheath cells and the oocyte, triggers oocyte maturation (nuclear envelope
  breakdown, cytoskeletal rearrangement, assembly of MI spindle). This cell will progress
  to anaphase I (blue arrows), but if sperm do not enter the oocyte, the cell will
  abort MI and skip MII. A second signal from the sperm (yellow thunderbolt) is delivered
  upon fertilization. MEMI is likely a maternal component of this signal, in part
  because loss of MEMI also results in a skipped MII phenotype. At least one additional
  component of the signal is the sperm-specific PP1 phosphatase, GSP-3/4 (yellow squares),
  which we identified as a suppressor of hyper-morphic memi-1(sb41). The positive
  influence on the MEMI pathway could occur either directly via GSP-3/4 interaction,
  or indirectly, via another unidentified sperm factor (gray triangle). Evidence from
  mating experiments supports a mechanism that requires GSP-3/4 (or intermediate factor)
  to enter the oocyte. MEMI is required for meiosis II (orange arrow), but must be
  inactivated prior to mitosis (white arrows). CUL-2/ZYG-11-dependent ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation inactivates MEMI before mitosis. The memi-1(sb41) mutation specifically
  interferes with MEMI-1 protein degradation, resulting in defects during the transition
  to mitosis.
