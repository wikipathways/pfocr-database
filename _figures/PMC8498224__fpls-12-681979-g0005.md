caption: Terpene biosynthesis pathway. The schema illustrates the different biosynthesis
  pathways of compounds belonging to the terpene biosynthesis pathway identified in
  cocoa. Compounds known to have a floral taste are noted in purple. The blue arrows
  represent the bridges between the terpene biosynthesis pathway and mevalonate pathways.
  The names of these other biosynthetic pathways are framed in blue. The black arrows
  represent the enzymatic actions. The names of the enzymes are indicated (when identified)
  around these arrows. In green represented the limit of the plastids. In light brown
  are represented the limits of cytosol.
