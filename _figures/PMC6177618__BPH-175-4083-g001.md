caption: Overview of calcium‐sensing receptor signalling and trafficking. The binding
  of calcium (Ca2+) to the CaS receptor extracellular domain leads to Gα11‐dependent
  activation of PLC‐β and the production of DAG and inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate (IP3)
  from membrane‐bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate (PIP2). The increase in
  intracellular IP3 levels facilitates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores
  such as the ER. DAG activates PKC and the MAPK pathway. These signalling events
  lead to a decrease in PTH secretion and reduction in renal tubular calcium reabsorption
  and also enhance insulin release from pancreatic islets. CaS receptor cell‐surface
  expression is regulated by ADIS (Grant et al., ) and also by an endocytic complex
  comprising clathrin, β‐arrestin and the AP2 complex, which may traffic this GPCR
  to the endosomal–lysosomal degradation pathway or recycle the CaS receptor back
  to the cell surface (Breitwieser, ). Loss‐ and gain‐of function mutations of the
  CaS receptor lead to FHH1 and ADH1, respectively; loss‐ and gain‐of function mutations
  of the Gα11 subunit are associated with FHH2 and ADH2, respectively; and loss‐of‐function
  mutations of the AP2σ lead to FHH3.
