caption: This pathway is constructed based on the KEGG pathway. Each coloured cell
  represents the normalized intensity of each compound ion according to the colour
  scale (three biological replicates×two cultivars, n = 6). The expression levels
  of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H),
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase
  (UFGT) are shown.
