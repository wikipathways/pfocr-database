caption: Representative image of the synthesis and regulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in sepsis. Protein arginine methyl
  transferases (PRMT) catalyse the methylation of arginine containing protein residues
  to ADMA and SDMA, which are released upon proteolysis. ADMA and SDMA are transported
  via the y+ cationic amino acid transporter into and out of the circulation. SDMA
  is not metabolised in most cell,s whereas ADMA is metabolised by the two isoforms
  of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) in a wide range of tissues. ADMA
  acts intracellularly to inhibit nitric oxide synthase (NOS), SDMA has no action
  on NOS isoforms. SDMA is cleared by the kidney largely unchanged and in small part
  through metabolism by AGXT2 (not shown). ADMA is largely metabolised by DDAH to
  dimethylamine (DMA); a small amount is cleared unchanged through the kidney. In
  sepsis, the synthesis of ADMA and SDMA may be increased through high protein-turnover
  in patients in a catabolic state and reduced renal clearance as a consequence of
  acute kidney injury. Differences in the relative concentrations of these methylarginines
  reflect their differential metabolism by DDAH isoforms as only ADMA is a DDAH substrate.
  Note, monomethylarginine (L-NMMA) is considered to have the same synthetic pathway,
  activity, metabolism and clearance as ADMA but is present in only 10% of the concentration
