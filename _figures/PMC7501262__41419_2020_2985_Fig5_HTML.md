caption: Schematic representation of ncRNAs upregulated or downregulated in multiple
  endothelial dysfunction-related disease models. These ncRNAs mediate endothelial
  dysfunction by directly or indirectly activating the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
  pathway. The reported diseases mainly include myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
  injury, sepsis-induced brain injury, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2MD), diabetic retinopathy,
  and atherosclerosis. Moreover, miR-20b can be downregulated in H2O2-treated endothelial
  cells (ECs) and induces EC senescence by activating NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition,
  miR-101-3p is downregulated in serum deprivation-induced EC apoptosis, which is
  partially induced by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. In this
  figure, the red upward arrow indicates upward adjustment, and the black downward
  arrow indicates downward adjustment.
