caption: Upon activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway downstream
  of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, AKT is thought to be the major kinase
  that inactivates GSK3 via phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residue (S21
  in GSK3α and S9 in GSK3β) (1). Phosphorylation of GSK3β (but not GSK3α) at S389
  by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) might be an alternative mechanism
  for inactivation (2). GSK3 regulation in the Wnt pathway is distinct from the way
  by which RTK signaling inhibits GSK3. In the canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt signaling
  recruits the destruction complex to the membrane, leading to the phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic tail of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)
  5/6 by casein kinase (CK) and GSK3β. Phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs in the LRP5/6
  intracellular domain directly inhibit GSK3’s activity towards β-catenin (3) , .
  In neuronal progenitor cells, a recent study showed that Disrupted in schizophrenia
  (DISC) 1 directly interacts with GSK3 and prevents it from phosphorylating β-catenin
  (4). Both in the Wnt and the RTK signaling pathways, GSK3 activity is also regulated
  by polarity proteins (5). GSK3 interacts with the Par complex — composed of Par3,
  Par6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) — and so becomes phosphorylated and inactivated.
  Although phosphorylation of GSK3 occurs as a consequence, GSK3 phosphorylation is
  not required for its inactivation. β-cat, β-catenin; Dvl, dishevelled; Fz, Frizzled;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; RAP1b, Ras-related
  protein 1b.
