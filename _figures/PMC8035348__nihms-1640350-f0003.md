caption: 'Mechanistic role of the miRNAs in PDAC: miRNAs can act both as tumor suppressors
  and oncogenes by regulating different key downstream gene targets that mediate cellular
  growth signaling pathways. For example, miR-217 which is often found downregulated
  in PDAC, acts as a tumor suppressor and targets KRAS oncogene which endows proliferation,
  survival and invasion properties onto cancer cells through the activation of several
  downstream effector pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and the RAF/ERK pathway. On the
  other hand, miR-21, which is usually found upregulated in PDAC, targets the tumor
  suppressor genes PTEN and PDCD4. miR-21 mediated inhibition of PTEN leads into activated
  downstream signaling of PI3K/AKT pathway. PDCD4, a tumor suppressor gene involved
  in apoptosis, invasion is inhibited by miR-21 and is potentially involved in PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. miRNAs can also induce transcriptional repression or activation
  by modulating chromatin structure through the targeting of epigenetic regulatory
  genes. For example, miR-342-3p can act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer
  cell proliferation and invasion through targeting DNMT1.'
