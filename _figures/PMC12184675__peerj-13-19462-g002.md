caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple apoptotic pathways. The viral Orf3a
  protein activates PERK signaling, which upregulatesBak/Bax, leading to the activation
  ofcaspase-9 and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Additionally, viral proteins Orf6,
  Orf7a, and NSP6 interact with host cellular components to activatedeath receptor-mediated
  extrinsic apoptosis, involving TRAF2, TRADD, FADD, RIP, and cIAPs, which facilitate
  the activation ofcaspase-8. Caspase-8 further promotes apoptosis by cleaving downstream
  effector caspases, ultimately resulting in widespreadlung epithelial cell deathandpulmonary
  injury. This mechanistic insight underscores the pathological impact of SARS-CoV-2
  on lung tissues and highlights potential therapeutic targets to mitigate severe
  COVID-19 outcomes
