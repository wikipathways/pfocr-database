caption: Interaction of SPX1, SPX2 and SPX4 with PHR under high or low P conditions.
  Under high P conditions, SPX1 and SPX2 in the nucleus and SPX4 in the cytoplasm
  bind PHR with high affinity, thus inhibiting PHR binding to the P1BS motif in the
  promoters of PSI genes and leading to repression of the transcription of PSI genes,
  including SPX1 and SPX2. Under low P conditions, SPX4 in the cytoplasm is degraded
  via the 26S proteasome pathway, which promotes the targeting of PHR to the nucleus,
  thereby releasing PHR to activate downstream PSI gene expression. Meanwhile, SPX1
  and SPX2 in the nucleus interact with PHR at a low affinity, which facilitates PHR
  to bind to the P1BS motif in the promoters of PSI genes, further enhancing the expression
  of PSI genes, including SPX1 and SPX2. The thick arrow denotes enhancement. The
  dotted lines represent reduced effects. This working model is drawn based on the
  studies of SPX1, SPX2 and SPX4 genes in Arabidopsis and rice (Lv et al. []; Wang
  et al. [,]; Zhou et al. []; Puga et al. []).
