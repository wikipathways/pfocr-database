caption: Overview of heme synthesis. Heme synthesis requires the activity of its pathway
  enzymes (indicated in red ovals). The activities of these enzymes are regulated
  by interaction with mitochondrial homeostasis proteins such as CLPX and ABCB10.
  Heme synthesis is also regulated by transport proteins such as TMEM14C, and transport
  of iron via the MFRN proteins. Many transporters of heme intermediates have yet
  to be identified. Pharmacological inhibitors of heme synthesis enzymes such as itaconyl-CoA
  (inhibitor of ALAS (63, 153)), succinylacetone (inhibitor of PBGS/ALAD ()) and acifluorfen
  (inhibitor of PPOX (; )) are powerful tools to probe the regulatory mechanisms of
  the heme synthesis pathway.
