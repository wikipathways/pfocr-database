caption: a) The cartoon depicts the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), C-type
  lectin receptors (CLRs), RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs), or the cGAS-STING axis, engaging
  NF-κB, MAPK, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)–IRF7 activation for the transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes [, , ]. Fungal ligands bind the CLR dectin 1
  and signal through the dectin 1–SYK pathway to activate NF-kB signaling. TLR signaling
  through MYD88 activates the NF-kB pathway, whereas TRIF-dependent TLR signaling
  primarily involves IRF3 and IRF7 activation. The depiction is based on results from
  human and murine studies. b) Inflammasome sensors can interact directly with their
  target ligand or respond to a variety of physiological changes. This leads to the
  recruitment of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation
  and recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase 1 (CASP1) to form an inflammasome complex.
  CASP1 then undergoes proximity-induced autocatalytic cleavage to take on its active
  form. Activated CASP1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to release the N-terminal domain,
  which oligomerizes in the plasma membrane and forms pores, thereby inducing cell
  death through pyroptosis. Activated CASP1 also cleaves pro–interleukin (IL)-1β and
  pro–IL-18 into their active forms, which are released through the GSDMD pores [].
  The depiction is based on results from human and murine studies. MAVS, mitochondria
  antiviral signaling; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5.
