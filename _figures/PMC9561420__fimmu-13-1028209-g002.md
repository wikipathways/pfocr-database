caption: Metabolic and immune mechanisms for the link between airway or gut microbiota
  and asthma. (A) shows immune mechanisms for the airway epithelial cell signaling
  in response to bacterial pathogens. Various bacterial pathogens bind to innate sensors
  TLR2 and TLR4 and further activate MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. MyD88 recruits
  TRAF6, which further activates the IKK complex, allows NF-кB to translocate into
  the nucleus, and leads to the overall production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
  and activation of T cells. Additionally, recognition of various bacterial pathogens
  activates the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, which involves the recruitment of
  TRIF, that leads to subsequent activation of TBK1 and IKKϵ along with induction
  of transcription factor IRF3. This signaling pathway results in interferon-related
  cytokines, and can potentiate NF-κB gene transcription. Enhanced neutrophil TLR2
  and TLR4 signaling by bacterial pathogens promote neutrophils cytokine production
  and NETosis, a program for formation of NETs. Bacterial pathogens can also be recognized
  by TLR2 and TLR4 on macrophages, leading to activation of NF-κB and IRF3 signaling
  pathway and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Macrophages can also function as
  APC and regulate T cell activation. The T cell is presented an antigen with MHC
  II by APC. The recognition of the antigen-MHC II complex and the co-stimulatory
  molecules activates the T cell and leads downstream to differentiation into TH2
  and TH17 cells, that can release various cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13,
  which lead to eosinophilic inflammation. APC, antigen-presenting cell; IKK, inhibitory
  kappa B kinases; IL, interleukin; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; MHC, major
  histocompatibility complex; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein
  88; NETosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation; NETs, neutrophil extracellular
  traps; NF-кB, nuclear factor kappa B; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; TH2, T helper
  2; TH17, T helper 17; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor
  associated factor 6; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β.
  (B) shows metabolic and immune mechanisms for the link between gut microbiota and
  asthma. PSA from Bacteroides fragilis induces and ligates TLR2 on pDC, which stimulate
  anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion by CD4+ T cells. cDC and macrophage bound
  by gut microbiota show impaired ability to promote TH2- and TH17-type responses
  and tend to promote TH1-type responses and Treg proliferation, which lead to decreased
  eosinophilic inflammation. IL-10 dependent reprogramming of tissue macrophages is
  also essential for resolving inflammation by promoting M2 macrophage polarization.
  Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium can digest the fiber and produce SCFAs, such as
  butyrate. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increases SCFAs level, such as butyrate and
  propionate, which leads to reduced levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and elevated
  level of Tregs. cDC, classical dendritic cell; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin;
  pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; PSA, polysaccharide A; SCFAs, short-chain fatty
  acids; TH2, T helper 2; TH17, T helper 17; TLR, Toll-like receptor; Treg, regulatory
  T cell.
