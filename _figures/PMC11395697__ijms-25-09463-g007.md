caption: Gut microbiome–host interactions in colorectal cancer development. The gut
  microbiome plays a crucial role in influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) development
  and progression. This schematic image illustrates the presence of both potentially
  pro-carcinogenic pathogens, including Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), Peptostreptococcus,
  Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli), as well as beneficial probiotic species
  like Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis). These
  microbes interact with the colonic epithelium, influencing the proliferation of
  CRC cells and the process of tumorigenesis. For instance, B. fragilis and E. coli
  can promote CRC progression by activating the TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway. B. fragilis
  secretes polysaccharide A (PSA), which acts as a TLR2-specific agonist. The binding
  of PSA to TLR2 leads to downstream NF-κB activation, a key transcription factor
  that promotes CRC cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. NF-κB
  signaling induced by PSA enhances CRC growth and development by increasing pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8, leading to chronic inflammation and fostering CRC
  progression. PSA also stimulates TLR2 expression on colon and CRC cells, creating
  a positive feedback loop wherein higher TLR2 levels induce greater NF-κB responses
  to repeated PSA, driving cell proliferation. PSA protects CRC cells from chemotherapy
  and activates NF-κB survival signaling as well. Meanwhile, B. fragilis lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) engages TLR4, stimulating NF-κB -mediated expression of genes for survival,
  invasion, and angiogenesis in CRC tissues with co-expressed TLR4 and NF-κB. LPS
  increases cytokines like IL-1β and IL-6 via NF-κB, fueling tumor growth and metastasis.
  It also induces COX-2 and EMT through NF-κB. E. coli LPS also can bind TLR4, triggering
  MyD88 recruitment and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via
  NOX1 upregulation in a NF-κB -dependent manner. Elevated mitochondrial ROS activates
  MAPKs and IKB oxidation, as well as nuclear translocating NF-κB. This underscores
  the importance of maintaining a balanced gut microbiome to modulate the tumor microenvironment
  and potentially prevent or manage CRC development. Figure created using BioRender
