caption: Intracellular tachyzoites co-utilize glucose and glutamine scavenged from
  the host and both carbon sources are catabolized in mitochondria via a canonical
  oxidative TCA cycle (left panel). Glucose is also used to fuel the FASII-dependent
  pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis in the apicoplast. Inhibition of tachyzoite aconitase
  (comprising mitochondrial and apicoplast isoforms) results in a reduction of FASII
  biosynthesis, providing evidence that a citrate shunt between the mitochondrion
  and apicoplast (brown lines) is at least partially required for regeneration of
  reducing equivalents for apicoplast fatty acid synthesis. Tachyzoites are likely
  exposed to elevated glucose levels following host cell egress (right panel). However,
  these stages continue to co-utilize glutamine and are dependent on operation of
  the TCA cycle for most of their ATP synthesis and normal gliding motility. The GABA
  shunt identified in this study involves at least three enzymes and a putative mitochondrial
  transporter (steps not shown). GABA accumulated under glutamine-replete conditions
  may function as a short-term energy reserve under nutrient limiting conditions.
