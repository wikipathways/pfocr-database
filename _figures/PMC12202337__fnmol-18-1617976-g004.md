caption: Crosstalk between ERK signaling pathway and other myelination regulators.
  The ERK signaling pathway may interact with other pathways that control myelination.
  C-Jun has been recognized as a negative regulator of myelination. Notch signaling,
  via its intracellular domain (NICD), also functions as a negative regulator of myelination.
  Strong upregulation of c-Jun and the Notch ligand jagged-1 occurs in Schwann cells
  after Raf fstimulation, indicating that c-Jun and Notch pathway are downstream of
  the ERK signaling pathway. C-Jun and Notch pathway inhibit Schwann cell differentiation
  and myelination by interfering with Krox20 activity, thus repressing peripheral
  myelination transcription such as periaxin and P0
