caption: 'Scheme showing the potential molecular events induced in cancer cells in
  the hypoxic tumour microenvironment. The intracellular consequences of decreased
  oxygen level (hypoxia) in cancer cells including the switch of mitochondrial oxidative
  phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis and enhanced nuclear translocation of HIF-α
  subunit are illustrated. The enhanced stabilization and activation of HIF-1α and
  HIF-2α and their formation of nuclear heterodimers with HIF-β receptor in cancer
  cells under hypoxia that in turn may result in the transcriptional activation of
  numerous gene products involved in anaerobic glycolysis, pH regulation, self-renewal,
  survival and induction of angiogenic switch and metastases are indicated. The enhanced
  cellular accumulation and activation of HIF-α protein subunit which may be induced
  through the stimulation of different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in cancer
  cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions are also illustrated. Particularly,
  the stimulation of RTKs may lead to the sustained activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway that in turn may
  induce the translational machinery and HIF protein synthesis and/or enhanced stabilization
  of HIF-α subunit. Moreover, the activation of RTKs may result in the stimulation
  of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) that in turn can induce the transcriptional up-regulation
  of HIFs. ABCG2/BCRP: breast cancer resistance protein; CAIX: carbonic anhydrase
