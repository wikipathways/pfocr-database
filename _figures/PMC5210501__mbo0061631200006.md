caption: Pathway of stringent response with relA hydrolase mutation. During stress
  response, RelA (RSH/SpoT homolog in VRE) and RelQ are responsible for the production
  of the alarmone (red circles). In the relA mutants, a missense mutation adjacent
  to an active site in the hydrolysis domain led to increased resting levels of ppGpp.
  Cells were “primed” to respond faster to stress in a biofilm, which included antibiotic
  stress in the patient’s case. We propose that the presence of ppGpp downregulated
  multiple nonessential pathways, as shown by the RNA-seq data, including biofilm
  components. Therefore, while the relA mutant was fit to survive in an immunocompromised
  patient, once the immune system was reconstituted, the fitness trade-off of a smaller,
  less robust biofilm would enhance susceptibility to neutrophil killing.
