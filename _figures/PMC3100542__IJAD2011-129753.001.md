caption: GSK-3β regulates the production of microglial inflammatory molecules. GSK-3β
  activation has been shown to increase the production of proinflammatory mediators
  via multiple mechanisms. GSK-3β is able to activate JNK-, STAT3/5- and NF-κB pathways
  leading to increased cytokine and chemokine production. GSK-3β is able to increase
  the binding of coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) to p65 thus enhancing NF-κB
  mediated transcription. Since CREB competes for CBP binding, activation of GSK-3β
  shifts the balance in favor of NF-κB pathway and CREB-mediated induction of IL-10
  is reduced. Moreover, GSK-3β activation leads to proteosomal degradation of beta-catenin,
  thus resulting in reduced inhibition of NF-κB-activation. All these events lead
  to enhanced production of proinflammatory molecules.

  description: GSK-3β regulates the production of microglial inflammatory molecules.
    GSK-3β activation has been shown to increase the production of proinflammatory
    mediators via multiple mechanisms. GSK-3β is able to activate JNK-, STAT3/5- and
    NF-κB pathways leading to increased cytokine and chemokine production. GSK-3β
    is able to increase the binding of coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) to p65

    induction of IL-10 is reduced. Moreover, GSK-3β activation leads to proteosomal
    degradation of beta-catenin, thus resulting in reduced inhibition of NF-κB-activation.
    All these events lead to enhanced production of proinflammatory molecules.
