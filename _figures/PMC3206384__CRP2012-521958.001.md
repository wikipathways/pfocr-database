caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible pathways in which NO modulates collagen
  type I gene expression to affect fibrosis. In the first hypothesis (1), the rapid
  reaction between NO and O2.− leads to decreased NO bioavailability. NO regulation
  by ADMA may also occur. NO normally can directly activate transcription factors
  such as NFκB, SP-1, and AP-1 to inhibit collagen gene expression. The second possibility
  (2) is that NO normally by activating the protective stress enzyme HO-1 can negatively
  modulate the NADPH oxidase pathway. In fibrosis, activation of the NADPH oxidase
  pathway has been shown to increase collagen synthesis and myofibroblast differentiation.
  The third plausible pathway (3) is that there is signalling crosstalk following
  TGF-β binding to a receptor. Signal pathways potentially important here include
  the MAP kinase JNK. This would synergise with the Smad signalling pathway and decrease
  the activation of downstream TGF-β-dependent genes. Alternatively, NO could enhance
  the proteasomal degradation of SMAD. In the fourth pathway (4), NO indirectly exerts
  its effects by modulating oxidative stress through upregulation of antioxidant/redox
  defence genes such as Nrf2 leading to regulation of the extracellular matrix.
