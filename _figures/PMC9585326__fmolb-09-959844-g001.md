  mediated by the insulin pathway (A) Altered disrupted glucose uptake during insulin
  resistance pathology related to an overnutrition state and the main related contributors.
  (B) 1) lipid intermediates such as DAG, ceramides, and AcC which have been associated
  with altered activity of IRS1 and AKT. 2) UPR activation during ER stress with a
  not clear subjacent mechanism, but proposals include JNK activation which affects
  insulin signaling. 3) Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to altered fatty acid
  oxidation and increased ROS production. 4) Altered MAMs that affect the signal transduction
  between ER and mitochondria. Image created with BioRender.com.
