caption: Inflammation and thrombosis in ARDS and how they contribute to PH. Injury
  to the alveolar-capillary interface in ARDS leads to the release of tissue factor
  from the endothelial cells and induces coagulation through the extrinsic pathway.
  The penultimate mediator of coagulation, thrombin (dark red triangle), interacts
  with proteinase-associated receptors (PARs, dark red receptor) to promote inflammation
  (increase in IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10) and suppress several negative regulatory elements
  of coagulation (decrease in Protein C, thrombin antithrombin complexes—TATs, anticoagulants;
  increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1—PAI-1). This leads to downstream effects
  of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) that include vascular remodeling and
  vasoconstriction, which overwhelm the protective effects of anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10 and further incite thrombosis.

  description: Inflammation and thrombosis in ARDS and how they contribute to PH.
    Injury to the alveolar-capillary interface in ARDS leads to the release of tissue

    This leads to downstream effects of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) that
