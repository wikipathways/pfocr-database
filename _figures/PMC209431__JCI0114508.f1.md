caption: Signaling pathways that may mediate eNOS glycosylation and phosphorylation
  in vascular endothelial cells. The left half of the figure shows a model based on
  the results presented by Du et al. in a recent issue of the JCI (). High-glucose
  treatment of endothelial cells is suggested to lead to the augmentation of ROS from
  mitochondria, leading to the activation of the glucosamine pathway by the activation
  of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT, the key enzyme in this
  pathway), ultimately increasing eNOS O-glycosylation. Basal levels of eNOS phosphorylation
  (green) at serine 1179 may be reciprocally attenuated by eNOS O-glycosylation with
  N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc; red). Various eNOS agonist receptors, such as those
  for insulin (), VEGF (), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (), are also shown (right half
  of the figure). These receptors typically reside in or translocate to the caveolae
  (shown here as a membrane invagination). Each of these cell surface receptor pathways
  ultimately converges at the levels of eNOS enzyme activation, but each appears to
  involve distinct intervening calcium-mobilizing and protein kinase pathways to activate
  eNOS (). Growth factors appear to activate both the α and the β isoforms of PI 3-kinase,
  whereas the G protein−coupled EDG-1 receptor activates only the PI 3-β isoform.
  Bradykinin does not appear to activate any PI 3-kinase isoform, and its effects
  are mediated by pertussis toxin−insensitive G proteins. By contrast, the platelet-derived
  agonist sphingosine 1-phosphate activates EDG-1 receptors that are coupled via pertussis
  toxin−sensitive G proteins. The effects of diabetes on these receptor-regulated
  dynamic eNOS phosphorylation pathways remain to be determined. It will be interesting
  to explore whether the counterbalancing of eNOS O-glycosylation and phosphorylation
  influences the development of diabetic vasculopathy, as suggested by Du et al. ().
