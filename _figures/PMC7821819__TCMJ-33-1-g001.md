caption: Modulation of microglia by CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and P2X7R signaling. A schematic
  of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and P2X7R signaling under normal and pathological conditions. The
  CX3CL1/CX3CR1 pathway can stop the activation of mic, whereas ATP binding with P2X7R
  can induce microglial activation. Alzheimer's disease affects the regulation of
  these two signaling molecules, leading to microglial overactivation, thus resulting
  in pathological changes
