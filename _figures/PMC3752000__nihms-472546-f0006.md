caption: Prostaglandin synthesis pathway. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane
  bound phospholipids by phospholipase A2. COX-1 and COX-2 metabolize arachidonic
  acid into PGH2. Specific synthases including hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase
  (HPGDS), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (MPGES), and thromboxane A2 synthase
  (TXAS) metabolizes PGH2 into PGD2, PGE2, and TXA2, respectively. PGD2 can be enzymatically
  converted into 13, 14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD2 by 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase
  (15- PGDH). Additionally, PGD2 nonenzymatically converts, via dehydration, into
  PGJ2 which upon additional dehydration converts into 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-PGJ2. Thromboxane
  A2 synthase produces TXA2 which nonezymatically converts into the stable metabolite,TXB2.
