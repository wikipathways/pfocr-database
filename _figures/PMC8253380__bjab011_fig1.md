caption: Anatomy of the tongue and taste cell renewal. (A) Taste buds (yellow) are
  embedded in taste papillae in the tongue epithelium. The number of taste buds in
  fungiform papillae, which are located in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue,
  is species-dependent; rodent fungiform papillae each contain a single taste bud
  while multiple taste buds can be found in a human fungiform papilla. Hundreds of
  taste buds line the trenches (epithelial invaginations) of foliate and circumvallate
  papillae in the posterior tongue. In human circumvallate papillae, taste buds are
  mostly found in the inner wall of the trench. Foliate papillae lie laterally while
  circumvallate papillae are organized in a central V-shaped formation. Rodents possess
  only a single circumvallate papilla. (B) Taste buds are made of 50–100 cells that
  are continually replaced throughout life. Progenitor cells (dark blue) reside along
  the basement membrane outside taste buds and actively divide to self-renew and produce
  taste cells and non-taste keratinocytes (light gray) that surround taste buds. Following
  mitosis, taste-fated lingual progenitors enter taste buds and specify into post-mitotic
  SHH+ taste precursor cells (magenta). Precursor cells then differentiate into most
  prevalent Type I glial-like cells (tangerine), Type II sweet/bitter/umami receptor
  cells (green), and least common Type III sour receptor cells (yellow). (C) Fate
  decision is regulated by the Wnt pathway, Hedgehog, and Notch signaling. The Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway controls all steps of taste and non-taste cell renewal, while SHH instructs
  progenitors to differentiate into taste cells. Notch signaling represses Type II
  cell fate via HES1 and transcriptionally represses ASCL1 to control Type III taste
  cell differentiation. Illustrations are modified from Servier Medical Art licensed
