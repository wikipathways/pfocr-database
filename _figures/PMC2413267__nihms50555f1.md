caption: (a) In the absence of Wnt signal, β-catenin forms a complex with Axin and
  APC. Axin acts as a scaffold for the protein kinases GSK3 and CK1α. After phosphorylation
  by GSK3 and CK1α, β-catenin is degraded by ubiquitination involving interactions
  with β-TrCP. In the absence of β-catenin, TCF acts as a repressor of Wnt target
  genes by forming a complex with Groucho, which interacts with histone deacetylases
  that are thought to make DNA refractive to transcriptional activation.(b) When Wnt
  ligand binds to its receptors Frizzled and LDL receptor related protein 5 or 6,
  the Frizzled and Lrp receptors recruit Dishevelled (Dsh) and Axin to the membrane,
  and the destruction complex is disassembled. As a result, the degradation of β-catenin
  is inhibited and β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Accumulated
  β-catenin interferes with the interaction between TCF and Groucho and coverts TCF
  from transcription repressor to activator.
