caption: IRF-3- and Bax-mediated apoptosis acts as a host antiviral response. Infection
  of cells by DNA or RNA viruses triggers the cellular apoptotic pathway by RIG-I
  signaling-mediated activation of IRF-3 and Bax to cause their translocation to mitochondria,
  which in turn activates the apoptotic pathway. Cytosolic DNA, generated upon infection
  by DNA viruses or other microbes, activates RIG-I signaling via an intermediate
  dsRNA generated by RNA polymerase III. The IRF-3-mediated apoptotic pathway, in
  addition to the gene induction pathway, significantly contributes to the host antiviral
  response.
