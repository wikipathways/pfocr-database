caption: Pathway-pathway network. Using the drug targets of the candidate repurposed
  drugs we detected the pathways that these genes are associated with and created
  a pathway-pathway network. The 135 pathways that are targeted by our elite candidate
  repurposed drugs share 95 common pathways with the ones from DisGeNET, which give
  a total of 159. Common pathways are shown in square nodes, whereas unique to drug
  targets are shown in circles. Different colors show pathways targeted from candidate
  repurposed drugs from Braak stage I-II, III-IV and V-VI. Pink colored nodes show
  pathways targeted by drugs from stage I-II, light blue pathways targeted by drugs
  from stage III-IV and purple pathways targeted by drugs from stage V-VI. The size
  of nodes corresponds to the number of drugs targeting each pathway. The width of
  edges corresponds to the number of shared genes between pathways.
