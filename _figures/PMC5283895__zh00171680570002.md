caption: 'Potential mechanisms of impairment of vascular NO and H2S signaling processes
  during oxidative stress: a working hypothesis. Vascular oxidative stress increases
  the consumption of NO and converts it into more deleterious species (e.g., peroxynitrite).
  Oxidative stress also consumes various eNOS cofactors (e.g., tetrahydrobiopterin,
  NADPH), which impairs eNOS activity and leads to further oxidant generation from
  NOS. Vascular oxidant generation may also oxidize sGC, increasing the pool of sGC
  that is no longer activatable by NO. These processes may form self-amplifying cycles
  of injury, leading to more oxidant generation from various sources including mitochondrial
  electron transport chain. The vascular oxidative stress response diminishes cellular
  H2S levels, either by directly interacting with H2S, or by inactivating its enzymatic
  sources (e.g., 3-MST). When ambient H2S levels are diminished, vascular oxidative
  stress is exacerbated and the stimulatory/balancing roles of H2S on the vascular
  eNOS/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway are reduced, which, in turn, further impairs eNOS-mediated
  vascular responses.'
