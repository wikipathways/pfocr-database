caption: (a) In the classical apoptotic pathway of mammalian cells, Fas-ligand binding
  to its receptor results in the activation of low levels of caspase 8. Caspase 8
  then results in a series of events leading to MOMP and the release of proapoptotic
  factors. These factors form the apoptosome with caspase 9 and elicit a strong caspase
  3 response, ultimately inducing DNA fragmentation. (b) In 3D7 P. falciparum parasites
  treated with chloroquine (CQ), similar cell death features are observed. Inhibition
  studies with zVAD.fmk (zVAD) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) suggest that CQ treatment
  results in the activation of low levels of cysteine proteases, which triggers mitochondria
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). In turn, this results in an increase in
  the amount of cysteine activity, which causes DNA degradation. This ordered sequence
  of events is characteristic of a programmed cell death pathway. This pathway is
  also likely to exist in CQ-resistant 7G8 parasites. Although showing similar proportions
  of cells with MOMP as 3D7, 7G8 parasites have a lesser degree of DNA degradation,
  suggesting that there are differences in the later-stage events of the pathway.
  In CQ-resistant K1 parasites, differences in both the degree of MOMP and DNA degradation
  suggest that the earlier stages of the pathway may differ from 3D7. The effectiveness
  of verapamil in reducing these differences shows the importance of CQ localization
  to the digestive vacuole (DV) in this pathway. Taken together with the results of
  other studies, a more detailed model of PCD in P. falciparum is proposed. (c) Only
  at high doses of CQ does the drug accumulate in the DV to an extent that causes
  the DV to swell and become partially permeabilized. Clan CA proteases that are abundant
  in the DV leak into the cytoplasm of the parasite, resulting in the dysregulation
  of the mitochondrion. This places further stress on the DV leading to its rupture
  and a release of its contents (more clan CA proteases and other hydrolytic enzymes),
  which degrades the DNA and eventually the parasite

  has general features of mammalian apoptosis but is mediated by clan CA cysteine
  proteases.
