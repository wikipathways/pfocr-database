caption: (A) Known IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) DNA repair network of gene/protein
  (nodes) interactions (edges). Nodes are colored shades red or green to reflect fold
  changes (increased and decreased, respectively) in p53 occupancy upon UV treatment.
  Relative change in Pol II occupancy in the gene body is marked by yellow/cyan-shaded
  (up/down) halos encompassing the nodes. Gray indicates that a p53/RE was not assigned
  to these genes.(B) Browser shot of the POLH gene, displaying UV-induced p53 binding
  at an RE that contains a SNP as a common variant. The lower panel displays a blow-up
  of the bound p53 RE, identifying the location of the rs9333500 SNP at 7th G position.
