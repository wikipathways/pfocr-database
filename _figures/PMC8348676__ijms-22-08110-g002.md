caption: A complex regulatory network of initiation of silica-induced apoptosis or
  pyroptosis. Normally, when silica invades the alveoli, mtROS is produced and augments
  the formation of the cas-9-Apaf-1 complex. Furthermore, cas-3 is activated to crack
  PARP, leading to cell apoptosis finally. In such a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic
  pathway, the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 aggravates the cas-3 activation. Moreover,
  the Fas/FasL signaling pathway, induced by upstream factor Annexin A5, also mediates
  silica-induced apoptosis. p53 induces apoptosis, not via the inhibition of uPA and
  induction of PAI-1, but via p53 trans-activation. Another member of the p53 family,
  PPP1R13B, promotes over-activation of ER stress via the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP signaling
  pathway, further initiating silica-induced apoptosis. Similarly, it also can be
  activated by ER stress-related protein cas-12. Silica-induced apoptosis is still
  induced by the IL-1β-iNOS-NO cascade reaction. Notably, TNF-α activation aggravates
  cell apoptosis. However, TNF-α also stimulates the NF-κB signaling pathway to alleviate
  cell apoptosis against silica invasion. The bidirectional role of TNF-α deserves
  further discussion. It is worth noting that NAC and DHA have potential anti-apoptotic
  effects activated by silica. In addition to apoptosis, silica can stimulate the
  interaction of NALP3 and ASC, and subsequent NALP3-ASC complex activates cas-1.
  The cas-1 activation leads to the transformation from pro-IL-1β to IL-1β, further
  executing cell pyroptosis. BMSCs might mitigate cell pyroptosis via inhibition of
  NALP3.
