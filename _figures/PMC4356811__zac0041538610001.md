caption: Cytoplasmic steps of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway. Amino acids
  are sequentially added to UDP-N-acetyl muramic acid (UDP-Mur) using MurC to MurF
  to form the UDP-MurNac-pentapeptide, the final cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursor
  (). MurI provides d-glutamate. The inhibition of MurI results in the inhibition
  of peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the d-glutamate addition stage (MurD). As a result,
  the inhibition of MurI will result in the depletion of MurD, MurE, and MurF products
  and the accumulation of UDP-N-acetyl muramic acid-alanine (MurD substrate). Ala,
  alanine; Glu, glutamate, Dap, diaminopimelic acid.
