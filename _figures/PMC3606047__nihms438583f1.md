caption: Cellular injury associated with hypoxia and inflammation promote the release
  of ATP that is subsequently dephosphorylated by membrane bound CD39 and CD73. Extracellular
  adenosine then stimulates cell surface adenosine receptors (ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B,
  ADORA3) to influence tissue responses to injury. In acute disease states, adenosine
  largely contributes to anti-inflammatory and tissue protective responses such as
  the promotion of vascular barrier function. This signaling pathway also promotes
  wound healing. These adenosine responses are largely regulated by ADORA2A and ADORA2B
  signaling pathways. In chronic disease states, adenosine signaling can promote cellular
  processes such as fibrosis that contribute to disease progression. Depicted is fibrosis
  in the liver, lung and heart; however, findings suggest excessive adenosine signaling
  also contributes to fibrosis in the skin, kidney and penis. These responses are
  regulated by ADORA2A and ADORA2B signaling pathways. In addition, ADORA2B signaling
  promotes sickling of erythrocytes that can contribute to the progression of tissue
  injury, and promotes insulin resistance that can impact the development of diabetes.
