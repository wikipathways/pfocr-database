caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of ABA after zeaxanthin, with positions of
  steps blocked in some ABA biosynthetic mutants indicated. Also shown are the major
  inactivation products of ABA (phaseic acid, dihydrophaseic acid, and the glucose
  ester of ABA) and the minor metabolites (ABA-diols, 7′-hydroxy-ABA, ABA-1′-glucoside,
  and glucose esters and glucosides of PA and DPA).
