caption: Regulation of autophagy. Autophagy is regulated though a complex system of
  stimulatory and inhibitory inputs. Initiation of autophagy is dependent on class
  III PI 3‐kinase (PI3KC3) activation through its accessory subunits UVRAG, Beclin
  1 and Bif‐1. This is negatively regulated through Beclin 1 interaction with Bcl‐2,
  and through JNK. Activated JNK leads to Bcl‐2 phosphorylation and Beclin 1 release
  and thereby promotes autophagy (Wei et al., 2008). Additional positive/negative
  regulation of the class III PI 3‐kinase complex is achieved by Atg14L and Rubicon
  binding, respectively. An important regulatory input is mediated through activated
  growth factor receptors, which inhibit autophagy by activating the TORC1 complex
  via TSC2 inhibition. Similarly, the activated RAS‐RAF pathway exerts negative control
  onto TSC2 via ERK. In contrast, at high AMP/ATP ratios resulting from energy depletion,
  the AMP‐activated kinase (AMPK) is phosphorylated by LKB1, leading to inactivation
  of TORC1 via TSC2 phosphorylation and activation. AMPK can also be triggered by
  p53, either in a positive fashion from nuclear p53, or negatively from cytosolic
  p53.
