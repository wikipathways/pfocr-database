caption: A network model for AP2/ERF genes response to phytohormones and regulating
  downstream effectors in angiosperm. Ethylene biosynthesis pathway, ethylene signaling
  pathway, and ripening regulators are indicated by yellow, green, and gray colors,
  respectively. AP2/ERF family members is boxed and filled with red color. In ethylene
  biosynthesis pathway, S-adenosine methionine (SAM) is converted to ethylene (ET)
  via an intermediate metabolites 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxyla (ACC), underlying
  the catalysis of the two enzymes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxyla synthase (ACS)
  and oxidase (ACO). In ethylene signaling pathway, ET is firstly combined with ethylene
  receptor (ETR) to activate constitutive triple response (CTR), leading to expression
  of ethylene insensitive (EIN) and EIN-induced ethylene insensitive-like (EIL). EIL
  promote expression of ethylene response factor (ERF), including activator and repressor.
  The ERF activities are induced by auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CTK), abscisic acid (ABA),
  and jasmonate (JA), as well as ripening-related genes, such as RIPENING INHIBITOR
  (RIN), NON-RIPENING (NOR), COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (CNR), and Homeodomain-leucine
  zipper HOMEOBOX (HB-1). Meanwhile, ERF can reduce CTK and gibberellin (GA) levels
  but increase ABA biosynthesis. In ethylene responses, ERF also regulate ethylene
  level by enhancing and decreasing ACS/ACO activity mediated by the activators and
  repressors, respectively. As for effectors of plant growth, defense responses and
  fruit ripening, ERF can directly medium the expression by binding to GCC-box/DREB
  element in the promoter, and have the ability to indirectly regulate it, due to
  few ERFs inhibit expression of RIN, NOR, CNR, and HB-1 that can directly bind to
  the promoter of effectors
