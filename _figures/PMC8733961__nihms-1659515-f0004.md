caption: 'Model of NSD role in mTOR pathway signaling. Overexpression of NSD results
  in increased TSC levels that can be ameliorated by IR overexpression, and changes
  in mTOR signaling (b). mTOR activity is rescued through addition of exogenous leucine
  (c). Representation of expression: larger, green circles and thick lines, increased;
  smaller, red circles and thin lines, decreased'
