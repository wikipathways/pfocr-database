caption: pDC have been demonstrated to respond to viral RNA and DNA through a unique
  molecular complex known as the “cytoplasmic transductional-transcriptional processor”
  (CTTP) (86). Virus enters the cell either by endocytosis or, potentially, direct
  fusion with the cell membrane. It is uncoated in the acidic endosome and the viral
  DNA or RNA interacts with TLR9 or TLR7, respectively. Intracellular signaling occurs
  through the CTTP, which can contain either IRF-5 or IRF-7. IRAK4 phosphorylates
  IRAK-1, which in turn is responsible for IRF-7 phosphorylation. IRF-7 is required
  for the transcription of IFNA genes, while IRF-5 is involved in transcription of
  inflammatory cytokines. Recent evidence, however, suggests that IRF-5 is also required
  for IFN-α production. IRF-8 is also expressed in pDC, but its function in IFN induction
  is not known. Viruses that enter the cytoplasm and replicate may induce IFN-α through
  TLR7/9-independent pathways (shown with question marks); alternatively, viral RNA
  or DNA may enter the endosome through autophagy (not shown in figure), thus entering
  the TLR7/9 pathway.
