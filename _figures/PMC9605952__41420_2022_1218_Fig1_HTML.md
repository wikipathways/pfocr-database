caption: TFR1 triggers iron uptake, which is regulated by MYCN and YAP pathways. Accumulation
  of iron facilitates lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In contrast, SLC7A11/GPX4
  axis prevents ferroptosis by antioxidant role. SLC7A11 or GPX4 expressions are regulated
  by multiple regulators including NRF2, SOX2, TAZ, EST1, and SREBP-1a etc. Moreover,
  SLC7A11 mediates cystine uptake, subsequently, activates Rag-mTORC1-4EBP pathway-induced
  GPX4 protein synthesis. Ferroptosis resistance is blocked by some mediators such
  as p53, KLF2 etc. In addition to GPX4, FSP1 is a ferroptosis inhibitor by inhibiting
  lipid ROS accumulation, which is reversed by KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway.
