caption: A proposed working model for PCAF-mediated ubiquitination of AE1 that connects
  to the PCAF-p16-CDK4 pathway in GC cells. In the presence of lower pH or IFN-γ stimuli,
  PCAF expression in GC cells is upregulated. This elevation in PCAF levels promotes
  an AE1-PCAF interaction and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AE1. Meanwhile, PCAF
  could also interact with p16 to upregulate its expression, and promote p16 nuclear
  translocation. Once in the nucleus, p16 can compete with Cyclin D1 for binding to
  CDK4, which leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of GC proliferation.
