caption: Expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Calvin–Benson
  cycle (CBC). The line and symbol chart next to each enzyme represents the expression
  profiles of DEGs shown in . The lines with different colors represent the assembled
  transcripts for an enzyme in the CBC. According to the gene expression levels under
  CK conditions, these transcripts were listed next to each chart in descending order.
  The grazing gradient is shown on the x-axis, and the gene expression level (the
  mean FPKM value of three biological replicates) is shown on the y-axis. The carboxylation
  reaction catalyzed by Rubisco fixes CO2 into the acceptor molecule RuBP, forming
  3-PGA. The reductive phase of the cycle follows with two reactions catalyzed by
  PGKase and GAPDHase, producing GAP. The GAP enters the regenerative phase catalyzed
  by ALDase and either FBPase or SBPase, producing F6P (fructose-6-phosphate) and
  S7P (sedoheptulose-7-phosphate). The F6P and S7P are then used in reactions catalyzed
  by TKase, RPIase, and RPEase, producing Ru5P (ribulose 5-phosphate). The final step,
  which is catalyzed by PRKase, converts Ru5P to RuBP. Rubisco is the initiating enzyme
  for the Calvin–Benson cycle and the photorespiratory cycle, fixing O2 into the acceptor
  molecule RuBP to form 2-PG, which is then metabolized via the photorespiratory pathway.
