caption: The tumor immune microenvironment of colorectal cancer. DC activates T cells
  through the combination of the MHC and T cell receptors. Tregs inhibit the immune
  effects of T cells via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Both NK cells and T cells can kill tumor
  cells through the Fas/FasL pathway, the perforin-granzyme pathway, and by releasing
  TNF and IFN-γ. MDSCs can mediate the development of M2 macrophages and Tregs, which
  depends on IL-10, and produce TGF-β to induct Tregs. M0 macrophages polarize into
  M1 macrophages under the effect of LPS, IFN-γ, and TNF, while polarizing into M2
  macrophages following induction by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. M1 macrophages also induce
  tumor cell apoptosis through phagocytosis, ADCC, and the release of TNF and NO.
  M2 secretes TGF-β and contributes to angiogenesis, promotes tumor cell EMT, and
  induces immunosuppressive microenvironment.
