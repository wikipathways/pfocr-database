caption: 'Uptake and intracellular trafficking of rNleC. (A) rNleC enters eukaryotic
  cells via lipid rafts and follows the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Upon acidification
  of endosomes, rNleC performs a change in its three-dimensional structure and escapes
  from endosomal compartments into the cytosol. (EE: early endosomes, LE: late endosomes,
  LY: lysosomes). Protein that does not escape from endosomes is degraded. (B) Cytosolic
  rNleC only cleaves NF-κB p65 when the NF-κB signaling pathway is activated (for
  example by IL1β). Cleavage of p65 results in a C-terminal p65 fragment bound to
  p50, which translocates into the nucleus and an N-terminal fragment bound to RPS3,
  which remains in the cytosol. Without the specifier RPS3, RPS3-depent NF-κB genes
  such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL8, or TNFα are not transcribed and
  innate immune responses are dampened.'
