caption: Effects of the HIF-1 activation on the tricarboxylic acid cycle and associated
  pathways, including glutamine and citrate metabolism, in hypoxia. The mechanisms
  are highlighted in red, and the red arrows indicate the direction of flux via the
  metabolic pathways under the prevailing oxygen tension. (A) In normoxia, pyruvate
  produced via glycolysis enters the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA
  and enters the tri-carboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Citrate from the TCA can be exported
  from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA for
  fatty acid synthesis. Cytosolic glutamine is converted to α-ketoglutarate and transported
  into the mitochondria where it enters the TCA. A key regulator of autophagy, Beclin
  1 is inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, thereby decreasing autophagy. (B) In hypoxia,
  HIF-1 activation results in increased flux through the glycolytic pathway, as well
  as accumulation of pyruvate and conversion into lactate. BNIP3 and BNIP3L (not shown
  in this figure) are expressed under the control of HIF-1, which then interact with
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to liberate Beclin 1. Beclin 1 induces mitochondrial autophagy,
  reducing the formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species under hypoxia. Fatty
  acid synthesis is maintained by reductive carboxylation of glutamine, formation
  of citrate, and conversion of citrate into acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm.
