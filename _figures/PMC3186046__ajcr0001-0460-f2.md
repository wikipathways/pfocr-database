caption: Sphingolipid metabolism in various subcellular compartments. Ceramide (Cer)
  is produced either by de novo synthesis from palmitoyl CoA (palmCoA) and L-serine
  with sequential enzymatic reactions in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or through degradation
  of sphingomyelin (SM) by the action of sphingomyelinases in the plasma membrane
  and intracellular membranes including lysosomes. Cer is deacylated by ceramidase
  to yield sphingosine (Sph), which is then phosphorylated by SphK1/2 to generate
  S1P. S1P is exported through a plasma membrane S1P transporter, leading to activation
  of the G protein-coupled S1P receptor subtypes (S1PR1∼S1PR5). S1P could be either
  dephos-phorylated by S1P phosphatase1/2 (SPP) back to Sph or degraded to ethanolamine-phosphate
  (Eth-P) and hexadece-nal (hxdcnl) by S1P lyase (SPL) to leave sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway. SphK1 is present in both cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions, both being
  enzymatically active. SPPs and SPL are located in ER. Intracellular transfer of
  Cer from ER to Golgi is facilitated by transfer proteins such as CERT, and both
  Cer and SM traffic between membrane compartments via vesicular transport [, ]. PE,
  phosphatidylethanolamine.
