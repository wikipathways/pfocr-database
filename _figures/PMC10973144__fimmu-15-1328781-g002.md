caption: 'Protein glycosylation is closely interconnected with glycolysis and other
  metabolic pathways. Glucose is transported into the cell via the GLUT transporter,
  here GLUT1, which is known to be active in its glycosylated form (here with polyLacNAc
  glycans). The initial steps in converting glucose are shared between glycolysis
  and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Here, glucose undergoes a two-step
  conversion: first, it is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to form glucose-6-phosphate,
  and then, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) transforms it into fructose-6-phosphate.
  The next critical step is catalyzed by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase
  1 (GFAT1), which converts fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate
  and glutamate. This conversion is a rate-limiting step in the HBP. Following this,
  glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) converts glucosamine-6-phosphate
  into N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate, using acetylated-coenzyme-A from fatty acid
  oxidation (FAO). Phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) then isomerizes this compound into
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate. Finally, UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase
  (UAP) synthesizes UDP-GlcNAc and diphosphate from N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  and uridine triphosphate (UTP). UDP-GlcNAc, along with other activated monosaccharides
  derived from UDP-GlcNAc, fructose-6-phosphate, or glucose, is utilized for protein
  glycosylation in the ER and Golgi by various glycosyltransferases (here ALGs, OST,
  MGATs, FUTs, STs, GALTs) and glycosidases (α-mannosidases). It is also involved
  in O-GlcNAcylation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT).
  O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc, adding back GlcNAc to the HBP
  pool for recycling through the salvage pathway. Besides OGA, some glycosidases located
  in the extracellular matrix contribute to remodeling glycosylated receptors or ECM
  proteins. Lysosomal glycosidases play an essential role in glycan turnover, as they
  hydrolyze existing glycans into monosaccharides that can be recycled for glycosylation.

  (ALG13); MGATs, N-acetyglucosaminyltransferases; FUTs, fucosyltransferases; STs-
