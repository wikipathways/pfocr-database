caption: 'The 29 pathway structures that possess positive feedback by ERK to Raf isoforms
  can be classified into three types of regulation depending on which isoform is positively
  regulated: B-Raf (nos. 1–10), Raf-1 (nos. 11–20), or both B-Raf and Raf-1 (nos.
  21–29). The symbol for MEK is omitted here for clarity.'
