caption: Signaling pathway involved in the osteogenesis process due to Mg effect.
  Regarding the osteogenic-related cells (right part), the Mg2+ ions upregulate the
  integrin expression and activate the FAK-signaling pathway. The downstream-signaling
  pathways, including MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and P13K/AKT, are activated. Through P13/AKT,
  the level of GSK3-β phosphorylation is increased, and the Wnt pathway is activated.
  Mg ions are transported via MagT1, and they promote the ERK1/2-signaling pathway
  activation and act on TRPM7 with P13/AKT-signaling pathway kinase activity. Intracellular
  Mg2+ promotes osteogenesis through the CaM/CaMKIV/CREB1-signaling pathway. In the
  left part of the figure is evidenced the molecular mechanism of Mg, which inhibits
  the function and differentiation of the osteoclasts. Cytokines such as RANKL and
  M-CSF promote the main functions of the osteoclasts. Magnesium inhibits the NF-kB-signaling
  pathway, blocks Ca2+, and suppresses NFATc1 expression. As a final result, inhibiting
  the osteoclast marker gene expression due to Mg2+ action leads to inhibition of
  the osteoclastogenesis process. The figure was generated using images assembled
