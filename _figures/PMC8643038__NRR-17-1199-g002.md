caption: 'Core components of the Notch signaling pathway.Schematic of the Notch signaling
  pathway highlighting points of possible regulation during retinal regeneration.
  1: Notch receptors are post-translationally modified by glycosylation and Furin-dependent
  S1 cleavage. 2: Notch receptors on the signal-receiving cell bind ligands on the
  signalsending cell. 3: Transendocytosis pulls the ligand-NECD complex into the signal-sending
  cell. 4: S2 site is available for metalloprotease-dependent cleavage. 5: γ-Secretase-dependent
  S3 cleavage releases NICD from the membrane. 6: NICD translocates into the nucleus
  of the signal-receiving cell and forms a complex with CSL transcription factor RBP-Jκ,
  MAML, and co-activators. 7: Notch binding of the chromatin ultimately induces expression
  changes of NICD target genes. Co-A: Co-activator protein; Co-R: co-repressor protein;
  CSL: (CBF1/RBP-Jκ, Su(H), LAG-1); MAML: Mastermind-like; NECD: Notch extracellular
  domain; NICD: Notch intracellular domain; S1: cleavage site 1; S2: cleavage site
  2; S3: cleavage site 3.'
