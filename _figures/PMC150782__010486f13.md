caption: 'Model of Phytic Acid Synthesis and Its Translocation to Mineral-Storing
  Sites in Developing Arabidopsis Seeds.(A-1) Phytic acid (InsP6) is synthesized by
  enzymes associated with the ER and is deposited immediately into the ER lumen. Sequestration
  of the phytic acid in the ER lumen prevents it from complexing with cytosolic cations
  and thereby perturbing the ion balance of the cells. In the chalazal endosperm,
  phytic acid forms crystals in two locations: Mn-rich crystals in the ER and Zn-rich
  crystals in the vacuoles.(A-2) Phytic acid for the vacuoles diffuses into the ER
  tubules that form the core elements of the membrane networks. There, transporters
  transfer the phytic acid first across the ER and then across the tonoplast membrane
  into the vacuole, where it interacts with the cations that are to be stored. The
  geometry of the networks reduces the potential of phytic acid cation crystals from
  forming in the cytosol.(B) In the embryo, the transport of phytic acid from the
  ER to the PSV follows the secretory pathway, as suggested by others. Yet to be determined
  is whether Golgi-to-PSV transport of phytic acid occurs via multivesicular bodies
  or by a more direct route.'
