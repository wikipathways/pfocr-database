caption: The five pools from  are coupled into a gearwheel-like mechanism. An increase
  in the NAD/NADH concentration ratio would affect driving forces in the direction
  shown. (a) Any reactions that interconvert NAD and NADH would be driven in the direction
  of increased NAD consumption. These include reactions of glycolysis and the TCA
  cycle, reactions converting malate and lactate to pyruvate, and reactions converting
  pyruvate, ethanol, and acetaldehyde to acetyl CoA. In short, NAD/NADH coupled reactions
  would be driven in the direction of increased acetyl CoA production from available
  carbon sources. (b) The increased NAD/NADH concentration ratio would also affect
  driving forces through reactions that couple the NAD pool to other cofactor pools.
  Altered flux through these reactions would in turn affect concentration ratios within
  those pools which are coupled to their own sets of reactions. (c) An increased NADP/NADPH
  ratio would drive flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and conversion of glutamate
  to alpha-ketoglutarate. An increased Q8/Q8H2 ratio would inhibit flux through the
  electron transport chain. Increased acetyl-CoA/CoA and succinyl-CoA/CoA ratios would
  drive acetate production and TCA cycle reactions, respectively, which are coupled
  to ATP production from ADP. (d) An increase in the ATP/ADP ratio resulting from
  increased flux through these reactions would drive ATP consuming reactions. In iCore,
  ATP consuming reactions are mainly found in gluconeogenesis so the increased ATP/ADP
  ratio would counteract the effects of an increased NAD/NADH ratio to some extent.
