caption: Schematic illustration of the Wnt pathway and low temperature regulated formation
  of wound epithelium and blastema. In response to tail shedding in the geckos, Wnt
  pathway is activated and then enhances the activity of Akt/mTOR. In condition of
  low temperature, the metabolic level of gecko decreases thus activates the AMPK
  activity, which in turn restrains the activity of mTOR. The increased Akt/mTOR activity
  is necessary for the proliferation of wound epithelium and formation of blastema.

  epithelium growth in Gekko Japonicus.
