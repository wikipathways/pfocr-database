caption: The upper panel shows interactions in the intestine. Glucose is used as a
  metabolic substrate by all neurons and immune cells Th2 cells, Th17 cells, B cells
  and ILC3. The M2 macrophages, ILC2, naïve T cells and also B cells utilize fatty
  oxidation pathway to derive energy. The naïve T cells derive energy from amino acid
  metabolism as well. The immune cells secrete factors, which affect the enteric neuronal
  functions. For e.g., IL-10 and IL-4 bind to their cognate receptors on neurons to
  prevent inflammatory signaling. Neuronal function is also affected availability
  of metabolic substrates. They in turn regulate the glycolysis via the neuropeptides
  POMC, GLP-1 and Gal, whereas norepinephrine is required for efficient lipolysis
  via fatty acid oxidation. Together these interactions are required for physiological
  functions in the gut namely gut motility, mucosal barrier integrity and nutrient
  absorption. The lower panel depicts interactions occurring in the extremities. The
  legs, for e.g., are innervated by the sensory neurons broadly classified as CGRP+,
  NF200+ or IB4 binding. A sensory stimulus triggers cellular interactions aimed to
  restore homeostasis. The neurons release the neuropeptides CGRP and SP, which recruit
  macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils and DCs. The inflammatory factors such as TNF-α,
  histamines may cause proinflammatory signaling and hyperexcitability of neurons.
  However, antiinflammatory cytokines released by the immune cells (IL-10) and inhibitory
  neuropeptides released by the neurons (POMC and GABA) deactivate the immune cells
  and also prevent neuronal hyperexcitability and ensuing pain. The immune cells and
  neurons utilize glycolysis to perform these functions.
