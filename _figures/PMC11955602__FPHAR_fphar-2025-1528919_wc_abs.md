caption: The diagram illustrates how herbal formulations and extracts derived from
  TCM exert potential effects on AD through modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  Various bioactive compounds present in these formulations and extracts have been
  reported to influence multiple pathological mechanisms associated with AD, including
  cell apoptosis, Tau protein phosphorylation, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses,
  and Aβ deposition.While these findings suggest a mechanistic basis for the potential
  effects of TCM-derived formulations and extracts in AD, further well-designed pharmacological
  and clinical studies are required to confirm their efficacy and elucidate their
  precise molecular targets
