caption: Proposed cell signaling network during high cholesterol-induced neural lesion.
  Cholesterol-induced oxidation initiates global DNA repair responses for repairing
  the DNA damage, which may influence the cytokines used to control inflammation.
  Some interactions, such as the one between OGG1 and XPB, may be specifically required
  for containing the stressful condition, particularly by regulating IL-6.
papertitle: Broad DNA repair responses in neural injury are associated with activation
  of the IL-6 pathway in cholesterol-fed rabbits.
