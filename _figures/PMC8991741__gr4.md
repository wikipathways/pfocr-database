caption: 'Phenylpropanoid-flavonoid pathway in the three cassavas with different flesh
  colors. PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; TAL: tyrosine ammonia-lyase; 4CL: 4-coumarate
  CoA ligase; CHS: chalcone synthase; PGT: UDP-glucosyl transferase; HCDBR: NADP-dependent
  alkenal double bond reductase; CHI: chalcone isomerase; F3H: flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H: flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; F6H: feruloyl-CoA 6-hydroxylase; FLS: flavonol
  synthase; DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; FR: flavanone 4-reductase; ANS: anthocyanidin
  synthase; LAR: leucocyanidin reductase; ANR: anthocyanin reductase; TOGT1: scopoletin
  glucosyltransferase. The differentially expressed transcripts are shown in red.
  Non-significant DEGs are shown in black. The solid line indicates the metabolic
  reactions in only one step. The dotted line presents more than one step of the metabolic
  reaction. The rectangle with black and white near the DEGs ID represents the up-regulated
  or down-regulated in Y or F compared with the W, respectively. The rectangle with
  black indicates relatively high FPKM values compared to rectangle with white. The
  left rectangle presents W, which is represented as control. The right rectangle
  presents Y or F. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
