caption: 'SETD7 mediates redox signal through both transcriptional regulation and
  post-translational modification: 1) SETD7 modulates mitochondria functions through
  negative regulation of PPARGC1A activity; 2) SETD7 inhibits the expression of NFE2L2
  and its downstream antioxidant genes (HOMX1, TXN). This may be due to the interaction
  between NFE2L2 and SETD7 that leads to methylation and inhibition of NFE2L2 stability.
  3) Through histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), SETD7 stimulates the transcription
  activity of NF-ĸB and its downstream cytokine IL-6 and IL-8 production in response
  to ROS stimulation.'
