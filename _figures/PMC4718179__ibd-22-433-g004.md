caption: 'Working model of activation of EGC and induction of a “reactive EGC phenotype,”
  in ENS: a variety of neurotransmitters and potential gliotransmitters can activate
  EGC including 5-HT, ACh, GABA, glutamate, lipids, ATP, uridine triphosphate, ADP,
  and adenosine. Intestinal infection with bacteria or viruses, inflammatory mediators,
  IBD, or POI can induce a reactive glial cell phenotype. HIV virus or JC virus can
  infect hEGC and cause phenotypic changes, associated with changes in neural behavior.
  Bacterial infection with AIEC or Shigella flexneri can activate EGC, but they can
  discriminate between these pathogenic bacteria and probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus
  paracasei). Inflammatory mediators released in the gut in response to infection,
  IBD, or POI can activate EGC. The “reactive glial phenotype” can release protective
  factors (neurotrophin-3, GDNF, GNSO, and PEA/PPAR-α) or destructive factors (proinflammatory
  mediators such as IL1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, MCP-1, activation of the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase/NF-κB proinflammatory transcription pathway, upregulation
  of MHC class II molecules, and activation of TLRs). Such insults in various pathologic
  situations can alter EGC mechanosensitivity, Ca2+signaling, and purinergic signaling.
  Abnormal glial function is expected to alter neuron-to-glial communication, neural
  circuit behavior in the ENS, neuromuscular transmission, and GI motility. Mø, macrophage;
  EEC, enteroendocrine cells; SMC, smooth muscle cells; TLR, Toll-like receptors.'
