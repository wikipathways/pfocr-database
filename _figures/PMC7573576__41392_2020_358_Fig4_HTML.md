caption: 'Synthetic lethal pathway: multiple pathways. a Concept of connected multiple
  pathways. Some pathways form a network and perform their functions to maintain cell
  survival. Whereas the presence of abnormal (mutation, overexpression, or inhibited)
  genes in every pathway leads to cell death. However, cells could still survive with
  abnormal genes in several but not all pathways. b Example: Survival of KRAS oncogene-driven
  NSCLC depends on the GATA2 transcriptional network. In KRAS-mutated NSCLC, three
  GATA2 downstream pathways (proteasome pathway, Rho-signaling cascade, and NF-κB
  signaling pathway) and related cross-talk are essential for the viability of tumors.
  Combined utilization of Bortezomib (inhibit proteasome and NF-κB) and Fasudil (inhibit
  Rho-signaling cascade) leads the tumors to death, whereas a single drug could not
  kill the tumors. Star shape of genes represents a mutation; syringe represents inhibitors;
  solid black arrows indicate directions of regulation; and dashed lines indicate
  cross-talk among pathways'
