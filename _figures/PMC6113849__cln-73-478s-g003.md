caption: Cisplatin-induced DNA lesions and repair mechanisms. A) The nucleotide excision
  repair (NER) pathway is responsible for removing cisplatin-induced DNA adducts (such
  as 1,2 and 1,3 intrastrand adducts), while the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway can
  recognize but not repair these adducts. B) Double-strand breaks are repaired by
  homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). The NER, HR,
  translesion synthesis (TLS) and Fanconi anemia (FA) pathways are involved in ICL
  repair. C) Schematic representation of lesion bypass of cisplatin-induced intrastrand
  crosslinks via the TLS pathway.
