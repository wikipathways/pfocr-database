caption: Activation of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE/pathway by the SOs is cytoprotective. Nrf2
  has been described previously () as a “multiorgan protector,” because this system
  can protect against diseases in a number of organs, including the brain, lungs,
  kidney, heart, liver, and eye. The SOs are among the most potent known inducers
  of the Nrf2 pathway, and these drugs not only activate Nrf2 in all of these organs
  but also protect the organs against a variety of diseases driven by inflammatory
  or oxidative stress. SOs that cross the blood-brain barrier are beneficial in experimental
  models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's
  disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and ALS. These drugs also reduce damage
  to the eye from light, uveitis, or ischemia reperfusion and reduce cardiomyopathy
  induced by smoking and reduce the disease process in the lung in animal models of
  COPD, emphysema, asthma, and ALI/ARDS. In the liver and kidney, the SOs protect
  against toxicity from insults such as aflatoxin, ConA, acetaminophen, or cisplatin
  and against injury from ischemia reperfusion.
