caption: Effects of nicotine acting on α9-containing receptors expressed in different
  types of cancer cells. (A) Nicotine (in lung adenocarcinoma and glioma cells) and
  choline (only in glioma cells) mediate proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects
  through the ERK and Akt signaling pathways. These effects are blocked by the α9-selective
  antagonist RgIA4 and α9 siRNA. (B) In breast cancer cells, nicotine acting on α9
  nAChRs activates the PI3K/Akt pathway that phosphorylates intra-cellular estrogen
  receptors (ERs) which, in their turn, bind transcription factor AP1 and the CHRNA9
  gene promoter region. It also increases the levels of pro-proliferative cyclin D3,
  the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP, and the PPM1F protein phosphatase that reduces
  phosphorylated p53 and BAX, thus protecting the cells from apoptosis. Finally, it
  promotes the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its nuclear translocation, thus increasing
  the transcription of the gene encoding the anti-apoptotic lectin Gal-3. All of these
  effects are blocked by α9 siRNA. (C) In melanoma cells, nicotine increases the number
  of α9 nAChRs and phosphorylates STAT3, which binds the PD-L1 promoter in the nucleus
  and leads to the higher surface expression of PD-L1, thus promoting the immune escape
  of cancer cells. The increased expression of PD-L1 protein is down-regulated by
  α9 siRNA.
