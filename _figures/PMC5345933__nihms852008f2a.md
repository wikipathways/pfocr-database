caption: 'a: Entry into the cell cycle is typically induced in response to mitogenic
  signals that activate signalling pathways such as the RAS pathway. These pathways
  eventually impinge on transcriptions factors such as MYC, AP-1 or β-catenin and
  lead to induction of a number of cell cycle proteins including D-type cyclins. Formation
  of active complexes of D-type cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and
  6 drives phosphorylation of the RB (retinoblastoma) protein and is antagonized by
  the INK4 family (p16INK4A and p15INK4B) in response to senescence-inducing or growth-inhibitory
  signals, such as the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). Upon RB phosphorylation,
  E2F transcription factors are able to activate transcription of a plethora of S
  phase-promoting genes, including cyclins E1 and E2. Cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are
  kept inactive by interaction with inhibitors p27KIP1 and p21CIP1 that are regulated
  by growth-inhibitory signals and the p53-dependent G1 DNA damage checkpoint. Activation
  of cyclin E-CDK2 involves several mechanisms including the sequestration of p27KIP1
  and p21CIP1 by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes, and phosphorylation of p27KIP1 by cyclin
  E-CDK2 kinase. Active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes further phosphorylate RB, as well
  as many other targets culminating in S phase entry.b: During G2 phase, the MuvB
  complex associates with the transcription factor FOXM1 and binds promoters containing
  cell cycle genes homology region (CHR) elements, thereby inducing transcription
  of genes required for entry into and progression through mitosis (M phase), including
  B-type cyclins. Activation of cyclin B-CDK1 kinase requires phosphorylation of CDK1
  at Thr-161 by the cyclin H-CDK7 complex (CAK, CDK-activating kinase) as well as
  dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 on CDK1 by cell division cycle 25 (CDC25)
  family phosphatases, the latter process being antagonized by protein kinases MYT1
  and WEE1. Activation of CDK1 is prevented in response to activation of the CHK1-dependent
  G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Upon recovery from DNA damage, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)
  is essential to re-activate CDK1. Activation of cyclin A/B-CDK1 complexes is required
  and sufficient for entry into mitosis. Red and blue ovals denote positive and negative
  regulators of cell cycle transitions, respectively.AKT, v-akt murine thymoma viral
