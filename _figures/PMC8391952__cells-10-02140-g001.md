caption: Illustration of the human bone marrow cell restricted pathways of the differentiation
  of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells. In the lower right box, the
  erythroid cell restricted lineage differentiation is shown. HSCs give rise to common
  myeloid progenitors (CMP) and common megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEP).
  The latter are differentiated into erythropoietin-responsive BFU-E and CFU-E clones,
  shown by the arrows where human EPO acts upon them. Interactions of EPO with its
  homodimeric EPO-R lead to cell signaling activation pathways that increase the biosynthesis
  of hemoglobin. The levels of hemoglobins increase as erythropoiesis continues in
  the proerythroblasts, in the orthochomatic normoblasts (ON) and finally in the reticulocytes
  and mature red blood cells (RBCs) following the extrusion of the nucleus. Erythropoiesis
  is homeostatically regulated by low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia) and the final end
  production via a feedback action loop. The original figure was published by Tsiftsoglou
  et al. [] and has been lightly modified accordingly to indicate where EPO acts upon
  in the proerythroid cells. The initial commitment to the erythroid cell lineage
  restricted pathway of differentiation begins at the level of BM HSCs and leads to
  the formation of MEPs that yield BFU-Es and CFU-Es. The most recently published
  work by Eisele et al. [] provided direct evidence indicating that EPO indeed acts
  upon the BM HSCs to promote commitment towards the erythroid maturation.
