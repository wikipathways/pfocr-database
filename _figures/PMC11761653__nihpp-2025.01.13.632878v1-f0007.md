caption: a) The predicted biosynthetic pathway for Dityromycin. DtyH, DtyJ, and DtyK
  are all cytochrome p450 enzymes, and are likely responsible for hydroxylation and
  cross-linkage of the Tyrocine residues. DtyA and DtyB are 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenases
  and enoyl-CoA hydratases, respectively, and in conjunction with the p450 enzymes,
  are likely responsible for the modification of Isoleucine to E-2-amino-3-hydroxymethyl-4,5-epoxy-α,β-dehydropentanoic
  acid. DtyL is a methyltransferase that methylates one of the Tyrosine residues.
  b) Paired mass spectrometry data for this molecule was obtained from Streptomyces
  kasugaensis NBRC 13851. c) Annotated mass fragments providing evidence that this
  molecule, or an isomer, is present in the biological sample
