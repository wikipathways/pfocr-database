caption: Schematic molecular mechanism of LPA's effects on ion channel regulation.
  (A) LPA (1- or 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) binds to LPA1 or LPA2 receptors regulating
  specific ion channels in the pain pathway. LPA1/2 receptor are coupled to the Gα12/13signaling
  pathway that activates the Rho cascade, positively regulating (+) Cav3.2 and the
  α2δ1 subunit of Cav2.2 channels. Furthermore, the LPA1/2 receptors are also coupled
  to Gαq/11 leading to PLC (phospholipase C) activation to produce IP3 (inositol-3
  phosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP3 increases the release of intracellular
  calcium which activates calcium-dependent enzymes such as CaM (calmodulin) and calcineurin
  and the latter positively regulates (+) TRESK channels. In addition, DAG can also
  activate PKC (protein kinase C) which positively regulates (+) TRPV1 and Nav1.8
  but negatively (–) regulates TREK1 channels. (B) Direct interaction of LPA through
  binding with lysine 710 located in the C-terminus of TRPV1 produces channel activation
  allowing for ion influx (PDB 3J5R Liao et al., ). (C) TREK channels are positively
  regulated by LPA, this effect is probably produced by the insertion of the phospholipid
  into the plasma membrane, causing a change in the membrane curvature that modifies
  the activity of these mechanosensitive channels (PDB 4TWK; Miller and Long, ).
