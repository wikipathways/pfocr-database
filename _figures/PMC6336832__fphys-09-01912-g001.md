caption: Simplified model of environmental, cell autonomous and systemic (antiviral)
  RNAi in insects. The siRNA pathway is triggered by dsRNA molecules. These duplexes
  naturally occur inside the cell during viral replication or can be artificially
  delivered. In the latter, cellular uptake of dsRNA, i.e., environmental RNAi, occurs
  via scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, i.e., cell autonomous
  RNAi, the dsRNA molecules are recognized in the cytoplasm and processed into siRNAs
  by Dcr2. Cleavage of viral RNA targets or endogenous transcripts is then further
  exerted by an Ago2-containing RISC, which encompasses the siRNA guide strand. Regarding
  antiviral RNAi in Drosophila, viral infection increases the formation of nanotube-like
  structures, through which short-distance transport of dsRNA and RISC components
  can occur. In addition, hemocyte-derived exosome-like vesicles systemically spread
  an antiviral RNAi signal (vsRNAs) in the hemolymph. This spread of the RNAi signal
  to cells in which the RNAi response had not been initiated before is named systemic
  RNAi. dsRNA, double stranded RNA. Dcr2, Dicer2. siRNA, small interfering RNA. RISC,
  RNA-induced silencing complex. Ago2, Argonaute2. vsRNA, viral small RNAs.
