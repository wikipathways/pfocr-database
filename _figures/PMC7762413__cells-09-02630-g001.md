caption: Roles of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and Wnt signaling in bone
  strength maintenance. Bone strength depends on bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture;
  disturbances in any of them lead to increased risk of fractures. Human musculoskeletal
  disorders with mutations in TGF-β or Wnt family members have revealed the key role
  of these pathways in regulating bone strength. Thus, mutations in different TGF-β
  family members leading to an increased pool of active TGF-β and therefore an increased
  TGF-β signaling give rise to rare disorders characterized by low bone mineral density,
  alterations in bone microarchitecture and increased risk of fractures. This is the
  case of Marfan (MFS) and Loeys–Dietz (LDS) syndromes and Camurati–Engelmann disease
  (CED), with mutations in FBN1 (Fibrillin-1), TGFβ receptors (TGFβR1 and TGFβR2)
  and LAP, respectively. In the case of the Wnt pathway, mutations leading to increased
  Wnt signaling can cause high bone mass disorders, whereas inactivating mutations
  of the Wnt pathway are associated to low bone mass disorders with different ranges
  of severities. Thus, heterozygous mutations in Wnt1 or SNPs in Wnt16 can lead to
  osteoporosis (OP) whereas homozygous mutations of Wnt1 cause osteogenesis imperfecta
  (OI). Moreover, autosomal recessive loss of function mutations in LRP5 are known
  to cause the rare osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) characterized by extremely
  severe childhood onset osteoporosis. For definitions of other abbreviations, please
