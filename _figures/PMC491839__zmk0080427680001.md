caption: 'Schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydrofolate.
  The successive reactions shown here are catalyzed by the following enzymes: GTPCH,
  GTP-cyclohydrolase; DHNA, dihydroneopterin aldolase; HPPK, 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin-pyrophosphokinase;
  DHPS, 7,8-dihydropteroate synthase; DHFS, dihydrofolate synthase (folylpolyglutamate
  synthase); DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. In S. cerevisiae the GTPCH activity is
  encoded by FOL2 (). The phosphatase(s) (Pase) that presumably removes the phosphate
  residues of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate might be encoded by PHO8 (). FOL1
  described in this work encodes the next three enzymatic activities. The DHFS activity
  is brought about by the FOL3 gene (), whereas the DHFR activity is encoded by DFR1
  (). Tetrahydrofolate supplies the one-carbon pool with C1 carrier units, which act
  as enzyme cofactors in one-carbon transfer reactions involved in various biosynthetic
  activities ().'
