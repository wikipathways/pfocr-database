caption: 'The core mechanism of ferroptosis and related kinases affect the signaling
  pathway. Ferroptosis is characterized by the disruption of iron homeostasis, the
  production of toxic lipid peroxides, and the inhibition of antioxidant systems.
  Key components that promote ferroptosis include the transferrin-transferrin receptor
  (TF-TFRC) complex, iron export transporters, and ferritin autophagy, all of which
  contribute to increased iron accumulation, limited iron efflux, and reduced iron
  storage, respectively. The overload of divalent iron ions also causes the Fenton
  reaction, which generates excessive free radicals and then oxidises phospholipids,
  generating toxic lipid peroxides and triggering ferroptosis. The ACSL4-LPCAT3-ALOXs
  pathway is crucial for promoting ferroptosis by activating lipid peroxidation, which
  produces PLOOH from PUFA in conjunction with Rab7A-dependent fat phagocytosis. Various
  antioxidant systems, including the Xc-system-GSH-GPX4, AIFM2-CoQ10, GTP-GCH1-BH4,
  and ESCRT-II membrane repair systems, play a role in inhibiting lipid peroxidation.
  Additionally, TYRO3 can enhance the resistance of tumor cells to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy
  by inhibiting ferroptosis and supporting a pro-tumor TME. DDR2 activates YAP/TAZ-mediated
  expression through SRC, promoting ferroptosis in relapsed tumor cells. In breast
  cancer, FGFR4 is upregulated to confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies by
  alleviating ferroptosis, and the combined inhibition of FGFR4 and HER2 may elicit
  a synergistic therapeutic effect by inducing ferroptosis. Furthermore, Sirtuin 3
  positively regulates autophagy via the phosphorylation of AMPK. The combination
  of erastin and TGF-β1 therapy can reduce the expression of EMT-related markers and
  inhibit the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer. (Red: Tyrosine kinases; Yellow:
