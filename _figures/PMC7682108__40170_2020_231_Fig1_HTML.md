caption: Intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. When intracellular cholesterol levels
  are low, SREBP-2 is delivered to the Golgi where the active, N-terminal fragment
  is released and translocated to the nucleus where it activates the expression of
  cholesterol-related genes, such as HMGCR and the LDL receptor. The transcriptional
  activation of HGMCR leads to the de novo synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate
  pathway. The activation of the transcription of the LDLR leads to an increase in
  cellular cholesterol uptake through receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL. When cholesterol
  levels are high, SREBP-2 is retained in the ER. In order to prevent over-accumulation
  of free cholesterol in the plasma and intracellular membranes, cholesterol is converted
  to cholesteryl esters primarily by the enzyme ACAT. Cholesteryl esters are stored
  as cytosolic lipid droplets. Excess cholesterol also generates oxysterols, natural
  ligands for LXRs. Their binding to LXRs activates the transcription of genes involved
  in cholesterol efflux, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG5/8. This figure was drawn
