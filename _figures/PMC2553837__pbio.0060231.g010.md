caption: The LRR domain of TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide signal (LPS) and transduces
  the signal across the cell membrane []. An adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88) associated with TLR4 recruits the non-RD serine/threonine kinase,
  IRAK1, which associates with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6
  (TRAF6) in cytoplasm []. TRAF6 forms a complex with TAK1 [] in which the kinase
  activity of, TAK1 mediates downstream events, such as inhibitor of κ kinase complex
  and NF-κB [,].In Arabidopsis, flg22 binds to FLS2, which transduces the pathogen
  signal through its cytoplasmic non-RD kinase domain, and activates MAPK cascade
  []. Several WRKY transcription factors acting downstream of MAPK cascade to induce
  defense-related genes including PR genes []. KAPP, a PP2C, blocks the activated
  FLS signaling and attenuates the downstream innate immune response []. In rice,
  AvrXA21 binding to XA21 activates its cytoplasmic non-RD kinase [,]. XA21 transphosphorylates
  proteins such as XB3, which are required for the defense response []. In the nucleus,
  WRKY transcription factors activate defense-related genes such as PR1 and PR10 of
  XA21 signaling pathway. Recruitment of XB15 to Ser697 in the XA21 JM domain and
  subsequent dephosphorylation of phosphorylated residue(s) attenuates XA21 signaling.
