caption: 'Overview of current ABCA7 AD-related evidence from in vitro model systems,
  in vivo model systems, and human-based studies. A possible pathogenic pathway is
  shown: alterations on the ABCA7 DNA (transcription) level (orange) can affect cellular
  homeostasis and functions (red), leading to changes in the brain and potential neurodegenerative
  disease (purple). The arrow style (ranging from dashed lines to thick full lines)
  corresponds to the strength of current evidence supporting that connection'
