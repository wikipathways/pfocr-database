caption: Dual coordinated regulation of CYP7A1 by the FXR-SHP-LRH-1 and FXR-FGF15/19-FGFR4
  pathways. FXR-mediated signaling from the intestine and within the liver regulates
  CYP7A1 expression and in turn bile acid synthesis. Bile acid accumulation within
  hepatocytes provokes negative feedback on their own synthesis via the FXR-SHP-LRH-1
  pathway. The accumulation of bile acids within enterocytes as a result of intestinal
  reabsorption induces the expression of murine FGF15 (FGF19 in humans), which signals
  at the liver upon binding with the receptor, FGFR4. This signal indicates the extent
  of intestinal reabsorption so that the level of de novo bile acid synthesis within
  hepatocytes can be appropriately modulated. Both pathways contribute to the downregulation
  of CYP7A1 with the FXR-FGF15/19-FGFR4 pathway exerting dominance, most likely due
  to the high efficiency of bile acid recycling. This ultimately leads to decreased
  bile acid synthesis and transient fluctuations in the bile acid pool size.
