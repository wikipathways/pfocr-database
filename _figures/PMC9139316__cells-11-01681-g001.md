caption: 'Mechanism of DNA effectors STING, ZBP1, and inflammasome activation in response
  to DNA. Inflammasome initiation of inflammatory cytokine activation and pyroptosis
  following nucleic acid stimulation can occur directly in the ALR inflammasomes AIM2
  and IFI16. However, inflammasome activation to DNA, particularly by the NLR inflammasome
  NLRP3, may also be regulated by caspase-11/4/5 activation or the DNA sensing effectors
  STING and ZBP1. Upon sensing of DNA, effector STING in the cGAS axis induces the
  production of Type I IFNs, initiating IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) and JAK-STAT
  activation of Interferon-stimulated Response Elements (IRSEs). This, in turn, promotes
  priming of inflammasome components and DNA effectors. The DNA sensing effector ZBP1
  also initiates inflammasome activation and multiple forms of cell death in the proposed
  PAN-optosome pathway of cell death [,,,,,,,,,]. Created with BioRender.com (Agreement
