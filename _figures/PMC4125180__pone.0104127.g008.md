caption: The model shows interaction amongst various intracellular signaling pathways
  activated by LH, PGF2α and E2. The luteolysis process induced by PGF2α treatment
  appears to be a result of distinct molecules that involve hormone biosynthesis pathways
  (StAR, CYP19A1) which is downstream of PTGFR signaling leading to decrease in serum
  and luteal P4 and E2 levels. The model also shows involvement of Bcl-2 family members,
  Bax (pro-apoptotic) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) that cause changes in mitochondrial
  permeability to apoptogenic molecules. The model also shows inhibition of cell survival
  pathway as shown by LH/CGR and ER (both genomic and non-genomic signaling) down
  regulation and in turn inhibition of downstream molecules (CREB, FKHR). Few of the
  selected genes out of differentially expressed genes at different time points post
  PGF2α treatment compared with 0 h PGF2α treatment (StAR, CYP19A1, Bax, Bcl-2, CREB,
  FKHR) has been provided in the Figure. The information on gene names, general function,
  fold change in mRNA expression and implicated pathways are represented. The stimulation
  and inhibition of specific molecules downstream of different signaling pathways
  are represented by green (+) and red (−) signs, respectively.
