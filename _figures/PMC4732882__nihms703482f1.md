caption: Metabolism and the circadian clock converge. A paradigm example is represented
  by the role of SIRT1 and other sirtuins in clock regulation. The circadian machinery
  controls a large fraction of the genome through the transcriptional regulation of
  CCGs. One of the CCGs is the gene encoding the protein NAMPT, the rate-limiting
  enzyme in the NAD+-salvage pathway. Cyclic transcriptional control of the Nampt
  gene results in the cyclic synthesis of NAD+, which in turn is consumed rhythmically
  by enzymes, such as SIRT1 whose deacetylase activity is consequently cyclic. One
  of the non-histone targets is the enzyme AceCS1, which contributes to the synthesis
  of Acetyl-CoA. AceCS1 is acetylated at one residue, Lys661, and its cyclic deacetylation
  by SIRT1 activates the enzyme, resulting in cyclic synthesis of Acetyl-CoA and thereby
  oscillating availability of acetyl groups required for global acetylation.
