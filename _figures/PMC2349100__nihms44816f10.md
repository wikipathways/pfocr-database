caption: Proposed pathways for JNK-dependent and JNK-independent apoptosis induction
  by arsenite and vincristine. (A) Vincristine induced microtubule damage leads to
  phosphorylation of JNK which, in turn, translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates
  the transcription factor c-Jun leading to the induction of multiple nuclear substrates,
  including c-Jun itself. In addition, activated JNK phosphorylates the cytoplasmic
  substrate, Bcl-2 at thr-56 leading to its inactivation. The JNK inhibitor SP6 blocks
  c-Jun induction as well as Bcl-2 phosphorylation leading to an inhibition of apoptosis.
  Non-lethal heat stress also attenuates vincristine-induced phosphorylation of JNK
  and Bcl-2 thus blocking the induction of apoptosis. Whether this is due to the stabilization
  of microtubules by heat stress proteins or by direct effects of hypethermia on the
  JNK pathway is presently unknown. (B) Global proteotoxic damage induced by arsenite
  exposure leads to the phosphorylation of JNK that, in turn, phosphorylates the transcription
  factor c-Jun, leading to the induction of nuclear substrates, including c-Jun itself.
  However, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic substrate Bcl-2 does not occur and inhibiting
  JNK with SP6 does not attenuate apoptosis. Lethal heat stress or arsenite (but not
  vincristine or non-lethal heat stress) induce a robust p53 response that is associated
  with apoptosis induction in this scenario.

  Bcl-2 phosphorylation to apoptosis induction in human B-cells is dependent on the
