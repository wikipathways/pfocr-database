caption: a), A cross-section of a generic Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope. Lipid
  A comprises the hydrophobic membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is
  the major structural component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. b), A
  summary the constitutive lipid A biosynthesis pathway in a generic LpxI-containing
  Gram-negative bacterium. The glucosamine saccharides of the lipid A precursors are
  drawn in cyan, while lipid A biosynthetic enzymes are shown in purple or blue. LpxI
  (or LpxH) and LpxB perform catalysis at the cytoplasmic interface of the inner membrane.
  Kdo2-Lipid A is the minimum structure required for growth and viability in most
  Gram-negative bacteria.
