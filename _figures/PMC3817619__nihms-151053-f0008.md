caption: The extrinsic pathway is blocked by ARC’s ability to bind heterotrophically
  to Fas and FADD and prevent assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC).
  Subsequently, activation of caspase-8 is inhibited and apoptosis is prevented. ARC
  blocks the intrinsic pathway with its ability to bind to BAX and block BAX’s conformational
  activation and translocation to the mitochondria.
