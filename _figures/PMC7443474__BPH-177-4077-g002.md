caption: 'miRNAs regulation of key factors in cellular pathways involved in DCU healing.
  Left: Wnt/β‐catenin pathway. Wnt1 protein binds Frizzled and LRP5/6, and then this
  conjugate phosphorylates dishevelled (DSH) and inhibits GSK3β activity, which later
  inhibits the accumulation of un‐phosphorylated molecules of β‐catenin and make β‐catenin
  move into the nucleus of cells. This signalling pathway is then activated when β‐catenin
  binds to the transcription factor TCF. miR‐233‐3p, together with target genes DDK3,
  AXIN2, and FRAT2, promotes the proliferation and angiogenesis of fibroblasts and
  macrophages during wound healing and accelerates wound healing by regulating the
  activated Wnt/β‐catenin signal pathway. Right: NF‐κB pathway. Both canonical and
  non‐canonical NF‐κB pathways are activated through similar mechanisms. The canonical
  pathway suppresses the NF‐κB signal via IκB molecules. In the process of chronic
  wound healing, when the external signalling molecule stimulates the NF‐κB signal
  pathway, the intracellular NF‐κB molecule binds with the IκB complex. Under the
  action of phosphorylase kinase, the IκB complex is phosphorylated, thus releasing
  the active NF‐κB molecule from phosphorylated IκB. At the same time, the phosphorylated
  IκB is degraded and the NF‐κB molecules enter the nucleus through TLR‐4, which leads
  to activation of NF‐κB target genes IL‐6, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IMP‐2. Thus, when miRNAs
  and mRNA act on the target genes of activated NF‐κB, the inflammatory reaction,
  immune response, and cell proliferation process during wound healing are regulated,
  and the wound healing is accelerated'
