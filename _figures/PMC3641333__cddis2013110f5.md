caption: Working model for DR6/p75NTR receptor complex signaling in cortical neurons.
  In the presence of NTs, p75NTR binds NTs and Trk to promote cortical neuron survival
  via the AKT (also known as Protein Kinase B) pathway. In the absence of NTs, p75NTR
  binds Aβ and DR6 to form a receptor complex, which activates the caspase 3 apoptotic
  signaling pathway via a cytoplasmic death domain oligomeric complex. In Alzheimer's
  disease, various factors might switch p75NTRsignaling from pro-survival to pro-death,
  including the increased level of Aβ, upregulation of DR6 and p75NTR, and decreased
  expression of Trk

  death.
