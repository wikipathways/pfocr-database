caption: Proposed conceptual framework for the involvement of CXCR signaling in modulating
  Th1/Th17-driven pathologies. Initiation of Th1/Th17 T-cell development can be triggered
  by the activation of multiple CXCRs, including CXCR1 and CXCR2 in neutrophils (NEUs);
  CXCR3 in dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer cells (NKs), and T lymphocytes (T
  cells); CXCR4 in DCs, T cells, and macrophages (Mφ); and CXCR6 in DCs, T cells,
  Mφ, and NKs. Activation of these CXCR-mediated signaling cascades triggers upregulated
  secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, type II interferons (predominantly IFNγ
  produced by T cells), and chemokines, which eventually facilitate the acquisition
  of the Th1/Th17 phenotype by T cells, progressing from the Th0 stage. Activation
  of the Th1/Th17 phenotype supports the recruitment and activation of immune cells,
  enabling a robust immune response against both pathogens and environmental insults,
  but hyperstimulation of the Th1/Th17 pathway is associated with the pathogenic processes
  of multiple skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and
  cancers
