caption: IR injury first initiates (I) oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  followed by (II) inflammation and (III) epigenetic modification, finally activates
  (IV) p53/p21 and p16 senescence pathway and cause cellular senescence. (I) IR injury
  may damage the function of mitochondria in parenchymal cells such as renal tubular
  epithelial cells, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes, lead to ROS generation
  through downregulation of TREM-1 and klotho and can also mediated by mitophagy defficiency.
  (II) Inflammation response is characterized by infiltration of immune cells such
  as macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the mesenchyme which are recruited
  by ROS generated by oxidative stress initially. The infiltrating inflammatory cells
  will release pro-inflammatory factors (also known as SASP if released by senescent
  cells) such as IL-6 and IL-8. Besides, senescent parenchymal cells can also release
  SASP to amplify the inflammation response. (III) Multiple kinds of epigenetic modification
  including m6A modification, DNA methylation, histone, and p53 acetylation, miRNAs
  and LncRNAs are involved in IR-induced senescence. (IV) p53/p21 pathway and p16
  pathway are the final signaling to induce cellular senescence.
