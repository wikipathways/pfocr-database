caption: Immune-related biological processes during the distraction period of DO.
  Relationship between immune cells, cytokines, and inflammation-related signal pathways
  in the distraction period of DO. Macrophages are polarized under stretch stimulation,
  thereby transforming from M1 to M2 phenotype, releasing the anti-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-10 and TGF-β, plus TGF-β that is secreted by osteoblasts and other precursor
  cells together regulate immunosuppressive microenvironment and promote the proliferation
  of osteoblasts. Simultaneously, the activation of YAP in macrophages promotes the
  secretion of BMP by macrophages. Then, BMP will take over the role of TGF-β to continuallypromote
  the proliferation of osteogenic precursor cells, leading to an effective differentiation
  into osteocytes. The role of BMP is achieved via the Smad signaling pathway. Moreover,
  BMP can activate the MAPK kinase TAK1 to activate the MAPK-related signaling pathways,
  leading to a higher secretion of IL-6 in osteoblasts. IL-6 will promote the recruitment
  and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast-related cells. Osteoclasts are also
  active during the distraction period. That is, they participate in the absorption
  of cartilage callus and the remodeling of new bones on both sides of the distraction
  gap. The expression of RANKL secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes increases during
  the distraction period, and RANKL combines with RANK on osteoclast-related cells
  to promote the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. Simultaneously, OPG
  expression is also upregulated, thereby inhibiting RANKL and regulating balance
  in bone resorption
