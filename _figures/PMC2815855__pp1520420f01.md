caption: Approach used for the reconstruction of an integrative molecular interaction
  network. We take as an example, the well-known WUS-CLV regulatory loop. Genetic
  interactions show that WUS is necessary for CLV3 activation and that it is itself
  repressed by CLV3 and CLV1, two genes acting in the same genetic pathway (for details
  see text). Expression data show that each of these three genes has a distinct and
  specific expression pattern within the meristem. From a molecular point of view,
  CLV3 encodes a ligand that is secreted and physically binds to the CLV1 receptor
  kinase. The protein complex formed by this interaction is necessary to restrict
  the expression of WUS in the organizing center. The structure of the molecular regulatory
  network is given by the molecular interactions between the entities of this network.
  For each element differentially localized among regions, the network must reproduce
  the active or inactive state of the corresponding element and the incident interactions
  must therefore be able to account for these different states. The network can then
  be used to run simulations and see which stable states can be obtained. In parallel,
  expression data for the molecular elements of the network can be compiled and superposed
  on a virtual meristem to identify zones of cells that coexpress the same set of
  elements. In principle, the stable states of the network should correspond to the
  coexpression zones observed. Lastly, genetic interaction data, which give information
  on the dynamic of the network but not on the molecular trajectories, should be explained
  by the molecular network. Due to the lack of available molecular interaction data,
  the problem is in fact to build the network. In the case of WUS-CLV, we not only
  lack molecular interactions (for example, is the repression of WUS by CLV3-CLV1
  direct?) but we also cannot explain WUS and CLV1 expression pattern since their
  activators are unidentified yet. In addition, it is likely that there exists an
  intermediate messenger for the activation of CLV3 by WUS since their expression
  pattern does not overlap. We can therefore introduce hypothetical molecular interactions
  (dotted arrows) and see if it is consistent with both expression and genetic data.
  These hypothetical interactions can then be tested experimentally and used either
  to confirm the validity of the network, or to introduce alternative interactions.
  This is an iterative process that requires the use of computer modeling to run simulations
  and to generate predictions.
