caption: In response to extracellular biomechanical (e.g., matrix stiffness) and biochemical
  (e.g., active TGF-β1) stimuli, lung fibroblasts undergo actin cytoskeleton remodeling
  and activation of the actomyosin contractile system, resulting in MKL1 translocation
  from cytoplasm to nucleus, where it activates fibrotic genes that specify myofibroblast
  differentiation. Inhibition of ROCK blocks actin cytoskeletal reorganization, fibroblast
  acquisition of contractile activity, and MKL1 nuclear translocation, preventing
  fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. On the other hand, ROCK inhibition
  disrupts actin cytoskeleton required for myofibroblast contractility in preexisting
  myofibroblasts. This deactivates constitutively activated MKL1 nuclear signal in
  myofibroblasts, resulting in downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 and
  activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
