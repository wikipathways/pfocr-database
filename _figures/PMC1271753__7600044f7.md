caption: 'Proposed model. Based on our findings, the following model is proposed for
  TNFα-induced TRAF2-mediated activation of diverse signaling pathways: first, upon
  TNFα treatment, TRAF2 is recruited to TNFR through TRADD where TRAF2, in turn, recruits
  upstream kinase(s) and activates the IKK signaling pathway; independently, TRAF2
  undergoes Ubc13-dependent ubiquitination, which induces its translocation to the
  insoluble membrane rafts, where it is likely to recruit upstream kinases (e.g. MEKK1
  and GCK). Although the complex assembled within the lipid rafts may suffice for
  the activation of JNK per se, further translocation of TRAF2 to insoluble cytoskeletal
  (or other cytosolic positioned) fraction occurs to bring JNK to necessary substrates
  (i.e. paxillin). It is also possible that localization within the insoluble portion
  serves to limit the duration of JNK activity. Neither ubiquitination, nor TRAF2
  RING activity or translocation is required for the activation of p38 or IKK, indicating
  that the latter are subjected to alternate regulatory quos.'
