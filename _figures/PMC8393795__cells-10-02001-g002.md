caption: 'Probable evolutionary fates of self-splicing introns. (A) Homing endonuclease-open
  reading frame (HE-ORF) of Group I introns follow the Goddard–Burt life cycle, with
  slightly altered fates in bacterial derived organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts)
  and archaeal derived nuclear genomes. (i) For bacterial derived organelles, the
  Group I ribozyme is conserved in the absence of tRNA endonuclease and ligase and
  is eventually lost during evolution when the intron function is lost or becomes
  redundant; (ii) For archaea derived nuclear genomes, the Group I ribozyme ability
  was lost in favor of an alternate intron removal pathway recruiting the tRNA endonuclease
  and ligase. Because of this recruitment, the Group I introns in archaea have probably
  evolved into BHB introns, both can encode homing endonucleases and these intron
  types can be distinguished by computational approaches []. (B) Origin of spliceosome
  from Group II introns involves domestication of the self-splicing introns (during
  eukaryogenesis) and recruitment of protein components into the spliceosome. The
  order of intron decay and protein recruitment is debatable; (i) Recruitment-first
  theory: recruitment of Smith antigen (Sm) protein cofactors, followed by RNA helicase
  (with probable exosomal function); subsequent partial degeneration of the introns
  []; (ii) Decay-first theory: decay of self-splicing introns, requiring the recruitment
  of Group II-derived RNAs, which evolved into the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and
  associated Sm proteins []; (iii) ‘Frozen event’ theory: starts with RNA components,
  at least U6 snRNA, associated with a homomeric, and later heteromeric Sm-like (Lsm)
  ring whose interaction can be seen as a ‘frozen event’; addition of other snRNAs,
  accompanied by the Sm ring. Irrespective of the order of events, eventually intron
  degradation and substitution of Group II intron activity by reverse transcriptase
  (RT)-like pre-mRNA splicing factor 8 (Prp8) activity led to the emergence of the
  complex spliceosome in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA) [].'
