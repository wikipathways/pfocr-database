caption: Overview of regulatory signaling pathways activating Schwann cells (SCs)
  response in peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR). (Ai) The FAK-Src pathway regulates
  SC proliferation and reprogramming through the binding of ALLO to the GABA-A receptor.
  (ii) The JAK/STAT signaling pathway enhances axonal outgrowth in PNR by upregulating
  growth factor secretion. Activated by growth factors CNTF and BDNF, this pathway
  enhances SC redifferentiation through the transcription of differentiation-driving
  genes. (B) The mechanotransducive signaling pathway regulates SC proliferation,
  reprogramming, and myelin expression. (i) SC proliferation is regulated by the inhibition
  of the protein Gnas. (ii) Mechanical stimuli activate G-protein coupling receptors
  and Piezo1 in SCs, regulating YAP/TAZ and promoting SC reprogramming by regulating
  the transcription of myelin genes. (iii) For SC redifferentiation, YAP/TAZ, along
  with effectors TEAD and SOX10, promote the transcription of myelin genes, driving
  the switch to the pro-myelinating phenotype. ALLO, Allopregnanolone; NT3, neurotrophin-3;
  BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; JAK, Janus Kinase; Src, proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase; YAP, Yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional co-activator
  with a PDZ-binding motif; TEAD, TEA domain family member; Gnas, guanine nucleotide-binding
  protein; Gαs, Gs alpha guanine nucleotide-binding signal transduction protein; SOX10,
  SRY-box transcription factor 10
