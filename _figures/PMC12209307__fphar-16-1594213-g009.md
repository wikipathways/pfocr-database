caption: A diagram of the mechanisms by which tricin fighting against KRAS-mutant
  NSCLC. Tricin inhibited the growth of KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC primarily by suppressing
  PDGF-BB-induced SRC/MAPK/AP-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. On the other hand, tricin
  facilitated the increased number of CD8+ T lymphocytes along with functional cytokines
  TNFα, IFNγ, and Granzyme B. Tricin also increased the number of B lymphocytes as
  well as broke the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
papertitle: Tricin selectively combats KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer by inhibiting
  the PDGF-BB-induced SRC/MAPK/AP-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway and potentiating the antitumor
  effect of an anti-PD-1 antibody
