caption: Mechanisms of halofuginone action. Under normal conditions, prolyl‐tRNA is
  aminoacylated with l‐proline by prolyl‐tRNA synthetase and made available for protein
  synthesis. Halofuginone inhibits the action of prolyl‐tRNA synthetase and in turn
  generates elevated levels of uncharged prolyl‐tRNA that can bind GCN2 (general control
  nonderepressible 2). Once bound by uncharged tRNA, GCN2 is activated by autophosphorylation
  and then phosphorylates eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α), which
  leads to gene transcription and activation of the AAR (amino acid response) pathway.
