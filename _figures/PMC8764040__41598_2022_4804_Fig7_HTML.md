caption: (A) Simplified schematic alteration of central carbon metabolism in C2C12
  myotubes versus myoblasts with a heat map of the log2 fold change of average metabolites
  levels in Serum, B27, and AIM-V cultures. The student’s t-test was performed. Bold
  lines indicate statistically significant metabolite levels (p < 0.05). Dark gray
  color metabolites were not determined. Direct reactions are shown by continuous
  lines, a series of reactions are indicated by dashed lines. TCA tricarboxylic acid,
  PPP pentose phosphate pathway, Glc ex consumption of glucose, Gln ex consumption
  of glutamine, Lac ex secretion of lactate. Significant different pyruvate metabolisms
  were shown in myotubes cultured in Serum, B27, AIM-V at day 7. The graphs were illustrated
  using OMIX 2.0 software. (B) Pyruvate reduction into Lactate and (C) Transamination
  to Alanine. (n) = 4. **p < 0.01. Data presented as average ± standard deviation
  (SD).
