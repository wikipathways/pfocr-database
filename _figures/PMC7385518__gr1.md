caption: Hormone-synthesis pathway and various targets that are currently used or
  considered to inhibit prostate cancer growth. Clinically cyp-17 enzymes, 5-α reductase,
  and AR are validated as therapeutic targets and drugs targeting them are available.
  Preclinically HSDs have been validated, but yet to be extensively tested in the
  clinic. AR, androgen receptor; DHEA, dihydroepiandrosterone; DHEAS, dehydroepiandrosterone
  sulfate; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
