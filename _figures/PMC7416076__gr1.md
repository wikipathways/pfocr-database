caption: Schematic review of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system controlled
  by oxygen content. Under normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) catalyze
  the hydroxylation of two proline residues within the oxygen-dependent degradation
  domain of HIF-α. These hydroxylation modifications allow the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)
  E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to bind and catalyzes ubiquitination on HIF-α, which
  eventually leads to its proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, the factor inhibiting
  HIF-1 (FIH) catalyzes an additional hydroxylation on the asparagine residue of HIF-α.
  The asparagine hydroxylation blocks the transcriptional co-activator p300 from binding
  with HIF-α, thereby inhibiting HIF transcriptional activity. Both PHDs and FIH belong
  to the 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)–dependent dioxygenase family that uses oxygen and 2-OG
  as cosubstrates and Fe(II) as cofactor to catalyze the hydroxylation reaction. Their
  enzymatic activity can be repressed by some oncogenic metabolic intermediates, such
  as 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of PHDs and
  FIH is inhibited because of lack of oxygen. Unhydroxylated HIF-α translocates to
  the nucleus, forms a complex with HIF-β and p300, and activates transcription of
  HIF target genes. HRE, hypoxia response element; OH, hydroxide.
