caption: PP2A negatively regulates the mTOR signaling pathway. The mTOR complexes
  are colored blue. Proteins involved in mTOR inhibition and activation are colored
  red and green, respectively with PP2A in purple. Downstream factors inhibiting and
  stimulating growth are colored magenta and teal, respectively. Growth factors stimulate
  the mTOR pathway via inhibiting the function of the TSC complex that inhibits mTOR
  activation. Wnt signaling can inhibit the TSC complex or directly stimulate mTORC2.
  Amino acids can also stimulate mTOR activity. PP2A inhibits the mTOR pathway by
  inhibiting IRS1 in the insulin signaling pathway or MAP4K3 in the amino acid pathway,
  or by inhibiting AKT function. PP2A can also reverse mTOR phosphorylation of S6K.
