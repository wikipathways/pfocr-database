caption: Six candidate pathways identified by pathway topology analysis that have
  a significant impact on yam tuber dormancy regulation. (a) is linoleic acid metabolic
  pathway, it exerted a maximum impact of 1, on a scale of 0 to 1. (b) is phenylalanine
  metabolic pathway, it exerted an impact of 0.79. (c) is galactose metabolic pathway
  with an impact value of 0.76. (d) is starch and sucrose metabolic pathway with an
  impact value of 0.59. (e) is Alanine–aspartate–glutamine metabolic pathway with
  an impact value of 0.57. (f) is the purine metabolic pathway with an impact value
  of 0.54.
