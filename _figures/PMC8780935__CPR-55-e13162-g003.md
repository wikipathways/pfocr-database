caption: A simplified display of the Hh signalling pathway. In the presence of the
  Hh protein, the combination of Hh and Ptch abolishes the suppressive effects on
  Smo delivered by Ptch; then, Hh signalling is activated and the Hh signals are transducted
  into cells. After that, transcription factors Glis family are dissociated from a
  suppressive complex containing Sufu and further activated. Subsequently, the Hh
  signalling downstream target genes that contribute to certain cellular activities
  are modulated. Hh, hedgehog; Ptch, patched receptor; Smo, smoothened receptor; Gli,
  glioma‐associated oncogene; Sufu, suppressor of fused
