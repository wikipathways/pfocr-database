caption: Role of tetraspanins in exosome biogenesis and modulation of immune signaling.
  (A) Role of tetraspanins in exosome biogenesis is shown. The early endosome formation
  is the first step in vesicle uptake and recycling. Development of early multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs, shown in green complex) is dependent on sorting of cytosolic proteins,
  clathrin-coated membranes, RNA molecules, tetraspanin-enriched domains (TEMs), and
  lipid rafts. The sorting and packaging of several other molecules into exosomes
  cannot be ruled out and has not been shown for simplicity. Some mature multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) fuse with the hydrolytic lysosome, where the vesicular cargo is subsequently
  degraded. The membranes of late MVBs fuses with the plasma membrane resulting in
  the release of exosomes/EVs into the extracellular environment. (B) Tetraspanins
  role in miRNA modulation is shown. Tetraspanins directly or indirectly interacts
  with different signaling molecules and receptor(s) at the membranes/lipid rafts,
  and organize into the specialized tetraspanin-enriched micro-domains (TEMs) that
  might play significant role during exosome cargo sorting (miRNAs, RNA, and proteins)
  from viral-infected cells to recipient cell. (C) Tetraspanin involvement in signaling
  pathway is shown. Exosomes are potential in the context of modulation of an immune
  response through their ability to present MHC–peptide complexes to specific cells,
  resulting in activation of T cells and antigen presentation cells.
