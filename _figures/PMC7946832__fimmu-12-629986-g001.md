caption: 'The complement cascade and key canonical and non-canonical activities. Liver-derived
  complement circulating in blood and the lymph can be activated through three pathways
  (of which two have PPR activity): the classical, lectin and alternative pathway.
  The initial deposition of C3b or C3b(H2O), generated by the so-called ‘tick over’
  reaction, onto an activating target also initiates a positive feedback amplification
  loop. The formation of C3 convertases triggered by serum complement pathogen recognition
  then induces cleavage activation of C3 into C3a and C3b. Subsequent C5 convertase
  formation activates C5 into C5a and C5b, with surface-bound C5b triggering the formation
  and insertion of the lytic MAC into pathogen or target membranes. C3b opsonizes
  and tags targets for removal by scavenger cells. Receptors for complement activation
  fragments, such as the anaphylatoxin receptors C3a receptor (C3aR) and C5aR1/2,
  and the C3b receptor CD46 mediate the induction of the general inflammatory reaction
  (vasodilation, neutrophil, mast cell and macrophage influx and activation, etc.)
  which together then lead to pathogen removal as key canonical complement function.

  tissue processes as they mediate normal tissue development, homeostasis and repair

  normal central nervous system (CNS) and brain development and physiology (see text
  for details). The unexpected presence of a cell-intrinsic and intracellularly activated

  now also tightly with the control of single cell metabolism (see text for details).
