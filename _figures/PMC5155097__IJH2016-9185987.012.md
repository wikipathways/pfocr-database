caption: Proposed model of the interaction of leucine, metformin, and sildenafil on
  the AMPK/Sirt1/eNOS network. AMPK, Sirt1, and eNOS are nutrient sensors responsive
  to caloric restriction, regulating energy metabolism in an interacting network.
  In addition, they prevent inflammation and reduce oxidative stress and proliferation,
  the key factors for the progression of NAFLD to NASH. Leucine and metformin synergistically
  activate the AMPK/Sirt1 pathway while sildenafil contributes to further stimulation
  through activation of eNOS. Moreover, sildenafil's inhibition of PDE5 results in
  concomitant activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs). These integrated
  effects result in reduction of hepatic lipid accumulation, hepatic inflammation
  and injury, and subsequently reduction of fibrosis.
