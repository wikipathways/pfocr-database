caption: Effects of E2 on bovine mammary epithelial cells during Staphylococcus aureus
  infection. During S. aureus infection in bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs),
  E2 inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in anti-inflammatory
  effects (decreasing gene expression of IL-1β and IL-6 as well as increasing gene
  expression of IL-10). E2 also actives protein kinase B (Akt), which in turn activates
  transcriptional factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP-1), NF1, or ER, that are
  related to IIR gene expression, such as AMPs, IL-10, or TNF-α. Through the zipper
  mechanism, S. aureus is internalized into epithelial cells, preventing it from being
  detected by the defense system of the host cell. However, E2 can block the signaling
  pathway of the zipper mechanism through the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK), resulting in the reduction of S. aureus internalization. The production of
  antimicrobial molecules (e.g., antimicrobial peptides) by bMECs treated with E2
  also reduces S. aureus viability. However, the identity of the AMPs secreted by
  bMECs remains unknown. By RT-qPCR, the upregulation in the gene expression of DEFB1
  (defensin beta 1), BNBD5 (bovine neutrophil beta-defensin 5), and S100A7 (psoriasin)
  has been shown. E2 induces the expression of TLR2, a key receptor in the recognition
  of S. aureus, as well as upregulates the expression of its receptors (ERα/β) [,
