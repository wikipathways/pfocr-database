caption: Combination treatment with afatinib and crizotinib blocks IRS-1and downstream
  effector pathways like AKT and RAS. Downstream mediators of the mTOR pathway- RPS6KB1
  and RPS6 are also inhibited by the combination. Co-silencing of IRS-1 and RPS6 potentiates
  apoptotic cell death and ablates cellular proliferation. RTKs previously associated
  with BRAFi resistance like AXL and EPHA2 are downregulated in the combination resistance
  cell line, whereas the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p85) is upregulated.
