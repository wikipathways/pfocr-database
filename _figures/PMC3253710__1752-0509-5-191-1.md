caption: Overview of the TOL network. At the metabolic level, m-xylene is first converted
  to 3-methylbenzoate (3 MBz) through the action of the enzymes encoded by the upper
  operon, and this intermediate compound is further metabolized into the TCA cycle
  by the activities born by the meta operon. In the sketch, XylR and XylS are transcriptional
  regulators while Pu, Pm, Ps and Pr are promoters. At the regulatory level, the master
  regulatory gene xylR is encoded in a location adjacent to the end of the meta operon
  and expressed from the Pr promoter (not to scale). The corresponding TF is produced
  in the so-called inactive form (XylRi). This protein changes to an active form (XylRa)
  when bound to the inducer m-xylene or its first intermediate 3-methylbenzyl alcohol
  (3 MBA, not shown). XylRa then activates both Pu and Ps, which triggers expression
  of the upper pathway and stimulates production of XylS respectively []. In the absence
  of m-xylene, this second regulator XylS is produced at low levels, and it changes
  from the inactive form XylSi to the transcriptionally proficient XylSa by binding
  to 3 MBz []. This XylSa form is able to induce meta pathway expression by activating
  Pm. But, concomitantly, high levels of XylS triggered by XylRa-mediated Ps activation
  can also induce Pm activity. This activation loop is formalized as an alternative
  XylS form (XylSh, for hyper-expressed XylS [])

  stems from a metabolic amplifier motif (MAM) that optimizes biodegradation of m-xylene.
