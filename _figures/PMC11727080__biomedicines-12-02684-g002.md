caption: 'Crossroad in amino acid metabolism in macrophages and HCC cells. Metabolism
  of L-arginine and L-glutamine in M1 macrophages/HCC cells and M2 macrophages and
  mitochondrial function. In M1 macrophages and HCC cells, both L-arginine transporter
  and iNOS are overexpressed. The increased level of NO contributes to the activation
  of glycolytic enzymes, whereas citrulline produces fumarate, which supplies the
  interrupted TCA cycle. Furthermore, the increased L-glutamine uptake leads, via
  glutaminase, to L-glutamate, which takes part in the TCA cycle, supplying the energy
  needs of the cell and sustaining arginine metabolism through aspartate recycling.
  In M2 macrophages, L-arginine is converted into L-ornithine by overexpressed ARG1.
  L-ornithine is the substrate for the polyamine biosynthesis into the cytosol and
  produces L-glutamate in mitochondria through OAT. Upregulated GS transforms L-glutamate
  into L-glutamine, which HCC cells use as a carbon source. Abbreviation: ARG—L-arginine;
  SLC7A2—arginine transporter; iNOS—inducible nitric oxide synthase; NO—nitric oxide;
