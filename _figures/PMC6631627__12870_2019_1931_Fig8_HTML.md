caption: Model of ABA-regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis during Lycium fruit ripening.
  The developmental cues transcriptionally activates LbNCED1 and thus enhances endogenous
  ABA accumulation. This accumulation is followed by the transcriptional stimulation
  of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcription factor complex, upregulation of the expression
  of structural genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and finally
  promotion of anthocyanin production and fruit coloration
