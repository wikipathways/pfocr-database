caption: Network associated with the proteins in . The top associated network functions
  with these proteins are ‘hematological system development and function, cell-to-cell
  signaling and interaction, and organismal injury and abnormalities’ based on Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis. Filled-in shapes represent proteins from ; unfilled shapes represent
  relevant nodes/proteins added by Ingenuity. Solid lines connecting proteins indicate
  direct interactions.
