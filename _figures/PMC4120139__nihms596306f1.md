caption: 'An overview of the basal ganglia. Left: A schematic representation of the
  striatal micro-circuitry. The main neuron type in the striatum is the medium spiny
  neuron (MSN), constituting ~95% of striatal neurons. MSNs are the projection neurons
  from the striatum and receive convergent excitatory glutamatergic input mainly from
  cortex and thalamus, inhibitory GABAergic input from neighboring MSNs and striatal
  fast-spiking (FS) and low-threshold spiking (LTS) neurons, cholinergic input from
  cholinergic interneurons (ACh), and dopaminergic input from substantianigra pars
  compacta in the midbrain (SNc). Right: an illustration of the basal ganglia macro-circuitry,
  showing the glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferent inputs to striatum, as well
  as the projections via the direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathways. Approximately
  half of the MSNs belong to the direct pathway; they carry dopamine type 1 receptors
  and project to GPi/SNr. The other MSNs express dopamine type 2 receptors and project
  to GPe (globus pallidus externa) before reaching basal ganglia output structures.
  These output structure neurons control the activity levels of (motor) programs in
  the brain stem and thalamus.'
