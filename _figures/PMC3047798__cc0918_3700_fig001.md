caption: 'Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of the core Wnt pathway components APC, Axin
  and β-catenin. Binding of Wnt to its receptors Frizzled and Lrp5/6 induces recruitment
  of cytoplasmic proteins including Dvl and Axin. The resulting signaling complex
  inhibits the constitutive degradation of β-catenin, leading to its translocation
  to the nucleus (N) and activation of Tcf/Lef target genes. In the absence of Wnt,
  cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated by the Axin-APC-GSK3β-CK1 complex. Phospho-β-catenin
  is subjected to SCFβ-TrCP E3 ligase-mediated polyubiquitylation and proteasomal
  degradation. Both Axin and APC can undergo ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and regulate
  each other''s stability. Axin ubiquitylation and degradation is promoted by phosphorylation
  and poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation). The CSN, which binds and stimulates SCFβ-TrCP
  activity, includes DUB enzyme Usp15 that protects APC from degradative ubiquitylation.
  An alternative Wnt-responsive degradation pathway for cytosolic β-catenin is mediated
  by Jade-1, a ubiquitin ligase that is found primarily in the nucleus and that depends
  on the tumor suppressor pVHL. Independent of Wnt signaling, cytosolic β-catenin
  levels are regulated by p53-activated Siah-1 in response to DNA damage. The pool
  of β-catenin that is associated to adherence junctions (AJ) can also be targeted
  for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, the involved E3 ligases are Hakai and Ozz-E3.
  DUB enzyme Trabid is a positive regulator of downstream Wnt-induced transcription
  and removes K63-linked polyubiquitylation of APC. Filled arrowheads point out enzyme-substrate
  connection; open arrowheads: positive regulation. Dashed lines indicate protein
  movement.'
