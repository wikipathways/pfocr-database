caption: SPC25 can be used as a scaffolding platform to coordinate the assembly of
  the SPC25/RIOK1/MYH9 trimer complex, triggering RIOK1-mediated phosphorylation of
  MYH9 Ser1943. This prompts MYH9 to break away from the cytoskeleton and increase
  its nuclear accumulation, thereby enhancing CTNNB1 transcription and subsequent
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, SPC25 is also involved
  in abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which helps to improve cell survival
  and resist apoptosis. Through these pathways, SPC25 inhibits apoptosis of cancer
  cells and enhances survival signals of cancer cells, regulates key nodes in the
  cell cycle, and makes tumor cells resistant to therapy
