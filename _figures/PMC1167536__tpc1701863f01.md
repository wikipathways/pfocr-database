caption: 'Major Reactions of Peroxisomes and Routes of Transport to Cytosol and Mitochondria.Peroxisomes
  contain the enzymes that catalyze the β-oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA and
  three major enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle: CSY, isocitrate lyase (ICL), and malate
  synthase (MS). Although peroxisomes do contain MDH, it is believed that cytosolic
  MDH participates in the glyoxylate cycle. ACO is also located in the cytosol. In
  yeast, the major route for transport of the products of β-oxidation out of the peroxisome
  and into mitochondria is via a carnitine shuttle. Characterization of A BOUT DE
  SOUFFLE (BOU), an acylcarnitine carrier-like enzyme located in the Arabidopsis mitochondrial
  membrane, suggests that this pathway also operates in higher plants (). Pracharoenwattana
  et al. now show that TAG mobilization and transport of the products of fatty acid
  β-oxidation out of the peroxisome require CSY activity, suggesting that citrate
  export is the major exit route. Glyoxylate cycle reactions are marked with red arrows.'
