caption: Autocrine/paracrine effects of FGF23 in FGF23-producing tumor cells.Membrane-bound
  Klotho enables the autocrine and paracrine effects of FGF23. FGF23 that is secreted
  from tumor cells binds to a receptor complex of Klotho and FGFR1c and activates
  the FGFR signaling pathway to enhance the production of FGF23 in tumor cells. The
  positive feedback loop in the production of FGF23 and a bone-like microenvironment
  in PMTMCTs may exacerbate the disease manifestations in patients with TIO. MAPK,
  Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase.
