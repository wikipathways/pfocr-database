caption: Model of regulation of the length of D-loop extension by PCNA and choice
  of polymerase. HR can act on diverse substrates (e.g., DSBs formed by DNA-damaging
  agents or ssDNA gaps left behind replication fork). Irrespective of the inputs,
  HR proceeds by formation of D-loop, representing a common structure formed by an
  invading strand of the broken DNA into homologous template sequence, in order to
  copy the missing information. We propose that presence of PCNA on the D-loop might
  target the appropriate polymerase and determine the outcome of HR by regulating
  the extension length. When loaded, PCNA promotes a long extension track by Pol δ.
  In the absence of PCNA, on the other hand, Pol η may extend the D-loop generating
  shorter extension tracks, which could correlate with use in the gap repair and template
  switch events. The length of the extension might also be important for synthesis-dependent
  strand-annealing (SDSA) or double-strand break repair (DSBR), which are characterized,
  respectively, by displacement of the extended D-loop or stabilization of D-loop
  by second capture. PCNA loading may thus represent a regulatory point for appropriate
  choice of pathway. Alternatively, break-induced replication can take place when
  a second end of DSB is absent.
