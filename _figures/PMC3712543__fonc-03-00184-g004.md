caption: Somatic variations in genes encoding proteins of the KEGG “Melanoma” signaling
  pathway. The color of each gene’s node indicates the number of melanomas in which
  at least one non-synonymous somatic variation has been identified; white indicates
  no melanomas with reported somatic variation in the gene, while the degree of red
  saturation indicates the number of melanomas containing somatic variations in that
  gene (refer to color key in lower left). Square nodes indicate RNA expression in
  melanoma metastases significantly associated [p ≤ 0.05 no multiple testing correction
  applied, Cox proportion hazards model, Bogunovic et al. () data], with patient disease-free
  survival, while circular nodes indicate the absence of any significant association
  between RNA abundance and patient survival. This graph was generated using the pathwayGraph
  function to access the KEGG pathway information contained within the R graphite
  package.
