caption: The model for PRMT5 roles in regulation of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
  ORF59 binds to the N-terminal domain of PRMT5, competitively destroying the binding
  of PRMT5 and COPR5, leading to the decrease of H4R3 SDMA levels and the increase
  of viral gene transcription; PRMT5 blocks polymerase by binding to the reverse transcriptase
  ribonuclease H region of the polymerase, interfering with the capsizing of genomic
  RNA; HBV core protein (HBc) interacts with PRMT5 and MEP50 through its C-terminal
  arginine-rich domain, and arginine methylation could regulate the nuclear to cytoplasmic
  shuttle of HBC protein. Down-regulation of PRMT5 and MEP50 decreased the level of
  HBC protein in nucleus. When MTDH is overexpressed in HCC cells, PRMT5 transfers
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and then β-catenin transfers from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus, and the WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway is upregulated. MTDH-PRMT5
  complex could promote the metastasis of HCC by regulating WNT-β-catenin signaling
  pathway. PRMT5 leads to the down regulation of tumor suppressor BTG2 expression
  through ERK pathway, and consequently accelerated HCC proliferation. PRMT5 antagonizes
  the expression of HNF4α and resulted in poor prognosis.
