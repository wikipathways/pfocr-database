caption: The cellular PA-interaction networks. The cellular interaction networks of
  PA-specific binding partners are shown. Represented in this analysis is a subset
  of the 166 cellular proteins which bound to PA in an RNA-independent manner and
  which were identified in all three protein preparations studied (). The analysis
  shown here reveals a novel interaction of PA with members of the Ran signaling pathway,
  the caveolar endocytosis-mediated pathway, and the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway.
  Orange symbols represent molecules that are involved in molecular transport. Highlighted
  in green are mitochondrial proteins, and highlighted in yellow are molecules chosen
  for further analysis (IPO7 and PRKDC) or discussed further in the text (EGFR). Nodes
  depict proteins in the network, and solid lines represent direct whereas dotted
  lines represent indirect relationships between the proteins. An arrow pointing from
  one node to the next signifies an activation event, such as phosphorylation or methylation.
  For simplicity, self-binding or autoregulation events were not included in this
  figure.
