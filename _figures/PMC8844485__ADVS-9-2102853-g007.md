caption: 'NF‐κB signaling and its regulation by PARP1 and ADP‐ribosylation. In the
  classical (or canonical) pathway (depicted here),[] binding of extracellular signals
  to the membrane receptors leads to activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (consisting
  two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and one inhibitory subunit IKK‐γ, aka NF‐kappa‐B
  essential modulator (NEMO)), which subsequently phosphorylates IκBα and facilitates
  dissociation of IκBα from RelA(p65)/p50 complex. RelA/p50 heterodimer is then imported
  into the nucleus, binds to the responsive elements located at NF‐kB target gene
  promoters, and activates target gene transcription. Crm1‐mediated RelA (a.k.a. p65)
  nuclear export facilitates the cytoplasmic retention of RelA, thus downregulating
  NF‐kB target gene expression. PARP1 has been reported to regulate NF‐kB through
  multiple mechanisms in a context‐dependent manner (Boxes A–D). Box A: In LPS or
  TNFα‐stimulated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and HeLa cells, PARP1
  augments NF‐kB‐mediated gene expression by directly interacting with RelA/p50 and
  histone acetyltransferase P300, a process independent of PARP1''s catalytic activity
  or DNA binding function,[] Box B: In LPS‐stimulated smooth muscle cells (SMCs),

  signaling by PARP1. Box C: In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulated by DNA‐damaging

  IKKγ, respectively, two essential events for IKK kinase activation and, subsequently,
  the cascade of NF‐kB activation.[] Box D: In MEFs stimulated by DNA alkylating agents

  space where it may bind to Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and further augment the downstream
  NF‐κB signaling. Interestingly, in immortalized HeLa and U2OS cells stimulated by
  IL‐1β and TNFα, the mono‐ADP‐ribosylation enzyme PARP10 MARylates IKKγ and the MARylation
  event prevents the activation of IKK complex, thus downregulating NF‐kB cascade
  activation. Hence PARP10 antagonizes NF‐kB.[]'
