caption: Schematic diagram of cannabinoid biosynthesis including polyketide and isoprenoid
  precursor pathways. Precursor pathways are merged by a plastid‐localized aromatic
  prenyltransferase, with alkylresorcinolic acids and geranyl diphosphate intermediates
  forming cannabigeroids with a linear isoprenyl residue (Gülck & Møller, ). Cannabinoid
  synthesis concludes in the apoplastic storage cavity of glandular trichomes. Here,
  cannabigeroids are converted to tri‐ and di‐cyclic cannabinoids such as ∆9‐tetrahydrocannabinolic
  acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) via stereoselective oxidative cyclisation
  of the isoprenyl moiety. This occurs enzymatically by the cannabinoid synthases
  THCAS, CBDAS and CBCAS. The green arrow indicates location of the extracellular
  storage cavity of a Cannabis stalked glandular trichome; bar, 100 µm. Subcellular
  locations of cannabinoid and precursor pathway enzymes were predicted with the subcellular
  location software TargetP‐2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/). AAE, acyl‐activating
