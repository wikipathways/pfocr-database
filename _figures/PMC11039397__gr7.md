caption: Mechanism diagram of SR1 alleviating bone lossIn the natural environment,
  air pollutants contain different AhR ligands. When these ligands enter the cell,
  they bind specifically to the stable inactive AhR complex in the cytoplasm. AhR
  is released from the stable complex structure, and the activated AhR is transferred
  to the nucleus to promote the expression of the downstream osteoclast differentiation-associated
  gene NFATc1. At the same time, c-src is also released from the stable complex structure,
  and c-src is phosphorylated to form p-c-src, which promotes the expression of NFATc1
  by activating the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. This promotes the formation of osteoclasts,
  which ultimately leads to bone loss. Low concentrations of SR1 can prevent the dissociation
  of c-src in the AhR complex, resulting in a decrease in free c-src and p-c-src.
  The decrease in p-c-src expression can inhibit the activation of the NF-κB and MAPKs
  pathways, while high concentrations of SR1 can directly inhibit the transcription
  of NFATc1 by suppressing the expression of AhR, and ultimately alleviate bone loss
