caption: 1) Periodontal pathogens induce a host-pro-inflammatory response which can
  affect the RANK-RANKL-OPG axis in bone metabolism. RANKL/OPG balance is an important
  factor for regulating bone resorption in the periodontal environment. Osteoclast
  differentiation and activation are driven by the interaction of RANK (receptor activator
  of nuclear factor-кB) with its ligand, RANKL. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor
  for RANKL that inhibits RANK-RANKL engagement, as previously reviewed by Graves
  et al. (2011) []. 2) AT1R and AT2R are present in periodontal tissue, including
  periodontal fibroblasts. Ang I is generated from angiotensinogen (AGT) by renin.
  Ang II generated from Ang I (by ACE) acts via the AT1R to induce the activation
  of the ERK pathway which in turn can upregulate the expression of RANKL in osteoblasts
  leading to a variety of cellular outcomes [,] and possibly enhancing bone resorption.
  3) Ang II formation decreased when human gingiva homogenates were incubated with
  both captopril (ACE inhibitor) and chymostatin. After 14 days of experimentally-induced
  periodontitis, renin inhibition by treatment with aliskiren or an AT1R antagonist
  (e.g. losartan) significantly attenuated bone resorption (4), probably decreasing
  activation of AT1R downstream pathway.
