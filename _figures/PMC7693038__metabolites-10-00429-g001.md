caption: 'Biochemical mechanisms of Nitric Oxide synthesis and inhibition of mitochondrial
  targets. (a) Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from l-arginine by nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS) enzymes. The reaction involves the incorporation of oxygen (O2) into the unstable
  intermediate N omega-hydroxy-l-arginine and, subsequently, into l-citrulline, co-product
  of the generation of NO. N G -monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), N omega-Nitro-l-arginine
  (L-NAME), s-ethylisothiourea (SEITU), n-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W),
  and aminoguanidine (AG) are competitive inhibitor of NOS, the last two specific
  for inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS2), and block the pathway at the points indicated.
  (b) Nanomolar concentrations of NO immediately, specifically, and reversibly inhibit
  cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV of mitochondrial electron transport chain, ETC)
  in competition with oxygen. NO reacts with the metals of the binuclear site of cytochrome
  c oxidase, binding tightly to the reduced iron in the distal pocket with the N closest
  to the Fe and the O close to, but not directly bonding, the CuB. (c) NO can target
  aconitase: NO is capable of oxidizing the cubane iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster that
  participates in the catalysis of the non-redox reaction of reversible isomerization
  of citrate to isocitrate with the intermediate cis-aconitate. This leads to iron
  release and consequent loss of the catalytic activity.'
