caption: Proposed model of Dexras1 in modulating photic responsiveness of the circadian
  clock. Photic effects are mediated in part by NMDA and PAC1 receptors expressed
  in the SCN. In the early night, light-induced activation of NMDA receptors leads
  to a nitrosylation-dependent enhancement of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity
  of Dexras1. 1, As a result, Dexras1 activates the MAPK pathway and promotes photic
  resetting in the early night. Light exposure in the late night leads to activation
  of Gs-coupled PAC1 receptors, which signal via both the Gsα and Gβγ limbs to the
  MAPK cascade. Dexras1 inhibits PAC1-mediated MAPK pathway activation by suppressing
  Gβγ signaling events (2) as well as AC (3). Dexras1 may inhibit AC indirectly by
  a receptor-independent enhancement of tonic Gi/oα activity. Although we do not know
  the upstream signaling mechanisms that govern photic resetting in the midday in
  dexras1−/− mice, our data implicate the downstream activation of p42/p44 MAPK and
  CREB in the observed daytime photic responses. In summary, light induces smaller
  phase delays in the early night and larger phase advances in the late night in dexras1−/−
  mice. In the midday, a photic gate is lost in these animals, revealing an unusual
  phase advance response.
