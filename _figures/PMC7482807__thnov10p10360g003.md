caption: Regulatory function of lncRNAs in BC resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapy.
  Under trastuzumab exposure, TINCR is upregulated by H3K27 acetylation and induces
  trastuzumab resistance through sponging miR-125b and releasing HER2 in BC cells.
  Moreover, AFAP1-AS1 can be upregulated through H3K27 acetylation at its promoter
  region and guides AUF1 to bind to HER2 mRNA, leading to enhanced translation of
  HER2. AGAP2-AS1 increases H3K27 acetylation at the promoter region of MyD88, resulting
  in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and therapeutic resistance to trastuzumab.
  Moreover, another lncRNA, known as SNHG14, could inhibit trastuzumab-induced apoptosis
  through upregulating Bcl2. Intriguingly, several lncRNAs have been reported to confer
  trastuzumab resistance in surrounding cells through being engulfed in exosomes and
  incorporated by neighbor cells.
