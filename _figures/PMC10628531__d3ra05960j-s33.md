caption: Raja et al. utilized glucose as a methine source for the synthesis of benzimidazoles
  from o-phenylenediamines via an oxidative cyclization reaction. A wide range of
  N-substituted benzimidazoles was provided in good yields using TsOH as a catalyst.
  A plausible reaction pathway was also suggested ().
