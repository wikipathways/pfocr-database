caption: Schematic representation of tPA's role in acute cocaine-induced neuronal
  signaling. Signaling events modulated by tPA in the amygdala are indicated by black
  arrows, and those that occur in the NAc are indicated by red arrows. Components
  of the signaling pathway hypothesized to be altered in tPA−/− mice are shaded in
  gray. In the amygdala, acute cocaine exposure increases extracellular tPA activity
  in a CRF-dependent manner. tPA released into the extracellular space is hypothesized
  to modulate DA D1 receptor-mediated signaling to activate IEGs. In the NAc, tPA
  may modulate signaling through both D1 and NMDAR to modulate IEG expression. In
  the absence of tPA, cocaine-induced IEG expression is attenuated, thereby suggesting
  that tPA is an important component of the signaling cascade modulating cocaine-induced
  neuroadaptation.
