caption: 'The independent TAG synthesis pathway from fatty acids through PDAT enzyme.
  The first square show the results of comparison 1 (C1: S1 vs. S2) and second and
  third squares show comparison 2 (C2: S1 vs. S3) and comparison 3 (C3: S2 vs. S3)
  respectively. For differential compounds, boxes in green represent up-regulated
  genes in each comparison and boxes in white represent no significant change'
