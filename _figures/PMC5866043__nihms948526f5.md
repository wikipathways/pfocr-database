caption: 'Phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This overview
  illustrates the major routes to PC biosynthesis, with an emphasis on steps involving
  choline-containing compounds and those that have been previously associated with
  the pathology of AD. Phosphatidate (phosphatidic acid [PA]) is synthesized endogenously
  from glycerol-3-phosphate in most tissues, and is a key signaling molecule and a
  precursor for other 1,2-diacylglycerophospholipids. PA is converted to 1,2-diacylglycerol
  (DAG), which is then fed into the CDP-choline Kennedy pathway to form PC (PC can
  also be formed in the liver from phosphatidylethanolamine [PE] in a multi-step pathway
  catalyzed by PE-methyl transferase). PC is subject to the action of a variety of
  phospholipases, 2 main families of which are the phospholipase D (PLD) and phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2): PLD enzymes hydrolyze PC to yield free choline (Ch) and PA, whereas PLA2
  enzymes cleave acyl groups from the sn-2 position of PC to yield lysoPC.'
