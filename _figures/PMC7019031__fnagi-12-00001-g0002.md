caption: Simplified pathway diagram showing selected proposed targets of dimethyl
  fumarate (DMF) and potential associated mechanisms at the molecular level. Solid
  arrows from DMF indicate literature evidence for direct binding to the target; dashed
  arrows indicate purported targets for which evidence of direct binding has not yet
  been provided (see text for detailed discussions). Thick dashed gray arrows indicate
  nuclear translocation events. Apart from Keap1, oligomeric states of proteins are
  depicted as monomeric for simplicity. Transcriptional co-regulators of Nrf2, NFκB,
  and CREB are omitted for clarity. Note that the mechanism of inhibition of NFκB
  signaling by activated HCA2 (gray arrow) remains poorly understood but is likely
  indirect (Offermanns and Schwaninger, ).
