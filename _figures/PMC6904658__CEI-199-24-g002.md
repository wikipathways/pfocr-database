caption: Probable immunoregulatory mechanisms mediated by gut microbiota as a consequence
  of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  Microbiota‐derived enzymatic activities generate metabolites such as short chain
  fatty acids (SCFA) and kynurenines. SCFA is involved in stimulating colonic regulatory
  T cells (Tregs) and differentiation of naive CD4 T cells through inhibition of histone/protein
  deacetylases (HDACs) via specific G‐protein‐coupled receptors signalling. This results
  in increased histone acetylation in the forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) gene together
  with an increased FoxP3 expression. Kynurenines (tryptophan metabolites) activate
  the AhR pathway to polarize naive T cells into FoxP3+ Tregs. Bacteroides fragilis‐derived
  polysaccharide A (PSA), induces differentiation of naive CD4 T cells towards interleukin
  (IL)‐10‐producing Tregs or into type 1 (Tr1) regulatory T cells Tregs (FoxP3−) via
  plasmacytoid dendritic cell stimulation. Additionally, an increase in gut‐homing
  of IL‐10‐producing Treg cells and differentiation of Tregs is induced by retinoic
  acid generated by dendritic cells in the presence of microbial antigens.
