caption: 'Deduced sterol biosynthesis pathways in Symbiodiniaceae. Enzyme abbreviations:
  DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; HMGR, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  (hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase; CAS, cycloartenol synthase; LAS,
  lanosterol synthase. Metabolite abbreviations: MEP, methylerythritol phosphate;
  IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; MVA, mevalonic acid. Note the following. (i) In
  animals and fungi, the cytoplasmic MVA pathway (indicated in orange) is the only
  route for biosynthesis of IPP whereas IPP can be derived via either the MVA pathway
  or the plastidial MEP pathway (indicated in green) in higher plants. Most microalgae
  (including Symbiodiniaceae) have only the MEP pathway (). (ii) Animals and fungi
  cyclize oxidosqualene to lanosterol by LAS as the first cyclic intermediate in sterol
  biosynthesis, whereas photosynthetic organisms (e.g., plants and microalgae) convert
  the same substrate to cycloartenol by CAS (). (iii) LAS is found in Arabidopsis
  but has only a minor role (). Members of the Symbiodiniaceae (e.g., B. minutum)
  have LAS, but not CAS. Abbreviations for inhibitors: 25 AZA, 25-azalanosterol; ITA,
  itraconazole; TDM, tridemorph; AY9944, a human 7-dehydrocholesterol inhibitor.'
