caption: Physiological mechanism of insulin. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase
  receptor which is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein, consisting of 2 extracellular
  α and 2 transmembrane β subunits linked together by disulfide bonds. The α subunits
  carry insulin binding sites, while β subunits have tyrosine kinase activity, involved
  in intracellular signaling. When insulin binds the α subunits of its receptor, the
  PIK3K-signaling pathway is activated. It stimulates glucose transport across cell
  membrane by translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, increasing
  rate of glucose influx, promoting glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis.
