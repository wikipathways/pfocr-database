caption: 'Wnt signaling plays central role in embryogenesis and human diseases including
  cancers. Wnt ligands to 7-transmembrane domain receptor Frizzled, which transactivates
  EGFR signaling by MMP-mediated release of soluble EGFR ligands. Activated EGFR transactivates
  β-catenin via receptor tyrosine kinase-PI3K/Akt pathway, and β-catenin also forms
  heterodimer with EGFR and further activate EGF pathway. Direct activation of EGFR
  utilizing EGF-family ligands induces CHI3L1 expression, which binds to a putative
  receptor on cell membrane and leads to PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Akt followed
  by β-catenin transactivation. As shown in this figure, Wnt and EGFR pathways have
  been reported to closely interact in tumorigenesis by crosstalking and coactivating
  tumor progression. The activation of ASK1, following of TNF/TNFR1 and/or IL-1/IL-1R
  ligation, activates SAPK/JNK and MAPKp38 followed by increased production of MMPs
  and cytokines. NF-κB signal is also activated by TNF and IL-1, which is highly involved
  in the development of chronic colitis as well as colitis-associated cancer formation.
