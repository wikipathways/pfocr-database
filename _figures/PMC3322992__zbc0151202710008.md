caption: Schematic representation of pathways required for the role of CDCP1 in EGF/EGFR-induced
  cell morphological changes and increased cell migration. CDCP1 mediates, at least
  in part, EGF/EGFR-induced cell morphological changes and increased migration. EGF
  signals via EGFR (as indicated through use of the EGFR antagonist AG1478) to induce
  signaling via ERK that leads to up-regulation of CDCP1 mRNA and protein. Targeting
  of CDCP1 either via silencing of its mRNA or through use of an anti-CDCP1 function
  blocking antibody is effective at reducing these EGF-induced effects. Approaches
  that disrupt CDCP1 function may be useful to inhibit progression of malignancies
  driven by EGFR signaling, such as ovarian cancer, and those resistant to anti-EGFR
  drugs because of activating mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.
