caption: 'Ste5, a classical signalling scaffold. (a) Our current view on the scaffolding
  interactions of the yeast Ste5 protein. Ste4 and Ste18 are the β and γ subunits
  of the heterotrimeric G-protein with a role in recruiting components of the pathway
  to the plasma membrane upon pheromone receptor activation. Ste20, Ste11, Ste7 and
  Fus3 are protein kinases, phosphorylating each other in successive steps (illustrated
  with green arrows). The Fus3 MAP kinase, as the output of the scaffolded module,
  phosphorylates substrate targets (such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  Far1). Other proteins, such as Ste50 and Bem1, have additional regulatory roles
  in this cascade. (b) The Ste5 signalling scaffold in its PPI network context. Proteins
  possessing intrinsic enzymatic activity are coloured orange, passive components
  are gray and the edges of the full 3-graphs that represent scaffolded signalling
  complexes are drawn with a thick line. These interactions were taken directly from
  the STRING database (http://string.embl.de), with the following settings: confidence
  level = 0.90, type: experimental only, maximum interactors = 100. (Some interacting
  partners are not presented for simplicity.).'
