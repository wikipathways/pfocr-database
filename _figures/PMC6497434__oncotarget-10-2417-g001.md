caption: Molecular mechanisms of modifiable risk factor mediated induction of cytokines
  involving subsequent activation of CREB, resulting in pancreatic cancer growth and
  progression. NNK induces GM-CSF release from pancreas cells, which can then activate
  CREB through AKT/PI3K pathway. Molecular pathway of heavy alcohol-induced CXCL12
  release can activate CREB, through CXCR4 pathway (unpublished data). Obesity can
  activate CREB and lead to STAT3 activation through enhanced IL-6 release. These
  risk factors alone, or in combination with other factors, can mediate pathogenesis
  of pancreatic cancer through CREB signaling.
