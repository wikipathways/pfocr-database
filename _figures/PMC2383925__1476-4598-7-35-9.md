caption: A miRNA model for the molecular pathogenesis of recurrent ovarian cancer.
  Based on integrated transcriptome and miRNA analysis, we identified a "recurrent
  metastatic signature" comprised top dysregulated miRNAs, miR-9 (down) and miR-223
  (up) that correlate with our previous transcriptome findings. miR-9 appears to be
  a tumour suppressor gene and when downregulated, it can lead to drug resistance.
  miR-223 can act either as oncogene or tumour suppressor gene. Genes highlighted
  in red were previously identified in our transcriptome study. Genes in blue have
  been well characterised in ovarian cancer. FGF signalling pathway appears to be
  commonly shared between our identified miRNAs.
