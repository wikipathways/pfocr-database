caption: Experimental design for omics approach. DU145 cells transduced with shE6AP
  and shControl were treated with 0.2 μg/ml dox for 2.5 days. Changes in mRNA and
  protein expression between triplicate samples of DU145 shE6AP + dox and shControl
  + dox cells were assessed by Hi Seq 2500 and SILAC-based LC-MS/MS analysis. Significantly
  altered transcripts and proteins were subjected to pathway analysis. Top regulated
  candidates altered at both transcript and protein levels were validated using qRT-PCR.
