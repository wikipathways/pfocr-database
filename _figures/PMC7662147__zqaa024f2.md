caption: 'The life cycle and cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and ENaC in airway cells. (A).
  In AT2 and ciliated cells, spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virion bind to ACE2.
  After subsequent cleavage of the spike protein by TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 enters the
  cells through an endosomal pathway. Following the entry of the virus into the host
  cell, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. A viral replicase assists with
  RNA transcription. After translation, polyproteins are cleaved by a viral protease.
  Following the production of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, nucleocapsids are assembled
  and packaged together with structural proteins to assemble a virus particle in the
  Golgi that is then released by exocytosis. Furin in the Golgi compartment may participate
  in proteolytic processing of the spike protein. Main therapeutic strategies aimed
  at preventing virus entry into host cells: Site 1: neutralizing antibodies, Site
  2: inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity (nafamostat and camostat), Site 3: peptide-blocking
  spike protein interaction with ACE2. (B) ENaC activation in airway cells. ENaC is
  first cleaved in the Golgi by furin, which allows its transport to the apical membrane
  (inactive) where it undergoes a second cleavage (activation) by a second serine
  protease (channel activating protease [CAP1]) to produce an active ENaC channel.
  (C) In AT2 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, three synergistic mechanisms contribute
  to complete inactivation of ENaC: (1) endothelialitis of the alveolar capillaries
  produces a massive secretion of cytokines (“cytokine storm”) that inhibits ENaC
  activity at the apical membrane; (2) the multiplication of viral particles and subsequent
  increased concentration of viral spike proteins will compete for the cleavage of
  ENaC (competitive antagonism); ENaC will no longer be cleaved and can no longer
  be exported to the membrane; (3) the virus blocks endogenous gene transcription.
