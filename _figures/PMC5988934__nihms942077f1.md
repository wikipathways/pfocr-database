caption: Activation of antiviral innate immunity in CHB. Activators can be separated
  into modulators that systemically stimulate innate immunity (e.g., IFNs and other
  recombinant cytokines) and modulators that act specifically and locally (e.g., agonists
  of cytoplasmic PRRs, IFN signaling pathway molecules, and endosomal TLRs). Available
  IFN-α preparations include Intron A (IFN-α 2b; Merck) and Pegasys (pegylated IFN-α
  2a; Genentech). SB 9200 (Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals) is an agonist of RIG-I. GS-9620
  (Gilead Sciences), RG7854 or RO7020531 (Hoffmann-La Roche), and AL-034 (Janssen)
  are agonists of TLR7. GS-9688 (Gilead Sciences) is an agonist of TLR8. CpG 21798
  (Pfizer) and AIC649 (AiCuris) are agonists of TLR9. Upon stimulation of PRRs or
  TLRs by their respective ligands, downstream signaling pathways are activated, including
  key molecules such as STING or MyD88, leading to the nuclear translocation of the
  transcription factors NF-κB, IRF3 and IRF7, and subsequent transcription of IFNs,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ISGs. Note that the figure only indicates the main
  cell subsets and cellular compartments that are targeted by IFN-α and agonists but
  does not depict any systemically induced innate immunity by these modulators as
  it is known for IFN-α due to the pleiotropic nature of this cytokine.IFNAR, interferon-α/β
  receptor; STING; stimulator of interferon genes; IKK, Kinase involved in the upstream
  NF-κB signal transduction cascade; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B-cells; IRF; interferon regulatory factor; IRSE, interferon-responsive
  sequence element; and MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88.
