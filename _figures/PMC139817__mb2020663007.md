caption: Regulatory interactions between SRF and TCF. (A) Interactions between Gal-Elk
  fusion proteins and SRF. Left panel, interaction between SRF and the B box of Gal-ElkΔ33
  blocking access of the RhoA-actin signal pathway to SRF. Only a single unit of the
  Gal4 dimer is shown; it remains unclear whether both the Elk-1 B boxes present in
  the dimeric fusion protein contact SRF. Right panel, effect of the B-box mutations
  upon interaction with SRF. Mutation of the B box in the fusion indicated by the
  asterisk impairs transcriptional activation and allows a cofactor X, which mediates
  RhoA-actin signaling, to interact with SRF. The depicted interaction of X, which
  may or may not be dimeric, with SRF is figurative. (B) Proposed interactions Elk-1
  proteins and SRF. Diagrams are as described for panel A. Recruitment of Elk-1 to
  DNA is dependent on interaction with SRF, which relieves an autoinhibitory interaction
  masking the Elk-1 activation domain. Interaction with SRF also inhibits access of
  the putative RhoA-actin signaling cofactor X as described for panel A. At promoters
  lacking a TCF binding site, TCF is not recruited and activation of SRF occurs via
  recruitment of putative cofactor X.
