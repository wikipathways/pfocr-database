caption: Metabolic changes in immune cells based on inflammation status. Glucose is
  the principle substrate used by effector cells such as neutrophils and M1 macrophages
  for the generation of energy. These are also the cells which are the first-responders
  to initiate an inflammatory response and thus pro-inflammatory in nature. Fatty
  acid oxidation is the predominant energy generation pathway used by the naïve and
  tolerant cells such as M2 macrophages and T memory/regulatory cells. These cells
  are generally involved in resolving the inflammation and thus are anti-inflammatory
  in nature
