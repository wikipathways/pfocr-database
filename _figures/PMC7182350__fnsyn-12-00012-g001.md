caption: Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation through synaptic
  receptors that are known to be involved in memory formation such as NMDA, Trk, and
  Eph receptors. Activation of these synaptic receptors leads to the regulation of
  RacGEFs or RacGAPs that activate or inhibit Rac GTPase, respectively. Rac GTPase
  regulates downstream effectors that can affect spine morphology and synaptic transmission.
  Rac GTPase exerts its effects on spine morphology through the regulation of molecules
  that affect signaling pathways that control actin-regulatory proteins. In its active
  state, Rac GTPase activates the PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway that can control actin
  dynamics through the inhibition of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein. Rac
  GTPase also regulates actin network through the modulation of the WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway
  that, in turn, regulates actin nucleation and actin branching. Both cofilin and
  Arp2/3 regulation of the actin cytoskeleton affect spine morphology. In addition,
  Rac GTPase may regulate synaptic efficacy by controlling AMPA receptor content in
  the synapse. Rac1 GTPase protein level in the spine and its effects on spine functions
  can be regulated by calcium-induced translocation of Rac1 GTPase into the spine
  by copine-6. The correlation between Rac GTPase activity and changes in spine morphology,
  synaptic transmission and memory indicates that Rac GTPase regulates spine functions
  that can mediate various stages of memory formation, erasure, extinction and forgetting.
