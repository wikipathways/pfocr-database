caption: A schematic model for the molecular mechanism of chlorosis. Inducible silencing
  of the HSP90C gene causes a reduction of HSP90C levels in the chloroplast, which
  causes the loss of protein homeostasis in the chloroplast. The disruption of protein
  homeostasis leads chloroplasts to produce ROS in a light-dependent manner. The effects
  of ROS and SA are enhanced by a self-amplifying loop. ROS serves as the chloroplast
  retrograde signal and activates other retrograde signaling pathways, leading to
  the upregulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and the downregulation of chloroplast-
  and photosynthesis-related genes (CPRGs). Reduced supply of HSP90C in the chloroplast
  induces the activation of the ER stress response and the upregulation of JA/ET/ABA
  pathway genes, likely through SA, ROS, or other signaling pathways. ROS, SA, the
  activation of PR genes, and other stress responses including JA/ET/ABA pathways
  could stimulate the cell death pathway. The downregulation of CPRGs may be the primary
  cause of chlorosis, and ROS-mediated triggering of HR-like cell death in the chlorotic
  tissues could have a role in the development of chlorosis. Solid line arrows indicate
  the steps with experimental support, whereas broken line arrows are hypothetical.
