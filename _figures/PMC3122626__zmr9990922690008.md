caption: Comparison of cAMP-PKA and MAPK signaling cascades in C. albicans, C. neoformans,
  and A. fumigatus. The cAMP-PKA signaling cascade and MAPK cascade represent two
  key morphogenetic signaling pathways conserved in these species. The MAPK signaling
  cascades modulating morphogenesis in A. fumigatus (the HOG-MAPK pathway and cell
  wall integrity MAPK pathway) are distinct from the MAPK module depicted in this
  figure. (Top) The cAMP-PKA pathway. (Bottom) The MAPK cascade. Corresponding colors
  between pathways indicate orthologous proteins between the species. Gray arrows
  indicate that links between certain factors in this pathway have not yet been established.
