caption: 'This figure shows that TMAO mediates tissue damage and chronic inflammation
  through a dual mechanism: on the one hand, TMAO upregulates the expression of matrix
  metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and specifically degrades elastin and collagen in the
  ECM, resulting in the structural disintegration of the ECM structure of the aortic
  wall and weakening stability. On the other hand, TMAO activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, drives macrophages to release proinflammatory factors
  such as IL-1β and IL-18, and induces a large amount of mitochondrial ROS to be produced,
  triggering oxidative stress. It is worth noting that the accumulation of ROS not
  only directly exacerbates cell damage but also forms a positive feedback loop of
  “oxidative stress-inflammation” by activating inflammatory pathways such as NLRP3.
