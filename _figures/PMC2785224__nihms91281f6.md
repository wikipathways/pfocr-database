caption: The diene intermediate 3m provides a pathway to access macrocyclic dihydroxamic
  acids by RCM exemplified by our synthesis of 16. When the diene 3m was treated with
  5 mol% Grubbs’ II catalyst in refluxing dichloromethane the cyclic product 14 was
  obtained in 85% yield after purification (). The macrocycle 14 was obtained as a
  diastereomeric mixture as determined by 1H NMR. The sulfone groups were removed
  using 6% Na/Hg amalgam. Finally, hydrogenolysis of the benzyl protecting groups
  with concomitant reduction of the double bond gave the desired dihydroxamic acid
  16. Macrocyclic dihydroxamic acids, such as the siderophores bisucaberin and alcaligin,
  have been shown to bind Fe(III) strongly. Macrocyclic hydroxamic acids have also
  been shown to be inhibitors of MMPs and TACE.
