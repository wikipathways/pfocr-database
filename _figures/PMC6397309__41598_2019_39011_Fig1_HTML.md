caption: Schematic of our bioreporter. During NRF2-KEAP1 pathway activation, NRF2
  is disassociated from its repressor protein in the cytoplasm, KEAP1, followed by
  its translocation to the nucleus, binding to its ARE at the upstream of the NRF2
  gene and also that of transfected vector’s luciferase.
