caption: miRNAs are processed according to the pathway described in .siRNAs come from
  exogenous double-stranded RNA (Exo-dsRNA; viral infection) or endogenous double-stranded
  RNA (Endo-dsRNA; reverse transcription or transposons). Like miRNAs, siRNAs are
  matured by Dicer associated with TRBP and then incorporated into the RISC complex
  mainly composed of Ago2. siRNAs play a role in cell defense after a viral infection,
  in the inhibition of transposon propagation, or in the simple regulation of gene
  expression.piRNAs are different from miRNAs and siRNAs mainly because of their origin
  and their maturation; they are derived from single-stranded RNAs and are not processed
  by Dicer. They are also a few nucleotides longer than miRNAs and siRNAs, are mainly
  present in germinal cell lines, and contribute to maintaining the genome integrity
  targeting transposable elements.
