caption: Regulation of the onset of flower formation by auxin. A, Model of the onset
  of flower formation by auxin. The auxin-activated ARF5/MP transcription factor directly
  activates LFY. Likewise, ANT and AIL6/PLT3 directly induce LFY upon auxin sensing
  to promote the switch to flower formation. ANT/AIL6 and MP act in parallel pathways.
  This suggests the presence of a MP independent pathway for ANT/AIL6 induction by
  auxin. B, Model of flower primordium initiation by auxin. Subsequent to the switch
  to flower formation, which happens once in the lifecycle of monocarpic plants, both
  ANT/AIL6 and LFY promote initiation of primordia. See text for additional details.
