caption: A) Comparison of the putative biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of tjipanazole
  biosynthesis in F. ambigua (Näg.) Gomont 108b with the BGC of staurosporine in Streptomyces
  sp. TP‐A0274 and the BGC of rebeccamycin in Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes ATCC 39243.
  Oxidase‐like genes are coloured red, the methyltransferase‐like gene in yellow,
  halogenase‐like genes in violet, and the remaining in blue. Genes are drawn to scale,
  tjp3–10 are enlarged. Dashed lines show homology of the genes between the BGCs (for
  details concerning the homologous genes, see Table S1). B) Putative biosynthetic
  pathway of the tjipanazoles in F. ambigua (Näg.) Gomont 108b. All named metabolites
  were detected by HPLC‐HRMS as [M ‐ H]− ions in the extract of the strain (R=Cl or
  H). For the intermediates, the position of the functional groups has not been experimentally
  proven.
