caption: 'The COX metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid (AA). In resting cells, AA
  is stored in an esterified form within the cell membrane phospholipids. Upon stimulation
  by neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or inflammatory stimuli, AA is released in
  its unesterified form from phospholipids and metabolized by different enzymes. Both
  COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the stepwise conversion of AA into two short-lived intermediates,
  PGG2 and PGH2. PGH2 is then metabolized to a variety of PGs and related compounds
  (collectively referred to as prostanoids; PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2 and TXA2) by the
  activity of specific terminal enzymes. These PGs can modulate physiological and
  pathological cellular functions by interacting with specific presynaptic or postsynaptic
  PG receptors expressed in the brain (i.e. DP1–2. EP1–4, FPα,β and IP). NSAIDs, a
  widely used class of anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen, indomethacin and
  naproxen, can inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 activity and alleviate pain and inflammation.
  Abbreviations: AA, arachidonic acid; COX, cyclooxygenase; PGH2, prostaglandin H2;
  PGI2, prostacyclin; TXB2, thromboxane B2; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs.'
