caption: Molecular pathways of CR on neuroprotection (Created with BioRender.com).
  As the energy sensor, AMPK-mTOR pathways respond to CR by reacting to the metabolic
  status of cells. As the intracellular pathway, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-mediated
  sirtuin affects gene expression to generate neurotrophic factors such as BDNF. Downstream
  of Sirtuin 1, PGC-1α modulates mitochondrial biogenesis and function, which affects
  cellular metabolism.
