caption: Juxtacrine Notch signaling may play a role at different stages of macrophage
  involvement in CAVD development. In CAVD, monocytes infiltrate valve tissues due
  to reduced integrity of VECs and then turn into naive macrophages M0. The reduction
  in VECs integrity occurs due to mechanical stress and loss of cell–cell Notch contacts
  after Notch receptor glycosylation observed in inflammatory conditions. In addition
  to monocytes and other immune cells, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) also infiltrate
  the valve and act as osteogenic provocateurs in various ways. LDLs can activate
  TLRs in macrophages, which in turn induce the expression of Notch receptors and
  ligands, including Jagged1, Dll1, and Dll4. Activation of the Notch pathway in macrophages
  can lead to their differentiation into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and impact
  CAVD progression. Furthermore, VECs can induce macrophage M1 transition by losing
  the Notch4 receptor (while Notch1-3 remain expressed) and increasing the production
  of Dll4 by both VECs and immune cells. M1 macrophages express cytokines that promote
  inflammation and influence the osteogenic differentiation of resident valve cells.
  These cytokines can regulate the Notch signaling pathway by increasing the expression
  of NOTCH1, potentially in VICs as well. Dysregulation of Notch signaling, in turn,
  stimulates VICs to differentiate into myofibroblast-like cells or osteoblast-like
  cells. However, it is still unclear whether direct contact between macrophages and
  VICs via Notch receptors and ligands occurs in CAVD
