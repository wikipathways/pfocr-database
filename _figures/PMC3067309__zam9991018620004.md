caption: 'The reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway. One CO2 molecule is reduced
  to carbon monoxide bound to a nickel atom in the active center of CO dehydrogenase,
  and another is reduced to a methyl group bound to the carrier tetrahydropterin;
  subsequent methyl transfer to nickel-bound CO leads to acetyl-CoA synthesis. The
  upper part (red) shows the variant of the pathway functioning in acetogens, and
  the lower part (blue) depicts the pathway in methanogens. Fd, ferredoxin; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  H4TPT, tetrahydropterin (THF in acetogens and tetrahydromethanopterin or tetrahydrosarcinopterin
  in methanogens); MFR, methanofuran; F420, coenzyme F420. Enzymes: 1, formate dehydrogenase;
  2; formyl-THF synthetase; 3, formyl-MFR dehydrogenase; 4, formyl-MFR:tetrahydromethanopterin
  formyltransferase; 5, methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase; 6, methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin
  cyclohydrolase; 7, methylene-THF dehydrogenase; 8, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin
  dehydrogenase; 9, methylene-THF reductase; 10, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin
  reductase; 11, CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase.'
