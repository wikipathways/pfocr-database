caption: Nucleotide biosynthesis. The black text and arrows denote the de novo pathway
  of nucleotide synthesis, and the red text and arrows denote the salvage pathway
  of nucleotide synthesis. The black and red boxes show that the indicated metabolites
  can be derived from both the de novo and salvage pathways. The involvement of HCMV
  in these processes is denoted by blue text and arrows. dNDPs, deoxyribonucleotide
  diphosphates.
