caption: Evolution of the Ink4a tumor suppressor locus in vertebrates. (A,B) The Ink4a
  locus is a good example of a tumor suppressor locus that has evolved to differ significantly
  between lower vertebrates (A) and mammals (B). Homologs of the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor p16Ink4a (Cdkn2a) exist throughout vertebrates, while the earliest
  known ancestor of Arf (alternative reading frame) arose in chickens. In mammals,
  the Ink4a locus uses distinct first exons and common second and third exons to generate
  the two proteins, Arf and p16Ink4a, transcribed in alternative reading frames, resulting
  in no amino acid homology. P16Ink4a functions in the retinoblastoma pathway to inhibit
  the phosphorylation of pRb1, thereby promoting sequestration of E2F (shown in A).
  Arf functions primarily in the p53 pathway and inhibits Mdm2, resulting in stabilization
  of p53 and enhancement of p53 functions. Arf can be induced directly by E2F, resulting
  in the arrest of cells that have reached a threshold of proliferation signaling
  through the pRb1/E2F pathway. Broken lines indicate regulation at the level of gene
  expression. Solid lines indicate regulation by other mechanisms. Primary tumor suppressor
  genes are in bold octagons. Yellow ovals represent effector molecules in affected
  pathways. CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Mdm2, transformed mouse 3T3 cell double
