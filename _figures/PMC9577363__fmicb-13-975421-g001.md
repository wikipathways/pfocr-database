caption: Reconstruction of the anthocyanidin biosynthetic pathway under the control
  of Pb(II)-responsive genetic element. The anthocyanidin biosynthesis genes cluster
  was artificially synthesized and inserted downstream of the divergent pbr promote
  to assemble Pb(II) biosensing construct. Anthocyanidin synthase originating from
  Petunia hybrida and 3-O-glycosyltransferase originating from Arabidopsis thaliana
  are expected to be transcribed and translated as a bicistronic unit when the metabolically
  engineered bacterium is exposed to bioavailable Pb(II). The anthocyanidin cyanidin
  3-O-Glucoside is biosynthesized by catalyzing the production of cyanidin from the
  substrate catechin by ANS and transferring a glucose group to cyanidin to yield
  C3G by 3GT. Water-soluble CACD will be secreted by biosensor cells and quantitatively
  measured at 428 nm in a 96-well microplate.
