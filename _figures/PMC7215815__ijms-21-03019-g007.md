caption: 'Impact of CBF overexpression on the relative expression of genes involved
  in the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. Transcript levels are relative to control
  plants, and were analyzed by RTqPCR. This pathway represents the main biosynthetic
  route toward the monolignols coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, giving rise to G and
  S units, respectively, adapted from [] (R = shikimic or quinic acid). The analyses
  included 17 bona fide genes (*) from the core vascular lignin toolbox involved in
  developmental lignification [], and 14 additional isoforms showing induction in
  response to abiotic stresses in previous studies []. The green color in the heat
  maps illustrates induction of gene expression (ratio > 1) in transgenic CBF-OE plants,
  relative to control plants. Ratio values are provided in . Gene abbreviations are
  given according to []: PAL: phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H: cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL: 4-hydroxycinnamate CoA ligase; HCT: hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H: p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase; CCR: cinnamoyl CoA reductase; CCoAOMT: caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase;
  F5H: ferulate 5-hydroxylase; COMT: caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD: cinnamyl
  alcohol dehydrogenase.'
