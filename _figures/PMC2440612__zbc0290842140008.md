caption: Overview of the potential impact of caspase-3 degradation of Inh3 on  cell
  functions. This diagram shows the potential impact of  caspase-3 on Inh3 degradation
  within a simplified scheme of the apoptotic  pathways. Since caspase-3 is a primary
  executioner caspase, Inh3 degradation  is expected to accompany caspase-3-activated
  apoptotic signaling pathways  whether these are generated through the intrinsic
  or extrinsic pathways. Inh3  is a potent PP1 inhibitor and controls a significant
  fraction of the cellular  pool of PP1γ1 and PP1α. In addition, it also controls
  the  subcellular localization of PP1γ1 to the nucleolus. Degradation of Inh3  leads
  to release of active PP1 catalytic subunits, which are no longer  restrained to
  their normal subcellular compartments. As a consequence,  unregulated dephosphorylation
  of PP1 substrates by the active PP1 catalytic  subunits takes place, leading to
  disruption of cellular processes. The  circled plus sign is used here to indicate
  a proapoptotic effect.  Among the PP1 substrates are a subset of those that are
  involved in apoptotic  signaling pathways. Their unregulated dephosphorylation might
  also affect  apoptotic signaling. On the right side of the diagram is a  simplified
  outline of the intrinsic pathway to indicate the interactions of  the Bcl-2 and
  BH3 family of proteins, of which several, including Bcl-2 and  BAD, have been reported
  to be regulated by protein phosphatase-1 activity.  Unregulated dephosphorylation
  of these proteins could produce a proapoptotic  signaling effect. This would provide
  a potential feedback mechanism that is  shown by the dotted arrow.
