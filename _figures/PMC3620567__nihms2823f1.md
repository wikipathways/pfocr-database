caption: Ischemia-reperfusion injury in the diabetic myocardium is multi-factorial
  and complex. a) Overexpression of phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome
  10 (PTEN) in diabetes results in an inability to activate cellular protective pathways
  such as, PI3K/AKT and JAK2/STAT3 to prevent ischemia and reperfusion injury. b)
  Hexose biosynthase pathway (HBP) activation due to hyperglycemia results in glycosylation
  of proteins. Glycosylation of BAD, for example, leads to higher binding to and inactivation
  of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. This renders the cardiomyocyte more susceptible to mPTP.
  c) The multitude of effects of hyperglycemia and diabetes lead to uncoupling of
  the mitochondrial electron transport chains (ETC) and have a net effect of ROS overproduction
  and lower ATP production that renders the myocardium unable to ward off injury.
  d) Uncoupling of NOS enzymes and the resultant overproduction of peroxynitrite is
  a cyclical mode of cellular injury. This cycle is fed by overproduction of superoxide,
  which itself is formed from multiple sources during diabetes and ischemia and reperfusion.
  e) Release of divalent cations from metalloproteinases during ischemia and reperfusion
  promote production of OH• radical from H2O2 through the fenton reaction. f) Activation
  of aldose reductase during ischemia and reperfusion depletes NADPH, the cofactor
  required for glutathione reductase (GR) activity. Decreased GR activity leads to
  lower levels of anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH), which also contributes to lower
  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Lower GPx activity decreases the amount of
  H2O2 neutralized and therefore contributes to higher oxidative stress and susceptibility
  to mPTP and resultant cardiac injury and remodeling.
