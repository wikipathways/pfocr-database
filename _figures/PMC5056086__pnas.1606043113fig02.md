  pyruvate culture to explore the presence of glyoxylate shunt in SYK-6. The SD represents
  the 2% technical error of the instrument. The Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway is
  shown in purple; the TCA is shown in green; the PPP is shown in red; and the amino
  acid synthesis pathway is shown in black.'
