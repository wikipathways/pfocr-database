caption: Conserved nutrient signaling pathways in yeast, worms, flies and mammals.
  A schematic model of the conserved nutrient-signaling pathways that regulate stress
  response mechanisms, DNA damage, longevity and cancer in different model organisms
  []. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose and amino acids activate Ras/AC/PKA and
  TOR/Sch9 pathways, respectively. Their activation leads to serine-threonine kinase
  Rim15 inhibition and consequently to a lowering in Msn2/Msn4 stress resistance transcription
  factors. These mechanisms promote aging in part by decreasing cell stress response
  and repair thus increasing DNA damage []. In Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin/IGF-1
  receptor like (daf-2) signaling, through the activation of AKT/PKB pathway, inactivates
  the Forkhead FoxO transcription factor daf-16, which is involved in the regulation
  of genes implicated in the cellular stress response and protection against free
  radicals. As in yeast, also in worms, amino acids can activate the TOR/S6K pathway,
  accelerating the aging process []. Analogously to worms, in Drosophila melanogaster
  growth factors and amino acids activate AKT/PKB and TOR/S6K pathways, respectively
  []. The activation of TOR/S6K, PI3K/AKT and Ras/AC/PKA pathways, mediated by glucose,
  amino acids and IGF-1 like signaling, is also maintained in rodents and other mammals,
  suggesting that these nutrient-sensing pathways, involved in longevity and stress-response
  mechanisms, are conserved, in part, from the simplest model organism to humans [,].
