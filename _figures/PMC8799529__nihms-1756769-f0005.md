caption: p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway mediates the late cytoplasmic G2/M checkpoint through
  its actions on RBPs and 14-3-3 accessory proteins in the cytosol. ATM and ATR cause
  the activation of p38 MAPK that forms a complex with MK2 and translocates out of
  the nucleus. At this stage, CHK1 phosphorylates 14-3-3 and CDC25 proteins initiating
  arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. In the cytoplasm, MK2 phosphorylates PARN, hnRNP
  A0, TTP and 14-3-3 proteins causing the stabilization of mRNA and the subsequent
  transcription of genes such as GADD45α that maintain the checkpoint status. The
  phosphorylation of 14-3-3 also maintains the sequestration of CDC25B/C contributing
  to the arrest at G2/M phase.
