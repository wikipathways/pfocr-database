caption: 'A two-step model for the pro-apoptotic actions of KCNB1. Upon exposure to
  oxidants, KCNB1 oligomers are formed. They accumulate in the plasma membrane thereby
  perturbing the organization of lipid rafts. This results in activation of an apoptotic
  stimulus mediated by c-Src and downstream, JNK kinases. As result of activation
  of c-Src and JNK kinases and in part of NADPH-oxidase (Xilong Wu, private communication)
  which is localized in the plasma membrane, ROS levels increase in the cell. ROS
  induce a raise in cytosolic Ca2+ and Zn2+ that initiate a phosphorylation-mediated
  surge of KCNB1 channels that further drives apoptosis. The signaling pathway activated
  by Zn2+ proceeds through activation of p38 by ASK-1 and independently, of c-Src
  tyrosine kinases (Zn2+ inhibits the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP epsilon)
  which phosphorylate KCNB1 at S800 and Y124 thereby allowing interaction with SNARE
  family protein syntaxin. The Ca2+signaling pathway results in activation of CaMKII
  kinase which in turn acts to modulate the interaction of KCNB1 with syntaxin. It
  is not known whether Src and p38 phosphorylation directly act to increase KCNB1
  current. ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
