caption: 'Overview of lipid remodeling in yeast during acid adaptation, where heavy
  arrows indicate enhanced biosynthesis. Model created from the data available for
  S. cerevisiae. Abbreviations used for major metabolic intermediates are: G3P glycerol-3-phosphate,
  CDP-DAG cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol, TAGs triacylglycerols, STEs steryl
  esters, PA phosphatidic acid, PC phosphatidylcholine, CL cardiolipin, PE phosphatidylethanolamine,
  PI phosphatidylinositol, PS phosphatidylserine, ES ergosterol, FFA free fatty acids,
  LC-FAs long-chain fatty acids, MC-FAs medium-chain fatty acids. Key gene names refer
  to the following encoded enzymatic activities: SCT glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase,
  SLC LPA acyltransferase, ACC acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ARE acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase,
  DGA acyl-CoA:DAG acyltransferase, FAS fatty acid synthetase, LRO phospholipid:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase, MFE multifunctional enzyme, PAP phosphatidate phosphatase, FAA
  fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, PIS phosphatidylinositol synthase, PSS phosphatidylserine
  synthase, PSD phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, EKI ethanolamine kinase, CKI choline
  kinase, ERG1 squalene epoxidase, ERG6 squalene reductase, POT thiolase, POX acyl-CoA
  oxidase, PXA peroxisomal acyl-CoA transporter, TGL triacylglycerol lipase. The changes
  in the expression levels of several key genes (inside the dark blue box) were verified
  by qPCR. The arrows with dashed lines indicate that multiple reactions are involved
  in the corresponding synthetic pathway'
