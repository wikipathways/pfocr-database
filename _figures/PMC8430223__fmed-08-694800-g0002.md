caption: (A) POSTN induces osteogenic differentiation, migration, and proliferation
  of MSCs. (1) The receptor erythropoietin-producing hepatocyte B4 (EPHB4) interacts
  with ephrin B2, thereby inducing POSTN expression, which in turn promotes the expression
  of p-GSK-3-β (Ser9); this leads to the downregulation of GSK-3-β (Ser9) activity
  through the Wnt pathway to increase collagen type I, RUNX2, and ALP expression in
  order to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. (2) CTLA4 maintains POSTN
  expression by regulating the phosphorylation of LDL receptor related protein 6 (LRP6)
  and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway under immune activation conditions
  to promote RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), collagen I, osteocalcin,
  osterix, and ALP expression, as well as calcium nodule formation in BMSCs. (3) The
  expression of osteogenic markers in MSCs increases after treatment with soluble
  POSTN. However, when soluble POSTN is neutralized, these effects are diminished.
  (4) 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) induces osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in ovariectomized
  rats through the POSTN-Wnt/β-catenin pathway to promote osteogenic effects. (B)
