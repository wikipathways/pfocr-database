caption: Simplified scheme of putative role, function, and involvement of VEGF, PlGF,
  and IGFBP-3 in signaling pathways described in angiogenesis and tumor growth. The
  downstream signaling pathway of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), including adaptor proteins
  son of sevenless (SOS), growth receptor bound (Grb) 2, and Src homology 2 domain,
  can be activated by the ligands VEGF and PlGF. The activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway via cell division control protein 42 homologous
  (Cdc42), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6), p38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (p38/MAPK), and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MAPKAPK 2/3) triggers
  actin reorganization via heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which promotes migration
  of endothelial cells. The activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) results in a
  cytoskeletal rearrangement by modulating the adhesion protein paxillin. The cleavage
  of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) by PLCγ (phospholipases C γ) provokes the
  release of calcium (Ca2+), which contributes to vascular permeability via the release
  of prostaglandins (PG) and endothelial nitrogen monoxide synthase (NOS). PLCγ also
  leads via diacylglycerol (DAG) to the activation of the protein kinase C (PKC)-rapidly
  accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf)-rat sarcoma (Ras)/mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MEK)/extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK) pathway, which initiates DNA
  synthesis to promote endothelial cell proliferation. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays
  a crucial role in cell proliferation and cell survival. PI3K can be activated by
  VEGFR and by IGFR. There is also a direct stimulation of FAK. IGFBP-3 can bind to
  78-kDA glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). This binding can result in proapoptotic
  and prosurvival activity (based on [,,,,,,,,]).
