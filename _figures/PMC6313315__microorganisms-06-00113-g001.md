caption: The urea and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycles. Arginine is synthesized via
  the urea cycle. Carbamoyl phosphate reacts with ornithine to generate citrulline.
  Addition of aspartate to citrulline creates L-argininosuccinate. ATP is cleaved
  to AMP and pyrophosphate to drive this reaction forward. Arginine is cleaved off
  of L-argininosuccinate by the enzyme encoded by argH and can be used for protein
  synthesis. Hydrolysis of arginine generates ornithine and urea. Fumarate is the
  other product of the ArgH-catalyzed reaction and can be used in the TCA-cycle. Acetyl-CoA
  derived from pyruvate and other catabolic pathways enters the TCA-cycle. The acetyl
  group condenses with four-carbon oxaloacetate to produce citrate. Citrate rearranges
  to isocitrate, which is decarboxylated and forms NADH + H+ by transferring 2H+ +
  2e−. 2-Oxoglutarate is decarboxylated and transfers 2H+ + 2e− to form NADH + H+,
  while incorporating CoA to form succinyl-CoA. Succinate forms fumarate by transferring
  2H+ + 2e− resulting in FADH2. Water is incorporated, and oxaloacetate is formed
  when 2H+ + 2e− are transferred to form NADH + H+. The pathway marked in green highlights
  the proposed model for NADH reoxidation (Arnon-Buchanan cycle).
