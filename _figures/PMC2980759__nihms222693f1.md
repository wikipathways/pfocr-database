caption: Examples of the inter-relationship between host, tumor, and environmental
  factors (pharmaco-epi-bio-genomic triad) that determine the response to tamoxifen
  in an individual patient (phenotype). A. Variants in genes encoding for enzymes
  can influence metabolism and elimination of tamoxifen (host genetic factors). B.
  Differences in estrogen pathway may predict sensitivity or resistance to tamoxifen
  and its antiestrogenic metabolites in tumor cell and its inhibition by tamoxifen
  metabolites (tumor biology factors). C. Environmental factors that can influence
  tamoxifen response.Abbreviations:Co A = Co-activatorER = Estrogen ReceptorERE =
