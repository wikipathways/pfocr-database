caption: Schematic representation of the main cellular mechanisms of chemioresistance.
  Efficacy of anticancer drugs is driven by multiple factors that go from alteration
  of drug processing to the regulation of the main pathway involved in cell survival
  and proliferation. During drug processing, different conditions favor alteration
  in drug uptake and export. Genetic variants of enzymes involved in drug processing
  reduce activation or enhance inactivation. Genetic mutations affect drug target
  genes causing modifications in drug-target interaction. Cancer cells respond to
  stress conditions by activating feedback pathway that keep them alive, such as enhanced
  proliferation signal (by epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/ extracellular single-regulated kinase pathway), deranged DNA repair
  mechanisms, and inhibition of apoptosis. All of these are mechanisms that counteract
  drugs’ action, making the cell resistant to them.
