caption: The diagram illustrates the processes of organism-wide cholesterol handling,
  and especially the involvement of the lipoproteins VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL, which
  are responsible for the transport of cholesterol between the liver and the peripheral
  tissues. The receptor proteins SR-BI and LDL-R, along with enzymes such as LPL and
  ACAT, are also depicted. The red boxes and arrows indicate the impact of dioxin
  on specific processes
