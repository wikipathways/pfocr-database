caption: 'MiRNA targeted upregulated genes of Rho GTPase signaling. MiRNA target was
  predicted by targetscan, Miranda and DIANAmT. The ruptured plaque microarray data
  were analyzed by SAM, and significantly differentially expressed genes were input
  into DAVID to select the hemostasis related gene. The miRNA targets and Rho GTPase
  related genes were integrated. A: the network of whole blood miRNAs target genes.
  B: the network of plasma miRNAs target genes. The names of genes were official gene
  symbols. MicroRNAs with red border line are the miRNAs presents in the former network
  target the Rho GTPase pathway. The green node represents activation of Rho GTPase
  GDP by GEFS. The brown node represents activation of stream effector by Rho GTPase
  GTP. The blue node represents inactivation of Rho GTPase GTP by GAPs through hydrolysis.
  The purple node represents inactivation of Rho GTpase GDP by GDIs.'
