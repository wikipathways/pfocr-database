caption: Proposed mechanism of autophagy and apoptosis of BM-MSCs caused by hypoxic
  stress. Hypoxia increases the production of IP7, which inhibits activation of Akt
  and subsequently restrains mTOR. Moreover, repressed mTOR directly enhances autophagy.
  Therefore, hypoxic injury induces autophagy regulating apoptosis via Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway mediated by IP7 in BM-MSCs
