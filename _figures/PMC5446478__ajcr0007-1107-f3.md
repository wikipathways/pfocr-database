caption: 'Biochemical and metabolic changes within the tumor. Tumor cells are organized
  as an anabolically active group that continuously interchanges molecules with the
  environment. A. Usually, as the tumor progresses, its cells secrete lactate as an
  anaerobic product of energy metabolism. Lactate, in turn, reduces the pH of the
  surroundings to promote a change in the phenotype of infiltrating macrophages from
  M1 to M2. M2 macrophages, together with myeloid-derived suppressor cells, are associated
  with tolerogenic functions that enable the tumor to evade the immune action. Lactate
  is also mobilized to the liver with the employment of the high vascularization of
  the microenvironment to produce glucose via the Cori cycle, which then can return
  to the tumor in an endless loop. At the same time, malignant cells release acetate
  from lysines within histones as a protective mechanism against the acidic pH. B.
  At the cellular level, the neoplasm develops point mutations in the genome, such
  as mutations that induce the Ras-Akt-mTOR pathway, to increase glycolysis within
  the cell. The continuous activation of glycolysis, together with the Akt-induced
  ACLY enzyme, led to citrate generation within the mitochondria to fuel the Krebs
  cycle. Malate, through the malic enzyme, increases the pyruvate concentration. Both
  citrate and pyruvate are transformed into acetyl-coenzyme A, which can either be
  employed as an acetate group donor for the DNA acetylation process or can be extruded
  from the cell to the microenvironment to function as a regulator of intracellular
  pH. Enhanced glycolysis can also be promoted via the upregulation of hexokinase
  II and by the high glucose concentration secondary to the HIF-1α-mediated increase
  in glucose transporters. HIF-1α is also related to the transcription of glutamine
  transporters at the cellular membrane; along with adipophilin, it induces the formation
  of lipid droplets in close contact with the mitochondria. These lipid droplets contain
  a high amount of fatty acids secondary to the high expression of fatty acid synthase
  by SREBPs. Fatty acids are assembled into triacylglycerides, which are lysed by
  the hormone-sensitive lipase to provide energy to the tumor cell. The translocation
  of glutamine transporters into the cellular membrane promotes an increase in intracellular
  glutamine, which is transformed into glutamate via the upregulation of glutaminase,
  which produces ammonia as a waste product. Ammonia, in turn, is a signal for autophagy
  that the cancer cell employs to secure a continuous pool of energy and biomolecules
  for its anabolic processes. Inside the mitochondria, isocitrate dehydrogenase is
  transformed into an aberrant form of α-ketoglutarate termed 2-hydroxyglutarate.
  This reaction can be promoted by the anaplerotic reaction of glutamate, which is
  introduced as α-ketoglutarate by either GDH or ALT enzymes, depending on the presence
  of low or high glucose metabolism within the cell, respectively. Glutamate, with
  the help of NADPH, is associated with the generation of glutathione, which is the
  most potent antioxidant that safeguards the malignant cell from reactive oxygen
  species-mediated death. Abbreviations: FASN: fatty acid synthase; HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible
