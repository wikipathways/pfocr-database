caption: Cell death via ferroptosis is executed by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation
  occurring on polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched phospholipids. This process
  can be prevented by iron chelators like deferiprone (DFP) and radical-trapping antioxidants
  like liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferroptosis suppressor
  protein 1 (FSP1) are the main systems to counteract lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.
  Inhibition of GPX4 by (1S,3R)-RSL3 (RSL3) and FSP1 by iFSP1, respectively, sensitizes
  cells to ferroptosis. Full activity of GPX4 requires sufficient glutathione (GSH/GSSG),
  whereby the synthesis of GSH relies on its rate-limiting substrate cysteine and
  the enzymatic machinery including γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS). Endogenous
  cysteine, though it might be partially provided through the transsulfuration pathway,
  is largely generated via GSH- or thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1)-mediated reduction
  of cystine, with cystine being mainly imported from the extracellular space by the
  cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc−, at least in cultured cells. While erastin
  and sulfasalazine are classic ferroptosis inducers by inhibiting system xc−, it
  has remained obscure whether sorafenib is a bona fide system xc− inhibitor or ferroptosis
  inducer.
