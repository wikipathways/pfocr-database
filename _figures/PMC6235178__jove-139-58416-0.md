caption: In brief, in the Hippo pathway, upon activation by upstream regulators (e.g.,
  cell-cell contact, nutrient stress, and extracellular matrix [ECM]), MST1/2 (MST;
  mammalian homologs of Drosophila Hippo) serine/threonine (S/T) kinases phosphorylate/activate
  adaptor proteins hMOB1 and WW45, as well as LATS1/2 (LATS) kinases which, subsequently,
  phosphorylate transcriptional co-activator YAP and its paralog TAZ at conserved
  HX(H/R/K)XX(S/T) (H, histidine; R, arginine; K, lysine; S, serine; T, threonine;
  X, any amino acids) motifs, including YAP-S127 and TAZ-S89. S127-phosphorylated
  YAP (YAP-pS127) and S89-phosphorylated TAZ (TAZ-pS89) are degraded by ubiquitination
  or bind to cytoplasmic protein 14-3-3 and are prevented from interacting with TEAD1-4
  transcription factors in the nucleus to transactivate downstream genes involved
  in the cell proliferation and apoptosis (). Despite the tremendous interest in the
  Hippo pathway, few tools for measuring Hippo signaling exist and those that do have
  been historically limited to reporters of YAP/TAZ/TEAD transcriptional output. Indeed,
  until very recently, there were no tools for measuring the dynamics and activity
  of the Hippo signaling components in a quantitative, real-time, high-throughput,
  and non-invasive manner both in vitro and in vivo.
