caption: Overview of the coronavirus (CoV) replicative cycle. After the CoV binds
  to its specific host cell receptor, the virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated
  endocytosis (1), and the genomic RNA is released into the cytosol (2); the latter
  is a result of the fusion of the endosomal and viral membranes. Next, translation
  of the viral genome yields the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab
  (pp1a and pp1ab) (3). Numerous internal proteases then cleave the polyproteins,
  and the resultant viral non-structural proteins (nsps) assemble into an replication-transcription
  complexes (RTCs) that engages in minus-strand RNA synthesis (4). During this step,
  both full-length and subgenomic (sg)-minus strand RNA are produced; the sg-minus
  strand RNA is then used as templates in the synthesis of the sg mRNAs which are
  needed to express the CoV structural and accessory protein genes (5,6). Ultimately,
  the (full-length) genomic RNA is encapsidated by multiple copies of the N protein
  and meets the structural proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate
  compartment (ERGIC) and become enveloped by budding from smooth intracellular membranes
  (7,8). Finally, the new virions leave the cell by following the exocytic pathway
  (9) () (created with BioRender.com).
