caption: Mechanism of action of some stemness regulatory lncRNAs in breast cancer.
  (A) Lnc408 acts as a guide by recruiting chromatin remodelers to the promoter region
  of CBY-1, preventing its expression, and allowing the activation of the WNT signaling
  pathway. (B) LncRNA-KB-1980E6.3 forms an RNA–protein complex that stabilizes the
  mRNA of the C-MYC oncogene, allowing its translation, which generates the acquisition
  of some characteristics that define the stem phenotype. (C) LUCAT1 is a lncRNA that
  acts as a sponge of miR-5582-3P, promoting the activation of the WNT signaling pathway
  and thus increasing the proportion of CD44+ CD24− cells. (D) Inhibition of LncROPM
  decreases some of the characteristics that define the stem phenotype, although its
  mechanism has not yet been elucidated.
