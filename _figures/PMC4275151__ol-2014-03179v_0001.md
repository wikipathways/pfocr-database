  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of azaspirene 2 and preaspyridone 3 illustrating the
  key γ-methyl containing intermediates 4 and 9, respectively. The KS domain of PsoA
  and ApdA use propionyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as the starter unit to initiate polyketide
  synthesis, respectively. Domains labeled with 0 are nonfunctional and are complemented
  with in trans partners. The white arrow represents one round of Claisen-like chain
  elongation catalyzed by the KS domain.
