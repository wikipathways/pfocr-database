caption: ATM activation in response to several stimuli may modulate ITCH activity,
  which in turn may impinge on the stability of some of its substrates. The pathways
  that may activate the ATM-ITCH axis and its downstream targets are depicted in red,
  whereas in black are indicated those stimuli and those targets that have not been
  ascertained yet as novel activators and effectors of this pathway. In the red boxes
  are indicated the hypothetical biological impact of the ATM-ITCH connection, that
  may possibly contribute to the A-T phenotype
