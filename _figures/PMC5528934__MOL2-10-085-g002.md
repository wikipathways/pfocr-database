caption: Genes associated with paclitaxel (A) and gemcitabine (B) mechanism of action
  (direct targets, metabolizing enzymes), genes previously associated with resistance,
  and stable genes in the biological pathways targets. Genes with an asterisk (*)
  are stable genes (Park et al., 2012). Genes highlighted in red showed a positive
  correlation (within dimension 1 and/or dimension 2) between gene expression or copy
  number, and resistance in the MFA, whereas genes highlighted in blue demonstrated
  a negative correlation. Genes outlined in dark grey are those included in the final
  predictive model that was derived using the SVM. Red T‐shaped bars indicate the
  genes that paclitaxel directly binds/inhibits. Genes outlined in light grey (ie.
  BAX/BAK) were not included in the analysis because they were not stable genes in
  the BCL2 pathway.
