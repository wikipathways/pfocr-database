caption: Schematic representation of the pathways expressed during humoral immune
  response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A) MAPK/cAMP pathway; B) Interleukin/MHC pathway;
  C) NF-kappa B pathway; D) PI3K-AKT signal transduction pathway. Camp acts an intracellular
  regulator of cellular homeostasis and also negatively regulates proinflammatory
  signalling, cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β leads to decrease in cAMP in the cells,
  but mechanism behind this action is poorly known so far. In presence of TNF- α,
  ERK 1/2 is phosphorylated which is present in the MAPK signalling cascade, NF-Kappa
  B p65 gets translocated in the nucleus all these occurs when there are lower levels
  of cAMP []. The MAPK pathway and PI3K-AKT pathway are two independent signalling
  pathways which plays important role in cell survival, proliferation and motility.
  These pathways also cross talk extensively to either positively or negatively regulate
  each other [].
