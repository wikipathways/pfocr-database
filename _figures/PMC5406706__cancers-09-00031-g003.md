caption: Spatial localization of functional NG2 interactions. On the apical cell surface,
  the T-2314 phosphorylated NG2 proteoglycan (green oval) activates α3β1 integrin
  (yellow dimer) signaling to promote enhanced proliferation. NG2 also promotes cell
  proliferation via potentiation of growth factor/growth factor receptor signaling
  (indicated here by red FGF and blue FGFR dimer). On leading edge lamellipodia, T-2256
  phosphorylated NG2 activates α3β1 integrin signaling to promote enhanced motility.
  NG2-dependent integrin signaling can also enhance cell survival via the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. In addition, NG2 provides a linkage between the cell surface and the extracellular
  matrix via its interaction with type VI collagen (triple turquoise rods). Signaling
  pathways are shown in abbreviated format due to space consideration. Figure taken
  from [].
