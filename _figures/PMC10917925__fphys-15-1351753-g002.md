caption: Pathways included in the model. (A) VEGF interacting with VEGFR1, VEGFR2,
  and NRP1. Inhibition of VEGFR2 by Hes1 and upregulation of VEGFR1. (B) Pathway leading
  to the downstream phosphorylation of Akt on ser473 and thr308 and activation of
  mTORC1. (C) Notch signaling pathway influenced by hypoxia. Green and blue colors
  represent different cells. DAPT, a γsecretase inhibitor, inhibits NICD cleavage
  by γsecretase. (D) HIF signaling pathway leads to the production of VEGFA. Solid
  green lines indicate normoxia-induced events. Red dashed lines indicate hypoxia-induced
  events. (E) Calcium cycling module includes current through the CRAC channels and
  PM pump, endoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling through SERCA and IP3R, and indirect
  stimulus of IP3 by VEGF. Na + -Ca2+ exchanger increases intracellular calcium concentration
  under hypoxia. (F) MAPK-ERK signaling pathway interacting with the calcium cycling
  module. In all diagrams, arrows pointing to other arrows represent a binding event,
  e.g., VEGF + R1 -> VR1
