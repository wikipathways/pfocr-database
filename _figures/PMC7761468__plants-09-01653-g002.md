caption: 'KEGG pathway of carotenoid biosynthesis containing (A) abscisic-acid (ABA),
  and (B) strigolactones (SLs) biosynthetic pathways. KEGG pathway of carotenoid biosynthesis
  containing (A) abscisic-acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway (dotted red box) and (B)
  strigolactones (SLs) biosynthetic pathway (dotted blue box), dotted green squares:
  precursors and substrates included in ABA and SLs biosynthesis pathway, solid blue
  square: OsNCED5 (1.13.11.51-dioxygenase) enzyme encoded by LOC107275952 and/or LOC107275432
  genes carrying the trait-associated variants (TAVs) identified in this study, solid
  red square: CDD8 (1.13.11.69-synthase) enzyme encoded by D10 gene carrying the TAVs
  identified in this study, and orange squares: other enzymes involved in the pathway.
