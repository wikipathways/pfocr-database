caption: Molecular mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 in regulating gastrointestinal tract tumors.
  SQSTM1/p62 expression may be decreased following the activation of Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4,
  a pathway inhibiting autophagy, including autophagy caused by KRAS mutation and
  BRAFV600E activation. However, under conditions of starvation-induced autophagy
  or in the presence of an HSP90 inhibitor, SQSTM1/p62 expression may also increase
  due to the degradation of LC-3II-bound β-catenin in autophagosomes or the activation
  of heat shock factor 1, respectively. The elevated expression of SQSTM1/p62 ultimately
  not only inhibits the formation of autophagosomes and cell death, but also facilitates
  autophagy, tumor growth and drug resistance. SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; TCF4, transcription
  factor 4; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; HSF1, heat shock factor protein 1.
