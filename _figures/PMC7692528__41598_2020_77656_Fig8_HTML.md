caption: 'Tree diagram-based comprehensive analysis and pathway summary of selected
  potential signaling regulating osteogenic differentiation by cBM-MSCs and cDPSCs
  in vitro. For comprehensive understanding on signaling dynamic, tree diagram analysis
  of functional validated signaling was performed by tracking protein relationship
  at 3 timepoints during osteogenic differentiation (day 7 vs. 0, day 14 vs. 0, and
  day 14 vs. 7), comprising Wnt signaling pathway (A), Notch signaling pathway (B),
  and BMP-related signaling pathways (C). The diagrams illustrated dynamic changing
  of signaling components in cBM-MSCs (green box) and cDPSCs (pink box), while tree
  diagram connectors represented significant protein upregulation or downregulation
  by red or blue code, respectively. Yellow code represented unchanged protein level.
  All episodes were coded as #1 to #27. Numbers in the brackets referred to total
  protein numbers respectively expressed by osteogenic cBM-MSCs and cDPSCs in each
  episode. Summary of unique signaling relationship on osteogenic differentiation
  by cBM-MSCs and cDPSCs was illustrated (D).'
