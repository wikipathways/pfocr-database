caption: Schematic of Ras signaling and its involvement in myeloid malignancies. Ras
  proteins play a critical role in mediating intracellular signaling in response to
  extracellular growth factors by toggling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound
  states. Ras activation is initiated when growth factor receptors, upon ligand binding,
  assemble a complex involving adapter proteins, the phosphatase SHP-2, and guanine
  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like SOS. These GEFs promote the exchange of
  GDP for GTP on Ras, leading to its activation. Once activated, Ras-GTP interacts
  with a variety of downstream signaling proteins, initiating a cascade of signaling
  events that regulate vital cellular processes such as gene expression (β-catenin,
  FOXO, NF-κB, p53, ELK1, AP1), translation (eIF4E, S6), and apoptosis (BAD). The
  Ras signaling pathway is tightly controlled through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP,
  a process facilitated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) like p120GAP and neurofibromin,
  which turn off Ras activity. Mutations in Ras or its regulators are implicated in
  various malignancies, including myeloid cancers, with specific mutations being noted.
