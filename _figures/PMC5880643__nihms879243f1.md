caption: (A) An epitope on pathogens (gray tubes) is bound by circulating antibodies
  (YY) specific to it. C1, the first component of the classical complement pathway,
  then binds to closely-apposed antibodies, forming an immune complex (IC). Notably,
  like certain bacterial and tumor antigens [], Aβ has been shown to bind C1 [] and
  to induce activation of the C1r and C1s proteases without antibody mediation [–].
  C1s-mediated activation of the classical complement pathway ensues, including generation
  of C4b, C3b, and iC3b, which become covalently fixed to the antigen (black bars).
  C1q also remains bound to the antigen. The antigen and/or IC is therefore said to
  be “opsonized” by complement (B). C) Primate (but not subprimate) erythrocytes (RBC)
  express cell-surface CR1, which has C4b, C3b, and C1q as ligands. Antigen/complement
  complexes thus become bound to erythrocytes. D) Erythrocytes then ferry the complex
  through the bloodstream until they reach specialized macrophages, Kupffer cells,
  lining the hepatic sinusoids. Kupffer cells recognize the complement tag via cell
  surface CRIg receptors and strip off and degrade the opsonized antigen [,,].
