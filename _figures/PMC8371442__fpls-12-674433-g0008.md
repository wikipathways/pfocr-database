caption: 'Metabolic pathway network of differentially accumulated metabolites under
  N0 and Nck conditions. The relative content levels of metabolites are shown in column
  charts: orange color column represents N0, and blue color represents Nck. The words
  in green color represent down-regulated metabolites, and those in red color represent
  up-regulated metabolites. The errors are shown in all bar graphs, and a significant
  difference between N0 and Nck in each metabolite is also evaluated, *P < 0.05 significant
  difference, **P < 0.01 extremely significant difference.'
