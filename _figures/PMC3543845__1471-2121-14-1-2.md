caption: The top network, “DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair, Gene Expression,
  Cancer”, formed by genes exhibiting altered expression in MLT-pretreated MCF-7 cells
  upon MMS exposure relative to untreated MMS-exposed cells. Upregulated transcripts
  are shaded in red, while downregulated transcripts are shaded in green, with color
  intensity signifying the magnitude of fold change. Each interaction is supported
  by at least one literature reference identified in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge
  Base, with solid lines representing direct interactions, and dashed lines representing
  indirect interactions.
