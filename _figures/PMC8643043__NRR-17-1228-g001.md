caption: 'Mechanisms of invasion and possible CNS effects of SARS-CoV-2.(1a) The virus
  first enters the body via the nasal passage and makes its way to the olfactory bulb
  by crossing the olfactory epithelium using ACE-2 receptors. From there the virus
  enters the CNS through (2) the mitral cell-neuron synapse. (3) The virus then infects
  astrocytes, ACE-2-expressing glial cells which can also be infected via (1b) astrocytic
  end-feet that surround endothelial cells at the level of the BBB. In addition to
  utilizing cell machinery to proliferate, SARS-CoV-2 provokes the downregulation
  of ACE-2 in host cells, which in turn leads to the over-activation of the RAAS system.
  This promotes the upregulation of the NF-κB pathway and the subsequent transcription
  of genes coding for pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
  TNF-α, and IFN-γ. This medley of cytokines, chemokines, and other pro-inflammatory
  molecules may develop into what is termed the cytokine storm, a life-threatening
  condition that has the potential to cause short- as well as long-term damage on
  the CNS in the form of stroke, auto-immune disease, or encephalopathy, etc. Disruption
  of the BBB and the ensuing infiltration of the CNS by peripheral immune cells (T-cells,
  macrophages, etc.), triggered by microglial antigen presentation, further excarbates
  the situation. The overall result is further aggravation of neuroinflammation and
  injury cascades that include, but are certainly not limited to, synaptic loss, demyelination,
  and excitotoxicity. ACE-2: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; BBB: blood-brain barrier;
  CNS: central nervous system; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; NF-κB: nuclear factor
  κB; RAAS: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.'
