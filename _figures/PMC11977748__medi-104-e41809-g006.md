caption: Leukemogenic mechanism of FUS::ERG and HNRNPH1::ERG. Red “plus” symbol indicates
  the cooperative relationship; red “minus” symbol represents the inhibitive relationship;
  red “question” mark represents unclearly detailed regulatory mechanisms. Red “up”
  arrow represents upregulation. PTPN11 encodes the tyrosine protein kinase SHP-2
  which serves as one of the upstream signaling molecules of the PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathway. Whether PTPN11 mutation frequently co-occur with FUS::ERG positivity and
  the regulatory mechanism is unclear. Nevertheless, it has not yet been discovered
  that HNRNPH1::ERG fusion gene positive and PTPN11 mutation coexist together in AML.
  The FUS-ERG fusion participates in the regulation of the MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling
  pathways by upregulating P-ERK and P-AKT, which promotes the proliferation of leukemia
  cells. The FUS-ERG occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer
  RXR:RARA, inhibiting the ATRA signaling pathway. The FUS::ERG may involve in the
  Rap1 signaling pathway to inhibit myeloid differentiation, by which mechanism is
  unclear. The chimeric proteins of HNRNPH1::ERG shares the same functional structural
  domains as FUS::ERG, which is considered the same leukemogenic mechanism. AML =
  acute myeloid leukemia
