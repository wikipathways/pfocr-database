caption: 'Neuronal injury homeostatically reduces the set point of synaptic strength.
  Schematic illustrating how the postsynaptic muscle responds to active injury-related
  signaling in the presynaptic motor neuron. Baseline neurotransmission is shown.
  Stress: following activation of injury-related signaling in the motor neuron through
  Wallenda (Wnd), the fly homolog of the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), the postsynaptic
  muscle senses this signaling and reduces GluR abundance at the postsynaptic compartment,
  which in turn decreases synaptic strength. Adaptation: although normally this reduction
  in GluR induces retrograde PHP signaling in the muscle, this postsynaptic signal
  transduction pathway is suppressed as the muscle responds to active presynaptic
  Wnd signaling. Therefore, the set point level of synaptic strength is deliberately
  reduced and stabilized through a suppression of retrograde PHP signaling as the
  NMJ acclimates to injury'
