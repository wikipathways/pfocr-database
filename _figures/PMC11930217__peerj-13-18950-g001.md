caption: When TGF-β binds to its receptors (TβR I/II), it activates downstream signals
  through the Smad3/4 complex. Meanwhile, the Notch1 signaling pathway interacts with
  the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway through the HES1 transcription factor. Upon activation,
  Ras-GTP activates RAF, which in turn activates MEK and subsequently ERK. ERK can
  phosphorylate multiple substrates, including transcription factors such as RSK and
  c-Fos, which then regulate gene expression in the nucleus. Additionally, ERK activation
  influences the activity of Fox03, and MDM2, which regulates protein stability. The
  integrated regulation of these signaling pathways plays a crucial role in maintaining
  renal phosphate homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and overall renal
  function
