caption: Overview of the E4orf1 molecular mode of action. Schematic overview of various
  interactions between E4orf1 (blue) and cellular proteins, including the consequences
  of such interactions. See the main text for detailed descriptions that refer to
  this figure. HAdV infection and HAdV-induced mechanisms are described in blue, including
  arrows, while cellular mechanisms are described in black, including arrows. The
  Raf-Mek-Erk signaling pathway, which induces MYC expression, is faded out, since
  although HAdV infection activates this pathway, the E4orf1 mode of action is suggested
  to strongly favor PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation. Red crosses are abrogating modes
  of action, and yellow stars represent activating signaling
