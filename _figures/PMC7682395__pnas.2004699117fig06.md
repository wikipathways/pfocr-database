caption: Summary of findings and their implications. (A) Activation of inactive GDP-bound
  Gαiβγ (step 1) within this pathway requires its physical coupling to a ligand-activated
  RTK within an RTK•GIV•Gαi ternary complex (step 2), and subsequent phosphorylation
  of Gαi on two tandem sites within the interdomain cleft (step 3). Phosphorylation
  enhances nucleotide exchange rate of Gαi, regulates cAMP (step 4), and alters cellular
  phenotypes. (B) Physiologic growth factor-dependent activation of RTKs leads to
  phosphorylation and activation of Gαi and downstream signaling. (C) Pathologic hyperactivation
  of this pathway can occur via activating mutations in Gαi (Left), amplification
  of GIV or RTKs (Right), or activating mutations in RTKs. Such hyperactivation can
  drive cancer progression and tumor cell phenotypes such as increased tumor cell
  migration.
