caption: 'Rod pathways in the mouse retina: identified pathways by which rod (R)-generated
  signals can traverse the retinal circuitry en route to ganglion cells. In the rod
  bipolar pathway rods converge on rod ON bipolar cells (RB), which in turn provide
  glutamatergic input (+) to AII amacrine cells. AII amacrine cells make glycinergic
  inhibitory (−) synapses with both OFF ganglion cells (OFF GC) and OFF cone bipolar
  cells (OFF BC). OFF cone bipolar cells in turn relay glutamatergic (+) input to
  OFF ganglion cells. In the secondary rod pathways, OFF cone bipolar cells receive
  excitatory input from the cone photoreceptor (C) pedicles, or directly from rod
  spherules, depending on their subclass (see discussion).'
