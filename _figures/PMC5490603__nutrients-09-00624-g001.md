caption: Activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways is mediated by
  a complex array of proteins. When TLRs bind ligands, dimerization of the ectodomain
  of TLRs is induced, bringing their cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R domains together, resulting
  in the recruitment of intracellular adapter proteins and initiation of downstream
  signaling events. Following this, the Toll–IL-1-resistence (TIR) domains of TLRs
  engage TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins (either myeloid differentiation primary-response
  protein 88 (MYD88) or TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF)
  and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)). This in turn stimulates downstream signaling
  pathways that involve interactions between IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs) and
  the adaptor molecules TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), and that lead to
  the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) JUN N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and p38, and to the activation of transcription factors. Two groups of transcription
  factors are activated downstream of TLR signaling; nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and
  interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). This TLR signaling pathway leads to the induction
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Zinc influences this pathway on multiple levels. It
  augments MyD88-dependent signaling whereas inhibiting TRIF-mediated activation of
  IRF3/7. It has been shown that zinc inhibits IRAK thereby inhibiting further signal
  transductions. In vitro, zinc also directly impaired LPS-induced IKK activity [].
