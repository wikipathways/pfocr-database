caption: Reaction catalyzed by Class I PEA transferases. A cluster model has been
  proposed to illustrate the catalytic pathway of MCR-1. The first half of the reaction
  involves the formation of a PEA-Enzyme conjugate and the release of diacylglycerol.
  In the second half of the reaction the PEA-lipid A once formed will be released
  from the Enzyme active site. Amino acids are numbered according to their position
  in MCR-1 and side chains are shown. Dashes represent hydrogen bonds while solid
  lines are covalent bonds. The figure was modified from Suardiaz et al. [].
