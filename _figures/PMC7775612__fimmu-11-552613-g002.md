caption: Cell signaling pathways activated in acute inflammation induced by carbon
  nanotubes (CNTs). NF-κB signaling is activated by CNTs and upregulates the expression
  of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-1β, which
  in turn activate this signaling pathway. IL-1R signaling is shown to play a critical
  role in promoting CNT-induced acute inflammation in the lung, which is activated
  by IL-1α and IL-1β. NLRP3 inflammasome signaling is activated by CNTs and generates
  mature IL-1β and IL-18 for secretion and function. These three pathways represent
  the molecular basis for CNT-triggered acute inflammation.
