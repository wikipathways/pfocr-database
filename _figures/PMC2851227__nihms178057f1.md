caption: Cells actively transport Cl− across the plasma membrane by transporters that
  accumulate Cl− intracellularly (Cl− loaders including the Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporters
  NKCC, Cl−-HCO3− exchangers AE, and Na+-Cl− cotransporters NCC) or pump Cl− out of
  the cell (K+-Cl− cotransporters KCC and Na+-dependent Cl− - HCO3− exchanger NDCBE).
  Cl− flows passively across a variety of Cl− channels in the plasma membrane including
  Ca-activated Cl− channels (CaCC), cAMP-activated Cl− channels (CFTR), cell-volume
  regulated anion channels (VRAC), and ligand-gated anion channels (GABAA and glycine
  receptors). In addition, Cl− channels and transporters are found in intracellular
  membranes, such as the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and play a role in regulating
  intra-vesicular pH and Cl− concentration. Intravesicular pH and [Cl−] are important
  in vesicular trafficking (). Finally, many proteins are regulated by Cl− as depicted
  by the Cl− binding protein.
