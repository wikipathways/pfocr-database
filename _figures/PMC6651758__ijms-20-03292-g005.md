caption: Overview of intracellular vesicular trafficking-cellular organelle rough
  endoplasmic reticulum (RER) Coat protein I and Coat protein II form vesicles that
  mediate cargo transport between Golgi to ER and ER to Golgi, respectively. Of the
  major endocytosis pathways, clathrin-coated vesicles form the early endosomes that
  mature into late endosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes leading to protein
  recycling. Clathrin, by associating with Adaptor protein (AP) 1 and 2, extends vesicular
  transport that involves trans-Golgi network. AP3 however, transports proteins to
  lysosomes and other related organelles. Moreover, receptor endocytosis (GPCR) can
  occur in clathrin-dynamin-dependent manner. Caveolin also forms endosomal vesicles
  and joins in the classical endocytic pathway. Phagocytic cells engulf pathogens
  and effect its lysosomal degradation.
