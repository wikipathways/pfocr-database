caption: 'Under homeostatic conditions, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 are anchored to the ER
  membrane by association with BiP. Upon activation of the UPR, BiP releases the effectors
  of the three branches of the UPR. (A) In the pro-survival, adaptive response, IRE1
  dimerizes and autophosphorylates. Phosphorylated IRE1 activates XBP1, which in turn
  is translocated into the nucleus to upregulate the transcription of other adaptive
  UPR genes. Meanwhile, PERK dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and targets eiF2α and
  Nrf2. Once phosphorylated, eIF2α cannot contribute to activation of eIF2 thereby
  halting the initiation of translation. This provides relief to the ER by reducing
  input. Nonetheless, uORF-containing transcripts, such as ATF4, elude the attenuation
  of translation and become enriched. ATF4 can transactivate other adaptive UPR genes
  as well as trigger GADD34 activity. In turn, GADD34 dephosphorylates eIF2α, which
  restarts initiation of translation. Once phosphorylated, Nrf2 also serves as a transactivator
  for pro-survival genes. ATF6, the third branch of the UPR, translocates into the
  nucleus to enhance transcription of UPR genes such as XBP1. (B) Chronic activation
  of the UPR leads to pro-apoptotic signals. IRE1 induces apoptosis by activating
  ASK1 and consequently JNK. In the PERK pathway, sustained attenuation of translation
  by p-eIF2α suppresses protein synthesis. Neurons are particularly susceptible to
  the impact of prolonged reduction of nascent proteins. In the pro-apoptotic phase
  of ATF4, CHOP induces cell death cascades; long-term activation of the ATF4-GADD34
  pathway leads to activation of the pro-apoptotic protein TP53. Abbreviations: UPR:
  unfolded protein response; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PERK: protein kinase
  R-like ER kinase; ATF6: cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor-6; XBP1: X box-binding
  protein 1; eIF2α: eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid
