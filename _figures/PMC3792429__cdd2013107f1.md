caption: Hierarchy of nucleolar stress-induced neuroprotection. RNA polymerase I (RNA
  pol I) is critical for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomes, and
  is regulated by the transcription factor TIF-IA. A variety of protein kinases activated
  in response to mitogenic signals, growth stimuli, and cellular energy status or
  in response to oxidative or endoplasmic reticulum stress regulate TIF-IA at distinct
  serine residues. In HD, the action of nucleolin, which is required for RNA pol I-mediated
  transcription, is interfered with by expanded CAG RNA molecules and leads to CpG
  hypermethylation of upstream control elements in the RNA pol I promoter and a reduction
  in rRNA transcription. Under normal conditions the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (in
  mice; HDM2 in human) and proteasome-dependent degradation keeps the transcription
  factor p53 at low basal levels. Following nucleolar stress various nucleolar proteins
  (RNPs) inactivate MDM2, thereby stabilizing and increasing p53 levels. Elevated
  nuclear p53 levels lead to upregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
  on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which suppresses the mTOR pathway, which is the major inhibitory
  signal that shuts off autophagy in the presence of growth factors and abundant nutrients.
  While p53-dependent induction of PTEN, inhibition of mTOR signaling, and autophagy
  promote neuronal survival and delay neuronal death, MSNs eventually still succumb
  to p53-independent apoptosis
