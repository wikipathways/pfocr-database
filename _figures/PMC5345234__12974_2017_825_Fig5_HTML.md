caption: MAP2K5-centered gene clusters exclusively based on pathway and physical interactions.
  The data was filtered by eliminating colocalization, coexpression, genetic interactions,
  and shared protein domains from the clustering criteria, but maintaining physical
  and pathway interactions. Shades of red represent the level of upregulation, and
  green represents downregulation of each gene. Red lines represent pathway associations,
  and green lines represent associations based on protein physical interactions. A
  group attributes layout was applied to discriminate p values and scores. Scores
  can be also identified by the size of individual nodes. Genes grouped on the left
  had lower p values, and highest scores than genes on the right. Genes in the center
  of the left group were the ones with highest scores, or highest number of connectors
