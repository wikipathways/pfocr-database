caption: 'Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) biogenesis. The ncRNAs are transcribed, but
  not translated. The endogenous siRNA (small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be transcribed
  from both strands of the DNA, and it can have three double stranded primary forms:
  cis, trans and hairpin. The nuclear pore for the export of siRNA is still unknown.
  In the cytoplasm, the primary form of siRNA is processed by a complex of protein
  called Dicer into a single-stranded RNA. The main stand in kept and the passenger
  stand is degraded. siRNA forms a complex with the RISC proteins and, by binding
  with full complementarity to the mRNA, it inhibits its translation. The microRNA
  (miRNA) is transcribed only from one strand of the DNA into a primary form with
  multiple hairpin structure. The primary miRNA is cleaved by the protein complex
  Drosha and it resulted into a single hairpin structure, called the pre-miRNA that
  is exported into the cytoplasm via the Exportin 5 nuclear pore. In the cytoplasm,
  it is processed again by the protein complex Drosha into the mature miRNA with only
  one strand. The miRNA is then loaded into the RISC complex and binds through short
  regions to the mRNA. The piwi interacting RNAs are different from the other two
  classes of small ncRNAs. The piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are transcribed from
  both strands of the DNA and are directly transcribed into single-stranded form.
  The primary form can be loaded onto piwi proteins and induce gene silencing in the
  nucleus, otherwise the piRNA is exported into the cytoplasm, more precisely in the
  mitochondria, where it is cut into shorter fragments. The piRNA targets the transposons
  by entering the ping-pong pathway during which the transposon sequence is silenced
  and the piRNA is amplified. The rectangles framing the DNA signify the region being
  transcribed, while the arrows indicate the direction of the transcription. The other
  arrows stand for the proceeding to the next step in the processing of siRNA/miRNA
  or piRNA, meaning: transcription, cleavage into smaller transcripts, exportation
  into the cytoplasm, the interaction with mRNA interaction either during the Ping-Pong
  pathway in the case of piRNA, or RISC-mediated the case of siRNA and miRNA. The
  red lines illustrate the repression of an interaction.'
