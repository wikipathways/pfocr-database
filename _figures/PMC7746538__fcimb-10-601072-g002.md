caption: 'The role of cathepsins in macrophage functions during bacterial infection.
  (A) During phagocytosis of bacteria, the early phagosome quickly develops due to
  fusion with early endosomes. The early phagosome contains the following markers:
  early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), small GTPase Rab5, vacuolar protein-sorting 34
  (VPS34) and V-ATPase, the latter which ensures a slightly acidic pH. (B) The late
  phagosome is more acidic and contains Rab7, lysosomal-associated membrane proteins
  (LAMPs) as well as cathepsins. Some cathepsins are already active, whereas others
  [e.g., cathepsin D (Cts D)] are present as procathepsins. (C) Following fusion of
  late endosome with lysosome, the phagolysosome with acidic pH is formed. The phagolysosome
  contains NADPH oxidase responsible for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  and many active cathepsins, including Cts B, D, L, and S and other enzymes with
  proteolytic or lipolytic activities. In this compartment, cathepsins participate
  in direct killing of bacteria, which are degraded into peptides. (D) Major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class II molecules are transported from the ER via Golgi complex to
  a specialized acidic compartment called MHC class II compartment (MIIC). During
  MHC II trafficking, the invariant chain (Ii) is cleaved by cathepsins (e.g., S,
  L, and F) leaving CLIP fragment in the MHC peptide binding cleft. In the MIIC, the
  MHC class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) is released and MHC II molecules
  can finally bind bacterial peptide, travel to the cell surface and present it to
  T cells. (E) Cts B, D and L may participate in skewing the T helper (Th)1/Th2 immune
  response. (F) Cathepsins, including Cts K, L and S participate in processing of
  endolysosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and formation of their functional variants,
  capable of binding ligands. After activation of TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing
  interferon (IFN) β (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation factor 88(MyD88), the activation
  signal is transmitted leading to gene transcription and the synthesis of type I
  IFNs or proinflammatory cytokines occurs. (G) Cts X cleaves β2 subunit of the Mac-1
  integrin receptor, enhancing phagocytosis and fibrinogen binding. (H) During autophagy,
  cathepsins participate in degradation of autophagic material within the autolysosome
  (formed after fusion of autophagosome with lysosome), therefore providing bacterial
  peptides for MHC II antigen presentation pathway. (I) Due to lysosomal membrane
  permeabilization (LMP), lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsins, may leak into the
  cytosol. (J) Within the cytosol cathepsins (e.g., Cts B) may participate in NLR
  family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome generation leading to activation
  of caspase 1, which eventually converts inactive pro-interleukin (IL)-1β into active
  IL-1β. (K) Cytosolic Cts D enhances apoptosis by promoting degradation of myeloid
  cell leukemia factor 1 (Mcl-1) via increased Mule-mediated ubiquitination. (L) Cts
  B and S may promote pyroptosis by cleavage of Rip1 kinase. RNA-IC, RNA immune complex;
  CpG ODN, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; TCR, T cell receptor; FcR, Fc receptor; LC3,
  microtubule‐associated protein 1 light chain 3.'
