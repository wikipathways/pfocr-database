caption: Phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis of PTH related proteins. A) A
  phylogenetic tree inferred by maximum likelihood, showing the relationship between
  PTH4 proteins and other proteins of the PTH, PTH2, and PTHLH families. B) Dot-plot
  analysis shows the distribution of paralogs (black dots) of the PTH neighbor genes
  in the first 20 Mb of human chromosome 11 (Hsa11 on the x axis) throughout all chromosomes
  of the human genome (y axis) using both the amphioxus B. floridae and the ascidian
  C. intestinalis genomes as outgroups. Yellow shadow areas highlight conserved syntenic
  regions that probably originated in 2 rounds of WGD that took place during early
  vertebrate evolution (, ) [reviewed in Cañestro ()], including Hsa12 and -19, where
  the ohnologs PTH2 and PTHLH are located (blue circles), and other regions including
  Hsa1 and -6, where PTH ohnologs are missing (PTH-OGM, red circle). C) Analysis of
  the Synteny Database revealed that the genomic neighborhoods of the pth4 gene in
  zebrafish and chickens show extensive conserved synteny with Hsa6, suggesting that
  the putative paralogon region in which the ancestral PTH4-OGM should have been located
  before it was lost (transparent red) in the lineage leading to humans after the
  split of the lineage leading to current armadillos, whereas it has been preserved
  (red) in chicken Gga26 and teleosts such as in zebrafish Dre22. Sequence references
  may be found in Supplemental Fig. S3.

    A) A phylogenetic tree inferred by maximum likelihood, showing the relationship

    B) Dot-plot analysis shows the distribution of paralogs (black dots) of the PTH

    throughout all chromosomes of the human genome (y axis) using both the amphioxus
