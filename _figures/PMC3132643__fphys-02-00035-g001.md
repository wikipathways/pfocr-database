caption: Non-small cell lung cancer-specific EGF-induced EGFR-mediated signal transduction
  pathway model previously developed in Wang et al. (). Extracellular EGF binds to
  the EGF receptor on the cell membrane, inducing receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation.
  The bound receptor forms a docking site for the signaling molecule PLCγ, which then
  activates the Raf signal through PKC. This process then initiates the ERK signaling
  cascade. Detailed chemical reactions, including rate constants and initial concentrations
  of components, are described in Wang et al. (). The two highlighted molecules, PLCγ
  and ERK, are used in an experimentally supported, molecularly driven cellular phenotypic
  decision algorithm (Wang et al., , ). Reproduced with permission from Wang et al.
