caption: Mechanistic illustration of rolipram-induced cAMP-PKA activation in the therapeutic
  of PTSD-like behaviors exacerbated by alcohol exposure. Alcohol exposure together
  with later SPS&FS trauma stimulation promoted cAMP hydrolysis, downregulated the
  activity of PKA-CREB-BDNF-TrkB signaling, resulting in aberrant expression of the
  key synaptic protein AMPA with NMDA receptor subunits, PSD95 and Synaptophysin,
  and this synaptic impairment exacerbated fear and anxiety-like behavior in PTSD
  mice to induce AUD-related behaviors. Following Rolipram administration, the PKA-CREB-BDNF-TrkB
  signaling pathway was activated, leading to the upregulation and downregulation
  of synaptic-associated proteins. This activation enhanced synaptic structure and
  function, as well as dendritic spine complexity, thereby ameliorating fear extinction
  deficits and anxiety-like behaviors in PTSD mice with alcohol exposure. Additionally,
  it reduced ethanol intake and alcohol preference in mice during subsequent alcohol
  re-.exposure
