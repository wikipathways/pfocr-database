caption: The RANTES/CCL5 signalling cascade mediated via the novel chemokine receptor,
  GPR75. Inhibition of observed signalling by the use of wortmannin and U73122 is
  also shown. Although the involvement of PKC in this pathway has not been directly
  demonstrated, activation of PKC has been previously reported to enhance the survival
  of the HT22 murine hippocampal cell line (). Note the large third intracellular
  loop linking transmembrane helices V and VI and also the long C-terminus extending
  from transmembrane helix VII. These regions of GPR75 are anticipated to interact
  with the heterotrimeric G protein and may account for the atypical signalling described
  by .
