caption: The uncommon structure and weak biological activation of H. pylori LPS leads
  to the inefficient activation of NF-κB and production of low levels of proinflammatory
  molecules. On the other hand, H. pylori activates NOD2 and ATG16L1 to activate autophagy,
  and the process of autophagosome formation results in the endocytosis of MHC II
  and inhibition of NF-κB. The disequilibrium between inflammation and autophagy (the
  latter is relatively enhanced by H. pylori infection) may have a key role in the
  formation of tolerogenic semi-mature DCs. Moreover, NOD2 forms trimers with p38
  and hnRNP-A1, and the latter subsequently enters the nucleus to stimulate IL-10
  transcription. IL-10 and TGF-β are required for the activation of the Smad signaling
  pathway and downstream protective mechanisms, including the inhibition of TLR expression
  and the NK-κB signaling pathway and the induction of CDX2 production and MUC2 transcription.
  In addition, NLRP3 and IL-18 are indispensable for the protective effect of H. pylori
  on experimental colitis. Due to the NF-κB-independent production mechanism, pro-IL-18
  is stably expressed in the cytoplasm and is effectively produced by activated NLRP3
  and caspase-1 after H. pylori infection
