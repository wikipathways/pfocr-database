caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in CAFs and the crosstalk of CAFs with cancer
  cells. In the CAFs, by the receptor–ligand binding, activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), while miRNA-21 could attenuate the inhibition of phosphatase and tensin
  homolog (PTEN) on PIP3. As a result, PIP3 activated phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1)/AKT signaling cascade to transfer the rapamycin target protein (mTOR) into
  the nuclei, subsequently regulating the expression of targeted genes associated
  with differentiation into CAFs and motility, etc. Notch signaling pathway was also
  involved in CAF differentiation via AKT signaling pathway. B7-H3 promoted AKT phosphorylation
  for proliferation in CAFs, while AKT phosphorylation was involved in the inhibitory
  effects on the migration mediated by GW4064. Similarly, CAF-derived HGF, IGF-2,
  IL-22, and CXCL5 can activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, while CXCL12 can inhibit
  PTEN. Nodal-induced activation of Smad2/3 could activate AKT phosphorylation and
  lncRNA UCA1 collaborated with mTOR. Consequently, CAF-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway regulated the cell proliferation, migration, and stemness in cancer cells.
