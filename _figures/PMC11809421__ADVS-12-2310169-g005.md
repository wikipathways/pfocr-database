caption: A proposed model of how Chi3L1 promotes fibrosis in SSc. SSc triggers sustainable
  and complicated inflammation process, possibly inducing the enrichment of basal
  cells with high expression of Chi3L1. Chi3L1 promotes fibrosis in SSc primarily
  via activating fibroblasts. Mechanistically, Chi3L1 directly interacts with IL‐17RA
  on fibroblasts, which in turn activates downstream NF‐kB and MAPK pathways, thereby
  upregulates fibrosis‐related genes, ultimately leading to enhancement of differentiation
  into myofibroblasts and detrimental collagen‐rich ECM
