caption: Loss of function of Apc is accompanied by multiple changes in gene expression,
  including upregulation of active β-catenin (dephospho-β-catenin), activation of
  Wnt and Cited1. Hence, immediately following deletion of Apc, Cited1 normally restrains
  the Wnt pathway at the level of β-catenin. We observe a range of rapid phenotypic
  changes. These include increase in proliferation and apoptosis and loss of differentiated
  cell types, also reduced migration, leading to the preferential retention of Apc
  deficient cells. These changes may all be considered pro-tumourigenic, leading to
  survival advantage of the tumour cell and decreased survival of the ApcMin/+ mouse
  compared to WT. Additional Cited1 deficiency leads to hyper-activation of Wnt signaling
  including upregulation of active β-catenin and an exaggerated Wnt phenotype including
  elevated proliferation, a further loss of cell differentiation, and most importantly
  increased cell death. The net effect of these changes is an increase in ApcMin/+
  survival. This restraint imposed by Cited1 is consistent with a requirement for
  Cited1 to constrain Wnt activity to a level commensurate with optimal adenoma formation
  and maintenance, and provides one mechanism for tumour repression in the absence
  of Cited1.
