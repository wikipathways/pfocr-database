caption: A model whereby both uracil glycosylases and the Pms2/Mlh1 complex enable
  A-T base pair mutagenesis with a distinct strand bias. (A) Overlapping enzymatic
  activities generate entry sites for ExoI in MMR-mediated A-T mutagenesis. (Right)
  Recognition of AID deamination products by Msh2–Msh6 stimulates the endonuclease
  activity of the Pms2–Mlh1 complex, which acts at distance on either DNA strands.
  (Left) In a situation of processive deamination, nicks introduced by uracil glycosylase–mediated
  base excision (UNG, SMUG1, and TDG) and APEX2 strand incision can participate in
  MMR-mediated error-prone repair. Glycosylases may also act in the context of two
  independent deamination events on both DNA strands or, possibly, in the context
  of a single uracil (see Discussion). (B) Pms2 versus uracil glycosylase contribution
  estimated from A/T mutation ratios. The 1.8- to twofold A over T ratio observed
  in hypermutation was estimated to correspond to a 3:1 strand bias in error-prone
  DNA synthesis, taking into account the intrinsic T over A mutation preference of
  Pol η (a 4:1 higher mutation frequency opposite T than opposite A; ). This strand
  bias is represented by arrows of unequal length, representing the relative A:T mutagenic
  patch on each strand, without aiming at indicating whether the patch is shorter
  or less frequent on the transcribed strand or differently located on the locus.
  If one considers, from mutations observed in Pms2−/− mice, that uracil glycosylases
  operate mainly on the coding, nontranscribed strand and that PMS2 endonuclease operates
  without strand bias and is responsible for most mutations introduced in the transcribed
  strand, both pathways appear to contribute equally to the generation of Msh2/6-driven
  A-T mutations.
