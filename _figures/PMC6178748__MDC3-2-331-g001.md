caption: Localization of A2A receptors within the striatum. A2A receptors are expressed
  on cortical projection neurons contacting striatal projection neurons of the direct
  pathway, where they form dimers with adenosine 1 (A1) receptors. A2A receptors are
  also encountered on striatal projection neurons of the indirect pathway, where they
  form dimers with dopamine D2, mGlu5, and CB1 receptors. Modified from a previous
  work.
