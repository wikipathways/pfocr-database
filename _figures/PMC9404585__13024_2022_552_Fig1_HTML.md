caption: 'TYROBP structure and signaling pathway. Left panel: Mouse and human TYROBP:
  the TYROBP protein consists of a 27-aa leader peptide, a small 14-aa (16-aa in mouse,
  in blue) extracellular region, a 24-aa transmembrane segment, and a 48-aa (49-aa
  in mouse) cytoplasmic domain. Because of two cysteine residues (Cys33/35) in its
  extracellular region, TYROBP forms a disulfide-bonded homodimeric complex. TYROBP
  contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic
  region. Right panel: Following ligand-binding by a TYROBP-associated receptor, the
  ITAM motif can be phosphorylated on its two conserved tyrosine residues by SRC kinases
  and induce the intracellular recruitment and activation of the spleen tyrosine kinase
  (SYK). Upon SYK recruitment, several downstream effector molecules such as phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), the small GTPase RAS, or the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) are mobilized,
  resulting in activation of transcription, proliferation, release of cytokines, and
  phagocytosis. Abbreviations: DAG, diacylglycerol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ;
