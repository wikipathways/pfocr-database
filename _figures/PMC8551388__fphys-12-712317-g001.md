caption: The effects of hypoxia on formation of Aβ plaques, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation
  – the pathophysiology of AD. (1) In normoxia, the formation of Aβ peptide is less
  due to the α-secretase cleaves at the middle of the Aβ domain. (2) In hypoxic condition,
  the activities of β- and γ-secretase are increased resulting in production of Aβ
  peptide. Concurrently, hypoxia also decreases the activity of neprilysin (NEP) in
  degrading the Aβ peptide. As a result, more toxic Aβ oligomers are produced which
  leads to formation of Aβ plaques. (3) The Aβ plaques dysregulate the calcium homeostasis
  of the neurons which increase the calcium ions influx, leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction, protease and lipase activation and osmotic swelling, eventually cause
  neuronal excitoxicity. (4) The formation of Aβ plaques causes neuroinflammation
  and oxidative stress, leading to activation the NF-κβ and Nrf2 signalling pathways
  in the microglial cell. (5) Neuroinflammation activates Iκβ-kinase (IKK), which
  leads to phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κβ, I-κβ and hence targets the later
  for polyubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation. As a result, the NF-κβ
  dimer (p50 and p65) is released, which then translocates into the nucleus, binds
  with the NF-κβ response elements of the genome. This leads to transcription of pro-inflammatory
  genes, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 which aggravate the neuroinflammatory response
  and oxidative stress. (6) On the other hand, oxidative stress activates Nrf2 signalling
  pathway by dissociating Nrf2 from its inhibitor, Keap1. In normal condition, Nrf2
  is bound to cytosolic repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and
  labelled for polyubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation. However, during
  neuroinflammation and/or oxidative stress, the Nrf2 is released from Keap1, which
  then translocates into the nucleus, binds with anti-oxidant response elements of
  the genome along with small Maf proteins. This leads to transcription of anti-oxidant
  genes and phase II enzymes, such as NADPH, GSH, SOD, CAT and HO-1, which exhibit
  neuroprotective effects on neuronal cells.
