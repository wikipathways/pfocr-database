caption: Sulfide-producing pathways. There are several sulfide-generating pathways
  and enzymes. The assimilatory reduction of sulfite generates sulfide for cysteine
  synthesis. The dissimilatory pathway of sulfite reduction uses sulfite as an electron
  acceptor for anaerobic respiration. CdsH is a cysteine catabolic enzyme that is
  controlled by YbaO. YbaO also controls a second enzyme, indicated by “?,” which
  will be the topic of another communication. The Sbp protein is the sulfate-binding
  protein that transports sulfate into the cell. In addition to these enzymes, the
  cysteine desulfurases and CysK and CysM proteins might provide background sulfide
  as side reactions.
