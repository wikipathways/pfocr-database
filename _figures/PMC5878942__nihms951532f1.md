caption: Irisin stimulates the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) by inducing
  the expression of UCP1 gene and, consequently, of UCP1 protein via the p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Brown
  adipose tissue (BAT) has an increased number of mitochondria and increased energy
  expenditure due to elevated oxygen consumption, and accumulates smaller lipids than
  do white adipocytes. After cold exposure, BAT has higher glucose uptake and GLUT4
  (also known as SLC2A4) expression than WAT. Irisin, which is also secreted from
  muscle after cold exposure, can stimulate browning; a possible involvement of irisin
  in glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression seems to be plausible but has not yet been
  investigated. Irisin also stimulates lipolysis via the cyclic AMP (cAMP)–protein
  kinase A (PKA)–perilipin–hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) pathway and through the
  upregulation of the expression of PNPLA2 (also known as ATGL), HSL and FABP4.
