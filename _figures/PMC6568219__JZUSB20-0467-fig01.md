caption: 'Cell cycle-dependent fate determination in embryonic stem cellsIn the early
  G1 phase, the TGF-β-SMAD2/3 pathway promotes the differentiation of ESCs into endodermal
  cells by activating endodermal genes, whereas the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex governs
  the fate conversion of ESC-derived progenies from endoderm cells to neuroectoderm
  cells by phosphorylating SMAD2/3 in the late G1 phase. Once the cell cycle of ESCs
  is arrested in the S and G2 phases, DNA damage checkpoint factors ATM/ATR are activated,
  and subsequently stimulate p53 and cyclin B. Activated cyclin B enhances TGF-β/activin/nodal
  signaling, which can trigger the selective preference of pluripotency in ESCs. ESCs:
  embryonic stem cells; TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β; CDK: cyclin-dependent
  kinase; ATM: ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR: ATM and Rad3-related; CHEK2: checkpoint
  kinase 2'
