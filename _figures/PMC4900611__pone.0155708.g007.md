caption: 'Pathway analysis was performed with the Pathway Studio 9 software. Using
  the PCR Array data, a network was generated in which the genes and gene products
  are represented by nodes. The shapes of the nodes represent the protein’s primary
  function and the connection lines indicate the type of interaction (colored lines:
  direct regulation; dotted gray lines: indirect regulation). Color intensity reflects
  the level of gene expression in LB-piVe infected cells versus control if the fold-change
  ≥1.2 (red: up-regulated; blue: down-regulated; grey: no change in expression).'
