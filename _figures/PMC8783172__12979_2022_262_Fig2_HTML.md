caption: SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells of the nasopharyngeal tract and enters
  the cytoplasm. Here, the Spike protein and the M-protein inhibit cytoplasmic pathogen-recognition
  receptors (PRRs) like RIG-I and MDA-5. This results in abrogated stimulation of
  interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key to eliciting an antiviral
  type I and type III IFN response. Below the infected epithelium sentinel immune
  cells like macrophages (Mac) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) encounter the
  virus by endosomal uptake. In the endosome, binding of single stranded RNA of SARS-CoV-2
  results in activation of TLR7. In the case of an active toll-like receptor (TLR)7-signaling
  pathway (left), TLR7-engagement results in a cytokine and interferon response. This
  secondary IFN release by sentinel cells can bring about the antiviral response by
  augmenting natural killer (NK) and CD8 cytotoxic T cell activities, thereby containing
  infection with SARS-CoV-2, and preventing systemic spread. In contrast, vulnerable
  patients with either loss-of-function alleles of TLR7 or a downregulated TLR-signaling
  pathway prior to infection (right) lack also this second IFN response. Age-related
  inflammation or inflammation related to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) leads to an
  enhanced expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146). In turn, miR-146 targets downstream
  signaling molecules of the TLR7-pathway including interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK1) or TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Ultimately, the response
  of the TLR7-signaling pathway is subdued even though the receptor TLR7 itself is
  sensing viral RNA, and the IFN response by sentinel cells is missing. SARS-CoV-2
  can then spread systemically, thereby establishing severe forms of COVID-19 disease
