caption: Prostate development progresses from the undifferentiated UGS epithelium
  and stromal cells to the invasion of the mesenchyme by the developing epithelium.
  The budding and branching of the epithelium form the ductal structures observed
  in the mature prostate. Although the prostate can remain healthy, over the lifetime
  of a man there is 1:6 chance of developing prostate cancer. Interestingly, pathways
  that are essential for prostate development are often re-expressed in prostatic
  diseases. Although, many different signaling pathways have been implicated in disease
  and development, here we highlight those pathway where recent progress has been
  made in links to prostate cancer, particularly those that are target of novel therapeutics
  that are in clinical trials. The pathways that increase in prostate cancer are in
  black and those that are repressed or have a loss of expression are shown in grey.
  Nkx3.1 and Pten, markers of early epithelium and differentiation, are completely
  absent or have reduced expression in prostate cancer, , . In addition TGFβRII is
  frequently downregulated in cancer. Pathways such as AR, Shh, PI3K, and Wnt signaling
  are upregulated in prostate cancer and promote the proliferation and tumor formation,
  , . AR, Shh, and PI3K pathway are the targets for several drugs that are in clinical
  trials for prostate cancer, , , , . In addition to signaling pathways, prostate
  cancer also displays a gene expression profile that is more similar to the developing
  prostate than the healthy adult prostate. The return to a less differentiated state
  is a hallmark in many cancers, and the current studies in prostate cancer support
  the re-expression of many pathways that are important in development.
