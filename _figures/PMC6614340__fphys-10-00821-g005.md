caption: α-CGRP-mediated intracellular signaling. α-CGRP elevates intracellular cAMP
  level through CLR/RAMP1, G-protein Gαs, and adenylate cyclase (AC) activation. Elevated
  level of cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) and increases various downstream
  signaling molecules, including the potassium-sensitive ATP channels (K-ATP channels),
  L-type Ca+2 channel, ERK, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In addition,
  α-CGRP signaling is also able to act through other G-proteins such as Gαi/o and
  Gαq/11. CGRP through Gαq/11 stimulates the IP3-PLC pathway leading to an increase
  in intracellular Ca+2 concentrations. DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol triphosphate;
  PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
