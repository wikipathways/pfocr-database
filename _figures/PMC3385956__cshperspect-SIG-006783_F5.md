caption: Hexosamine and acetyl-CoA metabolite levels integrate signaling with cell
  growth and proliferation. In addition to being metabolized through glycolysis, fructose
  6-phosphate can act as a nitrogen acceptor from glutamine and be converted to glucosamine
  6-phosphate. Further metabolism through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway results
  in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNac). UDP-GlcNac can be used for N-linked-glycosylation
  reactions, including that involving growth factor receptor subunits as they are
  being processed in the ER. This glycosylation promotes the expression and localization
  of receptor subunits at the cell membrane, where they can respond to growth factor.
  Another metabolically sensitive protein modification occurs when acetyl-CoA is used
  as a substrate for the acetylation of histones in the nucleus, a modification that
  alters gene expression. The supply of acetyl-CoA for acetylation reactions depends
  on the activity of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL).
