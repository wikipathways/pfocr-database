caption: In the default AWCOFF cell, tir-1 acts in a calcium-regulated kinase signaling
  pathway to represses the expression of the AWCON marker str-2. Both nsy-4 and nsy-5
  act to increase the level of mature mir-71, which results in downregulation of tir-1
  expression and subsequent de-repression of str-2 gene expression in the cell that
  becomes AWCON. Gray is used to indicate the gene product is less active or inactive.
