caption: Schematic illustrating the G protein-independent role of RGS6 in doxorubicin-induced
  apoptosis and antiproliferative signaling in the breast. a RGS6 is induced by doxorubicin
  (Dox) treatment and functions as a critical upstream mediator of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)-dependent activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-p53-apoptotic
  pathway in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. Whether the
  RGS6-dependent upregulation of p53 in response to Dox induces autophagy by DNA-damage
  regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) is unknown. b RGS6 is also a multifunctional
  tumor suppressor that simultaneously inhibits cell cycle progression and pro-growth
  signal downstream of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and the estrogen
  receptor (ER). In addition, RGS6 functions as a scaffold protein to promote Tip60-mediated
  DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) acetylation leading to its degradation
  and preventing DNMT1 silencing of pro-apoptotic genes. This represents an essential
  role of RGS6 in preventing reticular activating system (Ras)-induced oncogenesis.
