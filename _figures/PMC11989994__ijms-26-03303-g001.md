caption: Schematic of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Glucose is converted to
  fructose-6P (fructose-6-phosphate) once it enters the HBP. Next, glutamine-fructose-6P
  amidotransferase 1 (GFAT), the HBP’s rate-limiting enzyme, adds an amino group from
  glutamine to fructose-6-phosphate to create glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P).
  Following this, in the presence of acetyl-CoA, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  (GNPNAT, EMeg32) quickly acetylates GlcN-6P to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-6P). GlcNAc phosphomutase (PGM3/AGM1) then isomerises this compound to produce
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1P). This is then added to the sugar by
  UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP/AGX1) to yield UDP-GlcNAc which
  is the amino sugar substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation. Protein O-GlcNAcylation
  is a nutrient- and stress-responsive PTM controlled by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase
  (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). While OGT catalyses the attachment of the O-GlcNAc
  moiety from a UDP-GlcNAc substrate to target proteins, OGA reverses this process
  [47]. O-GlcNAcylation occurs on serine and threonine residues of target proteins,
  sites that may also be targets for phosphorylation by Ser/Thr-directed protein kinases.
