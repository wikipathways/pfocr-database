caption: Potential models to describe how Ras/PKA signaling activity influences autophagy
  and how this control might be coordinated with that of the Tor signaling pathway.
  A, Ras/PKA signaling pathway regulates an early event in autophagy, an event that
  precedes the formation of the autophagosome. The schematic shows a number of the
  steps involved in the autophagy process and the relative position of the event most
  likely to be controlled by Ras/PKA signaling activity. B, schematic depicting the
  relative order of action of the Ras/PKA and Tor signaling pathways on the autophagy
  process. The data presented here, and in other recent studies, are consistent with
  the Ras/PKA pathway acting either (i) independently or (ii) downstream of the Tor
  signaling pathway. See the text for further details.
