caption: Common ubiquitin linkages and their consequences. (a) Polyubiquitin chains
  linked via lysine 48 (K48) to the preceding ubiquitin molecule usually target proteins
  for degradation via the 26S proteasome. Poly-K48 chains can also result in proteasome-mediated
  protein cleavage such as in the case of the NF-κB subunits, p100 and p105, being
  processed into p52 and p50, respectively. (b) Polyubiquitination via lysine 63 (K63)
  is also common. This type of ubiquitination usually acts as a scaffold for UBPs
  that recruit other protein complexes, and also mediates alternate outcomes such
  as changes to cell signalling (e.g. ubiquitinated RIP can recruit NF-κB signalling
  pathway components), activation of the endosomal pathway (e.g. resulting in internalization
  of membrane proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases) and activation of the autophagic/lysosomal
  pathway (e.g. resulting in degradation of target proteins and organelles independently
  of the proteasome). (c) Monoubiquitination, or multi-monoubiquitination, can result
  in changes to substrate function, localization or protein binding.
