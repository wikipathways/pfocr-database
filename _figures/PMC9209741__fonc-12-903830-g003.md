caption: The role of AKT in DNA damage. (A) Canonical AKT signaling begins with the
  activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (e.g., VEGFR, EGFR, or IGFR). Receptor
  activation, by binding of a ligand, dimerization, and autophosphorylation, causes
  binding and activation of p85 and p110, the respective regulatory and catalytic
  subunits of PI3K. Activated PI3K will go on to catalyze the conversion of PIP2 to
  PIP3, a process which can be reversed by the tumor suppressor PTEN. If PIP3 is formed,
  it will recruit AKT to the membrane at which point AKT will be phosphorylated by
  PDK1 and mTORC2. This dual phosphorylation fully activates AKT, allowing it to affect
  several downstream processes such as cell survival, proliferation, growth, and the
  DNA damage response. (B) Following exposure to radiation, repair proteins (e.g.
  ATM, ATR, DNA-PKs) are recruited to the damaged site to facilitate repair. The activation
  and recruitment of these proteins correlates with an increase in phosphorylated
  AKT. p-AKT then inhibits apoptosis through Bad and Bax inhibition and Bcl-2 activation.
  p-AKT will also inhibit the downstream target of p53, p21, to inhibit cell cycle
  arrest. A feedback loop exists in that AKT can also phosphorylate and activate these
  proteins to aid in DNA repair. AKT facilitates NHEJ by phosphorylating DNA-PKs and
  inhibits HR by promoting cytoplasmic localization of BRCA1 and Rad51. (C) Irradiation
  decreases the population of tumor cells at the perivascular niche with the exception
  of stem cells which are largely radioresistant. Nestin-positive stem cells in the
  perivascular niche treated with radiation activate the PI3K/AKT pathway to undergo
  cell cycle arrest and re-enter the cycle 72 hours later, driving MB survival and
  recurrence. AKT inhibition prior to irradiation abrogates perivascular stem cell
  radiation resistance, leading to apoptosis of these cells.
