caption: Maintenance of lysosomes by PD gene products and its relevance to PD. Lysosomal
  homeostasis is regulated by several PD genes such as ATP13A2, LRRK2, GBA, and VPS35.
  Deficiency in ATP13A2, a P5-type ATPase localized to the lysosomal membranes, is
  expected to affect lysosomal functions via dysregulated transport of several divalent
  metal cations and polyamines. LRRK2 functions in the maintenance of stressed lysosomes
  by facilitating the exocytic release of lysosomal contents together with its substrate
  Rab10 under lysosomal overload stress. LRRK2 may also negatively regulate the activity
  of lysosomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Decreased activity of GCase causes
  the accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which stabilizes toxic
  α-synuclein species. Accumulation of α-synuclein has been shown to block ER-to-Golgi
  trafficking of GCase, causing a further decrease in lysosomal GCase. The retromer
  component VPS35 mediates the retrieval of a CMA receptor LAMP2A on endolysosomal
  membranes, and mutation in VPS35 leads to the enhanced degradation of LAMP2A at
  the lysosomes, causing CMA defects and α-synuclein accumulation. VPS35 mutation
  also causes the enhancement of LRRK2 kinase activity, which may then affect the
  lysosomal maintenance and GCase activity.
