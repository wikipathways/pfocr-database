caption: Historic (A) versus updated model (B) of IRS signaling. Our understanding
  of the IL-4-activated IRS signaling pathway has increased substantially between
  (A) 2000 and (B) 2018. The involvement of the TOR complexes, SOCS proteins, small
  adaptor proteins (GRBs and GABs), and other regulatory proteins in negative and
  positive regulation of IRS2 signaling has been uncovered. The differences in signaling
  triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 were determined, with IL-4 being a more potent activator
  of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 than IL-13. Recently, IRS2 has been described
  as a negative regulator of IRS1, yet many interactions and roles of this pathway
  remain to be fully understood.
