caption: The apoptosis signaling pathway. Alantolactone mediates the generation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, which leads to
  caspase-9 and −3 cleavage by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and
  increasing cytochrome c release, ultimately inducing apoptosis in thyroid cancer
  cells. Thyroid hormones inhibit apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells through activation
  of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. FOXP3 inhibition
  promotes apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells and suppresses thyroid carcinogenesis
