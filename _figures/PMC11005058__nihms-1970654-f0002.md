caption: 'In mouse effector T cells (left side, teal), leptin signalling promotes
  CD4+ T cell differentiation to TH17 by promoting STAT3-activated expression of the
  genes encoding the transcription factor RORγt (RORC in human) and the cytokine IL-17,
  which are both characteristic factors expressed by TH17. In effector B cells (right
  side, purple) leptin receptor stimulation by leptin activates JAK2–STAT3-dependent
  expression of cytokines from B cells, including IL-10, IFNγ and TNF. Leptin signalling
  in both B and T cells additionally activates the PI3K–Akt signalling pathway outlined
  in  and shown again here, which ultimately favours glycolysis to increase effector
  cell expansion in response to BCR (in B cells) or TCR (in T cells) engagement. AKT,
  protein kinase B; BCR, B cell receptor; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; IFNγ: interferon
  gamma; r; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3 -kinase;; PIP2: phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-biphosphate;
  PIP3: phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-triphosphate; TCR, T cell receptor; TH17, T helper
