caption: Extrinsic signal pathways for regulating pluripotency during reprogramming.
  Extrinsic signaling pathways are required for maintaining the pluripotency of iPS
  cells as ES cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling activates Jak-Stat3
  to induce target genes essential for pluripotency and also to inhibit glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK3β) to trigger the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus for activation
  of pluripotency-related genes. GSK3β also is inhibited by Wnt signaling through
  the activation of dishevelled (Dsh). PI3K signal can be activated by growth factors
  (GFs) or LIF, and this PI3K signal also inhibits the GSK3β function of degradation
  of β-catenin to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency. The extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (Erk) pathway, which can also be activated by LIF, triggers the expression
  of differentiation-promoting genes. For maintaining pluripotency and blocking differentiation,
  Erk must be inhibited by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals and transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β/Activin A signals through Smad protein-complex formation.
