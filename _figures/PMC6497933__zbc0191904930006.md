caption: Summary of the DEPs involved in central carbon metabolism and fatty acids
  synthesis. The pentose phosphate pathway, the glycolysis process, the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle, and the fatty acid biosynthesis are presented. G6PD (6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase, ssp7623), TPI (triose-phosphate isomerase, ssp2201), PK (pyruvate
  kinase, ssp2703), LPD1 (dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, ssp8613), CSY4 (citrate synthase,
  ssp8508, ssp8520), SDH1–1(succinate dehydrogenase, ssp6709), CAC2 (biotin carboxylase
  1, ssp5602). The regions derived from the same 1355B and 1355A 2-DE gel, are given
  on the left and right, respectively. The histogram and the representative 2-DE map
  are presented to show the results of 2-DE proteomic analysis. The heat map presents
  the results of label-free quantitative proteomic analysis. The proteins highlighted
  in blue are the DEPs from the 2-DE proteomic analysis; the proteins highlighted
  in orange are the DEPs from the label-free quantitative proteomic analysis. Molecular
  weight (Mr) and isoelectric point calculated by using molecular weight standards
  and the PD-Quest software.
