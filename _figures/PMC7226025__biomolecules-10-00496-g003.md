caption: Potential consequences of fructose metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC). A traditional HCC cancer cell may exhibit the Warburg effect where glycolysis
  is favored to produce ATP and glycolytic products for nucleotide synthesis. If this
  cancer cell is exposed to fructose as the only source of fuel, the toxic effects
  of fructose may be deleterious to the cell by depleting energy and increasing ROS,
  leading to cell death. However, in cancer cells exposed to high concentrations of
  fructose, the cancer cell may metabolically adapt to sustain growth through activation
  of the MCT and gluconeogenic enzymes. In this case the cell switches to the ‘reverse
  Warburg effect’ to utilize fructose by-products to fuel nucleotide synthesis and
  to uptake catabolites from neighbouring cells for production of energy and antioxidants.
