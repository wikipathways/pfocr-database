caption: NOX4/TRPC6 pathway is important in podocyte calcium regulation and renal
  damage progression in diabetic kidney disease. The hypothesis featured in this manuscript
  offers elevated AngII levels as one of the potential stimuli that could lead to
  activation of NOX4 in diabetic conditions. This would lead to an augmented production
  of H2O2, which in turn would activate TRPC6 channels and stimulate calcium influx
  into the cells, eventually leading to podocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. An alternative
  hypothesis suggests that high glucose in DKD can by itself activate RAS and result
  in ROS production and oxidative stress, which results in increased TRPC6 expression.
  Both pathways would lead to increased calcium influx in the podocytes.
