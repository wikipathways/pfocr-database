caption: The activation process of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PI3K, composed of one
  catalytic (p110) domain and one regulatory (p85), can be activated by G-protein
  coupled receptor, RTK, IGF-R, and B-cell receptor. Activated PI3K facilitates the
  conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 activates PDK1, and then PDK1 phosphorylates AKT
  at Thr308. AKT can be also phosphorylated, and activated by PDK2 at Ser473. Activated
  AKT can regulate mangy cellular biological functions by interacting with numerous
  downstream signaling molecules, such as p21, p27, TGFβ, ataxin-1, GABA receptors,
  Bad, NF-κB, and mTOR. Image created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
