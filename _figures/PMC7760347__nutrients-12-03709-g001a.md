caption: '(A) Sites of synthesis and metabolism of primary, secondary, and tertiary
  bile acids (BA) in humans. Cholesterol in the liver undergoes modification of the
  sterol ring, oxidation, and shortening of the side chain. The classical “neutral”
  pathway involves the cytochrome P450 enzyme, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1),
  and contributes to about 75–90% of total BA pool consisting of cholic acid (CA)
  and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The alternative “acidic” pathway is mitochondrial
  and contributes to 10–25% of total BA pool [,] with the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol
  27α-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and then 25-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1)
  [,] to produce CDCA. BA in the liver undergo conjugation with amino acids, glycine
  or taurine (ratio of 3:1), via N-acyl amidation at carbon 24 of the aliphatic side
  chain [] and active biliary secretion. In the colon the resident bacteria interact
  with primary BA by dehydroxylation, dehydrogenation, 7α-dehydroxylation and epimerization.
  By this pathway, secondary BA are the dihydroxy deoxycholic acid (DCA) and the monohydroxy
  lithocholic acid (LCA). The 7α-dehydrogenation of CDCA forms the dihydroxy 7α-oxo-LCA
  which is metabolized to the “tertiary” 7β-epimer, the dihydroxy ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA). In the liver, a small amount of LCA is quickly transformed to sulphonated
  form (S-LCA). In the terminal ileum, BA uptake is about 80% by active transport
  within the enterocytes. In the colon, secondary BA undergo passive diffusion and
  reabsorption (~15%) [] into the portal tract. (B) Relative composition of hepatic
  and gallbladder bile in healthy humans. Left: major solutes; right: contribution
  of individual bile acids. Changing the composition of the BA pool could ultimately
  influence the signalling ability of BA on nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X
  receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), as well as
  the membrane-associated receptors G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR-1)
  and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) [,,].'
