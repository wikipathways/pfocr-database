caption: Figure 2 (not at scale) show confirmed, indirectly confirmed (*), and possible
  interactions (⋅) between various phages and immune system components. Continuous
  lines represent immune pathways and dashed lines represent pathways with intermediary
  steps not showed in this figure. (A) Innate immune cells including macrophages,
  dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes are involved in these direct interactions,
  likely through PRRs. Epithelial cells also present receptors that can sense PAMPs
  and could be involved in cytokine production derived from phage-cell interactions.
  (1) Receptors such as TLR-2/TLR-1 and TLR-1/TLR-2/TLR-6 can be involved in the recognition
  of phage particles that result in production of cytokines, via Myeloid Differentiation
  Primary Response 88 protein (MyD88) coupling and NF-κB activation. (2)  have found
  phagocyte-mediated endocytosis of a filamentous Pseudomonas phage with a subsequent
  production of TNFα dependent upon TLR-3 endosomal sensing of phage genome, through
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF) coupling and Interferon
  Regulatory Factors (IRF) activation. Endocytosis of Caudovirales phages by DCs was
  also confirmed by , (3) in which TLR-9 sensing of phage genomes results in NF-kB
  activation. (4) Phage interactions with phagocytes that result in IL-1b and IL-18
  production can be related to cytosolic phage genome detection by Absent in Melanoma
  2 (AIM2) receptor recognition, via Caspase-1 activation. (5) Production of cytokines
  in epithelial cells can also be related to TLR and AIM2 phage detection. (6) Phagocytosis
  by DCs and macrophages are likely initiated by recognition of Scavenger receptors,
  representing the first step from an innate response to an adaptative response. The
  main adaptative immunity interaction with phages has been described in the characterization
  of antibody recognition of phages. Immunoglobulins including mucus excreted IgA
  (7), circulating acute-phase IgM (free or bound to naïve B cells) (8), and circulating
  IgG (in particular IgG2) (9) can recognize some Caudovirales. (10) Phagocytosis
  by DCs can imply antigen presentation (11) to T helper (Th) and T cytotoxic (Tc)
  T cells, which has been indirectly confirmed, and can be derived from phage or bacterial-derived
  antigens (; ). (12) Specific anti-phage IgG indirectly confirms B cell activation,
  which derives in maturation of memory and secretory B cells. (13) Antibodies binding
  to phages can also result in complement system activation and antibody mediated
  phagocytosis, which in turn can explain increasing population of leukocytes derived
  from phage interaction with the immune system, and inflammation (14). As depicted
  in this figure, there is not a unique pathway to phage recognition by immune system
  components, and in various cases the complete recognition and effector pathway is
  yet to be unveiled. Figures created with Biorender.com.
