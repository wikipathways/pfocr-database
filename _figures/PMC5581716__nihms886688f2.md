caption: The ferroptosis pathway and the inducers and inhibitors of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis
  is induced by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal lipid peroxidation products
  due to the disruption of the essential cellular antioxidative defense mechanism.
  Under normal conditions, the uptake of cystine through system xc− and the subsequent
  reduction of cystine to cysteine are critical for the synthesis of the major antioxidant
  GSH. GPx4, the major enzyme that detoxifies lipid ROS, converts GSH to oxidized
  glutathione and reduces lipid peroxides to their corresponding hydroxyl derivatives.
  On the other hand, ACLS4 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4) promotes
  the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids which may be converted to phospholipids
  sensitive to oxygenation by lipoxygenases (LOX12/15). The import and export of iron
  is mediated by TfR1 and Ferroportin respectively. Changes in iron transport can
  lead to iron overload that induces ferroptosis. Excessive iron in its labile form
  can catalyze the Fenton reaction to produce free radicals or act as cofactors for
  LOXs to promote ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction to generate lipid ROS. A
  series of ferroptosis inducers has been shown to interfere with the anti-oxidant
  network at different upstream events. Erastin, Glutamate, sorafenin and lanperisone
  inhibit cytstine uptake through system xc−, BSO blocks the biosynthesis of GSH,
  and RSL3 inactivate GPx4. Ferroptosis can also be inhibited by a variety of ferroptosis
  inhibitors. CPO, DFO, Deferasirox and deferiprone inhibit ferroptosis by chelating
  irons. NDGA, Zileuton, AA861, BW A4C and PD 146176 inhibit LOX 12/15. ROSI, PIO
  and TRO, known PPARγ agonists, inhibit ACSL4 and alleviate ferroptosis independent
  of PPARγ. Ferrostatins, Liproxstatins, trolox, α-tocopherol, BHT, β-carotene and
  Ebs function as antioxidants to protect cells from ferroptosis.
