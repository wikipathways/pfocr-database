caption: The key pyroptosis and anoikis pathways in triple-negative breast cancer
  (TNBC). a Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) activates the NLR family, pyrin domain
  containing 3 (NLRP3)/procaspase-1/apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CRAD (ASC) complex, procaspase-1 is converted to caspase-1, and pyroptosis is
  induced via gasdermin D (GSDMD). In addition, caspase-11 and caspase-4/5 can also
  induce pyroptosis via GSDMD. Inhibition of mitochondrial signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation can increase reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) levels, activate bak and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) targets, activate caspase-9
  and caspase-3 in the presence of cytochrome c (Cyt-c), and ultimately promote the
  cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), to transform apoptosis into pyroptosis. In addition,
  procaspase-8 can also activate caspase-3 to induce pyroptosis via GSDME. The above
  pyroptosis will eventually cause the death of TNBC cells. b cFLIP inhibits the production
  of anoikis by inhibiting the conversion of procaspase-8/fas associated via death
  domain (FADD)/TNFRSF1A associated via death domain (TRADD) complex to caspase-8.
  After epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated, it inhibits the phosphorylation
  of Tyr705 on STAT3 and resists anoikis. EGFR and SRC/FAK activate the PI3K/Akt pathway,
  mediate late Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) degradation, activate
  myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)/B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL)/Bcl-2, reduce
  Bax/Bak activity, and inhibit the production of anoikis. SRC/FAK also activates
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, relieves the
  inhibitory effect of proteasome on Mcl-1/Bcl-xL/BCL-2, reduces the activity of Bax/Bak,
  and inhibits anoikis. In addition, caveolin-1 (cav-1) can also restore the activity
  of Mcl-1/Bcl-xL/BCL-2 and ultimately inhibit anoikis. After adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) is activated, it can reduce glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) and increase phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) and finally activate
  anoikis. In addition, the overexpression of protein kinase c theta (PRKCQ)/protein
  kinase C theta (PKCθ), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), C–C motif chemokine
  receptor 7 (CCR7) and integrin-β1 will inhibit anoikis. The production of the above
  anoikis will eventually cause the death of TNBC cells
