caption: Left, ceramide biosynthesis requires saturated fatty acids and palmitate
  in a four‐step biosynthetic pathway. Intervening in this pathway invariably improves
  insulin sensitivity in rodents. Inflammatory modulators stimulate this biosynthesis
  and/or promote the conversion of sphingomyelin back into ceramides. Adiponectin
  further modulates ceramide levels by controlling its rates of degradation. Right,
  once ceramide levels rise above a critical threshold level, they antagonize insulin
  signalling, increase lipid uptake, and inhibit lipid oxidation. These contribute
  to the tissue dysfunction that underlies metabolic disorders.
