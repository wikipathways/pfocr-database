caption: Myosin begins and ends detached from actin and with ATP bound in the contraction
  cycle. The green box with dashed line boundaries group the strong actomyosin bound
  states. Blue vector v at the end of the myosin lever-arm is positive net force on,
  and positive velocity of, the thick filament in units where amplitudes are equal.
  Fluxes through the network, fi, differ depending on contraction phases (values in
  ). Measured values for fi are in green while computed values are indicated in black.
  Four pathways cross from beginning to end of the contraction cycle. The top pathway
  populated by flux f1 executes an 8 nm step-size. The middle pathway populated by
  flux f3 executes a 3 nm step-size. It releases Pi while weakly actin bound without
  doing work. The bottom pathway populated by flux f4 is branched and executes 5 or
  5+3 nm step-sizes. The branch from the bottom pathway is populated by flux f7 and
  executes the 5+3 nm step-size. Strain sensitivity is modeled with mechanisms in
  two subpathways within the shaded regions. The upper mechanism is populated by fluxes
  f2 and f8 from the 8 and 3 nm steps when the ELC N-terminus binds actin for actomyosin
  in rigor. The taut (blue line), intermediate (green curve), and slack (red wave)
  ELC N-terminus for muscle in near-isometric, auxotonic, or unloaded phases have
  high, modest, or zero strain when net force v is zero in isometric, intermediate
  in auxotonic, or high in unloaded phase. The linear (blue) actin bound ELC N-terminus
  is proposed to inhibit ATP binding by lowering active site accessibility for ATP
  at the small arrow near the myosin head. Inhibited ATP binding extends actomyosin
  attachment time indicated by the clock icon and quantitated in our single myosin
  measurements as a 0 length step. The lower mechanism is populated by flux f6 from
  the 5 nm step with ADP bound. Near-isometric, auxotonic, or unloaded phases have
  high, intermediate, or zero strain (of an unspecified myosin element) when net force
  is zero, intermediate, or high. Strain lowers ADP release rate. Short duration ADP
  rate inhibition flux, f7, leaves to continue with the 3 nm step. Long duration ADP
  rate inhibition flux, f6 − f7, continues with the 0 length step. For either the
  ATP accessibility or ADP release rate mediated mechanisms (top or bottom strain
  sensing mechanisms), low net force inhibits myosin cycling by extending the time
  myosin is strongly actin bound by >2Δt.
