caption: Schematic representation of the parkinsonian basal ganglia motor loop, showing
  the location of group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. The loss of striatal
  dopamine innervation following substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) degeneration
  in Parkinson's disease (PD) produces opposing downstream changes in firing of the
  two main basal ganglia pathways. Thick lines indicate overactive pathways; thin
  lines indicate underactive pathways; dotted lines indicate degenerated pathways.
  In the direct pathway, loss of dopamine D1-like receptor stimulation reduces firing
  of GABAergic striatal efferents to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), while
  in the indirect pathway, loss of inhibitory D2-like receptor stimulation leads to
  increased firing in the GABAergic striatopallidal pathway, which in turn inhibits
  GABAergic drive to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), leading to increased firing of
  the glutamatergic STN efferents to the SNr and SNc. The increased glutamatergic
  innervation of the SNr ultimately drives inhibition of thalamocortical feedback,
  resulting in the motor deficits seen in PD, while the increased glutamatergic innervation
  in the SNc may contribute to the progressive SNc degeneration. Group III mGlu receptors
  (mGlu4, 7 or 8), indicated by black stars, are found on pre-synaptic terminals of
  intrinsic basal ganglia pathways where their activation may serve to restrict transmitter
  release. Receptor subtypes indicated in bold have been confirmed as functional,
  while those in red have been shown to lack function. DA, dopamine; Glut, glutamate.
