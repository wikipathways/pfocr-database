caption: 'Antagonism of interferon induction by Paramyxoviriade. Once activated, MDA5
  and RIG-I proteins undergo large conformational changes leading to the interaction
  with the mitochondrial associated signaling protein (MAVS also known as IPS-, VISA,
  or CARDIF) through their caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which
  in turn leads to activation of a kinase complex composed in part of TBK-1 and IKK-ε
  that phosphorylates a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor interferon regulatory
  factor-3 (IRF-3). After homo-dimerization, IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus where
  it associates with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activates transcription factor
  2 (ATF2/c-jun) to drive IFN gene transcription. TLRs sensors activate distinct pathways,
  but converge with RLR, in phosphorylating IRF-3 or IRF-7, as well as nuclear factor
  κB (NF-κB), causing their translocation into the nucleus to activate the transcription
  of early type I IFNs (IFNβ and IFNα). Most of the paramyxoviruses are able to neutralize
  the IFN induction pathway by targeting most of the transcription factors involved
  in it. Most of V proteins from paramyxovirus are represented in red, interacting
  with IFN induction transcription factors represented in light gray, while the viruses
  are represented in green with yellow or black spikes. LPMV V: La Piedad Michoacán
