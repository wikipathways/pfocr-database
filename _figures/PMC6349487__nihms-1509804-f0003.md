caption: TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 regulate a robust immune response following HSV-1 infection.
  TLR2 resides on the cell surface and recognizes viral proteins. TLR2 signals through
  a myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) or toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain
  containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)-dependent cascade, resulting in the recruitment
  of IR-1R-associated protein kinase (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor 6
  (TRAF6), both of which are upstream of the IKK complex and NF-κB. TLR9 is expressed
  in the endosome and recognizes the virus by rich CpG sequences and signal through
  MyD88-dependent pathway that induce NF-κB activation. TLR3 is also expressed in
  the endosome and recognizes dsRNA. TLR3 signals through MyD88-dependent pathway,
  activating NF-κB, as well as TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF), which is upstream of TBK-1, and leads to the activation of IRF-3.
