caption: Model of the TAA biosynthetic pathway in B. thuringiensis. The TCA cycle
  synthesizes CAA through citric acid dehydration by ACO (gray). Instead of further
  hydration to isocitric acid by ACO, a portion of CAA is isomerized into TAA by aconitate
  isomerase TbrA (pink), which catalyzes the reversible reaction from CAA to TAA but
  favors the equilibrium for TAA, as indicated by the thicker black arrow. Intracellular
  TAA is then transported outside cells by the membrane-anchored TbrB protein (yellow),
  resulting in extracellular accumulation of TAA.
