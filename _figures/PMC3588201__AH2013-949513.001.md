caption: Gene regulatory networks for cDC and pDC development. Shared gene regulation
  patterns in (a) and (b). PU.1 upregulates many factors important for DC development,
  including Id2, GM-CSFR, and Flt3L [, ]. The Flt3 pathway phosphorylates STAT3, which
  can upregulate/downregulate target genes []. (a) Gene regulation in cDCs. Id2 expression
  inhibits E2-2 via protein interaction. GM-CSFR phosphorylates STAT5, which can inhibit
  IRF-8 expression []. Batf3 upregulates E4BP4 []. Batf expression in CD8+ cDCs compensates
  for a lack of Batf3 []. E4BP4 negatively modulates IRF-4 expression []. (b) Gene
  regulation in pDCs. Ikaros upregulates Gfi1 [], which can inhibit Id2 expression
  [], allowing for E2-2 function. E2-2 binds to the promoter of Spi-B, IRF-7, and
  IRF-8 to upregulate gene expression []. A yet unidentified mechanism prevents the
  downstream events of GM-CSFR in pDCs, since STAT5 has been shown to downregulate
  IRF-8, which is required for pDC development. Proven interactions are indicated
  in solid bars. Hypothesized interactions are shown in dashed lines.
