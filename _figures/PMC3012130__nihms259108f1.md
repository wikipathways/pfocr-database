caption: Regulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the β-cell. Illustrated
  are the “triggering” and “amplification” pathways by which glucose metabolism leads
  to insulin secretion (). Also illustrated are the multiple signal transduction pathways
  by which GLP-1 influences β-cell function. Uptake of glucose is mediated by the
  type 2 facilitative glucose transporter (Glut2), and aerobic glycolysis produces
  an increase of cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] concentration ratio. This metabolic signal
  leads to the inhibition of KATP channels, thereby initiating membrane depolarization
  (ΔVm), activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), Ca2+ influx, and a
  stimulation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (triggering pathway). The opening of K+
  channels (e.g., Ca2+-activated K+ channels; K-Ca) terminates Ca2+ influx by repolarizing
  the membrane. Metabolism of glucose also generates metabolic coupling factors that
  act directly at the secretory granules to facilitate their exocytosis (amplification
  pathway). The function of the triggering and amplification pathways is potentiated
  by GLP-1 via its effects on glucose-dependent ATP production (), KATP channels (),
  VDCCs (), intracellular Ca2+ stores (), voltage-dependent K+ channels (), and insulin
  granule transport or priming (,).
