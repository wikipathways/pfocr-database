caption: MicroRNA induced by FSH at spermiogenesis. A microRNA network superimposes
  on the protein network induced by FSH. Here are shown some microRNAs whose expression
  is altered upon in vivo FSH suppression, i.e., miR-23b, miR-30c and miR-30d, mir-20a
  and miR-217, as reported in Nicholls et al. (). miR-30c and miR-30d target the IGF-1
  system, as well as the PI3K pathway. According to Khan et al. (), PI3K is activated
  directly by FSH in the prepubertal rat, and indirectly, through the IGF1-R, in the
  neonate. miR-23b could impair the post-transcriptional regulation of PTEN induced
  by FSH (Dupont et al., ), and could potentially target Cyclin D1. Whether FSH regulates
  Cyclin D1 at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level is not known yet.
