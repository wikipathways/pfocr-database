caption: Cells and neurons respond to the presence of misfolded proteins by activating
  heat shock transcription factor (HSF1), which regulates the levels and functions
  of molecular chaperones (including Hsp70) and co-chaperone systems such as the heat
  shock response (HR). Hsp70 recognizes and binds misfolded proteins, assisting in
  refolding or disaggregating oligomers. Accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates
  in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) also induces ER stress, which subsequently
  engages the adaptive stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR).
  For example, one of the three components of UPR, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1),
  catalyzes the synthesis of transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1),
  which in turn controls a subset of UPR genes related to protein folding, translocation,
  and degradation. The two degradation systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
  and the autophagy-lysosomal system, are responsible for the degradation of diverse
  protein substrates. Nascent polypeptides can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the
  proteasome via a process known as co-translational ubiquitination (CTU). Protein
  aggregates can be further deposited into aggresomes via dynein-dependent retrograde
  transport along the microtubule network. Autophagy is the primary pathway for the
  clearance of protein aggregates or aggresomes. Protein aggregates, which are recognized
  by autophagy receptors (AR), are sequestered within autophagosomes, which are then
  fused with endosomes to form amphisomes, and delivered to lysosomes for degradation.
  However, the intracellular protein aggregates (or fibrils) can also be secreted
  outside of the cells or neurons via exosomes that are derived from multi-vesicular
  bodies (MVB). In addition, an unconventional secretory pathway (CUPS) associated
  with autophagosomes (APG) or amphisomes may provide an alternative path for extracellular
  release of protein fibrils (exophagy).
