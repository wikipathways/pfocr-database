caption: A model for plant Pi signaling involving PHO2, miR399, and PHR1. Expression
  of a subset of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes, including the Pi transporter
  genes Pht1;8 and Pht1;9, is regulated through the UBC protein PHO2. Expression of
  PHO2 is regulated by miR399 species, which in turn require PHR1 for induction. PHR1
  is also important for PHO2-independent expression of other PSI genes, and SIZ1-dependent
  sumoylation might be required for PHR1 activity. Other parts of the transcriptional
  response of plants to Pi deprivation might be PHR1 independent (dashed arrows).
  The inset illustrates the hypothesis that miR399 might serve as a mobile signal
  allowing coordinated responses to Pi stress between different parts of the plant.
