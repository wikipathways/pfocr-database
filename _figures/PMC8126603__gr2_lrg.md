caption: Innate immune antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 proteinsCoronavirus replication occurs
  in double-membraned vesicles (DMVs), which can shield viral RNA (ssRNA and dsRNA)
  from recognition by PRRs such as TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5. These PRRs activate
  adaptors TRIF and MyD88 downstream of TLRs, and MAVS and TBK1 downstream of RIG-I
  and MDA5 beginning at the interferon production pathway. Activation of IRF3, IRF7,
  or NFκB results in their nuclear translocation and in the transcriptional activation
  of immune genes including inflammatory cytokines and IFN. The dotted line represents
  the transition to IFN signaling beginning with IFN-I binding IFNAR to initiate JAK/STAT
  signaling and formation of the ISGF3 complex STAT1/STAT2/IRF9, which translocates
  into the nucleus to activate ISRE transcription. SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins (red)
  inhibit multiple aspects of these pathways, resulting in decreased IFN and altered
  proinflammatory cytokine expression. Many of the SARS-CoV-2 IFN antagonists have
  been identified by overexpression assays in vitro, and thus await in vivo confirmation
  of their role in the virus’s replication and pathogenesis (black).
