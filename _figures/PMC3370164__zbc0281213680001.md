caption: Pathways of serine metabolism in mammals. The pathways for the synthesis
  and metabolic fate of serine are shown. The intermediates in the pathways shown
  in blue are involved in the synthesis of serine, either from glucose via glycolysis
  or from the triose phosphate pool, where carbon is generated from citric acid cycle
  intermediates. The latter pathway involves PEPCK (step 1), which is a major cataplerotic
  enzyme in the synthesis of serine. The conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxypyruvate
  is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (step 2). The final
  steps in the synthesis of serine involve the transamination of phosphohydroxypyruvate
  to l-phosphoserine (step 3) and the conversion of l-phosphoserine into serine by
  phosphoserine phosphatase (step 4). The pathway involved in methyl group transfer
  is shown by the red arrows, and the transsulfuration pathway is shown in orange.
  OAA, oxalacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; MS, methionine synthase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine;
  SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; CβS, cystathionine β-synthase; CγL, cystathionine γ-lyase.
