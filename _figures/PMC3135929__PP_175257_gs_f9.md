caption: Working hypothesis of the CAX1/CAX3-mediated Pisignaling pathway in Arabidopsis.
  When Pi is limited, repression of shoot CAX1 leads to abrogated cellular Ca2+ homeostasis
  involving altered [Ca2+]cyt and/or misregulated compartmentation of Ca2+, which
  initiates the activation of a subset of shoot PSR genes. A shoot-born signal (X)
  is thereby generated and moves toward the root to activate the Pi transporter system,
  including PHT1;1, at the posttranslational level.
