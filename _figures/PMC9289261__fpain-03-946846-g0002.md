caption: Interactions between the distal part of nociceptors with different immune
  cells. When injury and infection happen, macrophages are induced to produce DAMP
  and PAMP. They activate TLRs expressed in nociceptive neurons and up-regulate the
  expression of MyD88, which promotes the MAPK signaling pathway through NF-κB. MyD88
  also activates sodium channels in sensory neurons, increasing the excitability of
  the nociceptors. T cells release IL-4 to activate B cells, which produce CRPSI IgM
  and IgG. CRPS IgM, binding to the corresponding neoantigens. The antigen-IgM complex
  promotes complements (e.g., C5a), leading to increased expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and peripheral sensitization.
