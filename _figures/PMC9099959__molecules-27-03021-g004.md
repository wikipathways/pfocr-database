caption: Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) activity in response
  to DNA damage. Double-stranded breaks in DNA activate the ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) kinase and Rad3-related protein (ATR) that subsequently phosphorylate
  checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). The ATR/ATM-mediated
  phosphorylation pathway phosphorylates the BRCA1 protein and activates proteins
  involved in DNA damage repair and apoptosis. The binding of toxic compounds or AhR
  ligands leads to the suppression of the BRCA1 promoter activity, ultimately leading
  to increased cellular toxicity via DNA repair dysfunction and cell cycle checkpoint
  disregulation. Our pipeline selected BRCA1 as important for predicting AhR toxicity,
  along with other proteins such as RNF8, UBE2N, RAP80, NSD2, and RPA1, implying that
  compounds are known to induce this phenotype possibly via the modulation of proteins
  directly involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.
