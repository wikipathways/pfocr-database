caption: Overview of the Notch transduction pathway. (A) A newly produced Notch molecule
  undergoes a first cleavage by PC5/furin and then attaches to the cell membrane as
  a transmembrane receptor. (B) The Notch transmembrane receptor binds to a ligand
  at the surface of a neighbor cell. (C) Pulling forces originated in both cells expose
  the Negative Regulatory Region (NRR) of the receptor, hence enabling a cleavage
  by ADAM. (D) Afterward, the receptor undergoes two successive cleavages by γ-secretase,
  thus leading to the release the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) in the cytoplasm.
  (E) NICD is transported to the cell nucleus. (F) NICD transcriptionally regulates
  several target genes in cooperation with other co-activators such as CSL and Mastermind
  (Mam).
