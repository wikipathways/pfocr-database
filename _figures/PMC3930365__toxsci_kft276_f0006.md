caption: Second ranked network of genes altered in the newborn lung at 24h post-O3
  exposure. The gene network was generated with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software
  using dataset of genes significantly altered by at least 1.5-fold (FDR, q < .05).
  This network has a score of 30 and contained 15 focus genes, all down-regulated
  by 24h after O3 exposure.
