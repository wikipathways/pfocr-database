caption: High-confidence mutually exclusive gene sets identified from real data analysis.
  MEScan was applied to identify high-confidence mutually exclusive gene sets based
  on (A) TCGA glioblastoma (n=290); (B) TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma (n=174);
  (C) TCGA ovarian cancer (n=314); and (D) TCGA pan-cancer datasets (n=3205). One
  selected high-confidence mutually exclusive gene set from each dataset was presented
  in this figure. A full list of identified high-confidence gene sets is provided
  in . Pathway diagrams in the figure were generated by using PathwayMapper ()
