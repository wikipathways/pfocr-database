caption: Macroautophagy is regulated by several signalling pathways. Macroautophagy
  is regulated by the mTOR pathway. The protein Ragulator in complex with v-ATPase
  and Rag can sense the level of intracellular amino acids. Under nutrient-rich condition,
  Ragulator activates RHEB, which activates mTORC1 composed of mTOR, PRAS40, mLST8
  and Deptor. mTORC1 activation prevents macroautophagy initiation. mTOR can also
  be indirectly stimulated by insulin and other growth factors. The interaction of
  the latter with their receptors activates the PI3KCI/AKT axis relieving RHEB inhibition
  by TSC1/TSC2. RHEB can then activate mTORC1 and inhibit macroautophagy activation.
  The energetic level of the cell can be sensed by AMPK complex activated upon low
  ATP/AMP ratio. AMPK then activates TSC1/TSC2 and inhibits RHEB. In consequence,
  mTORC1 is inhibited thus favouring macroautophagy initiation. Macroautophagy is
  activated through the JNK1/Bcl-2/Beclin-1 pathway. Upon nutrient starvation, NOS
  activity, the kinase JNK1 is activated. The activation of JNK1 allows the dissociation
  of Bcl-2 and Beclin-1 and then permits the association of Beclin-1 with PI3KCIII
  and initiation of macroautophagy. IP3 and intracellular calcium regulate macroautophagy
  activity. Activation of AC, for example, downstream GPCR signalling, leads to the
  production of cAMP that will activate PLCε and then to the production of IP3 from
  phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate PIP2. IP3 can further be transformed into inositol
  and then back to PIP2. cAMP level increase can also be induced after inhibition
  of imidazoline 1 receptors. Binding of IP3 to its receptor expressed at the surface
  of ER leads to the release of Ca2+ stores. Both intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ imported
  from the extracellular milieu can activate calpain that will further lead to the
  production of cAMP. Calpain activity, high IP3 and inositol intracellular levels
  inhibit macroautophagy initiation. High Ca2+ levels have been shown to block phagosome–lysosome
  fusion, thereby preventing macroautophagy flux.
