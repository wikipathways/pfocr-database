caption: Diagram depicting the mechanism by which NGF may inhibit GSK-3β and promote
  axon growth. The binding of NGF to p75 activate CK2 via an unknown process. Activated
  CK2 phosphorylates PTEN phosphatase, thus rendering it inactive and unable to hydrolyze
  PI3P. A high concentration of this secondary messenger phosphorylates and activates
  Akt/PKB, which phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3β. The better known pathway to increase
  PI(3)P concentrations consists of stimulating its synthesis by activating PI-3 kinase.
  Such activation is carried out by ligand activated protein kinase receptors such
  Trks, although it is unclear whether NGF uses this pathway in hippocampal neurons.
