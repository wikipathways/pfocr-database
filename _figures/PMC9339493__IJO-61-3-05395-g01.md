caption: Several signaling pathways are closely related to STAT3. The canonical STAT3
  signaling pathway is the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which can receive signals from cytokines
  or growth factors and transmits these signals to the nucleus to regulate downstream
  genes. Additionally, the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 pathways play a role in modifying the phosphorylation
  of STAT3. Wnt1 can inactivate the destruction complex for β-catenin transfer into
  the nucleus and form a complex with TCF-4, through binding of the TBE to the promoter
  region of STAT3, thereby increasing the transcription of STAT3. Wnt2/FZD2 phosphorylate
  STAT3 directly at Tyr705 to activate STAT3 signaling. STAT3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; COX2, cyclooxygenase-2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; TCF-4,
  T-cell factor-4; TBE, TCF-4 binding element.
