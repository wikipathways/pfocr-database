caption: Proposed model of IGFBP-3 modulation of growth factor receptor activation
  mediated by S1P. IGFBP-3 up-regulates SphK1, leading to increased S1P production.
  S1P binds and activates S1P1 and/or S1P3, resulting in transactivation EGFR, which
  in turn activates IGFR1. The process can be initiated by either endogenous or exogenous
  IGFBP-3. Experimental interventions (inhibitors or siRNAs) that support this proposed
  pathway are indicated.
