caption: The signaling network of astrocyte-synapse interactions. (A) A simplified
  scheme of the different signaling pathways between synaptic terminals and astrocytes
  for the case of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus (see text for a detailed
  description). Action potentials arriving at the presynaptic terminal trigger release
  of glutamate, which can spill over from the synaptic cleft. Perisynaptic astrocytes
  take up glutamate using their plasma membrane transporters (EAATs) while glutamate,
  by acting on astrocytic metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), triggers Ca2+signaling
  in the astrocyte. This signaling pathway includes production of IP3 and causes an
  increase of cytosolic Ca2+ due to efflux of this ion from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). At some synapses, such as in the dentate gyrus, the same Ca2+signaling pathway
  could also be mediated by astrocytic purinergic P2Y1 receptors, likely activated
  by synaptically-released ATP (see text for details). Astrocytic Ca2+ excitability
  can in turn lead to exocytotic release of several neuroactive substances (or “gliotransmitters”)
  such as glutamate (Glu), D-serine (D-ser) or ATP which can target specific receptors
  on pre- and post-synaptic terminals and differentially modulate synaptic transmission.
  Glutamate acting on presynaptic GluRs could enhance synaptic release, whereas ATP
  and its derivate adenosine (Adn) could depress it (red path) through presynaptic
  purinergic receptors (PRs). On the postsynaptic spines [depicted here by a standard
  RC circuit (Ermentrout and Terman, )], the ensuing effect of gliotransmitters could
  substantially modify postsynaptic currents by enhancing activation of NMDA receptors
  (D-serine) or by altering expressions of AMPA receptors therein. Astrocytes could
  also release TNFα by Ca2+-dependent activation of the matrix metalloprotease TNFα-converting
  enzyme (TACE), while extracellular TNFα could in turn regulate glutamate release
  from the astrocyte as well as postsynaptic AMPAR expression. Moreover astrocytic
  Ca2+ could also propagate across different regions of the same cell or to other
  neighboring astrocytes by intracellular IP3 diffusion through gap junction channels
  (GJCs) or via extracellular ATP-dependent pathways, extending gliotransmission to
  some distal sites away from the considered synapse. For clarity both endocannabinoid-mediated
  Ca2+signaling (Navarrete and Araque, ), retrograde activation of presynaptic glutamate
  receptors (Navarrete and Araque, ), regulation of postsynaptic NMDARs by presynaptic
  adenosine receptors (Deng et al., ), and the possibility for astrocyte-derived adenosine
  to enhance synaptic release (Panatier et al., ) are not included in this scheme.
  (B) Equivalent modeling scheme for astrocyte-synapse interactions. The astrocyte
  (ASTRO) constitutes a third active element of the tripartite synapse in addition
  to the presynaptic (PRE) and postsynaptic (POST) terminals. In its presence, the
  flow of input (IN) signals to the output (OUT) is no more unidirectional but presynaptically
  released neurotransmitter can affect astrocyte function through the interaction
  pathway A. In turn, the astrocyte can regulate both synaptic terminals via pathways
  B and C. In addition, the astrocyte could receive additional inputs from or send
  output to remote synapses in a heterosynaptic fashion (I/O).
