caption: The canonical NF-κB pathway (left) induced by signals including antigens,
  TLR ligands and cytokines such as TNF uses a wide variety of signaling adaptors
  to engage and activate the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex. IKKβ phosphorylation
  of IκB proteins bound to NF-κB dimers results in ubiquitination (Ub) of IκB and
  proteasome-induced degradation. This allows NF-κB to enter the nucleus and be involved
  in controlling the transcription of gene encoding functions as diverse as inflammation,
  cell survival and cell division. The noncanonical pathway (right) engaged in by
  members of the TNF-like family of cytokines requires NIK to activate IKKα, which
  then phosphorylates p100 (NF-κB2), triggering its proteosomal processing needed
  for the activation of p52-RelB dimers. Among its functions, this specific NF-κB
  heterodimer controls gene expression crucial for lymphoid organogenesis.
