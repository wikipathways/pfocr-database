caption: The MAPK/ERK pathway is required for JCPyV infection in primary and immortalized
  astrocytes but may activate additional pathways in primary astrocytes, specifically
  pathways involved in the immune response and facilitated by the transcription factor,
  JUNB, and other members to form the AP-1 complex. This may result in the inhibition
  and the delay of JCPyV infection observed in NHAs compared to immortalized astrocytes
  [].
