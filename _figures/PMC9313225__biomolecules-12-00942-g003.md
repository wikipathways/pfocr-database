caption: 'Anti-platelet therapies for AAA in the preclinical stage. Adhesion proteins/receptors
  on the surface of platelets that can bind to other cells or the extracellular matrix
  include the integrin family (e.g., α2β1, αIIbβ3), the immunoglobulin superfamily
  (e.g., GPVI), the leucinerich repeat family (e.g., GPIb-IX-V complex), the G-proteincoupled
  receptors (PAR-1, PAR-4, P2Y1, P2Y12, and TxA2), and the C-type lectin receptor
  family (e.g., P-selectin). Some of these receptors are involved in the progression
  of AAA, while others remain unexplored. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1,
  blocks TxA2 production in platelets, and decreases platelet aggregation. P2Y12 receptors
  are crucial for the platelet activation potentiated by agonists, including ADP,
  collagen, vWF, and TxA2. P2Y12 receptor antagonists, such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor,
  inhibit platelet activation by irreversibly binding to P2Y12 receptors and blocking
  the ADP-dependent pathway. Integrin αIIbβ3 is expressed at high levels in platelets.
  Upon agonist stimulation, it switches from a low- to high-affinity state for fibrinogen
  and other ligands, leading to integrin clustering and activating outside-in signaling,
  which drives platelet aggregation and thrombus consolidation. The illustration elements
  are from Biorender (https://biorender.com/) (accessed on 30 June 2022; Agreement
