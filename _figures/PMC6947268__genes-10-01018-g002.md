caption: Graphical overview of interplays between PHR-like TFs and other cellular
  components under Pi scarcity in plant cells updated with current knowledge obtained
  from extensive research in Arabidopsis and rice. PHR1 TF represents both AtPHR1
  and its rice orthologue OsPHR2. Under sufficient phosphate levels (+P), various
  inositol pyrophosphate isomers (PP-InsPs, depicted as yellow dots of different sizes)
  are biosynthesized to mimic the cellular Pi status. In the presence of Pi and ATP,
  InsP8 messenger molecules are generated by the activity of kinase domain within
  VIH1/2 enzymes. Such PP-InsPs isomers (InsP6, InsP7, InsP8) compete to bind to the
  SPX-domain containing proteins, followed by direct inhibition of AtPHR1/OsPHR2 nucleo-cytoplasmic
  shuttling. This leads to no activation of PSI genes. When the Pi level turns down,
  the protein level of specific E3 ligases, such as SPX4 degradation E3 ligases 1
  or 2 (SDEL1, SDEL2), increases to target SPX-domain containing proteins for proteasomal
  degradation pathway. NRT1.1B is transcriptionally induced by high nitrate (N) or
  repressed by low-Pi, where NBIP1 gene is upregulated by both low-Pi and high-N.
  The nitrate transporter 1.1B (NRT1.1B) trans-membrane nitrate sensor mediates nitrate-triggered
  SPX4 degradation with NBIP1 E3 ligase in phosphate signaling upon N sufficient conditions.
  Upon low-Pi, the PHR-like TFs are more preferentially localized in the nucleus and
  their structure is stabilized by SUMOylation conducted via SIZ1 activity. The PHR-like
  TFs, as either homo- or heterodimers, can regulate the transcript level of PSI genes
  by binding to the P1BS motifs present in the gene 5′-UTR or promoter regions. Green
  and red arrows indicate up- and down-regulation of gene expression, respectively.
