caption: Surgical trauma stimulates the peripheral inflammatory response and immune
  activation. Injury-related pattern molecules dominated by HMGB1 recruit and activate
  peripheral immune cells and also promote the synthesis and release of a variety
  of inflammatory factors. Many inflammatory factors can be positively fed back to
  the secretion pathway for HMGB1 to induce and maintain the peripheral inflammatory
  response. Peripheral inflammation can spread to the central nervous system through
  several pathways [(1) Periventricular area; (2) Specific transporter; (3) TNF-α;
  (4) Homoreceptor; (5) Vagal nerve; and (6) Gut-brain axis], leading to central neuroinflammation
  and ultimately cognitive dysfunction. The two-way communication between the gut
  microbiome and the brain, termed the “gut-brain axis,” is involved in brain function
  and cognitive regulation.
