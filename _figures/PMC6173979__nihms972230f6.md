caption: The Rra1 protein is embedded in the plasma membrane through its core seven
  transmembrane domains. At pH 4, the plasma membrane is composed of asymmetrically
  distributed phospholipids, and the Rra1 C-terminus associates closely with the inner
  leaflet of the plasma membrane. At pH 8, the Rra1 C-terminus disassociates from
  the membrane in response to a transient loss of bilayer asymmetry (more symmetrical
  membrane portrayed to the right of the Cdc50 protein). The normal membrane asymmetry
  is actively restored by the Cdc50/Apt1 lipid flippase complex (restored asymmetrical
  membrane portrayed to the left of the Cdc50 protein). The differential membrane
  association of the Rra1 C-terminal tail results in pH-dependent activation of the
  Rim pathway and potential subsequent endocytosis of the pH sensor.
