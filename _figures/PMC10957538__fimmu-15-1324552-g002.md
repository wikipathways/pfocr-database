caption: 'Epithelial plasticity and impact of particulate matter (PM): Exposure to
  PM in short term, leads to inhibition of Notch1 by stimulating STAT3 and aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) activation in basal epithelial cells. Decreased Notch1 activation
  leads to differentiation of progenitor/stem cells into ciliated cells. Conversely,
  longer PM exposure results in increased expression and activation of Notch1/2/3,
  which induce basal progenitor cells to differentiate into secretory and mucus-producing
  cells. In areas where there are fewer basal cells, Notch activation stimulates SCG1A1+
  club cells to differentiate to goblet cells. Smaller PM ( ≤2.5µM) reaching the alveoli
  stimulates the proliferation of alveolar type (AT) 2 cells, and induces the differentiation
  of these cells to myofibroblasts, while preventing their differentiation into AT1
  cells. In case of chronic exposure, PM activates the TGF-β-NFκB and Wnt/B-catenin
  pathways. These pathways activate the Twist, Snail, and Zeb transcription factor
  module, initiating a process called dysregulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT). During EMT, there are noticeable changes in apical-basal polarity, migration
  of epithelial cells from the epithelial sheet, increases in the expression of MMP-2,
  8, and 9. E-cadherin, occludin, claudin and zonula ocludens-1 show a decreasing
  pattern of change, while mesenchymal cell markers such as N-cadherin, Vimentin,
  and α-SMA increase'
