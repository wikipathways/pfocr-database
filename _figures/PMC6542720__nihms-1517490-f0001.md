caption: 'The human heme biosynthetic pathway in hepatocytes (left) and erythroid
  cells (right). The eight enzymatic steps, their porphyrin precursor and porphyrin
  substrates, and metabolic products are shown. Note that the first enzyme in the
  pathway in hepatocytes, ALAS1 is regulated by negative feedback, repression by the
  concentration of the end product heme in the free heme pool. In contrast, the erythroid-specific
  ALAS2 enzyme is responsible for synthesis of 5’Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the
  erythron and its expression is under control of erythroid regulatory elements. The
  subsequent enzymatic steps in the pathway are similar, some of the enzymes having
  unique housekeeping and erythroid specific promoters. Modified from Anderson et
  al.: Disorders of heme biosynthesis: X-Linked sideroblastic anemia and the Porphyrias.
