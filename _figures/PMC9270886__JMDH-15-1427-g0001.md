caption: The fibrinolytic pathway is altered in cancer surgery. Cancer cells can interefere
  with the fibrinolysis by increasing the fibrinolytic activity through the expression
  on their cell surface of different tissue plasminogen activator factors. They can
  also induce the production of factors that limit the lysis of the blood clot. Hyperfibrinolysis
  is triggered by surgery. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic reversible competitive
  inhibitor to the lysine receptor found on plasminogen. The binding of this receptor
  inhibits plasmin activation and delays natural fibrinolysis. TXA can also excert
  an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the activation of monocytes and neutrophiles;
  it reduces the complement activation and, probably, could have an anticancer effect.
