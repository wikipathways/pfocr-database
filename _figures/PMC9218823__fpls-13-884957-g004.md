caption: Transcript profiling of genes related to the flavonoid synthesis pathway
  with different flower colors (SbP, SbPR, and SbW). The core schematic illustration
  of flavonoid synthesis in S. baicalensis flowers was constructed according to KEGG
  pathway analysis and published literature [(A) SbP vs. SbW; (B) SbP vs. SbPR; (C)
  SbPR vs. SbW). The annotated flavonoid synthesis genes and the candidate genes for
  regulating anthocyanins synthesis in S. baicalensis flowers are shown in the figure
  with different colors. The grids with color-scale from dark to light indicate RPKM
  values; red and blue represent high and low abundances, respectively. Red or dark
  solid circles represent the log2 fold change in metabolites contents between three
  groups (SbP vs. SbPR, SbPR vs. SbW, or SbP vs. SbW). ANS, Anthocyanidin synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerise; CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, dihydroflflavonol 4-reductase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid-3′,5′-hydroxylase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FNS, flavone
  synthase; GT, UDP-glucosyltransferase.
