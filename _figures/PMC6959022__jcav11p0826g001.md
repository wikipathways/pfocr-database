caption: The plasmin is produced when S100A10 (P11) combines to plasminogen and (or)
  plasminogen activator, and the plasmin can promote the transformation of pro-MMPs
  to MMPs, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. Both the plasmin and MMPs collectively promote
  the tumor progression, including invasion and metastasis. Ras oncogene activates
  S100A10 expression which activates plasminogen to generate plasmin, and upregulates
  expression level of plasmin, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which depends on S100A10. DLC1 can
  competitively combine to S100A10 with annexinA2 (P36), resulting in the separation
  of P11 and P36 and consequent the ubiquitination degradation of P11, which inhibits
  tumor progression. S100A10 is associated with depression-like symptoms through affecting
  the location of 5-HT1B receptor on the cell surface. RAS can increase the transcription
  of S100A10 through its signaling pathway, resulting in increased expression of S100A10
  and consequent generation of plasmin.
