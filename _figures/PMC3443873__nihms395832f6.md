caption: Schematic diagram of cell growth inhibition induced by MCC-555 in human pancreatic
  cancer cells. MCC-555 inhibits cell growth via multiple pathways. In addition to
  Cyclin D1 down-regulation via the PPARγ-dependent pathway, KLF4 is up-regulated
  via the PPARγ-independent pathway that is responsible for the MCC-555-induced NAG-1
  and p21 expression, leading to cell growth inhibition in human pancreatic cancer
  cells.

  response in pancreatic cancer cells by PPARgamma-independent up-regulation of KLF4.
