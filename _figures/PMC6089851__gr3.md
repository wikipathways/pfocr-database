caption: Activation and feedback regulation of the MAPK pathway. The classical MAPK
  pathway is activated in human tumors by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
  or by mutations in RAS, BRAF, and MEK1. RTKs activate RAS by recruiting adaptor
  proteins (e.g., GRB-2) and exchange factors (e.g., SOS). RAS activation promotes
  the formation of RAF dimers, which activate MEK-ERK cascade through phosphorylation.
  ERK pathway activity is regulated by negative feedback at multiple levels, including
  the transcriptional activation of DUSP proteins that negatively regulate the pathway.
  ERK also phosphorylates and thus regulates CRAF and MEK activity directly. ERK,
  or its immediate substrate RSK, also phosphorylates SOS at several residues, inhibiting
  its activity and thus negatively regulating RAS activity.
