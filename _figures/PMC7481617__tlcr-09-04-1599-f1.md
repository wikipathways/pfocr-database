caption: 'Estrogen receptor (ER) and pan-HER signaling inhibition has synergistic
  activity and leads to gene expression changes associated with good prognosis in
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the discussed report, the authors demonstrate
  that fulvestrant and dacomitinib, a pan-HER family inhibitor, has synergistic activity
  in NSCLC including tumors without effective therapies such as those with KRAS mutations.
  Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that single-agent fulvestrant or dacomitinib
  led to upregulation of the other pathway. ER upregulates HER signaling through increasing
  expression of HER ligands, while it remains largely unclear how ER expression is
  upregulated by HER signaling. This reciprocal upregulation was prevented with combination
  therapy. The activity of this combination was associated with downregulation of
  the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)
  transcription factors and reversal of a seven-gene signature previously implicated
  in poor prognosis in NSCLC. Future studies are needed to determine whether there
  are additional molecular targets of this combination, which genes/pathways are required
  for activity of the combination, and the mechanisms by which this combination leads
  to synergistic activity in NSCLC. A portion of this figure was created using modified
