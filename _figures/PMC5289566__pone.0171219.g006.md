caption: Hb redox reactions cause lipid peroxidation that leads to release of uncontained
  nucleic acids from either necrotic cell death or excision of damaged mitochondrial
  (mt) DNA. Uncontained nucleic acid CpG motifs from necrotic cells are capable of
  activating TLR9 on adjacent endothelial cells after being endocytosed. Alternatively,
  endothelial cell TLR9 activation may occur autogenously in endothelial cells from
  damaged mt DNA. TLR9 activation upregulates IL-6 that induces a pro-growth, pro-migration
  smooth muscle cell phenotype contributing to pulmonary vascular disease.

  activity resulting in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell activation.
