caption: Changes in major metabolic pathways in Boju plants after 9 days of Indole-3-Acetic
  Acid (IAA) treatment. Differentially expressed genes and metabolites involved under
  IAA treatment in (a) amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, (b) phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis, and (c) pyruvate metabolism. Pink ovals represent differentially expressed
  metabolites (DEMs) with altered content, while white ovals represent DEMS with unchanged
  content. Blue boxes indicate enzymes encoded by differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
  The color of the rectangles indicates the changes in the expression levels of these
  DEGs or DEMS under IAA treatment, as shown in the scale bar
