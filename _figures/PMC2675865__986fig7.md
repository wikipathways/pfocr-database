caption: Bile acids and FGF19 increase stability of hepatic SHP by inhibiting ubiquitin–proteasomal
  degradation and activating ERK pathway. SHP is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasomal
  pathway with a half-life <30 min. Bile acids not only increase SHP gene induction
  by activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR, but also substantially increase
  SHP stability by activating ERK and inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Treatment
  with a primary bile acid, CDCA, increases phosphorylation of SHP at Ser26 and inhibits
  ubiquitination at Lys122/Lys123, which results in increased SHP stability. Bile
  acid-induced intestinal FGF19 predominantly increases SHP stability, with little
  effect on SHP gene induction, by activating ERK and inhibiting ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation.
