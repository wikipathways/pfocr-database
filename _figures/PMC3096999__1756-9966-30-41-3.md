caption: Schematic representation of RWPs-induced apoptosis involving p73 and  UHRF1
  deregulation in Jurkat cells and in an in vivo colorectal cancer model.  A. Schematic
  representation of RWPs-induced apoptosis involving p73 and UHRF1 deregulation in
  Jurkat cells. RWPs triggers production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and putatively
  DNA damage. The activation of the p73 gene results in enhanced caspase 3 level inducing
  UHRF1 decrease with subsequent G1/S arrest and apoptosis. B. The pathway involved
  in vivo is similar to that observed in Jurkat cells by involving a down-regulation
  of UHRF1 with subsequent increase of p16INK4A gene expression. The down-regulation
  of UHRF1 is probably driven by p53 and/or p53. This is leading to an inhibition
  of tumor vascularization as a consequence of the down-regulation of the VEGF gene
  expression.
