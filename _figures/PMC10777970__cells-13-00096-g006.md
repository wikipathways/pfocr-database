caption: Selected drug (chemotherapy) resistance mechanisms. The ECM-related factors,
  such as collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, tenascin-C, cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs), fibronectin, and laminin, can lead to abnormal vascularization/high fibrosis
  (altered physical barriers) and altered signal transduction due to changed ECM proteins
  (adhesion-related issues), and altered interplay between the ECM and PCSCs can hinder
  the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy causes fibrosis and altered vascularization
  in PDACs that change the pH, and induce hypoxia and stiffness, which affect drug
  movement. Most ECM proteins promote chemoresistance through activation of EMT and
  oncogenic signal transduction pathways, like MAPK, PI3K, and YAP. PCSC and their
  interaction with the ECM are also key drivers of resistance to chemotherapy
