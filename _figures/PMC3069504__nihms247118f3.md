caption: 'Divergent evolutionary pathways of breast cancer progression. Genomic and
  transcriptomic data in combination with morphological and immunohistochemical data
  stratify the majority of breast cancers into a “low-grade-like” molecular pathway
  and a “high-grade-like” molecular pathway. The low-grade-like pathway (left hand
  side) is characterized by recurrent chromosomal loss of 16q, gains of 1q, a low-grade-like
  gene expression signature, and the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors
  (ER+ and PR+). The progression (vertical arrows) along this pathway (green rectangles)
  culminates with the formation of low and intermediate grade invasive ductal, (LG
  IDC and IG IDC) and invasive lobular carcinomas including both the classic (ILC)
  and the pleomorphic variant (pILC). The tumors arising from the low grade pathway
  are classified as luminal consisting of a continuum of gene expression frequently
  associated with the absence (luminal A) or presence of HER2 expression (luminal
  B). The vast majority of ILCs and pILCs and their precursors cluster together within
  the luminal subtype. The high grade-like gene expression molecular pathway (right
  hand side) is characterized by recurrent gain of 11q13 (+11q13), loss of 13q (13q−),
  expression of a high-grade-like gene expression signature, amplification of 17q12
  (17q12AMP), and lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors expression (ER− and
  PR−). The progression along this pathway (red rectangles) includes intermediate
  and high grade ductal carcinomas that are stratified as HER2, or basal-like, depending
  on the expression/amplification of HER2. The molecular apocrine subtype, characterized
  by the lack of ER expression and presence of AR expression, arises from the high
  grade pathway. The model also depicts intra-pathway tumor grade progression (horizontal
  arrows). Abbreviations: ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia), LCIS (lobular carcinoma
  in situ), pALH (pleomorphic atypical lobular hyperplasia), pLCIS (pleomorphic lobular
  carcinoma in situ), FEA (flat epithelial atypia), ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia),
  Basal (basal-like), mApocrine (molecular Apocrine). +/− HER2 in which the “–”sign
  is bold indicates that the majority of tumors in the pathway lack HER2 overexpression.
