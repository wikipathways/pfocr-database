caption: The temporal response to HX1 conditioning. Left panel highlights signal transduction
  events occurring 3 h after HX1 that our microarray and bioinformatic analyses suggest
  contribute to ischemic tolerance observed two days later. Hypoxia-induced increases
  in ROS and other inflammatory mediators activate ANGPT2-TIE-2 signaling, and extensive
  integrin and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor signaling, that is held in
  check by TGFβ. Downstream p38-MAPK activity is critical to regulating gene expression
  changes at this time. Overall, signaling in the senescence pathway is increased,
  promoting cell cycle arrest. Right panel highlights differential gene expression
  two days after HX1, concomitant with ischemic tolerance. With TIE-2 expression no
  longer reduced at this time, distinct effects of increased ANGPT2 expression are
  induced relative to those occurring 3 h after HX1. Increases in Ras signaling are
  nullified by reductions in the expression of its downstream effectors, which, together
  with now quiescent TGFβ receptor-mediated signaling, no longer drive p38-MAPK. Reductions
  in DMTF1 indirectly promote TP53 signaling by negatively regulating p19 and MDM2
  (not shown). Together, increased TP53 and CDKN1A activity invoke changes in cell
  cycle regulation. Increases in PI3K signaling activate Akt-mediated survival pathways.
  This tolerant phenotype is associated with a downregulation of senescence pathway
  signaling.
