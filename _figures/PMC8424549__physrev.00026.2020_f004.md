caption: The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and nucleotide metabolism are modulated
  by mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PPP generates the reducing equivalent, NADPH, and ribose-5-phosphate,
  which serves as a backbone for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. mTORC1
  and the mTORC2 substrate Akt have been linked to the regulation of the key enzymes
  involved in the PPP. mTORC1 also controls the key enzyme, CAD, involved in pyrimidine
  synthesis. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been linked to the regulation of purine synthesis.
