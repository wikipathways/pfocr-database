caption: Schematic model for Ras pathway regulation of hTBP promoter activity in primary
  rat hepatocytes. The model is based on the data in Fig.  to . Raf-, and RalGDS-MEK-dependent
  pathways and at least one MEK-independent pathway activate hTBP promoter activity.
  Three distinct sites within the TBP promoter further define these distinct Ras signaling
  events.
