caption: Illustration of related genes involved in pigmentation pathway. BLOC1S5,
  PMEL, DTNBP1 and PLDN are genes involved in genesis of the melanosome. MC1R, MITF,
  DKK1, RAB27A, MLPH and MYO5A encode proteins in membrane or cytoplasm which are
  involved in signaling pathways of skin pigmentation. PAX3 and SOX10 are transcription
  factors in melanocyte. RACK1 is a regulator to the signal transduction in melanocyte.
  MSRB3 and UVSSA encode proteins that are involved in damaged proteins/DNA repair
  under UV. MC1R, VDR, PNMT, and ACHE was targeted by HCQ according to network pharmacology
  and molecular docking, which could further up-regulate gene expression of BLOC1S5,
  MSRB3, and UVSSA, showing the promotion effect of melanosome genesis and melanocyte
  protection under UV damage.
