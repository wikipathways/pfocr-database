caption: 'Antigen presentation and pathways of vaccine response. Plasmid DNA or mRNA
  is taken up by dendritic cells for intracellular expression of antigen. Antigen
  can be secreted (not shown) and subsequently taken up by another DCs as an exogenous
  antigen. Antigen expressed intracellularly by a dendritic cell or taken up through
  cross-priming is presented by MHC-I to CD8+ T-cells (cytotoxic leukocytes; CTLs).
  Antigen taken in exogenously or directed by DNA or mRNA trafficking signals are
  processed by the MHC-II pathway and presented to CD4+ TH cells, which can subsequently
  secrete: soluble cytokine signals (e.g., IL-12) back to the dendritic cell, proliferative
  signals (e.g., IL-2 and IFN-γ) to Tc cells, or signals directed toward B-cells (e.g.,
  IL-4) to induce B-cell proliferation and antibody secretion.'
