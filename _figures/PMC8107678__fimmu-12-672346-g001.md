caption: TLR signaling pathway. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and TLR
  interacts with TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins. (Left) TLR signaling occurs
  through a MYD88-dependent pathway. (Right) TLRs require other TIR domain-containing
  adaptors to induce cytokine expression, including TIRAP and TCAM. Purple ellipses
  denote conserved TIR domains. SOCS is a negative regulator of intracelluar cytokine
  signaling that can inhibit TLR responses.
