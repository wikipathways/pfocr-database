caption: Schematic model of integrated metabolic and epigenetic pathways in H3K27M
  cells. HK2, IDH1 and GDH, enzymes that generate α-KG, were elevated in H3K27M tumors.
  H3K27M tumor cells use α-KG to maintain low global H3K27me3 levels. Inhibition of
  HK2, IDH1 and GDH increased global H3K27me3, altered chromatin accessibility and
  suppressed H3K27M cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and are potential therapeutic
  targets (stop signs). Mutually exclusive mIDH1 use α-KG to generate D-2HG. D-2HG
  treatment or expression on mIDH1 in H3K27M cells was toxic and increased H3K27me3.
