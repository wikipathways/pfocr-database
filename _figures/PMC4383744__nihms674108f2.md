caption: '(A) Simplified schematic overview of the complement cascade illustrating
  points of therapeutic intervention in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. i) At
  the level of C3: Cp40, the Cp40-based therapeutic AMY-101 and APL-1/2 block activation
  of C3 by any convertases, thereby abrogating generation of C3b (opsonization), amplification
  via formation of C3 convertases and downstream effector pathways. TT30 and mini-FH
  target C3 convertases and C3b, accelerating convertase decay and C3b degradation,
  thereby also inhibiting AP amplification. ii) At the C5 level: Eculizumab, Coversin
  and SOBI002 all bind to and inhibit cleavage of C5, thereby blocking terminal pathway
  activation and preventing formation of the MAC. (B) Benefits and limitations of
  complement-targeted therapeutic strategies for treating PNH. i) Complement modulation
  at the level of C3 prevents C3 deposition (opsonization) and all downstream effector
  functions, including lytic pathway activation and MAC-mediated intravascular hemolysis.
  On the other hand, complement inhibition at the level of C5, prevents MAC-mediated
  hemolysis (intravascular hemolysis) but allows C3 fragment opsonization to persist,
  possibly leading to C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis (via engulfment and immune
  clearance of C3-opsonized PNH erythrocytes by complement receptor bearing macrophages
  in the hepatosplenic system). AP: Alternative pathway; CP: Classical pathway; FB:
  Factor B; Fcn: Ficollin; FD: Factor D; FP: Properdin; LP: Lectin pathway; MAC: Membrane
  attack complex; MASP: Mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease; MBL: Mannose-binding
  lectin.'
