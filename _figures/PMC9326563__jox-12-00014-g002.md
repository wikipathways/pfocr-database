caption: 'Signaling pathways that control CAD activity. This diagram is based on references
  [,,,]. CAD initiates de novo pyrimidine synthesis. CAD is activated by the activation
  of growth factors binding growth factor receptors and triggering the MAP kinases
  pathway. This activation takes place at the beginning of the S phase in the cell
  cycle. After the S phase is over, CAD is deactivated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation.
  The lower panel shows that phosphorylation of the Thr456 residue activates the enzyme,
  while phosphorylation of Ser1406 acts in the opposite way. The diagram also shows
  the three enzymes that form CAD. In this regard, the activation and deactivation
  residues form part of the first enzyme that initiates synthesis, namely, CPS (carbamoyl
  phosphate synthetase). DHO: dihydroorotase; ATC: aspartate transcarbamoylase.'
