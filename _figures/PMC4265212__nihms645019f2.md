  sense piRNAs that associate with PIWI proteins. (3) The PIWI–antisense piRNA complexes
  mediate cleavage of sense piRNA precursors and transposon (and protein-coding) transcripts,
  which silences transposon and gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.

  piRNA binding. The PIWI–sense piRNA complexes then cleave antisense piRNA precursor
  transcripts to amplify the piRNA biogenesis cycle [,]. (4) The PIWI–piRNA complexes

  description: Known gene regulation mechanisms mediated by the PIWI–piRNA pathway.
    PIWI proteins and piRNAs regulate the expression of genes and transposon at both

    precursor transcripts are produced in the nucleus. (2) Antisense piRNA precursor

    The PIWI–antisense piRNA complexes mediate cleavage of sense piRNA precursors
