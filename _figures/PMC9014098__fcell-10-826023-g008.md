caption: AQX-1125 positively regulates osteogenesis through PI3K/Akt signaling and
  inhibits osteoclastogenesis through NF-κb signaling via activation of SHIP1. Upon
  AQX-1125 stimulation, SHIP1 was activated in the BMSCs and BMMs. The activated SHIP1
  facilitates the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in BMSCs, followed by acceleration
  of the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. In addition, activated SHIP1 inhibits
  the NF-κb signaling pathway, which reduces the phosphorylation of p65 and IkBα in
  BMMs, followed by suppression of the differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts and
  the activity of osteoclasts. Overall, AQX-1125 alleviates OVX-induced bone loss.

  description: AQX-1125 positively regulates osteogenesis through PI3K/Akt signaling
    and inhibits osteoclastogenesis through NF-κb signaling via activation of SHIP1.
    Upon AQX-1125 stimulation, SHIP1 was activated in the BMSCs and BMMs. The activated
    SHIP1 facilitates the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in BMSCs, followed by acceleration
    of the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. In addition, activated SHIP1
    inhibits the NF-κb signaling pathway, which reduces the phosphorylation of p65
    and IkBα in BMMs, followed by suppression of the differentiation of BMMs into
    osteoclasts and the activity of osteoclasts. Overall, AQX-1125 alleviates OVX-induced
    bone loss.
