caption: Current knowledge is summarized regarding the eicosanoid signaling network,
  based upon data available in one of the larger publicly available pathway databases
  (the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; KEGG). Several different classes of
  lipid-derived signaling molecules are represented within this network. They include
  prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxane, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, leukotrienes,
  hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Prostaglandins are
  20-carbon unsaturated carboxylic acids containing a cyclopentane ring. Prostaglandin
  (PG) synthesis can be summarized as follows. AA is converted to PGG by a cylcooxygenase,
  and then to PGH by a peroxidase. Both endoperoxides (PGG and PGH) are chemically
  unstable. In most tissues, they are subsequently converted to two hydroxyl ketones
  (PGD and PGE), interrelated by the activity of tissue isomerases. In some tissues,
  a specific hydroxyl ketone, PGE2, can be further converted to the PGFα prostaglandin
  series (1,3-diols) by a 9-keto reductase. PGA, PGB, PGC are lab artifacts. Prostacyclin
  (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) are also synthesized from an endoperoxide, PGH2, via
  prostacyclin synthase and thromboxane synthase respectively. The relative balance
  of each is highly tissue specific. While both PGI2 and TXA2 are biologically active,
  both are rapidly inactivated to stable compounds (6-keto PGF 1α and TXB2). Leukotrienes
  are synthesized through a different branch within this network. At the “decisions
  point,” AA is oxidized to a series of hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids or HPETEs
  (5-HPETE and 12-HPETE). HPETEs are unstable (analogous to PGG and PGH), and further
  metabolized by a variety of enzymes to form the leukotrienes [Hines and McCarver,
  2006]. Through the combined activity of 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX-5) and 5-lipoxygenase
  activating protein (FLAP), AA is converted to an unstable intermediate called leukotriene
  A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is subsequently converted to a series of cysteinyl leukotrienes
  by a glutathione S-transferase (LTC4), a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (LTD4), and a
  dipeptidase (LTE4). In general, these cysteinyl leukotrienes induce relaxation of
  vascular smooth muscle and constriction of bronchiolar smooth muscle. They have
  also been shown to alter endothelial function, immune function and vascular permeability.
