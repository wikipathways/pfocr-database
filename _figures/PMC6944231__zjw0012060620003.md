caption: Pathway analyses of significantly altered proteins by IPA. Different IPA
  tools were used to get a better understanding of biological processes that are affected
  in AD. A–B, The diseases and functions tool was used to predict biological functions
  affected by the differentially expressed proteins. Exocytosis was predicted to be
  decreased (A), whereas seizures was predicted to be increased in AD (B). C, The
  molecular networks tool generated 25 different networks. The network “Cell-to-cell
  signaling and interaction/Nervous system development and function/Cellular assembly
  and organization”, shown in (C), was ranked with the highest score and consisted
  of pathways mediating neurotransmission. An asterisk indicates presynaptic proteins
  in this network. D, The upstream regulator tool predicted the transcription factor
  Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) as an upstream regulator of
  its target proteins that were identified in our dataset.
