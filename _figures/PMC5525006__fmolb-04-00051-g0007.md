caption: Metabolite and protein changes in response to low CO2 treatment in glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, and sucrose and starch metabolism. The pathways were drawn based on KEGG
  pathway database. The metabolites and proteins detected were indicated by time course
  square bars right below the molecules.
