caption: The role of cGAS-STING pathway in diabetic complications. (a) In DN, the
  high glucose environment generates large amounts of ROS, which disrupts mitochondrial
  function and leaks mtDNA to the extracellular compartment, which activates the cGAS-STING
  pathway and leads to the activation of the downstream NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and NLRP3
  inflammatory pathways, resulting in kidney injury. (b) MAFLD belongs to a class
  of NAFLD caused by excessive FFA accumulation in T2D, MAFLD leads to the development
  of IR and progression to hepatitis and cirrhosis. In NAFLD, macrophages are able
  to activate cGAS-STING via EVs and later phosphorylate p62 and TBK1, producing lipotoxicity-induced
  ubiquitination and large protein inclusions, which are hallmarks of NAFLD, leading
  to hepatitis and cirrhosis development. (c) AGEs are increased in diabetic myocardium,
  which can lead to myocardial sclerosis. Oxidative stress is also increased in diabetic
  myocardium and FFA-associated mitochondrial uncoupling occurs, which all contribute
  to the development of DC. At the same time, leukocytes such as macrophages begin
  to activate. At the mechanistic level, db/db mice are fed via HFD, which leads to
  mtDNA leakage and activation of cGAS-STING as well as the pyroptosis pathway, leading
  to the development of DC. In contrast, Metrnl was able to inhibit cGAS-STING as
  well as pyroptosis via ULK1, thereby alleviating DC. (d) In diabetes skin tissues
  and adipocytes, the high glucose microenvironment will lead to the excessive production
  of ROS in keratinocytes, destroy mitochondrial function, and lead to the release
  of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm, thus activating the cGAS-STING pathway,
  which leads to increased apoptosis, thus inhibiting DWH. Lipotoxicity in adipocytes
  can also lead to the release of mtDNA, thereby activating the cGAS-STING pathway
  and leading to obesity type inflammation. DsbA-L can prevent the occurrence of this
  pathway, thereby inhibiting the aging caused by obesity. STAT1/3 plays two opposite
  roles in this process. STAT3 can inhibit obesity induced aging, while STAT1 and
  IFN can promote inflammation caused by cGAS-STING in obesity. In macrophages, JMJD3
  causes STING activation and increases M1 polarization, resulting in delayed DWH,
  which can be inhibited by insulin. PA can also lead to the release of mtDNA from
  vascular endothelial cells and the activation of cGAS-STING, which can inhibit the
  HIPPO-YAP classic pathway, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and slowing down DWH.
