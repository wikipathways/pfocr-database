caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the classical Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  when Wnt ligands are absent, Axin binds to β-catenin, GSK3β, and APC. This allows
  GSK3β to phosphorylate β-catenin, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  by the APC. As a result, β-catenin is prevented from entering the nucleus and initiating
  downstream gene transcription. Conversely, in the presence of Wnt ligands, the Wnt
  receptor binds to Axin, preventing β-catenin from interacting with Axin, GSK3β,
  and APC. Consequently, β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus,
  where it initiates downstream transcription. (The figure was created by Figdraw,
