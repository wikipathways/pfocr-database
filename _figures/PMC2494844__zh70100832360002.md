caption: 'JAK-STAT signaling in hepatocytes in the presence and absence of STAT5A/B.
  A: cytokine-induced signaling in the presence of STAT5A/B. The growth hormone receptor
  (GHR) specifically recruits and preferentially activates STAT5A/B, which in turn
  induce the expression of specific sets of genes and elicit a STAT5 response. Suppressors
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2 and SOCS3, 2 negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway,
  are encoded by genes that are controlled by STAT5. Members of the interleukin (IL)-6
  family of cytokines activate STAT3 and elicit a STAT3 response in the cell, while
  interferons (IFNs) activate STAT1. B: cytokine-induced signaling in the absence
  of STAT5A/B. In the absence of STAT5, both STAT1 and STAT3 can be recruited to the
  GHR, although with lower affinity than STAT5. Thus GH can aberrantly activate a
  STAT1 and a STAT3 program in hepatocytes as demonstrated by gene expression profiling.
  Moreover, impaired expression of negative regulators from the SOCS family will exacerbate
  STAT3 signaling.'
