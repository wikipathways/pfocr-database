caption: Overview of the main pathways involved in CD40-TRAF signaling. a TRAF 2/3/5
  induces about 40 % of TNF production; however, they do not influence (canonical)
  NF-κB. Therefore, an alternative pathway must be present. Based on data from B-cells,
  this is most likely the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. b TRAF 2/3/5 is required for
  the IKK-complex; however, they do not influence (canonical) NF-κB. Therefore, an
  alternative pathway is likely present. c Much of the downstream targets of CD40-TRAF
  signaling still need to be uncovered. Of the majority of molecules produces by macrophages
  in response to CD40 signaling, no TRAF molecule or further pathway has been determined
