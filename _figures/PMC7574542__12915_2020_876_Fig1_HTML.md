caption: 'Levodopa is deaminated by Clostridium sporogenes. a Full reductive deamination
  pathway of C. sporogenes is depicted resulting in the full deamination (R-propionic
  acid) of (non)-proteinogenic aromatic amino acids ((N)PAAAs). The red arrow indicates
  a disrupted deamination pathway of C. sporogenes, where the dehydratase subunit
  fldC is mutagenized, resulting in a pool of partially deaminated metabolites (R-lactic
  acid) by C. sporogenes. b HPLC-ED curves from supernatant of a C. sporogenes batch
  culture conversion of levodopa (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine) over time. At the
  beginning of growth (timepoint 0 h), 100 μM of levodopa (blue) is added to the culture
  medium; the black line in the chromatogram depicts the control samples. In 24 h,
  levodopa is completely converted to DHPPA (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid),
  the deaminated product of levodopa. Other aromatic amino acids from the medium,
  tryptophan and tyrosine (which are detectable with ED), are converted to the deaminated
  products IPA (indole-3-propionic acid) and 4-HPPA (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic
  acid). c Quantification (n = 3) of levodopa conversion to DHPPA by C. sporogenes
  wild type (also see Additional File : Table S1). d Analysis of the supernatant of
  CSΩfldC shows that levodopa is not deaminated to DHPPA but to its intermediate product
  DHPLA (3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactic acid) within 24 h. Tryptophan and tyrosine
  are converted to their intermediates ILA (indole-3-lactic acid) and 4-HPLA (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactic
  acid), respectively. e Quantification (n = 3) of levodopa conversion to DHPLA by
  C. sporogenes ΩfldC (also see Additional File : Table S1). All experiments were
