caption: Possible role of non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway in mitochondrial dynamics.
  In the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the binding of the ligand to its receptor
  Fz, activates Dishevelled (Dsh), which allows the activation of a trimeric G protein.
  The G protein activates phospholipase C (PLC), increasing the levels of inositol
  triphosphate (IP3), which increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, coming
  from the ER. This Ca2+ induces further Ca2+ releases through RyRs. The high levels
  of Ca2+ activate Ca2+-dependent proteins such as protein kinase C (PKC) and the
  phosphatase Calcineurin. These enzymes regulate the activation of Dynamin-related
  protein 1 (Drp1), phosphorylation by PKC and CaMK and dephosphorylation by calcineurin,
  as a result Drp1 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the outer mitochondrial membrane
  (OMM), which is a signal for mitochondrial fission.
