caption: Comparison of TCA cycle between ad libitum feeding and 16 h fasting(A) Metabolic
  reactions, molecules, and regulations in TCA cycle (mmu00020) extracted from the
  differential regulatory trans-omic network at ad libitum feeding (top left) and
  16 h fasting (bottom left), and the numbers of differentially expressed molecules
  (nodes) and differential regulations (edges) in TCA cycle at ad libitum feeding
  (top right) and 16 h fasting (bottom right).34 Other descriptions are the same as
  Figure 6B.(B) Summary of the opposite changes in the metabolites and allosteric
  regulations between ad libitum feeding (left) and 16 h fasting (right).34 Metabolic
  pathway names related to metabolites are in parentheses. Arrow, allosteric regulation.
  Yellow area, the metabolic pathways regulated by allosteric regulators. See also
  Figures S12–S18.Red, increased molecules or activating regulations in ob/ob mice;
  blue, decreased molecules or inhibiting regulations in ob/ob mice; magenta, both
  activated and inhibited metabolic reactions in ob/ob mice; gray, unchanged molecules
  between WT and ob/ob mice
