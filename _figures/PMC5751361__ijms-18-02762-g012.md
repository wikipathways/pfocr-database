caption: TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β superfamily of cytokines bind to type I receptors
  and type II receptors at the cell surface, thereby forming a tetrameric complex.
  Binding of TGF-β1 to its receptor II activated the TGF-β receptor type I kinase,
  resulting in phosphorylation of the downstream signal transducer Smad2/3(R-SMADs).
  Phosphorylated R-SMADs forms a complex with a common mediator, Smad4 (Co-SMAD).
  This complex is translocated into the nucleus, where it binds DNA and regulates
  transcription of many genes by interacting with transcriptional cofactors. SMAD7
  represses signaling by other SMADs to down-regulate the system. Other signaling
  pathways, including the MAPK-ERK cascade are activated by TGF-β signaling, and modulate
  SMAD activation.
