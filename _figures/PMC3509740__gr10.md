caption: Model summarizing the role of netrin-1 in the regulation of inflammation
  and albumin uptake in proximal tubular epithelial cells of the diabetic kidney.
  Hyperglycemia and oxidative stress activate NFκB by inducing degradation of IκBα.
  Netrin-1 binding to UNC5B receptor will activate downstream signaling pathways like
  PI3K, ERK, and other unknown pathways. Activation of PI3K and ERK increases albumin
  uptake by tubular epithelial cells, thereby reducing albuminuria. Through an unknown
  pathway, netrin-1 also suppresses IκBα degradation and probably may increase the
  expression of IκBα as well, thereby suppressing NFκB release and translocation into
  nucleus and consequently suppressing COX-2 gene transcription. Suppression of COX-2
  expression reduces the production of PGE2 and PGE2-mediated inflammation, and suppression
  of inflammation protects the kidney from damage and from development of nephropathy.
