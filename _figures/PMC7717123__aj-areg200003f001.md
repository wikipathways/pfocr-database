caption: Metabolic reprogramming in cardiac macrophages and lymphocytes during cardiac
  injury. In the healthy heart, resident macrophages utilize glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate
  to maintain their phenotypes, and both resident macrophages and T lymphocytes rely
  on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the injured heart, proinflammatory macrophage
  and T lymphocyte subsets undergo hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-mediated metabolic
  reprogramming toward glycolysis, which feeds into the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) to generate NADPH and truncates the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to promote
  succinate accumulation. ETC, electron transport chain; Th17, T helper 17 cell.
