caption: 'Signalling network of proteins identified as major targets of autoantibodies

  ANA. Protein entities belonging to different functional groups are represented as
  different shapes. ANA: antinuclear antibody; CALR: calreticulin; CFL1: cofilin 1;

  ribonucleoprotein A1; HNRNPA2B1: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1;
  HNRNPL: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L; HSPD1: heat shock 60-kDa protein

  2); LMNA: lamin A/C; PCBP2: poly(rC)-binding protein 2; PRDX2: peroxiredoxin 2;
