caption: Epidermal growth factor binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor causes
  it to dimerise and autophosphorylate in trans. This allows the binding GRB2 and
  SOS. This complex recruits and activates RAS, inducing RAS dimerisation and activation.
  Dimerised RAS recruits RAF, releasing RAF from an autoinhibited state and enabling
  it to recruit and phosphorylate MEK1/2. The protein components and stoichiometries
  at the cell membrane are poorly defined. MEK1/2 is then phosphorylated by RAF and
  released from the complex to bind and phosphorylate ERK1/2, activating ERK1/2 kinase
  activity. ERK1/2 can act in the cytoplasm to directly phosphorylate protein substrates,
  such as BIM to directly prevent apoptosis. ERK1/2 is also translocated to the nucleus
  for the activation of transcription factors such as FOS and ELK1, driving the transcription
  of hundreds of genes to promote cell proliferation and survival.
