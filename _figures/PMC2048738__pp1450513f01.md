caption: 'Reactions of the Calvin cycle, starch synthesis, photosynthetic carbon oxygenation
  pathway, triose-P export, and Suc synthesis represented in the model (Supplemental
  Appendix S1, A and B). The numbers in the figure identify the reactions as they
  are represented in each equation. The number in subscript for each reaction rate
  (vm) is the reaction number shown in this diagram. Double-headed arrows indicate
  reversible reactions and single-headed arrows indicate essentially irreversible
  reactions. Reactions above the double dotted line are those of the chloroplast stroma
  and those below of the cytosol. The circles in the chloroplast membrane represent
  translocators: for triose-P-inorganic phosphate and glycolate-glycerate exchange.
  The metabolites in different compartments, i.e. cytosol and stroma, are represented
  separately in the model. For example, FBP in the stroma is treated as separate from
  FBP in the cytosol.'
