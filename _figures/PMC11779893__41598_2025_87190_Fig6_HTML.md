caption: 'Possible mechanism of AMLN diet and exercise on mitochondrial homeostasis
  during MASLD development. Under normal circumstances, the liver is ruddy in color
  and the mitochondria function properly. However, alterations were found in PERK-eIF2α-ATF4
  signaling pathway, mitochondrial UPR gene expression, and mitokine secretion at
  different stages of MASLD pathogenesis development. (A) Early stage of MASLD development:
  a 14-week AMLN diet induced hepatic steatosis and ER stress. This mild mitochondrial
  stress initiated a diverse set of retrograde stress responses, including mitonuclear
  communication, UPRmt, and FGF21 secretion, which contribute to maintaining mitochondrial
  function, enabling mitochondrial self-healing, and alleviating liver damage. (B)
  Late stage of MASLD development: an 18-week AMLN diet aggravated the accumulation
  of hepatic lipids. Severe lipid deposition led to disconnect communication between
  mitochondria and nuclear, impaired UPRmt through overactivating the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway,
  then resulted in mitochondria losing their self-repair ability. Moreover, exercise
  intervention significantly improved the imbalanced mitochondrial homeostasis due
  to chronic AMLN diet, which plays a pivotal role in reversing the progression of
  MASLD. Red arrows: increase effect; Black arrows: decreased effect'
