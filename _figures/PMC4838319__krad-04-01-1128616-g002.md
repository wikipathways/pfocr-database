caption: 'De novo synthesis of CoA is a highly conserved pathway that consists of
  5 enzymatic steps: pathothenic acid phosphorylation, cysteine conjugation, decarboxylation,
  conjugation to an adenosyl group and phosphorylation. In mammals the first step
  is catalyzed by PANK2 and is the rate-limiting step, while the last 2 steps are
  catalyzed by CoASY and involve 2 enzyme activities: PPAT (4′-phosphopantetheine
  adenylyltransferase) and DPCK (dephospho-CoA kinase).'
