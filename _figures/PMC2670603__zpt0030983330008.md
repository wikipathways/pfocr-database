caption: Cartoon summarizing the key findings of this study. Formation of ceramide  in
  the spinal cord during repeated administration of morphine plays a critical  role
  in the development of morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance through  formation
  of peroxynitrite-mediated nitroxidative stress and neuroimmune  activation (glial
  cell activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines)  after activation of NF-κB.
  The overall pathway can, in turn, be  amplified through feedback activation of ceramide
  biosynthesis by several  nitroxidative species, including peroxynitrite. Inhibition
  of ceramide by  inhibitors of the ceramide metabolic pathway such as FB1 blocked
  these  pathways, leading to inhibition of antinociceptive tolerance. The ceramide  metabolic
  pathway is an attractive target for novel approaches in the  management of pain.
