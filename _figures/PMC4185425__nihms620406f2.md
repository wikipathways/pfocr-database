caption: (A) Binding of PD-L1+ cells to PD-1+ activated T cells can result in T cell
  dysfunction by causing T cell anergy, T cell exhaustion, T cell apoptosis, and by
  inducing the differentiation of T regulatory cells. PD-1 is also expressed by activated
  B cells, monocytes, NKT cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and suppresses these
  cells. (B) PD-L1 also impairs anti-tumor immunity by protecting PD-L1+ tumor cells
  from CTL, presumably by inhibiting Fas or granzyme B-mediated cytolysis.
