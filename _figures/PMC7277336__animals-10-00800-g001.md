caption: 'Signaling cascade of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and its potential
  impacts in metabolism, its interactions with transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3)
  and the biological functions of the IGF1, IGFBP2 and TGFß3 genes. IGF-1 bioavailability
  is modulated by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) []. IGF-1 action is mediated by its
  binding to its receptor [], the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R).
  IGF-1R is a heterotetramer composed of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane
  β subunits, as shown in . α subunits are cysteine-rich regions, whereas β subunits
  possess a tyrosine kinase domain, which constitutes the signal transduction mechanism
  []. Tyrosine phosphorylation activates a signaling cascade []. IGF-1 has autocrine,
  paracrine [,] and endocrine effects []. IGF-1 binds to its receptor (IGF-1R) in
  the cell membrane, resulting in autophosphorylation and the recruitment of the adaptor
  proteins–insulin receptor substrate IRS-1, IRS-2, and the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
  kinase (SRC) homology and collagen protein (SHC). The serine/threonine kinase (AKT)
  is activated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and by
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-containing complex mTOR-C2, leading to
  the phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473, respectively. Activated AKT
  regulates downstream signaling molecules such as tuberous sclerosis protein 1/2
  (TSC-1/2), which inhibit mTOR-C1 complex and regulate the ribosomal protein S6 kinase
  1/2 (S6K-1/2) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein
  1 (4EB-P1) phosphorylation, FOXO transcription factors, glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK-3β), p27, BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD), and BCL-2. These substances
  are involved in some cellular processes such as protein synthesis, glucose metabolism
  and cell survival. SHC activation induces the activation of the RAS/mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase pathway, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation []. Activation
  of IRS induces the activation of intracellular RAF/MEK/ERK/RAS and PI3K signaling
  pathway. The first mentioned pathway mediates mitosis, and the second one mediates
  metabolism and cell growth effect through AKT []. After the ligand (IGF-1) binds
  to its receptor (IGF-1R), PI3K is activated, cell proliferation is promoted by activating
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and apoptosis is blocked by
  inducing the phosphorylation and the inhibition of proapoptotic proteins such as
  BAD []. The protein IGFBP-2 encoded by the gene of the same name is able to control
  the biological actions of IGFs [] and TGFß [] in vivo via the endocrine, autocrine
  or paracrine pathways. The protein TGFß-3 encoded by the TGFβ3 gene controls the
  growth, proliferation and differentiation of cells, cell motility and apoptosis.
  TGFß-3 plays an essential role in the development of skeletal muscles. It also can
  suppress the formation of tumors []. Adapted from [,,,] based on other works: [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,].'
