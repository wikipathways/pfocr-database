caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism underlying the gedunin-mediated
  inhibition of C. acnes-associated inflammatory signaling pathways. C. acnes stimulates
  TLR2, leading to the recruitment of MyD88 and the activation of NF-κB. Activated
  NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, promoting the transcription of pro-IL-1β. In
  the presence of signals such as ATP or Nigericin (NIG), the NLRP3 inflammasome is
  activated, resulting in the cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β by caspase-1.
  IL-1β then contributes to skin inflammation. The red symbols in the figure represent
  inhibition by Gedunin, which blocks both the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly, thereby suppressing the production of IL-1β and preventing inflammation
