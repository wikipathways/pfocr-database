caption: 'Low CD4+ T cell suppression and lack of cell cycle inhibitor p21 in newborns
  upon exposure to IFN-β. A graphical abstract is depicted that summarizes the main
  results of this study: Newborn CD4+ T cells have a distinct pathway of IFN-β-signaling
  in which (1) newborn CD4+ T cells express higher levels of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 compared
  to adults, (2) IFN-β-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation and induction of transcription
  factors STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 are comparable between newborn and adult CD4+ T cells
  but (3) newborn total and naïve CD4+ T cells, contrary to adults, lack the induction
  of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 after exposure to IFN-β. In addition, IFN-β has
  a low inhibitory effect on newborn CD4+ T cells with regards to (1) proliferation,
  (2) phosphorylation of Rb and (3) cytokine production upon TCR stimulation compared
  to adult CD4+ T cells (red lines).'
