caption: EGFR stimulation induces activation of phosphatase SHP2 which decreases phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and subsequently expression of HLA class I and APM components. Conversely,
  EGFR mediated activation of JAK2-STAT1 induces expression of PD-L1. Likewise, mutant
  EGFR/RAS-MAPK pathway induces expression of PD-L1 as reported in NCSLC. Other pathways
  involved in PD-L1 expression are depicted on the left, PI3K and NPM/ALK-STAT3 pathways
  have been reported to upregulate PD-L1 in glioblastoma and T cell Lymphoma, respectively.
  EGFR/HER2 stimulation induces secretion of IL-8, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, eotaxin,
  GM-CSF inducing chronic inflammation and escape from T cell recognition. Overall,
  EGFR mediated downregulation of signal 1 and upregulation of suppressive signals
  2 and 3, favoring escape from CTL recognition.
