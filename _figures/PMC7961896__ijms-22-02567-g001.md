caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal
  muscle mass. Binding of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to its putative receptor
  (IGF-1R) induces protein synthesis primarily through downstream activation of Akt/PKB
  and mTOR. The myostatin/activin A/growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and transforming
  growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathways inhibits muscle growth due to the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3, which serves a primary function as an inhibitor of Akt. The ubiquitous
  protein kinase complex mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates
  protein synthesis through activation of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K)
  and its substrate ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), the serine/arginine-rich protein
  specific kinase SRPK, and the translation repressor protein called eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), also known as PHAS-1. Moreover,
  increased in cellular concentration of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) stimulates
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as well as peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) to induce mitochondrial biogenesis.
  Extracellular signaling molecules, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 7, 13, and 14,
  and inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis
  (TWEAK), interleukins (ILs), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) increased expression
  of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagic-lysosomal
  pathway (ALP).
