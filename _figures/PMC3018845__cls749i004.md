caption: Exogenous administration of Ang-(1–7) results in increased ACE activity ,
  leading to increased levels of AngII, which bind to AT1R  and activate the pressor
  arm of the RAS system. Furthermore, excess Ang-(1–7) can also be broken down to
  Ang-(3–7), a potent agonist of the AT4R , which has been shown to contribute to
  cardiovascular disease via the activation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) pathway.
  Activation of the AT4R by AngIV, a metabolite of AngII may play a role . Finally,
  reduced renal excretion of angiotensin metabolites may also be contributing to the
  effects observed in the present study.
