caption: Model depicting the roles of μ1 and σ3 in limiting necroptosis. Pathway of
  reovirus-induced necroptosis illustrating that in addition to the previously identified
  role of μ1 in limiting viral replication, σ3 plays an inhibitory role in IFN production
  and IFN signaling by limiting detection or signaling from RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)
  to produce IFN. Therefore, both viral outer capsid proteins negatively regulate
  the induction of cell death.
