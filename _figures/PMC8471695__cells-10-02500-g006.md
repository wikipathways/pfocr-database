caption: Schematic illustration of signaling pathways underlying the synergy between
  palmitate and IL-26 for inflammatory mediators. Activation of the synergistic pathways
  was induced by palmitate and IL-26 via the TLR4-ERK1/2-c-Jun pathway. TAK242 and
  U0126 inhibited TLR4 internalization and suppressed the synergistic effect of palmitate
  and IL-26.
