caption: 'Human diseases linked to eIF2 Ser-51 phosphorylation stress responses and
  the mTORC1 signaling pathway. (A) Cellular stress can lead to the phosphorylation
  of eIF2 on Serine 51 of the α subunit (eIF2α Ser51) by four eIF2α kinases: heme-regulated
  inhibitor (HRI), protein kinase RNA- activated (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) kinase (PERK), and general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2); each responsive
  to different cellular stresses (schematic only showing ER Stress). Phosphorylation
  of eIF2α inhibits translation by blocking the activity of the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor eIF2B, preventing the assembly of the eIF2–GTP–Met-tRNAi ternary
  complex, and enhances translation of stress response mRNAs such as those encoding
  activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which can escape the inhibition of general
  translation by an indirect mechanism, resulting in the induction of downstream genes
  involved in the UPR. (B) In response to ligand stimulation (e.g., growth factors),
  cell receptors (e.g., RTKs) activate the kinase PI3K, phosphorylating PIP2 to produce
  PIP3, which then recruits AKT and allows phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 through
  PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. AKT inhibits the GTPase activity of TSC2 in the TSC1/TSC2
  complex, elevating levels of GTP-Rheb, which subsequently enables activation of
  mTORC1. mTORC1 is then able to phosphorylate downstream proteins, p70S6K and 4E-BPs,
  resulting in regulation of mRNA translation. The phosphorylation and activation
  of p70S6K leads to activation of the ribosomal protein S6. Phosphorylation of the
  4E-BPs results in 4E-BP inactivation and prevents their binding and sequestration
  of eIF4E, allowing interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G. When 4E-BPs are dephosphorylated,
  they become active, sequestering eIF4E, and blocking eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, resulting
  in eIF4E-mediated translation inhibition. Diseases linked to eIF2α phosphorylation
  and activation of mTORC1 signaling (described in the text) are Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
  diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, COPD, and heart diseases. ‘P’ in a yellow diamond
  indicates activating phosphorylation. eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor;
