caption: 'Simplified diagram of the core element of the three unfolded protein response
  (UPR) signaling branches of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During different viral
  infections, the ER stress activates the three stress sensor proteins: IRE1α, ATF6,
  and PERK (detailed in reviews [,]). Each sensor uses a distinct mechanism of signal
  transduction to drive the transcription of UPR target genes and eventually work
  as feedback loops to mitigate the ER stress [,]. Upon ER stresses, ATF6, a transcriptional
  factor, translocate into the Golgi compartment, where it is cleaved by the site
  (1/2) protease. The N-terminal cytosolic domain of cleaved ATF6 is released into
  cytosol and then translocated into the nucleus where it binds to ER stress-response
  elements to activate target genes, including XBP-1 and C/EBP-homologous protein
  (CHOP) []. The activation of PERK inhibits general protein translation by the phosphorylation
  of eIF2α, enabling dedicated translation of transcripts, including ATF4, a key transducer.
  The IRE1 branch is regulated by non-conventional mRNA splicing [,]. Subsequently,
  the activated IRE1 processes XBP1 mRNA to generate the spliced form of XBP1 protein
  (XBP1s), which participates in the IRE1α-mediated UPR pathway in response to ER
  stresses [,]. Eventually, the activation of the cleaved ATF6 (N-ATF6), ATF4, and
  XBP1 transcription factors increases the protein-folding capacity in the ER lumen.
  Meanwhile, IRE1 and PERK sensors also decrease the load of proteins entering the
  ER [,].'
