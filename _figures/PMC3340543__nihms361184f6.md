caption: (a) Treatment with PARP inhibitor stabilizes spontaneous DNA single-strand
  breaks, which are converted to DSBs during DNA replication (; ). (b) DNA DSBs can
  be repaired either by NHEJ or HR. (c) 5′ – 3′ exonuclease resection commits repair
  to the error-free HR pathway. 53BP1 antagonizes double-strand break resection. (d)
  Ku70/80 can potentially join the DSB to a second DNA end present in the cells to
  cause chromosome rearrangements. (e) Treatment with cisplatin or MMC generates interstrand
  DNA cross-links. (f) Interstrand cross-links cause replication fork stalling and
  collapse. Accumulation of FANCI/D2, dependent on BRCA1, recruits endonucleases that
  cut DNA on either side of the interstrand cross-link to generate a double-strand
  break (g). (h) Trans-lesion synthesis (TLS) and (i) nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  re-generate duplex DNA on one sister chromatid, enabling homology-dependent repair
  of the DNA DSB. (j) Aberrant joining mediated by Ku70/80-competes with normal repair
  and can potentially generate chromosome rearrangements leading to cancer or cell
  death.
