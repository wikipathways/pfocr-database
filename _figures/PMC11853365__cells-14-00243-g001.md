  pathology. (a) Interaction between Aβ and oxidative stress in AD pathology: This
  panel emphasizes the detrimental effects of Aβ aggregation on oxidative stress in
  APoE4+ microglia. The presence of amyloid plaques generates excessive reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in ApoE4+ microglia, which damage mitochondria and exacerbate oxidative
  stress in the brain. This promotes further Aβ aggregation and increases neurotoxicity,
  establishing a vicious cycle of neuronal damage and plaque accumulation. (b) Role
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neuroinflammation: This panel outlines the molecular
  pathways linking ApoE4 to inflammasome activation in microglia. Inflammatory stimuli
  activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  genes, including NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. The NLRP3 inflammasome subsequently activates
  caspase-1 (CASP1), which converts pro-IL-1β into its active form, IL-1β. This perpetuates
  chronic neuroinflammation and contributes to neuronal damage. (c) Lipid metabolism
  dysfunction and impaired Aβ clearance: This panel illustrates how ApoE4-driven lipid
  metabolism dysfunction prevents astrocytes and microglia from maintaining homeostasis.
  Disrupted interactions with lipid transport receptors, such as LDL receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP1), lead to intracellular lipid accumulation, compromising cellular
  integrity and reducing Aβ clearance. This dysfunction aggravates amyloid plaque
  buildup and neuronal degeneration. (d) Comparison of healthy and dysfunctional microglia
  in phagocytic capacity: Healthy microglia support tissue homeostasis by effectively
  phagocytizing Aβ and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like TGF-β, IL-4, and
  IL-10, aiding tissue repair. In contrast, ApoE4-expressing microglia demonstrate
  lower phagocytic activity, resulting in the accumulation of Aβ and cellular debris.
  Simultaneously, they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β,
  and IL-6, which promote chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration'
