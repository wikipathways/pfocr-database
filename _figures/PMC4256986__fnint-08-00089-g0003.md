caption: 'Organization of cerebral structures involved in the control of eye movements,
  specifically of ocular saccades. The visual stimulus activates the retino-cortical
  visual pathway (LGN: lateral geniculate nucleus; visual cortex), which activates
  associative cortex (PPC: posterior parietal cortex), as well as cortical (SEF: supplementary
  eye field; FEF: frontal eye field) and subcortical areas (CN: caudate nucleus; SNpr:
  substantia nigra pars reticulata) involved in eye movement control by acting onto
  thalamus and the motor part (intermediate layer) of superior colliculus (SCi). The
  visual stimulus activates in parallel the retino-tectal visual pathway through the
  sensory part (superficial layer) of superior colliculus (SCs), which directly activates
  SCi. In fine, eye movements are triggered by premotor (Premot.), which are under
  the inhibitory control of omnipause neurons (OPN). Premotor neurons activate motor
  neurons of oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and abducens (VI) nerves. Eye movements
  also interact with head movement (not developed). Other notations: DLPFC: dorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex; OKR: optokinetic response; VN: vestibular neuron; VOR: vestibulo-ocular
  reflex. Adapted from Hikosaka et al. (, p. 956, Figure 3).'
