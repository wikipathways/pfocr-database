caption: Lipid signaling pathways during oocyte maturation. The flow chart representative
  diagram explaining the various signaling events occurs during mammalian oocyte maturation.
  Briefly, luteinizing hormone (LH) through its receptor luteinizing hormone receptor
  (LHR) stimulates the entry of arachidonic acid in theca cells (TCs) in the form
  of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Then HSL is activated through cAMP/PKA pathways,
  and initiates the release of cholesterol from lipid droplets. In the mitochondria,
  cholesterol molecules are converted into pregnenolone by action of steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein (StAR). Furthermore, COX pathway is triggered inside the
  granulosa cells (GCs) via FSH stimulation which initiates the expression of aromatase
  and converts testosterone (T) into estradiol (E2). Estradiol further stimulates
  various pathways in the oocytes which safeguard the degradation of cAMP and concurrent
  inhibition of maturation-promoting factor (MPF). On the other hand, activation of
  progesterone (P4) signaling causes inhibition of cAMP production by blocking adenylate
  cyclase (AC) activity which results in MPF activation and GVBD.
