caption: In oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), high mobility group A protein (HMGA)
  upregulates the expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the
  rate liming enzyme for the NAD salvage pathway. The HMGA-mediated NAMPT expression
  induces NAD synthesis, leading to higher NAD+/NADH ratios. This metabolic change
  can induce a higher pro-inflammatory SASP, which accelerates cancer progression
  in surrounding cells. During aging-related senescence (ARS), the chronic SASP causes
  a low-level pro-inflammatory environment, leading to inflammaging and upregulation
  of CD38 expression in M1 macrophages and other immune cells. Induction of CD38 expression
  in turn causes a reduction in NAD and NMN levels in surrounding tissues. Pro-inflammatory
  immune cells also have reduced NAD levels, but this reduction depends on other enzymes
  in addition to CD38, like PARP1. NAD boosting-therapies are attractive therapeutical
  approaches, but it is crucial to consider them carefully. NAD= nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; NMN= nicotinamide mononucleotide; SASP= senescence associated secretory
  phenotype; OIS= oncogene-induced senescence
