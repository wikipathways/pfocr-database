caption: Three different ways resting/na誰ve T lymphocytes become activated. Activation
  by the first encounter requires na誰ve lymphocytes associated with professional antigen-presenting
  cells, namely, dendritic cells. The second encounter with the antigen is enough
  to generate a fast, strong response for memory lymphocytes in the resting state.
  Hypotheses based on the canonical first/second encounter models led to an exploration
  of potential cross-reactive antigens that elicit spondyloarthritis after pathogen
  infection. With improved knowledge of the immune regulatory network, the antigen-independent
  activation of T cells has been identified, which provides a possible pathway for
  autoreactive T cells that bypasses central tolerogenesis mechanisms.
