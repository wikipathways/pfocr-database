caption: Toll‐like receptor signaling pathways. TLR2/6 and 4 localize in the cell
  membrane, and TLR3, TLR7/8, and 9 localize in the endosome surface. Activation of
  two major adaptive downstream proteins, MYS88 and TRIF, leads to production of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines and IFN I. Activation of TRIF induces activation of TRAF3, which activates
  IRF3 and leads to production of IFN I. MYD88 induces activation of TRAF6 in TLR2/6
  as well as TLR4 pathway but leads to activation of IRAK4 and indirectly TRAF6 and
  TRAF3 in TLR7/9 and TLR9 pathway. Activation of NF‐kB signaling through TRAF6 increases
  production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and activation of IRF7 leads to production
  of IFN I. dsRNA, double strand RNA; IFN I, interferon type 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharides;
  MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88; NF‐kB, nuclear factor k‐light‐chain‐enhancer;
  ssRNA, single strand RNA; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor‐associated factor;
  TRIF, TIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β
