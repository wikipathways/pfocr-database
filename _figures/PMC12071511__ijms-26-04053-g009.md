caption: Proposed signaling pathway in VSMCs in response to AngII stimulation leading
  to LMCD1 upregulation. AngII induces LMCD1 upregulation via AT1-R activation, mediated
  through Gq/11 protein coupling. The α subunit of Gq/11 activates phospholipase-C
  β (PLCβ), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol
  and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic
  reticulum, leading to activation of the p38 MAPK pathway probably via multiple mechanisms,
  including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. The
  p38 MAPK pathway ultimately drives the upregulation of LMCD1 in the nucleus
