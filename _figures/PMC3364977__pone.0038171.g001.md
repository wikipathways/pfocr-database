caption: Intracellular levels of acetate contribute to the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS
  pathway leading to the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to vertebrate host-specific
  conditions and provide the initiating substrate for the mevalonate pathway. It appears
  that acetate plays a central role in modulating host-specific adaptation to central
  metabolic functions critical for survival of B. burgdorferi under different environmental
  conditions. The rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase
  (HMGR), is a potential chemotherapeutic target that can be exploited to reduce the
  survival of B. burgdorferi and hence a reduction in the incidence of Lyme disease.
  Sequence analysis of members of the MP in B. burgdorferi indicated significant similarity
  with ORFs of the MP that have been characterized in L. monocytogenes, P. mevalonii
  and S. aureus () . Based on this analysis, B. burgdorferi appears to possess all
  open reading frames (ORFs bb0683 to bb0688) necessary for the production of IPP
  via the mevalonate pathway .
