caption: 'Left: De novo biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of sphginolipids (SLs) begins
  with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Three further synthetic steps
  are needed to produce ceramide (Cer) that links the sphingoid backbone (long chain
  base) with a FA chain and is the center of the SL metabolic pathway. Right: Salvage
  pathways and complex SL biosynthesis. The post-Cer metabolic steps are reversible.
  Ceramide serves both as substrate and as product for the biosynthesis and degration,
  respectively, of complex SLs, such as sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids. Deacylation
  of Cer yields sphingosine that can be phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate.
  The irreversible degradation of the sphingoid backbone is catalyzed by a lyase that
  acts on sphingosine-1-phosphate. (b) Major glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways.
  Top: Biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid, which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis
  of phospholipids, by a series of reduction and acylation reactions. Bottom Left:
  the Kennedy pathway. Phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated to yield diacylglycerol,
  which in turn is converted into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) by the addition of a phosphocholine or a phosphoethanolamine head group, respectively.
  Phosphatidylserine (PS) can be formed by exchanging the head group from either PC
  or PE for serine. Mitochondrial PE is synthesized on location by decarboxylation
  of PS. Bottom Right: Cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) pathway. PS and
  phosphatidylinositol (PI) are synthesized from the precursor CDP-DAG by the enzymes
  CDP-DAG serine phosphatidyltransferase and CDP-DAG inositol phosphatidyltransferase
  (PI synthase), respectively. CDP-DAG is also used for the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol
  and cardiolipin, which are phospholipids that are confined to mitochondrial membranes.
  Corresponding metabolic enzyme genes with experimentally confirmed functions in
  C. elegans are indicated in red.'
