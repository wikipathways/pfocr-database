caption: CEP-1347 blocks cell death, and JNK acts upstream of the divergence of cell
  death pathways. A, CEP-1347 blocks the development of competence-to-die by cytochromec
  and the Bax-dependent release of cytochromec, which cooperate to activate caspases.B,
  NGF regulates metabolism via both activating and inhibiting signaling pathways.
  Stimulation of metabolism appears to result from the inhibition of JNK signaling
  because NGF-deprived neurons display active metabolic rates in the presence of the
  JNK inhibitor CEP-1347. A second pathway independent of JNK activation would account
  for the difference between NGF-maintained cultures and NGF-deprived CEP-1347-maintained
  neurons. Here metabolism is represented by polysomes (right bottom, protein synthesis),
  mitochondrial activity (right center), and glucose uptake (right top, Glut, a glucose
  transporter).
