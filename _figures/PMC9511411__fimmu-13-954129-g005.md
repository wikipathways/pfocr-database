caption: STING in monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes (A) Inactivation of TREX1,
  RNaseH2 and SAMHD1 leads to abnormal accumulation of dsDNA in normal cells, which
  over-activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, upregulates the expression of IFNs
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ultimately triggers AGS; (B) Mutations in STING
  in the connector helix loop (N154S, V155M, and V147L) and the polymerization interface
  (G207E, R281Q, R284G, and R284S) lead to structural activation of STING, upregulating
  the expression of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ultimately causing SAVI;
  (C) Missense mutations in the structural domain of COPA WD40 impair endoplasmic
  reticulum binding and target protein sequencing, leading to structural activation
  of STING, upregulating the expression of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
  ultimately causing COPA syndrome.
