caption: Schematic representation of a polarized epithelial cell and a neuron. (A)
  The scheme depicts a polarized epithelial cell flanked by two neighboring cells.
  Tight junctions block the passage of substances through the intercellular space
  and also serve as a boundary between the apical (blue) and basolateral (red) domains
  of the plasma membrane. Adherens junctions hold cells together and regulate their
  proliferation. Vesicular carriers that transport proteins to the apical and basolateral
  plasma membrane domains are shown to emanate from both the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
  and recycling endosomes (RE), reflecting polarized sorting in both the biosynthetic
  and recycling pathways, respectively. Apical carriers are shown to arise from cholesterol-
  and glycosphingolipid-enriched “raft” domains, whereas basolateral carriers arise
  from adaptor protein (AP)–enriched “coat” domains. (B) Depiction of a neuron making
  synapses with two other neurons. Synapses are shown as contacts between an axon
  terminal and a dendritic spine, but post-synaptic sites also occur on the dendritic
  shaft or soma. The boundary between the axonal (blue) and somatodendritic (red)
  domains of the plasma membrane is at the axon initial segment (AIS, green). Axonal
  and somatodendritic carriers are shown emanating from the TGN and RE, as in epithelial
  cells. Although both schemes depict polarized sorting occurring by segregation into
  two types of transport carriers at the TGN/RE, selective retention at or removal
  from a particular domain of the plasma membrane, as well as transcytosis, also determine
  polarized distribution of some proteins in both epithelial cells and neurons (;

  pathway has also been demonstrated (). N, nucleus.

    (A) The scheme depicts a polarized epithelial cell flanked by two neighboring
