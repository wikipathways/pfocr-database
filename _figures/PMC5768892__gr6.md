caption: 'GCN5 Affects Multiple Components of the FGF Signaling Pathway and Activates
  Selective Targets during Early DifferentiationTop: the abnormal phenotype of Gcn5−/−
  EBs becomes evident early during EB differentiation (day 5). Loss of Gcn5 leads
  to disorganization of the epiblast architecture that is associated with defective
  cytoskeleton networks (F-actin and vimentin) and decreases in progenitors fated
  for mesoderm. At later stages of differentiation (days 9 and 12), Gcn5−/− EBs are
  smaller in size and express lower levels of marker genes for ectoderm (blue), endoderm
  (green), and mesoderm (magenta), compared with the controls. Lighter shades indicate
  decreased expression levels of marker genes for each population. Middle: at day
  5, GCN5 affects expression of multiple genes encoding critical components in FGF
  signaling and for proper activation of ERK and p38 pathways. Solid diamond, up (red)
  or down (green) regulated transcripts; open diamond (green), decreased protein expression;
  double open diamond (green), decreased protein phosphorylation. Bottom: at day 5,
  GCN5 is required for activation of genes important for signaling through promoter-associated
  H3K9ac, including four cMYC targets (blue).'
