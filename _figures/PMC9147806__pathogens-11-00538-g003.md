caption: Innate immune signaling pathways activated during coronavirus infection.
  Viral RNA stimulation of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway activates the downstream IRF3 and
  NF-κB pathways to induce IFN-I production. IFN-I members (such as β) then bind the
  IFNAR1 receptor and trigger the Jak/Stat pathway and the expression of ISGs in neighboring
  cells []. Coronavirus proteins have evolved ways to target components of these signaling
  pathways to prevent the interferon response. PLpro, nsp13, and nsp16 interfere with
  MDA5 activation. PLpro, nsp6, N, nsp12, ORF3b, and ORF6 interfere with IRF3 activation.
  NF-κB activation is inhibited by nsp13 and ORF9c, and Jak/Stat activation is suppressed
  by ORF3a. Coronavirus proteins also interfere with host cellular processes; for
  example, nsp1, nsp10, nsp14, and N block translation, and ORF5 blocks nuclear trafficking.
