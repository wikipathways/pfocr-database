caption: C-type lectin receptor signaling in TB and HIV. Signaling through C-type
  lectins is an important driver of innate and adaptive responses against Mtb infection.
  Dectin 1 and 2 signaling within APCs results in expression of il17A, il6 and tgfβ
  transcript for the differentiation of Th17 cell subsets. DC-SIGN can inhibit the
  IL-6 response of Dectin-1, producing an anti-inflammatory environment, which favors
  Mtb intracellular growth. Mincle, which binds to mycobacterial TDM, forms a heterodimer
  with another CLR, MCL, to induce protective cytokine responses through the MyD88
  signaling pathway. Mannose receptor (MR), binding to mannosylated Mtb, initiates
  phagocytosis while also inhibiting phagosome maturation within macrophages. Additionally,
  C-type lectin receptors bind to the HIV envelope protein, gp120, to mediate or restrict
  viral transmission and regulate inflammatory responses. The transmembrane CLRs,
  DC-SIGN, DCIR and siglec-1 facilitate trans-infection of HIV to CD4+T cells through
  the lymphatics. Additionally, the soluble CLR, galectin-1, improves HIV binding
  to the CD4 receptor. Signaling of dendritic cell receptors, DC-SIGN and DCIR, also
  aid in host defense against HIV by internalizing viral particles and initiating
  an antiviral type I interferon response, respectively. As another mechanism of host
  defense, the macrophage mannose receptor restricts viral particle budding, although
  HIV can evade this mechanism by downregulating the mrc1 gene. HIV also increases
  Mincle-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in in vitro models of infection.
  Together, these CLRs demonstrate the multifaceted role of receptor binding in HIV
  protection and pathogenesis and regulating the innate immune response to Mtb.
