caption: Molecular alterations underlying vascular neoplasias. (A) Normal ECs (illustrated
  in the center) have a finite replicative lifespan that is dictated by the shortening
  of telomeres with each cell division. Critical shortening of telomeres leads to
  activation of p53 and pRb pathways, and the onset of senescence. (B–D) Abnormal
  proliferation of ECs is a common feature of vascular neoplasias. Abnormalities in
  the VEGF pathway are common across the spectrum of vascular neoplasias. Other mechanisms
  implicated in oncogenesis are listed, and chromosomal characteristics are described
  in blue. A simple karyotype is characterized by a near-diploid chromosome number
  and two or fewer karyotypic abnormalities. A complex karyotype is defined as five
  or more chromosomal aberrations. (B) Hemangioma is a benign condition in which hyperproliferation
  of immature ECs is driven by constitutive activation of NFκB and VEGF signaling
  pathways. (B,C) Infection by KSHV gives rise to classic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), which
  is relatively indolent and can either undergo spontaneous regression or can become
  locally invasive. p53 is inactivated, whereas mTOR and telomerase are activated
  by the KSHV-encoded protein LANA and the G-protein coupled receptor, respectively.
  (C) In immune-compromised individuals, KSHV often progresses to a multifocal tumor.
  (C,D) Hemangioendothelioma also presents in various grades, with defects in the
  p53 pathway found in malignant hemangioendothelioma, but not in intermediate-grade
  hemangioendothelioma. Chromosomal abnormalities are observed in intermediate-grade
  and malignant EC tumors. (D) In addition to p53 dysfunction, malignant hemangioendothelioma
  and angiosarcoma often exhibit chromosomal instability. Activation of oncogenes
  such as Ras is also common in angiosarcoma. EC, endothelial cell; NFκB, nuclear
  factor-κB; ALT, alternate telomere lengthening; KS, Kaposi’s sarcoma; KSHV, Kaposi’s
  sarcoma-associated herpes virus [also known as HHV-8 (human herpes virus type-8)];
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; LANA, latency-associated nuclear antigen;
  AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome; pRb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
  protein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.
