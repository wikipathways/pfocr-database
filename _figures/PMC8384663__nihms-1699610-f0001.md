caption: The development of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is influenced by a combination
  of genetic risk loci (red), many of which are involved in regulation of IL-23 receptor
  signaling and the NF-kB pathway, imbalances in Treg/T17 immunity (blue), as well
  as changes in the gut and cutaneous microbiome (yellow). Illustration assistance
