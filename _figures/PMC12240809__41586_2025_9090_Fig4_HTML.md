caption: a, Heat map showing the ranks of new T9αH and T1βHs and other Taxol biosynthetic
  genes in the three modules. T9αH-725A is the T9αH independently reported by other
  groups12–14. Black, previously known Taxol genes. Orange, new Taxol pathway genes
  identified in this figure. Red, Taxus enzymes proposed to act in other taxane pathways.
  b, Proposed biosynthetic pathway from 4, the latest intermediate we reported recently18,
  to taxusin (6), and the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of products
  4–6 when the indicated sets of genes were expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. Blue
  shading highlights the biosynthetic pathway towards Taxol, which only involves 4
  and 5. c, Proposed biosynthetic pathway from 5 to baccatin VI (11-Bz), and the corresponding
  EICs of intermediates when the indicated sets of genes were expressed in N. benthamiana
  leaves. Blue shading highlights the biosynthetic pathway towards Taxol. Structures
  of 5, 7-Ac, 7-Bz, 8-Ac, 8-Bz, 9-Ac, 9-Bz, 10-Ac, 10-Bz and 11-Ac are proposed on
  the basis of the functions of enzymes previously characterized (TAT, TAX19, T2αH,
  TBT, T7βH and TOT) and described in this study (Τ9αH-750C, T7AT and T1βH). TAX19
  is used to generate known 13-O-acetylated products, including taxusin (6) and baccatin
  VI (11-Bz), for structural analysis. Diamond indicates the structure is supported
  by NMR. d, EICs of expected products when the pathway to 6O4A is expressed with
  TOT, T7AT or both in N. benthamiana. In the absence of T7AT, no notable 6O4A depletion
  or product formation by TOT is observed. e, MS/MS fragmentation patterns of heterologously
  produced baccatin VI (11-Bz) in N. benthamiana compared with that of 11-Bz standard.
  MS/MS fragmentations were generated using [M+Na]+ (m/z = 737.2788) as the precursor
  ion and fragmented with a collision energy of 30 eV
