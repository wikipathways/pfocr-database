caption: The central enzymes of the Asp-derived amino-acid pathway in chloroplasts
  and allosteric regulation. (A) The amino acids Lys, Met, Thr and Ile, and the methylating
  agent AdoMet are synthesized from aspartate. Simple and double arrows indicate reactions
  treated as irreversible and reversible, respectively. Enzyme names are indicated
  in italics. (B) Regulatory map of the Asp-derived amino-acid pathway in Arabidopsis
  leaf mesophyll cell. The 13 enzymes constituting the core of the system are co-expressed
  in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell chloroplasts. Isoforms exist for monofunctional AKs
  (AK1, AK2), bifunctional AKs (AKI–HSDH I and AKII–HSDH II) and DHDPS (DHDPS1 and
  2). AK3 and TS2 are not expressed in mesophyll cell chloroplasts (see ). Genes for
  ASADH, HSK, CGS and allosteric TD are present as single copies in the Arabidopsis
  genome. Enzymes shown against a white background are non-allosteric, and those with
  a yellow background are allosteric. Bifunctional AK–HSDH proteins are symbolized
  with a linker between the two domains. Continuous lines symbolize interactions of
  high apparent affinity, and broken lines symbolize interactions of low apparent
  affinity. Boxed metabolites appear explicitly in the enzyme equation models. Other
  metabolite concentrations were taken into account but are subsumed in the apparent
  rate constants (see ).
