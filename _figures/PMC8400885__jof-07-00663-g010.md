caption: 'Schematic representation of a hypothetical model for the potential defensive
  roles of benzoic acid (BA) and its hydroxylated derivatives, ρ-hydroxybenzoic acid
  (HBA) and protocatechuic acid (PCA), in tomato against A. solani. Briefly, BA and
  its hydroxylated derivatives attenuate the harmful effect of A. solani on tomato
  plants via a complex multilayered defense system that includes: (i) BA and its hydroxylated
  derivatives (HBA and PCA) might have potent antifungal activity against A. solani.
  (ii) BA and its derivatives neutralize and maintain ROS homeostasis within infected
  leaves via the induction of multilayered antioxidative machinery that includes enzymatic
  (include POX, PPO, CAT, APXs, and SODs) and non-enzymatic (phenolics, flavonoids,
  and carotenoids) antioxidant defenses. (iii) BA and its hydroxylated derivatives
  induce the SA-mediated pathway, which is implicated in ROS homeostasis and associated
  with defense response for fungal phytopathogens to reduce disease development (disease
  severity and AUDPC). The SA-mediated defense relies on two major components. The
  first component includes SA and its biosynthetic genes (PALs, AOs, and ICS), whereas
  the second component includes pathogenesis-related proteins (SlPR-1, SlPR1a2, SlPRB1-2,
  SlPR4, SlPR5, SlPR6), nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related protein 1 (SlNPR1), and
  salicylic acid-binding protein (SlSABP2). Solid lines with arrows represent positive
  reactions, whereas blunt-ended dotted lines indicate negative regulation. For more
  details and the full names and abbreviations, see the main text.'
