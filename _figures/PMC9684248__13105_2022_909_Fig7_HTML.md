caption: 'Pyroptosis in PH. The abnormal proliferation of PASMCs leads to pulmonary
  vascular remodeling. PD-L1 triggers pyroptosis of PASMCs, which contributes to hypoxia-induced
  PH. Though PD-L1 induces GSDMC-dependent pyroptosis, the specific mechanism of PD-L1-induced
  pyroptosis in PASMCs is unclear. Additionally, GLI1 induces pyroptosis of PASMCs
  under hypoxic conditions by increasing the level of ASC, which results in vascular
  remodeling. Meanwhile, increased IL-1β or IL-18 mediated by caspase-1 upregulates
  IL-6 to activate STAT3, which contributes to the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs.
  In addition, TNF-α is a classic pro-PH factor and causes PAECs dysfunction, which
  is an important cause of PH. It activates the caspase-4/11/GSDMD pathway to induce
  pyroptosis of PAECs. Meanwhile, caspase-4 also enhances pyroptosis in PAECs by activating
  the caspase-3/GSDME pathway. Consequently, pyroptosis of PAECs promotes pulmonary
  vascular resistance. Note: PH, pulmonary hypertension; PASMCs, pulmonary arterial
  smooth muscle cells; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; GLI1, glioma-associated oncogene
  homolog 1; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation
  and recruitment domain; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; PAECs, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells'
