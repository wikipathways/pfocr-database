caption: A regulatory model of ATX expression in adipose tissue and the biological
  functions of adipocyte-derived ATX in diet-induced obesity. In diet-induced obesity,
  the IL-6 family cytokines are produced from adipocytes and infiltrated immune cells
  in adipose tissue. IL-6 family cytokines upregulate ATX expression in adipocytes
  through the gp130-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. The increased production of adipocyte-derived
  ATX not only affects the biological function of adipocytes, but also results in
  elevation of plasma ATX and LPA levels to contribute to insulin resistance. The
  obesity-associated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are ameliorated by
  inhibition of gp130 signaling.
