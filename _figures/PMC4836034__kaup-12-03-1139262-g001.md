caption: The autophagy pathway and its interaction with HSV-1. Upon HSV-1 infection,
  autophagy is stimulated through the activation of an IFN-inducible EIF2AK2/PKR-EIF2S1/eIF2α
  signaling cascade, which shuts off host protein synthesis and concomitantly turns
  on autophagy by hitherto unclear mechanisms (indicated by the question mark). Autophagy
  induction sequesters cytoplasmic contents, forming autophagosomes characterized
  by the LC3-I → LC3-II conversion and ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 supercomplex association.
  As lysosomes and/or endosomes fuse, many factors contribute to the formation of
  the autolysosome, enabling degradation of contents by hydrolytic enzymes. Digested
  materials can be recycled back into the cytosol for use in energy production, protein
  manufacturing or be delivered to antigen presentation pathways in response to infection.
  As such, autophagy is shown to be able to directly capture the neuroattenuated ICP34.5-mutant
  HSV-1 virions or viral components, delivering them for lysosomal degradation and/or
  for the antigen presentation of viral peptides to the MHC-I/-II pathway for adaptive
  immune activation. To counteract the antiviral role of EIF2AK2 and cellular autophagy,
  viral protein Us11 prevents EIF2AK2-mediated EIF2S1 phosphorylation. Interestingly,
  ICP34.5 acts to reverse phosphorylated EIF2S1 by recruiting of host phosphatase
  PPP1CA/PP1α. In addition, ICP34.5 restricts autophagic initiation and maturation
  by targeting BECN1, preventing BECN1 autophagy complex formation. ICP34.5 also engages
  TBK1 to inhibit TBK1-mediated antiviral signaling, and may also prevent autophagic
  cargo recruitment through TBK1-mediated SQSTM1 phosphorylation. Although the response
  of nuclear envelope-derived autophagosomes (NEDA) can be triggered by ICP34.5-associated
  active protein translation or independently by expression of abundant viral late
  proteins (e.g., gH [glycoprotein H]), ICP34.5 can restrict the NEDA maturation that
  engages in viral antigen presentation. The interplay between the herpes pathogen
  and its host cell reflects a constant battle for control. RUBCN, RUN domain and
  cysteine-rich domain containing, Beclin 1-interacting protein; VPS, vacuolar protein
  sorting.
