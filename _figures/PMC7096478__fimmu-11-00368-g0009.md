caption: Hypothetical model of the possible mechanisms used by M. leprae to modulate
  the expression of the Notch signaling pathway in the hair follicle and their consequences.
  This figure shows how M. leprae could reduce the expression of Hes-1 in the hair
  follicle. This fact would block the activation of STAT3 and the function of stem
  cells located in the bulge, which is partially mitigated for the expression of Runx-1.
  In addition, the reduction of the Hes-1 expression could induce the loss of hair
  follicles in the skin of leprosy patients.
