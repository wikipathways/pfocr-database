caption: Role of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) in
  Alzheimer's disease onset.BACE1 is a major player in the amyloidogenic pathway.
  The enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), generating
  the soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) and the membrane-bound C-terminal
  fragment (C99). The latter peptide is then cleaved by γ-secretase to form the amyloid
  β42 peptide fragment (Aβ42), which, in turn, can aggregate and form the senile plaques,
  i.e. key neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
