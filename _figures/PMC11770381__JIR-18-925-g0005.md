caption: Overview of neutrophils in CAC. Neutrophils play a crucial role in the regulation
  of the development, progression, and metastasis of CAC through a series of intricate
  signaling pathways. ROS generated by neutrophils have been implicated in the promotion
  of CAC through various mechanisms, including the induction of epithelial cell damage,
  DNA mutations, epigenetic alterations, modulation of angiogenesis and immune suppression.
  The proteins GPX4 and MMP9 are correlated with diminished levels of ROS. Furthermore,
  MMP9 has the capacity to inhibit CAC via the MMP9-Notch1-ARF-P53 signaling pathway.
  Intestinal epithelial and tumor cells secrete neutrophil chemokines, such as CXCL1,
  which facilitate the increased infiltration of neutrophils and MDSCs. MDSCs contribute
  to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through multiple
  pathways, thereby enhancing the survival of CAC. Additionally, neutrophils may promote
  CAC through dysregulated lipid metabolism, which can lead to cell cycle arrest and
  replication errors, as well as the upregulation of MPO. The bactericidal functions
  of neutrophils confer a selective advantage to facultative anaerobes. Moreover,
  bacterial LPS can stimulate neutrophils to release NETs, which have the potential
  to capture aggregates of platelets and tumor cells, thereby facilitating CAC metastasis.
  The administration of anti-ChemR23 antibodies has been shown to impede the progression
  from chronic colitis to colorectal cancer. In murine models of IBD, CD177+ neutrophils
  have been observed to suppress tumorigenesis in intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally,
  alpha-1 antitrypsin has been demonstrated to decrease neutrophil populations in
  CAC model mice and to inhibit the transition from IBD to CAC by obstructing the
  activation of neutrophil serine proteases, thereby preventing the further progression
  of established CAC
