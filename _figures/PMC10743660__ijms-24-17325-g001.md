caption: 'Key molecular events of EMT. Epithelial tumor cells receive EMT-inducing
  signals from the tumor microenvironment, such as growth factors, low pH, hypoxia,
  and ECM modifications. EMT-inducing factors trigger various intracellular signaling
  pathways and activate EMT-TFs, which then downregulate and upregulate epithelial
  and mesenchymal markers, respectively. EMT is further sustained by autocrine loops:
  for example, inhibition of E-cadherin leads to its dissociation from β-catenin,
  which translocates to the nucleus and transactivates EMT-associated genes. Later
  stages of EMT involve transformation of both intra- and extracellular compartments.
  The formation of actin stress fibers and vimentin intermediate filaments provides
  the mechanical force for migration. The cells that have undergone EMT have multidirectional
  effects on the ECM: they disrupt the basement membrane by degrading collagen IV
  with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, but at the same time produce other
  ECM components such as collagen I and fibronectin, which further maintain EMT. Downward
  (↓) and upward (↑) arrows indicate downregulation and upregulation of expression,
  respectively'
