caption: Simplified overview of iron homeostasis. Thickness of arrows reflects amount
  of iron per compartment. In humans, daily absorption of iron, as well as iron loss,
  is minimal. Most iron is either stored, used for cellular processes or is present
  in the erythroid compartment. (A) Iron recycling within the erythroid compartment.
  Iron is incorporated in hemoglobin and recycling of iron occurs due to splenic clearance
  of senescent red blood cells. (B) Iron absorption, transport and storage. Enteral
  absorption is facilitated by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Iron is processed
  and secreted to the circulation via ferroportin (FPN), the carrier protein through
  which stored iron is also secreted from within macrophages and hepatocytes. In the
  circulation iron binds to transferrin (Tf) and cellular uptake occurs upon binding
  of Tf to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Iron is primarily stored as ferritin within
  cells. (C) Hepcidin-ferroportin axis. Hepcidin expression is predominantly induced
  by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling pathway, upon increased serum
  iron levels. Alternatively, the Janus kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of
  Transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway is activated upon inflammation through interleukin-6
  (IL-6). Hepcidin blocks FPN-dependent iron export, and induces FPN degradation,
  resulting in a limitation of iron absorption and iron efflux from body iron storages
  [].
