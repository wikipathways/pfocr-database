caption: KEGG orthology map (ko04626, plant–pathogen interaction) of common bean-Fusarium
  oxysproum f. sp. Phaseoli (FOP) pathosystem. For the treatment group, the red box
  labeled enzyme is associated with the upregulated gene, and the green box labeled
  enzyme is associated with the downregulated gene. The blue labeled enzyme is related
  to both upregulation and downregulation. This pathway map is associated with DEGs.
  The enzymes are all marked with different colors.
