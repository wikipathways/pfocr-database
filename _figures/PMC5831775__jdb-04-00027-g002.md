caption: Simplified scheme of the cilia-mediated HH signal transduction pathway in
  vertebrates. Without HH, PTC1 is located in the ciliary membrane and prevents the
  ciliary entry of SMO. As a consequence, the full-length proteins of GLI2 and GLI3,
  which are bound to the ciliary tip organizer KIF7, are phosphorylated by PKA, CK1,
  and GSK3, and finally proteolytically processed by the cilia-regulated proteasome.
  KIF7 is essential for this processing event but the mechanism by which KIF7 controls
  GLI processing remains elusive []. The products of GLI2 and GLI3 processing are
  their repressor forms (GLI2-R and GLI3-R) which enter the nucleus and block HH target
  gene expression. The repressor form of GLI3 is, thereby, predominant. In the presence
  of HH, the HH ligand binds to PTC1 and, in turn, the HH/PTC1 complex leaves the
  cilium allowing ciliary entry of SMO. By a poorly understood mechanism, SMO causes
  the conversion of the full-length GLI2 and GLI3 proteins (GLI2-FL and GLI3-FL) into
  GLI2 and GLI3 activator forms (GLI2-A and GLI3-A), which induce HH target gene expression.
