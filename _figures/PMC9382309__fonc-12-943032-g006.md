caption: DDX17 participates in the YAP signaling pathway to increase the stemness
  of cancer stem-like cells and to promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In
  tumor cells, that is, at low density, YAP is located in the nucleus and serves as
  a transcription-assisted activator to promote cell proliferation. Under hypoxic
  conditions, K190 on DDX17 undergoes K63 ubiquitination by the E3 ligase HectH9.
  YAP binds to and isolates ubiquitinated DDX17, dissociating it from the Drosha-DGCR8
  complex to block the biosynthesis of antitumor stem microRNAs (miRNAs). Meanwhile,
  ubiquitinated DDX17 forms a YAP-DDX17-p300 complex, leading to the acetylation of
  histone 3 lysine 56 (H3K56) to activate cancer-related gene transcription, resulting
  in increased stemness of cancer stem-like cells.
