caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible mechanisms through which CXCR5 regulates
  autophagy. MAPK signaling downstream of CXCR5 induced by LPS promotes the up-regulation
  of NF-κB/STAT3 axis. Consequently, activation of NF-κB/STAT3 pathway contributes
  to incomplete activation of autophagy and production of inflammatory cytokines,
  thereby impairs learning and memory function. CXCR5 down-regulation results in inhibition
  of MAPK/NF-κB/STAT3 axis and activation of autophagy in brain, which leads to the
  improved cognitive function in mice with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Atg-5
  autophagy-related gene-5, CXCR5 C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5, LC3 microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3, LPS lipopolysaccharide, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa-B, p38MAPK
  mitogen-activated protein kinase, p- phosphorylated, STAT3 signal transducer and
  activator of transcription
