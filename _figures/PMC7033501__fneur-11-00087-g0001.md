caption: Schematic signaling pathways and biosynthesis/degradation of endocannabinoids
  in microglia. When eCB bind to CB2R on the microglial cell surface, the receptor
  initiates signaling through the canonical G-protein-dependent pathway and the non-canonical
  G-protein-independent pathway. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is inhibited by the activation
  of Gi/o proteins; as a result, cAMP is reduced, followed by modulation of PKA signaling.
  Gβγ proteins activate certain calcium and potassium ion channels. Additionally,
  β-arrestin is recruited to CB2R to act as a receptor signal transducer or terminator.
  Three arms of the CB2R signaling pathway activate multiple downstream pathways,
  including several MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK). AEA and 2-AG are mainly biosynthesized
  from NAPE by NAPE-PLD and from DAG by DAGLβ, respectively. AEA is degraded to arachidonic
  acid by FAAH, which is inhibited by PF3845 and URB597. 2-AG is degraded to arachidonic
  acid by MAGL and ABHD6, which are inhibited by JZL184 and WWL70, respectively. Arachidonic
  acid is a key precursor for prostaglandins.
