caption: Sterile inflammation and formation of inflammasome. Ox-LDL increases HMGB1
  and S100A12 secretion which can bind to TLRs and RAGE to modulate inflammatory response
  via NF-κB pathway. Ox-LDL also interacts with CD36 resulting in further activation
  of macrophages. HMGB1 and S100 are DAMPs that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through
  CD36-TLR4-TLR6 complex. Activation requires a priming signal which occurs via NF-κB.
  Many processes including K+ efflux, ATP release, ROS, Cathepsin-B all play a role
  in activating NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 recruits caspase 1 which cleaves Pro-IL-1B,
  Pro-IL-18, and Gasdermin D. Gasdermin D leads to pyroptosis and release of proinflammatory
  DAMPs and cytokines further exacerbating the immune response.
