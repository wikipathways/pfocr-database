caption: Fingolimod-relevant chemical structures. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate
  (fingolimod-P) are structural analogues of sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate
  (S1P), respectively. S1P is generated via the intracellular ceramide pathway, and
  ceramide is formed through de novo biosynthesis or degradation of the cell membrane
  constituent sphingomyelin. Ceramide is N-deacetylated to yield sphingosine, and
  both sphingosine and fingolimod are phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to yield
  S1P and (S)-fingolimod-P, respectively, whereas (R)-fingolimod-P is not found in
  vivo. The (S)-fingolimod-P is the biologically active principle of the drug in animal
  models of autoimmune disease (; ).
