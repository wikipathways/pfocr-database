caption: Control of apoptosis pathways by HTLV-1 Tax. Tax-mediated activation of the
  IKK complex results in IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA/p65 to
  activate the expression of pro-survival genes. Increased expression of survivin
  and IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) efficiently inhibits caspases while cFLIP inhibits
  death receptor FAS/FASL signaling. In addition, BclxL can translocate to the mitochondria
  where it blocks Bax- and Bak-mediated release of cytochrome C and activation of
  caspases. Activation of NF-κB is also associated with the release of cytokines resulting
  in an autocrine/paracrine activation loop engaging receptor tyrosine kinase and
  activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Tax also prevents pro-apoptotic functions of
  p53
