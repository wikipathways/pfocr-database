caption: Whereas vestibular afferents encode head movements regardless of the behavioral
  goal, the responses of central neurons mediating the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)
  and of those projecting to vestibulo-spinal (ascending) pathways are differentially
  modulated by extravestibular information. a| The schematic illustrates the pathway
  that mediates the VOR reflex, which acts to stablize gaze in response to head motion.
  When the goal of the head movement is to voluntarily redirect gaze, the responses
  of central VOR neurons are suppressed. Specifically, the responses of the position-vestibular-pause
  (PVP) neurons that mediate the intermediate link in the VOR pathway are strongly
  inhibited by input from the premotor saccadic pathway that drives gaze shifts via
  its direct projections to extraocular motoneurons. This inhibition is denoted on
  the schematic as a ‘gate’ that closes when the goal is to voluntarily redirect (rather
  than stabilize) gaze. Inset illustrates the reduced the firing rate of a PVP neuron
  during a voluntary gaze shift relative to a firing rate prediction based on its
  sensitivity to the same type of head motion during the VOR The inhibitory saccadic
  drive can be accounted for by known brainstem mechanisms. Specifically, burst neurons
  in the brainstem paramedian pontine reticular formation generate a burst of spikes
  to drive horizontal saccadic eye movements, and send direct inhibitory projections
  to the vestibular nuclei, ,b| The schematic illustrates the vestibulo-spinal pathways
  that mediate postural stabilization through the vestibulo-spinal reflex (VSR), self-motion
  perception and navigation. Within this pathway, vestibular-only (VO) neurons respond
  to passive head motion. However, when the behavioral goal is to generate active
  head motion, the responses of central VO neurons are suppressed. Specifically, VO
  neurons receive a strong inhibitory cancellation signal when there is a match between
  the expected sensory consequence of the neck motor command and the actual neck proprioceptive
  feedback. Such a match functions to cancel vestibular reafference and suppress VO
  neuron responses ,,. Inset illustrates the firing rate response of a VO neuron during
  combined active and passive head motion. In this condition, monkeys generated active
  head-on-body movements (red arrow) while being passively rotated by the vestibular
  turntable (blue arrow), such that head motion is the sum of the passive sinusoidal
  stimulus and the monkey’s active head movement. The inset illustrates the selective
  cancellation of the VO neuron’s response to the active component of the head motion.
  Specifically, the neuron responds to the passive sinusoidal component of head motion
  stimulus (superimposed blue trace), but is unresponsive to the active component
  of head motion. The dashed red trace shows the firing rate prediction based on total
  head motion. c| Schematic illustrating the generation of the reafference cancellation
  signal that suppresses VO neuron activity in the cerebellum. During active movement,
  the brain computes an internal (forward) model of the expected sensory consequences
  of a motor command. This estimate is compared with the actual sensory inflow to
  compute the sensory prediction error (SPE). When there is match between expected
  and actual sensory inflow (that is, SPE= 0), vestibular reafference is suppressed,,.
