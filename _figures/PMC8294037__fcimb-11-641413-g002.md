caption: Role of the investigated genes and their functional polymorphisms in the
  p53 signaling pathway. The regulatory role of the proteins encoded by these genes
  in the expression of the other genes in the p53 signaling pathway is represented
  by dark arrows. The regulatory role of the polymorphisms in their gene expression
  is represented by gray arrows. Ultimately, the effect of these genetic variants
  on p53 expression levels and activity in the context of human neural cells infected
  by ZIKV is represented. hNPCs, human neuroprogenitor cells. Created in BioRender.com.
