caption: Role of p73 in developmental and tumor angiogenesis. During development,
  changes in the embryo microenvironment differentially regulate TAp73 and DNp73 isoforms
  that modulate specific differentiation programs. Thus, the cellular outcome of TA
  or DN p73 function will be dependent on the cellular context and will be important
  for cell fate determination, differentiation, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis.
  (A) Trp73 is required for cell fate determination and endothelial differentiation
  from mesodermal precursors and angioblasts. Embryonic stem cells that have differentiated
  into embryoid bodies (EBs) emulate vascular development. During development, mesodermal
  progenitors will give rise to the hemangioblast, a multipotent precursor of hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSC) and endothelial precursors (angioblasts). Physiological hypoxia
  and proangiogenic cues will induce endothelial differentiation and proliferation
  of angioblasts. These endothelial cells (ECs) will form a primitive vascular plexus
  (vasculogenesis). (B) In the absence of p73, formation of the plexus is impaired
  resulting in reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. ECs that differentiate within the EBs form primitive
  vascular structures. In these cells DNp73 is the predominant isoform and regulates
  migration, EC-barrier establishment, and vascular plexus formation. (C) DNp73 is
  required for angiogenic sprouting, at least in part by regulating the TGF-β signaling
  pathway. In response to local hypoxia and proangiogenic cues (VEGF), the vascular
  plexus undergoes vascular remodeling by sprouting angiogenesis. Lack of p73 impairs
  vascular plexus maturation. (D) Trp73 function is required for tumor vascularization.
  TAp73 deficiency might affect vessel stabilization, whereas DNp73 overexpression
  in tumor cells enhances their angiogenic potential.
