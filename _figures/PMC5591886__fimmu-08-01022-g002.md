caption: A model for a crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and p38
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway in the context of pemphigus.
  Both pemphigus IgG and non-IgG extracellular factors lead to ER stress resulting
  in C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) induction via protein kinase R-like ER kinase
  (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ER stress activates p38 MAPK
  through the inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1)-apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1 (ASK1)-MKK6/7 signaling pathway, and CHOP is activated by p38 MAPK. Pemphigus
  IgG binding preferentially to mature desmoglein (DSG) 1 and/or 3 activates the p38
  MAPK pathway, which in turn induces ER stress. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs),
  negative regulators of p38 MAPK activation, can be targeted by either non-IgG extracellular
  factors or intracellular regulatory factors, such as RNAs and proteins, with altered
  expression or structure. ER stress and p38 MAPK play a critical role in keratinocyte
  apoptosis, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation
  of cytokines. In addition, activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFκB) and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) by
  p38 MAPK signaling pathway positively regulates FURIN transcription, which ultimately
  facilitates the DSG maturation process. As more mature DSG becomes available on
  the keratinocyte’s plasma membrane, the entire process restarts, characterizing
  the positive feedback loop.
