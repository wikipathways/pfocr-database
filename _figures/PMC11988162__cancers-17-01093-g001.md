caption: 'Illustration of the MAPK (left) and JAK/STAT (right) signaling pathways.
  In the left panel, the MAPK signaling pathway is shown, emphasizing its critical
  role in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and response
  to stress. This pathway is activated through various receptor-mediated signals,
  including RAS, RAC, RHO, and CDC42, leading to three major downstream cascades:
  ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways. While the ERK pathway predominantly regulates cell growth
  and specialization, the JNK and p38 pathways play key roles in managing cellular
  stress, programmed cell death, and immune regulation. Activation of these pathways
  results in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as JUN,
  FOS, MYC, AP1, and ATF2, which influence gene expression and tumor progression.
  Dysregulation of MAPK pathway genes, including NF1, BRAF, AKT1, and MAPK3, has been
  implicated in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), particularly among H/L patients.
  The right panel illustrates the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription) pathway, a key intracellular signaling cascade involved in immune
  regulation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. Ligand binding to cytokine receptors
  induces the phosphorylation of JAK kinases, which subsequently activate STAT proteins
  through phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STAT dimers translocate to the nucleus,
  where they regulate gene expression involved in cell proliferation, survival, and
  immune responses. This pathway is negatively regulated by SOCS and PTPN6, which
  act as feedback inhibitors'
