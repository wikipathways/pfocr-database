caption: Noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. In the noncanonical
  pathway, NIK has an important role in the phosphorylation and activation of IκB
  kinase α (IKK-α). IKK-α phosphorylates p100 that exists in an inactive complex with
  RelB. Phosphorylated p100 is partially cleaved to generate the active form p52.
  The p52/RelB heterodimer enters the nucleus and regulates the expression of several
  genes distinct from those activated by the canonical pathway. IKK, inhibitory kappa
  B kinase; NIK, nuclear factor kappa B–inducing kinase.
