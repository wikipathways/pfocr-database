caption: Nicks that do not get repaired by short patch BER may be channeled into one
  of two branches of the LP BER pathway. (i) The Polβ-dependent, Polδ/Polε-independent
  branch. Nick processing is carried out by Polβ, a poorly processive polymerase with
  weak strand-displacement activity. The resultant small flaps are processed by FEN1
  to generate a ligatable 5’ end that still contains a few additional flap bases (shown
  in orange). (ii) The Polβ/Polδ/Polε-dependent branch. Since both Polδ and Polε are
  more processive than Polβ, more strand slippage and more extensive strand displacement
  may result. Repriming of DNA synthesis on the slipped-strand using Polβ would not
  remove looped out bases (shown in red) since Polβ lacks a suitable proofreading
  activity. Limited strand displacement by Polβ or more extensive strand displacement
  by Polδ/Polε, followed by FEN1 cleavage could also result a ligatable end that still
  contains some flap bases (shown in orange). In either case, repair synthesis initiated
  on the complementary strand would fix the supernumerary bases into the derivative
  allele thus generating either a small (i) or large (ii) expansion. MMR proteins
  may facilitate this process by stabilizing the hairpins. These proteins may also
  directly generate expansions by channelling the hairpins formed during BER into
  the MMR pathway.
