caption: NO, CO, and O2 sensing by the Mtb Dos dormancy three-component system. Schematic
  representation of the Mtb heme sensor kinases DosS (A) and DosT (B) that are responsive
  to the in vivo gas ligands NO, CO, and O2. (A) One model proposes that DosS is in
  the inactive state when ferrous heme iron is oxidized by environmental O2 to produce
  met (Fe3+) heme. The autokinase activity of DosS is activated when met heme is reduced
  by a cellular redox couple (e.g., FdxA, chorismate synthase, vitamin C). Another
  model proposes that DosS is in the oxy (“off”) state and is activated by loss of
  O2 (e.g., during hypoxia) to generate ferrous DosS. When NO or CO (host gases produced
  by iNOS and HO-1, respectively) are the ligands, NO-DosS and CO-DosS are generated,
  which keep DosS in a “locked”, activated state. Because of the stability of the
  gas complexes, DosS (and DosT) is provided with an additional level of regulation.
  (B) DosT is proposed to be in an inactive Fe-O2 form. During hypoxic conditions,
  bound O2 is released from DosT, leading to the formation of active, ferrous DosT.
  Again, NO and CO can keep DosT in a “locked” state by generating CO-DosT or NO-DosT.
  The active forms of DosS and DosT in turn activate the Dos regulator DosR, which
  leads to the induction of the Dos dormancy regulon. NO, CO, and hypoxia induces
  the exact same 47-member transcriptional response in Mtb and is known as the Dos
  dormancy regulon. The Dos dormancy regulon encodes many genes of unknown function,
  as well for members of the nitrate reductase pathway, several universal stress proteins,
  and various transporter proteins. (To see this illustration in color the reader
