caption: The process of human steroidogenesis. Through a series of different chemical
  reactions, cholesterol can be converted into cortiocosterone/aldosterone, cortisol
  and sex hormones, respectively. The process is delicately regulated by various catalysts
  and signaling pathways. The arrows indicate the direction of the biosynthesis, catalyzed
  by different enzymes. Androgens such as androstenedione and testosterone can be
  converted into female sex hormones such as estrone and estradiol by CYP19A1. Dihydrotestosterone
  can be converted into androsterone through a series of different reactions with
  multiple catalysts involved, shown with “…” below the lowest arrow
