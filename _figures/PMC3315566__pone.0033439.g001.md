caption: 'Cluster I: two genes for formate dehydrogenase (fdhF) are organized together
  with three copies of a FeS-containing subunit of a [FeFe]-hydrogenase (hycB), a
  formate dehydrogenase accessory protein (fdhD) and another subunit of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase
  (hydA2). Cluster II: genes for formyl-THF synthetase (fhs1), methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase
  (fchA), methylene-THF dehydrogenase (folD) and methylene-THF reductase (metF, metV)
  are organized together with a RnfC-similar protein (rnfC2). Cluster III: genes for
  the subunits of the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl CoA synthase complex consisting of CO
  dehydrogenase (acsA), acetyl-CoA synthase (acsB1), corrinoid-iron sulfur protein
  (acsCD) and methyltransferase (acsE) are organized together with two copies of a
  CODH nickel-insertion accessory protein (cooC), a corrinoid activation/regeneration
  protein (acsV) and two hypothetical proteins (Orf1 and Orf2).'
