caption: (A) Full mechanistic diagram of JAK/STAT pathway (B) Cross-repression system
  of APT and SLBO. STAT activates apt and slbo transcription leading to the production
  of apt and slbo mRNA and translation into APT and SLBO proteins. SLBO represses
  apt translation while APT suppresses slbo transcription and function. High APT levels
  make the cell stationary and high SLBO levels make the cell motile. However, which
  state dominates cannot be determined from this qualitative diagram alone.
