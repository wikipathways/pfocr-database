caption: Construction of sgRNA arrays using a restriction digest-based modular assembly.
  Plasmids pSECRi-P, -F, -L, and -A encode individual sgRNAs that are flanked by AgeI
  and XmaI on the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. These flanking restriction sites in
  all pSECRi plasmids allow us to connect any two sgRNAs by ligating a plasmid backbone
  digested with NcoI and AgeI to an insert fragment obtained by digestion with NcoI
  and XmaI. The resulting plasmid (pSECRi-PF, or -LA) harbors a two-sgRNA array that
  again is flanked by AgeI and XmaI on the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. We should
  mention that AgeI and XmaI have compatible cohesive ends and ligation of both DNA
  fragments digested with AgeI and XmaI generates a new restriction site that is not
  cleavable by both restriction enzymes. A two-sgRNA array can be joined to the array
  by ligating a plasmid backbone digested with NcoI and AgeI to an insert digested
  with NcoI and XmaI, resulting in a pSECRi-PFLA. All sgRNAs are under the control
  of J23119 promoter (P1–P4)
