caption: Pathway from hippocampal molecular defects to AD neurotoxicity. Proteomic
  analysis of subcellular organelles showed that many proteins were differentially
  expressed in mitochondria and nuclei, including ETC-related proteins, mitochondrial
  division-regulated proteins, oxidative stress-related proteins, and synaptic-related
  proteins, which in concert, correlate with neurodegeneration in the 3xTg-AD mouse
  model of Alzheimer disease. Protein dynamin-1 (DYN1) is a candidate for an early
  biomarker of AD.
