caption: Strategy for metabolic cell selection for defects in the sialic acid pathway.
  The sialic acid pathway beginning with UDP-GlcNAc proceeds by the sequential action
  of (a,b) UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase; (c) sialic acid 9-phosphate synthase;
  (d) sialic acid 9-phosphatase; (e) CMP-sialic acid synthetase; (f) CMP-sialic acid
  Golgi transporter; and (g) sialyltransferase (several in human); to install a sialic
  acid on glycoconjugates destined for the cell surface. The substrate-based cell
  selection approach begins with (1) the interception of the pathway with ManLev,
  an unnatural analog of ManNAc. The pathway converts this unnatural substrate into
  glycan-bound SiaLev containing a selectable marker, the ketone (2). The ketone can
  be selectively labeled with biotin hydrazide and the cells stained with FITC-labeled
  avidin (3). Sorting of low-SiaLev cells (shown, or high-SiaLev cells, not shown)
  by flow cytometry (4) allows for the high-throughput selection of cells harboring
  rare metabolic mutations. After sorting, cells are allowed to recover and then the
  sorted cell population is analyzed for ketone expression (5). These five steps are
  repeated iteratively until the desired phenotypic endpoint of high- or low-SiaLev
  expression is obtained.
