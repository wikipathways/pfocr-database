caption: Model for regulation of the TrkAI and KdpFABC systems. The findings of this
  study strongly suggest that the TrkAI system is unable to function in the symbiotic
  state and that kdpFABC expression is repressed by high extracellular K+ concentrations
  via TrkJ. The details are described in the Discussion section in the main text.
