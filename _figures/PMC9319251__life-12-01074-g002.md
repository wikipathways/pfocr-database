caption: Metabolic mechanisms of hyperglycemia in distal symmetrical polyneuropathy
  in diabetes. This cross-sectional diagram of a peripheral myelinated sensory neuron
  depicts the various hypothesized metabolic mechanisms of hyperglycemia (polyol,
  glycation, protein kinase C, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and hexosamine pathways)
  and their interconnection, which are critical in DSPN pathogenesis and neuronal
  dysfunction. As shown, only the glycation pathway via AGEs acts on an extracellular
  level, while the others act on an intracellular level. Blue labels represent molecules
  and red labels represent neuropathic outcomes. ↑ refers to an increase and ↓ refers
  to a decrease. AGEs, advanced glycation end products; ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NA+, sodium ion; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide plus hydrogen; Na+/K+-ATPase, sodium–potassium
  ATPase; NF-ĸB, nuclear factor kappa B; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PKC,
  protein kinase C, RAGEs, receptors for advanced glycation end products; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; Sp1, specificity protein 1; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.
