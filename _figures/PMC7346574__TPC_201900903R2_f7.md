caption: Schematic Model of Hypothetical Relationships Between ASTREL Genes and Known
  Biotic and Abiotic Stress Pathways in Arabidopsis.The model is based on literature
  review and available gene expression of potential interactions of ASTREL genes within
  the known Arabidopsis biotrophic pathogen disease resistance genetic pathway.
