caption: Homologous recombination (HR) and pathway choices. The pathways of double-strand
  break (DSB) repair include nonhomologous endjoing (NHEJ), alternative endjoining
  (aEJ, also called microhomology-mediated endjoining), which are differentiated whether
  the joint involves no or few nucleotides (1–5 nt) or greater (∼5–25 nt) homology.
  Single-strand annealing (SSA) is possible when the DSB is flanked by direct repeat
  sequences and requires extensive resection. HR includes several subpathways including
  break-induced replication (BIR), which leads to loss of heterozygosity, synthesis-dependent
  strand-annealing (SDSA), which leads to a noncrossover outcome, and the double Holliday
  junction pathway (dHJ), which through nucleolytic resolution of dHJs generates crossover
  and noncrossovers outcomes. Dissolution of dHJs, in contrast, leads exclusively
  to noncrossover products. One-sided DSBs result from passing of a replication fork
  through a nicked template. DSB repair by NHEJ/aEJ will lead to a genomic rearrangement,
  whereas HR repairs such damage with high fidelity. Addition of telomeres to any
  DSB leads to loss of the distal chromosomal DNA. Replication-associated DNA gaps
  can result from lesions that block DNA polymerases. Bypass of such lesions by translesion
  DNA polymerases (translesion synthesis) is mutagenic, whereas HR provides lesion
  tolerance with high fidelity. For replication forks with their leading strand blocked,
  fork regression (formation of a chicken foot) and the associated template switch
  provides another pathway of lesion bypass (not shown). MMEJ, Microhomology-mediated
  endjoining.
