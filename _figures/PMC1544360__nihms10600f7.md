caption: A simplified repression model of angptl3 promoter activity by PPARβ. (A)
  LXRα regulates the angptl3 promoter activity (; ). RXRα facilitates binding of type
  2 nuclear receptors to their response elements. Activation by LXRα ligand disassociates
  repressors N-COR/SMART () and promotes association with co-activator (). (B) PPARβ
  is also a partner for RXRα. Therefore, activated PPARβ interfers the binding of
  LXRα to the LXR response element DR4 in the angptl3 promoter. L165041-activated
  PPARβ may result in higher affinity binding to RXRα. (C) Increased cellular levels
  of RXRα overcomes the inhibition by PPARβ leading to sufficient LXRα/RXRα for binding
  to the DR4. Thus, RXRα not only facilitates binding to the DR4 element but also
  may contribute to the additive effect of LXRα-transcriptional activity through an
  unknown pathway.
