caption: 'Normal copper metabolism.Cu is primarily absorbed in the small intestine
  and enters hepatocytes through the transporter CTR1. Excess Cu is stored in the
  liver by MT, while surplus Cu is released into the bloodstream with the mediation
  of ATP7B. In the blood, Cu binds to ceruloplasmin and is transported to the brain.
  Cu crosses the BBB via the action of CTR1 and is released into the brain parenchyma
  by ATP7A. Inside neurons and glial cells, STEAP converts Cu²⁺ to Cu¹⁺, which then
  enters the cells through the mediation of CTR1 and DMT1. Most Cu¹⁺ is either delivered
  to ATP7A/B located on the TGN or transferred to the nucleus, facilitated by ATOX1.
  In the nucleus, the Cu chaperone protein CCS delivers Cu to SOD1, which breaks down
  superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Additionally, Cu participates
  in mitochondrial respiratory chains and redox pathways by binding to CCO. COX17
  binds Cu and transfers it to SCO1 or COX11, enabling Cu to be transferred to CCO.
  Finally, excessive Cu is expelled through ATP7A/B and can be released into the CSF
  or transported to the choroid plexus epithelial cells via DMT1 and CTR1. Alternatively,
  it can be transported back into the bloodstream by ATP7A. Created with Microsoft
