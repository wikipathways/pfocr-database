caption: Model for CsrABb regulation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway activation. We
  propose that CsrABb regulates the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway via the
  modulation of the level of Pta (BB0589). During the stationary phase, CsrABb reaches
  the maximum level and acts as a repressor to turn off the expression of Pta, which
  results in less conversion of acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-CoA and an increase in
  the intracellular level of acetyl-phosphate. An increased intracellular level of
  acetyl-phosphate leads to the autophosphorylation of Rrp2, which in turn activates
  the RpoN-RpoS cascade as well as the downstream RpoS-dependent genes. In the absence
  of CsrABb, the level of Pta is dysregulated and results in an enhanced conversion
  of acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-CoA. A low intracellular level of acetyl-phosphate
  prevents the autophosphorylation of Rrp2 and the activation of its downstream regulatory
  pathway.

  description: Model for CsrABb regulation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway activation.
    We propose that CsrABb regulates the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway

    CsrABb reaches the maximum level and acts as a repressor to turn off the expression

    In the absence of CsrABb, the level of Pta is dysregulated and results in an enhanced

    prevents the autophosphorylation of Rrp2 and the activation of its downstream
