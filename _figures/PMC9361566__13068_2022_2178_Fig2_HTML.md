caption: In vivo framework converting C1 feedstocks to aldehydes. Seven in vivo pathways
  converting CO2 to either pyruvate or acetyl-CoA might be employed to form aldehydes,
  which are important platform chemicals for value-added products such as primary
  amines, alkanes, and alcohols, etc. These pathways include reductive TCA (rTCA)
  cycle, Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/HB)
  cycle, Wood–Ljungdahl (reductive acetyl-CoA) pathway (WLP), reductive glycine pathway
  (rGlyP), 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) bicycle and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
  (HP/HB) cycle. Each pathway is distributed within a sector with a color of the background.
  The dashed line indicates steps consisting of multiple reactions while the solid
  line indicates one step
