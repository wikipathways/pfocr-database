caption: Comparison networks between two separate MeSH term categories. Intersection
  between C14 and C17 networks (a) as well C15 and C20 networks (b) yield statistically
  significant overlap (p = 1E-28, p = 1E-12, respectively). KEGG pathways colored
  according to MeSH categorization. (see abbreviations in Fig. )
