caption: Schematic description of CQ suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis
  through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the Warburg effect in colorectal
  cancer. CQ specifically binds to CHKA and PFKM, inhibiting their expressions and
  enzyme activities and restricting the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, thereby inhibiting
  the PI3K/AKT pathway and the Warburg effect, exerting its anti-CRC effect
