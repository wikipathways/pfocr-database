caption: The diagrams represent the interaction of Cdon, Boc, and Gas1 with Ptch and
  Shh during Shh-mediated patterning of the ventral neural tube in wild-type embryos
  ( A) or in embryos with genetic inactivation of either Cdon or Gas1 function ( B)
  or lacking Cdon, Boc, and Gas1 ( C). The three co-receptors interact with Ptch and
  the complex binds Shh with high affinity. In the presence of Shh, Smo is de-repressed
  (red crosses) and activates a signal transduction cascade that culminates with Gli-mediated
  transcription of Shh target genes. The Cdon/Ptch and Boc/Ptch interactions are mediated
  by the FnIIIa and FnIIIb domains (green) of Cdon and Boc, respectively. Binding
  of Shh to Cdon or Boc is mediated by the FnIIIc domain (pink). ( B) In the absence
  of either Cdon or Gas1, Shh is less activated (dotted red crosses), resulting in
  mild craniofacial defects. ( C) Loss of all three co-receptors prevents pathway
  activation, resulting in severe HPE, a phenotype that mimics Shh loss of function.
  Boc, Brother of Cdon; Cdon, cell adhesion molecule-related, downregulated by oncogenes;
  Gas1, growth arrest protein 1; HPE, holoprosencephaly; Ptch, patched; Shh, sonic
  hedgehog; Smo, smoothened.
