caption: 'The choice between feeding trophozoite and dormant cyst stage is controlled
  by cAMP binding to PkaR causing dissociation from and activation of PkaC. cAMP is
  synthesized by adenylate cyclases, which may be activated directly by stress. cAMP
  is hydrolyzed by the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA, which is respectively activated
  by sensor histidine kinases that sense food, or inhibited by sensor histidine phosphatases
  that sense stress. Violet: components that are conserved in Amoebozoa and Excavata,
  blue: conserved in Amoebozoa, Teal or pink, conserved in only dictyostelia or Excavata,
  respectively. Arrow: stimulates; crossbar: inhibits.'
