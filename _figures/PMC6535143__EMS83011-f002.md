caption: The CaSR is functionally active as a constitutive homodimer, and may also
  form heterodimers with other family C GPCRs such as the metabotropic glutamate receptors
  and gamma-amino butryric acid (GABA) type B receptors in growth plate chondrocytes
  and the central nervous system–. The CaSR ECD binds calcium (Ca2+) at multiple sites
  within the lobes of the venus flytrap (VFT) and cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The
  CaSR also binds amino acids within the VFT cleft. Synthetic positive allosteric
  modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) bind to the CaSR transmembrane
  domain (TMD). The binding of Ca2+ leads to Gq/11-dependent activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC) and the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) from membrane bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The increase
  in intracellular IP3 levels facilitates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores
  such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) and
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The CaSR also activates the
  Gi/o protein, which leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC)-mediated production
  of cAMP. These signalling events cause a decrease in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion
  and reduction in renal tubular Ca2+ reabsorption. CaSR cell-surface expression is
  regulated by agonist-driven insertional signalling (ADIS), which mediates anterograde
  receptor trafficking; and also by an endocytic complex comprising clathrin, β-arrestin
  and the heterotetrameric adaptor-related protein complex 2 (AP2) complex, which
  mediates retrograde receptor trafficking. Loss- and gain-of function mutations of
  the CaSR lead to FHH1 and ADH1, respectively; loss- and gain-of function mutations
  of the Gα11 subunit are associated with FHH2 and ADH2, respectively; and loss-of-function
  mutations of the AP2σ subunit are associated with FHH3.
