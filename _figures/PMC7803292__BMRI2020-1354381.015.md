caption: The involvement of the Akt and Kras pathway in breast cancer. Akt and Kras
  pathways were majorly involved in the progression of breast cancer. These two pathways
  were regulated by TPD52, miR-124, KLF3, PKCε, and several other downstream effectors.
  The deregulated expression of TPD52, KLF3, miR-124, and PKCε led to the overexpression
  of these two oncogenic pathways which in turn promoted cell survival and proliferation.
  Moreover, the partner genes of KLF3, TPD52, miR-124, and PKCε were extracted through
  STRING software [].
