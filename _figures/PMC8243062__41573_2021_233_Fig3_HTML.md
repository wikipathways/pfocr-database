caption: (1) Transcription factor NRF2 is constantly synthesized in cells but its
  transport to the nucleus remains low under basal conditions. This is due to its
  degradation through association with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1),
  which facilitates its degradation by the 26S proteasome. Boosting NRF2 synthesis
  represents a therapeutic antioxidant approach. (2) Upon exposure to electrophiles,
  KEAP1 is alkylated and loses its ability to cause degradation of NRF2. Using non-toxic
  electrophiles to alkylate KEAP1 represents another major therapeutic approach. For
  KEAP1, SH is the thiol form and SX denotes the adduct formed with the electrophile
  (X). (3) In a parallel pathway glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylates
  NRF2, which with β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) is degraded by the
  proteasome, a process that is inhibited by oxidative inactivation of GSK3β. The
  interaction of NRF2 and βTrCP is disrupted owing to oxidant-mediated inhibition
  of GSK3β and the phosphorylation of NRF2 at the Deh6 domain. Inhibiting GSK3β is
  another potential therapeutic approach to modulate NRF2 signalling. (4) Oxidation-induced
  KEAP1 degradation also occurs through p62-mediated sequestration of KEAP1 and autophagy,
  a process initiated by phosphorylation of p62 via TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). p62 therefore provides another
  potential therapeutic target. Newly synthesized NRF2 that escapes degradation is
  translocated into the nucleus where it binds to EpRE sequences in the promoters
  of antioxidant genes and increases their expression. NRF2 activity is also positively
  regulated through NRF2 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and its interaction
  with other proteins such as p21 (ref.) and BRCA1 (ref.). (5) In the nucleus, BACH1
  negatively regulates NRF2 activity by competing to form heterodimers with small
  Maf (sMaf) or Jun proteins and binding to the electrophile response element (EpRE)–.
  Thus, compounds that inhibit BACH1 offer an alternative therapeutic approach for
  increasing expression of some NRF2-regulated genes. Other negative regulators of
  NRF2, which represent potential therapeutic targets include HRD1, CRIF1, progerin
  and microRNA for NRF2 (ref.).
