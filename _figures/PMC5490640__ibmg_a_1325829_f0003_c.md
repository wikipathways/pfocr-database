caption: Ubiquitin enzymes in the TCR signaling pathway. Antigen binding to the TCR
  leads to the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase LCK, which phosphorylates the TCR
  signaling chain CD3ζ, which recruits ZAP70. Subsequent phosphorylation of LAT and
  SLP-76 by ZAP70 triggers activation of PLCγ1, cleaving PIP2 to IP3, and DAG. IP3
  and DAG activate NF-κB, AP-1, and NFAT via the protein kinase PKCθ, RAS, and calcium,
  respectively. NF-κB and AP-1 activation is mediated by the CBM complex, consisting
  of CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1, which cooperates with an E3 and the Lys 63-specific
  E2 dimer UBC13/UEV1A. Ubiquitination of BCL10 leads to the recruitment of the TAB2/TAB1/TAK1
  complex and the IKK complex for NF-κB and JNK activation. E3 ligases are indicated
  in red, DUBs in purple, and transcription factors in green (see color version of
  this figure at www.tandfonline.com/ibmg).
