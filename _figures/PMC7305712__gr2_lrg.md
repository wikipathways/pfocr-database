caption: Altered signaling and pathogenic mechanisms in hepatocytes during NAFLD progression
  a) insulin signaling in healthy hepatocytes suppress endogenous glucose production
  through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and increasing glycogen synthesis b) steatotic
  hepatocytes are characterized by disturbed lipid metabolism i.e., 1) there is increase
  in FFA influx which enters the liver through fatty acid transport proteins (FATP)
  and leads to 2) increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, 3) formation of lipid
  toxic intermediates e.g. sn 1,2 DAG which stimulates PKCε to phosphorylate Thr1160
  in insulin receptor leading to hepatic insulin resistance i.e., increased gluconeogenesis
  and decreased glycogen synthesis. Again, FFA metabolites e.g. acetyl CoA could directly
  stimulate gluconeogenesis [] 4) increased glucose enters the liver mainly through
  glucose transporter (GLUT2) and activates ChREBP pathway. Insulin-signaling activates
  SREBP1C pathway too. Both pathways increase DNL c) after progression to NASH, mitochondrial
  flexibility is lost leading to decreased fatty acid oxidation. Together with other
  toxic intermediate lipid, ER stress and ROS generation increase leading to hepatocytes
  death and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. AKT, protein kinase
