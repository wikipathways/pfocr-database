caption: Black and red edges are respectively part of the prior knowledge and novel.
  Edge labels represent the frequencies of their respective edges. Many novel interactions
  appear in at least some of the 103 models, but most of them with low frequencies.
  The interactions involving apex and inner however both have frequencies of 1. This
  confirms that the variables apex and inner, as they were defined, would be able
  to explain the patterning of the auxin signaling pathway and TFL1, respectively,
  although additional work would be needed to explain how apex and inner can be defined
  molecularly. This also shows that no way to substitute apex or inner with other
  variables could be found, unless it would involve substantially more novel interactions.
