caption: Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3-blue) is not only involved in glycogen
  synthase (GS) regulation, but also acts as a downstream component of the Wnt signaling
  pathway (e.g. ). Glycogen Phosphorylase (GP) breaks up glycogen into glucose subunits.
  Hexokinase (Hex-red) is involved in producing Glucose-6-P from glucose, acting as
  an important enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. Other Glucose-6-P possible roles
  in different metabolic pathways are omitted for simplicity.
