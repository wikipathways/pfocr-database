caption: Reactions catalyzed by the transsulfuration pathway enzymes. (A) The canonical
  reactions catalyzed by CBS and CSE. (B) The preferred H2S-generating reactions via
  condensation of cysteine and homocysteine (by CBS) and α,β-elimination of cysteine
  (by CSE). (C) Formation of Cys−SSH from cystine by CBS or CSE and Hcy−SSH from homocystine
  by CSE.
