caption: (A) Schematic representation of EndMT regulated by different signaling pathways.
  Extrinsic signals stimulate endothelial cells to undergo EndMT through ligands binding
  to various receptors such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), transforming growth
  factor receptor (TGFBR), and NOTCH receptor. Once getting activated, these pathways
  either independently trigger unknown mechanisms or work in concert through common
  pathway intermediates like SMAD2/3, thereby activating EndMT transcription factor,
  which leads to loss of endothelial cell characteristics, i.e. expression of VE-Cadherin.
  The presence of BMP7 can activate the BMP pathway through binding to bone morphogenetic
  protein receptors (BMPR), thereby activating SMAD1/5/8 which can block the EndMT-inducing
  signals to ultimately maintain endothelial cell characteristics.
