caption: Modulation of Anoxic Pathway Activities in Single and Double ack/pat Mutants.Summary
  of altered metabolic pathway activities in the indicated mutants relative to the
  wild-type control strain. Blue represents attenuated pathway activities in the respective
  mutants; red represents increased pathway activities in the indicated mutants; dashed
  arrows represent catalytic steps that were omitted in the transfer of electrons
  from PFR1 to the hydrogenases.
