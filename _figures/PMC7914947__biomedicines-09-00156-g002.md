caption: 'The activation of human inositol-requiring enzyme type 1α (IRE1α)-dependent
  signaling pathway with its downstream targets. The IRE1α activation occurs upon
  association of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) with misfolded protein and its
  subsequent dissociation from IRE1α, or alternatively upon direct binding of misfolded
  protein by the N-terminal luminal domain (NLD) of IRE1α. The following oligomerization,
  often of more than four IRE1α molecules, is required for further trans-autophosphorylation
  process and activation of kinase and RNase domains. The full kinase/RNase activity
  positively correlates with the increasing number of IRE1α oligomers. Activated IRE1α
  induces the following cellular processes: The unconventional splicing of x-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) and TNF Receptor Associated
  Factor 2/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase4/7/c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase/p38 (TRAF2/ASK1/MKK4/7/JNK/p38) signaling pathway. The pro-survival
  or pro-apoptotic effect of IRE1α activation is exerted by selective induction of
  its specific branches and depends on numerous factors, mainly the severity and timing
  of cellular stress conditions.'
