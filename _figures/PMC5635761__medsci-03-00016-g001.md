caption: 'Possible Nucleic acid sensors participation in HBV pattern sensing in the
  life cycle of HBV. Various forms of nucleic acid are generated during the life cycle
  of HBV including the single stranded RNAs, double-stranded rc DNA/ccc DNA, or the
  double stranded RNAs. The cytosolic DNA receptors including cGAS, DDX41, IFI16,
  AIM2 and DAI may recognize the cytosolic DNA and activate the ER bound STING-TBK1-IRF3
  axis to induce type I IFN production. While the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) including
  RIG-I and MDA5 activate the TBK1-IRF3 axis via mitochondria bound MAVS as adaptor
  protein upon the binding to cytosolic RNA. The four Toll-like receptor (TLR) family
  members: TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 are located in the endosome, where they detect double
  stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA or non-methylated CpG DNA, respectively, leading
  to activation of TICAM-1 and MyD88 dependent pathways and the up-regulation of type
  I IFN. The HBV viral proteins seem to block the activation of the cytosolic RNA-sensing
  pathway as well as the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways. Studies show that the HBV
  DNA could activate the ER bound STING and TBK1 in the hepatocytes and cytosolic
  RNA-sensing is dispensable in limiting the HBV propagation in the mice receiving
  liver specific in vivo transfection of the replicative HBV genome [,].'
