caption: A. Schematic representation of TGF-β family pathway activation and action.
  Dimeric ligand binding induces assembly of two type I- and two type II-receptors
  into a hexameric signaling complex, allowing the type II receptors to activate the
  type I receptors by phosphorylation. The active type I receptors in turn phosphorylate
  R-SMADs, which then form trimeric complexes with SMAD4, translocate to the nucleus
  and regulate gene expression. R-SMADs are divided in two functionally different
  branches, the SMAD1/5/8 branch (a.k.a. “the BMP-pathway”), and the SMAD2/3 branch
  (a.k.a. “the Activin/TGF-β-pathway”). Ligands on the left side are colored blue,
  on the right side they are colored green to represent their pathway selectivity.
  Downstream gene regulation, therefore, depends on which type I receptor forms part
  of the active signaling complexes. B. The TGF-β/activin and the BMP subfamilies
  each share a subset of type I receptors and downstream effector SMADs. Notably,
  the family has over 33 ligand genes in humans but only five type II and seven type
  I receptors, indicating that there is substantial overlap in receptor utilization.
