caption: Regulatory modes of alternative splicing events during flowering transition.
  (A) Development and environmental regulation of alternative splicing. The alternative
  splicing patterns of the Arabidopsis FLM and the Brachypodium FT2 are modulated
  by temperature and plant aging signals, respectively, altering the molar ratios
  of alternatively spliced RNA isoforms. (B) Differential stability of the alternatively
  spliced protein isoforms of CO. While COα is targeted by the HOS1 and COP1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligases under red light and dark conditions, respectively, COβ is resistant to the
  ubiquitin-mediated degradation process. (C) Constitutive occurrence of alternative
  splicing in the autonomous flowering pathway. FCA is a central component of the
  autonomous flowering pathway. Its alternative splicing produces several transcript
  isoforms. It is currently unclear whether and how its alternative splicing is modulated
  by developmental cues or environmental stimuli.
