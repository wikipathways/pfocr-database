caption: 'Controlling Inflamm-ageing: a possible treatment approach for COVID-19 in
  older people. Multiple age-related diseases occur with increasing age. (A) Inflamm-ageing
  contributes to many age-related diseases for example, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid
  arthritis, diabetes and Alzheimer’s Disease, and is associated with poor health
  status. (B) Several potential mechanisms that might contribute to inflamm-ageing
  include genetic susceptibility, central obesity, reduced autophagy, mitochondrial
  dysfunction, cellular senescence and SASP, inflammasome NLRP3 activation, changes
  to microbiota, oxidative stress, DNA damage. (C) The signalling pathways that link
  age-related diseases and inflamm-ageing join a common downstream signalling pathway
  causing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and resulting in activation of a low
  grade pro-inflammatory cytokine-related, sterile inflammation. (D) Researchers are
  developing re-purposed drugs and new molecules to improve understanding of the cellular
  pathways involved in inflamm-ageing. Evidence is becoming available as to how conventional
  drugs such as metformin used in diabetes and behaviour changes such as exercise,
  diet or episodic fasting, together with monoclonal antibodies, can be shown to reduce
  inflamm-ageing and improve disease management. OP, osteoporosis, RA, rheumatoid
  arthritis, PD, Parkinsons Disease, Alz, Alzheimers Disease, HT, hypertension, CVD,
