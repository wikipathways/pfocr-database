caption: Scheme summarizing the involvement of human Tc2 cells in PGD2 autocrine production
  and tissue remodeling mediated by PGD2/DP2 axis. Activation of DP2 by PGD2 causes
  multiple gene upregulations, including proinflammatory cytokines (IL-3/4/5/13, GM-CSF,
  and M-CSF), adhesion molecules (ICAM and PECAM) and protissue remodeling proteins
  (IL-1α, Fn14, TrkA, NRP1, GDN, and TNF-α). These protissue remodeling proteins can
  enhance fibroblast proliferation and activation that also produce protissue remodeling
  proteins (TGF-β, vimentin, collagen I α1, and actin α2), leading to myofibroblast
  differentiation. Activation of DP2 also activates PGD2synthesis pathway in Tc2 cells,
  leading to IgE-independent PGD2 autocrine production, which in turn further activate
  DP2. Fevipiprant, competitive binding to DP2, attenuates both PGD2 autocrine and
  protissue remodeling roles in Tc2 cells. AA, arachidonic acid; GDN, glia-derived
  nexin; PGH2, PG H2.
