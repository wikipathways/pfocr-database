  HPV or adenoviruses drive E7 or E1A oncoprotein expression. These proteins act as
  STING antagonists able to inhibit the STING pathway, possibly leading to their evasion
  from immune cells()B) Spontaneous epigenetic silencing of STING signaling components
  is also observed in various cancer types()C) Tumor DNA damage leads to Natural Killer
  cell activation through STING-dependent expression of RAE1().D) MUS81 endonuclease
  induces genomic DNA cleavage and accumulation followed by STING, type I IFN and
  CD8 T cell dependent rejection of tumor cells()
