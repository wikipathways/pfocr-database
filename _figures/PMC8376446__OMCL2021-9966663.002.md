caption: Diagrammatic illustration of the experimental protocol. The treatment protocol
  was performed for 15 days. In all these groups, a loading dose of PTZ (40 mg/kg,
  IP) was injected 30 mins after drug treatment (ATRA, carveol, or diazepam), except
  in the saline group. Brain tissues were collected after 24 h of the last dose for
  further analysis.
