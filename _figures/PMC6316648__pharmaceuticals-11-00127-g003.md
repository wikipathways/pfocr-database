caption: Major mechanisms for hepcidin regulation. Serum and tissue iron induce hepcidin
  transcription via the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway. The cascade is initiated following
  an increase in transferrin saturation and the secretion of BMP6 from liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cells; BMP2 is likewise secreted from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
  but is less responsive to iron. Diferric transferrin binds to TfR2, while BMP6 and
  BMP2 bind to type I and II BMP receptors on hepatocytes. These events trigger phosphorylation
  of regulatory SMAD1/5/8, recruitment of SMAD4, and translocation of the SMAD complex
  to the nucleus for activating hepcidin transcription upon binding to BMP response
  elements in the HAMP promoter. Efficient iron signaling to hepcidin requires the
  BMP co-receptor HJV and the hemochromatosis protein HFE, and is negatively regulated
  by the transmembrane serine protease matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6). Under conditions of
  high iron demand for erythropoiesis, the erythropoietic regulator erythroferrone
  (ERFE) is released from bone marrow erythroblasts and suppresses hepcidin by sequestering
  BMP6. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 induces hepcidin transcription via the JAK/STAT3
  signaling pathway. The binding of IL-6 triggers dimerization of IL-6 receptors on
  hepatocytes, which leads to activation of associated JAK1/2 and subsequent phosphorylation
  of STAT3. Phospho-STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates
  hepcidin transcription upon binding to a STAT binding site in the HAMP promoter.
  Efficient hepcidin induction by the inflammatory pathway requires a threshold of
  BMP6/SMAD signaling (indicated by the dotted lines). BMP, Bone Morphogenetic Protein;
  SMAD, Small Mothers Against Decapentaplegic; HFE, high iron (Fe); HJV, hemojuvelin;
  TfR2, transferrin receptor 2; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription.
