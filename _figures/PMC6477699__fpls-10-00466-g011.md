caption: Schematic overview of the brassinosteroid pathway components that are targeted
  by BPC6 in vivo. The composition of the overview is derived from previous publications
  (; ; ). All genes of the brassinosteroid signaling component, except for BES1, are
  targeted by BPC6 with high confidence. As BPC6 binding to BES1 is only weak, it
  is colored with stripes.
