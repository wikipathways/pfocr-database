caption: Illustration of different mechanisms of MUC1 and MUC4 for the repression
  of apoptosis. MUC1 selectively transactivates p53, FOXA3a, and NF-κB transcription
  factors and suppresses induction of apoptosis. In contrast, MUC1 blocks nuclear
  targeting of c-Abl and blocks apoptosis. Activation of MUC1-CT by growth factor
  signaling causes its binding with HSP90, which transduces signals from the cell
  membrane to mitochondria that attenuates activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  In addition, MUC1 interacts with the death effector domain of FADD and thereby prevents
  an activation extrinsic apoptotic pathway. MUC4 has also been proposed to represses
  apoptosis through the upregulation of kip.
