caption: Schematics shown miRNAs which might regulate mGluR/mTOR/LTD signaling. The
  mGluR/mTOR/LTD consists of two phases. In the early phase, when mGluR receptor is
  stimulated, the downstream phosphatase PP2A is activated instantly, dephosphorylating
  FMRP to allow translational burst (arrows are blue colored). In the late phase,
  activation of the mTOR signaling cascade activates the S6K1 kinase but inhibits
  the PP2A. FMRP is phosphorylated again, counterbalancing the previous translational
  burst (arrows are orange colored). miRNAs which might regulate components along
  the mGluR/mTOR/LTD pathway are classified into three categories. miR-125b, 21, 93,
  and 451 increase mTOR activity (dashed arrows are red colored). miR-7 and miR-155
  decrease mTOR activity (dashed arrows are green colored). miR-199a has a dual function,
  increasing or decreasing mTOR activity in certain situations (dashed arrows are
  purple colored).
