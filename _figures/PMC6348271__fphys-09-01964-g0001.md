caption: (A) An example of a reaction in our model for hypothetical PathwayX, which
  contains hypothetical components Prt1 and Prt2. Each component is designated a vector,
  which is a collection of the name and the different states a component can assume.
  Components Prt1 and Prt2 belong to the table for Pathway X. A reaction in the model
  only occurs when the conditions described in the if-statement are fulfilled. (B)
  Signal transmission route of “glucose” and “no glucose” conditions through the Rgt2/Snf3,
  Snf1, and cAMP-PKA pathway and its components. The graph displays the possible states
  of each component for the system without perturbations (WT-system). Blue lines display
  the connections between the components when glucose is available. Green lines display
  the connections between the components when glucose is not available. Round nodes
  are proteins, square nodes display metabolites, upper-case letters are promoters
  of genes (e.g., SUC2). An arrow at the end of the lines displays activation of a
  gene and a vertical stripe gene repression. The connected nodes are the possible
  states one component can assume.
