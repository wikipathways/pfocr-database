caption: During prolonged insulin signaling O-GlcNAcylation of key molecules have
  an affect on the attenuation of the insulin signaling cascade. As with any signaling
  cascade, there must be a mechanism in place to down-regulate the cascade after a
  prolonged period of activation. O-GlcNAcylation of key molecules can achieve this
  via the translocation of OGT in response to insulin.A) During normal cellular conditions
  and early insulin mediated signaling, OGT (blue) is localized within the nucleus.
  Upon insulin stimulation, insulin (light green) binds the insulin receptor (IR,
  light blue) causing its autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues (PY, red circles).
  Phosphorylation of the IR recruits IRS-1 (light red) to the membrane. IRS-1 is phosphorylated
  at multiple tyrosine residues, resulting in its binding to the p85 regulatory subunit
  (brown) of PI3K. PI3K then catalyzes the production of PIP3 (light blue) at the
  plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits PDK-1which increases the phosphorylation of AKT at
  threonine-308 (PT, red circle) causing its activation. Activated AKT then phosphorylates
  various substrates. Phosphorylation of GSK3β results in an increase in glycogen
  production. Phosphorylation of FOXO results in a decrease in transcription of gluconeogenic
  genes. Phosphorylation of AS160 results in increased GLUT4 translocation.B) As a
  response to prolonged insulin signaling, a subset of OGT translocates from the nucleus
  to the plasma membrane and binds PIP3 through a PIP3 binding domain at its C-terminus.
  At the membrane, OGT is tyrosine phosphorylated by the IR leading to an increase
  in OGT’s activity. Active OGT can O-GlcNAcylate key molecules namely p85/p110, PDK1,
  AKT, and FOXO to alter insulin signaling. O-GlcNAcylation (green circles) of IRS-1
  can decrease its interaction with p85, decrease its activating phosphorylation at
  tyrosine-608 (thereby reducing its activity), while increasing its phosphorylation
  at serines-632 and 635. O-GlcNAcylation of AKT, results in a decrease in its activating
  phosphorylation of threonine-308. This causes a decrease in phosphorylation of GSK3β,
  FOXO, and AS160. Decreasing phosphorylation of GSK3β results in decreased glycogen
  production. Decreasing phosphorylation of FOXO (along with increasing its O-GlcNAcylation)
  results in an increase in gluconeogenic genes. Decreasing phosphorylation of AS160
  results in a decrease in GLUT4 translocation. Taken together O-GlcNAcylation of
  specific proteins within the insulin signaling pathway can result in a “dampening”
  effect of the insulin mediated signal.
