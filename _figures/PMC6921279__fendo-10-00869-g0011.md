caption: Schematic representation of the proposed CRF-mediated ERK1/2/Akt signaling
  mechanism in CRF1R transfected COS-7 cells. When COS-7 cells are stimulated with
  CRF, the overexpressed CRF1R leads to activation of Gi protein and the subsequent
  dissociation of αi-GTP and βγ. Gβγ subunit is able to activate Src, which plays
  a central role in the activation of EGFR, through the formation of a protein complex
  that contains CRF1R, EGFR, and Src. PI3K, independently of Akt, is involved in ERK1/2
  activation, presumably through Ras/C-Raf/MEK1/2. On the other hand, Src/PYK2 transactivates
  EGFR. Such EGFR transactivation leads to activation of the MAP kinase/ERK1/2 cascade
  and parallelly to weak activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Solid arrows indicate
  signaling mechanisms that have been identified. Dashed arrows indicate that the
  precise mechanism associated with the CRF-mediated regulation of Ras by PI3K and
  ERK1/2 by PKC remains to be determined. Plus sign (+) means positive regulation,
  and minus sign (–) means negative regulation of the ERK pathway.
