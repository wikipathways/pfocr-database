caption: Diagrammatic representation of the in silico strain of Helicobacter pylori
  and its used exchange fluxes. Other inputs from minimal medium (data not shown)
  were allowed, but only the inputs taken up by the system in this study are indicated.
  Carbon sinks include acetate, succinate, formate, and lactate. Target outputs include
  asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, lysine,
  proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, the set of nonessential amino
  acids, and the set of nucleotides.
