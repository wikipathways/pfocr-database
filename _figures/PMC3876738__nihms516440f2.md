caption: Various growth and nutrient signaling pathways are associated with regulation
  of autophagy. Following inhibition of mTOR, the ULK/Atg13/FIP200 complex is activated
  and initiate autophagosome/phagophore formation. The class III PI3 kinase (Vps34)-Atg14L-Beclin
  1 complex also regulates the autophagosome nucleation step. To expand the autophagosome
  membrane, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are required for conjugation of
  LC3 and Atg12 to phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) on the autophagosome membrane and
  Atg5, respectively. Further, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate interacts with Atg16, presumably
  located on the surface of the autophagosome membrane. The complete autophagosome
  fuse with the lysosome to form the autolysosome and cargo molecules enwrapped by
  autophagosomes are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases and recycled back to the cytoplasm.
  As shown in red, a variety of pharmacological inhibitors are depicted which modulate
  distinct steps of autophagy. Some autophagy proteins which enzymatic activity (shown
  in green and yellow) could be crucial target proteins for modulation of autophagy
  activity. Potential points where inhibitors could be potentially developed are shown
  in blank boxes.
