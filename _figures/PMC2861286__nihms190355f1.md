caption: Proposed mechanism for vitamin D’s action on the innate immune system. Vitamin
  D is produced in the skin upon exposure to UVB radiation from the sun or obtained
  from vitamin D containing foods. Vitamin D is converted to its major circulating
  form, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), by the liver 25-hydroxylase and to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D (1,25(OH)2D) by the kidney 1-alpha-hydroxylase for optimal intestinal absorption
  of calcium in the classic vitamin D pathway. In the non-classic pathway of the immune
  system, the circulating 25(OH)D is taken up by macrophages, neutrophils or epithelial
  cells at locations exposed to the external environment. The 25(OH)D is converted
  to 1,25 (OH)2D in the target cell to act as an autocrine hormone. The locally produced
  1,25(OH)2D binds to its nuclear receptor (VDR) and binds to the promoter of genes
  containing the vitamin D response element (VDRE). In neutrophils, macrophages and
  epithelial cells, this results in increased production of uncleaved cathelicidin
  (hCAP18 in humans) which undergoes further cleavage to the active cathelicidin (LL37
  in humans) which results in killing of microorganisms. Of note, invading microorganisms
  that trigger specific toll-like receptors (in this example, TLR 2/1) result in increased
  production of the VDR and 1-alpha-hydroxylase which allows for vitamin D to enhance
  the production of cathelicidin only in the presence of adequate 25(OH)D substrate
