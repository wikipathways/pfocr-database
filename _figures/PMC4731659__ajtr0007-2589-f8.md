caption: The scheme of a proposed model of fluconazole resistance by the activation
  of diverse signaling pathways. Solid and dashed arrow lines indicate known pathways
  and putative pathways predicted in the present study, respectively. Under fluconazole
  exposure, upregulation of CaMsi3 level might have activated the calcineurin signaling
  pathway or other unknown pathways required for azole resistance. The inhibition
  of Hsp90 function by HSP990 leaded to significantly reduced levels of CaMsi3 and
  CaCmd1 which is a component of the calcineurin signaling pathway. we propose that
  Msi3 functions in azole resistance cooperatively with Hsp90 as a cochaperone through
  the activation of the calcineurin signaling pathway or some unknown mechanisms.
