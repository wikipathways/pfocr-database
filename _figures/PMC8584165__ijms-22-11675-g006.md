caption: A hypothetical scenario of the events leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis
  and reduced growth rate of D. discoideum vegetative cells in the presence of chronically
  active catalytic AMPKα subunit. The directions of short green, red and orange arrows
  specify either change in the protein abundance/phosphorylation level or direction
  of a specific process in the presence of chronically active AMPKα subunit. Black
  lines ending with arrowheads indicate activating effects, while perpendicular lines
  indicate inhibiting effects. Black dotted lines indicate hypothetical processes.
  Chronically active AMPK leads to the inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway via dephosphorylation-dependent
  events including the SHKA-Rab1A-mTORC1 route and/or the AMPK-LAMTOR1-mTORC1 pathway,
  which in consequence results in a decrease in cell growth and division. Enhanced
  mitochondrial biogenesis is induced by not yet identified mitochondrial protein
  target which upon direct or indirect phosphorylation by AMPK leads to dramatic changes
  in the abundance and/or phosphorylation-dependent activity of mitochondrial proteins
  involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis and membrane biogenesis. This in
  turn causes the presence of increased mitochondrial mass and level of cellular ATP.
