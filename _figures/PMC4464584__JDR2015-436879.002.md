caption: Mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Key processes
  responsible for hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction include the polyol
  pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and advanced glycation endproducts
  (AGEs) formation. The excess glucose in endothelial cells enters polyol pathway;
  the electron donors like reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and Flavin
  adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) accumulate in the mitochondria, thus affecting the
  electron transport chain; the excess electrons increase ROS in mitochondria; ROS
  triggers accumulation of AGEs; ROS and AGEs create mitochondrial DNA damage and
  mitochondrial dysfunction; protein kinase C (PKC) and AGE mediated activation of
  nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activate the expression of inflammation proteins,
  tumor suppressor p53, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); increased nitric
  oxide (NO) by iNOS is highly reactive with superoxide anions; the peroxynitrite
  thus generated acts as a strong oxidant and completes the vicious cycle of oxidative
  stress by increasing ROS production; accumulation of AGEs also increases ROS production
  independent of glucose levels.
