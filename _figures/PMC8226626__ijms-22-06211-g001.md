caption: JAK/STAT activation and downstream signaling pathways in ILDs. (A) IL-4 binds
  to the type-I IL-4 receptor, constituted by the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα) and
  the gamma chain (γc). Additionally, both IL-4 and IL-13 bind to the type II receptor
  made up of IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1. Stimulation of these receptors activates IL-4Rα and
  associated JAK1 to phosphorylate STAT6 monomers, which then homodimerize and translocate
  to the nucleus when it activates fibrotic responses. (B) IL-6 and IL11 activate
  the receptor gp130. This receptor has shown binding to JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 in other
  diseases; however, in ILDs, is not elucidated, which JAK induces the phosphorylation
  of STAT3. The same happens after gp130 stimulation by IL-31, which leads to STAT1
  activation. Then, both STAT3 and STAT1 travel dimerized to the nucleus. (C) Non-canonical
  activation of TGF-β1 signaling pathway starts with its binding to the TGF-β1 receptor,
  and then the phosphorylation of JAK2 occurs, leading to STAT3 activation and homodimerization.
  (D) Indirect evidence of JAK/STAT pathway activation by growth factors. Here, there
  are represented the different JAKs and STATS found activated after stimulation of
  each receptor with epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
  in other diseases different to ILD. The image was created with BioRender.
