caption: Schema showing the signal transduction pathway involved in high glucose (HG)-induced
  HK-2 cell proinflammatory response, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
  migration, and those molecules or events targeted by EMPA (indicated by green arrowheads).
  HG and AGE/RAGE induce oxidative stress as evidenced by increased generation of
  superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, oxidative stress-dependent TRAF3IP2 upregulation,
  and TRAF3IP2-dependent NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation, proinflammatory cytokine and
  miR-21 induction. Further, miR-21 suppresses RECK (and TIMP3) leading to activation
  of MMP2 that promotes EMT and cell migration that is further exacerbated by the
  proinflammatory response (indicated by a dashed line). We hypothesize that the illustrated
  signal transduction pathway leading to high glucose-induced oxidative stress, TRAF3IP2
  induction, inflammation, MMP activation and RECK suppression contribute, in part,
  to progression of diabetic kidney disease. Similar to HG, its metabolite AGE also
  induces TRAF3IP2, but suppresses RECK. Importantly, EMPA has therapeutic potential
  in diabetic kidney disease by preventing HG and AGE-induced TRAF3IP2 expression
  and RECK suppression.
