caption: Model of IL-17 signaling pathway for psoriasis. The model is built as network
  of species (oval) and reactions (circle), which are connected by edges. Species
  represent biological entities of the pathway, and are color coded. Dark blue color
  shows processes of autoimmune pathology, neutrophil recruitment, and immunity to
  extracellular pathogens, yellow color depicts DEGs, green color shows DEG that are
  also acting as inhibitor, red color shows inhibitors, and sky-blue color represents
  genes that are part of the pathway, however, not differentially expressed. The species
  MAPKs includes MAPK13 and MAPK14. Chemokines includes CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL8,
  CXCL10, CCL2, CCL7 and CCL20. The species Anti-microbial includes S100A7, S100A8,
  S100A9, and LCN2 genes. Tissue remodeling includes MMP1 and MMP9 genes. C1, C2,
  C3 and AP-1 are complexes of genes. C1 includes Hsp90 and Act1. C2 includes TAB2,
  TAB3 and TAK1 genes. C3 incorporates ANAPC5 and A20 genes, and AP-1 includes FOSL1
  and FOS genes.
