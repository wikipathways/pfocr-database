caption: Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. A fraction (3–5%) of glucose incoming the
  cell is shunted through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. In this pathway, fructose-6-phosphate
  is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the glutamine/fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase
  (GFAT), the gate-keeper enzyme of the route. The main product of the pathway is
  UDP-GlcNAc, which is the substrate for O-GlcNAc transferase.
