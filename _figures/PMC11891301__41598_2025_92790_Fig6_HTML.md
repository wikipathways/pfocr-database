caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms associated with the anti-fatigue effects
  of cordycepin. The figure summarises that Cordycepin may delay exercise fatigue
  and ameliorate learning memory deficits due to excessive exercise-induced fatigue
  through the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and BDNF. Created with Figdraw.com
