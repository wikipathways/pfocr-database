caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of polyisoprene degradation in N. nova SH22a.
  The six gray blocks labeled by roman numbers represent the main parts of the proposed
  degradation pathways. I, initial oxidative cleavage of polyisoprene chains (indirect
  evidence from other studies [, , ]); II, import of oligoisoprenes (direct evidence
  from transposon-induced mutants of Mce in strain SH22a [this work] and also in the
  closely related strain G. polyisoprenivorans VH2 []); III, β-oxidation (direct evidence
  from transposon-induced mutants, deletion mutants, and complementation experiments
  for α-methylacyl-CoA racemase in strain SH22a [], and also indirect evidence from
  other studies [, ]); IV, propionyl-CoA metabolism (direct evidence from transposon-induced
  mutants in strain SH22a [this work]); V, gluconeogenesis (direct evidence from transposon-induced
  mutants, deletion mutants, and complementation experiments for phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase [this work]). The two pink bars show the steps alternately releasing
  degradation products (acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA) of β-oxidation.
