caption: 'TRAIL signaling pathway and regulatory proteins. Binding of the TRAIL ligand
  to TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 (1) induces the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to these
  receptors, forming the membrane DISC or complex I (2), in which pro-caspase-8 is
  activated, leading to the release of the active caspase-8 in the cytosol (3) and
  allowing the engagement of the apoptotic cascade (4). The mitochondrial amplification
  loop (5) can be required in some cells to induce the activation of the effector
  caspase-3. A second complex has recently been described (6), which induces activation
  of survival signaling pathways leading to transcription factors, which can result
  in cytokine secretion and increase levels of the inhibitory protein c-FLIP. Regulatory
  processes of the TRAIL pathway can be divided into three groups: receptor level,
  proximal, and distal regulation. Inhibitory proteins are shown in red.'
