caption: The UPR consists of three arms, ATF6α, IRE1α and PERK that are named after
  proteins embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. While activation
  of the ATF6α and IRE1α arms of the UPR leads to induction of chaperones that increase
  protein folding capacity, activation of the PERK arm of the UPR leads to reduced
  protein production. ATF6α activation leads to translocation of the transmembrane
  protein p90-ATF6α from the EnR to the Golgi apparatus, where it encounters proteases
  that liberate the N-terminal fragment of ATF6α (p50-ATF6α). p50-ATF6α is a transcription
  factor that increases the protein-folding capacity of the EnR by inducing EnR-resident
  chaperones, including BiP. The transmembrane protein IRE1α is a nuclease. Oligomerization
  and phosphorylation activates IRE1α. Activated IRE1α removes an intron from full-length
  XBP1 mRNA, producing spliced (sp)-XBP1 mRNA. sp-XBP1 is a transcription factor that
  increases the protein-folding capacity of the EnR and turnover of misfolded proteins
  by inducing EnR resident-chaperones. Oligomerization and autophosphorylation activate
  the transmembrane kinase PERK. Activated p-PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2α (eIF2α), leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and a reduction in
  the endoplasmic reticulum protein folding load. E2 and BHPI bind at distinct sites
  on ERα. In the anticipatory UPR (shown on the left), E2 and BHPI act via ERα to
  activate a pathway that results in opening of EnR IP3R calcium channels allowing
  efflux of calcium stored in the lumen of the EnR into the cytosol. This activates
  the UPR. In ERα containing cancer cells, strong and sustained opening of the EnR
  IP3R calcuim channels by BHPI sets up a futile cycle of ATP-dependent pumping of
  calcium into the EnR by SERCA pumps and leakage back into the cytosol through the
  open IP3R channels (lower right). This depletes intracellular ATP, activating the
  energy sensor AMPK (AMP kinase). Elevated intracellular calcium and activated AMPK
  phosphorylate and activate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase. eEF2 kinase
  phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2. This inhibits protein synthesis at a second
  site, resulting in strong and sustained toxic inhibition of protein synthesis by
  BHPI.
