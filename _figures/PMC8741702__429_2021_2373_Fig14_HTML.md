caption: Conceptual cartoon showing the medial pathway (slMFB, green) and the lateral
  pathway (HDP, blue) in coexistence. Emotional cues, memory of emotions and learning
  are represented in the medial OFC and the ventromedial PFC (not shown). Response
  inhibition to emotional cues is realized via the lateral OFC and its hyperdirect
  projections to the STN (“limbic hyperdirect pathway”). The functional role of the
  orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is essentially similar to the description (Kringelbach
  and Rolls ; Kringelbach ). §, the slMFB is potentially a bi-directional pathway
  and is only shown as a descending pathway here. It has direct access to the mesencephalic
  ventral tegmentum; the wiring pattern and the projections of GABA-ergic interneurons

  VTA just medial to the STN has been described. ?, the role of Dopamine (DA) in the
