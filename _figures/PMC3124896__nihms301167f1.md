caption: Imatinib protects primoridal follicles from cisplatin-mediated death. Cisplatin
  is a chemotherapeutic agent that kills tumor cells by inducing widespread DNA damage
  which activates a cascade of signaling pathways leading to cellular apoptosis. Unfortunately,
  the ovarian germ cells are also targeted by the drug and activate a parallel cell
  death pathway mediated by the kinase c-Abl and the tumor suppressor gene product
  p63. Imatinib blocks c-Abl activity and, when delivered with cisplatin, blocks the
  treatment-induced germ cell death, sparing the ovarian follicles during treatment.
  Adult mice treated with cisplatin alone become sterile, whereas mice treated with
  cisplatin plus imatinib are fertile6.
