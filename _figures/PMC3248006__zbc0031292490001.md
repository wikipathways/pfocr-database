caption: 'Overview of genes (putatively) involved in arginine metabolism in S. pneumoniae.
  A, schematic representation of arginine metabolic pathways in S. pneumoniae D39.
  The arginine biosynthetic pathway encompasses the arg and car genes; the catabolic
  pathway consists of the arc genes. For completion, the full arginine biosynthesis
  pathway is depicted. However, genes in parentheses are not present in S. pneumoniae
  D39 and in the strains present in the Sybil database. Only the most important reaction
  products and substrates are indicated. Genes encode enzymes as follows: glnA, glutamine
  synthetase; glmS, glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; trpG, anthranilate
  synthase component II/glutamine amidotransferase; purF, amidophosphoribosyltransferase;
  argJ, ornithine acetyltransferase; argB, N-acetylglutamate 5-phosphotransferase;
  argC, N-acetylglutamate 5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; argD, N2-acetylornithine 5-aminotransferase;
  argE, acetylornithine acetyltransferase; argF, anabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase;
  argG, argininosuccinate synthetase; argH, argininosuccinase; carA/carB, carbamoylphosphate
  synthetase; arcA, arginine deiminase; arcB, catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase;
  arcC, carbamate kinase. B, genetic neighborhood of the three ArgR-type transcriptional
  regulators encoded by the D39 genome (not drawn to scale). Lollipops, predicted
  terminator structures. For further details, see the text.'
