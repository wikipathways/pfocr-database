caption: The chronic injury imposed on the oesophageal epithelium as a result of gastrooesophageal
  reflux may result in non‐specific DNA damage, resulting in an increased propensity
  for further genetic abnormalities predisposing to cancer. Abnormalities in the tumour
  suppressor gene p53 are common in the progression of Barrett's oesophagus. Changes
  in this pathway will prevent the cellular checking mechanisms, that normally prevent
  the perpetuation of genetic errors (green type depicts the normal cellular response
  and red type the abnormal response). GORD, gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease.
