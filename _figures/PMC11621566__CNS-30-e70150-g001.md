caption: Mechanisms associated with depression pathogenesis. Elevated MAO‐A expression
  and decreased levels of 5‐HT and NE are considered major pathogenic factors for
  depression. After the body suffers from physiological or psychological stress, the
  HPA axis can be activated, leading to cascade effects. The hypothalamus secretes
  CRH, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release ACTH, subsequently triggering
  the adrenal cortex to release the final product COR. The decrease of BBB permeability
  may facilitate the entry of peripheral inflammatory factors into the CNS, leading
  to increased microglial activation. Depression is characterized by decreased neurogenesis
  in the hippocampus and altered synaptic remodeling across various brain regions,
  including the PFC. Empirically dependent synaptic remodeling and dendritic spine
  formation are affected by chronic stress and regulated via multiple signaling pathways,
  including BDNF. Mitochondrial dysfunction aggravates cell damage caused by oxidative
  stress. The imbalance of intestinal flora aggravates peripheral inflammation and
  may contribute to depression by affecting the neurotrophic factor pathway. Gap junction
  dysfunction in astrocytes, especially the decreased level of connexin43 protein,
  may be involved in depression pathogenesis and has the potential to become a new
  target for the treatment of depression. 5‐HT, serotonin; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic
  hormone; BBB, blood‐brain barrier; BDNF, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor; CNS,
  central nervous system; COR, cortisol; CRH, corticotropin‐releasing hormone; MAO‐A,
  type A monoamine oxidase; NE, norepinephrine; PFC, prefrontal cortex
