caption: Regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by ROCKs. Statins
  decrease the synthesis of isoprenoids, resulting in the indirect inhibition of the
  RhoA/ROCK pathway. The indirect inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway by statins as
  well as the direct inhibition of ROCKs by ROCK inhibitors leads to increased eNOS
  expression and eNOS activity by stabilization of eNOS mRNA or phosphorylation of
  eNOS, respectively. AII, angiotensin II; ET-1, endothelin 1; GEF, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor; GAP, GTPase activating protein; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA;
  HSP, heat shock protein; ox-LDL, oxidized LDL; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; PP, pyrophosphate; GG, isoprenoid geranylgeranyl.
