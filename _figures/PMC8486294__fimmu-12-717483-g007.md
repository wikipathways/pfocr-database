caption: A schematic diagram of CXCL5 promoting trophoblast migration, invasion, and
  EMT process through PI3K/AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Trophoblast cells express
  CXCR2, which is the receptor of CXCL5. Exogenous CXCL5 combined with CXCR2 promotes
  the EMT process through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway
  and consequently increases the invasiveness and migration of trophoblast cells.
  Conversely, downregulation of CXCL5 results in insufficient invasion and therefore
  is correlated with the pathology of RSA. In addition, E, P, HCG, and DSCs participate
  in regulating CXCL5 and CXCR2 expression of trophoblast cells within the microenvironment
  of pregnancy at the maternal–fetal interface. CXCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
  5; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
