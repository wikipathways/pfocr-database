caption: Scheme of mannose metabolism in MPI deficient cell. A, MPI deficiency causes
  metabolic block in endogenous pathway generating mannose. Under normal diet, the
  exogenous mannose is not sufficient to maintain normal intracellular mannose levels
  (less than 10 μmol/L in MPI-CDG patients compared to 50-100 μmol/L in healthy individuals)
  and results in protein N-hypoglycosylation. B, The enzymatic block can be bypassed
  by mannose therapy. Serum mannose level over 200 μmol/L normalises the protein glycosylation.
  However, the excessive mannose substitution can cause the intracellular energy failure
  induced by Man-6-P accumulation. The Man-6-P inhibits the HK, PGI, and Glc-6-P dehydrogenase
  activity, decreases level of glycolysis, causes depletion of intracellular ATP and
  subsequent energy failure. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
