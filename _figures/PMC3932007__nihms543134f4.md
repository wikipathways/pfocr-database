caption: A. Activation of the non-canonical inflammasome after phagosomal lysis and
  leaking of bacterial components. Direct delivery of LPS into the cytosol either
  experimentally with cholera toxin B or via transfection, or physiologically upon
  infection with Gram-negative bacteria, enables its detection by an unidentified
  cytosolic LPS-sensor. This sensor detects specifically hexa- or penta-acylated LPS,
  and then activates the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and caspase-11 within
  a few hours following infection. Active caspase-11 then promotes pyroptosis, and
  could also participate in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome or regulate phagosome-lysosome
  fusion []. Note that a priming step is required to induce caspase-11 transcription.B.
  Activation of caspase-11 and its role in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon
  phagocytosis of viable E. coli, microbial mRNA induces the assembly and activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome, while TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling activates the transcription
  of IFN-β genes. Secreted IFN-β binds to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), which induces
  the transcription of caspase-11 gene. Pro-caspase-11 is then cleaved into active
  caspase-11 and synergizes with bacterial mRNA in NLRP3 inflammasome. Note that TRIF
  and IFNAR signaling are involved in late stage (12–16 hours post infection) caspase-11
  activation via as yet unidentified steps.
