caption: 'Mechanism and effects of the cGAS-STING pathway in regulating antitumor
  immunity across T cell subsets. In CD8+ T cells, cGAS-STING activation enhances
  tumor infiltration by inducing IFN-I secretion and sustains stem-like properties
  through transcriptional factor TCF1 upregulation, thereby promoting the durable
  antitumor activity of CAR-T cells. Concurrently, IFN-I signaling inhibits the Akt
  pathway to drive their differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. CD4+ T cells,
  as pivotal early responders, establish a pro-inflammatory microenvironment via IL-2
  and IFN-γ secretion. Through the STING-IFN-β axis, they engage in bidirectional
  crosstalk with cDC1, enhancing antigen presentation and priming CD8+ T cell activation.The
  cGAS-STING pathway also precisely regulates γδ T cells: In early tumors, cGAMP promotes
  the production of IFN-γ through the phosphorylation of Eomes, while in the immune
  microenvironment of advanced tumors, TGF-β inhibits the expression of STING protein
  in γδ T cells through epigenetic mechanisms, leading to functional exhaustion of
  γδ T cells. In treg cells, cGAS-STING activation disrupts immunosuppressive functions
  by downregulating IL-10 and TGF-β1 production, upregulating tumor MHC-I expression,
  and reversing immune tolerance. Moreover, STING-based vaccines further amplify T
  cell-mediated immunity by suppressing treg differentiation'
