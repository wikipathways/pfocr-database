caption: 'Overview of Fe and S Interaction in plants. (A) In plants, Fe and S availability
  affect S and Fe homeostasis, respectively (left panel, see text for details). The
  metabolic interlinks between Fe and S seem to be related to the biosynthesis of
  specific compounds: S is essential for Met synthesis, the pivotal precursor of ET,
  NA, and PS through the SAM biosynthesis pathway (right panel). (B) Hypothetical
  involvement of organelles (such as mitochondria) in the modulation of Fe and S deficiency-induced
  responses. The engagement of specific cellular sensing and signaling pathways might
  depend on the progression/severity degree of nutrient deficiency. Mitochondria impairment
  might be a source of still unknown signals (likely ROS and/or citric acid) able
  to modulate cellular responses. ET, ethylene; Met, methionine; NA, nicotianamine;
  PS, phytosiderophore; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.'
