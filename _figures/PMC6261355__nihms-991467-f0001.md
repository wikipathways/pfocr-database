caption: Feedback inhibition of the HBP by UDP-GlcNAc and potentially by the corresponding
  donor sugars of MCRs. A) UDP-GlcNAc and other endogenous nucleotide donor sugars
  are biosynthesized from fructose-6-phosphate by the HBP. The rate-determining enzyme
  in this pathway, GFAT, can be feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc to control flux through
  the HBP.B) Several azide- or alkyne-bearing monosaccharides have been developed
  as MCRs for different types of protein glycosylation, but it is unknown whether
  their UDP derivatives can also inhibit GFAT.
