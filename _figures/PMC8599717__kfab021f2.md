caption: Synthesis of m6A and tiers of its regulation contrasting the prevailing reader
  theory and the redundant reader theory. During transcription, the methyltransferase
  writer complex takes methyl groups from SAM and deposits them onto DRACH consensus
  sequences. Although in the nucleus, methylated mRNAs can be encountered by erasers
  such as ALKBH5 and FTO (targets small nuclear RNAs and m6Am), or by reader YTHDC1
  that can regulate splicing (*occurs on pre-mRNAs) and export from the nucleus. Under
  the prevailing reader theory, the polymethylated mRNAs are bound by YTHDF3 and YTHDF1
  for translation, whereas YTHDF3 and YTHDF2 target them for degradation. Prevailing
  evidence suggests these polymethylated mRNAs are processed rapidly and sequentially,
  first being bound for translation and then followed by decay. Under the redundant
  reader theory, the YTHDFs bind their cognate mRNAs to only and specifically initiate
  degradation through either the (1) endoribonucleolytic cleavage pathway, via interaction
  with HRSP12 (recognizes GGUUC sequence) and RNase P/MRP complex, or the (2) deadenylation
  pathway via interaction with CCR4-NOT. YTHDF binding of polymethylated mRNAs allows
  for phase separation and partitioning through the binding of their low-complexity
  domains (dash connections), principally guided to p-bodies. Evidence suggests degradation
  occurs within p-bodies or may instead be the location of the final stages of mRNA
  degradation after the initial processing through either endoribonucleolytic cleavage
  or deadenylation. Upon survivable stressors such as arsenite, YTHDFs bind polymethylated
  mRNAs and can partition them into stress granules rather than p-bodies, resulting
  in no degradation of these bound cognate mRNAs. Lastly, how and when transitioning
  between p-bodies and stress granules occurs and what effects this confers upon the
  entangled m6A mRNAs remains to be further evaluated.
