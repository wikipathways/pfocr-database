caption: Intrinsic Resistance to Drugs Targeting K-RasG12C.(A) K-RasG12C inhibitors
  function mainly through suppressing the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and variably
  affecting other growth-promoting signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1
  pathway.(B and C) However, the extent to which cell proliferation depends on the
  MAPK/ERK pathway varies across models. KRASG12C mutant cells that heavily depend
  upon MAPK/ERK signaling for proliferation are highly sensitive to K-RasG12C inhibitors
  (B). Otherwise, cells will be refractory to K-RasG12C inhibition (C).(D) Secondary
  KRAS mutations conferring either increased GEF activity or decreased GAP activity
  to K-Ras protein will result in resistance to K-RasG12C inhibitors.(E) The mutation
  status of KRASG12C may be heterogeneous among primary tumor and metastases, as well
  as across individual intratumor cancer cells, which leads to inconsistent responses
  to K-RasG12C inhibitors among patients.
