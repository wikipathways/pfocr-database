caption: Proposed mechanism of action of cisplatin and EGCG in cochlea and cancer
  cells. (a) Cisplatin activates STAT1 through a ROS/MAPK pathway and reduces phosphorylated
  (p)-STAT3. The reduction in p-STAT3/p-STAT1 ration promotes inflammation and apoptosis
  in the cochlea. EGCG promotes cell survival in the cochlea by inhibiting STAT1 and
  protecting p-STAT3, thereby increasing the p-STAT3/p-STAT1 ratio and regulating
  the expression Bcl-2 and other prosurvival factors. (b) Cisplatin kills cancer cells
  primarily by forming platinum–DNA adducts, which inhibits DNA replication. Cisplatin-induced
  activation of STAT1 (which contributes to survival and drug resistance) and inhibition
  of STAT3 (contributes a survival signal). The STAT3/STAT1 ratio and promotes apoptosis.
  EGCG antitumor contribution is likely produced, in part, through inhibition of p-STAT1
  without affecting p-STAT3. The combination of EGCG with cisplatin leads to suppression
  of both STAT1 and STAT3 pathways, leading to greater cell apoptosis. MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase
