caption: In normal podocytes, several upstream signals, including RAP1GAP, converge
  to maintain proper cellular RAP1 homeostasis and appropriate β1 integrin–mediated
  adhesion and signaling. In FSGS, however, increased podocyte expression of RAP1GAP
  leads to inhibition of RAP1-GTPase and relative accumulation of RAP1 as RAP1-GDP.
  This leads to a reduction in activated β1 integrin, including reduced adhesion to
  GBM components. We propose that this pathway is an important mediator of podocyte
  detachment from the GBM, a process characteristic of podocyte loss in human glomerular
  diseases such as FSGS. Images shown are from a control and a podocyte-specific Rap1-haploinsufficient
  mouse (original magnification, ×600).
