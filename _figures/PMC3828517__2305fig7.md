caption: A model for Norrin-mediated Fz4 receptor activation. In the absence of Norrin,
  both Fz4 and Tspan12 form homodimers or oligomers. The interaction of Fz4 with Tspan12
  brings Fz4 into tetraspanin-enriched microdomains on the cell membrane. A Norrin
  dimer binds to an Fz4 dimer with high affinity. Simultaneously, Norrin also binds
  to Lrp5/6 BP1 and BP2 domains through its two edges (1) or, alternatively, predominantly
  to the Lrp5/6 BP1 domain (2). In the first binding mode, Norrin binds to one Lrp5/6
  molecule, whereas in the second binding mode, Norrin can bind up to two Lrp5/6 molecules.
  The interaction of Norrin with Fz4 and Lrp5/6 brings their C-terminal tails closer
  for interaction and activation of the downstream β-catenin signaling pathway.
