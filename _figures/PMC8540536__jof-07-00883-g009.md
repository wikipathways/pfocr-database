caption: A possible model of ATL12 function in the hormone, NADPH oxidase-mediated
  and the chitin-mediated defense. ATL12 is at the downstream of chitin-mediated signaling
  pathway, through the MAP kinase 3 (MAPK3) cascade. Besides, ATL12 is related to
  ROS generation and may act at the upstream of ATRBOHD/F-related signaling transduction
  pathway. Moreover, ATL12 may be involved in the SA-, and JA-mediated signaling pathway
  []. The figure with created with BioRender.com with license agreement number DV2337X56K.
