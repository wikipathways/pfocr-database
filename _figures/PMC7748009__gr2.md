caption: The Activation and Signaling of FLS2/BAK1- and CERK1/LYK5-Mediated Plant
  PTI Are Modulated by the Interplay of Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, and SUMOylation.(A)
  In the absence of PAMPs, the PRRs BAK1 and FLS2 as well as LYK5 and CERK1 are dissociated.
  BAK1, PUB12/13, the heterotrimeric G proteins, CPK28, and PUB25/26 form a complex.
  FLS2 is complexed with the deSUMOylating enzyme, Desi3a. The non-phosphorylated
  (non-activated) form of BIK1 associates with the BAK1 and FLS2 complex, respectively.
  PUB25/26 specifically ubiquitinates non-activated BIK1 and mediates its degradation
  but the G proteins inhibit the E3 activity of PUB25/26. The Desi3a interacts with
  FLS2 and inhibits its SUMOylation. In addition, PUB13 mediates the ubiquitination
  and degradation of another PRR, LYK5 and PUB22 form a dimer/oligomer and catalyze self-ubiquitination
  for degradation.(B) The presence of PAMP flg22 induces mutual phosphorylation and
  association of FLS2 and BAK1 as well as phosphorylation of PUB12/13 by BAK1 and
  their association. flg22 also induces phosphorylation of BIK1 by phosphorylated
  BAK1, which results in the activated form of BIK1 that is resistant to PUB25/26-mediated
  ubiquitination, and in turn phosphorylates BAK1 and FLS2 and dissociation of the
  activated BIK1 from the BAK1–FLS2 complex. The release of activated BIK1 from the
  BAK1–FLS2 complex triggers the downstream PTI signaling that culminates in PTI.
  The flg22 also induces (1) the degradation of Desi3a, which promotes the SUMOylation
  of FLS2 that is essential for activation of downstream immune signaling and (2)
  the release of the G proteins from the complex, and promotes the phosphorylation
  of PUB25/26 by CPK28, which increases the E3 ligase activity of PUB25/26 and speeds
  up the degradation of the non-activated BIK1. Meanwhile, the phosphorylated PUB12/13
  ubiquitinates FLS2 for degradation to attenuate plant immune signaling. Upon challenge
  of chitin, CERK1 interacts with LYK5 but PUB13 dissociates from LYK5, which activates
  the chitin-induced immunity. CERK1 is suggested to be ubiquitinated by PUB12 for
  degradation. The presence of PAMPs activates the MAPK cascades including MPK3 as
  part of the immune signaling pathway. The activated MPK3 phosphorylates PUB22 to
  inhibit its oligomerization and autoubiquitination, which promotes the ubiquitination
  of the immune-essential component Exo70B2 by PUB22 for degradation.
