caption: β-Catenin immunohistochemistry in normal adult mouse liver. Predominantly,
  β-catenin is observed staining hepatocyte membrane only in both the midzonal (purple
  box) and periportal regions of a hepatic lobule, where it interacts with E-cadherin
  and constitutes the adherens junctions. Around the central vein (CV), β-catenin,
  in addition to being membranous, is also cytoplasmic and nuclear (blue box) where
  it acts as a downstream effector of the Wnt signaling pathway and regulates pericentral
  target gene expression.
