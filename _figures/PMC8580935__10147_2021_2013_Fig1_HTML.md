caption: Mechanism of action of palbociclib [, , , –]. Panel A shows how the CDK4/6:cyclin
  D1 complex phosphorylates not only the retinoblastoma protein, which releases the
  E2F transcription factor, driving progression from the G1 to the S phase of the
  cell cycle, but also FOXM1 (activates the expression of other cell-cycle genes),
  MEP50 (p53 signaling pathway), PFK1 and PKM2 (glycolytic enzymes), and SPOP (ubiquitin
  ligase subunit) that helps with PD-L1 degradation [, , ]. CDKs and cyclins have
  been shown to be dysregulated in breast cancer cells []. However, studies have shown
  that inhibition of CDK4/6 activity (e.g., with palbociclib) halts cell-cycle progression
  and prevents tumor cell division (Panel B) []. Furthermore, inhibition of CDK4/6:cyclin
  D1 activity by palbociclib may activate an immune response by promoting immune-related
  gene expression through activation of enhancers, PD-L1 expression, or antigen presentation
  [, ]. Thus, drugs that inhibit CDK4/6:cyclin D1 activity became a focus of breast
  cancer treatment. Findings from a preclinical study evaluating the growth inhibitory
  effects of a CDK4/6 inhibitor across a panel of molecularly characterized breast
  cancer cell lines identified the most potent activity in cell lines that were estrogen
  receptor (ER)‒positive (ER+) and HER2‒ amplified []. Panel C shows the binding capacity
  of palbociclib to each CDK complex (IC50 by cell-free assay) []. Dashed lines represent
  outcomes after CDK4/6:cyclin D1 inhibition. AP-1 activator protein-1; CCNB1 cyclin
