caption: JCYSTLF exerted an anti-senescence effect through regulating the HIF-1α/autophagy
  pathway in diabetic kidneys. Combined with LC-MS/MS, TCMSP, literature reports,
  network analysis, and experiment validation identified compounds characterization
  of JCYSTLF and explored JCYSTLF's anti-senescence mechanism. Misfolded proteins
  and damaged organelles are degraded mainly by autophagy lysosome pathway. In diabetic
  kidneys, dysfunctional autophagy induces the accumulation of misfolded proteins
  and damaged organelles, and accelerates kidney senescence. JCYSTLF increases the
  levels of HIF-1α to improve dysfunctional autophagy, and delays diabetic kidneys
  senescence
