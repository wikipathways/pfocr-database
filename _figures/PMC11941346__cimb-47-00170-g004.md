caption: 'miRNA target genes of hsa-miR 29a-3p, hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-25a-3p and
  hsa-miR-92a-3p involved in KEGG pathways. The KEGG pathway shows target genes of
  miRNAs obtained using the miRNet 2.0 platform. In each pathway, the top 10 hub genes
  are shown, and we highlight genes de-regulated in the transcriptome of the mouse
  model for SCA7 that are target molecules of the 4 miRNAs. Panel (a) shows target
  genes in the actin cytoskeleton. Panel (b) shows target genes in the RNA transport
  pathway. Panel (c) shows target genes in the apoptosis pathway. Panel (d) shows
  target genes in the dopaminergic synapse pathway. In the bottom-right corner, the
  intensity of the colors of hub genes indicates their ranking position: the dark
  orange genes have the most significant Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) values and
  thus are hub genes of greater importance in the network; the light-yellow ones have
  lower MCC values and thus are hub genes of lower importance in the network. Genes
  outlined in red represent the overlapping genes between those identified as de-regulated
  in the transcriptome of the mouse-SCA7 model and those predicted in silico for each
  pathway'
