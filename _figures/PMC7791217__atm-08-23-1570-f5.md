caption: Schematic indicated that uric acid preconditioning could inhibit doxorubicin-induced
  the changes of JNK-Cx43 gap junctions and conduction abnormalities via AMPK-SHP2
  signaling pathway. Doxorubicin could significantly induce the activation of JNK-Cx43
  signaling pathway, and lead to gap junctions changes and conduction abnormalities,
  and then mediate the production of cardiac toxicity. However, uric acid preconditioning
  could significantly activate AMPK and induce the upregulation of SHP2, which could
  in turn suppress the change of Cx43 gap junctions and conduction abnormalities,
  and alleviate doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity.
