caption: Schematic illustration of the in vitro effects of the poly(I:C) ENCPs developed
  in this study. (A) Upon interaction with macrophages, poly(I:C) nanocomplexes are
  taken up. (B) This process allows poly(I:C) to reach its target receptor TLR3, found
  in the endosomes. It is expected that this interaction activates the TLR3 and the
  TRIF pathway, stimulating the upregulation of type I IFN genes. (C) The expression
  of M2 (CD206 and CD163) surface markers was slightly decreased, while M1 (CD80 and
  MHC II) markers are not substantially modified. Nevertheless, (D) CXCL10 and CCL5
  chemokines, involved in the attraction of CD8 T cells to the tumor microenvironment,
  are secreted. (E) The direct cytotoxicity of macrophages toward cancer cells is
  also enhanced. Images were reproduced from Servier Medical Art under a Creative
