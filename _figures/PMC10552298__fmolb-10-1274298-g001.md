caption: (A), Hypothetical VOC production pathway originated from lipid peroxidation
  of membrane lipids. Aldehyde is generated from PUFA by LOX, based on radical reaction.
  Aldehyde can be converted into alcohol by ADH; (B), Lactate shuttle between cancer
  cells under high glucose (glycolytic) and low glucose. Lactate can be secreted from
  cells under high glucose and consumed under low glucose; (C), VEM-1 (VOC Enrichment
  Machine), automated pumping machine connected to air compressor that drives pumping.
  Monotraps (RG and RSC18) were put into a 2.5 mL disposable syringe (TERMO, SS-02SZ)
  connected to a cylinder.
