caption: 'A) Bar graph showing the average fold change in gene expression between
  R and NR for CD4 T cells (top), pTfh (middle), and non-pTfh (bottom) using ANOVA
  p-value <0.05 and fold change >1.5 as cutoffs. Red bars correspond to gene expression
  that was higher in R compared to NR and Green bars indicate higher gene expression
  in NR compared to R. B) Gene networks were generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software and combined DEGs from the 3 cell types in (A) as input. Colors in
  the network are defined as follows: red indicates up-regulation in R vs NR, green
  indicates up-regulation in NR vs R, and white indicates the molecule was added from
  the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Solid lines indicate direct interaction and dashed
  lines indicate indirect interaction. C) The top 5 upstream regulators were determined
  using IPA software and combined DEGs from the 3 cell types in (A) as input. The
  overlap p-values show statistically significant overlap by Fisher’s exact test between
  dataset genes and the genes that are known to be regulated by a particular molecule.'
