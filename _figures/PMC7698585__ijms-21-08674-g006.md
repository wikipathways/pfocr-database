caption: Proposed model of how normal glucose supports breast cancer 1, early onset
  (BRCA1) function as a metabolic restraint of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
  actions. Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCA) catalyses a rate-limiting step of the fatty
  acid synthesis pathway and is partly regulated at a transcriptional level by p53
  and post transcriptionally by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via reversible
  phosphorylation [,]. Its activity depends on the equilibrium between active (dephosphorylated)
  and less active (phosphorylated) forms [] and the novel BRCA1 functions in regulating
  fatty acid synthesis involve binding phosphorylated ACCA and keeping it in this
  less active form. (A) In high glucose conditions, IGF-I impairs this function by
  reducing the association between BRCA1 and p-ACCA (S79), resulting in ACCA dephosphorylation
  and increased activity. Downstream of ACCA, IGF-I increases fatty acid synthase
  (FASN) abundance, leading to increased fatty acid synthesis to support cell proliferation.
  (B). In contrast, the association between BRCA1 and p-ACCA (S79) increases in response
  to IGF-I in normal glucose conditions, resulting in increased ACCA phosphorylation
  and reduced activity, suggesting that normal glucose support BRCA1 function. Downstream
  of ACCA, normal glucose conditions inhibit IGF-I-induced upregulation of FASN and
  consequently, the proliferative responses to IGF-I are reduced. While our conclusions
  are based on changes in protein abundance and protein–protein interactions, alterations
  in the fatty acid synthesis pathway would have to be confirmed by actual measurement
  of enzyme activity or lipids.
