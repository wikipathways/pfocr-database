caption: Glucose accelerates aging through various signaling pathways. (A) A high-glucose
  diet shortens lifespan in various organisms. In yeast, glucose decreases lifespan
  through the glucose receptor and Ras, components of a growth-promoting signaling
  pathway. In Caenorhabditis elegans, glucose downregulates pro-longevity proteins,
  such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), FOXO, and glyoxalase, resulting in
  short lifespan. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, mediates
  the effects of glucose on senescence in cultured mammalian cells. (B) Low-carbohydrate
  diets may improve human health by reducing several factors, including serum leptin,
  blood glucose, and triglycerides, which are associated with aging or metabolic defects.
  In addition, reduced carbohydrate intake decreases body weight and reduces the risk
  factors associated with heart disease.
