caption: Overview of NetPathID. This figure describes steps to discover disrupted
  pathways across cancers. The aim of the approach is to integrate the copy number
  data with protein-protein interaction networks to quantify pathway activity for
  discovering disrupted pathways across cancers. (A) A list of significantly altered
  genes residing in copy number regions is generated using GISTIC. (B) We initialize
  activity scores of these genes using their average log2 ratios of amplification
  or deletion in copy number data, and overlay initial gene activity scores on the
  protein-protein interaction networks. To fully utilize network topological information,
  we apply a label propagation algorithm to assign gene activity scores to all the
  genes in the protein-protein interaction networks (see “Methods” section). (C) Finally,
  pathway activity scores are computed by average activity scores of member genes
  in each predefined pathway from prior knowledge (e.g. pathway database or conserved
  subnetworks in the protein-protein interaction networks cross species). We repeat
  step (A) and (B) to generate a matrix containing pathway activity scores from multiple
  cancer types.
