caption: 'Model of ligand passing and TrkA presentation for NGF binding. Upper row:
  NGF. Lower row: Htm1. Left column: Putative complex of NGF or Htm1 with TrkA and
  p75 that represents an intermediate in the ligand-passing model. Note the antiparallel
  orientation of the two receptors resulting from the binding mode of each ligand
  relative to the membrane (). The formation of this complex would be preceded by
  the binding of NGF or Htm1 to the p75 receptor. Middle column: NGF or Htm1 binding
  to a homodimeric TrkA receptor. The binding pathway for NGF or Htm1 to form this
  complex can occur by directly binding to TrkA or via the two-step ligand-passing
  process, which involves formation of the complex shown in the left column. Right
  column: Putative heteroreceptor complex of undefined stoichiometry in the Trk presentation
  model. This complex represents the TrkA presentation model. A pre-existing TrkA-p75
  heteroreceptor complex can bind to NGF with greater affinity than TrkA alone. In
  the lower middle and lower right models, the area in the circle designates additional
  modes of interaction among Htm1 loop L-I, L-II, and L-IV residues and the extracellular,
  juxtamembrane region of TrkA to explain the cellular and signaling data (see Discussion).'
