caption: Cell-specific production of eicosanoids in the tumor microenvironment. Solid
  tumors consist of cancer cells (transformed epithelial cells) in close contact with
  a non-transformed cells of the tumor microenvironment. These include inflammatory
  cells (neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils and dendritic cells) as well as cells
  of the adaptive immune system (T cells and B cells). Individual cell types in the
  tumor microenvironment produce distinct panels of eicosanoid as a consequence of
  cell-specific expression of enzymes in this pathway. Some eicosanoids are produced
  by multiple cell types, such as PGE2 which can be produced by cancer cells, macrophages
  and neutrophils.
