caption: Mechanisms of TMAO inducing autophagic cell death. TMAO upregulates Beclin1,
  a key regulator of autophagy, but this overexpression impairs autophagic flux, disrupting
  the normal degradation and recycling processes within the cell. Additionally, TMAO
  promotes autophagy inhibition by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,
  a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. TMAO also triggers the PERK/ROS pathway,
  which paradoxically enhances autophagy, suggesting a complex role for TMAO in modulating
  autophagic processes. Furthermore, TMAO significantly suppresses the expression
  of ATG16L1, a critical component of autophagosome formation. This suppression prevents
  the proper multimerization of the ATG16L1-ATG5-ATG12 complex, further inhibiting
  autophagy and contributing to cellular dysfunction. These mechanisms highlight TMAO’s
  dual role in enhancing and impairing autophagy, ultimately leading to autophagic
  cell death. Created in BioRender. Ge, P. (2025) https://BioRender.com/i74e270
