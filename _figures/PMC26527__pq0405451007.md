caption: Summary of cAMP signaling pathways in GT1 cells. Increased levels of cAMP
  result in the opening of cAMP-gated cation channels, allowing the influx of Na+
  and increased excitability of the cell. Inactive PKA (PKAi) is activated by increased
  cAMP levels (PKAa), resulting in the phosphorylation (P) and inhibition of AC V
  and a decrease in cAMP levels. Solid lines represent stimulation and broken lines,
  inhibition.
