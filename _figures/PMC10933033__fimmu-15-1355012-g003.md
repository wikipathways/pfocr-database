caption: Regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by interleukin receptors
  via STAT and IRF transcription factors. Activated IRF3 translocates in the nucleus
  and induces the expression IFN-β. IFN-β is secreted and binds to interferon receptors
  and activates the JAK/STAT1 signaling to drive the expression of CD40, iNOS, and
  IFN-inducible genes and IRF5 for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. However,
  this pathway is negatively regulated by the inhibitory adaptor proteins LnK and
  SOCS-1, which interfere with STAT1 activation, and IRF4, which blocks IRF5 signaling.
  IRF4 is induced via the IL-4/13/STAT6/JMJD3 cascade. IFN-β, interferon β; JAK, Janus
  kinase; STAT-1/6, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1/6; IL-4/13/6/23,
  interleukin-4/13/6/23; IRF3/4/5, interferon regulatory factor 3/4/5; SOCS-1, suppressor
  of cytokine signaling-1; JMJD3, Jumonji domain-containing protein-3; CD40, cluster
  of differentiation 4; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase. Created with BioRender.com
