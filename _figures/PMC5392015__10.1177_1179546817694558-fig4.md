caption: 'GHRP mechanism of action. GHRPs are endowed with the ability to bind two
  different receptors that seem to mediate its cytoprotective and other pharmacological
  properties (GHS-R1a and CD36). The main biological properties/pharmacological actions
  of GHRP-6 as cyto- and cardioprotective candidates are summarized as follows: Inotropic:
  mediated by an elevation of Ca2+ influx via PLC/DAG/PKC, through the voltage-gated
  calcium channel, triggering Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular
  stores, which translated in a positive inotropic response without a chronotropic
  effect. Anti-fibrotic: via upregulation of PPARγ, which is followed by a transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β), CTGF, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) downregulation.
  Anti-inflammatory: blunts NFκB expression and activation. Cell survival: it involves
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (PI-3K/AKT1)
  pathway, as the induction of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α). Cardioprotective:
  as shown, it involves different biological actions that converge to enhance cardiomyocytes
  survival. Vasodilatory: it seems to involve e-NOS upregulation and endothelin activity
  reduction. Anabolic: it is mediated by the IGF-1/AKT1 and mTOR pathway activity.'
