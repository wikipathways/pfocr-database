caption: (a–k) 11 genes were significantly overexpressed during influenza infection
  in all discovery cohorts analyzed. The x axes represent standardized mean difference
  between influenza and control samples, computed as Hedges’ g, in log2 scale. The
  size of the blue rectangles is inversely proportional to the standard error of mean
  (SEM) in the study. Whiskers represent the 95% confidence interval. The orange diamonds
  represent overall, combined mean difference for a given gene. Width of the diamonds
  represents the 95% confidence interval of overall mean difference. (l) Network analysis
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that 10 out of the 11 genes are part of
  a single regulatory network. Blue nodes in the network represent IMS genes, red
  nodes represent genes that were significantly over-expressed during influenza infection,
  but are not included in the IMS.
