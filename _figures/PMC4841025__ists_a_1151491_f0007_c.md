caption: Adipokine signaling pathway analysis in the pWAT in subordinate (SUB) and
  dominant (DOM) mice fed standard diet compared to controls (CON), based on PCR data
  from tissues shown in . Sub-pathways significantly upregulated in the condition
  of interest (SUB or DOM) compared to CON are represented with all this group of
  nodes in red. Sub-pathways significantly downregulated are represented with all
  the nodes in blue. SUB showed an upregulation in glucose uptake an adiponectin sub-pathways
  while DOM showed a downregulation compared to CON. Further details on the representation
  of the pathway analysis appear in Figure S3. This figure will be best described
  with colors at the online version.
