caption: Schematic representation of canonical Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus
  (MMTV) integration site (Wnt) pathway and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ and Wnt/planar
  cell polarity (PCP) pathways [,,,,,]. (A) In the Wnt off state (i.e., in the absence
  of a Wnt ligand), cytoplasmic β-catenin is constantly degraded by the action of
  the Axin complex. Casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)
  sequentially phosphorylate the amino terminal region of β-catenin, resulting in
  β-catenin ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (red box). In the Wnt on state,
  canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation starts with Wnt binding Frizzled (Fzd)
  receptor and the co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6
  (LRP5/6), which induces the recruitment of Dishevelled (Dvl) leading to the inhibition
  of the β-catenin destruction complex formed by Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC), GSK-3β, and CK1. This inhibition causes the accumulation of β-catenin, which
  is no longer phosphorylated by the destruction complex. β-catenin then translocates
  to the nucleus where it activates transcription of Wnt target genes. (B) In the
  non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the binding of Wnt to Fzd activates the heterotrimeric
  G-proteins. These signal through phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) to induce the release of intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein
  kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Multiple
  interactions are possible between the targets of the Wnt/Ca2+ and the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway at different points. Additionally, Kny, Ror2, or Ryk receptors
  with Fzd receptors can activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), promoting target
  gene expression through activator protein 1 (AP-1). In non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway,
  Wnt proteins bind to Fzd, which activates small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)
  proteins Rho and Rac and c-Jun N-terminal kinase via Dvl. This interaction results
  in cytoskeletal regulation and involves polarized cell shape changes and cytoskeleton
  rearrangement.
