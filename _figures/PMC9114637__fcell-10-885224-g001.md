caption: 'Chondrocyte mechanotransduction and potential mechano-therapeutics. (A)
  TRPV4-mediated Mechanotransduction of Healthy Cartilage: under physiological loading
  (10% strain), Ca2+ ions enter through activated TRPV4 channel and promote an anabolic
  pathway. This leads to increased collagen II and aggrecan expression, as well as
  reduced expression of MMPs. Ultimately, this prevents degradation of the cartilage
  ECM and promotes synthesis of important ECM molecules. (B) Piezo1-mediated Mechanotransduction
  of OA cartilage: under injurious loading (50% strain) or inflammatory activation
  via IL-1α, Ca2+ enters the cell through Piezo1 channels. Activation of Piezo1 channels
  also triggers voltage gated Ca2+ channel opening, resulting in excess Ca2+ concentrations
  in the chondrocyte, activating a catabolic pathway. This will result in enhanced
  PIEZO1 and MMP expression, increasing mechanosensitivity of chondrocytes to mechanical
  loading. (C) Proposed Mechano-therapeutics: GsMTx4, an inhibitor of Piezo1, prevents
  Ca2+ influx in response to Piezo1 activation under injurious loading, acting to
  protect the chondrocytes. Verapamil, a VGCC inhibitor, further regulates Ca2+ homeostasis
  by preventing excess Ca2+ influx through VGCCs that activate in addition to Piezo1
  channels under abnormal loading. GSK101, an agonist of TRPV4, mediates an anabolic
  phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of degradative enzymes, like MMP, and
  enhanced expression of cartilage ECM components, like collagen II and aggrecan.
  Combined, these therapeutics can be used to promote an anabolic pathway, decrease
  ECM degradation, and prevent progression of the cartilage into an OA phenotype.
