caption: Activins signal through type 1 and 2 activin receptors (ACVR1/2) to phosphorylate
  and activate SMAD3. Deletion of inhibin α not only leads to loss of competitive
  inhibition at the level of ACVR1/2 receptors, but it also leads to a pathological
  increase in activin levels. In our model, excess activin and FSH signaling synergistically
  activate SMAD3 tumorigenic pathways. Although the current studies suggest RB is
  not an important modifier of the inhibin α KO phenotype, we speculate that FSH mediates
  crosstalk between the RB pathway and inhibin α KO tumorigenic pathway by activating
  cyclin D1/2, which also modulates SMAD3 activity to affect tumor development and
  progression. We propose that SMAD3 activation synergizes with loss of RB in Inha/Rb
  dKO Sertoli cells thus resulting in the upregulation of E2F1- and p53-target genes.
