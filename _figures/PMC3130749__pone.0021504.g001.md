caption: The canonical Wnt pathway is summarized in this figure. Wnt binds its receptor
  Fz, which activates Dsh, an inhibitor of GSK-3. GSK-3 normally prevents dissociation
  of β-catenin from APC; when GSK-3 is inhibited, β-catenin enters the nucleus and
  regulates transcription (reviewed in ). Analysis of pathway members uncovered mosquito
  lineage specific changes in the number of orthologous sequences for genes encoding
  various Wnt pathway components in mosquitoes. With respect to D. melanogaster, mosquito
  lineage specific gene absences (−), as well as increases in the number of orthologues
  (+) were noted for particular pathway members. Details are provided in the text.
