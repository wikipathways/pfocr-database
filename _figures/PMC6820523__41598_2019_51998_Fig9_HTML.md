caption: Our proposed model of nsDNA-induced APOL1 expression through engagement of
  the cGAS/IFI16-STING pathway in human immortalized AB8/13 podocytes. Binding of
  cytosolic nsDNA by cGAS and IFI16 activates STING, which subsequently activates
  TBK1. Activated TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3, which promotes transcription of APOL1
  and IFNβ. IFNβ released from the cells (or exogenous IFNβ) binds to IFNAR. IFNAR-associated
  JAK1 and Tyk2 kinases then phosphorylate STAT1, which promotes transcription of
  APOL1 and IFI16. A putative IFI16-mediated activation of STING is indicated by a
  dashed arrow. A potential cooperation between cGAS and IFI16 is indicated by a double-headed
  arrow. Deficient STING phosphorylation observed in cGAS- or IFI16-knockdown cells
  (Fig. ) suggests that nsDNA-induced APOL1 expression may be mediated by a phospho-STING-independent
  pathway, marked by a green arrow. A dual JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Ruxo)
  suppresses STAT1 activation and thereby inhibits IFI16 expression and STAT1-mediated
  APOL1 expression. Since IFNAR-mediated signaling involves JAK1 but not JAK2, our
  model only depicts the inhibition of JAK1 by Ruxo. Ruxo does not affect IRF3-mediated
  APOL1 expression.
