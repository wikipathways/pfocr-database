caption: 'Blueprint of amino acid biosynthesis and nutritional upgrading in the A.
  pisum/Buchnera APS symbiosis. Essential amino acids are shown in purple, while non-essential
  amino acids are in green. A. pisum enzymes are shown with red arrows, while Buchnera
  enzymes are shown with blue arrows. Green boxes around metabolites indicate a phloem
  sap source and purple boxes highlight the importance of glutamine (Gln), which is
  a dominant amino acid in hemolymph [] actively taken up by bacteriocytes and converted
  to glutamate (Glu, orange boxes). Glutamate then actively crosses the symbiosomal
  membrane [, ] where it serves as an amino donor and metabolic precursor for the
  synthesis of nonessential amino acids. a Asparagine (Asn), the dominant amino acid
  in the phloem sap diet of the pea aphid [], aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu) and

  amino acids for the holosymbiont []. b–d Both A. pisum and Buchnera APS retain glycolysis
