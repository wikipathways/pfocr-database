caption: The RLR, TLR and JAK-STAT signalling pathways and interference of signalling
  pathways by structural and non-structural proteins of coronaviruses. Endosomal TLR3
  and TLR7 recognise dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively, leading to activation of NF-κB,
  which can promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR3 also triggers
  IRF-3 activation leading to IFN production. In the JAK-STAT pathway, binding of
  the receptor leads to its autophosphorylation. Then, Tyk2 and JAK1, which are bound
  to the intracellular domain of IFNAR, are activated and cause subsequent phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerise and associate with a
  transcriptional regulator IFR9 (IFN regulatory factor 9), forming the heterotrimeric
  transcriptional factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Then, ISGF3
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to the ISRE promoter of target ISGs. Several
  coronavirus proteins, which evade anti-viral immune response, are also shown.
