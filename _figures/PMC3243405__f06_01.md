caption: IBA metabolism pathway in the peroxisome.An uncharacterized acyl-activating
  enzyme (AAE) activates IBA by the addition of a CoA moiety. The IBA-CoA derivative
  goes through a single β-oxidation cycle, resulting in its sequential oxidation,
  hydration, oxidation, and thiolysis to yield IAA-CoA and an acetyl-CoA. The putative
  enzymes involved in each of these catalytic steps are indicated. The IAA-CoA thus
  generated is hydrolysed by the activity of an unknown thioesterase to release the
  active auxin IAA. The conversion of 2,4-DB to 2,4-D most likely follows the same
  cascade of enzymatic reactions differing only in the initial step, where AAE18 probably
  catalyzes the activation of 2,4-DB. For further details see text in .
