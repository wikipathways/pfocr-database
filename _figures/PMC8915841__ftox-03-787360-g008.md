caption: Schematic illustration of the combinatorial regulation of mouse IL-22 via
  AhR and TLR/NF-κB in macrophages. 1) AhR ligands such as TCDD or PM containing PAHs
  activate the AhR signaling pathway and enhance DNA binding of AhR and RelB on the
  IL-22 promoter. PM derived from various sources like traffic emissions, combustion
  or wildfires may also contain components such as endotoxin or metals which activate
  TLR and NF-κB. 2) TLR ligands including LPS bind to TLR and activate NF-κB (p65/p50)
  inducing DNA binding activity of NF-κB and RelB. Activation of both AhR and NF-κB
  signaling leads to a synergistic induction of IL-22.
