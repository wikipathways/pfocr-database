caption: The canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. WNT (−). Under physiologic circumstances,
  the cytoplasmic β-catenin is linked to its destruction complex, consisting of APC,
  AXIN, and GSK-3β. After CK-1 phosphorylates on Ser45 residue, β-catenin is phosphorylated
  on Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 residues by GSK-3β. Thus, phosphorylated β-catenin is
  destroyed into the proteasome. Then, cytoplasmic level of β-catenin is kept low
  in the non-presence of WNT ligands. If β-catenin is not accumulated in the nucleus,
  the TCF/LEF complex does not stimulate the target genes. DKK1 inhibits the WNT/β-catenin
  pathway through the bind to WNT ligands or LRP5/6. WNT (+). When WNT ligands activate
  both FZD and LRP5/6, DSH is stimulated and phosphorylated by FZD. Phosphorylated
  DSH in turn activates AXIN, which comes off β-catenin destruction complex. Thus,
  β-catenin escapes from phosphorylation and then accumulates in the cytoplasm. The
  accumulated cytosolic β-catenin moves into the nucleus, where it interacts with
  TCF/LEF and stimulates the transcription of target genes.
