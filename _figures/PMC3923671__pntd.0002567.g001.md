caption: T cell contraction after resolution of an immune response is usually accomplished
  through a combination of mitochondria- and death receptor–dependent mechanisms.
  As a result of T cell expansion, survival factors as IL-2 become scarce, and signalling
  through survival pathways, like the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway,
  ceases, allowing FoxO3-dependent Bim induction. Bim promotes mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by relieving the inhibitory effect that antiapoptotic
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL exert on proapoptotic Bax and Bak. MOMP results in cytochrome-c
  release from the mitochondria, enabling activation of a supramolecular complex,
  the apoptosome that activates caspase-3. By processing numerous cellular substrates,
  activated caspase-3 ensures completion of the execution phase of apoptosis. T cell
  activation also induces Fas ligand expression in T cells, which, by engaging the
  death receptor Fas, enables caspase-8 activation at the death-inducing signalling
  complex (DISC). Caspase-8 then activates caspase-3. If the levels of caspase-8–activated
  caspase-3 are not sufficient to undertake apoptotic cell death, a mitochondrial
  amplification loop may occur through caspase-8–mediated Bid cleavage. This generates
  tBid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that promotes MOMP by activating Bax and
  Bak.
