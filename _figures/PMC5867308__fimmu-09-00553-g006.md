caption: Galactosylation of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) affects C1q occupation and
  activation in autoimmune remission and flare. In autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid
  arthritis, disease severity is negatively correlated with the degree of galactosylation
  found in total IgG. Galactosylation of IgG is important for binding to C1q, where
  a higher degree of IgG Fc galactosylation—and sialylation—increases the affinity.
  Additionally, C1q requires multimerization/hexamers of IgG for proper activation.
  During remission (left), C1q-autoantibody engagement might be prevented by preferential
  interaction with aspecific highly galactosylated IgG, which is abundantly present.
  During a flare (right), the total IgG galactosylation is low, which reduces the
  overall threshold of C1q binding, allowing for relatively better binding of pathogenic
  IgG/immune complexes, allowing activation of the classical complement pathway (green
  lightning bolt).
