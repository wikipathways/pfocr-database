caption: 'lncRNA affects drug resistance in breast cancer cells(A) lncRNAs participate
  in endocrine therapy resistance: lncRNA H19 increases endocrine therapy resistance
  by promoting autophagy and ERα expression. lncRNA TMPO-AS1 stabilizes the mRNA of
  ERα-encoding gene ESR1, leading to endocrine resistance. In addition, ROR promotes
  the degradation of ERK-specific phosphatase DUSP1, thereby enhancing ERK phosphorylation,
  activating ER signal transduction independent of estrogen, leading to intrinsic
  resistance to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, UCA1 confers tamoxifen resistance
  by regulating the EZH2/p21 axis. In contrast, GAS5 negatively regulates endocrine
  therapy resistance through PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling. (B) lncRNAs participate in HER2-targeted
  therapy: lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 promotes the translation of HER2 by binding to AUF1 or
  is packaged into exosomes, acting on recipient cells to promote resistance to HER2-targeted
  therapy. AGAP2-AS1 increases H3K27 acetylation in the MyD88 promoter region and
  activates the NF-κB signaling pathway to resist HER2-targeted therapy. In addition,
  SNHG14 can inhibit trastuzumab-induced apoptosis by upregulating Bcl2. (C) lncRNAs
  in breast cancer chemoresistance: the activation of NF-κB mediated by lncRNA BORG
  can inhibit chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. lncRNA can affect the cell cycle by
  regulating the cycle-related proteins in breast cancer to participate in chemotherapy
  resistance, for example, LINC00511, HIF1A-AS2, and AK124454. PTENP1 and LINC00968
  regulate breast cancer chemotherapy resistance by activating PIK/AKT and WNT/catenin,
  respectively. (D) lncRNAs are involved in immunosuppression: LINK-A caused cAMP
  and PKA-mediated reduction of TRIM71 phosphorylation. The reduction of TRIM71 phosphorylation
  will enhance the degradation of PLC, leading to downregulation of antigenicity.
  lncRNA SNHG1 regulates the differentiation of Tregs by regulating the expression
  of IDO, thereby affecting the immune escape of breast cancer. lncRNA INCR1 regulates
  tumor interferon signaling. The main transcript of INCR1 binds to HNRNPH1 to block
  its inhibitory effect on neighboring genes PD-L1 and JAK2, thereby promoting the
  expression of PD-L1 and JAK2.'
