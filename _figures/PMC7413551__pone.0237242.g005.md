caption: Ommochrome is synthesized through a series of enzymatic reactions employing
  tryptophan as the substrate. Most genes encoding these enzymes were up-regulated
  in the rep-1 mutant especially at 24h after oviposition. The vertical axis is defined
  as the ratio of expression of rep-1 mutant / expression of wildtype. If the ratio>
  2 or <0.5, it indicates that there are differences in expression quantity.
