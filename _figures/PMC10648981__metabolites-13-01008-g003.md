caption: Roles of jasmonates in coordinating secondary with primary metabolism. Primary
  metabolism (dark-blue lines) starts with routes of photosynthesis and central carbon
  metabolism. The diverse PSMs belonging to nitrogen-/sulfur-containing compounds,
  phenylpropanoids and terpenoids enable plants to adapt to biotic and abiotic environments
  by mediating ecological interaction. Plant hormones auxin, SA, GAs, BRs, ET and
  JAs are shown in their respective PSM families. JA and bioactive JA-Ile, OPDA and
  CJ are shown to promote the production of PSMs for defense and suppress the primary
  metabolism for growth/development. TCA (tricarboxylic acid), MEP (methylerythritol
  4-phosphate), shikimic acid, malonic acid and mevalonic acid pathways and main catalyzing
  enzymes E4P (erythrose-4-phosphate), PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) and GAP (glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate) are shown.

  description: Roles of jasmonates in coordinating secondary with primary metabolism.
    Primary metabolism (dark-blue lines) starts with routes of photosynthesis and
    central carbon metabolism. The diverse PSMs belonging to nitrogen-/sulfur-containing
    compounds, phenylpropanoids and terpenoids enable plants to adapt to biotic and
    abiotic environments by mediating ecological interaction. Plant hormones auxin,
    SA, GAs, BRs, ET and JAs are shown in their respective PSM families. JA and bioactive
    JA-Ile, OPDA and CJ are shown to promote the production of PSMs for defense and
    suppress the primary metabolism for growth/development. TCA (tricarboxylic acid),
    MEP (methylerythritol 4-phosphate), shikimic acid, malonic acid and mevalonic
    acid pathways and main catalyzing enzymes E4P (erythrose-4-phosphate), PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate)
    and GAP (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) are shown.
