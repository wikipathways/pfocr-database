caption: Host cellular contribution in regulating early viroplasm dynamics. Following
  entry to the host cell, RV NSP2, and NSP5 initiate viroplasm biogenesis. Nucleation
  of the viroplasm starts with the cytoplasmic, dispersed NSP2 (dNSP2) which phosphorylates
  itself by the intrinsic NTPase and autokinase activity. NSP2 further interacts with
  Lipid droplets (LDs) and hypophosphorylated NSP5. Host cellular protein CK1α localizes
  to viroplasms and phosphorylates NSP2 (at serine 313) and NSP5 (at serine 67). NSP5
  is also phosphorylated by another host cellular kinase CKII and by the kinase activity
  of NSP2. Gradually, NSP5 becomes hyperphosphorylated and dNSP2 gets converted into
  viroplasmic NSP2 (vNSP2) through conformational changes. The size of the viroplasms
  and LDs continues to increase over time and the maturing viroplasms accumulate other
  viral proteins such as VP1, VP2, and VP6. An active ubiquitin proteasome system
  (UPS) is required for the early dynamics of viroplasms. Proteasome inhibition by
  small molecules (by MG132 and Bortezomib) leads to smaller viroplasmic size and
  abrogated translocation of VP1, VP2, and VP6 into the viroplasms. Inhibiting LD
  biogenesis by targeting the enzymes of the LD synthesis pathway or promoting LD
  fragmentation compromises early viroplasm dynamics. Notably, SUMOylation of NSP5
  at multiple lysine residues has been shown to be important for NSP5-VP2 induced
  viroplasm-like structure (VLS) formation. However, the importance of NSP5 SUMOylation
  in viroplasm formation under natural infection scenarios is questionable.
