caption: The 3-Gene Lycopene Pathway and its Implementation with an Operon Design.
  (A) The lycopene pathway is made up of only 3 enzymes (CrtE, CrtB and CrtI) - making
  it a very popular test bed in metabolic and combinatorial pathway engineering. (B)
  The design is made up of 3 genes in the set order CrtE-CrtI-CrtB. An inducible promoter
  is used to drive the operon and an insulating element RiboJ is inserted post promoter.
