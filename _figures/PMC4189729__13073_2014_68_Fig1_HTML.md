caption: 'Synthetic lethality as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MMR-deficient
  cancers. (A) DNA mismatch repair is a stepwise process. In the schematic the MutSα
  heterodimer (Msh2-Msh6) recognizes a single-base mispair while MutSβ (Msh2-Msh3)
  primarily (but not exclusively [-]) initiates the repair of larger insertions/deletions
  (IDLs) of two to four bases. Recognition activates the recruitment of MutLα (Mlh1-Pms2)
  and multiple downstream factors (for example, Exo1, PCNA, RFC, RPA, and DNA pol
  δ) for repair by lesion excision and strand resynthesis. Each MutS also has roles
  independent of these downstream effectors of MMR: as an example, MutSα associates
  with cell cycle regulators at sites of DNA damage to mediate arrest and apoptosis
  [], while MutSβ contributes to the repair of double-strand breaks via recombinatorial
  single-strand annealing [,]. Mutations in many factors from this pathway are associated
  with cancer. (B) Loss of A (for example, MSH2) is a common initiating event in many
  colorectal cancers. Candidate screening seeks to identify and exploit negative genetic
  relationships (synthetic sick/lethal) to selectively kill cells that harbor the
  MSH2 deficiency, but spare those lacking this cancer-related alteration.'
