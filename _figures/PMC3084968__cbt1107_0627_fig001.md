caption: MTAP metabolic pathway. In normal cells, MTAP cleaves MTA, a by-product of
  polyamine biosynthesis, into adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P).
  Adenine is converted to AMP by the ubiquitous enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (APRT), with phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) serving as donor of the phosphoribosyl
  group. MTR-1-P is converted by a series of steps to methionine. AMP is also produced
  in cells by de novo purine biosynthesis. In addition to APRT, other cellular phosphoribosyltransferases,
  such as hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and orotate phosphoribosyltranferase,
  convert purines and pyrimidines to nucleotides.
