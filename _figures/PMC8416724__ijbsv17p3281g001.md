caption: '“Don''t eat me” and “don''t find me” signal. The binding of CD47 to SIRPα
  on phagocytes inhibits phagocytosis, which functions as “don''t eat me” signal,
  whereas the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 serves as “don''t find me” signal that inhibits
  T cell killing. APCs: antigen present cells.'
