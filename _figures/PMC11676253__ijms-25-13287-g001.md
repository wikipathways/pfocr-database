caption: Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), signaling pathway in granulosa cells. This
  figure shows AMH binding to its receptor Anti-Müllerian Hormone Receptor Type 2
  (AMHR2) on granulosa cells, regulating folliculogenesis. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone
  Receptor (FSHR), and Androgen Receptor (AR) are also depicted, reflecting their
  roles in follicular development and hormone response. AMH modulates follicle recruitment
  and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) sensitivity, essential for ovarian reserve
  and fertility. Created with BioRender.com
