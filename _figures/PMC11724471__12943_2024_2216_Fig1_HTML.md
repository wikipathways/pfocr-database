caption: KRAS proteins and metabolic pathways affected by oncogenic KRAS mutation.
  A Illustration for the KRAS splicing variants, KRAS4A and KRAS4B. B KRAS protein
  structure, including the P-loop, Switch I, Switch II, and HVR. C Mechanisms of KRAS
  activation. D Glucose, glutamine, and lipid metabolism pathways affected by oncogenic
  KRAS. Oncogenic KRAS enhances glycolysis by upregulating the expression of GLUTs,
  which increases glucose uptake. This glucose is subsequently phosphorylated to G6P
  by HK1/2. G6P then enters the PPP, producing NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate essential
  for nucleotide synthesis. In addition, G6P is directed into the HBP, generating
  UDP-GlcNAc, a critical substrate for protein glycosylation. During the last stage
  of glycolysis, LDH converts pyruvate to lactate. KRAS mutation enhances glutamine
  uptake and its conversion to glutamate by GLS, which feeds into the TCA cycle. This
  metabolic shift involves the downregulation of GDH and upregulation of GOT, facilitating
  aspartate export and its conversion to NADPH via malic enzyme 1, supporting nucleotide
  biosynthesis and redox balance. Lipid metabolism is reprogrammed in KRAS-mutant
  cancer cells, with increased activation of ACS, promoting lipid biosynthesis, uptake,
  storage, and degradation. KRAS mutations also promote autophagy by modulating the
  AMPK-mTOR signaling axis, which senses nutrient availability and regulates autophagic
  processes, further supporting the tumor’s metabolic demands. Glu, glucose; GLUT,
