caption: Membrane-associated APP is processed through non-amyloidogenic or amyloidogenic
  pathway, resulting in the production of sAPPα (green) and Aβ (red), respectively.
  Depending on the cellular conditions, these two fragments can exist as monomer,
  and/or homo/heterodimer. The interaction of sAPPα and LRP1 receptor may induce internalization
  of Aβ into neuronal cells as an sAPPα/Aβ heterodimer. Additionally, we also hypothesize
  that LRP1 can transfer this heterodimer across blood-brain-barrier into peripheral
  circulation, and which then could be phagocytosed by monocytes (Figure 2a). We hypothesize
  that sAPPα could shuttle Aβ to the endothelial LRP1 at the abluminal side and remove
  Aβ out the brain to the periphery (Figure 2b). Additionally. SR-A as another possible
  receptor expressed on microglia cell surface, may also involved in sAPPα-mediated
  Aβ clearance by microglia (brain) and monocyte (peripheral system) (Figure 2c).
  The secreted sAPPα (both N- and C- terminal) fragements bind to their neuron membrane
  receptor P75NTR and initiate neurite outgrowth (Figure 2d). In addition, sAPPα protects
  neuronal cells by disrupting the dimerization of APP (Figure 2e). Furthermore, sAPPα
  can triggers expression of neuroprotective genes (IGF-2 and transthyretin) through
  NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling which provides neuronal outgrowth and survival (Figure
  2f). sAPPα also reduce tau-pathology by inhibiting GSK3β and BACE1 activity (Figure
  2h).
