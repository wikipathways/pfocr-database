caption: Biosynthetic pathway for PQQ. A five-residue portion of PqqA (Glu-Val-Thr-Leu-Tyr)
  is depicted. The radical SAM enzyme PqqE forms a C-C crosslink between the Glu and
  Tyr residues with the assistance of PqqD. Protease activity (perhaps involving PqqF)
  trims the compound to just the crosslinked dimer, which is oxidized by the iron-containing
  enzyme PqqB. Imine formation followed by tautomerization yields the AHQQ intermediate.
  PqqC then catalyzes four sequential two-electron oxidation steps, three of which
  use O2 and form H2O2 whereas one step uses H2O2 and forms two molecules of water.
