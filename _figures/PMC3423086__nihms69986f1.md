caption: During maturation Notch undergoes Furin-dependent S1 cleavage. Following
  interaction with Delta, Notch undergoes metalloprotease-dependent S2 cleavage. The
  Notch Extracellular Domain (NECD) is released and the Notch Extracellular Truncated
  (NEXT) fragment that remains is a substrate for a gamma-secretase complex that releases
  the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). NICD functions as a transcriptional activator
  in a complex with CSL proteins and Mastermind (MAM) to activate target hairy E(spl)
  related (her) genes.
