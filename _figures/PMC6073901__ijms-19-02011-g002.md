caption: Proposed model for a signaling network between Notch, HIF-1α, and GPER in
  cancer epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). In hypoxic breast cancer cells,
  HIF-1α accumulation increases γ-secretase activity and in turn NICD generation.
  In the nucleus, NICD and HIF-1α cooperates for the induction of Snail gene expression.
  Also, HIF-1α indirectly regulates Snail protein stability by inducing the expression
  of LOX gene. E2-activated GPER may potentiate the effect of hypoxia on Notch-dependent
  expression of Snail by directly inducing transcriptional activation of both Notch-1
  and HIF-1α. In normoxic breast cancer cells, E2/GPER induces both Notch-1 expression
  and activation of the Notch core pathway, hence leading to the induction of Snail-1
  expression. In addition, E2/GPER may potentiate Notch-dependent expression of Snail
  by inducing HIF-1α expression and HIF-1α-dependent transcriptional activity. Red
  arrows indicate mechanisms shown in hypoxic cells; blue arrows indicate mechanisms
  shown in normoxic cells; black arrows indicate mechanisms shown in both normoxic
  and hypoxic cells.
