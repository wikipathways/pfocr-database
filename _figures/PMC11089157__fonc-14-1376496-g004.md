caption: Post-translational regulation of FOXK2. Cisplatin-induced DNA damage and
  various other factors activate the protein ATM, triggering the phosphorylation of
  CHK2. Phosphorylated CHK2 further enhances the phosphorylation of FOXK2. However,
  phosphorylated FOXK2 binds to 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation
  into the nucleus. As a result, the inhibition on ATGs is lifted, leading to tumor
  cell survival and drug resistance. In addition, insulin signaling, specifically
  via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, plays a role in inhibiting the phosphorylation of
  GSK3 on FOXK2. This inhibition facilitates the nuclear translocation of FOXK2, promoting
  the expression of insulin response genes involved in cell proliferation, mitochondrial
  biosynthesis, and fatty acid oxidation. FOXK2 is also regulated by SUMOylation.
  PIAS4 catalyzes the SUMOylation of FOXK2, which facilitates its entry into the nucleus,
  and promotes de novo nucleotide synthetic gene expression, such as PRPS1 and CAD.
  In the context of tumor proliferation and drug resistance, 5-FU inhibits the SUMOylation
  of FOXK2, reducing tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance. FOXK2 undergoes
  acetylation catalyzed by CBP, leading to its translocation to the cytoplasm. However,
  SIRT1 catalyzes the deacetylation reaction, enabling FOXK2 to bind more effectively
  to the target promoter region. This regulation of gene expression and modulation
  of mitotic catastrophe ultimately contribute to tumor proliferation and drug resistance.
  It’s worth noting that cisplatin can also promote the acetylation and translocation
  of FOXK2 into the cytoplasm, affecting its function
