caption: 'Schematic overview of TLR signaling pathway in neutrophilic and eosinophilic
  asthma. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as respiratory viruses
  (e.g., rhinovirus) are detected by TLRs. Subsequently, TLR3 and TLR7/8 trigger TRIF
  and MyD88 pathways, respectively, followed by the transcription of NF-κB in nucleus
  and the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, inducing eosinophilic asthma. TLR2
  and TLR4 induce MyD88 and MyD88 as well as TRIF cascades, respectively, followed
  by the transcriptions of MAPK and NF-κB into nucleus, triggering the release of
  IL-1β and IL-8 and the onset of neutrophilic asthma. MAPK: mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor-κB; TLR: Toll-like receptor; TRIF: Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain containing adaptor
  protein inducing IFN-β.'
