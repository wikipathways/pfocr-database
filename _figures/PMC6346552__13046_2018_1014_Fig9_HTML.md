caption: Schematic of proposed molecular model of non-coding RNAs involved in CXCL12/CXCR4-induced
  CRC invasion and progression. Activation of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis upregulates LncRNA
  XIST. LncRNA XIST functions as a ceRNA sponging miR-133a-3p, thereby upregulating
  RhoA, which promoted actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility through the
  ROCK/p-MLC pathway

  through activation of RhoA signaling by sponging miR-133a-3p.
