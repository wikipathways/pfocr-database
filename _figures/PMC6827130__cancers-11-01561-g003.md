caption: 'Dual synthetic lethality strategies: (A) Dual cellular synthetic lethality—inhibition
  (inh) of PARP1 gives a chance to simultaneously eliminate DNA-PK (DNA-dependent
  protein kinase)—deficient quiescent and BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility protein)-deficient
  proliferating cancer cells accumulating high numbers of DSBs, with no harm for BRCA-proficient
  normal cells; (B) dual pathway synthetic lethality—simultaneous inhibition of RAD52
  and PARP1 exerts synergistic synthetic lethality effect against BRCA-deficient cancer
  cells with no toxicity to BRCA-proficient cells; (C) dual molecular synthetic lethality—anti-PARP1
  activity of the combination of NAD-like inhibitor (NLi) reducing the catalytic activity
  of PARP and non-NAD-like inhibitor (nNLi), which abolishes activation of PARP1 by
  histone H4, resulting in synergistic effect eliminating BRCA-deficient cancer cells.'
