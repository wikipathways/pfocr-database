caption: 'Schematic overview of the complement system. The complement cascade is initiated
  either via the fluid-phase formation of C3(H2O) (alternative pathway; AP) or through
  pattern recognition on a surface by either lectins (mannan-binding lectin; MBL,
  ficolins; Fcn, or collectins; CL) complexed with MASP-1 and MASP-2 (lectin pathway)
  or C1q complexed with C1r and C1s (classical pathway). All pathways lead to the
  formation of C3 convertases (C3bBb or C4b2b), which further cleave the central protein
  of the cascade, complement C3, into the small anaphylatoxin C3a and the larger fragment
  C3b. Deposition of the opsonins C4b and C3b on targeted surfaces mediates signaling
  through complement receptors (CR) on immune cells, induces cell activation, and
  facilitates phagocytosis. In parallel, C3b deposition perpetuates the cascade by
  forming new C3 convertases via the AP, also referred to as the amplification loop.
  This positive feedback loop leads to more C3b deposition that, at a sufficient density,
  turns C3 convertases into C5 convertases, which cleave C5 into the small anaphylatoxin
  C5a and the larger C5b. C5b is a nucleus for the formation of the membrane attack
  complex (MAC, C5b-9), via subsequent binding of C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9, forming
  the lytic pore. C5a and C3a induce chemotaxis and inflammatory responses via their
  C5a and C3a receptors (C5aR1/C5aR2 and C3aR, respectively) but are quickly degraded
  in plasma to their less potent forms C5a-desArg and C3a-desArg, respectively. The
  cascade is regulated at various steps, here indicated in red. FH and FHL-1 control
  the alternative pathway, whereas MAPs and C1-INH control the initiation of the lectin
  or classical pathway, with the latter acting on both. On the host surface, several
  additional regulators act on the formation of C3 convertases, as well as acting
  as co-factors for the degradation of the opsonins by FI. The extent of cleavage
  by FI depends on its co-factor: (1) C3(H2O) to iC3(H2O) requires FH/FHL-1; (2) C3b
  to iC3b occurs in the presence of FH, FHL-1, CD46 (or membrane cofactor protein;
  MCP), CR1 and the more recently described Sez6 protein family and CSMD1; (3) iC3b
  is further degraded to C3dg in the presence of CD46, CR1, Sez6, and CSMD1; (4) C4b
  is degraded to iC4b; and (5) subsequently C4d in the presence of C4BP, CR1, CD46,
  and CSMD1. While the remaining fragments can no longer perpetuate the complement
  cascade, they are still ligands for CRs. The decay of the convertases is accelerated
  by CD55 (or decay accelerating factor; DAF), CR1, CSMD1, FH/FHL-1, and Sez6 (C3b-based
  convertases only), and C4BP (C4b-based convertases only). The formation of the lytic
  ring by C9 is inhibited by CD59. New regulatory steps continue to be uncovered,
  including FHRs that might regulate FH/FHL-1, thereby preventing complement inhibition,
  whereas FHR-5 might add a new class of regulators to the system, acting specifically
  on C5 convertases. The extent of properdin stabilizing the C3b-based convertases
  remains topic of debate, possibly acting as a pattern recognition molecule for the
  alternative pathway or even comprising its own pathway in parallel to the three
  traditional ones. The role of MASP-3, a splice variant of the LP zymogen MASP-1,
  has only recently been appreciated, essentially enabling the maturation of pro-FD
  into FD'
