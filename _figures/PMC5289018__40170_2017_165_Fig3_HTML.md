caption: Schematic representation of the influence of α-KG levels and compartmentalization
  on PHDs and ATP synthase. PHDs have a dual role in the context of cell response
  to resources availability. PHDs control both adaptations to reduced oxygen levels,
  through HIF1α destabilization, and to nutrient availability via mTOR promotion.
  Cytosolic accumulation of α-KG may promote both PHDs and mTOR pathway and may inhibit
  HIF1 signaling. Conversely, mitochondrial accumulation of α-KG may prevent mTOR
  activation through the ATP synthase inhibition
