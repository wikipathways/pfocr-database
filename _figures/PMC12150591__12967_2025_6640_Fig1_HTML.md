caption: ROS function as critical mediators in tumor development and progression.
  Excessive ROS levels lead to oxidative damage of cellular components, including
  DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in genetic mutations and genomic instability
  that initiate tumorigenesis. Moreover, ROS influence tumor progression by promoting
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion,
  and stimulating angiogenesis through the activation of signaling pathways such as
  MAPK and PI3 K/Akt. This figure was created specifically for this article with BioRender
