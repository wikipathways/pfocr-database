caption: The interaction and localization of proteins belonging to the integrin signaling
  pathway and found in samples 2 and/or 3. The focal adhesion proteins paxillin (PXN),
  vinculin (VCL), PTK2 as well as ADB-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), marked by a green
  rim, may be influenced by the protein of ASAP1 (Arf-GAP with SH3 domain, ANK repeat
  and PH domain-containing protein 1), marked by a red rim, found only in sample 2
  as well as by p130cas and Mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) proteins, marked
  by a blue rim, found only in sample 3. Arrows indicate interaction; schemes of a
  membrane bilayer, a nucleus (circle) and a mitochondrion outline localization.
