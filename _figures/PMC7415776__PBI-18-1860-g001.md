caption: 'Metabolic rewiring of cyanobacterial central metabolism with a synthetic
  acetate‐acetyl‐CoA/malonyl‐CoA (AAM) bypass for improved photosynthetic production
  of acetone from CO2. (a) Metabolic rewiring of heterologous acetate biosynthesis
  and assimilation pathway (an acetate‐acetyl‐CoA [AA]‐bypass). M‐module is composed
  of PPS, PPC, and methyl malonyl‐CoA carboxyltransferase (MMC), acetyl‐CoA and CO2
  are inputs and the output is malonyl‐CoA (shown in yellow). The synthetic AA‐bypass
  in the central metabolism of the PAd (wild type with the heterologous pdc gene encoding
  for pyruvate decarboxylase and the Ald6 gene [Ad] encoding for acetate aldehyde
  dehydrogenase) and PAdAs (PAd with the acs* encoding for acetyl‐CoA synthaseL641P,
  [As]) is shown in red. The native metabolism is shown in grey. (b) Metabolic rewiring
  of the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass and acetone‐producing pathway. To demonstrate
  the potential of AA‐bypass in increasing the acetyl‐CoA pool, the synthetic acetone
  pathway was reconstructed as either a AtAaD pathway (At, the atoB gene encoding
  for thiolase; Aa, the atoDA encoding for acetoacetyl‐CoA transferase; D, the adc
  gene encoding for acetoacetate decarboxylase) or as a NAaD pathway (N, the nphT7
  gene encoding for thiolase/acetoacetyl‐CoA synthase; Aa, the atoDA encoding for
  acetoacetyl‐CoA transferase; D, the adc gene encoding for acetoacetate decarboxylase,
  as shown in blue). In addition, a synthetic pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass [an acetate‐acetyl‐CoA/malonyl‐CoA
  (AAM] bypass) was designed to enhance the availability of acetyl‐CoA for the AAM‐bypass.
  An artificial CO2 fixation reaction (Syn6) catalysed by MMC encoded by the codon‐optimized
  mmc gene from Propionibacterium freudenreichii is shown in green. Abbreviations:
  G3P, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate; Mal, malate; ME, malic enzyme; OXA, oxaloacetate;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PPS,
  phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. The details for the strain construction are provided
  in Table .'
