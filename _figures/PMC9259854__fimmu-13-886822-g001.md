caption: Tregs derived from the thymus called as tTregs, which constitutes the majority
  of Tregs in humans. They specifically express Helios, which is reported to be essential
  for the stability of Tregs. In contrast to tTregs, Tregs can also be generated in
  vitro from the naive CD4+ T cells, which are called as induced Tregs (iTregs), which
  do not express Helios. These two cell types also differ in terms of their metabolic
  regulations. iTregs mainly use fatty acid oxidation and have low levels of glycolysis.
  However, tTregs display higher glycolysis activity. In addition, the central metabolic
  regulatory pathway, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling show differences
  in these cells. tTregs are dependent on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2) activity for their functionality, unlike iTregs.
