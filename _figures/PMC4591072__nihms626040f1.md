caption: Overview of putative pathways of catecholamine autotoxicity in a dopaminergic
  neuron. Dopamine (DA) is formed in the cytosol from the action of L-aromatic-amino-acid
  decar-boxylase (LAAAD) on DOPA, which is the immediate product of the rate-limiting
  enzymatic step in DA synthesis, hydroxylation of tyrosine mediated by tyrosine hydroxylase
  (TH). Cytosolic DA can auto-oxidize spontaneously or undergo enzymatic oxidation
  catalyzed by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) in the outer mitochondrial membrane; however,
  the main fate of cytosolic DA is vesicular uptake via the type 2 vesicular monoamine
  transporter (VMAT2). Vesicular DA (DAV) can leak from the vesicles into the cytosol
  or undergo exocytotic release. Most of released DA is taken back up into the cytosol
  via the cell membrane DA transporter (DAT). The action of MAO-A on cytosolic DA
  yields hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). H2O2
  reacts with metal ions to produce reactive oxygen species (in this case hydroxyl
  ions), resulting in oxidative injury including peroxidation of lipid membranes.
  DOPAL cross-links with amino acids in proteins; this can inactivate enzymes (e.g.,
  TH) and transporters. DOPAL is detoxified mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
  to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). A minor pathway of metabolism (not
  shown) is enzyme-catalyzed reduction to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol. Stimulatory
  relationships are indicated by (+) and inhibitory relationships by (−). De-stabilizing
  positive feedback loops are indicated when all signs in a loop are +.
