caption: The pathway of tenofovir (TFV) transport in proximal tubular epithelium cells
  (, , ). Approximately, 20 to 30% of tenofovir is actively transported into renal
  proximal tubular cells by the organic anion transporters hOAT1 and, to lesser extent,
  hOAT3 (, ) at the basolateral membrane. Subsequently, the drug is secreted by ABCC4
  (MRP4), ABCC10 (MRP7) (, , ), and ABCC11 (MRP8) (this study).
