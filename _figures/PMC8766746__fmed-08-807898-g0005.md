caption: Molecular regulation of ureteric budding and branching morphogenesis. (A)
  In wild-type mice, GEN1 may inhibit GREM1 expression, and GREM1 counteracts BMP
  signaling. Additionally, direct negative cross-talk is observed between SLIT2 and
  BMP2-Gremlin signaling. BMP2, BMP4 and ROBO2 inhibit GDNF signal transduction, inhibiting
  budding and subsequent branching of the ureter via RET and GFRα1, thereby restricting
  kidney induction to the appropriate site. (B) In Robo2PB/+Gen1PB/+ mice, decreased
  GEN1 expression led to increased GREM1 expression, and the high local concentration
  of GREM1 competitively inhibited ROBO2, reducing the binding between ROBO2 and SLIT2.
  Prior to UB induction, the nephrogenic cord itself is expanded due to the reduced
  repulsion between ROBO2 and SLIT2 relative to wild-type. In contrast, the increase
  in Grem1 expression exerted an enhanced inhibitory effect on the BMP signaling pathway,
  which may lead to the decreased inhibitory effect of BMP2 and BMP4 on RET in the
  WD. At the molecular level, RET is activated and recruited by GFRα1 and GDNF and
  subsequently activates downstream MAPK/ERK signaling and cell proliferation. As
  RET transcription factor, Etv5 reflects the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling, driving
  ectopic UB induction in more anterior metanephric/caudal mesonephric regions. Gen1
  and Robo2 may exert a synergistic effect on activating the GDNF/RET pathway. WD,
  Wolffian duct; MM, metanephric mesenchyme; UM, ureteric mesenchyme; UB, ureteric
  bud; BMPs, BMP2 and BMP4.
