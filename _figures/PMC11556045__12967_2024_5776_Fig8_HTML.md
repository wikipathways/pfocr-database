caption: STAP2 regulates the advancement of renal fibrosis through the HSP27-PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway. After various factors lead to renal injury, the upregulation
  of STAP2 promotes the interaction between STAP2 and HSP27, further enhancing the
  phosphorylation of HSP27 and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which
  results in the loss of epithelial phenotype in epithelial cells, activation of fibroblasts
  and ultimately results in renal interstitial fibrosis
