caption: Positive feedback regulation of type I IFN response mediated by IFNd-induced
  IRF3 and IRF7 activation in large yellow croaker. The large yellow croaker IFNd
  induced the expression of itself and IFNh by activating IRF3 and IRF7. The dimeric
  form of IRF3 and IRF7 or IRF7 may be transported into the nucleus and bind to the
  corresponding sites in the IFNd promoter, thus upregulating the expression of IFNd.
  The activated IRF3 binds to the IRF3 site 1 (−171bp) present in the IFNh promoter
  and induces the expression of IFNh. In contrast, the large yellow croaker IFNh has
  no effect on the expression of itself and IFNd and expression and phosphorylation
  of IRF3 and IRF7. Both, IFNd and IFNh, are able to induce the expression of ISGs,
  including MxA and PKR, possibly through the Jak–Stat pathway.
