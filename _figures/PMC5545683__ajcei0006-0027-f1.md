caption: Potential mechanisms of celebrex-mediated apoptosis. A. Either through direct
  cox-2 inhibition, or via induction of cyclins A, B and inhibition of cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK) activity, Celebrex inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest.
  B. Cox-2 mediates the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin, which upregulates
  the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin as well
  as increasing the activity of the PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathway.
  These events confer a growth advantage to the tumor cells. Celebrex, via cox-2 inhibition,
  interferes with the generation of prostaglandin resulting in down-regulation of
  anti-apoptotic genes and concurrent induction of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak; facilitating
  the generation of a pro-apoptotic environment. C. In a cox-2-independent, apoptosome-dependent
  manner, Celebrex potentiates the formation of multi-protein complex apoptosome and
  caspase-9 processing, which in turn leads to processing and activation of executioner
  caspases-3, -6, -7, cleavage of death substrates and apoptosis.
