caption: 'Schematic illustration of neutrophil-mediated host defense against pulmonary
  infection with S. pneumoniae. CARD9-mediated signaling plays a critical role in
  host defense against pneumococcal infection through both enhancing neutrophil recruitment
  and promoting neutrophil phagocytosis. Phagocytosis of pneumococcus by neutrophils
  is regulated by the production of serotype-specific IgG through IFN-γ synthesis
  by NKT cells induced by IL-12 produced from dendritic cells via the recognition
  of pneumococcal polysaccharides by dectin-2 (). In contrast, neutrophil infiltration
  may be regulated via the other CLR-CARD9 axis pathway after pneumococcal infection.
