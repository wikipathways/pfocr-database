caption: Phototransduction pathway emphasizing the role of proteins mutated in CACD.
  Light is converted into electric signals inside cone and rod cells. An absorbed
  photon activates rhodopsin, acting through repeated contacts with transducin molecules,
  catalyzing its activation to release GDP in exchange for cytoplasmic GTP, which
  expels its β and γ subunits. The G protein transducin activates the phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), responsible for hydrolyzing cGMP. Afterwards, guanylate cyclase (GC) synthesizes
  cGMP, the second messenger in the phototransduction cascade. Reduced levels of cGMP
  close cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, preventing a further influx of Na+ and Ca2+.
  Mutations in specific genes (represented as light-blue cylinders near respective
  proteins in the figure above) could disrupt this pathway and lead to RPE degeneration,
  a sign of CACD.
