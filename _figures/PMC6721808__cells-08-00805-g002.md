caption: 'Molecular mechanisms to increase glucose turnover in AML. Glucose is converted
  to pyruvate in the course of glycolysis. Pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) and fructolysis
  are alternative strategies to increase glucose consumption in AML. Fructose is transported
  into the cell by GLUT5 and consequently phosphorylated by fructose kinase (FK) to
  fructose-1-P which is funneled into glycolysis. PPP flux is increased in AML, which
  is needed for the generation of NADPH and building blocks. Rate-limiting steps are
  represented by blue boxes. Specific alterations in AML, like high expression levels,
  are shown in red letters and with red arrows. Abbreviations: ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
  AMPK, adenosine monophosphate activated kinase; ANRIL, Antisense RNA In The INK4
  Locus; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FK, fructose
  kinase; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GLUTs, glucose transporters; HK-2, hexokinase-2;
  -P, -phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PI3K/AKT, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT
  pathway; PKF, phosphofructokinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway;
  UCA1, urothelial cancer associated 1. Circled numbers refer to metabolic response
  determinants in AML that are discussed in the Conclusion section.'
