caption: A scheme of the IL-31-mediated itch signaling pathway. In the atopic skin
  lesion, IL-31 is largely secreted by helper T cells and activates specific pruriceptors,
  resulting in the release of NKB from DRG neurons. NKB binds NK3R and induces the
  release of GRP to transmit the IL-31-induced itch sensation in the spinal cord.
  On the other hand, histamine-induced or chloroquine-induced pruritus is transmitted
  via Nppb and GRP, independent of the NKB–NK3R signaling pathway.
