caption: Schematic workflow for establishing the estrogen-response-related risk model
  and a multidimensional evaluation of patients in different risk groups. First, the
  transcriptome data and the corresponding clinical characteristics data of UCEC were
  downloaded from the UCSC Xena browser and cBioPortal. These tumor samples (the Entire
  set) were then randomly classified into the Training set (n = 268) and the Validation
  set (n = 267). The ssGSEA scores of various hallmarks were calculated based on the
  transcriptome profiling of the Entire set and gene sets of MSigDB using ssGSEA.
  We identified that the “Estrogen response late” ssGSEA score was the most significant
  protective factor for OS and DFS in UCEC. Subsequently, the LASSO Cox analysis model
  was used to identify and construct a prognostic gene signature in the Training set,
  further verified in the Validation set and Entire set. Next, UCEC patients from
  the TCGA dataset were divided into low- and high-risk groups according to the median
  risk score. The Kaplan–Meier curves, ROC curves, univariate and multivariate Cox
  regression, and nomogram were performed to identify the independent predictors of
  OS. To elucidate differences in biological characteristics between the two risk
  groups, pathway enrichment, immune landscape, genomic alterations, and therapeutic
  responses were evaluated to satisfy this objective.
