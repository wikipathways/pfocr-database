caption: Biosynthetic pathway of caffeoylquinic acids in plants. The roles of phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase
  (4CL), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), and p-coumaroyl ester 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H)
  are depicted.
