caption: 'Triglyceride breakdown and fatty acid oxidation in oocyte and cumulus cells.
  Triglyceride breakdown: In the presence of hormones or fatty acids, phosphorylated
  PLIN loses the protection on triglycerides and the binding capacity on CGI-58, thus
  activating HSL and ATGL and promoting lipolysis. Fatty acid oxidation: In the presence
  of LH or hCG, 11β-HSD1 in the cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles catalyzes
  corticosterone into active cortisol. Activated PDE promotes the decomposition of
  cAMP, thereby promoting cumulus expansion. PRKA is activated by the AMP phosphorylate
  and inactive ACAC, which then downregulate the conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl
  CoA and promote β-oxidation. cAMP and AMP can also be transported into oocytes via
  gap-junction, thus promoting meiotic maturation together with the ATP from cumulus
  cells and β-oxidation in oocytes. The pathway in the dotted line box showed the
  process of β-oxidation.'
