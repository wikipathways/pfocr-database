caption: Metabolic signaling regulation. Glucose uptake in cells is regulated by Glut1
  transporters that increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This is enhanced
  by cMyc regulation of glutamine uptake in cells. Growth factors influence metabolism
  through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalign pathway contribute to increased
  glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This is inhibited through PTEN. Under
  glucose limiting conditions, AMPK is activated inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway.
  In addition, p53 activaiton inhibits glycolysis, and the mTOR pathway but increases
  oxidative phosphorylation. ROS increases through inefficient oxidative phosphorylation
  at the mitochondria.
