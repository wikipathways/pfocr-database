caption: 'The TGF-β signalling pathway. This pathway is initiated by a TGF-β signal,
  which activates TGFR-2 that in turn activates TGFR-1. The adaptor protein β-II spectrin
  is phosphorylated by TGFR-1 and recruits SMAD proteins to the receptor. The tumour
  suppressor SMAD4, becomes associated with SMAD homologues after they are phosphorylated,
  and a complex, made up of SMAD3, SMAD4, and phosphorylated β-II spectrin, is created
  to maintain signalling that fosters the normal growth of cells. The RBX1–SCF(BTRC)
  complex regulates the proteosomal degradation of SMAD3 by polyubiquitination. Praja1
  is responsible for the proteosomal degradation of β-II spectrin. This occurs after
  specific genes, including CDKN1A (also known as p21), CDKN2B (also known as p15),
  PAI1, and CDH1 have been activated by SMAD complexes. In HCC, as in almost all gastrointestinal
  cancers, the TGF-β pathway is inactivated. NRF2 induces the expression of cytoprotective
  genes and is inhibited by KEAP1, which is associated with an increase in tumour
  cell migration. KEAP1 forms a complex with CUL3–RBX1, which then polyubiquitinates
  NRF2, thereby targeting it for proteosomal degradation. The novel triterpenoid RTA
  402 (which is now in clinical trials for the treatment of HCC) inhibits KEAP1 and
  Praja1 and thereby exerts its antitumour activity. Abbreviations: HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; SBE, SMAD binding element; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TGFR,
  TGF-β receptor.'
