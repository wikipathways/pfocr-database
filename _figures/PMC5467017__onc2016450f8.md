caption: Working model portraying the effects of WNT/β-catenin signaling in PTENWT
  melanoma cells under nutrient starvation conditions. (a) In the absence of a WNT
  ligand that signals via the WNT/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin is targeted by a destruction
  complex (comprising CK1, SCF, GSK-3β, AXIN and APC) for proteasome-mediated degradation.
  Under nutrient starvation conditions (such as in large solid tumors), PTEN drives
  increased autophagy. PTEN blocks PI3K-mediated activation of AKT (PKB), where AKT
  negatively regulates autophagy in response to mitogens (in reality occurring through
  activation of mTOR; not shown). This triggers autophagy addiction in PTEN expressing
  tumors, which does not occur in PTENMut melanomas. (b) In response to a WNT/β-catenin
  signaling ligand, the seven-transmembrane domain FZD receptors (blue/brown color
  in schematic) and LRP5/6 receptor complex, results in activation of DVL, which in
  turn inactivates the destruction complex. Cytoplasmic β-catenin then accumulates
  and is eventually translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription
  factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding element transcription factors to activate/repress
  expression of WNT target genes including SQSTM1 (gene encoding p62), which is transcriptionally
  repressed in response to β-catenin signaling. p62 is an autophagy adaptor that facilitates
  the autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. We propose that
  inhibition of autophagy by WNT/β-catenin signaling in autophagy addicted cancer
  cells, inhibits mitophagy leading to nonselective mitochondrial fusion. This results
  in a highly networked, yet dysfunction mitochondrial population with significantly
  reduced cellular metabolic capacity, which negatively affects tumor cell behavior
  such as motility and metastasis.
