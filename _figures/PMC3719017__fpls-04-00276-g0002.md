caption: Flow chart of the tetrapyrrole pathway toward siroheme, heme, and chlorophyll.
  Enzymes that were transcriptionally affected by Fe deficiency are indicated by red
  (up-regulated genes) or blue letters (down-regulated genes). Numbers indicate delta
  RPKM and fold change of samples from Fe deficient compared with Fe-sufficient plants.
  Arrows denote steps that are likely regulated by the [Fe]. Inset shows the time-course
  of HEMA1 expression in leaves after transfer to Fe-deplete media.
