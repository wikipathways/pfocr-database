caption: Pathway and functional analysis of the P450 gene. (A) The pathway map for
  the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 was obtained from the statistical
  analysis of DEG metabolic pathways from KEGG database comparison; (B,C) the Directed
  Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the biological process and molecular function for P450-related
  differential genes was obtained by GO enrichment analysis using topGO. The depth
  of the color represents the degree of enrichment, with a darker color representing
  a higher degree of enrichment.
