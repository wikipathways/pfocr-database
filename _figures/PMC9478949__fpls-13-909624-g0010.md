caption: Membrane-bound OPPP metabolons facilitate NADPH provision at the cytosolic
  face of the ER. Cooperation of the OPPP metabolon at the ER (with the complete OPPP
  cycle in plastids) to support membrane-bound pathways that consume NADPH in plant
  cells. (A) KCR1 (and ECR) are NADPH-dependent members (white) of the long-chain
  acyl-CoA synthase complex at the ER (LACS1,2,4,8). Chain elongation leads to very
  long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) as precursors of sphingolipids, triacylglycerols
  (TAG), cutins, and waxes. (B) In the phenylpropanoid pathway (starting from plastid-exported
  phenylalanine, Phe), CAD5 is directly NADPH-dependent, whereas C4H, C3H, and F5H
  are cytochrome P450 enzymes (white asterisks) that depend on NADPH:cytochrome P450
  oxidoreductase (ATR) for reduction in the synthesis of lignin and flavonoids. (C)
  Several enzymes of the glucosinolate pathway (CYP79B2/3, CYP71B6) lead from plastid-exported
  tryptophan (Trp) to defense compounds, or in roots via the iPRxP pathway to active
  cytokinins (trans-Zeatin) via IPT4 (palmitoylation weakly predicted) and CYP735A
  that indirectly depends on NADPH (via ATR). DMAPP, dimethylallyl-diphosphate; E4P,
  erythrose-4-phosphate; suc, sucrose; CA, cinnamic acid; TAG, triacylglycerol; tZRxP,
  trans-Zeatin-ribose phosphates.
