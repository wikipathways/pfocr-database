caption: A multiscale mechanical-adapted hydrogel for the repair of IVDD. At the nanoscopic
  level, the fast stress relaxation hydrogel modulates the distribution of the integrin-binding
  domain/actin-binding region of vinculin, promotes earlier adherence of NPCs and
  has more pseudopods that can grip more firmly. At the microscopic level, the fast
  stress relaxation hydrogel further modulates cytoskeletal rearrangement, promotes
  NPC spreading, attenuates the inflammatory microenvironment and inhibits the degradation
  of ECM by blocking the IL-17 signaling pathway. Ultimately, the fast stress relaxation
  hydrogel contributes to NP repair and restoration of mechanical function of the
  IVD after implantation at the macroscopic level
