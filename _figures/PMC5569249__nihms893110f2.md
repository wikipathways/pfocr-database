caption: miRNA pathways in mature immune cell function. Schematic of TLR signaling
  in response to pathogenic stimuli. Following TLR activation, subsequent downstream
  signaling through MyD88/TRAF (shown) or TRAM, TRIF, and TIRAP (not shown) results
  in NFκB nuclear localization, which promotes the expression of several miRNAs, including
  miR-21, miR-101, miR-147, miR-146a/b, and miR-155. MAPK signaling also enhances
  the early inflammatory response by inducing the nuclear translocation and activation
  of AP-1, resulting in the production of early pro-inflammatory mediators such as
  TNF-α and IL-1. miR-155 enhances inflammation by targeting the TLR antagonists SHIP1
  and SOCS1. Conversely, miR-147 antagonizes TLR activation, potentially by targeting
  upstream signaling molecules such as MyD88. miR-146a/b also negatively regulate
  TLRs by targeting the pro-inflammatory molecules IRAK1, IRAK2, and TRAF6. Deregulation
  of TLR signaling occurs in chronic auto-inflammatory disorders, such as RA. Patients
  with RA also exhibit altered expression of miR-155 and miR-146 (red knob-end line),
  further suggesting a link between these miRNA and the TLR signaling pathway. TLRs
  are also expressed on HSCs and drive myeloid-biased proliferation and differentiation
  in response to stimulation with microbial ligands. The aberrant overexpression of
  miR-155 in the bone marrow progenitor compartment leads to the development of an
  MPD in a SHIP1-dependent mechanism (red knob-end line). Conversely, miR-146a (and
  miR-145—not pictured) are deleted in 5q–Syndrome, a subtype of MDS. The MAPK and
  PI3K/Akt signaling cascades also play an important role in the regulation of TLR
  signaling. MAPK signaling is associated with early, NFκB-independent inflammation
  and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 via AP-1.
  miR-101 enhances the inflammatory response by targeting MKP-1, an antagonist of
  both JNK and p38 MAPKs. In contrast, PI3K/Akt signaling has been reported to negatively
  regulate the inflammatory response via the production of IL-10. miR-21 is robustly
  upregulated in response to TLR stimulation, and may target the PI3K inhibitor PTEN
  to drive enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling and the resolution of inflammation by enhanced
  IL-10 production. AP-1, activator protein 1; IRAK1/2, IL-1R-associated kinase 1
