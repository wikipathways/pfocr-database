caption: Hypothetical model for HHT. Model representing TGF-β receptor complex in
  healthy (non-HHT) endothelial cells as compared to HHT1 and HHT2 endothelial cells.
  In healthy endothelial cells (non-HHT), ALK1 and endoglin are cooperating in the
  TGF-β/Smad pathway, and endoglin levels are maintained to meet the physiological
  needs of the endothelial cell. However, in HHT1 and HHT2 cells, either endoglin
  or ALK1 fail in the cooperative signaling. As a result, endoglin expression decreases
  below a critical threshold leading to impaired TGF-β signaling, and abnormal cytoskeleton
  and tube formation in HHT endothelial cells. These altered endothelial cell functions
  may explain the HHT phenotype. Adapted from Fernández-L et al.
