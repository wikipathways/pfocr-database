caption: The key molecular mechanisms governing mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis,
  and mitophagy. Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated by the AMPK-PGC-1α-NRF1/2-TFAM
  signaling pathway, which promotes the formation of new mitochondria. Mitochondrial
  dynamics involve a balance between fission and fusion processes. Fission, mediated
  by Drp1, facilitates mitochondrial division, which is crucial for quality control
  and cellular energy demands. Fusion, regulated by MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, supports
  mitochondrial network integrity and functional maintenance. Mitophagy, a selective
  form of autophagy, is triggered by a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential
  (ΔΨm↓) and involves key regulators such as PINK1, Parkin, NDP52, OPTN, and NIX,
  leading to lysosomal degradation of damaged mitochondria. The mTOR pathway negatively
  regulates both fission and mitophagy, thereby influencing mitochondrial turnover
  and homeostasis. Created in https://BioRender.com
