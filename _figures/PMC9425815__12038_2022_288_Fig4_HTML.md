caption: Key miRNAs and their targets involved in the host cell response to DENV invasion.
  NFκB pathway regulation is most evident by miR-30e-targeted IκBα, miR-146-targeted
  TRAF6, let-7e-targeted EZH2 and vitamin D/miR-155-targeted SOCS5. miR-30e and miR-548g-3p
  directly restrict viral replication, while miR-223 has the same effect by targeting
  STMN1. miR-3614-5p targets ADAR1 to indirectly effect viral genome editing. miR-155
  and let-7c directly regulate the transcription factor BACH1. Exosomal miR-148 taken
  up by microglia activates their inflammatory pathways by targeting the USP3-ATF3
  axis.
