caption: 'Proposed antitumor activity of Alocasia via intrinsic apoptosis. Phosphorylation
  of Bax by Akt or activated Akt disables its translocation to the mitochondrial membrane,
  then decreases permeabilization. p-AKT was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent
  manner, while the treatment did not change AKT expression. It was also found that
  the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased and the expression of Bax protein increased
  which led to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. It was postulated that Alocasia
  works via following mechanism: 1) PI-3 K/Akt pathway of apoptosis; 2) ERK activity
  of apoptosis; 3) triggering of mitochondrial pathway; 4) connection by Bcl-2 and
  Bax; v.G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (). Alocasgenin A represents anticancer compound
  from Alocasia.'
