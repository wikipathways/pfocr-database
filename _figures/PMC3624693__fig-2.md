caption: Eliminative signaling by IFN1. The concept of eliminative signaling (Huangfu
  and Fuchs ) is illustrated specifically on the example of IFN1 responses. IFN1 binds
  to the receptor (IFNAR) to activate JAK (stem signaling). JAK serves as a central
  signaling dispatcher that further distributes the cascades between forward signaling
  (ie, activation of STAT resulting in the transcriptional activation of ISGs) and
  eliminative signaling [ie, activation of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) and subsequent
  downregulation of the receptor]. Unrelated ligands such as vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) could utilize PKD2 or basal
  pathway to eliminate the receptor without benefits of forward signaling and ISG
  induction.
