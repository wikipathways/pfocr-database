caption: 'Metabolomics evidence from four compartments suggests alternate routes for
  observed differences in purine abundances. ATP is degraded in a series of reactions
  to uric acid or allantoin. Under non-stress conditions, this degradation process
  proceeds at a low level. When physiologic conditions change, intermediates in the
  pathway can be diverted to meet these demands. For example, during fasting, IMP
  can be salvaged for the production of ATP thus reducing the level of HX. In our
  study, HX levels are higher at baseline in liver of CPF animals. We propose that
  this observation is a result of increased salvage in FS animals. During ischemia
  5''-nucleotidase acts on AMP to generate adenosine, a potential vasodilator. In
  our study, adenosine levels are ~3X higher in the liver of CPF animals when compared
  to FS animals suggesting a greater need for vasodilation. Metabolites in red were
  identified as VIP metabolites by PLS-DA analysis. Letters in superscript indicate
  the compartment the metabolite was observed in: liver (L), muscle (M), serum (S),
  or urine (U).'
