caption: Schematic representations of the gene regulatory pathway controlled by Oc
  factors in the chordate retina. (A) Oc gene network in Ciona PRC differentiation
  where only genes with a corresponding vertebrate ortholog/paralog are reported.
  (B) Oc gene network in chordate retina obtained by comparing the Ciona and vertebrate
  Oc target genes. Arrows within the gene network solely represent our current understanding
  of network relationships and do not imply genetic mechanisms such as direct or indirect
  transcriptional regulation. Oc-activated targets are on the left, repressed ones
  on the right.
