caption: Unfortunately, the reported synthesis of 4 was extremely inefficient, thus
  creating a major obstacle to developing a comprehensive structure–activity relationship
  (SAR) for this series. Indeed, the most problematic step was the stereorandom glycosylation
  reaction, which resulted in an inseparable 1:1 mixture of α-(trans) and β-(cis)diastereomers
  (, Pathway A). This was not surprising since the presumed intermediate, carbocation
  7, would not be expected to exhibit any facial selectivity. Since it had been established
  that only the β-isomers of nucleoside analogs could act as NRTIs, the Liotta group
  set out to develop a general, β-selective glycosylation strategy that could be useful
  for 3′-heteronucleosides and perhaps could be extended to the syntheses of all 2′-deoxynucleoside
  analogs.
