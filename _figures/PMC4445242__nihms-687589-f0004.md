caption: (A) In ZAP-70 null cells, active Lck sequentially phosphorylates (whereas
  phosphatases denoted by “P” dephosphorylate) the N- and C- terminal tyrosines within
  individual ITAMs, generating singly phosphorylated and later doubly phosphorylated
  ITAMs. (B) In the ZAP-70–reconstituted cells or in ZAP-70AS cells, ZAP-70 weakly
  binds to the singly phosphorylated ITAMs and strongly binds to the doubly phosphorylated
  ITAMs. (C) Active Lck phosphorylates the SH2-linker tyrosine residues Y315 and Y319
  of ZAP-70, generating open ZAP-70. The subsequent phosphorylation by Lck of Y493
  generates active ZAP-70. Active and open forms of ZAP-70 are dephosphorylated by
  phosphatases (Pz). Active and open forms of ZAP-70 phosphorylate a negative regulatory
  site (Y192) in Lck. The phosphatases denoted by “PE” dephosphorylate Lck to return
  it to its active state. Active Lck further regulates ITAM phosphorylation through
  this negative feedback loop.
