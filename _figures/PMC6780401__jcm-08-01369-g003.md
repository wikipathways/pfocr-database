caption: The impacts of mutations in the TGFβ signaling transduction components contribute
  to PDAC development. Overview of the dysregulation TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways
  in PDAC. In canonical TGFβ/Smad pathway, the receptor complexes of TGFβRI and TGFβRII
  are phosphorylated upon TGF-β binding and then activate Smad2/3 (R-Smad). Those
  activated R-Smads form a complex with the Co-Smad Smad4 and this complex is imported
  into the nucleus where in association with other transcription factors to regulate
  transcription of TGFβtarget genes. The TGFβ/BMP pathways’ components that are mutated,
  deleted, or downregulated, are listed and described in the boxes.
