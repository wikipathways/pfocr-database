caption: Summary of the effects of increased dietary fat plus ethanol on the AMPK
  pathway and expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis. In combination
  with ethanol, a moderate fat diet leads to increased LKB1 phosphorylation, decreased
  ACC phosphorylation, but no significant change in AMPK phosphorylation. When dietary
  fat is increased, chronic ethanol consumption decreases LKB1 phosphorylation, increases
  AMPK phosphorylation but has no significant effect on ACC phosphorylation. In both
  models, nuclear localization of SREBP1c and ChREBP are decreased corresponding to
  decreased expression of fatty acid synthetic enzymes. (dec-decreased, inc-increased,
  uc-unchanged).
