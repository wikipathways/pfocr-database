caption: Model of the cellular pathway involved in chemotactic signaling of sperm
  (from , ). Top, molecular components; bottom, sequence of cellular events. Binding
  of peptides to a receptor guanylyl cyclase (GC) increases the intracellular cGMP
  concentration. The sperm hyperpolarizes by opening cGMP-regulated K+ channels. Two
  transporters, a Na+/H+ and a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, export protons and Ca2+, respectively,
  in response to the hyperpolarization; accordingly pHi rises and [Ca2+]i falls. The
  rise in pHi activates an adenylyl cyclase. The increase in cAMP concentration causes
  an influx of Ca2+. In principle, cAMP can stimulate the Ca2+ entry by two different
  mechanisms. First, the hyperpolarization and cAMP activate HCN channels (SPIH; );
  the ensuing depolarization of the cell activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
  Second, cAMP could activate a Ca2+ channel directly.
