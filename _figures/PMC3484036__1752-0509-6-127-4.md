caption: Metabolic network pathway activity in E. coli. (A-C). Differential pathway
  activity between the wild-type E. coli grown anaerobically on glucose minimal media
  and the mutant E. coli Δedd Δgnd grown anaerobically on maltohexoase, fumarate,
  D-glucosamine, phosphate, and sulfate minimal media (Design 1 in Table ). (A) The
  complete metabolic network map, and close-ups (regions framed by red boxes) of (B)
  the citric acid cycle and (C) the lipid metabolism. Metabolic pathway reactions
  are color-coded according to the relative flux differences (color legend for flux
  values in (C) applies to (A-C)) between the engineering designs. Similar metabolic
  network maps for all organisms and Pareto optimal designs can be viewed using the
  Multi-Goal Metabolic Engineering Website (Methods).
