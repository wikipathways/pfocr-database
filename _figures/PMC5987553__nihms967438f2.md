caption: 'Early neurogenesis in cnidarians and basal bilaterians. In boxes (A)-(F),
  key events of early neurogenesis are depicted in a schematic, uniform manner for
  six different animal clades. Represented in the upper panel of each box is a “thumbnail”
  of an embryo of the corresponding clade at the onset of neurogenesis (side view;
  anterior to the left, dorsal up). Territories with neurogenic potential are outlined
  in blue. Role of BMP/BMP antagonist and Wnt signaling pathway, if present, is indicated
  by vertical and horizontal arrows at top right corner of upper panel. Arrows point
  in direction of decreasing activity (i.e., away from source) of these morphogens.
  Numbers in grids (ABCD) at top left capture the elements of early neurogenesis,
  as shown and explained in text section 1 and . Drawings in lower panels of each
  box show schematic cross sections of embryos at sequential stages of development,
  capturing spatial characteristics and proliferatory behavior of neural progenitors.
  The drawings use the color code introduced in  and . As an example, box (A) represents
  early neurogenesis in the cnidarian Nematostella. The Nematostella embryo shows
  generalized neurogenic potential all over the ectoderm (# 1 in grid A; colored blue
  in upper section). Neural cells are scattered stochastically over ectoderm (# 1
  in grid B). Ectodermal cells form neural precursors (orange in upper section; #1
  in grid C) and differentiate as epithelial, sensory neurons or delaminate to become
  ganglion cells (both red in bottom section). Ectoderm also contains dividing neural
  progenitors (# 2 in grid C; purple color in upper section). Based on published reports
  () progenitors appear to divide in ectoderm (bracketed # 1 in grid D). Bracketing
  of numbers generally indicates that the implied aspect of neurogenesis is the most
  likely scenario, based on published data, but needs further confirmation. Bracketing
  of “BMP” indicates that morphogen is present but excerts no effect on neural organization.
  The sign “1>2” in grid A and “1>4” in grid D of box (F) signify that during an early
  embryonic phase of hemichordate neurogenesis, a generalized neurogenic ectoderm
  gives rise to neural precursors forming a nerve net; this is followed in the later
  embryo by a phase where the dorsal ectoderm invaginates as the dorsal neural cord,
  and the ventral ectoderm also gives rise to a ventral cord of higher neuronal density.
  Phylogenetic relationships between clades, in this and the following figures, are
  indicated by thick grey lines/arrows connecting the corresponding boxes. The remainder
  of the clades shown in this figure [(B)-(F)] and the following figures are composed
  in the manner explained for (A)'
