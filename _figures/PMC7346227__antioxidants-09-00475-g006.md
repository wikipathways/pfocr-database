caption: NRF2 downregulates basal Hh pathway activity in NSCLC cells. (a) In NRF2
  WT NSCLC cell lines like H1299, SMO localizes constitutively at cilia, indicative
  of active Hh signaling. In these cells, NRF2 levels are low, as are its effects
  on both PTCH1 gene expression (which it activates via an ARE in its promoter) and
  GLI factors (whose full length-to-repressor ratios (FL/R) and transcriptional activity
  it downregulates via p62/SQSTM1). (b) In NRF2-null (KO) H1299 cells, lack of NRF2
  leads to increased ciliogenic gene expression and increased ciliogenesis, lower
  PTCH1 levels, higher GLI FL/R ratios and higher GLI-luciferase reporter (Gli-Luc)
  activity. (c) In H1299 cells overexpressing (O/E) NRF2 (or where NRF2 is stabilized
  by pharmacological or genetic KEAP1 inactivation), ciliogenesis is reduced and PTCH1
  is increased, leading to reduced ciliary SMO. Under these conditions, GLI ratios
  and activity are lower, due to the combined effects of NRF2 on both PTCH1 and p62.
  Given that PTCH1 is a transcriptional target of both GLI and NRF2, higher PTCH1
  levels in these cells suggest that NRF2 activation has a stronger effect on PTCH1
  than GLI activity reduction. Similarly, in NRF2 KO H1299 cells (b), NRF2 loss predominates
  over increased GLI activity [].
