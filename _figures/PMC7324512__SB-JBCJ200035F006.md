caption: Model of the roles of Hippo pathway in VGLL3-low or -high cells. A, Hippo
  pathway–mediated inactivation of YAP/TAZ represses cell proliferation through inhibition
  of TEAD-dependent gene expression (CTGF etc.) in VGLL3-low cells. B, Hippo pathway-mediated
  inactivation of YAP/TAZ facilitates association of VGLL3 with TEAD and then promotes
  cell proliferation through TEAD-dependent gene expression in VGLL3-high cells.
