caption: Aurora B activity suppresses breakage of chromosomes trapped in the midbody
  and stabilizes the midbody to prevent tetraploidization caused by furrow regression.
  In contrast to cleavage furrow formation and ingression, the inhibition of Aurora
  B activity at the stage of abscission facilitates fission of the intercellular bridge,
  indicating that Aurora B activity must decrease enough to allow abscission to occur.
  This mechanism may also prevent chromosome breakage and protect cells from tetraploidization.
  This delay in abscission (called the abscission checkpoint) requires sustained Aurora
  B activity, and its downstream targets include MKLP1 and the ESCRT component CHMP4C.
  Aurora B phosphorylation of MKLP1 seems to stabilize the integrity of the midbody
  and intercellular bridge. Aurora B phosphorylation of CHMP4C on Ser210 imposes an
  abscission delay in response to a chromosome bridge that is trapped in the midbody.
  In concert with CHMP4C, ANCHR prevents VPS4 relocalization from the midbody ring
  to the abscission zone while it is relieved following the inactivation of Aurora
  B, thereby promoting membrane scission. However, it is unclear whether MKLP1, CHMP4C,
  and ANCHR-VPS4 act in the same pathway or whether they function independently downstream
  of Aurora B activity. Additionally, whether phosphatases antagonize Aurora B activity
  to promote abscission remains unknown.
