caption: Signaling by EGF causes the activation of mTORC1 by phosphorylation of mTOR
  at Ser-2448. Activation of mTORC1 leads to the activation of Rac1, and due to its
  proximity to RICTOR component of mTORC2, induces activation of mTORC2 by phosphorylating
  its mTOR at Ser-2481, thereby leads to prostate cancer cell migration.
