caption: Pathway interaction schematic constructed to demonstrate overlap of gene
  expression data with critical osteogenic pathways. Pathways for BMP, HH, and Wnt
  signaling are shown with upregulated genes (gray) and the similarly expressed Runx2
  (black) highlighted. (a) BMP ligands bind with BMP receptor subunits stimulating
  Smad 1/5/8 to couple with Smad 4. (b) HH binding to PTCH1 surface protein prevents
  inhibition of SMO, permitting production of Gli2/3 and subsequent transcription
  of Gli1 and Hip1. (c) Wnt interacting with Fz surface protein leads to release and
  subsequent accumulation of β-Cantenin, which then couples with TCF/LEF and CBP-p300.
  (a–c) BMP, HH, and Wnt pathways culminate in upregulation of crucial osteogenic
  transcription factors, including Runx2 and Sp7. (d) Naive MSCs are stimulated through
  matrix proteins toward osteolineage and differentiate to osteoprogenitor cells expressing
  primary cell attachment proteins, including Col1 and FN. (e) Induction of osteoprogenitor
  cells by osteo-related transcription factors results in early maturation stages
  for OB cells promoting proliferation and expression of ALP. Late-stage development
  of OB cells shows increased expression of osteocalcin (BGLAP) and ON proteins. (f)
  Mature OBs demonstrate reduced proliferative characteristics and enhanced expression
  of osteopontin (SPP1) protein. Matrix mineralization through OB activity during
  differentiation toward osteocytes results in bone mass formation. ALP, alkaline
  phosphatase protein; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; Col1, collagen 1; FN, fibronectin;
  HH, Hedgehog; OB, osteoblastic; ON, osteonectin; SMO, smoothened.
