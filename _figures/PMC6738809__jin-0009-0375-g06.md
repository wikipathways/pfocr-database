caption: Potential mechanisms involved in vitamin D-mediated immunomodulation of neutrophils.
  Infection with S. pneumoniae stimulates TLR2 on neutrophils leading to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the presence of
  IFN-γ, neutrophils upregulate the converting enzyme CYP27B1, which mediates intracrine
  activation of provitamin D and the VDR, resulting in the upregulation of alpha-defensins
  (HNP1–3), which mediate killing of pneumococci. Moreover, vitamin D also induces
  the SOCS proteins SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in an IL-4-dependent manner, leading to the
  downregulation of TRAF6 and NF-κB, thereby regulating the excessive production of
  inflammatory cytokines. Hence, vitamin D simultaneously improves the neutrophil
  killing of pneumococci, while limiting excessive inflammation.
