caption: Inflammation and cancer are linked by both oncogenic (intrinsic) and environmental
  (extrinsic) pathways. The intrinsic pathway is activated by genetic or epigenetic
  alterations in transformed cells. Such alterations include those that cause the
  overexpression or the persistent activation of growth factor receptors with intrinsic
  tyrosine kinase activity and cytokine receptors with associated Janus kinase (JAK)
  family tyrosine kinases. Oncogenic mutations in receptor-associated JAK family members
  also underlie some types of cancer. These receptors (several examples are shown),
  as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as SRC, can be activated by extrinsic
  pathways — environmental factors that are associated with cancer inflammation —
  which include ultraviolet (UV) radiation, chemical carcinogens, infection, stress
  and cigarette smoke. Activated tyrosine kinases induced by both intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
  which in turn forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus, where they directly
  regulate gene expression. In addition to upregulating numerous genes involved in
  proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis, STAT3 induces the expression of
  many cytokines, chemokines and other mediators, such as interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase
  2, that are associated with cancer-promoting inflammation. Importantly, receptors
  for many of these cytokines, chemokines and mediators in turn further activate STAT3,
  thus forming autocrine and paracrine feedforward loops that result in a stable change
  to the genetic programme and the promotion of cancer inflammation. P, phosphorylation.
