caption: Targeting to attenuate the ROS is illustrated and summarized. Glycomimetics
  (C1–C4) suppressed NOX1 and NOX4 expression and enhanced the Nrf2 pathway to reduce
  ROS production. Phloretin activated the LKB1/AMPK/Nrf2 pathway to reduce ROS production.
  In addition, phloretin increases the activity of MnSOD through AMPK/Sirt-3 to decrease
  ROS accumulation. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) and vanillic acid could activate the
  LKB1/AMPK/Nrf2 pathway to reduce ROS generation. Liraglutide promoted GLP-1R/PKA
  and GTPCH1/eNOS signaling pathways to inhibit ROS production. Loliolus beka gray
  meat (LBM) extract, Danzhi jiangtang capsule (DJC), meteorin-like protein (Metrnl),
  and physcion could reduce the ROS production directly. Geraniol (GOH) downregulated
  NOX2-dependent ROS generation. Delta-valerobetaine (δVB) could diminish mitochondrial
  ROS (mtROS). Canagliflozin (CAN) attenuated excess ROS production in endothelial
  cells. Notoginsenoside-R1 (NG-R1) activated the Nrf2 pathway to reduce ROS production
