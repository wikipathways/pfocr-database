caption: Membrane alterations caused by cryopreservation. The cryopreservation process
  can cause alterations of the cellular membrane and specific changes in phospholipid
  organization and bilayer integrity, as well as modifications of the membrane ultrastructure.
  The oxidative damage of membrane lipids caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  overproduction is a key underlying event in cellular damage consequent to cryopreservation.
  An excess of free radicals can derive, for example, from the Fenton reaction or
  other cellular oxidative stress processes that ultimately sustain lipid peroxidation
  and membrane impairment. These include an excess of Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm
  from the extracellular environment and from the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover,
  oxidative stress induces a rapid depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane
  potential and subsequent impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, as well as the
  release of cytochrome c, which is a main trigger of the intrinsic pathway of apoptotic
  cell death. Membrane lipid peroxidation may lead to the formation of eicosanoids
  associated with ferroptotic signaling. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death
  program that is prevented by the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) [].
