caption: Graphical overview of representative exclusively differentially expressed
  genes from our RNA sequencing data in the myeloid and lymphoid group that are clearly
  assigned to the BMP/TGFB signaling pathway. (A) Illustration of representative and
  exclusively differentially expressed genes only in the “all myeloid group” (MPN,
  MDS, AML) and the exclusively overlapping differentially expressed genes only in
  the “all lymphoid group” (B-ALL, B-NHL) (from Figure 5D, black highlighted genes).
  Translation of differentially expressed genes from our mRNA sequencing data (FDR
  q-value < 0.05) from overlapping genes in all myeloid and separately in all lymphoid
  groups to a correlation and potential protein network of these genes as generated
  with STRING database (Version 12.0). STRING visualization was adapted starting from
  TGFB1 as is highlighted with a circle. In the “all myeloid group”, 52 out of 192
  exclusively differentially expressed genes in this group clearly show a direct correlation
  to the TGFB-signaling cascade based on current data in STRING (Version 12.0) (B,
  left side). In the “all lymphoid group”, 26 out of 123 exclusively differentially
  expressed genes in this group clearly show a direct correlation to the TGFB-signaling
  cascade based on current data in STRING (Version 12.0) (B, right side). Overrepresented
  genes are red-circled, and underrepresented genes are blue-circled. (B) Graphical
  overview of further exclusively differentially expressed genes in the respective
  group, myeloid or lymphoid group (contrasted to healthy) that are regulators or
  related to the WNT and BMP/TGFB signaling pathways as well as downstream targets
  of these signaling pathways exclusively in the respective group. (TGFB1*, was significant
  in p-value 0.005, FDR q-value 0.1, B-ALL sample 2 exhibited a lower Transcript per
  million (TPM) expression of TGFB1 than all other samples). (C) Illustration of representative
  and exclusively overlapping differentially expressed genes in the “all myeloid group”
  and the “all lymphoid group” and the relationship to the canonical and non-canonical
  BMP/TGFB signaling pathway. Illustration of DESeq2 Data (p-adjusted < 0.05) reveals
  a clear shift to SMAD-dependent BMP/TGFB signaling in MDS and AML MSCs, while B-ALL,
  B-NHL, and the MPN group exhibit an increase and notable number of differentially
  expressed genes related to SMAD independent MAPK-signaling. (D) Representative pictures
  of MSCs from healthy, myeloid, and lymphoid groups after 14 days of osteogenic differentiation
  together with SD208. DMSO serves as an internal control. MSCs were induced for osteogenic
  differentiation and SD208 was added to each medium change within the osteogenic
  differentiation period. After 14 days of induction, MSCs were stained with Alizarin
  Red. Scale bars indicating 100 µm are shown
