caption: Stimuli are represented by simultaneous brief elevations of synaptic Ca2+,
  nuclear Ca2+, and cAMP. The rate of activation of Raf, upstream of ERK, is also
  briefly elevated. These elevations activate CaMKII, CaMKIV, PKA, and ERK→RSK. CaMKII,
  ERK, and PKA each phosphorylate a site of a synaptic tag. New pathways in this model
  as compared to  are denoted by orange arrows, and ellipse. CaMKII, PKA, and ERK
  converge (orange ellipse) to induce synthesis of PKMζ. PKA, ERK, and CaMKIV each
  phosphorylate a site on a transcription factor (TF) or co-activator, with PKA and
  RSK additively phosphorylating a CREB site. These phosphorylations drive sequential
  histone acetylations necessary for gene induction. Gene induction is represented
  by increase of a plasticity-related protein, C/EBP, and by induction of BDNF, which
  feeds back to activate the Raf -> ERK pathway. Synthesized intracellular BDNF is
  released upon LTP induction, elevating extracellular BDNF, which activates the Ras→ERK
  pathway. Increased TAG, C/EBP, and PKMζ converge to increase a synaptic weight W.
  A slow time constant for W yields L-LTP persistence for several days.
