caption: Xmrk signaling in the Xiphophorus melanoma model. Xiphophorus melanoma receptor
  kinase (Xmrk) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that recruits and activates several
  kinases, transcription factors and adaptor proteins integrated into signaling networks
  to regulate pigment cell cancer transformation. Activation of the kinase, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K), prevents apoptosis in malignant cells, as does activation of the
  transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5),
  via B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-x) signaling, and STAT5 also promotes proliferation. The
  Src kinase protein, Fyn, acts as a docking protein and, through focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK), can induce pigment cell migration. Further, Fyn inhibits MAPK phosphatase
  1 (MKP-1), a repressor of MAPK, causing the promotion of MAPK’s function to increase
  melanoma cell proliferation. Xmrk can also signal via the adaptor proteins, GRB2
  and Sos, to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway, thereby enhancing proliferation.
  Additionally, MAPK signaling causes degradation of the transcription factor, microphthalmia
  transcription factor (MITF), leading to reduced transcription of tyrosinase, which
  decreases melanin synthesis and inhibits pigment cell differentiation. Another function
  of activated MAPK is to induce the synthesis of osteopontin (OPN), which is secreted,
  binds to integrins on the cell membrane surface, and promotes pigment cell survival.
  Several miRNAs that are regulated in fish Xmrk models also have functions in human
  melanoma. The miRNAs miR-18a, -182, and -214, can act to promote migration in human
  melanoma, while miR-182 and -214 can also stimulate cell survival. MiR-17, 125b,
  and -126 act to inhibit melanoma cell migration, with -125b’s action inhibited by
  FAK. MiR-17, along with miR-18a, also function to increase melanoma proliferation.
