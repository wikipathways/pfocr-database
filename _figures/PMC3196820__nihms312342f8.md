caption: A) BMP-2 induces both Smad and MAPK signaling which can drive tenascin expression.
  We found that p38 and JNK drive TnC expression. We propose p38 and Smads drive TnW
  expression through a protein intermediate, represented by X. B) Wnt5a induces TnW
  through p38 and requires a protein intermediate, represented here by Y. We believe
  that Wnt5a induced TnC occurs through a PLC-dependent pathway independent from NFAT.
  C) Oscillatory fluid flow induces MAPK signaling, and JNK mediated the induction
  of TnW, while p38 mediated the TnC response.
