caption: Schematic mechanism of CTGF induction in CF lung epithelial cells. Increased
  expression of miR-155 in CF cells suppresses RPTOR, a direct target of miR-155.
  Suppression of RPTOR, by elevated miR-155 expression in CF cells or pharmacologically
  by rapamycin stimulates TGF-β signaling pathway through SMAD2 phosphorylation, and
  promotes upregulation of CTGF. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β
  signaling (by SB431542) also results in suppression of CTGF.
