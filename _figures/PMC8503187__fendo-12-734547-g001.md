caption: 'Overview of (potentially) ghrelin-modulated appetite-regulating pathways.
  Ghrelin reaches the homeostatic pathway (on the right) via the peripheral circulation
  (hormonal route) and potentially vagus nerve. How and if ghrelin signaling reaches
  the VTA remains unknown. On the left: It is generally considered that ghrelin leads
  to the induction of DA release from the VTA to the NAc in the presence of food,
  but there are inconclusive findings under the absence of food. The VTA has further
  neuronal projections to other brain regions. The DAergic system, including anxiety
  or locomotion modulating circuits, is highly interconnected. On the right: In the
  ARC the two depicted neuronal populations have opposing effects regarding the regulation
  of food intake. Activation of NPY/AgRP neurons induces food intake and activation
  of POMC neurons leads to the suppression of food intake. Ghrelin binds GhrRs on
  NPY/AgRP neurons in the ARC and activates them which leads to the release of GABA,
  NPY and AgRP. GABA inhibits POMC neuronal activity, which leads to the reduction
  of α-MSH release. α-MSH induces neurotransmitter release in the second-order neurons
  located in e.g. the LH and PVN via binding to MC4R. AgRP is a MC4R antagonist, reducing
  neurotransmitter release from the second-order neurons. NPY binds Y1R or Y5R on
  second-order neurons, which inhibits neurotransmitter release. Second-order neurotransmitters
  affect other central regions, which will further mediate the orexigenic effect of
  ghrelin or anorexigenic effect of other factors (e.g. leptin). The interconnectivity
  of the hedonic system and the homeostatic system is indicated with arrows. AgRP,
