caption: 'The figure shows the two major routes for glutamine metabolism in mammalian
  cells, glutaminolysis and reductive carboxylation. In either pathway, glutamine
  is first deaminated to glutamate, which is then converted to α-ketoglutarate via
  glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or transamination. In glutaminolysis, α-ketoglutarate
  is oxidized to malate via the TCA cycle and subsequently decarboxylated to pyruvate
  via malic enzyme (ME) or oxidized to oxaloacetate via malate dehydrogenase (MDH).
  In reductive carboxylation, α-ketoglutarate is reductively converted via isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (IDH) to isocitrate, which is then isomerized to citrate. Abbreviations:
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; ACL,
  ATP citrate lyase; ACO, aconitase; OGDH, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate
  dehydrogenase; FH, fumarase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; GLS, glutaminase.'
