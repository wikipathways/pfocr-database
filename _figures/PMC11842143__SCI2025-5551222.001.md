caption: Developmental signaling pathways regulating osteoblast differentiation. Various
  signaling pathways function in a coordinated manner to ensure appropriate bone development
  and repair. (a) When mesenchymal progenitor (MP) cells express SOX9+, it indicates
  their commitment to the osteochondroprogenitor lineage differentiation. Indian hedgehog
  (IHH) binds to smoothened homologue (SMO), preventing the cleavage of GLI3 into
  the GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) while simultaneously activating the GLI2 activator (GLI2A),
  which subsequently leads to the expression of SOX9 and Runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (Runx2) in osteochondroprogenitor cells. (b) The Notch signaling pathway
  serves as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. The binding of Notch
  to Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like proteins (DLLs) induces the proteolytic cleavage of
  Notch, allowing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to interact with RBPJ and
  Mastermind-like protein 1 (MAML1). This interaction subsequently affects downstream
  targets, including Hairy and Enhancer of Split (Hes) and Hes-related proteins with
  the YRPW motif (Hey), ultimately leading to the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation.
  (c) The canonical Wnt signaling pathway acts as a positive regulator of osteoblast
  differentiation. The binding of Wnt ligands to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5 (LRP5) or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) and
  Frizzled (FZD) leads to the accumulation of β-catenin, facilitating its translocation
  to the nucleus. This translocation influences the expression of genes such as Runx2
  and osterix (OSX), indicating that the cells begin to transition toward mature osteoblasts.
  (d) Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway also serves as a positive
  regulator of osteoblast differentiation. The binding of BMP-2 or BMP4 to bone morphogenetic
  protein receptors (BMPR-I and BMPR-II) leads to the phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5,
  or Smad8. Subsequently, these phosphorylated Smads form a complex with Smad4 and
  translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression, facilitating the
  transition of Runx2+OSX+ cells into mature osteoblasts. (e) Fibroblast growth factor
  (FGF) signaling pathway regulates the proliferation of preosteoblasts, osteoblast
  differentiation, and the function of mature osteoblasts. FGF binds to cell surface
  tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4), triggering the activation of a cascade
  of signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, STAT1, and protein kinase C (PKC).
