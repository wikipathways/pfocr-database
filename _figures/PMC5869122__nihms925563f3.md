caption: The functional role of lncRNAs in regulating cancer signaling can be classified
  as following. Merge – The lncRNA conjoins the kinases of neighboring pathways, allowing
  the pathways to work in parallel to mediate a common cellular effect. Thus, the
  ligand of either receptor is able to activate the effector, accelerating the consequent
  cellular response. Switch – The lncRNA couples one receptor to multiple kinases,
  creating a junction in the pathway. When the appropriate ligand binds to the receptor,
  the linked kinases are each able to activate their respective effectors in response
  to that one signal protein. Reroute – In response to the cellular environment and
  specific ligand, the lncRNA will form a bridge between the kinase and one of many
  possible effectors. In this scenario, one receptor and its associated kinase are
  able to achieve an array of cellular effects in accordance to the cellular context.
  Yield – In the situation of antagonistic pathways, the lncRNA is able to mediate
  interaction between two kinases so that only one pathway is activated at a given
  time. Effectively, activation of a pathway is blocked when the other is already
  activated. Shortcut – In the presence of the lncRNA, the conventional kinase cascade
  is bypassed in favor of a shortcut that enables a more direct route to activating
  the downstream effector. Consequently, the lncRNA allows for more rapid induction
  of the desired cellular response. Detour – In instances where the conventional pathway
  is disrupted or blocked, lncRNAs can facilitate the formation of an alternative
  pathway by way of recruiting substitute pathway components or mediators. In response
  to poisons or inhibitors, a cellular effect may still be achieved by the more circuitous
  route enabled by the lncRNA.
