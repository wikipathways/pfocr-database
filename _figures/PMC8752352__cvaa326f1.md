caption: Schematic diagram illustrating an overview of the hypothesized pathway by
  which western diet/INS resistance together with enhanced ALDO and INS-mediated signalling
  promotes abnormally increased vascular stiffness (left panel). Both INS receptor
  (IR) and MR activation are proposed to mediate stiffening through mTOR and SGK-1-dependent
  mechanisms that lead to both increased Na+ channel (EnNaC) expression and activity.
  As described in the text, EnNaC activity is increased through decreased ubiquination
  and internalization. The right-hand panel contrasts at the EC level the ‘normal’
  EC cortical flexibility (upper) to the situation where the cell cortex is ‘stiffened’
  leading to impaired eNOS activity and decreased NO bioavailability (lower panel).
  Specifically, enhanced Na+ entry occurs as a result of enhanced EnNaC activity.
  Increased Na+ influx promotes polymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton
  leading to decreased eNOS activation and diminished production of NO. As further
  described in the text decreased NO bioavailability leads to increased vascular fibrosis
  and stiffening.
