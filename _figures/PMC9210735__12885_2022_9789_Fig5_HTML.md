caption: A schema of the function and role of LSR in endometrial cancer. LSR is highly
  expressed in endometrial cancer cells and regulates cell proliferation, invasion,
  and migration through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and subsequent MT1-MMP and MMP2.
  By these mechanisms, LSR contributes to a poor prognosis of patients with endometrial
  cancer. The newly developed anti-LSR monoclonal antibody which exerted a significant
  antitumor effect in the xenograft mouse model has the potential to be a novel therapeutic
  agent for endometrial cancer
