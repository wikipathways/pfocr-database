caption: 'Putative mechanism of action of terfenadine: induction of autophagy. Terfenadine
  is thought to induce autophagy by inhibiting cell membrane potassium channels, causing
  an intracellular potassium buildup and ionic stress. This stress, along with other
  cellular signals, inhibits the mTOR pathway, which typically suppresses autophagy.
  In response, the ULK1 complex is activated, initiating phagophore formation, the
  initial step in autophagosome creation. During this process, autophagic proteins
  like LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) and Atg12 are added to
  the phagophore membrane. Completed phagophores merge with lysosomes, forming autophagolysosomes
  where cellular contents are degraded and recycled, ultimately inducing autophagy.
  This represents a putative mechanism by which terfenadine triggers autophagy by
  affecting potassium channels and initiating a series of intracellular events.'
