caption: Structure, conserved motifs, and anti-interferon activities of programmed
  death-1 ligand 1. Schematic representation of the molecular organization of PD-L1
  (right) in the cell membrane, with the main conserved sequence motifs indicated
  in the figure. The reverse signaling pathway counteracting IFN-driven apoptosis
  is also depicted. On the (left), IFNs signal through JAK1/2 leading to STAT3 phosphorylation
  and CASP7-dependent apoptosis. Blue lines show inhibitory relationships between
  the indicated sequence motifs and molecules. Red arrows show activating relationships
  between the indicated proteins. Ig V and Ig C indicate the immunoglobulin-like variable
  and conserved sequence motifs. IFNAR, interferon receptor
