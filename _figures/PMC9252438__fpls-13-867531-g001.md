caption: Proline is synthesized from glutamate in cytosol by P5CS1/P5CS2 enzymes and
  these reactions take place in cytosol (indicated in yellow shade). Oxidation of
  proline takes place by ProDH and P5CDH enzymes in mitochondria (indicated in green
  shade). While proline synthesis consumes NAD(P)H and ATP in cytosol, its degradation
  releases FADH2 and NADH in mitochondria. It is not clearly known what transports
  arginine and ornithine from cytoplasm into mitochondria. But, it is predicted that
  arginine and ornithine, the two polyamines are transported into mitochondria from
  cytosol and back by basic amino acid carriers (BAC2). While arginine gets converted
  to ornithine, ornithine is catalyzed by ornithine δ-amino transferase (OAT) to pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C), an overriding intermediate in proline cycle. Note that the release of NAD(P)H
  is connected to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP pathway) in mitochondria. Conversion
  of P5C to proline and proline to P5C changes the NADP+/NADPH ratio in the cells.
  This leads to the modulation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthesis besides
  nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP pathway.
