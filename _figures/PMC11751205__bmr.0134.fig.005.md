caption: Overview of autophagy pathways in normal and burned tissues. (A) Mitochondrial
  autophagy is a significant mechanism by which cells regulate mitochondrial quality,
  including selective removal of damaged mitochondria through autophagy. The PTEN-induced
  kinase (PINK1)–Parkin pathway is the most extensively studied pathway for mitophagy.
  (B) Burns can not only trigger Parkin-dependent autophagy but also induce Parkin-independent
  autophagy. Activated Parkin interacts with Pink1 to initiate mitophagy. Moreover,
  Parkin-independent mitophagy can be induced by HIF-1α and BNIP3. Adapted from [165]
