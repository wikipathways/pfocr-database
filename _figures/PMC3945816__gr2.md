caption: Expression and function of K+ channels in sensory neurons. (A) Subcellular
  localization of K+ channel subunits in unmyelinated (top) and myelinated (bottom)
  murine dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The panoply of K+ channels endows sensory
  neurons with a sophisticated machinery for the regulation of neuronal excitability.
  The depiction illustrated here is not absolute but rather reflects most prominent
  expression patterns in pain-relevant subpopulations, as reported in the literature.
  In addition, it is noted that K+ channel distribution patterns can vary tremendously
  between species, and validation against human data is currently very limited . In
  the pain pathway, the TWIK-related (TR) channels TREK1 and TRAAK (and possibly TRESK)
  located at C-fiber terminals can counteract the activation of inward-conducting
  ion channels by pressure, heat or cold, whereas steady Kv7 currents also stabilize
  RMP and regulate action potential (AP) threshold. In myelinated neurons, low-threshold
  Kv1.1/Kv1.2 heterotetramers appear to modulate acute and neuropathic pain modalities
  , whereas Kv1.4 and Kv4 members may exert similar roles in small nociceptors . In
  addition, recent evidence suggest that Kv1.1/Kv1.2 may also function as mechanoreceptors
  in some C-fibers (not shown) . Transmission of signals generated at the periphery
  is reliant on numerous axonal K+ channels, which influence the fidelity of AP conduction
  and therefore the fiber following frequency. Although normal sensory transduction
  is independent of spiking in the DRG soma, this can become a site of spontaneous
  firing in neuropathic conditions. In these scenarios, the activity of somal K+ channels
  may become an important regulator of excitability by influencing somal AP generation
  as well as propagation past the DRG T-junction. Potential candidates here are channels
  that preferentially localize at the soma or axon initial segments (in grey), such
  as Kv4.3 in mechanosensitive C-fibers  or Kv2/Kv9.1 in A-fibers . At the central
  terminals, Ca2+-activated channels BKCA fine-tune activity and regulate neurotransmitter
  release in the spinal cord in response to calcium influx during AP firing. The high-threshold
  Kv3.4 limits AP duration and thus may play a key role in synaptic transmission,
  whereas Kv1.2 may also regulate presynaptic terminal excitability . Finally, pain
  processing can be influenced by K+ channels expressed by glial satellite cells (GSC)
  in the dorsal horn. Astrocyte-expressed Kir6.1 (and perhaps Kir3.1 ) buffers the
  extracellular K+ to maintain equilibrium potential during neuronal firing , and
  BKCA conduction is involved in microgliosis following injury . In addition, satellite
  cell-expressed Kir4.1 is involved in facial pain processing in the trigeminal ganglion
  (not shown). Subunits denoted in italics represent localizations that are indirectly
  implied by pharmacological profiling in DRG neurons, or by extrapolating on known
  localization in other neuronal types. For example, the Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 subunits
  are typically detected in dendrites and terminals of CNS neurons , whereas TREK1
  and TRAAK are axonally trafficked in sciatic nerves and are present at synaptic
  sites in cerebellar cultures . (B) K+ channel composition of a myelinated DRG axon,
  illustrating nodes, paranodes, juxtaparanodes (JPN), internode segments, and a myelinating
  Schwann cell. The Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits (together with a splice variant of Kv3.1)
  are found in the nodes, and may therefore more prominently affect saltatory conduction
  under physiological conditions. Following axonal injury and demyelination, however,
  other channels such as the juxtaparanodal Kv1 subunits may become exposed, leading
  to reduced conduction velocity and negative symptoms including sensory loss. In
  other cases, reduced axonal K+ channel function due to disrupted node organization
  (e.g., autoantibodies against Kv complex proteins) may induce peripheral hyperexcitability.
  Schwann cells also express inward rectifiers that regulate the node microenvironment
  during neuronal activity.
