caption: 'The PI3K-mTOR pathway and possible mechanism of HSC depletion and leukemia
  initiation. mTOR kinase nucleates two complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC2 is upstream
  of mTORC1 and activates AKT, which in turn induces downstream mTORC1 signaling.
  Deletion of PTEN leads to hyperactivation of AKT and inactivation of the TSC1/2
  complex to activate mTORC1. Chronic mTORC1 signaling leads to the induction of tumor
  suppressor genes, such as p16INK4a, p19ARF, and p53, in stem cells. Treatment with
  rapamycin rescues this response in stem cells, restoring normal function. Although
  PTEN is required for the maintenance of HSCs, its loss gives rise to leukemia-initiating
  cells (or cells capable of transferring acute leukemia to recipient mice). Secondary
  mutations that inactivate the tumor repressive response in PTEN-deleted HSCs are
  likely required for leukemogenesis. Deletion of Rictor or Raptor, essential components
  of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, or administration of rapamycin delay the decline
  in HSCs and the generation of leukemia with PTEN deficiency.'
