caption: E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent and E3 ligase-independent roles of Rad18 in
  tolerance of bulky DNA lesions (left) and replication-associated DSB (right). In
  response to bulky lesions such as UV-induced CPD, Rad18 associates with and chaperones
  polη to sites of replication stalling in an E3 ligase-independent manner. At the
  stalled replication fork Rad18 monoubiquitinates PCNA facilitating stable engagement
  of TLS polymerases with the DNA replication machinery, enabling lesion bypass and
  DNA damage tolerance. In response to replication-induced DSB, Rad18 associates with
  Rad51C and facilitates HR in an E3 ligase-independent manner, as demonstrated by
  Huang et al. Additionally, DSB-induced FA pathway activation and DNA damage tolerance
  requires Rad18 E3 ligase activity (this study).
