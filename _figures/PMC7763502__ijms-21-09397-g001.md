caption: Effect of Brassicaceae bioactives compounds upon the transcription of genes
  related with inflammation. (A) In physiological conditions, Keap1 promotes the degradation
  of Nrf2 by the proteasome. However, when sulforaphane (SFN) interacts with Keap1
  by binding its cysteine residues, Nef2 is released and translocated to the nucleus.
  In this way, Nrf2 up regulates the transcription of genes related with antioxidant
  activities and anti-inflammatory pathways. (B) In an inflammatory process, Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) undergoes dimerization after recognizing pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), activating the NFκB pathway and up-regulating genes related with
  inflammation. When SFN and iberin interact with TLR4, it cannot oligomerizate, and
  the inflammatory response is inhibited.
