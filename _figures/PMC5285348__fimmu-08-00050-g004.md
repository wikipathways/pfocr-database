caption: The non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Two β-catenin independent Wnt signaling
  pathways have been reported. The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is triggered
  by Wnt5 and Wnt11. Wnt5/11 binds Frizzled leading to the activation of a trimeric
  G protein that induces the activation of disheveled and DAAM. Together these proteins
  trigger the activation of the small GTPases RHOA and RAC-1 that leads to the activation
  of the kinases JUN kinase (JNK) and ROCK. These signaling pathways are involved
  in cell adhesion, migration, and cell cytoskeleton organization. The stress response
  pathway involves the activation of JNK, which phosphorylates the transcriptional
  factors AP-1 and JUN leading to their translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene
  expression (left). The Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathway is triggered by Wnt5–FZD-2. The
  activation of this pathway is mediated through G proteins, which induces the phospholipase
  C activation, leading to the hydrolysis of PIP2 into DAG and IP3. The IP3 induces
  the release of intracellular Ca++, activation of calcineurin, and CAMKII. The active
  calcineurin induces the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation. Intracellular
  calcium as well as DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) increasing the activity
  of calcineurin triggering the translocation of the transcriptional factor NFAT to
  the nucleus. Similarly, PKC induces the activation and translocation of NFκB to
  the nucleus (right).
