caption: ROS function as signaling mediators in pexophagy. ROS induce pexophagy through
  the mTORC1 signaling pathway under oxidative stress conditions due to calcium deficiency
  and amino acid starvation. ROS activate ATM, which phosphorylates and ubiquitinates
  PEX5, leading to its degradation via pexophagy. ATM suppresses mTORC1 activity via
  the TSC complex. Simultaneously, ROS suppress mTORC1 activity, inducing the dephosphorylation
  of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), thereby promoting its nuclear translocation
  and transcriptional activation of autophagy-related genes, leading to pexophagy.
  Additionally, mTORC1 inhibition influences the ubiquitination of peroxisomal proteins,
  such as PMP70 and PEX5, which is mediated by PEX2, further promoting pexophagy
