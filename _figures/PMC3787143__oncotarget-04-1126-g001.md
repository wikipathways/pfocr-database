caption: 'Activation of PR signaling by natural progesterone or progestins leads to
  increase in RANKL protein levels in PR positive luminal breast epithelial cells
  (central cell in light blue) mainly through stabilization of mRNA. RANKL protein
  binds to RANK receptor (depicted on the adjacent green cell to the right) and activates
  this pathway leading to cell proliferation. SPRMs and drugs that target RANKL pathway
  such as denosumab may hence inhibit breast cell proliferation. (PR: Progesterone
  Receptor, SPRM: Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators, CD10: Cluster of Differentiation
  10, EpCam: Epithelial Cell adhesion molecule, RANK: Receptor activator of nuclear
  factor kappaB, RANKL: Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand).'
