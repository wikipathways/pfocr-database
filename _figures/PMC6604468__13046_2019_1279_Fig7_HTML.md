caption: Schematic of MUC17 inhibits the progression of human gastric cancer by limiting
  inflammatory responses. Inflammatory factors induce the expression of MUC17 through
  upregulating CDX1. MUC17 is dependent on its conserved epidermal growth factor domain
  and on downstream sequences to enable its interaction with myosin-9, resulting in
  a sustained regulatory feedback loop between myosin-9, p53, and RhoA, and then activation
  of p38 to negatively regulate the NFκB pathway in GC cells. Inflammatory factor
  promotes cancer cell growth through activating NFκB pathway, hence, MUC17 can limiting
  inflammatory responses
