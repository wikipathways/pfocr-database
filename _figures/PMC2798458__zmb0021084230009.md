caption: Schematic model of SAPK-induced Foxo3a nuclear export in muscle cells. Foxo3a
  transcription factor is a direct substrate of the Akt protein kinase. In the absence
  of growth factors or nutrients, PI3K/Akt pathway activation decreases and Foxo3a
  localizes within the nucleus, where it stimulates Atrogin-1 expression, thereby
  inducing muscle atrophy. When cells are exposed to growth factors/nutrients, the
  PI3K/Akt cascade is activated and triggers the export of Foxo3a to the cytoplasm.
  When the PI3K/Akt pathway is inhibited, stimulation of SAPKs induces Foxo3a nuclear
  export via the CRM1 nuclear export protein and partly prevents muscle atrophy by
  decreasing Atrogin-1 promoter (Atrogin-1 prom) activity. Alternatively, activated
  IKK can directly phosphorylate Foxo3a and promote Akt-independent Foxo3a nuclear
  export. Data for dominant-negative forms of Akt (DN mutants), the constitutively
  active forms of MKK3 and MKK4 (CA MKK3 and CA MKK4), LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K),
  SC-514 (inhibitor of IKK), SB203580 (inhibitor of p38), SP600125 (inhibitor of JNK),
  leptomycin B (inhibitor of CRM1 nuclear export protein), and Hanks balanced salt
  solution (HBSS) (nutrient deprivation condition) are shown.
