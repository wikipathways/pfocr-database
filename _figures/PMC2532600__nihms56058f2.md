caption: (A) When Wnt signaling is “turned off”, cytoplasmic β-catenin is degraded
  by the Axin complex consisting of APC, GSK3 and CKIα. Within this complex, CKIα
  and GSK3 phosphorylate β-catenin, phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by β-Trcp
  and degraded via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Wnt protein can be inhibited
  by sFRPs, and LRP5/6 can be inhibited by DKK1. (B) When Wnt signaling is “turned
  on”, Wnt protein binds its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6 and stimulates
  LRP5/6 phosphorylation with the help of Dishevelled. Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits
  Axin to the membrane and disrupts the Axin complex. β-catenin accumulates in the
  cytoplasm and enters nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF and co-activators, such as
  pygopus, legless and CBP/p300, and activates gene expression.
