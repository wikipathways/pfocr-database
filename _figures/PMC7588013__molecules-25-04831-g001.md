caption: Overview of cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. Cancer cells require extensive
  metabolic reprogramming to fuel anabolic growth via increased nucleotide biosynthesis,
  protein synthesis, and FA synthesis. There is elevated glycolysis even under aerobic
  conditions (Warburg effect), which allows for the production of intermediates to
  be channelled into the PPP for nucleotide biosynthesis. However, a majority of tumours
  still retain oxidative capacity to produce ATP via OXPHOS. Glutaminolysis is also
  upregulated in many tumours for the production of α-KG to fuel the TCA cycle. Increased
  glutaminolysis also produces glutathione (GSH) to defend against oxidative stress.
  Central to these metabolic changes is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Downstream effectors
  that are activated by mTORC signalling include the transcription factors HIF-1 and
  SREBP.
