caption: Molecular pathways involved in the increase of fibrosis in the ovary and
  uterus by exposure to micro/nano plastics. The occurrence of fibrosis in the ovary
  and uterus can be caused by the accumulation of MNPs in these tissues. By increasing
  the expression of HMGB1, MNPs cause the activation of NOX2 after activating the
  TLR4 receptor, which ultimately increases the expression of Notch ligands by increasing
  the level of ROS and ultimately leads to the activation of the Notch signaling pathway.
  Through cross-talk with the TGF-β signaling pathway and the effective transfer of
  p-SMAD2/3 to the nucleus, this pathway activates the expression of collagen, α-SMA,
  MMP2/9, and Hes family, increasing the collagen fibers in the ECM. Also, the activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a result of exposure to MNPs, with the
  effective transfer of β-catenin to the nucleus, increases the expression of TGF-β,
  followed by the increase of collagen in the ECM of the cell which eventually causes
  fibrosis in the uterus and ovaries
