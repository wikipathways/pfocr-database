caption: Homogenous MPC populations can be induced to differentiate to early MSCs
  by activating the Wnt5/Calmodulin pathway via Fzd1. Terminal differentiation to
  late MSCs is related to down-regulation of either Wnt5/Calmodulin pathway or Dkk1-mediated
  inhibition of canonical signalling. Plastic adherence in different culture conditions
  and timing could lead to the isolation of the three different populations easily
  distinguishable by morphology, phenotype and proliferation rate.
