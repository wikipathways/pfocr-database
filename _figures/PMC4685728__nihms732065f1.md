caption: 'Schematic representation of maturation of the alveolar acinus.Notes: During
  early embryonic lung development (upper panel) endodermal shh [2] signals to the
  mesodermal Wnt/Ptc/gli pathway [3–7]. maturation of the interstitium is driven by
  alveolar fluid distension [1], which upregulates the PthrP signaling pathway between
  the endoderm and mesoderm [8–16], down-regulating the Wnt pathway by inhibiting
  gli [12] and upregulating PPaRy [13] and aDRP [14]. Differentiation of the lipofibroblast
  stimulates differentiation of alveolar type ii cell surfactant synthesis [15] and
  inhibition of shh [16] expression.'
