caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the antiviral type 1 IFN molecules'' production by the
  infected cells and the intracellular antioxidant NRF2 pathway. GA causes a shift
  from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory response. DMF blocks pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production and can inhibit macrophage function. Teriflunomide may affect
  the replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside the infected cell. Fingolimod enhancing lung
  endothelial cell integrity. Natalizumab as an antibody against α4- integrin might
  be protective toward the infection. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies moderately reduced
  immune response by peripheral B cell reduction, which might play a favorable role
  in COVID-19. Designed with https://biorender.com/ .ARDS: Acute respiratory distress
  syndrome , GA: Glatiramer acetate, DMF: Dimethyl fumarate, IFN: Interferon beta.
