caption: Diagram highlighting the role of DMI3 in a hypothetical gene expression pathway
  during PPA assembly in response to contact by the AM fungus. The SYM pathway, activated
  after perception of a putative diffusible fungal factor (FF), weakly up-regulates
  Exp-like, Nod-like, ACRE264, and RK20-1 upstream of DMI3. DMI3 is required for up-regulation
  of Exp-like and Nod-like but represses the ACRE264 gene. These two functions—absent
  in dmi3-1 mutant—are most likely required for PPA development and establishment
  of a compatible AM fungus-plant interaction.
