caption: Key pathways of COVID-19 vaccine-induced adverse immune reactions. The COVID-19
  vaccine is comprised of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (either as mRNA or protein) combined
  with an adjuvant such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the classical pathway, internalization
  of the viral and adjuvant-derived antigens (Ag) in the vaccine by antigen-presenting
  cells (APC) results in the presentation of antigenic epitopes to the T helper (Th)
  cells, which produces cytokines and activates Ag-specific B cells to produce various
  antibodies, such as IgG, IgE, IgM, etc. The Ag-specific IgE Abs binds to the FcεR1
  and activates basophils and mast cells to produce histamine, which leads to allergy
  and/or anaphylaxis reactions. In the non-classical pathway, the antigens were taken
  up directly by the MRGPRX2 receptor on mast cells, which results in the induction
  of histamine and allergic responses. In addition, the immune complex formation by
  the Ag-specific and/or anti-idiotypic IgG, IgE, IgM Abs activates the C3a and C5a
  complement components, which ultimately results in complement activation-related
  pseudo-allergic reaction (CARPA). Finally, in the alternative/additional pathway,
  the antigen–IgG complex is taken up by neutrophils through FcγRs, which activates
  these polymorphonuclear cells to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteases
  such as neutrophil-elastases (NE), Protease-3 (PR3), cathepsin G (CatG), and the
  formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis). The combined action of these
  pathways may contribute to the overall allergy and anaphylactic response due to
  COVID-19 vaccination. Image created in Biorender

    The COVID-19 vaccine is comprised of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (either as mRNA
