caption: '(A) Presumed benzoate-catabolic pathway via ortho cleavage in P. fluorescens
  Pf0-1. Benzoate is mineralized to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates via catechol
  and β-ketoadipate (indicated by solid arrows). The names of the enzyme are as follows:
  BenABC, benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase; BenD, cis-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate
  dehydrogenase; CatA, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; CatB, cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing
  enzyme; CatC, muconolactone isomerase; PcaD, β-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase;
  PcaIJ, β-ketoadipate succinyl-CoA transferase; and PcaF, β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase.
  (B) Organization of the ben-cat gene clusters in the P. fluorescens Pf0-1 chromosome.
  The ORF numbers are indicated below; the ORFs (Pfl_2320 to Pfl_2327 and Pfl_2961
  to Pfl_2969) were named according to our homology search results. The cat gene cluster
  is compared to those from the P. putida KT2440 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosomes.
  Black, gray, and white pentagons indicate regulatory genes, catabolic genes, and
  other unrelated ORFs, respectively. Homologous regions are indicated by dotted lines.'
