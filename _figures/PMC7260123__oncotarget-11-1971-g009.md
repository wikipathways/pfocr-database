caption: Activation of IGF-1R and insulin receptor, mediated by ligand binding of
  IGF-1 or insulin leads to the subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathways and
  the Ras/MAPK pathways. Increased expression of BCATc increased levels of IGF-1Rβ,
  Shc and SOS however MAPK activation was increased with knockdown of BCAT1 suggesting
  BCATc inhibits MAPK activation. Increased levels of hBCATc increased phosphorylation
  of Akt and the expression levels of the downstream effector proteins; FOXO3a, and
  Nrf2 thereby promoting cell proliferation, migration, and evasion of apoptosis in
  TNBC.
