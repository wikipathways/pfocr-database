caption: The feedback regulation between IRS-1 phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K/Akt
  insulin signaling pathway in AD. Insulin binds to insulin receptor which stimulates
  autophosphorylation of itself and subsequently activates tyrosine residues of IRS-1
  triggering cascade events. IRS-1 recruits and activates PI3K complex, which then
  phosphorylates and activates Akt. Activated Akt ultimately leads to the translocation
  of GLUT4 to the cell membrane for uptake of glucose into neurons. Akt-mediated activation
  of mTOR and the downstream targets of mTOR, like S6K and 4EBP1, serve to regulate
  protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and autophagy, among other processes. Phosphorylation
  of GSK3 by Akt inhibits the constitutive activity of this kinase. Activated Akt
  also can directly phosphorylate JNK/IKK. IR results in increased pSer-IRS-1 phosphorylation
  which further enhance PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and its downstream molecules dysfunction,
  leading to pathological process of AD involving hyperphosphorylated tau protein,
  Aβ plaques, autophagy dysfunction, glucose metabolism dysfunction, neuroinflammation,
  and oxidative stress. Dark green solid arrows represent activation upon insulin
  stimulation and blocked arrow shows inhibition. Red dotted arrows represent downstream
  molecules that can phosphorylate Ser residues in IRS-1 leading to inactivation of
  IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by feedback inhibition loop (Arnold et al. ; Stanley
  et al. ). PI3K phosphoinositide 3 kinase, GLUT4 Glucose transporter 4, mTOR mammalian
