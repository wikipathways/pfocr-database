caption: a | The neural pathways mediating morphine-induced itch and analgesia. The
  rectangles represent the itch-specific and pain-specific neural pathways. The coloured
  circles represent μ-opioid receptor 1 (MOR1)-expressing neurons (MOR1 neurons; red)
  and neurons expressing the MOR1 isoform MOR1D and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)
  receptor (GRPR) (blue). According to the traditional view, there are more nociceptors
  (expressing MOR1) than pruriceptors (expressing MOR1D and GRPR) in the spinal cord.
  Therefore, pain transmission masks or occludes itch,, and morphine inhibits pain
  by activating MOR1, thereby unmasking itch transmission. The contemporary view,
  however, states that two non-overlapping populations of excitatory interneurons
  in the spinal cord mediate morphine-induced itch and analgesia, respectively. MOR1
  neurons convey nociceptive information, whereas MOR1D and GRPR neurons transmit
  itch. Morphine simultaneously activates MOR1 neurons to induce analgesia and MOR1D/GRPR
  neurons to induce itch. b | Diverse GRPR signalling pathways. GRPR can be activated
  directly by GRP released from primary afferents to open the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) Ca2+ store and induce itch signalling,,,. In addition, it can be indirectly
  activated by opioids through a unidirectional MOR1D–GRPR cross-signalling in a GRP-independent
  manner. GRPR can also be inhibited directly by neuropeptide Y (NPY) or by NPY receptor
  type 1 (NPY1R) agonists, and indirectly by κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists through
  KOR-activated protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ)-mediated phosphorylation (P) of GRPR. Lastly,
  GRPR is subject to descending modulation via 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor
  1A (5-HT1A)-GRPR crosstalk upon concurrent activation by their respective agonists,
  GRP and 5-HT. 5-HT1A-GRPR crosstalk converts the inhibitory 5-HT1A-mediated cAMP
  pathway into an excitatory pathway, thereby facilitating GRPR signalling. These
  GPCR cross-signalling events may occur in distinct microdomains within the same
  GRPR neurons or in different subpopulations of GRPR neurons. Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol
