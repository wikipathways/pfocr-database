caption: PCSK9 activated the EGFR/HER3 signaling pathway in TNBC cells. A) Western
  blotting depicting the phosphorylated or total protein levels of PCSK9, EGFR, HER3,
  Src, ERK, c‐Jun, cyclin D3, and vimentin in 231‐GFP and 4–11 cells, 4–11 cells of
  shNC or shPCSK9, and 231‐GFP and 468‐Clover cells with EV or O‐PCSK9. B) Western
  blotting results of p‐Src, Src, p‐ERK, ERK, p‐c‐Jun, c‐Jun, cyclin D3, vimentin,
  PCSK9 and LDLR in 4–11 cells after treatment with 50 nM dasatinib (Src inhibitor)
  for 48 h. C) Western blotting results of p‐ERK, ERK, p‐c‐Jun, c‐Jun, cyclin D3,
  vimentin, PCSK9 and LDLR in 4–11 cells after treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib
  (10 nM) for 48 h. D) Western blotting results of p‐c‐Jun, c‐Jun, cyclin D3, vimentin,
  PCSK9 and LDLR in 4–11 cells after treatment with the c‐Jun inhibitors SR11302 (5
  µM) and T‐5224 (20 µM) for 48 h. E) Western blotting results of p‐EGFR, EGFR, p‐HER3,
  HER3, p‐Src, Src, ERK, p‐ERK, p‐c‐Jun, and c‐Jun in 4–11 cells after treatment with
  10 µM erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor) for 48 h. F) Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis
  of EGFR with the HER3 antibody
