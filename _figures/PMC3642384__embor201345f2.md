caption: Hypothetical evolutionary and functional relationship between β-catenin and
  nuclear transport receptors. Importins and exportins on one side and β-catenin and
  other Arm proteins on the other side might have evolved from a common transporter
  prototype, which could shuttle DNA-binding proteins, delivering them to chromatin
  and/or retrieving them back to the cytoplasm. Such an ancient importin probably
  had a groove enriched with acidic residues (red) selective for DNA-binding proteins.
  An important evolution of HEAT-repeat-containing importins and exportins might have
  been the acquisition of Ran binding, which regulates cargo assembly and release
  on either side of the nuclear pore and thus mediates efficient unidirectional transport.
  Along the branch of the Arm proteins, importin-α might have lost its ability to
  translocate on its own and become dependent on importin-β1 and CAS for nuclear import
  and export, respectively. The importin-α/-β1 pair became the main pathway for import
  of cargos carrying a classical NLS sequence composed of one or two small clusters
  of basic residues. β-catenin (and other related Arm proteins) might have been specialized
  carriers for a subset of cargos, and in addition, might have acquired the ability
  to interact with adhesion molecules, thus establishing a primitive signalling pathway
  between the cell surface and the nucleus. Note that a physiological role of β-catenin
  in nuclear transport has not yet been demonstrated and putative cargos have not
  yet been identified (question mark). This putative basal mechanism, based on competition
  between cargos and membrane anchors, might have been refined by eliminating excess
  free β-catenin through the Axin-based degradation complex. β-catenin might also
  have acquired transcriptional co-activation properties by bridging its DNA-binding
  partners (such as TCF) with transcription factors (TFs). The cadherin–β-catenin
  signalling pathway might have been high-jacked by Wnts and their receptors LRP5/6
  and Frizzled (Fz)—by inhibiting the degradation complex, this pathway builds a large
  pool of cytosolic β-catenin and thus might bypass the basal control by cell adhesion.
  Note that several proteins harbouring HEAT or Arm repeats might have lost the property
  to cross the nuclear pore and have evolved different functions. These side branches
  of the two families are omitted in the diagram. CAS, cellular apoptosis susceptibility
  protein homologue; HEAT, Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A,
  TOR1; LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; NLS, nuclear
  localization signal; TCF, T-cell factor; Wnt, combination of Wingless and mammalian
  proto-oncogene int1
