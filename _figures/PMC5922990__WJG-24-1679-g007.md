caption: Naringenin in cancer development. Hepatocellular carcinoma is strongly associated
  with elevated levels of free radicals such as lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH•), peroxyl
  radicals (ROO•), and hydroxyl radicals (OH•), leading to the development of lipid
  peroxidation (LP), oxidative stress and finally to an imbalance of the endogenous
  antioxidant system. Naringenin (N) inhibits oxidative stress by its intrinsic antioxidant
  properties and by improving the endogenous antioxidant system. Notably, oxidative
  stress has been linked to the hepatocarcinogenic process because it is implicated
  in the activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB), or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathways, increasing the
  production and activity of metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), which is involved in migration
  and invasion processes. When toll-like receptors (TLRs) are activated, TRAMP is
  recruited to activate TRIF; in turn, it promotes transforming growth factor beta-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) activation, which phosphorylates IκB kinase (IKK). Then, IKK promotes
  NF-κB release via inhibitor κB (IKB) phosphorylation. On the other hand, phospholipase
  C (PLC) catalyzes phospholipid hydrolysis, generating inositol triphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG); the latter is an activator of protein kinase C (PKC),
  which can induce the NF-κB pathway in a TRAMP-dependent manner. Then, NF-κB induces
  the expression of MMP9. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is highly involved in carcinogenic
  pathways; it binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promoting Grb2, SOS,
  Ras, Raf and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) activation, which participates
  in extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and p38 (MAPK) phosphorylation and activation. Then, MAPKs promote activator
  protein 1 (AP-1) activation by c-Jun and Fos dimerization. After that, AP-1 induces
  the expression of MMP9. Alternatively, MAPKs are activated via PI3K/AKT. PI3K produces
  phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2); PIP3 activates AKT, which promotes MAPK activation in a Ras-dependent pathway.
  It has been reported that naringenin inhibits MM9 expression and secretion through
  diminution of p38, JNK, ERK, IKB, and PI3K/AKT phosphorylation as well as NF-κB
  and AP-1-DNA binding. In addition, naringenin inhibits PKC cytoplasm-to-membrane
  translocation. Notably, naringenin induces p53 accumulation, leading to p21 expression.
  Then, p21 inhibits cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex, which participates
  in proliferation. p53 accumulation results in naringenin-induced G0/G1 phase arrests.
  An important mechanism for the elimination of cancer cells is apoptosis. Naringenin
  induces apoptosis by increased cytochrome c (CYPc) release, as well as BCL2-associated
  X protein (Bax), BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak) and Caspase 3 (Cas3) elevation.
  Additionally, naringenin inhibited B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) an antiapoptotic
  protein. Two-pore channels (TPCs) are members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily
  localized in acidic calcium (Ca2+) stores and have been implicated in angiogenic
  processes. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor (VEGFR) promotes TPC activation via nicotinic acid adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP); then, Ca2+ is transported to the cytoplasm through
  TPCs, activating angiogenic signals. Naringenin inhibits VEGF angiogenesis induction
  blocking NAADP activation and NAADP/TPC association.
