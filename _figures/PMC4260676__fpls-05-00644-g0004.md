caption: 'A view of superpathway of flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis leading to
  anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation showing expression profile of genes associated
  with individual reactions. The genes expression data depicts change in the expression
  of individual genes in the pulp tissue of grape berry during four ripening transitions.
  GS-PV: fold change in gene expression in green soft stage compared to prevéraison
  stage. PS-GS: fold change in gene expression in pink soft stage compared to green
  soft stage. RS-PS: fold change in gene expression in red soft, ripe stage compared
  to pink soft stage. The fold change in the gene expression values are depicted by
  red (>20), yellow (15–20), dark blue (10–15), light blue (5–10) and green (2–5)
  colors. By clicking on “More Detail” icon users can see functional annotations of
  the genes and chemical structure of the compounds.'
