caption: 'Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2) are both
  controlled by growth factors, whereas mTORC1 is also regulated by cellular energy
  status, oxygen, stress, and amino acids (AAs). A) mTOR is controlled by growth factors
  through the classical phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (also known
  as AKT), PI3K-AKT, pathway and through the Ras signaling cascade. PI3K is activated
  and recruited to the membrane by insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), where it catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). AKT is recruited
  via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to PIP3, and is phosphorylated and
  activated by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). mTORC2 is thought to
  be activated downstream of PI3K, possibly by ribosome binding, although many unanswered
  questions still remain. Dashed arrow represents missing components possibly involved
  that have not been identified. Full activation of AKT requires the phosphorylation
  of T308 (by PDK1) and S473 (by mTORC2). Although, the requirement of AKT phosphorylation
  at T308 or S473 depends on its substrate. AKT kinase activation can promote mTORC1
  signaling in two ways: by phosphorylating and inhibiting tuberous sclerosis complex
  2 (TSC2) GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity, thus activating Rheb, and by
  phosphorylating proline-rich AKT/PKB substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), which increases
  PRAS40-14-3-3 binding and relieves PRAS40 inhibition on mTORC1. In addition to AKT,
  the Ras pathway regulates mTORC1 through ERK and RSK1, which phosphorylate and inhibit
  TSC1/2. TBC1D7, a third subunit of TSC, promotes TSC1-TSC2 interaction and Rheb-GAP
  activity. RTK, denotes receptor tyrosine kinase. B) IKKβ can also inhibit TSC1/TSC2
  in response to inflammation. C) GSK3-β, which is regulated by Wnt signaling, phosphorylates
  TSC2 and increases its GAP activity in an AMP-activated dependent kinase (AMPK)-priming
  phosphorylating manner. D) Hypoxia promotes expression of the regulated in development
  and DNA damage responses 1 (REDD1), which activates TSC1/TSC2, and hypoxia activates
  AMPK due to the failure to generate sufficient ATP. E) When cellular energy is low
  AMPK is activated and regulates mTORC1 by phosphorylating and activating TSC2. Also,
  AMPK can phosphorylate Raptor and inhibit mTORC1 function. F) DNA damage results
  in the inhibition of mTORC1 activity through the p53-dependent up-regulation of
  REDD1 and AMPK. G) AA signaling activates mTORC1 (see ). Pink circles represent
  AAs.'
