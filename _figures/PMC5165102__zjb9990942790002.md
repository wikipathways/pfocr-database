  succinate. Candidate genes for enzymes performing the catalytic steps are shown
  in colored boxes according to their INSeq mutant classification: red, growth essential
  (ES) under all growth conditions; orange, growth defective (GD) under all growth
  conditions; green, growth neutral (NE) under all growth conditions; gray, growth
  impaired on glucose, i.e., growth essential or growth defective specifically on
  glucose; blue, growth impaired on succinate, i.e., growth essential or growth defective
  specifically on succinate; purple, growth essential (ES) on glucose and growth defective
  on succinate.'
