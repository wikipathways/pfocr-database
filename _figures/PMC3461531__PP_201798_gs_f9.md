caption: Model showing the possible signaling pathway for -induced plant innate immunity.
  The extracellular  are recognized by a receptor in the plant cell plasma membrane.  perceived
  by receptors result in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (; ), which may activate -like
  enzyme and then lead to an increase of  level. NO functions to potentiate cyclic
  GMP/Ca2+-dependent PR1 gene expression () as well as up-regulation of antioxidant
  enzyme activity, and/or promote the nuclear translocation of NPR1 to induce PR1
  expression ().  perception is mechanistically linked to NPR1-dependent defense responses.
  Induction by  results in the accumulation of  and the activation of NPR1. Activated
  NPR1 then translocates into the nucleus, where it may interact with TGA transcription
  factors, thus leading to the induction of the PR1 gene, and it also activates the
  expression of CalS1 and CalS12 genes in the formation of callose by interacting
  with some unknown transcription factors. These directly induced PR1 expression and
  callose deposition by  constitute plant innate immunity, which protects plants against
  pathogen infection.
