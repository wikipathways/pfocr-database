caption: Network and pathway analysis of shared networks between advanced AD and T2D.
  Integrative meta-analysis was performed on datasets from advanced AD and T2D subjects
  to identify shared dysregulated genes between both diseases. Entrez gene identifiers
  from the genes identified in the meta-analyses were imported into NetworkAnalyst
  for network and pathway analyses. In NetworkAnalyst we selected tissue specific
  networks derived from the protein-protein interaction database from human whole
  blood. The minimum connected network was selected for further pathway analysis.
  Results from the pathway analysis are derived from the KEGG and Reactome. Shared
  networks between advanced AD and T2D were enriched predominantly in genes associated
  to infectious diseases and inflammation (blue circles), the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway (pink circles) and atherosclerosis
  (orange circles).
