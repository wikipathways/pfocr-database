caption: The model of the tripartite synapse is based on the observation that glutamate
  or GABA trigger Ca2+ increases in peri-synaptic glial processes in an mGlu1/5 receptor-dependent
  pathway (or by GABAB receptors in inhibitory synapses). In turn, the increase in
  astrocytic Ca2+ triggers vesicular gliotransmitters release, which modulates synaptic
  strength by binding to pre- and postsynaptic receptors. Six recent diagrams of the
  tripartite synapse illustrating that the tripartite synapse is viewed as the epicenter
  for neuron-glia signaling. A (), B (), C (), D () E (), F ().
