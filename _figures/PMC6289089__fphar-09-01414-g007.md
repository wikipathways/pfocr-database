caption: Summary of pro-angiogenic effects of DQP in CAD rats. Fatty acids oxidation
  axis PPARα-CD36-CPT1A is involved in the pro-angiogenic roles of DQP against CAD.
  The pro-angiogenic effects of DQP is probably mediated through up-regulating key
  enzymes in fatty acids oxidation pathway which is involved in proliferation of endothelial
  cells.
