caption: GPR30 activation by 17β-estradiol elicits the SRC/EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway and promotes p62 phosphorylation—which in turn induces ESR1 protein expression
  through estrogen receptor α (ESR1) detachment from a complex formed with KEAP1.
  This complex interplay provides a link between the rapid-signal effects of estrogens
  (mediated by GRP30) and their canonical genomic effects (mediated by ESR1).
