caption: Significantly affected canonical pathway “Interferon signaling”, as determined
  by IPA™ analysis. Red indicates highly up-regulated proteins, light green indicates
  down-regulated, grey represents not significantly affected, and white represents
  molecules known to be part of the pathway but not identified by SILAC.
