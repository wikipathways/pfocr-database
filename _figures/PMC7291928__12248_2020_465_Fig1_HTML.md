caption: A proposed model of the possible role of ABCB1 to synergize the lysosomotropic
  effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine and to alter SARS-CoV-2 replication
  cycle via the endolysosomal pathway. The diagram shows how the unionized drugs can
  readily diffuse across lysosomal membranes. Due to the acidic environment of the
  lysosome, the equilibrium between charged and uncharged drug species shifts in favor
  of the ionized species, thus limiting their backward diffusion into the cytosol.
  As a substrate of ABCB1, the active uptake of azithromycin contributes to the enhancement
  of this trapping effect and to the neutralization of the acidic pH. This last effect
  contributes to a cascade of anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities
