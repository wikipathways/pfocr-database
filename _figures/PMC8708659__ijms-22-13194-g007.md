caption: Illustration of hypothetic role of lactate in anti-lentiviral protection
  of female genital tract. Under normal conditions symbiotic microbiota produce L-/D-lactate
  and butyrate which can be imported by cervical epithelial cells through MCT1-4 transporters.
  In the nuclear compartment, lactate and butyrate inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs),
  thus, promotes histones acetylation by histone acetylases (HACs). Acetylated histones
  induce chromatin relaxation and recruitment of DNA-PKcs to nucleus (1 pathway).
  Cervical epithelial cells bear HCA1, a specific receptor for lactate. Lactobacilli
  sp. derived lactate stimulates surface HCA1, induce cAMP signaling and cAMP/EPAC/PKA-dependent
  shuttling of DNA-PKcs to nuclear compartment (2 pathway). Excessive nuclear localization
  of DNA-PKcs protects cells from lentiviral (e.g., HIV-1) transduction. Cervicovaginal
  microbiota dysbiosis accounts for lactate shortage and insufficient anti-lentiviral
  protection of first-line defense epithelial cells.
