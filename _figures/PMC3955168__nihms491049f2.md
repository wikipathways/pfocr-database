caption: The heat shock response (HSR) pathway. The mammalian HSR is governed by the
  transcription factor HSF-1. In absence of stress, chaperones maintain HSF-1 as an
  inert monomer. With the appearance of misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm, chaperones
  are titrated away from HSF-1 (1) to deal with misfolding and aggregation. This allows
  HSF-1 to trimerize (2), bind to its consensus sequence (3) and be post-translational
  modified (4) therefore inducing the transcription of chaperones and heat shock proteins
  (hsps) (5). HSF-1 activation pathway is negatively regulated by the newly expressed
  chaperones and hsps, which rebind HSF-1 (6), and by acetyl transferases (HATs) (7).
  SIRT1 positively regulates HSF1 DNA-binding activity (7).
