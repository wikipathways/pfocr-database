caption: 'Mechanisms by which a high-fat diet (HFD) affects hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs). (A) HFD induces clustering of lipid rafts (LRs) on the cell membrane, thereby
  suppressing the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad2/3 signaling pathway,
  which in turn triggers the exit of HSCs from the quiescent state. (B) Obesity-related
  chronic inflammation caused by HFD changes the HSC niche. (C) HFD can cause the
  accumulation of cholesterol in LRs, thereby inducing the myeloid lineage bias of
  HSCs. (D) HFD promotes the adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells (BMSCs) by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  γ(PPARγ) signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the production of HSCs. (E) HFD leads
  to alterations in the gut microbiota and the downregulation of related gene expressions
  detrimental to HSC homeostasis. (Created by Figdraw). *The full names of other abbreviations
