caption: Ell3 expression leads to the suppression of MDM2 expression and activation
  of the IL20 mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Due to the low level of MDM2, p53
  is not ubiquitinated following CDDP treatment. Additional ERK1/2 is phosphorylated
  following CDDP treatment, resulting in increased binding affinity of NQO1 to p53.
  The synergistic effect of suppressing the MDM2 pathway and enhancing the IL20 pathway
  causes rapid stabilization of p53 in Ell3-overexpressing breast cancer cells following
  CDDP treatment.
