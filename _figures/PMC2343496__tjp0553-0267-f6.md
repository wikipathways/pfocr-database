caption: The masseter response to EVS could be generated on the ipsilateral masseter
  muscle by an uncrossed pathway; the same response is generated on the contralateral
  muscle by a crossed pathway. This vestibulo-trigeminal connection could be mediated
  by an inhibitory interneurone located in a relay station at the brainstem level.
  Possible brainstem relay stations are indicated in the figure.
