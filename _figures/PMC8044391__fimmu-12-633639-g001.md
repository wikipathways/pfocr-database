caption: Inside-out pathway of integrin β2 activation. (A) Structure model of integrin
  β2. Subdomains and headpiece/tailpiece portions labeled. (B) In resting β2 integrin
  (middle), the beta subunit (blue) crosses the membrane at a 25° angle, whereas the
  α subunit (pink) crosses vertically (0 degrees). Upon exposure to IL-8 (left), talin-1
  binds to the beta subunit and forces the transmembrane angle to be >25°. This change
  is transmitted to the extracellular domain through the stiff transmembrane domain
  (TMD), resulting in extended β2 integrin with an open headpiece. If the β2 TMD is
  mutated (β2 L697P, right), talin-1 will still bind the intracellular domain and
  align the beginning of the TMD to an angle >25°, but the kink prevents this from
  being transmitted to the extracellular domain. The integrin stays bent, but the
  headpiece opens (). Talin head domain (THD). (C) Key signaling events that occur
  downstream of chemokine and lead to integrin activation. Inactive integrins exist
  in a bent conformation, and the α and β cytoplasmic tails are held in close proximity
  by a salt bridge between residues found in the membrane-proximal region of the tail.
  Activation of a variety of signaling pathways results in the recruitment of GTP-bound
  Rap1 and activated talin to the integrin, leading to tail separation. The conformational
  change in the cytoplasmic region is transmitted through the integrin transmembrane
  domains that result in structural changes in the extracellular region, leading to
  an open conformation that can bind ligand with high affinity. Part of this signaling
  pathway is shown here. a) The Rap1/RIAM/talin-1 axis. Rap1-GTP binds to RIAM, which
  leads to RIAM binding to talin-1 and recruiting of talin-1 to integrin β tails,
  consequently activating the integrin. b) The direct association of Rap1 and talin-1.
  Rap1-GTP binds to talin-1 through talin-F0 and F1 domains, recruiting talin-1 to
  interact with integrin β tails and activation of integrin.
