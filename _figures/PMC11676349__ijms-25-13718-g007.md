caption: 'An overview of the regulatory pathway represented in MapMan. Above: the
  regulation overview pathway of the flash treatment. Below: the regulation overview
  pathway of the 60 s treatment. The differential effects of the flash and 60 s treatments
  on plants are evident from the higher number of DEGs observed in the former. All
  subcategories within the regulation overview exhibit a greater number of DEGs in
  response to the flash treatment. This discrepancy indicates a greater impact on
  the plant regulatory system affected with the flash treatment, suggesting that this
  treatment can stimulate downstream genes involved in transcription, regulation,
  and signaling, as well as protein modification and degradation. However, the flash
  treatment yielded a greater number of receptor kinases, with 65 DEGs, of which 51
  were downregulated and 14 were upregulated. In contrast, the 60 s treatment resulted
  in the upregulation of 27 receptor kinase genes, while the 13 downregulated genes
  were associated with the 60 s treatment. Moreover, the genes that were differentially
  expressed in both treatments are illustrated in both maps. The red dots indicate
  genes that are overexpressed, while the blue dots indicate genes that are underexpressed'
