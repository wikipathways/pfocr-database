caption: The furin autoactivation pathway. Following translocation and signal sequence
  removal, the furin prodomain acts as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) to facilitate
  folding of the unstructured, inactive catalytic domain (pink circle) into the active
  conformation (red oval). After the initial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding events,
  furin undergoes autoproteolytic intramolecular excision of the propeptide at Arg107.
  The propeptide, however, remains associated with the mature domain and functions
  as a potent autoinhibitor in trans during transport to the late secretory pathway.
  Propeptide excision can be blocked by inactivating furin and results in the accumulation
  of an apparent folding intermediate in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/cis-Golgi
  network. These data indicate that both the ER and ERGIC compartments participate
  in the initial steps of furin activation. Following propeptide excision, the inactive
  propeptide complex transits to late secretory compartments — trans-Golgi network
  (TGN)/endosomes — where the relatively acidic pH promotes autoproteolytic, intramolecular
  cleavage of the propeptide at a second, internal site (Arg75). The Arg75 cleavage
  is followed by the rapid dissociation of the propeptide fragments and disinhibition
  of furin. Adapted with permission from ref. . © (2002) American Society for Biochemistry
