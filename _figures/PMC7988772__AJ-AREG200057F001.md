caption: EP receptor signaling and PGE2-mediated wound healing phenotypes. EP1 (blue)
  associates with Gq G protein, which activates phospholipase C (PLC), leading to
  cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), increasing intracellular
  levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binding
  to IP3-gated calcium channels on the endoplasmic reticulum induces release of calcium
  into the cytosol, which acts in concert with DAG to activate protein kinase C (PKC),
  leading to phosphorylation of various proteins. EP1-regulated wound healing outputs
  are listed in the blue box. EP2 (yellow) and EP4 (red) activate two identical signaling
  pathways. First, Gs G protein activates adenylate cyclase (AC, orange), which increases
  intracellular adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), activating protein kinase
  A (PKA), leading to phosphorylation of downstream targets including the transcription
  factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The second pathway (green)
  occurs via β-arrestin/Src-induced EGFR transactivation. This activates IP3 kinase
  (IP3K) to phosphorylate PIP2 to become phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), which recruits Akt to the plasma membrane to be phosphorylated and activated.
  Activated Akt phosphorylates various downstream targets and often induces NF-κB
  nuclear translocation. EP2-regulated wound healing outputs are listed in the yellow
  box. EP4-regulated wound healing outputs are listed in the red box. EP3 (purple)
  associates with the inhibitory G protein (Gi) blocking the activity of AC and reducing
  intracellular cAMP levels. EP3-regulated wound healing outputs are listed in the
  purple box. PGE2, prostaglandin E2.
