caption: Mediators released from activated MCs. MCs express receptors that recognize
  different growth factors, immunoglobulins, bacterial components, and complement-derived
  factors. On a weight basis, ~50% of the protein content of a mature MC in the GI
  tract consists of varied proteases stored in the cell’s secretory granules ionically
  bound to serglycin proteoglycans. When MCs are activated (e.g., by their IgG receptors
  FcγRI and FcγRIII), they exocytose the preformed mediators from their secretory
  granules. Minutes to hours later, the activated MCs generate and release varied
  lipid mediators and cytokine/chemokine mediators, respectively. MCs are heterogeneous
  immune cells in tissues, and the combinations of mediators they produce are dependent
  on the cell’s phenotype and the activating signaling pathway.
