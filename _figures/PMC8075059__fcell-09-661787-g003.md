caption: Downregulation of E-cadherin. EDA/EDAR signaling is downstream of epithelial
  WNT activation. EDA/EDAR signaling activates NF-κB, which in turn leads to the production
  of TGF-β2 by an as yet unknown mechanism. During the induction phase, TGF-β2 downregulates
  E-cadherin via the pSMAD pathway. E-cadherin downregulation leads to the migration
  of epidermal cells, which is a prerequisite for placode formation.
