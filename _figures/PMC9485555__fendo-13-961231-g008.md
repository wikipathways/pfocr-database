caption: Proposed pathway of exercise’s effects on HFD-induced lipotoxicity. Excessive
  intake of dietary lipids induced metabolic disorders of free fatty acids (FFAs)
  and induced the activation of JNK-mediated apoptosis in the liver. However, our
  data show that exercise training alleviates hepatic lipotoxicity and suppresses
  the JNK pathway through enhancing MIF signaling. Thus, we conclude that exercise
  inhibits JNK pathway activation and lipotoxicity via MIF in NAFLD.
