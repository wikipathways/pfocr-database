caption: 'Integration of oncogenic and tumor suppressor inputs by the GLI code in
  cancer. Upon inhibition of PTCH1 function by HH ligands, the repression on SMOH
  is released, SMOH moves into the primary cilium and activates downstream signaling
  by stabilizing activating full-length GLI proteins (GLI1) and blocking the production
  of GLI repressors (GLI3R). The mammalian GLI code includes three proteins. Generally,
  GLI1 is an activator although it exists in N′ and C′ Δ deleted activator and repressor
  forms, respectively, GLI2 has activator and C′ Δ repressor functions and GLI3 is
  a weak activator and its C′ Δ form is a strong repressor. Components of the classical
  HH pathway are in filled circles, in red for inhibitors and in green for activators.
  Positive and negative regulators of HH-GLI signaling are in unfilled circles, in
  blue for the PGF-RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK, PI3K-AKT and JUN pathways, in green for activators
  and in red for repressors. The color of the arrow is dictated by the final effect
  on the GLI code: red arrow for a final repressive effect, green arrow for a final
  activating effect on the GLI code. See text for further details.'
