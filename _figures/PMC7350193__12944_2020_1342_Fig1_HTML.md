caption: The adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) population is a compound system of embryonic
  and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages with the ability of self-renewal.
  Under physiological conditions, ATMs with different phenotypes perform a variety
  of physiological functions. ATMs adopt a metabolically activated (MMe) phenotype
  to promote dead adipocyte clearance through lysosomal exocytosis. Ly6c ATMs support
  normal adipose physiology upon adoptive transfer by inducing genes related to cholesterol
  and lipid biosynthesis. Alternatively activated MFehi ATMs display elevated cellular
  iron content along with an anti-inflammatory and iron-recycling gene expression
  profile. M2 macrophages induce increased UCP1 levels in adipocytes and promote browning
  by mimicking the sympathetic signaling pathway. The interplay between ATMs and adipocytes
  in energy metabolism, glycolysis, OXPHOS, iron handing and even interactions with
  the nervous system. In obesity, the microenvironment of adipose tissue changes dramatically,
  and lipotoxicity, hypoxia, unfolded protein responses (UPRs), oxidative stress and
  other harmful pathological changes occur in succession. Under these conditions,
  ATMs undergo changes in numbers, phenotype, and metabolic state
