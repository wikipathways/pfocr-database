caption: Components of the insulin/IGF axis. The IGF axis consists of ligands (insulin,
  IGF-1, and IGF-2), receptors (INSR, IGF-1R, IGF-2R, and IGF-1R/INSR hybrid receptors),
  IGFBPs 1 to 7, and IGFBP proteases. The IGF ligands bind their receptors and binding
  proteins with high affinity. IGFBPs bind tightly to IGF ligands, influencing binding
  to their receptors; IGFBP proteases cleave the IGFBPs into fragments with lower
  affinity for the IGF ligands, thereby increasing free IGF-1 and IGF-2 bioavailability.
  IGF-1/IGF-2 and insulin can cross-bind to each other’s receptor, albeit with much
  weaker affinity than that for the preferred ligand. Activation of the INSR-B isoform
  regulates glucose metabolism, while activation of IGF-1R, INSR-A, and IGF-1R/INSR
  hybrid receptors promotes cellular growth, proliferation, survival, and metastasis.
  IGF-2R is an unrelated monomeric receptor that acts as a scavenger for circulating
  IGF-2 [, , ]. IGF-1/−2 insulin-like growth factor ligand 1/2, IGFBP IGF binding
  protein, IGF-1R/IGF-2R type 1/type 2 IGF receptor, INSR insulin receptor
