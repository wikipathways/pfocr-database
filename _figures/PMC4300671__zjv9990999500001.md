caption: Working model for rotavirus cell entry into MA104 cells. (a) RVs attach to
  the cell surface through different glycans, depending on the virus strain. After
  initial binding, the virus interacts with several coreceptors concentrated at lipid
  rafts. All known coreceptors are represented as a single blue Y symbol. (b) RVs
  are internalized into cells by clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways,
  depending on the virus strain. (c) Regardless of the endocytic pathway used, all
  RV strains reach EEs in a process that depends on RAB5, EEA1, and probably on HRS
  and the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) (). (d) At the EE, the virus probably begins
  to be internalized into the endosomal lumen through the action of VPS4A. (e) EEs
  progress to MEs, with a progressive decrease in pH and intraendosomal calcium concentration
  through the function of the v-ATPase; during this process the formation of ILVs
  increases. (f) E-P rotaviruses RRV and SA11-4S reach the cytoplasm from MEs. (g)
  GTPase Rab7 participates in the formation of LE compartments; ILVs increase in number.
  (h) The stability and function of LEs depend on the arrival of cellular factors
  (e.g., cathepsins) from the trans-Golgi network, traffic that is mediated by M6PRs,
  and the GTPase Rab9, among other factors. (i) L-P RV strains reach late endosomes.
  RV nar3's exit from LEs requires the function of Rab9. (j) RV strains UK, Wa, WI61,
  DS-1, and YM require, in addition to Rab9, the function of the CD-M6PR and the activity
  of cathepsins to productively infect cells. (f, i, j) The cytosolic double-layered
  particles begin transcribing the RV genome to continue the replication cycle of
  the virus. The different colors of the viruses represent those strains that exit
  from MEs (orange) or from LEs that do not require cathepsins (blue) or form LEs,
  but do require the activity of CD-M6PR and cathepsins (green). HBGA, human histo-blood
  group antigen; LBPA, lysobisphosphatidic acid.
