caption: 'Pathways regulated in PKD are influenced by tolcapone. The polycystin pathway
  is disrupted in PKD resulting in decreased intracellular calcium levels. Adenylyl
  cyclase VI is in turn simulated and intracellular cAMP is increased. cAMP further
  stimulates the ERK pathway via Raf-B increasing cell proliferation. Mechanisms and
  components upregulated in PKD are shown in blue and downregulation is shown in yellow,
  effects observed in male PKD/Mhm rats upon 3 months of Comt inhibition with tolcapone
  in orange. PC 1: polycystin 1, PC 2: polycystin 2, R: G protein-coupled receptor,
  AC VI: adenylyl cyclase VI, PKA: protein kinase A, CFTR: cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator, V2R: vasopressin 2 receptor, ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase, Gi and Gs: G-proteins, cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate.'
