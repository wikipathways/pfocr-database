  to ring modifications, vertical reactions correspond to side-chain modifications.
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A shikimate:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl-transferase;
  C3′H, p-coumaroyl shikimate 3′-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic
  acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCALDH, hydroxycinnamaldehyde
  dehydrogenase. The reaction catalyzed by HCALDH leads to the synthesis of ferulate
  and the sinapate esters.
