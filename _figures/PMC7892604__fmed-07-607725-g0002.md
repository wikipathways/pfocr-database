caption: JAK-STAT signaling pathway. When a ligand (usually a cytokine) binds to its
  receptor in a cell, it triggers the autophosphorylation of the receptor-associated
  Janus kinases (JAKs). Activated JAKs phosphorylate the intracellular tail of the
  receptor on critical tyrosine residues, which leads to the recruitment and binding
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. STATs are phosphorylated
  by JAKs, which induces their dissociation from the receptor. STATs form homo- or
  heterodimers and translocate into the cell nucleus, where they bind to specific
  DNA regions and activate target gene expression. Negative regulators of the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway include protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which remove phosphate
  groups from receptors, JAKs and STATs; protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS),
  that prevent the DNA-binding activity of STATs; and suppressor of cytokine signaling
  proteins (SOCS), which inhibit the activity of JAKs. DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid;
  JAK, Janus kinase; P, phosphate; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; PTP,
  protein tyrosine phosphatase; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription.
