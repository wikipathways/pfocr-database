caption: Loss of RAGA-1 in C. elegans extends lifespan but decreases growth. raga-1
  deletion in these animals specifically requires fused intestinal mitochondria to
  promote longevity. This lifespan extension of raga-1 null animals is suppressed
  by neuron-specific rescue of raga-1, which drives mitochondrial fission in peripheral
  tissues non-cell autonomously through neuronal signals to modulate lifespan. These
  animals with neuronal raga-1 rescue show lifespan similar to wild-type (WT) animals
  but continue to exhibit decreased growth showing that TORC1 pathway can be modulated
  in specific tissues to uncouple longevity and growth ().
