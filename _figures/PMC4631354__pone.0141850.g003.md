caption: (A) The major FAs in C. elegans are produced by the elongation and desaturation
  pathway shown here. An alternate pathway downstream of FA synthase (fasn-1) is used
  for the production of monomethyl-branched chain FAs, C15iso and C17iso. (B) The
  amount of new FA incorporated each hour was quantified in animals treated with adult-only
  RNAi against the FA synthesis, elongation and desaturation genes for 48 hours. The
  resulting data are summarized here with species with less replenishment than control
  RNAi colored light blue (>25% decrease) and dark blue (>50% decrease). See S1 Dataset
  for complete source data. (C) To determine the overall impact on membrane replenishment,
  we averaged the replacement rates for each FA species and normalized by the abundance
  of each species in the PL population. RNAi of pod-2, fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7 resulted
  in significant reduction in overall membrane maintenance. (D) The relative amount
  of synthesized FA is reduced with fat-7 RNAi treatment (blue) compared to control
  RNAi (black). Numbers shown represent the mean of at least three experiments ± SEM.
  Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired t-tests (*p<0.05,
  **p<0.01, ***p<0.001)
