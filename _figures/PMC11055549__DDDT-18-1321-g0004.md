caption: 'Construction of the prognostic target-ingredient network. (A) Visualization
  of the groups of upregulated (76) and downregulated (70) therapeutic targets. The
  red and blue circles in the square represent the numbers of targets related to poor
  prognosis and good prognosis, respectively. (B) The action network of targets related
  to poor prognosis and their related ingredients. Targets (red) and ingredients (green).
  The ingredients inside the orange dotted line are those with a higher degree value
  (≥4). (C-D) The interaction network of hub targets (pink: prognosis-related targets,
  green lines: targets related to the cell cycle pathway). (E) Network of ingredients
  and hub targets. (F) Pathway and biological process enrichment analyses of the hub
  target-related genes'
