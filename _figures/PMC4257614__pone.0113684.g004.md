caption: All 22 X-linked protein-coding genes that showed evidence of association
  and replication () are denoted by black diamonds and are presented together with
  genes that interact with them (grey circles) (). Physical interactions refer to
  documented protein-protein interactions. Genetic interactions represent genes where
  perturbations to one gene affect another. Predicted interactions were obtained from
  orthology to interactions present in other organisms . All but four of these 22
  genes share interacting partners according to these known and predicted interactions.
  Results of a pathway analysis based on this interactome are presented in .
