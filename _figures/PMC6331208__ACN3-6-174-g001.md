caption: Model of neuroprotective effects of DBS at the synapse. DBS stimulates increased
  BDNF release which induces structural and functional changes at the synapse by binding
  pre‐ and postsynaptic TrkB receptors. At the presynaptic terminal, activation of
  the cAMP‐PKA and MAPK pathways promotes increased presynaptic gene expression including
  key proteins involved in axonal growth and guidance (e.g. GAP 43) (1) and neurotransmitter
  vesicle release (e.g. synaptophysin, Rab3a) (2)., , , ,  MAPK phosphorylation of
  synapsin also releases neurotransmitter vesicles from cytoskeleton‐bound pools (3).
  TrkB‐mediated activation of PLC γ increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration leading
  to increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release (4). At the postsynaptic terminal,
  TrkB activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA‐type glutamate receptor
  (NMDAR) subunits, increasing conductance (5).,  Activation of the PLC γ pathway
  induces a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and subsequent activation of
  Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylate
  AMPA‐type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) subunits and increase their delivery to the
  postsynaptic terminal (6). Elevated Ca2+ levels may also activate transcription
  factor EB (TFEB), which is the major regulator of autophagy and could enhance clearance
  of toxic misfolded proteins (7).,  TrkB‐mediated activation of cAMP response element
  binding protein (CREB) and Erk enhances gene transcription (8). BDNF‐TrkB signaling
  also enhances postsynaptic protein translation through both MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt
  pathways (9). The PI3K/Akt pathway is also involved in regulating the trafficking
  of proteins (e.g. PSD95) to the postsynaptic terminal (10) and inhibition of apoptosis
  (11).,
