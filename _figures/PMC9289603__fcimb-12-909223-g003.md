caption: Signal pathways in progression to cervical cancer. Oncogenes E6 and E7 are
  overexpressed as the HPV genome is integrated into the host genome. E6 combines
  with E6AP to degrade p53, and E6 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway which increases
  β-catenin and promotes cell proliferation. E7 acts on the Rb family and disrupts
  their connection with E2F transcription factors. The interaction of E7 with HDACs
  leads to chromosome remodeling and genome instability. E6 acts on PDZ protein to
  inactivate PTEN, resulting in an increase in pAkt and enhancing cell proliferation.
  E7 enhances the ability of Akt to bind and inactivate Rb, which proves that both
  E6 and E7 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. The interaction between the two oncoproteins
  and DNMTs leads to abnormal methylation and thus silences tumor suppressor genes.
  The combined effect of these mechanisms causes the occurrence of tumors.
