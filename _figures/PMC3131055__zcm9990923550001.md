caption: 'Wolbachia-induced responses of specific cell types. Wolbachia-exposed dendritic
  cells are activated via the TLR2/6-MyD88-Mal pathway, as shown by enhanced expression
  of surface costimulatory molecules and produce proinflammatory cytokines, inducing
  a preferential type 1 (Th1) immune response (, ). Macrophages stimulated with Wolbachia
  or Wolbachia-containing but not Wolbachia-depleted filarial extracts enhance their
  surface expression of costimulatory molecules and produce proinflammatory cytokines
  and oxidative products. Macrophages can be homo- and heterotolerized by a subsequent
  stimulation, contributing to the immune downregulation characterizing the majority
  of filarial infections (, , , ). Neutrophils and corneal stromal cells are also
  able to interact with Wolbachia via the TLR2-MyD88 pathway, producing CXC chemokines
  and contributing to the inflammatory response to the parasite (–). Mast cells are
  stimulated by Wolbachia via TLR2 to degranulate and increase vascular permeability
  to facilitate establishment of infection (). Abbreviations: TLR, Toll-like receptor;
