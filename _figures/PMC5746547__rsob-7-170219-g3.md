caption: 'Glutamine and asparagine in angiogenesis. Glutamine plays a key role in
  EC metabolism: it constitutes a major precursor for macromolecules biosynthesis
  and the main substrate for TCA cycle anaplerosis, it participates in redox homeostasis
  and is also shown to be a precursor for lipid biosynthesis in ECs through reductive
  carboxylation. Glutamine deprivation or GLS1 blockade/deletion leads to a severe
  defect in proliferation and migration in ECs. Asparagine supplementation (together
  with α-ketoglutarate) rescues the phenotype showing an interlink between glutamine
  catabolism pathway and asparagine synthesis via ASNS. Proliferative defect following
  glutamine deprivation or GLS1 blockade/deletion in ECs can be partially rescued
  through macropinocytosis.'
