caption: Two proposed biosynthesis pathways involving Pen and Pal. In a sequential
  reaction pathway, Pen was incubated with UDP-GlcNAc, and Pal was then added. In
  the co-incubation pathway, both enzymes Pen and Pal were incubated together with
  UDP-GlcNAc. In the sequential reaction, UDP-GlcNAc was converted to UDP-6-deoxy-d-GlcNAc-5,6-ene
  (labeled as “C”) by Pen, followed by Pal converting C to keto and hydrated forms
  of l-configured UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-AltNAc (labeled as “K” and “H”). Note that
  products K and H were able to undergo C4″ transamination reaction by Pam leading
  to product A, UDP-4-amino-6-deoxy-l-AltNAc. In the co-incubation pathway, UDP-GlcNAc
  was converted to a mixture of four products, including C, K, H, and a novel product
  F, a d-configured UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-GlcNAc. After a long period of incubation,
  the product would be predominantly F, as the other products, including C, K, and
  H, would be consumed. Note that product F, UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-GlcNAc, was not
  a substrate for Pam; hence Pam was unable to C4″ transaminate this d-configured
  UDP-sugar.
