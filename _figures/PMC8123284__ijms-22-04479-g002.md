caption: Summary of brain iron cycle and mitochondrial functions. Iron crosses the
  BBB via the TfR pathway on the endothelium. The brain iron cycle involves glia and
  neurons. Astrocytes extend long processes that enclose the brain capillaries and
  help to form the BBB. The DMT1 transports iron. Near the ends of these processes,
  a special form of the Fe oxidizing enzyme, Cp, is expressed. Iron binds to Tf circulating
  in CSF and enters the neurons mainly by TfR. The cells export iron mainly by FPN1.
  Into the cells, the mitochondrial electron transport chain contains multiple iron–sulfur
  (Fe–S) clusters and heme-containing proteins necessary for ATP synthesis. NADH dehydrogenase
  (complex I) contains Fe–S clusters, succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) contains
  Fe–S clusters and one heme moiety, while complex III (cytochrome bc1) contains Fe–S
  cluster and several heme groups vital for its functions. Complex IV (cytochrome
  c oxidase) also contains two heme moieties. Aconitase is a key enzyme, catalyzing
  the reaction of citrate to isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
  containing Fe–S clusters.
