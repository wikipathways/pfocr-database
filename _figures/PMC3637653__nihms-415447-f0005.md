caption: ROS allow stem cells to shift from the quiescent state to the functional
  state such as differentiation and migration. ROS can promote the survival pathway,
  but also lead to senescence. ROS modulate the activities of various kinases and
  phosphatases, which in turn activate redox-sensitive signaling cascades. Of note,
  many of these molecules have also been shown to regulate basal ROS levels in stem
  cells, suggesting that feed-forward or feed-back mechanism by which stem cells respond
  to redox state and oxidative stress. Please see the main article for the details.
