caption: Mycobacterium evades macrophage apoptosis by induction of anti-apoptotic
  cytokines and miRNAs expression. Three cytokines, namely, IL-10, IL-17A, and EBI3,
  were demonstrated to play an anti-apoptotic role during Mtb infection. IL-10 can
  mediate the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl3 protein and suppresses the
  production of pro-apoptotic factors, including TNF-α, nitric oxide (NO), and P53.
  IL-17A signaling leads to suppression of P53 mediated Bax mitochondrial translocation.
  EBI3 can directly inhibit caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Nine anti-apoptotic
  miRs were found selectively regulated by Mtb. Has-let-7b-5p can target Fas leading
  to inhibition of downstream activation of caspase-3. Let-7a and miR-29a are targeting
  caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively. MiR-155 can abolish expression of SH2 domain-containing
  inositol 5-phosphatase 1(SHIP1), leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) signaling-mediated inhibition of pro-apoptotic factors including Bad, FOXO-1
  and 3. In addition, miR-155 can directly targeting and suppressing the expression
  of FOXO-3. MiR-582-5p can target the mRNA of FOXO-1 and block its expression. MiR-20a-5p
  can abrogate the activation of pro-apoptotic factor Bim by targeting the JNK-2 signaling
  pathway. However, miR-20b-5p can enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic factor
  Mcl-1, which can mediate block Bax mitochondrial translocation. The role of miR-21
  in regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 remains controversial.
