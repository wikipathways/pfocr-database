caption: 'Simplified biosynthetic pathway of chicoric acid. The enzymes involved in
  each step are reported with their acronym in bold and their encoding genes were
  analyzed in this study, with the only exception of HQT and CAS (between bracket).
  Abbr: PAL—phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H—cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; C3H—p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase;
  4CL—4-(hydroxyl) cinnamoyl CoA ligase; HTT—hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tartaric acid hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; HQT—hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; CAS—chicoric
  acid synthase. For more detailed information see [,].'
