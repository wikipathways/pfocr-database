caption: 'Traditionally, G proteins function as signal transducer in transmembrane
  signaling pathways that consists of three proteins: receptors, G proteins, and effectors.
  The receptors that participate in this pathway have seven transmembrane domains.
  G proteins consist of a heterotrimeric structure composed of guanine nucleotide
  binding alpha, plus beta and gamma subunits. Beta and gamma subunits form a tight
  association under non denaturing conditions. Receptor-activation allows GTP to bind
  to the α subunit of the heterotrimer. Subsequently, activated Gα changes its association
  with Gβγ in a manner that permits both subunits to participate in regulation of
  intracellular effector molecules. Termination of the signal occurs when GTP bound
  to the α subunit is hydrolyzed by its intrinsic GTPase activity, which causes its
  functional dissociation from the effector and re-association with βγ. A hypothetical
  framework for cytoplasmic G protein-signaling is shown. In this model, α and βγ
  subunits of G proteins (Only the Gsα are released from the membrane by agonist activation,
  but the Giα and Goα have a cytosolic presence. All three, as well as Gq, evoke Gβγ
  release into the cytosol.) regulate microtubule assembly/dynamics (red arrows).
  By forming an inactive Gαβγ heterotrimer, this signaling pathway is terminated (purple
  arrows). In this model, AGS proteins will modulate assembly/disassembly of microtubules
  by interacting with α and βγ subunits of G proteins. Lipid modification of G protein
  subunits i.e myristoylation of Gα and prenylation of Gγ are expected to play key
  roles in microtubule regulation, similar to that observed with G protein signaling
  in membrane (53–54) (not shown in the model). Through this mechanism, G protein-coupled
  receptors might be involved in regulating the interplay of Gi1α, Gβγ, AGS (or other
  Gα-interacting proteins) and tubulin/microtubules.'
