caption: A model for DNA end resection. DNA end resection is initiated by MRN and
  CtIP through internal cleavage of 5′-strand DNA from the DNA ends. Subsequent resection
  extension is carried out by two parallel pathways mediated by Exo1 and Dna2, respectively.
  In the Exo1 pathway, PCNA loads onto the DSB from the ends and serves as a processivity
  factor for Exo1 in resection extension. MRN also enhances Exo1 processivity. The
  BLM helicase promotes Dna2-mediated resection extension. Binding of RPA to the 3′
  ssDNA overhangs generated by end resection leads to recruitment and activation of
  ATR and subsequent checkpoint response. Replacement of RPA by Rad51 on the 3′ ssDNA
  overhangs leads to DNA repair by HR.
