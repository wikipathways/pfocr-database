caption: Proposed signaling pathways implicated in the promoter-specific expression
  of CYP19 in Hs578t cells. It is proposed that thiacloprid and imidacloprid block
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which regulates I.4 promoter activity via a yet unknown mechanism.
  In addition, based on the effects of pathway inhibitors, the neonicotinoids are
  proposed to increase PII/I.3-mediated CYP19 expression in Hs578t cells via stimulation
  of the PLC pathway. Thiacloprid may also induce I.7-mediated CYP19 expression by
  stimulation of the MEK/MAPK 1/3 pathway. , calcium ion; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
