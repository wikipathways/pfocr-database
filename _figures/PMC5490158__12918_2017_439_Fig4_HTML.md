caption: Upstream regulators identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, predicted to
  participate in the regulation of gene expression upon α2B-adrenoceptor activation
  in A7r5-α2B vascular smooth muscle cells. The network of upstream regulators with
  │z-score│ > 2 is illustrated in panel (a). The network of PKC, PKA and Pdgf targets
  is presented in panel (b). Red and green colors indicate upregulation and downregulation,
  respectively. Explanation of gene symbols in Additional file
