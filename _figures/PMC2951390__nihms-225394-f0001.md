  biology approaches. (A) High nitrate situation: nitrate is transported and probably
  sensed by the NRT1.1 transporter. Inside the cell, nitrate can regulate nitrate
  primary response genes such as NIA, NiR and NRT2.1 and primary root growth by a
  pathway involving calcium accumulation, the CBL proteins and the CIPK8 protein kinase

  cytokinin, ABA and/or auxin signaling pathways to regulate developmental programs

  root growth [-] (e). Localized high nitrate supply is also known to induce the MADS-box
  transcription factor ANR1 to promote lateral root elongation [, ] (f). N metabolites
  produced by nitrate reduction and assimilation also have signaling roles repressing
  lateral root growth by a pathway involving ANR1 [] (g), determining the ratio between
  initiating and elongating lateral roots by regulation of the miR167/ARF8 module
  in the pericycle [] (h), regulating Gln biosynthesis by regulation of the ASN1,
  GDH1 and GLN1.3 genes by the master clock gene CCA1 [] (i) and repressing primary
  root growth [-] (j). Nitrate is also able to alleviate primary root growth inhibition
  by glutamate (k). (B) Low nitrate situation: nitrate can be transported and probably
  sensed by the high-affinity NRT2.1 transporter. Limiting nitrate conditions can
  regulate drought tolerance by repressing miR169 and inducing the A5 subunit of the
  NF-Y transcription factor [] (l), regulate the expression of genes related to N
  stress adaptation by pathways involving NLP7 and NLA [-, ] (m,n) and induce lateral
  root initiation when plants are transferred from high to low nitrate conditions
