caption: 'The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The secreted Frizzled-related protein
  (sFRP) family or Wise bind to Wnt proteins, leading to inhibition of the interaction
  between Wnt and the Frizzled receptor. Sclerostin or Dickkopf (DKK) binds to lipoprotein
  receptor-related proteins (LRP) 5/6 to inhibit Wnt signaling. Cytosolic accumulation
  of β-catenin in response to a canonical Wnt signal is a crucial step in the signaling
  pathway. Left: In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin associates with the destruction
  complex composed of Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase (CK) 2,
  and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3. GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin, inducing rapid
  degradation of β-catenin via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Right: The canonical
  Wnt signaling is initiated by the binding of the Wnt ligand to Frizzled and LRP5/6.
  Subsequently, Wnt ligand blocks β-catenin degradation, allowing transportation to
  the nucleus, where β-catenin interacts with the transcription factor T-cell-specific
  factor (TCF) and activates target gene expression.'
