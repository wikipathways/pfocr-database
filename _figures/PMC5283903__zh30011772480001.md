caption: 'A: a simplified model showing basic differences in the myogenic molecular
  mechanisms responsible for the initiation of contraction followed by its fade in
  the phasic (denoted by white tracing line) vs. development of tone followed by its
  maintenance in the tonic (denoted by red tracing line) smooth muscles. Typical examples
  of truly phasic smooth muscles are those of esophageal body (EB) and anococcygeus
  (ASM), while those of tonic smooth muscles are lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
  and internal anal sphincter (IAS). In this illustration, smooth muscle contraction
  in rat ASM (induced by electrical field stimulation) and spontaneous tone in the
  rat IAS (without any stimulus) represent phasic and tonic activities, respectively.
  Initial events for the contractility both in the phasic and tonic smooth muscles
  are similar as they are dependent on increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), followed
  by formation of Ca2+/calmodulin complex and activation of MLCK leading to increase
  in p-MLC20. The triggers for the initial phasic contraction and tone maintenance
  have been discussed in the text. As indicated by highlighted bold letters, myosin
  light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) plays a critical role in the characteristic fading
  of contraction in the phasic and in the maintenance of developed tone in the tonic
  smooth muscle. Once initiated, the phasic contraction quickly fades because of dephosphorization
  of p-MLC20 by active MLCP and lack of other support mechanisms to maintain high
  levels of p-MLC20. However, in the tonic smooth muscles, the basal tone is sustained
  because higher levels of p-MLC20 are maintained primarily via inhibition of MLCP
  by RhoA/ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of regulatory subunit of MLCP (p-MYPT1) and
  other effects as laid out in B. In the tonic smooth muscles, RhoA/ROCK may be either
  constitutively active or GPCR activated. This figure does not reveal the sources
  of increase in [Ca2+]i and the role of actin polymerization and cytoskeleton reorganization
  in the smooth muscle contractility. These features are, however, discussed in the
  text. ↑↓, an increase or decrease, respectively, in the expression or activity;
  *, for simplicity only the major target of RhoA/ROCK (MYPT1 which is phosphorylated
  by RhoA/ROCK) is shown here. RhoA/ROCK does, however, have the additional ability
  to increase p-MLC20 as shown in B. B: different mechanisms by which RhoA/ROCK can
  increase p-MLC20 for the sustained contraction initiated by Ca2+/calmodulin/MLCK
  as follows via 1) inhibition of MLCP through phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit
  MYPT1 (p-MYP1); 2) phosphorylation of protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitor (CPI-17)
  (p-CPI-17) that causes subsequent inhibition of MLCP via its catalytic subunit PP1c
  and via p-MYPT1; and 3) MLCK-like effect. In addition, this illustration suggests
  a partial role of PKC in the mediation of basal smooth muscle tone by phosphorylation
  of CPI-17; and double arrow between RhoA/ROCK and PKC suggests a cross talk between
  the two pathways. An increase in p-MLC20 initiated by Ca2+/calmodulin/MLCK and sustained
  by RhoA/ROCK activation leads to smooth muscle contraction, while its dephosphorylation
  via MLCP causes relaxation. For more details, consult text.'
