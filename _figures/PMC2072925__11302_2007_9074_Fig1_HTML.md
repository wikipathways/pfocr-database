caption: Purine-induced signaling pathway involves the activation of P1 adenosine
  and P2 purinergic receptors and purine hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases. The scheme
  demonstrates purinergic receptor activity present in glia-glia, neuron-glia, and
  neuron-neuron interaction during neurogenesis as well as in the metabolism of the
  adult brain

  neuroprotection, and brain disorders.
