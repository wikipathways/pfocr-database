caption: a A working model illustrating dual pathway coordination of FOXO and FOXO-target
  genes. (i) The loss of NPF/NPFR signalling in the CC—enhanced AKH/AKHR signalling
  induces FOXO nuclear localisation and carbohydrate/lipid metabolism—and (ii) the
  loss of NPF/NPFR signalling in the IPCs—attenuation of insulin signalling induces
  FOXO nuclear localisation and enhances carbohydrate/lipid metabolism. The balance
  of AKH/AKHR and insulin signalling is coordinated by gut-derived NPF that responds
  dietary sugars. b (left) In D. melanogaster, enteroendocrine cells respond to the
  dietary sugars by secreting a neuropeptide, NPF, which signals via its neuronal
  receptor NPFR. NPF/NPFR signalling regulates energy consumption through dual neuronal
  relay which are restriction of glucagon-like, AKH production, and enhancement of
  insulin-like peptides (DILPs). Subsequent modulation of AKHR and insulin signalling
  within the fat body/adipose tissue maintains lipid/carbohydrate catabolism; thus,
  impaired NPF/NPFR signalling leads to depletion of energy stores. (right) The EEC-IPC
  and the EEC-CC axes in D. melanogaster are similar to the gut EECs-pancreas axis
  in mammals. Mammalian enteroendocrine hormone, GLP-1 also controls insulin and glucagon
  levels in response to dietary nutrients.
