caption: Breast oncogenesis is mediated by various signaling pathways. When growth
  factors bind to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; e.g., EGFR, IGFR, FGFR, and
  Her-2), the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway stimulates cell proliferation and increases cell
  motility. The Akt protein activates anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
  and Bad, whereas it inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax, p53, therefore
  resulting in cell growth by inhibiting apoptosis. Another signaling pathway called
  the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway promotes the expression of transcription factors
  essential for cell survival and tumorigenesis, including c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and
  ELK-1. ERK1/2 activates Iκ-B kinase (IKK), inducing proteasomal degradation of Iκ-B,
  which is an inhibitory protein bound to NF-κB. The released NF-κB migrates into
  the nucleus and stimulates an inflammatory response by transcription of IL-6, IL-8,
  COX-2, and iNOS.
