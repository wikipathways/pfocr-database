caption: Soluble uric acid has been shown to modulate cytokine production and inflammatory
  outcomes via several pathways. Uric acid enhances AKT phosphorylation, leading to
  PRAS40 phosphorylation, and resulting in autophagy inhibition; this is in line with
  downregulation of expression in genes involved in FOXO pathway. Uric acid was shown
  to inhibit AMPK phosphorylation, which is consistent with mTOR activation. Several
  transcription factors can be induced by uric acid signaling (NFκB or AP-1) following
  p38 and ERK MAPK activation, leading to enhanced transcription of innate cytokines
  in addition to the remarkable downregulation of natural IL-1 antagonist, IL-1Ra.
  In vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells or adipocytes, enhanced transcription
  of vasoactive substances is known to lead to elevated angiotensin II, MCP-1, endothelin
  and low availability of nitric oxide which can mediate hypertension. In vascular
  cells, growth factors such as PDGF are upregulated, leading to smooth muscle cells
  proliferation and promotion of atherosclerosis. Soluble uric acid has also been
  shown to induce oxidative stress, alter the redox status of the cell which, on the
  one hand, activates signaling pathways for gene transcription and, on the other
  hand, lead to ASC speck formation and inflammasome activation, thus contributing
  to cleavage of pro-IL-1β. The transcriptional rewiring of uric acid stimulated cells
  is reminiscent of innate immune memory developed in response to endogenous sterile
  stimuli, leading to a scenario in which soluble uric acid acts as a silent stimulus
  that drives epigenetic reprogramming in circulating or tissue resident cells, thereby
  causing persistent inflammatory effects in response to continuous exposure to uric
  acid. We propose a model in which cells exposed to high uric acid levels are more
  prone to develop a strong proinflammatory response when exposed to specific triggers
  due to innate immune memory, epigenetic changes in exposed cells or persistence
  of exposure to high uric acid levels.
