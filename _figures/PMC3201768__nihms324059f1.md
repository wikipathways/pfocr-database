caption: The cytosolic calcium concentration [Ca2+]c can be increased (fat upward
  arrow) by either calcium influx from the extracellular space through the voltage-dependent
  calcium channel (VDCC) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor on the
  plasma membrane (PM) or by calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through
  either the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) or the ryanodine receptor
  (RYR). Calcium releases from the ER through either InsP3R and/or RYR decreases the
  ER calcium concentration and increase cytosolic calcium concentrations. Increased
  [Ca2+]c also leads to an increase in the mitochondrial calcium concentration. Excessive
  and abnormal increase in the [Ca2+]c activates calcium-dependent calpain and activates
  caspase, resulting in apoptosis. Abnormal elevation of mitochondrial calcium concentration
  can collapse mitochondrial membrane potential (MtPTP), release cytochrome C from
  mitochondria to cytosol, activate caspase 9 and 3 and trigger intrinsic pathway
  apoptosis. Depletion of ER calcium itself may induce apoptosis directly by inhibiting
  normal protein synthesis. Isoflurane can increase the [Ca2+]c by activating gamma-aminobutyric
  acid A (GABAA) receptors, which depolarize the PM and activate the L-type VDCC and
  result in calcium influx. Isoflurane also activates the InsP3Rs and RYRs, causing
  calcium release from the ER. Excessive and abnormal activation of GABAA, InsP3R
  and RYR by isoflurane may cause the above calcium dysregulation and cell death by
  apoptosis. In accordance, the antagonists for the GABAA receptor (bicuculline),
  the L-type VDCC (nicardipine), InsP3R (xestospongin C) and RYR (dantrolene) have
  all been shown to inhibit isoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis. NMDA receptor activation
  plays an important role in formation and regulation of cytosolic calcium oscillation,
  which is important for gene regulation, neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis
  in immature neurons. Ketamine inhibits the NMDA receptor and therefore suppresses
  cytosolic calcium oscillation, which results in the damage of synaptogenesis and
  neuronal apoptosis in immature neurons.

  description: The cytosolic calcium concentration [Ca2+]c can be increased (fat upward
    arrow) by either calcium influx from the extracellular space through the voltage-dependent

    decreases the ER calcium concentration and increase cytosolic calcium concentrations.
    Increased [Ca2+]c also leads to an increase in the mitochondrial calcium concentration.
    Excessive and abnormal increase in the [Ca2+]c activates calcium-dependent calpain
    and activates caspase, resulting in apoptosis. Abnormal elevation of mitochondrial
    calcium concentration can collapse mitochondrial membrane potential (MtPTP), release
