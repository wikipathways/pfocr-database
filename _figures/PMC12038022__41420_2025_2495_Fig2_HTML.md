caption: In the left panel, Fe3+ bound to TF and binds to TfR1 on the cell membrane
  to enter the cell by endocytosis. Excess iron can directly lead to ferroptosis,
  and ROS is also produced, which promotes the peroxidation of PUFAs on cell membranes.
  GPX4 can inhibit ferroptosis by reducing lipid peroxidation. As shown in the figure
  on the right, glucose starvation leads to high uptake of cystine and reduced cysteine,
  NADPH depletion and disulfide stress due to intracellular accumulation of disulfides,
  which activates the Rac-WRC-Arp2/3 signaling pathway, leading to disulfide bond
  abnormalities in actin cytoskeletal proteins and disulfidptosis
