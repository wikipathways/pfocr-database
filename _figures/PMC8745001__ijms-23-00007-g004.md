caption: Mitochondrial import deficiency leads to proteotoxic stress. Defective import
  leads to the cytosolic accumulation of precursors, resulting in mitochondrial precursor
  overaccumulation stress (mPOS). Among the responses to mPOS, cells decrease translation
  and ribosome biogenesis to reduce the overload of proteins. Precursor accumulation
  also triggers unfolded protein response activated by mistargeting of proteins (UPRam)
  to increase proteasome assembly and activity. The mitoprotein-induced stress response
  is a transcriptional reprogramming that depends on heat shock transcription factor
  (Hsf1), which under stress conditions is released from chaperone complexes. Hsf1
  will induce the expression of Hsp proteins, and through Rpn4, also proteasome levels.
  Mitoprotein-induced stress response also reduces levels of precursor-encoding mRNAs.
  Mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in nematodes reacts to import impairment
  in an ATFS-1-dependent manner. ATFS-1, which physiologically is imported and degraded
  in mitochondria, under the stress condition, localizes to the nucleus to increase
  the production of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases. UPRmt in humans depends
  on the proteolytic release of DELE1 protein by mitochondrial protease OMA1. In the
  cytosol, DELE1 promotes eIF2α phosphorylation, which modulates translation to trigger
  gene expression reprogramming. MTS-containing precursors that accumulate in the
  cytosol can be directed to the nucleus for proteasomal degradation in the nuclear-associated
  mitoprotein degradation (MitoNUC) pathway. Degradation is mediated by San1, Ubr1,
  and Doa10 E3 ubiquitin ligases. If not degraded, mislocalized precursors misfold
  and form aggregates.
