caption: 'Role of the glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases: 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
  (CAT:MST) axis in promoting and sustaining cancer. Cancer cells presenting defective
  mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) exhibit low levels of NADH/NAD+ and
  mitochondrial aspartate (mAsp). These cells can take advantage of the reversible
  reaction catalyzed by cytoplasmic CAT (cCAT) (but not mitochondrial CAT (mCAT)),
  as observed in cancer cells with KRAS mutations, directing it to the production
  of Asp rather than its consumption, maintaining growth and survival. MST is pointed
  as a facilitator of cancer, probably due to multiple effects of H2S: (1) cytoprotection
  and chemoresistance by stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)—protein kinase
  B (Akt), p3—MAPK and nuclear factor erythroid 2—related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways;
  (2) evasion of apoptosis by stimulating Nrf2, together with MERK and kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1); (3) angiogenesis promotion by increasing neovascularization
  through a KATP channel/p38/hsp27 pathway, leading to the activation of MAPK pathways,
  and (4) stimulation of cellular bioenergetics by directly injecting reducing equivalents
  into the mETC, and by persulfidation ATP synthase, glycolytic enzymes and lactate
  dehydrogenase.'
