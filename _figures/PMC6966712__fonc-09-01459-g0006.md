caption: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligand (PD-L1) involvement in T-cell
  mediated suppression and maintenance of immune evasion. Under physiological conditions,
  T cell is activated against any foreign antigen presented on the surface of antigen-presenting
  cell through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by means of T-cell receptor
  (TCR) phosphorylation when oligomerization of TCR/CD3 chains takes place; this is
  followed by recruitment of activated Lck and Zap-70 to the phosphorylated immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of TCR tail, and this leads to the start
  of downstream TCR-signaling cascade. In cancer state, when PD-L1 present on cancer
  cells interacts with PD-1 expressed on T-cell surface, SHP-2 is recruited to ITSM,
  and the two tyrosine residues on PD-1 cytoplasmic tail acquire a phosphorylated
  status. This will result in dephosphorylated Lck and Zap-70 and hence their inactivation.
  Furthermore, PD-L1-PD-1 ligation suppresses PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which affects
  normal T-cell metabolic pathway, shifting the pathway toward fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) instead of glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, resulting in creation of
  immune suppressive milieu through enhanced T regulatory cells (immune suppressive
  cells) and exhausted T-cell differentiation and impaired effector and memory T cells
  differentiation.
