caption: 'In cancer cells, EGF or EGF-related ligands bind to EGFR and phosphorylate
  tyrosine kinase residues, activating three major signal transduction pathways: MAPK,
  PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT, which promote cell survival. Upregulated PI3K/Akt activation
  also stimulates metabolic enzymes (i. e. hexokinase) to drive tumour metabolism.
  Cancer cells are reliant on mitochondrial metabolism for the increase of glucose
  to satisfy increased energy requirements. Glucose enters the cell via the glucose
  transporter (GLUT) to initiate glycolysis. HKII binds to voltage-dependent anion
  channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) to form a complex. Thus,
  the simultaneous inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway and tumour metabolism
  pathway was explored. Gefitinib binds to the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR to inhibit
  the activation of EGFR signalling whilst PENAO is transported across the plasma
  membrane and enters the mitochondrial matrix to interact with Cys57 and Cys257 residues
  in the ANT, perturb the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and decrease
  ATP delivery to the cancer cell.'
