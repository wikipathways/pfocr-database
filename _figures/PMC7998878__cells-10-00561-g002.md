caption: The TRIM8-p53 pathway. Following genotoxic stress, p53 promotes TRIM8 transcription
  and, through a positive feedback mechanism, TRIM8 stabilizes and activates p53,
  inducing the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Furthermore,
  p53 promotes the transcription of miR-34a, which in turn inhibits the activity of
  MYCN and the expression of miR-17-3p and miR-106b-3p. Therefore, TRIM8 is no longer
  silenced by these miRNAs. The final effect is the p53-mediated cell cycle arrest
  and the restoration of cells’ chemosensitivity to therapeutic treatments. However,
  in certain circumstances, the combined activation of TRIM8 and p53 can result in
  negative outcomes as in response to hypoxic stress due to ischemia following stroke
  or myocardial infarction.
