caption: Typical two-component system HK–RR signaling pathway and the potential inhibitor
  luteolin (Lut). (a) The detailed process of signal transduction via histidine kinase
  (HK) and the downstream response regulator (RR); (b) crystal structure of HK853cp-ADP
  complex []. HK853DHp was colored in red, HK853CA in blue, and the two adenosine
  diphosphate (ADP) molecules in green; (c) chemical construction of luteolin.
