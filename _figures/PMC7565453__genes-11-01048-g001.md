caption: The results of the reactome pathway analysis. The protein extracts from the
  HEK293 cells were used for the immunoprecipitation study. There were 202 proteins
  with a two-fold increase (Klotho Ab vs. non-specific IgG) identified by the immunoprecipitation
  (IP)/LC/MS/MS analysis, and followed by reactome pathway analysis. (A) Plot of the
  pathways with p value less than 0.05. The significant pathways were marked as yellow
  lines. (B) Plots of the pathways of the cell cycle and mitosis. Three significant
  pathways of cell cycle and mitosis, Aurora kinase A (AURKA) activation, clearance
  of nuclear envelope, and recruitment of NuMA are shown and marked with orange lines.
