caption: 'Top: Within the ‘bow-tie’ microarchitecture of layered signal flow in any
  circuit, incoming signals from RTKs like EGFR [signal input; left] are integrated
  by core proteins like GIV [center] that activate second messengers like cAMP, which
  subsequently impacts multiple target proteins such as kinases, phosphatases, and
  transcription factors [output signals; right]. Prior systems biology work had concluded
  that cellular concentrations of cAMP is a key determinant of robustness at the core
  of information (signal) flow (; ; ). While cAMP production is tuned up or down by
  variable levels of GIV and its compartmentalized action on Gai/Gas and ACs within
  the RTK-cAMP pathway, cAMP degradation by PDEs serves as a dominant sink [drainpipe].
  Bottom: Within the hourglass microarchitecture for vertical flow of ‘control’, up/down-regulation
  of GIV-GEM in cells serves as a tunable control valve, allowing cells to control
  cAMP production in cells responding to growth factors. When GIV-GEM expression is
  low [as seen in the normal epithelium], increasing input signals can trigger some
  of the highest levels of cellular cAMP, thereby conferring sensitivity (left). Increasing
  GIV-GEM expression throttles the cAMP response [middle], such that, when GIV-GEM
  is expressed highly [as seen across all cancers, cAMP levels remain low, regardless
  of the amount of input signals, thereby conferring robustness [right].'
