caption: TGFβ family members exhibit distinct effects on heart hypertrophy TGFβ binds
  to its own receptors RII and RI, activates TAK1, SMAD2/3, and p38, and moderately
  promotes cardiac hypertrophy. Several GDFs antagonize heart hypertrophy at the physiological
  range of concentration. GDF8 exhibits anti-hypertrophy effect in the heart by multiple
  mechanisms. It inhibits the pro-hypotrophic PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, but also
  suppresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated glycolysis, ATP production
  in the heart. GDF11 shows similar effect as GDF8, but its mechanism is not as well
  studied as GDF8. GDF15, by modulating SMAD2/3 and PI3K/Akt signaling, exhibits anti-hypertrophy
  function.
