caption: p53 Stabilization by curcumin and synergy with routine therapy for the treatment
  of cervical cancer. Curcumin activates the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear
  factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Keap1/Nrf2) pathway, leading to an increase
  in the levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). NQO1 binds to p53, promoting
  the loss of the interaction between p53 and E6AP, a negative regulator, promoting
  p53 stabilization in cancer cells with wild-type p53, such as cervical cancer cells.
  Moreover, a promising area of study is that of evaluating the synergistic effect
  of curcumin with routine chemotherapy, thus procuring a better response to treatment
  and fewer adverse effects.
