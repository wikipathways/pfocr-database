caption: Schematic illustrating the mechanism in which elevated HP induces apoptosis
  in RGCs through the regulation of the NGF signalling pathway. The protein and mRNA
  expression level of NGF were decreased in RGCs exposed to HP levels of 40, 60 and
  80 mmHg HP; the binding of NGF to TRK receptors activate the PI3K/AKT signalling
  pathway. When AKT is activated by NGF-stimulated phosphorylation, it may influence
  RGC apoptosis in three ways. First, it may phosphorylate the target of FoxO1 to
  mediate cell fate decisions by regulating apoptosis. Second, AKT may phosphorylate
  ASK1 and reduce its activity; the kinase JNK1/2, downstream of ASK1, phosphorylates
  and activates FoxO1 protein, resulting in cell apoptosis. Third, the decrease in
  NGF may trigger reduced phosphorylation of AKT and CREB to induce RGC apoptosis.
