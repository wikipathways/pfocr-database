caption: The proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism of T0901317. TLR4-mediated inflammatory
  pathway was activated by stimulating with LPS. T0901317, a potent LXR agonist, exhibits
  anti-inflammatory effect through increasing mRNA level of MyD88-S splicing isoform
  by down-regulating SF3A1 expression, leading to NF-κB mediated inhibition of inflammatory
  response in RAW264.7 macrophages.
