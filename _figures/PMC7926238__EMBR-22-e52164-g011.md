caption: ADuring DNA replication termination, CUL2LRR1 promotes ubiquitylation of
  CMG‐MCM7, leading to disassembly by p97‐UFD1‐NPL4.BIn cells that lack CUL2LRR1 activity,
  the CMG replisome remains on chromatin after DNA replication termination. Upon entry
  into mitosis, the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase activates a second pathway of CMG disassembly,
  dependent upon p97.CPrevious work showed that TRAIP is required in human cells to
  process sites of incomplete DNA replication during mitosis, by a process of Mitotic
  DNA Synthesis or “MiDAS” (Sonneville et al, ). It is likely that the first step
  in this pathway is TRAIP‐dependent CMG disassembly upon entry into mitosis.
