caption: Tentative biosynthetic pathway of gemmatoxanthin. The biosynthesis of the
  gemmatoxanthin pathway begins from phytoene and lycopene. Lycopene undergoes modification
  by the hydroxylase/oxidase activity of enzymes (genes are not yet known) to form
  lycopen-19-al which was tentatively predicted in Lamprocystis roseopersicina belonging
  to the Chromatiaceae family,. The cruF gene and crtF gene are probably responsible
  for the addition of terminal methoxy group in the pathway. We hypothesize that the
  1′ carbon of methyl group undergoes modification by the hydroxylase/oxidase enzyme
  encoded by cruH gene yielding carboxylic acid, which is already known in synechoxanthin
  pathway,. Two unidentified genes similar to cruH gene was found in the genome of
  the G. phototrophica AP64 using tblastn showing 36.607% similarity (GEMMAAP_15370)
  and 23.034% identity (GEMMAAP_15125).
