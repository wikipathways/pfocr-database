caption: 'Aromatase (AROM; CYP19A1) catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione (A)
  and testosterone (T) to estrone (E1) and 17β-estradiol (E2), respectively. Some
  of the other enzymes involved in E1⇔E2 inter-conversion (activation-deactivation)
  and genotoxic product formation are also shown. Three possible pathways of estrogen
  action are schematically depicted. Two examples of E1/E2-derived genotoxic mutations
  are provided. Each pathway represents a simplified summary of the current understanding
  of the area from its vast literature, some of which are referenced in the introduction.
  Ade: adenine, Gua: guanine.'
