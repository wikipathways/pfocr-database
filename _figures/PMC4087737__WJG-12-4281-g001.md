caption: 'A: The heme biosynthetic pathway. Mitochondrial and cytosolic locations
  of the eight enzymes are shown circled and coloured. Commencing synthesis is ALAS
  on the inner mitochondrial membrane of the first intermediate as well as subsequent
  intermediates. Heme synthesis is regulated by heme at the level of ALAS via feedback
  repression. It has been suggested that frataxin may donate ferrous iron to protoporphyrin
  in the formation of heme; B: In the intestinal crypts the uptake of plasma transferrin-iron
  occurs by the transferrin receptor (TfR). In iron deficiency HFE complexes with
  TfR1 and to a much lesser extent with iron loading. (1) TfR binds to plasma diferric
  transferrin. (2) TfR is internalised by receptor mediated endocytosis. (3) In the
  cytoplasm a v-H+ATPase fuses with the endosome and acidifies it to release the iron
  from transferrin. Following ferrireduction Fe(II) is transported to the cytoplasm
  by a metal transporter. (4) possibly divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). The iron
  is then transported into the mitochondria where it is incorporated into heme. The
  mitochondria are also a major producer of iron sulphur clusters. (5) The transferrin
  receptor - apotransferrin complex then return to the cell membrane where at the
  neutral pH, apotransferrin dissociates. Heme, heme oxygenase and BVR may regulate
  gene transcription during enterocyte differentiation. FLVCR functions to export
  excess heme.'
