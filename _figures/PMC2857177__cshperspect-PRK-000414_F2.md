caption: The cellular machineries required for OM biogenesis. The Lpt pathway, together
  with MsbA, transports LPS from its site of synthesis to the cell surface. β-barrel
  proteins and lipoproteins are made initially in the cytoplasm in precursor form
  with a signal sequence at the amino terminus. The signal sequence directs these
  precursors to the Sec machinery for translocation from the cytoplasm. Chaperones
  like SurA deliver beta-barrel proteins to the Bam machinery for assembly in the
  OM. For OM lipoproteins, after the signal sequence is removed and lipids are attached
  to the amino-terminal cysteine residue, the Lol machinery delivers them to the OM.
