caption: Migrating D-loop model of recombination. After DSB formation the ends are
  processed to reveal protruding 3′ single-stranded tails. One tail invades a homologous
  duplex to form a D-loop that migrates concomitant with DNA synthesis. With collapse
  of the D-loop as shown on the left side, the newly synthesized strand may anneal
  with the complementary protruding single-stranded tail on the other side of the
  break. Further fill-in synthesis will result in a non-crossover product. If the
  D-loop is captured by the protruding strand from the other side of the DSB, as shown
  on the right side, it may be processed to form an intermediate with one or possibly
  two Holliday junctions. Resolution of the Holliday junction by nicking the top and
  bottom strands will yield crossover products, while nicking the two inner strands
  will yield non-crossover products. The U. maydis gene products that serve in recombination
  are shown on the right side of the diagram at the approximate step in the pathway
  where they are thought to function.
