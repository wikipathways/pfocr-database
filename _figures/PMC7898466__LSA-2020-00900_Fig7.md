caption: (A) TLS pathways for replication through Tg. After nt insertion by Polκ,
  Polζ extends synthesis. Polλ’s scaffolding role is required for Polζ function in
  TLS. This pathway conducts error-free TLS through the Tg lesion. The alternative
  Polθ-dependent TLS operates in an error-prone manner. (B) TLS pathways for replication
  through εdA. After nt insertion by Polι, Polζ extends synthesis. Polλ’s scaffolding
  role is required for Polζ function in TLS. This pathway operates in an error-free
  manner. Polθ-dependent TLS provides the other major TLS pathway and TLS requiring
  Rev1 polymerase function contributes to a relatively minor pathway. Polθ and Rev1
  polymerase–dependent TLS operate in an error-prone manner. The thickness of the
  arrows depicts the relative contribution of TLS Pols to lesion bypass.
