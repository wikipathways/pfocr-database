caption: A model of metabolic inflexibility in beta cells. (a) The healthy beta cell
  secretes insulin in a bi- (or tri-) phasic fashion. The first phase is dependent
  on glucokinase-dependent glucose phosphorylation; the second phase is dependent
  on various mitochondrial signals, as indicated, which in turn arise from either
  glucose-, lipid- or amino acid-derived acyl-CoA. We have proposed that FOXO preserve
  the balance of mitochondrial function by supporting the MODY gene networks and suppressing
  the PPARα-dependent lipid oxidising pathway. (b) When FOXO become functionally exhausted,
  this balance breaks down, and mitochondria are flooded with an oversupply of lipid-derived
  acyl-CoA, which promotes peroxide formation and other biochemical abnormalities
  that impair insulin secretion, eventually leading to dedifferentiation. CaV, voltage-dependent
  Ca2+ channel; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; Lc-FA, long-chain
  fatty acids; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDX1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1
