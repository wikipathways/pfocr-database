caption: Upon binding of Wnt ligands to receptors such as Frizzled (Fzd) and Ror2,
  multiple downstream signaling cascades are activated. Dishevelled (Dvl) serves as
  a cytoplasmic hub for signal transduction. Dvl binds to Daam1 to either activate
  RhoA directly or inhibit RhoA through Cdc42. Cofilin serves as a downstream effector
  of the ROCK/LIMK or ROCK/SSH pathway to cause actin rapid reorganization. Actin-binding
  protein profilin also works downstream of Dvl-Daam1 by binding to monomeric actin,
  and these profilin-actin complexes are them assembled into rapidly growing actin
  polymers at the barbed end (or +end) by nucleation proteins (e.g., formin). Dvl
  can also bind to aPKC [], the latter of which oppresses MARK2 activity via phosphorylation
  [], therefore stabilizing microtubule (MT) network by protecting MT-associated proteins
  (MAPs) from being phosphorylated by MARK2. Activation of Dvl-Rac1 signaling is independent
  of Dvl-RhoA which leads to changes in actin dynamics mediated throuigh effectors
  such as the Arp2/3 complex and the JNK signaling. Vangl2 is working in concert with
  Prickle and antagonizes Dvl signaling by affecting the cellular localization of
  Dvl. Vangl2 can also associate with Scribble and Rac1 to modulate actin cytoskeletal
  function. The binding of Wnt ligands to Wnt receptors can be blocked by antagonists
  such as sFRPs, which in turn oppresses Wnt/PCP signaling. (see text for details)
