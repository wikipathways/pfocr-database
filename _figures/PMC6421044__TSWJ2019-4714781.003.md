caption: 'Regulatory loop among Kaiso, Wnt11/5a and Suz12. (a) The genes Wnt11 and
  Wnt5a upregulate Suz12 expression (suppressor of zeste 12) acting in the nucleus
  as transcriptional factors. Kaiso and TCF/LEF cooperate to repress the transcription
  of Wnt11 and Suz12 activate the transcription of Kaiso. This regulatory loop proposed
  could be reinforced by other nonclassical-Pc-functions as, for example: (i) EZH2
  physically interacts directly with β-catenin, functionally improves the Wnt target
  gene expression and phenotypically leads to the overexpression of c-Myc and cyclin
  D1 [, ], (ii) BMI1 might also act as an activator of WNT pathway by repressing Dickkopf
  (DKK), and its negative regulation results in upregulation of c-Myc that participate
  in a positive feedback loop, activating the transcription of BMI1 [], and (iii)
  the overexpression of WNT/β-catenin signaling can also lead to increase Wnt11 expression
  [–]. (b) Expression analysis of Kaiso in Suz12 knockdown cells. K562 cells were
  transfected with siRNA-Suz12 (25nM). Twenty-four hours later, RNA was isolated and
  subjected to Real Time RT-PCR to quantify expression of Kaiso after normalization
  to β-actin and compared to the scrambled knockdown cells. Data were expressed as
  mean ± standard deviation (SD). Columns, mean (n = 3); error bars, SD; ∗p < 0.001.'
