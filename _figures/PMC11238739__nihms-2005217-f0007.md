caption: The cullin CUL-6 is upregulated as part of the IPR, a novel stress response
  pathway. HSP-90 is a substrate of the CUL-6 ubiquitin ligase complex and is degraded
  in the lysosome. The degradation of HSP-90 improves survival after heat shock stress,
  or thermotolerance. When the IPR is activated, upregulated expression of CUL-6 leads
  to increased trafficking of HSP-90 to the lysosome, resulting in higher thermotolerance
  relative to an inactive IPR state
