caption: mut-p53 alters the communication of tumor cells with their microenvironment.
  In tumor cells mut-p53 interacts with a plethora of transcription factors including
  NF‐κB, HIFs, and STATs, and regulates the expression of genes encoding secreted
  proteins. This activity alters the composition of the tumor secretome and hereby
  the communication of tumor cells among them and with non-transformed stromal cell
  populations. Mut-p53 driven secretion of soluble proteins, including cytokines/chemokines
  and growth factors, induces tumor cell invasion and migration, immune evasion, tumor-promoting
  inflammation and angiogenesis. In addition, mut-p53 interferes with the function
  of the cytoplasmic DNA sensing machinery, i.e. cGAS-STING-TBK1 complex, abrogating
  type I interferon response and disabling the innate immune response. Moreover, mut-p53
  stimulates secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and matrix remodeling
  enzymes, thereby altering the biochemical and biomechanical properties of the ECM
  and promoting activation of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). This also results
  in cancer cell mechanostimulation, sustaining the stabilization of mut-p53 protein.
  By inducing the expression of miR-30d (see text for details), mut-p53 fosters diacylglycerol
  (DAG) signaling in the Golgi Apparatus, causing morphological and functional alterations
  known as Golgi Tubulo-Vesiculation, thus enhancing total protein secretion. Persistent
  ER stress, consequent to enhanced secretion, evokes several mut-p53 activities that
  support cell survival, including modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR).
  By sustaining EGFR and integrin signaling via the Rab-coupling protein (RCP) pathway
  and dynamin-1/APPL1 endosome feedback loop, mut-p53 facilitates cancer cell migration
  and invasion. Finally, mut-p53 modulates tumor cell messaging also through exosome
  secretion. The release of podocalyxin-rich (PODXL) exosomes contributes to activate
  CAFs and promotes ECM remodeling; mut-p53 dependent release of exosomes enriched
  for miR-1246 induces macrophage polarization towards pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype,
  further stoking tumor promoting inflammation.
