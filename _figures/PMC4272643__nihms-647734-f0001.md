caption: A) Schematic representation of tRNA gene architecture in S. pombe including
  variable length regions. The upstream TATA box (at approximate position −30 relative
  to transcription start site, TSS) promoter element is required for all known pol
  III transcribed genes in S. pombe. The intragenic A box and B box promoter elements
  are indicated as is the terminator element, oligo(T) represented by T1. Three adjacent
  circles between A and B boxes represent the anticodon. Variable loop and intron
  if present are indicated. B) A S. pombe tRNA gene with promoter elements bound by
  transcription factors, TFIIIB and TFIIIC is shown, based on studies of S. cerevisiae
  (, , ). TFIIIC (purple) is a six subunit complex that binds to A and B boxes and
  recruits Brf1 (cyan) and Bdp1 (light cyan) to the TATA box-bound TBP (gray). TFIIIB
  remains bound to DNA after initiation by pol III resulting in a high rate of transcription
  reinitiation (). The 17 subunit pol III (light orange) is shown with the three termination
  related subunits, the C53/37 dimer and C11, highlighted in dark orange and gray
  respectively (see text). The La protein (yellow) binds in a sequence-specific and
  length-dependent manner to the 3′ oligo(U) tract of the RNA product that results
  from transcription termination at the oligo(T) terminator, and is the first protein
  to associate with newly synthesized nascent pol III transcripts (see text). C) Schematized
  nascent suppressor pre-tRNAserUCA and its various processing steps; color coding
  reflect the RNA copies of the A and B box elements. A clover leaf structure of nascent
  pre-tRNA is shown with the 5′ leader, intron, 3′ trailer and other elements as indicated;
  dihydrouridine stem loop (DHU-loop), variable arm, and thymidine-pseudouridine cytidine-rich
  stem loop (TΨC-loop). Arrows indicate intron-exon boundaries. Mature tRNA position
  25 is indicated at the base of the DHU-loop (see text) as well as mature tRNA positions
  1 and 72. Various steps in the maturation process are indicated on either side of
  the horizontal dashed arrow. Pre-tRNA splicing occurs in the cytoplasm in yeast
  (, ) and assorted chemical modifications of various nucleotides occur at multiple
  points during tRNA maturation (reviewed in ). D) The S. pombe ade6-704 mRNA encoding
  the AIR carboxylase (see text) bears a premature UGA stop at codon position 215.
  In the absence of the opal suppressor tRNAserUCA, the ade6-704 mRNA undergoes incomplete
  translation and cells accumulate a purine biosynthetic pathway intermediate that
  forms red pigment when grown in limiting adenine media (left panel). In the presence
  of a functional suppressor tRNAserUCA, the stop codon is decoded and active Ade6
  protein is made, the purine pathway intermediates are metabolized, and accumulation
  of red pigment is prevented, leading to white colonies (right panel).
