caption: 'The pathways for energy production in astrocytes: effects of CNTF. (1) Glucose
  is taken up by astrocytes through the transporter Glut-1 and is oxidized into pyruvate
  through glycolysis. LDH transforms pyruvate into lactate that may be exported to
  the neurons. (2) Pyruvate and lactate enter the mitochondria where they are further
  oxidized through the TCA cycle and the electron transfer chain (ETC) to produce
  ATP. (3) Ketone bodies can also fuel the TCA cycle with acetyl-CoA after cellular
  and mitochondrial uptake by MCT1 and oxidation by BDH and SCOT. (4) Fatty acids
  are exclusively metabolized by astrocytes through acylation by acyl-CoA synthase
  (ACS), uptake by CPT1 and β-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA that may either fuel
  the TCA cycle or be condensed into ketone bodies through ketogenesis. Ketone bodies,
  as lactate, may be given to neurons. (5) The fatty acid palmitate, once acylated,
  may alternatively fuel the pathway of ceramide neosynthesis, which is associated
  with apoptotic cell death. CNTF decreases glucose uptake and LDH activity. The expression
  of several key enzymes/transporters of ketolysis and β-oxidation are enhanced, consistent
  with the observed increase in the rate of ketone bodies and fatty acid oxidation.
  CNTF metabolic targets are represented with plus, equal, and minus red signs. Enzymes
  appear in italic.'
