caption: Ubiquitin-dependent and -independent lysosomal sorting of GPCRs. In the classic
  paradigm, agonist stimulation induces GPCR ubiquitination and internalization to
  early endosomes. The ubiquitinated GPCR is then recognized by ESCRT-0/HRS harboring
  an ubiquitin-interacting motif and ESCRT-I and -II containing UBDs. GPCRs are deubiquitinated
  before sorting into the ILVs of the late endosome/multivesicular body; the later
  process is regulated by ESCRT-III/charged MVB protein-4 (CHMP4) and the AAA-ATPase
  VPS4A,B. In contrast to the canonical ESCRT pathway, PAR1 is sorted to lysosomes
  independent of ubiquitin and the canonical ESCRT machinery. New studies indicate
  that activated and internalized PAR1 is recognized by the adaptor protein ALIX,
  which binds to a YPX3L motif within the second intracellular loop of the receptor,
  and links PAR1 to ESCRT-III/CHMP4 to facilitate sorting to ILVs of MVBs/lysosomes.
  It is noteworthy that PAR1 is modified with ubiquitin, although ubiquitin is not
  essential for PAR1 lysosomal sorting, suggesting additional functions for ubiquitin
  in GPCR regulation that remain to be discovered.
