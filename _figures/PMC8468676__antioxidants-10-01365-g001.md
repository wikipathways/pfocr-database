caption: Testicular tissue oxidant/antioxidant balance. In the testicular tissue,
  the main sources of reactive species are activated in testicular macrophages and
  defective germ cells. The hydroxyl radicals (OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−),
  along with the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are the ROS that more often target the
  male reproductive system. Sertoli cells and Leydig cells are equipped with a very
  efficient antioxidant system. The main antioxidant enzymes found in the male reproductive
  system are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase
  (GPx), along with non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH). Testicular
  cells are very sensitive to OS. Thus, a prolonged OS situation affects the steroidogenesis
  capacity of Leydig cells through mitochondrial impairment. Developing germ cells
  are also susceptible to OS, which is thought to be part of the complex signaling
  pathway responsible for selective germ-cell death. In order to maintain the homeostasis
  of seminiferous tubules, the oxidant, and antioxidant species balance each other,
  maintaining an adequate environment for steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis to occur.
