caption: Interferon (IFN)-dependent IFN stimulated gene (ISG) transcription through
  the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling.
  By binding to the IFN-α receptor (IFNAR) or IFN-λ receptor (IFNLR), type I/III IFNs
  activate the JAK-STAT pathway leading to the formation of IFN-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3) and gamma-IFN activation factor (GAF) complexes. The ligation between
  IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) also activate the GAF complex. ISGF3 and GAF complexes
  then translocate into the nucleus mediated by importins and recruit additional coactivators,
  such as CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 on the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-
  or gamma IFN activated sequence (GAS)-containing promoters to stimulate expression
  of a distinct group of ISGs. Eventually, a set of ISGs are produced and amplify
  the IFN response. IFN-induced suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins inhibit
  JAK-STAT signaling by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on either JAK1
  or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).
