  5-143 via an arylative cyclization of N-propargyl-benzylamidines 5-142 with aryl
  iodides. The reaction most likely proceeds via intermolecular aminopalladation (5-144)
  to produce cyclic intermediate 5-145, followed by a reductive elimination and aromatization
  of the intermediate 5-146 (). On the other hand, the Sonogashira reaction and subsequent
  cycloisomerisation could be an alternative pathway for this transformation.
