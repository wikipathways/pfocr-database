caption: The physiological functions of the P2X7 receptor in bone cells. Numbers in
  brackets refer to published cellular functions associated with P2X7 receptor activation
  and/or expression. (1) Mechanostimulation induces ATP release. (2) Modulation of
  ATP release by the P2X7 receptor. ATP release from osteoblasts involves vesicular
  exocytosis. In osteoclasts, ATP release is associated with P2X7 activation, but
  the exact mechanism has not yet been determined. (3) Osteoblasts may be a source
  of local cytokine release possibly through the P2X7 inflammasome pathway. (4) ATP
  is released from osteoblasts upon mechanical and nucleotide stimulation and mediates
  paracrine signalling to neighboring cells via P2X7 receptor activation. (5) P2X7
  receptor activation induces RANKL expression in osteoblasts and subsequently formation
  of osteoclasts from mononuclear precursors. (6) P2X7 receptors activation is coupled
  to intracellular signalling pathways in osteoblasts that induce cell growth and
  bone formation. (7) In osteoclasts, P2X7 receptor activation is linked to fusion
  of mononuclear osteoclast precursors and to apoptosis and cell survival hand to
  activation of osteoclastic bone resorption.
