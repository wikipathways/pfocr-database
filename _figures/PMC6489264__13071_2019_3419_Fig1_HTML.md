caption: Dauer signalling pathway model proposed for Haemonchus contortus. The cGMP
  (red), TGF-β (orange), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (green) and steroid
  hormone (light blue) signalling pathways are constructed based on information and
  data available for C. elegans. Pathway components not identified in H. contortus
  are indicated in grey. It is hypothesized that environmental signals are received
  by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through cGMP signalling in chemosensory neurons,
  transduced via TGF-β and insulin-like peptides in parallel TGF-β signalling and
  IGF-1 signalling, which then converge into the steroid hormone signalling pathway
  via the biosynthesis of dafachronic acids (DAs; ligands of nuclear hormone receptor
  DAF-12) in neuroendocrine tissues, determining the activation of DAF-12 in target
  (hypodermal) cells. The activation of DAF-12 initiates or regulates numerous molecular
  events such as transcription. Signalling or regulation is indicated by an arrow
  or cross-line. Phosphorylation events detected in the third larval stage (L3) of
  H. contortus are indicated by a phosphate group (yellow). Dashed arrows indicate
  pathways which need to be further elucidated. Drawing is adapted or modified from
  previous publications [, , , ]
