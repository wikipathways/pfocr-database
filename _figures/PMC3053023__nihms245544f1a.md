caption: Figure 1a. Hh pathway is silent in Hh-responsive cells when Hh ligands are
  absent. Cells that are capable of responding to Hh ligands (i.e., Hh-responsive
  cells) express Hh receptors. Patched (Ptc) is the receptor that physically interacts
  with Hh ligands. In the absence of Hh ligands, Ptc represses the activation of a
  co-receptor-like molecule, Smoothened (Smo). This repression prevents Smo from interacting
  with other intracellular factors that permit the stabilization and accumulation
  of Glioblastoma (Gli) transcription factors. Thus, Gli proteins undergo phosphorylation
  by various intracellular kinases (PKA, GSK3b, CSK), become ubiquitinated, move to
  proteasomes and are degraded. Reduced availability of Gli factors influences the
  transcription of their target genes. Lack of Gli1 and Gli2 generally reduces target
  gene transcription, while lack of Gli3 can either stimulate or inhibit transcriptional
  activity.Figure 1b. Hh ligands activate Hh pathway signaling. Interaction between
  Hh ligands and Ptc liberates Smoothened from the normal repressive actions of Ptc.
  This results in eventual inhibition of factors the promote Gli phosphorylation/degradation,
  and permits cellular accumulation of Gli. Other factors that inhibit Gli-phosphorylation,
  such as insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF), have also been shown to facilitate stabilization
  of Gli1 in cells that are otherwise capable of producing this protein. There is
  also a report that Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFb) can stimulate Gli accumulation
  via mechanisms that may operate independently of Smoothened. Nuclear accumulation
  of Gli factors, in turn, influences transcriptional activity of Gli-target genes.
  Gli1 and Gli2 generally increase gene transcription, while Gli3 can either increase
  or decrease gene transcription depending on its post-translational modification.
