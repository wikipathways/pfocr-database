caption: The illustration shows the suggested role of SARS-CoV-2 in EMT induced by
  ROS in cancer cells. SARS-CoV-2 can use ACE2 and NRP-1 as entry receptors. SARS-CoV-2
  can directly lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads
  to ROS induction. Glycolysis induced by hypoxia contributed to ROS induction. Moreover,
  hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 leads to HIF-1α and NLRP3 stimulation. NLRP3 contributes
  to mitochondrial dysfunction IL-1β, and IL-18 maturation. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
  by binding to the Eph receptor, stimulates the ERK/Snail/EMT signaling pathway.
  ROS stimulates the downstream signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, PI3K/AKT/NF-κB,
  and HIF-1α. All these signaling pathways cause the induction of expression of Snail,
  Twist, AXL, ZEB1, 2, and glycolytic enzymes, leading to EMT induction, chemo-resistance,
  and tumor metastasis
