caption: The microscopic mechanisms of chronic kidney disease-induced cerebral microbleeds
  are locally relevant. The development of hypertension is accompanied by the development
  of chronic kidney disease, and when dietary, environmental, or other stimulus signals
  such as accumulation of uremic toxins are transmitted to the brain to activate the
  sympathetic nerves, the persistent activation of microglia and neuroinflammation
  occurring promotes the development of hypertension, and disruption of the blood–brain
  barrier. Elevated blood pressure also activates the RAAS system, and hyperperfusion
  promotes cerebrovascular damage. Immune cells are released into the gut and kidneys,
  destroying gut flora and PH, and immune substances end up in the renal circulation.
  When vitamin D deficiency, oxidative stress will further promote the release of
  inflammatory factors, part of the inflammatory response can also be achieved through
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, a large number of inflammatory factors to promote increased
  permeability of the brain barrier, damage to the vascular endothelium, accelerated
  the formation of CMBs (By Figdraw.)
