caption: Pathomechanism of vasoconstriction in patients with Raynaud phenomenon. The figure
  illustrates Endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptors in vascular smooth muscle and their interactions
  with nitric acid (NO). ET-1 is produced from big-ET-1 catabolized by the ET-converting
  enzyme (ECE) expressed in endothelial cells. ET-1 binds to ETA and ETB receptors,
  both of which share the same G-protein (Gq) signaling pathway. Activation of either
  receptor leads to processing the molecule phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) on vascular smooth muscle facilitating the
  muscle contraction. ETB receptors are expressed on both endothelial cells and smooth
  muscle, mediating vasoconstriction. Binding ET-1 to endothelial ETB receptors stimulates
  the activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that converts l-arginine (l-arg) to
  nitric oxide (NO), which diffuses into the vascular smooth muscle cells to activate
  formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which signals smooth muscle
  relaxation and leads to vasodilation
