caption: Putative mechanism of PLAB-induced cell cycle G2/M arrest in human melanoma
  cells. PLAB might cause DNA damage which activates ATM kinase. This activation possibly
  increases the expression of p53 and Chk2. An increment of p53 in cells causes transactivate
  p21waf1 and an increment of Chk2 phosphorylates/inactivates Cdc25C. Caffeine, an
  ATM kinase inhibitor, blocks the effects of PLAB on Chk2 and p53. PLAB might result
  in up-regulation of Weel. An increment of Weel, a decrement of Cdc25C, and an elevation
  of p21waf1 might cause inhibition of Cdc2, which contributes to G2/M arrest. (↑)
  increased; (↓) decreased; (⊥) abolished.
