caption: Potential mechanisms of microbial interference in UV-induced immune suppression.
  Microbiome, consisting of bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, and mites, covers the
  skin surface as well as colonizes in appendages and glands. This cutaneous microbiome
  encounters similar UV-R as skin cells do. UV-R could directly alter the microbial
  communities on the skin, by producing microbial photoproducts such as pyrimidine
  dimers and/or 6-4 photoproducts, leading to microbial killing. At sub toxic levels,
  UVR may initiate a pathogen/damage-associated molecular pattern (PAMP/DAMP) response.
  Such a response may result in the expression of various microbial signals such as
  oleic acid, LPS and/or porphyrins, affecting the overall immune signaling cascade,
  leading to inflammation, and altered immune response. Microbial metabolites can
  also exert an effect on dendritic cells which can recognize or can be involved in
  direct capture of microbes. Moreover, microorganisms can produce natural AMPs directly
  or can control AMP production by keratinocytes and their production can be increased
  by exposure to UV-R. UVR-induced cis-UCA could not only contribute to induction
  of altered immune response but also indirectly change the microbial load, by affecting
  the microenvironment through yet unknown pathways. In addition, the microbiome can
  also induce complement and IL-1 set under stress by UV-R and together with directly
  induced microbial signals influence the skin immunity by induction of various cytokines
  such as that of Th17 pathway. Said so, keratinocyte effector function could be influenced
  by production of IL-17, leading in circle to altered AMP production, and release,
  in turn affecting the microbiome.
