caption: RNA methylation in T cell homeostasis. For naive T cell, SOCS family genes
  with m6A modification exhibit slower mRNA decay and increased protein expression
  levels. The increased SOCS family activity inhibits the IL-7/STAT5 signaling pathway
  and activates the TCR/ERK/AKT pathway, which lead to decreased T cell proliferation
  and differentiation. For Treg cell, reduction in m6A enhances the mRNA stability
  of SOCS genes and the proteins levels. The increased SOCS family activity blocks
  signal transduction of the IL2-STAT5 pathway, which lead to Treg cell suppression
  function lost. These two evidences shows that m6A modification plays an important
  role in maintaining T cell homeostasis.
