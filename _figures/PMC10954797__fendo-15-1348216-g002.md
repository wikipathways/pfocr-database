caption: Graphical representation of stress signal-mediated dysregulation of p53 expression
  during progression from colitis to cancer. Various endogenous or exogenous stress
  signals are detected, which are transmitted by proteins in different signaling pathways
  within the cell leading to activation or inhibition of p53. Inflammation and aging
  are associated with decreased expression and/or activity of p53 in cells or tissues,
  resulting in impairment or inactivation of the p53 pathway and stress response.
  DNA damage is associated with increased expression and/or activity of p53 due to
  extensive ROS stimulation in the tissue. LGD, Low-grade dysplasia; HGD, High-grade
  dysplasia; ARF, Alternate reading frame; ATM, Ataxia telangiectasia mutant; ATR,
