caption: Proteins interacting at the FSHR and their role in signaling. A number of
  proteins have been reported to interact with the FSHR and to impact on FSH-induced
  signaling pathways. These include 14-3-3τ, FoxO1, and APPL1, the latter two being
  involved in the control of the PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of the FSHR.
