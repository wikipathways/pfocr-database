caption: 'Overview of the basic metabolic pathways in C. acetobutylicum. The pathways
  are color coded as follows: catabolism of hydrocarbohydrates to pyruvate, purple;
  (incomplete) TCA cycle, brown; solventogenesis, blue; biosynthetic pathways, orange;
  urea cycle, forest green; nitrate and sulfate reduction and nitrogen fixation, black.
  Reactions for which no certain candidate enzyme was found are shown by dashed arrows.
  Phylogenetic affinities of genes of solventogenesis are shown by color: red for
  proteobacterial affinity; light green for Bacillus/Clostridium group; magenta for
  archaea. Genes with uncertain affinity are in blue. Different arrow shapes show
  that the respective genes are organized in operons. Numbers in the solventogenesis
  pathway correspond to the following enzymes: 1, phosphotransacetylase; 2, acetatekinase;
  3, thiolase; 4, beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; 5, crotonase; 6, butyryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; 7, phosphotransbutyrylase; 8, butyrate kinase; 9, acetoacetyl-CoA:acyl-CoA
  transferase; 10, butyraldehyde dehydrogenase; 11, butanol dehydrogenase; 12, acetoacetate
  decarboxylase; 13, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; 14, ethanol dehydrogenase; 15, pyruvate
  decarboxylase. Transporters are grouped by major categories, and the total number
  of transporters of each group is indicated in parentheses. The number of ABC transporters
  was estimated as the number of ABC-type ATPases. A more detailed breakdown of the
  transporters follows. ABC-type uptake transporters: nitrate, sulfate, phosphate,
  molybdate, ferrichrome, spermidine/putrescine, ribose, peptide, glycerol-3P (one
  of each); proline/glycine betaine, multidrug/protein/lipid (two paralogs of each);
  iron, cobalt (three paralogs); sugar, amino acid (five copies); oligopeptide (six
  copies). ABC-type efflux transporters: polysaccharide, Na+, (one of each), various
  specificities, homologous to eukaryotic P-glycoprotein (32 paralogs). P-type ATPases:
  K+, heavy metal (one of each), cation (three paralogs). Channels and pores: chloride,
  potassium (one of each). Electrochemical-driven transporters: formate/nitrite, ammonium,
  C4-dicarboxylate, proton/sodium-glutamate, transporter of cations and cationic drugs,
  2-oxoglutarate/malate translocator (one of each); Na+/H+ antiporter, gluconate/proton
  symporter (two paralogs), Mn2+/H+ transporter, NRAMP family, Na:galactoside symporter
  family, Co/Zn/Cd symporter (four paralogs), amino acid transporters (12 paralogs),
  sugar-proton symporter (30 paralogs). PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate-dependant phosphotransferase
  system): mannitol, fructose, cellobiose, fructose (mannose), galactitol/fructose,
  lactose, N-acetylglucosamine, arbutin (one of each); glucose, beta-glucosides (two
  paralogs). Incompletely characterized transporters: xanthine, uracil, arsenite efflux
  pump (one of each); magnesium and cobalt transporter ferrous iron transport FeoA/FeoB
  (two paralogs), O-antigen transporter family (six paralogs). Abbreviations: IISP,
  type II general secretory pathway; PRPP, phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate; 4Hfolate,
  tetrahydrofolate; APS, adenylylsulphate; PAPS, phosphoadenylylsulfate; MPS, methyl-accepting
  chemotaxis protein. Domain architectures of proteins involved in cellulose (A) and
  xylan degradation (B). Domain name abbreviations: D, dockerin; Ric, ricin; Cel,
  cellulose binding; SL, S layer; CAD, cell adhesion domain; GK, “Greek key” domain.
  Signal peptide is shown by an arrow. Gene identifiers of proteins with unique domain
  organizations are in red.'
