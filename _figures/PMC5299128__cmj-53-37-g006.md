caption: . Factors that direct sensory hair cell fate in the inner ear. Beginning
  at otic placode stages, FGF signaling regulates otic placode development as well
  as early stage of otocyst formation. A gradient of Wnt signaling determines the
  size of otic placode. Wnt pathway interacts with notch pathway. FGF signals are
  upstream activators of Atoh1 genes during the development of prosensory cells. Final
  sensory hair cell development is regulated by the expression of Atoh1. Supporting
  cell development is activated by the expression of notch pathway.
