caption: Ca2+-dependent secretory regulation pathway of TgMIC1/4/6. Most of Ca2+ in
  T. gondii are stored in the ER and produce a series of signaling cascades after
  stimulation. PIP2 generates IP3 and DAG through PLC, or NAD+ generates cADP-ribose
  through ADP ribosyl cyclase, and releases Ca2+ into the cytoplasm by the action
  of the Ca2+ channel on the ER membrane, which further converts DAG into phosphatidic
  acid (PA), and also activates CDPK1 to stimulate MICs secretion. Independently,
  activation of cGMP can activate PKG, which is also important for controlling MICs
  secretion. Other studies in the malaria parasite indicate that cGMP and PKG also
  indirectly control the synthesis of PIP2. On the other hand, SERCA pumps Ca2+ back
  into the lumen of the ER to restore the level of Ca2+ in the ER and cytoplasm.
