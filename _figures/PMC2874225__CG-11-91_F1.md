caption: The DSBR and SDSA meiotic recombination models. Single strands of DNA are
  shown as either green (parent 1) or yellow (parent 2) rods. The Spo11 complex initiates
  programmed DSBs. DSBs are resected 5’ to 3’ to produce single ssDNA tails. ssDNA
  tails invade the homologous template which is aided by the ssDNA filament forming
  proteins Dmc1 and Rad51. At this stage, intermediates can undergo DSBR (left), which
  is thought to produce primarily COs or SDSA (right), which only produces NCOs. Also
  shown is a pathway (center) describing aberrant JMs, that are hypothesized to either
  be resolved back to the strand invasion stage by Sgs1 or resolved as COs by the
  Mus81-Eme1 heterodimer []. In the DSBR pathway, strand invasion complexes are stabilized
  (possibly by ZMM proteins) to form SEIs. Prior to stabilization, Sgs1 could wire
  SEIs back to the strand invasion stage [, ]. The displaced strand, called a D-loop
  is captured by the resected break of opposite homolog and subsequent DNA synthesis
  results in a dHJ intermediate. This intermediate is resolved as a CO upon appropriate
  resolution of the two HJs. in the SDSA pathway, the invading strand dissociates
  after a patch of DNA synthesis. This strand then re-anneals to the original parent,
  resulting in repair of the DSB and a patch of heteroduplex DNA. This pathway is
  always resolved as a NCO, but it can result in GC.
