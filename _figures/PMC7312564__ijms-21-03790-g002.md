caption: Mechanisms regulating adipose stem cells expansion, including activation
  of target CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins and PPARγ through recruitment of transcription
  factors including activators of transcription CREB, GR and STAT5, resulting in change
  of conformation of active sites on target proteins. Activated target CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  proteins regulate PPARγ through Sth40 mediated inhibition of C/EBPβ, while PPARγ
  itself stimulates expansion of adipose stem cells, by SWELL1/LRCC8 mediated activation
  of SWELL1 mediated VRAC signaling pathway. (Created with BioRender).
