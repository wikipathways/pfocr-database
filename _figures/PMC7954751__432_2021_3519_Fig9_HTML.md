caption: Hormonal regulation of human DNA methyl transferases. Expression of DNMT
  isoformsin mammary gland in response to different hormones is shown. Estrogen (E2)
  upon binding to estrogen receptor either directly binds to estrogen response elements
  on DNA or via activating transcription factors such as AP1and STAT3. Growth factors,
  cytokines and chemokines activates ERK which in turn phosphorylates estrogen receptor
  independent of estrogen leading to aberrant DNMT isoforms expression. Progesterone
  binding to its receptor directly binds to DNA or activates ERK and subsequently
  activates transcription factors leading to decreased expression of DNMT isoforms.
  DNMT isoforms also showed to possess binding sites to glucocorticoid receptor and
  expression of mRNA is influenced by glucocorticoids. On the other hand, gonadotropins
  such as LH and FSH, prolactin, androgens, melatonin and cortisol shown to induce
  aberrant expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B when present, however, the pathway
  through which they act is unknow. Other hormones which significantly influence breast
  cancer growth, such as βhCG, oxytocin, Serotonin, T3, T4, TSH, PTH, Calcitonin,
  growth hormone, Catecholamines and insulin have not yet been shown whether or not
  they affect expression of DNMT isoforms. E2 estrogen, ER estrogen receptor, ERE
  estrogen response element, RE response element, Src steroid receptor coactivator,
  PI3K Phosphatidylionosiyol-3-kinase, TFs transcription factors, P4 progesterone,
  PR progesterone receptor, GC glucocorticoid, GR glucocorticoid receptor, GRE glucocorticoid
