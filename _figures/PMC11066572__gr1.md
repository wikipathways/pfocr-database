caption: Metabolic pathways targeted by anti-cryptosporidial drugs. Several drugs
  against Cryptosporidium exhibit inhibiting effects on nuclear- (in grey) as well
  as cytoplasmic-located biochemical processes. In this figure, a Cryptosporidium
  parasite is represented in its intracellular but extracytoplasmic host location
  within the parasitophorous vacuole. Molecule exchanges between host cell and the
  parasite take place through the electron dense connection. Surrounding the parasite,
  the purple text refers to the name of compounds inhibiting specific metabolic pathways.
  In the nucleus, the histone acetylation process (via histone deacetylase) as well
  as mRNA maturation (via polyadenylation specificity factor 3) are both inhibited
  by drugs. In the cytoplasm the glycolytic pathway (in orange) could be impeded by
  the action on three different enzymes (phosphoglucose isomerase, pyruvate kinase
  and lactate dehydrogenase). Regarding the fatty acids pathway (in yellow), inhibitors
  were identified as acting on acyl-CoA synthetase). Calcium regulated processes (in
  purple) were also described as target sites by the inhibition of calcium dependent
  kinases. In the phosphatidyl inositol phosphorylating process, the inhibition of
  a kinase (CpPi(4)K) exhibited a strong activity by reducing parasite growth (in
  Pink). In the mechanism linking amino acids (phenylalanyl, lysyl or methionyl))
  to their specific tRNA, actions of tRNA synthetases are also altered by therapeutic
  drugs (in blue). Finally, the guanosine synthesis pathway (in green) is inhibited
  by action on the inosine-5 monophosphate dehydrogenase. In red are the enzymes seen
  to be targeted by anticryptosporidial drugs. In order to make the figure readable,
  the glycolytic pathway has been reduced to the set of enzymes affected by anti-parasitic
  compounds. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
