caption: Schematic showing the effects of RBE on LPS-activated microglia. Stimulation
  of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 by LPS resulted in a phosphorylation and thus activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal cascade as well as NF-kB pathway.
  RBE exerted its beneficial effects by interfering in the activation of key kinases
  in MAPK signaling cascade but failed to affect NF-kB pathway. These effects of RBE
  were corroborated by reduction in the levels of COX-2/mPGES-1 and hence PGE2 production.
  RBE also imparted its anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (M1 markers; IL-1β and TNF-α) and by counterbalancing the levels of anti-inflammatory
  cytokine (M2 marker; IL-10) in microglia. Moreover, these beneficial effects of
  RBE are possibly due to, at least in part, by reduction in free radical formation
  (8-isoprostane) in microglia
