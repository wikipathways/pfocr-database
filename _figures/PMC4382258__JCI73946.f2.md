caption: Growth factor binding to IGFR and/or nutrient availability stimulates the
  TORC1 pathway, which in turn deactivates the pro-autophagic ULK1 complex and activates
  the autophagy inhibitory kinase S6K. Cellular energy resources are also detected
  by AMPK, which initiates pro-autophagic signaling when the AMP/ATP ratio rises.
  Recent data have underscored the importance of post-translational protein acetylation
  (Ac), which is controlled by HATs such as EP300, HDACs such as SIRT1, and levels
  of acetyl-CoA. In addition to epigenetic regulation via histone acetylation and
  methylation, transcription factors such as FOXO3A or TFEB also influence transcription
  of pro-autophagic genes (e.g., ATGs).
