caption: Model of cortical microtubule organization regulated by membrane-associated
  proteins and lipids in response to plant hormones and stress. Activation of PLDα1
  by salt stress leads to production of PA, which binds to MAP65-1 and MPK6 to regulate
  microtubule organization and the SOS pathway, respectively. PA also binds to AtCP
  to modulate actin filaments. The PtdInsPs-binding proteins, MAP18 and MDP25, negatively
  regulate cytoskeletal organization. Plasma membrane-localized TMK1 interacts with
  ABP1 and transduces auxin signals to activate plasma membrane-associated ROPs leading
  to changes in the cytoskeleton and the shape of leaf pavement cells. Locally activated
  ROP11 recruits MIDD1 to plasma membrane domains. MIDD1 links plasma membrane, cortical
  microtubules, and Kin13A. CLASP regulates levels of the auxin efflux carrier PIN2
  by tethering SNX1 endosomes to cortical microtubules, which fine tunes auxin maxima
  in the root apical meristem. In the absence of GA, DELLA retains PFD in the nucleus,
  and in the presence of GA, DELLA proteins are degraded, which allows PFD to move
  to the cytoplasm leading to increased production of tubulin dimers. WDL5 and MDP40
  act as important mediators in regulating microtubule organization in response to
  ETH and BR signals, respectively. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MTs, microtubules;
  AFs, actin filaments
