caption: Schematic diagram integrating major components of ABA biosynthesis, signaling,
  and catabolism during the establishment of bud endodormancy. Solid and dashed lines
  indicate direct and indirect regulation; respectively. Arrowed blue and barred red
  lines indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Upward and downward arrows
  indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively. Blue and yellow arrows indicate
  cold- and SD-mediated activation, respectively, whereas the black arrow indicates
  an undetermined signal source. Question marks indicate the unconfirmed mechanisms.
  Towards the end of the growing season, SD photoperiod and short-term low temperature
  activate both ABA biosynthesis and signaling, possibly via kinase cascades. As a
  result, the key components in ABA biosynthesis and signaling such as ZEP, NCED,
  PYR/PYL/RCAR, and PP2C are upregulated, whereas ABA catabolism through hydroxylation
  or conjugation is downregulated. High ABA levels activate DAM and SVP/SVL transcription
  factors through repressing PKL. DAM promotes ABA synthesis by binding to the CArG
  motif of the NCED promoter, whereas SVL enhances ABA signaling by upregulating ABA
  receptor RCAR/PLY. The positive feedback loop between ABA and DAM/SVL can be balanced
  by the ABA signaling component ABRE, which represses the activity of DAM by binding
  to the three ABRE motifs in its promoter region. SVL can induce the expression of
  CALS1 and FT by binding to their promoters. The ABA signaling pathway can also upregulate
  CALS1, which in turn produces callose at the plasmodesmata to block the intercellular
  communication, contributing to the establishment of endodormancy. Activated ABA
  responses, repressed FT, and callose deposition all lead to the establishment of
  endodormancy. ABA, abscisic acid; FT, flowering locus T; SD, short day; ZEP, zeaxanthin
  epoxidase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; PYR, regulatory pyrabactin resistance;
  PYL, pyrabactin like; RCAR, components of ABA receptors 1; PP2C, protein phosphate
  2C; DAM, dormancy-associated MADS; SVP, short vegetative phase; SVL, SVP-like
