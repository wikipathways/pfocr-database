caption: 'Metabolic adaptations of cancer cells. Glucose and glutamine are the 2 major
  substrates used by cancer cells. Glucose is imported into the cells through glucose
  transporters (GLUT) where it is phosphorylated by Hexokinase (HK). It will then
  be either metabolized through glycolysis or diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). Glucose-derived pyruvate is mainly converted into lactate in cancer cells
  instead of being imported into mitochondria to be oxidized in acetyl CoA to support
  mitochondrial energy production. MYC enables cancer cells to maximize glutamine
  uptake from the extracellular space through the upregulation of the glutamine transporter.
  Once glutamine enters the cell, it can be metabolized through glutaminolysis to
  provide glutamate. The transamination of glutamate to αKG will feed the TCA cycle
  (adapted from Vander-Heiden et al. []). αKG: α-KetoGlutarate; TCA: tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; PDK: PDH-kinase;
  PK: pyruvate kinase; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; GLS: glutamine synthase; SDH: succinate
  dehydrogenase; FH: fumarate hydratase; 2-HG: 2D-hydroxyGlutarate; IDH: isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; HK: hexokinase; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.'
