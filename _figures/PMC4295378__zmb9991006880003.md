caption: Effects of the WNT signaling network on cancer cell metabolism. Active WNT
  signaling is linked to alterations in cancer cell metabolism. Transcriptional changes
  induced through WNT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin can reprogram cancer cell
  metabolism, largely by increasing aerobic glycolysis. The pathway can be inhibited
  by AMPK at the level of DVL activity. β-Catenin–TCF/LEF gene transcription can increase
  enzymes that promote glycolysis (for example, PDK1, which inhibits pyruvate flux
  through the TCA cycle) or can increase c-Myc expression. c-Myc induces the transcription
  of genes for glycolysis enzymes and proteins involved in glutamine catabolism (the
  latter is not shown). ROS production from the mitochondrial respiratory chain can
  alter β-catenin fidelity for TCF/LEF and promote binding to FOXO transcription factors.
  FOXO gene transcription activates genes that combat oxidative stress and therefore
  promote cell survival. Noncanonical WNT signaling can induce Akt-mTOR activity in
  cancer cells by a currently undefined mechanism. Stabilization of mTORC1 promotes
  aerobic glycolysis through a variety of mechanisms, including induction of HIF-1α-mediated
  transcription of the PKM2 gene (not shown). Cross talk between the WNT/β-catenin
  and WNT/Akt-mTOR pathways occurs where Akt can inhibit GSK3β, which otherwise, in
  conjunction with AMPK, could destabilize mTORC1 expression by promoting TSC1/2 activity.
  This again promotes aerobic glycolysis by stabilizing the expression of both mTORC1
  and β-catenin. A question mark indicates that the precise molecular mechanism remains
  unknown. See the text for additional details.
