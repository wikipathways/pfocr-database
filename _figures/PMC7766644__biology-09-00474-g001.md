caption: Simplified diagram of changes in lipid metabolism of cancer cells (see text
  for details) (A) De novo lipogenesis Glucose- and glutamine-derived citrate, which
  results from the increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis, is first converted to
  acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Acetyl-CoA can also
  be derived from acetate. Acetyl-CoA is then carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) and condensed by fatty acid (FA) synthase (FAS) in a repeat reaction
  to generate saturated FAs (SFAs) then desaturated by stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCD1)
  into unsaturated FAs (UFAs). Synthesis of glycerolipids from long-chain FAs involved
  the enzymes 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (AGPAT) and lipin which
  are deregulated in resistant cancers. These lipids can be used for storage in lipid
  droplets, membrane biosynthesis, and signaling processes. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA
  can enter the mevalonate pathway to generate cholesterol. Key regulatory proteins
  dysregulated in resistant cancers are HMG-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR), farnesyl prenyl
  transferase (FPTase) and geranylgeranyl prenyl transferase (GGPTase) (B) Lipolysis.
  FAs generated through the metabolism of triglycerides from lipid droplets (de novo
  synthesis) and from exogenous uptake constitute the pool of intracellular FAs that
  undergo fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Activation of FAs into acyl-CoA is catalyzed
  by Acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (ACS), then converted into FA carnitines by
  carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) and broken down by mitochondrial β-oxidation
  (Box). Alternatively, peroxisomal β-oxidation catalyze the chain shortening of Acyl-CoA.
  FAO generates ATP production and participates to ROS scavenging through NADPH-producing
  reactions. Dysregulated enzymes altered in treatment-resistant cancer are indicated
  with an * (see text for details).
