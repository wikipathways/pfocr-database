caption: 'A schematic diagram illustrating the interaction between neuroinflammation
  and microglial activation, as well as a separate schematic diagram depicting the
  TREM2 signaling pathway. (A): The interaction between neuroinflammation and microglial
  activation; (B) TREM2 signaling pathway. TREM downstream signaling regulation is
  contingent upon the activity status of DAP10 and DAP12. Following the binding of
  TREM2 to its ligand, the co-receptor molecule undergoes phosphorylation and subsequently
  recruits intracellular signal transduction molecules (DAP12 associates with Syk,
  while DAP10 associates with PI3K); Syk: spleen tyrosine kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase). Some cartoon components were from www.figdraw.com for model drawing'
