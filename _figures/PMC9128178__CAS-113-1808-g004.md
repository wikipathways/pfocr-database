caption: Newly detected circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) alterations at disease progression
  linked to resistance. Arrows indicate the direction of pathway cascades leading
  to cell cycle checkpoint regulation. “Acquired variants” were ctDNA that were undetected
  within the first cycle of cyclin‐dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor treatment
  (single nucleotide variant [SNV] count = 0 or copy number variant [CNV] = 2.0‐fold)
  and detected at disease progression (SNV ≥0.2% or CNV ≥2.5‐fold). Variant allele
  frequencies (VAF) or copy numbers of paired pretreatment and progressive disease
  (PD) time points are listed in the colored boxes directly below the detected variants
