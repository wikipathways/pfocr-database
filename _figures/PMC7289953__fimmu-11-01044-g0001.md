caption: Mechanisms underlying experimental liver transplant tolerance. Hepatic immune
  and parenchymal cells interact with each other to generate a tolerogenic microenvironment.
  Liver dendritic cells (DC) express low levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
  co-stimulatory molecules, but high levels of PDL1, weakly stimulate T cell responses,
  and promote regulatory CD4+ T cells (CD4 Treg) induction through TGF-β. Liver DC
  release high levels of IL-10, but low bioactive IL-12. Liver DC prevent T cell priming
  of orally-administered Ag through anergy or deletion of circulating T cells. Graft-infiltrating,
  cross-dressed DC over-express PDL1 and subvert anti-donor T cell proliferation to
  promote liver graft tolerance. The DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) negatively
  regulates liver DC IL-12 production, but positively regulates liver DC IL-10 production
  and T cell allostimulatory capability. Kupffer cells can release IFN-γ-stimulated
  nitric oxide (NO) to inhibit T cell proliferation and produce IL-10 and TGF-β to
  promote tolerance. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) present circulating
  exogenous antigens to T cells, resulting in Ag-specific T cell tolerance. LSEC and
  hepatic stellate cells (HSC) induce T cell apoptosis through PDL1/PD1 pathway interactions.
  The mechanism of hepatocyte-induced T cell death occurs through a type of apoptosis
  known as passive cell death (PCD). Exosomes derived from hepatocytes may also be
  critical to a tolerogenic phenotype. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) suppress T
  cell proliferation and differentiation through cell-cell contact that is mediated
  by PDL1.
