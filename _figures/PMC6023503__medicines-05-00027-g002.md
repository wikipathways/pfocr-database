caption: IPA pathway analysis, in which specific genes emerged throughout our review,
  are shown in purple. As can be seen, GNB3 enhances APP (Amyloid precursor protein)
  expression, which has been suggested to have growth promoting properties and a role
  in neuron plasticity. APP is linked with the expression of TGFB1, which encodes
  a protein that regulates various cell activities including proliferation, differentiation,
  motility of cells, and apoptosis. TGFB1 is possibly related to an increase in the
  expression of TH, which is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine
  []. Tyrosine hydroxylase is a crucial enzyme for converting tyrosine to DOPA in
  the pathway of the catecholamine biosynthesis. Diurnal expression of TH is mirrored
  by the diurnal availability of dopamine in the central nervous system. The protein
  product of the CLOCK gene is a transcription factor with a crucial role in circadian
  rhythm regulation, which is suggested to be positively linked to the expression
  of another transcription factor, the protein of the NF-kB gene. The latter also
  exhibits a central role in circadian and immune mechanisms.
