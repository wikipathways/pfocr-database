caption: Constitutive activation of Ras or MAPK signaling is seen in prostate cancer
  (1) and this leads to phosphorylation of RXRα (2) as well as reduced VDR protein
  levels (3) in prostate epithelial cells. Reduced VDR levels may account for the
  delayed binding of VDR to DNA seen in the ChIP assay (4). Co-immunoprecipitation
  assays and two-hybrid assay reveal that vitamin D-independent binding of the essential
  co-activator SRC-1 to RXRα is reduced (5). Although recruitment of the mediator
  complex is critical for vitamin D regulated gene expression, it is not clear whether
  MAPK activation-mediated RXRα phosphorylation influences this step. The cumulative
  effect of the changes outlined is a reduction in 1,25(OH)2D3-regulated gene transcription
  in transformed prostate epithelial cells (6).
