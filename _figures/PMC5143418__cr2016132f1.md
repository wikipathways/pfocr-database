caption: TAMs control the switch of immunostimulation and immunosuppression by PI3Kγ.
  Tumor cells secrete regulatory molecules to reprogram TAMs to a tumor-promoting
  phenotype. TAMs integrate these signals through PI3Kγ, which switches on the transcriptional
  activity of C/EBP while switching off that of NF-κB. Each of the transcription factors
  regulates a program that respectively inhibits or promotes the immunosurveilance
  by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Targeting PI3Kγ signaling by genetic ablation
  (scissors) or kinase inhibitors (KIs) tilt the balance of the immune microenvironment
  to enhance CTL activities and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor cells,
  TAMs and other stromal cells can inhibit CTLs via the PD1 pathway. Simultaneous
  targeting of the two pathways has a further elevated effect on the treatment of
  cancer in mouse models.
