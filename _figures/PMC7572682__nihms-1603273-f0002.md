caption: For the nucleus-to-lysosome interaction, the lysosomal-autophagic pathway
  is transcriptionally regulated responding to the nutrient status. Upon starvation,
  transcription factors, TFEB/TFE3 (shown as TFEB), FOXO3, CREB-CRTC2 PPARα, and p53
  bind to the promoter region of lysosomal-autophagic genes and activate their expression.
  Meanwhile, ZKSCAN3 represses the expression of lysosomal-autophagic genes, so does
  FXR through competing with PPARα and dissociating the CREB-CRTC2 complex in well-fed
  conditions. For the lysosome-to-nucleus interaction, starvation can induce the nuclear
  translocation of fatty acid binding protein LBP-8 that binds oleoylethanolamine
  (OEA) and deliver it to the nuclear hormone receptor complex NHR-49-NHR-80 to induce
  mitochondrial metabolic genes. In contrast, nutrient repletion results in lysosomal
  docking of mTORC1 that phosphorylates TFEB/TFE3. The binding of phosphorylated TFEB/TFE3
  with cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins prevents its nuclear translocation.
