caption: 'Effects of APX3330 treatment on enteric neurons and GI functions. In the
  inflamed colon, high levels of colonic leukocyte infiltration and fecal Lcn-2 were
  alleviated by APX3330 treatment. Chronic intestinal inflammation associates with
  the damage to the enteric nervous system embedded within the intestinal wall and
  controls gastrointestinal (GI) functions. In enteric neurons, APX3330 treatment
  APX3330 reduces oxidative stress via inhibition of APE1/Ref-1’s redox signaling,
  mitochondrial superoxide production, and oxidative DNA damage. However, suppressing
  APE1/Ref-1 redox activity enhances APE1/Ref-1’s endonuclease repair activity. DNA
  damage induces translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Acetylated
  cytosolic HMGB1 released from cells into extracellular space interacts with immune
  cells and stimulates production of cytokines and chemokines leading to neuroinflammation,
  hyperexcitability, and neuronal death (dashed line: not studied in our model). After
  APX3330 treatment, HMGB1 was retained in the nuclei of myenteric neurons. Targeting
  this pathway with APX3330 ameliorated enteric neuropathy, ameliorated colonic dysmotility,
  and altered GI transit leading to improved clinical signs associated with chronic
  colitis (created with BioRender.com).'
