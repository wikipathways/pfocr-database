caption: Proposed mechanisms of action by which EA ameliorated morphine-induced tolerance
  in mice. Chronic morphine increased the levels of cAMP, and the levels of phosphorylation
  levels of protein kinase A (PKA), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)
  and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) in morphine-induced tolerance. After the
  treatment of Electro-Acupuncture, the increased of cAMP, p-PKA C, p-ERK, and p-CREB
  were significantly decreased in morphine-induce tolerance. Simultaneously, RNA sequencing
  reval the underlying molecular targets of EA treatment on morphine-induced tolerance
  maybe KO04080 (Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction) and KO04668 (TNF signaling
  pathway).
