caption: Integrin and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways were the top two pathways
  associated with cell-to-cell signaling. Each node represents a protein; the proteins
  in shaded nodes in the pathway are identified/relate to an identified protein in
  the proteomic analysis. While proteins in clear nodes are part of the pathway but
  have not been identified in the GV oocyte or cumulus datasets. Proteins in red nodes
  were shown higher expression in cumulus cells compared to GV oocyte.
