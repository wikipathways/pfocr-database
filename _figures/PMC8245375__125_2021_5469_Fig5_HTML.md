caption: The activation and the feedback loop of the innate antiviral immune system
  during a viral infection. The RNA dysregulated genes/proteins where SNPs were also
  found in the GWAS study are highlighted in red. Genes/proteins that were only dysregulated
  at the RNA level are highlighted in green. SP1 is highlighted in yellow because
  we only found SNPs in this gene associated with type 1 diabetes. The figure illustrates
  the multitude of genes involved in the potential overactivation in response to an
  infection in type 1 diabetes. LPS, lipopolysaccharide
