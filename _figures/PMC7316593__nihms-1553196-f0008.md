caption: RSV infected airway epithelial cells (AECs) trigger the production of uric
  acid, IL-33, TSLP, and CCL2. AECs and macrophages increase the expression of innate
  cytokines when uric acid is upregulated. CCL2 can recruit monocytes, APC, and T
  cells to the lung, while IL-33 along with TSLP and IL-1β will recruit and activate
  ILC2.

  Th2 immune responses via innate cytokine production and ILC2 accumulation.
