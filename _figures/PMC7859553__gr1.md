caption: Notch signaling overview. This figure summarizes the signal transduction
  pathway of Notch. (1) Furin cleaves the precursor receptor in the golgi apparatus
  and the NECD heterodimerizes with the NICD. (2) NECD is glycosylated. (3) Notch
  ligands attached to the same cell are able to inhibit (cis-inhibition) Notch receptors.
  (4) Notch ligands on adjacent cells activate (trans-activation) the Notch heterodimer.
  (5) NECD is trans-endocytosed by the ligand cell. (6) S2 site exposed on the NRR
  region is cleaved by ADAMs proteins. (7) NICD is freed from the cell membrane through
  S3 cleavage by Sec. (8) NICD translocates to the nucleus where it forms a transcriptional
  regulatory complex with Rbpj and Maml. (9) NICD is ubiquinated and degraded reverting
  the complex to state of repression.
