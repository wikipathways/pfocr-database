caption: Flow-mediated dilation pathway with mitochondrial contributions and effects
  of aging and ROS/RNS. 1. Flow-induced shear stress activates mechanosensitive endothelial
  TRPV4 channels, allowing for calcium entry, which activates basal membrane SKCa
  and IKCa, causing potassium efflux and hyperpolarization that along with calcium
  can spread to the VSM cell via connexin 40 gap junctions. Potassium in the intercellular
  space activates the Na+/K+-ATPase and KIR, causing smooth muscle hyperpolarization.
  Hyperpolarization is amplified by contributions from BKCa, KV, and KATP. Taken together,
  the hyperpolarization signal inhibits the VGCC from transporting calcium into the
  cell, reducing intracellular calcium and inducing vasodilation. In youth, the initial
  calcium signal activates eNOS to produce nitric oxide, which causes VSM cell relaxation
  via production of cGMP, activation of potassium channels, and stimulation of cGMP-dependent
  protein kinases that activate myosin light chain kinase phosphatase. In aging, eNOS
  is downregulated and dysfunctional and instead shear stress induces production of
  hydrogen peroxide that activates potassium channels to induce hyperpolarization-mediated
  vasodilation. 2. RBCs contribute to hypoxic vasodilatory response by production
  of nitric oxide from RBC-NOS and ATP traversal through pannexin 1 to activate endothelial
  purinergic (P2y) receptors, increasing intracellular calcium and activation of eNOS
  to produce nitric oxide. In aging, reduced deformability of RBCs leads to reduced
  contribution of this pathway toward vasodilation. 3. Mitochondrial depolarization
  caused by activation of mitochondrial KATP channels induces ROS mediated alterations
  of ryanodine receptors on the nearby endoplasmic reticulum, which leads to the release
  of calcium sparks. Calcium sparks activate the BKCa channel, causing hyperpolarization,
  inhibition of VGCC, reduced intracellular calcium, and vasodilation. Overall, sedentary
  aging and oxidative stress reduce FMD efficacy. BKCa, calcium-dependent large conductance
