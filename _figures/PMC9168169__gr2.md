caption: 'RNA-RBPs Interaction in Diabetes. Here, we summarized the main mechanisms
  on RNA-RBPs interaction in diabetes. HuR impairs circPPM1F translation, which promoted
  LPS-induced M1 macrophage activation via NF-κB signaling enhancement, thus exacerbating
  pancreas damage. Also, HuR interacts with the GLUT1 mRNA, potentially mediating
  post-transcriptional dysregulation and GLUT1-related metabolic disturbance in diabetes.
  Additionally, HuR might target IL-6 mRNA and enhances its stabilization, which promotes
  the development of inflammation in diabetes. TTP could inhibit NLRP3 expression
  in human macrophages by targeting the NLRP3 3′-untranslated region, which might
  influence the development of diabetes. Mfn2 play a critical role in diabetes through
  promoting glucose oxidation and insulin sensitivity. RBP HuD increased Mfn2 expression
  by binding to Mfn2 mRNA. Therefore, downregulation of HuD in diabetes contributes
  to impaired mitochondrial function, resulting in pancreatic β cell dysfunction.
  Also, downregulation of HuD accelerates the triglycerides production in pancreatic
  β cells by decreasing INSIG1 expression at the post-transcriptional level, thus
  enhancing nuclear translocation of the critical lipogenesis factor SREBP1c. In addition,
  HuD represses insulin translation through binding to the insulin mRNA and influences
  autophagosome formation in pancreatic β cells by promoting ATG5. CUGBP1 stabilizes
  the PDE3B mRNA, a phosphodiesterase that regulates cAMP hydrolysis, to reduce intracellular
  cAMP levels and impair GSIS. The depletion of SRp55 leads to β-cell apoptosis and
  impaired insulin secretion via regulating alternative splicing of multiple transcripts
  involved in insulin secretion and ER stress. IMP2 makes Pdx1 polypeptides stabilization
  via IGF2-AKT-GSK3β-PDX1 signaling pathway. mTOR phosphorylates IGF2BP2 and facilitates
  its binding to IGF-2 mRNA, thus enhancing IGF-2 expression. RBP hnRNPK targets the
  JUND mRNA in β cells with the bind of RNA helicase DDX3X, thus promoting β cell
  failure in T2D. RBPs: RNA binding proteins, HuR: human antigen R, circPPM1F: circular
