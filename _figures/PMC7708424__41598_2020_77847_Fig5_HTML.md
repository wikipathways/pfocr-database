caption: 'An example of where Pascal pathway enrichment and HotNet2 home in on the
  same pathway causal of Hyperlipidaemia. The Hotnet2 module (black interactions)
  was detected using HCGHs (red) from a Hyperlipidaemia GWAS and the OmniPath network.
  This module is enriched for 3 successful drug targets (bold node border), one of
  which, PCSK9, was not categorised as a HCGH in the input. The Pascal enriched pathway
  (red interactions) is the lipoprotein metabolism pathway from Metabase. Genes that
  have a significant Pascal gene score are highlighted in yellow: it can also be seen
  that an additional novel drug target was recovered (MTTP) using this method that
  did not have any type of genetic evidence associated with it.'
