caption: Model of ALDHHIGH cells regulatory mechanisms in cervical cancer cells. ALDHHIIGH
  cells are present in low percentage in monolayer culture. However, extracellular
  stimuli perform the enrichment of ALDHHIGH cells during spheres formation, possibly
  through RTK like receptors able to promote PI3K/AKT pathway, given the low percentage
  of Fzd+ cells and that blocking effect of AZD-5363 over AKT maintained ALDHHIGH
  cells at low percentage. Thereupon, AKT kinase leads GSK3-β phosphorylation at Ser9
  residue to inactivate it. The inactive form of GSK3-β triggers β-catenin stability
  and once β-catenin levels are elevated into the cell promotes β-catenin translocation
  to the nucleus to mediate target genes expression including ALDH genes, according
  to previous reports (). The ALDH levels elicit a major percent of cells characterized
  by high activity of ALDH. Figures were created with biorender.com.
