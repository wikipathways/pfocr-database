caption: CpgA is pivotal in prevention of 4PE-mediated metabolic gridlock. PtsG functions
  as a glucose PTS importer (EIIGlc class) working with HPr (Histidine protein), EI
  (Enzyme I), and PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) to import glucose (yellow hexagons). Other
  enzymes and proteins mentioned in the text are shown. Metabolites of glycolysis
  are depicted in black (enzymes in red), and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates
  are depicted in green (enzymes in blue). Highlighted arrows illustrate the accidental
  metabolite 4PE arising from the promiscuous reaction of GapA with erythrose-4-phosphate
  to generate 4-P-erythronate (4PE), which inhibits GndA/GntZ. CpgA or yeast Pho13
  (depicted as purple protein) convert 4PE to erythronate. Inhibition of GndA/GntZ
  causes accumulation of 6-phosphogluconate which further blocks phosphoglucose isomerase
  (PGI) leading to a metabolic gridlock in core pathways. A green circle with check
  mark indicates carbon sources that support growth of the cpgA null mutant, and those
  carbon sources that lead to intoxication are shown as red circles with cross marks
