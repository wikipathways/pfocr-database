caption: Developmental signaling pathway architectures sense, process and control
  ligands in space and time. (A) Major developmental signaling pathways use diverse
  architectures to control cell-cell communication. In these pathways, ligand-receptor
  interactions activate intracellular effectors, which then regulate target gene expression.
  Intracellular signaling activity also induces a myriad of feedback loops to further
  modulate the signal processing capability of the pathway. TF, transcription factor.
  (B) At the single cell level, pathways can sense the molecular identity and concentration
  of individual ligands, the relative concentrations of multiple ligands (combinations)
  or the temporal dynamics of ligand concentrations. (C) At the tissue level, signaling
  pathways can actively modulate the distribution of extracellular ligands and intracellular
  signal perception in space and time. This spatio-temporal control occurs through
  direct ligand-receptor interactions, secreted inhibitors or modulators, and feedback
  loops (arrows inside each cell). The ruler and clock represent the spatial and temporal
  scales of signaling activity in morphogen gradients. Understanding the relationships
  between pathway architecture (A) and signal processing (B,C) is a fundamental challenge.
