caption: Koh et al. find that expression of mutationally activated BRAFV600E in neural
  stem cells during early brain development results in dysplastic, non-neoplastic,
  epileptogenic neurons. By contrast, BRAFV600E expression in cells that develop along
  the glial differentiation pathway results in neoplastic but nonepileptogenic cells.
  BRAFV600E-driven GG-associated LEAT seizures are driven by constitutive BRAFV600E→
  MEK→ ERK signaling that drives expression of c-MYC that in turn promotes elevated
  expression of REST. Elevated REST expression leads to transcriptional repression
  of mRNAs associated with neuronal function resulting in the development of intractable
  epileptic seizures.
