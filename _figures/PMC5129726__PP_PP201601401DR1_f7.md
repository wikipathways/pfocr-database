caption: Model explaining the DEK1 pathway regulating cell wall composition. DEK1
  is proposed to respond to an external signal that initiates autolytic cleavage of
  the CALPAIN domain. The CALPAIN domain cleaves unknown, likely cytoplasmic, target
  proteins that act in signaling pathways to promote the expression of cell wall-related
  genes, including LTPs, XTHs, CGR2, GAUTs, and GALS2, as well as GA2OX8. Proteins
  encoded by these genes act to remodel the cell wall, for example, acting on xyloglucans
  and pectins. This leads to maintenance of the integrity of the cell wall, adhesion
  between cells, and regulated cell expansion.
