caption: 'We incorporated three major pathways: Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein
  kinase IV (CaMKIV), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Protein Phosphatase
  1 (PP1). Each of these converged on CREB activation. We also modeled further interactions
  with Transducer of regulated CREB activity 1 (TORC1) and the protein kinase A (PKA)
  pathway. The inputs to the model were BDNF and Ca2+ waveforms configured to represent
  LTP- and LTD- inducing stimuli.'
