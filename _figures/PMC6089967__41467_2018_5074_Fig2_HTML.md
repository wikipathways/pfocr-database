caption: Gene network of the susceptibility pathways/GO terms. Each node is a gene,
  which was the selected gene in our GWAS pathway analysis and is shown in Supplementary
  Data . The connecting lines are drawn if the two genes have a relationship such
  as co-expression, shared protein domain, physical interactions, co-localization,
  or pathway. The thickness of the lines represents the degree of similarity between
  two genes. Gene network is produced using GeneMANIA. a The network of KEGG neuroactive
  ligand receptor interaction pathway consists of 23 genes and only TRPV1 in the associated
  gene list identified by our GWAS enrichment was shown no direct relationship with
  other associated genes. b The network of gated channel activity GO term consists
  all of 22 genes identified by our GWAS enrichment. c The network of ion channel
  activity GO term consists all of 24 genes identified by our GWAS enrichment. d The
  network of cation channel activity GO term consists all of 22 genes identified by
  our GWAS enrichment. e The network of substrate-specific channel activity GO term
  consists all of 24 genes identified by our GWAS enrichment. f The network of cation
  transmembrane transporter activity GO term consists 29 and only SLC4A4 in the associated
  gene list genes identified by our GWAS enrichment was shown no direct relationship
  with other associated genes
