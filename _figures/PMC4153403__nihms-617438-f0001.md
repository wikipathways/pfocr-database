caption: (A) XBP1 is the Missing Link between the UPR and O-GlcNAcylation. The contributions
  made by Wang et al are shown in blue. (B) Proteins are glycosylated in different
  cell compartments. (C) A key substrate for O-GlcNAcylation, which is used by the
  enzyme OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase), is UDP-GlcNAc (uridine diphosphate N-acetyl glucosamine).
  (D) UDP-GlcNAc is generated by the hexose biosynthetic pathway (HBP). O-GlcNAc groups
  can be removed from proteins by OGA (O-GlcNAcase). The contributions made by Wang
  et al are shown in blue.
