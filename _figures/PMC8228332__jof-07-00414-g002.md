  KEGG pathway. Enzymes involved in the regulation of osmolyte concentration and depicted
  with the color grey: trehalose pathway; green: mannitol; blue: glycerol; purple:
  erythritol, and red: arabitol were evaluated by qPCR. The enzymes depicted in light
  orange were not evaluated. TPSA (Trehalose phosphate synthase), STPS (Heat shock
