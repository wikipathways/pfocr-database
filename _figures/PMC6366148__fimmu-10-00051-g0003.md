caption: Different signaling pathways are activated by different stimuli. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  and AMPK pathways act in contrasting fashion in metabolism and immunity. Several
  factors like IL-2 and CD28 signaling and growth factors activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, resulting in survival, and proliferation of different cells. Naïve T cells
  use lipid β-oxidation to supply their low demands, but after activation, these cells
  generate a large amount of energy using glycolysis, through changing their metabolic
  machinery.
