caption: Hypoxia stimulates TGF-β activity and downstream Fbln5 expression in PDA.
  We propose a model in which hypoxia stimulates TGF-β signaling and induces Fbln5
  expression via a PI3K/AKT-dependent mechanism in fibroblasts. We stimulated hypoxia
  in vitro by incubating cells in a hypoxic chamber or through chemically stabilizing
  Hif-1α with CoCl2, which enhanced Fbln5 expression. Anti-VEGF therapy by mcr84 augmented
  hypoxia in PDA tumors, which also increased Fbln5 levels. Blocking TGF-β signaling
  in vitro (LY2152799 and SB431542) and in vivo (LY2152799 and 2G8) reduced Fbln5
  expression. Moreover, hypoxia-induced Fbln5 requires TGF-β activity, as inhibition
  of TGFβ-R1 under hypoxic conditions also mitigated Fbln5 expression. Finally, inhibition
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway (LY294002, AKT1/2 KI, and BKM120) blocked hypoxia- and TGF-β-induced
  Fbln5 expression. As reported previously (), the expression of functional Fbln5
  in genetically engineered mouse models of PDA results in increased tumor growth
  and decreased survival.
