caption: Hypothetical trafficking pattern of dually acylated proteins. Hypothetical
  pathway for an exemplar dually acylated myristoylated/palmitoylated trypanosomatid
  protein, calflagin/FCaBP, based in part on data in [] and []. (1) Newly-synthesized
  protein (blue) is myristoylated by NMT and (2) associates with vesicles in the Golgi,
  perhaps having a distinct lipid composition specifying flagellar pocket (FP) targeting.
  (3) The vesicles traffick to and fuse with the flagellar pocket. (4) If the protein
  is not palmitoylated by PAT (orange, shown here in the FP), it trafficks to the
  pellicular membrane. (5) If the protein is palmitoylated, it has two possible fates,
  depending on whether it also possesses a polybasic region (KKKK). (6) If KKKK is
  present, the protein enters the flagellar compartment and associates with the flagellar
  membrane. (7) If KKKK is absent, it continues onto the pellicular membrane. This
  is only one model for trafficking of one protein. Additional known and possible
  factors specifying trafficking of acylated proteins include protein-protein interactions,
  the specific lipid chemistry of distinct membrane domains, such as the flagellar
  membrane [], and the location of the specific PAT.
