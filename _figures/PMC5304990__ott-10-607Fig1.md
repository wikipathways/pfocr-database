caption: 'Schematic view of FLT3 and FLT3-ITD signaling.Notes: FLT3 and FLT3-ITD receptors
  are expressed at the cell Mb. Their EC part is composed of five immunoglobulin-like
  domains that bind the FLT3-L. Their IC portion contains the TKD that supports the
  enzymatic activity of these receptors. FLT3 receptors are activated upon FLT3-L
  binding and, while remaining sensitive to FLT3-L, FLT3-ITD receptors are capable
  of activating downstream signaling pathways after FLT3-L-independent homodimerization.
  From the cell Mb receptors, several signaling pathways may be activated including
  the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT (the most studied). In contrast to FLT3 receptors,
  FLT3-ITD proteins may be found in the ER due to alteration of their glycosylation.
  Aberrant signaling from the ER activates STAT5 transcription factors that translocate
  into the nucleus (N) and subsequently activate a transcriptional program leading
  to the accumulation of oncogenic proteins such as Pim kinases, Bcl-xL, or CD1. Signaling
  pathway activation from both Mb and ER contribute to cell proliferation and survival
  as well as to a differentiation block that contributes to AML propagation.Abbreviations:
  Mb, membrane; EC, extracellular; FLT3-L, FLT3 ligand; IC, intracellular; TKD, tyrosine
  kinase domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CD1, cyclin D1; AML, acute myeloid leukemia;
  Pim, proviral integration site.'
