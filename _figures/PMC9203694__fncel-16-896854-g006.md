caption: Schematic representation of MORC2 as a key regulator of lipogenesis (left
  side) and glycolysis (right side) pathway. Adipogenic signals increase MORC2 protein
  levels facilitating the interaction between MORC2 and ACLY in the cytosol, and leading
  to the activation of ACLY by preventing its dephosphorylation. This activated ACLY
  is essential for increased fatty acid synthesis. High glucose concentration in the
  culture medium stimulates the induction of MORC2 expression. Once, MORC2 is induced,
  it forms a complex with c-myc and gets recruited to LDHA promoter to induce LDHA
  expression, which in turn facilitates glycolysis.
