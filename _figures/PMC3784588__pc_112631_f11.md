caption: Model for Jasmonate-Regulated Cold Signaling Pathway in Arabidopsis.Under
  normal growth conditions, JAZ repressors interact with ICE transcription factors.
  The physical interactions attenuate transcriptional functions of these downstream
  transcription factors. Under cold conditions, production of endogenous jasmonate
  is induced. The COI1 receptor perceives jasmonate and targets JAZ proteins for degradation.
  Upon degradation of JAZ proteins, the ICE factors are subsequently released to activate
  CBF/DREB1 gene expression and their downstream cold-responsive genes. Jasmonate
  also regulates Arabidopsis constitutive and cold acclimation–induced freezing tolerance
  by influencing the synthesis of secondary metabolites and via some CBF/DREB1-independent
  pathways. The final outcome of jasmonate regulation is the enhancement of plant
  tolerance to freezing stress.
