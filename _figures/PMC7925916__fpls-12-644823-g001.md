caption: 'Multistep phosphorelay integrates hormonal and environmental signaling during
  abiotic stress responses. The output of multistep phosphorelay is affected by crosstalk
  with a number of individual signaling pathways. The crosstalk takes place either
  at the level of AHPs phosphorylation by the receptors with varying signal specificities
  or through interaction of the response regulators (both A-ARRs and B-ARRs) with
  various transcription factors [e.g., ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC
  1 (COP1), ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTORS (ABFs)], as well as SNF1-RELATED
  PROTEIN KINASE 2 (SnRK2) and phytochromes. See the main text for a detailed description
  of each signaling pathway. Color code: MSP signaling is depicted in green, ethylene
  signaling in blue, light signaling in ochre, abscisic acid in purple. The His/Asp
  phosphorylation is depicted by circled P in bright yellow, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation
  in orange. Created with BioRender.com.'
