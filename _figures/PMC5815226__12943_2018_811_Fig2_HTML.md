caption: 'The mechanistic basis of V-ATPase dependent signaling. V-ATPase (orange)
  acidifies intracellular vesicles thereby regulating Notch signaling and other pathways
  like Wnt and TGF-β, which depend on endolysosomal system for sustenance. In Notch
  Signaling, the Notch receptor (dark pink) is cleaved in Golgi and translocated to
  the plasma membrane where further cleavage of the receptor occurs in response to
  Notch ligand (light pink) binding. Cleaved Notch intracellular domain is translocated
  to nucleus activating Notch target genes. TGF-β (dark green) protein is glycosylated
  in the Golgi to form mature TGF-β and secreted into the extracellular space. TGF-β
  bound to its receptor (TGF-βR) (bright green) results in endocytosis and phosphorylation
  of Smad2 (olive green), which in turn activates TGF-β target genes. During canonical
  Wnt signaling, the binding of ligands to the Wnt receptor complex (bright yellow)
  inhibits the phosphorylation of β-catenin (dark yellow) by GSK-3β and directs the
  translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus where it activates the transcription
  of target genes Cyclin D1 and oncogene c-Myc. V-ATPase-mediated acidification can
  affect signaling in the following ways: a Maturation of signaling molecules Notch
  receptor and TGF-β by furin glycosylation in the golgi vesicles. b Cleavage and
  activation of pathway mediators by acid-dependent enzyme like matrix metallo proteinases
  (MMPs) and γ-secretase. c Maintenance of basal signaling by recycling endocytosis
  of both ligand and receptor. d Degradation of signaling molecules in lysosomes'
