caption: 'Overview of ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway.
  The accumulation of unfolded and/or misfolded protein induces ER stress and restores
  ER homeostasis. The cell activates a series of signaling pathways, named the unfolded
  protein response (UPR). The UPR is regulated by four main proteins: IRE1α, PERK,
  ATF6 and CREBH. IRE1α, PERK, ATF6 and CREBH are ultimately responsible for the activation
  of a set of transcription factors, including spliced Xbp1, ATF4, CHOP, cleaved ATF6
  and cleaved CREBH.'
