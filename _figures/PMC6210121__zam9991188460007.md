caption: 'Metabolic pathways and possible participants in chain elongation. The FAB
  pathway (top left) and RBO pathway (top right) are presented. The two pathways were
  constructed with information from enzymes annotated against the KO database. Abbreviations:
  ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; 2[H], NADH/NADPH/ferredoxin. Dashed
  lines indicate the next cycle of elongation, of which (Cn+2)-acyl-CoA/ACP plays
  the role of starter molecule. Key enzymes are highlighted in red, and involved enzymes
  are listed in . (Cn), the number of carbon atoms of the molecule [for example, in
  (Cn)-acyl-CoA, an n of 1 means formyl-CoA, an n of 2 means acetyl-CoA, an n of 3
  means propionyl-CoA, etc.]. Each turn of the cycle generates an acyl-CoA/ACP (indicated
  as Cn+2) which is two carbons longer than the initial acyl-CoA/ACP (indicated as
  Cn).'
