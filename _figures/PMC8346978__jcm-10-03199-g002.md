caption: Close correlation between psoriasis and adipose tissue. Adipokines and proinflammatory
  cytokines derived from white adipose tissue (WAT) enhance and influence the Th17-mediated
  inflammatory response. In psoriasis and obesity, balance between proinflammatory
  adipokines and anti-inflammatory adipokines is dysregulated. In obese WAT, macrophages
  infiltrate the stromal vascular fraction of WAT via the monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1
  (MCP-1)/CCR2 pathway. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) activated via TLR4 stimulation
  by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) release proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and
  IL-6. SFAs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) also activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in ATMs, resulting
  in the enhanced production of IL-1 and IL-18. These proinflammatory cytokines synergistically
  work with Th17-derived cytokines to enhance systemic inflammatory responses.
