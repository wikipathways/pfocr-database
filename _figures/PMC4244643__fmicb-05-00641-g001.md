caption: Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid building blocks. The three pathways leading to
  the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP – MEP/DOXP pathway, Mevalonate and the alternate
  mevalonate pathway (in red), which is prevalent in archaea are shown. Mevalonate
  and the alternate mevalonate pathways share four of their seven enzymatic steps.
  The enzyme acronyms are written in bold. DXS, 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase;
