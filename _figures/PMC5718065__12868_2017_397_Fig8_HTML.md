caption: Schematic diagram illustrating potential interactions and changes in Ten-m3
  KOs. a In WT mice, Ten-m3 acts to repress Zic2, a promoter of EphB1 transcription.
  Ten-m3 also promotes EphA7 expression. These interactions may be direct or indirect.
  Other interactions are also possible. For example, Ten-m3’s regulation of EphA7
  may involve or be downstream of its interaction with Zic2 (not shown). b In Ten-m3
  KO mice the repression of Zic2 is removed and thus Zic2 is upregulated which in
  turn drives increased expression of EphB1. The positive regulation of EphA7 by Ten-m3
  is also removed causing a reduced expression of EphA7 compared to WT
