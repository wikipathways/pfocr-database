caption: Simplified view of enterohepatic sterol metabolism intestinal uptake of sterols,
  including cholesterol (CH), phytosterols (P), stanols (S), and fat-soluble vitamins
  (not shown for clarity), into enterocytes is facilitated by the unidirectional NPC1L1
  transporter, a process blocked by ezetimibe (EZ). Net sterol absorption is increased
  by recessive mutations of either ABCG5 or ABCG8, which encodes the ATP-binding cassette
  transporters G5 and 8, which preferentially efflux S and P back into the intestinal
  lumen. A proportion of enterocyte CH and esterified CH (not shown) is packaged into
  chylomicrons (CM) and released into lymph. In hepatocytes, ABC transporters pump
  sterols (ABCG5/8), bile acids (ABCB11), and phospholipids (ABCB4, not shown) into
  biliary canaliculi. Effluxed CH can be recaptured by NPC1L1 and reabsorbed. Mixed
  micelles formed in biliary canaliculi from phospholipids, cholesterol, and bile
  acids are stored in the gall bladder until their release is stimulated. Noncholesterol
  sterols reduce the incorporation of cholesterol into mixed micelles (), thereby
  reducing cholesterol uptake by the NPC1L1-mediated process (, ). The majority of
  bile acids are recovered by the ileum. Emerging data (not shown for clarity) indicate
  that the ABCG5/8 transporter may also facilitate noncholesterol sterol stimulation
  of intestinal cholesterol excretion through a nonbiliary route (, ) Cholesterol
  7 α -hydroxylase (CYP7A1) initiates the classic bile acid synthetic pathway to replace
  those eliminated in feces.
