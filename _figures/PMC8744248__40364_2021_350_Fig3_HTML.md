caption: 'Mechanism of combination therapies. (A) Complementary mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1
  and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Presentation of tumor-associated antigen by the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) expressed by APCs results in the release of an activation signal in
  combination with a co-stimulatory signal via the B7-CD28 pathway, leading to activation
  of T cells in the lymph node; B7 also binds to CTLA-4 with a higher affinity than
  that of CD28, in which case T cells cannot be activated. PD-1 on T cells inhibits
  antigen-specific T cell activation by interacting with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.
  Immune escape is induced through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, as well as the B7/CTLA-4 axis.
  This figure was adapted from Kudo, et al. []. (B) VEGF modulates the immunosuppressive
  TME, and TKIs restore this suppressive effect. Red arrows represent promotion effects.
