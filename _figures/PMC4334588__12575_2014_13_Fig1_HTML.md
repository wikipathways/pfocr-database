caption: K +/Na +homeostasis in higher plants. Plant root cells generally absorb Na+/K+
  from soil through different channels (NSCCs, AKT1, LCT1, CCC), transporters (KUP/HAK/KT
  and HKT) and apoplastic. Channel permeations and apoplastic are the main pathways
  of Na+ influx under salt stress. In the SOS pathway Na+ crosses the plasma membrane
  to the apoplast or soil solution and the NHX1 partitions Na+ within vacuole and
  jointly regulate the cytosol Na+ concentrations and play a vital role in response
  to salt stress. AtHKT1;1, OsHKT1;5, TaHKT1;5 and TmHKT1;4/5 retrieve Na+ from the
  xylem into xylem parenchyma cell and prevent the shoot from damage caused by Na+
  over-accumulation. It is hypothesized that AtHKT1;1 mediates recycling Na+ from
  the shoot to root through removal of Na+ from the xylem and loading Na+ into the
  phloem sieves. These processes assure a normal K+/Na+ homeostasis and maintain a
  high K+/Na+ ratio to rescue plants when suffering from salt stress. NSCC, nonselective
  cation channels; CCC, cation-Cl − co-transporter; LCT, low-affinity cation transporter;
  SOS1, salt overly sensitive 1; NHX1, Na+/H+ antiporter 1.
