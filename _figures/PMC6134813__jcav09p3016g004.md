caption: Two most significant k-clique modules in the PPI network. (A) Module 1 consisted
  of 12 nodes and 66 edges, which are mainly associated with G-protein coupled receptor
  signaling pathway, CXCR3 chemokine receptor binding and CXC chemokine; (B) Module
  2 consisted of 10 nodes and 45 edges, which are mainly associated with mitotic cell
  cycle process, nuclear division and chromosome segregation. Genes in red represent
  as upregulation and genes in green represent as downregulation.
