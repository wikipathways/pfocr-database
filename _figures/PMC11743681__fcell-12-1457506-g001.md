caption: Cellular and Molecular mechanisms regulating Neural Crest (NC) cell migration
  and polarity. (A) Schematic representation of a group of collectively migrating
  NC cells with polarized leader cells at the forefront. The in vivo migration routes
  are delineated by confinement boundaries expressing different members of the ephrin/Eph
  family. A highlighted box indicates two of the leader cells in the group, expanded
  in (B, C). (B) Enlarged view of the leader cells showing the antagonistic regulation
  of RhoA and Rac1. RhoA facilitates cellular retraction at the posterior edge, while
  Rac1 promotes protrusions at the anterior edge. Rac1 activity is modulated by several
  pathways including Trio and Cdc42. The CXCR4/Sdf1 signaling pathway, originating
  from placodal cells, guides the migratory trajectories of NC cells. Meanwhile, C3a
  signaling, released by the NC cells themselves, helps maintain their cohesion through
  a mechanism of co-attraction by regulating Rac1 activity. Contact Inhibition of
  Locomotion (CIL) is driven by Rac1 inhibition at the cell-cell contacts. This process
  is intricately regulated by the activation of Ric8A, which activates Gα proteins.
  Then Gα proteins activates Par3 that inhibits Trio at cell-cell contacts, leading
  to a specific localized Rac1 inhibition and ensuring proper cell retraction. (C)
  Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) at the leading edge is regulated by the WNT signaling
  pathway, which activates Frizzled receptors. This, in turn, activate Dishevelled
  (Dsh/Dvl) and PTK7, leading to the downstream activation of RhoA. RhoA inhibits
  Trio and Rac1 to ensure proper cell polarity. Calponin-2 (Cnn2) at the leading edge
  induces protrusion formation necessary for cell migration. This regulation is crucial
  for maintaining the balance between cell protrusion and retraction, enabling directed
  migration
