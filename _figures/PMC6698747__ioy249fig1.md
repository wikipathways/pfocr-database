caption: Liver mTOR as a link between decreased oxygen and nutrient availability and
  restricted fetal growth. Inhibition of fetal liver mTOR signaling and activation
  of AAR are mechanistically linked to increased IGFBP-1 secretion and IGFBP-1 phosphorylation
  in primary fetal hepatocytes, and we propose that these changes precede the development
  of IUGR. Both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II are key regulators
  of fetal growth. However, because phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 increases the affinity
  for binding IGF-I but not IGF-II only IGF-I is depicted in the figure (see the text).
  AAR, amino acid response pathway; CK2, casein kinase 2; IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth
  factor binding protein 1; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; IUGR, intrauterine
  growth restriction; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; PKC, protein kinase C.
