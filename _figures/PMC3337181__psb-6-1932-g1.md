caption: Comparison of gene expression levels of phytohormone biosynthetic genes.
  Average mRNA levels during 24 h in the wild-type (WT) and osgi-1 plants are indicated
  as single color gradient. Their ratios (FC; fold change) between WT and osgi-1 are
  indicated as different color gradient. Red and green colors indicate higher and
  lower expression in osgi-1 mutant, respectively. A simplified view of each phytohormone
  biosynthetic pathway and genes involved in the indicated step are described in left
  sides of the expression data. Asterisks on right shoulder of gene name indicate
  that peaked expression level was lower than 26. Color gradient display was drawn
  by means of software, MeV_4_7.
