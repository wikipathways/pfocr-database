caption: 'The sphingolipid metabolic pathway.Notes: S1P is generated by the catabolism
  of ceramide, which is the central molecule of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway.
  Sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinase, yielding phosphorylcholine and
  ceramide; the latter is further metabolized to form a free fatty acid and sphingosine.
  Sphingosine can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase resulting in S1P. S1P can
  be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by S1P phosphatase (or nonspecific lipid
  phosphatases), or irreversibly cleaved by S1P lyase into phosphoethanolamine and
  trans-2-hexadecenal.Abbreviation: S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate.'
