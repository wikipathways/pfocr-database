caption: 'Proposed isoflavone biosynthesis and conversion in P. vulgaris leaves in
  response to X. axonopodis. The scheme was adapted from isoflavone biosynthetic pathways
  described for various legumes [,] and metabolites that are known to occur in P.
  vulgaris, specifically coumestrol, daidzein, dalbergiodin, genistein, 2′-hydroxygenistein,
  kievitone and phaseollinisoflavan []. General flavonoid pathway reactions are represented
  by black solid arrows; a yellow arrow represents the divergence to the flavonol
  pathway. Isoflavone pathway reactions are represented by blue arrows. Red arrows
  are used to denote proposed and/or unknown reactions leading to the accumulation
  of hydroxyisoflavanones (e.g., kievitone), coumestans (i.e., coumestrol) and isoflavans
  (i.e., phaseollinisoflavan). Abbreviations include: CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHR,
  chalone reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl:
  coenzyme A ligase; HID, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase; HI4′OMT, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone
  4′-O-methyltransferase; IFH, isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase; IFR, isoflavone reductase;
  IFS, isoflavone synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; VR, vestitone reductase.'
