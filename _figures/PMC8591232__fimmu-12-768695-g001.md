caption: Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon viral infection can activate
  the Jak STAT pathway resulting in the formation of a phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT)
  dimer that binds to the promoter region of pro-inflammatory and pro-survival genes.
  Upregulation of these genes result in macrophage activation and recruitment, and
  increased systemic inflammation which all contribute to the development of neurological
  deficits, chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, and comorbidities such as HIV-1-associated
  neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Jak ½ selective
  inhibitors ruxolitinib and baricitinib, and Jak 3 selective inhibitor tofacitinib
  are FDA approved compounds that are candidates to be repurposed in the anti-viral
  space due to their efficacy in blocking the inflammatory Jak STAT cascade. Baricitinib
  has been approved (EUA) for the indication of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and
  tofacitinib has shown significant benefit in treatment of COVID-19 (–). Dimethyl
  fumarate and venetoclax, both FDA approved compounds, are candidates to be repurposed
  at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Dimethyl fumarate is an
  activator of Nrf2 which inhibits the promotor of pro-inflammatory genes during transcription.
  Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that post-transcriptionally sequesters pro-survival
  protein BCL-2. Created with BioRender.com.
