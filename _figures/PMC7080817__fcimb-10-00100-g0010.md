caption: Daily differences in the response to LPS induced septic-shock. Intraperitoneal
  LPS administration acts through TLR4 on macrophages which can secrete cytokines
  to circulation, especially TNF-α; with higher levels of it after injection at ZT11
  compared to ZT19 and also in animals subjected to CJL. Additionally, either LPS
  or cytokines can signal to the central nervous system through LPS or cytokine receptors
  present in the brain-blood barrier or through receptors present in the vagus nerve.
  This signaling can be responsible for hypothalamic activation (studied as cFos inmunoreactive
  cells), which again is higher at ZT11. Finally, this activation may induce the hypothermic
  response that is differential at ZT11 compared to ZT19, and again deeper in those
  mice kept in CJL conditions. Interestingly, TNFR1 KO mice did not show daily differences
  in the mortality rate, hypothermia levels and hypothalamic activation, which demonstrates
  that TNF-α signaling pathway is related to the septic daily response.
