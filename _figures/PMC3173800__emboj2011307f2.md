caption: 'The two major pathways to caspase activation in vertebrates: the death receptor
  or extrinsic pathway, engaged by the indicated members of the TNF receptor family
  on the cell surface, and the Bcl-2-regulated mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway.
  The death receptors lead, via the adaptor FADD (with help by TRADD in certain death
  receptors), to activation of caspase-8, which then activates the effector caspases-3,
  -6 and -7. Caspase-8 also processes the BH3-only protein Bid, and the truncated
  Bid (tBid) can then activate the Bcl-2-regulated pathway. Upon MOMP, that pathway
  leads to effector caspase activation via Apaf-1 and caspase-9. The cytosolic E3
  ubiquitin ligase XIAP can inhibit caspases-3 and -7 (and perhaps caspase-9), but
  that inhibition is blocked by SMAC/DIABLO when it is released from mitochondria.
  E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 work instead in part by preventing formation
  of the pro-apoptotic signalling complex from TNF-R1 and by regulating pro-survival
  NF-κB survival pathways.'
