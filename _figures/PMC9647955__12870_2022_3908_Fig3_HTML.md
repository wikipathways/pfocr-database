caption: The effect of γ-PGA on the expression of genes related to auxin synthesis.
  The maize roots were treated with γ-PGA, and the expression of genes related to
  auxin synthesis in the roots after treatment for 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h,
  and 96 h. And the maize without treatment was used as the control. Expression levels
  of these genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, fold changes in transcripts were
  calculated by 2-ΔΔCt method with ZmTub as an internal control. And the heatmaps
  of these genes were made using the value of log2 (γ-PGA/control) of the relative
  expression level
