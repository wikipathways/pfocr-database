caption: (a) Twenty-four hours after training, the membrane potential of the CGC soma
  and proximal axonal segments are persistently depolarized (indicated by green outlines)
  allowing the gating in of CS-evoked sensory input to the CBI cells (Cerebral Buccal
  Interneurons). The CBIs in turn activate interneurons of the feeding central pattern
  generator (CPG) to generate the rhythmic motor pattern underlying the conditioned
  feeding response to the CS. Unconditioned food stimuli (such as sucrose) activate
  feeding via a parallel pathway not affected by classical conditioning. MNs, motoneurons
  of the feeding system. (b) Treatment with Aβ 25-35 and Aβ 1-42 at 24 hours after
  training both lead to memory loss 24 hours later (no feeding response to CS). Aβ
  25-35, but not Aβ 1-42, targets the CGC soma and resets its membrane potential to
  the untrained level resulting in the removal of downstream effects of the depolarized
  soma membrane, which prevents the conditioned feeding response to be activated by
  the CS. Aβ 1-42 does not affect the CGC soma and may exert its memory impairing
  effect by affecting the SN to CGC, CGC to SN and/or SN to CBI synapses (areas in
  blue circles), which also may be affected by Aβ 25-35 in addition to its primary
  effect on somal membrane potential. Neither peptide affects the US pathway, the
  CBIs, the feeding CPG, or motoneurons and the synapses connecting these components
  of the feeding network and therefore the animals remain capable of responding to
  unconditioned food stimuli.
