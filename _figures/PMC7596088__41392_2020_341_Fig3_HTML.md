caption: Role of TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-1β signaling pathways in PDAC EMT. a TGF-β signaling
  pathway can be SMAD-dependent or independent. In SMAD-dependent setting, TGF-β binds
  its receptor complex (TGF-β receptors I/II dimer) and phosphorylate SMAD proteins
  and subsequently transported into the nucleus to induce EMT-TFs. Activation of TGFR
  can also engage MAPK and NF-kB signaling to transactivate EMT-TFs. b Engagement
  of the IL-6R activates JAK kinases which phospho-activate STAT3 transcription factor,
  leading to upregulation of EMT-TFs. c Activation of IL-1R engages IRAK4-TAK1 and
  the downstream NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades to promote EMT
