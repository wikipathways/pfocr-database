caption: Autophagy, pyroptosis, and some classic signaling pathway. (1) Autophagy
  is under control of mTOR signaling and PINK1-parkin signaling. SESN2 signaling pathway
  upregulates autophagy through inhibiting mTOR or other mechanisms. Research indicate
  these signaling pathways have further impact on pyroptosis level. (2) STING senses
  DNA derived from damaged organelles or pathogens and get activated, which induces
  both pyroptosis and autophagy. Autophagy in turn negatively modulates STING activity
  and restricts overactivated pyroptosis.
