caption: (A–B) The propose mechanism of BD-induced release of endogenous DAMPs that
  elicit the inflammatory cytokines is based on the results of present study in both
  in vitro and animal studies. BD = brain death; DAMPs = damage-associated molecular
  patterns; HMGB = high mobility group box 1; BDEX = brain death extraction; TLR =
  toll-like receptor; IL = interleukin; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor alpha; IFN-γ
  = interferon gamma; iNOS = inducible nitric oxide synthase; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB;
