caption: Mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis
  proceeds mainly through the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway. The TNFR superfamily
  (e.g., FAS, TNFR1, or DR4/DR5) is activated and interacts with death receptor ligands,
  FASL, TNF, or TRAIL. For example, TNF binds to and activates TNFR, recruiting the
  adaptor molecule FADD. Together, these proteins activate caspase 8, which cleaves
  and stimulates downstream caspase 3 and 7, which target hundreds of cellular components
  leading to rapid cell apoptosis. The pathway of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis
  is instigated by intrinsic stimuli (including oxidative damage, DNA damage, growth
  factor depletion, or Ca2+ overload), which cause activation of BH3-only proteins.
  BH3-only proteins activate the effector proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK, resulting
  in MOMP. Then, MOMP leads to the release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins,
  including cytochrome c. Cytochrome c interacts with APAF1, generating a special
  set of proteins called the apoptosome. The apoptosome interacts with caspase 9,
  which stimulates caspases 3 and 7. MOMP contributes to the release of cytochrome
  and SMAC. SMAC blocks the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase XIAP (an inhibitor of caspases
  3/7), promoting apoptosis. (b) After death receptor activation, the function of
  caspase 8 determines whether the cell undergoes apoptosis or necroptosis. If caspase
  8 activation is inhibited, TNF signaling induces the activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3.
  RIPK3 phosphorylates and binds to MLKL causing the generation of necrosomes. The
  necrosome can be shuttled to the mitochondrial membrane and cause mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization via a different mechanism of apoptosis. The necrosome
  also activates the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, enhancing
  aerobic respiration and ROS generation. In turn, ROS can increase the activation
  of RIPK3 and promote necrosome assembly.
