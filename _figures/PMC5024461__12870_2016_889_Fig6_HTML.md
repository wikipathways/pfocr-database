caption: Proposed mechanistic model for paradormancy release by PHC in grapevine buds.
  Upon application, HC causes immediate cellular hypoxia through the action of released
  cyanide on aerobic respiration and inhibition of catalase activity and induces H2O2
  production. ROS (O2•-, H2O2,.OH) and RNS (NO) are rapidly produced possibly by several
  enzymatic systems, such as NADPH oxidase, amine oxidase, nitrate reductase and arginine-nitric
  oxide synthase. H2O2 and ethylene act as signaling molecules activating genes involved
  in antioxidant defense systems. The antioxidant machinery and related pathways (e.g.
  FSD, POD, DOX, GPX, APX, AOX, HB, etc.) are upregulated to maintain ROS and RNS
  at sublethal levels to avoid PCD. H2O2 in the cell wall induces cell wall loosening
  and expansion. H2O2 also functions in anabolic, signaling and defense pathways and
  in the synthesis of the other ROSs,.OH in the presence of H2O2 and O2•- exerts a
  wall loosening effect, and H2O2 also drives peroxidase-mediated cross-linking of
  structural cell wall components. In the signal transduction pathway, ROS triggers
  the expression of ROS responsive genes. H2O2 and.OH activate Ca2+ channels and initiate
  a signal transduction and activate protein kinase activity, which in turn activates
  different transcription factors to regulate ROS scavenging and ROS producing pathways.
  Finally, these transcription factors control the downstream functional gene expression
  responsible for dormancy release and growth resumption in grapevine buds. The accumulation
  of ethylene in the buds promotes cell elongation and parenchyma formation by activating
  related ERFs
