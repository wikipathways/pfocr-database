caption: Pathway Analysis Models for the Tamoxifen (TAM) Pathway tested with data
  from the Placebo (P) and Tamoxifen (T) arms. The pathway analysis models were generated
  by applying genotype data for the indicated treatment arm to the TAM pathway model.
  The number next to each line is a “path coefficient” which indicates how strongly
  the variations in the two adjacent genes are associated with each other. A zero
  would indicate no association between the allelic variation patterns in two adjacent
  genes (a red number indicates that the association is significantly stronger than
  a predetermined threshold level which is 0 for this figure). (A). Tamoxifen (TAM)
  Pathway/Placebo (P) arm. A red line indicates that there is a significant difference
  between the two arms with respect to the association, i.e. path coefficient, between
  the two linked genes. (B). Tamoxifen (TAM) Pathway/Tamoxifen (T) arm.
