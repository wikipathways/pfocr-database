caption: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (modified after ()). (A). The default
  “off-state”. In the absence of a Wnt ligand, cytoplasmic β-catenin is constitutively
  engaged by a group of proteins termed “the destruction complex” containing the Axin
  and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) proteins. By recruiting the kinases, Casein
  Kinase 1α and GSK-3β, the destruction complex facilitates the phosphorylation of
  β-catenin. The phosphorylated β-catenin serves as a substrate for the β-Trcp E3
  ubiquitin ligase that targets it for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.
  (B). The “on-state”. The signaling is initiated by WNT ligand binding to Frizzled
  (Fz) and LRP5/6 co-receptors ultimately leading to the inhibition of the destruction
  complex and β̃catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus. Nuclear
  β-catenin binding to T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription
  factors leads to the activation of target gene expression. The RSPO1 protein is
  thought to facilitate Wnt-Fz-LRP complex formation through fending off a secreted
  inhibitor, DKK1 (C). The regulated “off-state”. DKK1 binding to the LRP6 co-receptor
  blocks Wnt signal transduction by preventing formation of the Wnt-Fz-LRP6 signaling
  complex.
