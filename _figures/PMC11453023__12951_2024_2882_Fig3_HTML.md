caption: An overview of mRNA vaccine immunogenicity. DCs, macrophages, and B cells
  present antigens to the immune system through mRNA vaccines. The tumor antigen is
  secreted out of the host cell or converted into smaller peptides by the proteasome
  after translation termination. An antigenic peptide is processed in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, and then loaded on MHC class I or class II. DCs
  uptake soluble tumor antigens and stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with antigen-specificity
  by using MHC-II and cross-presentation pathways. In addition to activating antigen-specific
  CD8+ T cells in DCs through the MHC-I pathway, endogenously expressed tumor antigens
  can also induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. This aggressive germinal
  center response follows mRNA vaccination, which leads to B-cells identifying tumor
  antigens and producing antibodies that can neutralize tumor cells. Created with
