caption: Schematic showing the novel bile acid-mediated immune microenvironment in
  HCC progression. Considering our study results, we propose a model involving NorCA
  in HCC development. First, NorCA interacts with HCC cells to promote their ability
  to express PD-L1 through the FXR-SHP pathway. Second, NorCA enhances the synthesis
  and secretion of Exos from HCC cells by regulating NSMase and RAB27A. Third, N-Exos
  have the potential to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating
  the function of CD4+ T cell, thus creates beneficial conditions for tumor development.
