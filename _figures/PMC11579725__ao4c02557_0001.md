caption: 'Multiplatform analysis workflow for data acquisition and two sample extraction
  protocols performed for lipidic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The extracts
  were analyzed using two different analytical approaches: LC-HRMS for the methanolic
  extract and MALDI-MS for the lipidic extract. Initially, the data were analyzed
  separately and combined to build a single statistical model. Finally, the most critical
  metabolites were annotated, identified, and submitted to a metabolic pathway analysis.
