caption: Model for the regulation of Yox1 by the Rad3 DNA replication checkpoint.
  During the cell division cycle Yox1 functions as a repressor of MBF-dependent gene
  expression. However, Yox1 is also regulated by the Rad3 cell cycle checkpoint in
  response to incomplete DNA replication. In the model activation of the Rad3 checkpoint
  pathway stimulates Rad3/Cds1-dependent phosphorylation of Yox1, inhibiting its repressor
  function, which leads to derepression of MBF-dependent gene expression.
