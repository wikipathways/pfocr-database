caption: Proposed role of the intracellular distribution of Rho5 and its dimeric GEF
  Dck1/Lmo1 in the oxidative stress response. Rho5 is inactive in its GDP-bound and
  active in its GTP-bound state, which are interconverted by the help of a GTPase
  activating protein (GAP, Rgd2) and the dimeric GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF, Dck1/Lmo1).
  Negative regulation (lines with bars) of the cell wall integrity pathway (CWI) and
  the high osmolarity glycerol pathway (HOG) is indicated for the active Rho5 associated
  with the plasma membrane by its lipid anchor (wavy line). A possible indirect effect
  of the CWI pathway on mitophagy and apoptosis (see discussion section) is symbolized
  by the dashed arrow. Dotted arrows show proposed routes of intracellular trafficking
  of the GTPase and its GEF subunits under different physiological conditions. Fusion
  constructs to confine Rho5 to either the plasma membrane through the CWI sensor
  Mid2, or to the mitochondrial outer membrane through the transmembrane domain (TMD)
  of Fis1, either directly or fused to a GFP nanobody (GFP-nb), constructed in this
  work are also indicated. Phenotypes regarding oxidative stress response are highlighted
  in blue print.
