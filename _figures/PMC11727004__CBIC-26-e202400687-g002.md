caption: Chemoenzymatic synthesis of phenyldiazene derivatives using the biosynthetic
  pathway of a diazo group‐containing natural product. Feeding active methylene compounds
  (4 a–4 e) into the culture of the 3‐DAA (2)‐producing strain caused an intracellular
  coupling reaction between the diazo and active methylene groups to produce phenyldiazene
  derivatives (5 a–5 e). The cis or trans configuration of the carbon/nitrogen double
  bond in 5 a–5 e was not confirmed; therefore the adjacent nitrogen‐nitrogen bond
  is indicated by a wavy line
