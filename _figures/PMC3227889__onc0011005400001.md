caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action for cancer vaccines. Tumor antigens (e.g.,
  administered as proteins, peptides, or whole tumor cells) are taken up and processed
  by specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs
  migrate to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes and present relevant antigens to CD8+
  T lymphocytes, which, in turn, are able to recognize tumor cells throughout the
  body and destroy them by several effector mechanisms such as the perforin/granzyme
  pathway, direct cell–cell interaction (e.g., Fas/Fas ligand), or certain mediators
  (e.g., INFγ). Not shown but also of importance are B lymphocytes, CD4+ T helper
  cells and cells of the innate immune system such as natural killer cells and macrophages.Abbreviations:
  INF, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex.'
