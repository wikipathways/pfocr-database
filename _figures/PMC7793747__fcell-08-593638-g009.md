caption: Schematic illustration of low-passage DP-EVs inhibiting the BMP signaling
  pathway in ORSCs and MxCs. In cultured scalp follicles, miR-140-5p–enriched EVs
  derived from DPCs were transferred to ORSCs and MxCs. miR-140-5p could suppress
  the BMP pathway by directly binding to and repressing BMP2. Down-regulation of endogenous
  BMP2 resulted in inhibition of SMAD5 serine phosphorylation in ORSCs and MxCs, leading
  in turn to cell proliferation and hair growth. ORSC, outer root sheath cell; MxC,
  hair matrix cell; DSCs, dermal sheath cell; IRSC, inner root sheath cell; DPC, dermal
  papilla cell; DP-EV, dermal papilla-derived extracellular vesicle.
