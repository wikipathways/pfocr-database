caption: EP4 signaling in keratinocytes. Similar to the EP2 receptor, ligand activation
  of EP4 also leads to activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) with subsequent formation
  of cAMP and activation of the transcription factor CREB, although the extent of
  cAMP formation is significantly less than that resulting from EP2 activation. Although
  the mechanisms are not understood, activation of the EP4 receptor causes activation
  of the PI3K and AKT pathway. Thus, the biological outcomes of EP2 vs. EP4 activation
  are somewhat different, although both contribute to the development of skin cancer
