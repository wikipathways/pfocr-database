caption: 'illustrates the various components of the p53 regulatory pathway and relevant
  polymorphisms associated with ISFO. Red arrows indicate negative regulation and
  the dotted arrow from p53 to XRCC1 denotes the indirect relationship between the
  two. ✢: as noted above, numerous MMP2 SNPs were found but did not endure Bonferroni
  correction'
