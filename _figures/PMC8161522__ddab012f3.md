caption: 'Protein-protein interaction networks involving DEGs linked to the synaptic
  function. (A) STRING04 MinPPINet of genes involved in synaptic function visualized
  using the edge weighed spring embedded layout by betwenness index in Cytoscape.
  The network was built by querying STRING and selecting the PPIs with a medium confidence
  score (CS = 0.4) coming from all sources of evidence. The shapes of the nodes represent
  the following information: Shapes: i) Pallid pink ellipses: represent connecting
  proteins added to assure the full connectivity of the network; ii) pink octagons,
  represent Hsa21 syntenic genes in mouse not identified as contributing to the meta-pathway
  dysregulation by GAGE; iii) green inner coloured ellipses, genes identified by GAGE
  after q-val <0.1 cut off to be contributing even slightly, to any pathway of those
  found dysregulated inside the meta-pathway. If the size is similar to the octagons,
  they are also HSA21 syntenic genes in mouse. Additionally, the border colour represents
  the mouse model multi group where those genes are found altered in; iv) diamonds,
  genes identified by GAGE after q-val <0.1 cut off and also by FCROS as DEGs. (B)
  Network Structure Decomposition of the STRING04 MinPPINet. Highlighting in different
  colors the interactions of GSK3β, NPY, SNARE proteins, DYRK1A and RHOA respectively.
  In the case of NPAS4, the interactions coloured correspond up to the first level
  interactions. (C) The six RegPPINets were extracted from the selection of each fo
  the following proteins and their 2nd interactors from STRING04 MinPPINet: RHOA,
  DYRK1A, GSK3β, NPY, SNARE proteins and NPAS4. Then, those were further annotated
  with regulatory information using REACTOME (See ). The shapes of the nodes represent
  the following information: Shapes: i) Pallid pink ellipses: represent connecting
  proteins added to assure the full connectivity of the network; ii) pink octagons,
  represent HSA21 syntenic genes in mouse not identified as contributing to the meta-pathway
  dysregulation by GAGE; iii) green inner coloured ellipses, genes identified by GAGE

  genes identified by GAGE after q-val <0.1 cut off and also by FCROS as DEGs. The
  edges colored represent the type of interaction annotated by following the PathPPI
  classification (), and ReactomeFIViz annotations as follows i) The GErel edges indicating
  expression were colored in blue and repression in yellow. ii) PPrel edges indicating
  activation were coloured in green, inhibition in red. iii) Interactions between
  proteins known to be part of complexes in violet. iv) Predicted interactions were
  represented in grey including the PPI interactions identified by STRING DB () after
  merging both networks.'
