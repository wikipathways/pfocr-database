caption: 'Shown are the general pathways in which ER-phagy is utilized and the contributing
  receptors. These pathways include: Nutrient Supply (TEX264), RecovER-phagy (Reversal
  of ER Expansion) (SEC62 and possibly CCPG1), and Quality Control (FAM134B, RTN3L,
  and possibly ATL3). Not all the listed pathways are limited to the indicated ER-phagy
  receptors. For example, while TEX264 contributes to ~50% of autophagic flux during
  amino acid deprivation, other ER receptors, such as FAM134B, can also participate
  in starvation-induced ER-phagy, albeit far less efficiently. Note that a significant
  fraction of the ER is fragmented in the Nutrient Supply pathway to illustrate that
  TEX264 promotes degradation of a large portion of this organelle during amino acid
  starvation. SEC62 mediates RecovER-phagy. Although CCPG1 function appears to be
  regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR), it remains to be determined whether
  it also definitively participates in RecovER-phagy. In Quality Control, FAM134B
  facilitates the removal and degradation of misfolded procollagen (shown) and disease-causing
  mutant NPC1, whereas misfolded pro-insulin (Akita), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and
  arginine vasopressin (pro)-AVP utilize RTN3L. There are no known misfolded proteins
  that specifically utilize ATL3. Also note that FAM134B and RTN3L are inserted into
  the lipid bilayer via reticulon domains, whereas the other receptors shown possess
  bona fide transmembrane segments.'
