caption: 'Metabolic process in the hydrogenosome of both trichomonas and anaerobic
  fungi. The dotted line is the main metabolic pathway of trichomonas hydrogenosomes.
  The blue line represents the main hydrogenosomal metabolism pathway of anaerobic
  fungi. The black line is the common metabolic pathway of both of them. The red line
  shows a suspected H2 generation pathway, and it commonly exits in both. I. malic
