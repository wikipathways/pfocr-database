caption: Schematic diagram of DHM-mediated amelioration of oxidative stress through
  induction of autophagy via a SIRT3–ATG4B signaling pathway in PA-treated hepatocytes.
  DHM attenuates PA-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes through induction of autophagy,
  which is mediated through the increased expression of SIRT3 and SIRT3-mediated ATG4B
  deacetylation following DHM treatment
