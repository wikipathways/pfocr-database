caption: Potential genetic determinants of cardiovascular risk in SLE. The picture
  summarises some of the main potential pathways under genetic control and potentially
  involved in cardiovascular risk in patients with SLE. Genes marked with (^) have
  been showed to be involved in general SLE susceptibility. For genes marked with
  (*), evidence has been provided for a potential specific involvement in cardiovascular
  risk in patients with SLE. Polymorphisms in genes involved in antigen recognition
  (such as mannose-binding lectin, MBL, or C-reactive protein, CRP) and presentation
  (human leukocyte antigen, HLA) constitute examples of this latter category and might
  be pathogenic by affecting macrophage (Mϕ) and dendritic cell (DC) function. Several
  mechanisms of potential vascular pathogenic significance have been linked to IFNα
  pathways. IFNα has previously been linked to endothelial dysfunction and enhanced
  release of pro-inflammatory microparticles (EMP). The STAT4 pathway downstream IFNα-receptor
  plays a crucial role in T-helper 1 cell function and promotion of Mϕ activation
  through IFNγ. Recent evidence suggests an association between polymorphisms in the
  SRP54-AS1 gene and ischaemic events in patients with SLE. Impaired regulatory response
  to IFNα due to defective binding of STAT1 to SRP54-AS1 sequence has been proposed
  as a potential mechanism accounting for the observed phenotype-genotype association.
  SRP54-AS1 might have a regulatory role in multiple cell lines including B and T
  cells and Mϕs. In addition, its defective activation in vessels affects the expression
  of the neighbour gene FAM177A1, which could contribute to vascular inflammation.
  Impaired binding of transcription factors might also be the key mechanism for the
  pathogenicity of some novel SNPs in the IL19 gene. IL19 sequence regulation is thought
  to affect IL10 expression and ultimately B cell activation, proliferation and production
  of autoantibodies including anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Among potential
  transcription factors binding to IL19 sequence, IKZF3 is of particular interest
  due to its known association with SLE and its functional place downstream IFNα and
  IRF8, the latter being another recently described locus for potential cardiovascular
  susceptibility in patients with SLE. aPL, anti-phospholipid antibodies; B, B-lymphocyte;
