caption: The TREM2 signaling pathway. (A) TREM2 consists of an extracellular domain
  containing a V-type immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a short
  cytoplasmic domain lacking intrinsic signaling motifs. TREM2 functions by forming
  a heterodimeric complex with the adaptor proteins DAP10 or DAP12. Upon ligand binding,
  the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within DAP12 undergoes
  tyrosine phosphorylation, which recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase Syk.
  This subsequently initiates a cascade of downstream signaling events, including
  the activation of the PI3K/AKT-mTOR pathway, actin remodeling, Ca2+ mobilization,
  and the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. (B) The ITAM motif
  of DAP12 can also interact with the inhibitory proteins SHIP1, which mediates the
  degradation of PIP3 to PIP2, thereby attenuating TREM2 signaling. Additionally,
  CD33 can recruit phosphatases SHP1 or SHP2 to inhibit Syk phosphorylation, providing
  a cross-regulatory mechanism to suppress TREM2 signaling. (C) Furthermore, TREM2
  signaling is modulated by proteolytic processing. The extracellular domain of TREM2
  is cleaved by ADAM10/17, releasing soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), while the intracellular
  domain (ICD) of TREM2 is cleaved by γ-secretase, generating TREM2 ICD. Both processes
  contribute to the downregulation of TREM2 signaling activity. Image created with
