caption: The SUMOylation pathway. The SUMO protein moiety is activated by SUMO-activating
  enzyme E1 (such as SAE1, SAE2) through the cysteine (Cys) residue of E1. SUMO at
  E1 is transferred to the Cys residue of SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 (such as UBC9).
  SUMO linked to UBC9 is catalytically transferred to the lysine (Lys) residue of
  a substrate protein by a SUMO E3 ligase (such as PIAS, RANBP2, hPC2). Proteins modified
  with SUMOylation can play a critical role in oncogenic activity, protein–protein
  interactions, protein stability, or the regulation of transcriptional activities.
