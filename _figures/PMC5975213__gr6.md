caption: Summary of findings and working hypothesis of possible role of red cell sGC.
  RBCs were considered for a long time to scavenge endothelial-derived NO, in a reaction
  where hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin, while NO is converted into nitrate.
  RBCs were shown to carry enzymes regulating NO synthesis including eNOS and arginase
  1 (Arg1). In this manuscript, we show that RBCs carry a isoform 1 of soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC or GC1), catalyzing NO-depended cGMP formation in a phopshodiesterase
  5 dependent fashion, leading to activation of protein kinase G (PKG) and probably
  to other targets. Potential NO sources leading to activation of red cell sGC may
  be endothelial NO, or erythrocytic NO produced under normoxic conditions (e.g. by
  eNOS) or under hypoxic conditions from nitrite by deoxyhemoglobin catalyzed nitrite
  reduction. This reaction was shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in vivo. The
  functional significance of the NO – cGMP pathway in RBCs should be further investigated
  in vivo.
