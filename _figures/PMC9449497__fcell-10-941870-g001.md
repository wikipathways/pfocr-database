caption: Gαi canonical signaling network through receptor activation (A,B) and non-canonical
  activation (C). (A) The upper panel shows the G-protein canonical signaling activation
  by the GPCR GEF activity, generating two active species (Gαi-GTP and Gβγ released).
  The intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gαi subunit hydrolyze GTP to GDP, promoting
  its re-association with Gβγ. (B) Canonical signaling pathway of Gαi, which is inhibitory
  of Adenylyl Cyclase (AC), and Gβγ activates MAPK signaling cascade. (C) The non-canonical
  activation signaling. During this process, Gαi interacts with cytosolic GEFs such
  as Ric-8 or GIV which stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange, activating Gαi in a receptor-independent
  manner potentiating the canonical signal or activating non-canonical effectors.
