caption: Genes encoding carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes of Aurantiochytrium sp. KH105.
  (a) The biosynthetic pathway for astaxanthin includes eight major enzymes, including
  geranyl diphosphate synthase (GDPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase (CrtE), phytoene synthase (CrtB), phytoene desaturase (CrtI),
  lycopene cyclase (CrtY), β-carotene ketorase (CrtO), and β-carotene hydroxylase
  (CrtZ). Green lines indicate common pathways shared by many prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
  while blue lines indicate other pathways [,,,,,,,,]. In the genome of Aurantiochytrium
  sp. KH105, three genes for crtB, crtI, and crtY are consecutively fused into a single,
  gene, crtIBY. The fused gene likely promotes the process from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) to β-carotene; (b) Two copies of GDPS, FDPS, crtE, crtIBY, crtO, and crtZ
  were found in different scaffolds. The numbers and lengths (kb) of scaffolds are
  shown, and directions of the genes are indicated by arrows.
