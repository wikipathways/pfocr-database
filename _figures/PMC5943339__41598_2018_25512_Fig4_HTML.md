caption: 'Top networks of differentially expressed genes in Mvs.PT as identified by
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis show strong association to cancer and connective tissue
  disorders. For network analyses a threshold of log2FC > |1.5| with a p-value < 0.0001
  (corresponding to a FDR of 0.004) was used, giving an overview of involved genes
  within the networks and their differential expression. Node colour indicates up-regulated
  (red), down-regulated (green) or not significantly changed according to threshold
  (grey) genes. Lines and arrows between nodes represent direct (solid lines) and
  indirect (dashed lines) interactions between molecules. All edges are supported
  by at least one reference from the literature or from canonical information stored
  in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Node shapes represent functional classes of gene
  products: square → cytokine, triangle → kinase, rectangle → nuclear receptor, concentric
  circle → group or complex, vertical diamond → enzyme, horizontal diamond → peptidase,
  trapezium → transporter, vertical ellipse → transmembrane receptor horizontal ellipse → transcription
  regulator, circle → other. (A) Top 03 significant Mvs.PT network (Cell-To-Cell Signalling
  and Interaction, Haematological System Development and Function, Tissue Morphology)
  contains 14 focus genes. (B) Top 07 significant Mvs.PT network (Cancer, Endocrine
  System Disorders, Developmental Disorder) contains 7 focus genes.'
