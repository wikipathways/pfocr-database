caption: Figure 2A. G protein-coupled PAC1 receptor isoforms within the third cytoplasmic
  loop. PAC1 receptors can be expressed in various isoforms depending on the absence
  or presence of two 84 - bp Hip and/or Hop cassettes encoding segments within the
  third cytoplasmic loop of the 7-transmembrane receptor (–, –). The PAC1 receptors
  can be contain neither Hip nor Hop (null isoform), Hip, Hop1, Hop2 (shortened form
  of Hop1), HipHop1 and HipHop2; the principal forms in the CNS are the null and the
  Hop1 receptor isoforms.Figure 2B. PAC1 receptor signaling cascades. The various
  PAC1 receptor isoforms can be differentially coupled to Gαs and Gαq to initiate
  adenylate cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascades, respectively
  (, –, ). In addition, as in other Class B GPCRs, the PAC1 receptor contains consensus
  Ser sequences in the intracellular cytoplasmic tail for high affinity arrestin binding
  for endosome signaling following PAC1 receptor internalization. Arrestin molecules
  can serve as scaffolds for adaptor proteins and enzymes for ERK pathway activation;
  in addition to downstream PKA/PKC - dependent signaling events, both PLC/PKC and
  AC/PKA pathways may also intersect with ERK signaling (, –). The internalization
  of G protein βγ subunits may result in other pathway activation including PI3K/Akt
  ().
