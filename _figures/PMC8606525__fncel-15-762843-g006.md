caption: Schematic summary of findings. In healthy cortical tissue (left), neuronal
  activity stimulates AA synthesis and downstream metabolism to PGE2 in astrocytes.
  PGE2 acts on EP4 receptors on pericytes to relax them and induce capillary dilation,
  thus allowing an activity-coupled increase in CBF to occur. 20-HETE synthesis is
  inhibited by NO, likely synthesized in an activity-dependent manner from neurons
  (26), which suppresses pericyte contraction. After stroke (right), AA in astrocytes
  continues to be metabolized to PGE2, which acts on EP4 receptors to relax pericytes,
  but the reduction in NO generation disinhibits a parallel AA metabolism pathway
  via CYP450 ω-hydroxylases to produce 20-HETE, which causes pericyte contraction.
  The cell type(s) in which CYP450 ω-hydroxylases are active remain unknown but may
  include both astrocytes and pericytes. The opposing effects of EP4-dependent relaxation
  and 20-HETE-induced contraction of pericytes result in no net change in capillary
  diameter and therefore no increase in CBF. Over time, this reduced neurovascular
  coupling could chronically impair resting CBF and contribute to cognitive decline.
