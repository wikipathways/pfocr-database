caption: (A) A CLU-specific Western blot of cell lysate of MG‑132-treated HEK‑293
  cells is shown. All detectable protein bands can be assigned to distinct CLU forms
  with different properties and subcellular localization (1 determined MWs of secretory
  CLU forms according to Kapron et al. []). (B) Model depicting the synthesis of CLU
  isoforms in unstressed and stressed HEK-293 cells. Under unstressed conditions,
  the dominant isoform sCLU is translated from variant 1, which accounts virtually
  for the total CLU mRNA amount. Cytosolic CLU1‑449 (‘mistranlocated’ sCLU pre-pro-protein)
  and CLU21‑449 (translated from exon 2 CUG) are not detectable due to presumably
  low expression and proteasomal degradation. CLU34‑449 is translated from exon 3
  AUG on variant 1 and from variant 1 [Δex2]. Although CLU34‑449 is not proteasomally
  degraded, it is not detectable in unstressed cells reflecting its low expression
  level. Induction of cellular stress (MG-132, heat) induces transcriptional upregulation
  of variant 1 and its splicing to variant 1 [Δex2] leading to enhanced synthesis
  of all CLU isoforms. Further, the ‘mistranslocation’ of CLU1‑449 to the cytosol
  is increased. In the case of proteotoxic stress induced by MG-132, diminished proteasomal
  degradation of CLU1‑449 and CLU21‑449 further promotes their accumulation. Altogether
  these events generate amounts of the rare cytosolic CLU isoforms that are detectable
  in Western Blot analyses. They account for 3.6% ± 1.6% (mean ± SD, n=5) of total
  cell-associated CLU in stressed cells as determined by densitometric quantification
  of corresponding bands. Note that different expression levels (from low to high)
  are indicated by the different line width of arrows (from dashed to bold). Variants
  2 and 3 are not illustrated because they are expressed in very low amounts and virtually
  do not contribute to the synthesis of any CLU isoform.
