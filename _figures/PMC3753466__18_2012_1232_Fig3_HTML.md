caption: Skp2/Cks1 is induced by the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway in nephropathy.
  In normal kidneys, tubular epithelial cells highly express p27 in the quiescent
  phase of the cell cycle. Following renal damage, TNF-α activates RelB/p52, known
  as NF-κB, via TNFR1. The activated RelB/p52 complex induces the expression of both
  Skp2 and Cks1 in the nucleus. The induced Skp2/Cks1 degrades p27 in tubular epithelial
  cells in UUO kidneys, allowing tubular epithelial cell proliferation to increase
  []. Tubular dilation occurs as a result of the increase in the tubular epithelial
  cell number and ultimately leads to progressive nephropathy []
