caption: Elesclomol (ES) binds copper (Cu2+) in the extracellular environment and
  transports it to the mitochondrial matrix. ES-Cu(II) complex is then reduced to
  ES and Cu(I) in the mitochondrial matrix in a reaction likely catalyzed by ferredoxin
  1 (FDX1). The copper(I) thus released can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  This copper(I) has been shown to be bioavailable for the metalation of cytochrome
  c oxidase (CcO) (solid arrow) and is also likely to be delivered to other subcellular
  compartments (dotted arrows), where it can be used for the maturation of cuproenzymes,
  including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the mitochondria and cytosol and lysyl
  oxidase (LOX), dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), ceruloplasmin, peptidylglycine α-amidating
  mono oxygenase (PAM), and tyrosinase in the secretory pathway.
