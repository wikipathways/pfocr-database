caption: 'UDP-GlcNAc And CMP-Neu5Ac Synthesis In Mammary Epithelial Cells: In the
  cytoplasm, glucose (Glu) enters the cell via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and is
  phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to form glucose-6-phosphate (Glu-6-P). This is
  further metabolized through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, converting fructose-6-phosphate
  (Fuc-6-P) into N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) via the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate
  aminotransferase (GFAT). GlcN-6-P is then converted to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-1-P) by phosphoglucosamine mutase (PGM3), followed by uridine diphosphate
  (UDP) activation through UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP1) to form
  UDP-GlcNAc. This nucleotide sugar is then transported into the Golgi via solute
  carrier family 35 member A2 (SLC35A2) for glycosylation reactions. Simultaneously,
  UDP-GlcNAc serves as a precursor for sialic acid biosynthesis. N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc) is converted to N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) by glucosamine-6-phosphate
  N-acetyltransferase (GNE), which is further phosphorylated by N-Acetylmannosamine
  kinase (NANK) to form N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P). This is then
  converted into N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) via N-acetylneuraminate synthase
  (NANS). Neu5Ac is subsequently activated to CMP-Neu5Ac by CMP-N-acetylneuraminic
  acid synthetase (CMAS). The activated CMP-Neu5Ac is transported into the Golgi by
  solute carrier family 35 member A1 (SLC35A1) for incorporation into glycoproteins
  and glycolipids'
