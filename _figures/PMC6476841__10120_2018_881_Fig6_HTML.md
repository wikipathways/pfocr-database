caption: Diagram for the mechanism underlying the resistance to 5FU in 5FU-resistant
  cells. 5FU is activated only through the OPRT–RR pathway in both cell lines, and
  in 5FU-resistant cells, FdUMP is reduced through the TP–TK pathway
papertitle: The inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase can reverse acquired 5FU-resistance
  in gastric cancer cells.
