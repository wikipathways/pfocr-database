caption: Signalling pathways involved in ccRCC. Increased growth factors and their
  receptors lead to activation of downstream MAPK, mTOR and NF-κB signalling pathways.
  Activation of RAS/MEK/ERK pathway (shown in green) through its downstream effector
  proteins (c-myc, CREB) leads to increased cell proliferation and migration. PI3k/AKT/mTORC
  pathway (shown in blue) activation enhances the cellular translation by targeting
  S6K1 and ribosomal synthesis. PTEN, a mTOR pathway inhibitor is present in decreased
  amount in ccRCC. However, Galectin1, mTOR pathway enhancer, has an increased expression.
  Apart from this, both the pathways also increase HIF-α, thus promoting tumor progression.
  NF-κB pathway is also activated by TGF-α which further enhances tumor growth and
  inflammation. Also, reactivation of sonic hedgehog signalling (SHH) pathway, (through
  its effectors Smo and Gli proteins) results in increased cell proliferation and
  migration. Besides the above pathways, increased MMPs, found in ccRCC matrix, cleaves
  HAVCR/KIM-1 protein, expressed on tumor cell surface. Globular KIM-1 binds to its
  receptor and activated IL6 production which on binding to its receptor (gp80) activated
  the STAT3 signalling pathway. STAT3 apart from directly activating tumor promoter
  genes also binds cooperatively to HIF-α to enhance the production of HIF-α target
  genes. GRIM19, a STAT3 inhibitor (which binds STAT3 and restricts it to the perinuclear
  space), is also downregulated in ccRCC. MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase),
  RAS (rat sarcoma), MEK (MAP/ERK kinase), ERK (extracellular receptor kinase), MNK
  (MAPK-interacting protein kinase), CREB (cAMP response element binding protein),
  PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase), AKT also known as protein kinase B (PKB),
  mTORC (mammalian target of rapamycin complex), PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue),
  HIF (hypoxia inducible factor), NFκB (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer
  of activated B cells), Smo (smoothened), Gli (glioma associated oncogene), MMP (matrix
  metalloproteinase), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3),
  HAVCR/KIM-1 (Hepatitis A virus receptor/kidney injury molecule1), GRIM19 (gene associated
  with retinoid interferon induced mortality 19)
