caption: THP-1 cells activated with a TLR2 agonist activated the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling
  cascade to induce production of TNF. Histamine produced by L. reuteri 6475 engaged
  the H2 receptor on activated THP-1 cells. This G protein-coupled receptor activated
  adenylate cyclase (AC) to increase intracellular cAMP, which subsequently activated
  protein kinase A (PKA). PKA inhibited MEK/ERK activation and suppressed production
  of TNF. It was predicted that PKA inhibited MEK/ERK activation by inhibiting the
  activity of c-Raf. Specific H2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine, prevented
  histamine from activating the H2 receptor and blocked TNF suppression by histamine.
  H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA, prevented TNF suppression by histamine, demonstrating
  that PKA activity was necessary for histamine's effect on TNF. Blocking MEK activity
  with U0126 suppressed activation of ERK and downstream TNF production, demonstrating
  that ERK activation was necessary for production of TNF.
