caption: Roles of Nrf2 in viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease and liver fibrosis.
  HCV core protein and NS5A protein induce mitochondrial dysfunction, CYP2E1 and NOX
  expression in hepatocytes producing large amounts of ROS. HCV core protein and NS5A
  protein also induce Nrf2 phosphorylation, resulting in up-regulation of HO-1 and
  NQO1 which alleviate HCV. However, HCV could cause sMAF to delocalize and connect
  with extranuclear NS3, and then bind to Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, preventing Nrf2 from
  entering the nucleus. SFN, celastrol and caffeic acid can up-regulate the expression
  of HO-1 through the Nrf2-associated pathway to inhibit HCV viral replication. The
  HBx protein of HBV can induce intense stimulation of Nrf2. At the same time, HBV
  enhances the reciprocity between p62 and Keap1, forming a HBx-p62-Keap1 complex
  in the cytoplasm, prompting the dissociation of Keap1-Nrf2, which contributes to
  activation of Nrf2. Oxidative damage products, dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and pristimerin
  increase the expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, significantly enhancing the transcriptional
  expression of the HO-1 alleviating AIH. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) enhances the
  activation of Nrf2 in liver cells of PBC patients, increasing TRX and TrxR1 protein
  which alleviate PBC. Huangqi Decoction (HQD) up-regulates the expression of Nrf2
  for alleviating PSC. ROS is one of the activating factors of hepatic stellate cells
  (HSC). It also promotes the activation of Nrf2 which suppresses HSC. Andrographolide
  and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) can significantly ameliorate the stimulation of HSC
  by enhancing Nrf2 and increasing the expression of antioxidant proteins. The damage
  of sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) during acute liver injury can aggravate the
  oxidative stress response and activate HSC to promote liver fibrosis. The increase
  of p62 level caused by impaired autophagy will trigger the stimulation of Nrf2 and
  the up-regulation of its target gene, alleviating liver fibrosis. AIH, autoimmune
