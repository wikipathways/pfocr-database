caption: Pathogen responses linked to autophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Autophagy
  plays crucial roles in the defense against both intracellular and extracellular
  pathogens in the nematode C. elegans. The microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii
  is targeted for ubiquitination and recruitment of Atg8/LGG-1, which likely results
  in xenophagy. Replication of Salmonella enterica is restricted by localization to
  lysosomes. Staphylococcus aureus and the Bacillus thuringiensis pore-forming toxin
  Cry5B both induce transcription of autophagy-related genes via TFEB/HLH-30. Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa-induced necrosis of C. elegans is reduced by activation of autophagy
  through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Autophagy (mitophagy) also clears mitochondria
  damaged by the P. aeruginosa virulence factor pyoverdine, thereby reducing mortality.
  See text for details and  for autophagy genes linked to immunity in C. elegans.
