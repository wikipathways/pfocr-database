caption: Genes regulated by ME mapped to the pre-existing signaling pathway based
  on IPA-modified gene networks and previous literature. The names of up-regulated
  genes are written in white characters on a black background, those of down-regulated
  genes are written in black characters on a gray background, and those of unaltered
  genes are written in black characters on a white background. The genes and pathways
  related to lipid metabolism (cholesterol-trafficking), protein synthesis and inflammatory
  response that were up-regulated by ME might be a key to the process of enhancing
  hippocampal function through increased AHN.
