caption: List of co-expressed genes with Solute carrier 35A2 (SLC35A2) co-expressed
  in BRCA database was analyzed using a MetaCore enrichment pathway analysis. The
  strategy was to compile lists of the top 10% expressed genes from both the METABRIC
  (2000 genes) and Pan-Cancer (1800 genes) prior to overlapping them to create a total
  gene list of 1201. The gene list was taken from TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas and METABRIC
  BRCA patient databases while the pathway list was organized by the −log[p-value].
  When doing the biological process analysis, the route “Cell cycle_Involvement of
  APC in cell cycle regulation” was at the top of the list.
