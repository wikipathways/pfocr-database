caption: Proposed model of NF-κB and GR-regulated miRNAs in the treatment of muscular
  dystrophy. In DMD, inflammatory signaling promotes the chronic activation of NF-κB.
  This, in turn, activates NF-κB gene targets, including miRNAs that regulate the
  expression of proteins in the NF-κB signaling pathway, creating a chronic inflammatory
  feedback loop. Here we show that the NF-κB-regulated miRNAs miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p,
  miR-146a, miR-301a, miR-455-3p, miR-455-5p, miR-497, and miR-652 are all elevated
  in dystrophic muscle. These NF-κB-regulated miRNAs are all effectively decreased
  by both vamorolone (Vam) and prednisone (Pred) treatment, via the GR. miR-324-3p,
  a miRNA that activates NF-κB in a positive feedback loop, is also decreased by both
  drugs. Acting through a separate pathway which can be selectively avoided by dissociative
  steroid chemistries, prednisone also directly causes GR-mediated transactivation
  of gene transcription. This results in elevated levels of a miRNA cluster located
  on chromosome 14q32. These microRNAs are associated with steroid side effects such
  as insulin resistance, hypertension, stress, and mood disturbances. Blue lines, pathways
  affected by vamorolone; red lines, pathways affected by prednisolone. DMD, Duchenne
  muscular dystrophy; GR, glucocorticoid receptor.
