caption: Schematic of the beta-cell signaling pathways and hypothetical role of GHRHR.
  Arrows indicate activation or an increase in concentration. The line ending with
  a bar indicates inhibition or closure. Glucose metabolism increases the ATP/ADP
  ratio, leading to the closure of KATP channels, reduction of K+ efflux, membrane
  depolarization, increase of intracellular Ca2+, and insulin secretion. Glucose also
  leads to insulin secretion through amplifying pathways that are independent of KATP
  channels. Carbachol stimulation enhanced insulin secretion via the acetylcholine
  (muscarinic) receptor and phospholipase C pathways. IP3 is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate,
  DAG is diacylglycerol. As depicted, GLP-1 and GHRH both enhance insulin secretion
  via the cAMP pathway.
