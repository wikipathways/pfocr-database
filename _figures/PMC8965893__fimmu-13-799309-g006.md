caption: 'Cofilin involves in T cell signaling. Several signaling pathways in T cells
  contain cofilin, including: (A) PLC-PIP2 pathway belonging to the TCR signaling,
  (B) protein phosphorylation belonging to co-stimulation signaling, and (C) protein
  oxidation. Activated cofilin can mediate actin entry into the nucleus and play a
  regulatory role in gene transcription. PP1/PP2A: protein serine/threonine phosphatases
  of type 1 and type 2A, ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
