caption: Shown is the α2- and β-AR coupling to AC in cells of the non-pregnant (upper
  panel) and pregnant myometrium (lower panel). Catecholamines are the physiological
  AR ligands which act simultaneously through receptors coupled to stimulatory (s)
  and inhibitory (i) G proteins. The thickness and position of arrows between G protein
  subunits and AC indicate the predominant effect and the subunit involved in the
  respective signal transduction pathway. Note that the G proteins must bind GTP and
  dissociate before they become active.
