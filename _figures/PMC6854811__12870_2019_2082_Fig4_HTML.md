  activities (capital letters next to arrows) and metabolic products are indicated.
  Main anthocyanins and flavones detected by HPLC-DAD-MSn are in boxes with red, green
  and yellow letters for compounds found in petals, photosynthetic tissues or both,
  respectively. The biosynthetic route was divided into early and late halves using
  a dotted line based on genes involved in the synthesis of upstream (flavones) and
  downstream (anthocyanins) products of the biosynthetic pathway. CHS: chalcone synthase;

  flavanone-3-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
