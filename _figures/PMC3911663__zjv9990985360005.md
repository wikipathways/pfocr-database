caption: Summary model for rAdV DNA sensing. Following endosomal entry of rAdV into
  the cell (lower left), viral DNA can trigger the TLR9 pathway, which through the
  MyD88 adaptor leads to activation of IRF7 and IRF5 but not IRF3. Alternatively,
  adenovirus escapes the endosome, revealing virus and viral DNA complexes to the
  cytosolic compartment. An array of DNA sensors are available to bind viral DNA;
  one DNA sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), has been shown to influence the
  antiviral response to adenovirus infection in murine endothelial and macrophage
  cell lines. DNA engagement by cGAS results in production of a unique cGAMP containing
  2′5′ and 3′5 linkages that bind to the adaptor STING and leads to TBK1 activation.
  Active TBK1 mediates C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF3. IRF3 dimerizes, translocates
  to the nucleus (indicated by the double-line structure), and associates with transcription
  units (IFN-β or ISG15, -54, and -56). In collaboration with additional transcription
  factors (NF-κB, ATF/cJUN), gene expression is induced. AIM2 and p204 are Hin-200
  proteins that complex with ASC through pyrin domains to form an inflammasome complex,
  leading to secretion of IL-1 and IL-18. DNA template present either in the cytosol
  or in the nucleus can be transcribed. Small viral RNAs have been implicated in stimulating
  the antiviral response through activation of RNA sensors (MDA-5 and RIG-I) which
  in turn complex with IPS (MAVS) and activate TBK1.
