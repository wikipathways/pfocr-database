caption: When cells are stressed by various stimuli, which lead to escape of nuclear
  or mitochondrial DNA to the cytosol, the cGAS STING pathway is activated, followed
  by degradation of STING by autophagy. Normal cells also harbor DNAses that degrade
  cytosolic DNA. During aging, the expression of these DNAses decrease, leading to
  a build-up of extranuclear DNA. Moreover, compromised autophagy delays clearance
  of activated STING and other cell debris, leading to further accumulation of cytosolic
  DNA, further amplifying the cycle and leading to heightened inflammation.
