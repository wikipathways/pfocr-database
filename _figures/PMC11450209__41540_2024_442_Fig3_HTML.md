caption: The Proteins tab displays all interactions of a selected protein. a Interactions
  of the kinase BRAF. Outgoing edges point to proteins phosphorylated by BRAF, such
  as MAP2Ks and non-kinases EEF1As and SLC9A1. Incoming edges indicate kinases that
  phosphorylate BRAF such as AKTs as well as downstream MAPKs. b Interactions of the
  non-kinase SLC9A1. Incoming edges indicate interactions with multiple kinases such
  as BRAF, AKT1 and ROCK1. The Custom protein sets tab lets the user specify any set
  of proteins within which to visualize interactions. The user can expand the network
  by selecting the option to include proteins adjacent to the selected set. c EGFR-INSR
  crosstalk. A custom set of proteins focused on overlap between EGFR and INSR pathways.
  d Comparing RAF kinases. The expanded network for the custom set of BRAF and RAF1
  can be used to elucidate their shared versus exclusive interactions. e Comparing
  EEF1A proteins. The expanded network for the custom set of EEF1A1 and EEF1A2 shows
  the differences in the interactions they have with various kinases
