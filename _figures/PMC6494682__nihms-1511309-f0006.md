caption: 'aKetamine blockade of NMDA receptors located on GABAergic interneurons results
  in disinhibition and a rapid but transient glutamate burst that activates AMPA receptors.
  This leads to stimulation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) and
  influx of Ca2+ that stimulates VEGF release, which stimulates Flk-1 signaling, including
  activation of mTORC1 pathway. The mTORC1 pathway controls the translation and synthesis
  of synaptic proteins, including GluA1 and PSD95, which are required for increases
  in synaptogenesis and spine maturation. These cellular events are associated with
  the rapid and sustained antidepressant actions of ketamine. Previous studies demonstrate
  that BDNF release also plays an essential role in the rapid and sustained actions
  of ketamine (see ). Abbreviations: VDCC, voltage dependent calcium channel; NMDA,
  N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor; GluA1, subtype of AMPA receptor; PSD95, postsynaptic density protein
  95; Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 1; VEGF nAb, VEGF neutralizing antibody; ADT, antidepressant.'
