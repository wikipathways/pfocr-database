caption: 'A separate set of CA and NC lung tissue slices from UK131 was treated with
  40 μg/mL Pembro plus 13C5,15N2-Gln (13C515N2Q) for 24 hr before extraction and analysis
  for polar metabolites as in . Diagram in (A) depicts the glutaminolytic production
  of 13C-Glu and release into the medium, 13C5-Glu transformation through the Krebs
  cycle, and 13C3-pyruvate/lactate production from the malic enzyme (ME) pathway,
  13C-itaconate production from c-aconitate (c-Acon), Trp uptake and oxidation to
  quinolinate (QA) as well as unlabeled lactate production from glucose (Glc) via
  glycolysis. The diagram in (B) traces atom-resolved transformation of 13C5,15N2-Gln
  through the Krebs cycle (both PDH-  and PCB  -initiated) and ME () pathway. Panels
  (a, b) in (A) were obtained from 1D HSQC analysis while the rest of all panels from
  IC-UHR-FTMS analysis. Numbers in X-axis denote those of 13C while x indicates 1–2
