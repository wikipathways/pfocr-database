caption: Models for the effects of fluoxetine on C. elegans behaviors. A, MOD-5 CeSERT
  acts upstream of the MOD-1 5-HT-gated chloride channel and the GOA-1 G-protein.B,
  The potentiating effect of low concentrations of fluoxetine on the enhanced slowing
  response is 5-HT- and MOD-5 CeSERT-dependent. The stimulus of food in a food-deprived
  animal results in the release of 5-HT. This 5-HT acts through the MOD-1 5-HT-gated
  chloride channel and through a GOA-1-dependent 5-HT signaling pathway, which likely
  acts in parallel to the MOD-1 pathway. Together, these two pathways result in the
  slowing of the locomotory rate. Mutation in mod-5 or application of fluoxetine leads
  to inefficient clearing of 5-HT and thus a hyperenhanced slowing response. 5-HT

  chloride ions. C, The effects of high concentrations of fluoxetine on egg laying,
  nose contraction, and paralysis are MOD-5 CeSERT-independent. High concentrations
  of fluoxetine act on non-SERT targets and on a non-5-HT pathway to paralyze C. elegans
  and to lead to the contraction of nose muscles. By contrast, stimulation of egg
  laying by fluoxetine is MOD-5 CeSERT-independent but still partially dependent on
  5-HT (for details, see Discussion).
