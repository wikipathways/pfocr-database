caption: Proposed model of the cardiac sarcostat. In this model, mRNA and proteins
  are located in stoichiometric excess, in vicinity of the sarcomere, as a myocytoplasmic
  pool. As most sarcomeric proteins are highly insoluble and aggregate prone, concerted
  action of a variety of sarcomeric chaperones (in green letters) and chaperone associated
  sarcomeric proteins (in red letters) is required to ensure normal sarcomere structure
  and function. These chaperones also appear to be integral to sarcomere assembly
  as well as repair and maintenance of sarcomeric proteins, in situ. When the damaged
  proteins are detected (often due to exposure of kinase sites) by the “sarcostat
  damage sensing mechanism,” the proteins are removed from the sarcomere (via sarcomeric
  calpains) and returned to the myocytoplasmic reserve pool. When sarcomeric proteins
  acquire unfolded states due to nascent status, or are misfolded as a result of synthetic
  errors or due to damage, sarcostat chaperones assist in their refolding and in enabling
  dynamic equilibrium between the sarcomere-associated and the reserve pools. The
  proteins that are beyond the capacity of the refolding mechanism or require to be
  stored in the anticipation of continued stress, undergo aggregation under the action
  of Bag3, CryAB, and p62. As a result of liquid-liquid phase transition, these proteins
  and their cognate chaperones remain outside the osmotic load of the cell, stacked
  in a compact arrangement due to their intrinsic disordered domains (IDRs). These
  aggregates can be a source to release protein back in to the myocytoplasmic pool
  and, thus, the sarcomere. Normal lysosomal function and, possibly mitochondrial
  aggregate uptake (via a pathway termed as “MAGIC,” see text), result in continuous
  flux of these aggregates. In addition, normal proteolysis of isolated proteins occurs
  via the ubiquitin proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. During
  states when the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is inhibited, proteins are diverted
  into storage as protein aggregates or for degradation via the autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway. As many disease states also result in lysosomal dysfunction, the accumulation
  of the protein aggregates accompanies failure of the sarcostat. In these states,
  upregulation of the sarcostat protein degradation machinery (both UPS and ALP),
  results in improved sarcomeric protein quality, while concurrently increasing aggregate
  removal.
