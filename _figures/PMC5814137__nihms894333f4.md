caption: Heterocellular nutrient symbiosis in the tumor microenvironment.Tumor-associated
  stromal cell populations engage in cooperative metabolic processes with cancer cells
  in the tumor microenvironment. Ovarian cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) have
  been reported to provide cysteine (Cys) and reduced glutathione (GSH) to combat
  oxidative stress, a process blocked by T effector (Teff) cells. Ovarian CAFs also
  provide the cancer cells with glutamine (Gln) and utilize cancer cell-derived lactate
  (Lac) and glutamate (Glu) to regenerate Gln. In pancreatic cancer, CAFs provide
  the cancer cells with alanine (Ala) in an autophagy dependent manner. Similarly,
  breast CAFs provide the cancer cells with autophagy-derived dipeptides. CAF-derived
  exosomes are another means of nutrient transfer and provide nutrient cargo to prostate
  and pancreatic cancer cells. Cells of the adipocyte lineage have been reported to
  provide pancreatic cancer cells with Gln, ovarian and breast cancer cells with fatty
  acids, and to engage in an arginine (Arg) cycling pathway by way of citrulline (Cit)
  to activate nitric oxide (NO) production and subsequently glycolysis in the cancer
  cells. Mesenchymal stem cells have been reported to shuttle mitochondria and/or
  mitochondrial DNA in leukemia, lung and breast cancer, and to consume the cysteine
  (Cys) dimer cystine and provide leukemic cells with chemoprotective Cys.
