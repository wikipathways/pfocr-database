caption: The proposed working model. (A) Upon DNA damage, PARP1 is recruited to DNA
  lesions and is rapidly activated to catalyze PARylation of MORC2 using NAD+ as substrate.
  PARylation of MORC2 enhances its chromatin remodeling activities, thereby promoting
  efficient DNA repair. (B) MORC2 mediates the interaction between PARP1 and NAT10
  and thereby promotes NAT10-mediated PARP1 acetylation at K949, which blocks CHFR-mediated
  ubiquitination and degradation of PARP1. Consequently, MORC2 regulates DNA damage-induced
  PAR production at the DNA damage sites and subsequent PAR-dependent recruitment
  of DNA repair proteins with specific PAR-binding motifs (such as XRCC1) to DNA lesions
  in response to DNA damage; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
