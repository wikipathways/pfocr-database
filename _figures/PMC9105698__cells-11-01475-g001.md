caption: 'Scheme of the pathways associated with NRLP3 inflammasome activation and
  mitochondrial dysfunction. PAMPs and DAMPs are recognized by TLR, as priming signal,
  and activate NF-κB signaling pathway, promoting the transcription of pro-IL-1β and
  NLRP3, while an activation signal initiates the formation of NLRP3/ASC/pro-caspase-1
  complex. Subsequently, the active form of caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β to mature
  IL-1β and GSDMD into a N-terminal fragment (N-GSDMD). N-GSDMD produces pores in
  the membrane, allowing the release of IL-1β into the extracellular space. The mechanisms
  involved in NLRP3 activation include: the destabilization of the ion outflow (K+
  efflux/Ca2+ influx) creating holes in the cell membrane; the release of ROS by damaged
  mitochondria produced by excessive electron flow; an inhibited mitophagy and mtDNA
  oxidation; and the release of cathepsins by damaged lysosomes. The NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex activation is located in MAMs, where cardiolipin translocation and Ca2+
  influx by VDAC occurs, and facilitates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ASC,
  adaptor apoptosis speck protein; DAMPS, damage-associated molecular patterns; GSDMD,
  gasdermin D; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; MAM, mitochondria-associated membranes; NF-kB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, toll-like receptor.'
