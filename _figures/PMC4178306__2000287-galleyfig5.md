caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between mechanical stress and
  the expression of PGE2 and related molecules. Cyclic compressive loading on a 3D
  cultured construct of human fibroblasts upregulated PGE2, interleukin- (IL-)6 and
  IL-8 proteins and COX-2, mPGES-1 mRNA levels without IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor-
  (TNF)-α stimulation. These results indicate that PGE2 upregulation may not be induced
  via an IL-1β and/or a TNF-α signaling pathway but via other signaling pathways (S.I.;
  selective inhibitor, Dex; dexamethasone).
