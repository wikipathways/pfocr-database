caption: Astrocytes (top left, green) secrete apolipoprotein E (APOE) 2 and 3 that
  bind to pericyte lipoprotein LRP1 receptor (bottom, orange) to inhibit downstream
  CypA-NFκB-MMP-9 pathway. In contrast, APOE4 binds weakly to LRP1, which activates
  the pro-inflammatory CypA-NFκB-MMP-9 cascade leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB)
  breakdown. Astrocyte intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) increases in response
  to neuronal factors, for example glutamate, which promotes phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated
  arachidonic acid (AA) generation. In astrocytes, AA is metabolized into prostaglandin
  E2 PGE2) via cyclooxtgenase-1 (Cox1), as well as into epoxyeicosotrienoic acids
  (EET) via cytochrome P450. Astrocytic AA is metabolized into 20-HETE in mural cells
  via membrane-bound cytochrome P450 4A, which promotes pericyte contraction. PGE2
  from astrocytes binds to pericyte EP4 receptor, which alters K+ conductance and
  promotes pericyte relaxation. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by neurons inhibits cytochrome
  P450 in astrocytes and cytochrome P450 4A in pericytes to prevent AA to EET and
  AA to 20-HETE metabolism, respectively. In pericytes, increased cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) signals via protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit myosin light
  chain (MLC) phosphorylation and prevent pericyte contraction. Additionally, pericyte
  [Ca2+]i increases in response to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Increased [Ca2+]i in pericytes is shown to promote contraction, possibly
  via downstream signaling through calmodulin (CaM) and MLC kinase (MLCK) which phosphorylates
  MLC to induce contraction, as shown in VSMCs. Conversely, decreasing [Ca2+]i in
  pericytes inhibits Ca2+-gated Cl- channels which promotes relaxation. Furthermore,
  neurotransmitters promote pericyte, relaxation (e.g., glutamate, dopamine, and adenosine)
  or contraction (e.g., norepinephrine). For example, adenosine signals through adenosine
  A1 and A2 receptors (A1R, A2R) on pericytes to alter K+ conductance and promote
  pericyte relaxation.
