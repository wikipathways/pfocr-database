caption: 'A mechanistic model for irradiation-dependent and GSK3β-related signaling
  in HNSCC cells: Activated and inactivated molecules are displayed in green and in
  red, respectively. A: In non-irradiated HNSCC tumor cells, mTOR is phosphorylated
  at Ser2448, which stabilizes mTORC1 and leads to phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase.
  Activated p70S6 kinase phosphorylates Sin1 at Thr86 and Thr398, thus destabilizing
  mTORC2 with subsequent dissociation and de-phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473. Because
  inactivation of either AKT, ERK, or p38 MAPK is sufficient for reactivating GSK3β
  function, β-catenin and FAK were able to be phosphorylated. B: In contrast, radiation
  leads to a loss of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 and of p70S6K at Thr389, resulting
  in dephosphorylation of Sin1 at its threonine residues. Dephosphorylated Sin1 stabilizes
  mTORC2, mediating AKT activation at Ser473. This AKT activation leads to phosphorylation
  of Sin1 at Ser385 via a feedback loop. The AKT pathway is (besides the ERK and p38
  MAPK pathways) one of the three pathways that collectively mediate tumor cell migration
  via GSK3β inhibition.'
