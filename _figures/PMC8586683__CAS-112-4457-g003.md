caption: Schematic drawing for the mechanism of chemokine C‐C motif ligand 21 (CCL21)
  synergistic with programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) blockade. CCL21 in the tumor
  microenvironment can promote infiltration of T cells and enhance their antitumor
  immune response. However, CCL21 also stabilizes and upregulates PD‐L1 expression
  on pancreatic cancer cells through the AKT‐glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β)
  signaling pathway at the same time, which could partly impair the local immune response.
  Thus, PD‐L1 blockade was undertaken in combination with CCL21, which showed a powerful
  synergism and promising therapeutic efficacy. CCR7, CC‐chemokine receptor 7
