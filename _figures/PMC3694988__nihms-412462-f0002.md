caption: MAPK signaling transduction in mammalian cells. Activation of MAPK is regulated
  by hierarchical cascade known as the MAPK module. Mitogens such as growth factors,
  cytokines, and environmental stress typically activate MAP3Ks, subsequently resulting
  in phosphorylation of MAP2Ks. Phosphorylated MAP2Ks activate terminal MAPKs such
  as Erk1/2, p38, and JNK/SAPK through phosphorylating specific threonine (T) and
  tyrosine (Y) residues of T-X-Y motif. Several downstream targets of MAPKs including
  p90RSK and transcription factors such as Elk-1, MEF-2, ATF-2, and c-JUN are specifically
  activated and resulted in subsequent diverse cellular events, including cell survival,
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The exposure to chemopreventive dietary
  phytochemicals can activate MAPK pathway, leading to gene expression, apoptotic
  cell death and differentiation of cancer cells.
