caption: 'Differences in the immune response of each volunteer after QIV vaccination.
  (A) Total immune-related BP (p-value< 0.05) of everyone by DAVID. The differential
  proteins(fold change > 2 or< 0.5, p-value<0.05) were obtained by self-contrasted
  method individually (comparison including: T1-T0, T2-T0, T3-T0, T4-T0, T5-T0; T1-T0,
  T2-T1, T3-T2, T4-T3, T5-T4). (B) Significantly changed proteins (fold change > 2
  or< 0.5, p-value<0.05) in T1 compared T0 was enriched by omicsbean, and their up/down-regulate
  and PPI were different. Network nodes and edges represent proteins and protein–protein
  associations. Green/red solid lines represent inhibition/activation; gray dotted
  lines represent GO pathways. Color bar from red to green represents the fold change
  of protein level from increasing to decreasing. The significance of the pathways
  represented by −log(p value) (Fisher’s exact test) was shown by color scales with
  dark blue as most significant. (C) Venn diagram of the significantly changed proteins
  (fold change > 2 or< 0.5, p-value<0.05) obtained by the two comparison methods at
  all different time points for each vaccine recipients. The proteins and their fold
  change to obtain the overall immune system profile of each person by STRING and
  omicsbean. These pathway p-value were adjusted.'
