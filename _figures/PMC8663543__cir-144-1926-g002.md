caption: Reaction scheme of the metabolic model. Arrows symbolize reactions and transport
  processes between compartments. A, Glycogen metabolism, (B) glycolysis, (C) oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, (D) nonoxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway, (E) triglyceride synthesis, (F) synthesis and degradation
  of lipid droplets, (G) tricarbonic acid cycle, (H) respiratory chain and oxidative
  phosphorylation, (I) β-oxidation of fatty acids, (J) ketone body utilization, (K)
  glutamate metabolism, (L) mitochondrial electrophysiology (membrane transport of
  ions), and (M) utilization of branched-chain amino acids. Small cylinders and cubes
  symbolize ion channels and ion transporters. Double arrows indicate reversible reactions,
  which, according to the value of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and cellular
  concentrations of their reactants, may proceed in both directions. Reactions are
  labeled by the short names of the catalyzing enzyme or membrane transporter given
  in the small boxes attached to the reactions arrow. Metabolites are denoted by their
  short names. Full names and kinetic rate laws of reaction rates are outlined in
  Supplement S1. Full names of metabolites and a comparison of experimentally determined
  and calculated cellular metabolite concentrations are given in Table S1.
