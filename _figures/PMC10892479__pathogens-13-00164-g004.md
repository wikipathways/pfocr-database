caption: 'Cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 proteins (ORF7a, ORF3A, M, and N proteins)
  mediated by the activation of NF-kB. The structural viral proteins (M and N proteins)
  and predicted accessory viral proteins (ORF3a and ORF7a proteins) activate the NFκB
  signaling pathway. Among the 4 viral proteins, ORF7a is the most potent activator
  of proinflammatory cytokines, whose expression is mediated by NFκB activation. Cytokines
  such as IL-3, IL-4, and IL-7 were also upregulated by ORF7a. In addition, ORF7a
  promotes the expression of chemokines. The over-expression of cytokines further
  activates the NFκB pathway, resulting in the SARS-CoV-induced cytokine storm. *
  Significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. ** Overexpression of cytokines further
  enhances NFκB activation. NFκB: Nuclear factor kappa B; ORF7a: Open-reading frame
