caption: The IL‐6/gp130/JAK2/STAT3‐pathway mediates sepsis‐induced muscle atrophy.
  IL‐6 plasma levels are increased in critically ill human patients and mice with
  polymicrobial sepsis. IL‐6 acts on myocytes via the gp130 and IL‐6Rα‐complex and
  activates JAK2‐ and STAT3‐signalling, which leads to an increased expression of
  SOCS3. SOCS3 functions as a negative regulator of cytokine signalling and inhibits
  the growth promoting insulin/insulin‐receptor/Akt pathway by degradation of IRS‐1.
  Reduction of IRS‐1 is paralleled by a decreased Akt‐activity that results in a reduced
  protein synthesis and an increased protein degradation, which eventually mediate
  muscle atrophy. Inhibition of IL‐6/gp130 signalling by IL6st‐knockdown (e.g. Il6st
  siRNA and Il6st cKO), JAK2 (e.g. AG490), or STAT3 inhibition (e.g. C188‐9 and S3i‐201)
  prevents IL‐6‐induced SOCS3 expression as well as myocyte atrophy in vitro and skeletal
  muscle atrophy in vivo. Red arrows indicate changes related to increased IL‐6 plasma
  levels. Fbxo32 indicates F‐box protein 32; Gp130, glycoprotein 130; IRS‐1, insulin
