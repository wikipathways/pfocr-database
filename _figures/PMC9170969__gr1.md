caption: Inhibition of IFN production or functions by African swine fever virus (ASFV).
  ASFV proteins are shown in red ellipses. ASFV pMGF360-12L competitively binds nuclear
  transport protein KPNA2, KPNA3 and KPNA4 with NF-κB, thereby inhibiting NF-κB nuclear
  translocation and IFN-β production. pMGF360-15R (pA276R) suppresses IFN-β expression
  by targeting IRF3. pI329L competes with TLR3 for adaptor protein TRIF to inhibit
  IFN-I production. pDP96R affects cGAS/STING-mediated NF-κB signaling by blocking
  the activation of TBK1 and IKKβ. pE120R interacts with IRF3 and interferes with
  the recruitment of IRF3 to TBK1, which in turn suppresses IRF3 phosphorylation to
  decrease IFN-β production. pI215L interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF138 and
  promotes RNF138 to degrade RNF128, which results in reduced K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of TBK1 and IFNβ production. pMGF505-7R facilitates STING degradation by promoting
  the expression of ULK1 and blocks IRF3 nuclear translocation to negatively regulate
  cGAS-STING signaling pathway. In addition, pMGF505-7R also inhibits IFN-γ signaling
  pathway by suppressing JAK1 and JAK2.
