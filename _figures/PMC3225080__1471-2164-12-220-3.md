caption: 'Transcript abundance of genes encoding enzymes in the pathway of starch
  and sucrose metabolism as represented by KEGG. Relative transcript abundance of
  genes encoding enzymes in the pathway at 12 dai compared to uninfected control overlaid
  as colors in the boxes containing the enzyme commission (EC) number of the enzyme.
  Enzymes colored in green are encoded by up-regulated genes. Boxes colored in red
  represent down-regulated genes. Boxes colored in yellow represent a gene family
  and different gene members are up- and down-regulated, respectively. The blue arrows
  point to pectin esterase [EC: 3.1.1.11] and cellulose synthase [EC: 2.41.12]. The
  blue arrows point to pectin esterase [EC: 3.1.1.11] and cellulose synthase [EC:
  2.41.12].'
