caption: Metabolic pathways are at the nexus of all cellular function. Signaling through
  the central dogma of genes, transcripts, and proteins leads to metabolic pathway
  regulation. However, it is not always appreciated that metabolism also has a direct
  effect on posttranslational modifications, epigenetics, and consequently, on many
  complex biological processes (albeit, less well understood than the flow from genes
  to metabolic pathways).
