caption: Schematic representation of CD157-mediated survival in AML cells. CD157 binding
  to fibronectin in AML cells promotes structural and functional interaction of CD157
  with specific integrins. This activates intracellular signals leading to phosphorylation
  of AKT, mTOR and its downstream substrates p70S6K, pS6 ribosomal protein, 4E-BP1,
  and ERK. In turn, phosphorylated AKT inactivates its major target GSK-3β, which
  loses its pro-apoptotic function and favors the stabilization of Mcl-1. The increased
  expression of Mcl-1 strengthens its ability to sequester Bim and Bak, thus precluding
  the Bak/Bax oligomerization at the mitochondrial outer membrane, which is required
  for cytochrome c release and is considered a key step in apoptosis. S63845 binds
  to the BH3-binding groove of Mcl-1 releasing Bim and Bak and enabling the activation
  of the Bax/Bak-dependent apoptotic pathway. This results in outer mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol leading to
  activation of the caspase cascade.
