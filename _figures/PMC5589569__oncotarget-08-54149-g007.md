caption: (A) Following a variety of stimuli that remain to be better delineated (stressors?
  Signaling pathways?), HSF1 is induced in liver cancer cells, where it sustains the
  activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade. This leads to metabolic reprogramming of
  liver cancer cells, due to the induction of de novo lipogenesis and glycolysis,
  which support their unconstrained proliferation and survival. (B) Inactivation of
  HSF1 by overexpression of a dominant negative form (HSF1dn) or specific inhibitors
  results in the suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thus inhibiting aberrant
  lipogenesis and glycolysis with consequent apoptosis and growth restraint of liver
  cancer cells.
