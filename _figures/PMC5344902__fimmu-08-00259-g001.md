caption: Pattern recognition receptor signaling that leads to the induction of type
  I interferons (IFNs). The endosomally expressed TLR-3, -7, -8, and -9, cell surface
  expressed TLR4, the RLRs [retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG)-I and MDA-5], and
  cGAMP synthase (cGAS) can couple pathogen detection to type I IFN induction. TLR3
  and TLR4 signal via TRIF, which occurs through inhibitor of kappa-B (IκB) kinases
  (IKKs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family associated
  NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), and IKK-ɛ. This causes the activation
  of IRF3, which in turn induces the expression of type I IFNs. The activation of
  TLR3 can also induce the production of inflammatory mediators via TRIF by activating
  a complex formed by TRAF-6, TNF receptor type I DEATH domain-associated protein
  (TRADD), Pellino-1, and the receptor-interacting kinase (RIP)-1. This causes the
  activation of NF-κB pathway, which is mediated by the IKK complex and transforming
  growth factor beta activated kinase (TAK)-1. TLR7, 8, and 9 use MyD88 for downstream
  signaling and can activate IRF and NF-κB pathways. RIG-I and MDA5 signal through
  the adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). cGAS signals
  via the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING). MAVS and STING further
  recruit signaling molecules (involving the IKK complex, TBK1, and several TRAF proteins)
  and lead to the activation of NF-κB and IRF3, resulting in gene expression of various
  antiviral cytokines including type I IFNs (–).
