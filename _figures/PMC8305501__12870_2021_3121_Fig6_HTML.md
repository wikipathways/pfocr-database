caption: Metabolites and genes associated with the flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis
  pathways were analyzed using metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches. Heat maps
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in transcripts in flavonoid and anthocyanin
  biosynthesis. CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, naringenin 3-dioxygenase;
  FLS, flavonoid 3’-monooxygenase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; UFGT, UDP glucose-flavonoid 3–0-glucosyltransferase. Differential metabolites
  associated with anthocyanin synthesis are represented in the red box under the dark
  (CK), visible light and UV-B radiation treatments
