caption: 'Cartoon depicting the main structural features of the PMCA at resting [Ca2+]i
  (A) and elevated [Ca2+]i (B). The PMCA consists of an N-terminal domain, 10 transmembrane
  domains, 4 cytosolic loops and a regulatory C-terminal domain. When [Ca2+]i is elevated,
  the Ca/CaM binds to the autoinhibitory CaM-binding domain causing a conformational
  change which exposes the catalytic site which consists the ATP-binding sites and
  the aspartate residue that is phosphorylated during the reaction cycle. This increases
  the Ca2+-transporting activity of the PMCA. Reprinted under the Creative Commons
