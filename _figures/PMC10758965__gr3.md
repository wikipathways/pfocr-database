caption: ATF4 is a central transcriptional regulator of SSP in cancer. Schematic representation
  of SSP transcriptional regulation by ATF4. ATF4 is regulated through mTORC1, which
  can be activated by the TGF-β-SMAD3 () and the PKM2–GCN2 () axes, or inhibited by
  PKC (λ/ι) (). ATF4 is also upregulated by MYC (, ) and NRF2 (). KDM4C histone lysine
  demethylase regulates transcription of ATF4 and then binds ATF4 to further upregulate
  the transcription of each of the SSP genes (). Transcriptional upregulation of each
  of the SSP genes (PHGHD, PSAT1, and PSPH) is directly controlled by ATF4 or indirectly
  through ATF3 (). ATF4 regulators are in yellow, and ATF4 target genes are in gray.
