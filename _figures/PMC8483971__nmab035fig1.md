caption: Genetic mutations in hepatic hepcidin signaling pathways. Hepcidin is regulated
  by infection/inflammation (left), iron status (middle), and erythropoietic demand
  (right). Pathogenic mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation
  of the hepcidin or FPN result in iron deficiency (green X) or iron overload (red
  X). When serum transferrin is saturated, diferric-transferrin binds to TFR1 and
  displaces HFE. HFE can then form a complex with TFR2 and possibly HJV to promote
  the BMP-SMAD hepcidin signaling pathway. Recessive mutations in the genes encoding
  these proteins (HFE, TFR2, HJV, hepcidin) result in decreased hepcidin production
  preventing hepcidin from being upregulated as iron stores accumulate leading to
  iron overload. Under low oxygen conditions, MT-2 cleaves HJV, generating a soluble
  and inactive form of this protein, resulting in the inactivation of the BMP-SMAD
  signaling pathway and downregulation of hepcidin transcription. Genetic mutations
  in MT-2 result in uninhibited hepcidin production leading to IRIDA. High erythropoietic
  demand results in upregulation of erythroferrone, which suppresses hepcidin production
  by sequestering BMP6 and inhibiting BMP-SMAD signaling. In inflammation, IL-6 binds
  to IL-6 receptor, stimulating the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulating hepcidin production.
  Dominant gain- and loss-of-function FPN1 mutations result in hepcidin resistance
  or in cellular iron accumulation (particularly in macrophages), respectively. Recessive
  mutations in DMT1 result in iron loading anemia. Likewise, recessive mutations in
  TF result in reduced concentrations of functional TF and iron loading anemia. The
