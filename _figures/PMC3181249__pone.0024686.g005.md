caption: 'Inferences from past , , ,  and these studies are shown. Left (Blue): Degradation
  by an unidentified protease is negatively regulated by integrin based attachment
  complexes which bind to Perlecan in the extracellular matrix. Middle (Pink): Degradation
  by the lysosomes is controlled by a balance of signal from Insulin/Insulin-like
  Receptor (negative regulator, green lines) and autocrine Fibroblast Growth Factor
  signal (positive regulator, red lines). Calcium overload, signalling via CaMKII,
  also promotes lysosome-based degradation. Right (Green): Intra-cellular calcium
  controlled by a combination of membrane depolarization and G-protein signalling
  events is required to negatively regulate proteasome-based degradation. N.B. Genetic
  disruption of the pathway in the left section typically yields dystrophic myofibrils,
  whereas disruption of the pathways in the middle or on the right typically does
  not.'
