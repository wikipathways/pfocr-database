caption: Model of the type III secretion system (T3SS) regulation and modes of action
  of T3SS inhibitors in Dickeya dadantii. The expression of T3SS master regulator
  HrpL is transcriptionally regulated by the HrpX/HrpY-HrpS-RpoN pathway and post-transcriptionally
  regulated by the GacS/GacA-RsmB-RsmA pathway. Several transcriptional regulators,
  including FlhDC, SlyA, PecS, PecT, and RpoS, regulate the expression of T3SS genes
  via targeting multiply key components in the T3SS regulatory pathways. Hfq and its
  dependent sRNA ArcZ form a feed-forward signaling cascade that positively control
  the expression of RsmB. PNPase degrades RsmB sRNA and is also required for the stability
  of rpoN mRNA. c-di-GMP signaling is involved in the FlhDC-mediated RpoN regulation
  and the Hfq-mediated RsmB regulation. T3SS injects bacterial effectors into the
  plant cells to suppress plant immune responses. On the other hand, plants secrete
  a variety of phenolic compounds that are able to regulate the T3SS in bacteria.
  For D. dadantii, two plant phenolic compounds, o-coumaric acid (OCA) and t-cinnamic
  acid (TCA), upregulate T3SS gene expression via the GacS/GacA-RsmB-RsmA-HrpL pathway.
  Trans-4-hydroxycinnamohdroxamic acid (TS103), a plant phenolic compound derivative,
  represses the expression of T3SS via the HrpX/HrpY-HrpS-RpoN-HrpL pathway. ⊥ represents
  negative control; → represents positive control.
