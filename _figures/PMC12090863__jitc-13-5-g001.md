caption: Paclitaxel binds to the MD-2 in an LPS-like manner, directly activating the
  TLR4/TRIF/IRF3 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of type-1 IFN pathway
  in intratumoral myeloid cells and induction of CTL, Th1, and NK cell-attracting
  chemokines (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10 and CXCL11/ITAC; ligands for CXCR3; and CCL5/RANTES,
  ligand for CCR5) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It also promotes local macrophage
  conversion from M2 to M1 phenotype (a process likely to include multiple intermediate
  forms of macrophages), enhancing antigen cross-presentation and CTL-mediated tumor-specific
  immunity. However, paclitaxel/TLR4-activated parallel MyD88 signaling also mobilizes
  the NFκB pathway, which activates the tumor-promoting COX2/PGE2 pathway, which can
  enhance cancer cell survival, vascularization and metastatic potential. The COX2/PGE2-dependent
  suppressive factors such as IL-10, IDO, or VEGF, and chemokines CXCL12/SDF1 and
  CCL22/MDC, which attract myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and T-regulatory
  cells (Tregs), undermine the immunostimulatory effects of paclitaxel by promoting
  local immunosuppression. Paclitaxel-induced cancer cell death and release of additional
  activators of the TLR4/MyD88 and STING/IRF3/IFN pathways result in additional mobilization
  of both the immunostimulatory/antitumor and suppressive/tumor-promoting effects.
  The paper of Choi and colleagues in a recent issue of JITC21 demonstrates the prognostic
  role of the intratumoral activation of type 1 (IFNα/β) and type-2 (IFNγ) pathways
  in paclitaxel-driven sensitization of TNBC to antitumor effectiveness of PD1 blockade
  and the key role of TLR4-dependent M2 and M1 reprogramming in this regard. These
  considerations provide direct rationale for recalibrating the balance between the
  TLR4/MyD88- and STING/IRF3/IFN pathways in paclitaxel-treated tumors, helping to
  design improved modalities of chemo-immunotherapy involving taxanes and potentially
  other chemotherapeutic agents. IFNγ, interferon-gamma; IL-10, interleukin 10; LPS,
  lipopolysaccharide; NK, natural killer; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TAM, tumor-associated
  macrophage; Th1, T helper 1 cells; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; TNBC, triple-negative
  breast cancer
