caption: The proposed hypothetical model for the apple bud dormancy process. The model
  depicts schematically the dormancy stages from dormancy establishment to bud break.
  Environmental stimuli are presented above the dormancy stages. Potential regulatory
  roles of candidate genes are shown in dark blue boxes. Green arrows indicate putative
  transcriptional activation while T end red bars represent repression activity. The
  orange star-shaped form represents source of energy. Post-translational modification
  of MdoICE1 (phosphorylation and stabilization) upon stimuli is indicated with P
  embedded in red.
