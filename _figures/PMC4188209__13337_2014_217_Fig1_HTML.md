caption: 'Innate immunity pathways in mosquitoes. Toll pathway PAMPs are recognised
  by extracellular PRRs which activate a proteolytic cascade leading to activation
  of the cytokine spaetzle by cleavage. Active spaetzle binds to the Toll receptor
  resulting in its dimerisation and a downstream signalling cascade results in the
  phosphorylation of Cactus, targeting it for degradation. Upon degradation of the
  negative regulator Cactus, REL1 translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription
  of effector genes. Imd pathway Binding of peptidoglycan of gram-negative bacteria
  to PRGP-like receptors activates Imd and a signal transduction cascade results in
  cleavage of Caspar from REL2, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription
  of AMPs. For both Toll and Imd it is unclear how these pathways become activated
  by viruses, but possible explanations are virus- or virus debris-associated PAMPs.
  JAK/STAT pathway Binding of the virus-induced cytokine Vago to an unknown cell surface
  receptor activates JAK, which in turn phosphorylates STAT. Phosphorylated STAT dimerises
  and translocates to the nucleus as a transcription factor. RNAi: Viral dsRNA molecules
  are recognised as foreign by Dcr-2 which cleaves the long dsRNA into 21 nt viRNAs.
  The viRNAs become incorporated into the RISC. The passenger strand of the viRNA
  is degraded and the RISC targets the viral genome/mRNA using the guide strand. Ago-2
  slices the complementary target mRNA and inhibits synthesis of viral proteins. Viral
  dsRNA or ssRNA induces the production of piRNAs. Melanisation Mosquito pro-PO is
  activated by microorganisms such as bacteria and in some cases viruses. Activation
  of PO leads to the formation of melanin and in some cases PO activity is responsible
  for a reduction in infectious virus (whether or not this is due to melanin remains
  unclear)'
