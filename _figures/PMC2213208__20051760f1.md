caption: Activation of the vagus nerve leads to the release of acetylcholine (Ach)
  that binds to α-7 nicotinic receptors (α7 nAChR) on cytokine producing cells. This
  inhibits the activation of NF-κB and activates STAT3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 triggers an antiinflammatory signal by increasing SOCS3 expression, which
  suppresses signaling from cytokine receptors. Together, these signals prevent the
  release of TNF, HMGB1, and other cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
  disease.
