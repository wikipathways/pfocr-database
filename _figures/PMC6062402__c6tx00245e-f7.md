caption: . (A) Overview of affected metabolic pathways of PZA treated rats compared
  with control rats as visualized by bubble plots. Each bubble stands for one metabolism
  pathway and its area is proportional to the impact of each pathway, with color denoting
  the significance from the highest (red) to the lowest (white). (a) Nicotinate and
  nicotinamide metabolism; (b) purine metabolism; (c) taurine and hypotaurine metabolism;
  (d) glutathione metabolism; (e) glycerophospholipid metabolism; (f) citrate cycle,
  (B) the pathway flowchart of impacted purine metabolism, (C) the pathway flowchart
  of impacted nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
