caption: A highly simplified summary of the pathways underlying the proangiogenic
  activity of nicotine in HRMECs. Nicotine binds to high-affinity α7-nAChRs on HRMECs
  to stimulate the production of MMP-2 and -9 and inhibit levels of TIMP-1 and -2.
  Both of these processes eventually promote retinal angiogenesis. Another signaling
  pathway induced by nicotine in HRMECs involves activation of phospholipase A2. Nicotine
  can also increase the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to stimulate neovascularization
  in the retina. The pathways which connect α7-nAChRs to these downstream signaling
  proteins are unknown, but they probably involve the secretion of growth factors
  like bFGF or VEGF in response to nicotine treatment. Taken together, α7-nAChR antagonists
  could be useful for attenuating the proangiogenic activity of nicotine in retinal
  endothelial cells.
