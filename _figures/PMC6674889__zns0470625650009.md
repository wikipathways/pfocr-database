caption: Model for the promotion of neuronal development by CD47. The activation by
  CD47 of an Src family kinase may result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2
  and FRG, the consequent activation of Rac and Cdc42, and the promotion of neurite
  formation and branching. Src, Vav2, and FRG may also act in parallel at the signaling
  downstream of CD47. Interaction of SHPS-1 with CD47 promotes the formation of dendritic
  filopodia and spines possibly through a different signaling pathway involving Cdc42
  (dotted green lines), although the mechanism of such an effect is unknown.
