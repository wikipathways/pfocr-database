  by solid arrows. The enzymes catalyzing each step are indicated on the figure as
  follows: Lig A, B, protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase small and large subunits, respectively

  isozymes (, ); Lig Z, OH-DDVA dioxygenase (). OH-DDVA is converted to 5-carboxyvanillate
  with LigZ and LigY. Lig H, an enzyme related to the O demethylation of vanillate
  and syringate (this study). 5-Carboxyvanillate decarboxylase (represented by dotted
  arrow a) activity was detected in S. paucimobilis SYK-6 cell extract (), and 3-O-methylgallate
  was detected by the metabolic experiment with 5-carboxyvanillate (represented by
  dotted arrow b) (). The 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid metabolic pathway is represented
  according to findings from previous studies (, , , ). CHA aldolase, 4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-adipic
  acid aldolase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
