caption: Tumor cells’ metabolism reprogramming. Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells
  is characterized by highly glycolytic rates to increase tumor biomass by biosynthetic
  process. Glycolytic intermediates are used in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for
  anabolic process such as biosynthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and lipids. Glutamine
  is also an important source for tumor cells through glutaminolysis.
