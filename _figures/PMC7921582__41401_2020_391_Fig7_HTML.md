caption: Schematic diagram of the beneficial effects of JE-133 against H2O2-induced
  neurotoxicity and the potential mechanisms. H2O2 exposure induces intracellular
  oxidative stress, which triggers the overphosphorylation of the MAPK pathway proteins
  ERK1/2, P38 and JNK, and induces the upregulation of Akt phosphorylation, consequently
  activating neuronal apoptosis and ultimately leading to neuronal damage. JE-133
  prevents H2O2-induced neuronal damage, which might be mediated by the downregulation
  of ERK1/2 and P38 phosphorylation and associated with the PI3K/Akt pathway. The
  dual regulatory effects on the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways might synergistically
  contribute to the neuroprotective effects of JE-133
