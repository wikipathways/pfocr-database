caption: 'Possible mechanisms of opioid receptor-mediated influence of morphine on
  tumor growth. Morphine binds to the μ-opioid receptor and stimulates a range of
  signaling pathways, and can thus promote different aspects of the cancer process
  as follows: (1) MAPK/ERK pathway, promoting cell cycle progression; (2) PI3K/Akt
  pathway, mediating anti-apoptotic effects; (3) UPA expression upregulation and secretion,
  promoting metastasis; (4) transactivation of VEGF receptors which induces angiogenesis;
  and (5) suppression of the function of T-lymphocytes, leading to immunosuppression.
  (+) and (−) denote stimulation and inhibition, respectively.Note: Reproduced from
