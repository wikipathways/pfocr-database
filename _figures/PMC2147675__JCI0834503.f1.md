caption: Activated MYC induces lymphomagenesis (depicted as a cluster of cells with
  neovasculature) via activation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, which
  increases metabolic demand. This demand is in part met by the upregulation of MYC
  target genes involved in energy metabolism. MYC also induces p53, which triggers
  apoptosis in the setting of nutrient deprivation, unless the autophagy pathway can
  be activated to fulfill the energetic needs of the MYC-transformed cancer cell.
  MYC is depicted to activate a small mitochondrial isoform of ARF known as “smARF,”
  which translocates into mitochondria, triggering autophagy. Hypoxia is depicted
  to increase ROS, which in turn increase the levels of HIF-1. HIF-1 induces BNIP3
  and, with MYC, can induce GAPDH. Both BNIP3 and GAPDH have been shown to regulate
  autophagy (14, 17). In addition, ROS modulate ATG4, permitting induction of autophagy
  via ATG8 (). Autophagy occurs through assembly of cytoplasmic components within
  a membranous phagophore, which results in the formation of an autophagosome. A lysosome
  fuses with an autophagosome to form an autophagolysosome. In the report by Maclean
  and coworkers in this issue of the JCI, chloroquine is demonstrated to inhibit the
  final step in the autophagy pathway — the degradation/digestion of cargo within
  the autophagolysosome in order to provide recycled energy for the cell — thereby
  preventing MYC-mediated lymphomagenesis (4).
