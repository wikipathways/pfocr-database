caption: Hypothetical regulatory model to help explain the transcriptional dynamics
  during the heading differentiation process in Chinese cabbage.The rosette stage
  is accompanied by enhanced photosynthesis and many other primary metabolisms. The
  transition stage (our primary contribution to this discussion), in which the development
  of the folding and erect leaf begins, is considered a particularly important stage.
  Exogenous stimuli, such as low temperatures, are, hypothetically, sensed by sensor
  proteins. Plant hormones and second messenger Ca2+ are then activated, and the signals
  of which are transmitted and magnified through the MAPK signaling pathway and other
  kinases such as CaMs. These enhanced signals triggered many biological processes
  and promoted the asymmetric growth of leaves in which essential adaxial and abaxial
  identities have already been set. In the heading growth stage, many growth‐related
  processes were activated (indicated by the purple ribbon). In the heading mature
  stage, the re‐enhanced hormonal pathways (indicated by the light orange ribbon),
  promoted the formation of the leafy head and boost biomass. BR, brassinosteroid.
