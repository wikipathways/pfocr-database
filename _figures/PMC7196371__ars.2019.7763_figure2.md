caption: Mitochondria act as the key organelle for glucose and lipid metabolism. Mitochondria
  are energy generators of cells with two biological functions, the TCA cycle and
  respiration. The TCA cycle is a circulatory system for the enzymatic reaction of
  oxidizing acetyl-CoA to CO2 and is simultaneously coupled with OXPHOS to provide
  energy. The respiration chain is coupled to the production of ATP from ADP while
  transferring electrons to oxygen, which is reduced to H2O after the reaction. NADH
  and FADH2 are products of the TCA cycle and substrates for respiration. Glucose
  and lipids are the major energy substances in the periphery. The brain mainly uses
  glucose as the sole energy substrate under normal conditions. Glucose is decomposed
  to pyruvate to produce acetyl-CoA, which initiates the TCA cycle. A vicious cycle
  of hyperglycemia and mitochondrial dysfunction exists in the CNS and the periphery.
  Although lipids cannot be energy substrates in the brain, the adult brain is highly
  enriched in lipids, which not only constitute the structure of membrane system but
  also participate in signal transduction. Acetyl-CoA is also the subunit for fatty
  acid synthesis, which is an important process of lipogenesis. The lipogenic pathway
  can be inactivated by inflammatory factors, whereas insulin signaling stimulates
  lipogenesis and reduces lipolysis. Under energy-demanding conditions, lipolysis
  is triggered to release fatty acids and the mitochondrial beta-oxidation ensues
  for Acetyl-CoA generation, which is enrolled in ketogenesis stimulated by inflammatory
  factors in the early stage of AD. Ketone bodies, such as acetoacetate and β-HB,
  are used as neuronal alternative energy fuels. β-HB, β-hydroxybutyrate; ADP, adenosine
  diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation. Color
  images are available online.

  description: Mitochondria act as the key organelle for glucose and lipid metabolism.
    Mitochondria are energy generators of cells with two biological functions, the

    Glucose and lipids are the major energy substances in the periphery. The brain
