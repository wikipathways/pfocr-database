caption: 'Model to explain the relationship between ethylene and NO, and between ethylene
  and GSNOR (GSNO), in roots. In previous works, and also in this work (see Figure  and
  Table ), it has been shown that ethylene, NO, and GSH increase in Fe-deficient roots
  of dicot plants (see section “Introduction”). Moreover, it has been shown that ethylene
  can influence NO accumulation in roots and vice versa (black arrows; ; ). In this
  work, it has been found that ethylene and GSNOR increase under low LODIS accumulation
  in roots (see Figure ). After that, a new model, complementary of the previous one,
  is proposed (blue arrows) suggesting mutual possible interactions among ethylene,
  GSNOR, GSH and NO: (1) ethylene can upregulate GSNOR (see Figure ); (2) GSNOR can
  decrease GSNO (); (3) Low GSNO can unblock ethylene synthesis since nitrosylation
  of SAM synthetase by GSNO can inhibit ethylene synthesis (; ; see section “Discussion”);
  (4) GSNO derives from NO and GSH (); (5) GSH can enhance ethylene production ().
  In green are components whose expression, activity and/or content is known to increase
  under Fe deficiency while in red are components whose content is known to decrease
  under Fe deficiency. GSH, glutathione; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; GSNOR, GSNO reductase;
  ET, ethylene; NO, nitric oxide (→: promotion; : inhibition).'
