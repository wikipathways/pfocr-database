caption: 'DEGs involved in glycerolipid metabolism and fatty acid degradation pathway.
  (A) Expression changes of DEGs involved in glycerolipid metabolism. (B) Expression
  changes of DEGs involved in fatty acid degradation. Red, genes with high expression
  levels; Green, gene with low expression levels; Rounded square frame: KEGG pathway
  names; square frame: enzymes; oval: intermediate product; black arrows: direction
  of metabolic pathway; L5D3, the third day of the last larval instar; W0, just wandering;
  W2, the second day during wandering; P0, just pupation; P3, the third day after
  pupation. DEGs involved in glycerolipid metabolism and fatty acid degradation pathways
  are listed in . Sn: stereo-specifically numbered; D:dextrorotation; L: laevorotation;
  O: oxidation; CoA: coenzyme A.'
