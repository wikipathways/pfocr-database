caption: Alterations of the BMP pathway upon treatment of CML cancer stem cells. (1)
  Setting of a BMP4 autocrine loop in CSCs that controls Twist1 expression to promote
  resistance of CML CSCs to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and retained high production
  of BMP4 by bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells of resistant patients. (2) At patients
  remission under TKI treatment, CSCs showed a co-enrichment in BMP and Jak2-signaling,
  quiescence and SC signatures, as identified by single cell RNA-Seq analysis of TKI-persisting
  cells. In persisting CSCs, BMPR1b-cells displayed co-activated Smad1/5/8 and Stat3
  pathways that are targeted by blocking BMPR1B/Jak2 signal using, for example, a
  specific BMPR1b inhibitor (E6201) or Jak2 (AG490) inhibitor. The TKI-induced quiescence
  of residual CSCs relies on a BMP4 signal delivered by surrounding mesenchymal cells
  and inhibited by the BMPR1B inhibitor (E6201). Dual targeting of BMP and Jak2 efficiently
  reverses TKI-dependent induction of quiescence and allowed re-entry into a differentiation
  process of the BMPR1b+ CSC sub-fraction that was adherent to the stroma.
