caption: (Left) PTEN regulates translational/transcriptional systems, playing an important
  role in neuronal proliferation, migration, survival, morphology, and plasticity.
  As a lipid phosphatase, PTEN catalyzes the removal of the D3 phosphate from PIP3,
  which acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway, whereas
  PTEN’s protein phosphatase activity targets a number of substrates, including MAPK
  signaling, which PTEN inhibits. The TSC1–TSC2 complex, through its GTPase‐activating
  protein activity towards the small G‐protein Rheb, is downstream effectors of the
  PI3K/Akt pathway and a critical negative regulator of mTORC1, regulating translation,
  transcription, and other cellular processes. (Right) Mutations in both PTEN and
  TSC1/2 trigger the activation of mTORC1, thereby regulating translation, transcription,
  and other cellular processes. Exaggerated mTORC1 signaling results in disinhibited
  protein synthesis. The loss of either PTEN or TSC1/2 activity directly impact gene
  transcription and the translation of specific mRNAs, such as TH and CTGF, and a
  number of synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD‐95 and SAPAP1.
