caption: Regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in fruit ripening. The oval describes
  the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway which is positively regulated by MBW complex,
  specific growth hormones, light, and sucrose signaling. In addition, the negative
  regulatory factors of anthocyanin biosynthesis have been mentioned. Auxin and gibberellin
  negatively regulate the signaling by the other growth hormones, while COP1 and nitrogen
  downregulate MBW complex. Also, MYBL2 and LBD37/38/39 are negative regulators of
  light signaling while ethylene and gibberellin downregulate the signaling of anthocyanin
  biosynthesis by sucrose
