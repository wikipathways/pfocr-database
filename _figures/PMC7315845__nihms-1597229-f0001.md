caption: Cross talk between lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism in beta cells.
  (A) Fasting increases fatty acids (FA) in the circulation due to lipolysis in adipose
  tissues. FA are transported into mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl transferase
  1 (CPT1) for beta-oxidation and used as the primary source of energy during fasting
  in beta cells. In addition, a part of FA is esterified to triglycerides (TG) at
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form lipid droplets (LD). PLIN5 is a lipid droplet
  protein whose expression is upregulated during fasting in beta cells and considered
  to coat LD during fasting along with PLIN2. Although not shown in beta cells, LD
  are also known to aid the transfer of FA to mitochondria for beta-oxidation during
  starvation. (B) Glucose plays a central role in triggering insulin secretion by
  increasing ATP/ADP through upregulation of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. In addition,
  glucose increases citrate and activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), resulting
  in the increase of malonyl-CoA, which in turn suppresses CPT1 and reduces transport
  of fatty acid coenzyme A (FA-CoA) into mitochondria and beta-oxidation. While this
  pathway is not necessarily unique to beta cells, the resultant increase in long-chain
  FA is considered to support insulin secretion. Glucose also provides glycerol-3
  phosphate (glycerol-3-p) that is used for TG synthesis. In addition to TG synthesis,
  glucose is proposed to increase lipolysis in beta cells. Although there may potentially
  be multiple pathways involved, phosphorylation of PLIN5 is one proposed mechanism
  that mediates the increase in lipolysis postprandially in beta cells. The increase
  in TG synthesis and lipolysis is proposed to support insulin secretion through GL/FFA
  cycling. Metabolites generated by lipolysis, such as FA and 1-monoacylglycerol (1-MAG),
  are proposed to augment insulin secretion.
