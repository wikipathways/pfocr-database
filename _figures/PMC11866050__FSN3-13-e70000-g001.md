caption: Potential mechanism of peony seed oil in liver and brain induced by D‐gal.
  (A) Peony seed oil and fish oil inhibited neuroinflammation and hyperphosphorylation
  of Tau protein by activating the PPARs/RXRs signaling pathway. (B) Enrichment analysis
  of DEGs was represented by a circle, and its color represents its cluster terms.
  Terms with a similarity score > 0.3 kappa. The PPI network is visualized with Cytoscape
