caption: Signaling pathways regulated by SHP-2 in the gastrointestinal tract. (A)
  In response to growth factors, SHP-2 binds via its SH2 domains either to autophosphorylated
  receptors (such as that for platelet-derived growth factor, not shown) or to docking
  proteins (such as the Grb2-associated proteins Gabs and fibroblast growth factor
  receptor substrate [FRS2]), which are tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated receptor
  tyrosine kinases or by Src family kinases. Such interactions result in the activation
  of SHP-2 and its consequent promotion of Ras activation, leading to cell growth.
  (B) In response to cytokines, the Janus kinases become phosphorylated and then phosphorylate
  STAT transcription factors, which dimerize and enter the nucleus. SHP-2 can inhibit
  this process by directly dephosphorylating either the Janus kinases or STAT proteins.
  (C) In response to insulin, SHP-2 assembles in a complex with insulin-receptor substrate
  (IRS)1/2 and the p85 subunit of PI3K, leading to Akt activation, leading to cell
  survival. (D) During H pylori infection, cagA is injected into the gastric epithelial
  cells and is phosphorylated by Src family kinases. SHP-2 then interacts with phosphorylated
  cagA, leading to the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in a Ras-independent
  manner and to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) dephosphorylation and inactivation. CagA
  also can interact directly with STAT3 by binding or recruitment to gp130, thereby
  promoting hyperactivation and increased transcriptional activity. (E) At low cell
  density, nonphosphorylated YAP/TAZ promotes nuclear translocation of SHP-2, which
  in turn stimulates T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor- and TEA domain family
  members-regulated genes via parafibromin dephosphorylation.

  description: Signaling pathways regulated by SHP-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.
    (A) In response to growth factors, SHP-2 binds via its SH2 domains either to autophosphorylated

    (B) In response to cytokines, the Janus kinases become phosphorylated and then

    SHP-2 can inhibit this process by directly dephosphorylating either the Janus
