caption: The major components of the TGF-ß signaling pathway in normal fibroblasts.
  TGF-ß secreted from a variety of cell types is sequestered within the ECM in a biologically
  inactive form. Activation of latent TGF-ß is catalyzed by αvß6 integrin. Activated
  TGF-ß binds to the TßR1-TßR2 complex of transmembrance serine/threonine kinases.
  Smad2/3 are recruited to TßR1 by SARA. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 forms a complex with
  Smad4 and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to SBE sequences of TGF-ß-responsive
  target genes. Cofactors such as p300 are recruited to the SBE-Smad complex and transcription
  is activated. Smad7 is an endogenous physiologic inhibitor of Smad signaling. Excessive
  TGF-ß production or activation, or deregulated intracellular Smad signal transduction,
  result in collagen overproduction and fibrosis.
