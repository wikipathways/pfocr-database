caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction as an effector mechanism of OIS and replicative
  senescence (short telomeres). The oncogenic activity of the Ras/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway induces a replication stress () and mitochondrial biogenesis
  leading to DNA damage and the activation of the p53 and Rb pathways. The activity
  of these tumor suppressors converge in the mitochondria to induce a senescence effector
  pathway characterized here as a metabolic checkpoint and oxidative stress. This
  is not a linear pathway, since the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction can activate
  the p53 and Rb pathways, generating positive feedback mechanisms that we propose
  contribute to keeping cells senescent.
