caption: Under normal growth conditions, MPK3/6 are less active and ARR1/10/12 maintains
  optimal cytokinin response to control plant growth and development. Exposing plants
  to high salinity activates MPK3/6, which interact with and phosphorylate ARR1/10/12.
  Phosphorylated ARR1/10/12 are degraded through the 26S proteasome‐dependent pathway,
  eventually repressing the cytokinin response and leading to growth inhibition. X
  represents inhibited signaling or process.
