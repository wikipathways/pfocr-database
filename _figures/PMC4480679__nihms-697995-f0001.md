caption: The bacterial C-P lyase complex catalyzes the complex biochemical pathway
  for the metabolism of phosphonates and these transformations are illustrated in
  . In bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the catalytic machinery for the C-P lyase
  complex is governed by an operon of 14 genes (phnCDEFGHIJKLMNOP) that is up-regulated
  by the PhoR/PhoB two-component signaling system (). Four of the expressed proteins
  (PhnC, PhnD, PhnE, and PhnF) are necessary as regulatory or transport proteins (,
  ). Seven of the proteins (PhnG through PhnM) are critical for the enzymatic steps
  during the conversion of organophosphonates to phosphate () and three enzymes (PhnN,
  PhnO, and PhnP) catalyze auxiliary reactions (-).
