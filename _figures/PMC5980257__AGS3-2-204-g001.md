caption: Metabolic map during liver regeneration. A, Pentose phosphate pathway; there
  were no significant differences between before and after hepatectomy (Hx). B, Glycolysis/tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) cycle; there was significant decrease only in metabolites in the
  first half of the TCA cycle, and ATP by anaerobiotic glycolysis did not occur in
  time for energy consumption of Hx. N.D., not detected
