caption: Protumour inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) and antitumour
  myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) are produced when resident
  pancreatic fibroblasts receive paracrine and cell-contact cues from pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, respectively , within the tumour microenvironment.
  Tumour cell-derived IL-1α aids in the generation of iCAFs, which secrete LIF and
  propagate the iCAF phenotype. IL-1β also acts to maintain the iCAF phenotype through
  autocrine signalling. iCAFs upregulate a host of inflammatory cytokines, such as
  IL-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in addition to contributing
  to local collagen deposition. Putative markers for iCAFs are platelet derived growth
  factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) and CXCL12. When IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) is activated by
  IL-1 ligands, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is also activated, which
  in turn leads to the activation of IKKβ. These events lead to the liberation of
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) from inhibitory proteins, enabling it to translocate to
  the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for a host of inflammatory genes
  that drive the iCAF phenotype,. iCAFs have also been shown to signal through the
  JAK–STAT signalling pathway. Cell contact between PDAC cells and juxtatumoural fibroblasts
  generates myCAFs through transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling. Putative
  markers for myCAFs are fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and/or α-smooth muscle
  actin (αSMA). Mesenchymal stem cell-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (mscCAFs)
  are recruited from the bone marrow and produce granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF) locally in the tumour microenvironment, contributing to polarization
  of macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype and blunting of a robust T
  cell response against the tumour. mscCAFs are positive for CD44, CD49, CD73 and
  CD90. Lastly , major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-expressing CAFs (apCAFs)
  have demonstrated the ability to present antigen to CD4+ T cells. Shh, sonic hedgehog.
