caption: a | In the tumour microenvironment (TME), T cells rely on autophagy to support
  their survival and differentiation. Basal levels of autophagy in naive T cells maintain
  their quiescence and protect them from mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)-induced apoptosis. High levels of lactate in tumours disrupt autophagy of
  naive T cells and impair the antitumour response in mouse models. High levels of
  potassium or low levels of nutrients in the TME constrain the nutrient uptake in
  effector T cells and cause functional caloric restriction, which induces autophagy
  through mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition. Autophagy is critical for mitochondrial
  integrity, which determines effector T cell differentiation via metabolic reprogramming.
  High levels of arginase 2 (ARG2) expression in tumour-infiltrating regulatory T
  cells (Treg cells) may maintain their high level of autophagy. The loss of autophagy
  in Treg cells switches their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  to glycolysis with active mTORC1 and MYC, which leads to FOXP3 instability. Increased
  apoptosis and defective function in autophagy-deficient Treg cells contribute to
  greater tumour resistance. b | Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) take advantage
  of lipidate microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)-associated
  phagocytosis (LAP) to degrade apoptotic cancer cells. LAP deficiency in TAMs leads
  to the release of mitochondrial DNA from apoptotic cancer cells, which induces type
  I interferon response through the cGAS–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway
  and antitumour activity. c | In ovarian cancer metastasis, TIM4+ TAMs are embryonically
  originated and locally sustained, whereas TIM4− TAMs are replenished from circulating
  monocytes. Relative to TIM4− TAMs, TIM4+ TAMs manifest high levels of oxidative
  phosphorylation and adapt mitophagy to alleviate oxidative stress. High levels of
  ARG1 in TIM4+ TAMs contribute to potent mitophagy activities via weakened mTORC1
  activation due to low arginine levels resulting from ARG1-mediated metabolism. Furthermore,
  genetic deficiency of autophagy element FAK family interacting protein of 200 kDa
  (FIP200) results in TIM4+ TAM loss via ROS-mediated apoptosis, and elevated T cell
  immunity and tumour inhibition in vivo. ATG13, autophagy-related protein 13; BCL2,
  B cell lymphoma 2; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter 1; TIM4, T cell immunoglobulin
  and mucin domain-containing molecule 4; ULK1, unc-51-like kinase 1.
