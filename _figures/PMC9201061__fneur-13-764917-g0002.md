caption: Working hypothesis for LB formation and neuronal cell death in PD. Aging,
  oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to dysregulation of the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN) and endo-lysosomes in neurons, ultimately impairing the removal of
  the precursor of pathogenic α-synuclein (protofibrils) through ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway and autophagy, promoting LB formation, and propagating pathogenic α-synuclein
  to neighboring neurons. Mutations in PD causative genes and risk-related genes (VPS13C,
  LRRK2, SNCA, and GBA1) accelerate oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
  dysregulation of the TGN and endo-lysosomes.
