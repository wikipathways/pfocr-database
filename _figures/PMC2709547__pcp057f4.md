caption: Endogenous levels of cytokinins, gibberellin, ABA and auxins in a wild-type
  and gibberellin signaling mutants. Shoots of the wild type (T65) and gid1-3, gid2-1
  and slr1 were harvested after growth in a greenhouse for 5 weeks. The amounts of
  the hormones are shown as histograms with the SD (n = 3). The y-axis is concentration
  as pmol g−1 FW. Hormone species and other compounds in gray were not measured, and
  those in black were under the quantification limit. The overall recoveries of analyzed
  stable isotope-labeled internal standards are presented in Supplementary Table S7.
  Genes involved in each metabolic process are indicated in italic blue letters surrounded
  by a rectangle. The details of each metabolic pathway are described by Hirano et
  al. (). GA44/15-OL, GA44/15-open lactone; XHT, xanthoxin; IpyA, indole-3-pyruvic
  acid; NHT, N-hydroxyl-tryptamine; IAN, indole-3-acetonitrile; IPT, adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase;
  CKX, OsCKX; CPS, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase; KS, ent-kaurene synthase; KO,
  ent-kaurene oxidase; KAO, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase; EUIL, EUI-like; ZEP, OsZEP;
