caption: The proposed effect of low-dose PFESA-BP2 exposure on the hepatic fibrosis
  signaling pathway in the liver [59]. This figure depicts key genes involved in hepatic
  fibrosis, including MYC, EGFR, IGF1, CCNA2, CDK1, and BIRC5, which are all upregulated
  in response to PFESA-BP2 (indicated in orange). Therefore, PFESA-BP2-induced hepatic
  fibrosis might result in the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, increased collagen
  production, and ECM protease inhibition, key factors in fibrosis development
