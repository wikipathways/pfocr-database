caption: .  Cannabinoid receptor signalling. Cannabinoids exert their effects by binding
  to specific G-protein-coupled receptors. The major pathways and channels activated
  by CB1 receptor are depicted. These include inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase (AC)–cyclic
  AMP–protein kinase A (PKA) pathway; inhibition of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels
  and activation of K+ inwardly rectifying channels; activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase cascades (ERK; JNK, p38 and FAK); ceramide generation and β-arrestin
  recruitment. This image contains some elements adapted from the Servier Medical
