caption: 'A: C. elegans caspase pathway. Cell death is the genetically determined
  final event in differentiation for specific cells in the classical studies of C.
  elegans, as determined using genetic complementation. Four genes control this pathway:
  egl-1, ced-9, ced-4, and ced-3. Transcription-regulated synthesis of EGL-1 inhibits
  CED-9. Release of inhibition on CED-9 allows for oligomerization of CED-3 by CED-4.
  Activation of CED-3 leads to cell death by proteolysis and subsequent uptake by
  neighboring cells. The function of this pathway in C. elegans is limited to cell
  death based on studies of mutants with deficiency in these four genes. B:Mammalian
  caspase pathways. The mammalian caspase pathways are more complex than the canonical
  cell death pathway in C. elegans (A). The extrinsic pathway is a receptor-mediated
  activation of initiator caspases that requires adaptors. The exact stoichiometry
  of activating (FADD) and inhibitory (FLIP) adaptors is not known. Active initiator
  caspases subsequently cleave and activate effector caspases. As discussed in the
  text, the set of critical caspase substrate to mediate cell death has not been identified.
  The second, or intrinsic, pathway is initiated by damage to mitochondria or other
  organelles leading to activation of caspases. The homologs of C. elegans CED-9 and
  EGL-1 are the BH4- and BH3-containing proteins of the Bcl-2 family members in mammals.
  The function of these Bcl-2 members is to regulate mitochondrial integrity and disruption
  of mitochondrial membranes leading to release of the CED-4 homolog, APAF-1, and
  cytochrome c for assembly of apoptosome to activate caspase-9. Activated caspase-9,
  in turn, cleaves and activates effector caspases. Other mitochondrial proteins can
  be released to amplify caspase activation or for caspase-independent cell death
  as discussed in the text.'
