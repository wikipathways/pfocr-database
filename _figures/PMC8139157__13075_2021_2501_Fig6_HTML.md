caption: Proposed model of disc lactate metabolic symbiosis. A simplified model of
  disc lactate-dependent metabolic symbiosis showing the major steps of glucose metabolism
  starting with (1) glucose uptake via the Glut1 transporter into hypoxic NP cells,
  (2) conversion of glucose to pyruvate by glycolysis, (3) conversion of pyruvate
  to lactate by LDH5, (4) export of lactate out of NP cells through MCT4, (5) import
  of extracellular lactate into the more oxygenated AF cells via the MCT1, (6) conversion
  of lactate into pyruvate by LDH1, (7) conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-coA by
  PDH, which is negatively regulated by PDK, and (8) shuttle of acetyl-coA into the
  TCA cycle to generate precursors for biosynthesis and/or for oxidative phosphorylation
  to generate ATP. Below NP cell is shown the glycolytic pathway while below AF cell
  is the TCA cycle. Pyruvate to lactate converting enzyme (LDH-5), lactate exporter
  (MCT-4), lactate importer (MCT-1), and lactate to pyruvate converting enzyme (LDH-1)
  are shown. *Denotes the amino acids (green) and TCA metabolites (black) containing
  13C derived from the heavy isotope 13C-lactate label. Malate conversion to oxaloacetate
  is the most thermodynamically unfavorable step in the TCA cycle with the G=+6.7kcalmol
