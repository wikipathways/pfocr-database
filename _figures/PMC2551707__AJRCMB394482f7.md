caption: PGE2 inhibits lung fibroblast collagen expression and proliferation via independent
  cAMP effectors. PGE2 inhibition of fibroblast collagen expression and proliferation
  share a common proximal signaling pathway via ligation of EP2, activation of the
  G-stimulatory protein Gαs, activation of adenyl cyclase (AC), and increase in intracellular
  cAMP. The activation of PKA, however, is responsible for the inhibition of collagen
  expression via inhibition of PKC-δ, whereas activation of Epac-1 leads to Rap1 activation
  and inhibition of proliferation.
