caption: Schematic representation of light-evoked impacts on ethylene biosynthetic
  pathway. (1) Light irradiation negatively impacts the conversion of methionine (Met)
  to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). (2) Light also affects the transcription of particular
  1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthases (ACS), responsible for converting
  SAM into ACC. In Arabidopsis, whereas ACS2 gene transcription is negatively controlled
  by PHYBPfr, ACS8/4 gene transcription is stimulated by PIF5, and, accordingly, PIF5
  protein stability is negatively influenced by active phytochrome B (PHYBPfr). (3)
  Light is also known to inhibit the transcription and activity of ACC oxidase (ACO),
  whose activity converts ACC into ethylene. (4) PHYBPfr also stimulates the conversion
  of ACC into the non-volatile ACC metabolite 1-malonyl aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid (MACC) via MACC transferase (MACCT). Biosynthetic enzymes and metabolic substrates
  or products are represented with green and blue ovals, respectively. Light-dependent
  transcriptional control of particular ACS genes is highlighted by the gray area
  of the figure.
