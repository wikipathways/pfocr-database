caption: Predicted central metabolism of M. catarrhalis RH4. The glycolysis pathway
  is incomplete and lacks the key enzymes phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase.
  The enzymes of glycolysis are expected to be involved in the gluconeogenic pathway,
  all enzymes of which were found to be present. Fatty acid degradation and acetate
  assimilation are probably very important, as they supply the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle with acetyl-CoA. The complete glyoxylate pathway is present and allows
  bypass of the TCA cycle, which lacks both subunits of succinyl-CoA synthetase.
