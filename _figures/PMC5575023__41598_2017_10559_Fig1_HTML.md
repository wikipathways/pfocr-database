caption: The overview workflow of the analysis process. (a) Subdivision of proteins
  into groups based on KEGG database (b) Selection of dysregulated biological pathways
  and crucial proteins related to the OS of ovarian cancer based on SOGL method. The
  coefficients of proteins with gray shadow were estimated to zero; The coefficients
  of proteins with red shadow were estimated to nonzero, these proteins defined as
  crucial proteins related to the OS and pathways of them were defined as dysregulated
  biological pathways. (c) Survival related pathway identification and survival related
  predictive proteins selection.
