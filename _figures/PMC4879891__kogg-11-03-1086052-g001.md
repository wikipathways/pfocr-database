caption: 'Canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of signal, action of the
  destruction complex (CKIα, GSK-3β, APC, Axin) creates a hyperphosphorylated β-catenin,
  which is a target for ubiqitination and degradation by the proteosome. Binding of
  Wnt ligand to a Frizzled/LRP-5/6 receptor complex leads to stabilization of hypophosphorylated
  β-catenin, which interacts with TCF/LEF proteins in the nucleus to activate transcription.
  In a canonical pathway, CKIα, GSK-3β, APC, and Axin act as negative regulators and
  all other components act positively. Abbreviations: APC = adenomatous polyposis
  coli, CK = casein kinase, GSK = glycogen synthase kinase, Fzd = Frizzled-Rezeptor,
  LRP = low-density-lipoprotein receptor related protein, Tcf/Lef = T cell-specific
  transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor.'
