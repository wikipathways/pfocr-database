caption: Schematic representation of molecular mechanism underling OligoGM1 neurotrophic
  function. OligoGM1 enhances the activation of TrkA signaling pathway, which could
  be associated to an increased activation of PLCγ1, leading to the formation of second
  messengers DAG and IP3. These events bring to the opening of Ca2+ channels on the
  PM and on endoplasmic reticulum, leading to an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ responsible
  for N2a differentiation. TrkA, neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor A; NGF, nerve
  growth factor; PLCγ, phospholipase C gamma; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  DAG, diacyl-glycerol; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C;
  TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum. GM1
  sugar code is according to Varki et al. 2015 []. This image is updated from Chiricozzi
  et al. []
