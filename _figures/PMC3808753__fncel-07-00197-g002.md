caption: Modulation of axon growth by purinergic receptors. (A) Schematic representation
  of the coordination of purinergic receptors and purines during the modulation of
  axon elongation in hippocampal neurons. Both ADP acting on P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptors,
  and ATP acting through P2X7 receptors, modulate adenylyl cyclase type 5 activity
  (AC5) in a coordinated manner. This coordinated signaling through AC5 serves to
  modulate cAMP intracellular concentrations and the activity of the PI3K-Akt-GSK3α/β
  signaling pathway, the latter controlling axon elongation in hippocampal neurons
  (adapted from). (B) Axon elongation depends on the extracellular concentration of
  ATP. High extracellular concentrations of ATP provoked by cell damage, programed
  apoptosis, or other physiological and/or pathological conditions diminish axon elongation.
  However, in the absence of high extracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP can trigger
  P2Y1 receptors and promote axon elongation. The balance between the extracellular
  concentrations of purines and the activity of purinergic receptors modulates axonal
  elongation.
