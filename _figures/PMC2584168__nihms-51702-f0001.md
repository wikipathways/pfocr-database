caption: A diagram of tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent methionine transmethylation
  and glutathione synthesis. The methionine cycle (transmethylation) involves the
  regeneration of methionine from homocysteine via the B12-dependent transfer of a
  methyl group from 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-CH3THF) via the methionine synthase
  (MS) reaction. Methionine is then activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl
  donor for multiple cellular methyltransferase (MTase) reactions and the methylation
  of essential molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, phospholipids, creatine, and
  neurotransmittors. The transfer of the methyl group from SAM results in the demethylated
  product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The reversible hydrolysis of SAH to homocysteine
  and adenosine by the SAH hydrolase (SAHH) reaction completes the methionine cycle.
  Homocysteine can then be either remethylated to methionine or irreversibly removed
  from the methionine cycle by cystathionine beta synthase (CBS). This is a one-way
  reaction that permanently removes homocysteine from the methionine cycle and initiates
  the transsulfuration pathway for the synthesis of cysteine and glutathione. Glutathione
  is shown in its active reduced form (GSH) and inactive oxidized disulfide form (GSSG).
