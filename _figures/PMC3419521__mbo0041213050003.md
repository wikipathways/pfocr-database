caption: Global regulatory network model of energy-converting pathways. Genes mreB,
  mreC, and mreD (Methanosarcina regulator of energy-converting metabolism) are homologs
  of mreA postulated to encode proteins involved in regulation of genes required for
  conversion of methylamines and methanol to methane. Enzymes for conversion of acetate
  to methane are encoded by ack (acetate kinase), pta (phosphotransacetylase), cdh-1
  (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase), cam (carbonic anhydrase), and mtr (membrane-bound
  tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase complex). Enzymes required for conversion
  of methylamines to methane are encoded by mtbA (methylamine-specific methylcobamide:CoM
  methyltransferase), mtmBC-1 (B, monomethylamine-specific methyltransferase; C, cognate
  corrinoid protein), mtbBC-2 (B, dimethylamine-specific methyltransferase; C, cognate
  corrinoid protein), and mttBC-2 (B, trimethylamine-specific methyltransferase; C,
  cognate corrinoid protein). Enzymes required for conversion of methanol to methane
  are encoded by mtaBC-1, mtaBC-2, mtaBC-3 (B, methanol-specific methyltransferase;
  C, cognate corrinoid protein), and mtaA-1 (methanol-specific methylcobamide:CoM
  methyltransferase). Enzymes common to the pathways for conversion of methanol or
  methylamines to methane are encoded by mer (F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT reductase),
  mtd (F420-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase), mch (methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase),
  ftr (formylmethanofuran; H4MPT formyltransferase), fmd (molybdenum-dependent formyl-methanofuran
  dehydrogenase), fpo (coenzyme F420 dehydrogenase complex), and fpoF (a subunit of
  the coenzyme F420 dehydrogenase complex). Proteins regulating genes specific to
  the conversion of methanol are encoded by msrA, msrB, msrD, msrE, msrC, and msrF
  (methanol-specific regulators). An enzyme proposed to be specific for conversion
  of dimethylsulfide to methane is encoded by mtsD (methyltransferase). An enzyme
  in the pathway for conversion of carbon monoxide to methane is encoded by cmtA (cytoplasmic
  methyltransferase) (formerly mtsF).
