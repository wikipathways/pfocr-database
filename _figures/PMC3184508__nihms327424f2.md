caption: 'In Huntington’s disease (HD), mHtt expression results in altered corticostriatal
  synaptic function by synergizing glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling, which
  increases intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and leads to excitotoxicity. This model
  bypasses the cascade of molecular signaling pathways and illustrates the ‘end result’
  of mHtt-mediated dysfunction of each pathway. Solid lines represent augmented function
  and dashed lines illustrate reduced function, respectively. Dopamine release from
  the substantia nigra pars compacta stimulates D1 receptors on direct pathway MSNs
  and augments N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated (NR2A) glutamate activity. TBZ
  inhibits dopamine release and probably attenuates this response. Activation of D2
  receptor-mediated inhibition of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals is
  reduced in HD. Similarly, mGluR2 feedback-inhibition of glutamate release is also
  altered. Recent evidence has revealed that synaptic NR2A NMDA receptor signaling
  is not disrupted in HD and is in fact prosurvival, although the role of altered
  D1 activity on NR2A activity has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is conceivable
  that D1 activity results in pathological changes to NR2A function. Binding of mHtt
  sensitizes InsP3R1 to InsP3, resulting in supernormal Ca2+ release from the ER upon
  mGluR5 activation. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ is also caused by altered VGCC function.
  Moreover, mHtt expression potentiates NR2B NMDA receptor-mediated responses and
  further increases Ca2+ levels. Dysfunction and reduced expression of GLT1 impedes
  glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft. Huntexil® (NeruoSearch A/S, Denmark),
  a dopamine stabilizer and D2 modulator, demonstrated efficacy in human HD clinical
  trials. The mGluR2 agonist LY39268 and mGluR5 antagonist MPEP have shown promise
  in mouse models of HD. Low-dose MMT, which preferentially blocks NR2B activity,
  and ceftriaxone, which increases expression of GLT1, have also been successful in
  preclinical trials with HD mouse models. Taken together, mHtt results in a potentiated
  bombardment of glutamate-mediated excitotoxic cascades in MSNs.ER: Endoplasmic reticulum;
