caption: Schematic figure depicting the molecular mechanisms underlying copper and
  fluconazole synergism. Pdr1 binds to fluconazole (FLC) and activates the expression
  of genes such as CDR1, promoting fluconazole efflux. FLC inhibits Erg11, which leads
  to blockade of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and activation of an alternative
  sterol pathway that culminate in ergosterol depletion and accumulation of toxic
  sterols. Copper (Cu) decreases the transactivation activity of Pdr1, rendering cells
  unable to activate CDR1 and detoxify FLC. The combination of Cu and FLC also leads
  to a greater accumulation of toxic sterol intermediates and a consistent downregulation
  of several genes of the ergosterol pathway (ERG genes). However, copper appears
  to be able to stimulate ergosterol biosynthesis through an as yet unknown mechanism.
  In addition, Cu and FLC exert a strong inhibition on the expression of ZAP1, which
  causes zinc depletion, further contributing to cellular dysfunction.
