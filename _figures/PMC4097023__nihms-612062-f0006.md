caption: Working model of apigenin-induced DNA damage. Apigenin induces DSBs, ATM
  and H2AX phosphorylation in a PKCδ-dependent pathway, while p38 modulates apigenin-induced
  DNA damage independent of ATM. Apigenin-induced down-regulation of cell cycle control
  genes and ATM activation led to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. Down-modulation
  of genes involved in DNA repair by apigenin indicates that cells may be unable to
  repair apigenin-induced DNA damage, hence triggering apoptosis.
