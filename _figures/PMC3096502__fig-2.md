caption: Overview of the NER pathway. (A) GG–NER pathway. Recognition of a platinum
  lesion triggers the XPC–Rad23B–Cen2 complex assembly at the site of damage. RPA
  and XPA are recruited, along with TFIIH to unwind the duplex and to keep the strands
  separated. The nucleases XPG and XPF-ERCC1 cleave the damaged strand 5′ and 3′ of
  the damage, releasing a ∼34 nt fragment of DNA. Subsequent fill-in of the resulting
  gap requires DNA polymerase, which re-synthesizes the excised sequence and DNA ligase
  I or III seals the nick between the newly synthesized DNA and the 5′ phosphate left
  behind after cleavage. (B) TC-NER pathway. Upon encountering a DNA lesion during
  transcription of a gene, RNAP II stalls, allowing for repair of the lesion to occur.
  This response is, in part, mediated by the transcription repair factors, CSA and
  CSB, which bypass the need for the GG-NER recognition factors. CSA and CSB recruit
  TFIIH to the site of damage, and the process proceeds in the same manner as for
  the GG-NER pathway. (To see this illustration in color the reader is referred to
