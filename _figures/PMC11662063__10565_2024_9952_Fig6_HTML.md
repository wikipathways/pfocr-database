caption: Proposed model suggests that SS18-SSX drives the acitivation ofTYK2/STAT3/Bcl2
  axisthereby mediating apoptosis evasion in SS cells. The distinct formation of the
  SS18-SSX fusion gene enhances the transcriptional activity of TYK2, thereby elevating
  TYK2 to activate the STAT3-Bcl2 signaling pathway involved in apoptosis evasion.
  These findings, for the first time, elucidate the functional role of TYK2 in SS
  cells, providing novel insights and potential therapeutic strategies for their treatment
