caption: Biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis of lysine and TβL. In lysine
  biosynthesis, the first committed step is the DapA-catalyzed condensation of aspartic
  acid semialdehyde with pyruvate to form DHDPA. DHDPA is then reduced to THDPA, a
  reaction catalyzed by DapB. Tabtoxin biosynthesis is thought to diverge from the
  lysine biosynthetic pathway after THDPA synthesis and before DAP formation (vertical
  arrow). TabB is related to DapD, a gene encoding THDPA succinyl-CoA succinyltransferase.
  TabB is thought to function as an acetyltransferase that converts an unknown compound
  (xTHDPA) to an acetyl derivative, which is further metabolized to TβL.
