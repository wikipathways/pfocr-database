caption: 'The two reactions catalyzed by the gene product of the Tu-CAS gene are marked
  by an orange background and are indicated by CYS and CAS. CAS detoxifies cyanide
  by incorporation into cysteine forming β-cyanoalanine, which can be further metabolized
  by nitrilases. CYS catalyzes the second step of the cysteine synthesis pathway in
  bacteria and plants, after serine is converted to O-acetylserine.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02365.003'
