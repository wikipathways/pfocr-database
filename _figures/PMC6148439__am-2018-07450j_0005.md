caption: Starting from the polymer PO (soluble in organic solvents), nanoparticles
  are prepared in dichloromethane (NPO, organic pathway), or the polymer is hydrolyzed
  to its water-soluble analogue (PW) to serve as a precursor for nanoparticle formation
  in an aqueous solvent (NPW, aqueous pathway). Nanoparticles NPO are also hydrolyzed
  to render them water soluble (NPOH).
