caption: Molecular regulation of the phenotypic landscape by targeting α- and β-adrenoceptor
  signaling pathways. Top panel, Mechanistic signaling of α- adrenoceptor signaling
  and β-adrenoceptor eliciting effects on phenotypic EMT, apoptosis and cell proliferation.
  The α1-adrenoceptor signaling, activates the survival pathways NFκB and MAPK inducing
  transcriptional activation of growth genes (fos, myc). In response to α1-adrenoceptor
  pharmacologic targeting, in addition to blocking the α-adrenoceptor pathway, there
  is also inhibition of the TGF-β/ TGF-β receptor RI/RII/Smad signaling that induces
  apoptosis as well as phenotypic EMT. In response to β-adrenoceptor signaling there
  is activation of protein kinase A mechanism (though cAMP), promoting cell proliferation
  and survival via CREB activation and Bcl-2 overexpression, respectively. Lower panel,
  Impact of pharmacologic targeting of α1-adrenoeptor antagonists of the phenotypic
  interconversions (mesenchymal-EMT to epithelial-MET) within the tumor microenvironment
  landscape via regulation E-cadherin, IGFBP-3 and vimentin. Upon detachment from
  the ECM, cells unable to enter the phenotypic interconversion cycle mediated by
  TGF-β undergo anoikis. This provides the molecular targeting platform for α-adrenoceptor
  antagonists in tumor cells in the various GU organs, including the prostate and
  kidney
