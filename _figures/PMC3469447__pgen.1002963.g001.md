caption: The TOL pathway encompasses two different operons, the upper operon, (xylUWCMABN),
  the products of which transform m-xylene into 3-methylbenzoate, and the lower operon
  (xylXYZLTEGFJQKIH) that produces enzymes for further metabolism of this compound
  into TCA cycle intermediates. XylR and XylS are the transcriptional regulators that
  control the expression of either operon. The master regulatory gene xylR is encoded
  in a location adjacent to the end of the lower operon and is expressed from the
  Pr promoter. XylR is produced in an inactive form (R) that, in the presence of the
  pathway substrate (m-xylene) or pathway intermediates, such as 3-methylbenzyl alcohol
  (3MBA), changes to an active form (Ra). XylRa then activates both Pu and Ps, triggering
  expression of the upper pathway and XylS, respectively. At the same time, XylRa
  acts as repressor of its own transcription, thereby decreasing its own expression.
  In the absence of m-xylene, XylS is produced at low levels and changes from the
  inactive form (S) to an active state (Sa) by binding 3-methylbenzoate. In turn,
  XylSa is able to induce expression of the meta pathway by activating the Pm promoter
  (note that operons and regulatory elements not to scale).
