caption: Schematic diagram of glyoxalase pathway. Conversion of MG into D-lactate
  could be performed in two different ways. First one, conventional glyoxalase pathway
  consists of two enzymes, GLYI and GLYII with an intermediate product of S-D-lactoylglutathione
  (SLG). The second and unique one is glyoxalase III (GLYIII) in a single step without
  the help of any cofactor.
