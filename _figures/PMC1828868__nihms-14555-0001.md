caption: Autophagy and the Cvt pathway in yeast. Morphological steps are schematically
  shown in autophagy and the Cvt pathway. Both pathways require the sequestration
  of cargo components within distinct double-membrane vesicles, whose formation is
  thought to occur at the PAS. Autophagy is induced by inactivation of Tor kinase
  under starvation conditions such as nitrogen depletion. Organelles and bulk cytoplasm
  are sequestered into a double-membrane autophagosome, which is 300-900 nm in diameter.
  The Cvt pathway is a biosynthetic process that delivers resident hydrolases including
  Ape1 to the vacuole in vegetative conditions. The Cvt vesicle (140-160 nm in diameter)
  enwraps specific cargos such as the prApe1 oligomer (Ape1 complex). The Ape1 complex
  is also sequestered specifically by autophagosomes under starvation conditions.
  Once completed, the double-membrane vesicles target to and fuse with the vacuole,
  and the single-membrane vesicles (autophagic or Cvt body) are released into the
  lumen. Subsequently, these vesicles are degraded, allowing maturation of prApe1
  into the mature form (mApe1) by removal of its propeptide, and the degradation of
  the cytoplasm. Fluorescent images show that the cargo protein CFP-Ape1 localizes
  at the perivacuolar PAS (white arrowhead) marked by YFP-Atg8; the vacuole is labeled
  with FM 4-64 in the merged image. DIC, differential interference contrast
