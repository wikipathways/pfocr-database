caption: Proposed models for the involvement of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid
  (SA) and ethylene (ET) signalling in tomato (a) and Arabidopsis (b) on Fusarium
  oxysporum (Fo) infection. Compromised ET biosynthesis and perception reduce disease
  susceptibility, whereas compromised SA signalling promotes hypersusceptibility to
  Fo f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) infection in tomato. The SA and ET pathways act synergistically,
  in that induction of one pathway requires the intactness of the other. Although,
  in Arabidopsis, the JA pathway is required for disease susceptibility, it is not
  in tomato. By convention, the arrowhead implies positive regulation (stimulation)
  and the T‐bar implies negative regulation.
