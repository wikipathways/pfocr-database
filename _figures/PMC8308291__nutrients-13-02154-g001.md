caption: 'Illustration of the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway showing how FADS haplotypes
  utilize dietary n-3 and n-6 PUFAs for the biosynthesis of LC-PUFAs and their bioactive
  metabolites such as prostaglandins, oxylipins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, HETEs,
  protectins and resolvins. Recent studies suggest that genetic variation in FADS1
  plays a critical role in impacting the efficiency of the FADS1 (∆5 desaturase) biosynthetic
  step and this represents the rate-limiting step in the formation of LC-PUFA-containing
  structural lipids and signaling molecules [,]. In this illustration, genetic control
  of the FADS1 and FADS2 steps are represented by the valve handle in the FADS steps.
  When the handle is wide open, as is the case for people with two copies of the derived
  haplotype, individuals have the ability to more efficiently synthesize LC-PUFAs
  from dietary 18C-PUFA precursors (n-3 and n-6). When the handle is partially closed,
  as is the case for people with one copy, individuals have intermediate efficiency.
  The valve handle is almost closed for people with an ancestral haplotype, and thus
  the LC-PUFA biosynthesis efficiency is lower. Additionally, the efficiency through
  the pathway has a direct role on the ratio of n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFAs that accumulate
  in phospholipid pools (as indicated in the container in this figure). FADS = fatty
  acid desaturase; ELOVL = fatty acid elongase; LA = linoleic acid; ALA= alpha linolenic
  acid; DGA = gamma linolenic acid; DGLA= dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid: EsTA= eicosotraenoic
  acid; EPA=Eicosopentanoic acid; DHA = Docosahexanoic acid; ARA= araquidonic acid;
  DPA = Docosopentanoic acid; COX = Cyclooxygenase; LOX= lipoxygenase and HUFA-highly
  unsaturated fatty acids.'
