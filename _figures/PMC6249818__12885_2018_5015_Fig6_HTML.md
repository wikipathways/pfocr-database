caption: Therapeutic targeting of the FOXM1 genetic network in myeloma. FOXM1 is a
  proliferation-associated transcription factor that interacts in myeloma cells with
  the cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb-E2F pathway, a key regulator of the G1-to-S cell cycle transition.
  The findings of this study demonstrate that, in addition to cell cycle progression,
  FOXM1 promotes drug resistance and, possibly, cellular senescence. Another interaction
  by which FOXM1 may desensitize myeloma to drug inhibition is NEK2. Small-molecule
  inhibitors of FOXM1, CDK4/6 and NEK2 are indicated. See main text for details
