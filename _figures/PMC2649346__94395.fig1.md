caption: The iron acquisition pathway in developing erythroblasts The Fe(III)-Tf complex
  binds to specific receptors present on the cell surface, inducing the formation
  of an endocytic vesicle. Acidification of the endosome will release iron from transferrin
  and Steap3, an erythroid-specific reductase, will reduce iron to its ferrous Fe(II)
  state. DMT1/Nramp2, a proton and Fe(II) co-transporter present in the endosomal
  membrane (see putative structure in lower insert) will export iron into the cytosol.
  Most of the iron will be targeted to mitochondria to participate in heme synthesis
  or in Fe/S cluster assembly. Mitoferrin is part of the mitochondrial iron transport
  machinery. Ferrochelatase, the last enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes
  the insertion of Fe(II) into PPIX to form heme (right insert) Illustration by Jean-Pierre
  Laigneau.
