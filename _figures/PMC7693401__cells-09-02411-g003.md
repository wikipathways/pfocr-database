caption: Control of TLR4-mediated signaling in MCs. Morphine, GTS-21 and adenine have
  been proven to control TLR4-induced cytokine production on MCs (left side). Morphine
  exert its effects by acting at μ/δ opioid receptors while GTS-21 (see reference
  []) inhibits LPS-dependent response through the activation of nAchRα7 receptor.
  Although adenine has been demonstrated to inhibit TLR4-induced responses, the receptor
  or mechanism by which it mediates that effect has not been described. Symbols of
  the distinct molecules were included in the interior of the cell to illustrate the
  points of TLR4 signaling pathway blockade. ET on MCs (right side) can be developed
  by direct (blue) or indirect (red) mechanisms. Direct tolerance depends on the increase
  of SHIP, IRAK-M and SOCS1/3 expression and the inhibition of IKK, p65-NFκB, p38
  and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of the histone H3K9 demethylation also participates
  on this phenomenon. Cross tolerance includes the production and autocrine action
  of TGF-β and 2-AG. TGF-β contributes to the expression of SHIP, however, the specific
  activation of a receptor has not been described. By the activation of CB2 receptor,
  2-AG induces the expression of SHIP and IRAK-M and inhibits the phosphorylation
  of IKK and p65-NFκB, thereby, inhibiting TNF-α production. Figure created with Biorender.com.
