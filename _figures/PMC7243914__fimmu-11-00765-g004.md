caption: Immune signaling pathways in bovine monocytes. Schematic representation of
  the IFNγ and TLR9 signaling pathways in response to exogenous stimuli and M. avium
  subsp. paratuberculosis infection. (A) Signaling pathways activated in uninfected
  bovine monocyte following stimulation with IFNγ, and TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN. Both
  pathways lead to the downstream phosphorylation of unique intermediates terminating
  with the translocation of distinct transcriptional activators into the nucleus to
  induce the expression of pro-inflammatory responses and cytokines. (B) M. paratuberculosis
  infection of bovine monocytes interferes with IFNγ signaling near the receptor by
  inducing the expression of SOCS, which disrupts JAK-STAT signaling. M. paratuberculosis
  infection also dysregulates TLR9 signaling by shunting the response toward the PYK2
  pathway effectively blocking the induction of pro-inflammatory responses via MYD88.
  “P” designates protein in its phosphorylated state. Figure is adapted from Arsenault
  et al. (, ) and generated using BioRender. AP-1, adaptor protein complex 1; CpG-ODN,
  cytosine triphosphate-guanine triphosphate oligodeoxynucleotide; IFN, interferon;
  IKKα, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha; IRAK, interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase 1; JAK, janus kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEKK,
  MAPK/ERK kinase; MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary response protein; NFκB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; PYK, protein-tyrosine kinase; RAC, Ras-related C3 botulinum
  toxin substrate; SHC, Src homology 2 domain-containing-transforming protein; SOCS,
  suppressor of cytokine signaling; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  TAK, TGF-beta-activated kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TYK, non-receptor
  tyrosine protein kinase; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
