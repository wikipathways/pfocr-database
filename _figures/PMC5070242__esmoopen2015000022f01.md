  (MHC) by T-cell receptor (TCR), coactivating CD 28/B7 pathway activation and subsequent
  intracellular transduction leading to T-cell activity. On the other hand, cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) mediated downregulation of T-cell priming can be
  reverted with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. (B) Effector phase: programmed cell death-1
  (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitory interaction in the tumour microenvironment
  that can be dampened by therapy with immune checkpoint blockade.'
