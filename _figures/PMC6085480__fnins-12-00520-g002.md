caption: 'The adenosinergic pathway. Intracellular adenosine is generated from AMP
  or SAH. After intracellular uptake, it is phosphorylated to AMP by AK or converted
  into inosine by ADA. ATP is released into the extracellular environment and hydrolyzed
  by the concerted action of CD39 and CD73 into adenosine. In response to metabolic
  stress, adenosine accumulates in the extracellular environment. Extracellular adenosine
  can bind to four different G-protein-coupled receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) or
  be transported back into the cell via ENTs. Abbreviations: A1, A2A, A2B, A3, adenosine
  receptors; AC, adenylyl cyclase; ADA, adenosine deaminase; AK, adenosine kinase;
  AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic AMP; ENT,
  equilibrative nucleoside transporter; 5NT, 5’-nucleotidase; PDE, phosphodiesterase;
  SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine; SAHH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase.'
