caption: Schematic illustrating the proposed pathway for reduced store-operated Ca2+
  entry (SOCE) in pulmonary endothelial cells after chronic hypoxia and areas for
  future research. Upon receptor binding and activation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) is formed and triggers Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via
  IP3 receptors (IP3Rs). Depletion of ER Ca2+ levels initiates stromal interaction
  molecule 1 (STIM1) translocation to areas close to the plasma membrane, allowing
  interactions with Orai1 channels and activating SOCE. Cholesterol not only helps
  to form caveoli and lipid rafts where Orai1 is localized but also appears to facilitate
  STIM1-Orai1 interactions. The resulting Ca2+ entry increases cytosolic Ca2+ levels
  and has been shown to promote production of nitric oxide (NO) and PGI2, both of
  which diffuse to underlying pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and
  exert vasodilation and inhibition of cell growth. Reduction of cholesterol by chronic
  hypoxia disrupts STIM1-Orai1 interactions and reduces SOCE. The consequent reduction
  in Ca2+ levels could contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by
  limiting vasodilation and allowing PASMC proliferation. Green boxes highlight areas
  where questions remain and further research could be focused.
