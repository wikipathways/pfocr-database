caption: Diagrammatic indication of the cytokines, transcription factors, and signalling
  molecules which polarise virgin CD4 cells into T helper cell type I cells. Interferon
  γ (IFN-γ) induces the transcription factor T-bet which induces the high affinity
  interleukin (IL)-12 receptor on T cells. IL-12 can then bind to its receptor, and
  activate STAT4, which goes to the nucleus and activates IFN-γ transcription. A plethora
  of other cytokines can synergise with IL-12 to boost IFN-γ production. IL-23, an
  IL-12-like cytokine, seems to be more important in activating memory cells. A crucial
  component of this pathway is the feedback loop by which IFN-γ continues to drive
  T cells along a Th1 pathway.
