caption: Human ANP(A), BNP(B), CNP(C), and DNP(D)gene structure, biosynthetic pathway,
  source and primary function. (A) ANP is originally synthesized as a 151-amino acid
  precursor, which is further synthesized as a 126-amino acid pro ANP (γ-ANP) in the
  atrial myocytes of the heart, along with a 25-amino acid signal peptide. After removal
  of signal peptide by signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum, pro ANP is store
  in atrial cardiomyocyte granules. In the heart, then pro ANP is proteolyzed into
  an active αANP (28-amino acid) and an inactive NT-proANP by the convertase Corin.
  The NT-proANP contains other three natriuretic peptides, the long-acting natriuretic
  peptide (LANP), the vessel dilator (VSDL), and the kaliuretic peptide (KP); In the
  kidney, the ANP prohormone is cleaved between amino acid (a.a.) 94 and 95; (B) Ventricular
  myocytes produce a precursor of 134 amino acid (pre-pro BNP), which is further cleaved
  to obtain a signal peptide and pro-BNP (108-amino acid). During the secretion process,
  pro-BNP is cleaved by enzyme Furin into a biologically active BNP (32-amino acid),
  and another fragment of biologically inactive NT-proBNP (76-amino acid) which comprises
  an N-terminal fragment. The enzyme Corin can also proteolyze it into an active BNP
  (29-amino acid). Both are secreted from the ventricle into the peripheral circulation;
  (C) When CNP is release from cells it is cleaved into a 53 amino acid peptide with
  biological activity and inactive 50 amino acid N-terminal fragment, NT-proCNP by
  Furin. CNP-53 is further cleaved to yield a 22 amino acid peptide that is almost
  identical biological activity in vitro as CNP-53. The precise mechanism, regulating
  the formation of CNP-22 remains unknown; (D) Pro-DNP is cleaved into 38-amino acid
  with biological activity (the mechanism regulating remains unknown).
