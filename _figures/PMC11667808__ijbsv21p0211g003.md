caption: 'The underlying mechanism through which BDNF confers neuroprotective effects.
  (a) Production and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is
  synthesized and secreted by cells in the neuropil layer and the inner nuclear layer
  of the retina. A significant portion of BDNF is transported retrogradely from neural
  cells in the brain to the retina. BDNF exerts its effects by directly binding to
  the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
  and/or indirectly binding to TrkB expressed in Müller glial cells, thereby facilitating
  the survival of neuronal cells. In glaucoma, elevated intraocular pressure impedes
  the retrograde transport of BDNF from the brain, resulting in damage to RGCs. (b)
  BDNF can be activated in two distinct forms: the prodomain of BDNF (pro-neurotrophin
  isoform of BDNF, pro-BDNF) and the mature isoform of BDNF (mBDNF), these forms primarily
  exert their functions through distinct signaling pathways. ProBDNF interacts with
  p75NTR and the transport protein sortilin to form a proBDNF/p75NTR/sortilin binding
  complex, which subsequently induces neuronal cell apoptosis. In contrast, proBDNF
  is processed into its mature form, mBDNF, which exhibits a high affinity for TrkB.
  This interaction triggers autophosphorylation and dimerization of TrkB, thereby
  activating downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for neuronal survival
  and plasticity. BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor, TrkB tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B, RGCs retinal ganglion cells, p75NTR p75 neurotrophin receptor'
