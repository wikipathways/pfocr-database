caption: Proposed model linking JAM-A and HER2 in breast cancer. High JAM-A expression
  in the cell membrane of certain cancer cells leads to upregulated expression of
  the transcription factor FOXA1, by a pathway potentially involving β-catenin (dotted
  line). FOXA1 is capable of translocating to the nucleus and turning on the transcription
  of HER2, whereupon a subsequent upregulation of HER2 protein expression would be
  predicted to drive tumorigenic signaling via pathways including the activation of
  AKT and ERK.
