caption: Mechanisms involved in type I IFN production and its receptor signaling.
  Several different stimuli including pathogen derived LPS, glycoproteins, RNA and
  DNA can induce type I IFNs (IFNα and IFNβ) via upstream pattern recognition receptors.
  TLRs sense the endosomally located PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns)
  and DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns) and recruit TRIF (TRL3 and TLR4)
  or Myd88 (TLR4, 7, 8, and 9), which further transfer the signals downstream to IRF3
  and IRF7. RLRs, NLRs, DAI, STING, and related receptors sense nucleic acids in the
  cytoplasm. The RNA sensors, RIG-I, MDA-5, and LGP2, and DNA sensor STING use the
  adapter protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) to transfer signals
  to IRFs for type I IFN transcription. RIG-I and MDA-5 also sense ligands generated
  by RNA polymerase III from cytoplasmic DNA PAMPs. All these pathways utilize the
  common downstream kinases, TBK1/IKKε for activating Interferon transcription factors.
  Type I IFNs bind to IFNAR receptor and activate a robust transcriptional pathway
  through a JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The transcriptional complexes activated by
  type I IFN signaling bind to specific ISRE/GAS sequences and lead to the expression
  of several genes important for cell death, cell proliferation and immune responses.
