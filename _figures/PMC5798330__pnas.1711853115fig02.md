caption: Transcripts relating to the classical complement pathway are overabundant
  in subclinical and active TB. (A) Top four enriched canonical pathways listed by
  significance (P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact) for the 893-transcript signature of active
  TB shown. The bar chart shows the proportion of these pathways represented in the
  893-, 203-, and 82-transcript signatures. (B) Schematic of the complement pathway,
  created using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, showing components of the pathway
  with overabundant transcripts in active (n = 15) and subclinical TB (n = 10) compared
  with latent TB (n = 25) (in pink). Box and whisker plots show normalized expression
  of complement components SERPING1 and C1QB (part of 82-transcript signature) and
  C2 and C5 (part of 203-transcript signature) by TB disease state. (C) Box and whisker
  plots show normalized expression of Ig-related transcripts FCGBP and FCGR1C (part
  of 82-transcript signature) and FCGR1A and FCGR1B (part of 203-transcript signature)
  by TB disease state.
