caption: Schematic demonstrating multiple potential mechanisms by which β-catenin
  may modulate HIV transcription and latency, based on integrated findings from previous
  studies and data presented here. (1) β-catenin and TCF-4 form a complex with nuclear
  matrix-associated protein SMAR1 at the HIV LTR just upstream of the transcriptional
  start site and Sp-1, NFκB, and AP-1 binding sites. This complex pulls the HIV LTR
  towards the nuclear matrix, occluding access of RNA polymerase []. (2) β-catenin
  positively regulates levels of TCF-4, which has been shown to block binding and
  transcriptional regulation of NFκB at the HIV LTR []. (3) β-catenin further regulates
  c-Myc levels, which recruit HDAC enzymes, resulting in the viral promoter being
  more densely packed in chromatin []. (4) β-catenin also mediates self-renewal and
  cell proliferation of memory T cells through CBP, which may contribute to perpetuating
  the reservoir of latently infected cells [], (5) A source of β-catenin signaling
  are CD8+ T cells, which secrete Wnt proteins resulting in stimulation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway in CD4+ T cells, which culminates in accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  and translocation to the nucleus []. This may explain the observed role of CD8+
  T cells in maintaining HIV latency. Notably, other cells may serve as a source of
  Wnt proteins and β-catenin pathway modulating factors.
