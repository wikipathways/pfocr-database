caption: Different proteins transcriptionally upregulated the expression of various
  lncRNAs. (A) SMAD2 transcriptionally upregulated MACC1-AS1. MACC1-AS1 stabilized
  and promoted pyruvate kinase M2-driven phosphorylation of NOTCH1. Oncogenic NOTCH1
  pathway was activated by MACC1-AS1 through pyruvate kinase M2. (B) MTA2TR and ATF3
  assembled in the nucleus and stimulated the expression of MTA2. MTA2 stabilized
  HIF protein and consequently HIF transcriptionally activated MTA2TR. (C) BX111 was
  transcriptionally stimulated by HIF-1α. Furthermore, BX111 facilitated the binding
  of YB1 to promoter region of ZEB1.
