caption: The pathological hallmarks of PD and the interplay of aging, environmental
  hazards, and genetics in the pathogenesis of PD. (A) The pathological hallmarks
  of Parkinson’s disease include dopaminergic neuronal death, α-synuclein aggregates,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation.
  (B) PD is a multifactorial disorder involving aging, genetics, and environmental
  factors, associated with dopaminergic neuronal death. Gene mutations associate with
  PD includes DJ-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1), parkin, leucine-rich repeat
  serine/threonine kinase-2 (LRRK2), Synuclein alpha (SNAC), and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
  hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1). Neurotoxins (e.g., rotenone, paraquat) and gene mutations
  of DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, LRRK2, and SNAC induce mitochondria complex I inhibition,
  ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondria depolarization,
  and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons to promote neuronal death
  in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Overexpression of SNAC gene mutations enhance
  α-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies of PD brain. UCHL1 gene mutations impair
  ubiquitin-proteasome systems and further induce autophagy lysosomal pathway dysfunction,
  contributing to Lewy body formation in dopaminergic neurons.
