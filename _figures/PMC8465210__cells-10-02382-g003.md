caption: The canonical TGF-β pathway. The TGF-β ligand binds to the TGF-β type II
  receptor (TβRII). This binding induces TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) to form a hetero-tetrameric
  complex with TβRII. TβRI subsequently phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then
  form a complex with SMAD4. Under physiological conditions in normal cells, the resulting
  SMAD2/3/4 complex translocates to the nucleus, recruits co-transcriptional factors,
  and activates genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, such as the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor, p21, and the death-associated protein kinase (DAPK). In advanced
  cancer, the same SMAD2/3/4 complex can instead promote the expression of SNAIL,
  SLUG, TWIST and ZEB, which are transcription factors known to promote the EMT.
