caption: 'Seventh extracted sub-graph. Lysine biosynthesis, degradation (lysine decarboxylase,
  p-value: 0.16) and charging and modification of its corresponding tRNAs was down-regulated,
  while degradation of fructoselysine and its further processing into the glycolysis
  pathway was up-regulated. For box colours see legend of Figure 3.'
