caption: The effect of age on the hepatotoxic pathway for paracetamol-induced liver
  injury. At therapeutic doses, paracetamol metabolised primarily in the livervia
  the Phase II metabolism (conjugation). A small amount of drug undergoes Phase I
  CYP450- (CYP-)mediated N-hydroxylation to form N-acetyl-p-amino-benzoquinone immine
  (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite which is conjugated with hepatic glutathione (GSH) and
  is neutralised. The major metabolites are excreted via the urine or bile by Phase
  III transporters. Saturation of conjugation pathways results in increased use of
  the CYP450 pathway, increased NAPQI formation, and increased depletion of hepatic
  glutathione. NAPQI can cause injury through direct cell stress, direct mitochondrial
  inhibition, or through immune reactions. Initial injury leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  leading to either apoptosis of damaged cells, or necrosis with recovery, chronic
  liver injury or actual liver failure, and death as potential outcomes. Additionally,
  necrosis can stimulate the inflammatory response leading to cytokine release and
  further potentiation of the immune reaction. Ageing can act at multiple parts of
  the pathway to either increase (↑) or decrease (↓) susceptibility to hepatotoxicity.
  It must be noted, however, that this is likely to vary between individuals. The
  effect of ageing on Phase III transporters is somewhat unknown (?) in humans. Picture
