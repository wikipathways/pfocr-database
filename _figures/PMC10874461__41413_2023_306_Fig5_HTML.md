caption: Pathological mechanisms of osteoporosis induced by diabetes, glucocorticoids,
  and psychological stress. a Glucocorticoid (GC) inhibits the proliferation and increases
  the apoptosis of osteoblasts by downregulating Wnt signaling, repressing the production
  of sex steroids, decreasing calcium absorption, and reducing growth factors. GC
  decreases the differentiation of adipocytes in bone marrow by decreasing the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. GCs also promote the apoptosis of osteocytes by increasing the influx of
  Ca2+. GCs decrease apoptosis and promote the survival of osteoclasts by upregulating
  RANKL and downregulating M-CSF. b T2DM-associated osteoporosis is characterized
  by decreased bone turnover and impaired microarchitecture, which has a complex pathological
  mechanism and involves multiple signaling pathways. T2DM affects bone metabolism,
  demineralization, bone marrow adiposity, and calcium balance through hyperglycemia.
  Other coexisting conditions in T2DM, such as obesity, impaired renal function, hypercalciuria,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), more advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation,
  inflammation, and peptides in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, contribute to the
  higher prevalence of osteoporosis in T2DM patients. Estrogen and androgen can scavenge
  ROS directly or indirectly by changing cytokine profiles and exert protective effects
  by nonskeletal mechanisms such as the regulation of adipose tissues. Estrogen protects
  pancreatic β cells and increases insulin production to indirectly alleviate diabetic
  osteoporosis. c Psychological stress contributes to osteoporosis through the hypothalamic‒pituitary‒adrenal
  (HPA) axis and the brain-immune connection. Psychological stress promotes bone loss
  by regulating growth hormones, glucocorticoids, sex hormones, and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. MSCs mesenchymal stem cells, M-CSF macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
