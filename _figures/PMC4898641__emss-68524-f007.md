caption: Maternal supplementation with folic acid prevents many cases of spina bifida,
  most probably through its regulation of epigenetic modifications (methylation) and/or
  cell proliferation (through a role in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines)
  in the embryo, although the exact mechanism is incompletely understood. However,
  defects in enzymes involved in these pathways might mean that folic acid supplementation
  alone is inadequate and point to the need to supplement with other metabolites (green
  boxes). Thus far, mutations in the genes encoding several enzymes involved in the
  folate one-carbon metabolism pathway (especially in the gene encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR); maternal and fetal mutations) and the glycine cleavage system
  (which produces formate in the mitochondria; fetal mutations only) have been definitively
  associated with increased risk of spina bifida. Solid arrows indicate the key metabolic
  reactions. Dashed arrows indicate metabolic pathways that involve multiple reactions.
