caption: Overview of the neuroprotective mechanisms of curcumin against drugs of abuse.
  Curcumin exerts its neuroprotective effects against drugs of abuse, such as methamphetamine,
  cocaine, morphine, nicotine, and alcohol, through various mechanisms. These mechanisms
  include inhibition of neuroinflammation, promoting antioxidative responses, decreasing
  apoptosis, facilitating alpha-synuclein clearance, decreasing opioid mu receptor
  expression, epigenetic regulation, and activating the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway
