caption: Biosynthetic pathway of melatonin in plants and bacteria. Plant-derived enzymes
  are highlighted in blue boxes, whereas those originating from bacteria are marked
  with pink box. Enzymes shared by both plants and bacteria are marked with green
  boxes. Enzymes include tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC),
  tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H), serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), acetyl serotonin
  methyltransferase (ASMT), and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT). Abbreviations
  correspond to intermediates and enzymes involved in the pathway
