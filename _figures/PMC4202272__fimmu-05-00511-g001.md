caption: RANK signaling pathways. The RANK receptor lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity
  and therefore utilizes interaction with adaptor and docking proteins, including
  TRAFs 2, 3, 5, and 6, Gab2, and Cbl to activate downstream signaling. Gab2 and Cbl
  are associated with RANK-mediated activation of c-Src, PI3 kinase (PI3K), and Akt,
  while TRAFs 2 and 6 can activate the TAB1/TAB2/TAK1 complex, which (along with other
  upstream kinases) leads to activation of IKKβ and MAP kinases (MAPK). Activation
  of these pathways promotes translocation and activation of transcription factors
  including NFATc1, CREB, NFκB, AP-1, and MITF. Specific RANK-activated gene transcription
  varies depending on cell-type, but often involves feed forward expression of NFATc1,
  c-fos, and NFκB-related genes. RANK-associated TRAF3 has been implicated in negative
  regulation of the non-canonical NFκB2 pathway through regulation of the upstream
  kinase NIK. Inhibition of NIK is mediated by the TRAF3 RING finger domain, and is
  overcome when RANK activation by RANKL triggers autophagic/lysosomal degradation
  of TRAF3. While many of these mechanisms may be generalizable to various RANK-expressing
  cell-types, some mechanisms appear thus far to be osteoclast (OC) lineage-specific.
  The best characterized of these OC-associated mechanisms involves synergistic signaling
  between RANK and ITAM motif-containing proteins DAP12 and FcRγ (which associate
  with cell surface receptors OSCAR, PIR-A, or TREM-2) to activate the Syk-PLCγ pathway
  and flux calcium. This activity enhances NFATc1 and CREB activities. Synergy with
  RANK occurs via coordinate activation of Btk/Tec. RANK further regulates calcium
  flux in OC lineage cells by a mechanism involving transmembrane protein 64 (TMEM64)
  interaction with the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2).
  This mechanism further promotes CREB and NFATc1 activity.
