caption: Data presented here supports a model in which MC4R may couple to both Gαs
  signaling and regulation of Kir7.1 activity in PVN MC4R neurons. α-MSH results in
  elevation of intracellular cAMP through activation of Gαs, and inhibition of K+
  efflux through Kir7.1, both of which are depolarizing. AgRP lowers the constitutive
  activity of the MC4R and blocks α-MSH binding, but data here shows that AgRP also
  acts as an agonist to increase K+ efflux through Kir7.1, producing a strong hyperpolarizing
  signal. The relative distribution and composition of the MC4R signaling complex
  in different subcellular compartments of PVN MC4R neurons has not been directly
  determined. Earlier models of α-MSH and AgRP action suggested competitive binding
  of these peptides to individual MC4R sites (orange box). Existing neuroanatomical
  data characterizing POMC and AgRP neuronal projections shows that α-MSH may act
  independently of AgRP at many sites in the CNS, since AgRP immunoreactive fibers
  are only observed in a subset of MC4R expressing nuclei containing POMC-immunoreative
  fibers (right circle, for review see ). The ability of AgRP to act independently
  of α-MSH as a potent hyperpolarizing agonist, via regulation of Kir7.1, suggests
  the likely existence of independent AgRP sites of action (left circle). Recent reconstruction
  of EM images of the PVN in which POMC and AgRP containing synaptic vesicles have
  been specifically labeled with a genetically encoded marker provides preliminary
  anatomical support for this new model. This study demonstrates that 52% of AgRP
  boutons in the PVN are not found in synapses, potentially supporting volume transmission
  of AgRP that may lead to competition with α-MSH at synaptic and/or non-synaptic
  sites. Additionally, the study found the vast majority of AgRP and POMC synaptic
  sites localized to different subcellular compartments of PVN neurons, supporting
  the independent action of both peptides. Synaptic release sites on soma were almost
  exclusively AgRP-containing, while POMC release sites were concentrated on distal
  dendrites. Another MC4R signaling pathway, involving cAMP/PKA-dependent activation
  of KATP channels and α-MSH induced hyperpolarization, has been demonstrated in MC4R
  neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem (bottom right).
  Thus, while Kir7.1 signaling appears to be essential for depolarization of PVN MC4R
  neurons by α-MSH, Gαs signaling and elevation of cAMP may be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing,
  depending on the cellular context.
