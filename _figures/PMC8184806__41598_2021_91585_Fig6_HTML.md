caption: 'Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection mechanism by
  preventing the induction of the IFN-I pathway. The virus inactivates antagonistic
  members responsive to the viral replication system: SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, ORF8, N and
  ORF3 inhibit the IFN-I signaling pathway, via NF-κB, being also related to the inflammation
  activation mechanism. Regarding SARS-CoV, (N) encapsulates the virus genomic RNA
  protecting and allowing, in the initial stage, the viral replication. ORF3 has been
  mentioned for its pro-apoptotic activity and is probably associated with a reduction
  in apoptosis-mediated antiviral defense in infected cells. When the NF-κB activation
  pathway is inhibited by the virus, another pro-inflammatory response, such as caspase-1,
  affects the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes. Mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) act on the IFN-I pathway and directly on inflammatory elements.
  From SARS-CoV-2 infection and pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting from the action
  of macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), activation of the p38/MAPK
  pathway occurs acting on the NF-κB, STAT pathway, thus promoting high expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α.'
