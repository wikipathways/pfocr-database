caption: Simplified outline showing key proteins within the extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptotic pathways in response to extra- and intracellular stress. Generally, death
  domain-containing receptors including CD95 (APO-1/Fas) can be activated in response
  to external signals (such as Fas ligand), which triggers the activity of the extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway through the Fas-associated death domain (FADD). This pathway is
  mediated by recruitment and activation of caspase-8 (Pro-casp 8), an initiator caspase,
  in the death-inducing signaling complex followed by direct cleavage of downstream
  effector caspases such as caspase-3 (casp 3). Thus, casp 8 is an important pro-apoptotic
  protein for the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Initiation of the intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway results from intracellular stress, leading to mitochondrial damage that
  is characterized by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and cytochrome
  c (cyt c) release. This triggers activation of initiator caspase-9 (casp 9) and
  ultimately results in activation of effector caspases, such as caspase 3 (casp 3),
  that mediates the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and finally leads
  to apoptosis. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum stress that can be mediated by
  oxidative stress elevates intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release that subsequently
  mediates calpain cleavage, leading to the activation of caspase-4 (casp 4), which
  mediates the cleavage of casp 9, casp 3, and PARP, and finally leads to apoptosis.
