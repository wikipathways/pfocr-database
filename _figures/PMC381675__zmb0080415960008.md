caption: A model for regulation of the PKR-eIF2α phosphorylation pathway by E6. During
  infection, HPV gene expression produces transcripts containing dsRNA structures
  able to activate PKR by autophosphorylation (step 1). Activated PKR then catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 (step 2), an event that leads to the translational
  inhibition and induction of apoptosis (step 3). Although most of the genes are translationally
  repressed by eIF2α phosphorylation, translation of specific mRNAs is likely to escape
  from this general translational blockade. These mRNAs may encode proteins that are
  involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Translational
  inhibition by PKR rapidly downregulates HPV-18 E6 protein synthesis (step 4). However,
  the remainder of HPV-18 E6 is capable of counteracting this translational blockade
  by facilitating the dephosphorylation of eIF2α through the recruitment of GADD34/PP1
  holophosphatase complex (step 5). This results in a translational relief that permits
  the expression of proteins with antiapoptotic properties. This may represent an
  important mechanism utilized by the high-risk HPVs to counteract the antiviral properties
  of PKR activation and promote virus-mediated oncogenesis.
