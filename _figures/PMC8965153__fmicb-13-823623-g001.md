caption: 'Predicted menaquinone biosynthesis pathway in L. cremoris strain MG1363
  and mutants. MK biosynthesis in L. cremoris/L. lactis is predicted to follow a pathway
  consisting of three parts: (i) synthesis of the naphthoquinone structure (the head
  group), (ii) synthesis of the isoprenyl side chain (the tail group), and (iii) joining
  of the head and tail structures giving the MK. The head group synthesis starts with
  chorismate generated from the Shikimate pathway with the first step catalyzed by
  a menaquinone-specific isochorismate synthase (predicted encoding gene is menF),
  and the tail group synthesis starts with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), containing
  a single isoprene unit, generated from mevalonate pathway. For building the side
  chain, first a geranyltranstransferase (predicted encoding gene is ispA) is required
  to form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) containing three isoprene units. More IPP is
  linked to FPP to form longer isoprene chains, and this step is catalyzed by a prenyl
  diphosphate synthase (predicted encoding gene is llmg_0196). The latter enzyme also
  is thought to play a role in determination of the length of the isoprene chain (;
  ). Finally, the naphthoquinone head group – 1.4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA),
  and the polyprenyl tail group are combined by isoprenyl diphosphate:1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate
  isoprenyltransferase to form demethylmenaquinone (DMK), which is methylated to give
  MK. Mainly MK-9, MK-8, and MK-3 are formed in original L. cremoris strain MG1363
  (green box). Mutants ΔmenF,ΔispA, andΔllmg_0196 are expected to produce no MK, only
  MK-1, and only MK-3, respectively. Genes targeted in this study are shown in green
  color. Predicted MK production route and profiles in respective gene deletion mutants
  are shown in red boxes.'
