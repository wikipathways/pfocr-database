caption: A proposed model illustrating autophagy-mediated cholesterol trafficking
  and its role in the regulation of steroid production. In the endocrine cells of
  the Drosophila prothoracic gland, nutritional signaling regulates steroidogenesis
  by controlling autophagy-dependent mobilization of lipid droplet (LD)-stored cholesterol
  into the steroid-biosynthetic pathway. Atg8a/LC3-positive (autophagic) vesicles
  sequester and traffic the steroid hormone precursor cholesterol for delivery to
  the steroid biosynthetic pathway. Atg8/LC3-mediated trafficking interacts with late
  endosomes and lysosomes by fusion, forming amphisomes (vesicles that are positive
  for Atg8a/LC3 as well as Rab7, a late endosomal marker), and autolysosomes (vesicles
  that are positive for Atg8a/LC3 as well as a lysosomal-associated membrane protein,
  Lamp, a lysosomal marker). This autophagy-mediated cholesterol trafficking mechanism
  is controlled by nutrient-dependent (insulin signaling) activation of the wts/Warts
  tumor-suppressor pathway, through regulation of the microRNA ban/bantam, by its
  downstream effector yki/Yorkie. This process is regulated by ban through its modulatory
  effects on Tor and ecdysone receptor (EcR) signaling, both of which control autophagy-mediated
  mobilization and trafficking of LD-cholesterol.
