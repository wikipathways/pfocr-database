caption: miRNA-gene-network associated with SIRT3 ablation from the microarray data.
  Pathway analysis was performed with a statistical cutoff of p <0.02. Green trapezoid
  represents downregulated miRNA, and red trapezoid represents upregulated miRNA.
  There were two highly interconnected networks associated with endothelial SIRT3
  deletion.A, Network 1 is involved in the regulation Smad2/3, TGF-β1, and TP53. The
  red circle represents upregulated genes.B, Network 2 is associated with DICER1,
  AGO2, TNFSF12, and Notch signaling. The red circle represents upregulated genes.
