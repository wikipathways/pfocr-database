caption: Leaf-specific DEG attributed to photosynthesis are enhanced in SPL13RNAi
  plants. a Summary of affected metabolites and pathways between drought-stressed
  EV and SPL13RNAi leaf tissues, b transcripts coding for light-dependent photosynthetic
  reaction in the chloroplast thylakoids, c carbon dioxide fixation in Calvin cycle
  in chloroplast stroma region, d photorespiration-associated transcripts involving
  chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisome differentially regulated between drought-stressed
  SPL13RNAi and EV plants. Transcript fold changes are provided in log 2 with red
  and blue colours representing increased and decreased transcript levels relative
  to EV. Minor CHO corresponds to minor charbohydrate; TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle;
  OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. N = 3 biological replicates for each genotype
  and treatment condition
