caption: Two metabolic pathways of conversion between l-methionine and l-cysteine.
  In the forward transsulfuration pathway of E. coli, O-succinyl-l-homoserine and
  l-cysteine are linked by cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS), resulting in the generation
  of cystathionine. Cystathionine β-lyase cleaves the bond between the Cβ and the
  Sγ atoms to generate l-homocysteine and pyruvate. The l-homocysteine is finally
  converted to l-methionine by another enzyme. In the reverse transsulfuration pathway
  of human, l-homocysteine, which is made from l-methionine, and l-serine are linked
  by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), resulting in the generation of cystathionine.
  In the case of L. plantarum, O-acetyl-l-serine (l-OAS) is used instead of l-serine.
  Cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL) cleaves the bond between the Cγ and the Sδ atoms to
  generate l-cysteine and α-ketobutylate. Dotted lines in the figure indicates the
  covalent bonds to be cleaved by the lyase enzymes. The figure was drawn by ChemDraw
  (CambridgeSoft).
