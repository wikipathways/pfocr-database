caption: Intracellular activation of AC converts ATP to cAMP resulting in modulation
  of activity in growth promoting pathways. Some of the multiple downstream cascades
  that regulate growth and are modulated by cAMP are shown. The majority of cAMP effects
  on signal transduction have been ascribed to cAMP-induced activation of PKA. However,
  PKA-independent actions of cAMP have also been demonstrated through specific activation
  of exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC 1 and 2). Effects of cAMP
  are cell type-specific and often hinge upon differential expression of RAF isoforms.
  These critical regulators of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  can either be stimulated by cAMP (RAF-B) or inhibited by cAMP (RAF-C). Prolonged
  stimulation of cAMP might cause transcriptional activation of targets such as AP-1
  and Lot-1, which can regulate cell survival, and repression of cell cycle regulators
  (e.g. cyclins and cyclin dependant kinases) leading to growth arrest. Finally, elevation
  of intracellular cAMP levels has also been shown to induce apoptotic cell death
  through PKA, protein kinase C (PKC), EPAC and Akt-mediated pathways.
