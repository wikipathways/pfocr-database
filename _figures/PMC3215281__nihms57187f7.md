  on the hairpin since its 5’ end is hidden. The binding of MSH2/MSH3 stabilizes the
  repetitive hairpin, preventing flap removal. The slipped-stranded intermediate is
  converted into an expansion by an error-prone repair pathway. [B] The nucleotide
  excision repair model for expansion. There has been no direct data to support such

  lesion recognition, a 10–20 nucleotide bubble is opened by TFIIH containing the
  XPB an XPD helicases followed by XPA binding. Strand cleavage occurs on the 5’ or
  3’ side of the lesion by ERCC1/XPF and XPG, respectively. The hairpins lesion is
  removed, but small slipped structures form during gap filling synthesis by the replication
  machinery including RFC, PCNA processivity factor, and DNA polymerases δ/ε. The
  loops are sealed into the DNA with DNA ligase I, and processed to generate an expansion.'
