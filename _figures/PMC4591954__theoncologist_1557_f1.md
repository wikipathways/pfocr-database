caption: 'Therapeutic targeting of the canonical WNT pathway. The WNT signaling pathway
  plays an essential role in regulating self-renewal of the cancer stem cell population
  and tumorigenesis by enhancing cellular proliferation and survival. When WNT ligands
  are not present (left), β-catenin is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and marked for
  degradation by the destruction complex that is composed of Axin, adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). This results in the association
  of the repression complex HDAC, Groucho, and TCF/LEF, which prevents WNT-dependent
  transcription. The binding of WNT ligand to the frizzled receptor (right) activates
  dishevelled (DVL). This leads to the inactivation of the destruction complex and
  subsequent translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus and to WNT-dependent transcription.
  Many different compounds are currently under preclinical (blue) and clinical (red)
  development that target many different components of the WNT pathway to inhibit
  WNT-dependent tumor growth. A detailed description of the inhibitors under development
  is shown in .Abbreviations: CBP, CREB binding protein; CK1, casein kinase 1; DKK,
  dickkopf-related protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase inhibitors; LEF, lymphoid enhancer
  factor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; TCF, T cell transcription
  factor; Ub, ubiquitin.'
