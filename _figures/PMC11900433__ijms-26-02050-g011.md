caption: 'Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Under non-stressed conditions,
  GRP78 attaches to unfolded protein response (UPS) sensors, IRE-1α, ATF-6, and PERK.
  In the presence of unfolded/misfolded proteins, GRP78 is detached from the UPR sensors;
  once activated, GRP78 induces complex pro-survival autophagy pathways, the antioxidant
  ERAD pathway, and ER regeneration, or pro-apoptotic and ferroptosis mechanisms.
  Also, ROS produced serves as a signal for activation or modification of the cellular
  stress response, once ROS-oxidated cysteine residues in the UPR sensors can mediate
  UPR signals. IRE-1α: Inositol-Requiring Kinase 1; ATF-6: Activating Transcription
  Factor 6; PERK: RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase;
  eiF2a: Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 Alpha; XBP1: X-box Binding Protein 1; CHOP:
  C/EBP Homologous Protein; ASK1: Apoptosis Signal-regulating Kinase 1; TRAF2: Tumor
  Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2'
