caption: Representation of the changes in the abundance of proteins associated with
  carbon metabolism in T. pseudonana at the onset of nitrogen starvation. Increases
  are shown by thick arrows, and no decreases were seen. Boxes show where carbon skeletons
  from amino acid degradation feed into the pathway.
