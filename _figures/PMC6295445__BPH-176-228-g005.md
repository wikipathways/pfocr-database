caption: The nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway and simplified nitrite chemical biology in
  the vasculature. The nitrate–nitrite–NO path is a complementary route for NO generation
  in the vasculature that occurs under hypoxic conditions, when canonical NO generation
  at normoxia from eNOS (upper left) is less effective. Nitrate is ingested (upper
  right) from various foods including beetroot and leafy greens. Oral bacteria in
  the salivary glands reduce nitrate to nitrite, which is subsequently swallowed,
  traversing the oesophagus and into the acidic gastric fluids and into GI tract (hollow
  arrowheads). Some of the nitrite (as nitrous acid) may dehydrate and disproportionate
  (Equations  and  in text) to generate NO in the stomach. Orally swallowed nitrite
  has been suggested to be bioactivated in the stomach under non‐enzymic acidic conditions.
  Nitrite may also escape the GI tract and enter the circulation (bottom right). Numerous
  reactions occur in RBCs (centre left), especially at the point of artery‐to‐vein
  transport (Hb is ~50% O2‐saturated or P 50) where the nitrite reduction rate by
  deoxyHb is maximized. NiR activity yields metHb and an equivalent of NO (Equation ).
  metHb reacts with nitrite to form a radical NO2•‐bound ferrohaem, which reacts rapidly
  with NO to generate N2O3 (Figure , path a), responsible for RSNO formation (Equation ).
  N2O3 is one mechanism by which NO is proposed to escape from the RBC and generate
  NO (Equation ) in the smooth muscle. NO may also be autocaptured by deoxyHb generating
  ferrous nitrosyl‐Hb (Equation , not shown) and subsequently released via oxidative
  nitrosylation (Equations  and , not shown), or NO may react with oxyHb to liberate
  nitrate (Equation ). The nitrate is secreted from the plasma into the salivary glands
  (upper right), starting the process anew. XO and eNOS found in both endothelial
  cells and the surface of RBCs have been suspected to generate NO from nitrite, but
  only under hypoxic and more acidic conditions (bottom left). Finally, nitrite is
  generated by the copper plasma protein ceruloplasmin from NO, preventing dioxygenation
  to nitrate or reductive nitrosylation by ferrihaems (not shown).
