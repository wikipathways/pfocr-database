caption: The role of ependyma on neurogenesis in normal and neuroinflammation induced
  by GMH/IVH conditions. In healthy ependyma, phosphorylation of Foxj1 transcription
  factor through non-canonical IKK2 signaling (IKKγ/NF-KB-independent manner) activates
  Ank3 pathway to maintain the mature multiciliated ependyma. In this status, ependymal
  cells exert direct control on neurogenesis by maintaining the pinwheel-like structure,
  by cell–cell contacts through basolateral adhesion molecules (N-Cadherin, and fractone
  Bulbs), and by paracrine signaling (Noggin, PRL2, PEDF, CCN1, MMP12, TSK). Additionally,
  ependymal cells maintain the appropriated microenvironment for stem cell function
  through its protective and homeostatic barrier function. In this conditions, neural
  stem cells produce the needed progeny. After GMH/IVH, TLR4 pathway is activated,
  IKKγ/NF-KB canonical activity triggered, Foxj1 transcription factor is reduced and
  its degradation by ubiquitin proteosome system is potentiated, initiating loss of
  mature status. Pinwheel-like structure disappears, control of stem cell function
  by cell–cell contacts through basolateral adhesion molecules is altered and the
  paracrine control of stem cell function becomes defective. The microenvironment
  that ependymal cells generate for proper stem cell function is disrupted and homeostatic
  barrier function of ependyma is lost. Additionally, IKKγ/NF-KB canonical activity
  induces SPAK activation that leads to NKCC1 upregulation and hypersecretion of CSF,
  contributing to edema and hydrocephalus, that will further alter the microenvironment.
  Neural stem cells produce mostly astrocytes under these pathological conditions.
