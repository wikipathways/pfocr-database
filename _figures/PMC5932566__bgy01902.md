caption: 'Molecular and signaling impact of MUC5AC in various malignancies. (a) GC:
  The absence of MUC5AC results in increased migratory and invasive capability of
  GC cells through increased expression of VEGF-A and MMP-7 via increased phosphorylation
  of AKT. The inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by Wortmannin (PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor)
  resulted in decreased expression of VEGF-A and MMP-7 that are implicated in decreased
  migration and invasion of GC cells by angiogenesis and degradation of extracellular
  matrix. The mechanisms by which MUC5AC mediates AKT phosphorylation are still obscure
  (depicted by dotted arrow). (b) Lung cancer: The increased migratory potential of
  lung cancer cells is mediated by interaction of secretory mucin MUC5AC with β4 integrin.
  This interaction results in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase at
  Y397 residue, resulting in increased N-cadherin expression and epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition. High MUC5AC expression in lung cancer cells is also associated with
  increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 by still unknown mechanisms (probable
  pathways depicted by dotted arrows). (c) Pancreatic cancer: In pancreatic cancer
  cells, high MUC5AC expression is associated with increased migratory potential.
  Attempts to decipher underlying mechanisms revealed increased MUC5AC-associated
  high expression levels of α3 integrin, β3 integrin, VEGF-A and MMP-3 along with
  increased phosphorylation of VEGFR1 and ERK1/2. However, the exact mechanisms by
  which above mentioned factors implicate pancreatic cancer cell migration remained
  obscure (probable pathways depicted by dotted arrows). (d) The absence of MUC5AC
  in pancreatic cancer cells results in increased expression of chemokine CXCL8 by
  unknown mechanisms. Under in vivo conditions, increased secretion of chemokine CXCL8
  from pancreatic cancer cells act as a chemoattractant for neutrophils. The tumor-associated
  neutrophils then secrete apoptotic factor TRAIL, which binds and activates DR4/DR5
  on plasma membrane of pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in increased cell death
  via extrinsic apoptotic pathway. (e) In PDAC cells, overexpressed MUC5AC may be
  basolaterally sorted to the intercellular junctions by unknown mechanisms. MUC5AC
  in intercellular junctions may interfere with the E-cadherin (E-Cadh) homotypic
  interaction, thereby increasing nuclear localization of β-catenin (β-Cat), which
  results in increased expression of cyclin-D1 (plays an important role in cell cycle
  regulation and proliferation).'
