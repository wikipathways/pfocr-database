caption: GSK3β is engaged in synaptogenesis by regulation of maturation of pre- and
  postsynaptic termini. In the axon, GSK3β regulates the stabilization and assembly
  of microtubules by interaction with and phosphorylation of several microtubule-binding
  proteins (e.g., MAP1B). Activation of GSK3β stimulates axonal elongation, whereas
  inhibition of the kinase promotes axonal branching. Constitutive activity of GSK3
  leads to the formation of multiple axons thus, the PI3K/Akt pathway activation is
  indispensable to achieve proper neuronal polarity during cell differentiation. Active
  GSK3β also inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, which results in the reduction in
  Synapsin 1 expression. Thus, inhibition of GSK3β leads to Wnt- and Synapsin 1-dependent
  axonal remodeling and synaptogenesis. In dendrites, GSK3β activates Arp2/3 protein,
  which is responsible for actin filaments branching. Thus, GSK3β participates in
  the transformation of filopodia into dendritic spines.
