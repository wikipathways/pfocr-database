caption: 'Activity of probiotics, synbiotics and postbiotics. (A). Integrative scheme
  of probiotic and synbiotic activity. They inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms
  which cause colitis and colon cancer, regulate intestinal transit, determine the
  secretion of anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules, reduce intestinal inflammation,
  produce short-chain fatty acids with anti-tumor effects and show a synergistic effect
  with anti-tumor drugs, inhibit the secretion of pro-tumor molecules (TNF alpha,
  IFN gamma, IL1beta, IL6, IL8, INOS, COX2, BCL2, BCLXL), contribute to the multiplication
  of beneficial microorganisms, which improve the metabolism of obese people and those
  with type 2 diabetes, and contribute to restoring the barrier function of the intestine
  by restoring tight junctions. (B). Activity of postbiotic products. The effects
  of relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, improving intestinal function
  and regulating the metabolism of obese and overweight people, are present at a systemic
  level, the fourth, relating to the reduction of inflammation, is produced at a local
  level and the others are observed in vitro, on different cell lines. Unless one
  postbiotic that induces activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (this
  is a signaling pathway with a dual role and which can inhibit tumor development),
  all other arrows indicate tumor suppressive activity, either through apoptosis,
  cytotoxicity or both effects. Each cell type category is marked by a specific color:
  with purple, cervical cancer cell line HeLa; with pink-brown, colorectal cancer
  cell lines HCT-116, Caco-2, HCT-8, HT-29, DLD-1 and WiDr; with magenta, gastric
  cancer cell line HGC-27; with red, breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-23;
  with blue, long carcinoma cell lines A549 and CaSki; and with orange, skin cancer
  cell line A375'
