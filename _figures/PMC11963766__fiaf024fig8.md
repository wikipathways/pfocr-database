caption: 'Comparison of a model autotrophic nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing metabolic
  pathway (top) with a revised non-autotrophic version (bottom), based on the findings
  of Beller et al. (2013) and the present study. The electron transport pathway highlighted
  in red indicates the significant knowledge gap regarding how Fe(II)-derived electrons
  are transferred to the quinone pool. The proton (H+) stoichiometry is based on Simon
  et al. (2008) and Steigmiller et al. (2008). Cytochrome-c-reductase: cytochrome
  bc1 complex'
