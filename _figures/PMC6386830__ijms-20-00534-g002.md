caption: (A) Visualization of metabolic dynamics of primary metabolism in skin tissues
  of developing berries. Representative metabolites with significantly statistical
  increases and declines more than three stages in RR are written in red and green
  letters, respectively. Metabolites with black letters indicate their dynamic changes
  were not significantly different between RR and RC. Metabolites with grey letters
  represent undetected metabolites. (B) Partial of representative metabolites. The
  relative levels of metabolites were averaged with three biological replicates. Bars
  represent standard errors. Significant differences were signaled by an asterisk
  (p < 0.05) using t-test. Each color of background represents one metabolic pathway.
