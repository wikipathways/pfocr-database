caption: Some of the regulatory interactions in the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathway
  are indicated. An activated growth factor receptor is indicated in blue. Ras and
  Rheb are indicated in dark blue ovals. IRS1 is indicated in an orange oval. Kinases
  are indicated in green ovals with the exception of GSK-3beta which is indicated
  in a black oval as it is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation. The p85 regulatory
  subunit of PI3K is indicated in a red oval. Phosphatases are indicated in black
  octagons. NF1, TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated in black squares. PIP2 and PIP3 are indicated
  in yellow ovals. Phosphatases are indicated in black octagons. mTOR interacting
  proteins which positively regulate mTOR activity are indicated in yellow ovals.
  mTOR interactiving proteins which negatively regulate mTOR activity are indicated
  in black ovals. Transcription factors activated by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation
  are indicated in yellow diamonds. The Foxo transcription factor that is inactivated
  by Akt phosphorylation is indicated by a black diamond. β-catenin is indicated in
  an orange rectangle. mRNA initiation factors and proteins associated with the ribosome
  are indicated in purple ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates the unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1)
  which results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated in a black oval.
  The mTORC1 inhibitor prevents phosphorylation of ULK1 and autophagy can occur. Red
  arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows indicate inactivating
  events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation events are depicted in red circles
  with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation events are depicted
  in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle.
