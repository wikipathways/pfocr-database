caption: P53 and the dual role of mitophagy. P53 has overlapping alterations with
  Bcl-2 family protein. P53-involved intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, target Bcl-2
  proteins and genes such as Bax, and subsequently induce mitochondrial membrane disruption
  and cytochrome c release. In autophagy regulation, nuclear P53 would induce autophagy
  by taking transcriptional effects, like transactivating BH3-only proteins in response
  to stress; however cytoplasmic P53 might conduct as a major repressor of autophagy
  by re-localizing to mitochondria, and binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
  (or activating the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins). Thus, P53 may act to balance
  autophagy (mitophagy) and apoptosis in regulating cell survival and death in response
  to stress like stroke injury
