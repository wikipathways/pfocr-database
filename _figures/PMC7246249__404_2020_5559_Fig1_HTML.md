caption: COX-2-PGE2-EPs signaling pathway. Arachidonic acid is released from the membrane
  phospholipids by PLA2 and then is metabolized by COX-1 and COX-2 into PGH2. PGH2
  is converted by specific isomerases (PGDS, PGES, PGFS and PGIS) and TXA synthase
  to multiple prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, PGI2) and the thromboxane A2 [].
  Prostaglandins act through relative receptors (EP, DP, FP, IP and TP) to mediate
  their effects []. The inhibitors of COX-2-PGE2-EPs signaling pathway include nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 selective inhibitors (COXIBs), PGES inhibitor,
  15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and EP inhibitors. NSAIDs inhibit
  the function of both COX-1 and COX-2 while COXIBs only inhibit the function of COX-2.
  PGE2 is degraded by 15-PGDH into an inactive 15-keto PGE2 after binding to EP receptors
  []. Both PGES inhibitors and EP inhibitors are novel inhibitors that have been investigating
  in these years. PLA2 phospholipases A2, COX-1 cyclooxygenase-1 COX-2 cyclooxygenase-2,
