caption: Mechanisms of action of paclitaxel and rapamycin in vascular smooth muscle
  cells (VSMC). A, Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules, inducing cytostatic G1 cell
  cycle arrest and inhibiting VSMC and migration. B, Rapamycin binds to FKBP12 and
  inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), inhibiting phosphorylation
  of S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, regulating protein, and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis.
  The inhibition of mTORC1 relieves negative feedback inhibition of IRS1, resulting
  in an activation of the PI3K/AKT2 pathway and AKT2-mediated prosurvival and transcriptional
  signaling (GATA6, FOXOs), which influences contractile and cell cycle gene expression.
  Rapamycin also induces TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), promoting DNA and
  histone modifications, opening chromatin at key contractile gene promoters, but
  repressing chromatin at synthetic genes.
