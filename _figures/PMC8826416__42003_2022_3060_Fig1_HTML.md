caption: 'a Ubiquitylation is an ATP-dependent process that depends on the cooperative
  action of three sequential enzymes: Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzyme
  (E2), and Ub E3 ligase (E3). Ub (magenta) is attached covalently to a lysine (K)
  residue of a substrate protein (dark blue) either through direct transfer from the
  E2 enzyme to the substrate, or through sequential transfer from the E2 enzyme to
  the E3 ligase and then to the substrate. b Ubiquitin can form eight different linkage
  types, using one of seven internal lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48,
  K63) or methionine at position 1 (M1). Specific Ub chains are capable to confer
  distinct functions of targeted substrates and thereby regulate different cellular
  processes. The functions illustrated here for each given type of Ub-chain are not
  restricted to the biological pathway depicted, but are rather representative examples
  chosen for simplicit.'
