caption: NDRG1 inhibits oncogenic signaling pathways by down-regulating the ErbB family
  of receptors. Located on the cell membrane, the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine
  kinases consists of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. These receptors are stimulated by
  various ligands, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF), betacellulin (BTC),
  transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and neuregulin (NRG). Unlike its other family
  members, HER2 does not possess a ligand-binding site. The phosphorylation of the
  ErbB receptors leads to the activation of numerous signaling cascades, including
  c-Src, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways. As shown, activated EGFR can stimulate Ras to
  recruit rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf), which then activates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and subsequently activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), leading to the promotion of cell migration. Interestingly, NDRG1 is
  able to halt this process by blocking MEK1 activation. Also contributing to the
  migratory capabilities of tumor cells is the c-Src pathway, which promotes Rac1
  and PAK1 expression, contributing to cell migration. NDRG1 can inhibit this pathway
  by reducing c-Src levels and inhibit its activation. Additionally, NDRG1 is able
  to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway. These latter pathways can promote STAT3, leading
  to the transcription of c-Myc and cyclin D1, both of which promote cell growth and
  proliferation. In addition to acting on these key molecules in the above-mentioned
  oncogenic pathways, NDRG1 is able to inhibit EGFR, HER2, and HER3 levels and negatively
  regulate their activation and dimerization.
