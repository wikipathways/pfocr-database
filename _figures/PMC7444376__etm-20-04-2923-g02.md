caption: GCN5 enhances the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. GCN5 is a type of
  KAT that catalyzes the acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14, and promotes the expression
  of DKK1. As a secreted protein, DKK1 can form trimers with LRP5/6 and Kremen1/2,
  inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and activate the Wnt/Ca2+pathway. The decrease
  of β-catenin and the increase of Ca2+ ultimately facilitates osteogenic differentiation
  of PDLSCs. GCN5, general control of amino acid synthesis protein 5; PDLSCs, periodontal
  ligament stem cells; KATs, lysine acetyltransferases; DKK1, dickkopf-related protein
  1; LRP5/6, LDL-receptor-related protein 5/6.
