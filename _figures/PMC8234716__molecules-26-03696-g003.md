caption: 'Overview of inflammatory signaling pathways altered by WA through direct
  molecular targets. Fibrillary Aβ, oxidative stress, DAMP, and PAMP can contribute
  to the activation of the inflammasome. Aβ fibrils trigger the activation of microglial
  cells and thus give signal 1 via NF-κB transcription of pro IL-1β and NLRP3. Intracellular
  aggregation of soluble Aβ and lysosomal rupture by phagocytosis Aβ fibrils may perform
  another signal, and oxidative stress contributes to the formation of an active NLRP3
  inflammasome. Active caspase-1, released from active NLRP3, converts IL-1β pro to
  active IL-1β, which is released into extracellular space and leads to neuroinflammation
  and finally AD. WA prevents NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation by blocking
  several steps of this pathway. Abbreviations: ROS: reactive oxygen species; NLEP3:
  NOD-like receptor protein 3; DAMP: damage-associated molecular pattern; PAMP: pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; IκB: inhibitory subunit of NF-κB; IL-18:
  interleukin-18; VCAM-1: vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; ICAM-1: intercellular
