caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathways of polysaccharide and alkaloid in Dendrobium.
  In the polysaccharide biosynthesis pathway, monosaccharides (mannose, glucose, galactose,
  arabinose, xylose, etc.) are produced through hydrolysis or hydrolysis-derivative
  reactions. These monosaccharides as basic building blocks and repeating units are
  then used to synthesize polysaccharides. In the alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, the
  upstream precursors are produced mainly through the Shikimate pathway, and MVA and
  MEP pathways. Genes in red cells indicate the cloned and functionally studied genes
  in Dendrobium. The dashed lines indicate multiple steps. Enzyme abbreviations are
  as follows: PGM, phosphoglucomutase; UGP, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; SPS, sucrose-phosphate
  synthase; Susy, sucrose synthase; DHS, 3-dexoy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase; DHQS,
