caption: Schematic diagram depicting multiple steps involving TGFβ during tumorigenesis.
  Cancer cells ultimately become refractory of TGFβ-mediated growth-inhibitory actions
  and TGFβ-induced differentiation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) becomes
  increasingly evident, contributing to tumor progression. Origin of cell, oncogenic
  events and tumor-stromal crosstalk may contribute to observed heterogeneity within
  tumor and stromal compartment. Presence of distinct tumor-suppressive, -permissive
  or -promoting CAF subpopulations with different sets of phenotypic or functional
  markers need to be identified and further characterized. This will allow prediction
  of TGFβ response and thus applicability of TGFβ-targeted treatment strategies.
