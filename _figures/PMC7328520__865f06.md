caption: 'nc886 and cancer. In normal cells, the nc886 locus is methylated in an allele-specific
  manner but nc886 RNA levels are sufficient to inactivate PKR by direct association.
  If nc886 levels decrease, PKR can become activated leading to apoptosis, and transcriptional
  changes can lead to reduced cell proliferation (; ,b; ). In some cancers, nc886
  expression is suppressed by progressive DNMT-dependent hypermethylation of its locus,
  which leads to NF-κB activation and increased cell proliferation as well as to PKR-independent
  transcriptome changes (; ,; ). Alternatively, nc886 levels can be increased either
  by binding of MYC to the demethylated allele () or by TGF-β (transforming growth
  factor β) activation leading to demethylation of the second allele (). This has
  several consequences: increased cell migration as a result of transcriptome changes
  and as a result of DICER inhibition, also leading to transcriptome changes; inhibition
  of PKR; increased cell proliferation and invasion through activation of the JAK2/STAT3
  pathway; and activation of NF-κB and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) (;
