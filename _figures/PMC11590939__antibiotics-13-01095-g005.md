caption: 'Proposed cinnamaldehyde biosynthetic pathway in microalgae. Black dotted
  lines show multiple enzymatic steps involved. Black arrows represent enzymatic,

  represent hypothesized steps. Enzyme abbreviations: CM, chorismate mutase; PPA-AT,
  prephenate aminotransferase; ADT, arogenate dehydratase; pCAT, plastidial cationic
  amino acid transporter; PDT, prephenate dehydratase; PPY-AT, phenylpyruvate aminotransferase;
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA
  reductase. Adapted from [48,49,50,51,52]). Created in ChemDraw'
