caption: Schematic depiction of NMDA receptor signaling pathway along with a GTP-binding
  protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway for autophagy/mitophagy. NMDA
  receptors may require the binding of several amino acid molecules of glycine, glutamate,
  and/or aspartate, which could modulate the receptor function. For example, glutamate
  is in the glutamate-binding site and glycine is in the glycine-binding site within
  the NMDA receptor subunit. The stimulation of NMDA receptors may allow Ca2+ entry
  into the cytoplasm of neurons, which may contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP)
  or long-term depression (LTD) as well as to a phase of excito-toxicity and/or apoptosis.
  Stimulatory effects are indicated with arrows
