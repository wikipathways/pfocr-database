caption: An overview of the role of YAP in the cytoplasm and nucleus regarding central
  nervous system disease. YAP plays a pivotal role in the whole pathologic process,
  which depends on its location and pathway. In glioma, YAP is regulated by WIP to
  induce p53 mutation in the nucleus, further resulting in tumor proliferation and
  attenuating contact cell inhibition. Of note, WIP expression is regulated via the
  P13K/Akt pathway, which is assisted by some regulatory proteins, like mTORC2 and
  PDK1. Meanwhile, NF2 suppresses the interaction between YAP and TEAD2, which triggers
  transcription target gene CYR61 and CTGF expressions and mediates miR-296-3p regulation.
  Both CYR61/CTGF and miR-296-3p can inhibit glioma invasiveness, whereas the invasiveness
  for miR-296-3p is fulfilled by decreased SATA3 and SATA5A and increased SOCS2. After
  subarachnoid hemorrhage, ErbB4 and Mst1 could respond to the BBB disruption, neuronal
  apoptosis, and white matter damage. One pathway regarding ErbB4 is upregulation
  of Nrg1β1, ErbB4, and PIK3CB; another pathway on Mst1 is the degradation of tight
  junction protein and inhibition of MMP-9 and NF-κB. Intriguingly, the isoform relationship
  between PI3K and PIK3CB connects glioma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally,
  HD is closely related to AD as a neurodegenerative disease. In HD, both decreased
  interaction between YAP and TEAD1 and increased YAP phosphorylation induce Huntington
  gene mutation. In the nucleus, the downregulation of YAP/TEAD1 stimulates CAG sequence
  repetition via excitotoxicity and disordered calcium signaling, altered mitochondrial
  dynamics, transcriptional interference, cytoskeletal disruption, and protein mishandling.
  Moreover, the decreased nuclear location of YAP inhibits BCD and TRIAD in cells,
  which stimulates neuro-necrosis. More interestingly, the mutant Huntington gene
  interacting with the YAP 14-3-3 complex aggravates the original pathologic symptom.
  In AD, YAP remarkably reduces interaction with TEAD and augments the combination
  with p73 that triggers Bax expression to aggravate neuron apoptosis, and YAP/p73
  also aggravates the mutation in HD. Moreover, the cytoplasm retention of YAP and
  TRIAD/BCD mediates intracellular Aβ aggregation further, which results in neuron
  cell necrosis different from neuron apoptosis. Incidentally, intracellular Aβ aggregation
  transports outside to accumulate extracellular Aβ aggregation during the late period
  in AD, and extracellular Aβ aggregation can also result in neuro-necrosis with non-cell-autonomous
  approaches.
