caption: Schematic illustration showing putative DA regulation after SCI of the spinal
  disynaptic pathway mediating tonic EUS activity during urine storage and the EUS
  bursting activity during voiding. In the L6/S1 spinal cord, an excitatory interneuron
  (IN; brown) receives primary bladder-EUS afferent inputs and synapses with an EUS
  motoneuron (MN; violet) to form a spinal reflex pathway that generates tonic EUS
  activity. In spinal intact rats, this circuit is modulated by the A11 DAergic diencephalospinal
  pathway that activates DR1 on INs. After SCI, the descending projection is interrupted
  and the modulation by DR1 is silenced, while the EUS tonic activity circuit is tonically
  modulated by a non-DA inhibitory IN (blue) activated by spinal DA neurons (red)
  via DR1. Blocking DR1 with SCH 23390 eliminates the tonic inhibitory modulation
  and enhances EUS tonic activity. On the other hand, the EUS MN also generates bursting
  activity during voiding. One population of excitatory INs is tonically active in
  response to stimulation by endogenous DA of DR1. Accordingly, blocking DR1 in these
  neurons with SCH 23390 suppresses bursting. Another population of local INs that
  express DR2 but are silent because they lack DAergic innervation, also facilitate
  EUS bursting when activated by quinpirole. Because these receptors are normally
  silent, selective blockage of these receptors with the DR2 antagonist remoxipride
  does not alter bursting activity whereas it can block the enhancement of bursting
  that occurs when quinpirole activates the receptors.
