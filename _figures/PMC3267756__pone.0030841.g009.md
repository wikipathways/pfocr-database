caption: C. burnetii infection increases TNF-α release. The ligation of TNFR-1 results
  in recruitment of proteins containing death domains (DD), including FADD, TRADD
  and RIP. FADD can stimulate caspase-independent cell death through mitochondrial
  ROS. Bacterial factors may release during intracellular C. burnetii replication
  and may direct target on PARP that subsequently cause translocation of pore-forming
  protein Bax/Bak to the mitochondrial, leading to the release of AIF and cytochrome
  c. PARP activation is a sensitive indicator of DNA damage that may also be induced
  by oxidative stress via TNF signaling. Overactivation of PARP transduces signaling
  (PAR polymer and PARP-bound proteins) to cause AIF to translocate from mitochondria
  to the nucleus, where response for the nuclear condensation and fragmentation. PARP-mediated
  apoptosis result in spread of intracellular bacterial to neighboring cells.
