caption: MS TLR signalling pathway. Toll-like receptor signalling pathway was identified
  through the treatment group molecules and filled with the entire set of significant
  molecules found in the study; it was personalized in PathVisio WikiPathways and
  complemented with GeneMania results. A brief explanation of the final products function
  is described. Arrows mean activation/induction; dashed arrows mean activation through
  a unknown/more complex process. The genes up-regulated in this study are represented
  in red boxes, the more red, the more up-regulation they present.
