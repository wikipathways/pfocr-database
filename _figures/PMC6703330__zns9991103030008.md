caption: Schematic representation of the activated neuronal populations—identified
  with c-Fos—in the barrel cortex following whisker stimulation and how the different
  neuronal populations contribute to the evoked CBF response. Sensory thalamocortical
  glutamatergic afferents recruit pyramidal cells, including those that contain COX-2.
  These activated cells can then affect CBF either directly by the release of COX-2-derived
  dilatory prostaglandins (PGs) or indirectly by astrocytic release of EETs following
  activation of the P450 epoxygenase pathway, likely via mGluRs. Parallel activation
  of GABA interneurons that colocalize VIP and/or ChAT would modulate pyramidal cell
  excitation, in part, by silencing (−) PV and calbindin GABA interneurons, which
  would disinhibit pyramidal cells and enhance cortical activity (large gray arrow).
  GABA interneurons could also activate the EET pathway in astrocytes through GABA-A-mediated
  increase in calcium transients. The × on PV interneurons reflects the blockade of
  their inhibitory drive on pyramidal cells exerted by the recruited VIP/ChAT interneurons,
  which results in disinhibition of pyramidal cells.
