caption: 'Role of DUBs in the PI3K/AKT, NF-κB and MYC pathways in urologic cancers.
  PI3K/AKT pathway: Transmembrane tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors such as
  EGFR and IGF-1R can activate PI3K. This leads to phosphorylation of PIP2 into PIP3.
  PDK1 and AKT proteins are then recruited to the plasma membrane, where PDK1 phosphorylates
  threonine at position 308 of AKT, activating AKT. Once activated, AKT phosphorylates
  downstream targets, such as mTOR, which serve a crucial role in cancer occurrence
  and development. Mechanistically, USP7 interacts with K13 and K289 to deubiquitinate
  PTEN. This reduces its single-stranded form, leading to nuclear rejection and PTEN
  inactivation, which promotes cancer occurrence and metastasis. Although USP13 could
  promote PI3K-AKT-induced invasion and metastasis of PCa, further exploration is
  needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. USP39 knockdown has been reported
  to markedly inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT at Serine 473, thus preventing the
  activation of the AKT signaling pathway in RCC. Overexpression of UCHL5 activates
  the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which further activates the downstream target c-MYC,
  promoting the proliferation and migration of BCa. NF-κB pathway: The cell membrane
  receptor undergoes conformational changes when TNF binds to it and transmits a signal
  to IKK kinase. This leads to the phosphorylation of the IkB protein and its dissociation
  from the trimeric complex. Subsequently, nuclear localization sequences are exposed
  on the NF-κB dimer, allowing rapid translocation into the nucleus and activation
  of target genes. The CYLD protein functions by inhibiting the ubiquitination of
  IκB and retaining the NF-κB heterodimer p65/p50 in the cytoplasm, thereby suppressing
  the proliferation, migration and invasion of BCa cells. Further research is necessary
  to ascertain how USP13 regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway and how USP17 regulates
  these genes or the site it uses to regulate this pathway. MYC pathway: Multiple
  upstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, phosphorylate
  MYC to enhance its DNA-binding ability. Phosphorylated MYC forms a dimer with Max
  and initiates downstream DNA transcription for cellular growth and proliferation.
  USP16 knockdown markedly inhibits PCa cell growth. USP43 deubiquitinase activity
  mostly deubiquitinates c-MYC at K148 and K289, stabilizing it and promoting BCa
  metastasis. Overexpression of USP43 protein in BCa hinders FBXW7 accessibility and
  raises the possibility of contact with c-MYC, which prevents c-MYC breakdown. USP,
