caption: 'Additional established and investigational therapeutic targets in chronic
  myelomonocytic leukemia. *Indicates targets that have shown promise in preclinical
  models and are in early phase clinical trials. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
  cells exhibit hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
  (GM-CSF) in hematopoietic progenitor colony-formation assays. Activation of the
  GM-CSF receptor leads to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, which leads to a specific
  STAT-5 signature in CMML, giving the rationale for JAK2 inhibitors currently in
  clinical trials. Lenzilumab is an engineered human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody,
  with high affinity for human GM-CSF, which has shown activity in preclinical models
  of CMML and in phase I clinical trials. Increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  especially in the presence of mutant RAS, contributes to the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β in particular. Canakinumab is a human anti-IL-1β
  monoclonal antibody and DFV890 is a new oral NLRP3 inhibitor, both currently in
  clinical trials. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILRB4) negatively regulates
  immune cell activation via T-cell suppression and has been shown to have increased
  expression in both CMML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a monocytic component.
  IO-202 is an antagonist antibody targeting LILRB4 in a phase I clinical trial in
  AML and CMML. CD123 is the a-subunit of IL-3 receptor. Its expression on islands
  of clonal plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the bone marrow of CMML patients correlates
  with an increased risk of AML transformation. CD123 is also found on myeloid progenitors
  and monocytes, and is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of myeloid
  cells. Tagraxofusp is a recombinant cytotoxin which consists of human IL3 fused
  to a truncated diphtheria toxin currently approved for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic
  cell neoplasm and in clinical trials for CMML. Aberrant splicing is a common feature
  in CMML. H3B-8800 and CTX-712 are modulators of the spliceosome, believed to induce
  synthetic lethality in cells that already have a spliceosome dysfunction. These
  agents are currently in clinical trials in CMML and other myeloid malignancies.
  Epigenetic dysregulation plays an important role in CMML and other hematologic malignancies.
  EP31670 is a dual BRD4 and CBP/p300 inhibitor that is currently in early phase clinical
  trials. Similarly, DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors,
  such as panobinostat, attempt to re-establish impaired epigenetic regulation. Ascorbic
  acid enhances the activity of TET2 also aiming to improve epigenetic deregulation,
  and is currently in clinical trials. Although targetable, IDH1/2 and FLT3 are very
  infrequently mutated in CMML, and inhibitors of these proteins are rarely prescribed
  in CMML. pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cells; HDAC: histone deacetylase; DNMT: DNA-methyltransferase;
