caption: Nicotine enhances CIC properties by activating the CHRNA7/JAK2/STAT3/SOX2
  signaling pathway, while dextromethorphan together with metformin counteract nicotine-induced
  CIC properties by repressing CHRNA7/JAK2/STAT3/SOX2 signaling pathway. Mechanistically,
  dextromethorphan non-competitively inhibits nicotine-CHRNA7 interaction while metformin
  downregulates CHRNA7 by enhancing its promoter hypomethylation, and thereby they
  synergistically inactivating the JAK2/STAT3/SOX2 signaling pathway.
