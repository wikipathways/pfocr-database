caption: (A) Phoenix Rising pathway of accelerated tumor repopulation. The cascade
  is initiated by cleavage and activation of caspase 3, which also promotes programed
  cell death by apoptosis. Activated caspase 3 cleaves and activates phospholipase
  2 that hydrolyzes fatty acid phospholipid bonds, releasing arachidonic acid and
  lysophospholipids. Arachidonic acid is converted to PGH2 by COX1 and COX2 peroxidases
  in the presence of oxygen; this step can be blocked by COX1–COX2 inhibitor indomethacin
  or hypoxia. Prostaglandin synthases generate the family of prostanoids, including
  PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2. PGE2 (and possibly other PGs) excreted from dying cells promote
  growth of surviving cells, accelerating tumor repopulation. (B) The DDR regulates
  cell fate after radiation damage. Proteins involved in DNA repair and damage checkpoint
  pathways crosstalk with programed cell death pathways to determine a variety of
  short- and long-term cell fates. Phoenix Rising and the DDR are linked through apoptosis
  and possibly other processes.
