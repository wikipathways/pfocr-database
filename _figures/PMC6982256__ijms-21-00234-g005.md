caption: The 2-DG-induced autophagy pathway (Unc51 like autophagy activating kinase
  1 (ULK1/2)—UNC-51-like kinase ½ (serine/threonine kinase homologous to yeast Atg1);
  REDD1—regulated in development and DNA damage response 1; GDPH—glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; Rheb—Ras homolog enriched in brain; LKB1—liver kinase B1). The main
  consequence of glycolysis inhibition is ATP deficiency, which disrupts ATP/AMP ratio.
  As a result, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. Active AMPK directly
  phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis (TSC1) proteins in mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) kinase complex leading to autophagy induction. On the other hand, 2-DG-mediated
  glucose deprivation stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria,
  also leading to AMPK activation and autophagy stimulation.
