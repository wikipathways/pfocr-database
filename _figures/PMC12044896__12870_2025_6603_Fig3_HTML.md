caption: Map of gene expression differences of MAPK signaling pathway and plant hormone
  signal transduction in the comparison group CK vs. T2. (A) MAPK signaling pathway
  of plant. (B) plant hormone signal transduction pathway. The red and green indicate
  up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. The blue indicate both up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes. These images were from KEGG database and obtained the
