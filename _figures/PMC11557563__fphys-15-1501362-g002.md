caption: 'Overview of glycolysis and its ancillary pathways in WB muscle. Schematic
  of enzymatic and intermediate changes in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway,
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and serine biosynthesis pathway observed in WB
  muscle. Red text indicates a decrease in gene expression and/or protein abundance
  of the enzyme or intermediate. Green text indicates an increase in gene expression
  and/or protein abundance of the enzyme or intermediate. Black text was not evaluated
  or no changes were reported. Abbreviations: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  6PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; GFAT, glutamine
  fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; LDHα,
  lactate dehydrogenase alpha; LDHβ lactate dehydrogenase beta. Created in BioRender'
