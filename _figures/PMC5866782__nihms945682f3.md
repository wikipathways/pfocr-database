caption: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) localized to the tumor microenvironment produce
  16:4(n-3) PUFA in response to platinum-based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin
  via an intracellular signaling mechanism that is dependent on Ca+2, PLA2, thromboxane
  synthase (TXAS), and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) (). 16:4(n-3) that is released by MSC
  agonizes FFA4 on splenic macrophages (F4/80+/CD11blow in mice, presumably CD163+
  in humans) to activate cytosolic PLA2 via an unresolved pathway that is likely Gαq/11/Ca+2-mediated.
  FFA4-induced activation of cPLA2 forms the lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(24:1), which
  directly alters the ability of platinum-based chemotherapeutics to mediate DNA damage
  responses in cancer cells, leading to chemoresistance to the agents (–).
