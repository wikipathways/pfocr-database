caption: Most common pathways for the degradation of fatty acid CoA esters by β-oxidation
  enzymes in the different organisms. In the first reaction of the β-oxidation cycle,
  acyl-CoA esters are desaturated to Δ2-trans enoyl-CoA esters by acyl CoA oxidases
  or acyl CoA dehydrogenases. Oxidases are located in microbodies of higher plants
  and animal tissue. Dehydrogenases are found in bacteria, animal mitochondria, and
  microbodies of some fungi and in algae. For the following reaction of the β-oxidation
  cycle, different pathways are used. Pathway I, The Δ2-trans enoyl-CoA esters are
  metabolized by monofunctional crotonases (also named ECH-1), l-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases,
  and thiolases. This pathway is located in bacteria and animal mitochondria. Pathway
  II, Crotonase, and l-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase are domains of a common polypeptide
  that also metabolizes Δ2-cis-enoyl-CoA esters occurring in unsaturated fatty acids.
  These Δ2-cis-enoyl-CoA esters are also suitable substrates for the crotonase, but
  the resulting product is d-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is transformed to the l-form by
  an epimerase function of the polypeptide. This MFP is specifically found in microbodies
  of higher plants and animals. Pathway III, The polypeptide that carries functions
  for crotonase, l-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and epimerase is combined with a
  second polypeptide that displays thiolase activity. This type of MFP is found in
  bacteria and animal mitochondria. Pathway IV, The Δ2-trans enoyl-CoA esters are
  metabolized by a d-specific 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (d-ECH; ECH-2) that forms d-specific
  products and a d-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase that is specific to d-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  esters as substrates. Both enzyme functions are located at a common polypeptide.
  This bifunctional protein is located in microbodies of fungi and in rat liver tissue.
