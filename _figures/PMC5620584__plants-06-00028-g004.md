caption: The polyketide pathway synthesizing β-diketones and alkan-2-ols. (Left, middle)
  KC/AS, either KCS, one of the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthases constructing carbon chains
  of the ubiquitous wax aliphatics in the endoplasmic reticulum or KAS, the β-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase participating in fatty acid synthesis in plastids. CER-Q, a lipase/carboxyl
  transferase/thioesterase which is envisaged to hydrolyze the 3-oxo substrate (top,
  center) from ACP, CoA or lipid (). The 3-oxo substrate is then decarboxylated to
  form methylketones that are converted to alkan-2-ols (top right). Neither methylketones
  nor free alkan-2-ols occur in the wax, instead the latter are found as the alcohol
  moiety of esters (not shown). DKS/CER-C is the diketone synthase carrying out two
  extensions in barley giving a tetraketide intermediate (middle) presumably after
  activation of the 3-oxo substrate by CoA (★). KCR, β-ketoacyl-CoA reductase; HCD;
  hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, ECR; enoyl-CoA reductase; “KCS”, condensing enzyme
  carrying out 5 or 6 extensions (5X, 6X) of the DKS synthesized tetraketides; C,
  carbon released by unknown mechanism. Numbering in direction of synthesis, except
  in boxes which give the IUPAC name requiring numbering in opposite direction of
  synthesis, of the three in vivo synthesized β-diketones []. Weight % of the β-diketones
  is given in . The homologs of CER-Q and DKS in wheat are named Diketone Metabolism-Hydrolase
  and Diketone Metabolism-PKS, DMH and DMP, respectively [].
