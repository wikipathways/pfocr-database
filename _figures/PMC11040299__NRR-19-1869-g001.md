caption: 'TNFR1-mediated neuronal necroptosis is associated with the neuroinflammatory
  microenvironment in Alzheimer''s disease (AD).(A) Intracellular tau tangles, extracellular
  amyloid plaques, increased levels of cytokines including TNF, as well as glial activation,
  T-cell activation, and neuronal death are neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Cellular
  phenotypes with high TNFR1 and low TNFR2 are associated with neurodegenerative pathology
  and those with low TNFR1 and high TNFR2 may be neuroprotective. (B) Interaction
  between TNFR1 signaling axis and autolysosomal pathway under neuroinflammatory condition.
  Pathogenic triad of lysosomal acidification defect, autophagic impairment, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction contributes to TNFR1-induced neuronal necroptosis. Modulation of the
  autolysosomal network, including alteration of lysosomal acidification, determines
  the cell fate to adopt the necroptosis or survival pathway. Created with BioRender.com.
