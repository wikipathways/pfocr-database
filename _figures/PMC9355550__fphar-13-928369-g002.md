caption: Anti-tumor mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade combining with other treatment
  regimens. (A) The primary mechanism of chemotherapy and irradiation in combination
  with ICB is to induced ICD, and thereby to promote the release of tumor antigen.
  Under the promotion of ICD, HMGB I translocated to improve antigen presentation
  and the following process of T cell activation. (B) The Fc structure of the monoclonal
  antibody of HER2 mediates the ADCC by binding with Fc receptor on the NK cells and
  promote the CD8-positive T cells infiltration. (C) Anti-angiogenic therapy acts
  on reshaping the disorder blood vessel and attenuating the hypoxic and acid TME.
  (D) PARPi inhibits the DNA damage repair by impeding the binding of PAPR on the
  broken DNA, and then induces the activation of IFN pathway and effector cells infiltration.
  (E) Hypomethylating agent prompts antigen presentation by upregulating the expression
  of MHC class I. (F) Androgen receptor antagonist inhibits the IL-10 release and
  Treg infiltrartion, and attracts effector T cells further.
