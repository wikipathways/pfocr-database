caption: 'Mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance: The role of BCAR1 and BCAR3 in breast
  cancer cell signaling. This diagram delineates the complex interplay between estrogen-mediated
  signaling and the induction of anti-estrogen resistance by BCAR1 and BCAR3 pathways
  in breast cancer. Under normal circumstances, estrogen binds to the estrogen receptor
  alpha (ERα), facilitating receptor dimerization and subsequent interaction with
  coactivators to initiate transcription of genes that drive cell proliferation. Tamoxifen
  interferes with this pathway by inhibiting ERα, thereby hindering the gene transcription
  necessary for cell proliferation. Despite the presence of tamoxifen, the proteins
  BCAR1 and BCAR3 circumvent this blockade by activating alternative signaling cascades
  involving c-Src, AKT, and ERK1/2, as well as modulating cyclin D levels. This results
  in the phosphorylation of ERα, which can then proceed to bind estrogen response
  elements (EREs) and promote gene transcription that leads to cell proliferation.
  The schematic underscores the resilience of breast cancer cells in the face of anti-estrogen
  therapies and highlights the critical roles of BCAR3 in fostering this resistance.
