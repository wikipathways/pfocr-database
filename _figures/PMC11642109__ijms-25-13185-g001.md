caption: Schematic illustration showing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system
  (SNS) and the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) on cancer development. The binding
  of epinephrine and norepinephrine to the β-adrenergic receptor leads to the activation
  of adenylyl cyclase and the conversion of ATP into cAMP, which activates two major
  pathways. In the first pathway, the PKA pathway phosphorylates multiple target proteins,
  including transcription factors of the CREB/ATF and GATA families and β-adrenergic
  receptor kinase (BARK). The phosphorylation of BARK leads to the recruitment of
  β-arrestin, which activates Src kinase, resulting in the activation of transcription
  factors such as STAT3. In the second pathway, the cAMP activation of the exchange
  protein activated by adenylyl cyclase (EPAC) leads to the Rap1A-mediated stimulation
  of the B-Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, affecting gene
  transcription. Overall, β-adrenergic signaling results in the upregulation of genes
  involved in inflammation and the downregulation of genes involved in anti-tumor
  immune responses. The RAS pathway interacts with two main downstream routes, the
  Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, both promoting cellular proliferation.
  Angiotensin II binds to the AT1 receptor (AT1R), initiating processes that promote
  cancer development. In contrast, the angiotensin II/AT2 receptor (AT2R) and angiotensin
  1-7/Mas receptor (MasR) pathways support anti-cancer activity by inhibiting cell
  proliferation
