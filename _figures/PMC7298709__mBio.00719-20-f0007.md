caption: Model of the Sre1-mediated and Rim-mediated distinct responses to physiological
  pH. (A) The activating sensor for the sterol homeostasis pathway is unknown and
  could be linked to alkaline pH-induced reductions in ergosterol/membrane alterations
  or bioavailable iron. In response to alkaline pH, the Sre1 transcription factor
  is cleaved, activated, and localized to the nucleus to aid in the transcription
  of many genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and membrane homeostasis. This
  cleavage and activation are dependent on both the conserved transmembrane protein
  Scp1 and the basidiomycete-specific protease Stp1. (B) The Rim alkaline response
  pathway is signaled through the transmembrane pH sensor Rra1 and its interaction
  with the plasma membrane. At elevated pH levels, Rra1 is endocytosed, allowing it
  to interact with the downstream components of the pathway and propagate the signal
  to the endosomal membrane complex (ESCRT components, Rim23, and Rim20) and activate
  the Rim13 protease. This protease cleaves the Rim101 transcription factor, allowing
  it to translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of genes involved in
  cell wall and surface remodeling.
