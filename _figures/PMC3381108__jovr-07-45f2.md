caption: Unfolded protein response (UPR). The ER stress response is mediated by three
  receptors located in the ER membrane. The IRE1 pathway is activated by the release
  of BiP from IRE1 which is followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation of its
  cytoplasmic domain. The activated IRE1 receptor triggers its intrinsic RNase activity,
  which splices out a 26-nucleotide intron from XBP1 mRNA and creates a translational
  frameshift leading to production of an active transcription factor, XBP1. XBP1 activates
  the transcription of ERAD-related proteins (red-dotted area). Chronic activation
  of IRE1 leads to recruitment of TRAF2 followed by activation of ASK1, p38 and JNK.
  Activated JNK translocates to the mitochondrial membrane and promotes phosphorylation
  of Bim, which is associated with Bax-dependent release of cytochrome c and activation
  of the caspase cascade. The PERK pathway is activated by the release of BiP generating
  a dimerized-phosphorylated PERK enzyme which reduces the activity of the eIF2α by
  phosphorylation of its α-subunit. Although the phosphorylation of eIF2α generally
  attenuates protein synthesis/translation, it promotes the translation of ATF4 upon
  ER stress. ATF4 activates the transcription of chaperones, ERAD machinery and ER-stress-induced
  pro-apoptotic factors, such as CHOP and GADD34 and ATF3 (green-dotted area). In
  the ATF6 pathway, the release of BiP from the ATF6 receptor frees the receptor to
  be transported to the Golgi. Once in the Golgi, the cytosolic domain is cleaved
  by S1P and S2P, releasing a bZIP transcription factor, ATF6. ATF6 translocates to
  the nucleus where it activates the transcription of BiP, XBP1, CHOP and P58IPK (blue-dotted
  area).
