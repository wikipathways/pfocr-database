caption: 'Potential therapeutic strategies modulating Th17/IL-17A response in damaged
  peritoneum: briefly, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists
  inhibit Th17 response via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  blockade and downregulation of retinoid related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) and IL-6
  but promote Treg response by the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
  mTOR inhibition, via the hypoxia-induced factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, downregulates
  Th17 response. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation and inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2
  axis also target Th17 differentiation by decreased STAT3 activation and RORγt expression.
  Ala-Gln supplemented in PDF reduces IL-17A and IL-6 production. Other common drugs
  used in PD patients such as renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, including angiotensin
  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and
  statins may also modulate Th17 response. All these drugs also present other beneficial
  effects in the damaged peritoneum. Green arrows: activation, red arrows: inhibition.'
