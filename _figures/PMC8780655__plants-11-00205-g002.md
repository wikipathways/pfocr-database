caption: Transcriptional regulators under hypoxia. Under O2 limitation, the mitochondrial
  function is impaired leading to lower ATP production. An energy crisis induces dissociation
  of the ACBP1-RAP2.12 complex at the plasma membrane. Released RAP2.12 translocates
  to the nucleus and free RAP2.12 protein is stabilized upon a dysfunctional N-degron
  pathway, which uses O2 as a co-substrate. The post-translational modification of
  RAP2.12 by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) and calcineurin-b-like interacting
  kinases (CIPKs) may regulate transcription factor (TF) function. In the nucleus,
  RAP2.12 activates hypoxia-responsive genes (HRG) and binds to the hypoxia-responsive
  promoter element (HRPE, shown as “H”) within target promoters. Endoplasmic reticulum-(ER-)localized
  ANAC017 is mobilized upon a mitochondrial dysfunction signal under hypoxia, potentially
  by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nuclear ANAC017 is regulated in its function via
  physical interaction with radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1) and binds to target
  gene promoters harboring the mitochondrial dysfunction motif (MDM, shown as “M”).
  Chloroplast signals under hypoxia are suggested to be transmitted to the nucleus
  by phosphate starvation response 1 (PHR1) and lead to the activation of galactolipid
  genes. Chlp, chloroplast; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Mito, mitochondrion; Nuc, nucleus.
