caption: H2S generation via the transsulfuration pathway. The transsulfuration pathway
  plays a central role in sulfur metabolism and redox regulation in cells. It involves
  the transfer of sulfur from homocysteine to cysteine through an intermediate (cystathionine)
  and is the only way in which mammals generate cysteine endogenously. Methionine
  is converted into homocysteine in a reversible 2-step process involving the enzymatic
  activity of SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-AdoCys) (not pictured). Homocysteine
  is then converted to cystathionine through CBS-mediated condensation of homocysteine
  and serine or cysteine, which can generate H2O or H2S, respectively. Cystathionine
  is then acted upon by CSE to generate cysteine and α-ketobutyrate (not pictured).
  Cysteine can be further acted upon by CBS, CSE, or 3-MST/cysteine aminotransferase
  (CAT) to generate H2S, as well as other byproducts, such as GSH, pyruvate, and lanthionine.
  Notably, CSE is responsible for the physiologic clearance of homocysteine and can
  act on it alone to generate H2S.
