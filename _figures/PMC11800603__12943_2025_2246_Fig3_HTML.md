  A Inhibit of ADAM10/NLGN3 can suppress glioma growth by targeting its downstream
  PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. B Neurosecretion-derived BDNF promotes tumor metastasis
  by binding to the TrkB receptor. Inhibition of BDNF-TrkB binding can suppress tumor
  metastasis. C Blocking the NGF-mediated neuro-tumor positive feedback loop. D Inhibiting
  sympathetic nerve signaling can mitigate the immunosuppressive microenvironment
  of the tumor. E The combination of β-blockers and immunosuppressants can augment
  the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. NLGN3 = Neuroligin-3. BDNF = brain
