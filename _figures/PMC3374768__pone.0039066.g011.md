caption: Diabetes and/or hyperglycemia via attenuation of the EGFR/erbB2 signaling
  and through subsequent modulation of downstream effectors such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK
  or AKT/FOXO can lead to cardiac dysfunction. The effects of diabetes on EGFR/erbB2
  pathway are exacerbated by blockade of this pathway by AG1478 or AG825 which leads
  to worsening cardiac recovery from I/R. However, the inhibitory effects of diabetes
  on EGFR/ErbB2 pathway may be opposed by administering EGF that also leads to improved
  cardiac function. The Angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT1 receptor pathway can also activate
  EGFR/erbB2 pathway that can be blocked by Losartan. Co-administration of EGF with
  Losartan attenuates losartan-mediated EGFR blockade and improves cardiac function
  in diabetes beyond that attained by either drug alone.
