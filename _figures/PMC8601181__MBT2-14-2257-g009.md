caption: Schematic representation of biosynthetic mechanisms of RiPPs and NRPs.A.
  The biosynthesis of RiPPs undergoes the ribosome and post‐translational modification
  machinery. The precursor peptide usually consists of an N‐terminal leader peptide
  (for recognition by PTM enzymes and for export) and a core peptide (harbouring various
  PTM sites). In some cases, the C‐terminal follower peptide serves as a leader peptide
  or transcriptional factor. Following the completion of PTMs, the leader peptide
  and follower peptide are removed by proteolysis. Examples of different small peptides
  belong to the RiPPs family.B. Model of an NRPS assembly line showing the typical
  linear. (A)‐adenylation domain, (T)‐thiolation domain, (C)‐condensation domains,
  (TE)‐thioesterase domain. The module of NRPS may contain additional domains including
  epimerization (E), N‐methylation (M) and cyclization (Cy) domains. Examples of different
  small peptides produced by NRPS assembly lines.
