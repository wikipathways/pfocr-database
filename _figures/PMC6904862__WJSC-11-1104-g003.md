caption: 'Biomechanical stress stimulates the mechanosensitive molecules on the EPC
  surface, and then induces cytoskeleton rearrangement and activates series of downstream
  signaling pathway. The following cascades lead to change of gene expression, ultimately
  influencing the cell fundamental activities including cell proliferation, differentiation,
  recruitment, and motivation, depending upon the need of vessel repair. EPCs: Endothelial
  progenitor cells; ECs: Endothelial cells; SMCs: Smooth muscle cells. The black arrow
  points out the direction of stress.'
