caption: 'Outside-in: Activated TGF-β1 (freed from LAP) binds to the TGF-βR complex
  stimulating intracellular signaling that promotes α-SMA production. In parallel,
  ECM-to-cell mechanical transduction through the integrin/focal adhesion (FA) pathway
  activates RhoA, leading to assembly of α-SMA stress fibers.Inside-out: TGF-β1-activated
  EDA-FN splicing increases the EDA-FN protein in the ECM; cell contraction executed
  by α-SMA stress fibers alters the LAP (gray) conformation via the integrin/LAP interaction
  releasing TGF-β1 (blue) from LAP.Positive feedback loops: 1. TGF-β1 stimulates the
  production of EDA-FN which in turn facilitates the ECM incorporation and activation
  of TGF-β1 via the LTBP-1/EDA-FN/integrin interaction network. 2. ECM-integrin mechano-transduction
  activates RhoA which enhances the assembly of α-SMA stress fibers that execute cell
  contraction and integrin mechano-transduction, further augmenting RhoA activation.
  3. TGF-β1-stimulated stress fiber production ultimately enhances TGF-β1 release
  from the ECM via mechano-activation through the integrin/LAP interaction. 4. The
  assembly of G-actin (monomer α-SMA) into F-actin (stress fiber) allows for the escape
  of MRTF from G-actin sequestration in the cytosol and its nuclear translocation
  and SRF activation, which in turn propagates α-SMA and stress fiber production.Notes:1.
  Latent TGF-β forms SLC with the LAP “straight jacket”, where it is trapped; SLC
  and LTBP forms LLC.2. Green arrows indicate TGF-βR and integrin/FA mutual modulations.3.
  Activated RhoA promotes MRTF nuclear translocation by enhancing F-actin assembly
  while reducing G-actin in the cytosol.'
