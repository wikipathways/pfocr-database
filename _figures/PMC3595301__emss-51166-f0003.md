caption: 'Crosstalk between Wnt and local inflammatory signaling pathways for the
  control of SVZ niche homeostasis. During the early degeneration phase of MPTP toxicity,
  hyperactivated microglia contribute to the impairment of SVZ neurogenesis at different
  levels. By increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress and in synergy with MPTP/MPP+
  direct toxicity, microglial-derived mediators (PHOX-derived ROS and iNOS-derived
  NO and peroxynitrite) may act as a molecular switch for cell signaling pathways
  critically involved in the physiological control of NPC homeostasis, with harmful
  consequences for NPC physiology, at least in part through GSK-3β activation, followed
  by phosphorylation and consequent degradation of β-catenin [,]. By contrast, pharmacological
  mitigation of inflammation and oxidative stress with Apo, L-Nil, or HCT1026 upregulate
  β-catenin and successfully rescue NPC proliferation and neuroblast formation, a
  process associated with striatal DAergic neuroprotection, with further positive
  modulation of SVZ proliferation via D2-R-activated mechanisms []. The mutual role
  of astrocyte–microglial interactions in the plasticity of SVZ response to MPTP is
  exemplified by the astrocyte’s ability to overcome microglial inhibitory effects,
  through, besides others, Wnt1-mediated activation Wnt/β-catenin signaling []. Different
  upstream and downstream signaling cascades may converge in finely tuning β-catenin
  transcriptional activity. For example, NO can inhibit EGF-R and the phosphoinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT survival pathway, and GSK-3β is a downstream target of Akt;
  RNS-induced nitration regulates the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase; and a variety of
  molecules including growth factors and neurotransmitter, including DA via D2 receptor
  can signal through (PI3K)/AKT/GSK-3β and Wnt signaling activation, thus, crosstalk
  among Wnt/β-catenin and prominent intracellular pathways may be envisioned to fine
  tune the SVZ neurogenic potential/plasticity observed herein []. Crosstalk between
  SVZ astrocytes (blue), transit-amplifying cells (red), neuroblasts (orange), ependymal
  (yellow) cells, microglia (violet), and lymphocytes via Wnt in SVZ niche are schematically
  illustrated. Abbreviations: Apo, apocynin, a ROS antagonist; DA, dopamine; D2-R,
  dopaminergic receptor subtype 2; HCT1026, [2-fluoro-α-methyl(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-acetic-4-(nitrooxy)butyl
  ester], a mixed cyclooxygenase (COX1/COX2) inhibitor NO-donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
  drug (NSAID) endowed with additional anti-inflammatory activity and reduced side
  effects; L-Nil, L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine, a specific inhibitor of inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS); MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; MPTP, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine;
