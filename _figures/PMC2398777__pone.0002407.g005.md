caption: CL6 embryonic cells start to differentiate into mesodermal cells through
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway at the early stage (days 1–3), and mesodermal CL6
  cells differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes by BMP pathway at the late stage
  (days 4–14). Grem1 accelerates DMSO-induced cardiomyogenesis through inhibition
  of the BMP-signaling pathway.
