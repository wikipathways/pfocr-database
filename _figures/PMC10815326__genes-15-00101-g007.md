caption: 'Different patterns of inflammatory gene activation in cerebral cortex and
  cerebellum of Npc1−/− mice. The enrichment score in the central circle of the figure
  represents arbitrary-color-coded relative changes at multiple levels of evaluation:
  cytokines and chemokines; gene sets; biological pathways, and phenotype severity
  in cerebral cortex (Cx) and cerebellum (Cb). All comparisons are described clockwise
  from the top. Npc1−/− Cortex vs. Npc1−/− cerebellum. The most severe disease phenotype
  is observed in the cerebellum of Npc1−/− mice (red-colored Cb), and it correlates
  with the highest enrichment of NF-kB, TLR4, IFN-g and IFN-a gene sets and the highest
  upregulation of anti-viral response, microglial activation, anti-microbial response,
  and T-lymphocyte activation/chemotaxis, compared to the cerebral cortex. The enrichment
  of the Detoxification/Response to ROS gene sets show the opposite pattern, being
  higher in Cx than in Cb. Thus, it is plausible that a combination of a weaker oxidative
  stress response and stronger inflammation activation in the cerebellum could explain,
  at least in part, the earlier and more severe onset and progression of pathogenesis
  in this area of the brain. Npc1−/− cerebellum vs wildtype cerebellum. All parameters
  for wildtype cerebellum are shown in blue to denote baseline levels. As highlighted
  above, the combination of a relatively low enrichment in Detoxification/Response
  to ROS pathways and high levels of inflammatory parameters contribute to an enhanced
  vulnerability in the cerebellum. Wildtype cerebral cortex vs wildtype cerebellum.
  All parameters are depicted in blue color to denote base values in both Cb and Cx
  in the wildtype brain. Npc1−/− cerebral cortex vs wildtype cerebral cortex. While
  there is a relative increase of inflammatory markers (shown in orange), the enrichment
  patterns of Detoxification/Response to ROS gene sets suggest a mechanism for a slower
  inflammatory activation and pathogenic onset and progression in the cerebral cortex
  (Cx depicted in orange)'
