caption: Vitiligo pathogenesis and currently available treatments for vitiligo. (A)
  Pathologies of vitiligo. In vitiligo, melanocytes are more susceptible to oxidative
  stress, which in turn targets antigens to nearby dendritic cells and induces their
  maturation into efficient antigen-presenting cells. Upon endogenous or exogenous
  stress, NK cells produce IFN-γ that induces the production of chemokines. Binding
  of IFN-γ to its receptor activates the JAK/STAT pathway and leads to T-cell recruitment
  and function, which induces melanocyte apoptosis. Established vitiligo is maintained
  by TRM cells, which remain long-lived in the skin through IL-15–dependent signaling.
  (B) Immunomodulated therapeutic intervention in vitiligo. Immunomodulatory therapies
  are currently available treatments for vitiligo, including the increase of Treg
  cells to neutralize effector CD8+ T-cell function, small molecule–targeted drugs
  of JAK inhibitors to block IFN-γ–CXCR3–CXCL9/10 signaling axis, and anti-CD122 antibody
  (IL-15 receptor subunit) to decrease IFN-γ production and deplete autoreactive CD8+
  TRM cells. DC, dendritic cells; NK, natural killer cells; TRM, skin-resident memory

    (A) Pathologies of vitiligo. In vitiligo, melanocytes are more susceptible to

    Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor activates the JAK/STAT pathway and leads to T-cell
