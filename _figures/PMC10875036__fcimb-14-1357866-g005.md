caption: IAV NS1 and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 antagonism of innate immune responses. The induction
  of innate immune response is initiated by triggering TLRs and RLRs pathways after
  IAV (red) or SARS-CoV-2 (purple) entrance to susceptible cells. The recognition
  of PAMPs by PRRs leads to the activation of a signal transduction cascade that involves
  several modulators, including, among others, TRIF, MyD88, PACT, TRIM25, and Riplet,
  which leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3/7. Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated
  IRF3/7 induces the transcription of IFN. Through the Janus kinase (JAK)1 and TYK2
  signaling pathway, binding of IFN to the IFNR1/2 receptors leads to the phosphorylation
  of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 which together with IRF9 translocate to
  the nucleus resulting in the expression of hundreds of ISGs with antiviral activity.
  Both IAV NS1 (red) and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 (purple) can interact with various cellular
  host factors to inhibit activation of IRF3/7, prevent the maturation and nuclear
  exportation of cellular mRNA, blocking the loading of cellular mRNA to the ribosomes
  (Nsp1), or counteracting the antiviral response of different ISGs. This figure was
