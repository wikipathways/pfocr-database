caption: MBOAT7 downregulation and LPI accumulation leads to steatohepatitis.MBOAT7
  localises to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyses the transfer of AA to
  LPI resulting in AA-PI, that is incorporated into cell membranes. In carriers of
  the rs641738 risk variant or during hyperinsulinemia, MBOAT7 is downregulated, resulting
  in a reduction of AA-PI and accumulation of LPI that is converted into TAG by the
  alternative synthesis pathway through the intermediate DAG, a process promoted by
  SREBP1c. Deficiency of AA-PI upregulates CDS, enhancing LPI synthesis. In HSCs,
  LPI binds to GPR55 triggering inflammatory and profibrotic gene expression and ECM
  deposition. AA, arachidonic acid; AA-PI, AA-containing PI; CDS, CDP-diacylglycerol-synthase;
