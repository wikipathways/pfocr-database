caption: Vasoconstriction and vasodilation pathways and therapies for pulmonary hypertension
  (PH). Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric oxide (NO) increases
  cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and leads to vasodilation and inhibition
  of cellular proliferation in smooth muscle cells (SMC) through the activation of
  sGC by NO. Inhaled NO, oral nitrite and nitrate, oral l-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil/tadalafil) modulate
  PH through the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Prostacyclins, produced from arachidonic acid
  by cyclooxygenase (COX) in endothelial cells, target the prostanoid receptor (IP)
  on smooth muscle cells leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which forms
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). cAMP promotes
  vasodilation and inhibits cellular proliferation in SMC. Epoprostenol is a prostanoid
  derivative and selexipag is a new IP receptor agonist that can treat PH through
  the prostacyclin pathway. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) promotes vasoconstriction and vascular
  remodeling through binding to ET-A and -B receptors of the SMC. Ambrisentan binds
  to ET-A and bosentan binds to both ET-A and B. Both ET-1 blockers have been used
  to treat PH in the endothelin pathway.
