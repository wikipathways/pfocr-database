caption: The production of IL-1β and its transduction signaling pathway. Initially,
  IL-1β is synthesized as proIL-1β. Next, it is cleaved by caspase-1 into mIL-1β (active
  form) via the NLRP3 inflammasome, composed of NLRP3 sensor, ASC protein, and Procaspase-1.
  The mIL-1β can bind to IL-1RI, and IL-1RI then recruits IL-1RAcP as its co-receptor.
  The established mIL-1β/IL-1RI/IL-1RAcP complexes interact with adapter molecules,
  such as MyD88, IRAK4, IRAK1, and TRAF6. Subsequently, the activated TRAF6 triggers
  the transcription of target genes by activating the TAK1/TAB2/NF-κB, MAPK/c-JNK/AP-1,
  MAPK/ERK/NF-κB, and MAPK/p38 pathways. ASC, adaptor protein apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; DAMP, damage-associated molecular
  pattern; ERK, extracellular regulated protein kinases; GSDMD, Gasdermin D; IL-1RAcP,
  interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein; IL-1RI, IL-1 receptor type I; IRAK4, IL-1R-associated
  kinase 4; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor thermal protein
  domain associated protein 3; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; TIR, toll-like/IL-1
  receptor; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6; TAK1, transforming growth factor-beta-activated
  kinase 1; TAB2; TAK1-binding protein 2, PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern;
  TXNIP; thioredoxin interacting protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
