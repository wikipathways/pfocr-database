caption: 'Alterations of the PI3K/Akt-Cyclin D1 pathway in cell cycle progression
  from G1 to S phase in 2-cell embryos. Concurrent treatment with nicotine and mixed/pure
  δ-TCT (Grp.3 & Grp.4) resulted in the upregulation of pik3cb and PTEN. These increments
  attenuate the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 substance by PTEN. A low abundance of PIP3
  will reduce the rate of PDK1 activation. Although supplemented with δ-TCT, the detection
  of DNA damage following nicotine treatment increased the expression of the checkpoint
  gene, atm. High level of atm will phosphorylate (activate) its target gene, trp53.
  Activated p53 binds and activates CDKIs (p21 and p27). Both CDKIs bind and suppress
  the overexpression of cyclin E1/CDK2 complex, which will cause disruption in the
  G1/S transition. This will eventually mitigate the entire embryonic cell proliferation.
