caption: Pathway of apoptosis. Extrinsic cell death pathway is mediated by a TNF receptor
  superfamily, called the death receptors. Receptor-mediated cell death is initiated
  by the recruitment of adapter proteins, like FADD (Fas associated death domain),
  via the DD (death domain), which then bind to the death effector domain-containing
  caspase-8 or -10. Formation of this DISC (death inducing signaling complex) results
  in the activation of caspase-8/10, which then directly cleaves and activates the
  executioner caspase-3. Mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway, proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
  members, Bax and Bak, translocate to the mitochondria. The BH3-only protein Bid
  activates Bax and Bak oligomerisation form an oligomeric pore in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. This results in the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors
  from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Cytochrome c triggers the assembly of the
  apoptosome (Apaf-1, caspase-9 and also the nucleotide adenosine tri phosphate (ATP)
  as a third component, binds and forms apoptosome). Subsequently, apoptosome activates
  caspase-3 and cell death. IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) binds directly to
  caspases and inhibits their enzymatic activity. The inhibitory function of IAPs
  is controlled by the SMAC (Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases).
