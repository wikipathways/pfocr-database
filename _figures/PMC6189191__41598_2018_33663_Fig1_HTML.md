caption: Structures of Vitamin K and biosynthesis in green plastids. (A) Chemical
  structure of Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone) and Vitamin K2 (menaquinone/MK4). Phylloquinone
  is present as a bound co-factor in photosystem 1 (PS1) of most cyanobacteria and
  plants. Hydroxyphylloquinone has been shown to replace phylloquinone in PS1 of the
  green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and is reported in this work as the major naphtoquinone
  of the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa. Vitamin Ks are composed of a 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone
  ring coupled to various types of polyprenyl chains. This chain consists of phytyl
  in phylloquinones which is a reduced form of the geranyl geranyl diphosphate found
  in menaquinone-4 (MK 4). Menaquinones are characterized by the presence of polyunsaturated
  polyprenyl chains of various lengths synthesized by polymerization of the MEP pathway
  5 carbon products IPP and DMAPP in bacteria. MK4 is characterized by a degree of
  polymerization of 4 and thus contains 20 carbon units. Menaquinones shuttle electrons
  between different respiratory complexes in anaerobic respiration or aerobic respiration
  in a microaerophilic environment. Phylloquinone is unable to supply this particular
  function. Mutants defective for vitamin K synthesis in algae and cyanobacteria substitute
  phylloquinone/menaquinone by plastoquinone for PSI function and thereby become highly
  light sensitive. (B) Synthesis of phylloquinone in plants. The end product of the
  shikimate pathway (chorismate) is converted in 4 steps in the chloroplast to O-succinyl
  benzoate (OSB) by a large protein called “phyllo” consisting of a fusion of the
  MenF, MenD, MenC and MenH gene products derived from the bacterial Men pathway of
  menaquinone synthesis. OSB diffuses out to the peroxisome where it is converted
  to DHNA (1.4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate) in 3 steps (catalyzed by MenE, MenB and DHNAT)
  and diffuses back to the plastid. The isoprenoid polyprenyl (phytyl) tail is added
  to DHNA by the MenA gene product. The DHNA ring is then reduced by the NDC1 NADPH
  dehydrogenase and methylated by the MenG gene product. In bacteria MK4 is synthesized
  by transfer to the quinone core of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Synthesis
  of GGPP in bacteria and plants involves the transfer of 3 IPP molecules onto a single
  DMAPP acceptor by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). Phylloquinone instead
  of MK4 is synthesized specifically in cyanobacteria and plants because geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate is reduced by GGPP reductase (GGPPR) prior to its transfer to the quinone
  core by the Men A prenyl transferase. IPP and DMAP are the end products of the 8
  steps MEP pathway in cyanobacteria and Archaeplastida.
