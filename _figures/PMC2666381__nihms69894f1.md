caption: TLR signaling and the role of epithelium in corneal innate defense. When
  cells are exposed to pathogens, TLRs such as TLR2, -4, and -5 at the cell surface
  recognize PAMPs such as lipoproteins, LPS, and flagellin, respectively. In contrast,
  nucleic acids released from damaged infected tissues or cells or captured from multiplying
  bacteria or viruses are brought to and recognized by TLRs (TLR3, -7, -8, and -9)
  in endosomes. TLR–ligand interaction triggers the activation of TLR signaling pathways
  in an MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent manner. The MyD88-dependent pathway (all
  TLRs except TLR3) utilizes MyD88, Mal (for TLR2 and -4) as adaptors and transduces
  signal through IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6, leading to the activation of NF-κB, p38,
  and JNK pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial
  peptides. In contrast, the MyD88-independent pathway uses TRIF as an adaptor and
  transduces signal through TBK1 and RIF3/7, leading to the expression of IFNs and
  the IFN-induced genes.
