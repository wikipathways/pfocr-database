caption: Cytoplasmic KSHV LANA isoforms recruit and antagonize cellular DNA sensor
  proteins cGAS as well as the Rad50-Mre11-CARD9 complex to inhibit innate immunity
  responses (IFN-β and NF-κB) and support KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. During
  KSHV lytic reactivation, free viral DNA in the cytosol is detected by host DNA sensors,
  such as cGAS and the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex. The cGAS-STING cascade leads to
  IFN-β production, whereas the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex is responsible for NF-κB
  cascade activation. A cross-talk between these two pathways may also be possible
  as indicated by the dashed arrows (Fig 6). Triggering of the Rad50/Mre11/CARD9 complex
  leads to the activation and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65 and the subsequent
  production of chemokines and cytokines. These events would interfere with the efficient
  KSHV lytic replication and therefore KSHV LANA ΔN isoforms block these signalling
  cascades by recruiting and inhibiting the upstream activators (cGAS as well as Rad50/Mre11).
