caption: Activation of FXR by natural or synthetic ligands decreases bile acid production
  and increases lipid and glucose metabolism. For the bile acid pathway, FGF19 is
  upregulated and CYP7A1 downregulated, which in turn causes a decrease of bile acid
  synthesis. Activation of FXR also increases SHP, which decreases SREBP1c, PEPCK,
  and G6Pase, causing an increase in lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism. Figure
  created with BioRender (accessed on 7 February 2022).
