caption: Screenshot of CNV and splicing representation. Copy number variations (CNVs)
  are represented in the Cascade display as gene nodes raised or lowered from the
  plane of the pathway by a height which is proportional to the value of the average
  CNV value within the samples set. Copy number gains are shown as nodes onto top
  of red cones, which copy losses as shown as genes on green cones. Alternative splicing
  frequency within a sample cohort is represented by a ring around the node which
  is coloured according to the frequency thresholds defined by the user
