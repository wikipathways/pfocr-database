caption: The endothelial barrier is maintained by the integrity of TJs and adherens
  junctions. During acute ischemic stroke, the expression of VEGFA increases obviously,
  and VEGFA binds to its receptor VEGFR-2. This receptor causes the sequential activation
  of VAV2-Tyr172, Rac, and PAK through Src. Activation of PAK increases the activity
  of MMPs, leading to VE-cadherin internalization and a subsequent increase in vascular
  permeability (VE-cadherin is an important factor in the formation of the vascular
  endothelial cell adhesion junction complex, which regulates the opening and closing
  of the endothelial barrier []). Upregulation of MMP protein expression also induces
  the degradation of TJ proteins. SAA protects the BBB by inhibiting the activation
  of the VEGFA-Src-MMP signaling pathway during acute ischemic stroke.
