caption: Regulatory Mechanisms of Dysregulated Notch Signaling in the CRC Immune Microenvironment.
  Abnormal activation of Notch signaling within the CRC microenvironment impacts various
  immune cell populations, especially regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Dysregulated
  Notch signaling activates downstream pathways, notably PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin,
  and TGF-β2, which collectively establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
  These pathways facilitate immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 and cytokines that
  recruit tumor-promoting macrophages, while concurrently suppressing the activity
  of CD8 + T cells
