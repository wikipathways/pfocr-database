caption: This reduced CYP27B1 expression can be overcome by lenalidomide, which significantly
  increases the expression of CYP27B1, leading to an increased conversion of 25D3
  into bioactive 1,25D3. Increased 1,25D3 level promote CD38 target expression on
  MM cells and combination of lenalidomide and exogenously added 25D3 improves the
  efficacy of MOR202-mediated cytotoxicity of MAMs.
