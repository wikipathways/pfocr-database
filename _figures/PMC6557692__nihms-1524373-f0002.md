  MMP gene expression []. However, as noted, TNF-α/TNFR does not alter ADAMTS activity
  []. Other factors such as Fas Ligand (FasL) produced by macrophages can lead to
  apoptosis through pro-caspase activation []. Growth factors can also activate the
  PI3K/AKT1/mTor pathway and “cross-talk” with the TNF-α/TNFR pathway []. This, and
