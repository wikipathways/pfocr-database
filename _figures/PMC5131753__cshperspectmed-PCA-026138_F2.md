caption: Possible mechanisms of ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 signaling to MDM2. Ribosomal
  proteins L5 and L11 appear to play integral roles in signaling ribosomal functions
  to p53. Free RPL5 or RPL11 may be released from the nucleolus during nucleolar stress,
  or act as sentinels for overproduction of ribosomal proteins during protein synthesis.
  By binding independently to MDM2, or as a component of the 5S ribonucleoprotein
  (RNP) complex, MDM2 is inhibited to stabilize p53. Conversely, p53 may also monitor
  fidelity of protein synthesis or rate of ribosome disassembly by enabling the 5S
  RNP complex to inhibit MDM2 and promote p53 transactivation.

  description: Possible mechanisms of ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 signaling to MDM2.
    Ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 appear to play integral roles in signaling ribosomal
    functions to p53. Free RPL5 or RPL11 may be released from the nucleolus during
    nucleolar stress, or act as sentinels for overproduction of ribosomal proteins
    during protein synthesis. By binding independently to MDM2, or as a component
    of the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, MDM2 is inhibited to stabilize p53.
    Conversely, p53 may also monitor fidelity of protein synthesis or rate of ribosome
    disassembly by enabling the 5S RNP complex to inhibit MDM2 and promote p53 transactivation.
