caption: The retinal progenitors exit the cell cycle and are divided into the Math5+
  and Math5− precursor pools based on the expression of Math5. Precursors with the
  transient activation of Math5 are RGC-competent. Some of these precursors choose
  the RGC differentiation pathway and generate nearly all RGCs. The remaining precursors
  lose RGC-competence when Math5 expression ceases, express other retinogenic bHLH
  factors and generate horizontal cells or, along with precursors from the Math5−
  pool, produce amacrine and cone cells. Together with NeuroD and Math3, Bhlhb5 determines
  the genesis GABAergic amacrine cells. The rod, bipolar and Müller cells are derived
  from the Math5− pool of precursors and Bhlhb5 expression provides the precursors
  with competence to differentiate into Type 2 bipolar cells.
