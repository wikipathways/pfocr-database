caption: Illustration on the possible underlying pharmacological mechanism of neurotrophic
  activity of SCH in cultured hippocampal neurons. CREB activated upon stimulation
  of TrkA signaling pathway by SCH transcribes most of the differentially expressed
  proteins in the present proteomic study, indicating that SCH might show neurotrophic
  activity through this canonical pathway.
