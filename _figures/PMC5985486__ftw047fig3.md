caption: RSV infection induces a response balanced by pro-inflammatory and tissue
  repair pathways. RSV infects multiple cell types in the lung, including macrophages,
  which result in the initial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  that also recruit more inflammatory cells such as monocytes. The production of inflammatory
  cytokines and COX-2 leads to the differentiation of CAM as well as the resulting
  observed pathology. Later, through a complex process that is IL-4Rα-, TLR4-, IFN-β-
  and LO-dependent, AAM differentiation occurs, counteracting the earlier inflammatory
  insults through (i) production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, (ii)
  induction and activation of PPARγ through TLR4, (iii) induction and activation of
  the 5- and 15-LO pathway preventing further production of COX-2 and the damaging
  prostaglandins and (iv) repair of damaged tissue through production of enzymes such
  as FIZZ1 and Ym1. Although the induction of AAM is beneficial to the host initially,
  if the AAM phenotype persists, it may lead to hypersensitivity to allergic triggers
  such as HDM.
