caption: Activation of plant immune system. A two-tiered immune system comprising
  pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) occur in
  plants. The instant immune response is mediated by PRRs that triggers PTI whereas
  NLR activate ETI upon translocation of T3E into the cytoplasm via. T3SS. Signalling
  events by PRRs and NLRs leads to overlapping downstream cellular responses, including
  defense-gene expression, production of ROS and callose deposition. The primary plant
  immune receptors viz. PRRs and NLRs function synergistically to ensure a robust
  level of key immune components during ETI. SAR is induced when the ETI takes over
  the pathogenic effector and plants are able to resist secondary infection in uninfected
  parts of plants.
