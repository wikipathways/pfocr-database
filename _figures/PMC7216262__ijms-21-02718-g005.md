caption: This figure illustrates the ways in which the mTOR signaling pathway contributes
  to bone (a) or kidney (b) regeneration. (a) mTOR activity (mTORC1 and mTORC2) is
  required for osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. mTORC1 is activated by bone
  morphogenetic protein (BMP), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Wnt signaling.
  mTORC1 inhibition promotes stem cell maintenance and autophagy while mTORC2 inhibition
  leads to cell fate change. (b) In the kidney, hypertrophic recovery depends on mTORC1
  activity. mTOR activity has been correlated to stem cell depletion such as that
  mTOR inhibition (purple) might play a role in maintaining kidney progenitors.
