caption: DNA damage as the ontological link between diabetes, obesity, and cancer.
  1-High glucose inhibits the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway leading to
  a compromised DNA repair mechanism 2- Hyperglycemia triggers the overproduction
  of ROS leading to oxidative stress which causes DNA damage 3-Chronic inflammation
  in obese individuals disrupts the redox balance contributing to oxidative stress-induced
  DNA damage 4-Elevated levels of leptin and estrogen in obesity induces DNA damage.
  Estrogen binds with its receptor estrogen receptor α (ER) to inhibit the DNA damage
  responders—Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases
