caption: (A) Constitutive expression of progerin in HGPS leads to defects in the DNA
  repair machinery exacerbated by impaired activity of NRF2 pathway and increased
  oxidative stress among other cellular stresses, which result in accumulation of
  double strand breaks (DSB), p53 signaling activation, accelerated senescence and
  increased inflammation. Expression of Δ133p53, otherwise diminished in HGPS fibroblasts
  approaching proliferation arrest, dominant-negatively inhibits FLp53 leading to
  a delay of cellular senescence as evidenced by diminished staining of SA-β-galactosidase
  (SA-β-gal) and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8)
  and the p53-target genes p21/CDKN1A and mir-34a. Furthermore, Δ133p53 overexpression
  indirectly increases the expression of the DNA repair factor RAD51 by dominant-negatively
  inhibiting FLp53 and increasing E2F1 expression levels, leading to a decrease in
  DNA damage foci. Effects of progerin expression in HGPS are depicted with red arrows,
  while effects of overexpression of Δ133p53 protein are indicated with green arrows.
