caption: Illustration of the involving mechanisms of sex-related hormones (gonadotrophin-releasing
  hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin) in liver
  physiology and pathology. GnRH increases the secretion of FSH through the PKA/CREB
  pathway, accelerates the differentiation of adipocytes in adipose tissue, which
  finally lead to hepatic fat accumulation. In amenorrhoea females with cirrhosis,
  abnormal GnRH secretion leads to low LH and FSH levels. FSH interacts with FSHR
  to reduce the level of LDLR, weaken the endocytosis of LDL-C, and lead to the increase
  of circulating LDL-C. After HRT treatment, FSH is inhibited and LDL-C content is
  improved. FSH activates Gi2 by binding to liver FSHRα/β-Arrestin-2/Akt pathway,
  which subsequently inhibits the binding between FoxO1 and SREBP-2, drives HMGCR
  transcription and de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, resulting in increased cholesterol
  accumulation. Liver transplantation can improve the hormone disorder related to
  chronic liver disease by restoring the circulating physiological levels of estradiol,
  FSH, LH, prolactin, testosterone, GH and IGF-1. Inhibition of prolactin by D2R activation
  leads to reduction of visceral adipose tissue. Prolactin improves hepatic steatosis
  through PRLR down regulation of FAT/CD36. Prolactin levels are significantly increased
  in patients with liver cirrhosis. Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
