caption: 'ANG II-dependent and independent pathways for renin signaling. Both renin
  and prorenin can bind the dimerized (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR], leading to the
  activation of different signaling pathways. Binding of prorenin to the receptor
  results in either direct activation of downstream MAP kinases signaling, or in the
  nonproteolytic activation of prorenin, facilitating the activation of ERK signaling
  cascades that can also be triggered by renin binding. Activation of these signaling
  cascades results in actin polymerization and the expression for profibrotic genes,
  leading to TGF-β, PAI-1, collagen-I, and fibronection synthesis. Binding of renin
  to the (P)RR also activates an ANG II-dependent pathway leading to the formation
  of ANG II and the activation of the AT1 receptor. Activation of both pathways ultimately
  leads to end-organ damage. Abbreviations: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; PAI-1,
  plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1.'
