caption: Antioxidant defense against HP toxicity. HP is oxidized to a toxic pyridinium
  metabolite (RHPP+) in the blood and brain by the specific iso-enzyme CYP 3A4. Superoxide
  may be produced by this metabolic pathway. RHPP+ causes lipid peroxidation which
  is removed by GST activity. GSH is oxidized to GSSG by this process. SOD is an enzyme
  that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide
  is removed by glutathione peroxidase and catalase. HP, haloperidol; GST, glutathione-S-transferase;
  GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathionine; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
