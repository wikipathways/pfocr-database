caption: Current model for selective compound families to promote neuronal compensation
  in HD via a stress response system centered onto FOXO and its co-factors. This model
  is relevant to the early phases of mutant huntingtin cytoxicity, when neurons and
  cells are vulnerable but remain functional, and before they undergo degeneration.
  (A) Pathway layout that results from the synthesis of C. elegans (response to light
  touch mediated by PLM neurons) and/or mouse striatal cell (mortality induced by
  serum deprivation) data as reported herein for neurosteroids, resveratrol and isoquercitrin
  or elsewhere for resveratrol and metformin, . Also included are C. elegans data
  on the effects of LOF mutants of genes in the canonical Wnt and insulin/IGF pathways
  (see Fig. ). Ptl-1/MAP signaling is poorly understood, possibly involving intestinal
  skn-1 for the regulation of stress response at the organismal level. (B) Resource
  networks for investigating neuronal compensation mechanisms used by compounds shown
  in (A). The figure shows a sub-network of top 200 genes strongly predicted by Wormnet
  to interact with one or more of seed genes (shown in blue) including sir-2.1/SIRT1,
  gsk-3/GSK-3ß, daf-16/FOXO, bar-1/ß-catenin, daf-12/NR1H3, aak-2/AMPK and ptl-1/MAP2.
  This sub-network is selected from a network of 1267 genes (see Table ) predicted
  by Wormnet to interact with sir-2.1/SIRT1, gsk-3/GSK-3ß, daf-16/FOXO, bar-1/ß-catenin,
  daf-12/NR1H3, aak-2/AMPK and ptl-1/MAP, the biological targets that may be used
  by the compounds tested herein. The top 200 predictions are based on the score for
  association to seed genes as provided in Wormnet. Edge thickness is proportional
  to the global-evidence score as provided in Wormnet for each gene-to-gene interaction
  in the graph. Table  shows whether inactivating gene neighbors may suppress or enhance
  neuronal dysfunction in 128Q nematodes as indicated by the overlap between the 1267
  predictions and 662 genes previously identified to modify neuronal dysfunction upon
  RNAi knock-down in these animals. The graph was generated using Cytoscape 3.3.0.
  The Cytoscape’s layout used for the graph is of the force-directed and spring-embedded
  type. This network is enriched for signalling pathways, cellular components and
  biological processes that are relevant to stress response and neuronal activity
  (see Results).
