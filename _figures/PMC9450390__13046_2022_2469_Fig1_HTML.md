caption: 'DDR pathway disorders contribute to immune recognition and tumor killing
  by increasing tumor immunogenicity. DDR mutation/inhibition impedes damaged DNA
  repair, enlarges chromosomal variation, and thus increases the levels of the tumor
  mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load (NAL). This subsequently activates CTLs
  and NK cells to exert anti-tumor activity via upregulating MHC-I and the antigen
  presentation process of APCs. This includes DCs and TAMs. At the same time, more
  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are recruited. (APC: Antigen-presenting cell;
  CTL: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; DC: Dendritic cell; DDR: DNA damage repair; DSB: DNA
  double strand break; GZMA: Granzyme A; IL-2: Interleukin-2; NK cells: Natural killer
  cells; PRF1: Perforin 1; SSB: DNA single strand break; TAM: Tumor-associated macrophage)'
