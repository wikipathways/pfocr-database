  description: Effect of miRNAs on cell cycle, proliferation, and differentiation.
    Selected miRNAs that are differentially expressed in cis-platin resistant cells
    were used to generate networks using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.
    miRNAs shown in green are down-regulated and those in red were up-regulated. The
    genes connected with dotted lines were those affected indirectly, and the ones
    connected with solid lines are the ones affected directly.
