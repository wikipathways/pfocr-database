caption: 'The interaction among the bone, immune system, and cancer cells. Tumor cells
  secrete PTHrP, PGE2, and other substances, which promote the transformation of osteoblasts
  into osteoclast precursors through the RANKL pathway and then differentiate into
  osteoclasts, causing bone destruction. Tumors can induce the release of CCl2 from
  the osteoclast precursors through the PD-1 pathway, which again promotes the occurrence
  of RANKL-induced osteoclasts. Osteoclasts secrete IDO-1, IL-10, and other substances
  to induce immunosuppression. TGF-β released by the destruction of bone and IL-6
  in the microenvironment also causes immunosuppression. T cells differentiate into
  Th17 and Treg instead of Th1, forming an immune-hostile (cold) tumor microenvironment.
  Th17 secretes IL-17 and IFN-γ to promote osteoclast differentiation, while Treg
  cells rely on the CTLA-4 pathway to inhibit the transformation of osteoclast precursors
  to osteoclasts. PTHrP: parathyroid hormone-related peptide; PGE2: prostaglandin
  E2; CCI2: chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2; IDO-1: indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1;
  IL: interleukin; TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β; IFN-γ: interferon-γ.'
