caption: Simplified (‘delta-5-steroids’ formed from pregnenolone are not shown) vertebrate
  sex steroidogenesis pathway [modified after ()]. Six reactions (solid arrows), though
  some with low activity, and the enzymes that catalyze (indicated by green color)
  them appear to be present in mollusks. CYP11A and CYP19A (marked by red color) have
  not been found in molluscan genomes so far, this supports the notion that two crucial
  steps - cholesterol side-chain cleavage and aromatization (dashed arrows) - of the
  classical vertebrate steroid biosynthetic pathway are absent in mollusks.
