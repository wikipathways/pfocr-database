caption: β2-Agonist signaling pathways. In the classical pathway, β2-agonists bind
  to β2AR, which are coupled via a stimulatory G-protein (Gs) to adenylyl cyclase
  (AC), resulting in formation of cAMP. cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates myosin
  light chain kinase (MLCK) in airway smooth muscle cells, resulting in relaxation.
  Increased cAMP may also activate EPAC to mediate effects such as inhibition of cell
  proliferation. β2AR are also coupled via Gs to a large conductance calcium-activated
  potassium channels (BK), leading to decreased intercellular Ca2+ and inhibition
  of myosin light chain kinase activation. Alternative signaling by β2AR may activate
  βγ-subunits of Gα and Gq and via Gαq, resulting in activation of PLC. β2AR also
  interact with β-arrestin-2, which interacts with p38 MAPK and PI3K. These alternative
  signaling pathways may increase the expression of inflammatory proteins and therefore
  may have a deleterious effect in asthma.
