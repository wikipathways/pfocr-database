caption: Metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment. In the tumor microenvironment,
  most of the glucose and oxygen transported by disorganized blood vessels are taken
  up by tumor cells, leading to hypoxia and a glucose-deprived microenvironment. Activated
  glycolysis in tumor cells generates increased lactic acid but still does not satisfy
  energy needs. As a result, LPL from tumor cells and other stromal cells activates
  adipocytes and induces lipolysis of stored triglycerides and secretion of FAs, which
  are transported into cells through CD36 or FATPs. In addition, tumor cells can generate
  FAs via de novo synthesis pathway using acetyl-CoA from the catabolism of glucose.
  ACC and FASN participate in this process. These FAs then participate in FAO or other
  signaling pathways to produce many immunosuppressive factors or generate LDs. In
  addition, lipoproteins in the TME are transported via lipoprotein receptors (LRs)
  and catabolize to cholesterol in cells. Tumor cells can also generate cholesterol
  via the mevalonate pathway. Dysregulated lipid metabolism in tumor cells promotes
  the formation of acidic, hypoxic, glucose-deprived, and lipid-rich immunosuppressive
  microenvironments
