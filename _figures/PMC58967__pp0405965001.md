caption: Putative biosynthetic pathway for taxiphyllin and triglochinin, the two cyanogenic
  glucosides in T. maritima. In the present study, CYP79E1 and CYP79E2 were isolated
  and shown to catalyze the conversion of l-Tyr to (Z)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime.
  A CYP71E1 homolog is thought to catalyze the conversion of (Z)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime
  to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. p-Hydroxyphenylacetonitrile is thought to constitute
  the branch point between taxiphyllin and triglochinin synthesis. Dhurrin is shown
  for comparison.
