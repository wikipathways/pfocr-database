caption: Cellular pathways to Aβ production and regulation of its clearance. In neuronal
  cells, proteolytic processing of the APP occurs via the major nonamyloidogenic pathway
  involving an α‐secretase. It cleaves APP within the Aβ sequence and produces an
  N‐terminal soluble ectodomain sAPPα and a membrane‐bound fragment, which is, in
  turn, cleaved by the γ‐secretase complex. This cleavage generates the AICD and a
  short peptide p3 of unknown function. A minor amyloidogenic pathway begins with
  APP cleavage by β‐secretase (BACE), which releases an N‐terminal soluble ectodomain
  sAPPβ and a C‐terminal fragment, which after cleavage by γ‐secretase generates Aβ
  and AICD. sAPPα and sAPPβ have neuroprotective properties, and Aβ has physiological
  roles and its action is terminated mainly by NEP or other ADEs. Due to its propensity
  to aggregate, Aβ can also form oligomers, which are toxic and cause neuronal cell
  death. Amyloid plaques formed from Aβ in a complex with other proteins are a hallmark
  of AD. The AICD produced in the α‐secretase pathway is mainly cytosolic and can
  be cleaved by IDE or caspases. AICD produced in the amyloidogenic pathway binds
  a stabilizing factor Fe65 and translocates to the nucleus where, together with a
  histone acetyl transferase Tip60 and other regulatory factors, binds to the promoters
  of a variety of genes, including NEP and TTR, up‐regulating their expression. Both
  NEP and TTR are involved in amyloid clearance

  description: Cellular pathways to Aβ production and regulation of its clearance.
    In neuronal cells, proteolytic processing of the APP occurs via the major nonamyloidogenic
    pathway involving an α‐secretase. It cleaves APP within the Aβ sequence and produces
    an N‐terminal soluble ectodomain sAPPα and a membrane‐bound fragment, which is,
    in turn, cleaved by the γ‐secretase complex. This cleavage generates the AICD
    and a short peptide p3 of unknown function. A minor amyloidogenic pathway begins
    with APP cleavage by β‐secretase (BACE), which releases an N‐terminal soluble
    ectodomain sAPPβ and a C‐terminal fragment, which after cleavage by γ‐secretase
    generates Aβ and AICD. sAPPα and sAPPβ have neuroprotective properties, and Aβ
    has physiological roles and its action is terminated mainly by NEP or other ADEs.
    Due to its propensity to aggregate, Aβ can also form oligomers, which are toxic
