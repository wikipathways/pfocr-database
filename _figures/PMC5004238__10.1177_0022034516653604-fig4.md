caption: Schematic illustration of axon-microglia interactions and the CASP6/p38/TNF-α
  signaling pathway in the spinal cord dorsal horn of male rodents. CASP6 is synthesized
  by C-fiber neurons of DRG and uniquely localized in axonal terminals in the superficial
  dorsal horn. CASP6-expressing axonal terminals form synapses with lamina IIo excitatory
  neurons, which in turn synapse with lamina I projection neurons to form a pain circuit
  (). These CASP6-expressing axonal terminals also have close contacts with microglial
  cell bodies and processes. Peripheral tissue and nerve injury results in CASP6 release
  from axonal terminals, and the secreted CASP6 then acts on microglial cells to trigger
  p38 activation. Upon activation, p38 not only induces synthesis of TNF-α and BDNF
  in microglia but also causes release of TNF-α and BDNF, which then act on nociceptive
  neurons to induce central sensitization and transition from acute pain to chronic
  pain. TNF-α and BDNF induce pain hypersensitivity (e.g., mechanical allodynia) via
  regulating both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in spinal cord pain
  circuits (; ; ). It remained to be tested whether this mechanism also applies to
  the trigeminal system and orofacial pain. Modified from  with permission from the
  journal. BDNF, brain-derived growth factor; CASP6, caspase 6; DRG, dorsal root ganglia;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α.
