caption: Following detection of cytosolic DNA with a DNA sensor, STING forms oligomers
  on ER or other intracellular membranes. The C-terminus of STING then recruits IRF3
  and TBK1, facilitating IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 (left). The mutation of STING
  at Ser366 or Leu374 does not impair its ability to recruit and activate TBK1, as
  evidenced by the phosphorylation of TBK1 and STING in ISD-stimulated cells harboring
  these mutations (right). However, S366A or L374A mutation abolishes the interaction
  between STING and IRF3, thereby preventing IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1.
