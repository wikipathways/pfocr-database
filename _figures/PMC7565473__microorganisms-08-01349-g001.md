caption: 'Scheme of the proposed pathway of aromatic amino acids metabolism: The blue
  box (left) includes the metabolites related to the tryptophan metabolism studied
  in this work. The green box (right) includes the metabolites related to the tyrosine
  and phenylalanine metabolisms. Possible biosynthetic pathways leading to the de
  novo synthesis of three aromatic amino acids are included. The metabolites that
  include abbreviation in parentheses were measured by the UPLC-MS/MS method.'
