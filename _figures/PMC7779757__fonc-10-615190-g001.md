caption: WNT pathaway signaling. Schematic representation of canonical (β-catenin
  dependent) and non-canonical (β-catenin independent) WNT signaling. WNT ligand interaction
  with FZD receptors together with LRP5/6 co-receptors inhibits the activity of the
  “destruction complex” (composed by Axin, APC, CK1 and GSK3β), allowing the stabilization
  of β-catenin, its translocation into the nucleus and the transcriptional activation
  of target genes. The activation of the non-canonical pathway involves additional
  co-receptors (e.g. ROR1 and ROR2) and is mediated by small GTPases RhoA, Daam1 and
  ROCK, acting on cytoskeleton remodelling, or PLC, JNK and NFAT, acting on transcriptional
  activity. Further layers of regulation of the pathway are exerted at the level of
  WNT ligands modification/secretion (mainly through PRCN), engagement of additional
  activator proteins (Norrin, Syndecans, RSPO, LGR4/5, ZNRF3) or the presence of antagonists
  (DKK, WIF, sFRPs). Compounds under clinical evaluation are indicated next to the
  appropriate target. Images have been created with Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com/).
