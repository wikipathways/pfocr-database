caption: 'Pathway for the catabolism of 3HPP in E. coli. (A) Genetic map of the chromosomal
  mhp cluster. Relevant genes are indicated by blocks: genes with similar shading
  participate in the same enzymatic step or in the same functional unit (route) of
  the pathway. Regulatory and transport genes are shown by solid and vertically striped
  blocks, respectively. Genes flanking the mhp cluster (lacI and yaiL) are represented
  by thick lines. The arrows show the directions of gene transcription. Bent arrows
  represent the Pr and Pa promoters. The location of the BIME is shown. The inactive
  and active forms of the MhpR activator are represented by empty and solid hexagons,
  respectively. + indicates transcriptional activation. The inducer molecule (3HPP
  and 3HCI) is represented by a solid circle. (B) Biochemistry of the 3HPP catabolic
  pathway. The metabolites are 3HPP, DHPP (2,3-dihydroxyphenlypropionic acid), HKNDA
  (2-hydroxy-6-keto-nona-2,4-diene 1,9-dioic acid), HPDA (2-hydroxy-penta-2,4-dienoic
  acid), and HKP (4-hydroxy-2-ketopentanoic acid). The enzymes are MhpA (3HPP monooxygenase),
  MhpB, (DHPP 1,2 dioxygenase), MhpC (HKNDA hydrolase), MhpD (HPDA hydratase), MhpE
  (HKP aldolase), and MhpF (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase [acylating]). The 3HPP transport
  protein (MhpT) is represented by a thick arrow. Out and In indicate outside and
  inside the cell, respectively.'
