caption: 'Hexose Shuttles Interact with Amino Acids and Regulate Membrane Transporters
  and The Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway: Glutamine activates the rate limiting enzyme
  of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (GFAT) in response to the depleting levels
  of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), which in a series of reactions involving the fatty acid
  β-oxidation and the nucleotide uridine trisphosphate (UTP) produces the UDP-N acetyl
  glucosamine (UDPGlcNAc). UDPGlcNAc is the substrate for O-linked glycosylation (OGlcNAc)
  and N-linked GlcNAc (NGlcNAc) of several membrane proteins and transcription factors.
  Glycosylation of the multifunctional surface antigen and the Solute Carrier Family
  3 Member 2 (SLC3A2/ 4F2HC/CD98), which complexes with the glutamine, cysteine and
  the essential amino acids transporters across the plasma membrane involved in the
  de novo fatty acid and the cholesterol biosynthesis (see the text) b Serine-Glycine
  (One Carbon Metabolic) Biosynthetic Pathway: TIGAR mediated inhibition of kinase
  activity of PFK2/FBP2 inhibits the PFK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation downregulates
  the PKM2, which results in the accumulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP
  accumulation activates the reversible reactions and increase the levels of 3-phosphoglycerate.
  The enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) diverts the 3-phosphoglycerate
  to activate the serine-glycine (one-carbon metabolic) biosynthetic pathway. The
  one-carbon metabolic pathway activates multiple pathways for the synthesis of the
  nucleotides, phospholipids, inositol phosphates, S adenosine methionine, and the
  creatine phosphate (PCr), which are involved in the whole carbon metabolic homeostasis
