caption: Diagram showing the model proposed for the association of EMT, CSCs and the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in CaP radioresistance and the effect of possible
  action of BEZ235 on radiosensitivity. (a) RT can induce CaP-RR cells with EMT and
  enhanced CSC phenotypes, and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway,
  resulting in CaP metastasis and recurrence after RT. (b) A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
  BEZ235 combined with RT can inactivate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, reducing
  EMT and CSC phenotypes and leading to increased radiosensitivity. All data used
  in RR cell lines were based on cells between 5 and 6 weeks post radiation treatment

  phenotypes is associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in prostate
  cancer radioresistance.
