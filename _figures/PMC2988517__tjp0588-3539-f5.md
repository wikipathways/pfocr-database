caption: In control fetuses and lambs, stimulation of the β2-AR increases cAMP production
  to activate PKA to phosphorylate HSL and perilipin, which hydrolyses intracellular
  triglyceride stored in the lipid droplet. IUGR fetuses and lambs have lower β2-AR
  concentrations, which desensitizes them to catecholamine stimulate lipolysis, resulting
  in less NEFA and glycerol released from adipocytes. In the diagram, reductions in
  the IUGR animals are portrayed by smaller font and receptor size.
