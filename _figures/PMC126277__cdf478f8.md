caption: Fig. 8. Model of Tpl2-mediated COX-2 transactivation and PGE2 production
  in response to LPS. LPS engages a Tpl2-dependent pathway, which leads to the activation
  of ERK and p90RSK downstream of MEK. The same signals, in combination with p38 MAPK-transduced
  signals, activate Msk1. p90Rsk and Msk1, in turn, phosphorylate and activate CREB,
  which is critical for the transactivation of COX-2, a key enzyme for the biosynthesis
  of PGE2. The interrupted line connecting Tpl2 with p38MAPK indicates that non-obligatory
  signals transduced via Tpl2 may contribute to the activation of p38MAPK by LPS.
