caption: Prolonged stress and depression is known to cause atrophy of spine and synapses
  in brain regions implicated in depression, notably the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
  Preclinical studies suggest that this is a result of reduced production and release
  of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Rapid acting antidepressants (eg, ketamine
  and scopolamine) reverse these stress-induced deficits by inducing a cascade of
  glutamate neurotransmitter signaling events. (1) Ketamine is thought to act via
  blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors located on inhibitory λ-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA)-ergic neurons. (2) This causes disinhibition of the pyramidal cells,
  resulting in a burst of glutamate transmission. (3) Increased glutamate release
  activates α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors,
  resulting in depolarization and calcium influx. (4) Depolarization of the cell induces
  release of BDNF and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
  signaling pathway. (5) Stimulation of mTORC1 increases the synthesis of synaptic
  proteins that results in increased number and function of spine synapses.
