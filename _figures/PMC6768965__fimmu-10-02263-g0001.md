caption: Manipulation of the interferon signaling pathway in myeloid cells. HIV-1
  infection is restricted by the host proteins SAMHD1 and TREX1, limiting Reverse
  transcription. RNA is detected primarily by RIG-I and signaled through MAVS. Reverse
  Transcribed viral DNA is primarily detected by cGAS and signals through cGAMP. PRR
  recognition signals are then transduced through STING which results in the downstream
  clustering of TBK1 which complexes with TRAF3 and IRF-3. TBK1 then undergoes ubiquitination
  and auto-phosphorylation and can then phosphorylate IRF-3. Phosphorylated IRF-3
  then dimerises and translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the expression
  of IFN-I. HIV-1 limits the IFN response in many ways, including undergoing reverse
  transcription with in the capsid, the capsid also recruits host proteins (primarily
  cyclophilins) to shield HIV-1 from PRRs. The HIV-1 protease targets RIG-I for degradation.
  HIV-1 Vpr and Vif prevent the auto-phosphorylation of TBK1 and subsequent translocation
  of IRF3 to the nucleus. Extracellular vesicles in the HIV-1 inoculum can induce
  IRF-1 translocation to the nucleus. IRF-1 induces a subset of ISGs and an IRF-1
  binding site is also located on the HIV-1 promoter which may enhance subsequent
  virus production.
