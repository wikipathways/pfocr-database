caption: Model of SHRC interaction with retromer on membranes. (A) We propose that
  the CSC of the retromer is recruited to the endosomal membrane through mechanisms
  involving GTP-bound Rab 7 and cargo proteins that are destined to enter the retromer-mediated
  sorting pathway. When retromer accumulates to high density on the endomembrane,
  the SHRC is then recruited through cumulative binding of higher-affinity (*) and
  lower-affinity FAM21 repeats with VPS35 proteins, thus facilitating the cargo enrichment
  process and promoting subsequent F-actin–mediated maturation of the retromer subdomain,
  vesicle scission, and trafficking. (B) Bird's-eye view of the process discussed
  in A after initial recruitment of the SHRC via FAM21-mediated interactions with
  VPS35.

  complex to the retromer.
