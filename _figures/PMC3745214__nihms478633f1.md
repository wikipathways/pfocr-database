caption: A. TGF-β ligands signal through distinct receptors and Smads that are modulated
  by adaptor proteins and ubiquitinators. TGF-β binds to serine threonine kinase receptor
  complexes that phosphorylate R-Smads as well as adaptor proteins such as β2-spectrin.
  R-Smads, β2-spectrin and Smad-4 form a heteromeric complex, translocate to the nucleus
  and regulate target genes expression. At all levels, Smad modulation occurs through
  adaptor proteins as well as E3 ligases such as PRAJA and Smurfs, generating diverse
  and complex signals. B. Smad-independent signaling. TGF-β can promote the activity
  of several signaling pathways other than Smad, including mitogen activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositide 3′ kinase (PI3K), TRAF6-TAK1-p38/JNK, Rho-Rock,
  among others. Such alternative signal transducers often regulate the Smad pathway.
