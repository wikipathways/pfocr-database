caption: Regulation of BCR Signaling Pathway with FCRL genes. The network depicts
  differential regulation of BCR signaling pathway with FCRL genes. Small circular
  nodes indicate joint/synergistic regulation of downstream genes (‘and’ rules) whereas
  multiple incoming edges to a rectangular node indicate that anyone of the upstream
  nodes can regulate downstream nodes (‘or’ rule). Colors of the rectangles ranging
  from white to red indicate low to high impact score. Widths of the rectangles’ outlines
  and their color ranging from blue to green indicate fold difference (mRNAs) between
  protein-boosted and MVA-boosted participants at peak. Blue represents higher expression
  after MVA boost and green represent higher expression in protein boost. Impact scores
  have been divided by the largest impact score in the pathway.
