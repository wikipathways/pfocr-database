  on CD8+ effector T cells and required for the secretion of effector molecules and
  cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. (B) Activation of TNF/TNFR2 pathway enhances

  pro-inflammatory cytokine production and at the same time the induction of active
  Tregs. (E) tmTNFα can induce CXCR4 expression in myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs) through the TNFR2-dependent pathway, which facilitates the recruitment of
  MDSCs to tumor tissue with the function of Treg induction and inhibition of T-cell
  function. (F) TNFR2+ EPCs can suppress T-cell proliferation. (G) Progranulin can
  promote the switch from fibroblasts to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through

  and invasion of cancer cells.
