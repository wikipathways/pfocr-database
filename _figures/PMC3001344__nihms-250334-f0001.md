caption: The de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) where serine palmitoyltransferase condenses L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA, generating
  3-ketodihydrosphingosine (3-keto-DHS), which is rapidly reduced to form dihydrosphingosine
  (DHS). DHS is N-acylated to form dihydroceramide, which is further converted into
  ceramide by the introduction of a double bond in the DHS base. Newly synthesized
  ceramide is transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is converted to sphingomyelin
  (SM) and glucosylceramide (GluCer). Ceramide transport to the Golgi is facilitated
  by CERT as well as vesicular transport . Transfer of GluCer from the cytoplasmic
  to the luminal side of the Golgi for the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids
  (GSL) is facilitated by FAPP2 . SM and GSL are transported via vesicles from the
  Golgi to the plasma membrane. The recycling/degradation of higher order sphingolipids
  in the plasma membrane or lysosomal compartment also gives rise to ceramide, which
  can be further deacylated to yield sphingosine . Sphingosine and ceramide can be
  phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated by kinase and phosphatase activities, which
  exist in multiple compartments (see text for details). Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
  can be irreversibly degraded by S1P lyase located at the cytoplasmic side of the
  ER. Alternatively, S1P can be de-phosphorylated by specific phosphatases at the
  luminal side and converted back to ceramide for recycling (salvage pathway). The
  salvage pathway may also utilize sphingosine exiting directly from the lysosome.
  SM synthase activity resulting in ceramide-phosphoethanolamine (CPE) formation is
  found in the plasma membrane and ER.
