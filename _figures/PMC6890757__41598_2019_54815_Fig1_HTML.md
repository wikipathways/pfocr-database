caption: Flower of T. cinerariifolium (A) and biosynthetic pathway of pyrethrins (B).
  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of pyrethrins. Chrysanthemic acid and pyrethric acid
  as acid moieties are synthesized from dimethylallyl diphosphates by T. cinerariifolium
  chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (TcCDS), T. cinerariifolium alcohol dehydrogenase
  2 (TcADH2), T. cinerariifolium aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (TcALDH1), T. cinerariifolium
  chrysanthemol 10-hydroxylase (TcCHH), and T. cinerariifolium 10-carboxychrysanthemic
  acid 10-methyltransferase (TcCCMT). Pyrethrolone, jasmolone, and cinerolone as alcohol
  moieties are synthesized from linolenic acid by enzymes related to oxylipin pathway,
  including T. cinerariifolium jasmone hydroxylase (TcJMH), and unknown enzyme(s).
  Finally, chrysanthemoyl-CoA (the CoA-activated version of chrysanthemic acid) and
  pyrethrolone are esterified by T. cinerariifolium GDSL (Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu motif) lipase
  (TcGLIP) to produce pyrethrin I. Compounds and enzymes are indicated by red and
  blue text, respectively. Unidentified enzymes are indicated as question marks.
