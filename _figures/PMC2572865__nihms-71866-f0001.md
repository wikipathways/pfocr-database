caption: Osteoblasts, the niche cells in this model, express the parathyroid (PTH)
  and parathyroid-related peptide receptor (PTH1R). PTH signaling through PTH1R activates
  the phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA)
  pathways. PKA activation stimulates the upregulation of Jagged 1 (JAG1), which signals
  through Notch receptors on adjacent cells, for example, hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs), in which the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved by γ-secretase
  and translocates to the nucleus in which it acts as a transcription factor promoting
  self-renewal. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) binds to BMP receptors A and B on osteoblasts
  and promotes quiescence in HSCs. Wnt is produced and secreted by osteoblasts. Wnt’s
  receptor on HSC is frizzled in conjunction with the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP) 5. A signaling pathway following Wnt binding of the receptor culminates
  in β-catenin translocating to the nucleus and regulating genes involved in self-renewal.
  Osteoblasts also produce Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. The receptor
  tyrosine kinase TIE2 is expressed on HSCs and its ligand angiopoietin 1 (ANG-1)
  is expressed by osteoblasts. TIE2 signaling upregulates adhesion molecules and promotes
  HSC maintenance in the marrow. N-cadherin (N-CAD) is expressed on osteoblasts and
  on some HSCs. N-CAD expressed on adjacent cells dimerizes to form adherens junctions.
  β1-Integrins bind to fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expressed
  by osteoblasts to immobilize HSCs and also promote quiescence and protect from apoptosis.
