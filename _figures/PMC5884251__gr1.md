caption: 'Oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products regulate glucose and glutamine
  metabolism in cancer. Glycolysis is the main source of ATP production rather than
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in tumor cells. Glucose transporters and glycolysis
  metabolic enzymes are up-regulated by oncogene product c-Myc. It was believed that
  mutation of p53 causes loss of function. More recently, p53’s mutation-based “gain
  of function” has been accepted: e.g., IκB kinase (IKK) is inhibited by wild type
  p53 (wtp53) but activated by mutant p53 (mutp53). Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
  and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM1) activities are also regulated by p53 in the same
  way. This means reprogramming of which metabolic pathway is directed to lactate
  when cellular transformation occurs. This is a significant reprogramming of metabolic
  pathways during carcinogenesis. Hypoxia accelerates glycolysis dependency for energy
  production through activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF1).
  Malate and oxaloacetate (OAA) in the TCA cycle can be metabolized to pyruvate in
  cytosol. Especially, this pathway is important for metabolism of glutamine, rather
  than glucose, through α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) (see ). Two isozymes of glutamine-OAA
  transaminase (GOT) are closely associated in this pathway. ASCT2, neutral amino
  acid transporter; SIRT6, distant mammalian Sir2 homolog (sirtuin 6); NEK2, never
  in mitosis gene A-related kinase 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; HK2, hexokinase 2,
  TIGAR, TP-53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator; PFK1/2, 6-phosphofructo
  1-kinase 1/2; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ALDA/C, aldolase A/C; TPI, triosephosphate
  isomerase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase; PGK1, phosphoglycerate
