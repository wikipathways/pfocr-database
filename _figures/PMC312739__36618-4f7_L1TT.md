caption: A schematic representation of the set1Δ-induced cellular response that leads
  to the transcriptional activation of repair genes. We propose that phosphorylation
  of Rfa2p can result either from (1) the activation of Rad53p (Rad53*) in response
  to a set1Δ-induced chromatin damage, or (2) from the deregulation of a phosphorylation
  pathway controlled by Set1p. Both models are not exclusive. The set1Δ cellular response
  is shown in parallel with the DNA damage response. N-Pi and C-Pi indicated phosphorylation
  in the amino and carboxyl terminus of Rfa2p, respectively.

  hyperphosphorylation of replication protein A that leads to transcriptional activation
  of repair genes.
