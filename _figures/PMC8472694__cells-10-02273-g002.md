caption: 'Phospholipid synthesis pathways and membrane contacts. There are two branches
  of the Kennedy pathway: the CDP-choline and the CDP-ethanolamine pathways. Imported
  extracellular choline is first phosphorylated by CK (a cytosolic enzyme) to phosphocholine,
  then converted to CDP-choline by CT (a nuclear and cytosol enzyme), before finally
  being catalyzed to PC by CPT (an integral ER membrane protein) by transferring a
  diacylglycerol to CDP-choline. For PE synthesis, ethanolamine is first phosphorylated
  to phosphoethanolamine by EK (a cytosolic protein), then converted to CDP-ethanolamine
  by ET (another cytosolic enzyme), before finally being catalyzed to PE by EPT (also
  an integral ER membrane protein) by transferring a diacylglycerol to CDP-ethanolamine.
  Alternatively, PE can also be converted to PC by three successive methylation reactions
  catalyzed by PEMT (an ER/MAM enzyme). In addition, PS is transported to mitochondria
  and decarboxylated to PE by PSD (an enzyme on the mitochondrial inner membrane).
  For PS synthesis, PSS1(an enzyme on MAM) catalyzes the exchange of choline for serine
  in PC, whereas PSS2 (also on MAM) catalyzes the exchange of ethanolamine for serine
  in PE. Enzymes of the ER membrane are indicated in blue, whereas cytosolic enzymes
  are in red. Enzymes: CK, choline kinase; CCT, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase;
  CPT, cholinephosphotransferase; CTP, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT); EK,
  ethanolamine kinase; ECT, phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase; EPT, ethanolaminephosphotransferase;
  PS decarboxylase (PSD); PS synthase-1 (PSS1); PS synthase-2 (PSS2); MAM: mitochondrial
  associated membrane; MFN1: mitofusin 1; MFN2: mitofusin 2; IP3R: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  receptor; GRP75: glucose-regulated protein 75; MCU: mitochondrial calcium uniporter;
