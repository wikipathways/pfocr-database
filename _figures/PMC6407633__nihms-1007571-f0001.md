caption: 'The complexity of signaling in the cell. (A) The figure illustrates extracellular
  stimuli transmitted through the membrane, cytoplasm to the nucleus, and cellular
  response via turning genes on/off. Signaling is (often) mediated by allosteric events
  through proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, and their permanent and short-lived
  combinatorial associations. (B) An outline of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling
  pathways as an example of the complexity of signaling in the cell. Estrogen receptors
  (Era and ERP) can be selectively activated by ligand binding (). ER activation is
  controlled by extracellular signals, hormone and co-factor binding events (). Extracellular
  signals lead to phosphorylation of the ER monomer. Examples of the extracellular
  signals are: (i) binding of dopamine and cAMP to GPCR can activate PKA; (ii) growth
  factors (GFs) activate their receptors with subsequent activation of the RAS- RAF-ERK
  pathway; and (iii) non-genomic action of ER in the membrane activates the PI3K-Akt
  pathway. Both antagonist and agonist ligands can prompt ER dimerization with different
  allosteric consequences for the helix H12 position. The shift in helix H12 triggered
  by antagonist ligands blocks subsequent co-factor binding, while agonist ligands
  allostericaly change the ER conformations to allow co-factor recruitment. Cofactors
  () like the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and the repressor of the estrogen
  receptor activity (REA) lead to repression of ER response elements (ERE). Examples
  of direct activators are the thyroid hormone receptor (TRAP), steroid receptor activator
  (SRA), and steroid receptor co-activators (SRCs). Secondary co-activators (like
  CoCoA and PRMT) also bind ERS indirectly through association with SRCs. Thus, the
  network diagram provides an overview of the binding events.'
