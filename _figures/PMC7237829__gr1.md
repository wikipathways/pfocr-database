caption: 'Role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cancer. Cancer cells frequently
  encounter extrinsic stresses that challenge protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and growth factor withdrawal. Intrinsic
  stresses, such as oncogene activation, proteasome dysfunction, increased glycolysis,
  and increased protein secretion, can lead to additional demands on the secretory
  pathway. Furthermore, genomic instability and somatic mutations that cripple protein
  folding can lead to ER stress. On detecting an accumulation of ER misfolded proteins,
  the UPR is initiated by three transmembrane ER proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme
  1α (IRE1α; alias endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling), PRK-like ER kinase
  (PERK; alias eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α kinase 3), and activating
  transcription factor 6α (ATF6α; see text for signaling details). The combined outputs
  of the UPR can regulate tumor growth at many levels, including cell survival, autophagy,
  angiogenesis, glycolysis, migration, metastases, and chemoresistance. Modified from
