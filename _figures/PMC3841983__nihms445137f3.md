caption: Cilia sensors act to provide continuous feedback to regulate cilia beat function,
  cilia orientation following cilia biogenesis during post-injury repair and potentially,
  ion and mucin components of airway surface liquid (ASL) (left). In response to environmental
  factors (center), there is enhanced activation of specialized sensors to trigger
  host response pathways. Impaired or mutated sensory protein or pathway results in
  features of disease (right).
