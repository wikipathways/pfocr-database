caption: How MRN expression/activity may affect tumor initiation and progression.
  (a) In healthy cells, MRN complex mitigates physiological RS. In the presence of
  MRN haploinsufficiency, RS increases favoring DSB accumulation. Contextually, the
  DNA repair pathway and p53 functions are defected, contributing to a further increase
  DSBs in a context permissive to cell survival. This condition may lead to genome
  instability favoring the selection of tumor-initiating cells. (b) In full brown
  cancer cells, the MRN complex counteracts the oncogene/therapy-induced RS. Here,
  MRN complex targeting increases RS-induced DSBs and impairs their repair. Thus,
  the high levels of DSBs become incompatible with cell survival, favoring tumor regression.
