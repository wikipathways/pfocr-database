caption: 'The calcineurin activity rhythm is driven by the circadian oscillator in
  photoreceptors. This calcineurin activity rhythm is downstream of the rhythmic oscillation
  of cAMP, while it is upstream of both MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling that lead to the
  circadian regulation of L-VGCCα1 subunit trafficking and membrane insertion. There
  are still numerous unknown steps (marked by #) that intervene between the various
  signaling components. Whether the sequestering and recycling of the L-VGCC subunits
  are under circadian control will need further investigation (marked by ?).'
