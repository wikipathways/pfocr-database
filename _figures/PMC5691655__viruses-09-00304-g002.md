caption: 'HBV components interact with DDR pathways and proteins. HBx arrests p53
  in the cytoplasm and interacts with different factors in the nucleus e.g., DDB1,
  XPB, XPD, and TFIIH. HBx interaction with TFIIH components XPB and XPD interferes
  with TC-NER activity. HBx-DDB1 interaction induces Smc5/6 degradation, thereby allowing
  transcription from cccDNA. Accumulation of wild-type HBsAg and PreS mutant proteins
  in the ER induces Ogg1 expression through ER Stress and oxidative damage, thereby
  activating BER pathway. On the other hand, they inhibit NBS1 nuclear translocation
  affecting DSBR. Proteins of different DDR pathways are represented with different
  colours: TC-NER in green, DSBR in pink, and BER in yellow. Red bars mean inhibition.'
