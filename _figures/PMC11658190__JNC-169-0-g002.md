caption: Functions of the Ddx family in the development, differentiation, and homeostasis
  of oligodendrocytes. This figure summarizes the roles of the Ddx family in the development,
  differentiation, and homeostasis of oligodendrocytes. Ddx5 regulates the total amount
  of MBP protein by modulating translation during oligodendrocyte differentiation
  and maturation. Concurrently, it adjusts the ratio of MBP variants by inhibiting
  the production of exon2‐containing MBP isoforms through the control of MBP splicing.
  Ddx20 contributes to the survival of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cells (OPCs) by stabilizing the assembly of snRNPs through the SMN complex
  and suppressing the p53 pathway via Mdm2 splicing control. Additionally, Ddx20 is
  involved in the maintenance of myelin‐related gene expression, the splicing control
  of some myelin‐related genes, and induction of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, promoting
  myelin formation and contributing to the survival of oligodendrocytes. Ddx54 is
  involved in the correct migration of OPCs produced from NSPCs and in maintaining
  adult myelin structures. Ddx54 binds to the MBP protein to regulate its intracellular
  localization and interacts with MBP mRNA to control the production of specific exon2‐containing
  MBP splicing variants
