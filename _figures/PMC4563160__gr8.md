caption: FASN inhibition blocks metabolic and signal transduction pathways vital to
  cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival. FASN inhibition results in inhibition
  of Akt and S6 phosphorylation in the AKT–mTOR signal transduction pathway. In the
  Wnt–β-catenin pathway, FASN inhibition results in the inhibition of Lrp6 and β-catenin
  phosphorylation as well as the expression of TCF promoter-driven genes such as c-Myc.
  FASN inhibition impairs the plasma membrane localization of palmitoylated and other
  lipid-raft-associated proteins such as N-Ras. Our data fit a model whereby the disruption
  of lipid rafts and mislocalization of membrane-associated proteins can drive inhibition
  of signaling through cellular growth and survival pathways such as AKT–mTOR and
  Wnt–β-catenin. Signal transduction through molecules such as K-Ras or pathways such
  as AKT–mTOR is tightly linked with tumor cell metabolism of glucose and glutamine
  as well as lipid biosynthesis.
