caption: 'ROS induce cell death, mainly including apoptosis, necroptosis and ferroptosis.
  (Ⅰ) Exceeding ROS promote both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway: ROS
  activate extrinsic apoptosis pathway by accelerating the ubiquitin degradation of
  c-FLIP, then enhancing the binding between the adaptor protein and pro-caspase-8;
  ROS induce intrinsic apoptosis by facilitating the release of Cyt-c from mitochondria
  to cytoplasm to form apoptosome with casp-9 and APAF-1. (Ⅱ) ROS and necroptosis
  form a positive feedback loop: ROS stabilize RIP3 protein to lead to the formation
  of DISC Ⅱb (necrosome); in turn, RIP3 can facilitate the TCA cycle and aerobic respiration
  in mitochondria to induce ROS generation. (Ⅲ) Ferroptosis is a ROS-dependent form
  of RCD: the basic of ferroptosis is GSH anabolism disorder leads to the lethal accumulation
  of PUFAs peroxidation; p53 plays opposite roles on ROS and ferroptosis by inhibiting
  SLC7A11 expression or increasing NADPH production.'
