caption: 'Relationship between the Activated Methyl Cycle (AMC) and AI-2 production
  in bacteria. The AMC is responsible for the generation of the major methyl donor
  in the cell, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), and the recycling of methionine by detoxification
  of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). LuxS takes part in this cycle by salvaging the
  homocysteine moiety from the cycle intermediate S-ribosyl-homocysteine (SRH). The
  alternative homocysteine-regeneration pathway using SAH hydrolase, which is employed
  by Alphaproteobacteria, is portrayed by the dashed arrow. As a by-product of the
  LuxS-catalyzed reaction, the direct AI-2 precursor 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentadione
  (DPD) is formed. DPD undergoes further reactions to form distinct biologically active
  signal molecules generically termed AI-2. (2S,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuryl
  borate (S-THMF-borate), the AI-2 signal of Vibrionaceae, is produced without the
  help on any known enzyme in the presence of boric acid (lower pathway), whereas
  in other bacteria (e.g., S. Typhimurium) DPD rearranges spontaneously to form (2R,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran
  (R-THMF) as AI-2 signal (upper pathway). CH3-THPG: N5-methyltetrahydropteroryl glutamate,
  CH3-THF: N5-methyltetrahydrofolate.'
