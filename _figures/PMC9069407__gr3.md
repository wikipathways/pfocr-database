caption: The regulation of PD-L1 in tumor microenviroment and the dynamic cellular
  distribution. In tumor microenviroment, there are lots of reported factors, such
  as IFNγ, IFNα, IFNβ, IL-17, IL-4, IL-27, IL-6, Fibronectin, Vironectin and the stiffness,
  that can induce the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 via different mechanism at different
  levels. Expressed PD-L1 and PD-L2 resident on membrane to inactivate T cells locally.
  The membrane PD-L1 can translocate to nucleus through HIP1R/KPNA2/KPNB1 pathway.
  Nuclear PD-L1 is acetylated and translocates to membrane via exportin. Intracellular
  PD-L1 can secrete to tumor microenviroment or even long distance via exosome. Unlike
  the membrane resident PD-L1 inactivates T cells locally, the exosome-containing
  PD-L1 can systematically inactivate T cell function. The protein stability of PD-L1
  was regulated by CMTM6 or CMTM4 by blocking SPOP- and β-TrCP-mediated degradation.
  However, in low energy condition, the activated AMPK can phosphorylate PD-L1 and
  disrupt the interaction between PD-L1 and CMTM4. Thus, the tumor microenviroment
  can substantially affects the distribution and function of PD-L1 not only locally
  but also systematically.
