caption: Infection with KSHV leads to a population of latently-infected cells with
  varying levels of K13 expression. Cells with low K13 expression are eliminated by
  apoptosis and lytic replication, while those with intermediate to high expression
  are stimulated to proliferate through the stimulatory effect of the NF-κB pathway
  on cell cycle and through the secretion of growth-promoting cytokines (e.g. hIL6).
  Elevated K13 expression also blocks the production of key viral proteins needed
  for lytic replication, thereby protecting cells from lytic replication-induced cell
  death. However, K13 has a permissive effect on RTA-induced vIL6 production and cooperates
  with it to stimulate hIL6 secretion further, thereby dysregulating the lytic gene
  expression program. The dysregulated expression of viral and cellular genes leads
  to further deregulation of signaling pathways controlling cellular survival, proliferation,
  immune response, and angiogenesis, initially leading to polyclonal expansion and,
  subsequently, through the accumulation of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations,
  to monoclonal cellular proliferation. Increased K13 expression, either alone or
  in combination with other viral (e.g. vCyclin, LANA-1, vGPCR and K1) and cellular
  proteins (e.g. proinflammatory cytokines) may lead to dysregulated expression of
  additional viral and cellular proteins in a cell-type and context-dependent manner,
  which may contribute to the pathogenesis of different cancers associated with KSHV
  infection. It is conceivable that acquisition of secondary genetic and epigenetic
  changes in the later stages of the disease may reduce or obviate the need for continuous
  K13 expression and NF-κB activity in some cases (not depicted).
