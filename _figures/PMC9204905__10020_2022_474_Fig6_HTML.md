caption: Network analysis of TMEM240 involved in estrone and estradiol metabolism.
  MetaCore Metabolic Networks (Endogenous) analysis found that TMEM240 was involved
  in the metabolic networks of steroid, estrone, and estradiol metabolism (A). TMEM240,
  which is involved in estradiol metabolism, was identified with MetaCore Pathway
  Maps (B). RNA-seq indicated decreases in CYP2B6, CYP11B1, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4,
  CYP2E1, HSD17B3, SULT2A1, SULT1B1, and UGT2A1 mRNA expression and increases in CYP2C19,
  CYP3A5, CYP3A7, SULT1E1, UGT1A4, and UGT2B7 mRNA expression under TMEM240 overexpression
  compared to the vector control. The enzymes are responsible for Androstenedione,
  Estrone, Estradiol, and Estriol metabolism processes
