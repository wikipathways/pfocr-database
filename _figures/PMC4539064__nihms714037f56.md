caption: Broggini further developed their carboamination and microwave-assisted hydroamination
  work using allenamides 192 that contains an indolyl unit (). Using 192, Styryl-substituted
  indoloimidazoles derivatives 194 were synthesized through the intermediacy of palladium
  π-allyl complex 193 in which the trapping exclusively occurred at the internal allenic
  carbon by the indole nitrogen. In the presence of CO, this cyclization cascade could
  afford indoloimidazoles 199. In addition, the authors found that the use of microwave
  was crucial in dictating the hydroamination pathway of 192. In particular, under
  the microwave activation, oxidative addition of the indolyl NH bond took place to
  give the Pd(II)-complex 195. A subsequent hydride transfer or hydro-palladation
  would lead to the palladium π-allyl intermediate 196 and streamline the reaction
  pathway toward vinyl indoloimidazoles 197.
