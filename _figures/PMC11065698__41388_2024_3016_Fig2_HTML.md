caption: A Both, 5-LO-derived lipid mediators (canonical pathway) as well as non-canonical
  functions of the enzyme can influence the gene expression in cancer cells. In the
  canonical pathway, oxylipins mediate their effects via receptor interaction and
  the subsequent activation of signaling pathways that lead to the regulation of transcription.
  The non-canonical functions include on the one hand, the influence of 5-LO on miRNA
  processing by Dicer which then leads to an altered cellular miRNA profile and consequently
  to a regulation of gene expression. On the other hand, 5-LO can act as STRaND (shuttling
  transcriptional regulator and non-DNA binding) in the SMaRT (Sensing external signal,
  acting as messenger and regulating transcription) signaling pathway. Here, the enzyme
  interacts with transcription factors and shuttles them into the nucleus to regulate
  transcription. B Regulation of 5-LO expression by miRNAs and vice versa
