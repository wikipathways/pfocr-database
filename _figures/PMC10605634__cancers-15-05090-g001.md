caption: 'Overview of tumor intrinsic factors related to immune evasion and ICI resistance.
  (A) WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway: the loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC) gene leads to increased β-catenin levels and activation of the WNT signaling
  pathway, which subsequently results in altered T-cell responses, a significant decrease
  in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor proliferation; (B) Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)
  signaling: IFN-γ facilitates tumor cell apoptosis and enhances the expression of
  the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and programmed cell death ligand
  1 (PD-L1) through the action of Janus Kinases (JAKs). The latter is essential for
  IFN-γ signaling, and mutations in JAK can lead to reduced tumor cell apoptosis in
  response to IFN-γ, the diminished expression of MHC-I, and T-cell exhaustion due
  to PD-L1 overexpression; (C) Antigen-presenting machinery (APM): (1) intra-tumor
  mechanisms such as mutations, loss of heterozygosis (LOS), or deletions in the β2M
  gene, as well as in the HLA-A, -B, and -C genes, trigger the loss of MHC-I. (2)
  Likewise, the improper assembling of β2M and alpha chains inside the endoplasmic
  reticulum lead to the unsuccessful expression of MHC-I. (3) In those situations,
  MHC-I-deficient tumor cells are not recognized by CD8+ T cells. (4) This results
  in an escape from immunological recognition. (5) This opens the way for proliferation
  and migration to different tissues; (D) Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β):
  Mutations in either the TGF-β receptor or its downstream target, SMAD4, can result
  in a surge of TGF-β levels. Elevated levels of TGF-β could lead to the exhaustion
  of T cells and induce resistance to ICI treatment (created with BioRender.com).'
