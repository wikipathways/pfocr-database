caption: 'Glucose and fructose metabolism in P. putida. The scheme summarizes the
  network of reactions in cells growing on either sugar as the sole carbon source.
  The upper metabolic domain comprises the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  (EMP) glycolytic route and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP, represented as a
  cycle). The lower metabolic domain encompasses the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate
  (PEP-Pyr-OAA) node, including the pyruvate shunt and the TCA cycle. The metabolites
  involved in each of the corresponding transformations are indicated: G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; F1P, fructose 1-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  2K6PG, 2-keto-6-phosphogluconate; 2K3D6P, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate; GA3P,

  Pyr, pyruvate; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; OAA, oxaloacetate; 2-OX, 2-oxoglutarate. The enzymes
  that catalyze each of the transformations are shown with the corresponding ORF code
