caption: A scheme of testing heterologous proteins for amyloidogenicity in yeast.
  Yeast strain contains an ade1-14 (UGA) reporter, allowing the detection of the Sup35
  prion ([PSI+]) due to translational readthrough. (a) Overexpression of Sup35 PrD
  alone or in fusion to non-amyloidogenic protein (PrD-NAP) does not lead to efficient
  nucleation of the [PSI+] prion in the [pin−] cells yeast lacking any known pre-existing
  prions. Respectively, there is no growth on the medium lacking adenine, and red
  color is detected on complete (YPD) medium due to the accumulation and polymerization
  of an intermediate in the adenine biosynthetic pathway. (b) An amyloidogenic protein
  (AP) attached to Sup35 PrD forms an amyloid aggregate in yeast, thus bringing together
  the Sup35 PrD regions and facilitating the conversion of these regions into a cross-β
  nucleus. Complete Sup35 protein, present in the same cell, is then immobilized into
  such a nucleus via the PrD-PrD interaction, and converted into a prion form, thus
  producing the [PSI+] prion and allowing for a phenotypic detection. Respectively,
  there is growth on the medium lacking adenine, and a whitish color is detected on
  YPD medium.
