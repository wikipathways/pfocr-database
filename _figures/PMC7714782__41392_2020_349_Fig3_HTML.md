caption: The metabolism of methionine in viral infections of hepatitis B and C. The
  hepatic polyamine synthesis and transsulfuration pathway activities are impaired
  in virus infection. Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a sulfur-containing adenine nucleoside
  produced from SAM during the synthesis of polyamines, including spermine and spermidine.
  The level of MTA significantly decreases during the late stage of HCV infection
  in cells. Moreover, Met is particularly susceptible to elevated ROS levels. Upon
  reacting to ROS, protein-bound Met is readily oxidized to form methionine sulfoxide
  (Met-SO). The increased Met-SO level and Met-SO/Met ratio indicate increased oxidative
  stress subsequent to decrease liver function. Furthermore, the STAT-1 genes showed
  significant difference between HBV and HCV. Met methionine, Met-SO methionine sulfoxide,
  HBx the X protein of HBV, ISG interferon-stimulated gene, PP2A protein phosphatase
  2A, PRMT1 protein arginine methyltransferase 1, PIAS protein inhibitor of activated
  STATs
