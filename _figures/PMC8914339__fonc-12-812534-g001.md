caption: The metabolism of iron. (A) Ferric iron (Fe3+) coupled with transferrin and
  then was imported into intercellular circumstance by TfR1. Transferrin was recycled
  and exported out of the cell, which can be blocked by HSPB1. Fe3+ is reduced and
  forms reduced iron (Fe2+) by DMT1 in the endosome, and Fe2+ is transported into
  the cytoplasm. Excess Fe2+ is stocked in the ferritin to avoid iron overload. The
  stocked Fe2+ can be released from ferritin by NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. Besides,
  Fe2+ is exported out of the cell and is oxidized by FPN. (B) DOX induces ferroptosis.
  The heart-exported DOX activates the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, and transcription factor
  Nrf2 activates downstream protein Hmox1 which oxidizes heme and release of iron
  which results in ferroptosis.
