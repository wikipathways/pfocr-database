caption: The 1830 up-regulated mRNA set are significantly enriched by mRNA coding
  for proteins involved in “dopamine neurotransmitter release cycle” pathway. The
  network was generated by “find significant pathway” function in GeneSpring GX v11
  (p<0.05). Connections were based on known interactions between these proteins within
  the Reactome database. The biological relationship between two proteins is represented
  as a line (an edge). The proteins with a blue halo belong to the 1830 mRNA up-regulated
  set in brain vs stem cells. Red and blue colored squares indicate genes with up-
  and down-regulated expression, respectively. The intensity of the colors highlights
  the fold change (FC) in brain vs stem cells samples. The nature of the relationships
  between the proteins are shown in legend. SNAP25, synaptosomal-assiociated protein
  25; RIMS1, regulating synaptic membrane 1; RAB3A, RAB3A interacting protein; SYT1,
  synaptotagmin; CPLX1, complexin 1; STXBP1, syntaxin binding protein 1.
