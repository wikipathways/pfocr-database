caption: Nitrogen metabolism pathway analysis of the tested cultivars. A Nitrogen
  metabolism pathway in ZM366; B Nitrogen metabolism pathway in JD8; C Nitrogen metabolism
  pathway in hybrid cultivar. The green pattern indicating all the DEGs mapped to
  the step were down-regulated. The red pattern indicating all the DEGs mapped to
  the step were up-regulated. The blue indicating the DEGs mapped to this step were
  either up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs
