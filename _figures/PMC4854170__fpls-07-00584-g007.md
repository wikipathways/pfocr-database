caption: Metabolic pathway maps of changes in metabolite concentration induced by
  endophyte colonization in timothy shoots (A) and roots (B) after 4 weeks (H1) and
  8 weeks (H2) under WW or DRY conditions. Variable relative concentrations (increased,
  decreased or no change in response to endophytes) are coded using a color based
  on the means of scaled and centered OPLS regression coefficients from 4 biological
  replications. Dashed arrows symbolize a multistep and solid arrows a one-step reactions
  (for abbreviations consult the legend of Figure ).
