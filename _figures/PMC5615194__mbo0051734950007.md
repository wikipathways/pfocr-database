caption: Rickettsia metabolic network reconstruction highlights reductive genome evolution
  and addiction to host cell metabolites. The network focuses on the biosynthesis
  pathways discussed in the text. For brevity, pathways for most amino acids are not
  shown. Red stars indicate six pathway holes (see ). GLY, glycolysis; MEP/DOXP, nonmevalonate
  terpenoid biosynthesis; THF, 5,6,7,8-THF; GSH, glutathione. (A) Theoretical Rickettsia
  metabolic network in the absence of imported metabolites. Rickettsia metabolic pathways
  are supplemented with typical Gram-negative biosynthetic pathways to create a complete
  metabolic network. (B) Reconstructed Rickettsia metabolic network, including imported
  metabolites. Pathways removed from panel A have been purged from Rickettsia genomes
  throughout evolution, a consequence of pilfering of metabolites from the eukaryotic
  host. Red ellipses, metabolites known to be imported by Rickettsia species; yellow
  ellipses, metabolites predicted to be imported on the basis of metabolic network
  reconstruction. The import of S-adenosyl-l-methionine, phosphorylcholine, and the
  majority of amino acids is not included in the reconstruction. Pathway lines are
  highlighted in red to indicate cofactors that are synthesized directly from imported
  metabolites. Additionally, if the cofactor is directly imported from the host, the
  pathway line is yellow. The network is based on a phylogenomics analyses of 84 Rickettsia
  genomes (see ).
