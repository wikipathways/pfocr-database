caption: Possible molecular pathways of cisplatin, oxaliplatin and paclitaxel on oxidative
  stress-dependent TRPA1 and TRPV4 activation in the DRG neurons. Cysteine groups
  are main target of oxidative stress in cellular membranes and membrane of TRPA1
  has rich content of cysteine groups (Takahashi et al., ). TRPA1 and TRPV4 are oxidative
  stress-sensitive Ca2+-permeable channels. The cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel
  can results in augmented TRPA1 and TRPV4, leading to Ca2+ influx through direct
  channel activation or excessive production of oxidative stress and induction of
  apoptosis through depolarization of mitochondrial membranes. Overload Ca2+ influxes
  induce pain through substance P (SP) and excitatory amino acid production. Glutathione
  (GSH) is synthetized from cysteine redox cycle. Protective role of GSH on TRPA1
  and TRPV4 through oxaliplatin and paclitaxel-induced oxidative stress in DRG neuron
  was reported (Materazzi et al., ). The molecular pathway may be a cause of chemotherapy-induced
  peripheral pain and this subject warrants further investigation.
