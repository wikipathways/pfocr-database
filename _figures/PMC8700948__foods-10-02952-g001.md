caption: 'Schematic view of the molecular pathways of ferroptosis regulation. Three
  main metabolic pathways are GSH/GPX4 pathway, lipid peroxidation and iron metabolism
  pathways. Ferroptosis is initiated by the suppression of system Xc− and depletion
  of GSH, or inhibition of GPX4, which results in cell death. Lipid ROS is in charge
  of the process of ferroptosis. The peroxidation of PUFAs is identified as a vital
  contributor. Excess iron is the basis for ferroptosis execution. In addition, the
  latest researches have revealed that the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway with its unique
  mechanistic properties engages in ferroptosis. AA: Arachidonic acid, ACSL4: Acyl-CoA
