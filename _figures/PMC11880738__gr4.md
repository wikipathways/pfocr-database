caption: The potential use of copper chelators and copper ionophores/copper-containing
  nanodrugs in melanoma cells with distinct phenotypes, including those induced by
  inhibitors of mutated BRAF (BRAFi) and MEK (MEKi). BRAFi/MEKi-untreated melanoma
  cells with BRAF mutations (left panel) frequently exhibit a glycolytic phenotype
  resulting from the inhibition of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
  (MITF)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) axis.
  The early response to BRAFi/MEKi, which is associated with the inhibition of MEK/ERK
  phosphorylation, enables the upregulation of the level and activity of MITF (middle
  panel). This is followed by the induction of specific melanoma phenotypes, e.g.,
  a differentiation phenotype and the upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  After the development of resistance to BRAFi/MEKi, which is frequently associated
  with reactivation or overactivation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, distinct
  melanoma phenotypes can be acquired, including either differentiation or dedifferentiation
  phenotypes along with distinct metabolic states (right panel). All of these states
  can be targeted by distinct copper-modulating drugs
