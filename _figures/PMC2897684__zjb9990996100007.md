caption: 'UDP-GlcNAc biosynthetic pathway from Fru-6-P in bacteria and eukaryotes.
  The previously detected biosynthetic pathway of UDP-GlcNAc from Fru-6-P is shown.
  The common pathway is shown by a bold line, and the steps specific to bacteria and
  eukaryotes are shown by normal lines. The enzymes abbreviated by roman numerals
  are as follows: (I), glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; (II), phosphoglucosamine
  mutase; (III), GlcN-1-P acetyltransferase; (IV), GlcN-6-P acetyltransferase; (V),
  phosphoacetylglcosamine mutase; and (VI), GlcNAc-1-P UTase.'
