caption: Interplay between ER stress, mitochondrial stress and parkin. ER stress can
  induce mitochondrial damage, such as alterations in mitochondrial morphology and
  bioenergetics. Conversely, mitochondrial stress can induce ER stress, reflected
  by the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Parkin is transcriptionally
  upregulated in response to both mitochondrial and ER stress by ATF4, a transcription
  factor of the UPR. The stress-induced transcriptional upregulation of parkin is
  antagonized by c-Jun, which is activated by the JNK pathway. Increased expression
  of parkin under stress conditions protects cells from stress-induced cell death,
  explaining the high vulnerability of parkin-deficient cells to cellular stress
