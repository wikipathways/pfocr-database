caption: 'Differentially expressed artemisinin and other terpenoid biosynthetic pathway
  genes of A. annua during abiotic stresses. Expression patterns of artemisinin and
  other terpenoid biosynthetic pathway genes were represented based on average log2fold
  change values for the genes showing differential expression (calculated from transcripts
  with log2fold change >+1 or <−1). Upward arrows indicate up-regulation, downward
  arrows indicate down regulation and stars indicate neutral regulation or genes not
  identified. Graph represents validation of the expression pattern of five differentially
  expressed genes by RT-qPCR (data was analyzed by three independent repeats and standard
  deviations were shown with error bars). Color coding: blue for cold, green for salt,
  red for drought and purple for water-logging stress. Heat maps demonstrate the log2fold
  change values of all differentially expressed transcripts corresponding to a particular
  gene. Abbreviations used: CD,cold; SA,salinity; SD,drought; SW, water-logging; HMG-CoA,
