caption: Ribosomal proteins (RP-both the large subunit and small subunits) form a
  complex with p53 and MDM2 to inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and stabilization
  of p53. ARF and PML sequester the MDM2 in the nucleolus, inhibiting MDM2 from binding
  and degrading p53. CK1 phosphorylates p53 at Thr18 in response to stress and DNA
  damage and, along with p53, localizes to the PML nuclear bodies. MDMX forms heteroligomers
  with MDM2 and induces p53 degradation. PA28γ protein interacts with both MDM2 and
  p53 proteins and promotes the MDM2-p53 interaction, leading to enhanced MDM2-mediated
  p53 ubiquitination and degradation. RYBP interacts with MDM2 to decrease MDM2-mediated
  p53 ubiquitination while RNF2 promotes p53 degradation. HIPK2, tumor suppressor
  (Ts) protein phosphorylates MDM2, promoting its proteasomal degradation while the
  Rb Ts forms a ternary complex with p53 and MDM2.
