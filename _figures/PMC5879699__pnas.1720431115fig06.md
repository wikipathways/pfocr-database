caption: Nucleic acid induced innate immune pathways and their inhibition by CDK inhibitor
  (CDKi). Recognition of PAMPs by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) triggers innate
  immune signaling pathways that activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3,
  which mediate type I IFN production. IFN is released from the cell, interacts with
  its receptor on the cell surface and activates receptor-associated JAKs. JAKs in
  turn phosphorylate and activate the STAT family of transcription factors, which
  stimulate ISG production. In the presence of CDK inhibitors, nucleic acid recognition
  occurs normally, IRF3 is activated and IFN-β mRNA is synthesized, but the production
  of IFN-β protein is blocked at the stage of translation. Lack of IFN production
  prevents receptor signaling, JAK/STAT pathway activation and ISG mRNA induction.
