caption: Schematic representation of relevant JAK-STAT signaling pathways in the pathogenesis
  of Spondyloarthritis. Binding of the different Interleukins (IL) to their specific
  receptor subunits on different cell populations, e.g. T cells, innate lymphoid cells
  (ILC) or effector cells such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts or keratinocytes leads
  to activation of a specific JAK-STAT pathway. The different isoforms of JAK are
  coupled to specific receptor/cytokine pairs and allow for a targeted inhibition
  with a specific JAKinib. However, overlap exists allowing for unintended side effects
  or accumulative effects. JAK1-specific inhibitors for example affect signaling by
  IL-6, IL-21, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-22 targeting most of the relevant immune and effector
  cell populations in SpA pathogenesis.
