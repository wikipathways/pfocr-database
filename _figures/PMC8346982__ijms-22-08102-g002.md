caption: Overview of HA metabolism and interaction with membrane receptors. Synthesis
  of HA by HAS2, the main synthetic enzyme in cancer cells, is increased by inflammatory
  agents, such as TNFα, via the NF-κB signaling pathway. Induction of HAS2 also occurs
  due to various growth factors and the secreted protein c10orf118 in a not yet fully
  described mechanism. Pharmacological agents, such as 4-MU, inhibit HA synthesis
  and downregulate HAS2. A binding to HYAL2 and CD44 and endocytosis lead to the degradation
  of HMWHA; HYAL2 cuts HMWHA into fragments (LMWHA) at the plasma membrane which,
  in turn, are internalized into the cell via endocytosis and further degraded by
  HYAL1 in lysosomes. The produced sugars, GlcNAc and GlcA, may be recycled in cell
  energy metabolism, i.e., glycolysis, or control HAS2-AS1 expression via NF-κB. HAS2-AS1
  is also regulated by hypoxia via HIF-1α. Tumor cells are secreted in tumor microenvironment
  extracellular vesicles that contain HA, HAS3, and CD44 that can be captured by target
  cells. The HA of the tumor microenvironment can bind to different cell membrane
  receptors. The HA–TLR-4 complex signals the NF-κB pathway, supporting cell proliferation,
  whereas HA-CD44 and HA-RHAMM interact with either TGFβRI and PDGFR, promoting EMT
  and cell survival and metastasis.
