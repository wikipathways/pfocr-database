caption: 'The fundamental ferroptosis-related intracellular pathways and mitochondrial
  regulation. Metabolic pathways for lipids: Xc mediates the exchange of cystine and
  Glu, while cystine stimulates GSH synthesis. Gln is converted to Glu, which is crucial
  for CDI ferroptosis, with the assistance of GIS2 and the action of GPT and GDT.
  ACSL4 and LPCAT 3 esterify PUFA to PE, preparing for subsequent peroxidation reactions
  catalyzed by LOX or POR enzymes or mediated by cellular free iron via the Fenton
  reaction. Iron metabolic pathway: Iron binds to TF, enters the cell via TfR1, and
  is then released into the LIP in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the Fenton
  reaction, producing ROS and promoting ferroptosis. ROS can also trigger the secretion
  of IL-1 and IL-18 via inflammasome signaling, contributing to inflammation. ETC
  stimulates ATP synthesis via PCr and activates AMPK, which inhibits ACC and decreases
  PUFA synthesis. Iron can enter the mitochondria through VDAC2/3, Mfrn1/2 or via
  the Fenton reaction, resulting in ferroptosis. Mitochondrial iron can also enter
  the ISC assembly machinery, which is responsible for the maturation of all cellular
  (Fe-S) clusters. NEET iron-sulfur proteins transfer their 2Fe-2S clusters to the
  apolipoprotein receptor proteins and the CIA system. FtMt is involved in mitochondrial
  iron storage. BID induces ferroptosis by activating BAX and BAK And CISD1 modulates
  iron export in mitochondria. Abbreviations: AOA, amino-oxyacetic acid; ACSF2, acyl-CoA
