caption: Effects of LMNA expression levels on common signaling pathways in tumor cells.
  LMNA perturbs different signaling pathways in tumors and affects various physiological
  functions of tumor cells. Low expression of LMNA in tumors can activate the p53
  signaling pathway and inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. High expression
  of LMNA in tumors, can activate the YAP, EMT and PI3K signaling pathways, thus promoting
  the invasion, migration and proliferation of tumor cells. YAP, Yes-associated protein;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
