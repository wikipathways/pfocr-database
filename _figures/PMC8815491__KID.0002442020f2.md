caption: Mitochondrial stress responses are deeply involved in kidney disease progression.
  (A) Energy metabolism alterations of proximal tubules in CKD are shown. Defective
  fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction are observed in fibrotic kidneys,
  leading to ATP shortage. (B) Energy metabolism alterations of proximal tubules in
  the early stage of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are shown. Mitochondrial respiration
  (mainly fueled by fatty acids and amino acids) is forcibly activated to meet the
  energy demand for glucose reabsorption in the hyperglycemic state, which increases
  oxygen consumption and results in renal hypoxia. Mitochondrial respiration in the
  hypoxic state produces a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). (C) The
  imbalance in mitochondrial fission and fusion is observed in DKD. The increase in
  mitochondrial fission results in ROS overproduction. (D) Mitochondrial defects,
  including the loss of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in proximal tubular
  cells, induce translocation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol, which activates
  the innate immune pathway, cGAS-STING. This inflammatory response is observed both
  in AKI and CKD. O2, oxygen.
