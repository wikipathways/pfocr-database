caption: Incomplete NET degradation leads to hypercoagulation. (1) Incomplete NET
  degradation causes macrophage and dendritic cells (DCs) to present NET components
  to CD4 + T cells. (2) The T cells release IL-21 inducing differentiation of B cells
  into plasma cells to induce autoantibody production. (3) Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
  antibodies (ANCAs) can form circulating immune complex (CIC). (4) ANCAs and CIC
  activate neutrophils through FcɣR and complement receptor binding. Hyperactivation
  of neutrophils by autoantibodies produces Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), cytokines
  storms, lytic enzymes, and NET. (5) NETosis releases decondensation of chromatin
  constructed from unwound neutrophil DNA and histones coated with neutrophil enzymes
  such as neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3).
  (6) Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) attracts platelets and histones activate them leading
  to the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. (7) NE cleaves anticoagulant which contributes
  to more coagulation. (8) CIC can trigger a fibrotic response from DCs and macrophages.
  (9) Macrophages carry inactive tissue factors which will be activated by pyroptosis,
  specifically by protein disulfide isomerase. Pyroptosis results in microvesicles
  that contain active tissue factors that lead to the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
  (10) The vicious cycle of uncontrolled neutrophils activation and incomplete net
  degradation causes hypercoagulation through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Created
