caption: Proposed pathways that regulate spine density and that are affected by Aβ
  oligomers, based on the results of this study. Ca influx through synaptic NMDARs
  can activate at least two pathways that regulate spine density. On the left side,
  high levels of Ca accumulation, such as those reached during tetanic or suprathreshold
  synaptic stimulation, induce LTP via a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
  II (CAMKII)-dependent pathway (for review, see ). LTP-inducing stimuli also trigger
  enlargement of dendritic spines and growth of new spines in a NMDAR- and CAMKII-dependent
  manner (; ; ; ; ). Introduction of active CAMKII in neurons is sufficient to induce
  new spine growth (). In the right side pathway, low levels of Ca accumulation, such
  as those reached during low-frequency subthreshold stimulation, induce LTD through
  a calcineurin-dependent pathway (for review, see ). LTD-inducing stimuli also lead
  to spine shrinkage via an NMDAR/calcineurin/cofilin-dependent pathway and spine
  retraction through an NMDAR-dependent pathway (; ). The calcineurin and cofilin
  dependence of LTD-associated spine retraction have not been examined. In this model,
  full block of NMDARs interrupts both pathways leading to no net spine loss. Partial
  block of NMDARs favors activation of the right side pathway, LTD induction, and
  loss of spines. In addition, multiple factors (‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ and ‘D’) act independently
  of NMDARs, CAMKII, and calcineurin to regulate cofilin and spine density. We find
  that soluble Aβ oligomers decrease spine density in an NMDAR/calcineurin/cofilin-dependent
  manner, consistent with activation of the pathway shown on the right. Aβ oligomers
  reduce NMDAR-dependent Ca transients, possibly shifting stimuli that normally activate
  the left pathway to instead activate those on the right. This might occur through
  direct interaction of Aβ with NMDARs or by first activating unknown factors (‘X’)
  that may lead to inhibition of NMDAR-mediated synaptic Ca influx. Aβ may also facilitate
  NMDAR-dependent activation of calcineurin via additional pathways. The blue lines
  indicate levels at which soluble Aβ oligomers may modulate the pathway, and the
  red lines indicate elements of the pathway tested in this study.
