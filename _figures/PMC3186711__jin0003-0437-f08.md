caption: A model of the role of TLR4 signaling pathways in regulating TNF-α expression.
  Mal/MyD88-dependent signals are required for the transcriptional upregulation of
  the TNF-α gene. In addition to a minor contribution to transcription of the TNF-α
  gene (dashed arrow), signals transduced via the TRAM/TRIF pathway are involved in
  promoting the translation of the TNF-α mRNA, probably by activating the MK2 kinase
  and thus influencing regulatory proteins that interact with cis-acting elements
  in the 3′ UTR outside the minimal 34 nucleotide ARE.
