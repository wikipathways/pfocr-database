caption: The IRE1/XBP1 pathway has been shown to regulate autophagy both through direct
  transcriptional regulation of autophagic genes downstream of XBP1s and indirectly
  through other signaling molecules, including FOXO1 and JNK. IRE1 can promote JNK
  signaling through TRAF2-mediated pathways similar to the apoptosis machinery and
  thus activate BCL1/2 to promote autophagy. XBP1s can also activate autophagy either
  by inhibiting FOXO1 signaling, which releases its inhibitory effect on autophagy,
  or by promoting conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II.
