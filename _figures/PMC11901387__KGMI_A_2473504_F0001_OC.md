caption: The effect of the microbiota on drug resistance in HCC. The intestinal microbiota
  can induce drug resistance by inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis through JAK1/AKT/STAT3
  signaling, through TLR4/MyD88-induced autophagy, by producing toxins to upregulate
  multidrug resistance transporters, and through the production of ROS and cytokines
  that damage DNA in tumor cells. In terms of suppressing chemoresistance, the intestinal
  microbiota can increase drug carrier sensitivity via the FOXO3-FOXM1 axis. In terms
  of promoting immunotherapy resistance, the intestinal microbiota can upregulate
  EGFR and induce drug resistance by promoting PD-L1 transcription and expression
  through the RAS pathway and by inhibiting the activation of dendritic cells and
  T cells via NLRP3/ASC. In terms of suppressing immunotherapy resistance, the intestinal
  microbiota can produce several metabolites that can activate the mTOR signaling
  pathway to promote the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by T cells and inhibit drug
  resistance via AhR/IL-22. Some metabolites can also directly promote TGF-β and IL-10
  production to suppress drug resistance
