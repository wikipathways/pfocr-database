caption: Suggested role of mTORC1-dependent signaling pathway in the development of
  neurons and its implication in aberrant development of PFC in schizophrenia. (A)
  Neurotransmitters, growth factors, nutrients, and other environmental inputs coordinately
  activate mTORC1 leading to a correct normal neuronal development. Hypofunction of
  mTORC1 induces a dysregulation of the neuronal development that may be involved
  in the development of psychiatric disorders. (B) The canonical Akt/mTORC1/S6 pathway.
  The two main targets of mTORC1, S6K, and 4E-BP1, are involved in the translational
  machinery for protein synthesis. Once active, S6K regulates the activity of the
  ribosomal protein S6 by phosphorylating it at different sites. The phosphorylation
  of S6 controls translation and regulates protein synthesis in the central nervous
  system (CNS).
