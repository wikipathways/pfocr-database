caption: A snapshot of some of the transcriptome changes in S. mutans when co-cultured
  with C. albicans. Overall, the data reveal that the presence of C. albicans enhances
  sugar metabolism and metabolic fitness, and alters competence gene expression in
  S. mutans. (A) Up-regulation of the scrA gene encoding a high-affinity sucrose PTS
  permease (EIIScr) and possibly in concert with the product of the pttB gene encoding
  the trehalose-PTS (EIITre) facilitates internalization of sucrose as sucrose-6-phosphate,
  with the glucose moiety carrying the phosphate group. Glucose-6-phosphate and fructose
  are produced via the action of ScrB, and ScrK used ATP to convert the fructose to
  fructose-6-phosphate. Both of these phosphohexoses can enter the glycolytic pathway.
  When S. mutans is growing in the presence of C. albicans, pyruvate metabolism can
  be affected by the availability of glycolytic intermediates. (B) The presence of
  C. albicans also appears to up-regulate the production of the CiaRH two component
  signal transduction system (TCSTS), which modulates acid tolerance, sucrose-dependent
  adherence and biofilm formation in S. mutans. (C) Another signaling system in S.
  mutans, the CSP-ComDE pathway, is affected by C. albicans. ComC (▲) is secreted
  and processed by ComAB to produce CSP (see text for more detail) and this peptide
  is then detected by the ComDE TCSTS. ComE directly activates bacteriocin production
  and CSP indirectly stimulates the development of genetic competence, as well as
  influencing cell. Indeed, changes of CSP-comDE pathway via down-regulation of comC
  can lead to down-regulation of downstream bacteriocin genes (e.g., nlmAB) and decreases
  in expression of late competence genes (comYABCD). Red letters indicate up-regulated
  genes, blue letters show down-regulated genes.
