caption: m6A modulators involved in cardiovascular disease and bioprocess. METTL3-mediated
  m6A modification is involved in cardiac hypertrophy by affecting kinase-regulated
  signaling pathway. Upregulated METTL3 and increased expression of paracrine factors,
  including VEGF, HGF, TGF-β, GM-CSF, bFGF and SDF-1 were found in ADSCs undergoing
  VSMC differentiation induction. The upregulation of METTL3 promoted the association
  of RNA binding protein HNRNPD with TFEB pre-mRNA and decreased TFEB expression,
  eventually impaired autophagic flux and enhancing apoptosis in ischemic heart disease.
  FTO mediated decreased expression of Calm1 and Serca2a are responsible for decreased
  heart contraction function and heart failure. Both elevated METTL14 and FTO are
  associated with inflammatory infiltration and neovascularization in abdominal aortic
  aneurysm. In addition, METTL3 mediated miR-34a maturation from pre-miR-34a, and
  then miR-34a negatively regulated the expression of SIRT1. m6A-modified Klotho mRNA
  plays a crucial role in vascular calcification. TPNS alleviated arterial restenosis
  through the downregulation of m6A methylation of p16. Decreased m6A modified circ
  Xpo6 and circ Tmtc3 are found in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Elevated METTL3,
  decreased FTO and ALKBH5 are involved in the development of hyperlipidemia resulted
  from LPS. Curcumin exerts a protective effect on LPS induced abnormal lipid metabolism.
  m6A associated plays a role in blood pressure, hyperlipidemia and coronary artery
  disease.
