caption: In Vino Veritas. Mechanism of Action of Resveratrol. Resveratrol Stimulates
  the Sirt1-PGC-1α Pathway. Resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity in mice by stimulating
  mitochondrial function via the Sirt1-PGC-1α pathway. Under basal conditions PGC-1α
  is heavily acetylated and inactivated by GCN5. Elevations in cellular NAD+ during
  fasting and in response to exercise trigger the Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of
  PGC-1α. Deacetylated PGC-1α stimulates genes for oxidative phosphorylation in part
  by functioning as a coactivator for nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). Resveratrol
  increases Sirt1 activation under high-fat diet conditions by increasing the affinity
  of Sirt1 for NAD+ and for acetylated PGC-1α. (Kos S, Montminy M. Cell 2006;127:1091–93.
