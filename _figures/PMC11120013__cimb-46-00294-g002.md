caption: CP-derived RONS promote wound healing by dissociating Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) to activate
  the antioxidant response element (ARE), rearranging cytoskeletal architecture to
  promote cell motility, recruiting inflammatory cells, and autocrine signalling to
  promote cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. The Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) pathway has been shown to potentiate Nrf2 activation, but the mechanisms are
  still unclear (indicated by “?”), while Akt decreases p53 expression to promote
  Nrf2. Keap1 activity may also go beyond the canonical function of inhibiting Nrf2,
  but these functions are greyed out to indicate the unexplored nature of these potential
  responses to CP
