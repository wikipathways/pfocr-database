caption: Schematic diagram of MANF inhibiting HCC. The nuclear import of p65 triggers
  the transcription of NF‐κB target genes. SUMO1 mediates MANF SUMOylation and nuclear
  import. SUMOylation of p65 recruits MANF to form a repressor complex to shut down
  NF‐κB signaling. As a result, the downstream genes of the NF‐κB signal pathway,
  such as Snail1 and TNF‐α, were inhibited. Subsequently, hepatocyte EMT and HCC were
  suppressed.
