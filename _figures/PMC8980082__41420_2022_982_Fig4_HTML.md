caption: Pyroptosis can be induced via the caspase-1-dependent canonical pathway and
  caspase-4,5 (for human)- or caspase-11 (for mouse)-mediated non-canonical pathway.
  In terms of the canonical pathway, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate the inflammasome sensors
  NLRP3, which then recruit the effector pro-caspase-1 with the aid of the adaptor
  protein ASC to assemble inflammasomes, leading to the conversion of pro-caspase-1
  into active caspase-1. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome requires the involvement
  of the TLR4-mediated NF-κB pathway, which promotes the expression of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1,
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 proteins. Activated caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD)
  and ultimately mediates pyroptosis. Besides, caspase-1 promotes the maturation of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 by cleaving their precursor proteins,
  which trigger wide-ranging inflammatory responses. In the non-canonical pathway,
  human caspase-4 and -5 or their murine homologue caspase-11 can be directly activated
  by binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cleave GSDMD with efficiency similar
  to that of caspase-1, thereby inducing cell pyroptosis. Oncogenic lncRNAs (red font,
  high expression in NSCLC) participate in lung cancer-associated pyroptosis by regulating
  pyroptosis-related proteins.
