caption: The enzymatic core metabolism of early life forms, modified from[74,179,182].
  Environmentally produced H2 from serpentinization could directly reduce CO2 made
  accessible by the Moon-forming impact in metal-catalyzed geochemical reactions under
  hydrothermal conditions. The transition to an enzymatically catalyzed protometabolism,
  shown here, involved a gradual decrease in dependency on vent conditions, whereby
  H2 became the electron donor for ferredoxin reduction catalyzed by hydrogenases,
  which employ flavin-based electron bifurcation in order to couple the endergonic
  reduction of ferredoxin with the exergonic reduction of a higher potential acceptor.[61,63–64]
  CO2 is fixed in the acetyl-CoA pathway, with ferredoxin as the electron donor in
  reactions of both the methyl and the carbonyl branch.[39] While the methyl branch
  is catalyzed by a series of enzymes that are non-homologous in bacteria and archaea,
  the carbonyl branch is catalyzed by the conserved bifunctional carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA
  synthase (CODH/ACS).[136,174,176,183] The product of the pathway, acetyl-CoA, is
  a high-energy thioester that can generate phosphoryl donors such as acetyl-phosphate,
  which has been proposed to be a primordial energy currency,[74,94] and ATP, via
  substrate-level phosphorylation. These reactions are catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase
  and acetate kinase, respectively.[184–185] In acetogens (bacteria) and methanogens
  (archaea) the reduction of CO2 via the acetyl-CoA pathway is furthermore coupled
  to the generation of an ion gradient and the harnessing of its electrochemical potential
  for ATP synthesis by an ATP synthase.[65,186–187] The acetyl-CoA produced in the
  acetyl-CoA pathway is partly used to generate building blocks. Pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase (PFOR) catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate,[165,177]
  which is then directed into gluconeogenesis[78,188–189] and the incomplete (linear)
  rTCA pathway,[178] generating central metabolic intermediates for further synthesis
  of amino acids, cofactors and nucleobases. Six reactions of the rTCA cycle have
  been shown to proceed non-enzymatically, catalyzed by transition metals, and three
  of them (the sequence from oxaloacetate to succinate in the linear rTCA) have been
  obtained with hydrogen as the reductant.[75,77] Other reports of non-enzymatic variants
  of the reactions in the figure are mentioned in the text and summarized in[182].
  Biological reductants other than Fd− (reduced ferredoxin) are indicated with [2H].
  Participation of FeS or FeNiS clusters in the enzymatic reactions is indicated.
