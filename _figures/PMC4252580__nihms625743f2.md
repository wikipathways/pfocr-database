caption: Cellular insulin and glucose delivery is dependent on insulin transport and
  diffusion from the intravascular compartment, through the interstitium (a) to the
  cell membrane where insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR) and glucose enters
  the cell via GLUT4. Insulin signaling is mediated by multiple pathways including
  IRS1, PI3K, and PDK1 which activate Akt (b). Akt and other pathways, e.g. Rac1,
  increase GLUT4 trafficking to the cell surface in part via actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.
  Glucose is taken into the cell and is converted to energy via oxidative metabolism
  or stored as glycogen for use in the future (d). Aldosterone and MR activation can
  affect multiple steps in the pathway by activating SGK1 or Src/MAPK/JNK pathways.
