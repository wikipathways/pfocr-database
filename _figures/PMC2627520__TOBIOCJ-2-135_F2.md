caption: Schema of the biochemical processes leading to the synthesis of natural chondroitin
  sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains and the hyperelongation of GAG chains elicited
  by multiple cell signaling pathways resulting from the action of growth factor such
  as PDGF and TGFβ. ChSy chondroitin synthase; ChPF chondroitin polymerizing factor.
  The scheme to the left shows the normal biosynthesis of a proteoglycan core protein
  which is new protein and therefore cycloheximide sensitive but is also subject,
  based on individual and specific core proteins, to up regulation by growth factors.
  Various combinations, at least pairs of polymerases (see Table ) add monosaccharides
  to the preformed tetrasaccharide linkage region on a serine residue on the core
  protein to produce the “natural” length glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain. To the right
  of the scheme it is indicated that growth factors can intervene to result in the
  production of longer, so called hyperelon-gated GAG chains and although this is
  cycloheximide sensitive (see text) and acutely requires new protein synthesis the
  site at which the new protein synthesis occurs, either in the signaling pathway
  or in the actual transporters and enzymes that synthesis GAGs is unknown. The GAG
  elongation in response to growth factors is of the order of 20 per cent but this
  is sufficient to half the affinity of binding of the GAG chain to LDL.
