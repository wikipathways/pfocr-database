caption: Steroid hormone synthesis pathways in the adrenal gland and testis. Steroid
  synthesis in the adrenal gland occurs in three zones, each with a specific complement
  of enzymes. The zona glomerulosa contains the enzymes necessary to produce aldosterone.
  The zona fasciculata and reticularis additionally express CYP17A1. The hydroxylase
  activity of CYP17A1 is active in the zona fasiculata resulting in the production
  of cortisol. Due to tissue-specific expression of the cytochrome b5 coregulator,
  the lyase activity of CYP17A1 is only present in the zona reticularis and drives
  efficient production of DHEA which is then sulfated to DHEA-S (dotted arrows indicate
  low activity). 17α-OH progesterone is a poor substrate for CYP17A1 lyase (dotted
  arrow) and thus androstenedione is formed at lower levels from this substrate than
  17α-OH pregnenolone. Testicular androgen synthesis follows a similar pathway to
  DHEA formation as that in the zona reticularis, but due to the absence of SULT2A1,
  and the presence of HSD3B2 and HSD17B3, DHEA is efficiently converted to testosterone.
  The primary product of each zone is denoted within the darker squares (aldosterone,
  cortisol, DHEA-S in the adrenal gland, and testosterone from the testis). The adrenal
  steroids involved in the generation of novel 5α-reduced androgens with activity
  against the AR are depicted in the hatched boxes (DOC, 11OH-AED, 11-K-AED).
