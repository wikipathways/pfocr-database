caption: Long-term survival/differentiation in EGF stimulated cells and sequential
  MEK/ERK inhibitions allowing multiple divisions waves. Hepatocytes are cultured
  in presence or absence (-GF) of EGF and after one week of culture, transient inhibitions
  of MEK/ERK by U0126 allow EGF-cultured hepatocytes to re-enter in new cell cycles.
