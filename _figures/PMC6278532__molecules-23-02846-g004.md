caption: Immunomodulatory function of extracellular Hsp70. Hsp70 bound to peptide
  substrates is recognized by the scavenger Hsp70 receptor. This generates a signal
  that causes NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NF-κB activates
  synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell co-stimulation through MHC
  II. An alternative pathway for Hsp70-peptide-receptor complex internalization is
  through endocytosis, leading to subsequent processing of the peptide by proteasomes
  to generate antigenic peptides that are presented on MHC II.
