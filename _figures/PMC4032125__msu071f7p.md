caption: 'Novel downstream target genes of Yki in Drosophila. Schematic representation
  of the Fat-Hippo pathway in Drosophila. In response to dachsous (Ds) binding, fat
  (Ft) protocadherin activates the Hippo pathway, potentially through expanded and
  warts (dashed line). The Expanded-Merlin-Kibra complex (Ex-Mer-Kbr) also activates
  the kinase cascade leading from the Hippo/Warts (Hpo/Wts) kinases and their scaffolding
  proteins Salvador (Sav) and Mod as tumor suppressor (Mats) to Yki and its transcriptional
  cofactors (TF). Listed below are examples of putative target genes that met the
  dual criteria of Yki/Sd chromatin association and were upregulated in common following
  YkiS168A, TaYapS81A, and MbYap+TBD overexpression. Yap ortholog-induced genes were
  divided into three classes: known target genes, novel target genes (green), and
  candidate negative feedback loop components (red).'
