caption: Oxidative stress-induced regulation of Polβ protein sub-cellular localization.
  Proposed model highlighting the regulation of Polβ protein sub-cellular localization
  by oxidative stress. The Polβ/NQO1 interaction regulates the level of Polβ in the
  cytosol by preventing the ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. Conversely,
  the Polβ/XRCC1 interaction regulates the level of Polβ in the nucleus by preventing
  activation of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Oxidative stress promotes
  the regulation of the binding partners, alternating from Polβ bound to NQO1 ⇒ Polβ
  bound to XRCC1, promoting the chromatin localization of Polβ.
