caption: Graph illustrating the mechanism by which suppression of SLC35B2 re-sensitizes
  YAP1-driven melanoma cells to MAPK pathway inhibitors. YAP1-driven RTK activation
  through upregulation of RTKs and/or ligands mediates Vemurafenib resistance, the
  latter relying on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for efficient RTK activation.
  In this context, heparan sulfation becomes critical for sufficient HSPG expression
  and loss of SLC35B2 abrogates HSPG synthesis by decreasing the transport of PAPS
  from cytosol into the Golgi apparatus. As a consequence, activity of multiple RTKs
  including ERBB3, AXL, and in part also EGFR is diminished, which is associated with
  re-sensitization toward Vemurafenib. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular
  weight heparin (LMWH) can interfere with the interaction of HS, RTKs, and their
  ligands and thereby inhibit ERBB3, AXL, and (in the presence of Vemurafenib) EGFR
  activity, which re-sensitizes resistant melanoma cells toward MAPKis. The pan-ERBB
  inhibitor Afatinib inhibits the ERBB family of RTKs and shows MAPKi re-sensitization
  in MITFlow/AXLhigh melanoma cells that are characterized by high YAP1/TAZ activity.
