caption: Activation of AhR by kynurenine, leading to the differential modulation of
  T cell subsets. This figure illustrates the activation of the AhR upon binding with
  kynurenine, a metabolite of the tryptophan pathway. Once activated, AhR promotes
  the differentiation and activation of various T cell subsets, particularly Th1,
  T regulatory (Treg), and Th17 cells. Simultaneously, the activation of AhR leads
  to a reduction in the activity and numbers of B cells, dendritic cells, and natural
  killer (NK) cells, indicating a shift towards a more immunosuppressive environment.
  This regulatory pathway is particularly relevant in immune tolerance, autoimmunity,
  and cancer, as well as in response to environmental stressors, including non-genotoxic
  carcinogens. On the right hand side of the Figure 5, the upward arrow indicates
  an increase, whilst the downward arrow indicated a reduction
