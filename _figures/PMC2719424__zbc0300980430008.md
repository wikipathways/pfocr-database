caption: Schematic representation of DUOX1 involvement in TLR-mediated IL-8 production
  in response to bacterial stimuli. Cell stimulation with LPS or α-ASGM1 mediates
  release of ATP, which activates EGFR-ERK1/2-NF-κB signaling cascades which is amplified
  by ADAM17-TGF-α activation cascade. Intracellular production of H2O2 by DUOX1 promotes
  this signaling pathway by ligand-independent EGFR activation or activation of upstream
  tyrosine kinases such as Src.
