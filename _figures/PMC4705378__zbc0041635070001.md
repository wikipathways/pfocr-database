caption: CBS and the trans-sulfuration pathway of the methionine cycle. CBS catalyzes
  the condensation of homocysteine (Hcy) with cysteine (Cys) or serine (Ser) forming
  cystathionine (Cysth) and either H2S or H2O. CBS can also catalyze the conversion
  of Cys into Ser or lanthionine (Lanth) with concomitant production of H2S. CBS is
  allosterically activated by AdoMet and inhibited by NO• and CO. Met, methionine;
  MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase; MT, methyltransferases (involved in methylation
  reactions); SAHH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase; CGL, cystathionine γ-lyase;
  GSH, glutathione.
