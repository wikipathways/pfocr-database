caption: 'Starch biosynthesis in the cereal endosperm: rice as an example.(A) Generation
  and transport of ADP glucose (ADPG), the major substrate for starch synthesis. Sucrose
  synthesized by photosynthesis is unloaded and distributed by GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING
  1 (GIF1) (), then processed into ADPG in the cytosol and amyloplast by AGPase after
  a series of reactions and transport. In higher plants, AGPase is a heterotetramer
  composed of two large subunits (AGPL) and two small subunits (AGPS). ADPG synthesized
  in the cytosol is transported to the amyloplast through Brittle 1 (Bt1).(B) Generation
  of primers for starch synthesis. The initiation of starch synthesis requires the
  availability of malto-oligosaccharides (MOSs). MOSs have been found to be continuously
  generated through trimming of nascent amylopectin by ISA1 and ISA2 in the process
  of starch synthesis or released by α/β-amylases during starch degradation (; ; ).
  However, the de novo synthesis of the original MOSs in cereals is still unclear.
  In rice, the PHO1–DPE1 complex enhanced synthesis of long MOSs in vitro, and an
  unknown factor(s) can compensate for the function of PHO1 at room temperature (;
  ). SSIV and its interaction partners, including PHO1, PTST2, MFP1, and MRC, were
  found to participate in the extension of MOSs in Arabidopsis (). In addition, recombinant
  SSs and GBSSI from barley and Arabidopsis were demonstrated to elongate MOSs as
  short as maltose in vitro (; ). MOSs are further processed into linear glucans and
  branched glucans, which act as primers to initiate the synthesis of amylose and
  amylopectin, respectively. PHO1 and SBEs combine to promote the extension of MOSs

  in the starch synthesis pathway. The isozymes of starch synthesis-related enzymes
  in cereals form heterologous multi-enzyme complexes with other isozymes or homo-multimers
  with themselves in vivo to perform their functions. These complexes include, but
  are not limited to, trimers composed of SSI, SSIIa, and SBEIIa/SBEIIb (; ). ISA1
  can form homo-oligomers with itself or heterologous complexes with ISA2, and PTST2
  interacts with ISA1, enabling its binding to starch granules (; ). PTST1 interacts
  with GBSSI to help the latter’s localization to the surface of starch granules,
  and GBSSI then controls amylose synthesis in the form of oligomers after being phosphorylated

  lamellae in the starch granule matrix (). Amylopectin branch points and amylose
  form amorphous lamellae. The crystalline lamellae alternate with the amorphous lamellae
  containing branch points of amylopectin and amylose to form concentric growth rings
