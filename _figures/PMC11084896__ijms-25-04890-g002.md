caption: Schematic of the biosynthetic pathway for gangliosides. Glucosylceramide
  (GlcCer) synthase, encoded by the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (Ugcg)
  gene, synthesizes GlcCer from ceramide. Gangliosides are classified as o-, a-, or
  b-series according to the number of sialic acids attached to galactose. Monosialodihexosylganglioside
  (GM3) synthase (GM3S) is required for the GSL synthesis downstream of lactosylceramide
  (LacCer), including the a-series and b-series. The b-series gangliosides are synthesized
  from the common precursor molecule Disialosyllactosylceramide (GD3), which is the
  product of GD3 synthase (GD3S, encoded by the Gd3s gene). β1, 4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
  (GalNAcT) activity is required for the elaboration of the o-, a-, and b-series precursors
  LacCer, GM3, and GD3, respectively. Gangliosides suppress protease upregulation
  through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Cer, ceramide;
  GSLs, glycosphingolipids; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; p38, Thr180/Tyr182
