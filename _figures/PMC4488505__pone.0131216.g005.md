caption: (A) MoDCs were incubated in the presence/absence of 1 nM t-PA and 100 nM
  plasminogen. 3 h later cultures were lysed and subject to kinomic microarray analysis
  yielding a short list of 31 signalling proteins that were differentially regulated
  upon plasmin-treatment (see  for complete dataset). The short list was subjected
  to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to yield three canonical signalling pathways (not
  shown) for plasmin-mediated immunomodulation, which were manually merged and refined
  to generate a single putative signalling pathway that underlies plasmin-mediated
  immunomodulation. Red symbols represent upregulated events. Blue symbols represent
  downregulated events. (B) The kinomic short list of differentially regulated signalling
  proteins was batch analysed using the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Shown
  are the 5 most significantly perturbed pathways of interest (POI), the differentially
  regulated proteins within each POI and the degree of statistical significance (p-value
  computed using the default PID hypergeometric distribution test).
