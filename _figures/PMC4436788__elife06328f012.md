caption: 'During de novo synthesis, TG and PC share the same precursor, diacylglycerol
  (DG). Therefore, the fatty acid profile of neutral lipids is suggestive of incorporation
  during de novo synthesis of both TG and phospholipids, assuming that TG has a negligible
  degree of acyl-chain remodeling. Based on the enzymatic assays and the fatty acid
  profiles of phospholipids and neutral lipids, we propose the following explanation
  for the results. (A) In wild type mice, arachidonoyl-CoA is largely utilized by
  LPCAT3 to be incorporated into phospholipids. (B) In LPCAT3-deficient mice, an excess
  of arachidonoyl-CoA occurs, which is utilized by LPAATs for de novo synthesis of
  both phospholipids and triglycerides, either directly or after being metabolized
  into C22 and C24 n-6 PUFAs (). This pathway is less utilized in wild type mice.
  The monoacylglycerol acyltransferase pathway of TG synthesis is ignored in this
  figure, since differences in TG profiles should originate from those synthesized
  by the embryo and not those provided by the mother bloodstream. G3P: glycerol 3-phosphate;
