caption: In C2C12 cells subjected to compressive loading, RhoA and adenylyl cyclase
  activation were induced. Adenylyl cyclase activation may activate protein kinase
  A (PKA) via cAMP production. RhoA phosphorylation by PKA induces decreasing affinity
  of RhoA for ROCK and inactivates ROCK []. Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1)
  at Thr852 which is kinase substrate of ROCK is dephosphorylated. Accordingly, myosin
  phosphatase (MLCP) is activated and dephosphorylates MRLC.
