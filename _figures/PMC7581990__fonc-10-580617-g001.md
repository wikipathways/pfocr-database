caption: Metabolic reprogramming is involved in malignant transformation of prostatic
  cells. (A) Normal prostate epithelial cells express zinc transporter ZIP1 facilitating
  intracellular accumulation of zinc ion, which contributes to inhibition of m-aconitase
  (ACO2) at mitochondria. This inhibition results in truncation of tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA) cycle and release of citrate to the extracellular space. Citrate production
  is supported by increasing the substrate pools for citrate synthase, acetyl-CoA
  (Ac-CoA) and oxaloacetic acid (OAA) at the mitochondria. OAA is supplied as the
  result of action of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (GOT2) on L-aspartate.
  The level of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is associated with increased expression of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha (PDHE1α) of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDH). From bioenergetic point of view, normal prostatic cell is supported
  by aerobic glycolysis. (B) Marked decrease in zinc levels due to depletion of ZIP1
  represents an essential early event in the development of PCa malignancy, which
  relieves m-aconitase to establish a complete TCA cycle. These metabolic alterations
  are functionally related to low citrate level and the general low avidity of 18F-FDG
  in primary PCa. Fatty acids (FA) are incorporated through CD36, followed by CPT1-mediated
  entry into mitochondria to serve as the substrate for fatty acid oxidation (FAO).
  L-Glutamine also serves as the precursor of TCA cycle intermediates after conversion
  into L-glutamate. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) cleaves citrate to produce acetyl-CoA
  to serve as the substrate for fatty acid synthase (FASN). (C) Further malignant
  transformation promotes glycolysis (through increased expression of glycolytic enzymes).
  While lipogenic trait is enhanced, multiple combinations of/all energy source pathways
  are theoretically available at this stage. Therefore, it is important to determine
  which metabolic pathway dominates for survival of given tumors for the future metabolism-based
  precision therapy.
