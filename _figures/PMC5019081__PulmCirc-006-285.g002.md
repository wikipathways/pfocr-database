caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Simplified schematic
  depicting the activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases), JNK
  (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase), and p38 MAPK after growth factor–, cytokine-, and/or
  environmental stress–mediated phosphorylation of MAP3 kinases (MAP3K) followed by
  the phosphorylation and activation of MAP2 kinases (MAP2K). Growth factor–induced
  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation results in the subsequent activation of
  the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Growth factors can also mediate the activation of JNK through
  hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK), which phosphorylates MKK4 (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 4). Stress-dependent activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal
  regulating kinase 1) also targets the MKK4/JNK pathway in addition to MKK3/p38 MAPK.
  TGFBR1 (transforming growth factor beta receptor 1)-induced activation of TAK1 (TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1) and ultraviolet radiation–induced RAC1 and/or CDC42 activation results
  in the activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK.
