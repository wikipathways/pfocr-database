caption: 'TLR4 signaling pathway: TLR4 is localized on the cell surface for ligand
  recognition, some of which are recognized after TLR4 interacting with MD2, even
  requiring CD14 and/or LBP involvement. Once activated by ligands on the cell surface,
  the TLR4/MD2 complex engage two separate downstream signaling pathways: the MyD88-dependent
  pathway and the TRIF-dependent pathway. The MyD88-dependent pathway mediates inflammatory
  response via some important transduction signaling such as NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, CaMK
  II, and MAPK, which promote NF-κB nuclear translocation and accelerate AP-1 transcriptional
  activation, and eventually leading to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In
  addition, there is crosstalk between MAPK and CaMK II signaling. TRIF plays an essential
  role in the MyD88-independent pathway through TLR4, type I IFNs are a crucial downstream
  molecule mediating hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Abbreviations: TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; MD2, Myeloid differentiation protein 2; LBP, LPS binding protein; MyD88,
