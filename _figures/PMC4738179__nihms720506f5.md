caption: Exposure of human erythrocytes to PGI2 or its analogs results in activation
  of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs. In this pathway activation of Gi stimulates
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity resulting in increases in 3′5′-adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR). The final conduit for ATP release in response to IPR
  activation is the voltage dependent anion transporter (VDAC). The cAMP required
  for ATP release is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3A). Increases in intracellular
  cGMP, which is hydrolyzed by PDE5, inhibit the activity of PDE3A and enhance IPR-mediated
  ATP release. (+) = activation; (−) = inhibition.
