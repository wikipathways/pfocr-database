caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. Inactive AhR forms a complex
  with a dimer of 90 kDa heat schock 90. AhR-interacting protein (AIP), the co-chaperone
  p23, and the protein kinase SRC (SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase).
  This complex maintains AhR in an inactive state, prevents its degradation and supports
  its binding by a ligand. Upon ligand binding, AhR translocates to the nucleus and
  binds AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Then, the complex AhR/ligand/ARNT binds the
  regulatory region in a myriad of genes having AhR responsive elements (xenobiotic
  response elements, XREs) to stimulate their transcription led by RNA polymerase
  II and associated transcription factors (not shown).
