caption: Metabolic profile of syngeneic vs. alloreactive T-cells. In order to meet
  their metabolic demands, GvHD-driving T-cells upregulate essential metabolic pathways.
  Glycolysis manifests as the principal source of energy in GvHD-causing T-cells.
  Fueling the TCA cycle with glycolysis-derived pyruvate reinforces increased OXPHOS
  activity in alloreactive T-cells. Enhanced OXPHOS potentiates production of ROS
  radicals (O2-), which is linked to lowered levels of antioxidants. Upregulation
  of glutamine metabolism further enhances OXPHOS by nourishing the TCA cycle with
  glutamine-derived a-ketoglutarate. Alloreactive/allogeneic T-cells display a superior
  lipid metabolism (FAS and FAO) and PPP-activity (fueled by glutamine as an anaplerotic
  source) as compared to syngeneic T-cells. Likewise, expression of the metabolic
  checkpoints AMPK and mTOR are elevated. Increased macromolecule synthesis complies
  with the demand of alloreactive T-cells for rapid cell growth and proliferation.
