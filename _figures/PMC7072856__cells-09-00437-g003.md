caption: 'The activity regulation of NADPH oxidases (NOXs/RBOHs) in plant immunity
  of rice. Two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), OsRLCK185 and OsRLCK176,
  can be directly phosphorylated by a plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase,
  OsCERK1 [,,], which is associated with receptor-like kinases OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when
  induced by PGN, but associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6 or OsCEBiP under chitin treatment
  []. In addition, OsCEBiP can form a homodimer upon chitin binding that is followed
  by heterodimerization with OsCERK1, creating a signaling-active sandwich-type receptor
  system [,]. Then, the phosphorylated OsRLCK185 triggers a MAPK cascade: OsMAPKKK18/24-OsMKK4-OsMPK3/6,
  to activate the downstream proteins directly, or perhaps act as the upstream of
  NOXs/RBOHs to enhance ROS production [,]. Similar to OsRLCK185, OsRLCK176 also activates
  MAPK cascades [], but the mechanism remains to be addressed as well. A ROP/RAC GTPase,
  OsRAC1, is also involved in the OsCERK1/OsCEBiP-mediated immune signaling, it activates
  OsRbohB for ROS production by directly interacting with the N-terminus of the NADPH
  oxidase [,]. Two other regulator factors, OsGEF1 and OsRACK1, also participate in
  this signaling pathway. OsGEF1 mediates the change between the RAC-GDP inactive
  form and the RAC-GTP active form as a molecular switch for the signaling [,], coupling
  with OsRACK1 [], after being phosphorylated by OsCERK1 []. In addition, OsRACK1
  also functions as a scaffolding protein linking heterotrimeric G proteins and the
  MAPK cascade []. Phosphorylation functions in important roles in activating NOXs/RBOHs
  and contributes to oxidative burst. However, the phosphorylation of NOXs/RBOHs is
  not sufficient for full activation of the proteins []. The binding of influx Ca2+
  to EF-hand region and the phosphorylation in the N-terminal region of OsRbohB by
  CDPK5/13 perhaps induce the conformational change in EF-hand region of the NOX/RBOH
  and therefore, expose the site for interaction with RAC GTPase in the N-terminal
  region, and subsequently activate OsRbohB for ROS production. In turn, the ROS produced
  by the NOX/RBOH and other components induce more Ca2+ influx and the elevated Ca2+
  in cytosolic play a positive role to induce more Ca2+ efflux from intracellular
  Ca2+ stores. Meanwhile, Ca2+ accumulation reaches a threshold, which may serve as
  a negative feedback mechanism to terminate the OsRAC1–OsRbohB interaction and ROS
  production []. These results imply that CDPK and RAC synergistically regulate the
  activity of NOXs/RBOHs in Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, the Ca2+-related negative
  feedback mechanism exerts an important function in regulating the RAC–NOX/RBOH interaction
  for maintaining the ROS homeostasis in rice plants. CDPK, calcium-dependent protein
