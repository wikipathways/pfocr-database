caption: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identifies hypermethylated genes that
  are linked to regulation of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in response to
  resveratrol (RSV) in breast cancer cells. (A) A scheme depicting oncogenic signaling
  pathways with their upstream regulators that are hypermethylated upon RSV exposure.
  (B) Differences in DNA methylation between 15 µM RSV-treated and vehicle-treated
  MCF10CA1a breast cancer cells, as determined by Infinium HumanMethylation 450 K
  BeadChIP microarray. The difference is expressed as delta beta, which corresponds
  to the difference in bead intensities (beta values). The data were extracted from
  GSE80794 from our previous work [16]
