caption: BR signalling pathway. The perception of BR begins at the plasma membrane.
  The BR receptor complex consists of the receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE
  1 (BRI1) and its co-receptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1). When BRs
  bind to the BRI1 receptor, they induce a conformational change in the receptor,
  leading to the activation of its kinase domain. Activated BRI1 phosphorylates itself
  and phosphorylates BAK1. The activated BRI1-BAK1 complex initiates a phosphorylation
  cascade involving several downstream components, including BR-SIGNALING KINASE 1
  (BSK1), CONSTITUTIVE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH 1 (CDG1), and others. BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE
  2), a GSK3-like kinase, is a negative regulator of the BR signalling pathway. Activated
  BRI1 inhibits BIN2 through phosphorylation. Inhibition of BIN2 leads to the stabilization
  and nuclear translocation of BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1) and BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR
  1), which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of BR-responsive
  genes. BZR1 and BES1 bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes,
  regulating their expression. This figure was drawn using BioRender [https://www.biorender.com
