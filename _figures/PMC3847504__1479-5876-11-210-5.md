caption: A schematic illustration of the correlation in mechanisms among detected
  parameters. Immune recognition of siRNA is via TLR pathway that mainly includes
  TLR3 (adaptor TRIF) and TLR7 (adaptor MyD88), as well as non-TLR pathway that involves
  PKR activation. NF-κB and c-Jun are located in convergent points of different signaling
  pathways and mediate interferons and inflammatory cytokines production. HMGB1 is
  released by apoptotic or necrotic cells, recognized by TLR2/4 or RAGE and associated
  with inflammatory responses.
