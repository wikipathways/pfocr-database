caption: 'Full pathway results and possible mechanism for disease-associated variant
  rs61791721 with gene annotation PCCB. rs61791721 (PCCB): The variant rs61791721
  has gene assignment PCCB, which encodes a protein that catalyzes the conversion
  of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (supplementary expanded pathway Figure 7—figure
  supplement 1). The hypothesized mechanism is that the variant decreases PCCB activity,
  resulting in lower levels of succinyl-CoA and increased propionyl-CoA. The increased
  propionyl-CoA results in excess ammonium being produced because propionyl-CoA inhibits
  N-acetylglutamate synthase, which is an important cofactor for the enzyme (carbamoyl
  phosphate synthetase) that catalyzes the first step in the urea cycle for ammonium
  capture. Alanine is a reservoir for nitrogen waste so there is an increase in pyruvate
  and glutamate to alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate to capture the toxic ammonium (;
  ). More glycine is then broken down in response to the decrease in pyruvate levels
  and more glutamine is converted to glutamate, leading to a decrease in glycine and
  glutamine levels. Conversely, the increased levels of propionyl-CoA mean less valine
  and isoleucine need to be broken down, resulting in an increase in their levels.
  In addition, the increased alpha-ketoglutarate increases downstream citric acid
  cycle intermediates, meaning less tyrosine needs to be broken down to produce fumarate.
  Also in response to increased propionyl-CoA, fewer fatty acids are broken down,
  resulting in decreased acetyl-CoA, which is typically the downstream product, decreased
  citrate, which is one step downstream of acetyl-CoA, increased total fatty acid
  levels, and increased total triglyceride levels. This increase may stimulate the
  activity of HMG-CoA reductase and synthase, resulting in increased conversion of
  ketone bodies to acetoacetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA and cholesterol. This results in decreased
  levels of ketone bodies and increased HMG-CoA and cholesterol. Increased HMG-CoA
  leads to increased leucine, while increased cholesterol leads to an increase in
  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (HDL-C). While it is not necessarily intuitive that an increase in cholesterol
  levels would decrease HDL-C, it is possible that this increase activates the Rho
  A signal transduction pathway and suppresses peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  alpha, which then decreases the amount of ApoA1, as the reverse may explain why
  patients on statins may experience an increase in HDL-C despite a decrease in total
  cholesterol (). ApoA1 is an essential protein for HDL and thus a decrease in its
  levels would result in a decrease in HDL-C. We also found that PCCB was the strongest
  eGene in GTEx for rs61791721, with an effect shared across most tissues (). Note
  that we additionally ran GWAS for total triglycerides, total fatty acids, HDL-C,
  and LDL-C as part of the interpretation of the PCCB variant because they are important
  metabolites in the discussion of cardiometabolic disease ().'
