caption: Metabolic differences between M1 and M2 macrophages. In the tumor microenvironment,
  the metabolic differences between M1 and M2 macrophages are closely linked to the
  onset and progression of cancer. Typically, both M1 macrophages and cancer cells
  primarily undergo glycolysis, leading to metabolic competition. As the malignancy
  of the tumor progresses, M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment are gradually
  reprogrammed into M2 macrophages, shifting their metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation.
  Furthermore, the exchange of metabolic products between M2 macrophages and cancer
  cells further promotes the manifestation of the tumor’s biological characteristics.
  This process highlights the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and underscores
  the crucial role of macrophages in tumor development. ppp pentose phosphate pathway,
