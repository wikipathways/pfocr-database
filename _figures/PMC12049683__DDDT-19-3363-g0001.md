caption: 'Schematic representation of TMAO source, synthesis, and excretion. Initially,
  foods rich in L-carnitine, choline, betaine, ergothioneine, and γ-butyrobetaine,
  primarily fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products, are metabolized into TMA by the
  gut microbiota and their associated enzymes (Source). Most of the TMA ingested or
  generated in the gut is swiftly absorbed into the portal circulation via passive
  diffusion across intestinal epithelial cell membranes, subsequently undergoing oxidation
  to TMAO through the action of FMO3 in the liver. TMAO can be directly sourced from
  fish, shellfish, and marine invertebrates (Synthesis). Finally, TMAO is filtered
  by the kidneys and excreted via three main pathways: urinary excretion, fecal elimination,
  and respiratory clearance (Excretion). Created in BioRender. Ge, P. (2025) https://BioRender.com/k35g185'
