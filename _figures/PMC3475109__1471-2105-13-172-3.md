caption: A network showing the reactions predicted from the eight source papers for
  the pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway. Squares are small molecules,
  circles are enzymes, and a pair of arrows is used to denote a single reaction (the
  first for the interaction substrate-enzyme, and the second for the interaction enzyme-product).
  Items labeled green are correct; items labeled red are incorrect. The number next
  to a reaction indicates the number of times that reaction was extracted from the
  set of source texts. The reactions on the right-hand side of the figure (lying outside
  the blue rectangle) are reactions extracted by our algorithm that are not part of
  the manually-annotated pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway from EcoCyc
  given in Figure .
