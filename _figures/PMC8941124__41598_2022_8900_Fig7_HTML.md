caption: Comprehensive molecular mechanisms of transfection of miRNAs on tumor growth
  and proliferation in HeLa cells. (A) Transfection of miR-16-induced DNA damage in
  cells by targeting Wip1 and Cdc25A. Once DNA damage is triggered in cells it may
  regulate p53-dependent or independent molecular mechanisms at the functional G1/S
  checkpoint. miR-16 directly targets mTOR1/2 induced autophagic cell death,. Whereas
  miR-16 controls the senescent phenotype by targeting BMI1, which regulates p21 expression.
  Whereas, miR-16 regulates apoptotic cell death by targeting Bcl2, which triggers
  BAX/Caspase expression. On the other hand, transfection of miR-16 regulates cell
  fate through the p53. miR-16 accelerated the p53 pathway and then, p53 induces autophagic
  cell death through DRAM1. Senescence by induction of p21 while apoptotic through
  induction of BAX/Caspase. (B) Transfection of miR-34-induced DNA damage in cells
  by targeting PACS1 and Cdc25A,. Once DNA damage is triggered in cells it may control
  p53-dependent or independent molecular mechanisms at the functional G1/S checkpoint.
  miR-34 directly targets mTOR2 induced autophagic cell death. Whereas miR-34a regulates
  the senescent phenotype by targeting Myc, which regulates p21 expression. Whereas,
  miR-34a rules apoptotic cell death by targeting Bcl2, which triggers BAX/Caspase
  expression. On the other hand, transfection of miR-34 coordinates cell fate through
  the p53. miR-34 stimulated the p53 pathway and then, p53 induces autophagic cell
  death through DRAM1. Senescence by induction of p21 while apoptotic through the
  introduction of BAX/Caspase. (C) Transfection of miR-449a-induced DNA damage in
  cells by targeting PACS1 and Cdc25A,. Once DNA damage is generated in cells it may
  control p53-dependent or independent molecular mechanisms at the functional G1/S
  checkpoint. miR-449a controls the senescent phenotype by targeting Myc, which modulates
  p21 expression. Whereas, miR-449a rules apoptotic cell death by targeting Bcl2,
  which triggers BAX/Caspase expression. On the other hand, transfection of miR-449a
  regulates cell fate through the p53. miR-449a activated the p53 pathway and then,
  p53 induces senescence by the activation of p21, while triggers the apoptosis by
  the activation of BAX/Caspase. On the right, p53-independent molecular mechanisms
  of cell fate decisions such as autophagy, senescence, and apoptosis. On the left,
  p53-dependent molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination (autophagy, senescence,
  and apoptosis). Red-hammer head arrows represent inhibitions, while blue arrows
  indicate activation, respectively.
