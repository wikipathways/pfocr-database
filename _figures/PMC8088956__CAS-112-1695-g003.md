caption: 'Kinases that modulate the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling. Various protein kinases
  have been reported to modulate the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling in HCC, with some directly
  phosphorylating the components of this pathway. These protein kinases generally
  regulate through 3 mechanisms. First, they target β‐catenin, Axin1, APC, and so
  on to regulate the stability, accumulation, and location of β‐catenin, such as GSK3β,
  CK1, CK2, NEK2, FAK, PAK4, Met, and EGFR. Second, they phosphorylate LRP6 and affect
  the formation of the LRP6 signalosome, such as CK1 and Src. Finally, they target
  β‐catenin and LEF/TCF and modulate the LEF/TCF/β‐catenin transcription complex,
  such as CK1 and CK2. In addition, other kinases indirectly modulate the Wnt/β‐catenin
  signaling, and this modulation varies from kinase to kinase, such as SIK1. The small‐molecule
  inhibitors and activators of the kinases which may be used in combination therapy
  are indicated in this figure in blue boxes. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; CK1, casein kinase 1; CK2, casein kinase 2; Dvl, Dishevelled; EGFR, epidermal
