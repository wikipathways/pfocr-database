caption: Regulation of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila. The Hippo pathway is regulated
  by cell adhesion molecules (Ed), determinants of cell polarity (Crb, Fat/Ds, Scrib
  complex), and mechanical cues (spectrin, F-actin, or cellular tension). In addition,
  Hpo is regulated by Tao, salt induced kinase (Sik), Ras-associated factor (Rassf),
  striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex; Wts is regulated
  by Zyxin (Zyx) and Jub; Yki is regulated by WW Domain Binding Protein 2 (Wbp2),
  Hipk, and Multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain (Mask) (refer to ()). Arrows,
  blunt ends, and dashed lines indicate activation, inhibition, and indirect regulation,
  respectively.
