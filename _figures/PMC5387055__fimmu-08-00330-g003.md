caption: (A) Upon antigen encounter T cells differentiate into effector cells. Antigen
  binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) and coactivation by CD28 inhibit fatty acid
  oxidation (FAO) and activate PI3K-Akt. This activation triggers glycolytic enzymes
  HK and PFK2. Additionally, mTOR signaling is turned on, which enhances expression
  of glycolytic genes, glucose, and amino acid transporters via activation of transcription
  factors HIF1α and Myc. Activation of PLC-γ1 and generation of second messengers
  result in activation of Ras and MEK/Erk pathway, which is required for expression
  of nutrient transporters and nutrient utilization. Calcium release activates calcium-dependent
  mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which activate the TCA cycle. Effector T cells also
  switch from balanced PKM1 and PKM2 expression to increased and predominant expression
  of PKM2, which promotes generation of biosynthetic precursors. These events promote
  glucose and glutamine uptake, increased glycolysis and glutaminolysis combined with
  a high degree of protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis to support cell growth
  and proliferation. CD28 costimulation is required for activation of the signaling
  pathways that support these metabolic changes. (B) Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4
  (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) coinhibitory receptors are expressed in activated
  T cells. Via the recruitment of phosphatases, both these coinhibitory receptors
  attenuate the signaling events mediated by ligation of the TCR by antigen and have
  a mandatory role in the metabolic changes required for optimal T cell activation,
  function, and differentiation. CTLA-4 opposes the effects of CD28 costimulation
  and can inhibit potent TCR-mediated signals. PD-1 inhibits weak but not strong TCR
  signals. The imbalanced activation of these signaling pathways alters the metabolic
  reprogramming of T cells and their differentiation fate (see text for details).
