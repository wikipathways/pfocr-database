caption: The role of tsRNA in neurodegenerative diseases. (A) Mutations in CLP1 cause
  aberrant tRNA exon junctions, leading to the accumulation of 5′ leading‐exon tRNA
  fragments. This makes the cells more susceptible to the effects of the p53 pathway,
  resulting in motor neuron loss. (B) tiRNAs form tetramers that displace the eIF4F
  complex. G4 and YB‐1 act together to induce the assembly of contingency granules
  (SGs). The SG protects neurons from cellular stress by recruiting translation‐stalled
  mRNAs to stop translation, thus protecting neurons from cellular stress. (C) Deficiency
  of NSun2 causes hypomethylation of tRNA; increased cleavage of tRNA by ANG causes
  accumulation of 5′ tiRNA; these lead to neuron size reduction, cell death, and make
  the cell more susceptible to stress
