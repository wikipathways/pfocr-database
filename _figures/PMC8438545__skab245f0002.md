caption: Proteins involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were differentially
  abundant (P < 0.10) in CL of gilts fed 20 (TRT1), 40 (TRT2), or 60 (TRT3) ppm Mn–amino
  acid complex compared with CL of gilts fed 20 ppm Mn sulfate (CON). Proteins in
  colored bold text were differentially abundant in at least one Mn–amino acid complex
  treatment compared with CON. Proteins in red were less abundant, whereas proteins
  in green were more abundant in Mn–amino acid complex treatments compared with CON.
  Fold changes and P-values associated with these proteins are listed in .
