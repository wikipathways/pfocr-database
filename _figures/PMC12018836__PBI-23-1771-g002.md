caption: Illustration of eATP signal transduction. eATP is recognized by PM‐localized
  receptors (e.g. P2K1 or P2K2) through their ecto‐domain (ECD), which initiate eATP
  signal transduction. Key markers of the eATP response include ROS production, calcium
  influx, PM potential depolarization, MPK3/6 phosphorylation and the induction of
  eATP‐responsive genes. Additionally, several P2K1‐interacting proteins are critical
  downstream components of the eATP‐mediated purinergic signalling pathway (e.g. MPKKK,
  CPK28, MVK and PAT5/9)
