caption: Interplay of major zonation signaling pathways. The sinusoids facilitate
  free exchange of nutrients, metabolites, and various substrates, such as oxygen.
  Although the gradient may vary, the periportal to perivenous oxygen gradient (in
  blue) exists inevitably under almost all conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)
  may be major orchestrators since they adapt the gene expression profile in response
  to changing oxygen tensions. The HIF system in hepatocytes but also in the other
  sinusoidal cells can undergo cross-talks with other major zonation regulating pathways
  such as the WNT/β-catenin pathway and associated components, hormone and growth
  factor signaling pathways, the Hippo pathway and the hedgehog (HH) pathway. All
  these pathways and factors exempt the oxygen gradient; depend, to the more or lesser
  extent, on the presence of specific ligands which are secreted from other cells
  than the hepatocytes, e.g., liver endothelial cells which contribute to the synthesis
  of certain WNTs, whereas cholangiocytes and stellate cells can secrete hedgehog
  ligands. PT, portal tract consisting of branches from the hepatic artery (HA), portal
  vein (PV) and a bile duct; CV, central vein.
