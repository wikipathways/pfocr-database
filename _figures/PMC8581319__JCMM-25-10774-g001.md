caption: Overview of ANXA2 proposed pathway in EMT‐related processes. Through its
  phosphorylation after growth factor stimuli, ANXA2 can lead to LIMK phosphorylation
  and CFL1 inactivation. This pathway can cause the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton
  and regulate endocytic pathways and the disassembly of cellular junctions. Phosphorylated
  ANXA2 may also provoke STAT3 phosphorylation, which will translocate to the nucleus
  and induce the EMT transcriptional program. These changes combined originate more
  motile cancer cells that will favour metastasis formation. ANXA2 control over c‐Myc
  mRNA translation also has an impact on EMT induction after growth factor stimuli
