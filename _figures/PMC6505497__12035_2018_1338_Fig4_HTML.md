caption: Activation of Spry2 (conserved cysteine-rich region in green) in response
  to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) stimulation is induced by Src kinase (Y55 phosphorylation,
  Y53 for Spry4) followed by phosphatase recruitment (PP2A) which dephosphorylates
  serines 112 and 115. This results in conformational change at the C-terminal proline-rich
  binding site for GRB2 (light blue, present in Spry2 only) that now becomes accessible
  and prevents interaction with SOS required for downstream ERK activation (interacting
  proteins indicated in light gray boxes). Other binding partners and covalent modifiers
  (listed in dark gray boxes) have been demonstrated to interact mainly with human
  Spry2. Based on sequence similarities and experimental evidence, however, many of
  them also bind Spry1 and Spry4 [, ]. Spry4 has been shown to inhibit the ERK pathway
  predominantly by interaction with SOS1, and all Sprouties may form functionally
  active hetero- and homo-oligomers through their C-terminal domains []. Src, non-receptor
  kinase; C-Cbl, Casitas b-lineage lymphoma ubiquitin E3 ligase; CIN85, Cbl-interacting
  protein of 85 kD; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; SIAH2, seven in absentia homolog ubiquitin
  E3 ligase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PKC, protein kinase C; Tesk1, testicular
