caption: Summary of our findings and a proposed mechanism for the interaction between
  the adenosine/A1 receptor and glutamate/GluN1 (NMDA) and the substance P/NK1 receptor
  signalling pathways in controlling reflexes such as cough and airway obstruction.
  Blockade of the A1 receptor results in an increased cough response and airway obstruction
  that is reversed following antagonism of the GluN1 and NK1 receptors. This suggests
  that stimulation of airway nerves results in an increased central adenosine release
  which, via the A1 receptor, limits the cough response possibly by reducing central
  glutamate and substance P release. We therefore propose that in conditions such
  as CHS, this cough inhibitory adenosine pathway may be dysfunctional.
