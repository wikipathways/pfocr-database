caption: The regulation of the mevalonate pathway and the role of mevalonate-derived
  metabolites in cell proliferation. When cellular level of sterol is low, Insig dissociates
  from the SREBP-SCAP complex, allowing the latter to move to the Golgi apparatus.
  Following proteolytic cleavage of SREBP, its basic helix-loop-helix fragment enters
  the nucleus, binds to the SRE domain of target genes, and initiates the transcription
  and synthesis of a number of enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, including its rate-limiting
  enzyme, HMGCR. The activated mevalonate pathway produces sterols and nonsterols,
  including FPP and GGPP for protein prenylation and cell proliferation. Sterols block
  the transport of the SREBP-SCAP complex to the Golgi apparatus and induce the binding
  of HMGCR to Insig, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of HMGCR. Exogenous
  geranylgeraniol is phosphorylated and converted to GGPP, which induces the dissociation
  of UBIAD1 from HMGCR and facilitates the degradation of HMGCR. The statins competitively
  inhibit HMGCR. Consequently, the lack of sterols and nonsterols results in a compensatory
  upregulation of HMGCR. Tocotrienols and potentially other isoprenoids block the
  processing and nuclear localization of SREBP and enhance the ubiquitination and
  degradation of HMGCR. HMGCR is upregulated in tumors but remains sensitive to isoprenoid-mediated
  downregulation. Synergistic impact of isoprenoids and statins on tumor HMGCR may
  offer a novel approach in enhancing the efficacy of statins with reduced toxicity.
