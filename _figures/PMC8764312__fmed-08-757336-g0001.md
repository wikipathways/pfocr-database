caption: The mainstream strategies and novel targets to protect from liver ischemia
  reperfusion injury (IRI). (A) Pharmacological interventions in liver IRI. Most of
  current medicine used to attenuate liver IRI aim at combating the increased oxidative
  stress, reducing inflammatory response, inhibiting the apoptosis of hepatocytes,
  and promoting the regeneration of damaged liver tissue. (B) Ischemic preconditioning
  (IPC) and ischemic post-conditioning (IPostC) in liver IRI. Pringle maneuver (PM)
  is a simplest and most widely used technology of liver vascular clamping to achieve
  IPC prior to a prolonged period of ischemia and IPostC preceding a continuous reperfusion.
  IPC is characterized by a brief ischemia followed by a transient reperfusion, repeated
  several times, while the steps of IPostC are completely opposite. (C) Machine perfusion
  in liver IRI. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and normothermic machine perfusion
  (NMP) are the two main types in machine perfusion. Compared to HMP, NMP allows for
  the generation of data for the assessment of liver viability and allows for reconditioning
  of the liver ex vivo during the preservation period, which may allow the transplantation
  of currently deemed “untransplantable” organs in the near future. (D) Novel targets
  in liver IRI. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a novel target
  to attenuate liver IRI maybe via ATP-PI3K-Akt pathway mediated by PPARγ-FAM3A axis.
  Of note, miR-122, LncRNA AK139328, and LncSHGL exert deleterious effects on liver
  IRI by blockading the signal transmission between Akt and the liver. NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; GP130, glycoprotein 130; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; IRF5,
  interferon regulatory factor 5; LECs, liver endothelial cells; Nrf2, nuclear respiratory
  factor2; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3; AMPK, AMP activated protein kinase;
  NLRP3, domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3; HMGB, high mobility
  group box; MyD88, myeloid differential protein-88; Epha2, ephrin type-A receptor
  2; ARE, antioxidant response element; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase.
