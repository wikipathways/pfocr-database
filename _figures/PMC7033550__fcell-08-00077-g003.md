caption: 'Metabolism of pericytes during proliferation and quiescence. Top: Under
  growth factor stimulation, pericytes increase glucose metabolism (black arrows)
  to support proliferation. Pericytes increase glucose uptake via GLUT1 and GLUT4
  transporters and glucose is metabolized to produce ATP predominantly through glycolysis.
  This metabolic pathway also provides precursors to protein glycosylation that are
  essential to the production of capillary basement membrane proteoglycans. Although
  nucleotide synthesis may be supported by glycolysis via the pentose phosphate pathway
  (dashed arrow), current data indicate that fatty acid-derived carbons are incorporated
  into dNTP synthesis in pericytes. Fatty acid oxidation (red arrows) also contributes
  to the bioenergetic demand during proliferation, generating up to 15% of the total
  ATP content. Bottom: Quiescence is associated with a low metabolic state and downregulation
  of all metabolic programs. However, the relative contributions of glycolysis, glucose
  oxidation and fatty acid oxidation (illustrated with dashed arrows) within quiescent
  pericytes have not been established. α-KG, alpha-Ketoglutarate; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate;
