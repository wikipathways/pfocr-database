caption: Interleukin-15 (IL-15), produced by cells of haematopoietic or non-haematopoietic
  origin, can act on dendritic cells (DCs) — possibly in an autocrine manner if the
  source of IL-15 is a DC — and endow them with the ability to secrete IL-12 and IL-23
  and to promote the differentiation of T helper 1 (TH1) and TH17 cells. In addition,
  IL-15 blocks the ability of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) to suppress the
  activation of T cells by impairing SMAD3-dependent TGFβ-induced signalling. By activating
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, IL-15 renders effector CD8+ T cells
  unresponsive to the suppressive effect of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+regulatory T (TReg)
  cells. In addition to its ability to upregulate the expression of activating natural
  killer (NK) receptors such as natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D), which endows
  cytotoxic T cells with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity, IL-15 lowers
  the T cell receptor (TCR) activation threshold. IL-15 synergizes with the NKG2D
  cytolytic signalling pathway, leading to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase
  A2 (cPLA2), which in turn crucially regulates NKG2D-mediated degranulation and cytolysis
  and induces the release of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid can promote inflammation
  and the recruitment and activation of granulocytes. Finally, IL-15 promotes interferon-γ
  (IFNγ) production by group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) and NK cells and cytotoxic
  pathways in NK cells. All of these IL-15-mediated immunological effects are directed
  towards promoting protection against intracellular pathogens but can also lead to
  tissue destruction.
