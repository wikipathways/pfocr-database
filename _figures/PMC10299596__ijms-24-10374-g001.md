caption: BCR signaling pathway and BTKis resistance in CLL. Upon antigen binding,
  the B cell receptor initiates the formation of a signaling complex through the phosphorylation
  of immunoreceptor-based activation motif (ITAM) residues on the cytoplasmic tails
  of CD79A(Igα) and CD79B(Igβ) proteins. This event activates SYK, which then triggers
  the activation of BTK, PLCγ2, and PI3K. The downstream signaling response includes
  PKC activation and Ca2+ mobilization and Akt activation, leading to the promotion
  of transcript factors NF-κB, ERK1/2, NFAT, and mTOR. This signaling cascade can
  be effectively inhibited by BTK inhibitors. However, BTK and PLCγ2 point mutations
  can result in BTKi resistance
