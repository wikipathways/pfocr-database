caption: Inflammatory starting line. Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules
  (DAMP), resulting from GERD tissue damage, induce the formation and activity of
  the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor pyrin domain containing
  3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and cytokine release. Pro-IL1β is cleaved by the inflammasome
  and caspase 1 into its active form, followed by release of both IL1β and TNFα from
  tissue resident monocytes and macrophages. IL1β recruits monocytes from the bone
  marrow— whose arrival and exposure to further IL1β, TNFα largely through TNFR2-receptor
  engagement, and GERD constituents—further amplifies the inflammatory response. The
  presence of TNFR1 and/or TNFR2 receptors dictate the specificity of the response
  to TNFα exposure and the induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IL8,
  to further increase TNFα messenger RNA transcription via NF-κB transcription factor
  activation. Exposure of esophageal epithelial cells to IL1β and TNFα results in
  pathway activations in a cell type and pathology-specific manner. Both exogenous
  IL1β and TNFα may initiate phosphorylation-dependent signaling in epithelial cells
  through the IκB kinase complex, resulting in phosphorylation and ubiquitination
  of IκBα, subsequent release of the NF-κB transcription factor, and translocation
  into the nucleus to induce inflammatory cytokine and prostaglandin production (IL8,
  IL6, LIF, and COX2). IL1β and TNFα signaling may be suppressed by the initiation
  of feedback regulators such as the IL1RA-receptor antagonist, IκBα replenishment,
  and induction of the noncanonical pseudokinase tribbles homology 3 (TRIB3), which
  acts to block phosphorylation of IκBα. Mounting evidence suggests tissue- and cell
  type–specific responses to bile acid and acid reflux, especially when comparing
