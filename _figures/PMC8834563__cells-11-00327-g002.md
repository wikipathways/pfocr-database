caption: 'Homoeolog and singleton status of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism
  and signaling. KEGG analysis of the vitamin D metabolic and signaling network identified
  21 genes in the X. laevis genome. The homoeolog/singleton status of each gene is
  marked (L and/or S). In the metabolic part of the pathway leading to cholesterol
  production (above the red dotted line), the pathway runs in parallel from lanosterol
  and dehydrolanosterol. The relative expression levels between homoeologs are summarized:
  =, similar expression levels; <, 3–6 fold difference; <<, more than 6 fold difference.
  Asterisks indicate whether temporal expression patterns of the homoeologs are similar
  (no asterisk), partially divergent (*), or highly divergent (**).'
