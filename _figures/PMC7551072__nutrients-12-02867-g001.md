caption: The regulation of metabolism by B vitamins. (A) B vitamins in one-carbon
  metabolism. The folate cycle begins with the conversion of dietary folate (B9) into
  dihydrofolate (DHF), which is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by the enzyme
  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). THF is next converted to 5,10-methyleneTHF by serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a reaction that is coupled with the hydroxylation
  of serine (Ser) to glycine (Gly) and requires B6 as a cofactor. Thymidylate synthase
  (TS) uses 5,10-methyleneTHF as a methyl donor to methylate deoxyuridine monophosphate
  (dUMP), creating deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). This step regenerates DHF
  for continued cycling. Alternatively, 5,10-methyleneTHF can be reduced by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) to 5-methytetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF) using B2 as a cofactor. As
  part of the methionine cycle, 5-mTHF donates a methyl group to regenerate methionine
  from homocysteine (Hcy), which is catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS) and requires
  B12, in the form of methylcobalamin, as a cofactor. To generate the methyl donor
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for use by multiple methyltransferases (MTs) specific
  for RNA (RMT), DNA (DNMT), histones (HMT), and protein (PRMT) methylation reactions,
  an adenosine is transferred to methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase 2A.
  SAM is demethylated during the methyltransferase reactions to form S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) that is then hydrolysed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) to form
  Hcy. Hcy can also enter the transsulfuration pathway catalyzed by cystathionine
  beta synthase (CBS) and vitamin B6 to create cysteine. In the liver, betaine from
  the diet can act as a methyl donor for betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase
  (BHMT), using B6 as a cofactor, to make methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG) as
  a byproduct. Important dietary micronutrients and metabolite intermediates are highlighted
  in blue. Items in red are important byproducts of one-carbon metabolism. (B) B12
  and propionate metabolism. The propionate catabolic pathway breaks down branched-chain
  amino acids (BCAAs), odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol to be used in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) converts methylmalonyl-CoA
  into succinyl-CoA using B12, in the form of adenosylcobalamin, as a cofactor. Succinyl-CoA
  then enters the TCA cycle.
