caption: a) Simplified model of how dendritic cells sense T. gondii infection. Toll-like
  receptor 11 (TLR11) and TLR12 are the major receptors for the T. gondii-derived
  protein profilin ( TgPFR). Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) + dendritic cells
  (DCs), in particular CD8 + DCs, have a crucial role in detecting T. gondii profilin
  and in the subsequent induction of interleukin (IL)-12 production downstream of
  myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88). A novel MYD88-dependent
  signaling pathway that depends on activation of IRF8 is an explanation for the potent
  induction of IL-12 expression by CD8α + DCs that have been exposed to T. gondii,
  but the direct connection between MYD88 and IRF8 has not been established. In addition,
  both TLR7 and TLR9 have been implicated in detecting T. gondii RNA and genomic DNA,
  respectively. UNC93B1 (UNC), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, has a central
  role in the function of all of the depicted endosomal TLRs and is essential for
  resistance to T. gondii (modified and redrawn from ). b) Schematic representation
  of the proposed sequence of events occurring in liver-resident cells upon Plasmodium
  sp. infection. Plasmodium RNA triggers a type I interferon response via activation
  of the cytoplasmic RNA sensor Mda5 and other unknown receptors, mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling protein (Mavs), and the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor
  3 (Irf3) and Irf7 (modified and redrawn from ).
