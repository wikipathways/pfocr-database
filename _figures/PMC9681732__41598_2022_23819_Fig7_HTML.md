caption: Working hypotheses for the observation of DSB repair processes. A HR, resection-free
  hypothesis. Limited cleavage of the SC-plasmid would allow the formation of single-stranded
  gaps triggering the recruitment of RAD51 and initiate a pairing with the Cy3-Lin-plasmid.
  B HR, resection-based hypothesis. The AflIII restriction site can be bound by the
  MRN complex, allowing the initiation of 5’ end resection based on the activity of
  BLM-DNA2 and EXO1. Strand invasion into the SC-plasmid would then be initiated following
  RAD51 binding on ssDNA tails, in cooperation with HR proteins BRCA1-2 and PALB2,
  thereby forming a recombination complex with both plasmids. The completion of HR
  requires DNA synthesis through several processes. C Ligation model of the Lin-plasmid
  for the observation of NHEJ-like processes. The cohesive ends present in the Lin-plasmid
  immobilized on the biochip and in the Cy3-Lin-plasmid are an ideal substrate for
  KU and DNA-PKcs proteins. This process initiates the NHEJ pathway. D Model of SSA-like
  process after SC-plasmid resection. The extensive resections occurred in the immobilized
  SC-plasmid after incubation with cell lysates and the presence of extensive homologies
  between the SC-plasmid and the Cy3-Lin-plasmid, could represent a substrate for
  ERCC1 and XPF which initiate the SSA pathway. Note that SDSA, which is not shown
  here, may be an important contributor to the DNA synthesis measured on the SC plasmid.
  E Model of alt-EJ-like process based on microhomologies. Uncovered microhomologies
  between the Lin-plasmid immobilized on the biochip and the Cy3-Lin-plasmid can be
  recognized and filled with labelled dNTPs by polθ that is involved in the alt-EJ
  pathway.
