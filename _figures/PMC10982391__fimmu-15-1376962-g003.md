caption: The function of CD8+ T cell-derived EVs on tumors. CD8+ T cell-derived EVs
  possess the unique properties of both promoting tumor immune escape and enhancing
  the anti-tumor effect within tumor tissues. (A) CD8+ T cell-derived EVs carrying
  TCR and FasL lead to the downregulation of pMHC I and induce DCs apoptosis via the
  Fas/FasL pathway. The FasL, as the ligand for Fas, can upregulate MMP9, promoting
  tumor invasion. Moreover, EVs from exhausted CD8+ T cells containing lncRNAs have
  been demonstrated to impair the anticancer function of CD8+ T cells. (B) CD8+ T
  cell-derived EVs contain miRNAs that exert a role in modulating the tumor stroma,
  restoring the TME, and regulating signaling pathways to inhibit tumor development.
  Additionally, the PD-1 molecules present on the surface of EVs derived from CD8+
  T cells can induce internalization of PD-L1, thereby reducing PD-L1-mediated immune
  evasion. TCR, T cell receptor; pMHC I, peptide major histocompatibility complex
