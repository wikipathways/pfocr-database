caption: Under stress conditions such as high Ca2+ concentration or thermal stress,
  calcineurin is activated and dephosphorylates Crz1, resulting in its translocation
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Crz1 upregulates the expression of stress response
  genes, such as those involved in cell wall maintenance or remodeling and small molecule
  transport. Calcineurin also translocates to P-bodies and stress granules [] where
  it may act upon other factors that influence mRNA expression or stability to operate
  a bifurcated transcriptional/post-transcriptional stress response network necessary
  for fungal virulence.
