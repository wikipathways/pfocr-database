caption: The energy metabolism of cancer cells. Under aerobic condition, Most of the
  glucose is first converted to pyruvate via glycolysis in the cytosol. Most pyruvate
  are mostly processed to lactate via glycolytic pyruvate even in the presence of
  oxygen, and only a small portion of pyruvates enters the mitochondria to produce
  CO2 by undergoing TCA cycle. In addition, small proportion of the glucose is diverted
  into the upstream of pyruvate production for biosynthesis (e.g., pentose phosphate
  pathway, and amino acid synthesis)
