caption: The canonical JAK-STAT signaling cascade. (A) Core JAK-STAT pathway factors
  identified in Drosophila and their putative roles in the cascade. (B) Evolutionary
  conservation of the JAK-STAT immune signaling in insects and humans. Insect orthologs
  are indicated with solid black circles at the branch node. Genes that are transcriptionally
  regulated by the insect STAT are indicated with a star. The pathway core intracellular
  machinery is highly conserved in human and insects. The upstream ligands and effectors
  are less conserved, which may suggest a host–pathogen-specific response. Accession
  numbers are presented in Fig. S1.

  description: The canonical JAK-STAT signaling cascade. (A) Core JAK-STAT pathway

    Evolutionary conservation of the JAK-STAT immune signaling in insects and humans.
    Insect orthologs are indicated with solid black circles at the branch node. Genes
    that are transcriptionally regulated by the insect STAT are indicated with a star.
    The pathway core intracellular machinery is highly conserved in human and insects.
    The upstream ligands and effectors are less conserved, which may suggest a host–pathogen-specific
    response. Accession numbers are presented in Fig. S1.
