caption: 'LLPS and signalling pathways in the cytoplasm of healthy liver cells and
  HCC cells. (A) In healthy liver cells, LLPS is involved in regulation of the cAMP-dependent
  pathway. In Hippo signalling pathway, the core kinases MST1/2 bind to Laforin, which
  then phosphorylate the transcription co-activators YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ
  are sequestered in the cytoplasm and degraded, reducing their activity in promoting
  cell proliferation and growth. In the cAMP-dependent pathway, elevation of cAMP
  levels activates PKA. PKA then phosphorylates transcription factors CREB, ultimately
  regulating gene expression and cellular proliferation. In the MAPK/ERK pathway,
  TAB3 acts as an adaptor protein that recruits TAK1, facilitating its activation.
  Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates downstream MAPK kinases, leading
  to the activation of ERK. (B) In HCC cells, LLPS regulates the transmission of three
  signalling pathways to regulate cell proliferation as follows. In the MAPK/ERK pathway,
  TAK1 forms liquid-like condensates with TAB3 to promote downstream signalling. In
  the cAMP-dependent pathway, the disputation of PKA/cAMP condensates disrupts cAMP
  compartmentation and leads to increased cell proliferation. In the Hippo signalling
  pathway, glycogen accumulates to form droplets, which promotes complex formation
  between Laforin and MST1/2, leading to tumourigenesis in a Yap-dependent manner
