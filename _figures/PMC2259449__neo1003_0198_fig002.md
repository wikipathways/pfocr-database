caption: The molecular regulation of autophagy and the link with apoptosis. In the
  presence of growth factors, growth factor receptor signaling activates cascades
  to the mTOR, resulting in the inhibition of autophagy or type II programmed cell
  death (PCD; right-hand side of the figure). In contrast, inactivation of mTOR can
  induce both apoptosis and autophagy. The left-hand side of the figure represents
  a simplified version of the two main signaling pathways of apoptosis. The intrinsic
  pathway includes the mitochondria. The extrinsic cell death pathway is mediated
  by death receptors (DR). After formation of the DR/death-inducing signaling complex
  (DISC) and recruitment of caspases, downstream signaling pathways lead to apoptosis.
