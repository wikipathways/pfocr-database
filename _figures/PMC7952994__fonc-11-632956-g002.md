caption: Schematic representation of signaling circuits for ULK1 complex activation
  in autophagy initiation. Initiation of autophagy via ULK1 signaling entails mTORC1
  dissociation from ULK1, which becomes active and binds to ATG13 and FIP200 to form
  ULK1 complex. This dissociation and the following signaling cascade can be elicited
  by chemical stimuli, via e.g. enhancing the activity of AMPK and/or by mechanical
  stimuli. This second pathway is achieved via inhibition of mTORC1 by the mechanosensitive
  mTORC2, which responds to various mechanical stimuli. For instance, mTORC2 can be
  directly activated by the soluble form of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is releases
  from focal adhesion at low traction forces (e.g. detachment of the cells from the
  substrate).
