caption: Showing the TRAIL signalling pathway. On the right Figure(1A), the apoptotic
  pathway induced by TRAIL and to the left Figure (1B), the resistance to TRAIL induced
  apoptosis. Binding of TRAIL and trimerisation of TRAIL death receptors leads to
  recruitment of FADD, an adaptor molecule that is capable of caspase-8 recruitment
  and activation. Apoptosis is either induced through direct caspase-8-mediated caspase-3
  activation or through an amplification loop involving the mitochondria and the cleavage
  of the BH3-only protein Bid by caspase-8, cFLIP interferes with the generation of
  active caspase-8, attenuating the role of DISC.
