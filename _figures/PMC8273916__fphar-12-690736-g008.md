caption: 'Schematic diagram of the mechanism of KP regulating LXRα-LPCAT3 signaling
  pathway. KP intervention suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress. The LXR-LPCAT3-ERS
  pathway is activated when induced by HFD or PA/OA. This allows unfolded proteins
  to accumulate in the ER. At the same time, GPR78 dissociates from PERK, IRE1, and
  ATF6, and then binds to the unfolded protein. The dissociated PERK, IRE1 and ATF6
  were activated. CHOP-induced apoptosis occurs when PERK, IRE1, ATF6 and their downstream
  pathways are continuously activated. The expression of LXR and LPCAT3 decreased
  significantly when treated with KP, and then the unfolded protein decreased, PERK,
  IRE1 and ATF6 dissociated from GRP78 decreased. Abbreviations: HFD: high fat diet,
  PA/OA: Palmitic acid/Oleic acid, LPCAT3: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase

  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, ATF6: activating transcription factor
  6, IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme 1, XBP1: X-box-binding protein 1, ATF4: activating
