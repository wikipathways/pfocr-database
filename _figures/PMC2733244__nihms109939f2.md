caption: A. A network connecting genetic and transcriptional data of STE5 deletion
  strain via paths of length ≤ 3 edges finds 193 nodes and 778 edges.B. The network
  created by ResponseNet connects the genetic and transcriptional data of STE5 deletion
  strain via 23 intermediary nodes and 96 edges. Higher ranked nodes, as determined
  by ResponseNet, appear in darker shades of blue and include core components of the
  pheromone response pathway. Ste5 itself, marked by a red circle, is ranked ninth
  among the top predicted proteins.C. The highly-ranked part of the network created
  by ResponseNet upon connecting genetic hits, to DNA damage signature genes identified
  in yeast treated with the DNA damaging agent MMS. The highest ranking intermediate
  nodes predicted by ResponseNet include core components of the DNA damage response
  pathway. The complete network appears in .Each node represents either a protein
  or a gene, and edges represent protein-protein, metabolic, and protein-DNA interactions.
  The darkness of an edge increases with the amount of flow it carries. Differentially
  expressed genes are labeled with a suffix of g+ for up- and g- for down-regulation.
  Networks were visualized using Cytoscape.
