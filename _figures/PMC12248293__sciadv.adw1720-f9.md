caption: BRD4770 was identified by high-throughput cell-based screening and then modified
  to produce a cardiac-targeting nanoliposome DBMP (top and white background). In
  cardiomyocytes, DOX-induced stress promoted the increase in H3K9 methylation (SAM
  as the methyl donor), which inhibits the expression of two key transcription factors
  Nfe2l2 and Atf4 in SLC7A11, reduces cystine transport, and restricts GSH synthesis,
  resulting in intracellular ROS production, lipid peroxidation accumulation, and
  inflammatory activation, which, in turn, leads to ferroptosis and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
  DIC causes the progressive loss of cardiomyocytes, leading to cardiac damage and
  interstitial fibrosis, and ultimately to cardiac dysfunction in mice (bottom left).
  BRD4770 treatment promoted the transcription of Nfe2l2 and Atf4 by inhibiting the
  methylation of H3K9, thereby promoting the expression of SLC7A11, which increases
  cystine transport and GSH synthesis; providing sufficient reducing agent GSH for
  GPX4 to eliminate ROS and lipid peroxidation caused by DOX, which ultimately reduced
  ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, thereby inhibiting the loss of cardiomyocytes
  and reducing interstitial fibrosis; and ameliorating DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction
  in mice (bottom middle). DBMP, derived from modified BRD4770, specifically targets
  cardiomyocytes by binding to TNX receptors located on the cardiomyocyte membrane.
  In response to DOX-induced ROS, intracellular DBMP releases its loaded BRD4770,
  reducing ferroptosis and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and thereby improving cardiac
  function after DIC (bottom right). PUFAs-OH, non-toxic lipid-alcohols; PUFAs-OOH,
