caption: 'MapMan schematic representation of isoprenoid metabolic pathways in leaves
  of healthy (H) and flavescence dorée-infected (FD) vines cv. ‘Loureiro’. Simplified
  representation of metabolite biosynthesis steps and expression of key genes of the
  following pathways: MVA pathway in the cytosol or the methylerythritol 4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway in plastids responsible for the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors
  isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and the expression
  of terpenoids backbone biosynthetic pathway genes VvIPPI, VvSPS3, VvGGR and VvGGPS;
  carotenoids biosynthetic pathway metabolites and the expression of VvPSY, VvPSD1,
  VvCrtISO, VvLBCY2, VvLECY1, VvBCH1, VvVDE, VvZEP1 and VvNCED1 genes; ubiquinone
  and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthetic pathway metabolites and the expression
  of VvHGGT, VvVTE1, VvVTE3 and VvVTE4 genes; porphyrin and chlorophyll biosynthetic
  pathway and the expression of VvCHLG, VvCAO and VvNYC genes. Metabolites content
  (circles) and transcript expression (squares) variation between healthy (H) and

  regulated in both developmental stages (green and mature) from left to right, respectively.
  Grey squares represent a gene with no detected expression in that developmental
  stage or condition. Dashed arrows indicate multiple metabolic steps. Significant
  differences between FD-infected and respective controls are shown in  and .'
