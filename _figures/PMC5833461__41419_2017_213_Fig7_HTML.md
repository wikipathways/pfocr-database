caption: In the aorta of AD patients, reduced EZH2 expression results in H3K27me2
  and H3K27me3 level decrease, which leads to increase expression of ATG5 and ATG7.
  On the other hand, the MEK–ERK1/2 signaling pathway is activated by decreased EZH2.
  Enhanced ATG5 and ATG7 expression and MEK–ERK1/2 signaling activation jointly induce
  excessive autophagosome formation and then result in ACD of VSMCs, which ultimately
  accelerates AD occurrence
