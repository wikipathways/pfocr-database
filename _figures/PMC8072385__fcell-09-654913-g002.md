caption: 'The schematic interplay among HMBG1, autophagy, and Metabolic Syndrome.
  HMGB1, High mobility group box 1; c23, c46, c106, cysteine at 23, 46, 106 position;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; BCN1, Beclin-1; ATG, autophagy-related genes; Neuroendocrine
  hormones F/S, fasting/starvation; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κb, nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IL, interleukines; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha; p53, protein 53; p73, protein 73; RB, retinoblastoma
  protein; Rel/Nf-κB, member of Rel/Nf-κB family; ER, estrogen receptor; C, caspases,
  non-canonical inflammasome; RAGE, advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor;
  TLR2 and TLR4, Toll-like Receptor 2 and 4; TIM-3, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3;
  CXCR4, chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4; Mac-1, macrophage-1 antigen; CD138, syndecan-1;
  CD24, cluster of differentiation 24; M, macrophages; IR, Insulin Resistance; AT,
  Adipose Tissue. HMGB1 functions as a Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP)
  protein in the extracellular space. A mixture of different HMBG1 isoforms (CH =
  reduced form; SH2: disulfide HMBG1, SH3 oxidized form) in the extracellular space
  activates different pathway signaling. As the disulfide HMBG1 is responsible for
  autophagy activation, which counteracts the metabolic consequences of MetS. During
  an overload of food nutrients, there is an increase in ROS. The oxidative environment
  modifies the Reduced/oxidized HMBG1 ratio, increasing the dysregulation in Insulin/mTOR
  signaling, which blocks the autophagy machinery. It follows an increased risk for
  the “unhealthy” obese to develop MetS complications due to an unbalance among the
  downstream IR pathway, chronic inflammatory pattern and inability to counteract
  metabolic derangements via autophagy machinery disruption. HMGB1 is an autophagic
  regulator that mediates stress response: in normal condition, cytosolic HMGB1 as
  BECN1-binding protein induces autophagy. Extracellular HMGB1 binds RAGE, which inhibits
  mTOR and promotes autophagy. In chronic obesity and switching from insulin-sensitive
  to IR state, change in oxidative environment modifies the HMBG1 activity altering
  its inducer role in autophagy. In the nucleus, HMBG1 interact with and enhances
  the activities of number of transcription factors, including p53, p73, RB, Rel/Nf-κB,
  and ER. Once released, HMBG1 binds to various receptors to activate DAMP signaling
  involved in multiple cellular processes. Inflammasomes are a cytosolic multiprotein
  complex formation that are recruited by external pathogen and/or internal stimuli.
  Chronic inflammasomes lead to chronic inflammatory status increasing the risk of
  clinical consequences of MetS. HMGB1 triggers C (Caspase-4/caspase-5) which are
  components of the “non-canonical inflammasome” with cytokines release and induction
  of pyroptosis (a kind of proinflammatory cell death combining features of both apoptosis
  and necrosis).'
