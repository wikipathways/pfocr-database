caption: Mechanisms of NFE2L2 activation. Under normal conditions, nuclear factor
  erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NFE2L2) is bound to Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein
  1 (KEAP1) in the cytoplasm and is degraded. Type 2 diabetes increases glucotoxicity
  and lipotoxicity, which increases oxidative stress. In the canonical NFE2L2‐KEAP1
  pathway, when oxidative stress is present, NFE2L2 is activated and translocates
  to the nucleus. NFE2L2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), along with
  small Maf (sMaf) proteins to increase expression of antioxidant genes. Sequestosome
  1 (SQSTM1) expression is increased with autophagy. In the non‐canonical SQSTM1‐KEAP1
  pathway, SQSTM1 interacts with KEAP1 and inactivates the NFE2L2‐KEAP1 complex thus
  promoting NFE2L2 translocation to the nucleus
