caption: Antitumour mechanisms of statins. The left side of the figure mainly shows
  the mechanism related to the ability of statins to increase LDL clearance by inhibiting
  HMGCR via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, thereby reducing the proliferation,
  migration and metastasis of gastric cancer cells and promoting apoptosis. The right
  side shows that statins inhibit the TBK1–IRF3–IL-33 signalling pathway and the β-catenin
  and YAP signalling pathways and reduce the activity of GGPP and RhoA, thereby reducing
  the invasion, migration and spread of gastric cancer cells
