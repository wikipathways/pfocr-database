caption: Apoptosis/Proliferation regulatory network in NPCs with miRNAs. miR-27a and
  miR-21 affect the activity of Akt pathway through targeted regulation of PTEN and
  PI3K respectively, and finally affect the autophagy through mTOR pathway. Meanwhile,
  miR-21 can also inhibit the autophagy by inhibiting the transformation of LC3-I
  to LC3-II. Similarly, miR-129-3p can also inhibit the occurrence of autophagy by
  inhibiting the expression of Beclin-1. All of the above miRNAs can indirectly regulate
  the process of apoptosis by affecting autophagy. On the other hand, miR-143-5p,
  miR-155 and miR-486-5p can indirectly regulate the expression of key apoptotic molecules
  such as Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 through different pathways, thus affecting the
  degree of apoptosis. miR-125-1-3p inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting the
  expression of TSHZ3, whereas miR-10b promotes cell proliferation by inhibiting the
  expression of HOXD10.
