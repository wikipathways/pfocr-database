caption: Schematic overview of the molecular pathways responsible for PGE2-mediated
  inhibition (PGE2 concentration > 10 µmol/L, via EP2- and EP4-receptors) and stimulation
  (PGE2 concentration < 10 µmol/L, via EP3- receptor) of platelet activation. The
  inhibitory pathways comprise activation of AC and increase of cAMP. This induces
  CalDAG-GEFI, EPAC and PKA signaling, which results in the phosphorylation of different
  proteins as well as (plasma membrane) receptors and the downregulation of calcium
  mobilization. Processes inducing platelet activation comprise downregulation of
  AC and upregulation of PLC. These processes result in the reduction of cAMP and
  in an elevated calcium mobilization and secretion through DAG and IP3 activation.
  The EP3- and P2Y12-receptors share the Gipathway. Through this common pathway, PGE2
  can potentiate the P2Y12-receptor-mediated and ADP-induced AC inhibition and, furthermore,
  compensate P2Y12 inhibition to a certain extent.
