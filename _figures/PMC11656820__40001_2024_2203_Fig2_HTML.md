caption: The expression of Tim-3 on various immune cells and the functional alteration
  of these cells in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Tim-3 is expressed by various
  cell types, including DC, macrophages, NK cells, NKT cell, and T cells. The expression
  of Tim-3 in these cells increased in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. A Tim-3 signaling
  in macrophages inhibits TLR4 to sense LPS to mediate NF-κB pathway by promoting
  PI3K-AKT and zinc finger protein A20 activation, thereby reducing cytokine production.
  The overexpression of Tim-3 is found to promote the polarization of M2 macrophages.
  B Tim-3 interacts with HMGB-1, limiting the binding of HMGB-1 to DNA, thereby inhibiting
  the maturation of DC cells and TLR-mediated innate immune responses; Galectin-9
  binds to Tim-3 to enhance the production of IL-12 by DC cells. C The overexpression
  of Tim-3 leads to a reduction in the degranulation biomarker CD107a and IFN-γ production
  in natural killer (NK) cells. D The overexpression of Tim-3 in natural killer T
  (NKT) cell promotes apoptosis. On the other hand, Tim-3 can be regarded as an activation
  marker of NKT cell after sepsis. The expression levels of activation markers FasL
  and CD25/CD29 are elevated in Tim-3+ NKT cells, along with a notable increase in
  the secretion of IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ. E Tim-3+ Th1 cells demonstrate heightened
  expression of inhibitory markers LAG/2B4. In addition, these Tim-3+ Th1 cells exhibit
  an increased secretion of the inhibitory cytokine IL-10, while inflammatory cytokines
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ were decreased. F Tim-3 signaling in CD8+ T cells inhibits
  cell proliferation and reduces the production of the effector cytokine IFN-γ. Tim-3+
  CD8+ T cells show a diminished response to antigenic stimulation. G Tim-3+ Tregs
  exhibited enhanced suppressive capacity, characterized by a significant rise in
  the release of inhibitory molecules such as granzyme A, perforin, and IL-10. In
  addition, Tim-3+ Tregs exhibited stronger anti-apoptotic abilities
