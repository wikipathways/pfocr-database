caption: A. Helicases involved in DNA repair and fork stabilization enable cancer
  cells to cope with elevated replication stress induced upon oncogene activation.
  Oncogene-induced origin activation results in replication stalling/collapse due
  to increased inter-origin distance, reduced dNTP pool, increased transcription-replication
  interference, and head-to-tail fork collisions []. ATR-Chk1 pathway activation upon
  oncogene-induced replication stress promotes cancer cell fitness to evade the DNA
  damage response (DDR) barrier (e.g., TP53 loss) []. ATR phosphorylation of RecQs
  (e.g., WRN) stabilizes forks, prevents DSB formation, and ensures replication resumption,
  thereby enabling cancer cell proliferation []. B. Cancer cells gain replicative
  immortality by activating telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM) including telomerase
  expression or ALT. In ALT-positive cancer cells, WRN and BLM helicases dissemble
  HR intermediates, thereby promoting telomere lengthening [–]. FANCM cooperates with
  BLM/BRCA1 to mitigate replication stress at ALT telomeres by resolving non-canonical
  DNA structures []. C. Helicases confer a proliferative advantage to cancer cells
  by resolving non-canonical DNA structures. Cancer-related genes that undergo somatic
  copy number amplification (e.g. c-MYC) are characterized by abundant predicted G-quadruplex
  (G4) forming sequences in their promoter regions []. Because promoter G4 stabilization
  may repress transcription []. G4-resolving helicases (e.g., WRN) promote oncogene
  expression and increase cancer cell proliferation []. However, in some cases increased
  G4 formation is correlated with elevated transcriptional activity [], suggesting
  G4 resolution in regulatory regions may repress transcription []. D. Helicases enable
  cancer cells to gain replicative immortality, leading to tumorigenesis.
