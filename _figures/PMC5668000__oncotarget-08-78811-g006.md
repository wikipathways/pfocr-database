caption: PrKD1 is down regulated in advanced prostate cancer, which decreases phosphorylation
  of beta-catenin at thereonine120 (T120) residue. The T120 unphosphorylated beta-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus resulting in increased nuclear beta-catenin activity.
  The nuclear beta-catenin in turn represses PrKD1 expression through MYC/MAX complex
  and thereby perpetuating down regulation of PrKD1, which is associated with prostate
  cancer progression. Increased nuclear beta-catenin resulted in increased AR coactivation.
  Down regulation of PrKD1 decreases phosphorylation of HSP27 at Serine 82 (S82) which
  facilitates and increases AR nuclear translocation (see discussion).
