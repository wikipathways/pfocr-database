caption: 'Mechanisms of microbiota disruption leading to an inflammatory environment.
  (1) The NF-κB heterodimer is usually composed of the p50 and p65 subunits. It is
  present in the cytoplasm and is inactivated by the inhibitory molecule IkBα. The
  IkB protein is activated when a specific IKK acts on the IkB protein. This causes
  NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of the target gene.
  (2) JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Cytokine binding induces receptor dimerization.
  Upon ligand binding, JAKs are activated and phosphorylate each other, then recruit,
  bind, and phosphorylate STATs in the cytoplasm, which are then dimerized and transported
  to the nucleus. The dimerized STATs bind directly to DNA, altering chromatin structure
  and inducing gene expression of inflammatory mediators. (3) MAPK signaling pathway.
  The pathway of MAPK consists of MAPK kinase (MKKK), MAPK kinase (MKK), and MAPK,
  that is, the MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK chain. These three kinases can be activated sequentially
  to transmit signals from upstream to downstream. Of the four MAPK signaling pathways,
  those associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and growth are JNK and p38. (4) PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway. AKT is activated by phosphorylation of PDK1 and also by the RAS/MAPK
  pathway. On the cell surface, members of the tyrosine kinase receptor activate intracellular
  cofactors that regulate the PIK3 pathway. MAPK interacts with transcription factors
  in the nucleus, thereby affecting gene expression.Source: Created with figdraw.com.IKK,
