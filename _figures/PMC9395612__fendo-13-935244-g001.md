caption: Effects of exosomes on diabetic retinopathy-related cells. High-glucose environment
  and hypoxia alter circulating exosomes and play a key role in DR development. Therefore,
  stem cell exosomes may be an effective treatment for DR. Hypoxia-induced increased
  secretion of hypoxia-inducible factors can lead to endothelial dysfunction (ED)
  and promote endothelial cell permeability in vitro. Hypoxia also leads to changes
  in circulating exosomes (such as miR-1260b), resulting in the proliferation of vascular
  smooth muscle cells. A high-glucose microenvironment also leads to a greater generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the build-up of advanced glycation or lipid
  oxidation end products (AGE or ALE), which in turn leads to inflammatory increased
  cytokines (TNF-α, the secretion of IL-6) and thus to inflammation and exacerbates
  the harm of DR. PRP-Exos participate in early DR formation via mediating hyperglycemia-induced
  retinal endothelial damage by upregulating the TLR4 signaling pathway.
