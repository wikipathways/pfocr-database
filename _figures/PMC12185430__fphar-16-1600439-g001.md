caption: 'Mechanistic framework of the “multiple-hit” hypothesis in MASLD progression
  The pathogenesis of MASLD involves sequential pathological hits driving progression
  from hepatic steatosis to end-stage liver injury. Initial metabolic insults: Insulin
  resistance triggers peripheral lipolysis, increasing free fatty acid (Lena et al.)
  influx into the liver. Concurrently, enhanced de novo lipogenesis (DNL), impaired
  fatty acid β-oxidation, and reduced very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion
  collectively promote triglyceride (TG) accumulation, initiating simple steatosis.
  Oxidative and ER stress: Excessive FFA overload induces mitochondrial dysfunction
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, exacerbating oxidative stress
  and unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress. These
  processes activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways,
  releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6), thereby transitioning
  steatosis to steatohepatitis. Gut-liver axis dysregulation: Gut microbiota dysbiosis
  disrupts intestinal barrier integrity, enabling lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation
  into the liver. Hepatic TLR4 activation amplifies inflammatory cascades and fibrotic
  signaling. Bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism: Aberrant FXR/TGR5 signaling due to BA imbalance
  further disrupts hepatic metabolic homeostasis, aggravating hepatocyte injury and
  disease progression. Abbreviations: DNL, de novo lipogenesis; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
