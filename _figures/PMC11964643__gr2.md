caption: Effector-mediated inflammation.Salmonella uses T3SS effectors to directly
  stimulate innate immune responses in epithelial cells without activating actual
  innate immune receptors (depicted in green). SopE, SopE2, and SopB activate Cdc42,
  which in turn activates PAK1, leading to the formation of a signaling complex with
  TRAF6 and TAK1, ultimately resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  SopA stimulates pro-inflammatory signaling by ubiquitinating the host E3 ubiquitin
  ligases TRIM56 and TRIM65, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and the expression of ΙFN-β. SopD amplifies inflammatory responses by antagonizing
  Rab8-dependent anti-inflammatory signaling pathways through its GAP activity toward
  Rab8. To maintain host cell homeostasis, Salmonella has evolved specific mechanisms
  to reduce inflammatory responses via its T3SS effectors (depicted in red). Some
  effectors antagonize pro-inflammatory pathways, including SptP, which utilizes its
  GAP activity to inactivate Cdc42 and Rac1; PipA, GtgA, and GogA, which cleave the
  NF-κB transcription factors RELA and RELB; SseK1, SseK2, and SseK3, which inhibit
  NF-κB signaling by transferring N-acetylglucosamine to specific arginine residues
  in the death structural domains; GogB, which prevents host SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase
  from degrading IκB to inhibit NF-κB signaling; SpvD, which impairs nuclear translocation
  of p65, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory response; IpaJ, which inhibits the activation
  of the MAPK signaling pathway; AvrA, which inhibits JNK signaling through acetylation
  of MAPKKs MKK4 and MKK7 and also exerts its inhibitory function on the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and SpvC, which inhibits the activation of ERK1, ERK2, and p38, leading
  to the cessation of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine productions.
  Effectors can also inhibit inflammation by directly activating anti-inflammatory
  signaling pathways. These include SopB, which utilizes its phosphatidylinositol
  phosphatase activity to exert anti-inflammatory effects, triggering a signaling
  cascade involving PI3K, PDK1, and mTORC2. SopD activates Rab8-dependent PI3K-PKB-mTOR
  anti-inflammatory signaling cascades by stimulating the dissociation of Rab8 from
  its cognate GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI), thereby suppressing inflammation.
  SteE targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to positively
  regulate anti-inflammatory signaling. Interestingly, SopB and SopD are two effectors
  that exhibit both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activities. Created in
