caption: Fibroblast-produced 5-MTP controls A549 EMT. 5-MTP produced by and released
  from human fibroblasts blocks TGFβ-induced A549 EMT by inhibiting p38 MAPK-mediated
  NF-κB transactivation, thereby suppressing Snail expression, resulting in reduced
  E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin and vimentin. It was postulated that 5-MTP binds
  to a cell surface receptor and induces signal transduction which interferes with
  the p38 MAPK activation pathway. The dotted lines denote a hypothetic view. As the
  5-MTP receptor has not been isolated and characterized, further studies are needed
  to provide evidence to support this hypothesis. Up arrows denote upregulation whereas
  down arrows, downregulation.
