caption: 'Ubiquitin regulation of TLR signaling. In response to MyD88- and TRIF-dependent
  TLR signals, TRAF6 undergoes self-ubiquitination and RIP1 is ubiquitinated by Peli1,
  an E3 ligase that is activated via its phosphorylation by IRAK1 and TBK1 or IKKε.
  It is generally thought that K63-linked ubiquitin chains conjugated to TRAF6 and
  RIP1 facilitate the recruitment and activation of TAK1 and IKK, which requires the
  ubiquitin-binding proteins TAB2 (or TAB3) and NEMO. Activated IKK and MAPKs (downstream
  of TAK1) mediate activation of NF-κB c-Rel and RelA, and members of the AP1 family,
  which together with TRAF6-stimulated IRF5 transactivate a variety of proinflammatory
  cytokine genes. As discussed in the text, this signaling model requires further
  modifications, since some parts are not supported by knockout mouse studies. TLR
  signaling is subject to control by negative regulators, one of which is TRAF3 that
  negatively regulates TLR-stimulated proinflammatory signaling by two possible mechanisms:
  interfering with the signaling function of the MyD88 complex and mediating degradation
  of IRF5 and c-Rel by forming an E3 complex with TRAF2 and cIAP. At least in the
  TLR4 signaling pathway, TRAF3 is targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation via
  a mechanism in which Peli1 either cooperates with TRAF6 or functions downstream
  of TRAF6 to mediate K63-linked ubiquitination and activation of cIAP, allowing the
  activated cIAP to conjugate K48-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF3. By mediating TRAF3
  degradation, Peli1 promotes proinflammatory TLR signaling.'
