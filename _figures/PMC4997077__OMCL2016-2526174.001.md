caption: Oxidative stress and mTORC1-mediated Treg cell differentiation. TGF-β and
  IL-2 can induce CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells expansion, and overproduction of IL-6 in SLE
  patients inhibits Foxp3 expression during Treg cell differentiation. Oxidative stress
  can promote increased production of leptin, nitric oxide, MHP, and enhanced Ca2+
  flux in lupus T cells, which can result in overexpression of mTORC1, and then inhibit
  the development of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells. UV exposure-mediated increased production
  of FICZ can activate AHR signaling pathway and then inhibit Foxp3 expression in
  SLE. Rapamycin can inhibit mTORC1 in Tregs and then it promoted Treg cell expansion.
