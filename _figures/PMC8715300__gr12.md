caption: Proposed anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of long-term low dose THC
  in the gingiva during HIV/SIV infection. During chronic HIV/SIV infection, high
  viral replication in the gingival lamina propria CD4+ T-cells and macrophages leads
  to increased production of proinflammatory mediators (CXCL10, MMP12), activation
  of IDO1 and concomitant downregulation of the anti-microbial enzyme DUOX1 and subsequent
  salivary dysbiosis. Elevated CXCL10 and MMP12 production can exacerbate disease
  severity by promoting periodontal bone loss and degrading the extracellular matrix.
  These changes together with reduced expression of gingival epithelial junction proteins
  like DSC3, can facilitate translocation of microbes and their products into the
  systemic circulation, thereby, driving chronic systemic immune activation. Concurrent
  administration of cannabinoids (Δ9-THC) can preserve DUOX1 by blocking miR-125a-5p
  upregulation and reduce IDO1 protein expression in the apical epithelium via a CB2R-mediated
  mechanism. In this way, low dose cannabinoids can strengthen oral mucosal defenses
  and concurrently halt the progression of periodontal disease by blocking the upregulation
  of CXCL10 and MMP12. By inhibiting inflammation, THC can reduce salivary dysbiosis
  by preserving the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and reducing
  the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Porphyromonas cangingivalis, Porphyromonas
  macacae). Furthermore, THC can produce a probiotic-like effect by preserving the
  relative abundance of oral commensal bacteria like Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria
  that can directly compete and inhibit the growth of oral pathogenic bacteria by
  producing bacteriocins.
