caption: Role of CYP2A6 in the metabolic pathway of nicotine.Up to 80% of a nicotine
  dose inhaled from cigarette smoke undergoes metabolic inactivation to cotinine.
  CYP2A6 is responsible for approximately 90% of nicotine’s inactivation to cotinine.
  The majority of cotinine is then further metabolized to 3′hydroxycotinine, in a
  reaction mediated wholly by CYP2A6. The ratio of these two metabolites, 3′hydroxycotinine/cotinine,
  known as the nicotine metabolite ratio or NMR, serves as a biomarker of CYP2A6 activity.
  Faster CYP2A6 activity is reflected by a higher NMR.
