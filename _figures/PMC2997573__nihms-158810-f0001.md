caption: Schematic representation of the current understanding of PELP1 signaling
  pathway. PELP1 appears to function as a scaffolding protein that facilitates formation
  of various signaling complexes and its expression is deregulated in hormonal cancers.
  PELP1 regulates multiple signaling pathways including ER-genomic signaling by facilitating
  epigenetic changes, ER-nongenomic signaling by activating Src-MAPK pathway, local
  estrogen synthesis via ERRα - aromatase signaling and cell cycle progression via
  pRb/E2F pathway. PELP1 deregulation in hormonal tumors is likely to contribute to
  the development of tumorigenesis, metastasis and hormonal independence by activating
  multiple signaling pathways and by facilitating ER signaling cross talk. Insert
  in the middle shows PELP1 expression in advanced breast tumors as analyzed by IHC.
