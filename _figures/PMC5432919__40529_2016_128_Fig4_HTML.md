caption: Unigenes predicted to be involved in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis
  pathway. Green indicates genes with significantly decreasing expression; white indicates
  genes that were not identified in the expression profile analysis; blue indicates
  genes predicted to be involved in the pathway. HAs seedlings of Panax notoginseng
  stressed by arsenic (40 mg L−1 Na2HAsO4·7H2O) for 14 days. CK seedlings for control
papertitle: Illumina-based transcriptomic profiling of Panax notoginseng in response
  to arsenic stress.
