caption: The domain structure of SPAK and the phosphorylation target sites on NKCC1
  and KCC3. OSR1 lack the P/A rich (PAPA) domain that is present in SPAK. The figure
  depicts small molecule inhibitors that target the WNK-SPAK-CCC signaling pathway
  and their sites of actions. STOCK1S-50699 and STOCK2S-26016 operate through binding
  to the CCT domain consequently blocking the interaction between SPAK/OSR1 and WNK.
  STOCK1S-14279, Closantel, Rafoxanide, Verteporfin, and 20l bind the T233E residue
  on SPAK that is constitutively active or WNK-sensitive. WNK463 and PP121 that inhibit
  WNKs catalytic activity. HK01, an inhibitor of the mouse protein-25 (M025). Bumetanide,
  ARN23746 and STS66 are NKCC1 antagonists. Furosemide is a KCC3 inhibitor. ZT-1a
  is a specific SPAK inhibitor. CCCs, cation-chloride cotransporters; NKCC1, K+-Cl−
  cotransporters; KCC3, K+-Cl− cotransporter 3; WNK, with-no-lysine kinase; SPAK,
  STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine rich kinase; OSR1, oxidative stress response
  kinase.
