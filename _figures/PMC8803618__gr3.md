caption: Role of the microbiota in GI carcinogenesis. (A) A HFD impacts microbiota
  composition resulting in Clostridium abundance and Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and
  Shigella depletion and acceleration in esophageal tumor development. The oral P
  gingivalis pathogen alters the esophageal mucosal environment, resulting in epithelial
  mesenchymal transition induction and enhanced metabolic glucose uptake. (B) Gastric
  colonization of INS-GAS (insulin-gastrin) mice with an intestinal flora (including
  Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides species) in combination with H pylori
  infection induced a strong inflammation as characterized by an increased expression
  of IL11 and the cancer-related genes Ptger4 and Tgf-β and the development of spasmolytic
  polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), possibly mediated by the yes-associated
  protein 1 (YAP1)., ,  In GC, a HFD induces gastric dysbiosis (characterized by increased
  Lactobacillus abundance), intestinal metaplasia, the expression of leptin, phosphorylated
  leptin receptor and STAT3 and intracellular β-catenin accumulation., (C) In the
  context of CRC, certain microbes such as pks + E coli, P anaerobius, and B fragilis
  are able to produce toxins that can influence carcinogenic processes. These include
  the induction of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway and proinflammatory responses,
  TLR interaction, impairment of the antitumor T-cell response, nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB), and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, further promoting cell proliferation.,
