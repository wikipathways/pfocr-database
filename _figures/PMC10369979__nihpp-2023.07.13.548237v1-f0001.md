caption: A hairpin-shaped oligonucleotide, named Svg3, is engineered to selectively
  activate cGAS, and thereby eliciting type I IFN responses in mouse and human cells.
  Svg3 is readily loaded into well-established nanocarriers for efficient delivery
  into cells and, upon endosome escape, into cytosol where Svg3 binds to cytosolic
  cGAS. This results in cGAS-Svg3 phase separation and the formation of cGAS-Svg3
  liquid-like droplets, in which cGAS is activated by Svg3 to trigger the activation
  of cGAS-STING signaling pathway and IFN-I responses. In tumor microenvironment,
  Svg3-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) reduced tumor immunosuppression and enhanced antitumor
  immunity. Intratumoral vaccination of Svg3 NPs dramatically potentiated the tumor
  immunotherapeutic efficacy of ICB in multiple syngeneic murine tumor models. Moreover,
  as an immunostimulant adjuvant co-loaded with peptide antigens in NPs (Svg3 + antigen)
  NPs, Svg3 potentiated the immunogenicity of peptide antigens to elicit antigen-specific
  T cell responses for potent tumor combination immunotherapy
