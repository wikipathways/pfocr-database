caption: 'Schematic representation of the cytosolic sensing of BRSV by RIG-I, MDA-5,
  and NOD2. Left: BRSV binding and entry into the host cell, followed by the release
  of viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into the cytoplasm. Middle: Viral RNA, originating
  both from the initial virion and from subsequent viral replication intermediates,
  is recognized by cytosolic sensors. RIG-I detects viral dsRNA and ssRNA with 5′-triphosphate
  groups; MDA-5 recognizes long dsRNA typically produced during viral replication;
  and NOD2 specifically senses ssRNA. Upon binding to their respective viral RNA ligands,
  RIG-I, MDA-5, and NOD2 undergo conformational changes, triggering downstream signaling
  pathways. All three sensors signal through the MAVS. MAVS then activates two key
  signaling cascades: the TRAF6-IKK and TBK1/IKKε pathways. TRAF6-IKK activation leads
  to NF-κB signaling, while TBK1/IKKε activation leads to the phosphorylation and
  activation of IRF3. Right: Once activated, NF-κB and IRF3 translocate to the nucleus,
  where they promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of type I
  IFNs, respectively, which play a crucial role in establishing an antiviral state.
  Abbreviations: BRSV = bovine respiratory syncytial virus; ssRNA = single-stranded
  RNA; dsRNA = double-stranded RNA; TRAF6 = tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-receptor-associated
  factor 6; NFκB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells;
  IFNs = interferons; MAVS = mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; IKKε = inhibitor
  of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase ε; TBK1 = TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1); IRF3 =
  interferon regulatory factor 3; NOD2 = nucleotide oligomerization domain 2; RIG-I
  = retinoic acid-inducible gene I; MDA-5 = melanoma differentiation-associated protein
