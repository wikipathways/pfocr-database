caption: The regulatory mechanism of NLRC3. (A) The TRAF6 and IRAK1 activation upon
  LPS stimulation further activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. NLRC3 prevents the
  K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and promotes the degradation of TRAF6 through
  proteasome, or NLRC3 promotes the K48-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 and promotes
  the degradation of IRAK1 through proteasome. (B) Upon the Bacteria, Virus infection
  and c-di-GMF stimulation, the DNA binding to LRR domain of NLRC3 increased the activation
  of ATPase on the NBD domain of NLRC3, prevented the association of NLRC3 and STING
  and inhibited the STING/TBK1 signaling pathway. IQGAP1 interacted with NLRC3, promoted
  NLRC3 to bind with STING and TBK1, and further enhanced the inhibitory effect of
  NLRC3 on STING/TBK1 signaling pathway. All further attenuates the production of
  type I interferon (I-IFN), preventing the inflammatory response of macrophages.
  (C) NLRC3 interacts with ASC and pro-CASP1 through the NBD domain, then prevents
  the formation of the inflammasome, and makes cells stay away from pyroptosis. (D)
  NLRC3 interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K, then inhibits the interaction of p85
  submit and catalytic submit p110α, preventing the phosphorylation and activation
  of the p110α submit, which blocks the transmission of downstream signals, including
  PI3K-AKT-mTOR and PI3K-AKT-FoxO3a/FoxO1 signaling pathways; P62 interacting with
  TRAF6 induced the activation of mTOR, NLRC3 prevents the K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of TRAF6, and negatively regulates the mTOR signaling pathway and prevents cell
  proliferation. (E) NLRC3 interacts with HSP90 to inhibit HSP90-mediated ubiquitination
  of P53 and inhibit the degradation of P53 in lysosomes.
