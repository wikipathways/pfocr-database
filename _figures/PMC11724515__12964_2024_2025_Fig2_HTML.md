caption: 'The specific mechanism by which Sirtuins regulate the occurrence of osteoporosis.
  Nicotinamide activates SIRT1, increases SOD2 and decreases ROS, preventing bone
  loss. Resveratrol and thistle upregulate SIRT1 and promote bone formation through
  the Wnt signaling pathway. SIRT2 could down-regulate the expression of c-Fos and
  NFATc1 and inhibit the differentiation of BMDMs into osteoclasts, or up-regulate
  LRG1 to reduce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and inhibit osteoclast differentiation.
  SIRT3 enhances the activity of SOD2, promotes ATP production and osteoblast differentiation
  by PGC-1a/SOD2 signaling pathway. SIRT6 affects bone formation by affecting Runx2,
  Osx, ALP and OPG. SIRT7 promotes the depropionylation of Osx by SIRT1 and SIRT7
  influences bone formation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Abbreviation:
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD2, superoxide dismutase 2; bone marrow-derived
  monocytes, BMDMs; LRG1, α−2 glycoprotein 1; OPG, osteoprotegerin; ALP, alkaline
  phosphatase (https://gdp.renlab.cn/#/)'
