caption: The regulatory mechanism of cis-9, trans-11 CLA on milk fat synthesis. Once
  invaded by LPS, the homeostasis of mammary gland epithelial cells is disrupted,
  thereby affecting milk fat synthesis. Cis-9, trans-11 CLA alleviates oxidative stress
  by inhibiting the transcription factor Nrf2 and its target gene HMOX1 pathway. Further
  validation is conducted to weaken the occurrence of autophagy through the ROS-Nrf2-p62
  autophagy signaling pathway. This process is accompanied by upregulation of transcription
  factors SREBP and PPARG, and gene expression related to downstream milk fat synthesis
