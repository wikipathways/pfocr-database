caption: Curcuminoids biosynthetic pathway constructed in E. coli. Two molecules of
  CoA esters (coumaroyl-CoA or/and feruloyl-CoA) and one molecule of malonyl-CoA are
  needed to produce one molecule of curcuminoid (bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin
  or curcumin). TAL, tyrosine ammonia lyase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; COMT,
  caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate-CoA ligase; DCS, diketide-CoA synthase; CURS, curcumin synthase. Adapted
