caption: Model depicting the circadian regulation of DNL by chronic cold exposure.
  In response to chronic cold stimulation, mTORC1 pathway is activated and triggers
  SREBP activity, as previously described (–). In parallel, chronic cold shift-advances
  REV-ERBα expression to the light phase and remodels its cistrome, targeting SREBP
  and DNL gene induction. Continuous activation of SREBP by mTORC1 combined with its
  circadian inhibition by REV-ERB results in the circadian expression of SREBP and
  DNL genes, which maximize thermogenic capacity and maintain body temperature during
  the light phase and fasting.
