caption: Schematic presentation of the ATM-NF-κB connection in adaptive radioresistance.
  In chronic response (cells with pre-irradiation), ATM interacts directly with NF-κB
  subunits p65 and p50, resulting in the induction of both activity and expression
  of NF-κB. This event causes the interaction of p65 with MEK/ERK, resulting MEK/ERK
  inhibition. Therefore, ATM-mediated negative regulation of NF-κB on MEK/ERK pathway
  may cause increased cell survival under the genotoxic conditions of a long-term
  therapeutic irradiation.
