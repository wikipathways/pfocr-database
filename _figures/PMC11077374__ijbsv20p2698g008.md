caption: The role of FOXO3-FOXM1 axis in regulating drug resistance in pancreatic
  cancer. A variety of ABC transporters are the target genes of FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXM1,
  which can make pancreatic cancer cells resistant to multiple drugs. During FOXM1
  deubiquitination, FAT10 competitively binds with ubiquitin to inhibit FOXM1's ubiquitination,
  while UCHL3 can deubiquitinate the ubiquitinated FOXM1, both of which reduce the
  sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. PHB1 is a downstream factor
  of FOXM1, which can activate the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway to generate a positive
  feedback loop and lead to the development of paclitaxel resistance. MiR-223 targets
  FOXO3 to acquire CDDP resistance in cancer cells. cGMP inhibited FOXO3 and affected
  the CSC phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells through the FOXO3/LKB1/AMPK/PGC-1β/PDHA1/CD44
  axis. FOXO3 can maintain CD44 expression and make CSC acquire drug resistance
