caption: 'Sgk1 is induced by IL-23R signaling and is a substrate of PDK1 kinase a
  member of the IL-23R signaling pathway, which also includes Akt a kinase homologous
  to SGK1. IL-23R signaling transcriptionally induces SGK1 which in turn further induces
  IL-23R expression by inhibiting Foxo-1. Deactivation by Sgk1 of Foxo and possibly
  also Foxo3, de-represses IL-23R transcription, and deactivates Foxo1 transcription.
  Foxo-1 also induces its own transcription and promotes Foxp3-mediated Treg development
  by acting as a placeholder for Foxp3 for loading onto genomic sites for transcription.
  Tgfβ3, but not Tgfβ1/2 contains the Foxo1 and Foxo3 binding motifs in its promoter
  region, suggesting that TGF-β3 is specifically regulated by the Sgk1-Foxo axis.
  Edges represent interactions between molecules. “p”: phosphorylation. “TR”: transcriptional
  regulation.'
