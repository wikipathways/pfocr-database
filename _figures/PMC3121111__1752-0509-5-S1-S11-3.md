caption: The human hyperuricemia metabolic pathway. Only the chemical transformations
  of main metabolites are shown here. The corresponding detailed reactions can be
  found in Additional file . In this figure, metabolites are represented by small
  circles. Reactions are the directed edges. Enzymes catalyzing reactions are represented
  by rectangles and put on the corresponding edges.
