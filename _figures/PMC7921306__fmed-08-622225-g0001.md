caption: Genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid genomic
  pathway is mediated through the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (cGR) leading
  to the mechanisms of gene transactivation and transrepression. The non-genomic pathway
  is mediated through the membrane glucocorticoid receptor (mGR), inhibition of the
  phospholipase A2, and changes in cell membranes. The arrow in the left depicts the
  dose of prednisone required to activate these pathways. The upper and lower gray
  zones represent the doses were genomic (lower gray zone) and non-genomic (upper
  gray zone) are fully saturated without added benefit and with higher incidence of
  adverse effects. mGR, membrane glucocorticoid receptor; PLA2, phospholipase A2;
  cGR, cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element;
  Hsp70·HOP·Hsp90, multiprotein complex including chaperones such as heat shock proteins
  and the glucocorticoid receptor; Hsp90·FKBP52·p23, multiprotein complex including
  chaperones, co-chaperones, and the glucocorticoid receptor.
