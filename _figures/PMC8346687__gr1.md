caption: 'Engineering of raspberry-ketone production in Nicotiana tabacum. Phenylpropanoid
  pathway that leads to the production of anthocyanins and raspberry-ketone. Overexpression
  of benzalacetone synthase (BAS) and raspberry ketone/zingerone synthase 1 (RZS1;
  pink lines) induces the production of high amounts of raspberry ketone and its derivatives
  in transgenic tobacco. Co-expression of the PAP1 transcription factor (green lines)
  and RNAi-mediated suppression of chalcone synthase (CHSir; orange lines) increase
  the levels of raspberry ketone. Dashed lines indicate the putative pathways. Abbreviations:
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this
  article.)'
