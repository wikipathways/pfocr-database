caption: The BMP signaling pathway in ISC regulation. BMP signaling contains a complex
  formation of different type 1 and type 2 receptors for serine/threonine kinase activity.
  Noggin and Gremlin are extracellular inhibitors of BMP. After ligand binding to
  the receptor and entry into the cell, firstly, the downstream molecules of BMP signaling,
  SMAD1/5/8, are phosphorylated by ALK2/3/6 and ALK1, and then BMP signaling is highly
  activated by the phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8. Of these, SMAD6/7, particularly SMAD6,
  is involved in inhibiting phosphorylation and signaling, which inhibits ALK3/6-mediated
  signaling. Finally, phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 aggregates with Smad4 and continues
  to signal, accumulating in the nucleus and regulating target gene transcription.
