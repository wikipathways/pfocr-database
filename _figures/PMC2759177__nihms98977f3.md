caption: Survival signals generated by PI3K and PLD that target mTOR. In the PI3K
  pathway, PIP3 recruits Akt and PDK1, a kinase that phosphorylates Akt at Thr308.
  Akt is also phosphorylated at Ser 473 by mTORC2. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473
  elevates Akt kinase activity [] and likely impacts substrate specificity []. Akt
  then phosphorylates several proteins that suppress cell cycle progression – including
  the TSC1/2 complex, a GTPase activating protein complex that suppresses the GTPase
  Rheb []. Rheb has been reported to stimulate dissociation of FKBP38 from FRB domain
  of mTOR [], which contributes to the activation of mTORC1. Rheb was also recently
  reported to activate PLD1 []. PLD-generated PA competes with rapamycin to bind mTORC1
  – and possibly FKBP38 – and is required for the mTOR activation of S6 kinase. PLD
  is also required for the activation of mTORC2, which phosphorylates Akt at Ser473.
  mTOR is targeted by growth factors, nutrition and energy sensing signals – indicated
  by different colors.
