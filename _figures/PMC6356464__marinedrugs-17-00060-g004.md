caption: 'Proposed biogenesis of pyrroloiminoquinones in marine sponges originating
  from tryptophan. Dashed arrows represent possible alternative reaction pathways.
  Shaded backgrounds indicate structures predominantly identified in organic extracts
  of T. favus type I in blue and type II in red. Variable substituents are drawn in
  grey. TDC: tyrosine decarboxylase; PAH: phenylalanine hydroxylase. The proposed
  biosynthetic pathway in T. favus has been adapted from various authors [,,,] and
  modified for relevance to this study.'
