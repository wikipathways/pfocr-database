caption: Overview of the regulatory mechanisms of BLACAT1 on proliferation, invasion,
  metastasis, tumor cell cycle control, apoptosis, autophagy, and chemoresistance
  in multiple human cancers. (A) BLACAT1 binds to miR-605-3p to upregulate VASP, and
  it also promotes EMT by activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (B) BLACAT1 regulates
  ATG7 by competitively binding to miR-17, and ATG7 overexpression leads to autophagy
  and chemoresistance; BLACAT1 also facilitates chemoresistance by modulating STAT3
  phosphorylation; in addition, BLACAT1 regulates cell cycle by sponging miR-144 and
  promotes EMT by activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (C) BLACAT1 competes against miR-485-5p.
  (D) BLACAT1 activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway, reduces G0/G1 arrest, and upregulates
  N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin. (E) BLACAT1 facilitates the STAT3 phosphorylation,
  reduces G0/G1 arrest, and increases the expression of MMP2 and MMP9. (F) BLACAT1
  physically associates with PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12. (G) BLACAT1 represses
  p15 by binding to PRC2 to regulate cell cycle. (H) BLACAT1 upregulates ABCB1 by
  competitively binding to miR-361 to promote chemoresistance. (I) BLACAT1 binds to
  miR-150-5p to regulate CCR2. (J) BLACAT1 regulates EZH2 and represses E-cadherin
  to facilitate EMT.
