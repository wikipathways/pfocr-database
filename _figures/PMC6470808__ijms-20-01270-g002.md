caption: Proposed 5-HT1A receptor-mediated signaling pathway through which mGlu2/3
  receptor antagonists and ketamine exert their antidepressant effects. 5-HT release
  induced by mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists and ketamine as described in  stimulates
  postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). 5-HT1A receptor
  stimulation activates phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequently Akt, leading
  to activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1
  signaling increased synthesis of synaptic proteins such as GluA1 and PSD95, which
  induces synaptic plasticity. Increase in GluA1 synthesis persistently activates
  AMPA receptor transmission, which may also be involved in sustained antidepressant
  effects of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists and ketamine.
