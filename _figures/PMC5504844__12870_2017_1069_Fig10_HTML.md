caption: 'Simplified model showing the salicylate-jasmonate interplay in the bois
  noir disease of grapevine. Plants react to phytoplasma infection by salicylate-mediated
  signalling, failing to activate or antagonising the jasmonate-mediated defence response,
  which leads to the development of bois noir symptoms and disease (left panel). On
  the other hand, activation of the entire jasmonate signalling pathway, together
  with counteraction of salicylate signalling and action, inhibits the development
  of symptoms and phytoplasma disease, leading to recovery from bois noir (right panel).
