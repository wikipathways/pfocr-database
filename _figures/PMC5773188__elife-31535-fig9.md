caption: (A) A model of homeostatic feedback control inclusive of feedback for both
  PHP and PHD. The sign for modulation of presynaptic release is indicated. We speculate
  that signaling pathway cross-inhibition allows for either PHP (red) or PHD (blue)
  to be selectively induced. When mEPSP amplitudes are decreased (PhTX), this is detected
  by the sensor and differs from the synaptic set point, causing an error signal to
  be generated. The error is then relayed to a homeostatic ‘controller’ where the
  error is integrated and signaling is induced corresponding to the specific induction
  of either PHP (red) or PHD (blue). We propose that cross pathway inhibition at the
  level of the controller allows for the specific induction of either PHP or PHD.
  We propose that the ‘controller’ is organized within the PI3K and Rab11-depedent
  recycling endosomal signaling platform and that loss of this signaling platform
  leads to inappropriate induction of PHD in the presence of PhTX, causing a mechanistic
  clash at the level of the presynaptic terminal. (B) A model of the neuromuscular
  junction, highlighting mechanisms of PHP in red (increased calcium influx, increased
  RRP, and increased vesicle coupling) and PHD in blue, for which very little is understood
  mechanistically.
