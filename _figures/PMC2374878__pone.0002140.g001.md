caption: 'Case a (upper panel within the shaded box): the full pathway of the zero-order
  ultrasensitive switch studied by Goldbeter and Koshland. The protein R is phosphorylated
  and dephosphorylated by enzyme S and A respectively. The phosphorylated form RP
  represents the response and the enzyme S the signal. Case a2 (the entire upper panel):
  R and S form a loosely bound complex, then a tightly bound one preceding the phosphorylation
  step. Case b (lower panel, the shaded area is the same as case a): RS can bind another
  S molecule, which accelerate the phosphorylation reaction k 1.'
