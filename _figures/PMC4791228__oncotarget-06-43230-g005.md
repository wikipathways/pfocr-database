caption: Under inflammatory conditions, muscle cells show an upregulated surface expression
  of NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-L). CD8+NKG2Dhigh T cells (NKG2D++) are generated by the
  simultaneous reduction of soluble NKG2D ligands (sNKG2D-L) decreasing NKG2D internalization
  in CD8+ T cells together with IL-15 (predominantly membrane-associated) mediated
  stimulation by inflamed muscle cells. NKG2D-ligand engagement of CD8+NKG2Dhigh cells
  promotes IFNγ and TNFα production perpetuating the pro-inflammatory muscle environment
  and induces NKG2D-dependent/TCR-independent lysis of muscle cells. Of note, muscle-infiltrating
  CD68+ macrophages and CD4+ T cells might be further sources of IL-15 (not depicted).
