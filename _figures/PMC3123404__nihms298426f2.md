caption: Bidirectional transcription of an mRNA (on the right in red) and a ncRNA
  (on the left in blue) is depicted as an example. The dark blue box represents the
  protein-coding region. Transcription starts bidirectionally from the nucleosome-depleted
  region (NDR). Nucleosome density is represented by a beige pattern behind the genomic
  regions. Only a portion of the RNA polymerase II that assembles at the promoter
  will enter into early elongation. This entry is characterized by Ser5 phosphorylation
  of the polymerase CTD and chromatin modifications specific to transcription initiation
  and early elongation. Before transcribing further, the polymerase passes a “5’ checkpoint”
  where it pauses, terminates, or commits to productive elongation. If the polymerase
  does not proceed through this checkpoint, transcription will be terminated through
  the Nrd1 pathway, producing an unstable transcript. If the polymerase proceeds through
  the checkpoint, it will enter into productive elongation that is associated with
  characteristic chromatin modifications and CTD phosphorylation. Once RNA polymerase
  II has terminated transcription, final transcript abundance is determined by transcript
  stability. Bidirectional transcription is regulated at multiple steps following
  transcription initiation. The number of RNA polymerase II molecules that pass each
  of these steps, represented by red (sense) and blue (antisense) bars in the upper
  panel, decreases as they move further away from the promoter. All of these regulatory
  steps are differentially controlled for both orientations.
