caption: 'Stoichiometries of electron (red) and ATP (orange) requirements for the
  Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, and for the photorespiratory pathway where there
  are fractions of glycolate carbon that exits in the form of either glycine (α G),
  or CH2‐THF (α T), or serine (α S). The RuBP oxygenation to RuBP carboxylation ratio
  is denoted as ϕ. All these fluxes, also including carbon (in black) and nitrogen
  (in blue), are scaled in relation to the rate of RuBP carboxylation. The difference
  between CO2 taken up by carboxylation and CO2 released from photorespiration, shown
  in light grey boxes, equals the sum of individual sinks for assimilated carbon indicated
  by double‐bordered grey boxes (redrawn with permission from Busch, ). The amount
  of NO3− entering the leaf via de novo nitrogen assimilation equals the total flux
  of nitrogen leaving the pathway in the form of glycine and serine (α G + 2/3α S)ϕ.
  The stoichiometric coefficients for nitrogen assimilation are formulated from the
  understanding that (i) one mol nitrogen assimilation from nitrate (NO3−) into glutamate
  requires 10 mol electrons, including one mol NADH (equivalent to two electrons)
  for reducing NO3− to nitrite (NO2−), six electrons in the form of reduced ferredoxin
  for reducing NO2− to ammonia (NH4+), and two electrons again in the form of reduced
  ferredoxin for the glutamate synthesis from glutamine, and (ii) the formation step
  of one mol glutamine from NH4+ and glutamate also requires one mol ATP, which is
  the only ATP required for the whole process of NO3− reduction (Noctor & Foyer, ).
  Note that NADH released from the glycine decarboxylation in the mitochondrion, NADH
  used for transforming hydroxypyruvate into glycerate in the peroxisome, and NADH
  used for reducing NO3− to NO2− in the cytosol are all shown in the electron equivalents.
