caption: 'A simplified model for NHEJ and HR. When a DNA double-strand break (DSB)
  occurs during G1, it is repaired via NHEJ (right). This process involves the following
  steps: (1) the Ku70/80 heterodimer detects and binds to the DSB; (2) Ku70/80 bound
  to the DSB recruits DNA-PKcs; (3) DNA-PKcs undergoes autophosphorylation, favoring
  the processing of DNA ends by Artemis; and (4) the XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex ligates
  the processed DNA ends. Additional details regarding NHEJ can be found in refs (–).
  In contrast, when a DSB occurs during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, repair
  occurs preferentially via the HR pathway (left), which involves the following steps:
  (1) PARP1 binds to the DSB () and competes with Ku binding to DNA ends (); (2) the
  MRN complex is recruited () to the DSB (together with CtIP and BRCA1/BARD1) and
  mediates the initial stages of DSB resection; (3) extensive end resection is catalyzed
  by EXO1 and DNA2/BLM (, ), resulting in long stretches of ssDNA; (4) this ssDNA
  is coated by RPA; (5) the BRCA2/PALB2/BRCA1 complex facilitates replacement of RPA
  with Rad51 (, ); (6) RAD51 filaments induce strand invasion into homologous DNA
  sequences; (7) DNA polymerization occurs using the sister chromatid as a template;
  and (8) resolution of the resulting complexes produces an exact copy of the template
  where the DSB was generated. Additional details of the HR process can be found in
  Refs. (, , ).'
