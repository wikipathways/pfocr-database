caption: G12/13-RhoGEF-RhoA signalling pathway. GPCR-activated G12/13-proteins mediate
  translocation of RhoGEF from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and stimulate its
  GEF activity. RhoGEFs oligomerize in their inactive form, and active monomers bind
  via their RGS domains to active Gα12/13 at the plasma membrane. RhoGEF reveals GAP
  activity towards Gα12/13, and induces downstream activation of the monomeric GTPase
  RhoA. Active GTP-bound RhoA is released from its inhibitory protein RhoGDI, and
  anchors to the plasma membrane through its geranylgeranyl-residue. Downstream targets
  of RhoA include ROCK, which mediates cell contraction through inhibition of MLC
  phosphatase, and increased SRF-dependent gene transcription. GAP, GTPase-activating
  protein; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GEF, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GTP, guanosine triphosphate;
  MLC, myosin light chain; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; ROCK, Rho kinase;
  SRF, serum response factor.
