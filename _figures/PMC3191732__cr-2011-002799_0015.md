caption: (a) Biosynthetic pathway for 2-AG. PIP2 containing AA at the sn-2 position
  is hydrolyzed by PLC to yield DAG and IP3. DAG is then further hydrolyzed by MAG
  lipase to 2-AG. (b) Biosynthetic pathway for AEA. An arachidonoyl moiety is transferred
  from the sn-1 position of a phospholipid, in this case PC, to the amino group of
  PE by NAT. The resulting product NAPE is then hydrolyzed by NAPE-PLD to yield AEA
  and PA.
