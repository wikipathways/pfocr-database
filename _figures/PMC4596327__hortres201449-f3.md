caption: PAMPs activate PRRs. Boxes indicate the critical enzymes comprising the pathway.
  Enzymes colored in red or green indicate upregulated or downregulated genes, respectively.
  Genes in black are those with no differences in expression, whereas enzymes shown
  in black are those that were not identified in the present study. AVR, avirulence
  protein; BAK1, brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1; CNGC,
  cyclic nucleotide gated calcium channel; OG, oligogalacturonides; HR, hypersensitive
  response; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern-recognition
  receptor; RBOH, respiratory burst oxidase homolog; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  SA, salicylic acid; WAK1, wall-associated RPK.
