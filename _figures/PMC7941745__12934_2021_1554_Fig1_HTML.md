caption: Concept of enforced ATP wasting as metabolic engineering strategy (a) and
  its application to boost 2,3-BDO synthesis in the E.coli producer strain 445_Ediss
  ∆4 (b). The green gene names in b indicate the heterologous genes that were introduced
  in [] to enable 2,3-BDO synthesis. The green reactions indicate a balanced pathway
  for 2,3-BDO synthesis, which produces ATP and requires oxygen to balance NADH. Red
  crosses and the corresponding (red) gene names in b indicate the deleted pathways
  to alternative fermentation products in the 445_Ediss ∆4 strain as constructed [].
  With these deletions, ATP synthesis gets coupled with 2,3-BDO synthesis under microaerobic
  conditions as demanded by step 1 in (a). In this study, the F1-portion of the ATPase
  is added as wasting mechanism in this strain representing step 2 in (a)
