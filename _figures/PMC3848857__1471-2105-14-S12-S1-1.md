caption: An overview of constructing influential miRNA-GeneSignature interactions.
  A. miRNA gene signature is identified by transfecting cells with pre-miRNA and then
  identify gene down-regulated upon the transfection. B. Using the context-specific
  effects of miRNAs (genes affected by miRNAs directly and indirectly) to build functional
  associations between miRNAs and GeneSignatures via elastic-net regression model.
  This step sheds light on the functional associations between miRNA and pathways,
  miRNAs and diseases. It is also used as a miRNA enrichment method to identify miRNAs
  whose targets are enriched in gene lists. Using miRNA-gene networks and disease
  or pathway gene networks, the model predicts functional interactions between diseases
  and miRNAs or pathways and miRNAs.
