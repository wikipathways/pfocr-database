caption: Impacts of aerobic exercise, breath-hold diving, and exposure to altitude
  on the HO/CO pathway. The stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) responds
  to intense aerobic exercise and/or skeletal muscle microtrauma by (1) degrading
  heme that is released during tissue injury as a danger associated molecular pattern
  and (2) generating bioactive products that contribute to cell and tissue recovery.
