caption: Metabolic interactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. A lighter
  vegetative cell exchanges metabolites (thin lines) with a darker heterocyst bound
  by its characteristic thick envelope. The heterocyst has polar plugs at either end.
  Thick lines indicate metabolic pathways. The dotted line indicates a pathway whose
  existence is uncertain. Carbon dioxide is fixed in vegetative cells through the
  dark reactions of photosynthesis (PS), and the resulting triose is metabolized to
  pyruvate through the partial tricarboxylic acid cycle to isocitrate and then via
  IDH to α-ketoglutarate (αKG). The α-ketoglutarate combines with glutamine (Gln)
  via glutamate synthase (GOGAT) to form glutamate (Glu). In heterocysts, carbohydrate
  from vegetative cells enters the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway to produce
  reductant (H:) used to support the activity of nitrogenase (Nase) to produce ammonium
  and concurrently yield α-ketoglutarate. Ammonium combines with glutamate, derived
  from the vegetative cell, through a reaction catalyzed by GS to form Gln. These
  reactions (if confirmed) should serve to reduce the level of α-ketoglutarate in
  the vegetative cell (small type) and increase it in heterocysts (large type). See
  the text for a discussion of the proposed cellular levels of α-ketoglutarate.
