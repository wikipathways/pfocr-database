caption: Broad modulation of host cell responses that impair innate immune functions.
  SARS-CoV-2 mediates host shutoff through the inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA)
  translation. Translation of viral RNA (vRNA) is favored in infected cells. Additional
  inhibition of antiviral responses is due to deficits in RNA maturation. SARS-CoV-2
  gene products block the splicing of host RNA. Similarly, the nuclear trafficking
  of transcription factors involved in the induction and response to interferon (IFN)
  and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is impaired. Sequestration of subunits of the nuclear
  pore complex, RAE1 and NUP68 prevent the nuclear import of transcription factors,
  IRF3 and STAT1. Blockade of nuclear export of IFN and ISG mRNA inhibits antiviral
  immunity. This can be partly achieved by inhibition of the nuclear RNA export factor
  1 (NFX1). Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 blocks the trafficking of proteins through the secretory
  pathway by inhibiting structural components of the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP).
