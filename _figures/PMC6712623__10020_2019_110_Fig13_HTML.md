caption: Schematic representation of the TGF-ß/Smad signalling pathway and the possible
  targets of tamoxifen (TAM) and rBMP7 to prevent PF development. TGF-ß1 binds to
  the transmembrane serine/threonine kinase cell surface receptor, initiating downstream
  signal transduction pathways by Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3). phosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  Smad2/3 forms heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which translocate to the nucleus
  to regulate the transcription of specific fibrogenic genes, and of Smad7, an intracellular
  antagonist of TGFβ/Smad signaling. Smad7 interacts with TGF-ß type I receptors,
  thereby causing receptor ubiquitination and degradation and inhibiting Smad2/3 phosphorylation.
  Therefore, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interaction with Smad4 is inhibited, providing
  a negative autoregulation of TGF-ß/Smad signaling. TAM binds to ER-α, which interacts
  with Smad3, preventing Smad3 phosphorylation. Blocking Smad3 phosphorylation halts
  downstream TGF-ß signaling and profibrotic factors synthesis. On the other hand,
  TAM directly increases Smad7 expression, contributing to the negative regulation
  of TGF-ß signaling. rBMP7 binds to BMP receptors, promoting phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8,
  which form complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate the expression
  of specific genes. BMP7 inhibits Smad3 DNA binding and induces Smad7 expression
  to exert negative regulation of TGF-ß pathway. TNF-α and other proinflammatory cytokines
  bind to their specific cell surface receptors and promote IκBα phosphorylation,
  which releases both p50/p65 NFκB subunits into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylated IκBα
  is degraded, and the NF-KB pathway is activated, with subsequent phosphorylation
  of the p65 subunit, which permits translocation of the subunit to the nucleus to
  regulate the expression of proinflammatory genes. Smad7 can block TNF-α and other
  proinflammatory cytokines signaling pathways by up-regulating IκB-α, expression,
  thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects
