caption: Involvement of lipids and other hydrophobic molecules in pollen sensitization.
  1) lipids may influence the transport of pollen allergens through respiratory epithelium
  by caveolar-dependent way; 2) lipids may affect the uptake rate of the allergen
  by DCs; 3) lipids may influence the rate of endolysosomal degradation in APCs; 4)
  pollen lipids act as chemoattractants and activators of granulocytes via upregulation
  of surface integrin CD11b; 5) inhibition of production of IL-12 by DCs via PPAR-γ
  dependent pathways, which leads to inhibition of NF-κB activation and results in
  reduced IL-12 production; 6) TLR ligands of pollen microbiome enhance Th1 and Th2
  responses and decrease induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells; 7) microbial lipids
  induce maturation of immature DCs, which leads to expression of costimulatory CD80
  and CD86 on DCs; 8) pollen-derived lipids upregulate CD1d and CD86 molecules on
  DCs; 9) DCs activate iNKT cells through a CD1d-dependent pathway. DC, dendritic
  cells; iNKT, invariant natural killer T cells; TLR, toll-like receptor. Figure was
