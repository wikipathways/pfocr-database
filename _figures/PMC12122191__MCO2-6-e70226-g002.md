caption: 'The role of nonhistone lactylation in cancer progression and chemoresistance.
  This schematic diagram illustrates the effects of nonhistone lactylation on key
  cancer‐related proteins, including p53, YAP, NBS1, and MRE11, highlighting its role
  in cancer progression and chemoresistance. The lactylation of p53 reduces phase
  separation, leading to decreased p53 activity. As a tumor suppressor, reduced p53
  activity contributes to cancer progression. n: Lactylation of YAP enhances its protein
  stability, leading to increased YAP activity. YAP is a key effector in the Hippo
  signaling pathway, and its activation promotes cancer progression. The lactylation
  of NBS1 enhances its DNA‐binding ability, facilitating homologous recombination‐mediated
  DNA damage repair. This process contributes to cancer cell survival and chemoresistance.
  The lactylation of MRE11 enhances DNA end resection, promoting DNA damage repair
  through homologous recombination. This mechanism supports cancer cell survival under
  therapeutic stress, leading to chemoresistance'
