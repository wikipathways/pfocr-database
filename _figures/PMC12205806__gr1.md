caption: 'Part 1: The process of HBV infection and replication in cells: (A) HBV enters
  the liver cell via fusion and endocytosis. (B, C) The HBV genome is released into
  the cytoplasm and delivered to the nucleus. (D–F) Host proteins repair gaps in rcDNA
  to form cccDNA, which is transcribed into various RNAs, translating diverse proteins
  such as HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg, and HBx. (G–J) The multiple components assemble into
  an intact HBV released outside the cell. Part 2: The influence of proteins from
  HBV in HCC tumorigenesis: (A) Wnt combines with LRP and the frizzled receptor to
  inhibit the function of the Axin/APC/CK1α/GSK-3β complex by interacting with Dishevelled.
  The Axin/APC/CK1α/GSK-3β complex cannot phosphorylate β-catenin to promote its decomposition.
  (B) HBx mediates epigenetic modifications of RNAs, such as circRNAs. (C) HBx activates
  TCF in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (D) HBx boosts RNA replication. (E,
  F) RNAs participate in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and activate the pathway.
  (G–I) HBx represses the function of the Axin/APC/CK1α/GSK-3β complex; therefore,
  β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus. (J) HBsAg increases
  the expression of LEF. (K, S) Multiple mechanisms facilitate the combination of
  β-catenin and TCF/LEF, regulating gene expression to promote the proliferation,
  drug resistance, and stemness of HBV-HCC cells. (L–R) The products, such as HBsAg,
  HBeAg, HBcAg, and HBx, from the HBV-infected HCC cells increase the expression of
  PD-1, CD244, CTLA4, IL-10, and PD-L1, and decrease the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α,
  and activating receptors on many immune cells. Part 3: Four stages of HBV-HCC development:
  The process by which a healthy liver becomes HBV-HCC includes the following four
  stages: uninfected liver, chronic hepatitis B infection, cirrhosis, and HBV-HCC;
  however, a healthy liver does not progress to cirrhosis in all patients. HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; HBV, hepatitis B virus; rcDNA, relaxed circular DNA; cccDNA, covalently
  closed circular DNA; HBeAg, hepatitis B virus e antigen; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface
  antigen; HBcAg, hepatitis B core antigen; HBx, HBV x protein; PD-1, programmed death-1;
  CTLA4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4; IL-10, interleukin 10; PD-L1,
  programmed cell death ligand 1; IFN-γ, interferon-gamma; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor
  alpha; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; Axin, Axis inhibition
  protein; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid
  enhancer factor'
