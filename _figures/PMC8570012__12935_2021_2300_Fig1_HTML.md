caption: 'Roles of MSCs in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. MSCs are
  well known for homing to tumor sites, where they play crucial roles in cancer parthenogenesis
  and therapeutic resistance. Several factors are involved in the process, such as
  SDF-1α, MMP-2, CXCR1 and CCL8. Proliferation: mediators (i.e., PGE2, lactate and
  TGF-β1) secreted by anti-inflammatory MSCs inhibited tumor cell death to further
  support tumor growth. Metastasis: MSCs are able to transform into CSCs or CAFs,
  which drives tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, several factors (i.e., CCL5, TGF-β and
  IFN-γ) produced by MSCs induced EMT, which contributed to metastasis. Apoptosis:
  several chemokines (i.e., VEGF, bFGF, PDGF and TGF-β) by MSCs recruited immune cells
  to tumor sites, thereby inducing anticancer immunity. In contrast, MSCs reduced
  cancer cell growth via paracrine inhibition of AKT and Wnt signaling pathways, which
  contribute to cancer cell proliferation. Immunosuppression: MSCs inhibited the anti-tumor
  immune response, including innate and adaptive immune responses. In adaptive immune
  responses, MSCs elicited Th2-polarized immune response, and indirectly triggered
  the development of Treg cells. Moreover, MSCs inhibited antigen triggered immunoglobulin
  release and slowed B cell proliferation. In innate immune responses, MSCs inhibited
  IFN-γ production in NK cells, and DCs maturation and function. Moreover, MSC induced
  a transition from inflammatory M1 macrophages to a pro-tumorigenic alternatively
  activated M2 state. In addition, trained neutrophils acquired immunosuppressive
  activity. Angiogenesis: MSCs secreted angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF, HIF1α and
  βFGF) to promote angiogenesis, which contributes to cancer progression. Therapeutic
  resistance: paracrine or systematically secreting molecules (i.e., PIFAs, IL-6,
  EGF and IGF) by MSCs reduced tumor cell death, thereby inducing therapeutic resistance.
  In contrast, MSCs also suppress cancer pathogenesis and sensitize cancer cells to
  therapy by blocking the STAT3 pathway. MSCs support the CSC niche to further promote
  resistance to therapeutics, including CXCL7 and IL-6. In addition, several tumor
  suppressor genes in MSCs, such as RassF1A and HIC1, were methylated, thus indicating
  that MSCs transform into CSCs. Notably, tumor cells released IL-1, which induced
  MSCs to secrete several mediators (i.e., IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL1). These mediators
  together induce the formation of CSCs. Furthermore, MSCs significantly increased
  CXCL10 expression, which further promoted CSC proliferation when the CXCL10 receptor
  (CXCR3) was overexpressed on CSCs. As a result, they altogether increased tumor
  growth and enhanced therapeutic resistance'
