caption: After interacting with CD154, CD40 recruits and interacts with several adapter
  proteins, including TRAF1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. The accumulated signaling of TRAFs leads
  to the activation of canonical NF-κB and noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways.
  The noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway involves the processing of p100 and the
  nuclear translocation of the p52 and RelB heterodimers. TRAF3 is constitutively
  associated with NIK, leading to its degradation by the proteasome, and CD40 signaling
  causes TRAF3 degradation and activation of NIK as well as the downstream noncanonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway. TRAF3 also functions as a resident nuclear protein via
  association with the transcriptional regulator CREB and Mcl-1. In comparison, the
  activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway involves the degradation of
  IκBα and the nuclear translocation of the p50 and RelA heterodimers. Overall, CD40
  signaling activates MAPKs and PI3K. The activation of the CD154-CD40 axis results
  in several events, including cytokine production, immunoglobulin gene switching,
  prevention of B-cell apoptosis, increased expression of costimulatory molecules
  such as CD80 and CD86, germinal center formation, production of high-affinity antibodies
  and formation of B memory cells. TRAF, TNF receptor (TNFR)-associated factor; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-kappaB; IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κB; CREB, cAMP response element binding
  protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinases.
