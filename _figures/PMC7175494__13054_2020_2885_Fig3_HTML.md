caption: Brain–heart sympathetic pathway at the molecular level. The “fight or flight”
  response of catecholaminergic storm, followed by hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis and autonomic activation, is represented at the molecular level. Synaptic connection
  through neurons and myocytes is represented. Noradrenaline activates β1 receptors,
  which in turn activates cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A (cAMP–PKA)
  signaling, with consequent release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum for cell
  contraction. At the same time, noradrenaline activates β2 receptors, which, acting
  through the protein kinase B (Akt)-FOXO pathway, decrease protein degradation by
  ubiquitin, thus regulating cardiomyocyte proteostatic equilibrium and cardiac mass
  maintenance with muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-1), which is upregulated in the deficient
  heart. FOXO, forkhead box O; Akt, protein kinase B; PKA, protein kinase A; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate, ATP, adenosine triphosphate; MuRF-1, muscle ring
  finger-1. Modified from "Martini FH. Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology. 8th
  ed. 2006. Chapter 20"
