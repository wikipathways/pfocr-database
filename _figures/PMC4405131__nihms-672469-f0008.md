caption: Our data suggest that Carma1 and MALT1 participate in the TCR-dependent activation
  of mTOR downstream of PKC. The other CBM component, Bcl10, seems to be dispensable
  for this pathway, although it is possible that another protein substitutes for Bcl10
  in mediating an association between Carma1 and MALT1 (indicated by the oval with
  a question mark). See the Discussion for more details.
