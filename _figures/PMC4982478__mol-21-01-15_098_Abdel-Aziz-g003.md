caption: Pathway analysis reveals that most highly regulated inflammatory mediators
  are associated with the TREM-1 signaling pathway. The preprogrammed TREM-1 signaling
  pathway was merged with the preprogrammed genes known to be highly modulated during
  esophagitis (Ingenuity Systems 2014). This dataset was overlaid with the real gene
  expression array data obtained from the esophageal tissue of the different experimental
  groups to identify modulated genes. The red color indicates the upregulation of
  a particular gene expression, and the green color indicates downregulation. The
  intensity of the color signifies the magnitude of regulation. Grey color indicates
  no gene modulation. For a better overview, genes that were not modulated in any
  of the groups were removed from the pathway. The figure shows gene expression of
  the esophagitis group compared with the sham-operated group (A), the STW5- treated
  (0.5 and 2 mL/kg, respectively) groups in comparison to the esophagitis group (B,
  C) and the omeprazole-treated (30 mg/kg) group in comparison to the esophagitis
  group (D).
