caption: Fatty acids promote NLRC3 expression to inhibit the STING pathway, thereby
  inducing exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, and mediate CCL9/CCR9 to enhance the immunosuppressive
  function of MDSCs; overexpression of SLC1A5 is associated with reduced immunohistochemical
  scores of related immune cells; inhibition of A2AR may decrease the number of Treg
  cells and promote antitumor immune responses of CD8+ T cells
