caption: The figure demonstrates PPARγ and its relation to signaling pathways. The
  panel A shows PPARγ as the molecular switch between adipogenesis and osteogenesis;
  B demonstrates the mechanism by which PPARγ agonists target the methodical inhibition
  of osteoblastogenesis and initiation of osteoclastogenesis; and C denotes the important
  helices H3, H4/5, H11 and H12 targeted by agonists and antagonists of PPARγ and
  in addition to them the β-sheets which are targeted by partial agonists and inverse
  agonists
