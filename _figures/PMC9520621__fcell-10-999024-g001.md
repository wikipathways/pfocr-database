caption: Schematic diagram of classical proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) within the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways. The APP is
  initially cleaved by α and β-secretases, respectively. In the classic amyloidogenic
  processing pathway, APP is continuously cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase,
  resulting in insoluble Aβ deposition. In contrast, APP cleaved by α-secretases produces
  a truncated Aβ peptide, which does not aggregate and has no neurotoxicity.
