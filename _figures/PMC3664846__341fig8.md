caption: Mechanism of cargo recruitment during the Cvt pathway. Shortly after synthesis,
  prApe1 forms dodecamers that subsequently self-assemble in a larger oligomer that
  has been called the prApe1 complex. Association with the Atg19 autophagy receptor
  and oligomers of Ams1 (and additional cargo proteins) leads to the generation of
  the Cvt complex. The subsequent interaction between Atg19 and the autophagy adaptor
  Atg11 allows the movement of the Cvt complex within proximity of the vacuole through
  a mechanism that requires actin filaments and the Arp2/3 complex. This relocalization,
  which probably also coordinates the trafficking of Atg9-positive membranes, participates
  in the formation of the PAS. At this site, the interaction between Atg19 and Atg8
  plays a key role in the sequestration of the Cvt complex into Cvt vesicles. One
  of the primary differences between selective and nonselective macroautophagy is
  that the sequestering vesicles of the former exclude bulk cytoplasm and contain
  primarily the targeted cargo. The electron micrographs depict the electron dense
  Cvt complex detected with antiserum to Ape1 (left) and a phagophore sequestering
  a Cvt complex marked with an antibody that detects GFP–Atg8 (right). The electron
  micrographs in this figure were modified from data previously published in  and
