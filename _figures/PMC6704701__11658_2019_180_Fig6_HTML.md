caption: Illustration of the mechanism of SOX2 promotion of breast cancer cell migration.
  SOX2 potentiates breast cancer cell migration under hypoxia by supporting NEDD9
  expression and leading to the activation of NEDD9 downstream effector HIF-1α signaling
  pathway. NEDD9 maintains HIF-1α protein stability under hypoxia, at least in part,
  in a Rac1-dependent manner
papertitle: SOX2 promotes hypoxia-induced breast cancer cell migration by inducing
  NEDD9 expression and subsequent activation of Rac1/HIF-1α signaling.
