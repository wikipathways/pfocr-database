caption: (A) Canonical BMP signaling pathway. Upon BMP binding to type II receptor
  (BMPRII), type I receptor BMPRI is phosphorylated. Activated BMPRI phosphorylates
  SMAD1 or 5 which heterodimerizes with SMAD4 to up regulate MIXL1 expression. (B)
  BMPR1 mediated signal is hypothesized to induce endogenous MIXL1 expression in KG1,
  OCI-ML2, ML3 and K562 cell lines. These cells are sensitive to BMPR1 inhibitor LDN-193189.
  Enforced expression of MIXL1 in U937 cells 1MIXL1 is independent of BMP signaling
  and therefore insensitive to LDN-193189. In HL60 and U937 cells which are insensitive
  to LDN-193189, the pathway may be absent or modified.
