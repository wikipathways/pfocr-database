caption: Schematic summary of phosphatidylinositol (PI)‐derived signalling pathways
  triggered by bacteria and viruses. Compounds that interfere with these pathways
  and have antiviral or antibiotic activity are indicated. (1) Listeria uses the InIB
  effector, which engages with host receptor Met and stimulates the recruitment of
  PI3KI to the bacterial entry sites. PI3K activation produces PI(3,4,5)P3, resulting
  in the reorganisation of cytoskeleton favouring the entry of Listeria. Both Listeria
  and Chlamydia additionally recruit PI4KIIα/β to the plasma membrane, where it produces
  PI(4)P also promoting uptake. (2) Brucella and Salmonella require PI3KI recruitment
  and activity for entering the cell. Alternately, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Shigella
  need the subsequent PI3K–AKT pathway to delay apoptosis. Moreover, Shigella's entry
  site requires an enrichment of PI(5)P stimulated by IpgD. (3) After entry, Chlamydia
  recruits PI4KIIα to the inclusion, generating PI(4)P and leading to the recruitment
  of the lipid transfer protein oxysterol‐binding protein (OSBP). (4) Mycobacterium
  produces the mannose‐capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) to interfere with PI3KIII
  activity. Disruption of PI3KIII reduces the amounts of PI(3)P on the inclusion surface
  and avoids phagosomal maturation. (5) Recruitment of PI4KIIIβ and OCRL1 together
  with the hijacking of the secretory pathway enriches Legionella inclusion in PI(4)P.
  (6) The Salmonella effector SopB recruits PI3KIII to the inclusion surface to maintain
  high levels of PI(3)P. The SseL effector binds to OSBP, which is recruited to the
  inclusion periphery. (7) Many different viruses recruit and exploit host PI4KIII
  kinases to build viral factories within reorganised cell membranes. Hepatitis C
  virus and encephalomyocarditis virus remodel endoplasmic reticulum membranes to
  build replication organelles with the assistance of PI4KIIIα that generates PI(4)P
  at the replication sites. In a similar manner, PI4KIIIβ is used by other viruses
  such as picornaviruses, enteroviruses, Coxsackievirus B3, and human rhinoviruses
