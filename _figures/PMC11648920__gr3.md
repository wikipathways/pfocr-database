caption: The schematic diagram represents the DEGs expression enriched in SA, JA and
  ET signalling pathway. In SA signalling pathway, genes encoding NPR1 and PR genes
  were downregulated as a response to Puccinia infection in susceptible wheat cultivar.
  In JA signalling pathway, genes encoding COI1 and JAZ protein were sightly downregulated.
  In case of ET signalling pathway, genes encoding ETR, CTR1, EIN2, EIN3 and EBF1
  were strongly downregulated that results in susceptibility to rust due to interruption
  of SA, JA and ET signalling pathway
