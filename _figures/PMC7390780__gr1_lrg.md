caption: Proposed mechanism for estrogen-mediated pathway for release of ER stress
  caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Translation of CoV genome starts right after its
  infection to host cell. Translation results in production of structural and nonstructural
  proteins of CoV. Both types of proteins cause stress in ER by forming double membrane
  vesical, glycosylation and depleting ER lipids. ER stress leads to activation of
  estrogen mediated signaling pathways, which activate UPR. Estrogen governs degradation
  of PIP2 into DAG and IP3 with the help of phospholipase C. IP3 starts in-fluxing
  Ca+2 ions that helps in UPR activation. GRP78 and XBP1 also help in activation of
  UPR under the influence of estrogen. DAG = diacylglycerol, PIP2= phosphotidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate, IP3 = inositol triphosphate, XBP1 = X-box binding protein, GRP78 = 78 kDa
  glucose-regulated protein genes, Pp1 = structural ptotein, nsp = nonstructural proteins
  of CoV, ATF6 = activating transcription factor 6, PERK = PKR like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase and IRE1 = inositol requiring enzyme 1.
