caption: The polyol pathway contributes to cardiomyocyte damage in diabetes. Hyperglycemia
  stimulates flux through the polyol pathway, comprising aldose reductase and sorbitol
  dehydrogenase. Metabolic conversion of glucose to sorbitol by aldose reductase is
  usually followed by further conversion of sorbitol to fructose. In diabetes, sorbitol
  accumulates intracellularly and is not cell permeable. Accumulation of sorbitol
  causes osmotic stress, and NADPH depletion results in oxidative stress and the generation
  of ROS, leading to cell damage.
