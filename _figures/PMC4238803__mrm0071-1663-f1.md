caption: Expected metabolic pathway for butyrate in the heart. The injected [1-13C]butyrate
  should be converted into β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA before subsequent
  conversion into either the ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) or
  acetyl-CoA (for entry into the TCA cycle).
