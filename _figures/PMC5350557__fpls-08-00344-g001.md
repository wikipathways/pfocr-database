caption: Two branches of UPR signaling pathway in plants. One branch involves the
  dual protein kinase and ribonuclease, IRE1, which splices bZIP60 mRNA when activated.
  The other branch is mediated by two ER membrane-anchored transcription factors,
  bZIP17 and bZIP28. Different stresses interfere with protein folding in the ER,
  leading to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, activating
  the UPR. The splicing of bZIP60(u) mRNA introduces a frameshift, such that the resultant
  spliced form bZIP60(s) mRNA is translated into a transcription factor targeted to
  the nucleus. ER stress also provokes the mobilization of the membrane-anchored transcription
  factors from ER to Golgi, where they are processed to bZIP17(p) and bZIP28(p) by
  Golgi resident S1P and S2P proteases, releasing their cytosolic transcription factor
  domains. The factors from both branches are targeted to the nucleus, and either
  homodimerize or heterodimerize to bind to the promoters and regulate the expression
  of stress response genes. Based on .
