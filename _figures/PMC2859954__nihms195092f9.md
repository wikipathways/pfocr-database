caption: Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is diverted from the central mevalonate pathway
  via the action of a sesquiterpene synthase (5-epiaristolochene synthase (EAS)) to
  generate EA. Subsequent hydroxylations at C-1 and C-3 catalyzed by EAH yield capsidiol.
  A preferred hydroxylation order had not been established previously. IPP, isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate; OPP, pyrophosphate.
