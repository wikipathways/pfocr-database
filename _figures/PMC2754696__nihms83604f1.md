caption: Schematic illustration of CIE and CDE pathways showing lipid content and
  regulatory molecules. Constitutive CIE vesicles contain cargo such as MHCI (blue
  bars) while CDE vesicles contain cargo such as transferrin receptor (green bars).
  CIE vesicles lose PIP2 and may acquire Rab5 prior to fusion with Rab5, EEA1-positive,
  “classical” early endosome (EE) containing CDE cargo. From here, CIE cargo may go
  on to late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes for degradation. CIE cargo destined for
  recycling reaches the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) either directly or after
  fusion with “classical” EE and is recycled back out to the PM via tubular membranes
  that do not contain CDE cargo. Recycling back out to the PM requires Rab22 and probably
  Rab8 for tubule formation and Rab11, Arf6, Par 3, Par6, Cdc42 and actin for fusion
  back to the PM. Activation of Arf6, Ras and Src leads to PM ruffling and macropinocytosis
  that alters the architecture of the CIE. Macropinosomes mature from PIP2/PIP3-containing
  by loss of PIP2, acquisition of Rab5 and loss of PIP3. The bulk of the macropinosome
  membrane is recycled back out to the PM using CIE pathway recycling components.
