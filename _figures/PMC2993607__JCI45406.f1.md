caption: Different components of the RB pathway are deregulated in human cancers,
  with the overall effect of derepressing E2F transcription factors that promote cell
  cycle progression or programmed cell death. When cell death pathways are inactivated,
  as is the case in most cancers, activation of E2Fs drives proliferation through
  induction of target genes such as cyclin E, CDC6, and CDK1. Loss of the RB1 tumor
  suppressor is prevalent in osteosarcoma and small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in
  addition to its defining loss in human retinoblastoma, but it was initially confounding
  that its loss was not more commonly detected. However, with the discovery that p16/INK4A
  functions as an upstream inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 and thus as an activator of
  RB, and that loss of the p16/INK4A locus occurred in many of the cancers where RB1
  loss was not detected, Weinberg and others proposed that functional inactivation
  of RB could be achieved in different tumors through targeting different components
  of the RB pathway (). Thus, loss of p16/INK4A in melanoma, translocation of cyclin
  D1 in mantle cell lymphoma, or, indeed, overexpression of BMI-1 in medulloblastoma
  has been proposed to have similar functional readout to RB loss in terms of E2F
  activity and cellular proliferation. Ampk-α2, α2 subunit of AMPK; Apaf-1, apoptosis
  protease activating factor–1; E2A-Pbx1, the translocation product of fusion of the
  E2A gene to the Pbx1 gene; Emi-1, early mitotic inhibitor 1; FoxO TFs, forkhead
  box O subclass of transcription factors; Tk, thymidine kinase; pol α, DNA polymerase-α.
