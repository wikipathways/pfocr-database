caption: 'Paraquat hijacks the pentose phosphate pathway to induce oxidative stress
  and cell death. Our results demonstrate that paraquat induces an increase in the
  PPP (highlighted in green), which is reflected by an increase in glucose uptake,
  and in glucose 6-phosphate, glucono 1,5-lactone, erythrose 4-phosphate, and fructose
  6-phosphate content (red arrows). In addition, paraquat decreases glycolysis as
  demonstrated by a decrease in 3-phosphoglycerate, alanine and lactate levels (green
  arrows). These metabolic changes were also paralleled by: (1) an increase in G6PD
  (the rate-limiting enzyme in the PPP), and the expression levels of citrate synthase,
  pyruvate kinases M1/M2; and (2) a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase A/B chains,
  which participate in glycolysis and the TCA cycle (highlighted in orange). Paraquat
  also induced an increase in citrate accumulation which is associated to the well-known
  inhibitory effect on aconitase (highlighted in orange). An abnormal increase in
  citrate levels has been reported to exert an inhibitory effect on glycolysis by
  allosteric inhibition of PFK (broken red line), which explains why an increase glucose
  uptake and impaired TCA cycle is not translated to an upregulation in glycolysis.

  and oxidative stress. 6-AN, 6-aminonicotinamide, ACO, aconitase or aconitate hydratase
