caption: An overview of oncogenic KRAS-driven RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PDK1/AKT signalling
  networks in pancreatic cancer. Mutationally activated oncogenic KRAS engages the
  PI3K-PDK1-AKT pathway to drive cancer initiation, progression and maintenance. Additionally,
  activated KRAS signals through the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
  via RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2. KRAS activity is enhanced by positive feedback activation
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and possibly by other receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) that are engaged by autocrine and paracrine stimuli. Negative feedback
  loops and inhibitory as well as activating cross-signalling exist at various levels.
  Activating pro-tumourigenic signalling connections are depicted as arrows in green;
  inhibitory anti-tumourigenic pathways are shown as solid lines headed by a vertical
  line in red. Arrows in red depict activating anti-tumourigenic feedback loops. The
  asterisk (KRAS*) represents the mutational activation of KRAS.
