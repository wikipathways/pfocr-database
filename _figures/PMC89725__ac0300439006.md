caption: 'The main enzymatic pathways for nucleotide salvage, synthesis, and interconversion.
  PCV probably enters the cell via purine base transporters (a), resists phosphorylysis
  by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (b), and is probably initially phosphorylated
  by deoxyguanosine (GdR) kinase (c). 3TC follows the deoxycytidine (CdR) salvage
  pathway, entering the cell via pyrimidine nucleoside transporters (d); it resists
  deamination by deoxycytidine deaminase (e) and is initially phosphorylated by deoxycytidine
  kinase (f). PMEA enters the cell by endocytosis (g), bypasses the initial phosphorylation,
  and is phosphorylated by AMP kinase or PRPP synthetase (h) to produce the monophosphate.
  The terminal anabolites PCV-TP, 3TC-TP, and PMEA-DP compete with dGTP, dCTP, and
  dATP, respectively, for incorporation by HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase (j).
  In addition, PCV-TP blocks the priming of reverse transcription. Pathways for uridine
  (UR) and thymidine (TdR) metabolism are also shown: the main pathway to thymidine
  triphosphate (TPP) in hepatocytes is via UMP rather than salvage of thymidine.'
