caption: Scheme of altered signal transduction and enhanced opioid efficacy in GABAergic
  nerve terminals of PAG after chronic treatment with morphine. 1, In untreated tissue
  the dominant mechanism of presynaptic inhibition by μ-opioids is enhancement of
  the activity of a 4-AP and dendrotoxin-sensitive Kv channel via formation of phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) metabolites. Inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase (AC) or protein kinase A (PKA)
  do not impair acute opioid actions (this is, therefore, a minor pathway under basal
  conditions). However, opioids can acutely inhibit GABAergic neurotransmission after
  stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin. 2, 4-AP and dendrotoxin largely abolish
  presynaptic inhibition during acute application of opioids but do not prevent presynaptic
  inhibition after chronic morphine treatment. 3, In contrast, adenylyl cyclase and
  protein kinase A inhibitors prevent presynaptic inhibition by opioids after chronic
  treatment with morphine. Basal and stimulated activity of adenylyl cyclase and perhaps
  other elements of the protein kinase A signaling cascade are hypertrophied after
  chronic morphine treatment, and μ-opioids can then efficaciously inhibit synaptic
  transmission via this mechanism. 4, Enhanced formation of cAMP and activity of protein
  kinase stimulate GABA release, thereby enhancing GABAergic synaptic transmission
  during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal.

    of opioids but do not prevent presynaptic inhibition after chronic morphine treatment.
    3, In contrast, adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A inhibitors prevent presynaptic
