caption: Huaier inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis by upregulating DARC and
  downregulating its ligands. Huaier suppresses EMT by downregulating twist to inhibit
  tumor metastasis while the medicine inhibits metastasis by inhibiting c-Myc-Bmi1
  signaling pathway. Huaier also upregulates miR-122 to inhibit adhesion and metastasis,
  and inhibits the proliferation and metastasis by promoting the phosphorylation of
  Yap1 as well as promoting the transfer of Yap1 to the cytoplasm.
