caption: Binding of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the FGF receptor (FGFR) induces
  FGFR dimerization, which juxtaposes the intracellular Tyr kinase domains of the
  receptors so that kinase activation by transphos- phorylation can occur,. Activated
  FGFR kinase in turn activates its intracellular substrates by phosphorylation, setting
  in motion distinct but potentially interactive signalling pathways that generate
  diverse cellular responses. Major substrates of FGFR kinase are FGFR substrate 2α
  (FRS2α), which is constitutively associated with the receptor kinase, and phospholipase
  Cγ1 (PLCγ1),. Activated FRS2α binds the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound
  2 (GRB2). GRB2 then recruits either the guanine nucleotide exchange factor son of
  sevenless (SOS) (a) or the adaptor protein GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1)
  (b) to the signalling complex. Recruited SOS activates RAS GTPase, which initiates
  activation of the MAPK cascade (a), whereas recruited GAB1 leads to PI3K-mediated
  activation of AKT kinase (also known as protein kinase B) (b). Activated MAPK translocates
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and hence activates immediate
  early gene transcription factors, such as FOS to induce transcription of specific
  genes (a). The outcome of this pathway is primarily cell proliferation but can also
  lead to cell differentiation, cell migration or another cellular response. Activated
  AKT kinase, on the other hand, inactivates pro-apoptotic effectors such as the BCL-2
  antagonist of cell death (BAD) and forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors,
  thereby promoting cell survival, (b). Recruitment and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by
  FGFR kinase initiates a distinct signalling pathway that is thought to have roles
  in cell migration and cell differentiation and that can influence the RAS–MAPK and
  PI3K–AKT pathways (c). Activated PLCγ1 catalyses the hydrolysis of the membrane
  phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)(P2) into diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC),
  which in turn activates its substrates byphosphorylation, including the myristoylated
  Ala-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a regulator of cell motility. IP3 stimulates
  the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores, and this triggers the activation
  of calcium-dependent proteins such as the phosphatase calcineurin. Activated calcineurin
  induces nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT), which stimulates the expression of proteins essential for cell motility.
