caption: Generation of the OGT substrate, UDP-GlcNAc – an overview of the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates many
  extracellular physiological inputs, including nutritional intake, with the metabolism
  of key carbohydrate, amino acid, nucleotide and fatty acid components, to produce
  the OGT substrate UDP-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc cycling, the dynamic addition to and removal
  of O-GlcNAc on serine or threonine residues of a plethora of OGT and OGA targets,
  allows for the regulation of important downstream cellular processes in a nutrient-dependent
  manner. The enzymes involved are given in brackets.
