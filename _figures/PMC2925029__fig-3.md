caption: 'A model of the IFN-λ receptor signaling pathway. The type I, type II, and
  type III IFNs bind to distinct receptor complexes on the cell membrane. Signal transduction
  activated by the binding of IFNs to their cognate receptors induces expression of
  many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The proteins encoded by these genes in turn mediate
  the antiviral activity of the IFNs, particularly the type I and III IFNs. The functional
  IFN-λ receptor complex consists of 2 distinct receptor chains: the ligand-specific
  IFN-λR1 chain (also known as IL-28RA) and the IL-10R2 chain. The binding of IFN-λ
  to its receptor induces a signaling cascade that results in the activation of STAT1
  and STAT2 which together with IRF-9 (p48) form ISGF3 transcription factor complexes.
  The newly formed ISGF3 complexes then translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus
  where they bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of ISGs
  such as IRF7, MX1, and OAS1.'
