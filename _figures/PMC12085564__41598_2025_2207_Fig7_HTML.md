caption: 'Mechanisms of cardiomyocyte specific CD38 deletion protecting heart from
  acute myocardial infarction. Hypoxia including acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
  or myocardial ischemia induces the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by promoting the
  expression of mitochondrial Bax protein and inhibiting mitochondrial fusion, whereas
  cardiomyocyte specific CD38 deletion protects against AMI through elevating intracellular
  NAD+ levels which further activate the SIRT3 signaling pathway to produce their
  anti-apoptosis via increasing the Bcl2/Bax ratio and promoting mitochondrial fusion.
