caption: Anti-fibrotic miRNAs in diabetic complications. miR-142-3p and miR-200b inhibit
  EndMT by inactivating the TGF-β-SMAD pathway. The antifibrotic activity of miR-200b
  is played by down-regulating the TGF-β/SMAD pathway coactivator p300. miR-497 suppresses
  TGF-β-induced EndMT by ROCK1 and ROCK2 inactivation. The overexpression of DPP-4
  is associated with the suppression of the miR-29s family anti-fibrotic activity.
  However, both linagliptin and AcSDKP suppresses EndMT by restoring miR-29 and miR-let-7s
  activities. Furthermore, miR-448-3p inhibits EndMT via DPP-4 suppression. AcSDKP
  upregulates the antifibrotic miR-let-7 which suppresses TGFβR1 and TGFβ signaling.
  The block of TGFβ signaling results in up-regulation of miR-29 gene expression,
  which in turn causes FGFR1 phosphorylation. FGFR1 phosphorylation is critical for
  miR-let-7 production. miR-29 can also target the profibrotic IFNY blocking its inhibitory
  action toward FGFR1. The miR-29s family inhibits high glucose-induced EndMT by down-regulating
  Notch2, which is also suppressed by miR-18a-5p. However, DPP-4 inhibitor and AcSDKP
  suppresses EndMT by restoring of miR-29 and miR-let-7s activities. Furthermore,
  miR-448-3p inhibit EndMT via DPP-4 suppression. The miR-29s family inhibits high
  glucose-induced EndMT by the downregulation of Notch2 which is also suppressed by
  miR-18a-5p. High glucose-induced EndMT is also suppressed by miR-221/222 family,
  via the negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin, and by miR-202-5p via inhibition of
  TGFβR2/TGFβ signaling pathway. Pro-fibrotic miRNAs are showed in dark, anti-fibrotic
  miRNAs in red.
