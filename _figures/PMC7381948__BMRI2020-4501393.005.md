caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs targeted by
  differentially expressed miRNAs. (a) Signaling pathways enriched by differentially
  expressed mRNAs targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. (b) Differentially
  expressed mRNAs in p53 signaling pathway. (c) Differentially expressed mRNAs in
  apoptosis pathway. (d) Differentially expressed mRNAs in natural killer cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity pathway. Green or red stands for highly or lowly expressed mRNA in
  MCAO rat brain tissues, respectively.
