caption: Model summarizing the inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway by MDV VP23. MDV
  DNA activates the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway during infection, leading to the
  production of IFN-β. However, the VP23 protein encoded by MDV interacts with chicken
  IRF7, which disrupts the association between TBK1 and IRF7. This results in the
  suppression of IRF7 activation and IFN-β production, facilitating viral replication
  in the host cells.

    to the production of IFN-β. However, the VP23 protein encoded by MDV interacts
    with chicken IRF7, which disrupts the association between TBK1 and IRF7. This
