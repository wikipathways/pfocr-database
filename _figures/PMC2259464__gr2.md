caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β signaling pathway is activated by
  binding of the ligand TGF-β to TGF-β type II receptor at the cell surface, which
  facilitates the recruitment and phosphorylation of type I TGF-β receptor. The latter
  activates the SMAD transcription factors SMAD 2 or 3 by phosphorylation, which in
  turn releases them from the cytoplasmic anchoring protein SMAD anchor for receptor
  activation (SARA). The phosphorylated SMAD 2/3 proteins complex with SMAD4 and translocate
  to the nucleus where they modulate the expression of multiple SMAD target genes.
  Note that TGF-β signaling can also occur via SMAD-independent mechanisms (not shown).
