caption: The main functions and metabolic origins of novel acylations. In the mitochondria,
  multiple metabolic pathways generate acyl-CoA, which provide acylation groups to
  covalently modify proteins. In the nucleus, histone acylations preferentially accumulate
  at the promoters of active genes, and participate in the transcription initiation
  of active genes. Kcr regulates the homologous recombination DNA repair, and promotes
  gene silencing. The Kbhb of p53 decrease p53 enzymatic activity, and thus attenuating
  the transcriptional expression of p21 and PUMA. In the cytoplasm, various regulatory
  functions are involved, including modulating kinase activity and pre-mRNA splicing.
