caption: HR pathways and their regulation by MMR proteins. HR is initiated with the
  resection of a DSB (black DNA stretch) to create 3′ ssDNA ends, which then form
  nucleoprotein filaments by binding to Rad51. One of the 3′ ssDNA tails then invades
  homologous dsDNA (blue DNA stretch) and anneals to the complimentary strand, thereby
  displacing the other strand, which forms a D-loop (or displacement loop). (A) In
  the DSBR pathway, this is followed by branch migration (extension of the annealed
  regions), which facilitates capture of the second 3′ end of the broken chromosome
  to generate a dHJ intermediate, which can be resolved into CO or NCO products (arrows
  indicate the direction of resolution of the HJs in the examples shown). (B) In the
  SDSA pathway, second end capture does not occur and instead the Holliday junction
  is disassembled after DNA synthesis is initiated from the 3′ end. The two ends of
  the broken DNA molecule then anneal to each other and further DNA synthesis occurs
  to recover the missing information, followed by ligation, to repair the break. This
  pathway does not yield CO events. (C) When a DSB is formed between repetitive sequences,
  repair occurs via the SSA pathway. In SSA, resected DNA anneals at complementary
  sequences. Overhanging 3′ flaps are clipped, allowing DNA synthesis and ligation
  to repair the DSB by deleting sequences between the repeats. In all pathways, stages
  at which mismatches may arise as a result of divergent sequences attempting to recombine
  are highlighted in yellow. At each of these highlighted stages, MMR proteins will
  bind to the mismatches, providing the opportunity to promote anti-recombination
  or MMR.

  description: HR pathways and their regulation by MMR proteins. HR is initiated with
