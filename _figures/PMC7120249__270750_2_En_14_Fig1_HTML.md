caption: Immune-related autophagy functions. (a) Paneth cells from CD patients expressing
  the CD-associated ATG16L1 T300A allele, as well as mice expressing a hypomorphic
  allele of Atg16l1 (Atg16l1HM), show altered granule morphology, suggesting a role
  for autophagy in secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Another role for autophagy
  in secretion is suggested by observations in macrophages, in which secretion of
  active IL-1β (as well as active IL-18, not shown) upon LPS stimulation is regulated
  by autophagy at two levels. In this pathway, loss of ATG16L1 expression is associated
  with increased cytokine secretion. (b) Autophagy can also act as a sensor for bacterial
  products. In dendritic cells, activation of NOD2 by MDP induces autophagy that leads
  to MHC class II antigen presentation. This pathway appears to be altered in the
  context of CD-associated SNPs in ATG16L1 and NOD2. (c) Autophagy plays a role in
  targeting bacteria and bacterial products for degradation/killing. In one pathway,
  observed in primary blood mononuclear cells, activation of NOD2 by MDP induces autophagy
  that leads to production of pro-IL-1β and secretion of active IL-1β. The CD-associated
  variant ATG16L1 T300A is associated with increased amounts of active IL-1β upon
  MDP stimulation. Autophagy can also directly degrade bacteria. In epithelial cells,
  bacteria become ubiquitinated and targeted for autophagic degradation in a process
  that requires the CD-associated genes ATG16L1 and IRGM
