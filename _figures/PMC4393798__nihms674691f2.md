caption: During chronic infection, two subsets of CD8+ T cells have been identified
  based on expression of PD-1 and the T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomes
  []. Cells that express high levels of T-bet, lower levels of Eomes, and intermediate
  levels of PD-1 retain greater proliferative potential, the ability to produce slightly
  greater amounts of IFNγ and TNFα, are preferentially found in the spleen and blood
  [], and are more responsive to reinvigoration following PD-1 pathway blockade [].
  Cells that express higher Eomes, lower T-bet, and high PD-1 show elevated expression
  of other inhibitory receptors (IRs) (e.g. Tim-3, CD160, and Lag-3), reduced proliferative
  potential and reduced co-production of IFNγ and TNFα, but retain a greater capacity
  for killing and preferentially localize to non-lymphoid tissues []. These cells
  also display reduced potential for reinvigoration by PD-1 pathway blockade []. Importantly,
  there is a lineage relationship between these two subsets. The T-betHi PD-1int subset
  serves as a progenitor population for both maintaining itself and the EomesHi PD-1Hi
  terminal-progeny subset []. The conversion from T-betHi PD-1int to EomesHi PD-1Hi
  cells is linked to extensive antigen-driven proliferation. High levels of antigen
  and/or lack of CD4+ T cell help favor the conversion from T-betHi to EomesHi cells
  [].
