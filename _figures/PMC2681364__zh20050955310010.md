caption: Activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis during cisplatin nephrotoxicity
  by p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Cisplatin-induced renal tubular cell
  apoptosis involves both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In the p53-dependent
  mechanism, cisplatin induces an early DNA damage response (involving ATR and Chk2)
  and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to p53 activation.
  p53 then induces proapoptotic genes such as PUMA and PIDD to activate Bax/Bak or
  caspase-2 to permeabilize mitochondria, resulting in the release of apoptogenic
  factors. In the p53-independent mechanism, Bax and Bak are activated by yet-to-be-identified
  factors to permeabilize mitochondria. AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor.
