caption: Photoaging pathways through disruption of redox- and iron-homeostasis by
  oxidising components of sunlight (UVA, VIS, IRA). ROS (reactive oxygen species)
  generated by oxidising components of sunlight, notably UVA, can activate the MAPK
  (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling
  pathways, as well as AP-1 (activator protein 1) and NF-κB transcription factors
  leading to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., Interleukins
  IL-1β and IL-6) and MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) that contribute to photoaging
  by changing concomitantly the composition of ECM (extracellular matrix) components
  by breaking down the collagen and elastin networks and regulating the TGF-β/Smad
  (tumour growth factor-B/Smad) signaling pathway to reduce collagen production. UVA-induced
  increase in LIP (labile iron pool) is also a major contributor to NF-κB activation
  and the related inflammatory response. Concomitantly with this, ROS generated by
  oxidising components of sunlight can regulate the TGF-β/Smad (tumour growth factor-B/Smad)
  signaling pathway to reduce collagen production, and ultimately accelerate skin
  photoaging. The presence of LIP in different compartments of cells, notably cytosol,
  lysosomes and mitochondria, makes the skin cell constitutents (i.e., lipid, protein
  and DNA) highly vulnerable to iron-catalysed ROS damage leading to lipid peroxidation,
  oxidative DNA 8-oxo-G (8-hydroxy guoanosine adducts) and CPDs (cyclopyrimidine dimers),
  and for mitochondrial DNA as deletions and finally for proteins as oxidation and
  degradation. The UVA-induced increase in cytosolic LIP also occurs as a result of
  proteolytic degradation of ferritin and release of heme from ER (endoplasmic reticulum)
  and activation of HO-1 (heme-oxygenase 1), all of which disrupt the cellular redox
  (and iron) homeostasis, leading to photoaging (taken and modified from references
  [,,,,]).
