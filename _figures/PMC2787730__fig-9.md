caption: 'TNF- α–inducible genes that were specifically downregulated after DC treatment
  but not by C95 curcumin: the cytokine and cytokine-receptor interaction pathway.
  The genes shown in cluster  were subjected to functional analysis by using DAVID
  (NIAID, NIH). One of the major known pathways (KEGG) identified in this category
  was the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathway as shown. The gene candidates
  that were differentially expressed in response to DC are marked with asterisks.
