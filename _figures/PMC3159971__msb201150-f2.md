caption: Mathematical model of dual negative feedback regulation of JAK2-STAT5 signaling.
  The model is represented as process diagram and reactions are modulated by enzyme
  catalysis (circle-headed lines) or inhibition (bar-headed lines). Dashed-dotted
  lines indicate delayed reactions used for RNA transcription. Prefix ‘p' represents
  phosphorylated species and ‘n' represents nuclear species. Binding of the ligand
  Epo to its cognate receptor results in phosphorylation of JAK2, which becomes activated.
  In a second step, EpoR is phosphorylated in the complex EpoRpJAK2. The pEpoRpJAK2
  complex was modeled by considering different subclasses of phosphorylated tyrosines
  at the receptor (see ). STAT5 is recruited by pEpoR and phosphorylated by pJAK2,
  dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus. As target genes of STAT5, the negative
  feedback proteins CIS and SOCS3 are expressed, which inhibit the pathway. For an
  extended model description, see .
