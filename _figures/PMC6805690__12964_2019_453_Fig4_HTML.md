caption: Notch-induced autophagy and translational noise as destabilizers of cellular
  memory. a The schematic diagram demonstrates molecular interactions that regulate
  transitioning between pro-anabolic and pro-catabolic states in a cell. b Subsequent
  to activation of Notch signalling, the PTENhigh and PTENlow temporal windows (corresponding
  to the Notchon state of Fig. c) accommodate pro-catabolic (high autophagy) and pro-anabolic
  (high protein synthesis) phases. c Notch signals facilitate G0/G1 transition by
  upregulating Myc and cyclin D1. On the other hand, Notch signals inhibit G1/S transition.
  In consequence, cycling cells dwell longer in noisy G1 characterized by amplified
  protein synthesis
