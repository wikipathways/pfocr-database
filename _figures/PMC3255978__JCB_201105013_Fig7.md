caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying the regulatory control of fibrosis development
  by the PAI-1/uPA balance in aged-associated muscle dystrophy progression. PAI-1
  is the physiological inhibitor of the protease uPA, which, through the generation
  of active plasmin, processes latent TGF-β into its active form. (left) When PAI-1
  levels are high (at early stages of dystrophic disease), there is a controlled activation
  of uPA and production of active TGF-β, which stimulates collagen and TIMP-1 expression
  in fibroblasts through Smad2-mediated transcriptional activation, thus resulting
  in altered ECM metabolism and slow development of fibrosis and muscle dystrophy
  progression. (right) When PAI-1 levels are low (at advanced stages of dystrophic
  disease), there is a hyperactivation of uPA, leading to increased production of
  active TGF-β and Smad2 signaling (yet, additional proteolytic TGF-β–activating pathways
  in fibrotic muscle cannot be discarded). Most importantly, there is a derepression
  of fibroblast AKT signaling and abnormal fibroblast proliferation through miR-21
  (via TGF-β–dependent miR-21 biogenesis), which inhibits the expression of PTEN phosphatase,
  an inhibitor of AKT activation. The increase in AKT activity results in enhanced
  muscle fibroblast proliferation, which in turn causes further fibrosis and worsens
  muscle dystrophy. Interestingly, high miR-21 expression in dystrophic muscle also
  leads to Smad7 (an inhibitory Smad) down-regulation, thus providing a TGF-β activity–amplifying
  loop, resulting in increased fibrosis. Whether other additional mechanisms of miR-21
  activation, in addition to TGF-β, are operational in this context awaits further
  investigation. Overall, our data validate uPA as a disease target in muscular dystrophy
  (as demonstrated by the efficacy of amiloride and genetic uPA interference) and
  introduces miR-21 as a novel therapeutic candidate.
