caption: The figure represents the interactions among the four drugs and PCOS subnetwork
  No.2. The ellipses show the PCOS-related proteins, octagons represent the drugs,
  and the squares depict pathways. The shared proteins between PCOS subnetwork No.2
  and the four drugs (Metformin, Pioglitazone, Letrozole, and Spironolactone) are
  red. PCOS-drugs interactions are shown by edges in four colors, including red for
  metformin, orange for spironolactone, green for pioglitazone, and violet for letrozole. The
  light blue lines indicate the interactions of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Yellow nodes
  and black edges indicate the PCOS-related proteins' interactions in subnetwork No.2
  that are not shared with drug-related proteins
