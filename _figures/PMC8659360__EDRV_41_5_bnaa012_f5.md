caption: Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of SPRMs. Oral administration of SPRMs is
  frequently absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and transported directly to the
  liver. All the SPRMs are primarily metabolized in the liver by cytochromes. Monodemethylated,
  didemethylated, and hydroxylated metabolites of mifepristone are produced by demethylation
  and hydroxylation metabolic pathway. The asoprisnil metabolites are produced by
  17β-O-demethylation, which further conjugated with glutathione (SG). Like mifepristone,
  telapristone acetate and ulipristal acetate UPA produce mono and didemethylated
  metabolites, as well as hydroxylated metabolite. It has been proposed that vilaprisan
  undergoes reduction to produce hydroxyl derivatives, which further oxidate to produce
  various metabolites. All the SPRM metabolites are further catalyzed by CYP3A4 and
  aldoketoreductases. The unabsorbed parent compounds and metabolites are eliminated
  via urine and feces.
