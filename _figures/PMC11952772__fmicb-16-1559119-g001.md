caption: Possible mechanism of Lactobacillus alleviating sarcopenia. Lactobacillus
  can alleviate sarcopenia in various ways. (1) At molecular level, lactobacilli alter
  the phenotype and quantity of immune cells; enhancing gut barrier affects MAPK and
  NF-KB signaling pathway, thereby reducing the level of inflammatory factors. It
  can also regulate the level of antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), inhibiting Nitric Oxide (NO) production,
  alleviating oxidative stress, and ameliorating sarcopenia. (2) At tissue level,
  Lactobacillus can increase skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis; reduce glycogen decomposition;
  promote protein synthesis; reduce protein decompositon and fat accumulation; increase
  beneficial bacteria and reduce harmful bacteria in the intestine; increase glucose
  utilization in fat and muscle groups. In addition, Lactobacillus increases the number
  of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, enhances bile acid synthesis
  and Cholesterol reverse transport, promotes the production and absorption of vitamins,
  thereby showing therapeutic activity against sarcopenia. M1, M1 macrophages; M2,
