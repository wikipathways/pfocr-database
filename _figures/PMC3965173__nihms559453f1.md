caption: Signaling pathways that can be inhibited to increase the radiation response
  of tumors. Activation of growth factor receptors including EGFR leads to upregulation
  of numerous downstream pathways. One of these, the PI3K/Akt pathway, has been implicated
  in radioresistance and in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)
  and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway has been shown to increase the intrinsic radiosensitivity of cancer cells.
  However, recent evidence suggests that inhibition of the EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway can
  also increase the extrinsic radiosensitivity of tumors by altering the tumor microenvironment,
  perhaps by improving blood flow and tumor oxygenation.
