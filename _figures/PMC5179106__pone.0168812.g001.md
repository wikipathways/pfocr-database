caption: We searched the GWAS Catalogue, PubMed, and HMDB database, and extracted
  244 genetic variations, 14 epigenetic modifications, 98 proteins and 86 metabolites
  associated with AD. We also extracted 1179 protein-metabolite interactions based
  on the HMDB database and found 200 proteins linked to ≥2 AD associated metabolites.
  In total, we shortlisted 524 AD-related proteins, 8 of which were revealed by 2
  ‘omics’ approaches. By using the TTD and DrugBank database, we extracted information
  on drugs, targets and the drugs’ mode of action. Considering AD pathogenesis together
  with the drugs’ mode of action, we found 19 targets of 92 drugs with anti-AD indication
  that may be repurposed. We then scored these targets and found CD33 and MIF to be
  the two highest ranked targets. A protein-protein interaction analysis of 524 AD-related
  proteins detected a novel network of 11 proteins with CAD as a hub protein (functional
  enrichment analysis revealed that 5 of these 11 proteins are involved in the “Alanine,
  Aspartate and Glutamate Metabolism” pathway presented in ).
