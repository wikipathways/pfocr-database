caption: Proposed integrated signaling pathway responsible for the synergistic chemotactic
  responses elicited by antigen in the presence of SCF or GPCR agonists. For clarity,
  the pathways by which GPCRs and KIT regulate chemotaxis in the absence of FcεRI
  aggregation have not been included. Dotted lines indicate an amplification pathway
  and does not imply direct regulation. Concurrent ligation of KIT or GPCRs with FcεRI
  aggregation leads to enhanced activation of PI3Ks, which would result in elevated
  production of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PIP3] from
  phosphoinositide-4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PIP2]. This would allow the
  synergistic translocation and activation of Btk (). This in turn induces an enhancement
  in the Ca2+ signal and Rac-dependent F-actin rearrangement, which in combination
  lead to the observed synergy in mast-cell chemotaxis.
