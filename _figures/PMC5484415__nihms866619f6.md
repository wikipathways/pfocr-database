caption: Amino acids stimulate the mTOR pathway, and amino acid pools rely on glutamine
  to be maintained. Specifically, arginine and leucine are two amino acids that can
  together almost fully stimulate mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) through activation of the
  RAS-related GTPase (RAG) complex, which in turn recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome
  and stimulates its activity , , . Glutamine can contribute to mTORC1 activation
  by being exchanged for essential amino acids, including leucine, through the large
  neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1; a heterodimer of SLC7A5 and SLC3A2) transporter
  . This RAG-dependent regulation of mTOR is likely dependent on the lysosomal amino
  acid transporter SLC38A9, which transports glutamine, arginine, and leucine as substrates,
  , , as well as the leucine sensor sestrin 2 (not shown in Figure) , . Although the
  mechanism is not well understood, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) may regulate RAGB activity
  and mTOR activation downstream of glutamine metabolism . Several RAG-independent
  pathways of mTOR regulation by glutamine have also been identified. Glutamine promotes
  mTOR localization to the lysosome (and thus activity) through the RAS-family member
  ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) in a poorly understood mechanism, as well as the
  TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex (not shown in Figure) , . GLS, kidney-type glutaminase; GLS2,
  liver-type glutaminase; GLUD, glutamate dehydrogenase.
