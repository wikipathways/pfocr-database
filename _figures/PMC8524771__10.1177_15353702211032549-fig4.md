caption: Model of the mechanism of benzodiazepine-mediated cell death. (1) Binding
  of GABA (agonist) to a Type-A GABA receptor (GABAAR) “opens” the channel to allow
  flow of chloride anions out of a cancer cell. This efflux of chloride anions is
  reflective of the depolarizing nature of the GABAAR in embryonal cells. (2) Benzodiazepines
  (positive allosteric modulators of the receptor) enhance the chloride efflux. (3)
  The significant movement of chloride anions contributes to depolarizing of the mitochondria
  in the cancer cell and induces mitochondrial fission. This may contribute to mitochondrial
  dysfunction such as release of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen, as well as impact
  ATP production. (4) The p53 signaling pathway is activated in these cancer cells
  in response to perturbation in ion homeostasis. (5) In addition, the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
  apoptotic pathway is triggered with an associated role for the pro-apoptotic protein
  BAD, BCL2 associated agonist of death. (6) In addition to binding to resident GABAAR
  on cancer cells, benzodiazepine binds to the GABAAR on immune cells. This event
  may contribute to enhanced infiltration of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage
  phagocytosis.
