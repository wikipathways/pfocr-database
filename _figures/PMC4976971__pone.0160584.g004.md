caption: Red-labeled metabolites increased in all PCB95-treated groups, and yellow-labeled
  metabolites increased and decreased (or stable) across different groups because
  of enantioselectivity. The solid lines represent direct metabolic reactions, and
  the dotted lines represent multiple reactions and indirect connections between two
  metabolites.
