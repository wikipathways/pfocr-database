caption: MAPK signaling highlighted in KEGG pathway analysis in parallel with SPIA
  pathway analysis by using microarray result of SNU-2414 set. Genes that were upregulated
  more than two-fold were highlighted in red in KEGG diagram and the list from SPIA
  pathway. Genes that were downregulated more than two-fold were highlighted in blue
  in KEGG diagram and the list from SPIA pathway. Genes that were up- or downregulated
  more than 1.5-fold were highlighted in purple in KEGG diagram.
