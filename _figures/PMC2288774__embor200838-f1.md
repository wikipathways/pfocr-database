caption: Model for Hedgehog pathway signalling. (A) The pathway in the absence of
  Hedgehog (Hh). Patched (Ptc) represses Smoothened (Smo) through an unknown mechanism.
  Unphosphorylated Smo, Costal2 (Cos2), Fused (Fu) and Cubitus interruptus (Ci)155
  form a complex that cycles between the plasma membrane (PM) and a vesicular compartment.
  Cos2 sequesters protein kinase A (PKA), casein kinase I (CKI) and glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3), directing their activity towards Ci155, which primes the molecule
  for proteolysis to Ci75. (B) Activation of the signalling pathway by Hh. Ptc repression
  of Smo is released, causing an unknown change in the Smo molecule (de-repressed
  Smo is indicated by a star). De-repressed Smo activates Fu, leading to Cos2 phosphorylation
  and the release of transcriptionally active Ci155 (denoted by an arrow), and resultant
  dissociation/destabilization of phosphorylated Cos2/Fu. Smo is phosphorylated and
  stabilized at the PM, where it can further activate other unphosphorylated Cos2–Fu–Ci
  complexes.
