caption: Top2 can be inhibited at several different points in the enzyme reaction
  cycle, which can generate different biochemical and cellular consequences. One simple
  mode of inhibition is to inhibit a step early in the enzyme reaction cycle. For
  example, competitive inhibitors of ATP binding prevent strand passage, and do not
  generate enzyme mediated DNA damage. While agents such as novobiocin and coumermycin
  (not shown on the figure) inhibit both prokaryotic and eukaryotic Top2s, they are
  either less potent as well as relatively nonspecific (e.g., novobiocin) or are poorly
  taken up by mammalian cells (e.g., coumermycin). Similar effects would occur with
  inhibitors that prevent the binding of Top2 to DNA such as aclarubicin. Agents that
  prevent DNA cleavage by Top2, such as merbarone would also be expected to act as
  simple catalytic inhibitors. While merbarone clearly prevents DNA cleavage by Top2,
  merbarone clearly affects other targets besides Top2. A second mode of inhibition
  is blocking the catalytic cycle after DNA is cleaved but prior to DNA religation.
  This mode of inhibition occurs for most currently used Top2 targeting agents including
  anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins, as well as for agents that target prokaryotic
  type II topoisomerases. These agents prevent enzyme turnover, and therefore greatly
  inhibit the enzyme catalytic activity, however, the clearest effect is the generation
  of high levels of Top2:DNA covalent complexes. Therefore, these inhibitors generate
  DNA damage, and interfere with many DNA metabolic events such as transcription and
  replication. Since agents of this class convert Top2 into an agent that induces
  cellular damage, they have been termed topoisomerase poisons. Top2 can be inhibited
  after strand passage is completed, but prior to ATP hydrolysis and dissociation
  of N-terminal dimerization. Bisdioxopiperazines such as dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) inhibit
  both ATP hydrolysis and maintain Top2 as a closed clamp . As is the case with Top2
  poisons, bisdioxopiperazines inhibit Top2 catalytic activity mainly by blocking
  enzyme turnover. Although these agents are frequently termed catalytic inhibitors,
  they leave Top2 trapped on DNA, and may interfere with DNA metabolism in ways distinct
  from the inhibitors described in pathway (A). Nonetheless, since bisdioxopiperazines
  are relatively specific for Top2, they are the most commonly used catalytic inhibitors
  of Top2 in mammalian cells .
