caption: Molecular signaling pathway of pyroptosis in glaucoma. A Elevated IOP results
  in the inhibition of hypoxia-induced mitophagy. As dysfunctional and fragmented
  mitochondria accumulate, the subsequent oxidative stress promotion induces NLRP3
  activation. B Elevated IOP triggers pannexin and connexin hemichannels, induces
  ATP efflux, and promotes the ATP/P2X7R/Ca2+ influx pathway to activate the NLRP1/NLRP3/AIM2
  inflammasome. C Retinal ischemic reperfusion injury triggers the release of high-mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1) in the retina, which binds to TLR4, promotes the activation
  of caspase-8, subsequently regulating the activation of NLRP3 via NF-κB pathway.
  D CASP8-HIF-1α signaling is an upstream regulator of NLRP3/NLRP12/NLRC4 in high
  IOP-induced retinal ischemic injury and may initiate pyroptosis. E AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) activates NF-κB signaling and induces NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.
  F Elevated glutamate binds to the glutamate receptors on RGCs, causing a large influx
  of Ca2+ and mitochondrial dysfunction, thus triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  G Ocular hypertension drives astrocytes or Müller cells to release ATP to activate
  microglial cells via the ATP/P2X7R/NLRP3 pathway, which contributes to RGC death.
  H PM2.5, triggers oxidative stress, which activates NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in
  trabecular meshwork cells and results in ocular hypertension
