caption: Figure 1. Transcription factors involved in nodulation. The nodulation signaling
  pathway is triggered when receptors located in the plasma membrane sense rhizobia
  derived signals. Upon receptor activation, oscillations of calcium concentration
  (calcium spiking) are produced in and around the nucleus. A nuclear located calcium
  and calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) has been proposed as the protein
  that deciphers the calcium signal. Downstream from CCaMK, several transcriptional
  regulators are required for symbiosis establishment. CYCLOPS interacts and is phosphorylated
  by CCaMK, activating its capacity to recognize the NIN promoter. Nodulation signaling
  1 (NSP1) and NSP2 both encode GRAS transcription factors that are essential for
  nodulation and activate the expression of early nodulation genes (nodulins). NIN
  and ERN are also involved in the transcriptional regulation of nodulins. Members
  of the NF-Y gene family are also required for nodulation. NF-YB would interact with
  NF-YC subunit in the cytoplasm prior to the nuclear import of the heterodimer. Once
  inside the nucleus, they interact with NF-YA to form the functional heterotrimer
  that binds with high affinity to CCAAT elements. SIN1 (a member of the GRAS family)
  physically interacts with the C subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor in the
  nucleus. This putative multimeric complex participates, directly or indirectly,
  in the transcriptional control of cell cycle genes.
