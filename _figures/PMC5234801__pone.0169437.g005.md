caption: 'Only the pathway in PpuMBEL1071 was right. Green, blue and purple arrows
  depict reactions in iJN746, iJP815 (iJP962) and PpuMBEL1071 respectively. Wrong
  directions of R_SER_AL and R_ACSr (in iJN746), IR04850 (in iJP815 and iJP962) led
  to wrong cysteine synthesis pathways. KDPG: 2-Dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate.'
