caption: Strategies reversing PD-1/PDL1 blockade by releasing tumor antigens (A) and
  enhancing antigen presentation (B). A.Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and oncolytic viruses
  could promote the immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing the liberation of immunogenic
  neoantigens, thus increasing the antigenicity in tumors resistant to ICB due to
  the failure of antigen recognition. In addition, some minimally invasive thermal
  ablation treatments lead to antigens release as well. (B) DNMTi, HDACi, HMTi epigenetically
  modulate the upregulation of MHC pathway. Stabilization of NF-κB, restoration of
  IFN signaling and induction of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) also reverse
  MHC-I downregulation. Besides, stimulation factors including cytokines such as FLT3L
  (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) and GM-CSF (granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor), Toll-like receptor (TLR2/TLR4, TLR3, TLR7/TLR8, TLR9) agonists, IDO inhibitors
  and STAT3 inhibitors could augment the infiltration, activation, and effector function
  of conventional DCs (cDCs), thus increasing antigen delivery. DC vaccines are also
  important tools boosting antigen presentation. The picture was created with BioRender.com.
