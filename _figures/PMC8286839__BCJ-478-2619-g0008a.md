caption: (A) Activation of the NF-κB pathway downstream of TLR4 receptor. LPS is recognised
  by TLR4 and this leads to interaction with co-receptors CD14 and MD2. Following
  this stimulation, a number of proteins form a signalling complex collectively known
  as the ‘Myddosome’ which activates TAK1 to drive phosphorylation and activation
  the IKK complex. Following IκB phosphorylation and degradation NF-κB dimers enter
  the nucleus where they bind to κB sites in DNA and promote the transcription of
  target genes, including various ‘decoy receptors’ such as soluble TLR4, RP105 and
  SIGIRR. (B) Alternative splicing leads to the generation of soluble TLR4 (sTLR4)
  following NF-κB activation by LPS. This is secreted and sequesters LPS which is
  now not able to bind to full length TLR4. Consequently, all TLR4 signalling is disrupted
  and NF-κB activity declines. (C) RP105 and (D) SIGIRR are TLR4 homologs that are
  transcribed following NF-κB activation and serve as transmembrane decoy receptors.
  RP105 lacks an intracellular TIR domain and inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation
  by forming non-signalling complexes with TLR4 and MD2. SIGIRR contains one extracellular
  Ig domain and an intracellular TIR domain which lacks Ser447 and Tyr536 which are
  essential for IL-1R signalling. SIGIRR disrupts NF-κB activation by associating
  with IL-1R1, IRAK and TRAF6 in the Myddosome to disrupt these signalling complexes.
