caption: Model depicting the possible roles of miRNAs and phased secondary siRNAs
  (phasiRNA) in the regulation of R-genes. A Under normal conditions, when the host
  plant is not challenged, constitutive and unregulated expression of R-genes results
  in high fitness costs; B In the direct targeting pathway of R-genes by miRNA, the
  MIR loci produce miRNA transcripts that are processed to mature miRNAs. Subsequently,
  mature miRNA is complexed with AGO1/7 and directly binds to R-gene transcript followed
  by cleavage, resulting in basal resistance response and concomitant effects on fitness
  cost (box with dashed line). In the indirect targeting pathway of R-genes by miRNAs,
  the mature miRNA is produced from MIR loci and interacts with AGO1. The AGO1-miRNA
  complex binds to PHAS transcripts produced from the coding region of PHAS loci and
  cleaves the PHAS transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. SGS3 and RDR6 convert
  the single-stranded RNA to long double-stranded RNA which is processed by DCL4 to
  phased siRNA (phasiRNA). AGO1/7-phasiRNA complex cleaves R- gene transcripts and
  maintain the basal level of R-gene expression to achieve optimized and well-balanced
  resource usage for defense and maintenance of plant fitness by robust growth and
  development. R genes-resistance genes; AGO1-ARGONAUTE 1; SGS3-SUPPRESSOR OF GENE
