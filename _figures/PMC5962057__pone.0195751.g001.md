caption: Schematic shows the alternative complement pathway. Magenta text and cross-
  interaction of Aβ with complement factor I (CFI) causes reduction of its enzymatic
  activity and a reduction of the conversion of C3bH to iC3b. Light Blue text- Degradation
  pathway of C3b to C3d via C3bH, modulated by complement factor H (CFH) and CFI.
  Black text- conversion of C3b to C3 convertase. Orange-Amplification loop C3 to
  C3a + C3b. Red-Termination phase resulting in conversion of C5 to C5b78(9)n (membrane
  attack complex [MAC]). Aβ directly and indirectly produces a local inflammatory
  environment in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells by modulating release of MCP-1,
  which leads to recruitment of macrophages and microglia locally, and production
  of TNF-α and IL1β. The action of these factors on the RPE leads to the release of
  complement factor B (CFB, green), which in turn is the second mechanism leading
  to activation of the alternative complement cascade [].
