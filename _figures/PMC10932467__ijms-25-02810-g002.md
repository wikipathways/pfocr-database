caption: Possible effects of IL-6 signaling on energy intake and energy expenditure
  under non-obesogenic conditions. (a) Hypothalamic IL-6/STAT3 signaling may reduce
  energy intake and stimulate thermogenesis and lipolysis in adipocytes. The underlying
  mechanisms are still largely unexplored. (b) IL-6 is released from the skeletal
  muscle during exercise, which may increase lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipocytes.
  Tumor tissues may also secrete IL-6 into the blood stream, that can over-stimulate
  fat catabolism and cause excessive wasting of body fat and lead to cachexia. (c)
  It has been shown recently that IL-6/STAT3 signaling triggers the expression of
  genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis in preadipocytes and
  adipocytes, and STAT3 is necessary for thermogenic fat development. Upstream stimulators
  of the locally produced IL-6 may be human milk alkylglycerols (AKGs). AKGs are metabolized
  by ATMs into platelet-activating factor (PAF), which is non-enzymatically converted
  into azelaoyl PAF (AzPAF) and stimulates IL-6 release from ATMs. AzPAF is a peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligand [21]. (d) Autocrine IL-6 signaling
  stimulates the transcription of mitobiogenesis and thermogenesis genes in adipocytes,
  especially during the early postnatal life. Upstream stimulators of IL-6 synthesis
  are mitochondria-derived RNA species (mtRNA), which increase IL-6 synthesis through
  the RIG-I/MDA5 (retinoic acid-inducible gene-1/RIG-I-like receptor dsRNA helicase)
  cytosolic RNA recognition pathway [31]
