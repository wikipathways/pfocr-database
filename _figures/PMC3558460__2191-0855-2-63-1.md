caption: Schematic representation of signal activation of human somatostatin receptor
  subtype-2 by membrane-displayed somatostatin. A. Overview of this study. Membrane-displayed
  somatostatin (cyclic peptide) activates human somatostatin receptor subtype-2, which
  is heterologously produced in yeast, and leads to the activation of chimeric Gα
  proteins, the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and transcription factor
  Ste12p. Phosphorylated Ste12p induces the overexpression of enhanced green fluorescent
  protein by binding to a pheromone response element in the FUS1 promoter of pYEX-fet
  (signal detection plasmid) (Hara et al. ). This expression allows monitoring and
  quantification of signal transduction by fluorescence. B. Functional domains encoded
  by the membrane-displayed somatostatin plasmid. After processing by the secretory
  pathway, the signal sequence and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) targeting sequence
  are cleaved, and the somatostatin sequence, with a free N-terminus is displayed
  on the plasma membrane by GPI covalently linked to the C-terminus. C. Amino-acid
  sequence of membrane-displayed somatostatin without FLAG tag.
