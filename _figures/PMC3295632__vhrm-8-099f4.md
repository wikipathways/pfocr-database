caption: 'Bone marrow-derived stem cell mobilization. Bone marrow stem cells may be
  mobilized by reducing the ligand SDF-1 and increasing the stem cell receptor CXCR4
  to create a chemotatic gradient with the peripheral blood. G-CSF treatment increases
  MMP-9 to regulate changes in SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway, which is dependent on plasmin
  activation of MMP-9.Reprinted with permission, Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical
