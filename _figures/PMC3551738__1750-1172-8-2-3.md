caption: Network analysis of known SLE-associated genes. Network analysis using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software shows regulatory interactions between almost half of the
  known SLE-associated genes, shown as shaded molecules. Three sub-networks are circled.
  Potential regulatory partners that participate in the networks but are not previously
  associated with SLE are shown as non-shaded molecules. Several IgG molecules have
  multiple interactions with network members, shown as dotted lines.
papertitle: A diverse array of genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of Systemic
  Lupus Erythematosus.
