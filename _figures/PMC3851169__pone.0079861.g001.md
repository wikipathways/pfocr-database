  steps: Nvd, neverland, Rieske-domain oxygenase; Phm, Phantom, CYP306A1, 25-hydroxylase;

  molecules. Putative steps of the “black box”, from 7-dehydro-cholesterol to 5ß-ketodiol,
  are represented within the dark grey box. [O] indicates oxidative step that might
  be catalyzed by a CYP enzyme. Some steps could be catalyzed by shroud, spook (CYP307A1)
  or spookier (CYP307A2). 5ßR: 5ß-reductase. 3ßHSD: 3ß-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase.
