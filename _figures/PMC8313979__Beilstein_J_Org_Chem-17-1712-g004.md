caption: 'Summary of TFs enriched to glycosylation pathways for luminal and basal
  breast cancer: The TFs found to be enriched to glycosylation pathways and the glycogenes
  they regulate are shown in pink for luminal and orange for basal breast cancer.
  Note that some of the TFs shown above do not appear in the alluvial plots in the
  subsequent figures because they were not enriched to a signaling pathway in Reactome.
  The glycans synthesized by the enriched glycogenes are shown in SNFG format [].
  All figures were generated using DrawGlycan-SNFG [].'
