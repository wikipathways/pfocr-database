caption: TOR Kinase Signaling Pathway in Plants.Data from this study support the existence
  of the plant TOR pathway modulating plant cell growth in response to stress. The
  basic skeleton of the pathway, as illustrated above, is conserved as in other eukaryotes.
  It remains to be answered whether the activity of plant TOR also requires the G-β-like
  (GBL) protein.
