caption: BM-MSC modulates inflammation response through mTORC1-p70S6K/mTORC2-Akt Signal
  Pathway. MSC modulated the level of proinflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-10 also decreased in Raptor overexpression group. Engrafted BM-MSCs
  promoted the activation of mTORC1/mTORC2 and their respective downstream signaling
  pathways, namely, p70S6K and Akt. mTORC1-p70S6K axis exhibits a proinflammatory
  property, as mTORC1-p70S6K activation by endotoxin contributes to cytokine upregulation
  as a consequence of lethal inflammation.42,43 The functional component of mTORC2,
  leads to the activation of Akt, which could modulate cellular activation, inflammatory
  response, and apoptosis,44,45 and down regulates the downstream apoptosis-related
  protein caspase-3. Intriguingly, a delicate balance of mTORC1/mTORC2 may exist,
  as the total activation of mTOR is stable along with the up- and downregulation
  of Raptor/Rictor.
