caption: Model of ban regulation of Mad and Dpp signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal
  disc cells.In our model, we propose a feedback loop regulation between ban and Dpp
  signaling in the wing imaginal disc. First, extracellular Dpp ligands bind to the
  cell surface type I and type II receptors, Tkv and Put, respectively. Constitutively
  active Put phosphorylates Tkv, which in turn phosphorylates the R-Smad, Mad. pMad
  forms a complex with the Co-Smad, Medea (Med), and translocates into the nucleus,
  where tissue specific transcription is activated or repressed with the cooperation
  of other transcription factors (TFs). In cells expressing ban, Dpp signaling can
  be fine-tuned through the inhibitory effect of ban on Mad. ban is up-regulated by
  Dpp to further ensure the appropriate Dpp activity for developmental requirements.
  Thus, we propose a model by which ban fine-tunes Dpp signaling possibly through
  its regulation of Mad.
