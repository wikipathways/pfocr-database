caption: Moco homeostasis in A. thaliana. The entire Moco biosynthetic pathway, from
  GTP to Moco, is depicted alongside the enzymes involved at each stage. Distinct
  proteins catalyzing the biosynthesis steps are color-coded for clarity. All known
  intermediates are sequentially presented across the four key steps of Moco synthesis.
  The MOT1 and MOT2 proteins facilitate the transport of the molybdate anion into
  the cytosol, while MOT1.2 mediates Mo transport from the vacuole to the Mo-insertase
  Cnx1. Prior research has demonstrated interactions between these proteins, as indicated
  by the two-sided arrow [72]. GTP is converted to cPMP by the Cnx2 and Cnx3 proteins,
  with the mitochondrial ABC transporter ATM3 shuttling cPMP to the cytosol. MPT-synthase,
  composed of Cnx6 and Cnx7, transforms cPMP into MPT, with Cnx5 supplying the sulfur.
  The Cnx1 G-domain activates MPT, converting it into MPT-AMP, which is then transferred
  to Cnx1E. Finally, Cnx1E incorporates Mo into MPT-AMP and removes AMP to generate
  the active Moco. For detailed descriptions, refer to the main text
