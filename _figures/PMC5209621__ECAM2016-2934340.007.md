caption: The classic mechanism for E2 action is E2 diffusing into the nucleus, binding
  to the nucleus estrogen receptor (ER), combining with ERE on DNA, starting transcription
  translation and inducing the cycle of multiplication in cancer cells. In addition,
  activated ERα can activate AP-1 and SP-1, which are transcription enhancers that
  can promote the transcription translation of ERE and enable incomplete ERE (half
  ERE) to transcribe and translate. SSCE may affect the activation of ERα, decreasing
  p-ERα, reducing the combination ability of ER and ERE, and stopping ERE from transcribing
  and translating. On the other hand, E2 can combine with GPER on the cell membrane,
  increase the expression of ERK, promote cell proliferation, activate the PI3K-AKT
  pathway, increase the activation of mTOR and the upregulation of Bcl-2 and cyclin
  D, downregulate Bax, reduce apoptosis, and start the cell cycle. Both ERK and AKT
  can inhibit JNK, reducing apoptosis. SSCE may downregulate the PI3K-AKT, ERK pathway
  by GPER, resulting in a downregulation of Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax, reduction
  in the inhibition of JNK, promotion of cell apoptosis, and downregulation of cyclin
  D, thereby blocking the cell cycle.
