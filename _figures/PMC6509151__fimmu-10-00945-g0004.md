caption: 'Hypothetical model of the role of FcμR in central deletion and B cell repertoire
  selection. Top: In the bone marrow, only small populations (~10%) of the newly generated
  B cells bearing monomeric IgM (Y shape with Igα/Igß, two purple lines carrying green
  ITAM) on the plasma membrane (PM) are survived by ligand-independent (or tonic)
  signals through activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and suppression of the FOXO1-mediated
  Rag1/2 activity (left). By contrast, ~90% of the newly generated immature B cells
  have variable binding affinities for autoantigens (green leaf shape) and are subjected
  to negative selection by receptor editing or apoptosis (right). Autoantigens opsonized
  with natural pentameric IgM (broom shape) simultaneously bind the corresponding
  BCR and FcμR (blue tennis racket shape with three conserved Tyr residues in yellow).
  The resultant cross-linkage of BCR and FcμR on immature autoreactive B cells may
  inhibit the BCR-mediated PI3K-AKT pathway, resulting in relief of the AKT-mediated
  suppression of FOXO1 and leading to activation of Rag1/2 and receptor editing, thereby
  contributing to negative selection or central tolerance. In the absence of FcμR
  autoantibodies against dsDNA or chromatin are increased. Bottom: In peripheral lymphoid
  tissues, incompletely edited B cells express IgM BCR with self-reactivity to membrane
  components (brown triangles) present on ER membranes, but no interaction of monomeric
  IgM with the corresponding antigens occurs due to its low affinity. When cells receive
  signals from TLR, a switch from μm to μs exon usage occurs along with the synthesis
  of J chain during the translocation from ER to the ER Golgi intermediate compartment
  (ERGIC) or the Golgi and the resultant pentameric IgM is contained inside the vesicles
  where it binds membrane components via the Fab regions and its Fc portion binds
  FcμR. This cis engagement of self-antigen/secreted IgM/FcμR within the vesicles
  prevents further development of such autoreactive B cells, thereby contributing
  to peripheral tolerance. In the absence of FcμR, Mott cells containing intracellular
  Ig inclusion bodies are increased.'
