caption: Two‐signal model of inflammasome signaling. The classic understanding of
  inflammasome is based on a two‐signal model. In signal 1, sensors (eg, NLRP3) of
  inflammasome are activated by PAMPs/ DAMPs, leading to activation of NF‐κB pathway
  and increased transcription of inflammasome‐relevant genes such as NLRP3 and pro‐IL1β.
  In signal 2, PAMPs/DAMPs (eg, ATP) further activate the inflammasome sensors. The
  sensors then undergo oligomerization and attach to ASC. ASC acts as a molecular
  platform that recruits pro‐caspase enzymes. The pro‐caspase enzymes are then cleaved
  into their active form which subsequently cleave pro‐IL1β and pro‐IL18 into cleaved‐IL1β
  and cleaved‐IL18
