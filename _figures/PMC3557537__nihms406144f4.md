caption: Chemical factors influence the cellular response to mechanical factors and
  vice versa. MMP and matrix secretion modulates the stiffness and pore size of the
  surrounding matrix, while GFR activation influences integrin expression and activation.
  MMP-mediated matrix degradation releases chemical signals, while integrin activation
  and clustering can alter GFR expression and activation. GFRs and integrins can form
  macromolecular complexes, and elements of the intracellular signaling pathway are
  shared. Interstitial flow induces mechanical signals through fluid shear and pressure
  stresses, while simultaneously inducing chemical signals through convection of autocrine
  and paracrine signaling factors.
