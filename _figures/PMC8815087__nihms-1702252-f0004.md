caption: PDE1A1 activation leads to upregulation of ubiquitin-like protein, containing
  PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) in melanoma cells and in lymphoblastic leukemia
  cancer. Targeted inhibition of PDE1A and PDE1C increases p27Kip1 and downregulates
  cyclin D1 (CD1) through cGMP-PKG dependent mechanism and results in cell cycle arrest
  at G1 stage. PDE1B inhibition activates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
  through cAMP accumulation and regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  which results in neuronal survival and reduction of beta amyloid plaques in Alzheimer
  and Parkinson disease. Inhibition of PDE1B may improve cognitive function and memory
  impairment.
