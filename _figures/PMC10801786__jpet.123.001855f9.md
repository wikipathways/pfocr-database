caption: Mechanism of proposed combined CBD and AT antinociception. CBD acts as a
  positive allosteric modulator at 5-HT1A receptors, which are Gi/o coupled receptors
  located both as presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic heteroreceptors. These
  receptors are associated with enhanced potassium conductance, depressed calcium
  conductance, inhibition of PLCβ, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and indirect alteration
  of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway. The autoreceptor
  attenuates release of serotonin while activation of the heteroreceptor is associated
  with analgesic and anti-depressive effects. AT is associated with, among other effects,
  inhibition of the serotonin reuptake transporter to increase synaptic serotonin.
  The use of AT with CBD offsets the attenuation of serotonin release by 5-HT1A autoreceptors
  to allow for enhanced synaptic serotonin acting at 5-HT1A postsynaptic heteroreceptors
  that have been enhanced by CBD’s actions as a positive allosteric modulator. Created
