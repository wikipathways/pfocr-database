caption: 'Models of TGF-β and Hippo Pathway Signaling Cross Talk(A) The initial model
  contains binding of Taz/Yap to the complex of pSmad2/3-Smad4, which forms upon activation
  of the pathway by TGF-β addition. Since Taz/Yap localization is not altered by TGF-β
  and Taz/Yap is not involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the Smad complex,
  these steps (red arrows) are not considered in the simplified model.(B) In the Receptor
  Activity Alteration (RAA) model, Taz/Yap still binds to the Smad complex; however,
  the binding has no effect on Smad nuclear accumulation, rather Taz/Yap alters receptor
  activity.(C) In the Retention Factor (CRF or DRF) models there is a retention factor
  (X) in the nucleus, which binds to the complex of pSmad23-Smad4-Taz/Yap in a ligand-dependent
  manner. Factor X is either constant (Constant Retention Factor: CRF) or downregulated
  by the factor , in the range [0 1] upon knocking down Taz/Yap (Downregulated Retention
  Factor: DRF).'
