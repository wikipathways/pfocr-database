  human adipose-derived MSC (A), (B), (C), which generated using ReactomeFIPlugIn
  in Cytoscape (B and C—enlarged parts of the image A). The obtained results are presented
  as part of Reactfoam according to the cellular function using a false discovery
  rate (FDR) scalebar (p-value ranging from 0–0.05)
