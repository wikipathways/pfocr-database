caption: HIV-1 life cycle, assembly pathway, and assembly plate screen. (A) Schematic
  showing each step of the HIV-1 life cycle, beginning with expression of the integrated
  provirus, followed by the late and early stages of the life cycle, ending with integration
  in a newly infected cell. The different stages of the virus life cycle are indicated
  in blue text. Examples of ARV drugs currently in use are in red text, with black
  labels under blockade arrows indicating the targets of these drugs. The pink line
  indicates late events in the viral life cycle that are not targeted by currently
  approved ARV drugs. (B) Schematic showing the host-catalyzed HIV-1 assembly pathway,
  starting with Gag synthesis and formation of the early ∼10S assembly intermediate.
  Next, the cytosolic ∼80S intermediate forms when ∼10S Gag coopts a host RNP complex
  that contains ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6, two host enzymes that have
  been shown to facilitate assembly. The ∼80S assembly intermediate appears to target
  to the plasma membrane where Gag multimerization continues resulting in formation
  of the ∼150S and subsequently the ∼500S late assembly intermediate. When assembly
  of ∼750S immature capsid is completed, the host RNP complex is released. Relevant
  references are in the text. (C) Schematic showing the cell-free protein synthesis
  and assembly plate screen that was utilized to identify small molecule inhibitors
  of the host-catalyzed pathway of HIV-1 assembly. Briefly, anti-Gag antibody (capture
  antibody) binds Gag monomers, oligomers, and multimers generated in a cell-free
  assembly reaction. The same Gag antibody is used as a detection antibody that binds
  to captured oligomers and multimers, but not monomers, in proportion to the amount
  of multimerization, thereby generating a larger fluorescent signal when multimerization
  occurs. The upper diagram shows anti-Gag antibodies capturing and detecting Gag
  oligomers and multimers in assembly intermediates formed during an HIV-1 cell-free
  assembly reaction carried out in the presence of DMSO, which does not inhibit assembly.
  The lower diagram shows that adding an assembly inhibitor at the start of the cell-free
  reaction causes fewer Gag oligomers and multimers to be produced, thereby reducing
  the detection antibody signal relative to signal in the DMSO control.
