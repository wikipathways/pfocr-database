caption: A schematic illustration of the major pathways involved in the unique response
  of ADY5 to sub-optimal growth temperature (12 °C). Under anaerobic conditions, the
  TCA pathway operates as an oxidative branch and a reductive branch. Broken grey
  lines represent the point at which the cycle may be interrupted. The precise step
  of interruption in yeast cells is not yet identified. The proteins are highlighted
  in green (upregulated) or red (downregulated), indicating their enhancement or repression
  compared to the levels observed at control temperature (30 °C). In this figure are
  represented only the proteins significantly altered exclusively in ADY5 strain.
  The proteins common to other strains were not represented.
