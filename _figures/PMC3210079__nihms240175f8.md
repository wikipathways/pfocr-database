caption: The present findings, together with our previous results on an interaction
  between Twist1 and EphA4 (), place Twist1 at the top of a regulatory hierarchy,
  controlling two independent pathways, Jagged1/Notch and ephrinA-EphA. Twist1 positively
  regulates Jagged1 in sutural mesenchyme. Jagged1 represses Notch2. Jagged1/Notch
  functions in the initial specification of sutural cells and in the boundary between
  the osteogenic and non-osteogenic compartments in the coronal suture. Jagged1 is
  also required to exclude β-catenin, P-Smad1/5/8, and P-Erk1/2 from sutural cells.
  Twist1 is required for the expression of EphA4 and ephrinA2 in the ectocranial mesenchyme
  (). EphrinA-EphA signaling, functioning through the RTK pathway, controls the guidance
  of osteogenic cells along the ectocranial mesenchyme to their destinations in the
  developing frontal and parietal bones. A failure of this process results in mis-migration
  of osteogenic precursor cells into the coronal suture. Heterozygous loss of Twist1
  function results in downregulation of both EphA4 and Jagged1 and consequent changes
  in osteogenic precursor migration and the osteogenic-non-osteogenic boundary in
  the coronal suture. Genetic combinations of EphA4-/- or Jagged1+/- with Twist1+/-
  exacerbate these defects, as expected. Jagged1 and EphA4 do not influence each other's
  activity. Thus the Notch and ephrinA-EphA pathways act in parallel downstream of
  Twist1.
