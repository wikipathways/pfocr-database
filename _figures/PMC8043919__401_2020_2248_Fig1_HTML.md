caption: Norepinephrine biosynthetic and signaling pathways in locus coeruleus neurons.
  l-tyrosine is converted into norepinephrine by a series of enzymatic reactions [,
  ]. Antibody immunoreactivity to key enzymes in the norepinephrine pathway is commonly
  used as markers of norepinephrine neurons []. norepinephrine is released at the
  synapse, where it binds to G-coupled α- and β-adrenoreceptors to exert its neuromodulatory
  effects. Agents such as l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine [] can bypass the pathway and
  directly increase levels of norepinephrine and, thus, could be used as a potential
  therapy to compensate for norepinephrine loss following locus coeruleus de-innervation.
