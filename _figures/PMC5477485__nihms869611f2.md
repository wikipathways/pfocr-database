caption: A conserved insulin-signaling pathway in the ovary. Activation of the IR
  leads to activation of cellular signaling pathways, whose members have orthologs
  among all metazoans. The most conserved is the PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathway. The RAS/ERK
  signaling cascade downstream of insulin signaling is not yet documented in flies
  (blue box). Included with the well-characterized and conserved function of the insulin
  signaling pathway in mediating glucose homeostasis, metabolism, growth, is its regulation
  of reproduction, specifically oogenesis (see text for details).
