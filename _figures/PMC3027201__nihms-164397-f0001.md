caption: During the final stages of differentiation, splicing factors accumulate in
  the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. The splicing components, along with specific pre-mRNAs,
  are transferred to anucleate platelets. Stimulated platelets activate their splicing
  machinery and generate mature mRNAs that are subsequently translated into protein.
  This novel pathway of control provides platelets with a mechanism to alter their
  transcriptome and proteome profile in response to cellular activation.
