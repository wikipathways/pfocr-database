caption: 'Inflammation: PI3K/Akt pathway mediates eNOS activation which could inhibit
  VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. BBB disruption: Inhibition of GSK3β was
  shown to promote tight junction stability in BBB and insulin enhanced the BBB integrity
  via PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway. Aβ accumulation: Insulin exposure promoted Aβ degradation
  via an increase in insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression in astrocytes, via
  activation of the ERK-mediated pathway. In neurons, Aβ exposure was shown to induce
  insulin resistance by inhibiting IRS1, PDK-dependent Akt activation, and activating
  p38 pathway. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that Aβ could have a similar
  effect on these pathways in BBB endothelial cells.'
