caption: Role of the Wnt signaling pathway in prostate cancer bone metastasis. Prostate
  cancer cells have both osteolytic and osteoblastic potential. Early in skeletal
  metastasis, prostate cancer cells produce pro-osteolytic factors such as receptor
  activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and parathyroid hormone-related
  protein (PTHrP) that stimulate osteoclastogenesis and also produce an inhibitor
  of osteoblastic activity, dickkopf-1 (DKK1). The resulting osteolytic activity releases
  growth factors from the bone and alters the bone microenvironment, which in turn
  alters the phenotype of prostate cancer cells. The prostate cancer cells start to
  produce osteoblastic factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), PTHrP (which
  can act as an anabolic factor) and factors that inhibit osteclastogenic activity,
  such as, osteoprotegerin (OPG), which blocks RANKL. Additionally, DKK-1 expression
  is decreased resulting in the osteoblastic phase.
