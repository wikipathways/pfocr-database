caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms of carvacrol cytoprotection
  against Fe2+-induced apoptosis. Fe2+ stimulates mitochondrial ROS generation and
  MAPK/JNK and IKK phosphorylation, which may promote NF-κB activation and nuclear
  translocation. Increased nuclear binding of NF-κB induces the increased expression
  of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), which activate downstream apoptotic
  signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in cell death. Carvacrol reduces Fe2+-induced
  cell apoptosis by inactivating the MAPK/JNK-NF-κB signaling pathway.
