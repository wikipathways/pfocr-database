caption: Meiotic recombination. (a–c) Double-strand break (DSB) formation and resection.
  DSB formation is catalyzed by the Spo11 enzyme (orange ovals) (b). Endonuclease
  activity releases Spo11 covalently bound to an oligonucleotide, and 5′-to-3′ exonuclease
  activity exposes single-stranded (ss) 3′ ends. Recombinases such as Rad51 and/or
  Dmc1 coat the ssDNA tail and catalyze strand invasion into the intact DNA duplex
  of a homologous chromosome (c). (d–f) Crossover pathway. Invasion of the Rad51/Dmc1-containing
  nucleoprotein filament results in an asymmetric strand-exchange intermediate (d).
  DNA synthesis (dashed line) is primed from the invading 3′ end. The second end is
  captured and primes DNA synthesis. Ligation produces a double Holliday junction
  (DHJ) (e). The DHJ is resolved by an unknown enzyme to produce a mature crossover
  with the exchange of flanking DNA (f). (g–i) Noncrossover pathway by synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing (SDSA). Strand invasion (g) and DNA synthesis (h) are inferred
  but have not been experimentally detected. The newly synthesized DNA strand is displaced
  and anneals with the other DSB end; break repair is accomplished by DNA synthesis
  and ligation.
