caption: On detection of stimuli, the first step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  initiates starting from the activation of the NF-κB pathway and subsequent transcription
  of components from the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. In the second canonical activation
  step of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an active assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome complex
  is formed which is triggered with the efflux or influx of ions, reactive oxygen
  species among other signals. Activated and fully formed NLRP3 inflammasome complex
  then converts IL-1β, IL-18 cytokines, and gasdermin D into their activated forms.
  In the non-canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, sensing of cytosolic
  LPS by caspases triggers the formation of an active NLRP3 inflammasome assembly
  by the efflux of K+ ions subsequently leading to the release of cytokines and other
  mediators. Created with Biorender.com.
