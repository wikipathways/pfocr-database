caption: Schematic diagram of the shikimate and aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathways
  in plants. Only some of the enzymes are depicted. Dashed black arrows represent
  several enzymatic steps. Red arrows represent enzymatic steps carried by the heterologously
  expressed bacterial enzymes AroG* and PheA*. DAHPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-2-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate synthase; CM, chorismate mutase; PDT, prephenate dehydretase.
