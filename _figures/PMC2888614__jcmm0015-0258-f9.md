caption: Schematic diagram of the signalling pathway activated by B1R agonists leading
  to iNOS-derived high output nitric oxide. Expression of iNOS and the B1R are induced
  under inflammatory conditions. iNOS has constitutive activity, which can be further
  enhanced by B1R agonists DABK, DAKD or ACE inhibitors via B1R-dependent activation
  of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway as shown. This results in phosphorylation of iNOS
  at Ser745, leading to generation of high output nitric oxide in endothelial cells.
