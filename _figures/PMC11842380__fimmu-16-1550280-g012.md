  likely modify the balance of macrophages and immunoregulatory macromolecules in
  M0/M1 polarized macrophages by inhibiting signaling pathway A and enhancing signaling
  pathway B, leading to a shift towards immunosuppressive macromolecules and the M2
  phenotype. (A) Mitochondrial oxidative stress: An increase in HIF-1 α expression
  results in heightened activity of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways,
  leading to greater production of NADPH oxidase and Inducible nitric oxide synthase
  enzymes, which subsequently generate hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in these
  cells. The levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide can influence cell
  survival differently, depending on their concentration. They have the potential
  to activate the NF-κB pathway and disrupt cellular membrane homeostasis, which diminishes
  antioxidant defenses. This disruption may trigger the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway through the activation of cytochrome c and the cleavage of caspase 3 and
  caspase 7. Additionally, it can initiate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway by activating
  ASK1 and JNK; Oxidative stress induced by LPS: Within the TLR/Myd-88/NF-κB signaling
  pathway, IκB undergoes degradation, and RelA (p65)/p50 gets phosphorylated, enabling
  their entry into the nucleus as a complex. For the activation of specific target
  genes regulated by NF-κB, the RelA (p65)/p50 subunit must engage with CBP/p300.
  The pathways activated by LPS-TLR and ROS-NFκB disrupt antioxidant defenses, leading
  to heightened release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; M1 macrophage polarization
  occurs when there is an elevation in the activation of NF-κB and STAT1, along with
  the stimulation of Notch1 and NF-kappa B by LPS and toll-like receptors, as well
  as the activation of IRF5 in response to inflammation. This results in a predominance
  of M1 macrophages, which perform proinflammatory functions that can harm tissues.
  Furthermore, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is significantly linked to the functional
  characteristics of macrophages, and IFN influences their activities via this pathway.
  (B) The increase in M2 macrophage polarization, which is associated with immune
  tolerance and tissue repair, is mainly driven by the activation of STAT3 and STAT6
  via IL-4/13 and IL-10. PPARδ and PPARγ play roles in regulating various aspects
  of M2 macrophage activation and oxidative metabolism. KLF-4, which is activated
  by STAT6, enhances M2 macrophage functions by suppressing NF-κB/HIF-1α-dependent
  transcription. IL-4 triggers the activation of c-Myc and IRF-4, which manage the
  expression of genes related to M2 polarization and inhibit IRF5-mediated M1 polarization.
  IL-10 promotes M2 polarization by activating the p50 NF-κB homodimer, c-Maf, and
  STAT3. CD9 interacts with FcγRs, influencing phagocytosis signaling pathways and
  inflammatory responses, while also inhibiting M1 macrophage activation by LPS and
  TNF-α by preventing the localization of CD14 into lipid rafts. CD81 interacts with
  Rac1 to block the downstream activation of STAT1 through interferon-alpha/beta receptor
  signaling'
