caption: HO-1 as a stimulator (A) and inhibitor (B) of osteoblastogenesis. HO-1 activates
  PI3K/Akt and pAMPK signaling pathway and reduces ROS level, inducing differentiation
  and viability of osteoblasts. Additionally, HO-1 may induce osteoblastogenesis via
  activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. It could also interfere with differentiation
  process by potentially decreasing miRNAs involved in regulation of transcriptional
  cascade of Runx2 (miR-133, miR-211, miR182, and miR-29a). By modulating the level
  of miR-210 and miR-206, HO-1 could induce BMP2 signaling and expression of Cx43.
  On the other hand, HO-1 decreases expression of Runx2 and markers of differentiated
  osteoblasts, what is mediated by CO and bilirubin, and could be also achieved by
  decreased activity of c/EBPδ. HO-1 may possibly induce miR-135, a repressor of Runx2,
  and reduce miR-29b, what induces differentiation by affecting Wnt/β-catenin and
  BMP2 signaling. Nrf2, an HO-1 inducer, abolishes Runx2 activity. Black—effects exerted
  by HO-1; gray—known pathways of osteoblastogenesis; spots—hypothetical mechanisms
  regulated by HO-1 in differentiating osteoblasts. (→)—induction; ()—, inhibition;
  (+)—in cooperation with. BMP2, bone morphogenic protein 2.
