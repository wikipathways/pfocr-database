caption: Model showing the role of iRhom2 as a positive regulator of PM2.5-induced
  renal injury. iRhom2 played an essential role in regulating the progression of renal
  injury in PM2.5-exposed mice, most likely through activating TACE/TNFRs and IκBα/NF-κB
  signaling pathways to promote inflammation. In addition, iRhom2 inactivated HO-1/Nrf-2
  pathway, whereas activated JNK expression to enhance oxidative stress, thus exacerbating
  renal injury.

  suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress.
