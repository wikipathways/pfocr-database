caption: 'Regulation of IL-1/18 production and current IL-1/18 antagonists. Pathogen-
  and danger-associated molecular patterns can induce the formation of a functional
  inflammasome via events including mitochondrial stress with release of oxidized
  mtDNA, ROS, lysosomal destabilization with cathepsin B release, changes in intracellular
  calcium (Ca2+) and potassium (K+) efflux. Also, mutations of NACHT-PYD domains of
  NLRP3 in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) lead to the activation of
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. Similarly, mutations of B30.2 domains in familial Mediterranean
  fever (FMF) and of PSTPIP1 in PAPA syndrome or accumulation of geranylgeranylated
  proteins (GG-proteins) in mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) lead to activation
  of the pyrin inflammasome. Activated inflammasomes recruit procaspase-1 via the
  adaptor ASC. Autocatalytically cleaved and activated caspase-1 can then process
  IL-1β and IL-18. The secreted cytokines bind to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1:IL-1RaP)
  and IL-18 receptor (IL-18Rα:IL-18Rβ), respectively, resulting in NF-κB and MAPKs
  signaling. Soluble IL-1R1 (sIL-1R1), IL-1R2 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP)
  can block the signaling pathway. Caspase-1 activity can be modulated by the specific
  inhibitors Pralnacasan and Belnacasan. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  can be inhibited with Glibenclamide and curcumin inhibiting or downregulating the
  ATP-sensitive K+-channels P2X7, respectively; with Resveratrol increasing autophagy
  and inhibiting mitochondrial stress; and with the specific NLRP3 inhibitors MCC950
  and BHB. Anakinra and the secreted IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), absent in
  deficiency of IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) patients, compete with IL-1β and IL-1α
  (not shown) for binding to the IL-1 receptor. Rilonacept acts as a soluble decoy
  binding IL-1β and with lower affinity IL-1α (not shown) and IL-1Ra. The recombinant
  antibodies Canakinumab, Gevokizumab, LY2189102, and P2D7KK specifically target and
  neutralize IL-1β. Similarly, GSK-1070806 and MABp1 inhibits IL-18 and IL-1α (not
  shown), respectively. Blue arrows: inhibitory effect; dotted arrow: low affinity;
  ASC, apoptosis associated speck-like domain protein containing a CARD; MSU, monosodium
  urate; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
