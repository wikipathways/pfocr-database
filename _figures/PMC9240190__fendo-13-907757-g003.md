caption: 'PPARα-related, AMPK/mTOR, and SIRT3/FOXO3a signaling pathways. PPARα-related
  signaling pathway: The PPARα complex is activated in the diabetic state. PPARα binds
  to PPREs with its heterodimeric partner RXR, regulating the expression of target
  genes. This upregulates CD36, inhibits GLUT4 translocation, inhibits the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, and inhibits Ca2+ uptake. AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway: In the diabetic
  heart, mitochondrial dysfunction causes a low AMP/ATP ratio, activation of LKB1,
  and consequent activation of AMPK. AMPK suppresses mTORC1 activation via two pathways.
  Firstly, AMPK directly phosphorylates and inhibits Raptor; secondly, it activates
  TSC2, and TSC2 forms a complex with TSC1, which inhibits the activity of Rheb, thereby
  blocking mTORC1 activation. PI3K/AKT signaling is important in mTORC1 activation
  because it recruits Rheb and inhibits autophagy by inhibiting AMPK. In addition,
  ULK1 is another regulator in autophagy, and mTOR inhibits ULK1 activation and autophagy.
  SIRT3/FOXO3a signaling pathway: SIRT3 regulates autophagy through several mechanisms.
  First, SIRT3 deacetylates MnSOD. Second, SIRT3 expression is high during cardiomyocyte
  stress, leading to the deacetylation of FOXO3a, which is translocated to the nucleus
  where it initiates the transcription of FOXO-dependent antioxidant genes SOD and
  catalase. PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; PPREs, peroxisome
  proliferator response elements; RXR, retinoid X receptor; CD36, cluster of differentiation
