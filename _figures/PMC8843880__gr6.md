caption: Gamma-secretase inhibitors inhibit Wnt and Notch pathways. Gamma-secretase
  inhibitors (GSIs) reduce breast cancer progression by targeting Wnt and Notch pathways.
  GSIs inhibits Notch signaling by preventing the release of Notch ICD via blocking
  the cleavage of Notch, and Wnt pathway by preventing the release of β-catenin via
  blocking the cleavage of E-cadherin and CD44 signaling by preventing the release
  of CD44 ICD via blocking the cleave of CD44 through targeting gamma-secretase.
