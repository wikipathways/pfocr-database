caption: 'A comprehensive illustration of Androgen signaling, one-carbon metabolism,
  and metabolic phenotype. (A) One-carbon metabolism involves a complex network with
  four pathways: (1) folate cycle; (2) methionine cycle; (3) transsulfuration pathway;
  (4) sarcosine pathway. In the prostate, androgens and the AR regulate the activity/expression
  of several enzymes involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Enzyme abbreviations
  are as follows: SARDH: Sarcosine Dehydrogenase; SHMT: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase;
  GNMT: Glycine-N-methyltransferase; MTHFR: Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase;
  MAT: Methionine adenosyltransferase; AHCY: S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; CBS:
  Cystathionine beta-synthase; CTH: cystathione gamma-lyase or gamma-cystathionase.
  (B) Hypothetical cycle of metabolism involving glycine, serine, ethanolamine, choline,
  and betaine. [] (C) Enhanced lipogenesis, arising from increased activities of fatty
  acid biosynthetic enzymes (including ACC1, FASN, and stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD1)),
  is a metabolic hallmark of many cancer cells. [-] In addition, the plasma membrane
  of normal cells is characterized by an asymmetric distribution of various phospholipids
  over two membrane leaflet. PE resides in the inner leaflet facing the cytosol. The
  disrupted membrane asymmetry of cancer cell exposes PE to extracellular space. Furthermore,
  PE is also highly exposed on endothelium cells in tumor vasculature. PA, phosphatidic
  acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; DAG, diacylglycerol; CDP-ethanolamine, Cytidine diphosphate
  ethanolamine.'
