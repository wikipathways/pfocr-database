caption: Model of Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)1
  and NOD2 signaling cascades. NOD1 and NOD2 recognize bacterial peptidoglycans (PGNs),
  (iE-DAP), and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), respectively. Following ligand sensing the
  NODs recruit their common adaptor receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (RIP)2 by caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)–CARD interactions
  and induce RIP2 to undergo phosphorylation. The members of the tumor necrosis factor
  receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family (TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6), the inhibitor
  of apoptosis (IAP) family (XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2), and the B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2
  family (BID) bind to RIP2 and facilitate its ubiquitination allowing the recruitment
  of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK)1 and ubiquitinated nuclear
  factor (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO) to the nodosome. On one hand, NEMO instigates
  activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating NF-κB inhibitor kinase
  (IKK)α and IKKβ, by inducing nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer
  in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκBα) phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, and
  by freeing p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits. On the other hand, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) recruits, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase binding
  protein (TAB)1 and TAB2/3 inducing both (p38, extracellular-signal Regulated Kinases
  = ERK, and JUN N-terminal kinases = JNK) mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  and NF-κB activation. Stimulation of both arms culminates in the induction of anti-microbial
  peptides (AMPs), cytokines, and chemokines. The formation of the nodosome promotes
  autophagy and conversely, a fully functional autophagy machinery helps in signal
  transduction through the nodosome. Autophagy-related protein (ATG)16L1 along with
  ATG5 and ATG12 is required for autophagosome formation, however, independently of
  its autophagy functions, ATG16L1 negatively regulates NOD/RIP2 signaling ().
