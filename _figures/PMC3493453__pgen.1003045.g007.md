caption: Our results identify transcriptional repression of TSC2 as a required step
  in the induction of EC differentiation by the Notch signaling pathway. This regulation
  integrates with Insulin-mediated repression of TSC2 function to promote EC growth
  and endoreplication. Under conditions of low Notch activation, TSC2 expression in
  EBs remains high and prevents growth of cells differentiating into EE cells. Similarly,
  in ISCs, high TSC2 expression serves as a ‘buffer’ from nutritional changes that
  increase IIS activity or can otherwise activate the TOR pathway, thus promoting
  ISC maintenance.
