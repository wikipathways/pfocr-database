caption: 'Figure 6. The relationships between hypoxia, HIF-1, mTOR and geroconversion.
  (A) Under normoxia, when the cell cycle is arrested, still active mTOR drives cellular
  senescence. mTOR is activated by nutrients, mitogens, cytokines and oxygen. As a
  part of geroconversion, mTOR stimulates cytokine secretion. Black lines: stimulatory
  and inhibitory effects. Blue lines: inactive under normoxia. (B) Under severe hypoxia,
  the mTOR pathway and geroconversion are partially inhibited. Hypoxia-inducible factor
  (HIF) is accumulated. HIF-1-dependent cytokine secretion may activate the mTOR pathway
  in neighboring oxygenated cells. Blue lines, inactive under hypoxia.'
