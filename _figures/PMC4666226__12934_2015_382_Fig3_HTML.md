caption: 'Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) degradation pathway in E. coli. a The
  degradation pathway initiates with the conversion of PtdEtn into 2-acyl-GPE by the
  apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase Lnt as shown in Fig. , or by the outer membrane
  phospholipase A PldA. b After the 2-acyl-GPE formation, in the periplasm, the lysophospholipase
  L2 PldB, hydrolyzes the bond to the remaining acyl group of the lysophospholipid,
  generating a fatty acid and glycerophosphodiester molecules. c Later, the glycerophosphoryl
  diester phosphodiesterase GlpQ enzyme, hydrolyzes the glycerophosphodiesters molecules
  into G3P and ethanolamine. The products of the degradation, G3P and FA are internalized
  by the cell through the GlpT and FadD transporters and can be further metabolized
  through the glycolytic and β-oxidation pathway, respectively. E. coli can also use
  ethanolamine as source of carbon and nitrogen []; however, a transporter is not
