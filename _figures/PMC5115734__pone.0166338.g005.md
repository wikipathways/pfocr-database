caption: Primary endosymbiosis (PE) gave rise to the Archaeplastida comprising red
  algae, green algae and glaucophytes. Following the divergence of main eukaryotic
  lineages, secondary (SE) or tertiary endosymbiosis (TE) events equipped the ancestors
  of CASH taxa (cryptophytes, alveolates, stramenopiles and haptophytes) with photosynthetic
  capabilities. Contradictory evidence has been debated over the last years as for
  the history of CASH plastid acquisitions (e.g. [,,]). A plastid-early scenario (the
  chromalveolate hypothesis) posits that all CASH taxa are monophyletic and the CASH
  plastid was vertically transferred (dashed red line) and lost in extant non-photosynthetic
  descendants (such as ciliates and most rhizarians). Plastid-late scenarios require
  multiple lateral acquisitions of the CASH plastid (question marks) but better reflect
  some current phylogenomic analyses of the plastid recipients (e.g. [,]). Loss of
  photosynthesis/plastids have been documented in many sister lineages, such as oomycetes
  or apicomplexans, however these are in line with plastid-late scenarios as well.
  A cryptic SE with a CASH alga or numerous HGT (red arrows) events are inferred before
  the divergence of extant chlorarachniophytes (this work, []), which was masked by
  the acquisition of the current green algal endosymbiont. A similar situation in
  L. chlorophorum led to the peridinin plastid replacement with a green plastid, however
  the majority of red-related heme pathway enzymes remained functionally conserved
  in the successor plastid. The loss of the heterotrophic pathway possibly occurred
  several times independently in the stramenopile and dinoflagellate lineages, as
  Perkinsus marinus, sister to dinoflagellates, still contains a functional mitochondrial-cytosolic
  pathway [].
