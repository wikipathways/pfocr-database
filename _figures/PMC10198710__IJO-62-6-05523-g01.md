caption: m6A methylases that participate in cancer glycolytic metabolic pathways.
  Cancer cells rely on glycolytic pathways to meet their energy needs for growth and
  proliferation, and m6A-associated enzymes participate in the cancer glycolytic pathway.
  The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is able to promote glycolysis and tumor progression
  through m6A modification-mediated downstream targets (PDK4, GLUT1, HK2, GLUT1, GLUT4
  and ENO2). METTL14 inhibits glycolysis and tumor progression by accelerating the
  degradation of BPTF mRNA. WTAP is able to mediate the glycolytic process of tumors
  and promote tumor progression through either upregulating ENO1 expression or enhancing
  the stability of HK2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. ALKBH5 has a dual effect on
  the glycolytic pathway, on one hand attenuating CK2α, and on the other hand increasing
  the stability of GLUT4 mRNA, thereby promoting the glycolysis of breast cancer cells.
  FTO inhibits glycolysis and thyroid cancer growth by reducing the stability of apoE
  mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. Finally, YTHDF1 enhances glycolysis by improving
  the protein translation of PKM2, thereby promoting the progression of breast cancer.
