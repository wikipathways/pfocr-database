caption: CluePedia analysis example using expression data from human normal colon
  mucosa and colorectal tumors and in silico information. (a) Functionally grouped
  network with pathways and genes. Terms are linked based on κ score (≥0.3). Edges
  show known activation (green), expression (yellow), post-translational modification
  (pink) and binding (blue). The edge thickness is scaled between the minimum and
  maximum scores shown. Terms and their associated genes share the color. ‘Regulation
  of IFNG signaling’ pathway is investigated in a subnetwork. (b) Genes not included
  in the initial selection are colored in white. Known interactions are shown. (c)
  Gene interrelations in normal samples are shown as Pearson correlation (blue) and
  MIC (orange), all values >0.7. Normalized expression data from five normal colon
  samples are shown as node label for IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. All spots corresponding to
  a gene are shown. (d) Pathway-like view of the network showing cellular locations.
  (e) ‘Regulation of IFNG signaling’ after enrichment steps. Five strongest correlating
  genes (Pearson) in normal colon and tumors, as well as the top five validated and
  predicted miRNAs (prediction score) are shown in blue, red, brown and beige, respectively.
  Negative correlations are shown as sinusoidal lines
