caption: Biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol. Supplementation
  of inositol has been related to an improved production of phosphatidylinositol,
  being it the precursor. At the same time, inositol supplementation has been related
  to an increased production of phosphatidylcholine by modulation of CTP-phosphatidylcholine-cytidylyltransferase
  regulation with increased activity. CTP-phosphatidylcholine-cytidylyltransferase
  enzyme is the rate-limiting and regulated step in the CDP-choline pathway for the
  synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, and it is primarily regulated by multiple post-transcriptional
  mechanisms that improve the function by stabilizing the enzyme and favoring the
  translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane.
