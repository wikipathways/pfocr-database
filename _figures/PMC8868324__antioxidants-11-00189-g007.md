caption: Schematic depicting the regulation of Nrf2 and Nox1 by GIP during glutamate-induced
  ferroptosis in HT-22 cells. Excessive glutamate inactivates GPX4 function to induce
  lipid ROS accumulation. Overexpression of GIP attenuates ferroptosis by regulating
  Nrf2 and Nox1 ferroptosis factor through MAPK signal pathway. G1/S phase arrest
  induced by ferroptosis can be normalised in GIP-overexpressing HT-22 cells.
