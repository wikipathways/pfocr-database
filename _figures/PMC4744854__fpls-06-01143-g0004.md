caption: Schematic representation of plant hormone-mediated alleviation of heavy metal
  toxicity in plants. Heavy metals' signals are perceived by receptors, and receptors
  transduce signals via cAMP, pH, etc. causing alterations in electron transport systems
  of the cell, which results into an excess production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). ROS cause damage to macromolecules and thus create oxidative stress inside
  the cell. On the other hand, in the presence of plant hormones, signals received
  by them initiate a cascade of signal transduction involving haem oxygenase, two
  transcription factors induced by brassinosteroids (BES1 and BZR1) and a gibberellic
  acid-mediated GA-GID1-DELLA signaling pathway. These factors, in turn, initiate
  expression of the nuclear genes encoding defense proteins, transcription factors
  (TFs), heat shock proteins (HSP), and metal transporter proteins (MTs). MTs protect
  electron transport chains against heavy metals by regulating their uptake. Defense
  proteins protect plant against ROS under heavy metal stress (Numbers 1 and 2 designated
  to chloroplast and mitochondria show the sources of ROS in cell).
