caption: Schematic overview of downstream ALK signaling through MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathways. ALK is a classical receptor tyrosine kinase consisting of an
  extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular
  tyrosine kinase domain. In ALK fusions such as KIF5B-ALK, the amino-terminal fusion
  partner is fused to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of ALK, leading to
  constitutive activation of downstream signaling, including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK)
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. MAPK pathway activation ultimately leads to
  phosphorylation of downstream ERK, which can enter the nucleus and increase the
  transcription of various effector genes, including the gene encoding for Cyclin
  D1 (CCND1). Translation of CCND1 messenger RNA to the Cyclin D1 protein is mTOR-dependent.
