caption: Summary of proinflammatory immune response in BV-2 microglial cells induced
  by NfEVs. NfEVs initially stimulate BV-2 microglial cells via the MyD88-dependent
  TLR-2/TLR-4 pathway. The NF-κB dependent MAPK pathways regulate the production of
  proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in NfEVs-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells.
  Cerdulatinib, a JAK-STAT inhibitor, also downregulated phosphorylation of ERK, suggesting
  that the ERK is also affected by the JAK-STAT pathway. The image was created using
  BioRender (https://biorender.com/, accessed on 28 September 2022).
