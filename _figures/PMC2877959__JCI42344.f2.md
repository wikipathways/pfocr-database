caption: Antioxidant activities. (A) Peroxynitrites (ONOO–) are produced from the
  reaction of nitric oxide (NO•) with superoxide (O2–•). Peroxynitrites can induce
  protein nitrosation and lipid and protein peroxidation and block tetrahydrobiopterin
  (HB4), a cofactor necessary for NOS activity. In the absence of HB4, NOS produces
  ROS. Uric acid (UA) can directly inactivate peroxynitrite by a reaction that generates
  uric acid radicals (UA•); these can be rapidly eliminated by plasma ascorbic acid.
  (B) Uric acid can also prevent Cu2+-induced oxidation of LDL, a reaction that may
  protect against atherosclerosis development. (C) By enhancing arginase activity,
  uric acid diverts l-arginine from NO production to urea production. Uric acid can
  also directly react with NO to generate nitrosated uric acid, and the nitroso group
  can then be transferred to glutathione (GSH) for transport to another recipient
  molecule. In the presence of oxygen, uric acid reacts with NO to produce the stable
  species 6-aminouracil. Uric acid uptake in adipocytes activates NADPH oxidase and
  increase production of ROS, which can initiate an inflammatory reaction. In vascular
  smooth muscle cells, uric acid can activate the NF-κB and MAPK pathway and increase
  cyclooxygenase and MCP-1 production. Blue arrows, chemical reactions; green arrows,
  products from enzymatic or signaling pathways; red arrows, activation of enzymatic
  activities.
