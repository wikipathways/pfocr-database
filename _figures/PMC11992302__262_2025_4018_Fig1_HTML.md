caption: 'Mechanism of action of PD-1 and PD-L1 in melanoma, a Schematic diagram of
  the process of melanoma proliferation, infiltration and migration from the primary
  site. This process is closely related to the tumor microenvironment. b Schematic
  diagram of the mechanism of action of the PD-1: PD-L1 signaling pathway in melanoma.
  The binding of PD-1 and PD-L1 can block the proliferation and activation of T cells,
  and the interaction between PD-L1 expressed by melanoma and PD-1 receptors in neighboring
  melanoma can promote their proliferation and migration'
