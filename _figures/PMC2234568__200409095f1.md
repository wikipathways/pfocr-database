caption: Schematic representation of the several signaling pathways discussed in the
  text that act on M-type (KCNQ) K+ channels. The figure depicts the M1 muscarinic
  receptor (M1R) and the B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R) both using Gq/11 G proteins,
  with the primary mechanism of action being via depletion of PIP2 in the former case,
  and Ca2+–calmodulin (CaM) in the latter case. PLC, GTP/GDP exchange, and the Mg2+
  ion are needed for both signals. PI4-kinase needs ATP to synthesize PI(4)P from
  PI (not depicted is PI(4)P5-kinase that produces PIP2 from PI(4)P). Besides the
  role of the Ca2+ ion in the left pathway, is its requirement at sufficient levels
  for PLC activity, and its putative role in stimulation of PI4-kinase. Association
  between the plasma membrane B2R, but not the M1R, and the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) membrane IP3R specifies bradykinin, but not muscarinic, stimulation to raise
  intracellular Ca2+. IP3 produced by M1R-induced hydrolysis of PIP2 has not been
  shown to have any consequence. A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP) is shown
  recruiting PKC to the channel, where it may sensitize it to depletion of PIP2. Finally,
  Src tyrosine kinase (Src) modulates the channel, seemingly unrelated to G-protein
  actions. References are given in the text.
