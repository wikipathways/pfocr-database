caption: A schematic diagram showing LOX promoting partial EMT in diabetic kidney
  fibrosis. LOX expression is elevated by high glucose via the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  LOX, in turn, stabilizes Snail protein, leading to partial EMT of renal tubular
  epithelial cells, ultimately contributing to diabetic kidney fibrosis
