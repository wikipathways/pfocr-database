caption: Model of alternative splicing regulation in the jasmonate signaling pathway
  mediated by JAZ2 and JAZ7. JA‐Ile (JA) negatively regulates JAZ2 by SCF COI1 complex
  and JAZ7 by other unknown pathways. JAZ2/7 represses the expression of transcription
  factor MYBs and bHLHs. These two types of transcription factors further regulate
  downstream pathways mediated by transcription factors, kinases, or ubiquitin. SKIP
  could interact with the transcription factor and kinases mediated pathways and ALY4
  could interact with the ubiquitin mediated pathways. The SKIP and ALY4 are directly
  or indirectly involved in splicing regulation, which regulates alternative splicing
  of targeted genes (e.g. NUDX9, NRT1.8—Figure ; bHLH16—Figure ) by splicing factors
  SR or hnRNP family proteins
