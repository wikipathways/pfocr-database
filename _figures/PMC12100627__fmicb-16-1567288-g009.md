caption: Diagram of the mechanism by which rSPD promotes in vitro replication of IBRV.
  rSPD and IBRV synergistically activate the NF-kappa B signaling pathway to promote
  the expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-8, CCL3, IL-1β, IL-17, S100A8), leading
  to cellular inflammatory damage. rSPD promotes viral replication by interfering
  with the JAK–STAT signaling pathway and inhibiting the expression of downstream
  antiviral effectors (ISG15, OAS2, MX1, RSAD2, IFIT1). The arrows indicate activation,
  and the blunt-ended lines indicate inhibition. The image was created using the website
