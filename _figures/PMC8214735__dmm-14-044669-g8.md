caption: Schematic, summarizing the cellular events described in this article. Crush
  injury causes damage in the CNS, and triggers a proliferative and immune response
  in glial cells. The glial immune response includes activation of the JNK pathway
  via Grnd and Drpr. Mmp-1 activation, most probably downstream of JNK, also occurs
  upon crush injury. Vesicular transport in neurons is also required to modulate JNK
  activation upon injury. Hemocytes, containing Drpr and Relish and with activated
  JNK, are recruited to the injury site. Diagram created with BioRender.com.
