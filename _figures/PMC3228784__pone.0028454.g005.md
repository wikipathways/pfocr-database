caption: (A) VEGF activation of VEGFR-2 and downstream PLCγ-1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway
  appears to be independent of ROS levels in ECs. (B) VEGF induces NADPH oxidase-derived
  ROS, which in turn oxidizes VEGFR-2 and c-Src. Thiol oxidation of these two tyrosine
  kinases appears to correlate with VEGF-induced activation of c-Src, and also with
  the sub-cellular colocalization and interaction between VEGFR-2 and c-Src. Dependence
  of VEGF-induced thiol oxidation and activation of c-Src on NADPH oxidase-derived
  ROS render downstream activation of PI3K-Akt redox-sensitive in HCAEC. In this model,
  VEGFR-2 and/or c-Src act as endothelial redox-sensors that determine whether downstream
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway should be activated or not.
