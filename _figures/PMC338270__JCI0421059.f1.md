caption: Modification pathway of proteins for isoprenylation/methylation and effects
  of inhibitors of each enzymatic step. Proteins ending with the CAAX motif undergo
  farnesylation in the cytosol. Subsequent removal of three C-terminal amino acids
  and C-terminal methylation are catalyzed by the endoplasmic reticulum–bound enzymes
  Rce1 and Icmt, respectively. Inhibition of Icmt leads to rapid turnover of RhoA,
  increase of p21Cip1, and cell cycle block. R115777, SCH66336, and BMS214662 are
  farnesyltransferase (Ftase) inhibitors, while farnesylcysteine and AdoHcy inhibit
  Icmt.
