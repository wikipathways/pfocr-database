caption: Normal activation of MAPK pathway and pathway response to RAF inhibition.
  a Normal activation of the wild-type cell RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway promotes cell
  growth. b Mutations of the MAPK pathway, especially those of oncogenic BRAFV600E
  in melanoma, result in enhanced signaling in the MAPK pathway and eventual tumor
  formation and growth. In the presence of a BRAF inhibitor that blocks BRAF, MEK–
  ERK signaling in BRAFV600E mutant cells is suppressed, causing tumor shrinkage.
  RTK receptor tyrosine kinase (e.g., KIT, FLT2, PDGF, VEGF), RAS rat sarcoma, RAF
  rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK MAPK/ERK kinase, ERK extracellular signal–
  regulated kinase
