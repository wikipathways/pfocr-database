caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) prediction network of miR-342-3p/-5p and
  cardiovascular disease. Downregulation is shown in green and upregulation in red.
  Orange signifies predicted activation of a molecule or biological function. Paler
  orange signifies a prediction of less activation. Blue signifies the inhibition
  of a molecule or biological function. Orange lines represent stimulation, and blue
  lines inhibition and grey lines reciprocal stimulation and inhibition. Solid uninterrupted
  lines represent a direct action and dashed interrupted lines represent an indirect
  action. It has been predicted, through animal knockout studies, that miR-342-5p
  will activate surfactant protein A1 (SFTPA1) and platelet derived growth factor
  subunit B (PDGFB) which, in turn, will inhibit heart failure and inflammation. miR-342-3p
  activates inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase regulatory subunit gamma (IKBKG),
  mitogen activated 3 kinase 1 (MAP3K1) and also PDGFB, which are responsible for
  inhibiting heart failure and inflammation. It is predicted that D-glucose will activate
  cardiomyopathy, TNF-α and IL-8, and that IL-8 will activate inflammation whilst
  TNF-α activates VEGF-C as well as activating inflammation. As some studies have
  suggested otherwise regarding VEGF-C activating inflammation, this arrow appears
  in grey. It is predicted that IL-7 will activate TNF-α, resulting in activation
  of inflammation, whilst phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3), when activated, is predicted
  to inhibit TNF-α and IL-8.
