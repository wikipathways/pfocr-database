caption: Network visualization of protein and gene expression ratios in metabolic
  hubs linked to amino acid metabolism. The pathway networks for BM45 versus VIN13
  at days 2 (A), 5 (B), and 14 (C) are presented. (D) Changes in gene and protein
  levels for day 5 versus day 2 in VIN13. Visual mapping was used to represent the
  ratios of RNA and proteins as follows. RNA ratios are represented by a linear color
  scale assigned to the interior of each node, and protein ratios are represented
  by a linear color scale assigned to the border of each node. Both of the linear
  color scales are constructed such that the maximum intensity is set to correspond
  to ratios equal to or above a positive or negative 2-fold difference between strains
  or between time points within each strain. The blue scale represents negative ratios,
  while the red scale represents positive ratios. White indicates a ratio of 1, i.e.,
  no difference for that molecule.
