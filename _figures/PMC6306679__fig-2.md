caption: Metabolism of fuel substrates drives the levels of reduced equivalents (NADH
  and NADPH) in normal cardiomyocytes. Normal adult heart obtains 40% of energy from
  metabolism of glucose, lactate, and ketones (mainly βHB), with the remaining 60%
  delivered from FA oxidation (). Glucose uptake into cardiomyocytes is insulin dependent,
  whereas FA and βHB uptake is not hormonally regulated, and is driven by their bloodstream
  availability (FAcirc, βHBcirc) (, ). Glucose enters cardiomyocytes predominantly
  via the insulin-dependent glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and it follows multiple
  metabolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, and polyol pathway
  (with sorbitol and fructose formation), or is shuttled into the hexosamine biosynthetic
  or pentose phosphate pathways (with 6-Phosphogluconate, 6-PG, and ribulose 5-phosphate
  formation). Pyruvate is either converted to lactate or transported into mitochondria
  via the MPC, and converted by PDH to acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) for the TCA cycle. PDH is
  inhibited by pyruvate kinase (PDK4) that is activated by an excess of AcCoA and
  NADH. For simplicity, fluxes through glycogen synthesis and hexosamine pathways
  are not shown. After entry into cardiomyocytes (via CD36 and FA translocase, FAT),
  long chain FA are activated to FA-CoA that is either esterified as triacylglycerol
  (stored in the cytosol, not shown) or enters the mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferases
  (CPT1 and 2), and they are oxidized via FA β-oxidation. The end products of each
  FA β-oxidation cycle are NADH, FADH2, and acetyl-CoA, which are further oxidized
  by ETC complexes or TCA, respectively, ultimately leading to ATP synthesis via mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation. FA β-oxidation is controlled at different steps, including
  the inhibitory effect of malonylCoA (formed from AcCoA via AcCoA carboxylase, ACC),
  FADH2/FAD+ and NADH/NAD+ redox ratios, and acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio, all of which are
  unfavorable to FA oxidation. MalonylCoA is degraded by MCD, thus releasing its inhibitory
  effect on CPT1. The control of FA β-oxidation provided by post-translational modifications
  of β-oxidation enzymes and their transcriptional regulation is not depicted in the
  figure. βHB is the main ketone body utilized by the heart as an energy fuel. Produced
  by the liver at rates that are proportional to FA oxidation and NADH/NAD+ ratio,
  βHB's cardiomyocyte uptake is facilitated by the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1).
  Within mitochondria, βHB is oxidized by mitochondrial βHB dehydrogenase (BDH1) to
  acetoacetate (AcAc) that is converted to acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) by the enzyme
  succinyl-CoA:3 oxoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT). AcAc-CoA is then converted to acetyl-CoA
  for TCA cycle. Mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ redox is unfavorable to the βHB oxidative
  flux (). Cardiac mitochondria can also fully metabolize branched chain amino acids
  (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), providing acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle and succinyl-CoA
  for anaplerosis (not depicted in the figure). TCA cycle is a source of reducing
  equivalents in the form of NADH and NADPH. The figure depicts other sources of reducing
  equivalents. GDH converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate that is coupled to either
  NAD+ or NADP+ reduction. Mitochondrial isoforms of MEs also can reduce NADP+ to
  NADPH. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides more than 95% of the cardiac
  ATP (), with the remainder derived from glycolysis. Electrons are transferred from
  the reducing equivalents, NADH and FADH2, to oxygen by the ETC complexes, whereas
  an electrochemical gradient is built across the mitochondrial IM, which is used
  by the ATP synthase (complex V) to form ATP. Mitochondrial-generated ATP is transferred
  to the cytosol by the mitochondrial and cytosolic creatine kinases (CK) for contractile
  apparatus, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, and other ion pumps. Components of
  the contractile apparatus and calcium handling are affected by oxidative damage
  (, ), supporting a close link between mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox state,
  and myocardial contraction. The inset represents an electron micrograph of cardiac
  muscle showing mouse interfibrillar mitochondria. For simplicity, the nicotinamide
  nucleotide transhydrogenase, a mitochondrial IM enzyme that reduces NADPH+ by oxidizing
  NADH and using the mitochondrial proton motive force, is not shown in this figure.
