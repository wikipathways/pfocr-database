caption: Cu-dependent and epigenetic SOD3 regulation. 1. Cu-dependent pathway. The
  Cu chaperone Atox-1 is expressed in the nucleus under several conditions and binds
  to the proximal promoter region of SOD3. The transcription activity of Atox-1 has
  been confirmed in several cells such as smooth muscle cells and monocytes/macrophages.
  2. Histone de/acetylation pathway. The de/acetylation within the SOD3 promoter is
  involved in its regulation. Our previous studies suggested that MEF2 proteins bind
  to MEF2 response motif (TTAATAATAA) and function as scaffold proteins that interact
  with histone acetyltransferase p300. On the other hand, HDAC1-mediated histone deacetylation
  plays a key role in SOD3 silencing. The lined or dotted arrows indicate the addition
  or removal of histone or DNA marks, respectively. 3. Histone de/methylation pathway.
  Trimethylated-H3K27 is well recognized as the marker of gene reduction. We demonstrated
  that JMJD3, a histone demethylase, reduces the level of H3K27me3 within the SOD3
  promoter region and is involved in its induction. 4. DNA de/methylation pathway.
  DNMTs transfer methyl residues to cytosines within CpG sequences and reduce target
  gene expression. TET1, a DNA demethylase, plays a key role in the removal of methyl
  residues from the SOD3 promoter region, which induces its expression.
