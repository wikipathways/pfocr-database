caption: Proposed model for how Shh signaling pathway negatively regulates its mitogenic
  potential through β-arrestin 1. Activation of Shh signaling leads to cell cycle
  progression via the upregulation/activation of Gli, N-Myc and IRS1. Shh also activates
  a negative feedback loop through its induction and phosphorylation of βArr1, mediating
  its nuclear translocation, where it enhances p27 transcription in complex with CREB
  and p300. This sets the stage for accumulation of p27 to ultimately drive CGNP cell
  cycle exit.
