caption: 'Representation of the Notch signaling pathway: The core proteins Notch and
  DSL ligands, Jagged and Delta-like, bind in cis (inhibition) and trans (activation)
  modes. Notch is a dimer of intracellular (Notch intracellular domain, NICD) and
  extracellular domain (Notch extracellular domain, NECD). (1) The protective dome-like
  NECD is glycosylated by Fringe glycotransferases. DSL ligand is composed of EGF-like
  domains with a Notch-interacting DSL/C2 domain. Posttranslational modifications
  regulate ligand affinity. Upon binding (2), the interaction groove firm binding
  and tension induction triggers endocytosis of DSL ligand (3) and NECD dissociation
  from NICD. Exposed NCID is cleaved by ADAM and γ-secretase (4) to release transcription
  activator NICD domain that regulates HES and HEY gene expression (5). The NECD/DSL
  complex undergoes endocytosis and is proposed to be degraded in the endosome (6).
