caption: Synthesis and metabolism of sphingolipids (SLs). Ceramide is the prototype
  SL, which is synthesized de novo in the ER from serine and palmitoyl-CoA (upper
  left panel). The molecular identity of ceramide is determined by the length of the
  acyl chain linked to the carbon backbone. Six different ceramide synthases (CerS
  1–6) exhibit differential affinity towards fatty acids of different length (C2–C34).
  Once synthesized in the ER, ceramide is transported to the Golgi (upper right panel)
  and serves as the substrate for glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) to generate glucosylceramide
  or sphingomyelin synthases (SMS1/2) to yield sphingomyelin from phosphatidylcholine
  (PC). The distribution and subsequent hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in different membrane
  bilayers by SMases (lower right panel) represents a fast mechanism of almost instant
  ceramide generation. Ceramide can be catabolized by ceramidase (CDase) (lower left
  panel) to generate sphingosine. Sphingosine can be phosphorylated by sphingosine
  kinase (SK) into sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid, which can be
  further degraded by S1P lyase into hexadecenal. In addition, the pool of sphingosine
  generated by CDase can be reacylated by CerS back into ceramide in the so-called
  salvage pathway.
