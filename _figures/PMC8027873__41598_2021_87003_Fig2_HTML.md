caption: STRING diagram representing protein interaction pathway derived from the
  77 proteins quantified in at least 80% of OCT and in none FFPE samples. The average
  local clustering coefficient as reported by STRING is 0.478. Proteins in blue belong
  to the TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport and proteins in green belong
  to the Membrane Trafficking (Reactome Pathways). Proteins in red belong to the Mitochondrial
  part (Cellular Component GO). Obtained from STRING v11 web-based software (https://string-db.org/).
