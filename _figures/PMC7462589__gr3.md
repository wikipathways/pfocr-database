caption: Synthetic Mammalian Display Platforms for the Discovery and Engineering of
  Immune ReceptorsThe construction of large mammalian receptor libraries is becoming
  possible due to novel genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 that can be used
  to introduce diversity in the immune receptor locus of B or T cell lines. These
  cell libraries can be screened using high-throughput methods to assess affinity,
  specificity, and functional activity. For the selection of immune receptors with
  a desired affinity and specificity, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and
  magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) can be utilized. Functional receptor activity
  on the other hand can be assessed via co-culture systems that include a target presenting
  cell line that activates the receptor signaling pathway of the library cell line
  followed by subsequent screening based on signaling activity via FACS.
