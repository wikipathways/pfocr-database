caption: 'Potential role for an ATR inhibitor (ATRi) to overcome immune checkpoint
  inhibitor (ICI)-refractory Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and a clinical trial concept.
  (A) Prospective mechanism of action for an enhanced immune response in MCC treated
  with an ATRi ± radiotherapy (RT). (B) Schematic for a potential clinical trial of
  an ATRi for patients with MCC refractory to ICIs wherein an ATRi would be added
  to a patient’s ongoing PD-1 pathway blockade. Palliative RT may be utilized to control
  progressive lesions and potentially synergize with the ATRi. Abbreviations: cGAMP:
  cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate, α-PD-(L)1: anti-PD-(L)1,
  PFS: progression-free survival, RECIST: response evaluation criteria in solid tumors,
  SD: stable disease.'
