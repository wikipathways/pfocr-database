caption: USPs and NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB signaling is activated via canonical
  or noncanonical pathway. A The canonical pathway is activated by stimulation of
  TLRs and TNFRs. TLRs recruits MyD88 to form a complex with IRAK1 and IRAK4. Then
  IRAK1 interacts with E3 ligase TRAF6. TRAF6 functions with E2 enzymes to promote
  K63-linked polyubiquitination of target proteins, including TRAF6 itself. Ubiquitinated
  TRAF6 subsequently recruits TAK1 and TABs, which then activates the IKK complex.
  IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory NF-κB subunit IκB, leading to IκB ubiquitination
  through the SCFβTrCP ligase-dependent proteasome degradation. As a result, NF-κB
  members NF-κB1 (also named p50), RelA (also named p65), and c-Rel are released and
  translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for DNA binding and regulation of
  downstream gene expression. While TNFRs recruit the E3 ligases c-IAP1 and c-IAP2
  to promote Lys63 polyubiquitylation of RIP1 and themselves to form a platform with
  TRAF2/5. This platform interacts with TAK1-TABs complex for further NF-κB activation.
  Thus, the TAK1-TABs complex is critical for TLRs and TNFRs mediated NF-κB canonical
  signaling activation. B The noncanonical pathways is mainly dependent on the activation
  of NF-κB2 (p100)/ RelB complex, which specifically responds to TNFRs receptors such
  as BAFF and CD40 and recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF3. The receptor complex interacts
  with TBK1 and phosphorylates NIK. Ikkα is activated by NIK to phosphorylates p100.
  Then, p100 is processed to its active form, p52 and translates to the nucleus with
  RelB for target genes expression. Different USPs mediate deubiquitylations in the
  process of NF-κB canonical and noncanonical pathways. NF-κB, Nuclear factor-κB;
