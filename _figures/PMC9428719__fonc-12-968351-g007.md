caption: The metabolic pathways responsible for the acidification of the GBM microenvironment.
  GBM growth is dependent on glucose carbons for biomass synthesis through glycolysis
  and glutamine carbons for ATP synthesis through glutaminolysis. The glutamine nitrogen
  is necessary for protein and nucleic acid synthesis. The waste products of the glycolytic
  and the glutaminolysis pathways (lactic acid, glutamic acid, and succinic acid)
  will acidify the GBM microenvironment. The oxygen consumption is linked to ROS production,
  not to ATP synthesis. Excessive ROS produce somatic mutations and further increase
  inflammation and acidification of the microenvironment (, , , ). A calorie restricted
  KD will reduce glucose availability for glycolysis while also interfering with the
  glutaminolysis pathway (). Glutamine-driven mSLP in the glutaminolysis pathway is
  a major source of ATP synthesis for GBM cells (, ). The glutaminolysis pathway (red)
  becomes dominant in tumor cells with inefficient OxPhos and that express the dimeric
  PKM2 isoform. PKM2 is expressed in GBM and produces less ATP through glycolysis
  than does the PKM1 isoform (, , , ). The elevation of ketone bodies (D-β-hydroxybutyrate
  and acetoacetate) through KD will indirectly reduce ATP synthesis through the succinate
  CoA ligase (SUCL) reaction by diverting CoA from succinate to acetoacetate. The
  IDH1 mutation could reduce ATP synthesis through mSLP by increasing synthesis of
  2-hydroxyglutarate that is derived from α-ketoglutarate and thus reduce the succinyl
  CoA substrate for the SUCL reaction (, , ). Besides its potential effect in reducing
  glutaminolysis, 2-hydroxyglutarate can also target multiple HIF1α-responsive genes
  and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway thus limiting synthesis of metabolites and
  one-carbon metabolism needed for rapid tumor growth (, , , ). The down regulation
  of Hif1-α-regulated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), through the action of both the
  KD and the IDH1 mutation, will reduce extracellular lactate levels thus further
  reducing microenvironment inflammation, acidification, and tumor cell invasion.
  Hence, the simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and glutaminolysis through the
  synergistic effects KMT and the IDH1 mutation will reduce the majority of signaling
  pathways necessary for rapid GBM growth and acidification of the microenvironment.
