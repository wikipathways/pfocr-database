caption: Neurotransmitter signaling leads to the generation of action potentials in
  the neuron. Membrane depolarization induces the opening of L-type voltage-sensitive
  calcium channels (L-VSCCs). Stimulus-dependent calcium entry via L-VSCCs preferentially
  leads to the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinases, and calcineurin-dependent signaling. Note that calcium influx can also
  occur via activation of NMDA receptors. Decades of work from numerous laboratories
  have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of these calcium-dependent signaling cascades,
  which have been simplified in this schematic. Cell type-specific differences in
  signaling mechanisms that are not illustrated here have also been described (e.g.,
  see ). These pathways lead to activation of preexisting transcription factors CREB,
  SRF/ELK, and MEF2, which regulate the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs)
  such as Fos. Many IEGs encode transcription factors that regulate a subsequent wave
  of late-response genes, which have now been shown to be cell type-specific.
