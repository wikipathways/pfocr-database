caption: Schematic of the molecular action proposed in this study. Schematic of the
  molecular action proposed in this study. Schematic depicting that the decreased
  sirt6 expression caused by Ang II promotes mitochondrial fission and podocyte injury
  through ROCK1‐Drp1 signalling. Reduced SIRT6 levels lead to increased levels of
  ROCK1, thereby enhancing Drp1 phosphorylation at the Ser637 site. Drp1 phosphorylation
  ultimately results in podocyte injury by inducing mitochondrial fission and apoptosis
