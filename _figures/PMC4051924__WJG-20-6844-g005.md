caption: 'Top-ranked signaling networks related to Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter 1 downregulation
  according to ingenuity pathway analysis. A: This network is called “Cellular Assembly
  and Organization; DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair; Cell Cycle”; B: This
  network is called “Cellular Assembly and Organization, Cell Cycle, DNA Replication,
  Recombination, and Repair”; C: This network is called “Cell Cycle; DNA Replication,
  Recombination, and Repair; Cancer”. Red and green indicate genes with expression
  levels that were higher or lower, respectively, than reference RNA levels. Genes
  analyzed for verification in Figure  were highlighted by red circles.'
