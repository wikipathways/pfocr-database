caption: Immune mechanisms implicated in the defense against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza.
  (A) Innate humoral factors present in the lumen of the lower airways block viruses
  before they attach the underlying epithelium. Mucins and surfactant proteins A and
  D are important for host defenses against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Mannose-binding
  lectin has also shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. (B) The innate immune response against
  these viruses begins with recognizing PAMPs by host PRRs. TLR3, TLR7, RIG-1, and
  the NLRP3 inflammasome participate in the early recognition of influenza and SARS-CoV-2,
  eliciting the production of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons. TLR2 and TLR4
  may also participate in the defense against SARS-CoV-2, but the evidence is still
  scarce. (C) The innate phase of the immune response against influenza and SARS-CoV-2
  comprehends an ample range of mechanisms, including the chemotaxis of monocytes,
  neutrophils, other granulocytes, and neutrophil degranulation and NETosis, phagocytosis
  of viral particles and infected cells, and cytotoxicity by NK cells. Some populations
  of NK cells with adaptive properties (NKG2C+) might also expand during COVID-19.
  (D) Dendritic cells link innate and adaptive immunity by presenting antigens at
  local lymph nodes and secreting cytokines that shape the functional fate of B and
  T cells. B cells produce neutralizing antibodies that mediate complement activation
  and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CD8+ T cells kill infected cells by
  perforin and granzyme degranulation or via the Fas/FasL signaling pathway. CD4+
  T cells produce cytokines to orchestrate all the other mechanisms described. A balance
  between Th1 and Th2 responses might be crucial for antiviral immunity. The art pieces
