caption: cIAP1/2 regulation of TNFα-induced canonical NF-κB pathway activation and
  suppression of default death pathways. (A) The E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2
  are required for TNFα activation of canonical NF-κB signaling, and to suppress TNFα-induced
  caspase-8 death pathway. These two cIAPs are recruited to the TNFα receptor, TNF-R1,
  via their association with the adaptor protein TRAF2. Upon ligand stimulation, the
  cIAPs promote K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1, which creates a signaling scaffold
  (or signalosome complex) to recruit the TAK1 kinase, LUBAC, otherwise known as the
  linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (consisting of Sharpin, HOIL-1L, and HOIP),
  and the trimeric IKK kinase complex (consisting of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NEMO). This
  signalosome formation results in the activation of the IKK complex, and subsequent
  phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκB, which occurs within
  minutes. This allows canonical NF-κB heterodimers to form and translocate into the
  nucleus to alter gene expression profiles over several hours, which affects many
  pathways such as survival, proliferation, inflammation, muscle atrophy, and NF-κB
  signaling itself. This pathway is subject to negative regulation by the deubiquitinase,
  A20, for example. (B) In the absence of the cIAPs, the unmodified RIP1 can form
  a death complex with FADD and caspase-8 known as the ripoptosome. This apoptotic
  death pathway can also default to a necrotic-like pathway in the absence of caspase-8,
  through another complex called the necrosome which involves the kinases RIP1 and
  RIP3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and the short and long forms of the
  phosphatase PGAM5.
