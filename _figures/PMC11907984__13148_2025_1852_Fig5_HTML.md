caption: Details of CBX members regulate TGF-β, Notch, HFI-1, P53/P21, E2F1/BIRC5, Rho
  GTPase, PRDM1/c-FOS signalling pathways in tumours and mechanism. (A) CBX3 could
  exert the transcriptional inhibition of HP1 family proteins, downregulating the
  expression of downstream target genes, promoting the activation of TGF-β signalling
  pathway in PC cells, and play the role of carcinogenic factor. CBX7 could play a
  role as a cancer suppressor in CCA cells by regulating the activation of TGF-β/PI3K/AKT
  signalling pathway, but the important role of CBX7 transcriptional regulation mechanism
  is still unclear. CBX4 could inhibit the expression of downstream target genes through
  classical PRC1-dependent pathway transcription, promote the activation of Notch
  signalling pathway in BC cells, and play a role as a carcinogenic factor. However,
  CBX8 inhibits the expression of downstream target genes through non-classical PRC1-independent
  pathway transcription, promotes the activation of Notch signalling pathway in BC
  cells, and plays a role as a carcinogenic factor. (B) CBX4, independent of the classical
  PRC1-dependent pathway, exerts SUMO E3 ligase activity to enhance the transcriptional
  activity of downstream target genes, overactivates HIF-1α signalling pathway in
  HCC cells, and acts as a carcinogenic factor. However, whether CBX4 promotes the
  activation of HIF-1α signalling pathway in OS cells through the same pathway remains
  to be further explored. CBX3 could play a role as a carcinogenic factor by exerting
  transcriptional inhibition mediated by HP1 family proteins, silencing the expression
  of downstream target genes, inhibiting the activation of P53/P21 signalling pathway
  in TSCC and CRC. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of CBX3 and
  CBX8 in regulating P53/P21 signalling pathway activation in ESCC, UBC, and HCC remain
  unclear. CBX7 could interact with HDAC2 independently of the classical PRC1-dependent
  pathway in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and brain glioma cells, regulate histone
  acetylation in the promoter region of downstream target genes, transcriptively activate
  or silence the expression of downstream target genes, and reduce migration, invasion
  and activation of cell cycle-related signalling pathways, acting as a cancer suppressor.
  The low expression of CBX5 in EGFR-mutated LUAD cells could inhibit the expression
  of E2F1, weaken the transcriptional activation of E2F1, downregulate the expression
  of anti-apoptotic gene BIRC5, inhibit the activation of anti-apoptotic signalling
  pathway of E2F1/BIRC5, induce apoptosis, and enhance the sensitivity of patients
  to EGFRi treatment. Exert tumour-suppressive effect. At the same time, the combination
  of epigenetic regulatory factor-related small-molecule inhibitors BETi and EGFRi
  could restore the expression of CBX5 and re-improve the sensitivity of LUAD resistant
  patients with EGFR mutation to EGFRi treatment. (C) CBX3 could downregulate the
  expression of downstream target genes through the transcriptional inhibition mediated
  by HP1, promote the activation of Rho GTPase signalling pathway in LUAD cells, and
  play a role in tumour promotion. CBX8 could also transcriptionally inhibit the transcriptional
  activity of downstream target genes, promote the activation of Rho GTPase signalling
  pathway in GBM, BC and lung cancer, and play a tumour-promoting role. However, more
  evidence is needed to confirm whether CBX8 exerts transcriptional inhibition through
  the classical PRC1-dependent pathway. CBX8 could act as a methylation reader in
  UBC, identify H3K27me3 catalysed by PRC2 in the downstream target gene PRDM1 promoter
  region, recruit non-classical PRC1-BCOR complex to bind to PRDM1 promoter and promote
  H2AK119ub1. Then, the expression of PRDM1 is inhibited by non-classical PRCI-independent
  transcriptional pathway, so as to upregulate the expression of c-FOS, promote the
  activation of PRDM1/c-FOS signalling pathway, induce EMT, and promote the malignant
  proliferation and metastasis of UBC cells
