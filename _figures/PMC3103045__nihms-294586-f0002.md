caption: Pharmacological targets in the nitric oxide (NO)-soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) signaling pathway in pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is associated
  with reduced levels of endogenous NO, as a result of decreased bioavailability of
  L-arginine due to increased activity of arginase, downregulation or uncoupling of
  the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inactivation of NO by superoxide anion, or increased
  plasma concentrations of the endogenous eNOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA). Although the total sGC expression is increased (due to a marked increase
  in the expression of the heme-free form of sGC), alteration of the redox state of
  sGC through oxidative stress may lead to reduced levels of the NO-sensitive form
  of sGC. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitors increase intracellular levels of cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by reducing its hydrolysis, and therefore depend
  on sufficient upstream NO-cGMP signaling. By contrast, sGC stimulators increase
  cGMP production rather than preventing its degradation, and their downstream effects
  are not limited by low NO levels. PKG, protein kinase G.
