caption: Model of Pvf/Pvr regulation of ISC homeostasis. ISC intrinsic Pvr signals
  are engaged by autocrine Pvf2/3 expression to maintain homeostatic proliferation
  and differentiation in the Drosophila posterior midgut. Extrinsic stress signals
  overwhelm Pvr controls of ISC homeostasis and independently promote compensatory
  proliferation and differentiation in response to enteropathogenic infection. Pvr
  signals are required for the steady state turnover and fate determination of ISCs
  under unstressed conditions.
