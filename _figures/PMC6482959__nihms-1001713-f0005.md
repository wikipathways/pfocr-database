caption: Ingenuity “Coagulation System” and “Acute Phase Response Signaling” canonical
  pathway effects identified from novel right ventricular biomarkers as inputs. (A)
  Ingenuity “Coagulation System” canonical pathway. Given the observed down-regulation
  of SERPINA5 and F8, Ingenuity predicts activation of the F3/F5a/F7a/F10a complex,
  F2a, Protein C, Fibrin, F13a, and Fibrin cross-link polymer (brown). (B) Ingenuity
  “Acute Phase Response Signaling” canonical pathway. Given the observed down-regulation
  of SERPINA5 and F8, Ingenuity predicts widespread inhibition of a variety of acute
  phase signaling effectors, including STAT3, NF-κB, c-JUN, NF-IL6, glucocorticoid
  receptors, and corticosteroid receptors (blue). (Color version of the figure is
  available online.)
