caption: Dysregulation of mTOR signaling pathway and mTOR in sleep phenotype of del
  2q23.1 and SMS. (a) Significantly altered mTOR signaling pathway due to knockdown
  of MBD5 or RAI1. Illustration of a key pathway being altered by altered expression
  due to knockdown of MBD5 or RAI1 in SH-SY5Y cells (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis).
  The top altered pathway, mTOR signaling (P=0.00329), has a role in proper sleep.
  Genes highlighted in green were downregulated in MBD5 or RAI1 in knockdown SH-SY5Y
  cells, and genes in red were upregulated in MBD5 or RAI1 in knockdown SH-SY5Y cells.
  The darker the color, the higher the fold change in gene expression. Values under
  each gene represent the fold change. (b) Significantly increased mRNA expression
  of mTOR in del 2q23.1 and SMS LCLs. Quantitative real-time PCR of mRNA from LCLs
  from patients with SMS and del 2q23.1 was performed. Data shown are calculated relative
  to mRNA expression levels from control subjects to assess the expression of mTOR
  across each syndrome. Data are an average of three independent experiments performed
  in triplicate. All expression values are calculated relative to control levels set
  at 1.0. Asterisks indicate significant differences between samples from patients
  versus control subjects (***P<0.005, and **P<0.05). P-values were determined by
  unpaired t-test. Error bars represent the SD from the mean.
