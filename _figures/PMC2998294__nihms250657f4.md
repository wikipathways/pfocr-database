caption: Yeast pheromone response pathway as a heterologous expression system. The
  pheromone receptor Ste2 activates the Gα subunit Gpa1 in yeast and promotes the
  release of the Gβ Ste4 and Gγ Ste18 subunits from the heterotrimeric G protein complex,
  which in turn activates the PAK kinase Ste20 and downstream MAPK cascade, Ste11,
  Ste7, and Fus3. The activation of transcription factor Ste12 promotes mating. To
  use this signaling pathway as a heterologous expression system, the RGS protein
  Sst2 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1 are deleted to optimize signal
  output. The promoter of the pheromone inducible gene FUS1 is fused to a reporter
  gene, commonly HIS3 or lacZ, to quantitatively measure the pheromone response signal.
  Also the pheromone receptors Ste2 and Ste3 are deleted to eliminate signal interference
  by endogenous receptors.
