caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanisms through which VNN1 in PC cells
  induces β-cell dedifferentiation by inhibiting the AMPK/GAPDH/Sirt1/FoxO1 signaling
  pathway. (A) PC cell membrane acquires VNN1 by endocytosis and forms a small vesicle.
  (B) The multivesicular body fuses with the PC cell membrane and releases VNN1-containing
  Exos. (C) VNN1 is transferred into β-cells by PC-Exos and inhibits the phosphorylation
  of AMPK. (D) The phosphorylation of cytoplasmic GAPDH is inhibited by inactivated
  AMPK. (E) GAPDH is prevented from redistributing into the nucleus and interacting
  with Sirt1; hence, Sirt1 activity is inhibited. (F) Sirt1 is prevented from binding
  with FoxO1. (G) FoxO1 cannot be deacetylated. (H) β-cell dedifferentiation is initiated
  thereof. PC, pancreatic cancer; VNN1, Vanin-1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase;
  FoxO1, Forkhead box protein O1; Sirt1, sirtuin 1.
