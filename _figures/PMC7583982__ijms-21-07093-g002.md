caption: Functions of miRNAs in EOC metastasis. miRNAs which are upregulated and promote
  metastasis-related processes are depicted in green boxes while downregulated miRNAs
  which inhibit metastatic-related processes are listed in red boxes. miRNAs directly
  and indirectly regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting
  E-cadherin and E-cadherin repressors, such as ZEB, Snail, Slug, and Twist, and associated
  signaling pathways. miR-9 directly targets E-cadherin to activate EMT while miR-25,
  miR-101-3p, miR-130b, miR-145, miR-150, and miR-1236-3b directly inhibit expression
  of E-cadherin repressors, including ZEB1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. Multiple miRNAs, such
  as miR-18b, miR-19b, miR-205, miR-216b, and miR-552, promote EMT by targeting PTEN,
  leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, upregulation of
  miR-590-3p, miR-130a, miR-181a, and miR-520h induces Wnt, mTOR, and TGF-β signaling,
  respectively, which are known pathways that promote EMT. In contrast, miR-936, miR-375-5p,
  miR-509-3p, miR-340, miR-377, miR-219-5p, miR-25, and miR-203 attenuate PI3K/AKT,
  Hippo, Wnt, and TGF-β signaling pathways and inhibit cell migration, invasion, and
  EMT. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-139-5p, miR-148a-3p, and miR-138, which
  has been reported to inhibit ROCKs and LIMK1 expression, increases cell motility
  via GTPase signaling. Metastatic EOC cells float in ascites as single cells or spheroids
  which exhibit stem cell-like properties. To survive after detaching from primary
  site and inside ascites, metastatic EOC cells upregulate miR-141 and downregulate
  miR-489 to modulate anoikis resistance. In the transcoelomic pathway, EOC metastatic
  cells then adhere to the mesothelium lining and invade peritoneal organs. Upregulation
  of miR-616 and downregulation of miR-17 and miR-6126 increase cell adhesion via
  increased expression and activities of integrins and MMPs which recognize and degrade
  the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the mesothelial cells, respectively. In addition,
  downregulation of miR-708 increases focal adhesion formation through promoting focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK) activities. EOC metastasis occurs in an immune-suppressive
  environment which are modulated by miRNAs. miR-21-5p and miR-29a-3p promote adaptive
  immune suppression via upregulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induction
  Treg/Th17 imbalance while miR-20a downregulates MICA/B to avoid recognition by cytotoxic
  T-cells. Furthermore, EOC tumors increase vascularization and angiogenesis via downregulation
  of miR-200a, implicating them in distant metastasis through a perfusion pathway.

  description: Functions of miRNAs in EOC metastasis. miRNAs which are upregulated
