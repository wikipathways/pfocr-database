caption: Differentially expressed proteins of the glycolysis pathway in ovarian cancer.
  Schematic presentation of glycolytic pathway in ovarian cancer and highlight of
  key differentially regulated genes (GLUT1; overexpressed, PFK; underexpressed, PGI;
  overexpressed, LDHA; overexpressed). Boxplot derived from TGCA expression datasets
  with tumor (red) and control (gray). * Represents statistical significance of p
  < 0.05.
