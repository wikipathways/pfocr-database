caption: Proposed working model for TLS in response to UV irradiation in mammalian
  cells. UV irradiation induced DNA damage blocks replicative polymerase like Polδ.
  The ssDNA along with stalled replication fork recruits the Rad6-Rad18 complex to
  monoubiquitinate PCNA-K164, which in turn recruits both Polη and Rev1. A default
  pathway is for Polη to insert nucleotides opposite the lesion, and for Rev1 to recruit
  Rev7-Rev3 (Polζ2) to the damage site to form Polζ4 for extension, in which the Polη-Rev1
  interaction plays a crucial role. In the absence of Polη, Rev1 can play dual roles
  in both insertion and Polζ2 recruitment, in which its catalytic activity is required.
