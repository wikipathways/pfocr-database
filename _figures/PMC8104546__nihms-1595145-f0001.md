caption: (A) The DNA damage response is activated by DNA damage sensors that include
  the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex and the Ku heterodimer, which detect DNA double-strand
  breaks. The replication protein A (RPA) heterotrimer engages exposed regions of
  single stranded DNA. These sensors recruit the transducing kinases ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) (through the MRN complex), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
  subunit (DNA-PKcs) (through the Ku heterodimer), and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
  protein (ATR) (through RPA), which in turn phosphorylate a broad spectrum of mediators
  and effectors. Ultimately the DNA damage response promotes survival at the cellular
  level and homeostasis and tumor suppression at the organismal level.(B) Depicted
  are DNA lesions that can promote cancer development. Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects
  mismatched base pairs (lesion 1). Base excision repair  (BER) removes chemically
  damaged bases (lesion 2), repairs abasic sites (a location in DNA that has neither
  a purine nor a pyrimidine base due to DNA damage) (lesion 3) and repairs DNA nicks
  (where there is no phosphodiester bond between adjacent nucleotides of one strand)
  (lesion 7). Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is required for the removal of cyclobutane
  pyrimidine dimers (lesion 4) and 6–4 photoproducts (not shown) arising from exposure
  to ultraviolet (UV) light. NER and BER, along with alkyl transferases are responsible
  for removal of damaged bases and bulky adducts (lesion 5). The Fanconi anemia (FA)
  pathway removes intra-strand cross links (lesion 6). DNA double strand breaks can
  cause pathogenic DNA rearrangements, and are repaired by non-homologous end joining  (NHEJ)
  and homologous recombination (HR) pathways (lesion 8). The reader is directed to
  a comprehensive review.
