caption: 'Cluster Network of enriched pathways of shared DEGs (differentially expressed
  genes) between Systemic Sclerosis and cancer. The most significant pathways that
  were associated with the selected pathologies and their network percentile coverage
  included. A) Pathways between SSc and LC are: Peptide ligand-binding receptors (0.74%),
  Class A1 (Rhodopsin-like receptors) (0.29%), GPCR ligand binding (0.29%), GPCR downstream
  signaling (0.13%), Collagen biosynthesis and modifying (10.15%), Assembly of collagen
  fibrils (7.14%), Metabolism of polyamines (5.34%), Amine Oxidase reactions (0.46%),
  and Spermine and spermidine degradation (0.38%). B) Pathways between SSc and Lk
  are: ATPase AAA core (1.1%), PID SYNDECAN 1 PATHWAY (0.54%), ACATATC, MIR-190 (0.19%)
  and TATCTGG, MIR-488 (0.15%), Metabolism of polyamines (2.27%). C) Pathways between
  SSc and Lp are: spermine and spermidine degradation (0.38%), Interconversion of
  polyamines (0.06%), Amine Oxidase reactions (0.0028%), Spermine (0.13%) and V$AR
  03 (0.063%).'
