caption: (A) Upon activation by signaling through the T-cell receptor and co-stimulatory
  molecules, naïve CD4+ Th precursor (Thp) cells can differentiate into three lineages
  of effector T helper (Th) cells, Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells depending on the local cytokine
  milieu. Each subset produces different cytokines that mediate distinct effector
  mechanisms. IL-12 is an important cytokine for the development of Th1 cells, which
  produce IFN-γ, through which they promote CMI and protection against intracellular
  pathogens. IL-4 promotes the expansion of Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5 and
  IL-13 and are important in allergy and protection against helminthes. On the other
  hand, Th17 cells develop in the presence of IL-1, IL-6 and TGF-β, while IL-23 is
  important for the expansion, maintenance and function of Th17 cells. Th17 cells
  are implicated in autoimmunity and protect against extracellular microbes, including
  C. albicans, a role that was erroneously ascribed to Th1 cells in many instances.
  The transcription factor STAT3 is very important at many steps exclusively along
  the Th17-development pathway. (B) C. albicans is recognized, taken up by antigen
  presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), processed
  and presented to T cells. A balanced response to Candida includes the cooperation
  of many PRRs. Upon recognition of C. albicans yeast and hyphae, CLRs (dectin-1,
  dectin-2, and the MR) and the NLRP3 inflammasome are important in the generation
  of a protective Th17-response through the induction of IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β.
