caption: Pathway analysis predicts a reduction of TLR-2/4/9-dependent inflammatory
  responses by elafibranor in PHH and hSKP-HPC ‘NASH’ cultures, but not in HepaRG
  ‘NASH’ cultures. Prediction chart based on TLR signaling shows an activation of
  inflammatory responses in PHH, hSKP-HPC and HepaRG cell cultures exposed to NASH
  triggers (left panels). When PHH and hSKP-HPC ‘NASH’ cultures are further exposed
  to elafibranor, this inflammatory response is inhibited in PHH and hSKP-HPC cell
  cultures, but not in HepaRG cultures (right panels) [orange line = ‘leads to activation’;
  blue line = ‘leads to inhibition’; yellow line = ‘findings inconsistent with state
  of downstream molecule’; grey line = ‘effect not predicted’].
