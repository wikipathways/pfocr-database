caption: Osteoblasts produce EPO through a HIF dependent mechanism under physiologic
  and pathophysiologic conditions. Osteoblasts express HIF-1 and HIF-2 that transcriptionally
  activate EPO expression. In conditions of augmented HIF signaling (dashed line),
  osteoblasts produce both local and systemic levels of EPO that stimulate erythropoiesis
  in the bone marrow and spleen. Constitutive hyperactivation of HIF signaling leads
  to increased red blood cells (RBC) and oxygen in the blood that feeds back to suppress
  renal EPO production. Augmented HIF signaling in osteoblasts through VHL or PHD1/2/3
  inhibition is sufficient to drive EPO expression in adult bone, elevate hematocrit,
  and protect mice from stress-induced anemia. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition
  of PHDs using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI) is sufficient to activate EPO
  in adult bone. Additionally, augmented HIF activity in osteoblasts expands HSCs
  indicating that therapeutic manipulation of the PHD/VHL/HIF pathway in osteoblasts
  is a therapeutic strategy to elevate both EPO and HSCs in the local hematopoietic
  microenvironment.
