caption: In the absence of JA-Ile, JAZ repressors are stable and interact with MYC2,
  MYC3 and MYC4 as well as bHLH003, bHLH013 and bHLH017. JAZs are part of a repression
  complex that comprises NINJA and TOPLESS (not shown). Upon a stimulus, hormone is
  perceived by the COI1/JAZ co-receptor and JAZ proteins are targeted for degradation
  by the proteasome. Once released from JAZ, MYC2, MYC3 and MYC4 will activate transcription,
  whereas bHLH003, bHLH013 and bHLH017 will repress it. Both sets of proteins (MYCs
  and bHLHs) compete for the G-box and, therefore, the output response will depend
  on the balance of activity between these two sets of TFs. Moreover, bHLH017 expression
  is activated by MYC2, therefore increasing the effective repressor over time and
  further contributing to reduce transcriptional activation.
