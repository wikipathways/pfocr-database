caption: Non-oncogenic inflammation pathway and tumor-promoting inflammation. In the
  case of the acute phase of inflammation, inflammation is activated which occurs
  due to pro- and then anti-inflammatory modulators. If acute inflammation is not
  eliminated, pathologies with chronic inflammation develop. Chronic inflammatory
  or infectious conditions mediate the risk of cancer development and progression
  due to the activation by tumor-associated immune cells of transcription factors,
  mainly nuclear factor NF-κB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
  (STAT3), and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1) in cells. At the same time, transcription
  factors coordinate the production of growth factors and various enzymes, as well
  as inflammatory mediators, including chemokines and cytokines, which can in turn
  activate the same transcription factors in inflammatory, stromal, and tumor cells,
  contributing to the formation of cancer-related inflammatory microenvironment. Chronic
  inflammation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and a decrease in ATP synthesis,
  causing hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species that inhibit the activity of
  apoptosis regulators and CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. All of these events that occur
  in chronic inflammation contribute to cancer progression and participate in all
  of the major stages of tumor development, from nucleation to metastasis and the
  formation of drug resistance.

    In the case of the acute phase of inflammation, inflammation is activated which
    occurs due to pro- and then anti-inflammatory modulators. If acute inflammation
    is not eliminated, pathologies with chronic inflammation develop. Chronic inflammatory
