caption: Jnk, a stress activated protein kinase, is activated by diverse stimuli,
  including caspase activation, ligands for Jnk signaling pathways (Egr), cellular
  stresses (reactive oxygen species, infection, cytoskeletal changes), and loss of
  apical-basal polarity (; ). Jnk activates apoptosis, but also cell proliferation.
  Activation of proliferation is mediated through Hippo signaling. The ultimate target
  of Jnk signaling within the Hippo pathway is not known, it could act upstream of
  Wts and Hpo, but might act in parallel to them (dashed lines and question mark).
  Yki both promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through transcriptional
  regulation of downstream target genes.
