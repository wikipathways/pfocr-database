caption: 'The most prominently affected gene network in response to DEX in TM 86 cells.
  Network was classified as: RNA-Post-Transcriptional Modification, Antigen Presentation,
  Immune cell Trafficking. Regulation of this network in TM 86 cells is compared across
  treatment with DEX, FA or TA. Pathway contains RNA binding protein S1 (RNPS1), which
  occupies a central position in this network. Red: induction; green: repression;
  white: unaffected; color intensity correlates with fold change; number: fold change.
  The diagram was obtained from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems).'
