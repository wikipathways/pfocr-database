caption: Regulation of the SGOCP. (A and B) Schematic showing the SGOCP regulation
  in nutrient-poor (A) and nutrient-rich (B) conditions. (A) Nutrient or ER stress
  activates the prosurvival functions of ATF4 by increasing nutrient uptake and promoting
  the machinery of intracellular amino acid biosynthesis to maintain mTORC1 activity.
  p53 is also activated to promote glutathione synthesis which, together with ATF4,
  increases cell survival. (B) In nutrient-rich conditions, the hyperactivation of
  mTORC1 and/or NRF2 activation leads to an increase in the SGOCP activity through
  ATF4. SREBP1 and estrogen-dependent ERα activation also up-regulate the SGOCP. mTORC1
  is activated via the sensing of SAM levels. The anabolic activation of ATF4 leads
  to an increase in cell growth and proliferation and to transdifferentiation and
  stemness.
