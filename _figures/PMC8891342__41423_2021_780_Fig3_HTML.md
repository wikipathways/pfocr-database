caption: Overview of intracellular innate immune receptors in T cell metabolic reprogramming.
  A HIV-1 infection increases the expression of NLRX1, which directly associates with
  FASTKD5 to promote OXPHOS and viral replication. B NLRC3 in T cells acts as an intrinsic
  attenuator that regulates T cell signaling pathways and metabolic progress to restrict
  autoimmune and virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses. C AIM2 facilitates the interaction
  between RACK1 and PP2A phosphatase, causing the dephosphorylation of AKT to restrain
  the activity of the mTOR pathway, thereby promoting Foxp3 expression and Treg cell
  stability
