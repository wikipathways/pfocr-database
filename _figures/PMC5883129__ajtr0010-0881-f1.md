caption: Ubiquitin cascade produces diverse ubiquitin chains that can affect different
  varieties of cellular processes. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) transfers ubiquitin
  to ubiquitin-conjugated enzyme (E2) with an ATP participation. Ubiquitin ligase
  (E3) then transfers the ubiquitin molecule to the substrate. Repeating this sequence
  of ubiquitin transfer results in a variety of length of the ubiquitin chain, K48
  and K63-linked polyubiquitin chain bring into their biological function. K63- and
  K48-mediated polyubiquitination play an important role in a large number of biological
  and pathological functions by NF-κB signaling pathway.
