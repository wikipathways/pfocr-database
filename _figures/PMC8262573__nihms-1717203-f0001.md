caption: '(A) The image depicts PD-L1 on tumor cells engaging the T cell PD-1 receptor.
  PD-L1 upregulation in multiple tumor types occurs through a variety of mechanisms
  to promote immune evasion. These include transcriptional activation through interferon
  gamma (IFNγ)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling
  and translational control (depicted later). (B–D) Three examples of translational
  control of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint are illustrated. (B) Eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4F (eIF4F) complex activity promotes STAT1 translation, which in turn increases
  PD-L1 transcription in response to IFNγ stimulation in melanoma cells []. (C) Integrated
  stress response (ISR) pathway activation through heme synthesis inhibition or hypoxia
  facilitates eIF5B-mediated translation of PD-L1 in lung cancer []. An open question
  is whether eIF2α phosphorylation promotes eIF5B recruitment to PD-L1 and other mRNAs
  with upstream open reading frames (uORFs). (D) Oncogenic MYC enhances PD-L1 translation
  in liver cancer []. In (C) and (D), eIF2α phosphorylation and weakened ternary complex
  (TC) activity is hypothesized to promote leaky scanning through the 5′ untranslated
  region, bypassing inhibitory uORFs and increasing translation at the PD-L1 canonical
  translation start site. Unanswered questions include how MYC overexpression results
  in eIF2α phosphorylation and whether an alternative initiation factor plays a critical
  role in this context. Abbreviation: TCR, T cell receptor.'
