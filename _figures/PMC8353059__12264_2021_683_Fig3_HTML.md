caption: 'PD-1 signaling and expression in microglia and neurons. A Mechanisms of
  PD-1 signaling in microglia. PD-1 inhibits microglial function by recruiting phosphatases
  SHP-1/SHP-2 to the ITIM/ITSM domain in the PD-1 tail and then inhibiting the RAS-ERK
  and PI3K-NF-κB signaling pathways. Moreover, PD-1 signaling suppresses IFN-γ-activated
  M1 microglia polarization by reducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the secretion
  of IL-12, while promoting IL-4-activated M2 microglia polarization by increasing
  STAT6 phosphorylation. B Mechanisms of PD-1 signaling in neurons. Activation of
  the PD-1 pathway dampens neuronal excitation via activation of the phosphatase SHP-1/2
  and resulting in the downstream modulation of sodium and potassium channels (TREK2
  and Kv4.2), as well as GABAA receptors. Moreover, PD-1 signaling regulates mu-opioid
  receptor (MOR) function through activation of the phosphatase SHP-1. Red lines ending
  in a bar represent inhibitory signaling, and black arrows indicate positive signaling.
