caption: The canonical RAS/MAPK pathway is tightly regulated by many proteins, attenuators
  and negative feedback mechanisms. Mutations in regulators like accessory proteins
  can lead to a dysregulated RAS/MAPK pathway and therefore to a variety of diseases
  as cancer and RASopathies (a). The genomic amplification of Paxillin is found in
  many NSCLC patients and activates the focal adhesion complex downstream of integrins
  (1). Loss-of-function mutations of SPRED1 activate the RAS-MAPK pathway and lead
  to Legius syndrome (germline) and hepatocellular carcinoma (somatic) (2). IQGAP1
  mutations are often associated with tumour formation and metastasis (3), whereas
  KSR is a central player in KRAS-driven cancers, inducing proliferation and survival
  (4). Mild gain-of-function mutations of SHOC2 lead to Noonan-like syndrome with
  loose anagen hair or Mazzanti syndrome, other somatic mutations can lead to hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy or tumourigenesis (5). The signalling of BCR-ABL-positive cells in
  chronic myeloid leukaemia is also dependent on GAB2 activation, cross-linking AKT
  and RAS pathway (6). The adaptor protein SHP2 is not only part of hyperactive RAS
  signalling in cancer cells, but is of major importance in the inactivation of T
  cells, inhibiting the TCR signal in response to ligand binding to PD-1 (b). FHL1
  is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which is caused by a gain-of-function
  mutation, leading to increased ERK signalling (c).
