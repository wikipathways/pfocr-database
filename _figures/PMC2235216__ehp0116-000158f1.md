caption: 'Mechanisms of arsenic-induced acquired androgen independence. Abbreviations:
  AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen responsive element; As, arsenic; GF, growth
  factors; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK
  kinase kinase; PSA, prostate-specific antigen. It is known that exposure to arsenic
  initiates GF receptor signaling and Ras-dependent activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2.
  (A) As prostate cancer progresses to androgen independence, the growth factors production
  increases. Growth factor signal transduction pathways have been shown to stimulate
  AR activation. All these growth factors use the Ras/MAPK pathway for a portion of
  their signal transduction. Binding of GF results in dimerization, autophosphorylation
  of the receptor, and tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins. The GF receptor
  activates ras which in turn activates Raf, which phosphorylates and activates MEK,
  which in turn, phophorylates and activates ERK. Activated MAPK can regulate targets
  in the cytosol and also translocate to the nucleus causing phosphorylation of transcription
  factors such as c-Fos to create AP-1 and ELK-1, which contribute to proliferation.
  (B) HER-2/neu promotes phosphorylation of AR at multiple sites even in the presence
  of very low androgen levels. HER-2/neu indirectly activates MAPK. MAPK might phosphorylate
  the AR, creating an androgen-independent receptor.'
