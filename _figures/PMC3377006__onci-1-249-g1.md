caption: Figure 1. Tumor-associated macrophages contribute to the cancer immune suppression
  and cancer inflammation in RCC via enhanced 15-LOX2/15-S-HETE pathway. Enhanced
  15-LOX2 activity and elevated levels of eicosanoids of RCC tumor-microenvironment
  enable increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokine CCL2. Elevated levels
  of CCL2 in tumor lead to migration of CCR2-expressing monocytes from peripheral
  blood to the tumor. In tumor tissue recruited monocytes differentiate in 15-LOX-expressing
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). High 15-LOX2 expression/activity in TAMs results
  in elevated secretion of arachidonate metabolites and increased production of IL-10
  and CCL2 by TAMs and T cells. In addition, TAMs efficiently convert T cells into
  FOXP3+ T regs. Together, elevated levels of IL-10 and T regs promote local immunosuppression
  and T cell tolerance in RCC tumor microenvironment.
