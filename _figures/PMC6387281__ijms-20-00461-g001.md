caption: 'Schematic overview of the autophagy process and genetic and drug targets
  to inhibit specific aspects of autophagy. Macroautophagy involves four main steps:
  induction, nucleation, elongation, and fusion/completion. Upon inhibition of mTORC1
  by PI3K/AKT, the autophagy process is initiated, for example, when cells undergo
  starvation. The autophagy process then begins with the formation of a double-membrane
  structure, the phagophore, which elongates and matures into an autophagosome, sequestering
  the cytoplasmic cargo. The autophagosome fuses with lysosomes, generating autolysosomes,
  and the engulfed content is degraded through proteases, and macromolecules are released
  into the cytosol. Various, indicated ATG proteins and complexes facilitate certain
  steps in this catabolic pathway. In addition, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II,
  as well as the degradation of p62, together with the enclosed cargo, serve as markers
  of active autophagy in molecular and immunochemical assays. Chloroquine and other
  lysosomal compounds, as well as newly developed inhibitors and genetic targets to
  specifically block the autophagy pathway at certain points, are indicated. ROS =
  Reactive oxygen species; PI3K = Phosphoinositide3-kinase; AKT = Protein kinase B;
  mTORC1 = mammalian target of rapamycin complex I; ATG = Autophagy-related gene;
  ULK = Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase; FIP200 = FAK family-interacting protein
  of 200 kDa; PiP3 = Phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate; VPS34 = Class III
  PI3K vacuolar protein sorting 34. Solid black and green arrows indicate activation
  and direction of autophagy steps; red dotted lines show inhibition; dotted green
  arrow indicates recycling of LC3-II-PE by ATG4s.'
