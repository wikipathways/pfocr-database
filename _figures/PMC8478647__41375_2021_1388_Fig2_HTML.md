caption: Lysosomal membranes harbor a variety of proteins that regulate multiple signaling
  pathways. The transporter protein NPC1 releases free cholesterol from the lumen
  to maintain lipid homeostasis. The V-ATPase is a proton pump responsible for maintaining
  luminal pH. mTORC1 links metabolic functions to environmental signaling. The components
  of the mTORC1 signaling pathway can be regulated by both intra- and extra-luminal
  amino acid signaling. Arginine (R) in the lysosomal lumen is sensed by the amino
  acid transporter SLC38A9 which eventually activates mTORC1 with the help of the
  Rag GTPases and Ragulator complex. In the cytosol, Sestrin proteins serve as leucine
  (L) sensors and with the help of GATOR proteins, regulate mTORC1 activity. See text
  for further description. mTORC1 also negatively regulates lysosome biogenesis. Luminal
  Ca2 + initiates lysosome biogenesis. It is released into the cytoplasm through the
  lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1 to activate calcineurin, which dephosphorylates
  TFEB, enabling it to translocate into the nucleus where it facilitates transcription
  of the CLEAR network genes. This pathway is inhibited by the transcription repressor
  ZKSCAN3. LAMPs are transmembrane proteins that account for about 80% of all membrane
  proteins and take part in various functions including, autophagy, lipid transport,
  and immune response. SYT7 is another calcium-dependent membrane protein that takes
  part in lysosomal exocytosis. Created with BioRender.com.
