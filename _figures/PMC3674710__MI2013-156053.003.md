caption: Variations in the metabolites of the glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic
  acid cycle in HUVEC cell homogenates (n = 3, for each experiment). Endothelial cells
  were incubated over 24 h with 50 mg/L isolated human LDL (L); 50 mg/L oxidized LDL
  (O); 50 mg/L oxidized LDL + 40 mg/L HDL from wild type mice (OH); 50 mg/L oxidized
  LDL + 40 mg/L HDL from PON1(−/−) mice (KO); or with serum-free media as controls
  (C). *P < 0.05 with respect to L; †P < 0.05 with respect to O; ‡P < 0.05 with respect
  to OH.
