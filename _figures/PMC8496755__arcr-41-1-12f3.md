caption: Cannabinoid signaling in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease.
  Alcohol is mainly metabolized in hepatocytes (HEP) of the liver during which reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) is generated as a cellular stress response. The generated ROS
  stimulates and activates a cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) for the influx of
  cystine in exchange for the efflux of glutamate. The excreted glutamate then binds
  to a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) expressed in the neighboring hepatic
  stellate cells (HSC), inducing the production of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)
  by diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG produced in the HSC binds to cannabinoid-1
  receptors (CB1R) expressed in the plasma membrane of neighboring HEP to induce de
  novo lipogenesis via the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). This forms a bidirectional paracrine
  loop pathway through which HEP and HSC in close proximity can metabolically regulate
  each other. Activation of CB1R can also induce β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria,
  generating mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), which ultimately contributes to the accumulation
  of fat, or steatosis. Activated CB1R perturbs the excretion of triglyceride (TG)
  in the form of TG-rich very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), further contributing
  to hepatic steatosis. CB1R activation is also known to induce apoptosis of cells.
  Kupffer cells (KC) normally become activated via the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation and acquire a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype. However,
  when the CB2R expressed in Kupffer cells are stimulated by ethanol, they obtain
  an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. Activated Kupffer cells then produce arachidonoyl
  ethanolamide (AEA), which also binds and activates CB1R in the neighboring HEP.
