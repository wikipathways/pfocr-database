caption: 'The central triangle represents the key cell types of the atheroma: endothelium,
  smooth muscle, and macrophage foam cells representative of the leukocytes found
  in plaques. These cells found within the atherosclerotic plaque can produce cytokines,
  notably interleukin-1 (IL-1), that can contribute to a positive feedback loop as
  IL-1 can induce its own gene expression in the source cell, an autocrine pathway,
  or activate neighboring cells through juxtacrine or paracrine pathways. Systemic
  mediators or these locally produced cytokines can elicit further mediator release
  from cells in the atheroma producing local echoes of systemic inflammation. The
  surrounding semicircle of cells represents the lymphocytes that interact with cells
  within the atheroma and some key mediators by which they can modulate the local
  inflammatory and immune response within the plaque. Regulatory T cells (Treg) elaborate
  transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), a mediator that exerts anti-inflammatory
  and pro-fibrotic actions on many cell types. The Th2 lymphocytes can mute inflammatory
  responses and promote resolution or healing responses through the elaboration of
  interleukin-10 and interleukin-4. Th1 lymphocytes can release interferon gamma (IFN-g)
  that can potently produce pro-atherogenic functions of the three major cell types
  depicted in the arterial plaque. The induction of class II major histocompatibility
  molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in the plaque such as the macrophage
  can in turn enhance their ability to stimulate the afferent limb of the adaptive
  immune response. Th17 cells elaborate IL-17, which has mixed effects on atheromata,
  perhaps promoting inflammation but also augmenting fibrosis. B lymphocytes can also
  modulate atherosclerosis. B1 cells (not depicted here) can secrete natural IgM antibodies
  that appear atheroprotective. Many such natural antibodies recognize epitopes associated
  with modified lipoproteins. B2 cells can elaborate cytokines and IgG antibody that
  can stimulate atherogenesis, based on observations in mice. CD8 lymphocytes can
  kill virally infected cells including those in the atheroma releasing DAMPs that
  can augment inflammatory activation of many cells types through engagement of TLRs.
  Microorganisms themselves, as depicted by the bacillus in the diagram, can provide
  PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycans that activate cells in the atherosclerotic
  plaque through engagement of TLRs. This complex network involves interactions between
  innate immune pathways and both humoral and cellular adaptive immunity.'
