caption: The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway in a mammalian system. Hedgehog
  (HH) ligand proteins are processed in the cytosol by autoproteolytical cleavage
  to generate an N-terminal subunit, which is further modified by the addition of
  palmitoyl and cholesterol moieties. The lipidated Shh is stored in the lipid-rich
  microdomain on the cell surface but is released by cooperative action of Dispatched
  and Scube 2. In the absence of ligand binding, Patched (Ptch) restrains Smoothened
  (Smo) in the cytosol and keeps it as an inactive dimer. Glioma-associated oncogene
  (Gli) is located at the ciliary tip where it interacts with and is repressed by
  Suppressor of fused (SuFu). Upon HH binding, Ptch releases Smo and allows it to
  translocate into the cytoplasmic membrane of the ciliary tip where it cooperates
  with KIF3a and Arrb2 to disrupt the interaction of SuFu and Gli. Freed Gli is then
  translocated into the nucleus to activate the transcription of its target genes
  such as Snail, Shh, and Ptch.
