  to the same pathway are grouped in the same arrow. Genetic associations in Crohn's
  disease and ulcerative colitis are shown. Ig, immunoglobulin; TSLP, thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin; RA, retinoic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NSAIDs, non-steroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs; HSP, heat shock protein; PRR, pattern-recognition receptor;
  XBP1, X-box binding protein; NOD2, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein; ATG16L1, autophagy-related protein 16-1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MHC,
  major histocompatibility complex; DLG5, discs large homologue 5; ECM1, extracellular
  matrix protein 1; ITLN1, interlactin 1; SLC22A5, solute carrier family 22 member
  5; DMBT1, deleted in malignant brain tumors 1; PTGER4, prostaglandin E receptor
  4; TNF-a, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL, interleukin; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; STAT3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; CCR6, C-C-chemokine receptor type
  6; NOD2, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2; CARD9,
  caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9; IRF5, interferon regulatory factor
  5; IRGM, immunity-related guanine triphosphatase family M protein; LRRK2, leucine-rich
  repeat kinase 2; TNFAIP3, TNF-a-induced protein 3; PTPN2, protein tyrosine phosphatase,
  non-receptor type 2; NLRP3, NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3; IL18RAP,
  Interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein; ICOSL, inducible T-cell co-stimulator
  ligand; ARPC2, actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 ().
