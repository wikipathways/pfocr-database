caption: The dynamic structure of the pathway interaction network. The nodes in this
  network referred to pathways and edges between nodes indicated interaction of pathways
  determined through overlapped genes. In particular, nodes in red indicate stage1
  pathways; nodes in blue indicate stage2 pathways; nodes in dark blue indicate stage3
  pathways ;nodes in green indicate stage4 pathways, whereas nodes in 2 colors refer
  to the common pathways of 2 stages. The color of nodes represent the cancer stages
