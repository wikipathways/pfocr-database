caption: Models for processes involved in the synthesis and trans-cytoplasmic membrane
  export of bacterial glycans. In the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway, individual lipid-linked
  repeat units are synthesized by glycosyltransferase enzymes (illustrated in yellow
  in each model) located at the interface of the cytoplasm and the membrane. The lipid-linked
  repeat units are exported via the Wzx flippase (a putative transporter of unknown
  mechanism) and polymerized at the periplasmic face of the membrane. The polymer
  grows in a blockwise process, by addition of new repeat units to the reducing end
  of the glycan in a reaction requiring the Wzy polymerase. In the ABC transporter-dependent
  pathway, the chain is elongated by addition of monomers to the nonreducing terminus
  of a lipid-linked intermediate and is completed in the cytoplasm, prior to export
  via the ABC transporter. In the synthase-dependent system, a single protein is thought
  to serve as both a polymerase and an exporter, but the details of the export process
  are unknown. There is no unifying involvement of a lipid acceptor in the synthase
  pathway, and even the direction of chain growth may differ, depending on the system.
  Glycans (or glycoses) derived from these pathways can be attached to protein, lipid,
  LPS, or peptidoglycan acceptors. In the case of some glycoconjugates in Gram-negative
  bacteria, the final cellular location may depend on additional export pathways to
  transfer the molecule across the outer membrane.
