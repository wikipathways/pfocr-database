caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to investigate the networks potentially
  affected by the down-regulated genes. (A) Cell Death and Survival, Hematological
  System Development and Function, Hematopoiesis” is the highest scoring network with
  a significance score of 37 and 18 focus molecules (B) DNA Replication, Recombination
  and Repair, Cell Cycle, Cancer” has a significance score of 32 and 16 focus molecules.
  The target down-regulated genes are shaded in green. Intensity of shading correlates
  with the degree of down-regulation. A solid line represents a direct interaction
  between two genes, while a dotted line indicates an indirect interaction.
