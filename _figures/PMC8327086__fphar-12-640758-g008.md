caption: A functional model of berberine-protecting effects against ER stress induced
  production of senile plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD. In the APP/PS1
  AD model, ER stress was induced, and subsequently activated GSK3β cascade and the
  PERK/eIF2α/BACE1 signaling pathway. Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ42 deposition
  were attenuated by BBR, which is mainly attributed to its ability to suppress ER
  stress in the AD model.
