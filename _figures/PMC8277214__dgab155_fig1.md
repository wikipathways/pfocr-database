caption: 'Schematic of de novo ceramide synthesis. Palmitate and serine are the preferred
  substrates for de novo ceramide synthesis, which undergo a condensation reaction
  in the first of four pathway steps. Next, 3-keto-sphinganine is quickly converted
  to sphinganine, which is n-acylated by 6 CERS enzymes to produce dihydroceramide.
  Lastly, DES 1 and 2 introduce a double bond at the delta 4 position of the sphingoid
  backbone to form ceramide. Abbreviations: CERS, (dihydro) ceramide synthase; DES,
  dihydroceramide desaturase; KDSR, 3-keto-sphinganine reductase; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase.'
