caption: Mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs work by
  blocking inhibitory pathways that suppress immune responses. Ipilimumab targets
  CTLA-4, which is expressed on activated T cells in lymphoid organs. Nivolumab and
  Pembrolizumab target PD-1, which is found on T cells in peripheral tissues. Atezolizumab,
  Durvalumab, and Avelumab target PD-L1, which is expressed on both tumor cells and
  immune cells. Created in BioRender. Rubini, S. (2025) https://BioRender.com/0s4w3t6
