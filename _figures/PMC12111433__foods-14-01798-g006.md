caption: This illustration depicts the pathways and key genes involved in the synthesis
  of chlorophyll and SGAs during the photoinduced greening of potato tubers. (a) Chlorophyll
  synthesis pathway. (b) Molecular mechanism of light-induced chlorophyll and SGA
  biosynthesis. (c) SGA synthesis pathway.  Positive regulation.  Negative regulation.  Mechanisms
  are unclear and need further validation by experiments
