caption: Proposed mechanism for CRIF1 modulation of the PKC-δ / NRF2 signaling pathway
  to facilitate redox homeostasis in BMMSCs after irradiation. CRIF1 co-activates
  KC-δ to phosphorylate NRF2 at Ser40 and promotes the dissociation of NRF2 from KEAP1.
  More stable NRF2 translocates into nucleus to activate its downstream target genes
  through binding to antioxidant response element (ARE) motifs, resulting in alleviation
  of oxidative stress in BMMSCs induced by radiative injury.
