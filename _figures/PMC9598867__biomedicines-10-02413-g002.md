caption: Nrf2 signaling pathway activation by ROS and induction of target genes. Under
  physiological conditions, NRF2 bound to KEAP1 is ubiquitylated and degraded in the
  proteasome. In response to ROS and various other stress factors, KEAP1 is released
  from NRF2, leading to its stabilization and translocation into the nucleus. Target
  gene expression is induced upon binding of NRF2 to AREs (antioxidant response element)
  in the promoters of target genes. Target genes comprise genes coding for the cell’s
  antioxidative equipment, efflux pumps enabling drug resistance, stemness-regulating
  transcription factors, as well as SHH (modified from [,]).
