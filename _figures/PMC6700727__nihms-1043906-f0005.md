caption: In vivo induction of demyelination by direct M. leprae injection into sciatic
  nerves of adult Rag-1 knockout mice, suggesting that early demyelination can be
  caused by the activation of signaling pathways in the absence of immune responses.
  (A) Schematic showing the activation of Erk1/2 MAPK signaling pathways by extracellular
  (a) and intracellular (b) M. leprae via two different pathways and their role in
  proliferation and demyelination. M. leprae binds to the ErbB2 receptor to induce
  Schwann cell demyelination and proliferation. (a) The binding of M. leprae (ML)
  to ErbB2 on the surface of myelinated Schwann cells triggers demyelination through
  the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. ErbB2 inhibitors such as herceptin, PKI166, and U0126
  block activation of this pathway in response to M. leprae. (b) Intracellular M.
  leprae induces proliferation of nonmyelinated Schwann cells through a different
  route to ERK that involves PKCε and Lck and that is independent of signaling through
  the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. (B and C) Direct injection of M. leprae into sciatic nerves
  of Rag–/– knockout mice induces demyelination (C), in contrast to injection of phosphate-buffered
  saline alone, which shows almost intact myelinated Schwann cell–axon units (B).
