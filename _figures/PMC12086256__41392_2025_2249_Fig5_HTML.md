caption: Interactions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) with
  co-receptors and structural features of Neuropilin. a Interaction of VEGFR1 with
  co-receptors NRP1 and NRP2, α5β1 integrin, and FGFR1. The VEGFR1-NRP2 interaction
  facilitates VEGF-A121 binding, whereas VEGFR1 engagement with α5β1 promotes EC adhesion
  to the extracellular matrix. Additionally, the interaction of VEGFR1 with FGFR1
  blocks FGF2-induced angiogenesis, highlighting the role of the VEGFR1 complex in
  modulating angiogenic signaling pathways and EC behavior. b Association of VEGFR2
  with various co-receptors and adhesion molecules, including NRPs (NRP1 and NRP2),
  PDGFRβ, EGFR, CD44, EphA4, VE-Cadherin, and c-Met. These interactions contribute
  to the specificity and complexity of VEGF signaling, enabling crosstalk between
  VEGF receptors and other signaling pathways. Such an association with co-receptors
  and adhesion molecules enhances cellular responses, including EC migration, adhesion,
  and survival, supporting key physiological processes such as angiogenesis, vascular
  maturation, and cellular adhesion dynamics within the VEGF pathway. c Interaction
  between VEGFR3 and the co-receptor NRP2, which plays a critical role in promoting
  lymphangiogenesis and supporting EC survival. d NRP is shown with additional structural
  motifs, including the CUB, FV/VIII, MAM, and SEA domains. These domains contribute
  to receptor interactions and enhance signaling specificity within the VEGF pathway,
  potentially influencing binding affinities and receptor-ligand selectivity. NRP
  neuropilin, FGFR fibroblast growth factor receptor, PDGFR platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor, EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor. Created in BioRendender.com
