caption: EGFR (a) and NF-κB (b) pathway-focused RT-PCR gene expression analysis of
  representative TNBC PDX RNA samples collected before and after Pan-HER treatment.
  RNA samples corresponding to representative PDX tumor model BCM-2147 (subgroup 2)
  were extracted from three independent mice (PDX)/group treated with either vehicle
  control or Pan-HER for 3 cycles at the end of the experiment (day 21 after the initial
  injection). Triplicate RT-PCR plates were run and relative fold changes of Pan-HER-
  vs. vehicle control-treated samples for each gene were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA; Qiagen). Genes shown in green represent those significantly downregulated,
  while those in red upregulated. A twofold change cut-off in gene expression threshold
  was considered as significantly changed (P < 0.001). Further details, as well as
  a similar analysis performed in three additional PDX models are shown as
