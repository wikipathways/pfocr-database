  Exogenous antigens that are taken up either by endocytosis or phagocytosis requires
  fusion with lysosomes for the process of degradation. Finally, the degraded antigen
  fragments are loaded onto the MHC class II molecules for antigen presentation. Lysosomotropic
  drugs like HCQ and CQ accumulate inside the lysosome and these drugs potentially
  increase the pH inside and disrupt lysosomal functions'
