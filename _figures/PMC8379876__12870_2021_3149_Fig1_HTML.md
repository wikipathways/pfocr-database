caption: 'The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. The phenylpropanoid pathway produces
  phenolic compounds branching from phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), including monolignols
  that lead to the biosynthesis of lignin subunits. The disruption of some of these
  enzymes results in brown midrib (bmr) mutants. Sorghum plants with bmr12-ref have
  a null mutation in caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and plants with bmr6-ref
  have a null mutation in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). Both mutations result
  in altered lignification, such as the reduction of S-lignin in bmr12, and altered
  concentrations of wall-bound and soluble phenolics. Other abbreviations: C4H (cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase), 4CL (4-coumarate: CoA ligase), HCT (p-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase),
  C3’H (4-coumarate hydroxylase), CSE (caffeoyl shikimate esterase), CCoAOMT (caffeoyl
  CoA-O-methyltransferase), CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase), F5H (ferulate 5-hydroxylase)'
