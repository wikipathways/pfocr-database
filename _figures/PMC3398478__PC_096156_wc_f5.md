caption: Mating, Filamentous Growth, and Virulence in U. maydis.In Ustilago, several
  MAPKs regulate mating by acting downstream of the pheromone receptor (see text for
  details). Along with cAMP signaling, MAPKs are also involved in filamentous growth
  and virulence. The cAMP pathway comprises heterotrimeric G proteins that function
  upstream of the adenylate cyclase Uac1. cAMP-dependent PKA holoenzyme works as a
  tetramer comprising two catalytic subunits (Adr1) and two regulatory subunits (Ubc1).
  When cAMP level is low, binding of regulatory subunits prevents catalytic activity.
  At higher cAMP levels, conformational changes allow release of catalytic subunits
  that enter in the nucleus. MAPK and cAMP signaling converge toward TF Prf1, which
  controls expression of pheromone- and virulence-induced genes. Hap2 is another MAPK
  substrate controlling expression of Prf1. In light of this study, previous MAPK
  names are depicted in parentheses. This figure has been adapted from .
