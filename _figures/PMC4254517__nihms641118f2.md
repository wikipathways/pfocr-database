caption: (A) Anti- and (B) pro-apoptotic roles of RIPK1(A) Upon TNFR-1 ligation, RIPK1
  stabilizes TNF-R1-induced complex I preventing transition to the pro-apoptotic complex
  II. Also, RIPK1 facilitates the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, promoting
  the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as FLIP. FLIP inhibits FADD-induced
  caspase-8 homo-dimerization in complex II, blocking apoptosis. RIPK1, TAK1 and TAB1
  promote, but are not always required for NF-κB activation in response to TNFR ligation.(B)
  In the absence of IAPs, or with the expression of a kinase inactive RIPK3 mutant
  (RIPK3D161N), or addition of a RIPK3 kinase inhibitor, or after enforced RIPK3 dimerization
  (dimRIPK3) in the absence of MLKL, RIPK1 can promote apoptosis via the recruitment
  of FADD and caspase-8.
