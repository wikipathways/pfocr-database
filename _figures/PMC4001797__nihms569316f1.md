caption: A typical contraction in a mammalian cardiomyocyte is initiated by Ca2+ entry
  into the cytosol via L-type Ca2+ channels on the sarcolemma. This Ca2+ influx can
  directly cause release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine
  receptor (RyR2) channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) resulting in an increased
  [Ca2+]i. The high levels of [Ca2+]i, in turn, trigger the myofilaments to contract
  and result in activation of CamKIIγ which can phosphorylates phospholamban to release
  its inhibition from Serca2a. Serca2a then pumps Ca2+ from the cytosol into the SR
  for the next cardiac cycle. Ca2+signaling can also be initiated by vasopressin through
  the G-protein coupled AVP receptor to activate the IP3 pathway. Local production
  of IP3 results in release of Ca2+ form the SR via the IP3 receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel.
  The removal of cytosolic Ca2+ is also through Serca2a.
