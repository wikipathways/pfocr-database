caption: The diagrams summing up the pathogenetic pathways relevant to BBB disruption
  in TBE and discussed in the paper. The red arrows signify a positive and the blue
  arrows a negative (inhibitory) effect. (A) The main elements in the pathogenesis
  of the CNS infection and inflammation in TBE. TBE virus circulating in periphery
  can enter the CNS through intact BBB, but an inflammatory disruption of the BBB
  may further intensify this process. BBB disruption may be initiated by inflammatory
  mediators acting from the luminal side during peripheral infection and further exacerbated
  by a following inflammation within the CNS in the neurologic phase of the disease.
  BBB disruption may further contribute to CNS inflammation by facilitating access
  of inflammatory mediators and cells from periphery. Positive feedback loops between
  these elements are likely, but their exact interrelation in a human disease is not
  known. (B) The hypothesized place of the main groups of mediators analyzed in the
  current study in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and BBB disruption in TBE.
  Proinflammatory cytokines may disrupt the BBB directly and through upregulating
  matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), acting both from luminal side in peripheral inflammation
  and abluminally during CNS infections; this may be attenuated by anti-inflammatory
  and immunomodulatory cytokines like IL-10. Effective antiviral response in periphery,
  for example mediated by interferons of IL-15, may protect the BBB by reducing peripheral
  viral burden and inflammation. MMPs act on the BBB from the luminal side (e.g.,
  MMP8 and MMP9 from leukocytes) and abluminal side (derived from infiltrating leukocytes
  and/or from glial cells). L-selectin may be upregulated intrathecally as a result
  of leukocyte infiltration, being rather a marker than a cause of the BBB disruption.
  BBB—blood–brain barrier, CNS—central nervous system, IFNs—interferons, TGF—transforming
  growth factor, TNF—tumor necrosis factor, MMPs—matrix metalloproteinases, VEGF—vascular
  endothelial growth factor, TBE—tick-borne encephalitis
