caption: Stress responses to aneuploidy and radiation. (a) Aneuploidy triggers both
  gene dosage imbalances and ER as well as proteotoxic stress. This leads together
  to oxidative stress and ROS accumulation. In turn, ROS can trigger JNK stress signalling.
  In parallel, cells activate p38 signalling, which can reduce the activity levels
  of the JNK pathway. In acentrosomal cells, the accumulation of ROS leads to induction
  of G6PD. This mechanism may also be present in aneuploid cells. It is likely that
  cells buffer JNK levels through p38 and potentially through G6PD to promote cytoprotective
  processes first, while higher levels of ROS and JNK activate apoptosis. (b) Radiation
  can trigger DNA damage. This activates primarily the DDR through the ATM/tefu–Chk2
  and ATR/mei-41–Chk1 signalling branches. While both contribute to a genotoxic stress
  response through DNA repair, ATM/tefu–Chk2 mediates mostly p53-mediated apoptosis
  and can induce G2 cell cycle arrest after low-dose irradiation. ATR/mei-41–Chk1
  signalling triggers G2 cell cycle arrest after strong irradiation. Additionally,
  the JNK stress signalling pathway is activated due to DNA damage. Both p53, which
  is activated through the DDR, and JNK mediate an apoptotic response in cells with
  high levels of DNA damage after irradiation. Similar to stress responses to aneuploidy,
  the involved pathways likely buffer apoptotic signalling to determine whether cells
  undergo cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or undergo cell death.
