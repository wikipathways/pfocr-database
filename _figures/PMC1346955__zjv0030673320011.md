caption: Model for the interaction between activated MEK and the suppression of PKR
  function during viral infection of tumor cells by Δγ134.5 mutant viruses. Earlier
  studies demonstrated that activation of the ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway by either
  oncogenic activating mutations of RAS isoforms, point mutations within B-RAF alleles,
  or receptor tyrosine kinase activation/overexpression is involved in transformation
  and tumor progression. In addition, Ras-independent activation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
  is cell and tumor type specific. This report shows that activated MEK suppresses
  PKR autophosphorylation and effectively blocks PKR-mediated eIF-2α phosphorylation.
  Tumor cells with activated MEK/ERK signaling therefore are exquisitely permissive
  to Δγ134.5 mutant viral replication and oncolysis.
