caption: Schematic diagram for cell apoptosis induced by αNAC depletion. FADD exclusively
  mediates αNAC anti-apoptotic effect. The one of the downstream pathway of FADD is
  JNK pathway. MEKK1, ASK1, and (or) other kinases transduce the signal from FADD
  to JNK. There is another (or others) pathway partially mediated the apoptotic effect
  of αNAC depletion in JNK-independent manner
