caption: 'Summary of pathways controlling muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle
  protein breakdown (MPB). The role of myostatin in MPS and MPB has also been included.
  Myostatin is held in an inactive state by its pro-peptide, follistatin, and inhibitory
  binding proteins – growth and differentiation factor-associated serum protein-1
  (GASP-1) and follistatin-like related gene, (FLRG) as shown. Upon activation, it
  binds to its transmembrane receptor activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB), which then
  forms homodimers with activin receptor-like kinase 4 or 5 (Alk 4/5). The SMAD signaling
  pathway is then activated and translocation of this transcription factor complex
  to the nucleus occurs, where MyoD production and therefore myoblast proliferation
  and fusion are blocked. Myostatin is also proposed to increase proteosomal activity
  in a FoxO-dependent manner. Activation of MAP kinase is mediated via myostatin either
  via p38 or ERK1/2, which leads to the blocking of genes involved in myogenesis.Notes:
