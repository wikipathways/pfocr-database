caption: Cyclophosphamide metabolic pathway. Cyclophosphamide activation is mediated
  by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and involves its conversion to 4-hydroxy cyclophosphamide.
  This metabolite partially tautomerizes into aldophosphamide, which undergoes non-enzymatic
  degradation into phosphoramide and acrolein. Phosphoramide is responsible for DNA
  cross-linking (cytotoxicity), acrolein for bladder toxicity. Both are detoxified
  or inactivated by glutathione transferase. Alternatively, aldophosphamide may be
  oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to inactive carboxyphosphamide.ALDH = aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; GST = glutathione transferase.
