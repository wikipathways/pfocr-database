caption: Related pathways include the folate pathway, which is involved in DNA synthesis,
  and the methionine and glutathione pathways, which are necessary for DNA methylation
  and for conjugation of electrophilic substrates, respectively. Substrates and products
  of enzymatic reactions appear in boxes. Enzymes appear in color-coded bubbles according
  to their association with birth defects risk and maternal folic acid supplement
  use (Green), obesity (Purple) and tobacco use (Blue).
