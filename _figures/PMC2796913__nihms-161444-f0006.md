caption: On the basis of the isotope labeling patterns, the genetic analysis, and
  the enzymatic studies, a reasonable biosynthetic pathway for the formation of the
  aziridine carboxylate starter unit can now be formulated (). The reaction is initiated
  by AzicM-catalyzed activation of the β-carboxylate group of either D- or L-aspartate
  (10) as an adenylate, which then serves as the aminoacyl donor for the carrier protein
  AzicP. The AzicP-linked aspartate (21), with a free α-carboxylate group, is the
  substrate for the PLP-dependent decarboxylase, AzicN. After decarboxylation, the
  resulting AzicP-tethered β-alanine (22) is oxidized by a P450 (AzicO2) or flavin-dependent
  (AzicO1 or O6) monooxygenase to the AzicP-tethered isoserine (23). Cyclization of
  the resulting isoserine, which has a β-aminoalcohol moiety, may occur through an
  intramolecular SN2 reaction leading to the displacement of the hydroxyl group by
  the amino group to generate the aziridine carboxyl starter unit (24). However, the
  identity of the enzyme catalyzing the last cyclization step is not immediately apparent.
  An alternative route (see ) involving the activation of the α-carboxylate of aspartate
  is less likely, as AzicN would be required to catalyze the decarboxylation of a
  β-carboxylate.
