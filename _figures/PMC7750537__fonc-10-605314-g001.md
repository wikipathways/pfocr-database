caption: Overview of the coagulation and clotting factor signaling. Increased levels
  of platelet blood counts and coagulation cascade activation are determinants of
  a hypercoagulable state. Platelet production (thrombopoiesis) at the bone marrow
  by megakaryocytes determines platelet counts (A). Upon vascular damage, platelets
  become activated, adhere to the vascular endothelium and promote neutrophil activation
  and NET release (B). Platelets, Neutrophils and Endothelial cells become activated
  and promote thrombus formation, a process mediated by the coagulation cascade activation
  (C). TF, a transmembrane receptor, initiate the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway
  once bound in a quaternary complex with FVIIa, that is inhibited by TFPI. The cleavage
  of FX by FVIIa gives rise to FXa, which in turn cleaves prothrombin into thrombin.
  Thrombin, FXa and other proteases such as Plasmin, MMPs, and aPC can activate PARs,
  which signal through PLC-PKC-Ca2+Pathway and activate other signaling pathways such
  as NFkB and ERK1/2, leading to platelet, neutrophil and EC activation. This pathway
  also promotes cancer cell growth and invasion. PAR activation leads to receptor
  internalization, which classically occurs through the endolyosomoal pathway. aPC,
