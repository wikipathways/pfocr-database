caption: Cytokine signalling, the Wnt pathway (canonical and non-canonical) and Hippo-independent
  Src family kinase (SFK)-YAP signalling connects inflammatory signals to the regenerative
  response. Interleukin (IL)-6, and other members of the cytokine family, signal through
  receptors that use the gp130 subunit. STAT3 is activated by the tyrosine kinases
  JAK1 and JAK2 in response to gp130 or IL-22R signalling. In addition, cytokine signalling
  recruits SFK to gp130, which leads to phosphorylation, stabilization and nuclear
  translocation of YAP and its orthologue TAZ. Nuclear YAP and TAZ act as transcriptional
  co-activators of TEAD transcription factors. In non-stimulated epithelial cells,
  YAP and TAZ remain in the cytoplasm and undergo proteasomal degradation as a result
  of phosphorylation of inhibitory serine residues by LATS1/2 kinases. LATS1/2 is
  activated by Hippo/MST and inhibited by non-canonical Wnt signalling (FZD-ROR1/2
  complex) owing to Gα12/13-dependent Rho activation. Canonical Wnt signalling (FZD-LPR5/6
  complex), however, stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting its continuous degradation
  by the destruction complex. Stabilized β-catenin can then translocate to the nucleus
  and stimulate TCF-mediated gene transcription.

  description: Cytokine signalling, the Wnt pathway (canonical and non-canonical)

    is activated by the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 in response to gp130 or IL-22R
    signalling. In addition, cytokine signalling recruits SFK to gp130, which leads
