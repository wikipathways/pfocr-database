caption: 'Control of the concentration of transcripts for enzymes involved in central
  carbon metabolism. Ratios of mRNA concentrations (white bar) and mRNA half-lives
  (grey bar) are represented for the three growth rate comparisons (left to right:
  0.20 versus 0.10 h−1, 0.40 versus 0.20 h−1 and 0.63 versus 0.40 h−1) for 34 genes
  encoding enzymes of the central carbon metabolism. Growth rate comparisons for which
  the mRNA concentration is controlled mainly by degradation (ρD classes IV and V)
  are colored in red. The pathway names are given in boxes (PP: pentose phosphate
  pathway, ED: Entner–Doudoroff pathway, TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle) and the direction
  of flow are indicated by arrows. Metabolites, GLC: glucose, PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate,
  6PG: 6-phosphogluconate, PYR: pyruvate, OAA: oxaloacetate, AcCoA: acetyl-CoA and
