caption: Down-regulation of nucleotide metabolism by QsmR. The levels of intermediates
  of nucleotide metabolism were plotted on pathway maps. The x and y axes refer to
  two different incubation times and show metabolite concentrations (in pmol per 109
  cells), respectively. Red, blue, and black lines indicate wild-type BGR1, the tofI
  mutant BGS2, and the qsmR mutant BGS9, respectively. Blunt arrows in red indicate
  QsmR-mediated repression of target genes. Each value is an average of data from
  at least three independent experiments, and statistical analyses of the data are
  presented in .
