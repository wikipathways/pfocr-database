caption: a| The indicated pathogens express mannose-containing ligands that bind DC-specific
  intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and induce crosstalk
  with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through RAF1 signalling. Induction of RAF1 signalling
  involves the participation of the LSP1–KSR1–CNK scaffolding complex and upstream
  activators (LARG, Ras, and RhoA) and mediates phosphorylation and acetylation of
  TLR-activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit. This causes enhanced transcription
  of the Il10, Il12a and Il12b genes due to the enhanced DNA-binding affinity and
  transcriptional activity of acetylated p65. b| Helicobacter pylori binds DC-SIGN
  through fucose-containing lipopolysaccharide Lewis antigens and activates LSP1-dependent
  but RAF1-independent signalling, leading to increased IL-10, decreased IL-12 and
  the inhibition of TH1 cell development. c| Borrelia burgdorferi uses the salivary
  protein Salp15 of its tick vector to induce DC-SIGN–TLR crosstalk. Here, DC-SIGN-induced
  RAF1 signalling does not lead to p65 acetylation but stimulates MEK signalling,
  which promotes Il6 and Tnf mRNA decay and impairs nucleosome remodeling at the Il12a
  promoter. This divergent RAF1 pathway might be attributed to possible Salp15 binding
  to CD4, which might participate in the crosstalk. This DC-SIGN–TLR crosstalk does
  not destabilize Il10 mRNA, but, rather, IL-10 production is synergistically enhanced
  and leads to inhibition of DC maturation. d| In neutrophils, mycobacteria interact
  with a C-type lectin (possibly Clec5A) linked to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif (ITAM)-bearing DAP12. This interaction induces spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-dependent
  crosstalk with the TLR2–MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein
  88) pathway, which synergistically upregulates IL-10 through sustained phosphorylation
  of AKT and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This decreases lung inflammation
  but increases the persistence of a high mycobacterial burden in a mouse lung infection
  model. CNK, connector enhancer of KSR; KSR1, kinase suppressor of Ras-1; LARG, leukemia-associated
  RhoA guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor; LSP1, leukocyte-specific protein-1.
