caption: Model of furin trafficking in the endosomal system. Furin molecules are internalized
  via dynamin-sensitive, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Within early endosomes shared
  by TfR, furin phosphorylated by CKII is directed toward a cell surface recycling
  pathway by virtue of its selective interaction with PACS-1, which links phosphorylated
  furin to components of the clathrin sorting machinery (). This endosome to plasma
  membrane recycling pathway mirrors the local cycling loop which localizes furin
  to the TGN (). Furin molecules dephosphorylated by PP2A isoforms containing B regulatory
  subunits are sorted from the plasma membrane/early endosome cycling loop to a TGN
  retrieval pathway. Black shading of either the tyrosine or AC motifs denotes their
  “active” state whereas gray shading reflects a “silencing” of these signals.
