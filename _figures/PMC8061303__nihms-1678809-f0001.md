caption: (A) General description of acetoxypyranose (1)-based oxidopyryilum cycloaddition
  reaction, along with alternative dimerization pathway. (B) Synthesis of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone-based
  oxidopyrylium ylide dimer 6 from allomaltol 5, and usage in the synthesis of 3,7-dihydroxytropolone
  9, which had potent antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus -1 and -2, and
  relatively low cytotoxicity against Vero cells.
