caption: Therapeutic approaches targeting the LOX-1-oxLDL signaling pathway. Binding
  of a LOX-1 multimer to oxLDL causes receptor activation and signaling into the cell
  interior. Competitive inhibitors can block LOX-1 binding to oxLDL; however, down-regulation
  of LOX-1 expression using reverse genetics is a valid therapeutic approach. Finally,
  the use of membrane-permeable compounds to perturb LOX-1-oxLDL signaling in the
  cytosol could modulate molecular events associated with both CVD and cancer
