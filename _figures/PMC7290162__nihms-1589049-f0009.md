caption: SoNosP is a master regulator of the multicomponent S. oneidensis c-di-GMP
  signaling network. SoNosP and its associated signaling pathway are essential for
  regulating complex biofilm formation in S. oneidensis, and the molecular mechanism
  for this regulation is modulation of HnoB phosphodiesterase activity. (A) The ferrous-unligated
  SoNosP/NahK signaling pathway strongly inhibits the H-NOX/HnoK signaling pathway.
  Ferrous-unligated H-NOX, however, has recently been demonstrated to downregulate
  HnoK autokinase activity. Consequently, the flux of phosphate to both HnoB and HnoD
  (darker arrows) significantly decreases, causing unphosphorylated HnoD to inhibit
  HnoB phosphodiesterase activity. This decrease in HnoB activity leads to increased
  levels of intracellular c-di-GMP and therefore complex biofilm production. (B) The
  NO-bound SoNosP/NahK signaling pathway inhibits the H-NOX/HnoK signaling pathway.
  NO-bound H-NOX has previously been demonstrated to inhibit HnoK autokinase activity
  only in a large molar excess. As a result, the flux of phosphate to both HnoB and
  HnoD (darker arrows) occurs and the inhibition of HnoB phosphodiesterase activity
  is alleviated, leading to biofilm dispersal as phosphorylated HnoD does not inhibit
  HnoB activity. NahK displays a kinetic preference for HnoC (dark arrow, ), which
  is a dedicated transcription factor that regulates gene transcription. From the
  data provided above, we can conclude that HnoC has no implications in regulating
  biofilm formation in this bacterium.
