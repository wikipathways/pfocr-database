caption: The sphingolipid degradation pathway and microglia in neurodegenerative disease.
  Microglia function during both development and homeostasis to eliminate dying neurons,
  prune neuronal synapses, and clear myelin debris. To accomplish these functions,
  sphingolipid-rich membranes are acquired from exogenous sources through the lipid-sensing
  receptor TREM2 and then undergo lysosomal degradation within microglia. During aging
  and the diseases indicated, these microglial processes are accelerated. Gene mutations
  in the sphingolipid degradation pathway genes reduce catabolic capacity and lead
  to lysosomal storage of sphingolipids, causing intrinsic microglial defects (such
  as a dysfunctional endosome-lysosome system), as well as compromising homeostatic
  functions and inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype that promotes neurodegeneration.
