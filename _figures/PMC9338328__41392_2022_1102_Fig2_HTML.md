caption: Immunomodulatory effect of radiation on Treg cells. Radiation promotes the
  conversion from CD4+ T cells to Treg cells and enhances Treg function through IL-10R-mediated
  STAT3 signaling pathway. Radiation also increases the secretion of IL-10 which can
  bind to IL-10 receptors. This binding activates JAKs and activated JAKs, such as
  JAK1 and JAK2, phosphorylate STAT3 at Tyr705, resulting in translocation of activated
  STAT3 dimers to the nucleus. STAT3, as a cotranscription factor with FOXP3, promotes
  expansion, differentiation, and T cell suppression and increases CTLA-4 expression
  of Treg cells. In addition, miR-10a induced by radiation can enhance the expression
  level of FOXP3 and promote the differentiation of Treg from naive CD4+ T cell. Radiation
  increases the level of TGF-β in the TME greatly and TGF-β recognizes and binds TGFβRII,
  which then phosphorylates TGFβRI. TGF-β activates Smad2 and Smad3 and promotes the
  formation of a heterotrimer with Smad4. Smads are recruited to the CNS1 region which
  has been identified at the Foxp3 gene locus. The CNS1 promotes generation, expansion,
  differentiation, and development of Treg cells. Parts of this figure were drawn
