caption: Pathways for synthesis of DPPC. The de novo pathway requires phosphorylation
  of choline and subsequent acylation with palmitoyl CoAs. Choline can be derived
  from degradation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or dietary sources. The reacylation
  (remodeling) pathway requires lyso-PC, derived from phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity,
  that is then reacylated with palmitoyl CoA. CDP choline, cytidine diphosphocholine.
