caption: Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway interacting with EMT and the TGF-β/IL-6 axis.
  It is well known that the TGF-β/IL-6 axis regulates EMT, and Wnt/β-catenin has been
  reported to directly promote EMT. Wnt/β-catenin activation mutations are present
  in approximately 40% of HCCs, especially in well-to-moderately differentiated HCCs.
  HNF4α, a target gene of Wnt, suppresses EMT, resulting in a non-aggressive phenotype
  with less metastasis and invasion. FOXM1, which is regulated by Wnt, promotes EMT
  and decreases E-cadherin expression, resulting in a poor prognostic phenotype with
  aggressive metastasis and invasion.
