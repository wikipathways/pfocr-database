caption: The chemostimuli hypoxia and hypercapnia depolarize type I cells through
  inhibition of TASK1/3 K+ channels (1), leading to Ca2+ entry through voltage‐gated
  Ca2+ channels (VGCC) and ATP release (2). ATP stimulates postsynaptic P2X2/3 receptors
  on petrosal afferent nerve terminals causing excitation, as well as P2Y2 receptors
  (P2Y2R) on adjacent glial‐like type II cells. P2Y2R stimulation leads to Ca2+ release
  from intracellular stores via inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signalling pathways and
  opening of pannexin‐1 channels, allowing further release of ATP into the synaptic
  cleft. ATP (from both type II and type I cells) is broken down by extracellular
  5′‐ectonucleotidase (5′ENT) into adenosine (ADO) (3), which activates primarily
  ADO A2A receptors (A2AR) on type I cells. Activation of A2A receptors leads to inhibition
  of TASK1/3 channels to further enhance type I cell depolarization (4) (Xu et al.
  ), and therefore ATP release. Omitted for clarity is the pathway by which hypoxia
  stimulates ADO release from type I cells via a plasma membrane nucleoside transporter,
  and negative feedback pathways by which ATP inhibits type I cells via P2Y1 receptors
  (Xu et al. ) and pannexin‐1 channels in type II cells (Nurse, ).
