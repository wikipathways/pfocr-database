caption: NOTCH signaling in cardiac valve development. (A) NOTCH is essential for
  early heart valve development (i.e., endocardial cushion formation). Cardiac valve
  development starts with the formation of endocardial cushions through the endocardial-to-mesenchymal
  transformation (EMT) (blue arrows) process in wild-type (WT) mouse embryos. The
  EMT process is severely blocked in the NOTCH loss-of-function (LOF) mutant embryos.
  Mechanistically, NOTCH activates the transcription of Snail, which subsequently
  represses the expression of VE cadherin. The downregulation of VE cadherin is prerequisite
  for the endocardial cells to delaminate the endocardial sheet and undergo EMT. NOTCH
  also induces the expression of Wnt4 in the endocardium, which activates the canonical
  WNT signaling in the myocardium (Myo). The activation of WNT signaling in the myocardium
  promotes the expression of Bmp2, which feeds back to the endocardium through Bmpr1
  and regulates the EMT via stabilizing the Snail protein in the nucleus. Bmp2 also
  promotes the proliferation of mesenchymal cells (MCs) during endocardial cushion
  formation. (B) NOTCH controls the cardiac valve remodeling through regulating the
  apoptosis and proliferation. NOTCH in the valve endocardial cells (VECs) promotes
  the expression of Tnfa, which subsequently induces the apoptosis of valve interstitial
  cells (VICs) originated from VECs (blue cells) and NCCs (red cells) during valvulogenesis.
  On the other hand, NOTCH in VECs directly activates the expression of Hbegf, which
  then inhibits the proliferation of VICs through repressing SMAD signaling. Genetic
  disruption of the NOTCH signaling pathway results in decreased expression of Tnfa
  and Hbegf, leading to the thickened valve leaflets and BAV, the most common congenital
  heart valve defect.
