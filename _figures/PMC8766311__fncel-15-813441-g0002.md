caption: Alterations in developmental GABA shift lead to neuropsychiatric disorders.
  (A) The persistent depolarizing action of GABA beyond the critical period, impairs
  network excitability and the E/I balance. Abnormal reactive microglia, produces
  high levels of ROS, often associated with an inflammatory state caused by a dysfunction
  of the immune system. BDNF, released from microglia contributes to downregulate
  KCC2 with consequent enhancement of network excitability. (B) The early hyperpolarizing
  action of GABA at birth, caused by the reduced expression of NKCC1, following deletion
  of TrkB from immature DGCs, at the time when these cells integrate the classical
  tri-synaptic pathway, severely alters the morphology and circuitry downstream of
  DGCs. In (A,B) both pre (GABAergic interneurons, green) and post synaptic (targeted
  cells, violet) elements are represented. Red arrows indicate the direction of Cl−
  flux through GABAA receptor channels.
