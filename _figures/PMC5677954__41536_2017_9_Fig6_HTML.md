caption: 'Schematic illustration of osteoblastic differentiation-related molecular
  mechanism under combined cytokine treatment. BMP-2 activates Runx2 through p38 MAPK
  and SMAD1/5 signaling. IGF-1 triggers two interactive pathways: one is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathway, which inhibits Runx2 by inhibiting SMAD1/5; the other is the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, which activates osterix and β-catenin. Runx2 is essential for early stage
  of BMSC differentiation, while osterix and β-catenin plays a vital role in proliferation
  and later stage of bone cell differentiation'
