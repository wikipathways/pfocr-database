  connection to glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation. Enzymes are designated in bold
  blue letters, adopted from the nomenclature in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Where more
  than one isozyme operates in this yeast, numbers behind the three-letter code have
  been omitted. Enzymes marked by a red asterisk are encoded by only one essential
  gene in the milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, i.e., deletions are not viable. One-headed
