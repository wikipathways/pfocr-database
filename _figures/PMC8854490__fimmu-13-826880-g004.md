caption: Micronucleus-derived DNA activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. DNA
  double-strand breaks caused by physical or chemical factors during mitosis can be
  repaired by homologous recombination in normal cells. However, due to the instability
  of the cancer genome, chromosomal missegregation is often caused during mitosis,
  resulting in the formation of micronuclei. The nuclear membrane of these micronuclei
  is fragile and easily ruptured, causing the DNA to leak into the cytoplasm, which
  in turn activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway.
