caption: In the absence of stress or under dark conditions, LOVHK is inactive and
  NepR can interact with both unphosphorylated PhyR and RpoE1 (σECF), thus preventing
  RpoE1 association with RNAP (RNA polymerase). Upon blue-light exposure or other
  stress signal, LOVHK is activated, it autophosphorylates and, subsequently, transfers
  the phosphate moiety to LovR and PhyR. PhyR phosphorylation stabilizes PhyR~P/NepR
  complexes, thus releasing RpoE1, which can now associate with the RNAP. The RNAP-RpoE1
  complex is now able to regulate directly or indirectly the expression of stress-related
  genes such as rpoH1, dps, phyR and lovR. LOVHK, probably indirectly, up-regulates
  the expression of virB operon in a GSR independent manner. Finally, the evidence
  from in vitro experiments suggests that LovR decreases LOVHK phosphorylated state.
  In summary, LOVHK contributes to the activation of the GSR system and affects the
  virB operon expression by an unknown mechanism (dashed arrow). Arrows with a continuous
  line suggest a direct interaction.
