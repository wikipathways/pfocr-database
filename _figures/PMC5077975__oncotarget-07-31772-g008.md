caption: Zymosan induces ROS production through a TLR2/MyD88/c-Src/NADPH oxidase pathway,
  which in turn caused the activation of p38 MAPK and consequently the activation
  and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. NF-κB thus switches on iNOS expression, and
  increases NO production and ONOO− release from neutrophils, which eventually permeabilizes
  adjacent PMVECs. Subanesthetic isoflurane exerts a protective role for this pathological
  process by inhibiting c-Src activity, which is probably attributed to isoflurane
  targeting of the NMDA glutamate receptor and thereby suppression of the calcium
  signaling in neutrophils.
