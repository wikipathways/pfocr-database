caption: 'VEGF receptor-induced signaling pathway. VEGF plays a key role in physiological
  blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis such as tumor growth and ischemic
  diseases. VEGF-dependent cell survival is mediated via phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase Akt, which inhibits the protein
  Bad, leading to inhibition of caspase activity and also causes Ca2+-independent
  activation of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) through phosphorylation. This pathway
  is necessary for cellular migration. A major mitogenic signaling mechanism for VEGF
  involves activation of phospholipase C (PLC-γ) resulting in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate, production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG), and subsequent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C (PKC)
  activation. PKC mediates activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK)
  1/2 via RAS, Raf-1 and MEK, mediating mitogenesis in association with mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK). Binding of the growth factor to its corresponding cell surface
  receptor (VEGFR) activates complex signal transduction pathways, involving changes
  in protein phosphorylation, ion fluxes, gene expression, protein synthesis and ultimately
  a biological response related with angiogenesis. Functional signaling converges
  at several points, emphasizing how signaling pathways are integrated to form signal
  transduction networks. For inhibition of this signaling pathway, the Pegaptanib
  binds to VEGF, blocking the formation of the complex VEGF-receptor and consequently
  inhibiting signal transduction and angiogenesis.Abbreviation: ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
