caption: Proposed model of the role of PDE5 in the regulation of aromatase in osteoblasts.
  14 inhibits the activity of PDE5, thereby stimulating the intracellular cGMP level,
  which causes PKG activation. PKG activation by 14 stimulated the activity of SHP2,
  which subsequently activated Src and ERK signaling and increased ERK-dependent gene
  expression, including that of aromatase, in osteoblasts.
