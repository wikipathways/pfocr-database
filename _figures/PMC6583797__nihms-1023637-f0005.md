caption: (A) Schematic representation of chemical class grouping of metabolites from
  MetaMapp analysis. The reconstructed metabolic network (MetaMapp) comprises biochemical
  reaction pairs (Kegg substrate-product pairs) and structural similarity (Tanimoto
  score > 0.7).(B) MetaMapp of STR in 12- to 16-week-old animals (young) (n = 6 animals
  for each region). Node colors indicate significant changes of metabolite levels
  (p < 0.05 by a two-tailed Student’s t test) in MetaMapp of STR in 12- to 16-week-old
  animals (young). Node colors indicate significant changes of metabolite levels (p
  < 0.05 by a two-tailed Student’s t test) in HdhQ(150/150) brain regions compared
  to those in WT (red, elevated metabolites and blue, decreased metabolites in HdhQ(150/150)
  (brain). Node size represents the fold-change of differentially expressed metabolite
  in HdhQ(150/150) brain compared to that of control. No one metabolite is a reliable
  biomarker for disease. MetaMapp is designed to identify groups of related metabolites,
  which is a strong indicator of a perturbed pathway. The individual metabolites are
  listed for inspection in ().(C) MetaMapp of CBL and HIP in young mice, same as (B).(D)
  FA and AA fingerprints among brain regions are indicated. The arrow indicates the
  direction of increasing sensitivity (prominent metabolites are listed in ). (n =
  6 animals for each region). False discovery rate and Q value for each metabolite
  is based on significance analysis of microarray (SAM, delta value is set to 1) (),
  and pathway over-representation analysis is based on global test and pathway impact
