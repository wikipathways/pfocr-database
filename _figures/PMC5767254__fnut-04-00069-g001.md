caption: myomiRs and muscle mass wasting and atrophy pathways. MyoD is able to activate
  miR-206, promoting an inhibiting effect on Twist-1 protein, diminishing muscle cell
  differentiation (). miR-206 and miR-21 regulate the action of YY1 and eIF4E3, promoting
  muscle mass wasting (). Myostatin increases miR-1 expression, promoting a reduction
  in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) action, decreasing Akt phosphorylation, and its
  regulation of Foxo3. When Foxo3 is not phosphorylated, the expression of several
  proteins that induce atrophy, including Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, are enhanced (). The
  let-7d-3p downregulates transferrin receptor (TFRC), affecting muscle cell proliferation
  and myogenic differentiation (). miR-3184-3p inhibits Wnt/β-catenin pathway, impairing
  myogenic differentiation (). mir-345-5p downregulates genes and proteins involved
  in IGF1 pathway, decreasing anabolic signaling. miR-1296-5p regulates HTR2A gene,
  reducing the participation of serotonin in the induction of myogenesis (). miR-199a-3p
  affects the EIF4EBP1 gene, reducing mTOR pathway activity, interfering in protein
  synthesis (). miR-423-3p promotes reduction of calcium signaling, affecting CAMK2A
  gene (). miR-423-5p downregulates DLK1, what is involved with muscle hypertrophy;
  thus, reducing this capacity ().
