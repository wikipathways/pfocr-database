caption: A model to explain the effects of varying Fgf8 dosage on cell survival. Our
  data identify two classes of response to variations in Fgf8 expression in the developing
  mouse forebrain, schematically illustrated in A. The x and y axes represent FGF8
  concentration and pathway(s) activity, respectively. One response is proportionate
  with the level of Fgf8 expression (Right), and the other, a Foxg1 pathway, is not
  (Left). We suggest that genes, expressed as part of the proportionate response,
  such as Spry1, encode inhibitors of the Foxg1 cell-survival pathway and that their
  expression is not subject to negative feedback. (B) Schematic diagram illustrating
  the combined responses to variation in FGF8 concentration, in which it is assumed
  that the proportionate response is activated at a higher level of FGF8 than is the
  Foxg1-dependent response. In the absence of FGF8 (Tel-KO midline), the Foxg1 pathway
  is inactive and cell survival is reduced. At very low FGF8 concentrations, there
  is little or no inhibitor activity, so Foxg1 pathway activity is not antagonized
  and cell survival is high. We suggest that the FGF8 concentration is within this
  range in the midline of hypomorphs. As FGF8 concentration rises, the inhibitor(s)
  produced as part of the proportionate response becomes active and begins to inhibit
  the Foxg1 pathway. Further increases result in more inhibitor activity and decreased
  cell survival. We suggest that the FGF8 concentration is within this range in the
  normal midline and in our gain-of-function experiments.
