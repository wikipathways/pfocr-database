caption: Important molecular mechanisms by which AEG-1 induces chemoresistance. AEG-1
  binds to the multidrug resistance 1/ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (MDR1/ABCB1)
  mRNA and increases its translation, thereby causing doxorubicin resistance. AEG-1
  induces the transcription factor late SV40 factor (LSF), resulting in an increase
  in thymidylate synthase, the substrate of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and increases the
  5-FU-metabolizing enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), collectively resulting
  in 5-FU resistance. AEG-1 activates the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target
  of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased ATG5 and protective autophagy,
  which confer a resistance to doxorubicin and 5-FU. AEG-1 interacts with retinoid
  X receptor (RXR), inhibiting retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/RXR-mediated gene regulation
  and thereby causing a resistance to retinoic acid. The AEG-1-induced expression
  of MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) and aldehyde dehydrogenase
  3 family member A1 (ALDH3A1) resulted in a resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin
  and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). See the text for more details.

  description: Important molecular mechanisms by which AEG-1 induces chemoresistance.
    AEG-1 binds to the multidrug resistance 1/ATP binding cassette subfamily B member
    1 (MDR1/ABCB1) mRNA and increases its translation, thereby causing doxorubicin
    resistance. AEG-1 induces the transcription factor late SV40 factor (LSF), resulting

    kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased
    ATG5 and protective autophagy, which confer a resistance to doxorubicin and 5-FU.
    AEG-1 interacts with retinoid X receptor (RXR), inhibiting retinoic acid receptor
