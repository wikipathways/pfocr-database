caption: High and low GnRH pulse frequencies stimulate different signaling pathways
  that mediate the synthesis of transcription factors and repressors controlling Fshb
  transcription. A) At a high GnRH pulse frequency, the GnRHR preferentially couples
  to Gαq/11 proteins, activating the PKC/MAPK pathway. This pathway stimulates ICER
  expression and synthesis. ICER attenuates GnRH stimulation of Fshb expression by
  antagonizing the binding of CREB to the Fshb CRE-AP1 site. SKIL and TGIF1 are also
  induced at high GnRH pulse frequencies and also bind to the Fshb gene promoter to
  prevent any potential action of cFos and cJun. B) At a low GnRH pulse frequency,
  the GnRHR preferentially couples to Gαs protein, activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway
  (indicated by bold arrows). The phosphorylated CREB protein binds to the homologous
  CRE-AP1 site of the Fshb promoter and recruits the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding
  protein (CBP), stimulating Fshb transcription. PKC/MAPK and Calcineurin/NFAT pathways
  are also activated, but to a lesser extent. They contribute to induction of Fshb
  transcription by stimulating cFos and cJun expression.
