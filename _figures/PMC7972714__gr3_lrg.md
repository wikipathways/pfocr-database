caption: 'Altered mitochondrial metabolism and increased urinary metabolites in the
  pathways of kynurenine and eicosanoids metabolism are associated with elevated PFASs
  in COVID-19 patients. (a) Urinary endogenous metabolites-PFASs association analysis.
  The metabolites that are significantly different between unhealthy controls (HC)
  and COVID-19 patients (VIP scores > 1.5 in PLS-DA) were used for the analysis. Data
  were log 2 transformed, and Spearman’s rank correlation was performed. The correlation
  threshold was set as 0.2 and P value ≤ 0.05. Edge color indicates a positive (red)
  or inverse (blue) correlation. (b) Multiple linear regression models were used to
  confirm the adjusted associations between PFASs exposure and altered urinary metabolites
  in COVID-19 patients. Z scores of Σ (12) PFASs were calculated, and urinary endogenous
  metabolites were log 2 transformed before analysis. The effect sizes (Beta) and
  P values were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, cardiovascular
  diseases (CVDs), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The combined effect
  of PFASs exposure on a metabolic pathway was meta-analyzed using the random-effects
  model. (c) The summary of metabolic dysregulations associated with PFASs exposure
  in COVID-19 patients. The red dots indicate the metabolites with significant positive
  associations with total PFASs in adjusted multiple linear regression models, while
  the pink dots were the metabolites without significant associations with PFASs.
  The gray dots are the metabolites that were not detected or targeted. Abbreviations:
