caption: Phenazine biosynthesis and self-resistance pathways. (a) The P. aeruginosa
  phenazine biosynthetic pathway. Redox potentials relative to the standard hydrogen
  electrode at pH 7.0 are given. PCA, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid; PCN, phenazine-1-carboxamide;
  5-Me-PCA, 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid; PYO, pyocyanin. (b) Model of phenazine-mediated
  SoxR activation, with SoxR bound to the chromosomal locus between the genes PA14_35160
  (pumA) and PA14_35170 (soxR). An additional SoxR target, the operon mexGHI-opmD,
  is shown below. (c) Phylogenetic distribution of orthologues of phzM (blue shading),
  pumA (yellow shading) and mexG (green shading) in the genus Pseudomonas.
