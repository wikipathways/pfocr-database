caption: Schematic model showing effect of GFRP overexpression on cellular homeostasis
  and endothelial function. Genetic modification or radiation-induced GFRP overexpression
  causes increased interaction of GFRP with GTPCH1, thereby inhibiting the catalytic
  activity of GTPCH1 (the rate limiting enzyme in the endogenous BH4 synthesis pathway).
  Inhibition of GTPCH1 leads to decrease in BH4 biosynthesis and BH4/BH2 ratio. The
  altered BH4/BH2 ratio causes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling, resulting in
  increased production of superoxide and decreased NO production. Superoxide can directly
  induce oxidative stress in cells by changing the reduced to oxidized ratio of the
  cellular thiol pool. Superoxide may also react with NO to form peroxynitrite, thus
  inducing nitrosative stress. Peroxynitrite also induces oxidative stress by further
  decreasing the cellular BH4 pool. To see this illustration in color, the reader
  is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars
