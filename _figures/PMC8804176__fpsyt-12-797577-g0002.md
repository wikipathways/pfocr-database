caption: The differential roles of ovarian hormones in the microglial immune response.
  PGRMC1 activation induces microglial activation whereas PR and E2 quiesces it. PGRMC1
  binds to progesterone leading to the inhibition of neurite outgrowth, microglia
  activation through the expression of CD11b and CD18, and the inhibition of BDNF.
  Conversely, GPER1 activation by E2 reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  TNF-α and IL-1β. In addition, E2 reduces microglial phagocytosis and cell migration
  through activation of the MAPK pathway and inhibits the release of reactive oxygen
  species NO and O2−. PR activation also has an anti- inflammatory effect through
  the inhibition of a various of inflammatory cytokines. Created with BioRender.com.
