caption: Activation of the NF-κB pathway by IL-1. IL-1 binds to its receptor (IL-1R1)
  and receptor-associated protein (IL-1RAcP), causing conformational changes in multiple
  receptor-bound proteins (MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, TAB2; see Figure  for definition).
  This results in recruitment and activation of transforming-growth-factor-κ-activated
  kinase-1 (TAK 1), which phosphorylates and activates NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK).
  In turn, NIK activates the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible
  for phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB (IκB) and NF-κB1 (a 105 kDa protein, p105).
  Upon phosphorylation, IκB and p105 become polyubiquitinated (U), which targets these
  proteins for degradation by the proteosome. Degradation of these cellular inhibitors
  allows translocation of NF-κB subunits to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate
  matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) promoters. The IκB-like protein, Bcl-3, promotes
  dimerization of the 50 kDa NF-κB subunit (p50) and regulates the transcriptional
  activity of p50.
