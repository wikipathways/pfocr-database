caption: Vitamin D3 metabolism and biological functions. In the canonical pathway,
  vitamin D3 can be hydroxylated by CYP27A1/CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 to form 25(OH)D3, and
  is then further hydroxylated to the active form 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 can bind
  with VDR/RXR and translocate to the cell nucleus, where it binds to VDRE to regulate
  the transcription of target genes. Besides, 1,25(OH)2D3 may bind with a membrane-associated
  receptor to mediate non-genomic actions. In the non-canonical pathway, 7-DHC and
  vitamin D3 are first hydroxylated by CYP11A1 and further hydroxylated by various
  cytochrome enzymes including CYP24A1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP2R1, CYP3A4, and CYP11A1
  to form dihydroxy or trihydroxy metabolites. These bioactive metabolites selectively
  act on not only VDR, but also on alternative nuclear receptors such as AHR, RORs
  or LXRs and binds to AHREs, ROREs or LXREs to regulate the transcription of target
  genes. UVB, ultraviolet B; 7DHC, 7-dehydrocholesterol; VDBP, vitamin D-binding protein;
  PTH, parathyroid hormone; VDR, vitamin D receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDREs,
  VDR response elements; CDK1, cyclin dependent kinase 1; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor;
  RORs, retinoic acid orphan receptors; LXRs, liver X receptors; AHREs, AHR response
  elements; ROREs, ROR response elements; LXREs, LXR response elements.
