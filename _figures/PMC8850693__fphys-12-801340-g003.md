caption: Effects of autophagy and exosomes during HSC activation. Under normal conditions,
  qHSCs are characterized by basal autophagic levels and exosome release, indicative
  of their phenotypic characteristics as a resting, vitamin-A storing cell. Both autophagy
  and exosomal cargo contribute to maintenance of homeostasis by their antifibrotic
  effects. On the other hand, activation process is divided in two phases; initiation
  and perpetuation. During initiation phase, liver injury results in increased stress
  levels, thereby inducing autophagy by mTOR signaling pathway. However, aggregation
  of harmful substances derived from injured liver cells, exceeds autophagy capacity
  to degrade them, thus exosome secretion is synergistically upregulated as an alternative
  pathway to alleviate proteotoxic stress. In addition, activation of HSCs requires
  high energy levels, thus energy deprivation results in activation of lipophagy and
  lipid droplet degradation. During perpetuation phase, aHSCs have now been adapted
  to their new phenotype and micronenvironment, thus they no longer confront energy
  deprivation, resulting in decreased autophagic levels. Downregulation of autophagy
  has been potentially associated with induction of harmful secretion of exosomes
  from aHSCs, thus resulting in propagation of liver fibrosis.
