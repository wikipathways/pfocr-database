caption: 'Short- and long-term effects of S1P receptor modulators on blood pressure
  regulation. S1P signaling pathway plays an essential role in vasoreactivity and
  vascular permeability. Blood flow exerts shear stress on the vessel’s endothelial
  wall, which activates the S1P endothelial pathway signaling through G protein–coupled
  S1P receptors. The nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)
  after S1P/S1PR1 activation cascade is critical for blood pressure homeostasis by
  generating vasorelaxation. Initially, S1P receptor modulators (S1PR-Ms) act as potent
  agonists on S1PR1 that induce transient endothelium-dependent vasodilation. S1PR1
  downregulation consecutive to S1PR overstimulation converts S1PR-M in functional
  antagonists. Pharmacological inhibition of S1PR1 decreases the eNOS/NO activation
  in response to shear stress and reduces flow-mediated vasodilation. Concomitantly,
  there is an increase in S1PR2 and S1PR3 expressions in vascular smooth muscle cells
  that generates sustained vasoconstriction via PKC/Rho/ROCK signaling pathway activation.
  Therefore, S1PR modulators can shift to a higher-than-normal blood pressure value
  due to impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation and predominant S1PR2- and S1PR3-mediated
  vasoconstriction.Source: Created with BioRender.com.Akt, Akt kinase; eNOS, endothelial
