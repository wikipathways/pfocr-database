caption: Mechanism of oxidative stress and inflammatory response leading to CHD associated
  with SLE. In the state of oxidative stress, the dysregulation of peroxide isoprostaglandins,
  MDA-LDL and antioxidant SOD promote the occurrence of atherosclerosis. In the inflammatory
  environment, macrophages produce PTX3 when stimulated by LPS, IL-1, and TNF-α. PTX3
  co-promotes the occurrence of atherosclerosis with TNF-α/NF-κB. Under the stimulation
  of LPS and TNF-α, SuPAR can bind to αvβ3 integrins and promote atherosclerosis through
  NF-κB pathway. When the body is in inflammatory response, the expression of Galectin-3
  is increased, which can accelerate the process of atherosclerosis through the NF-κB
  pathway or the PI3K pathway after binding with CD98. IL-1 = interleukin-1, LPS =
  lipopolysaccharide, MDA-LDL = malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein,
  NF-Κb = nuclear factor kappa-B, PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PTX3 = pentatoxin-3,
  SOD = superoxide dismutase, SuPAR = soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator
  receptor, TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α
