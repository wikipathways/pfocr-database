caption: General carotenoid metabolic pathway in horticultural crops. PSY catalyzes
  the first committed condensation step from GGPP to produce the first C40 carotene,
  phytoene. Following several desaturation and isomerization steps, lycopene is produced.
  The next cyclization yields the α-carotene and β-carotene branches. A wide range
  of carotenoids are degraded by CCDs or NCEDs to produce apocarotenoids. IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  IPI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; GGPPS, GGPP synthase; PSY, phytoene synthase;
