caption: Potential cellular and molecular mechanism of actions of polymersomes loaded
  with IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blockers and DNA demethylation inhibitors against COVID-19
  infection. Polymersomes will be synthesized, loaded with IL-6 receptor blockers
  and DNA demethylation inhibitors, and then functionalized with specific ligands
  to target cells expressing IL-6. IL-6 receptor blockers (e.g., a monoclonal antibody-based
  drug) would block the IL-6 receptor signaling pathway, while demethylation inhibitors
  might lead to epigenetic alteration, resulting in decreased expression of IL-6 receptor
  gene, thus downregulating IL-6 receptor in the targeted cell. Therefore, co-administration
  of these two therapeutics might cause effective synergistic effects to calm down
  the cytokine storm, which results mainly from the interaction of IL-6 and its receptor.
  The ADAMs (A disintegrin and metalloproteinases) are a family of transmembrane proteins
  that responsible for cleaving membrane-bound IL-6 receptor, resulting in soluble
  IL-6 receptor. Glycoprotein 130 (gp130) is a receptor for IL-6/sIL-6 receptor complex.
