caption: RAF activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Under normal conditions, the growth
  signalling cascades are initiated through binding of growth factors to growth factor
  receptor tyrosine kinase receptors at the cell surface. The GTPase RAS is then recruited
  to the plasma membrane, leading to its activation. RAS binds to and promotes dimer
  formation of the RAF family of kinases, a process crucial for kinase activation
  and downstream signal transduction.
