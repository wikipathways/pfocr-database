caption: Possible underlying mechanism of AR inhibitors in the treatment of PAH. Androgen
  receptor inhibitors inhibit the Notch3/Hes5 signaling pathway by suppressing androgen
  receptors within pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Some apoptosis-related molecules
  are regulated by this pathway, jointly upregulating the apoptosis level of PAECs,
  thereby resisting pathological changes such as the proliferation of PAECs caused
  by PAH (created in https://BioRender.com)
