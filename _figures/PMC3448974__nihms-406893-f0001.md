caption: A, in hormone-dependent ER+ breast cancer cells, estrogen (E2) activates
  ER-mediated transcription (genomic pathway) and nongenomic ER-mediated signaling.
  Under these conditions, the crosstalk from growth factor receptor signaling (i.e.,
  HER2/EGFR) to ER-mediated transcription is not prominent, hence lapatinib does not
  exert a growth inhibitory effect. B, upon acquisition of tamoxifen resistance or
  adaptation to hormone deprivation, HER2 and/or EGFR signaling to PI3K and ERK becomes
  amplified. These pathways, in turn, enhance ER-mediated transcription by post-translationally
  modifying the ER and its co-activators and co-repressors. In some cases (not illustrated
  here) amplification of these oncogenic signals results in ER downregulation and
  promotes hormone independence. In the study of Leary et al. discussed herein both
  MCF-7 cells that adapted to hormone deprivation, the equivalent to treatment with
  an aromatase inhibitor, and those that became resistant to tamoxifen were sensitive
  to lapatinib as long as estrogen was absent or tamoxifen was given concomitantly.
  In contrast, lapatinib was inactive against the hormone-dependent parental cells
  prior to selection. If we accept the MCF-7 model as one that is representative of
  the majority of ER+ hormone-dependent breast cancers, we would have to assume that
  lapatinib is only worth adding at the time of escape from primary endocrine therapy
  (as in B) and not early (as in A).
