caption: Most IGF-1 within the extracellular intravascular compartment is sequestered
  in a binary complex with IGFBP-3 or in a ternary complex with IGFBP-3 and an ALS.
  Proteases secreted by the prostate cancer cell cleave IGFBP-3, causing the release
  of IGF-1. Free IGF-1 can then bind IGF-1R, causing its autophosphorylation and activation.
  Mediated through the phosphorylation and activation of IRS-1 scaffold protein, two
  primary intracellular signaling pathways are then activated, the MAPK/ERK pathway
  and the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to cell cycle progression, cell proliferation,
  and cell survival. Apigenin can modulate this process by increasing both circulating
  and intracellular levels of IGFBP-3; decreasing circulating levels of IGF-1; inhibiting
  the secretion of proteases, such as PSA; inhibiting IGF-1R activation and downstream
  signaling; and inducing cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in prostate cancer
  cells.
