caption: 'High level of CXCL5 in tumor microenvironment promotes GC metastasis by
  enhancing GC cell migration and invasion through the induction of EMT. CXCL5 exerts
  these effects by two mechanisms: (1) CXCL5 directly activates ERK signaling pathway
  in GC cells to upregulate Snail expression; (2) CXCL5 induces pro-tumor activation
  of neutrophils via ERK and p38 signaling pathways, which leads to the release of
  increased levels of inflammatory factors (e.g, IL-6 and IL-23), subsequently enhancing
  the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells.'
