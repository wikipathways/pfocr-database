caption: Intracellular proteins (e.g. phosphorylated through signaling pathways or
  misfolded) are targeted for degradation by a covalently bound ubiquitin tag [].
  Ubiquitylation is catalyzed by a multi-enzymatic system consisting of E1 (ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme), E2 (conjugating) and E3 (ligases). The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent
  protease complex comprised of a 20S catalytic core (organized into four stacked
  rings of seven subunits each, i.e. α7β7β7α7) and two 19S regulatory caps. 19S caps
  are responsible for recognition of ubiquitinylated proteins (lid) and also contain
  ATPase activity (base) required for linearization of large proteins facilitating
  their entry in the catalytic core. Three β-subunits (β1, β2, β5) are responsible
  for the different enzymatic activities of the proteasome and are differentially
  inhibited by small molecule inhibitors such as bortezomib and salinosporamide A.
