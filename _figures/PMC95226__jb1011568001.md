caption: Proposed stereochemical control and a shunt pathway in the biosynthesis of
  ACT and dihydrogranaticin (DHGRA). Enzymes or putative enzyme complexes are indicated
  by capital letters, and their encoding genes are shown in parentheses. The early
  biosynthetic enzymes include a type II minimal PKS, KR, aromatase (ARO), and cyclase
  (CYC). The intermediates up to the bicyclic intermediate are tentatively shown as
  enzyme-bound (R-SCO-SEnz.). The numbering of carbon atoms is based on the biosynthetic
  origin. RED1 and RED2, first and second reductases.
