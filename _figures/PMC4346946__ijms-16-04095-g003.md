caption: DNA damage-induced molecular responses for DNA repair. In response to ionizing
  radiation, DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and chromatin relaxation surrounding DSB
  sites will occur. The MRN complex can sense and bind to DSB sites and quickly recruit
  ATM kinase for autophosphorylation and paraphosphorylation to various molecules,
  including NBS1 and Rad50 in the MRN complex. In addition, chromatin relaxation will
  activate PARP1 to execute PARylation on chromatin associated molecules and ATM kinase.
  Activated ATM needs to be maintained by acetylation via HAT Tip60, which is negatively
  regulated by the ATF2-Cul3 protein degradation pathway. Although c-Abl kinase can
  activate Tip60 at the DSB site, how DSB interacts with c-Abl is unclear. Additionally,
  whether MRN complex will regulate Tip60 to sustain ATM activity is unknown. ATM
  also regulates ATF2 activity, and it is likely to be an autoregulatory mechanism
  of ATM activity. Activated ATM can phosphorylate SMC1, NBS1, BRCA1, MDC1, 53BP1,
  and H2AX to localize DSB sites for further DSB repair mechanisms, including HRR
  and NHEJ.
