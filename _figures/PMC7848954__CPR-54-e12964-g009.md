caption: The proposed mechanism of 20‐HETE–induced alterations of mitochondrial dynamics
  in neurons. 20‐HETE is synthesized from AA by CYP4A, which is inhibited by HET0016.
  The altered mitochondrial dynamics induced by 20‐HETE activate oxidative stress
  and subsequently result in neuronal apoptosis mediated by inhibition of the SIRT1/PGC‐1α
  signalling pathway
