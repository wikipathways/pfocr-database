caption: Graphical abstract of this work. Decorin (DCN) was identified as the principal
  antifibrotic component within the ADSC secretome by combining transcriptomic and
  proteomic analyses. DCN bound with TGF-β1 and prevented it from binding to the TGF
  receptor, thereby blocking the downstream TGF-β/smad2 signaling pathway, ultimately
  reducing matrix deposition in fibroblasts and alleviating fibrosis
