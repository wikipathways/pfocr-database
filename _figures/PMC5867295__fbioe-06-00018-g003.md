caption: Overview of the canonical Ihh/PTHrP and Notch signaling pathways and newly
  acquired insights into their relation to the development of the osteoarthritic (OA)
  chondrocyte hypertrophic phenotype. The canonical pathway was updated with recent
  insights in the role of Ihh/PTHrP and Notch signaling in the hypertrophic switch
  occuring during OA development. In green pro-chondrogenic relations are shown, while
  pro-hypertrophic relations are depicted in red.
