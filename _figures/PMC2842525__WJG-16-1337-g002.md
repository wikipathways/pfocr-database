caption: IFN-α signal transduction. Binding of IFN-α to its cognate receptor on the
  cell surface results in activation of the Janus activated kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling
  pathway culminating in the production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many
  of which have anti-viral properties that act to limit HCV infection. Alcohol inhibits
  Y701, decreases interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity, and subsequently
  dampens the ISG response.
