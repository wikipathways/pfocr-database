  factors. Runx2 induces the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into
  preosteoblasts. Ihh is required for the expression of Runx2 in the perichondrium
  of endochondral bones. Runx2 induces Sp7 expression, and Runx2, Sp7, and canonical
  Wnt signaling induce the differentiation of preosteoblasts into immature osteoblasts.
  Runx2 and Sp7 are also involved in the maturation of osteoblasts. Runx2 regulates
  the proliferation of preosteoblasts by inducing Fgfr2 and Fgfr3. Runx2 expression
  and that of hedgehog, Fgf, and Wnt signaling pathway genes, and Sp7 are reciprocally
  regulated.
