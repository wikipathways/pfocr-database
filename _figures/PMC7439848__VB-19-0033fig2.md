caption: Multi-step T-cell extravasation across the BBB during heath and neuroinflammation.
  T-cell extravasation across subarachnoid venules during immune surveillance (A)
  or across BBB postcapillary venules during inflammation (B) is depicted. Leptomeningeal
  endothelial cells store P-selectin in Weibel-Palade bodies, however, in the absence
  of inflammation α4β1-mediated capture is the most observed first interaction. After
  GPCR-mediated shear-Figure 2 Continuedresistant arrest, T cells crawl against the
  direction of the flow and cross the BBB endothelium preferentially via the paracellular
  pathway. Pial cells are reported to partially cover the venular wall in the SAS
  (highlighted by the question mark), but do not seem to establish a barrier for T
  cell extravasation. In the absence of CNS antigens presented by subarachnoid macrophages
  and dendric cells on MHC-II molecules, T cells will not cross the glia limitans
  and may rather be flushed away with the CSF. During inflammation, leptomeningeal
  but also parenchymal BBB endothelial cells (B) allow for activated T-cell rolling,
  mediated by P-selectin which is de novo expressed as it is not stored in Weibel-Palade
  bodies. Inflammatory chemokines produced by astrocytes are transported from the
  abluminal to the luminal side of the BBB by ACKR1. After their GPCR-dependent arrest,
  T cells crawl on endothelial ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 against the direction of the flow
  with increased levels of endothelial ICAM-1 leading to increased transcellular T
  cell diapedesis. Once T cells have crossed the BBB endothelium (1), CNS-antigen-specific
  T cells may recognize their cognate antigens on perivascular APCs (2) and become
  reactivated behind the BBB. Matrix metalloproteinases produced by infiltrating and
  perivascular-activated myeloid cells as well as astrocytes cleave the astrocytic
  endfeet from the parenchymal basement membrane, allowing for T-cell passage, a process
  guided by proinflammatory chemokines produced by astrocytes. Once in the CNS parenchyma,
  T cells induce CNS damage and manifestation of clinical disease symptoms (3). Drawings
