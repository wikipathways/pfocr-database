caption: Proposed effects of calcitonin and MAP kinase pathways on CD44 expression
  in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Calcitonin (CT) binds to its receptor (CTR),
  which is coupled to the Gsα transduction protein. Gsα activity, mediated through
  cAMP, activates protein kinase A (PKA) [,]. PKA activates the MAPK kinase (MEK)-extracellular
  regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, that facilitates CD44 transcription. CT also induces
  splicing of CD44 to include v7-10, dependent on p38 but not on PKA. p38 may be induced
  by Exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). p38 could affect splicing machinery
  directly, through other downstream effectors, or by causing release of intracellular
  Ca2+.
