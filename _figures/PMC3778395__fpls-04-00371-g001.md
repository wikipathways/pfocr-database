caption: Scheme of the plant tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. The coloring highlights
  the redox regulation and targets of redox regulation in green and the involved enzymes
  in blue. Further post-translational regulations are indicated in gray, including
  the proteins involved. Solid lines refer to verified interactions and dotted lines
  to potential targets of thiol-based regulation. Further details and the abbreviations
  of the enzymes are given in the text.
