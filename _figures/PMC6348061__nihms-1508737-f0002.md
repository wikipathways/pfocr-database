caption: A simplified diagram of the acetylcholine (ACh)-signaling pathway in human
  lung cells. ACh is synthesized in the cytoplasm by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase
  (ChAT). In the absence of ChAT, an enzyme carnitine acetyltransferase (CarAT) synthesizes
  ACh from Choline by adding an acetyl group to it (from acetyl-CoA). The ACh is packaged
  into vesicles by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and exocytosed
  into the extracellular milieu. The ACh so released can bind back to its cognate
  receptors namely the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the muscarinic
  acetylcholine receptor in an autocrine (or paracrine) manner to recruit downstream
  cellular signaling pathways. The excess ACh is quickly hydrolyzed by the enzymes
  acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butrylcholinesterase (BuCHE) to generate choline.
  This choline is transported back in the cytoplasm by choline transporter 1 (ChT1).
  In the absence of ChT1 choline transporter like proteins (CTLP) 1–5 facilitate the
  uptake of choline back to the cytoplasm for another round of ACh synthesis. Polyspecific
  organic cations OCTs and OCTNs have the ability to transport ACh and choline bidirectionally
  in and out of the cell.
