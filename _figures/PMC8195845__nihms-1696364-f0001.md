caption: As depicted, it is proposed that potentiated skeletal muscle metaboreflex
  activity in diabetes is induced by the sensitization of TRPV1 in skeletal muscle
  afferents. Hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia increase insulin, AGE, and HMGB1.
  These substrates activate the PKC-TRPV1 pathway in sensory neurons. TRPV1 sensitization
  leads to an increase in Na+/Ca2+ influx, which induces action potential firing in
  the afferent fiber. The action potentials in muscle afferents are transduced via
  the DRG to the spinal cord and relayed to cardiovascular control areas in the brainstem
  which, in diabetes, evoke an abnormal BP response to exercise (i.e., TRPV1-induced
  metaboreflex overactivity). AGE, advanced glycation end products; DRG, dorsal root
  ganglion; IR, insulin receptor; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; PKC, protein kinase
  C; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; TRPV1, transient receptor
  potential vanilloid 1.
