caption: Alteration of tryptophan/kynurenine/indole metabolism as a function of inflammation,
  and dysregulation of lipid metabolism as a function of body mass index in hospitalized
  patients with and without COVID-19. In A, violin plot of tryptophan metabolism as
  a function of COVID status (median + range). Metabolic and clinical correlates to
  interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a marker of inflammation (B) and patient age (C) indicate
  a strong correlation of this pathway and lipid metabolism, especially free fatty
  acids (D) and acyl-carnitines (E), with disease state. Free fatty acids may derive
  from blood cell vesiculation and/or mobilization from brown adipose tissue, a process
  that could fuel viral membrane formation (F). In G, breakdown of free fatty acid
  levels as a function of patients’ body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 status. Lipidomics
  analyses of COVID-19-positive and -negative patients with BMI lower than 20 or higher
  than 38 revealed a significant impact of these variables on lipid class (H) and
  fatty acyl (I) composition.
