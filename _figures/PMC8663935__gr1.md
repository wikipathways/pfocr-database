caption: Overview of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Depending on upstream and downstream
  regulators of these networks' autophagy may be activated or inhibited. Growth factors
  (e.g., cytokines and hormones) induce PI3K/AKT signaling process by binding and
  activating the receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors. AKT phosphorylation
  by PDK1 can be modulated by either (PI3K Class I) and (PTEN) proteins, allowing
  it to become activated or inactivated, respectively. For instance, berberine inhibits
  PTEN expression that leads to increased AKT phosphorylation responsible for downstream
  phosphorylation of mTOR and consequent autophagy inhibition (). Aside from PDK1,
  mTORC2 also positively regulates AKT. When active, AKT can relieve the TSC1/2 complex
  towards Rheb to stimulate the kinase activity of mTORC1 and consequent promotion
  of protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. On the other hand, AMPK phosphorylates
  the TSC1/2 complex with consequent Rheb inhibition and mTORC1 activity lessening,
  which leads to the initiation of autophagy and lysosomes biogenesis. Aside from
  AKT and AMPK, ERK also represents a promising target for the regulation of mTORC1.
