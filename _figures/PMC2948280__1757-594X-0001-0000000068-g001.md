caption: (a) Under normal growth conditions, signal transduction downstream of growth
  factor receptors activates mTORC1 via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation of mTORC1
  promotes cell growth through the regulation of cap-dependent protein translation
  and the simultaneous inhibition of autophagy. Glutamine (Gln) is transported into
  cells via the SLC1A5 glutamine transporter and is subsequently used to import leucine
  (Leu) via the SLC7A5-SLC3A2 complex. Intracellular leucine activates mTORC1 Rag
  GTPases or a second undefined pathway. Basal autophagy is maintained under these
  conditions by the activity of Beclin-1, which is inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL also function to maintain viability by antagonizing
  Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis. (b) Under conditions of metabolic stress,
  including nutrient depletion (glucose and amino acid), growth factor withdrawal,
  or energy deficit, the mTOR pathway is inhibited, resulting in autophagy induction.
  Under conditions of glutamine depletion, the resulting decline in leucine import
  reduces amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1. Activation of the LKB1-AMPK pathway
  by energetic imbalance results in mTORC1 inhibition through activation of the TSC1-TSC2
  complex and inhibition of the mTOR-binding partner Raptor. Extended periods of nutrient
  withdrawal can induce mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through activation of caspases
  downstream of Bax/Bak-dependent cytochrome c (Cyt c) release. Antagonism of Bcl-2
  family members by BH3-only proteins may trigger either autophagy or apoptosis, depending
  on the context. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mito, mitochondrion; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase;
  TSC, tuberous sclerosis protein.
