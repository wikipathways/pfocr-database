caption: Functional protein interaction network of PLOD family genes. (A) Protein
  interaction network of 50 functional partners with confidence score > 0.9 based
  on STRING database. PLOD1, 2 and 3 are the seed genes. Ten interacting partners
  with the highest confident scores were colored and placed in the outer shell. The
  other forty interacting partners were grey and placed in the inner shell. The blue
  lines represent the correlation between proteins and the thickness of the lines
  indicates the strength of data support. (B) The bubble diagram displayed the enrichment
  results of the 50 functional interacting partners. The top 5 enriched categories
  for Biological Process, Cellular Component, Molecular Function and KEGG Pathway
  analysis were showed.
