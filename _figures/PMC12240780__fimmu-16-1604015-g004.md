caption: Role of LLPS in tumorigenesis due to FOs. FOs form functional condensates
  through LLPS, regulating transcription (A), chromatin remodeling (B), and signaling
  pathways (C, D) separately, thereby revealing the universality of LLPS as an oncogenic
  hub. (A) The LCD of FET FO drives LLPS, forms condensates to recruit RNA Pol II,
  and enhances fusion oncogene transcription, leading to sarcoma and leukemia. (B)
  SS18-SSX1 condensate readily excludes the HDAC1/2 complex, remodeling the genome
  structure, resulting in the aberrant accumulation of H3K27ac and overexpression
  of synovial sarcoma target genes. (C) EML4-ALK FO forms condensates through LLPS,
  locally concentrates the RAS activation complex GRB2/SOS1, and activates RAS and
  MAPK signaling pathways to promote lung carcinogenesis. (D) The condensate formed
  by PKA via LLPS has cAMP and PKA activities that regulate normal cellular activities.
  PKA FO associated with atypical hepatocellular carcinoma disrupts LLPS, impairs
  cAMP compartmentalization, aberrant cAMP signaling, and promotes cell proliferation
  and transformation. Figure created in BioRender. (2025) https://BioRender.com/a81u327
