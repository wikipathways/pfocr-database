caption: 'Retromobility pathways of bacterial group II introns. (A) Endonuclease-dependent
  pathway via dsDNA. Reaction steps are as follows: (1) reverse splicing into DNA
  target, (2) bottom strand cleavage by IEP endonuclease, (3 and 4) cDNA synthesis
  by IEP RT, represented by solid red line (5) removal of intron RNA (6) second strand
  cDNA synthesis, and (7) ligation. Stimulatory (green) and inhibitory (red) host
  functions are superimposed on the schematic, with an arrow pointing to their putative
  site of action (adapted from 181). (B) Endonuclease-independent pathway via ssDNA
  at the replication fork. Newly replicated DNA is represented by a gray line. Reaction
  step numbering corresponds to (A). These pathways are for retrohoming or retrotransposition
  in different intron/bacterial combinations as shown in the sidebar table. Global
  effectors that influence retromobility are listed in . Sidebar to Figure 3 legendPathwayIntronHostProcessALl.LtrBL.
