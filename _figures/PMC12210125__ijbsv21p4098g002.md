caption: Signaling pathways for the polarization of TAMs towards the M1 phenotype.
  a. Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. b. Activation of the STAT1/4 signaling
  pathways. The activation of the NF-κB and STAT1/4 signaling pathways in TAMs induces
  their polarization towards the M1 phenotype. c. Activation of the STING signaling
  pathway. MACRO deficiency in TAMs promotes M1 polarization by activating the P2X7R-mediated
  STING-IFN-β pathway. Concurrently, the genetic deletion of SAMHD1 in tumor cells
  enhances the activation of the FI16-STING pathway, which subsequently polarizes
  TAMs to the M1 phenotype. d. Activation of the Notch pathway. Jagged 2-/- lung tumor
  cells trigger Nr4a-mediated induction of the Notch ligands DLL1/4 in cancer cells.
  DLL1/4 activates Notch1/2 signaling in macrophages, leading to M1 TAM polarization
