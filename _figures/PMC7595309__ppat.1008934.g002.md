caption: Various HK receptors in Vibrio species recognize distinct signals produced
  by the bacterium (sensing “self”) and/or produced by host cells or neighboring bacteria
  (sensing “other”). The conservation of the HKs varies among species, and this figure
  indicates the proteins and signals determined in the literature for each species
  (V.h, Vibrio harveyi; V.c., Vibrio cholerae; V.p., Vibrio parahaemolyticus; V.f.,
  Vibrio fischeri). Signals produced by enzymes (if known) are indicated for each
  system. In the absence of cognate signals, phosphorylation (P) of LuxU and LuxO
  leads to production of AphA and low production of LuxR (V.h.)/HapR (V.c.)/OpaR (V.p.)/LitR
  (V.f.) and expression of biofilm, virulence, and type III secretion genes. In the
  presence of signals, dephosphorylation of LuxU drives production of LuxR/HapR/OpaR/LitR
  and expression of bioluminescence, proteases, and type VI secretion genes. The NO/H-NOX/HahK
  pathway in V.f. inhibits syp gene expression and biofilm formation. The VqmA/DPO
  pathway inhibits biofilm formation in V.c. AI-2, autoinducer-2; CAI-1, cholera autoinducer-1;
  CP, cytoplasm; DPO, 3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol; HAI-1, harveyi autoinducer-1; HK,
  histidine kinase; H-NOX, heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding; NO, nitric oxide; PP,
