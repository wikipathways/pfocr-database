caption: Following exposure to DNA damaging agents, the DDR signaling cascade is activated
  by sensor proteins such as MRN. Once damage is identified, ATM/ATR are recruited
  to the site of damage and undergo autophosphorylation resulting in activation. This
  subsequently results in the activation of H2AX by phosphorylation, triggering the
  accumulation of MDC1 to the site of damage. MDC1 accumulation promotes the recruitment
  of checkpoint proteins and the enhancement of the DDR. Concurrent with the DDR enhancement,
  ATM activates CHK2 which results in both the stabilization and accumulation of p53.
  Depending on the extent of damage several avenues can be followed including cell-cycle-recovery,
  apoptosis or the initiation of senescence.**A star indicates proposed targets to
  pro-senescence therapies
