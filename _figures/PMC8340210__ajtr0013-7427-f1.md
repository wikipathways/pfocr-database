caption: The DNA repair pathway and the mechanisms of PARP inhibitors. Internal and
  external stress regularly generates single strand breaks. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  1 (PARP1) recognizes these breaks, binds to the DNA, and recruits single strand
  break repair (SSBR) proteins. All clinical PARP inhibitors block the ability of
  PARP1 to recruit repair proteins. They can also have allosteric effects promoting
  retention (type 1), promoting some or no retention (type 2), and promoting release
  (type 3). Without the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, cells are unable to
  reconcile replication fork stalling or double strand breaks and rely on the more
  error prone non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Shown in the top right boxes
  are diagram of the domains of PARP1 and a list of direct and indirect members of
  the HR pathway that have been evaluated in clinical trials.
