caption: Relation between oxygen tension and reducing capacity in RBCs. A simplified
  scheme of glucose metabolism in the RBC (A), which proceeds through either the Embden-Meyerhof
  pathway (EMP, orange arrows), or the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP, blue arrows).
  Both share glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) as an initial substrate. HMP is the sole source
  of NADPH in RBCs and generates fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (G3P), which rejoin the EMP prior to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD),
  a key regulatory point in the EMP. The EMP generates NADH (utilized by metHb reductase),
  as well as ATP (to drive ion pumps) and 2,3-DPG (to modulate hemoglobin p50) (neither
  ATP or 2,3 DPG shown). Relative flux through the EMP and the HMP is modulated by
  O2-linked transitions in Hb conformation due to competitive binding for the cytoplasmic
  domain of Band 3 (cdB3) between deoxyHb and key EMP enzymes (PFK, Aldo, G3PD, PK,
  and LDH). In fully oxygenated RBCs (B), these EMP enzymes are inactivated by sequestration
  on cdB3, resulting in glucose being channelled through the HMP, maximizing NADPH
  (and thus GSH) recycling capacity. In deoxygenated RBCs (C), EMP enzymes are dispersed
  by deoxyHb binding to Band 3, creating competition for G6P as a substrate and thereby
  constraining recycling capacity for NADPH and GSH and limiting resilience to attack
  by ROS. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2−) are the principal endogenous
  ROS encountered by RBCs. Both ROS may be generated internally (not shown); however,
  only H2O2 can cross the membrane directly. O2− enters RBCs through Band 3 (anion
  exchange protein 1, or AE-1). H2O2 and O2− are ultimately reduced to water by catalase
  or glutathione peroxidase (GPx). CAT, catalase; GSH, glutathione; GR, glutathione
  reductase; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  Aldo, aldolase; PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
