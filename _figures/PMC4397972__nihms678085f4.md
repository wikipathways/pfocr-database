caption: Gene network analysis for 18 key genes involved in age-dependent tumor progression.
  Pathway analysis was done with IPA software. The network depicted contains a central
  node for TGFβ1 connected to the other 17 genes with direct (solid lines) and indirect
  (dashed lines) relationships to these molecules. Log2-fold changes to the gene expression
  were used to obtain shades of green for regulation levels for the downregulated
  (>1.2-fold) genes, whereas shades of red depict regulation levels for the upregulated
  (>1.2-fold) genes. Gray, genes that exist in the network without a significant 1.2-fold
  change under the perturbation investigated. The darker the shade of green or red,
  the greater the fold change.
