caption: 'Tumor microenvironment modulation through mTOR. mTOR inhibition induces
  memory cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTL) formation while reducing effector CTL
  function, critical for cellular antitumor response. In dendritic cells, lifespan
  and the expression of costimulatory molecules is increased upon mTOR suppression,
  leading to improved foreign-antigen recognition. On the other hand, metabolic NK-cell
  function, essential for antitumor response, is diminished upon mTOR inhibition.
  Myeloid derived stem cells (MDSC), regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAM), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) contribute to tumor immune-evasion
  and tumor growth. The immune-suppressive environment generated through MDSC is limited
  through mTOR blockage by restraining MDSC accumulation. Similarly, anti-inflammatory
  TAM may be skewed toward a more pro-inflammatory profile upon mTOR inhibition. CAF
  secrete various cytokines promoting tumor growth and therapy resistance, counteracted
  by mTOR blockage. In contrast, Tregs are preferentially differentiated upon mTOR
  downregulation. Within the majority of cancer cells, the PI3K–mTOR–AKT pathway is
  upregulated, driving PD-L1 expression maintaining an immune-suppressive state within
  the tumor microenvironment: a process that may be interrupted through mTOR inhibition.
  However, not all therapeutic targets of mTOR inhibition seem to be beneficial, such
  as reducing effector CTL function and T-Reg differentiation. Accordingly, rationale
  exists to combine anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 and mTOR inhibitors, alleviating
  reduced CTL effector function and Treg differentiation.'
