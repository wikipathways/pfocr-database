caption: Graphic model depicting the mechanism of NX-1607 in enhancing T-cell activation.
  The schematic demonstrates that NX-1607 inhibits Cbl-b, thereby lowering the activation
  threshold of TCR signaling. This results in increased T-cell activation via enhanced
  phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and subsequent activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. The
  outcome is a robust T-cell response, characterized by increased proliferation, elevated
  expression of CD69, and upregulation of IL2 and IFNG mRNA levels, alongside significantly
  enhanced antitumor activity. The image was created using BioRender.com, with permission.
