caption: SARS COV-2 virus can hyperactivate the various parts of adaptive immune system.An
  adaptive immune response can follow either a cellular or humoral pathway depending
  on the antigenic nature (intracellular versus extracellular), however, a disturbed
  and over-activated immune response may be counterproductive, causing autoimmune
  response. A. Th1 recognizes the peptides of SARS COV-2 and produces inflammatory
  cytokines, including MCP1, IFNλ, IL1B, IL8, andIL17.Also, Th1 produce large amounts
  of interferon IFNλ, which activates macrophages, resulting in delayed hypersensitivity. B. The
  Th17 subset responds to SARS COV-2 by producing cytokines, such as IL-17A, IL-17F,
  IL-21, and IL-22 and recruited neutrophils by T helper 17 cell can lead to autoimmunity
  reactions by excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation C. As a result of
  digestion of intracellular antigens, epitopes are usually delivered to CD8 + T lymphocytes,
  which ultimately act by way of a direct cytotoxic mechanism and produce inflammatory
  products such as Granzyme B, IFNλ, and TNF-alpha. D. Th2 lymphocytes cooperate with
  B cells in supporting the final maturation in plasma cells and the secretion of
  specific antiviral antibodies.
