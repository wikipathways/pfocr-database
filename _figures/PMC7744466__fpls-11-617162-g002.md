caption: 'Crosstalk between signaling pathway of BR (C, red), JA (A, yellow), UV-B
  (B, blue), and auxin (D, green). (A,C) BR and JA: BES1 restricts the production
  of defensin (antimicrobial proteins) by repressing the expression defensin genes,
  PDF1.2a and PDF1.2b. BES1 also negatively regulates the production of glucosinolates
  (GS) by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of MYC2, repressing GS biosynthesis
  transcription factors (MYBs) and genes (CYP79B3 and UGT74B1). (B,C) BR and UV-B:
  UV-B activated UVR8 and represses the function of BES1-BIM1 complexes to reduce
  the expression of BR induced genes to balance growth and stress (UVR8 dependent
  pathway). UV-B also reduces BES1 expression allowing the expression of MYB11, MYB12,
  and MYB111 transcription factors critical for flavonol biosynthesis (UVR8 independent
  pathway). (C,D) BR and auxin: BZR1 reduces the abundance of PILS protein (ER localized)
  resulting in auxin’s nuclear accumulation. BES1 increases the abundance of PIN7
  that involved in internal auxin flow in the embryo.'
