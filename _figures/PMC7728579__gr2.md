caption: Transsulfuration and H2S oxidation pathways. In the transsulfuration pathway
  (in orange), the enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystationine γ-ligase
  (CSE) use cysteine as a substrate for the synthesis of sulfides (H2S). The same
  cysteine is used by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) for the synthesis of GSH in
  the glutathione pathway (not shown). In the mitochondrial H2S oxidation (in red),
  sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) converts sulfide into thiosulfate by transferring
  two electrons from H2S to CoQ. Thiosulfate is then converted into sulfite by thiosulfate
  sulfurtransferase (TST) and persulfide dioxygenase (ETHE1), a reaction that requires
  glutathione (GSH) as an electron acceptor. Excess sulfite is converted into sulfate
  by sulfite oxidase (SUOX). 3-MP = 3-mercaptopyruvate, 3-MST = 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase, CoQ Ox = Coenzyme Q oxidized, CoQRed = Coenzyme Q reduced.
