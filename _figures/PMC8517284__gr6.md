caption: 'A schematic illustrating the mechanism underlying the renoprotective role
  of D3 in podocytes. Under normal conditions, D3 is transcribed in the nucleus, translated/modified
  in the ER and Golgi, and is primarily trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) of
  podocytes where it is highly expressed, and membrane bound. In response to injury,
  podocytes trigger an adaptive compensatory response which results in nuclear accumulation
  of D3. This allows for a rapid, localized deactivation of T3 in the nucleus where
  T3 receptors are abundant. In essence, due to the high energy demand of podocytes,
  we speculate that high levels of D3 activity is crucial to regulate energy homeostasis
  by dampening the cellular metabolism as a constructive process to promote energy
  conservation, thereby supporting essential functions that promote survival. However,
  the absence of D3 in injured podocytes leads to poor energy regulation and decreased
  ability to manage cellular stress, resulting in FP effacement, proteinuria, and
  glomerular disease. Another independent and parallel D3-mediated pathway leading
  to renoprotection in podocytes has been delineated. Interaction of D3 with αvβ3
  integrin functions as a second checkpoint to prevent activation of integrin-dependent
  pathways during hyperthyroidism. Further, over-expression of D3 reduces the systemic
  T3 levels and diminishes its cellular uptake. Therefore, D3 functions as a thyrostat
  on the surface of the podocytes; where its expression is finely tuned, both spatially
  and temporally, to offer renoprotection in a multi-pronged way. Presence of the
  TSH-R on podocyte surface and its activation following binding to TSH-R antibodies,
  as found in Graves’ disease, presents an additional arm that contributes to podocyte
  damage via a cascade of unknown events; demonstrating another evidence in favor
  of thyroid-kidney synergy. Mct8: Monocarboxylate transporter 8 and 10; OATP: organic
  anion transporting polypeptide C1.'
