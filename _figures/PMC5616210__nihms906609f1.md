caption: (a) Pathway for the synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA). The 1-position of
  sn-glycero-3-phosphate (G3P) is acylated by G3P acyltransferase (PlsB). The intermediate,
  1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (LPA) is then esterified by PlsC to form PA, the precursor
  to all membrane glycerophospholipids. (b) A schematic of the PlsC active site mechanism.
  The solid arrows show the first step of the reaction leading to a negatively charged
  oxygen atom in the transition state stabilized by the backbone amide of Lys105.
  The dotted arrows show the resolution of the transition state leading to acyl transfer.
