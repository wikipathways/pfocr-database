caption: Binding of ligands to CD36 leads to cell specific activation of signaling
  pathways and responses. (A) Binding of TSR containing ligands of CD36, such as thrombospondin-1,
  leads to a specific signaling cascade involving the src kinase fyn, caspases and
  p38 MAP kinase in endothelial cells. The outcome of this pathway is apoptosis of
  the endothelial cell and inhibition of angiogenesis. (B) Binding of fibrillar β-amyloid
  to CD36 in a complex with other proteins (including SRA, CD47 and the integrin α6β1)
  on microglial cells can lead to activation of several pathways. The outcome of these
  signaling cascades is an “activated” state as a result of reorganization of the
  actin cytoskeleton to confer phagocytic competency, secretion of ROS and cytokines.
  (C) On the macrophage, binding of modified LDL to CD36 leads to activation of the
  src kinase lyn, downstream activation of the MAP kinase kinase, MEKK2, and ultimately
  jnk phosphorylation, which is essential to modified LDL uptake and foam cell formation.
