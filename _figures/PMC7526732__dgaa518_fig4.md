caption: The network of “Cardiovascular Disease, Connective Tissue Development and
  Function, Organismal Injury and Abnormalities” was found to be significantly associated
  with DHEA-S based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes shown in red were significantly
  associated with DHEA-S level in blood. Intensity of the color reflects the level
  of significance. Genes shown in gray are the genes that were not significant or
  not included in the analysis but interact with at least 2 significant genes. DHEA-S,
  dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate.
