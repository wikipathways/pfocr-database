caption: Plausible pathway (in red) that hinders Rhizobium infection in D. ovatum.
  Moscatilin is utilised for phenanthrene synthesis to produce plant defensins that
  resist infection, thus playing the role of a phytoanticipin. The usual pathway of
  Moscatilin (stilbene) synthesis (in blue) is downregulated. Rhizobium infiltration
  also enhances the production of cyclopeptide, notably Lyciumin B, which functions
  as an antimicrobial
