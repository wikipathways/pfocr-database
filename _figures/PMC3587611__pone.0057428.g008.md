caption: '. (A) Dullard interacts with Dishevelled to influence the transduction of
  signals that regulate the expression of downstream genes including Dkk1 and Axin2.
  Dkk1 antagonizes WNT3 signalling activity by interacting with the Lrp5/6 co-receptor
  upstream of the signal transducing pathway involving Dishevelled. Dullard may interact
  with a repressor molecule that negatively regulates the expression of Wnt3, which
  signals through the β-catenin/Tcf dependent cascade (via a multi-step process: arrows)
  to activate Dkk1 expression. (B) Profiles of Wnt3 (agonist) and Dkk1 (antagonist)
  expression as well as overall signalling activity for PGC formation. The fine-tuning
  of WNT/β-catenin signalling activity by Dullard is crucial for PGC formation. Loss
  of Dullard function produced high Wnt3 activity (175% of the heterozygous level)
  that may be effectively nullified by higher Dkk1 activity (267%). This occurrence
  would lead to the overall reduced (low) WNT signalling activity that was accompanied
  by loss of PGCs. In the Dullard +/−; Wnt3 +/− embryo, moderate Wnt3 activity (52%
  of the heterozygous level: low) in the presence of lower (43%) Dkk1 activity may
  establish an overall intermediate level of WNT activity that permits the formation
  of a smaller number of PGCs (partly restored PGC numbers).'
