caption: 'Proposed sugar distribution mediated by glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase
  (GlmS) and glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB). (A) In the presence of sugar
  (glucose) and amino sugar (GlcNAc), both sugars are incorporated into the cytoplasm
  and are distributed to cell wall synthesis and glycolysis by GlmS and NagB; (B)
  In the presence of glucose as a sole carbohydrate source, NagB expression is significantly
  suppressed to generate enough GlcN-6P for the cell wall biosynthesis pathway; (C)
  In the presence of GlcNAc as a sole carbohydrate source, GlmS expression is significantly
  suppressed to generate enough Fru-6P for glycolysis pathway. GlcNAc: N-acetylglucosamine;
  GlcNAc-6P: N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate; GlcN-6P: glucosamine-6-phosphate; Fru-6P:
  fructose 6-phosphate; glucose-6P: glucose 6-phosphate; NagA: N-acetylglucosamine
  6-phosphate deacetylase; Pgi: glucose 6-phosphate isomerase.'
