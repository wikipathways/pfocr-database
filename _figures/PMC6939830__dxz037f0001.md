caption: Overview of the S1P-S1P receptor signaling system. (A) De novo sphingolipid
  metabolism starts at the endoplasmic reticulum where serine palmitoyltransferase
  condensates serine and palmitoyl-CoA to produce ceramide. Ceramide, generated either
  from the de novo pathway or from degradation of complex sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin
  and glycosphingolipids, is deacylated by ceramidase to sphingosine, followed by
  phosphorylation by sphingosine kinase 1/2 to produce S1P. S1P is dephosphorylated
  to sphingosine by S1P phosphatase or by lipid phosphate phosphatases, or is irreversibly
  degraded to phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal by S1P lyase. (B) S1P produced intracellularly
  is transported by specific transporters such as Mfsd2b [red blood cell (RBC) and
  platelet] and Spns2 (endothelial cells) and carried by albumin and HDL-associated
  specific S1P chaperone protein, ApoM. (C) S1P activates S1P receptors, S1P1-5, which
  transmit diverse intracellular signals depending on the coupled Gα subunits of heterotrimeric
  G protein and the expression pattern of each receptors in a given cell type. Modified
