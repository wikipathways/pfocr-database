caption: 'Obesity-altered adiponiche and tumour development: some novel proposed mechanisms
  in mature adipocytes and precursor cells. The adiponiche alterations present in
  patients with obesity could influence tumour biology and progression in different
  ways. We recently showed some pathways activated in mature adipocytes and in precursor
  cells that could be relevant in patients with obesity and cancer. In particular,
  in hypertrophic adipocytes (yellow cell on the left), CK2 potentiates insulin signalling
  and glucose uptake through the stimulation of PI3K/AKT pathway, GLUT4 translocation
  and PTEN inhibition. In addition, CK2 contributes also to IL-6, INF-γ and TNF-α
  signal transduction cascades, potentiating JAK/STAT and IKK/(NF)-кB signalling pathways,
  respectively. Moreover, CK2 is involved in regulating the production of adipokines
  in large adipocytes, leading to the downregulation of adiponectin and the upregulation
  of leptin. We showed that in the peritumoral AT of patients with EAC, leptin activates
  different signalling pathways in stromal stem cells (pink cell on the right). In
  particular, the activation of JAK2/STAT3, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK leads
  to the increased expression of factors involved in stemness (CD34, NSTM and OCT-4),
  the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (α-SMA), neo-angiogenesis (VEGF) and neo-lymphangiogenesis
  (VEGF-C). CK2: casein kinase 2; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; AKT: protein
  kinase B; GLUT4: glucose transporter type 4; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog;
