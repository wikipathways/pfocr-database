caption: 'A: Drosophila PCP pathway, showing the core PCP complexes of Fz–Dsh–Dgo
  and Stbm–Pk. Fmi is likely to be associated with both complexes. B: Vertebrate PCP
  pathway, showing additional components (PTK7 and Scribble) in PCP regulation in
  mice. The proposed interactions among the vertebrate PCP components are based on
  available data (see text). The association of Scrb1 with mCelsr1 is based on the
  ubiquitous localization of Scrb1 to apical cell membranes in the organ of Corti.
  The role of mouse Ankrd6, Pk and Dvl3 in PCP has not been demonstrated, and the
  role of Wnts in establishing epithelial PCP has yet to be tested.'
