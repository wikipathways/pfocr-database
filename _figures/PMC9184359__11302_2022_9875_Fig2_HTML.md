caption: P2 purinergic receptors in normal kidney function and disease. Activation
  of P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2X4 contributes to blood pressure maintenance. Ischemia and
  reperfusion result in increased extracellular nucleotides. Activation of P2X4, P2X7,
  and P2Y14 initiates signaling cascades that promote chemokine induction, renal tubule
  necrosis and apoptosis, and neutrophil infiltration contributing to acute kidney
  injury. P2X7 activation contributes to chronic kidney disease pathogenesis via the
  NLRP3 inflammasome, while P2Y2 is protective against the same disease. P2X7 activation
  might also affect cystogenesis via the ERK1/2 pathway culminating in polycystic
  disease, a risk factor for kidney cancer. P2X6 activation increases kidney cancer
  cell invasiveness via ERK1/2 and MMP9 signaling
