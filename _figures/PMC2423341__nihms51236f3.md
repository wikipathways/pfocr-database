caption: Inhibition of neuronal activity or blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors
  in the LPB reverses skin cooling-evoked thermogenic, metabolic and cardiac responses.
  (a) Skin cooling-evoked changes in BAT SNA, BAT temperature (TBAT), expired (Exp.)
  CO2, heart rate (HR), arterial pressure (AP), Trec, and Tbrain before and after
  bilateral nanoinjections of muscimol into the LPB (pink dashed lines). The gray
  area is expanded in d. The vertical scale bar for the BAT SNA trace represents 100
  μV. (b) Composite drawing of sites of saline, muscimol (2 mM) or AP5/CNQX (5 mM
  each) nanoinjections (60 nl) in and around the LPB with their inhibitory effects
  on the skin cooling-evoked increase in BAT SNA or EMG. The right side of the symmetric
  bilateral injections is shown. (c–e) Effect of bilateral nanoinjections of saline
  (c), muscimol (d) and AP5/CNQX (e) into the LPB on skin cooling-evoked changes in
  physiological variables. The vertical scale bar for the BAT SNA trace represents
  200 μV (c), 100 μV (d) and 50 μV (e). (f) Skin cooling-evoked changes in EMG before
  and after bilateral nanoinjections of AP5/CNQX into the LPB (orange dashed lines).
  The vertical scale bar for the EMG trace represents 400 μV. g, Representative view
  of a nanoinjection site in the LPBel as identified with a cluster of fluorescent
  beads (arrow). Scale bar, 0.5 mm. (h,i) Group data (mean ± s.e.m.) showing the effect
  of saline (n = 5), muscimol (n = 7) or AP5/CNQX (n = 8) nanoinjections into the
  LPBel on skin cooling-evoked changes in BAT SNA, TBAT, Exp. CO2, HR and MAP (h)
  and the effect of saline (n = 4) and AP5/CNQX (n = 5) nanoinjections into the LPBel
  on skin cooling-evoked changes in EMG (i) (see c–f). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P
  < 0.001, compared with the saline-injected group (Bonferroni post hoc test following
  a one-way factorial ANOVA).
