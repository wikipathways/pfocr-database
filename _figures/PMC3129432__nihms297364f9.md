caption: 'Precursor pools (Acetyl-CoA, S2, etc) are represented by circles and connected
  by arrows. E: Enzymes are followed by a number that refers to the position in the
  pathway (enzyme numbers are as in ). Regulatory factors are affecting both precursor
  pool sizes and enzymatic activities (e.g., AS-C: allatostatin C).'
