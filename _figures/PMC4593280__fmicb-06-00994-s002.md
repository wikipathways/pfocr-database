caption: Energy diagram for PMF-dependent electrolithoautotrophic carbon fixation
  in A. ferrooxidans. A. ferrooxidans cell extracts electrons directly from solid
  electron sources such as conductive minerals and electrodes at a potential of +0.82
  V vs. SHE. Electrons are used for O2 reduction via a down-hill pathway, which in
  turn generates PMF that is used to elevate the energy of electrons to reduce NAD+
  to NADH, therefore triggering Calvin cycle. From the energy difference between the
  input electron and the midpoint potential of NAD+/NADH redox at cytoplasmic pH,
  it is estimated that A. ferrooxidans elevates the energy of electrons using PMF
  by 1.14 eV.
