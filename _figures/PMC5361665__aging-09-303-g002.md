caption: 'Schematic showing the pertinent findings reported in by Aznar et al. [].
  Top (from left to right): In normal physiologic states, sheets of polarized epithelial
  cells maintain barrier integrity by assembling tight junctions TJs; stained here
  with the TJ-marker and integral membrane protein, Occludin in green. Exposure to
  energetic stress triggers the activation of AMPK, a sensor of cellular energy stores,
  which in turn phosphorylates GIV at Ser245. Phospho-GIV [stained red] localizes
  to the TJs [marked with occluding] and serves to stabilize TJs and resist stress-induced
  collapse. Bottom: Schematic summarizing how the AMPK-GIV signaling axis preserves
  TJ integrity via multiple interacting partners of the polarity scaffold, GIV, and
  how this stress-polarity pathway enhances barrier functions and inhibits neoplastic
  transformation.'
