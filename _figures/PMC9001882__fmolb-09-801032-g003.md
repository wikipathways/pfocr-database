caption: Dynamic pathway regulation scheme for the naringenin pathway. The target
  metabolite naringenin is produced from L-tyrosine in four enzymatic steps, including
  a merging step catalysed by the enzyme naringenin chalcone synthase (CHS) which
  incorporates the secondary metabolite malonyl-CoA. The production level of naringenin
  is readout using a metabolic extended TF-based biosensor through the downstream
  metabolite kaempferol. This is sensed using the QdoR TF-based biosensor and feeds
  back to an antithetic biomolecular controller. The controller can be activated upstream
  by means of the external inducer AHL. Its actuating signal overdrives the basal
  constitutive expression of the CHS enzyme in the pathway in order to compensate
  for malonyl-CoA depletion.
