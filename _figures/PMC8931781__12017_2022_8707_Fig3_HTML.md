caption: The regulatory action of AKBA on the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. 1. HO-1
  catalyzes the degradation of hemoglobin to carbon monoxide, free ferrous iron and
  biliverdin, subsequently degrading biliverdin to bilirubin (Fig. 3.①); these products
  are considered to have an important role in anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation.
  2. HO-1 inhibits the production of Cx43 (Fig. 3.②) and TNF-α (Fig. 3.③) to reduce
  the inflammatory response. 3. ROS is one of the major leading factors in the development
  and progression of many cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, HO-1 inhibits
  ROS (Fig. 3.④)
