caption: ONC201 appears to up-regulate ATF4 translation through a mechanism involving
  μORFs of the ATF4 gene that partially resembles that used by the classical ISR and
  UPR. However, ONC201-induced ATF4 up-regulation does not require an increase in
  the phosphorylation of eIF2a, indicating a mechanism of action of ONC201 that indirectly
  activates this pathway. ONC201-induced ATF4 serves as an apoptosis-promoting factor
  that also inhibits mTORC1 activity. ONC201 also reduces MCL-1 protein abundance,
  causing synergistic effects with the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. AA, amino acids; dsRNA,
  double-stranded RNA.
