caption: Overview of compartmentalized sphingosine 1‐phosphate (S1P) metabolism and
  inside–out signalling. S1P can be produced from de novo biosynthesis or from the
  salvage pathway of sphingolipid metabolism. In de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis,
  the condensation of serine and palmitoyl‐CoA at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) generates
  ceramide (Cer), which can be converted to sphingosine (Sph) and then phosphorylated
  to S1P by sphingosine kinases (SPHKs). Ceramide can also be transported to Golgi
  to generate ceramide 1‐phosphate (C1P), sphingomyelin (SM) or glucosylceramide (GSL).
  In the salvage pathway, ceramide is generated through degradation of SM or GSL before
  converting to Sph and subsequently S1P, which occurs primarily in the lysosome.
  SPHK1 catalyses phosphorylation of Sph mainly at the cell plasma membrane (PM),
  and its translocation from the nucleus to the PM is driven by agonists through an
  extracellular signal‐related kinase (ERK) and Ca2+‐dependent SPHK1 phosphorylation.
  SPHK2 functions at the nucleus, ER and mitochondria, and its nuclear export depends
  on phorbol 12‐myristate 13‐acetate (PMA) and protein kinase D (PKD)‐mediated SPHK2
  phosphorylation. The nuclear export of both SPHK1 and SPHK2 also depends on chromosomal
  region maintenance 1 (CRM1). Intracellular S1P is eventually degraded by either
  S1P lyase (SPL) or S1P phosphatases (SPPs). Extracellular S1P is dephosphorylated
  to sphingosine by lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) localized at the PM. S1P induces
  a series of signalling pathways by activating S1P receptors after being exported
  outside cells by transporters, or by directly binding with intracellular protein
  targets.
