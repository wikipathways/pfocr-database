caption: Dopamine signaling canonical pathway. Canonical pathway of dopamine signaling
  and neurotransmission derived from the IPA analysis. Increased expression of dopamine
  synthesis rate-limiting enzyme (TH) and decrease in expression of MAO in the presynaptic
  neuron may result in enhanced dopaminergic activity. This may lead to increased
  activity of D2 dopamine receptors, and compensatory downregulation of D2 receptors
  downstream targets. Differential protein expression is denoted as red (significantly
  upregulated), green (significantly downregulated), orange (software predicted upregulation),
  blue (software predicted downregulation). The intensity of color indicated the magnitude
  of change. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
