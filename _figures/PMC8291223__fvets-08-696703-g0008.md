caption: Effects of high-grain diet with buffering agent on the milk protein synthesis.
  Feeding of high-grain diet with buffering agent promoted the jugular vein blood
  of amino acids concentration, and the mRNA expressions of amino acid transport SLC1A3,
  SLC1A5, SLC7A5, SLC7A6, and SLC38A2 in mammary tissues were up-regulated, it showed
  that more amino acids flowed into the mammary. Amino acids in mammary gland activated
  mTOR pathway. mTORC1 activates P70S6K via phosphorylation, which in turn activated
  several proteins that contributed to promote protein synthesis. In addition, activation
  of P70S6K inhibited eEF2K via phosphorylation, subsequently stimulated eEF2, which
  activated translocation elongation. When mTORC1 was phosphorylated, it inhibited
  4EBP1 through phosphorylation, which inhibits eIF4E. eIF4E activates cap-dependent
  translocation increasing protein synthesis. The blue arrow represents promotion,
  and the red arrow represents inhibition.
