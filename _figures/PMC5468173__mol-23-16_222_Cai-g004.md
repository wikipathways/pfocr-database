caption: An illustration of potential mechanisms in injury-induced vascular intimal
  hyperplasia is depicted. We propose that IH is driven, in part, by TLR4 -MyD88 signaling
  on macrophages and cathepsin L pathway responding to injured and stressed cells
  in the vessel wall. SQV can be a potential therapeutic drug to inhibit cathepsin
  L activity and IH. For detailed discussion of the pathways, please see the text.
