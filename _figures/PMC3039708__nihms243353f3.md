caption: APCs (light blue) take up antigens (red circles) released from tumor cells
  and present them to T cells (pink) in the context of B7-1 and B7-2 costimulation.
  Tumor cells (orange) can also present tumor antigens to T cells in the absence of
  costimulation. Upon T cell activation, CTLA-4 and PD-1 are expressed and inhibit
  immune responses. Therefore, specific blockade of CTLA-4, leaving TCR and CD28 signaling
  intact, enhances antitumor immunity. Blockade of CTLA-4 on Tregs (blue) might also
  reduce Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Immune cells infiltrating prostate cancer
  have enhanced expression of PD-L1 and PD-1. Therefore immunotherapies blocking the
  PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are being tested. Finally, both B7x and B7-H3 inhibit T cell
  functions and are overexpressed by many human cancers including prostate cancer.
  Consequently, blockade of tumor associated B7-H3 and B7x could be another attractive
  approach in tumor immunotherapy.
