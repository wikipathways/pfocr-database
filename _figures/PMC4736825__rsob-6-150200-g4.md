caption: Model of translational repression of Nodal pathway components. (a) In early
  zebrafish embryos, Ybx1 represses squint/nodal translation by binding to the translation
  pre-initiation complex proteins and the squint DLE (solid blue box). Squint/Nodal
  translation is activated from late blastula stages by unknown factors. (b) In vegetal
  cells of frog embryos, Bic-C represses xCR1 translation by binding to the translation
  pre-initiation complex proteins and the xCR1 TCE (solid green box). In animal cap
  cells, xCR1 translation is activated in the absence of Bic-C. (c) miRNA-378a-5p
  (black comb) binds to the 3′-UTR (solid red box) of human Nodal RNA and unknown
  factors (?) to repress Nodal translation in the human placenta. In the absence of
  miRNA-378a-5p, nodal translation is activated.

    In early zebrafish embryos, Ybx1 represses squint/nodal translation by binding

    by binding to the translation pre-initiation complex proteins and the xCR1 TCE

    of Bic-C. (c) miRNA-378a-5p (black comb) binds to the 3′-UTR (solid red box) of
    human Nodal RNA and unknown factors (?) to repress Nodal translation in the human
    placenta. In the absence of miRNA-378a-5p, nodal translation is activated.
