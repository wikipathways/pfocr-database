caption: The amyloidogenic processing (AP) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) holoprotein.
  In this pathway β-secretase/BACE1 and γ-secretase sequentially cleave APP holoprotein
  yielding several Aβ peptide isoforms. The two most prevalent Aβ isoforms are the
  40- and 42-amino acid-long residues, the length of which is determined by the cleavage
  site of the γ-secretase. Under physiological conditions the synthesis of monomeric
  neurotrophic Aβ peptides is very limited. However, when over produced Aβ peptide
  monomers end up aggregating first into soluble oligomers (Aβ-os), the first Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD) drivers, next into insoluble fibrils, and eventually into senile plaques.
  The latter can both take up and release the neurotoxic Aβ-os. The Aβ42 isoform is
  the main component of senile plaques as is it highly prone to oligomeric and polymeric
  (fibrillar) aggregation. The Aβ-os interact with several nerve cell membrane receptors,
  including the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Notably, CaSR-bound Aβ-os trigger
  a complex set of intracellular signals that promote the development and progression
  of AD neuropathology (see  for further details).
