caption: Schematic signaling pathway of nutrient sensing, G−protein coupled receptors.
  Ligands (grey triangle) bind to nutrient−sensing receptors and coupled G−proteins
  to activate PLCβ2. IP3 is activated by PLCβ2 and binds to IP3 receptors to cause
  intracellular Ca2+ release (red arrow), which drives the opening of the TRPM5 cation
  channel and Na+ influx (dark yellow arrow). These changes lead to increased incretin
  and cytokine secretion by enteroendocrine cells. These molecules could have an influence
  on the gene and protein expressions, various cytokine and hormone secretion, and
  modified cell proliferation of target cells
