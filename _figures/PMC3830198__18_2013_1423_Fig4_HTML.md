caption: Model showing the proposed mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated regulation of the
  RB pathway. pRB binds target transcription factors such as E2F and inhibits their
  activity in the G1 phase. Cyclin Ds-CDK4/6 phosphorylate pRB and activate E2F-mediated
  transcription in late G1, which regulates the expression of several growth-promoting
  genes and S phase entry. The transcription of H19 lncRNA from the H19 locus is mediated
  by E2F1. H19 lncRNA is processed to generate miR-675, which binds to RB mRNA and
  inhibits its translation
