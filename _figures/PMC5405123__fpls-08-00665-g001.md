  (Arabidopsis) The photoperiodic flowering pathway can be simplified into a linear
  cascade comprising the GI and FKF1 protein complex, targeting CDFs transcriptional
  repressors for proteasome-mediated degradation. Released CO transcription leads
  to CO protein accumulation during the evenings of LD and induction of FT expression.
  Among the CDFs, CDF1 at least can associate directly with FT to repress its expression.
  (Rice) OsFKF1 and OsGI promote flowering via transcriptional regulation of distinct
  target genes. However, their protein products can also interact. The Ehd1 and Hd1
  proteins promote flowering by activating Hd3a and RFT1 expression under SD. However,
  under LD, Hd1 switches its function to repress Hd3a transcription. Hd3a transcription
  is sensitive to induction mediated by Ehd1 under both LD and SD, to the extent that
  ehd1 rft1 double mutants cannot flower. Conversely, transcription of RFT1 can be
  activated also under LD, by an unknown mechanism that eventually allows flowering
  also under unfavorable conditions. (Sorghum) The SbPhyB protein (Ma3) represses
  flowering by promoting expression of SbGhd7 (Ma6) and SbPRR37 under LD. The coincidence
  between SbPRR37 and Ma1 is under debate. However, sorghum lines bearing ma3 recessive
  mutations can flower early also under SD. The SbCO protein is a constitutive activator
  of flowering, differently from rice Hd1. SbPRR37 can promote SbCO transcription
  at dawn. (Maize) A higher degree of polygenic control of flowering has been observed
  in maize compared to other species. However, homologs of flowering genes have been
  cloned and some mutants characterized. In this diagram, we speculate about the existence
  of an Ehd1-like function, possibly creating a topology similar to that of other
  SD species. Major discrete regulators are encoded by ID1 and ZmCCT. (Temperate cereals)
  Exposure to cold is necessary to reduce VRN2 levels in leaves. Vernalized plants
  can respond to LDs that promote expression of VRN3/FT via CO homologs and, most
  importantly, through PPD1, encoding a CCT-domain protein similar to PRR37. Arrows
  indicate transcriptional activation; flat-end arrows indicate transcriptional repression.
  Dashed lines indicate that the protein products can interact. Question marks are
  speculative, and indicate the possible existence of unknown factors with specific
  functions on gene expression. LD, long day; SD, short day.
