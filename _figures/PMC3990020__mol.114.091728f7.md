caption: Proposed mechanism. In SH-SY5Y cells, morphine inhibition of EAAT3 via the
  μ-opioid receptor is mediated by MAPK and PKA signaling via Gαi/o and Gαs. Activation
  of the μ-opioid receptor can also lead to glutamate transporter regulator 3-18 activation
  (; ), which reduces the level of EAAT3 surface expression. PKA pathways can activate
  transcriptional factors, such as CREB, but can also activate the PTEN/ubiquitin/Nedd4
  pathway, which promotes degradation of EAAT3. Further, the PKA and ERK pathway can
  also mediate phosphorylation of EAAT3, which can affect surface expression and/or
  EAAT3 activity directly. Thus, morphine treatment reduces GSH/GSSG and SAM/SAH ratios,
  leading to epigenetic changes subsequently affecting transcription. CREB, cAMP response
  element-binding; DNMT, DNA methyl transferase enzyme; Nedd4, neural precursor cell
  expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; TFs, transcription factors.
