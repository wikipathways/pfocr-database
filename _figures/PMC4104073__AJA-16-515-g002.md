caption: 'Splicing regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) signaling pathways. Members of the pathway whose transcripts are alternatively
  spliced in cancer are indicated with green decagons. Splice factors Sam68, SRSF1,
  and SRs as well as their regulators (SRPKs) that are altered in cancer transcriptionally
  or post-transcriptionally are marked with green ovals. Dark green indicates that
  altered function of a splice isoform or a splice factor has been observed in prostate
  cancer whereas light green–in other cancers. SRs: splice factors of the serine/arginine-rich
  protein family; SRPKs: SR protein kinases; p: phosphorylation; AS: alternative splicing.
  The signaling pathways of AR and PI3K have been adapted from Barlow and Shen. *Pathway
  components for which new blocking agents are under investigation for advanced prostate
  cancer.'
