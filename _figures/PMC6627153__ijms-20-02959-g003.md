caption: PCOS–disease subnetwork 8. This subnetwork showed shared proteins and shared
  pathway (long-term potentiation) between PCOS and ovarian cancer. Different coloring
  of nodes and lines represents PCOS-related proteins (red), shared proteins (orange),
  PCOS–disease interactions (blue), and protein–pathway interactions (green). Shape
  of nodes denotes PCOS-related proteins (circle), disease (triangle), and pathway
  (square).
