caption: 'Network of the Insulin/TOR, autophagy, endocytosis, and Notch pathways.
  The Insulin/TOR pathway (a) normally inhibits the autophagic machinery (b). Notch
  signaling is induced by ligand (DSL) binding to the receptor and the cleaved NICD
  activates target gene expression (c). Alternatively, Notch can be activated ligand
  independently through receptor endocytosis ((d)2)), or the endocytosed receptor
  can be degraded to silence the signal ((d)1)). Connections of the pathways are shown
  between molecules directly or between molecules and the pathway in general (shaded
  areas). Bar-headed arrows indicate inhibition, arrows indicate activation. For simplicity,
  the trafficking routes are reduced to the processes and players discussed in the
  text. Numbers [] refer to publications cited in the text. Dark filled circles indicate
  drugs, whereas proteins are represented with white circles. RTK: receptor tyrosine
  kinase, RESV: resveratrol.'
