caption: Schematic illustration of proposed model illustrating that Al-induced, STOP1-independent
  NO-signaling pathway and Al-activated STOP1 signaling cascades regulate PGIP1 expression
  under Al stress. TRX SF, R-R MYB, and NAC027 were identified by eGWAS for PGIP1
  expression levels under Al stress in the shoots of A. thaliana. The colors green
  and purple represent the previously known Al signaling pathways and newly discovered
  genes in this study, respectively.
