caption: Schematic of TGFβ1 signaling pathway and its regulation. TGFβ1 is secreted
  and sequestered in the extracellular matrix as a biologically inactive complex composed
  of the TGFβ1 peptide linked to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) and a member
  of the latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP) family. Activation of latent TGFβ1 allows
  binding of active peptide dimer to TβRII and formation of a heterotetrameric receptor
  complex Between TβRI and TβRII. Coreceptors such as betaglycan act to enhance TGFβ
  binding to its receptors. TβRII, phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of TβRI and
  activates its serine-threonine kinase activity towards the R-Smads, Smad2, or Smad3,
  Phosphorylation of an R-Smad for allows complex formation with Smad4 and translocation
  to the nucleus, where binding to SBE target sites in gene promoters activates transcription
  with many other cofactors. Dephosphorylation of R-Smads by Smad phosphatases such
  as PPM1A attenuate signaling and cause Smads to recycle to the cytoplasm. Smad7
  can block type I receptor phosphorylation of R-Smads and in conjunction with E3
  ubiquitin ligases such as Smurf1 cause polyubiquitination and degradation of TβRI.
  Smurf1 and similar proteins have also been implicated in degradation of R-Smads.
