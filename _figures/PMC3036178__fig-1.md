caption: Lymphotoxin and the immediate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. The TNF
  family ligands bind their cognate receptors as soluble and/or cell-associated trimers,
  shown by the arrows. LTα1β2 and LIGHT bind the LTβR, recruiting TNF receptor–associated
  factor (TRAF) adaptors to the receptor and resulting in the liberation/stabilization
  of NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK then activates IKKα and the downstream noncanonical
  NFκB signaling pathway. Studies indicate that LTαβ-LTβR and NIK-dependent signaling
  contributes to initial interferon (IFN)-αβ production by splenic stromal cells during
  mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection.
