caption: 'Gene interaction network of dyslexia and stress-associated genes. Target
  genesare shown in the inner circle, while genes associated with the query genes
  are shown in the outer one. The left panel presents the different types of interactions
  with respective color coding, depicted with lines connecting genes in the network:
  physical interactions (pink), predicted (orange), co-expression (purple), genetic
  interaction (green) and shared protein domains (yellow). The right panel presents
  gene functions, represented with colored strips within the respective genes: hormone-mediated
  signaling pathway (red), cellular response to steroid hormone stimulus (green) and
  steroid hormone-mediated signaling pathway (blue), cilium assembly (orange) and
  response to steroid hormone (purple)'
