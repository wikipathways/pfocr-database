caption: 'New era for migraine: Inflammasome activation as a treatment target or a
  biomarker. In the background of genetically hyperexcitable brain, triggering factors
  induce CSD which results in Pannexin-1 megachannel opening and K+ efflux from P2X7R,
  consequently creates stress on the cell. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) from membranous
  Arachidonic acid (AA) and mitochondria respond to this cellular stress via mtROS
  production which is sensed by mtDNA and TXNIP. K+ efflux, mtDNA and Pannexin-1 megachannel
  opening cause the assembly of inflammasome complex elements (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1)
  and activation of caspase-1 which cleaves pro forms of IL-1β and IL-18 and ignites
  parenchymal neuroinflammatory signaling to alert adjacent cells. This cascade eventually
  reaches the trigeminovascular system around meningeal vessels which results in activation
  of this system and consequently headache. COVID-19 viroporins induce NLRP3 inflammasome
  formation via increase in mitochondrial ROS production. This may be an overlapping
  mechanism in migraine and COVID-19 headache. On the contrary, ACh, main actor in
  cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome by decreasing
  mtDNA release through binding to mitochondrial α7 nAChR'
