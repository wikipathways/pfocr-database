caption: On-target, on-demand redox signaling enabled by T-REX. Bubbles indicate experimental
  steps described in the protocol. Either E. coli or mammalian cells expressing HaloTag-fused
  proteins of interest (POIs) are treated with designated photocaged precursors (5–25
  µM, 2 h) to achieve a 1:1 covalent binding between the HaloTag and the photocaged
  probe. After rinsing cycles, exposure of the cells (for 3–20 min) to low-energy
  light (0.3 mW/cm2, 365 nm) at room temperature elicits rapid liberation of a reactive
  signal (lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs), inset) from the photocaged probe bound
  to HaloTag. Proximity enhancement facilitates on-target, on-demand covalent modification
  of amino acid residue(s) on the POIs, typically cysteines. HNE is also known to
  be capable of modifying lysine and histidine (see text). Regardless of residue specificity,
  T-REX is able to ping one potential responsive protein with a precision dose of
  reactive lipid. Irrespective of residue identity, in-gel fluorescence analysis reports
  on the presence of HNE modification on the POIs. Residue specificity in POI modification
  is determined by LC–MS/MS analysis post cell lysis and resin-assisted enrichment
  (). Once a specific sensor protein has been earmarked by T-REX, target- and residue(s)-specific
  post-translational modification can be directly linked to the signaling function
  of interest in an otherwise unperturbed cellular background. T-REX can (i) interrogate
  specific redox-linked signaling responses and (ii) discover novel regulators that
  upon selective lipidation are sufficient to elicit a biologically relevant response.
  Generality and scope in terms of both target and signal specificity are exemplified
  with distinct vertebrate sensor proteins (e.g., Keap1, RRM1, HSPB7) and structurally
  distinct LDEs (inset). Pathway activation is analyzed using dual-luciferase reporter
  assays or GFP reporter assays by flow cytometry. Endogenous downstream gene activation
  can be analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting.
