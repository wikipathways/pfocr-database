caption: a In the extrinsic pathways, death receptor ligands bind to members of the
  death receptor family to function, for instance, TNF, FAS, and TRAIL receptors.
  Numerous diverse stressors, such as DNA damage, the removal of growth factors, and
  mitotic arrest, activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which in turn activates
  BH3-only members. By activating the effector proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bax and
  Bak and inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, BH3-only proteins cause MOMP. In
  particular, cyt c is activated by releasing proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane
  gap. The heptameric structure known as the apoptosome is created when cyt c interacts
  with APAF1. As a result, caspase-9 is recruited and activated, which cleaves and
  activates caspase-3 and -7. The caspase inhibitor XIAP is blocked by proteins such
  as SMAC, which are released due to MOMP, promoting apoptosis. The extrinsic and
  intrinsic apoptotic pathways are linked via caspase-8 cleavage and activation of
  the BH3-only protein Bid. b In normal cases, Bax localizes to the cytoplasm and
  Bak to the mitochondria. By interacting with BH3-only proteins, Bax and Bak can
  be directly activated during apoptosis, which leads to their stabilization on the
  OMM. Their dimer further oligomerizes into a higher-order multimer, contributing
  to the release of cyt c and other IMS proteins. Over time, Bax and Bak accumulate
  with macropore formation, which allows the IMM to protrude through the OMM, after
  which the IMM herniates and ruptures, eventually releasing mtDNA. TNF Tumor Necrosis
