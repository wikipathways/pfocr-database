caption: Antioxidant mechanism of itaconate and its derivatives. Itaconate and its
  derivatives decrease ROS levels via SDH inhibition and induction of the antioxidant
  response via activation of the Nrf2 signalling pathway. Moreover, they also increase
  the expression of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) and the ATF3-driven stress
  response in macrophages to diminish pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and
  mitochondrial stress.
