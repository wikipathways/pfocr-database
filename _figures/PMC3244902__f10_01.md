caption: 'Trp catabolism. Only the first enzymes involved in several secondary metabolism
  pathways derived from Trp are indicated. The numbers within the Trp catabolism pathway
  indicate: 1) the indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) pathway catalyzed by two cytochrome
  P450s (CYP79B2 and CYP79B3); 2) the tryptamine (YUCCA) pathway catalyzed by Trp
  decarboxylase (TDC); 3) the indole-3-pyruvate (IPyA) pathway catalyzed by Trp aminotransferase
  (TAA); and 4) the indoleacetamide (IAM) pathway which initiates directly from Trp
  via either IAOx or indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN).'
