caption: Adipose tissue pathways regulated by sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerases (PARPs) based on current literature in mouse models, adipocyte cell
  lines and human studies. The effect of obesity on white and brown adipose tissue
  NAD+ levels and expression levels of SIRTs, PARPs and NAD+ biosynthesis gene nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) are also shown in separate boxes next to both
  tissues. Arrows indicate increased (↑), decreased (↓) or unchanged (−) pathway activity/gene
  expression level. OXPHOS; oxidative phosphorylation.
