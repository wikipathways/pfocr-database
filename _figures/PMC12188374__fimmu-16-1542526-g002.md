caption: (1) Treatment with EGFR-TKI or KRAS inhibitors may lead to AST. For patients
  with STK11/LKB1 mutations, the KRT6A gene is highly expressed in the AST transitional
  state. Under the influence of the local TME, M2-TAMs affects LSD1 and indirectly
  promotes the tumor cell proliferation and invasion process mediated by KRT6A, affecting
  treatment prognosis; (2) Tumor cells can induce neutrophils through TGFβ1 to promote
  EMT. In KRAS-driven LUAD, there is recruitment and infiltration of TANs mediated
  by CXCL3 and CXCL5. TET2 promotes neutrophil lipid transfer via STAT3-mediated CXCL5
  expression. TANs inhibit T cell proliferation and reduce the secretion of IFN-γ
  and TNF-α, affecting the TIME and promoting the AST process; (3) IL-6/IL-17 indirectly
  influences the TIME of AST through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, negatively regulating
  neutrophils, natural killer cells, effector T cells and dendritic cells, and positively
  regulating regulatory T cells and MDSCs. AST, adenosquamous transformation; M2-TAMs,
  M2 macrophages; TANs, tumor-associated neutrophils; TIME, tumor immune microenvironment;
  ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; ASLC, adenosquamous lung carcinoma;
