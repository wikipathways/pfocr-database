caption: Mechanisms of the anti-diabetic effects of carotenoids. During oxidative
  stress, IκB is phosphorylated by IKK, resulting in the release of NF-κB. NF-κB is
  translocated to the nucleus, and the transcription of inflammatory cytokines can
  commence. Carotenoids inactivate the NF-κB pathway. Carotenoids inhibit the degradation
  of Nrf2 and interact with Keap1. Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus, and the transcription
  of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes can start. Carotenoids inhibit MAPK signaling
  from reaching the nucleus [,,].
