  via activation of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/MAPK pathways
  (not shown) (3). These pathways are also activated by ligand binding to the GPR30
  (4) and by growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, including HER2, inducing
  autophosphorylation and downstream signalling (5). The PI3K/Akt pathway (6) as indicated
  is a covergence point in the mechanisms implicated in drug resistance in the three
  types of breast cancer discussed here, as pathway hyperactivity frequently occurs
