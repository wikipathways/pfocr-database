caption: PGE2 stimulates the secretion of BDNF from both microglial and astrocyte
  human cell lines through the activation of the EP2 receptor and the cyclic AMP pathway.
  Both cell types express the mRNA for the EP2 receptor and have a functional cAMP
  response to PGE2 treatment. Luciferase reporter gene studies indicate that CRE-mediated
  transcriptional activity is induced by PGE2 in both cell types in response to PGE2.
  Accordingly, CREB is rapidly phosphorylated following PGE2 stimulation in a PKA-dependent
  manner. Signal transduction studies confirm the involvement of the EP2 receptor,
  cAMP signaling, and PKA activity in PGE2 stimulated BDNF secretion.
