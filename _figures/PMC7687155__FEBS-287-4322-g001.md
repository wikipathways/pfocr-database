caption: Overview of calnexin/calreticulin cycle. (A) The monoglucosylated form of
  newly synthesized glycoproteins proteins binds to calreticulin (CRT)/calnexin (CNX)
  and promotes protein folding with assistance from ERp57, CypB, and ERp29. Following
  release of the terminal glucose by glucosidase II, natively folded proteins are
  transported to Golgi. Incompletely folded proteins are reglucosylated by UGGT and
  rebind calreticulin/calnexin for additional folding cycles. If multiple folding
  cycles are unsuccessful, terminally misfolded proteins are transported to the cytoplasm
  for degradation via the ER‐associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. (B) Structure
  of N‐linked glycan. The precursor glycan is attached to the protein with three glucose
  residues. The first two are removed through the action of glucosidases I and II
  to generate the monoglucosylated form that is required for binding calnexin and
  calreticulin. UGGT acts on misfolded glycoproteins to add back glucose to the glycan
  for additional rounds of chaperone‐mediated folding.
