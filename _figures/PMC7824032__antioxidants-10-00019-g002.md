caption: Nutrients can regulate cell metabolism through protein S-glutathionylation-mediated
  redox signaling. The interconnection between nutrient metabolism, oxidative stress/redox
  imbalance, and methylglyoxal (MGO) formation and metabolism is schematically represented.
  Yellow boxes indicate normal nutrient catabolism, which induces ROS production balanced
  by ROS scavenging. Red boxes indicate a condition of redox imbalance that induces
  redox signaling through protein S-glutathionylation. Green boxes indicate the metabolic
  changes that underly cell response to oxidative stress, leading to the restoration
  of both the redox balance and normal nutrient metabolism via protein deglutathionylation
  (light blue box). The increase of the MGO level occurring under oxidative stress
  conditions and its involvement in redox signaling, ROS scavenging, and ATP production
  via OXPHOS (see ) are also schematically indicated.
