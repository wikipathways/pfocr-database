caption: 'Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-induced oncogenic signaling. HCV infection creates
  a procarcinogenic effect through the simultaneous dysregulation of cell survival,
  proliferation, inflammatory, angiogenic, and differentiation signaling pathways.
  The tight control of target genes involved in transcriptional regulation and cell
  cycle progression is altered by HCV via different strategies. Forcing p53 in the
  cytoplasm, NS5A prevents the gene expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21 (not shown). This cytoplasmic-retention strategy is also shared by NS5B, which
  traps pRb in the cytoplasm. Consequently, E2F is free to act as transcriptional
  activator for cell proliferation target genes. Core protein, which is preferentially
  localized in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, where it interferes with
  transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling via Smad3 interaction. Epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  are not only required for HCV entry but also represent oncogenic targets for HCV-encoded
  proteins. Both NS5A and core protein induce the activation of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by indirect (inhibiting the suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 3, SOCS3) and direct mechanisms, respectively. Following its
  translocation to the nucleus, STAT3 strongly promotes a proinflammatory environment
  in cooperation with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (NF-κB) signaling. Furthermore, STAT3 and NF-κB, together with PI3K, induce hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) stabilization, which mediates the transcription of several
  proangiogenic factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF). HCV impairs
  cell differentiation programs by manipulating Wnt and Notch signaling pathways.
  NS5A induces a sustained Wnt signaling activation through the PI3K/Akt axis. This
  leads to the inactivation of a downstream degradation complex and the consequent
  accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, where it activates the expression of cell
  proliferation-related genes. NS3 stimulates downstream components of Notch pathway
  by the recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 complex on Snf2-related CBP
  activator (SRCAP), repressing cell differentiation programs. TGFR-1: TGF-β receptor
  1; FZD: Wnt receptor (Frizzled).'
