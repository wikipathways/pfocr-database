caption: A proposed scheme of the metabolic pathway of lactate and acetate transformation
  to butyrate and other products by C. butyricum based on carbon balance presented
  by the Eq. . The millimoles of carbon were converted to molecules of acetate, lactate,
  butyrate, ethanol, and the obtained values were multiplied by 100. The scheme presents
  the results of this study in relation to the pathway of lactate and acetate conversion
  to butyrate in Firmicutes [, , ] as well as current knowledge on anaerobic lactate
  oxidation and butyryl-CoA formation including flavin-based electron bifurcation
