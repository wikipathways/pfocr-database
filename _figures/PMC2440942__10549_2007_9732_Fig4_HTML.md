caption: Relative distribution of the TCA cycle in MCF10 cells. Flux through the TCA
  cycle and the pool size of succinate are higher in tumorigenic cells than in untransformed
  cells. Observed metabolites are boxed in grey and their relative sizes between tumorigenic
  states are roughly proportional to the observed pool sizes. Observed fluxes are
  shown as grey arrows and their widths are roughly proportional to the relative pathway
  flux. See Table  for values. Normal is the MCF10-A cells; transformed is the MCF10-AT
  cells; metastatic is the MCF10-CA1a cells. α-KG = α-ketoglutarate
