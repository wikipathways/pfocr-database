caption: a, Tumour cells express both cancer-driving mutations and ‘passenger’ mutations
  that cause the expression of neoantigens — ‘new’ molecular structures that, when
  presented by MHC proteins on the cell surface, are recognized by T cells of the
  immune system as being foreign, leading to an immune response against the tumour.
  However, interactions between the receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1, which are
  expressed on tumour cells, T cells and other immune cells such as macrophages, activate
  signalling pathways that inhibit T-cell activity and thus inhibit the antitumour
  immune response. b, Antibodies that block the PD-1 pathway by binding to PD-1 or
  PD-L1 can reactivate T-cell activity and proliferation, leading to enhanced antitumour
  immunity.
