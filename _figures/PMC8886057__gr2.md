caption: Integration of ITCH qPCR data, plasma metabolite data and ITCH-associated
  differentially expressed genes. Among the 2,765 genes found to be significantly
  (adjusted p value < 0.1) differentially expressed when analyses were based on low
  or high ITCH expression, 15 belonged to the human KEGG pathway ‘Valine, Leucine,
  and Isoleucine degradation’. Black dots represent metabolic intermediates in the
  pathway. Only end-point metabolites are annotated. Pathways shown in green boxes
  also contain genes that are significantly differentially expressed when microarray
  data are analyzed based on ITCH quartiles. White box around gene name, gene not
  significantly differentially expressed; colored box around gene name, log2-fold
  change (refer to color scale in figure).
