caption: A simplified diagram of the model showing upregulation of MMP13 by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, the protective effect of the TGFβ/Alk5/Smad2/3 pathway and the detrimental
  effect of TGFβ/Alk1/Smad1/5/8 pathway. The Cytoscape network suggests crosstalk
  between SMAD1 and other signalling pathways. Model components and interactions are
  shown with black font and lines respectively. Genes and interactions not currently
  in the model are shown in red.
