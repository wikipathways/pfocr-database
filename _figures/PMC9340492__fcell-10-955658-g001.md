caption: Selected inflammatory pathways affecting hematopoiesis studied in zebrafish.
  (A) Inflammatory influences driving the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).
  Proinflammatory cytokines such as Il1b, Il6, Ifn-γ, and Tnf secreted by neutrophils
  and macrophages can induce a hemogenic cell fate (runx1+; gata2+) in the vascular
  endothelium (kdrl+; fli1+). Endogenous innate immune signaling from R-loops, repetitive
  element transcripts, inflammasomes, and others can promote HSC emergence via NF-kappaB
  and IFN signaling pathways, as well as several others. (B) Proinflammatory cytokine
  and IFN signaling pathways. Pattern-recognition receptors such as TLR induce complex
  signaling pathways involving NFkB and TBK1 resulting in IRF3 and IRF7 activation.
  IRF3/7 are also regulated by ubiquitination factors such as UBA1. IRF3/7 then induce
  IFN genes and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFNs then bind their receptors, activating
  the JAK-STAT pathway that induces additional ISGs more potently. JAK1/2 mutations
  can result in ligand-independent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Mutations of
  other negative regulatory factors such as SHP2 can stimulate signaling from multiple
  receptors such as GCSF-R by enhancing the activity of receptor-associated kinases
  such as Lyn and SYK.
