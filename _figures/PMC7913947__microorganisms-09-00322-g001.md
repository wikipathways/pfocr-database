caption: Schematic overview of the kynurenine pathway. The first and rate-limiting
  step is catalyzed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1 and 2) or by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO2) that transform tryptophan to N-formyl kynurenine. The second enzyme in the
  pathway kynurenine formamidase produces L-kynurenine that could enter different
  possible branches, depending on cell-type or environmental context, to form various
  metabolites such as kynurenic acid (KYNA) by kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I-IV)
  or quinolinic acid via kynurenine mono oxidase (KMO). Pathways represented by interrupted
  arrows involve several metabolites and enzymatic reactions.
