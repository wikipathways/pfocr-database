caption: Metabolic design for enhanced lycopene production in Synechocystis. The lycopene
  overproduction construct encodes four enzymes shown in pink. Native metabolism of Synechocystis is
  shown in black. DXS (1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase) catalyses the synthesis
  of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
  GGPP (Geranylgeranyl diphosphate) is synthesised by CrtE (Geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  synthase) which catalyses the condensation between FPP (Farnesyl diphosphate) and
  IPP (Isopentenyl diphosphate). CrtB (phytoene synthase) then catalyses the condensation
  of two GGPP molecules to generate phytoene. Finally, CrtI (phytoene desaturase)
  catalyses the synthesis of lycopene (shown in red box) from phytoene, bypassing
  the native two-enzyme desaturation pathway (CrtP and CrtQ) via ζ-carotene.
