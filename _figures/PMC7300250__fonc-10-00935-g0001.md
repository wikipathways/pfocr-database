caption: Overview of signaling pathways regulated by Shp1. Activation of growth factor
  receptors initiates signaling through Src, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and MAPKs axes. Once
  activated Src triggers a signal pathway that culminates with the assembly of Tiam/Rac1
  complex at the plasma membrane and consequent formation of peripheral ruffles with
  stimulation of cell motility; Shp1 dephosphorylates Src on the inhibitory pTyr527
  thus activating this cascade. Membrane receptor activation triggers the tyrosine
  phosphorylation of GIV that directly binds and activates PI3K; this in turn activates
  Akt inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements. Shp1 dephosphorylates GIV and inhibits
  Akt activation via the GIV-PI3K axis. Akt also phosphorylates p27(kip1) (p27) at
  Thr157, promoting its cytoplasmic localization and abolishing its inhibitory effect
  on cell cycle components like cyclin D1-Cdk 4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk 2 complexes; this
  results in increased pRb phosphorylation and dissociation from E2F, stimulation
  of transcriptional activity with consequent cell cycle progression. Shp1 blocks
  p27(kip1) nuclear localization through the regulation of PI3K/Akt activity. Shp1
  also controls cell cycle progression regulating cyclin E localization. Following
  receptor stimulation, activated JAK phosphorylates STAT3, resulting in the translocation
  of activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) to the nucleus; Shp1 can directly dephosphorylate STAT3
  or its upstream JAK thereby hampering STAT3-regulated cellular proliferation and
  survival, angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Finally, Shp1 is involved
  in the attenuation of growth factors induced cell proliferation trough inhibition
  of MAPKs pathway.
