caption: 'Cis and trans IL6 signaling pathways. The cis pathway is mediated by mIL6R
  as an anti-inflammatory, while the trans-signaling pathway is mediated by sIL6-R
  as a pro-inflammatory. Both the IL-6 signaling pathways converge in the activation
  of the JAK/STAT pathway. Phosphorylation of the receptor associated JAK1 is induced
  by the binding of numerous cytokines or growth factors to their specific receptors;
  then, STAT3 phosphorylation occurs via JAK1. Phosphorylated STAT3 is dimerized and
  transferred to the nucleus, which causes the expression of target genes contributing
  to angiogenesis, proliferation, immunosuppression, and inflammation; IL6: Interlukine
  6, mIL6R: membrane form of IL-6 receptor, sIL6-R: soluble form of IL-6 receptor,
  JAK: Janus kinase, STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
