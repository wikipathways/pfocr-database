caption: The p110β/p85 dimer is activated both by binding to tyrosine phosphorylated
  receptors and their substrates, via the SH2 domains of p85, as well as by direct
  p110β binding to Gβγ subunits, in response to activation of G-protein coupled receptors.
  p110β/p85 dimers are also targeted to Rab5-positive early endosomes. p110β/p85 dimers
  signal in part by the production of PI[3,4,5]P3, which activates the Akt/mTOR pathway,
  TEC-family tyrosine kinases, Rho-family GTPases, and other downstream effectors.
  The targeting of p110β/p85 dimers to early endosomes may also contribute to PI[3]P
  production in this organelle, via the dephosphorylation of PIP3. However, kinase
  independent signaling of p110β/p85 dimers contributes to proliferation of PTEN-null
  tumor cells, as well as regulation of endocytic trafficking and autophagy.
