caption: SAM methyl cycle and transmethylation/transsulfuration related pathway. Methionine
  is activated by ATP to produce SAM. The transfer of the methyl group from SAM by
  methyltransferase yields SAH, which is hydrolyzed to adenosine and Hcys. Hcys can
  be remethylated to regenerate Met by two Hcys methyltransferases, met synthase and
  betaine-Hcys methyltransferase (BHMT), or be used to synthesize cysteine by transsulfuration
  pathway reactions (CBS and CSE). Cys formed via transsulfuration pathways serves
  for biosynthesis of GSH. Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized through successive SAM-dependent
  methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine. Acetylcholine is synthesized by acetylCoA
