caption: Tumour tissue is often accompanied by abnormal blood vessel growth to supply
  more energy. Free glucose is taken up by cells from the tumour microenvironment
  and is ultimately converted into lactate through the catalysis of key enzymes such
  as HK2, PFK1, and PK, causing the further acidification of the tumour microenvironment.
  Abnormal blood vessel growth leads to hyperactivation of glycolytic function in
  tumours, further producing more ATP and metabolic byproducts that promote angiogenesis.
