caption: Canonical Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway at the FSHR. The Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway has
  been the most studied and is associated with various intracellular events. It is
  now acknowledged that PKA is not the sole target of cAMP accumulation. Indeed, EPAC
  is also activated upon FSH stimulation. Both PKA and EPAC contribute to the activation
  of MAPK ERK and p38, whereas EPAC also leads to Akt activation.
