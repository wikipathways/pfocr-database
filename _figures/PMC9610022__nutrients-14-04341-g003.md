caption: 'Impact of a high-fat diet on the ovarian folliculogenesis. Hyperleptinemia
  determines a systemic endocrine imbalance which has deleterious effects on the follicular
  pool. As a result, processes encompassing each step of the ovarian folliculogenesis
  (early, late, and ovulation) are affected. In early folliculogenesis, high-fat diet-dependent
  deregulation of key proliferative and survival pathways (mTOR, PI3K/AKT/FOXO3 and
  SIRT1) causes defects in the primordial follicle activation process. Alterations
  of the insulin and the angiogenic pathways together with an increased production
  of AMH are then responsible for an impaired progression to the next steps of folliculogenesis.
  In detail, overstimulation of the insulin pathway causes excessive T production
  (by theca cells) that GCs are not able to convert into the estrogen E2. Dysfunctional
  behavior in the angiogenic factors leads to poor follicular vascularization. In
  addition, high AMH levels make the follicles more resistant to the action of FSH,
  resulting in the inhibition of the follicular maturation up to ovulation. Finally,
  menstrual cycle disorders and anovulation are consequences of the above-deregulated
  processes. List of abbreviations included in the figure: the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K); AKT serine/threonine kinase
  (AKT); forkhead box O3 (FOXO3); sirtuin1 (SIRT1); anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH);
  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); testosterone (T); estradiol (E2); aromatase
