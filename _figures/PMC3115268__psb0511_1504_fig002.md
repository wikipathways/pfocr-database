caption: A sketch of components involved in HRT-mediated resistance signaling pathway.
  TC V-induced resistance response is initiated upon indirect interaction between
  the dominant resistance protein HRT and TCV's avirulence factor, the coat protein
  (CP). Upon recognition of the pathogen, an HRT-mediated response leads to HR, accumulation
  of SA and PR-1 gene expression. Mutations in EDS1, PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 genes do
  not compromise HR or PR-1 expression. However, mutation in EDS1 and lack of SA compromises
  both HR to TCV and associated induction of PR-1 gene. Resistance to TCV is dependent
  on EDS1, PAD4, EDS5 and SID2 genes. Exogenous application of SA upregulates expression
  of the HRT and this step is mediated via PAD4 (dash and dotted line). Exogenous
  application of SA also upregulates expression of EDS1, PAD4 and PR-1 genes. Absence
  of light abolishes both HR and resistance to TCV and this in turn is associated
  with degradation of HRT. HRT interacts with COP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Under
  normal light conditions, CRY2 and PHOT2 repress COP1-derived degradation of HRT
  by negatively regulating COP1. Degradation of CRY2 relieves the repression of COP1
  activity and results in degradation of HRT.
