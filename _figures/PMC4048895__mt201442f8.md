caption: Proposed model for the role of miR-26a in pulmonary fibrosis. In response
  to stimuli, the TGF-β1 signaling pathway is activated, which in turn downregulates
  expression of miR-26a by stimulating phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
  Smad3 in lung fibroblasts. Reduction of miR-26a results in increase in CTGF, leading
  to production of collagens and pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, miR-26a downregulation
  results in upregulation of Smad4, which increases nuclear translocation of p-Smad3
  and further suppresses expression of miR-26a. Once the miR-26a/p-Smad3 loop is activated,
  it is perpetuated on its own and finally aggravates collagen deposition and other
  extracellular matrix proteins involved in fibrosis. CTGF, connective tissue growth
  factor; miR, microRNA; TGF, transforming growth factor.
