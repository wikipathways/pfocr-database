caption: The cytosolic disaggregation and refolding machinery. The native protein
  is shown to be unfolded by heat shock (depicted as a salmon rectangle), which also
  causes changes in the sHsp oligomerization status. The constitutive Ssa Hsp70 chaperones
  partner with the J protein Ydj1 and at least one nucleotide exchange factor (NEF)
  to promote the refolding of disaggregated (Hsp104 pathway) or unfolded but protected
  (Hsp42 and Hsp26) proteins.
