caption: The role of MCU in the control of skeletal muscle trophism and metabolism.
  Schematic representation of the effects of manipulation of MCU activity on mitochondrial
  metabolism and trophism of the skeletal muscle tissue. In physiological conditions,
  Ca2+ entry into mitochondria stimulates glucose and fatty acids utilization to produce
  energy through the TCA cycle, via the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO), respectively. The enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
  by MCU overexpression promotes muscle fiber oxidative metabolism leading to muscle
  hypertrophy via Akt pathway activation and upregulation of PGC1α4. On the contrary,
  the reduction of Ca2+ entry in the mitochondria by MCU deletion induces muscle metabolism
  rewiring towards an increased FAO, provokes muscle atrophy, impairs exercise performance,
  and causes global metabolic alterations, leading to an enhanced liver and adipose
  tissue catabolism.
