caption: Wnt pathway, sclerostin, and DKK1; effects of monoclonal antibodies on bone.(a)
  Scl and DKK1 bind Wnt coreceptors LRP5/6 to inhibit Wnt binding and signaling to
  decrease bone formation. Scl and DKK1 bind the first β-sheet of LRP5 and LRP6 to
  inhibit Wnt-1 signaling. DKK1 also binds the third β-sheet to inhibit Wnt-3a signaling.
  DKK1 and Scl can also utilize coreceptors, such as Kremen-1 or -2 receptors, to
  augment Wnt inhibitory activity resulting in the internalization of the complex.
  (b) Scl-Ab and DKK1-Ab prevent the interaction of these molecules with LRP5 and
  LRP6, thereby allowing Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a to bind the first and third β-sheet of LRP5/6,
  respectively. Actions of these antibodies on bone are summaries. Wnt proteins (either
  Wnt-1 or Wnt-3a) form a complex with FRZ receptors and LRP5/6 to transduce an intracellular
  signal leading to increased bone formation. (For an in-depth review see ). DKK1,
  Dickkopf-related protein 1; DKK1-Ab, Dickkopf-1 antibody; FRZ, frizzled; LRP, lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; Scl, sclerostin; Scl-Ab, sclerostin antibody.
