caption: 'ERα activity through genomic and nongenomic actions. Genomic activity: ERα
  activation upon estrogen binding (E2) or after its phosphorylation by cellular kinases
  following growth factor (GF) receptor stimulation allows its release from heat shock
  proteins (HSPs). Then, ERα translocates into the nucleus, where it binds DNA by
  direct (through estrogen responsive elements, EREs) or indirect mechanisms (upon
  binding to other transcription factors, such as AP1 or SP1, that bind DNA through
  serum responsive elements, SREs). Nongenomic activity: Activated ERα interacts with
  cellular kinases (e.g., PI3K and Src), leading to signaling pathway stimulation
  involving AKT or MAPK, for example, eventually resulting in transcription factor
  (TF) activation. All these mechanisms induce transcriptional activation or repression
  of the regulation of cell fate.'
