  following enzymes with their respective genes named carry out: (1) G3P acyltransferase
  (PlsB); (2) 1-Acyl-G3P acyltransferase (PlsC); (3) CDP-DAG synthase (CdsA); (4)
  phosphatidylserine synthase (PssA); (5) phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd);
  (6) phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (PgsA); (7) phosphatidylglycerophosphate
  phosphatases (PgpABC) encoded by three genes; (8) cardiolipin synthase (Cls) encoded
  by three genes. ClsA and ClsB condense 2 PGs while ClsC condenses PG and PE. ClsB
  (8*) can also displace ethanolamine from PE using glycerol to make PG, which can
  be utilized to make CL in pgsA null strains. (9) PG pre-membrane derived oligosaccharide
