caption: Summary of major fluxes during defatting of steatotic HepG2s. Values shown
  are representative fluxes (reaction number is shown) for each major pathway from  estimated
  by MFA during defatting under normoxic conditions with basal medium (DMEM), medium
  supplemented with defatting agents, and under hyperoxic conditions with medium supplemented
  with defatting agents.

  description: Summary of major fluxes during defatting of steatotic HepG2s. Values
    shown are representative fluxes (reaction number is shown) for each major pathway
    from  estimated by MFA during defatting under normoxic conditions with basal medium
    (DMEM), medium supplemented with defatting agents, and under hyperoxic conditions
    with medium supplemented with defatting agents.
