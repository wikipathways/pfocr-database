caption: 'The 447 TFAP2C target genes were analyzed using Ingenuity Systems to determine
  associations between genes for the purpose of defining physiologic pathways regulated
  by TFAP2C. The main pathway (with the greatest number of genes) is shown and was
  characterized as involved in cell growth and proliferation. Prominent genes noted
  in this network include MYC, ESR1 and ERK. Red tone indicates genes repressed by
  TFAP2C and green indicates genes induced by TFAP2C. Inset: Retinoic acid signaling
  pathway was also identified as a prominent network involved with TFAP2C target genes,
  RXR, RAR and CRABP2.'
