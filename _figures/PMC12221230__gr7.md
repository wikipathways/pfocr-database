caption: Schematic diagram of the study. Excessive mechanical loading disrupts the
  cartilage clock by upregulating REV-ERBα expression via activation of the MAPK-MYC
  signaling pathway, ultimately leading to chondrocyte senescence and OA degeneration.
  The downregulation of REV-ERBα through inhibition of the MAPK-MYC pathway via U0126
  or SB203580 or pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBα via SR8278 restores the dampened
  cartilage clock and chondrocyte senescence induced by mechanical overloading, thereby
  mitigating OA progression
