caption: Sulfate assimilation pathway in M. tuberculosis. The majority of sulfate
  reducing bacteria use APS as their source of sulfite. In this reaction, APS is reduced
  to sulfite and adenosine-5′-monophosphate (AMP) by APS reductase. Sulfite, in turn,
  is reduced by later enzymes in this metabolic pathway, forming first sulfide before
  incorporation into cysteine and, ultimately, to methionine and other essential reduced
  sulfur-containing biomolecules.
