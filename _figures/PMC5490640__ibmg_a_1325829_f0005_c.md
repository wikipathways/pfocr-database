caption: Ubiquitination in B cell activation. In B cells, the non-canonical NF-κB
  pathway mediated by two TNF receptor superfamily members, CD40 and BAFF receptor
  (BAFFR) is regulated by ubiquitination. Upon activation of CD40 or BAFFR, TRAF2/6
  promotes activation of cIAP1-cIAP2, which in turn mediates Lys 48-linked ubiquitination
  and degradation of TRAF3. Degradation of TRAF3 results in stabilization of NIK.
  Active NIK phosphorylates and activates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates the NF-κB
  subunit p100 (a precursor of p52). Phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of p100
  induces processing by the proteasome. This releases the mature p52 subunit, which
  associates with REL-B to promote expression of genes required for B cell survival,
  maturation and activation. Degradation of TRAF3 results in cytosolic translocation
  of a signaling complex containing the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK1. MEKK1 then activates
  JNK. An additional layer of regulation is provided by the E3 ligase ACT1 as well
  as the DUB OTUD7B. E3 ligases are indicated in red, DUBs in purple, and transcription
  factors in green (see color version of this figure at www.tandfonline.com/ibmg).
