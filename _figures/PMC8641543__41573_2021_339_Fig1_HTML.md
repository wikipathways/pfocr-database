caption: The deregulated tyrosine kinase receptors activate RAS or PI3K, MYC and/or
  mTOR. mTORC1 increases protein synthesis from MYC-induced mRNAs to enhance influx
  of amino acids (AAs, including glutamine), glucose and fatty acids to drive fatty
  acid, nucleotide and protein synthesis. Hypoxia-inducible factors HIF1α and HIF2α
  are induced by mTORC1 or hypoxia, resulting in activation of the glycolytic pathway
  with the conversion of glucose to lactate, which is exported extracellularly. MYC
  transactivates genes involved in glycolysis and shunting of 3-phosphoglycerate to
  produce serine, which is converted to glycine and contributes to one-carbon (1C)
  metabolism. MYC also induces glutamine metabolism, enhancing glutamine and glucose
  uptake and their catabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, providing scaffolds
  for fatty acids and nucleotide synthesis. Oxygen is shown to assist the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain (ETC, with complexes I–V shown) or inhibit HIF1α and HIF2α
  by mediating its proteasomal degradation. aKG, α-ketoglutarate; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator; MAX, MYC-associated factor X; OAA, oxaloacetate;
