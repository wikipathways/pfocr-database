caption: The IRE1α-XBP1 pathway in glucose homeostasis. (a) IRE1α-JNK signaling is
  activated by ER stress, which reduces IRS1 (pY896) tyrosine phosphorylation and
  Akt phosphorylation whereas enhancing IRS1 (pS307) serine phosphorylation, thereby
  increasing insulin resistance. (b) p38 MAPK phosphorylates the spliced form of XBP1
  on residues Thr48 and Ser61 and greatly enhances its nuclear migration. Then, nuclear
  XBP1s induces the expression of UPR target genes. (c) Insulin promotes p85α and
  p85β (subunits of PI3K) association with XBP1s by disrupting their heterodimerization,
  which subsequently facilitates XBP1s nuclear translocation independent of PI3K catalytic
  activity. Nuclear XBP1s then induces the expression of UPR target genes. (d) During
  the UPR, nuclear XBP1s can improve insulin sensitivity by regulating the expression
  of UPR target genes that are involved in adiponectin multimerization in adipocytes.
  (e) In the nucleus, XBP1s also directly interacts with FoxO1, a transcription factor
  involved in gluconeogenesis resulting in its proteasomal degradation and thereby
  promoting glucose tolerance in the liver. (f) IRE1α-XBP1 signaling is activated
  by the postprandial environment. XBP1s regulates UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (GalE)
  expression at the transcriptional level, thereby increasing its biosynthetic activity
  and reducing hepatic glucose release. FoxO1, Forkhead box O1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
