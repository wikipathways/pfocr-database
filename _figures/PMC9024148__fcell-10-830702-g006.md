  diagram of expression correlation between differential genes and differential metabolites
  between WT-HFD and WT-NCD mice. The figure shows the network diagram based on Pearson’s
  correlation analysis to calculate the correlation between the response intensity
  data of genes and metabolites, and the relationship pairs with p-value ≤ 0.05 were
  selected. The red line represents a positive correlation, and the green line represents
  a negative correlation. The thickness of the line represents the correlation coefficient.

  green is downregulated genes or metabolites. (D) Differentially expressed genes
