caption: Tomatidine-target genes associated with the top two KEGG pathways. (A) The
  tomatidine-target genes that are part of the MAPK signaling pathway, including MAPK1
  and MAPK3 are associated with proliferation, differentiation, cell survival or anti-apoptotic,
  and inflammation. (B) Tomatidine-target genes that are part of the Neurotrophin
  signaling pathway, including MAPK1 and MAPK3 are associated with cellular differentiation,
  cell survival, and retrograde transport.
