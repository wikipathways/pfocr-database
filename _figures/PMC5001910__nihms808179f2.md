caption: Glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate, which can then either be converted
  into lactate, and secreted, or can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in which
  it will generate NADH and FADH2 for the electron transport chain, leading to ATP
  production. Glycolysis also feeds the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates
  ribose for nucleotides, amino acids and NADPH. NADPH is used for fatty acid synthesis,
  which uses citrate withdrawn from the TCA cycle. Fatty acids can also be oxidized,
  generating NADH and FADH2, which again drive ATP production from the electron transport
  chain. Finally amino acid metabolism can feed the TCA cycle and is also important
  for cell growth and protein biosynthesis. In this figure, the pathways that require
  oxygen are indicated in green boxes, and pathways that are not oxygen dependent
  are indicated in blue boxes. In addition, inhibitors of metabolic pathways are indicated
  in grey boxes. BPTES, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulphide.
