caption: There are two pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis. Most eubacteria, apicomplexan
  parasitic protozoa, and plant chloroplasts use the MEP pathway. Most eukaryotic
  species, including humans and other mammals, use the mevalonate pathway. In eubacteria
  and parasites using the MEP pathway, Vγ2Vδ2 T cells primarily recognize the metabolite
  HMBPP that is produced by HMBPP synthase (ispG, gcpE) and converted by LytB (hdr,
  ispH) to IPP and DMAPP. To engineer Salmonella vaccine bacteria, plasmids containing
  enzymes of the mevalonate pathway from Streptomyces sp. strain CL190 were transformed
  into the bacteria. The bacteria were then transformed with the pKD46 temperature-sensitive
  plasmid containing genes for λ Red recombination proteins. The transformants were
  cultured at 30°C with fosmidomycin (to block the MEP pathway and switch isoprenoid
  metabolism to the mevalonate pathway). To target the lytB gene, PCR amplification
  with primers flanking the lytB gene were used to generate a 1.1 kb linear fragment
  encoding the chloramphenicol resistance gene flanked by 50 base pairs of 5′ and
  3′ sequence adjacent to the lytB gene. L-arabinose was then added to induce the
  recombination enzymes and the DNA fragment targeting the lytB gene introduced into
  the bacteria by electroporation. Chloramphenicol was used to select for lytB deletion
  mutants that were then grown at 37°C to eliminate the pKD46 plasmid. Deleting lytB
  causes HMBPP to accumulate while the addition of the mevalonate pathway allows the
  bacteria to survive. CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; CMS,
