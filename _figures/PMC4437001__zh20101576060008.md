caption: Working model on how aldosterone modulates NCC through both SPAK signaling
  pathway and DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. NCC within oval circle indicates
  NCC accumulation in plasma membrane which consists of NCC and phosphorylated NCC
  (pNCC). Majority of NCC pool are present in the cytoplasm. Long arrow lines indicate
  either activation of the kinases or direction of chemical reaction. Long broken
  arrow line indicates upregulation with unknown mechanism. A t-shaped line indicates
  inhibition effect. NCC-Ub indicates ubiquitinated NCC. pERK1/2 indicates phospho-ERK1/2.
  MEK is a MAP/ERK kinase, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2. DUSP6 is a dual-specificity
  protein phosphatase 6 (the specific ERK1/2 phosphatase).
