caption: 'Simplistic view of methanogenesis and biochemical reactions involved acetate
  and acetyl-CoA. Methanogenesis is shown in the rectangle with solid line border.
  Grey background indicates the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Acetate dissimilation
  and assimilation were shown. Hypothetical pathways were indicated as dotted lines.
  Enzymes involved in the Wolfe cycle were not included. Metabolites: acetyl-CoA indicates
  acetyl coenzyme A; acetyl-AMP, acetyladenylate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Fdrd2-, reduced ferredoxin;
  Fdox, oxidised ferredoxin; MFR, methanofuran; H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; HS-CoA,
  coenzyme A; HS-CoB, coenzyme B; HS-CoM, coenzyme M; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi,
  inorganic pyrophosphate. Enzymes (bolded): Acd, ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase;
  Acs, AMP-forming acetate-CoA ligase; CODH/ACS, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA
  synthase complex; Pfor, pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase.'
