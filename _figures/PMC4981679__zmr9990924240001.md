caption: Roles of different bacterial SMases and PLases in virulence. S. enterica
  serovar Typhimurium injects SseJ, an SGNH esterase with PLA1 and GCATase activities,
  via a T3SS into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Once in the cytosol, SseJ binds
  to RhoA GTPase, triggering its GCATase activity, which increases the vacuole surface.
  R. typhi produces two patatin-like PLA2s, Pat1 and Pat2, which are secreted during
  host intracellular growth and help phagosome escape. S. pyogenes SlaA is a class
  I-like PLA2 that enters host epithelial cells in an actin-dependent manner and plays
  an important role in pathogen adhesion and cytotoxicity. P. aeruginosa injects ExoU,
  a patatin-like PLA2, through a T3SS into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Once translocated,
  ExoU becomes activated and acts toward several plasma membrane substrates, leading
  to cytoskeletal collapse and cellular necrosis. ExoU also activates several signaling
  pathways, such as the arachidonic acid cascade and a PAF receptor–NF-κB pathway
  that leads to inflammatory mediator production. L. monocytogenes produces the PI-PLC
  PlcA and the Zn2+ metalloPLC PlcB, which are required for bacterial escape into
  the cytosol from the single-membrane primary pathogen-containing vacuole, triggering
  preautophagosomal structure stalling, favoring bacterial escape from the host autophagic
  defense. L. monocytogenes PlcB also contributes to bacterial escape into the cytoplasm.
  Both Bacillus spp. and S. aureus secrete a SMase C that plays an important role
  in virulence by increasing Cer, which changes the physical properties of the membrane
  and could also participate in signal transduction leading to cell death. These two
  bacteria also produce PI-PLC, which can facilitate signal transduction and removal
  of GPI-anchored proteins from plasma membranes. C. perfringens alpha-toxin, a Zn2+
  metalloPLC, is required for this bacterium's escape from the macrophage phagosome
  in early stages of infection. At high concentrations, this toxin disrupts the plasma
  membrane, causing cell lysis, but at low concentrations if internalized by the target
  cell it cleaves PC and SM at the membranes of the endolysosomal compartment, generating
  DAG and Cer, which trigger signaling pathways that lead to ROS production and cell
  death. N. gonorrhoeae secretes a PLD named NgPLD that by both generation of PA and
  Akt binding drives cell surface recruitment of CR3, membrane ruffling, and bacteria
  engulfment, modulating host cell signaling events required for bacterial invasion.
