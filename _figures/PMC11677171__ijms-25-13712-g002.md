caption: Molecular mechanisms responsible for the suppression of T:B cell cross-talk
  in inflamed glandular tissues. MSCs induce programmed cell death of rapidly proliferating
  lymphocytes in PD-L1 and Fas-dependent manner, reduce production of IFN-γ in activated
  Th1 cells, prevent IFN-γ-dependent synthesis of auto-reactive IgG in B cells and
  favored expression of FoxP3 in naïve T cells, enabling generation and expansion
  of immunosuppressive Tregs. MSCs, in PD-L1-dependent manner, prevent differentiation
  of naïve CD4+T cells in follicular T cells. By delivering IL-6, MSCs activate the
  Jak2/Stat3 pathway in MDSCs which led to the enhanced production of Arginase-1,
  NO and ROS. These mediators induce oxidative stress of inflammatory T cells and
  reduce their number in lachrymal and salivary glands. MSC-sourced miR-125b inhibits
  expansion of CD19+CD20-CD27+CD38+ plasma cells and reduces production of autoantibodies,
  attenuating antibody-dependent pathological changes in the inflamed salivary and
  lacrimal glands
