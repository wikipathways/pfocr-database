caption: Model for IRS2's role in cell cycle control. IRS2 is targeted for proteasomal
  degradation by APC/CCdh1 during G1. When APC/C is inactivated at the G1/S boundary,
  IRS2 protein accumulates, allowing it to stimulate the expression of cell cycle-related
  proteins either through IR-mediated action () or through another receptor tyrosine
  kinase. Some of the proteins that are regulated through this pathway may be required
  for a robust spindle assembly checkpoint, which directly inhibits APC/CCdc20 during
  M-phase.
