caption: Engineered pathway for fatty alcohol production in E. coli. The fatty alcohol
  synthesis flux from fatty acyl-ACP was enhanced by deletion of acyl-CoA thioesterases
  coupled with overexpression of fatty acyl-ACP reductase (FAR, green line). Competing
  pathways were blocked (red line) by deletion of lactic dehydrogenase (ldhA), phosphate
  acetyltransferase (pta) and acetate kinase (ackA)
