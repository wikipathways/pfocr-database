caption: Model depicting mitochondrial generation of H2O2 as a key modulator of TCR-mediated
  signal transduction. Mitochondrial translocation to the IS during TCR activation
  brings mitochondria in proximity to the TCR signaling complex. After TCR engagement,
  mitochondria produce an H2O2 burst that inhibits phosphatases, thereby enhancing
  and prolonging protein phosphorylation. Enhanced signaling from these membrane proximal
  proteins specifically up-regulates second messenger signal transduction through
  the JNK/cJun pathway. Phosphorylated cJun translocates into the nucleus and activates
  transcription factors for cytokine and chemokine production. Circles indicate protein
  phosphorylation (green, tyrosine; blue, threonine/tyrosine; red, serine).
