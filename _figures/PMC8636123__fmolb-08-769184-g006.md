caption: Potential mHTT protein degradation approaches using the autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway. (A) Schematic overview of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Lunate-shaped
  phagophore membrane (blue) forms, and as it elongates it engulfs proteins and organelles
  (light and dark brown) destined for degradation. The phagophore closes off and becomes
  an autophagosome vesicle. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome (dark blue),
  and the lysosomal enzymes (light blue) degrade the proteins and organelles inside.
  The same elements are relevant in (B,C), but are not shown in figures. (B) Schematic
  of an autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC) targeting cytoplasmic mHTT for degradation.
  ATTEC (orange) binds to mHTT (brown), and tethers mHTT to LC3 autophagy protein
  (green). This leads to mHTT being engulfed into the autophagosome (blue). Upon the
  fusion with the lysosome (dark blue), mHTT is degraded by the lysosomal enzymes
  (light blue). (C) Schematic of an autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTAC) targeting
  mHTT for degradation. AUTAC attaches to mHTT (brown) via the protein binding domain
  (yellow). The guanine derivative domain of AUTAC (dark green) is recognized by E3
  ubiquitin ligase (dark blue), and close proximity to mHTT, induces mHTT ubiquitination.
  Multiple rounds of ubiquitination lead to K63 polyubiquitination (pink) of mHTT.
  The polyubiquitination is recognized by an autophagy reporter p62 (light green),
  which then tethers mHTT to the phagophore and autophagosome via LC3 (green). Upon
  fusion with the lysosome (dark blue), mHTT in the phagosome is degraded by the lysosomal
  enzymes (light blue).
