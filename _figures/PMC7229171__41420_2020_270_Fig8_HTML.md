caption: Dasatinib inhibited SRC activity and lowered ETS-1 expression, but induced
  the IKK/NF-κB pathway, while the IKKβ inhibitor CmpdA blocked Dasatinib induction
  of IKK/NF-κB. A combination of Dasatinib and CmpdA led to significant inhibition
  of ETS-1 and IKK/NF-κB as well as cell proliferation and survival.
