caption: 'Redox switches in Nox. Control of translocation: Oxidants from various sources
  may affect the translocation of important regulatory subunits of Nox2 (and Nox1),
  p47phox, by oxidation of thiol groups in PKC with subsequent phosphorylation and
  translocation of these subunits to the membrane causing activation of and superoxide
  formation by Nox2 (and Nox1). Likewise, those oxidants cause oxidation of thiols
  in protein disulfide isomerase (PDIox) leading to association with p47phox (maybe
  also NoxO1 or NoxA1), translocation of this dimer to the membrane, and activation
  of Nox2 (and Nox1). Reduction of thiols in PDI (PDIred) targets the p47phox complex
  to the cytosol without activation of Nox. Control of expression: Oxidants contribute
  to the induction of Nox subunit expression via redox-sensitive transcription factors,
  but also affect the stability of their mRNA due to post-translational oxidative
  modification of mRNA-(de)stabilizing proteins, all of which leads to increased expression
  of Nox subunits. Since Nox4 activity is mainly controlled at the protein level,
  this pathway may be of great importance for this isoform. The inset shows the phorbol
  ester/diacylglycerol binding domain of PKCα with two zinc-sulfur clusters (ZnCys3)
  that function as redox switches in all PKC isoforms. The crystal structure was rendered
  from the protein database entry 2ELI (DOI:10.2210/pdb2eli/pdb) using the PyMOL Molecular
