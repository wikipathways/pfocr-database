caption: 'Different pathways by which cytokine signals access the brain have been
  identified.Humoral pathway: Pro-inflammatory cytokines released by activated monocytes
  and macrophages access the brain through leaky regions of the blood-brain barrier
  such as the choroid plexus and circumventricular organs (CVOs). Within the brain
  parenchyma, the activation of endothelial cells is responsible for the subsequent
  release of second messengers (e.g., prostaglandins [PGE2] and nitric oxide [NO])
  that act on specific brain targets.Neural pathway: Pro-inflammatory cytokines released
  by activated monocytes and macrophages stimulate primary afferent nerve fibers in
  the vagus nerve. Sensory afferents of the vagus nerve relay information to brain
  areas through activation of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and area
  postrema.Cellular Pathway: A cellular pathway has been recently described by which
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably TNF-alpha, are able to stimulate microglia to
  produce monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which in turn is responsible
  for the recruitment of monocytes into the brain ().Abbreviations: Interleukin-6:
