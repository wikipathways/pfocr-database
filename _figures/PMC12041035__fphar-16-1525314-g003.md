caption: Exosomes mediate crosstalk between kidney cells. The exosomal miR-19b-3p
  derived from renal TECs is significantly elevated in acute or chronic kidney injury
  models, leading to M1 phenotypic polarization through internalization by macrophages
  and targeting the NF-κB/SOCS-1 pathway (Lv et al., 2020). Additionally, the downregulation
  of miR-1269b in HG-treated HK-2 cells can lead to the increased expression of fibronectin-1
  (FBLN1), thereby promoting EMT within these cells (Tsai et al., 2021). HG-induced
  GECs secrete exosomes rich in TGF-β1 mRNA, which are subsequently internalized by
  GMCs and mediate GMC activation via the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore,
  exosomes abundant in circRNAs are released to enhance α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
  expression in GMCs and induce the EMT. Notably, HG-treated GECs also release exosomes
  rich in TGF-β1 mRNA, which contribute to EMT and podocyte dysfunction through the
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Hu et al., 2024)
