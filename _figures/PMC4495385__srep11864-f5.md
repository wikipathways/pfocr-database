caption: Red-labeled metabolites indicate up-regulation in mice with serotonin deficiency,
  while blue-labeled metabolites indicate the down-regulation compared with the control
  mice. Metabolite relationships were derived from HMDB and KEGG databases. Solid
  arrows represent direct metabolic reactions, and dashed arrows represent multiple
  reactions and indirect connections between two metabolites.
