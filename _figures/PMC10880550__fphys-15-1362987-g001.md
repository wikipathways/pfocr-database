caption: The effect of acetylcholine released from cholinergic neuron on heart, visceral
  smooth muscles and the brain. The vagus nerve acts on the heart to reduce heart
  rate and reduce cardiac contractility. One of its important actions is to cause
  hyperpolarization and reduce heart rate through Gi/o protein βγ subunits. In the
  GI smooth muscle, it activates mIcat cation channels through Gi/o protein alpha
  subunit, causing depolarization and increasing the frequency of pacemaker potential
  and contraction. In addition, cholinergic nerves increase neuronal excitability
  by suppressing M current (IM) at the superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons.
  Later, the molecular candidate for each ion channels were identified as GIRK(Kir3),
  TRPC4/5 and KCNQ2/3. An emphasis on the role of TRPC in the Gi signaling pathway
  should be considered in the brain, as well as M channels and GIRK channels
