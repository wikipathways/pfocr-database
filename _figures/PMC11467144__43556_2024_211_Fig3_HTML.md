caption: BMP signalling pathways in the intestinal crypt and potential therapeutic
  targets. BMP signaling pathway induces the dimerization of BMP type I and type II
  receptors (BMPR1 and BMPRII), resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization
  of receptor-regulated mothers against decapentaplegic homologues (rSMADs). These
  rSMADs then form heterotrimeric complexes with common SMADs (cSMAD or SMAD4) and
  translocate to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, this complex regulates the expression
  of target genes. The potential targets and their mechanisms of action have been
  marked with pink boxes
