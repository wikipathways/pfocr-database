caption: Proposed model of drug tolerant persister cell evolution. Under drug pressure
  a subpopulation of transient drug tolerant persister cells can emerge through epigenetic
  mechanisms. This transient DTP population can acquire permanent genetic modifications
  which allows for the emergence of a drug tolerant population. The transcriptionally
  dependent state of persister cells induced by targeted therapy can be exploited
  by the treatment with THZ1 which blocks transcriptional responses, promoting cancer
  cell death. However, THZ1 treatment in combination with erlotinib suppresses the
  expression of the UFMylation pathway components which can trigger a protective unfolded
  protein response associated with tolerable levels of ER stress and cell survival.
