caption: The IFN-I protein is secreted from infected cells and amplifies the IFN response
  by activating the ISGF3 complex (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) to induce IFN-I-stimulated genes.
  The SARS-CoV-2 proteins that inhibit IFN-I signaling are indicated in black boxes,
  and the associated blocked pathways are indicated by dashed lines.
