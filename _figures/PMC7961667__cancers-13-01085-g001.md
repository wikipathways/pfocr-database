caption: 'Biogenesis and function of piRNAs. (A) Biogenesis of piRNAs: Biogenesis
  of piRNA occurs through primary and secondary pathways (ping-pong cycle). In the
  primary pathway, piRNA precursors are transcribed from piRNA clusters by RNA polymerase
  2 (RNA Pol2). Antisense primary piRNAs are cleaved, trimmed into short fragments,
  and their 3′ ends are 2′-O-methylated and then loaded onto PIWI family proteins.
  In the secondary amplification pathways, also known as the ping-pong cycle, PIWI
  proteins associate with antisense piRNA and cleave piRNA precursors in the sense
  strand, or PIWI proteins associate with sense piRNA and cleave antisense piRNA precursors
  in the sense strand. The incorporated RNA is therefore processed into a mature secondary
  piRNA by trimming and modification, likely by the same mechanisms that generate
  a primary piRNA. (B) The biological functions of piRNAs: In the nucleus, PIWI–piRNA
  complexes can repress the transposon expression by methylation of the transposon
  region or chromatin modification around the transposon region. In the cytoplasm,
  piRNAs can facilitate mRNA maturation, cause cleavage of mRNAs through a miRNA-like
  mechanism, and degrade retrotransposon-associated mRNAs.'
