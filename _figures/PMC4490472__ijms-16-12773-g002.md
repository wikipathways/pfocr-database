caption: Regulation of CUL5, JAG-NOTCH, TNKS2, and PTEN-PI3K-AKT cell signaling by
  members of miR-17~92 and miR-106a~363 clusters in cervical cancer. E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complexes formed by CUL5-E2-SOCS-JAK2/3 and CUL1-skp1-skip2-E47-E2 are activated
  by Abs2 and SOCS interchange potentiated through JAG1-NOTCH axis. The cell signaling
  of GS3K-catenin-APC-AXIN-1-TCF/LEF is activated by AXIN-1 inhibition, which triggers
  the JAG1-NOTCH pathway, which in turn accelerates the interchange of SOCS by Abs2.
  Additionally, CUL1-skp1-skip2-E47-E2 is activated by phosphorylation of E47 via
  Ras-Raf-MEK-1-ERK1/2. The miR-19a and miR-19b grouped in the clusters miR17~92 and
  miR106a~363 downregulated CUL5, increasing proliferation, migration, and invasion
  and diminishing apoptosis. MiR-20a, a member of the cluster miR17~92, increases
  TNK2 expression that in turn inhibits AXIN-1, activating TCF/LEF, inducing JAG1-NOTCH1
  signaling. Another member of the clusters miR17~92 and miR106a~363, miR-92, hinders
  PTEN expression, supporting PI3K-PDK1-AKT1 signaling thereby spreading proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and constraining apoptosis. In bold are the miRNAs with effect
  on genes with validated experimental data.
