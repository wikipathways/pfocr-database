caption: Effects of AC in vascular endothelium. Anthocyanins are potent inducers of
  the endothelial formation of NO involving different intracellular signaling pathways.
  Furthermore, AC are able to modulate pro-inflammatory pathway by inhibiting ROS
  and the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB. Indirect mechanisms involved
  in ROS scavenging ability of AC could be also linked to acute activation of antioxidant
  and detoxifying enzymes modulated by Nrf2 transcription factor. ROS reactive oxygen
