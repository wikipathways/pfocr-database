caption: Schematic illustration summarizing the mechanism by which NSUN2 promotes
  colorectal cancer (CRC). NSUN2 is highly expressed in CRC and promotes malignancy
  by interacting with CUL4B to activate the ErbB‐STAT3 signalling pathway in an m5C‐independent
  manner. NSUN2‐mediated elevation of EGFR/HER2 expression enhances the sensitivity
  of CRC to lapatinib
