caption: Final elaboration of 8, the requisite cyclization precursor, entailed treatment
  of 2-butanone (21) with (−)-DIPCl and Et3N according to conditions developed by
  Paterson,, followed by addition of aldehyde (+)-20; cyclization precursor (8) was
  obtained as an inseparable mixture of diastereomers (5:1) in 86% yield (). Treatment
  with camphorsulfonic acid then led to the desired 2,6-trans-tetrahydropyran (+)-22
  in 74%, in conjunction with 14% of the cis-congener (−)-23, the latter resulting
  from cyclization of the undesired C(13) α-hydroxyl epimer formed during the Paterson
  aldol reaction. Separation of (+)-22 and (−)-23 was now possible by flash chromatography
  on silica gel. Of special note, the cyclization proceeded exclusively via the 6-exotet
  pathway, without intervention of 7-endotet manifold, as determined by H NMR analysis.
  Since both processes are viewed as “allowed” vis-à-vis Baldwin rules, the six-membered
  ring transition state, in conjunction with the electron-withdrawing nature of the
  methyl ester that destabilizes cationic character at the α-position, conspire to
  favor reaction at the β-position to generate the required tetrahydropyran ring system.
  Methylation of the resultant secondary hydroxyl utilizing trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate
  with Proton Sponge® as base then furnished (+)-5, the 2,6-trans-tetrahydropyran
  fragment, in 92% yield.
