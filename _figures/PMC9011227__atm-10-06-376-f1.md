caption: Signal transduction mediated by lipid rafts in persistent Hp infection. (A)
  Hp infects the host cell by binding to integrin α5β1 on lipid rafts and injects
  CagA into the host cell to activate the NF-κB/IL-8 signaling pathway and promote
  inflammation. (B) Hp recruits RAGE into the lipid raft to activate the NF-κB/IL-8
  signaling pathway and promote inflammation. (C) The correct assembly of IFNGR subunits
  is dependent on the lipid raft integrity and essential for IFNG/JAK/STAT signal
  transduction. (D) Hp uses CGT to disrupt the structure of the lipid raft on the
  host cell membrane, making IFNGR unable to assemble properly, which in turn frustrates
  IFN-γ signaling, and helps Hp evade inflammatory response. RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycosylation end-products; CagA, cytotoxin-associated protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  IL-8, interleukin 8; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; CGT, cholesterol-α-glucosyltransferase;
  Hp, Helicobacter pylori; IFNGR, interferon-γ receptor.
