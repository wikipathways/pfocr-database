caption: Schematic of TGFβ signaling. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is synthesized
  in a latent form that is incapable of interacting with receptors. After secretion
  and activation, TGFβ interacts with Tgfbr2 and Tgfbr1, initiating serine phosphorylation
  and activation of Tgfbr1. Tgfbr1 then phosphorylates receptor activated Smads (R-Smads)
  such as Smad2 and Smad3. Phosphorylated R-Smads can then hetero-oligomerize with
  co-Smads (e.g., Smad4) and translocate to the nucleus where they interact with cofactors
  to induce transcription. Signaling wanes as a result of adaptation that tracks with
  the nuclear localization of Smad4. TGFβ receptor function can be modulated by accessory
  receptors such as Tgfbr3 and Endoglin and through interactions with modulators such
  as Cripto. The RNA binding protein Msi2 helps control Tgfbr1 mRNA and TGFβ pathway
  signaling.
