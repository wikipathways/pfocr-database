caption: 'γδ T cells: clinical use and antitumor activity. (A) Clinical trials based
  on γδ T cells rely on the Vγ9Vδ2 subset, taking advantage of two distinct approaches,
  in vivo and ex vivo. In vivo stimulation involves N-BPs administration, in combination
  with IL-2, necessary for Vγ9Vδ2 expansion. Adoptive cell transfer (ex vivo approach)
  requires isolating T cells from PBMCs and Vγ9Vδ2 activation by culture with N-BPs
  plus IL-2. Then, the expanded Vγ9Vδ2 cells are reinfused into patients. Furthermore,
  to perform CAR-T cell production, Vγ9Vδ2 are expanded as previously and transduced
  with the specific CAR retrovirus. (B) The cytotoxic mechanisms exerted by γδ T cells,
  triggered upon TCR-dependent antigen recognition, mainly include perforin–granzyme
  pathway, ADCC, IFN-γ and TNF-α production. Abbreviations: N-BPs, nitrogen-containing
  bisphosphonates; IL-2, interleukine-2; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells;
  CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; TCR, T cell receptor; ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity.'
