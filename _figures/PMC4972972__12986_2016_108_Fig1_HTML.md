caption: 'Dual regulation of GSK3 by the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway and PLIN2. Upon Wnt
  stimulation, the axin-GSK3-β-catenin complex (AGβC) is disassembled and the process
  is dependent of PLIN2 (denoted by curvy blue arrows) [1]. The released β-catenin
  from the AGβC complex activates transcription of factors involved in cell growth/survival
  (e.g. c-Myc, c/EBPα, and cyclin D1) or in insulin signaling (e.g. IRS1) [2], whereas
  the released GSK3 from the AGβC complex can be present in cytosol or recycle back
  to the AGβC complex [3]. The GSK3 activity is regulated mainly through the PI3K/Akt
  pathway that relays extracellular and intracellular (not shown) signals; − and + denote
  normal inhibitory and stimulatory signals, respectively, whereas −− and ++ (in red)
  denote over-inhibitory (e.g. the potency of the LY compounds used in (Ref 216))
  and over-stimulatory (e.g. the potency of VEGF used in (Ref 5)) signals, respectively
  [4]. Different stages of kinase insensitivity and uncontrolled GSK3 activation are
  summarized in Table . Under − and −− conditions, the respective pSGSK3 levels are
  reduced but GSK3/pYGSK3 levels are increased (denoted by red blockage between the
  two) [5], perhaps inducing moderate and high activities of GSK3, respectively. Under
  ++ conditions, all the kinases tend to become insensitive (denoted by red blockages),
  generating unbridled GSK3 activity (Table ) that can phosphorylate its substrates
  and render their degradation [6]. Accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets (CLD)
  alters the association of PLIN2 and its binding proteins such as Dishevelled (Dvl),
  β-catenin, c/EBPα, and IRS1 [7]. The bold blue lines denote high affinity between
  PLIN2 and CLD [8]. LRP5/6: lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5/6; Fz, frizzled;
