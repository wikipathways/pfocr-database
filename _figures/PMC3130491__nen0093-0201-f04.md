caption: Schematic of leptin intracellular signaling through the STAT3 and PI3K-PDE3B-cAMP
  pathways in the hypothalamus. Leptin binding to its receptor (Ob-Rb) induces activation
  of JAK2, receptor dimerization, and JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of intracellular
  part of Ob-Rb, followed by phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. Activated STAT3
  dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus and transactivates target genes including
  SOCS3, NPY and POMC. Our evidence suggests that leptin also activates PI3K and PDE3B,
  and reduces cAMP levels. Decrease in cAMP levels appears to be important for STAT3
  activation by leptin, because PDE3 inhibition reverses this effect of leptin in
  the hypothalamus. Also, leptin-induced PDE3B activation-dependent decrease in cAMP
  levels may directly modify (increase or decrease) expression of POMC, NT, NPY and
  other genes – a hypothesis needs to be experimentally tested. SOCS3 acts as a negative
  regulator of both the STAT3 and PI3K pathways of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus,
  a mechanism that plays a significant role in the development of central leptin resistance
  and DIO. Other pathways such as SHP2, MAPK/ERK, AMPK, and mTOR pathways and PTP1B
  that are known to play a role in regulating leptin action and leptin resistance
  in the hypothalamus have been left out to simplify the figure [modified from []].
