caption: 'Modified from Guzman et al. Cannabinoids: Potential anticancer agents. Nat
  Rev Cancer. Mechanism activated by the receptor of human cannabinoids 1 (CB1R),
  ranging from binding to G-protein-coupled receptors (Gi/o) with inhibition of the
  adenylyl cyclase (AdeC), and therefore of the cyclicAMP (cAMP) and of the protein
  kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC); release of
  Ca2+ from intracellular stores; activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)–AKT pathway; activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades as extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and ceramide generation through
  FAN–sphingomyelinase (factor associated with neutral sphingomyelinase activation–SMase).'
