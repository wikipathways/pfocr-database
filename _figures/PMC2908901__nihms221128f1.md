caption: Schematic presentation of labeling in glutamate, glutamine and GABA from
  [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate. Most of the [4-13C]glutamate observed is synthesized
  from [1-13C]glucose and located in glutamatergic neurons; it can also be generated
  from [4-13C]glutamine from astrocytes (A). Glutamatergic neurons release [4-13C]glutamate
  which can be converted to [4-13C]glutamine in astrocytes, which also can synthesize
  [4-13C]glutamate via their own TCA cycle (B). [1,2-13C]acetate is metabolized only
  in astrocytes and [4,5-13C]glutamine can be formed (C) which may be converted to
  [4,5-13C]glutamate in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (C). The latter can convert
  this glutamate to [1,2-13C]GABA (C). In GABAergic neurons [2-13C]GABA is formed
  from [1-13C]glucose (D). Interpretation of the results obtained from 13C MRS is
  based on the different metabolic fates of [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate (Figure
  1). [1-13C]glucose enters both astrocytes and neurons approximately equally () and
  is transformed via glycolysis to [3-13C]pyruvate (Figure 1). The latter can be transported
  into mitochondria to enter the TCA cycle as acetyl CoA or be converted to lactate,
  mostly in astrocytes, to be transported to neurons (, ). In neurons lactate can
  be oxidized to pyruvate and then be converted to [2-13C]acetyl CoA and enter the
  TCA cycle. Approximately 70% of the acetyl CoA from glucose used for glutamate synthesis
  in the brain is metabolized in neurons and 30 % in astrocytes (, ). After several
  steps, [4-13C]glutamate is formed (Figure 1 A,B,D). In principal, some neuronal
  [4-13C]glutamate could be derived from [4-13C]glutamine synthesized in astrocytes
  from [1-13C]glucose (1B). However,  showed that [4-13C]glutamate formation was not
  impaired when astrocytic TCA cycle activity was stopped. In GABAergic neurons, [2-13C]GABA
  can be formed from [1-13C]glucose (Figure 1D). In astrocytes, [4-13C]glutamine can
  be synthesized from [1-13C]glucose (Figure 1B), but as just noted, this is apparently
  not a significant precursor of neuronal glutamate. In contrast, [4-13C]glutamate
  that is taken up by astrocytes, following release from neurons, can be used to synthesize
  [4-13C]glutamine (Figure 1B), and approximately 40% of [4-13C]glutamine is derived
  via this pathway (). Astrocytes can also convert [1,2-13C]acetate directly to [1,2-13C]acetyl
  CoA, and after several steps, produce [4,5-13C]glutamate and [4,5-13C]glutamine
  (Figure 1C). The [4,5-13C]glutamine is released and can be converted to [4,5-13C]glutamate
  in neurons. In GABAergic neurons this glutamate can be decarboxylated to [1,2-13C]GABA
  (Figure 1C). For simplicity only first turn isotopomers are shown in Figure 1. If
  α-[4-13C]ketoglutarate stays in the TCA cycle, [3-13C]/[2-13C]glutamate can be formed.
  For details on the isotopomers derived from the second turn see ().
