caption: Signal transduction by the HER family promotes proliferation, survival, and
  invasiveness. The complexity of signaling pathways initiated by, and influenced
  by, HER-family protein receptors at the cell surface. Multiple ligands can be recruited
  by HER-family receptors HER1 (pink), HER3 (blue), and HER4 (green), and an extensive
  network of signaling pathways can be initiated. HER2 (orange) has no known ligand
  but dimerizes with ligand-bound HER1, HER3, and HER4. Products of one signaling
  pathway may often be activators, or even inhibitors, of members from other pathways.
  The biologic outcome of these pathways is cell survival, growth, migration, differentiation,
  and inhibition of apoptosis. Reprinted with permission from Ross et al.
