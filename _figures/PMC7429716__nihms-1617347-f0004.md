caption: G2/M checkpoint signaling pathway. ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related)
  is activated by single stranded DNA damages or replication stress and phosphorylates
  CHK1. Upon phosphorylation, CHK1 is activated and subsequently activates WEE1 via
  phosphorylation. Simultaneously, CHK1 phosphorylates and inactivates the CDC25A
  and CDC25C phosphatases. Activated WEE1 then phosphorylates CDK1 and CDK2 to promote
  G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest.
papertitle: Restored replication fork stabilization, a mechanism of PARP inhibitor
  resistance, can be overcome by cell cycle checkpoint inhibition.
