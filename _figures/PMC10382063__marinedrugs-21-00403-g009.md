caption: Gene expression profiles of heme synthesis pathways in mutant strains of
  Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 based on the overexpression of 12 heme synthesis genes
  from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and 10 heme synthesis genes from Synechococcus elongatus
  PCC 7942. The colour of the scale in the graph indicates the degree of up- and down-regulation
  of the gene. We used −ΔΔCt (−9 to 9) values corresponding to the colour of the scale
  (red indicates up-regulation, blue indicates down-regulation). The higher the value,
  the redder the colour, the higher the degree of gene upregulation. The lower the
  value, the darker the blue colour, the higher the degree of gene downregulation.
  Each cell of the table on the scale corresponds to a mutant strain (names are indicated
  in the table). The table next to each gene corresponds to the expression of this
  gene in the 22 mutant strains.
