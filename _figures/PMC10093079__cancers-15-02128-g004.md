caption: Effect of Baicalein on different signaling pathways. The schematic view represents
  the molecular mechanisms of Baicalein inhibiting cell proliferation through the
  Notch/Hes pathway. Cells undergo apoptosis following the treatment of Baicalein,
  which hampers the signal transduction between Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways.
  CSCs lose their self-replicating feature after Baicalein treatment, downregulating
  the Shh receptor and effectors.
