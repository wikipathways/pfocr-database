caption: 'Vitamin D Pathways: An Overview (source: Nutrients 2016, 8, 319) []. The
  conversion of vitamin D to the active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D, is shown. The pathway
  starts with the exposure of vitamin D from dietary sources or via cutaneous synthesis
  following UVB radiation. Vitamin D is bound to VDBP and transported to the liver
  where it is converted to 25(OH)D, the current biomarker for vitamin D status. PTH
  enhances 1-alpha hydroxylase in the kidneys which is responsible for the conversion
  of the inactive metabolite, 25(OH)D, to the active metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D. The entire
  pathway is tightly regulated via catabolic and feedback loop processes as shown'
