caption: TGF-β signaling pathways. TGF-βs signal by binding to a specific, heteromeric
  complex that includes types I and II kinase receptors (TβRI/ALK-5 and TβRII, respectively).
  In most cells, TGF-β binds to a complex of TβRII and TβRI/ALK-5 complex, but in
  endothelial cells, they can also bind to a complex of TβRII and ALK-1. The coreceptor
  endoglin inhibits TGF-β binding to the TβRII-ALK-5 complex and promotes TGF-β binding
  to the TβRII-ALK-1 complex, thus activating ALK-1 signaling. In a similar manner,
  bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also bind to complexes of two types of receptors—that
  is, the type I receptors ALK-1, -2, -3, or -6, and the type II receptors BMPRII,
  ActRIIA, or ActRIIB. Intracellular signaling through Smad activation can be divided
  into two pathways. In one pathway, ALK-5 phosphorylates, and thus activates, Smad2
  and Smad3, and in the other one, ALK-1, -2, -3, and -6 activate Smad1, Smad5, and
  Smad8. These receptor-activated Smads form heteromeric complexes with the common
  mediator Smad, Smad4. These complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they act
  as transcription factor complexes and regulate the expression of specific target
  genes.
