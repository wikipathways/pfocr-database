caption: Autophagy in the defense against cellular proteotoxicity. (A) Soluble cytosolic
  proteins can normally undergo selective degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome
  system (UPS) or in the lysosome via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). (B) Once
  proteins organize into abnormal protein complexes (protein oligomers or aggregates),
  they are no longer amenable for degradation through the above-mentioned pathways,which
  require complete unfolding of the protein substrate before degradation. Aggregated
  pathogenic proteins [mutant tau, α-synuclein and huntingtin (htt) are depicted here]
  can only be removed from the cytosol by macroautophagy. The presence of these pathogenic
  proteins can affect functioning of the different proteolytic systems. Mutant forms
  of α-synuclein and tau, for example, have been shown to directly inhibit the proteolytic
  activity of the UPS (a). In addition, the inability of these mutant proteins to
  cross the lysosomal membrane when targeted to lysosomes via CMA results in blockage
  of this autophagic pathway (b). Pathogenic forms of htt have been shown to diminish
  normal macroautophagy activity by directly interfering with the recognition of cargo
  by the limiting autophagosome membrane, giving instead rise to ‘empty’ autophagosomes
  (APGs) (c). Later steps in macroautophagy, for example, APG trafficking or autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion (d), are also susceptible to the effect of pathogenic proteins.
