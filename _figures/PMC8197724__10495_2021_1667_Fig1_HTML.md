caption: Apoptosis pathways. The death receptor and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis
  are shown. The mitochondrial pathway is activated by developmental cues, the endoplasmic
  reticulum, or other stimuli. These stimuli trigger the BH3-only proteins, which
  then inhibit the BCL-2-like pro-survival proteins. The inhibition of the BCL-2-like
  pro-survival proteins leads to the activation of BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX)
  and/or BCL-2 antagonist/killer (BAK). Activated BAX or BAK oligomerizes and forms
  pores to cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in
  the release of apoptogenic molecules, including second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspases (SMAC), serine protease OMI, and cytochrome c from the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds apoptotic protease-activating
  factor 1 (APAF 1) in the cytosol to form the apoptosome, which serves as a platform
  for the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates the effector caspases
  (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), which leads to cell demolition. Caspase activation
  can be blocked by the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which in turn
  is inhibited by the released SMAC and OMI proteins from the mitochondria. The death
  receptor pathway is activated when the ligands of the tumor necrosis factor family
  bind to their respective death receptors on the cell membrane. This results in cleavage
  of caspase-8, leading to the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6,
  and caspase-7) and cellular destruction. Death receptor signaling can also result
  in BID cleavage by caspase-8, leading to the generation of active tBID, which then
  engages the mitochondrial pathway
