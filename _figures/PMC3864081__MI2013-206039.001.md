caption: DAMP signaling through different PRRs. TLR activation by DAMPS triggers adaptor
  proteins MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP, or TRAM to activate various transcriptions factors.
  The subsequent translocation of NF-κB and MAPK leads to the production of several
  proinflammatory cytokines. TRIF-dependent activation of transcription factors IRF3
  and IRF7 results in the induction of type I interferon. Additionally, the TLR- NF-κB
  pathway can induce the transcription of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and other components
  of the inflammasome pathway. Inflammasome activation is considered to depend on
  two distinct signals. The first signal via TLR and this might be the rate limiting
  step for inflammasome assembly and activity; the second signal via NLR which is
  responsible for inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and secretion of IL-1β
  and IL-18. Activation of NOD receptors results in activation of the NF-κB pathway.
