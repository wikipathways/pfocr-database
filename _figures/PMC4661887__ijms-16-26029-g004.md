caption: Potential mechanism of action of soy peptides in HepG2 cells. Upon cell penetration,
  they act as competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCoAR)
  leading to an intracellular cholesterol synthesis reduction. The consequence is
  the activation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding proteins
  (SREBP) 2, which leads to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and HMGCoAR genes
  transcription, with subsequent increase of LDLR and HMGCoAR protein levels and LDLR
  localization in plasma membrane (a); In parallel, soy peptides reduce cholesterol
  production also by activation of the monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  pathway through an increase of phosphorylation at Thr-172, which in turn inactivates
  its target substrate HMGCoAR through phosphorylation at serine-872 and produces
  an increase of the activity of glucose transporters (b); IAVPGEVA, IAVPTGVA and
  LPYP enhance Akt activation, through an increase of phosphorylation at Ser473, which
  in turn inactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 αβ (GSK3αβ), a kinase that contributes
  to proteasomal degradation of SREBP2 [,,]. Moreover, GSK3αβ, inactivated by Akt
  phosphorylation at Ser21/9, does not inhibit glycogen synthase (its substrate) that
  can convert the increased up-taken glucose in intracellular glycogen (c); Finally,
  extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 pathway activation [] could lead
  to stabilization of mRNA levels of LDLR contributing to increase LDLR protein levels
  in plasma membrane (d). Thus, the distinct modulation of four pathways leads to
  an increased LDLR activity, which can bind and carry extracellular LDL in HepG2
  cells with final hypocholesterolemic effects. Moreover, Akt and AMPK pathway activations
  are correlated with glucose metabolism modulation, which leads to an increase of
  glucose-uptake by human hepatic cells.
