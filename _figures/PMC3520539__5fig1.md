caption: A generalized overview of the regulation of apoptosis by sphingolipids. Sphingolipids
  have direct effects on mitochondrial function. Ceramide (Cer) assembles channels
  in the outer membrane of mitochondria to promote the release of cytochrome c (cyt
  c) for caspase-9 activation. Dihydroceramide (dHCer) inhibits ceramide channel formation.
  Similarly, the ganglioside GD3 permeabilizes mitochondria in a ROS and calcium-dependent
  manner. Additionally, Cer directly inhibits mitochondrial complex III to generate
  ROS. Cer promotes Bax activation and recruitment to the mitochondria through the
  PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of Bax and formation of mitochondrial ceramide-rich
  macrodomains (MCRMs). Furthermore, mitochondrial Cer is metabolized to S1P and hexadecenal
  (hex), which directly activate Bax and Bak, respectively. i) Lysosomal effects.
  Cer directly binds and activates the lysosomal protease cathepsin D to enhance Bid
  cleavage and induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. At low to moderate
  concentrations, sphingosine (Sph) becomes protonated and trapped within lysosomes,
  leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and cleavage of Bid for the
  induction of apoptosis. ii) Bcl-2 family. Sph downregulates antiapoptotic Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL to promote apoptosis. Cer activates PP1 and PP2A to regulate the alternative
  splicing of apoptosis-promoting variants Bcl-xS and Caspase-9 and inhibit the antiapoptotic
  effects of Bcl-2, respectively. iii) Kinase signaling. Cer directly activates protein
  kinase C ζ (PKCζ), which mediates the activation of JNK and inhibition of Akt to
  promote apoptosis. S1P suppresses Cer-mediated activation of JNK and activates pro-survival
  Akt/mTORC1, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB signaling pathways through cell surface receptors.
  Sph-induced apoptosis is characterized by suppression of MAPK/ERK signaling, while
  gangliosides enhance apoptosis through the inhibition of NF-κB.

  description: A generalized overview of the regulation of apoptosis by sphingolipids.
    Sphingolipids have direct effects on mitochondrial function. Ceramide (Cer) assembles
    channels in the outer membrane of mitochondria to promote the release of cytochrome
    c (cyt c) for caspase-9 activation. Dihydroceramide (dHCer) inhibits ceramide

    complex III to generate ROS. Cer promotes Bax activation and recruitment to the
    mitochondria through the PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of Bax and formation
    of mitochondrial ceramide-rich macrodomains (MCRMs). Furthermore, mitochondrial
    Cer is metabolized to S1P and hexadecenal (hex), which directly activate Bax and
    Bak, respectively. i) Lysosomal effects. Cer directly binds and activates the
    lysosomal protease cathepsin D to enhance Bid cleavage and induction of the mitochondrial
