caption: Suppressive activity of MDSCs induced by the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways.
  The NF-κB pathway activated by TLR2/4 induces the expression of inflammatory factors
  (IL-6 and TNF-α). In turn, IL-6 and TNF-α activate the STAT3 signaling pathway and
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. Notably, STAT3 regulates the expression of the inflammatory
  factors, S100A8 and S100A9, which act as TLR4 ligands to activate the NF-κB pathway,
  resulting in upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-α expression, and they form a loop that
  enhances the expansion and activation of MDSCs. In addition, TLR2/JUK signals induce
  an M1-like macrophage phenotype and decrease the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs,
  whereas transcription factors for the differentiation to M1 macrophages or decreasing
  frequency on MDSC are unclear. TLR, Toll-like receptor; BLP, bacterial lipoprotein;
