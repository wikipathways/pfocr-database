caption: Schematic of the hypothesized signaling pathway whereby V–H-ATPase (V-ATPase),
  mTORC1, and mTORC2 increase due to shear stress. (a) Shear stress activates integrin,
  which causes a rise in F-actin polymerization, stimulating increased transport of
  acidic vesicles to the plasma membrane by molecular motors. Such vesicles can transport
  integrins and V-ATPase pumps to the plasma membrane upon fusion; mTORC1 is additionally
  activated on lysosome membranes. mTORC2 is likely to be activated by Rac1, which
  is stimulated by V-ATPase. (b) Inhibiting V-ATPase with BAF can decrease F-actin
  polymerization and stability. Inhibition also disrupts acidic vesicles, whose transport
  to the plasma membrane is reduced due to decreased polymerized actin, resulting
  in fewer V-ATPase pumps and integrins at the plasma membrane, and reduced mTORC1
  and mTORC2 activity.
