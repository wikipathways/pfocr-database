caption: 'Synovial membrane and bone interactions in rheumatoid arthritis. The inflamed
  synovium produces inflammatory mediators that enhance osteoclastogenesis, mostly
  by the upregulation of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), leading to
  articular bone erosions development. In addition, osteoclasts as well as their precursors
  can be directly activated by anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) present
  long before during the pre-clinical phase of the disease. Osteoblast differentiation,
  on the other hand, is inhibited by antagonists of the Wnt signaling pathway, including
  Dickkopf (DKK-1) and sclerostin, preventing erosion repair. ACPA: Anti-citrullinated
  peptide antibodies; ATX: Autotaxin; DKK-1: Dickkopf related protein 1; IFN: Interferon;
  IL: Interleukine; LPA: Lysophosphatidic acid; LPC: Lysophosphatidylcholine; M-CSF:
  Macrophage colony-stimulating factor; OPG: Osteoprotegerin; RANK: Receptor activator
  of nuclear factor kappa B; RANKL: RANK ligand; TNF: Tumor necrosis factor; Th: T-cell;
  dashed triangle arrowheads: Secretion; simple triangle arrowheads: Chemical reaction;
