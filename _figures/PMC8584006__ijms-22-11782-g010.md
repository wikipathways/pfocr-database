caption: Schematic diagram of representative DEPs and DEPPs in metabolic pathways
  during fruit-ripening. (A) Respiratory chain, (B) Carotenoid biosynthesis, (C) Flavonoid
  biosynthesis, (D) α-linolenic acid metabolism, (E) Terpenoid synthesis, (F) Phenylalanine,
  tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, (G) Fatty acid metabolism, (H) Photosynthesis,
  (I) Ribosome assembly, (J) Photosynthesis (Phosphoproteomic), (K) AGE-RAGE signaling
  pathway, (L) MAPK signaling pathway, (M) Ribosome assembly (Phosphoproteomic). The
  metabolic pathways are constructed from on proteomics and phosphoproteomics data.
  The red fonts represent up-regulation, green fonts represent down-regulation.
