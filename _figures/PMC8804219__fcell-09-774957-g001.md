caption: Regulatory networks and signaling pathways associated with ferroptosis. Ferroptosis
  is primarily activated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and redox perturbation,
  which mainly occurs through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent
  pathway, and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. (A) The cyst(e)ine/GSH/GPX4
  antioxidative axis. (B) The mevalonate pathway (IPP/FSP1/CoQ10 system). (C) NRF2-regulated
  ARE defence. (D) The glutaminolysis pathway. (E) The lipid peroxidation process;
  (F) The absorption, export, storage and utilization of iron. (G) The autophagy cascade.
  (H) The EMT-related pathway. Processes favoring or counteracting ferroptotic cell
  death are labeled with red and green arrows, respectively (Cys2, cystine; Cys, cysteine;
  Glu, glutamate; Gly, glycine Gln, glutamine; BCNU, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea;
  CoQ10H2, ubiquinol; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A; GSR, glutathione-disulfide
  reductase; BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene).
