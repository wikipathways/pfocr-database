caption: Schematic Model Illustrating the Potential Role of JA Signaling Pathways
  in Modulating the Magnitude of O3-Induced, SA-Mediated Responses.Both SA and JA
  signaling pathways are activated in response to O3 exposure. JA signaling can attenuate
  the magnitude of the O3-induced oxidative burst (upstream of SA accumulation; step
  1) and SA-mediated HR cell death pathway (downstream of SA accumulation; step 2).
  Therefore, plant resistance to oxidative stress stimuli is dependent on SA and JA
  signaling pathways that then act antagonistically; this allows plants to modulate
  the relative amount of SA- and JA-inducible defenses, including cell death, as a
  function of time in response to a specific stress.
