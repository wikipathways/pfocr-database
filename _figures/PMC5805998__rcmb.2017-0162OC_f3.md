caption: Functional enrichment of combined differentially expressed gene list in severe
  asthma across all tissues. (A) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with arbitrary colors
  assigned to biological GO terms. Defense response and immune system process were
  assigned the same color owing to a large overlap in genes in these terms. GO terms
  with false discovery rate (FDR)–corrected P less than 0.05 were collapsed into categories
  of related terms using REVIGO, where –Log10 P values were considered significant.
  A red line indicating P less than 0.05 is shown here. (B) Protein interaction network
  representing the interactions of the protein products of differentially expressed
  genes. The size of the node is reflective of the number of interactions, and the
  color key indicates upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) compared with healthy
  controls. Triangles, squares, and circles represent BAL, epithelium, and sputum,
  respectively. Functionally related genes are grouped into colors reflecting their
  respective GO terms from A. Toll-like receptor signaling Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes pathway (FDR-corrected P < 0.05) is indicated with a dashed line.
