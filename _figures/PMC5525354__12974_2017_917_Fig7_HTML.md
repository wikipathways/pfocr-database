caption: Schematic illustrating the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of ω-3 PUFA
  supplementation after TBI. As illustrated, TBI-induced microglial activation initiates
  a neuron-glia neuroinflammatory response by producing a wide array of proinflammatory
  factors or mediators such as TNF, IL, and IFN. Under inflammatory conditions, elevated
  HMGB1 binds to transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce further release
  of inflammatory cytokines. Supplementation with ω-3 PUFA inhibited TBI-induced microglial
  activation and the subsequent inflammatory response and also facilitated neuronal
  recovery through inhibition of HMGB1 translocation and release, and HMGB1-mediated
  activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway

  inflammation by inhibiting the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway following experimental traumatic
  brain injury.
