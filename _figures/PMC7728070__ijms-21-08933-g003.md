caption: Modulating the autophagic machinery in vascular calcification. A high Pi
  environment promotes vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. This pro-calcific
  environment increases the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
  as well as O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The latter enhances YAP glycosylation. Additionally,
  epigenetic regulation of mTOR activity is also affected by the high Pi environment.
  Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is downregulated, while lysine-specific histone demethylase
  A1 (LSD1) is upregulated, resulting in enhanced mTOR activity. Both the increase
  in glycosylated (Glc) YAP and mTOR activity inhibit autophagy, facilitating VSMC
  calcification. Therefore, direct or AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTOR, through the
  use of different pharmacological agents, alleviates mTOR-dependent suppression of
  autophagy and ameliorates VSMC calcification. Saturated fatty acids, which are present
  in the pro-calcific environment, as seen in patients with chronic kidney disease,
  inhibit autophagy and are shown to facilitate VSMC calcification. Stimulation of
  autophagy with various pharmacological agents has been shown to attenuate VSMC calcification.
  Lastly, BNIP3-mediated mitophagy plays an important role in VSMC calcification,
  as inhibition of this pathway with lactate, promotes mineralization. AMPK = AMP-activated
  kinase, mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin, HDAC1 = Histone deacetylase 1, LSD1
  = Lysine-specific histone demethylase A1, OGT = O-GlcNAc transferase, Glc = Glycosylated,
  YAP = Yes-associated protein, BNIP3 = BCL2 and adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting
  protein 3, ANCR = anti-differentiation non-coding RNA.
