caption: 'A. Canonical Wnt signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal (left side),
  the multiprotein complex assembled on axin and APC (the adenomatous polyposis coli
  gene product) includes active GSK-3 and β-catenin. GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin
  (the transcriptional co-activator that, together with the Tcf family of transcription
  factors regulates Wnt-dependent gene expression). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by
  GSK-3 leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin by the proteasome,
  preventing gene expression. In the presence of a Wnt signal (right side), GSK-3
  is re-directed to the LRP5/6 coreceptor via a somewhat unclear mechanism involving
  disheveled (Dvl). β-catenin is stabilized, and then translocates to the nucleus
  where it displaces transcriptional repressors (Groucho family) from Tcf/Lef, leading
  to gene expression. Wnt-dependent genes regulate a host of processes from carcinogenesis
  to cardiac hypertrophy []. An alternative mechanism to inhibit GSK-3 in this setting
  is mediated by p38 [, ].B. Growth factor signaling: Insulin as an example. Following
  growth factor binding to cognate receptors, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated, leading
  to inhibition of GSK-3. GSK-3 negatively regulates a host of factors downstream
  of growth factor receptors, so the consequences of GSK-3 inhibition are activation
  of these factors including: 1) glycogen synthase, leading to increased glycogen
  storage, 2) D- and E-type cyclins that promote cell cycle progression, 3) Myc, which
  also promotes cell cycle progression as well as regulating metabolic status of the
  cardiomyocyte, 4) mTORC1 which regulates protein synthesis and, secondarily, cell
  growth via interactions with a number of factors (2 are shown). In the heart, GSK-3α
  appears to be the dominant negative regulator of mTOR activity. Also shown is AMPK,
  the master energy sensor in the cell, that, in the presence of reduced energy stores,
  phosphorylates mTOR, priming it for further inhibitory phosphorylation by GSK-3.C.
  β-adrenergic responsiveness. In the setting of stress, the β-adrenergic receptor
  (β-AR) is activated leading to increased cAMP and activation of PKA, which increases
  contractility in part by phosphorylating and inhibiting phospholamban, thereby activating
  SERCA2a. GSK-3α, via unclear mechanisms, amplifies the response by enhancing cAMP
  production. The enhanced PKA signaling eventually provides a negative feedback to
  inhibit GSK-3α, terminating the β-AR signal.D. Hypertrophic signaling. Numerous
  hypertrophic stimuli (e.g. angiotensin II, α–adrenergic agonists, cell stretch,
  etc.) work through increasing Ca2+ and, in some cases, activating Akt to lead to
  inhibition of GSK-3. Increased Ca2+ activates calcineurin which de-phosphorylates
  NF-AT family members, allowing NF-ATs to translocate to the nucleus and activate
  hypertrophic gene expression. GSK-3 antagonizes hypertrophic signaling by phosphorylating
  NF-ATs, leading to their exclusion from the nucleus. CaMKII (not shown) promotes
  hypertrophy via a variety of effectors, but it is unclear at this point whether
  there is cross-talk between CaMKII and GSK-3.'
