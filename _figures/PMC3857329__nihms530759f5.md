caption: As discussed in the preceding sections, the catalytic activation method using
  HNTf2 allows efficient borylation with optimal substrates such as 22. In other,
  less hindered aliphatic examples, the catalytic process does not go to completion,
  suggesting some form of product inhibition of the catalytic cycle, or a dead end
  decomposition pathway perhaps involving the product borenium cations. The reasons
  for this behavior remain unexplained in the aliphatic borylations, and the potential
  for retrohydroboration may be partly responsible for unknown decomposition or disproportionation
  events that interfere with catalyst turnover. On the other hand, aromatic borylations
  should be less prone to complications under catalytic conditions. The product borenium
  cations are somewhat more stabilized due to their “bora-benzylic” nature, involving
  delocalization between the aromatic π-system and the planar tricoordinate boron.
  Furthermore, the aromatic borylation products are incapable of undergoing retrohydroboration.
  Based on these considerations, we tested the catalytic activation method with the
  simple N,N-dimethylbenzylamine borane 1 (), and were pleased to find that >90% of
  the known borylation product 37 was formed after reductive quenching. Evidently,
  an efficient catalytic cycle is possible.
