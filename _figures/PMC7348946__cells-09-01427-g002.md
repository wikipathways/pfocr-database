caption: A simplified overview of the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways in T cells.
  CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for ligand binding, switching off immune response activation.
  Upon binding to its specific ligands, the homodimerization of CTLA-4 induces SHP2
  dependent dephosphorylation of specific TCR proximal proteins, such as CD3, suppressing
  the activation of immune response. CTLA-4 binding induces association with PP2A,
  resulting in CTLA-4-dependent AKT signaling pathway inhibition. CTLA-4 binding may
  also induce association with phosphatase SHP2, which dephosphorylates CD28, thus
  preventing recruitment of PI3K, activation of AKT, and inhibition of GSK-3β, leading
  to a reduction in T cell activation.
