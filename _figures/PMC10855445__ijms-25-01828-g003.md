caption: The interaction between ALR, NLR, and cGLR (cGAS/STING signaling pathway).
  AIM-2 (an ALR) activation in response to the cytosolic DNA in non-myeloid cells
  inhibits cGAS/STING signaling activation by causing an increased K+ efflux that
  is dispensable in human myeloid cells. AIM-2 activation induces caspase 1 activation
  to induce the generation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and gasdermin-D
  channel formation for K+ efflux. In human myeloid cells, cGAS/STING activation in
  response to the cytosolic dsDNA induces K+ efflux upstream of NLRP3 activation,
  which involves STING trafficking to the lysosome and LCD. cGAS/STING/NLRP3 signaling
  axis activation been observed during HSV-1 infection, where STING-dependent type
  1 IFNs are not produced, and instead NLRP3-dependent IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin
  formation occurs, causing pyroptosis. Chitin-derived polysaccharide adjuvants also
  activate the cGAS/STING/NLRP3 signaling axis by increasing mitochondrial ROS generation.
  NLRC3 activation in response to palmitic acid blocks cGAS//STING signaling by activating
  p38MAP and USP21. NLRX1 residing on the outer mitochondrial membrane also inhibits
  cGAS/STING signaling by directly interacting with STING and blocking TBK1 activation
  and the downstream type 1 IFN signaling pathway. Details are mentioned in the text
