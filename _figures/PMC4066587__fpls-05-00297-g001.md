caption: Overview of stomatal development. The stomatal lineage initiates from meristemoid
  mother cells (MMCs). MMC undergoes asymmetric entry divisions and produces a meristemoid
  (M) as well as a larger sister cell (termed a stomatal lineage ground cell, SLGC).
  Meristemoids can undergo asymmetric amplifying divisions before differentiating
  into a guard mother cell (GMC). SLGCs can differentiate into a pavement cells or
  reacquire a MMC fate and initiate asymmetric spacing divisions that produce “satellite
  meristemoids.” Stomatal complexes form after at least one unequal division of a
  stem cell, and then by a single equal division of a GMC. SPCH, MUTE, FAMA, and FLP/MYB88
  are transcription factors that regulate key fate transitions during stomatal development.
  SCRM and SCRM2 heterodimerize with SPCH, MUTE, and FAMA to promote stomatal–lineage
  transitions. AGO1 is involved in an AGL16-mediated microRNA post-transcriptional
  regulatory pathway that blocks asymmetric spacing divisions in SLGCs. ABA might
  be involved in stomatal initiation and differentiation by repressing SPCH and MUTE.
  RBR activity is predominantly regulated by CDKA;1. RBR participates in the regulation
  of asymmetric as well as symmetric divisions.
