caption: Overview of oxidative stress and antioxidants in the context of non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The pathogenesis of NAFLD is a multifactorial process
  involving several mechanisms, ultimately leading to a disturbed redox balance. Impairment
  of lipid metabolism, e.g., by excessive dietary intake of fat and carbohydrates,
  leads to steatosis. This can be aggravated by insulin resistance. Free fatty acids
  (imported by, e.g., CD36 or FAT) such as palmitate cause lipotoxicity by increasing
  the levels of toxic lipid species such as ceramides and diacylglycerols (DAG). Mitochondrial
  dysfunction, impairment of β-oxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can
  all increase the generation of ROS leading to lipid peroxidation. ER stress induces
  the UPR, i.e., Unfolded Protein Response. Sustained ER stress and sustained activation
  of the UPR will trigger activation of the ER stress proteins PERK, ATF6, ATF4, and
  CHOP, leading to a proinflammatory response and activation of cell death pathways
  in hepatocytes. ER stress might lead to the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1C (SREBP1c) and further translocation to the nucleus, thus promoting hepatic
  lipogenesis. The impaired redox balance also affects the antioxidant response (e.g.,
  the Nrf2 pathway) and leads to decreased levels of antioxidants (e.g., GSH and SOD).
