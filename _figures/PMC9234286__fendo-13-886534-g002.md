caption: Cellular roles of RhoA/ROCK signaling in white, beige and brown adipocyte
  differentiation. (A) Schematic representation of RhoA/ROCK pathway which negatively
  regulates adipocyte differentiation. RhoA/ROCK signaling-cascade activation can
  be induced by many risk-factors including mechanical stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  inflammation, ROS, aging, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, etc. Activated pathway
  causes actin polymerization and formation of stress fibers, leading to nuclear translocation
  of MRTF and suppression of PPARγ activity. (B) Schematic representation of the regulation
  of cell fate determination of mesenchymal stem cells by RhoA/ROCK pathway. Activation
  of RhoA/ROCK signaling by local mechanical stresses and environment factors promotes
  the commitment to osteogenic versus adipogenic lineages of bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells and adipose tissue-derived stem cells. RhoA/ROCK activation also promotes
  the commitment to smooth muscle cell-like and fibrogenic lineages versus adipogenic
  lineage of perivascular progenitors. Moreover, RhoA/ROCK activation favors a switch
  toward myogenesis versus brown adipogenesis of common mesenchymal precursors, and
  a switch toward cardiomyocytes versus beige adipocytes of embryonic cardiac progenitors.
  Finally, RhoA/ROCK activation negatively regulates preadipocyte differentiation
  towards white and beige adipocytes, and transdifferentiation of white adipocytes
  to beige adipocytes. (Figure is created with BioRender.com).
