caption: Metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment. Metabolic reprogramming
  in the TME is a hallmark of cancer biology, where cancer cells and surrounding cells
  undergo significant metabolic changes to support tumor growth and survival. This
  process involves the redirection of nutrients and metabolic pathways to fuel the
  energy-demanding processes of cancer cells. (A) Schematic representation of glycolytic
  metabolic pathway. (B) Schematic representation of change of fatty acid oxidation.
  (C) Schematic representation of change of amino acid metabolism
