caption: (A) The mammalian apoptosis pathway downstream of mitochondria. Mitochondria
  release IAP-antagonists and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) which trigger caspase activation
  and apoptosis. The apoptosome is composed of Apaf−1, Cyt c and Caspase−9. Activated
  Caspase−3 also activates calcium-independent Phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) which generates
  Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) for AiP.(B) The Drosophila apoptosis pathway. The IAP antagonists
  Reaper, Hid and Grim are localized at mitochondria and trigger apoptosis from there.
  The Drosophila apoptosome is composed of Dronc and Dark. Cyt c is not involved in
  Drosophila apoptosis. Homologous proteins to the mammalian apoptosis pathway have
  the same color as in (A).(C) The undead AiP pathway in Drosophila. Expression of
  P35 inhibits the effector caspases DrICE and Dcp−1, thus blocking apoptosis. Dronc
  is not affected by P35 and can activate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling which
  releases the mitogens Wingless (Wg), Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Spitz (Spi) for AiP.
