caption: A proposed model demonstrating the role of BART3-3p in EBVaGC. Senescence-inducing
  triggers, such as mutant oncogenes (RASG12V) or chemotherapeutic drugs, can induce
  GC cell senescence. Meanwhile, the senescent GC cells secrete SASP factors that
  can recruit immune cells to inhibit GC progression. In EBVaGC, the same triggers
  also induce BART3-3p expression, and BART3-3p can inhibit senescence through inhibiting
  p53/p21/PTEN. Consequently, cell senescence is kept at a low level in the EBVaGC
  cells, which normally have WT TP53. Lower levels of SASP secretion imply lower levels
  of immune attack. Altogether, BART3-3p promotes tumor progression in EBVaGC through
  inhibiting the senescence pathway.
