caption: The regulatory network of ferroptosis. PHKG2, IREB2, and CISD1 play an important
  role in ferroptosis by their function in iron metabolism balance. The phosphorylation
  of HSP27 induces ferroptosis resistance through blocking cytoskeleton-mediated iron
  absorption. EGLN1 can upregulate LSH expression by limiting HIF 1α. LSH inhibits
  ferroptosis by affecting metabolism-associated genes including SCD1, GLUT1, and
  FADS2. Also, protein kinase C-mediated HSPB1 is a negative regulator of ferroptosis
  by inhibiting ROS production and reducing iron uptake. The p62-Keap1-Nrf2 pathway
  plays a vital role against ferroptosis by regulating Nrf2-targeted genes HO-1, FTH1,
  and NQO1. AMPK-mediated BECN1 phosphorylation and BAP1 directly represses system
  xc- activity, leading to the elevated ROS level and ferroptosis. MUC1-C binding
  with CD44v promotes the stability of system xc-. The inhibition of CDO1 restores
  the levels of GSH and increases ROS. Methionine can be converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  and Cys through the sulfur transfer pathway, which is essential for GPX4 biosynthesis.
  IPP and CoQ10 are the important products of the MVA pathway, which promotes GPX4
  synthesis. FIN56 treatment also reduces CoQ10 by modulating SQS. VDAC2/3 and CARS
  are positive regulators of ferroptosis. ROS accumulation requires the activation
  of PUFAs by ACSL4 and LPCAT3. And LOX directly catalyzes the peroxidation of phospholipid
  PUFAs
