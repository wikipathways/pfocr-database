caption: IGF-1/Akt signaling. The binding of growth factors such as IGF-1 and insulin
  activates receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which recruits and activates IRS-1.
  IRS-1 then activates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), which
  consists of a regulator subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110). PI3K generates
  phosphoinositide 3,4, 5-phosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits and activates PDK1 and Akt.
  In addition to PIP3 signaling, mTORC2 can also phosphorylate and activate Akt. From
  there, Akt can signal through both mTORC1 and eIF2 pathways to increase protein
  synthesis. Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3β, which is an inhibitor of
  the eIF2 complex. Akt can also activate the mTORC1 complex through inactivation
  of TSC1/2 and PRAS40. AMPK is a negative regulator of the IGF-1/Akt pathway, inhibiting
  mTORC1 activity through activation of the TSC1/2 complex and direct inhibition of
  mTORC1.
