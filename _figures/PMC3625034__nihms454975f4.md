caption: Biosynthetic delivery of apical proteins in polarized MDCK cells.The indirect
  routes taken by newly synthesized raft-associated and glycan-dependent proteins
  are shown in this model of a polarized MDCK cell (TJ are tight junctions). HRP-WGA-mediated
  ablation of apical early endosomes (AEEs) blocks apical delivery of the lipid raft-associated
  protein HA, but has no effect on delivery of newly synthesized MUC1 or endolyn.
  Expression of the MyoVb tail fragment in the apical recycling endosome (ARE) blocks
  apical delivery of MUC1 and endolyn, but has no effect on HA.
