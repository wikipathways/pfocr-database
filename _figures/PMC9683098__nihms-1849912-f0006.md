caption: (A) In normal dermal fibroblasts, C7 acts as a scaffold to load the ECM-associated
  proteins TSP1, TGM2 and C12 via TANGO1–dependent carriers (left panel) while in
  RDEB dermal fibroblasts, where full length wild-type C7 is absent, ECM-associated
  proteins are trafficked through an alternate pathway associated with close proximity
  to C1 via TANGO1-independent carriers (right panel). (B) In normal cells when ECM-associated
  proteins increase to levels where the TANGO1-C7-TSP1 loading of TANGO1-dependent
  carriers is saturated, excess TSP1 traffics through an alternate, C1 associated
  pathway. (C) In situations where TSP1 is increased, intracellular TSP1 saturates
  both TANGO1 and C1-associated secretory pathways leading to increased ER stress
  and increased TGFβ signaling.
