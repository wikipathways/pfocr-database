caption: Molecular pathways controlling human β-cell proliferation. (Left, blue) Molecular
  mechanisms regulating β-cell growth to compensate for physiological (e.g. pregnancy)
  or pathophysiological (e.g. obesity, early onset T2D) increased insulin demand.
  During pregnancy, lactogenic hormones, such as prolactin are sensed by the prolactin
  receptor (PLR). PLR transduces the signaling downstream via the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) and the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) axis, leading to the translocation
  of STAT proteins into the nucleus to initiate transcription of proliferative factors,
  including osteoprotegerin (OPG) and serotonin (5-HT). These molecules are then secreted
  in the islet milieu to sustain mitogenic signaling in an autocrine or paracrine
  fashion. OPG is known to increase survival of β-cells by blocking the interaction
  between the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL),
  avoiding the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)-mediated intrinsic
  apoptotic pathways. In insulin resistance and pregnant states, circulating insulin
  and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels are elevated. Both growth factors
  regulate further expansion of β-cells binding the insulin (IR) and the IFG1 (IGF1R)
  receptors, resulting in the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling. This, one the
  one hand, inhibits GSK3β; and, on the other, activates the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
  Overt insulin resistance leads to the increase of serine protease inhibitor B1 (SerpinB1)
  in the liver and other tissues with metabolic regulation properties. SerpinB1 is
  then secreted into the circulation to dictate compensatory mechanisms at the islet
  level. SerpinB1 stimulates β-cell proliferation by blocking the activity of serine
  proteases (e.g. pancreatic elastase), resulting in the activation of ERK1 and protein
  kinase cAMP-dependent type II regulatory subunit β (PRKAR2B). (Right, green) Human
  β-cell proliferation can also be induced by exogenous treatment with small molecules.
  In particular, SerpinB1 effects are mimicked by elastase inhibitors (e.g. sivelestat).
  Moreover, chemical inhibitors of GSK3β, including GNF7156, GNF4877 or 1-Azakenpaullone
  (1-Akp) stimulate β-cell growth. The dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a
  (DYRK1A) inhibits β-cell regeneration by regulating the activity and localization
  of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which is exported from the nucleus
  into the cytosol following phosphorylation. By suppressing the activity of DYRK1A
  using INDY, harmine, 5-iodotubericin (5-IT) or aminopyrazines, the non-phopshorylated
  form of NFAT remains in the nucleus to promote growth. The transforming growth factor
  receptor (TGFβR) pathway inhibits proliferation via the activation of SMAD proteins
  that migrate into the nucleus to repress gene expression. This regulation can be
  interrupted by chemical inhibitors of TGFβR, such as SB431542, which induces β-cell
  regeneration. Although its role in regulating growth in human β-cells is the subject
  of active debate, the activation of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) by
  either GLP-1 or its analogues (e.g. exendin-4) triggers the PI3K-AKT pathway, following
  mobilization of the Gβ and Gɣ proteins. This figure was created using Biorender.
