caption: Gut microbiome–associated mechanism of ADA therapy response. The abundance
  of the five genera (Barnesiella, Anaerostipes, Tyzzerella, Lachnoclostridium, and
  Lachnospiraceae_unclassified) were increased in the responsive group when compared
  with their nonresponsive counterparts, while a higher abundance of pathogenic bacteria
  (Escherichia–Shigella) was observed in the nonresponsive group than in its responsive
  counterpart. The gene bglX encoding β-glucosidase and gph encoding phosphoglycolate
  phosphatase are both activated during ADA treatment, facilitating starch and sucrose
  metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, respectively, thus contributing
  to ADA efficacy synergistically. Conversely, the enrichment of ABC.FEV.A, ABC.FEV.P,
  and ABC.FEV.S, which encode iron complex transport system proteins (i.e. ATP-binding
  protein, permease protein, and substrate-binding protein, respectively), alleviates
  ADA response in patients with CD via the pathway of ABC transporters.
