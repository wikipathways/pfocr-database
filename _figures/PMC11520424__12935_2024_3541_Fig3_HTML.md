caption: Regulation of STAT3 in HER2-positive breast cancer. In HER2-positive breast
  cancer, STAT3 is activated through the EGFR/Src and IL-6/JAK pathways. This leads
  to abnormally high-level expression of STAT3 in HER2-positive breast cancer. Currently,
  HER2 inhibitors (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib) are primarily used to treat
  HER2-positive breast cancer. These drugs can block STAT3 activated by the EGFR/Src
  pathway but cannot inhibit STAT3 activated by IL-6/JAK pathway. The sustained high
  level of STAT3 expression also enhances the resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer
  cells to HER2 treatment
