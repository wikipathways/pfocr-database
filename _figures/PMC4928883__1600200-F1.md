caption: Tumor cells have aberrant activation of mTORC1 that induces an anabolic growth
  program resulting in nucleotide, protein, and lipid synthesis. Loss of tumor suppressors
  like p53 or activation of oncogenes like MYC further promotes anabolism through
  transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes. Metabolism controls signaling through
  regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), acetylation, and methylation. PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; ATP, adenosine
  5´-triphosphate; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase.
