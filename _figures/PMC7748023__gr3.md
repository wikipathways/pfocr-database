caption: Schematic Representation of the Common SYM Pathway.Lipochitooligosaccharides
  (LCOs) of rhizobia (Nod factors), Frankia cluster II, and arbuscular mycorrhizal
  (AM) fungi (Myc factors), as well as chitin oligomers (COs) of AM fungi, are perceived
  by different heterodimeric complexes of LysM-RLKs. These complexes interact also
  with the leucine-rich repeat-type SYMBIOSIS RECEPTOR KINASE (LjSYMRK/MtDMI2), thereby
  activating the common SYM pathway. In the case of LCO-independent Frankia clusters
  I and III as well as Aeschynomene legumes, SYMRK is activated by an as-yet unknown
  mechanism. Nuclear Ca2+ oscillations are a hallmark of symbiotic signaling induced
  by rhizobia, Frankia, and AM fungi. Ca2+ oscillations are decoded by calcium-/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase (CCaMK), leading to activation of MtIPD3/LjCYCLOPS. Downstream of this transcription
  factor a symbiosis-specific transcriptional network is activated, which includes
  ERN1 and the NIN–cytokinin feed-forward loop, in the case of nodule formation in
  legumes, and RAM1 in the case of AM symbiosis. To allow such symbiosis-specific
  transcriptional activation, parallel pathways are predicted, which can include activating
  (green) or inhibiting (red) activity.
