caption: Multifaceted biological processes and pathways that are identified to be
  associated with AD progression. Our study revealed that multiple biological pathways
  and processes appear to be involved in the rapid progression of high-risk patients
  from P-MCI to AD, and that an integrated investigation of DESeq2 and machine learning
  methods should accelerate the discovery of biomarker signatures that will reveal
  the multifaceted nature of the molecular pathogenesis during AD disease progression
