caption: 'Simulation of the Apoptosis pathway under FasL stimulation (black starred
  line), bacterial only (red circled line) and both (blue triangled line). Bacterial
  load was held at 0.1 for the simulation. Each node represents the time-dependant
  concentration over 24 simulated hours and heights are scaled for visualization purposes.
  Interaction 1: FasL stimulation leads to Casp-8 activation through the FAS-FADD
  complex. Interaction 2: Active Casp-8 will lead to host activated BAX through a
  truncation of BID (not shown). Interaction 3: Activated BAX (BAX bound to tBID)
  will cause Cyt-C release from the membrane. Interaction 4: VacA activated BAX will
  cause Cyt-C release into the membrane. Interaction 5: Cyt-C leads to an activation
  of Casp-9 through a complex with APAF:ATP (not shown). Interaction 6a, 6b and 9:
  Activated Casp-9 will form a complex with inactive Casp-3 and subsequently cause
  Casp-3 activation. Interaction 7a, 7b and 8: Activated Casp-8 will form a complex
  with inactive Casp-3 and cause a subsequent cleavage and activation of Casp-3. Interaction
  10: Active Casp-3 will lead to the physical acts of Apoptosis.'
