caption: Proposed mechanisms of insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-mediated
  proliferation of IESCs under normal and resistant states. (a) A balance between
  the PI3K-dependent pathway regulating nutrient flow for cell survival and the ERK-dependent
  pathway regulating cell proliferation determines the cellular response to insulin
  and IGF-1 under normal conditions. (b) An imbalance in signaling between the two
  pathways may result in an uncoupling of the control mechanism between survival and
  proliferation in IESCs and lead to abnormal tissue renewal and function. (c) Inactivation
  of PI3K and/or ERK signaling molecules may induce insulin and IGF-1 resistance in
  IESCs and result in abnormal tissue renewal and function.
