caption: Ras/Sos and Ras/Raf are implicated in the MAP/ERK signaling pathway. Ras
  interacts with Sos only when a receptor tyrosine kinase binds its substrate and
  recruits Sos to the membrane. Following the Ras/Raf association depicted, Raf phosphorylates
  Mek, which phosphorylates MAPK, which modulates the activity of many downstream
  effectors.
