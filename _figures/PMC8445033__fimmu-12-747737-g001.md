caption: The necroptosis signaling pathway. Simplified schematic representation of
  the necroptosis signaling pathway upon stimulation of the TNFR, TRF3/4 and infection
  by poxviruses. All of these necroptosis-inducing signals converge on the kinase
  RIPK3, which is activated through the homotypic interaction with RIPK1 or other
  RHIM-containing proteins, such as TRIF and DAI. When the activity of caspase-8 is
  inhibited, binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of
  RIPK1 that binds to RIPK3 through their RHIM domains to form a protein complex (necrosome).
  Activated RIPK3 recruits MLKL that oligomerizes and translocates to the plasma membrane
  to cause necroptosis. In TLR3- and TLR4-induced necroptosis, TRIF is required for
  the activation of RIPK3. ZBP1 is required for the activation of RIPK3 in response
  to the presence of Z-form nucleic acids. In VACV-infected cells, the poxviral E3
  protein binds to VACV-induced Z-form nucleic acid, preventing RIPK3-induced necroptosis.
  TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; TLR 3/4, toll-like receptor; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing IFN β; RIP, receptor-interacting protein kinase; ZBP1, Z-DNA binding
  protein; MLKL, mixed-lineage kinase domain like.
