caption: 'Pathway analysis of the GLUD2 genotype effect on mouse metabolome. (A) Metabolite
  concentration divergence between transgenic and control mice, based on metabolites
  in a pathway (red circles). The boxplots show metabolite concentration divergence
  between transgenic and control mice, calculated by sampling 1,000 times the same
  number of metabolites as detected in a given pathway from the bulk of remaining
  detected metabolites. Each pathway contains at least two detected metabolites and
  at least one gene differentially expressed between transgenic and control mice.
  The filled circles show the pathways with significantly greater metabolic divergence
  than expected by chance. (B) The schematic representation of the three KEGG pathways
  showing significantly greater metabolite concentration divergence between transgenic
  and control mice: HIF-1 signaling pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, and carbon
  metabolism. Detected metabolites are shown in blue and genes with expression affected
  by the GLUD2 genotype are shown in red. Dashed pink rectangle delineates the pathway
  affected by GLUD2 overexpression in IDH1-mutant glioma cells.'
