caption: The inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by polyphenols in cancer. The
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway
  is hyperactivated in several cancers and is important in terms of tumor cell growth
  and survival. Activation of RTK, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFR),
  by growth factors such as insulin, can initiate activation of intracellular pathways.
  Akt is phosphorylated downstream of PI3K with various effects, including the activation
  of mTOR. mTOR phosphorylates p70S6K and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP-1), which then
  leads to an increased translation of mRNA and cell growth. Polyphenols act by inhibiting
  this pathway by means of decreasing the phosphorylation of several protein kinases
  that are part of this signaling pathway. The green arrows indicate the activation
  of the pathway, while the red arrows indicate the inhibition of the pathway using
  different polyphenols.

  description: The inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by polyphenols in cancer.
    The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR)
    pathway is hyperactivated in several cancers and is important in terms of tumor
    cell growth and survival. Activation of RTK, such as insulin-like growth factor-1

    growth. Polyphenols act by inhibiting this pathway by means of decreasing the
    phosphorylation of several protein kinases that are part of this signaling pathway.
