caption: 'Hippo Pathway deregulated in human cancer, from the top: alteration of the
  tumor suppressor gene NF2 in the Papillary renal cell carcinomas (PRCC) []. Generally,
  it has been shown that the transcription factor YAP is a determining element in
  the progression of renal cancer, particularly in PRCC because it promotes tumor
  angiogenesis and its silencing increases the apoptotic rate and causes arrest of
  the cell cycle [,]. In the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the loss of function
  of some key Hippo Pathway genes, as well LATS1/2 and NF2, causes resistance to BET
  protein inhibitors (BETi) [,,]. In osteosarcoma cells, methotrexate and doxorubicin
  (Dox) drugs damage the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2 activity by decreasing the phosphorylation
  of YAP allowing its translocation into the nucleus [,]. Drugs resistance is characteristic
  of this pathology and is one of the main causes of poor prognosis []. The overexpression
  of the YAP1 gene is present in Breast cancer (BC). YAP can induce EMT, increase
  the number of tumor stem cells and inhibit cell apoptosis in vitro [,,]. In the
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) YAP is overexpressed in tumor samples from
  pancreatic cancer patients [,,,,]. Furthermore, YAP acts as a transcriptional switch
  down stream of KRAS, supporting the expression of genes that promote neoplastic
  proliferation and stromal response []. Created with Biorender.com.'
