caption: A Schematic model showing Silicon uptake by roots and its interaction with
  phytohormones and metabolic pathways under osmotic stress and concomitant K deficiency
  in Barley. Silicon uptake is mediated by upregulating the expression of HvLsi1 and
  HvLsi2 transporters in the roots under osmotic stress and concomitant K deficiency.
  Si is further translocated to the shoots where its accumulation delays the osmotic
  stress-induced leaf senescence through augmentation of chlorophyll level and downregulation
  of senescence marker gene HvS40. Si in the shoots interacts with metabolic pathways
  leading to an escalation of starch and consequently protecting cells from oxidative
  stress. Si also moderates the phloem transport of sugars from shoot to roots, thus
  increasing the sucrose levels in roots and subsequent increment of the carbon flux
  into glycolytic and TCA pathways. Another interesting aspect of higher silicon in
  shoots is its interaction with phytohormones that eventually leads to lower ABA
  levels, which may be attributed to the Si-mediated modulation of the transcriptional
  regulation of ABA biosynthesis and degradation pathway or its interaction leading
  to higher levels of active cytokinin iP. Considering all the probable interactions
  of Si, it may be emphasized that Si definitely plays a positive role in stress tolerance
  under K deficiency and other abiotic stress like osmotic stress. (Red arrows = upregulation,
  Blue arrows = downregulation).
