caption: Proposed sequence of events linking dietary, plasma and CSF NaCl with salt
  sensitivity and sodium-sensitive hypertension. In this scheme, short-term increases
  in CSF [NaCl] are sensed primarily by magnocellular neurons. This activates an AT1R-dependent
  pathway that raises sympathetic nerve activity and BP. Long-term increase in CSF
  [NaCl] or angiotensin II activates a slow CNS sequence comprised of aldosterone–MR–ENaCs-EO.
  Maintained activation of this sequence chronically augments AT1R-mediated signaling
  and, via mechanisms that are not clear, stimulates peripheral CTS including EO and
  EO isomers. Maintained elevation of plasma EO increases the arterial expression
  of NCX1.3, TRPC6, and raises cytosolic Ca2+, myogenic tone, vascular reactivity
  and BP. In addition, chronic EO suppresses NO-mediated signaling in the renal medulla
  and helps to reset the pressure–natriuresis relationship. In this model, salt sensitivity
  originates in the CNS; the blockade of central aldosterone synthesis, MR, ENaC or
  central EO prevents or abrogates chronic salt-sensitive hypertension. Thus, hypertension
  will arise as the result of any primary abnormality in any component of the CNS
  pathway alone, or can be triggered by renal–vascular or renal–tubular abnormalities
  that lead to net salt retention and increased CSF NaCl. +, amplifying effect;?,
