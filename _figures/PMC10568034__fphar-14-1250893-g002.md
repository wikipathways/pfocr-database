caption: The manner in which the studied product acts on the Wnt pathway in lung cancer.
  Natural compounds and their derivatives inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway by reducing
  upstream activators such as SOX and COX-2, inhibiting Wnt ligands, inhibiting receptor
  phosphorylation such as Fzd, inhibiting Dvl, promoting destruction complex stabilization,
  and inhibiting β-catenin nuclear localization and TCF/LEF transcription factor activity.
