caption: Pathway of miR-148a induction of apoptosis. In the nucleus, pre-miR-148a
  is transcribed and processed from the miRNA gene in chromosome, which can also be
  repressed by transcription factor MYB by binding the TFBS-2 upstream of the miR-148a
  gene. The pre-miR-148a is exported to the cytoplasm, where it is further processed
  into the mature miR-148a, which is incorporated into the RISC with the argonaute
  family and other proteins. The RISCs silence Bcl-2 posttranscriptionally by directly
  binding the 3′-UTRs of Bcl-2 mRNAs. The downregulation of Bcl-2 subsequently activates
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by releasing cytochrome c from mitochondria, cleaving
  caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP
