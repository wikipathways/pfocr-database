caption: (A) Expression of ion channels or pumps, gap junctional connections, or epithelial
  damage all give rise to bioelectric signals. (B) These signals manifest as changes
  in transmembrane potential, pH gradients, specific ion flows, or electric fields.
  In the first two rows, pink shading indicates non-cell-autonomous signals while
  purple indicates cell-autonomous cues. Some nodes are both. (C) These processes
  are transduced via a variety of proximal epigenetic mechanisms including voltage-sensing
  domains on proteins, electro-osmosis, gating of morphogen transporters, and movement
  of specific ions like calcium. Green indicates a true electrical effect, while yellow
  indicates a biochemical effect due to ion identity. (D) These processes feed into
  several known genetic signaling pathways, including NF-kB, Notch, PTEN, Slug/Sox10,
  and Integrins. (E) Downstream of these signaling molecules are changes in cell cycle,
  apoptosis, position, orientation, and differentiation. (F) The ultimate result of
  orchestrated changes in cell behavior are morphogenetic processes including patterning
  of blastemas and embryonic fields, polarity decisions on several scales, and polling
  of remote tissues that enable wounds to decide what already exists and what must
  be recreated. The arrows indicate sample cases where the whole pathway has been
  traced for bioelectrical control of patterning.
