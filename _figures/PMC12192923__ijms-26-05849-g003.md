caption: The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the onset, progression and management
  of cancer. (A) The interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 facilitates tumor survival. Specifically,
  the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, leads to T-cell and malignant-cell
  engagement, suppresses downstream T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and effectively
  inhibits T-cell activation, which impedes antitumor immune responses. (B) Activation
  of T cells and cancer cell death. The administration of ICIs, such as anti-PD-1
  antibodies, can restore the function of exhausted T cells, thereby enhancing their
  cytotoxic activity and facilitating the elimination of tumor cells. (C) Regulation
  of PD-1/PD-L1 expression by various pathways. Multiple intracellular signaling cascades,
  including the JAK/STAT, MAPK, WNT, PI3K/AKT and NF-κΒ pathways, are implicated in
  regulating PD-L1 expression and contributing to tumor immune-evasion mechanisms.
