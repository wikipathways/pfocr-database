caption: Proposed pathway for the assembly of P. aeruginosa serogroup O11 O-antigen
  and pilin glycosylation. WbpL initiates O-antigen synthesis by the addition of nucleotide-activated
  N-acetyl fucosamine onto Und-P (). We propose that WbjE adds the second N-acetyl
  fucosamine, whereas WbjA adds the terminal glucose to complete the O11 subunit ().
  Subsequent O-antigen biosynthesis steps involve the transportation to the periplasm
  (Wzx), polymerization of O-antigen units (Wzy), chain length determination (Wzz),
  and linkage of the O antigen to the LPS core (WaaL) (, ). We have previously noted
  that LPS from PA103 wbjA::aacC1 contains a core + 2/3, indicating that the O-antigen
  subunit need not be complete prior to transfer to the lipid A-core (). In pilin
  glycosylation, PilO mediates the transfer of a single, complete O-subunit from Und-PP
  to pilin ().
