caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis showing regulatory relationships among differentially
  expressed transcripts. Nodes marked in red indicate transcripts that are increased
  in prolonged labor relative to CS and those in green, the transcripts that are decreased.
  Transcripts marked with an asterisk were represented several times in the list of
  differentially expressed genes, each incidence being derived from a different probe
  on the microarray. The color intensity reflects the magnitude of the difference.
  The shape of the symbol denotes the type of protein encoded. Analysis was performed
  using software from Ingenuity.
