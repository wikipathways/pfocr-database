caption: Gene expression and 14C fatty acids production in LC-PUFA synthesis pathway
  of liver between knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) salmon. The LC-PUFA biosynthesis
  pathway is shown in the middle. Figures on the left indicate expression of elongase
  and desaturase genes in log2 count per million (Log2 CPM) between KO and WT salmon
  fed either low-PUFA diet (low) or standard (std) diet. Asterisks indicates differentially
  expressed gene (q < 0.05) between KO and WT salmon. The expression of Δ6fad-c and
  elovl4 genes was not shown in the figure because their expression in liver is very
  low (Log2 CPM < 1). Gene expression analysis was performed using n = 18 elovl2 KO + n = 18
  WT fed low PUFA diet, and n = 11 each of elovl2 KO and WT fed standard diet. The
  right figures show the percentage recovery of radioactivity in n-3 LC-PUFA from
  cellular total lipids after incubation 1–14C-18:3n-3 on hepatocytes from salmon
  fed low and std diets for 108 days. Two-way ANOVA was applied, and asterisks indicates
  significant (p < 0.05) differences in recovery of radioactivity in the fatty acid
  between KO and WT salmon with n = 3. No significance (p > 0.05) was observed between
  low and std diets, nor between the interactions (Diet*Ko). Statistical differences
  between WT and elovl2 KO under two diets is denoted by different letters.
