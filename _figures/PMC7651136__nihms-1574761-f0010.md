caption: Targeting oncogenic MAPK and PI3K pathways in skin cancer. Receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which
  are frequently aberrant in skin cancer. MAPK/ERK phosphorylates transcription factors
  and upregulates expression of genes important for cell proliferation and survival.
  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) upregulates mRNA translation of these genes.
  Aberrant activation of these pathways (e.g., activating BRAFV600E mutation) leads
  to increased proliferation and survival. RAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, sorafenib,
  and dabrafenib, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib are currently used in melanoma
  treatment. However, RAF inhibitor monotherapy for melanoma can accelerate the progression
  of preexisting RAS-mutant skin lesions into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).
  Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, each targeting a different kinase
  within the MAPK pathway, reduces the incidence of cSCC in melanoma patients treated
  with a RAF inhibitor.
