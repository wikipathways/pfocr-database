caption: The endosomal–lysosomal pathway, consisting of early and late endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies and lysosomes, serves diverse functions in neurons relevant to Alzheimer
  disease (AD). In AD, the earliest changes seen in the brain are swelling of neuronal
  Rab5-endosomes, reflecting the hyper-activation of Rab5 (Rab5-GTP) by amyloid precursor
  protein (APP)-βCTF or neuronal overexpression of Rab5. Increased Rab5 activation
  leads to endosome enlargement and increased endocytosis, which have several cellular
  consequences relevant for AD. For example, increased endocytosis of AMPA receptors
  (AMPAR) leads to defects in synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine shrinkage and
  loss. In addition, abnormal growth factor/receptor-mediated signalling results in
  the downregulation of AKT-mediated prosurvival signalling and increased GSK-3β-mediated
  tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau). Corresponding endosomal–lysosomal activities in
  astrocytes and microglia coordinate bi-directional trafficking of cargo into and
  out of cells to maintain them and support the clearance of extracellular material
  in partnership with autophagy. Autophagy encompasses several mechanisms of constituent
  delivery to lysosomes, including initial entry of the substrate into late endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies (microautophagy), chaperone-mediated delivery directly to lysosomes, or macroautophagy,
  the major route depicted here. The increased induction of autophagy, a cellular
  stress response, becomes counter-productive as the functioning of autolysosomes
  and lysosomes is progressively corrupted due to multiple genetic and environmental
  factors. The result is a substantial build-up of autophagic vacuoles, mainly poorly
  acidified autolysosomes incompetent in clearing Aβ and βCTF, causing a unique pattern
  of perikaryal membrane blebbing, trafficking deficits producing autophagic vacuole-filled
  swellings along axons (dystrophic neurites), and accelerated peri-nuclear Aβ aggregation
  preceding advanced neuronal degeneration and disintegration, initiating senile plaque
  formation. An ensuing inflammatory response involving the recruitment of phagocytic
  microglia to compromised neurons/neurites and a release of damaging cytokines as
  the extracellular debris is being cleared increases bystander neurotoxicity, affecting
  neighbouring neurons and senile plaque expansion. LMP, lysosomal membrane permeabilization;
  LTD, long-term depression; LTP, long-term potentiation; ASC, Aβoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein.
