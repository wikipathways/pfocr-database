caption: 'Simplified diagram of SHH pathway activation in vertebrates. SHH ligand
  undergoes posttranslational cleavage into N- and C-terminal SHH. Structural modifications
  of N-SHH caused by C-SHH and HHAT lead to its binding with the PTCH1 receptor. This
  stimulates SMO protein to process GLI2 and GLI3, which dissociate from the SUFU
  protein and finally stimulate the expression of target genes (MYC, BCL2, VEGFA,
  CCND1, PTCH1 and GLI1). The latter encodes another transcriptional activator of
  SHH signaling (). Three SHH pathway inhibitors are presented in the figure: RU-SKI43
  blocks the activity of the HHAT enzyme (), cyclopamine inhibits conformational changes
  of the SMO protein () and GANT61 modifies the structure of GLI1 and GLI2, preventing
  their interaction with double-stranded DNA (). Blue circles, proteins of the SHH
