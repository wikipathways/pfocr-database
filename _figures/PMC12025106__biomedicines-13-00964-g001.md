caption: 'The role of Helicobacter pylori infection in methionine metabolism. H. pylori
  is associated with a risk of folate and VB12 deficiencies (a), leading to impaired
  methionine regeneration in the 1C metabolism pathway. H. pylori can also induce
  gut microbiota dysbiosis and impaired bacterial-induced folate and methionine production
  (b). Dysregulation of methionine metabolism in the 1C metabolism pathway contributes
  to the occurrence of global DNA hypomethylation due to the increased Hcy level,
  which converts back to SAH, an allosteric inhibitor of DNMTs, to impair DNA methylation
  (c). The risk of global hypomethylation due to nutrient deficiencies in AG was evident
  in a study’s findings that demonstrated a high rate of methyl carbon incorporation,
  whereas the rate of incorporation decreased to become constant in GIM and dysplasia
  [65], which suggested the likelihood of methyl donor metabolism in GIM. MS: methionine
  synthase; SAM: S-Adenosylmethionine; SAH: S-Adenosylhomocysteine; Met: methionine;
