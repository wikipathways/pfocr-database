caption: Role of chemotherapy-induced cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) in transforming
  partially transformed epithelial cells into second primary cancers (SPCs). In CAF-contacting
  partially transformed epithelial cells, pathways such as Shh, Wnt, and STAT3 involved
  in stem/progenitor cell renewal, metabolism, metastasis, and drug resistance may
  be activated. CAFs also produce metabolites like lactate, ketones, glutamine, fatty
  acids, and cysteine that fuel epithelial cell SPC transformation
