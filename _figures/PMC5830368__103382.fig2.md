caption: 'Current evidence for extracellular vesicle crosstalk in the homeostatic
  bone marrow microenvironment. (A) MSC-derived EVs signal to HSPCs through the TLR-4
  pathway, resulting in myeloid biased expansion. (B) Megakaryocyte-derived MVs are
  internalized by HSPCs and increase differentiation of new megakaryocytes through
  RNA-mediated signaling. (C) Hypoxia induces erythroleukemia cells to release EVs
  containing miR-486 which increases erythroblastic differentiation by targeting Sirt1
  in HSPCs. (D) G-CSF infusion stimulates the release of EVs containing miR-126 that
  act to down-regulate VCAM-1 in HSPCs, resulting in their mobilization out of the
  BM. (E) HSPCs autoregulate stem potential by packaging and releasing critical secretory
  proteins through the exosomal pathway via the action of VPS33B. ANGPTL-2/3; angiopoietin-like
  protein 2 and 3; BM: bone marrow; CMP: common myeloid progenitor; EB: erythroblast;
