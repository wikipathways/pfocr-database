caption: The nodes in the rhombus indicate metabolites, and the nodes in the circle
  indicate genes. The color of the line represents the positive or negative value
  of the correlation between the two pathways (red represents negative correlation,
  black represents positive correlation), and the thickness of the line is proportional
  to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.
