caption: 'Hypothetical contribution of EMT-like process to the pathophysiology of
  RA. Upon stimuli such as inflammation (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-17) or hypoxia, several
  signaling pathways become activated in normal FLS present in the synovial lining.
  These EMT signaling pathways culminate with the production of several EMT-related
  TFs such as SNAI1, HIF-1α and Runx1 leading to the acquisition of more mesenchymal
  features. These activated FLS called RA-FLS gain migratory and invasive properties
  together with an increased resistance to apoptosis resulting in the generation of
  hyperplastic synovial lining. Abbreviations: AKT: protein kinase B; α-SMA: α-smooth
  muscle actin; CIA: collagen-induced arthritis; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  HIF1α: hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; IL: interleukin; MMPs: matrix metalloproteases;
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RA-FLSs: RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes; RUNX1:
  runt-related transcription factor 1; SMAD: homolog of the Drosophila protein, mothers
  against decapentaplegic (Mad) and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Sma; SNAI1:
  Snail family transcriptional repressor 1; TFs: transcription factors; TGF-β: transforming
  growth factor-β; TNF: tumor necrosis factor. Created with Biorender.com (accessed
