caption: Protein degradation through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. Most proteins
  that are destined for degradation through the Ub-proteasome pathway are first subjected
  to polyubiquitination. This is accomplished in several stages. (a) The E1 Ub-activating
  enzyme, in an ATP-dependent reaction, forms an activated complex with Ub and transfers
  it to the E2 Ub-conjugating protein. (b) The E2 Ub-conjugating protein then transfers
  Ub to an E3 Ub-ligase protein, which has formed a complex with the target protein.
  In some cases an E3 Ub-ligase may not be necessary. (c) After several cycles of
  ubiquitination, the polyubiquitinated target protein is recognized by the proteasomal
  cap proteins (shaded gray and labeled 19 S cap) through its ubiquitin moieties,
  which are cleaved off by isopeptidases and recycled. (d) In an ATP-dependent fashion
  the protein is then unwound and fed into the 20S core through an interior channel,
  where it is exposed to the active proteolytic enzymes (shaded black). (e) Oligopeptide
  digestion products (OP) are then released and degraded further to amino acids by
  oligopeptidases. Some proteins may be subject to proteasomal degradation without
  the need for prior ubiquitination. Please note that this schematic diagram does
  not represent the various components to scale. Interested readers are referred to
  several excellent recent reviews with more detailed descriptions of this pathway
  [,].

  description: Protein degradation through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway.
    Most proteins that are destined for degradation through the Ub-proteasome pathway

    (a) The E1 Ub-activating enzyme, in an ATP-dependent reaction, forms an activated
    complex with Ub and transfers it to the E2 Ub-conjugating protein. (b) The E2
    Ub-conjugating protein then transfers Ub to an E3 Ub-ligase protein, which has
