caption: Schematic depicting the multiple functions of glycoproteins in host-pathogen
  interaction. (1) Glycoproteins surround the host cell act as barriers to inhibit
  pathogen adhesion, growth or kill pathogens; (2) alternatively these glycoproteins
  are recognized by pathogens to promote infection; (3) pathogen cell-surface or secreted
  glycoproteins directly cause disease; (4) alternatively these pathogen glycoproteins
  are recognized by host receptors to trigger defense responses; (5) pathogens also
  secrete non-glycoproteins to hosts and, subsequently be glycosylated in host endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) before they turn pathogenic; (6) proteins secreted from pathogens
  can target and glycosylate key proteins of host intracellular signal pathway to
  cause disease.
