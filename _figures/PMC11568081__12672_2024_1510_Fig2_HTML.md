caption: The figure illustrates how kaempferol induces apoptosis in digestive system
  tumors. Kaempferol promotes apoptosis through the regulation of Caspases, Bik, PARP,
  and Bcl-xL, while also inhibiting cancer cell proliferation by reducing Ki67 and
  LGR5 expression. Additionally, kaempferol enhances miR-326, which targets PKM2,
  thereby suppressing glycolysis and overcoming drug resistance. It reduces oxidative
  stress markers and regulates apoptosis-related genes through various mechanisms,
  including ROS-dependent apoptosis via the Akt/mTOR pathway and inflammasome activation
  through NF-κB signaling
