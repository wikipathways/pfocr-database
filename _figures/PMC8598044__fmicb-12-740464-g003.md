caption: Hepatitis C virus suppression of type I interferon (IFN) response (green
  arrows indicate the related signaling pathways and T-arrows in red indicate blocking
  the targets). HCV NS3/4A serine protease cleaves TRIF and MAVS to inhibit IFN-b
  pathway. HCV NS3 protein suppresses IRF-3 activation through disrupting the association
  between TBK1 and IRF3. NS4B suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN-β production signaling
  through a direct protein interaction with STING or disrupting the interaction between
  STING and TBK1.NS4B also could inhibit TLR3-mediated IFN signaling by downregulating
  TRIF protein levels via caspase 8. NS5A is able to bind with LRPPRC and exploit
  the ability of LRPPRC to inhibit MAVS-regulated antiviral signaling.
