caption: Overview of insulin regulation of major metabolic responses in the cells.
  Under physiological conditions, insulin binds to its receptor (IR) to enhance positive
  tyrosine IRS-1 phosphorylation, promoting the activation of PI3-K which in turn
  phosphorylates and activates p-Akt. High expression of p-Akt activates translocation
  of glucose transporter 4 and thus increasing glucose uptake by the cell. p-Akt also
  further phosphorylates GSK-3β, promoting the glucose storage as glycogen. Under
  pathophysiological conditions, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-6 enhance negative phosphorylation of IRS-1 serine (307), causing insulin
  resistance. Activated NF-KB activates serine/threonine kinases (JNK) which phosphorylates
  IRS-1 and also works via other pathways such as SOCS expression to inhibit the insulin
  signaling pathway
