caption: TGF-β regulates normal and malignant MEC behavior by binding and activating
  two transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase receptors, namely TβR-I and TβR-II, whose
  binding to TGF-β is modulated by TβR-III. Activation of these ligand:receptor ternary
  complexes requires TβR-II to transphosphorylate TβR-I, which subsequently phosphorylates
  and activates Smad2/3. The phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3 form heterocomplexes
  with Smad4, which collectively accumulate in the nucleus to mediate canonical TGF-β
  signaling. Likewise, noncanonical TGF-β signaling transpires via the activation
  of an ever expanding list of downstream effectors, including integrins, FAK and
  Pyk2, MAP kinases, Src, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-κB, and Cox-2. Also shown are various
  anti-TGF-β agents and their molecular targets. See text for additional details.
