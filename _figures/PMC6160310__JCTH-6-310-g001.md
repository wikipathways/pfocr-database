caption: HEV enters a permissive cell supposedly through a receptor-dependent process,
  aided by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and other unknown factors. The viral
  genome is released, ORF1 gets translated and processed into different functional
  domains, followed by replication. Multiple copies of capped (green box) genomic
  (g)RNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs are thus produced. SgRNAs synthesize viral capsid
  (ORF2) and ORF3 proteins. ORF2, gRNA and other viral and/or host factors mediate
  assembly of new virions, which are released out of the cell through an endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent process involving the viral
  ORF3 protein. The green asterik indicates the steps that can be targeted for antiviral
  development. A, B, C and D represent the unknown factors present in the viral replication
  complex. Note that ORF4 is present only in the case of genotype 1 HEV. Known antivirals
  have been indicated at the appropriate steps. The mode of pegylated-interferon-alpha
  (PEG-IFN-α) action is represented through the illustration of the inteferon-alpha
  (IFN-α) signaling pathway. PEG-IFN-α induces the production of interferon-stimulated
  proteins (ISGs) and interferon-inducible transmemebrane proteins (IFITM), which
  activate the canonical antiviral signaling pathways that results in the inhibition
  of HEV entry and/or replication.
