caption: The co-translational translocation pathway highlighting (red contour) the
  two ADPLD proteins, Sec63p and GIIβ. At this stage, the precursor protein (e.g.
  PC1) is threaded through the translocon, with its central subunit, the Sec61 complex,
  and the auxiliary subunits that are present in the membrane (Sec63 and ERdj1/Erj1).
  Via their DnaJ domains, Sec63p and Erdj1 provide a link to the ATPase cycle of the
  luminal chaperone BiP. Downstream of Sec63p, GIIβ is involved (as the regulatory
  subunit of the glucose trimming enzyme, glucosidase II) in glucose trimming, which
  takes place as part of the calnexin-calreticulin cycle. Cystic proteins such as
  PC1 have to go through this pathway to achieve their final, functional cellular
  location (the primary cilia). Defects along this pathway may affect both the translocation
  (due to Sec63p inactivation) or glucose trimming/folding (via GIIβ) of cystic proteins
  as described in [].
