caption: Biosynthetic pathway for β-carotene production in the engineered yeast strain
  of this study. Hmg1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase; Erg12, mevalonate
  kinase; Erg20, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; Erg8, phosphomevalonate kinase;
  Bts1, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; CrtYB, phytoene synthase and cyclase;
  CrtI, phytoene desaturase. The dotted lines indicate the pathway steps that were
  integrated into the yeast genome by this study.
