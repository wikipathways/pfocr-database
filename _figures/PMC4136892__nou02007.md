caption: Model of signaling pathway regulation in human schwannomas. When expressed
  in Schwann cells, merlin inhibits growth factor receptor delivery at the plasma
  membrane, as we previously demonstrated (1). Merlin also blocks YAP nuclear accumulation
  (2) leading to the inhibition of proliferation (3). In schwannomas, where merlin
  expression is lost (4), YAP accumulates in the nucleus (5) and stimulates the expression
  of PDGFRß, Her2, Her3, and possibly Axl as well as some of their ligands such as
  PDGF and Gas6 (6). In the absence of merlin, these receptors accumulate at the cell
  surface (7) where they stimulate mitogenic signaling pathway (8) proliferation and
  survival (9). In parallel, Tie2 expression may stimulate the development of new
  blood vessels (10) contributing to tumor development.
