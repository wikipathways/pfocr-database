caption: 'Conceptual model of the molecular regulation of axon regeneration at the
  transection site by apoptotic genes. (A) Schematic of axon regeneration steps following
  injury; regrowth, recognition, and fusion (B) Axon Regeneration Initiation: CRT-1-dependent
  calcium release following injury leads to local activation of CED-4/Apaf-1 and subsequent
  activation of CED-3/caspase and DLK-1 to initiate filopodia extension. CED-7/ABC
  transporter function is also promoted by CED-3/caspase leading to PtdSer exposure.
  INA-1/PAT-3 may recognize PtdSer via TTR-11 leading to the activation of the CED-2/CrkII-CED-5/Dock180/CED-12
  Elmo signaling module which in turn activates CED-10/Rac GTPase. Axon Regeneration-Fusion:
  PSR-1 functions cell autonomously in regenerating neuron through a pathway involving
  TTR-52/transthyretin, NRF-5, CED-7/ABC transporter and CED-6/GULP to promote axonal
  fusion, a late step of regeneration. Fusion also involves EFF-1 accumulation at
  the cut site of the axon mediating fusion of distal and proximal process. For simplicity,
  all regeneration steps are shown at one proximal-distal segment junction following
  injury.'
