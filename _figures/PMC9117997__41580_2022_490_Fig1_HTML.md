caption: a | Chemical structure of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), a glycerophospholipid
  with myo-inositol as a head group. Note that only the 2′-hydroxy group of the inositol
  ring is in the axial position (that is, perpendicular to the plane of the inositol
  ring), while all others are equatorial. PtdIns is depicted in the 1-stearoyl (R1),
  2-arachidonyl (R2) configuration, the most frequent acyl chain composition found
  in phosphoinositides. b | Phosphoinositide metabolism. Addition and removal of phosphate
  groups at the 3′-hydroxy, 4′-hydroxy and 5′-hydroxy groups of PtdIns by phosphoinositide
  kinases (blue) and phosphatases (red) creates seven distinct phosphoinositide species.
  Enzymatic interconversion of phosphoinositides creates a network in which formation
  of one species depends on the availability of another, meaning that the cellular
  levels of certain phosphoinositides are interdependent. Phosphoinositides enriched
  in the endolysosomal system (shaded yellow) versus the secretory pathway and the
  plasma membrane (shaded blue) are indicated. c | Subcellular enrichment of phosphoinositides.
  The spatiotemporally controlled activity of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases
  creates a distinctive enrichment of phosphoinositides across the cellular compartments.
  The plasma membrane is highly enriched in PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2).
  The Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) are characterized by PtdIns
  4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), which is also present at the plasma membrane. By contrast,
  the endosomal compartments are dominated by 3′-phosphoinositides, with PtdIns 3-phosphate
  (PtdIns3P) being the signature lipid of early endosomes. A fraction of PtdIns3P
  is converted to PtdIns 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) on late endosomes. Lysosomes
  are unique in having a diverse complement of phosphoinositides in their membranes,
  likely depending on their functional and metabolic state. On multiple endocytic
  routes, PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) is formed on nascent endocytic carriers
  before conversion to PtdIns3P in endocytic vesicles. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  MTM, myotubularin; MVB, multivesicular body; PI3K; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
