caption: A model of the checkpoint function of BUB1. (A) BUB1 functions upstream of
  MAD2; the checkpoint signaling pathway is presumably more complicated, but the fate
  (i.e., type of death) of the cells is the focus in this model. Purple arrows indicate
  the events that occur when the proteins fail to perform their functions. When defects
  in the kinetochore-microtubule attachment occur in BUB1-depleted cells, the cells
  enter CIMD. If MAD2 is absent, chromosomes are lost or gained. The resulting aneuploid
  cells then enter the subsequent G1 phase, and apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe–like
  death, or reproductive death occurs. (B) If the model in A is correct, then when
  BUB1 and MAD2 functions are disrupted, CIMD occurs, because BUB1 function is upstream
  in the pathway. MAD2 depletion did not substantially affect CIMD induced by BUB1
  depletion, which strongly supports the model in A.
