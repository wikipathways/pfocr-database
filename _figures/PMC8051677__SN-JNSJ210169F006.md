caption: a, Proteomics workflow. Macrophages were activated for 24 h; then cells were
  lysed and processed for proteomics (n = 4, for each condition). Data were obtained
  from LC/MS/MS and were analyzed on MaxQuant. b, Network analysis by STRING (https://string-db.org/)
  demonstrated the enrichment of molecules involve in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  (red), metabolic pathway (blue), and amino acid biosynthesis (green) in M(LPS/IL4/IL13)
  group compared with M(IL4/IL13). c, Network analysis revealed the enrichment in
  antioxidant molecules (red) and proteins involve in glutathione metabolism (blue).
  d, Further analysis determined increase in proteins involved in phagocytic machinery,
  such as phagosome formation (red) and lysosome increase (blue). Western blot detected
  changes to selected proteins are displayed in Extended Data .
