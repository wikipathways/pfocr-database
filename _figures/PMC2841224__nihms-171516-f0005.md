caption: Hypoxia sensing pathway. Under normoxia, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
  is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs), and then
  recognized for ubiquitination by pVHL E3 ligase and targeted for degradation by
  the proteasome. During hypoxia, HIF-1α is not degraded and translocates to the nucleus.
  There, HIF-1α works with HIF-1β, E1A binding protein p300, and CREB binding protein
  (CBP) to activate the transcription of genes controlled by the hypoxia response
  element (HRE).
