caption: The anti-cancer mechanisms of cordycepin-induced autophagy. Various stress
  conditions, such as metabolic starvation, hypoxia, and DNA damage, initiate the
  autophagic process. Stress conditions inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR),
  leading to the activation of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, which triggers
  the formation of the phagophore by activating the “initiation complex”. Cordycepin
  could cause DNA damage and trigger the inhibition of the mTOR pathway to induce
  cancer cell death. The phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form of Microtubule-associated
  protein 1A/1B-light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which is converted from LC3-I by ATG4-dependent
  cleavage, is critically involved in the fusion of mature autophagosomes and lysosomes.
  The autophagolysosome, which is already fused with a lysosome, could then result
  in the degradation and recycling of metabolites. Cordycepin also upregulates LC3-II
  expression, leading to autophagy in cancer cells.
