caption: 'Figure 2. Schematic illustration of Sertoli cells (SCs) main metabolic pathways.
  The SCs are capable of consuming a variety fuels including glucose, lactate, fatty
  acids and aminoacids. Nevertheless, SCs actively metabolize glucose being the majority
  of it converted in lactate and not oxidized in the TCA cycle. The extracellular
  lactate and pyruvate are transported via the members of the family of proton-linked
  plasma membrane transporters that carry molecules having one carboxylate group,
  the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT4), while glucose is imported via specific
  members of the family of membrane proteins called glucose transporters (GLUT1 and
  GLUT3). Once glucose enters the glycolytic pathway, it is decomposed to pyruvate
  which can (a) be converted into lactate via lactate dehydrogenase, (b) be converted
  into alanine via alanine transaminase or (c) be transported to the mitochondrial
  matrix, oxidized and decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase forming the two
  carbon intermediate Acetyl-CoA which can enter the TCA cycle. The oxidation of these
  substrates is coupled with ADP phosphorylation via the electron transport chain
  to form ATP. Abbreviations: TCA, tricarboxylic acid; GLUT, glucose transporter;
  MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; ALT, alanine transaminase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  PFK, phosphofructokinase; TFP, trifunctional protein.'
