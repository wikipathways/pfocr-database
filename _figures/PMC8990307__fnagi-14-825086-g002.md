caption: Schematic diagram of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation signaling pathways
  after TBI. In response to TBI, DAMPs such as HMGB1 can promote priming of the NLRP3
  inflammasome through NF-κB signaling. In microglia, activation of P2X7 receptor
  could stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which subsequently leads to the outflow
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-18 and IL-1β. CX3CL1 is also known to
  induce microglia activation through intracellular phosphorylation of microglial
  p38 MAPK. Further, treatment of cultured microglia with CX3CL1 promoted cell survival
  and inhibited Fas ligand-induced cell death via the Akt signaling pathway. TLR signaling
  initiates acute inflammatory response by promoting the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Ligand binding to TLR4 activates either a MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation
  or MyD88-independent activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) activation
  and the subsequent expression of IFNβ. The TREM2 pathway is responsible for switching
  from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglial phenotype after phagocytosis
  of apoptotic neurons. Upon activation, the PPARs regulate inflammation via trans-reexpression
  of multiple inflammatory signaling systems such as NFκB, activator protein-1 (AP-1),
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) to result in M1/M2 microglia
  polarization and facilitate it toward an anti-inflammatory state. In LPS induced
  neuroinflammation, LRRK2 could phosphorylate p53 and promote the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Activation of NOX2 aggravated inflammatory-mediated
  neurodegeneration after TBI via inhibiting switch from M1-like activation to M2-
  like activation of microglia. Pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed by microglia,
  including interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, can specifically
  stimulate Aβ accumulation while anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra, IL-10,
  and TGF preclude formation of Aβ. HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; N-FκB, nuclear
  factor-kappa B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  IFN-β, IRF-3-inducing interferon-b. TREM2, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
  cells 2. LRRK2, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PPARγ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma. IL-1ra, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist;
  Aβ, beta amyloid.
