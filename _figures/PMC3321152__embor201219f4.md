caption: In response to TNFα, the intracellular tails of TNFR1 trimers drive the assembly
  of a supramolecular complex including, among other factors, TRADD, TRAFs, cIAPs
  and RIPK1. Upon ubiquitination, RIPK1 can stimulate the canonical pathway of activation
  of the anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Alternatively,
  deubiquitinated RIPK1 can interact with RIPK3 and trigger necroptosis. The pro-apoptotic
  proteins FADD and caspase-8, the latter by cleaving RIPK1 and RIPK3, tonically inhibit
  this pro-necrotic signalling cascade. cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein;
  FADD, FAS-associated death domain protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; RIPK; receptor-interacting
  protein kinase; TNFα, tumour necrosis factor α; TNFR1, TNFα receptor 1; TRADD, TNFR1-associated
  death domain protein; TRAF, TNFR-associated factor.
