caption: Proposed P2X7-LPA signaling axis promoting osteogenesis. Activation of P2X7
  receptors on cells of the osteoblast lineage by endogenous ATP or exogenous BzATP
  leads to production of LPA through a pathway involving PLD and PLA2. In addition,
  activation of PLA2 leads to production of COX metabolites such as prostaglandins
  (PG). LPA and prostaglandins then bind to their receptors on the same or neighboring
  cells to induce expression of osteoblast genes such as osterix and osteocalcin.
  Up-regulation of these genes in turn induces osteogenesis by promoting differentiation
  and mineralization.
