caption: Current models describing Tor pathway regulation of Gln3 dephosphorylation,
  localization, and activation of NCR-sensitive transcription (A) and interactions
  of the positively and negatively-acting GATA factors that fine-tune the levels of
  NCR-sensitive transcription (B). The model incorporates conclusions drawn from many
  laboratories (see text for references). Green lines and arrows indicate positive
  regulation, whereas red lines, arrows, and bars indicate negative regulation. In
  A, red and green letters indicate inactive and active forms of the proteins, respectively.
  Dashed lines indicate weak regulatory relationships. The model in A is not exhaustive—for
  example, the Tip41 protein () is not described—and does not present all contending
  views of some steps, for example, those reported by the  vs.  or  vs. . A is modified
  from  and B is modified from .
