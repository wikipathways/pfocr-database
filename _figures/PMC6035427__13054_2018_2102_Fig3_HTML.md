caption: Endothelial and smooth muscle-mediated mechanisms of vascular dysfunction
  in shock. Hormonal and mechanical factors drive endothelial cell activation in the
  vasculature. Increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) generates increased production of nitric oxide (NO) from arginine. NO directly
  reduces vascular tone through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, which
  catalyses the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP. In addition, NO combines with oxygen
  free radicals (O2−) produced by dyfunctional mitochondria and a number of enzymes,
  including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), NADPH and xanthine oxidase.
  The synthesised peroxynitrite also directly contributes to smooth muscle relaxation.
  Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is synthesised from L-cysteine by cystathionine-β-synthase
  or cystathionine-γ-lyase (CBL). In shock, H2S reduces vascular tone through inhibition
  of mitochondrial function and activation of potassium channels. Arachidonic acid
  is converted to vasoactive prostaglandins via a two-step pathway involving cyclooxygenase
  (COX) isoforms and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), which synthesises prostacyclin
  (PGI2). This in turn drives vasodilatation via the activation of stimulatory G-protein-coupled
  receptors (Gs), which promotes synthesis of cyclic AMP (AMP) from ATP by adenylate
  cyclase (AC). Thrombxane A2 (TXA2) is synthesised from the common intermediate PGH2
  and plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone in shock states. In the smooth
  muscle, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by a number of routes drives smooth
  muscle relaxation through potassium channel- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated
  hyperpolarization and activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Glucogorticoids
  (G) activate glucocorticoid receptors (GR) through both classic and non-classic
  mechanisms to regulate vascular tone, a process that is impaired in a number of
  ways in shock. Changes in expression of adrenergic (α1) and vasopressin (VR) receptors
  and their circulating agonists impair the function of vascular smooth muscle in
  shock states
