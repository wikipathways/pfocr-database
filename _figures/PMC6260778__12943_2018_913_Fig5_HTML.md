caption: The microenvironment recruits Tregs to tumor tissue by chemotaxis. Hypoxia
  promotes the expression of chemokines on tumor cells and Tregs surface through the
  HIF signaling pathway, and recruits Tregs by chemotaxis to the tumor tissue. Low
  pH microenvironment promotes the secretion of chemokine-containing exosomes from
  tumor cells that recruit Tregs to tumor tissue by chemotaxis
