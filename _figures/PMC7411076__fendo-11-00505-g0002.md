caption: Pharmacological inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis prevents high fat
  diet (HFD) induced NASH. (A) Simplified schematic of ceramide de novo synthesis
  pathway, demonstrating the target of Myriocin (in red). (B) Graphical summary of
  the beneficial effects of Myriocin treatment in HFD-fed Sprague-Dawley rats. HFD-induced
  NAFLD related effects are shown in black with the beneficial effects of Myriocin
  treatments shown with red lines. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
