caption: Extracellular LPA activates the LPA5 receptor and membrane lipids are metabolized
  mainly by PLD. PLD and iPLA2 activity leads to intracellular LPA production and
  the resulting LPA directly activates TRPA1 and TRPV1 through interactions with KK672–673/KR977–978
  and K710 (Nieto‐Posadas et al. ), respectively, leading to an increase in [Ca2+]i.
  Thin grey lines, red circles and orange diamonds indicate hydrocarbon chains, phosphate
  groups and phosphorylcholine, respectively.
