caption: Schematic representing the suspected roles of and molecular pathways involving
  MeCP2 in colorectal-cancer progression. MeCP2 leads SPI1 to the ZEB1 promoter to
  increase ZEB1 expression. Increased ZEB1 expression leads to upregulation of MMP14,
  SOX2, and CD133 [91]. MeCP2-mediated regulation of KLF4 is achieved through the
  binding of MeCP2 to METTL14. Complexing of MeCP2 and METTL14 results in decreased
  m6A methylation, and destabilization of KLF4 transcripts and CRC metastasis [111].
  MeCP2, in conjunction with DNA methylation at the promoter region, regulated the
  expression of E-cadherin in CRC [112]. MeCP2-mediated epigenetic silencing of miR-137
  is also shown [113]. Illustration is generated using BioRender.com
