caption: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its bypass loops and convergent signaling
  pathways, and medications that target key steps of these pathways. The classical
  RAS, highlighted in black, regulates blood pressure, stem cells and tumor development.
  Bypass loops of the RAS, highlighted in blue, involves enzymes such as cathepsins
  B, D and G provide redundancy, while other signaling pathways such as the COX-2
  pathway and the IGF/IGFR-1 pathway, highlighted in green, converge on the RAS, to
  activate the pro-renin receptor. Key steps of the RAS and related pathways can be
  inhibited by commonly available medications, highlighted in red. Angiotensinogen
  (AGN) is physiologically synthesized and released by the liver and is cleaved by
  renin which is released by the kidneys, to form angiotensin I (ATI). Renin is formed
  following binding of pro-renin to the pro-renin receptor. Production pro-renin is
  reduced by β-blockers, and renin can be directly blocked using aliskerin. ATI is
  converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), normally
  produced by the lungs. ACE can be blocked using ACE inhibitors (ACEI). ATII interacts
  with the G-protein coupled receptors ATII receptor 1 (ATIIR1) and ATII receptor
  2 (ATIIR2), to restore homeostasis. ATIIR1 can be blocked using an ATIIR1 blocker
  (ARB). Cathepsins B and D are also renin-activating enzymes that convert pro-renin
  to renin. Curcumin inhibits the activities of cathepsin B. Cathepsin D also converts
  AGN to ATI, and cathepsin G converts ATI to ATII or AGN directly to ATII. The COX-2
  pathway and the IGF/IGFR-1 pathway can be blocked using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs (NSAIDS) and metformin, respectively.
