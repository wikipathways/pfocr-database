caption: Once the corneal epithelium is injured, epithelial cells lose adhesions,
  change shape, proliferate, and migrate rapidly to cover the defect. EGF (epidermal
  growth factor) is the primary pathway initiating cell migration and proliferation.
  It is helped by insulin-like growth factor (IGF), insulin, transforming growth factor
  β (TGFβ), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) []. Bidirectional interactions
  between corneal epithelium and stroma take place during corneal wound healing. Interleukin-1
  (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) released by epithelial cells lead to apoptosis
  of keratocytes. IL-1 activation induces keratocytes to produce Fas Ligand and triggers
  apoptosis via autocrine action. IL-1 also contributes to keratocyte activation and
  activated keratocytes acquire the ability for autocrine IL-1 production via “IL-1
  loop”. Thus, stromal modeling occurs even in the absence of epithelium-derived IL-1
  []. PDGF derived from corneal epithelium leads to migration, proliferation, and
  differentiation of keratocytes. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and keratinocyte
  growth factor (KGF) released by stromal keratocytes modulate the cell motility,
  proliferation, and differentiation of corneal epithelial cells. TGFβ can have an
  antagonizing effect on epithelial cell proliferation induced by EGF, HGF, and KGF.
  TGFβ also leads to the differentiation of keratocytes to myofibroblasts. Activated
  keratocytes and myofibroblasts secrete provisional matrix which consists of fibronectin,
  proteoglycans, and hyaluronan []. Lumican is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan present
  in the stroma that may act as matrikine interacting with ALK5 receptors on corneal
  epithelial cells and modulate their proliferation []. Lumican also enhances Fas-Fas
  Ligand signaling [].
