caption: Neutrophils rely on the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway to meet
  their energy demands during Mtb infection. This bioenergetic process is essential
  for driving neutrophil migration to infection sites, where these immune cells inadvertently
  support bacterial growth, creating a replicative niche for the pathogen. Consequently,
  neutrophils utilizing fatty acids as an energy source act as a permissive environment
  for Mtb in the lungs of hosts susceptible to TB disease. Illustrations created with
