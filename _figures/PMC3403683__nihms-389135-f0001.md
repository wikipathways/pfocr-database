caption: The study of lymphocyte activation requires observation of samples that vary
  in size over six orders of magnitude. This figure shows the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
  signalling pathway and microscopy techniques used at three levels of sample size.
  a | In whole organisms or intact tissues, encounters between lymphocytes and antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) can be studied in situ using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM).
  The specimen size is tens of millimetres. b | Cell–cell interactions and many subcellular
  details can be monitored using a large number of conventional microscopy techniques.
  These samples are typically several micrometres in size, but some details are at
  the diffraction limit of light scale. c | To observe molecular detail, high- and
  super-resolution imaging techniques are required. The samples here are individual
  molecules, only a few nanometres in size. DIC, differential interference contrast;
  LAT, linker for activation of T cells; PALM, photoactivated localization microscopy;
  SEM, scanning electron microscopy; SIM, structured illumination microscopy; STED,
  stimulated emission depletion; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TIRF, total
  internal reflection fluorescence; ZAP70, ζ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70kDa.
