caption: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induced inflammatory cell signaling
  pathways. Hyperglycemia increases the production of AGEs. AGEs interact with receptors
  for AGEs (RAGE), resulting in the binding of the RAGE intracellular domain to diaphanous-related
  formin1 (Diaph1) and toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein
  (TIRAP). Several downstream signaling pathways can induce NF-κB activation, including
  the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt results in the phosphorylation
  of IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IκB, releasing NF-κB from its IκB binding
  and leading to subsequent translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. NADPH oxidase/reactive
  oxidative species (ROS) also activate IKK. In addition, AGE/RAGE induces the activation
  of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK). ERK can phosphorylate IκB. Small Rho GTPase proteins, including homolog
  family member A (RhoA), cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42), and RAS-related
  C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), promote the activation of NF-κB by phosphorylating
  IκB. NF-κB in the nucleus promotes the gene transcription of proinflammatory cytokines
