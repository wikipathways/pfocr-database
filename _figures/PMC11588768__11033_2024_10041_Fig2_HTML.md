caption: 'The TGP treatment: A TGP regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to
  treat IgAVN. Wnt/β functions in catenin signaling pathways involved in cell differentiation
  and proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. TGP can inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway activation to ameliorate kidney damage. B TGP interferes with programmed
  cell death. By inducing apoptosis and autophagy, TGP can reduce inflammation as
  well as promote the repair and regeneration of kidney cells. TGP has a strong ability
  to resist oxidative stress and inhibit ferroptosis. TGP may reduce oxidative stress
  and cell death in the kidney by inhibiting the activity or expression of SLC7A11.
  C TGP regulates oxidative stress and inflammation. TGP can significantly increase
  SOD and CAT levels, reduce MDA content, its composition is PF, by promoting M1 to
  M2 polarization of macrophages and modulating KLF4 mitochondrial autophagy to suppress
  kidney inflammation. D The role of TGP in vascular repair. Through its anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant effects, TGP promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration,
  increases vascular smooth muscle cell calcium internal flow, condensed antiplatelet
  and antithrombotic effect, thereby playing a role in the vascular repair process.
