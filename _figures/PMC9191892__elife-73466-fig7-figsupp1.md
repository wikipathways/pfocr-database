caption: (A) The role of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) in linking the citrate cycle
  with amino acid biosynthesis. Both AAT1 and AAT2 encode AAT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  Its substrates are in bold. Other pathways are available for the interconversion
  of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate. Adapted from pathway sce00250 (alanine, aspartate,
  and glutamate metabolism – S. cerevisiae) in the KEGG database (). For clarity,
  some links are not shown. (B) Views of the Aat2 homodimer (left) and active site
  (right), showing the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP, green) and the competitive
  inhibitor maleate (purple; PDB 1YAA ). The two active site residues targeted by
  site-directed mutagenesis are in bold.
