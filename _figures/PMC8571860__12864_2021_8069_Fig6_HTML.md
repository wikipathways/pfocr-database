caption: Effect of Fg infection on expression of other (non-classical defense) ‘Fielder’
  phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathway genes. Chemical structures are shown
  for (1) indole acetic acid, (2) isopentenyl diphosphate (3) farnesyl diphosphate
  (4) geranylgeranyl diphosphate (5) abscisic acid (6) trans-zeatin (7) brassinolide
  and (8) giberellin (GA3). Compound acronyms are highlighted in yellow. ‘Fielder’
  gene acronyms are represented as up-regulated (red; log2FC > 1.5) and down-regulated
  (blue; log2FC < − 1.5), respectively (adj p < 0.01) compared to mock treatment.
  Annotations were based on BlastP analysis selecting for transcripts with > 50% sequence
  identity to known phytohormone signaling pathway members as annotated in the KEGG
  database. See Additional file , Tabs S2 and S3 for detailed expression data
