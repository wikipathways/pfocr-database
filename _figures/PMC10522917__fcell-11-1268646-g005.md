caption: Schematic of the hypothesis that lactate promotes PASMC proliferation by
  disrupting the immune microenvironment via histone lactylation modification. Glycolysis
  and the TCA cycle are the major metabolic processes of glucose in the body. When
  oxygen is adequate, cells produce energy primarily through the TCA cycle. However,
  in hypoxia, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis to produce large amounts of lactate.
  Lactate is transported via MCT1 to CD4+ T cells, which then promote the differentiation
  of Th17 cells and the expansion of Treg cells. At the same time, the increase in
  lactate promotes the secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α by immune cells, which promotes
  PASMC proliferation by activating downstream signalling pathways. In addition, lactate
  promotes the release of IL-1 through histone lactylation modification of M1 macrophages,
  thereby promoting the proliferation of PASMC.
