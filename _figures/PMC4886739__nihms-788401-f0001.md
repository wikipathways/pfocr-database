caption: The binding of elementary bodies to host cells is initiated by the formation
  of a trimolecular bridge between bacterial adhesins, host receptors and host heparan
  sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Next, pre-synthesized type III secretion system (T3SS)
  effectors are injected into the host cell, some of which initiate cytoskeletal rearrangements
  to facilitate internalization and/or initiate mitogenic signalling to establish
  an anti-apoptotic state. The elementary body is endocytosed into a membrane-bound
  compartment, known as the inclusion, which rapidly dissociates from the canonical
  endolysosomal pathway. Bacterial protein synthesis begins, elementary bodies convert
  to reticulate bodies and newly secreted inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) promote
  nutrient acquisition by redirecting exocytic vesicles that are in transit from the
  Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The nascent inclusion is transported, probably
  by an Inc, along microtubules to the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) or centrosome.
  During mid-cycle, the reticulate bodies replicate exponentially and secrete additional
  effectors that modulate processes in the host cell. Under conditions of stress,
  the reticulate bodies enter a persistent state and transition to enlarged aberrant
  bodies. The bacteria can be reactivated upon the removal of the stress. During the
  late stages of infection, reticulate bodies secrete late-cycle effectors and synthesize
  elementary-body-specific effectors before differentiating back to elementary bodies.
  Elementary bodies exit the host through lysis or extrusion.
