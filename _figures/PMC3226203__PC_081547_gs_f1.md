caption: 'The Monolignol Biosynthetic Pathway in Vascular Plants.Light, medium, and
  dark-gray areas illustrate three levels of aromatic ring modifications that lead
  to the biosynthesis of H, G, and S lignin. The metabolic pathway derived from 5-hydroxyguaiacyl
  (5-OH-G) intermediates is depicted in gray, since it exists only when the COMT step
  is blocked. The enzymes illustrated on the pathway are by default based on the current
  knowledge acquired from studying angiosperms, except for the enzymes that define
  the unique pathway toward S lignin biosynthesis in Selaginella, which are underlined
  and positioned underneath the arrows. The enzymes and their abbreviations are as
  follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; 4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA ligase; HCT,
  hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3′H, p-coumaroyl shikimic
  acid 3′-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyl transferase; CCR, (hydroxy)cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; HCALDH, hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase; CAD, (hydroxy)cinnamyl alcohol
  dehydrogenase.'
