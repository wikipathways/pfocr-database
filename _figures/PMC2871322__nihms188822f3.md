caption: Schematic diagram of the forebrain neurocircuitry and peripheral inputs underlying
  the influences of osmotic and peripheral angiotensin II (Ang II) on sympathetic
  outflow and the baroreflex. Similar to mechanisms described for thirst sensation,
  neurons within the forebrain circumventricular organ, the OVLT, detect changes in
  plasma osmolality or blood tonicity. This information is relayed onto neurons in
  the median nucleus (NM) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Parvoand magnocellular
  neurons in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei within the hypothalamus
  are then activated, leading to the release of the pressor hormone arginine vasopressin
  (AVP). These hypothalamic structures (e.g., the SFO) also use an angiotensinergic
  pathway, meaning they are also directly sensitive to changes in local and peripheral
  changes in Ang II via AT1 receptors. Arterial baroreflexes located in the carotid
  sinus and aortic arch sense transient changes in pressure and central volume. Mechanoreceptors
  sensitive to stretch in the arteries relay information regarding the absolute level
  and the change in blood pressure to the central nervous system (via the vagus [X]
  and glossopharyngeal [IX] cranial nerves). Baroreflexes send signals to the NTS,
  and neurons in the NTS relay the processed input to central sites (LPO and LH, the
  lateral preoptic nucleus and lateral hypothalamus), which then mediate vagal and
  sympathetic outflow to the heart and blood vessels. The sympathetic outflow leads
  to rapid adaptation of local blood vessels to the altered volumes and pressures,
  causing autonomic neural responses that prevent large fluctuations in blood pressure.
  In response to blood pressure increases, a key element of sympathoinhibition is
  the attenuation of the chronic sympathoexcitatory effects of circulating Ang II,
  as well as other hormones, such as arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine.
