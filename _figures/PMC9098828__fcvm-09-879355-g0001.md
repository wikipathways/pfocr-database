caption: Effects of Glucose/insulin on cholesterol metabolism. Glucose provides Acetyl-CoA
  for cholesterol biosynthesis. Glucose/insulin also enhances cholesterol biosynthesis
  by stabilizing HMGCR and increasing HMGCR expression. Glucose or insulin activates
  mTORC1 by repressing AMPK or stimulating insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,
  respectively. The USP20 phosphorylated by mTORC1 prevents HMGCR from being degraded
  by GP78. PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also stabilizes HMGCR via inhibiting the recruitment
  of E3 ligase TRC8. The upregulated mTORC1 can promote the translocation of SREBP2
  from ER to the Golgi apparatus, where nSREBP2 is produced sequentially by the S1P
  and S2P. nSREBP2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to SRE sequences to stimulate
  HMGCR expression. Meanwhile, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway upregulates HMGCR via promoting
  SREBP–SCAP complex to migrate into the Golgi. Besides, glucose and its metabolites
  inhibit cholesterol uptake by activating ChREBP, which enters the nucleus to augment
  human PCSK9 expression, thereby increasing PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. Moreover,
  elevated circulating glucose levels can enhance enterocyte NPC1L1 expression via
  some unknown mechanisms, thereby strengthening intestinal absorption of cholesterol.
