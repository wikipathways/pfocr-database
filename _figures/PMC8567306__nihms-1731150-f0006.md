caption: Interaction of interleukin-2 (IL-2) with its receptors to induce downstream
  signaling. Secreted IL-2 binds to IL-2Rα and subsequently forms the high affinity
  heterotrimeric receptor complex allowing the activation of downstream signaling.
  IL-2 receptor binding triggers the phosphorylation of the Janus kinase (JAK) signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Phosphorylated STAT molecules
  dimerize and then translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of
  target genes. Different immune cells express various versions of the IL-2 receptor,
  each with different dissociation constants affecting the ability of IL-2 to bind
  and activate the associated cells. Schematic was made using BioRender.com
