caption: Model of RNA selectivity and RIG-I activation. RIG-I exists in the autoinhibited
  state in the absence of RNA binding where the CARD2 (C2, blue) is interacting with
  the Hel2i (yellow). PAMP and non-PAMP RNAs are sampled initially by RIG-I's C-terminal
  RD (red). PAMP RNAs (e.g. 5′ppp blunt-ended dsRNAs) bind with a high affinity (pathway
  on the left) to RD and the helicase domains (Hel1, Hel2, Hel2i), and the complex
  undergoes an induced-fit to disrupt the CARD2-Hel2i interactions by rotation of
  the Hel2-Hel2i subdomains, which results in new interactions with the dsRNA. These
  complexes have high affinity and high ATPase activity, with the potential to and
  undergo downstream events like ubiquitination and/or oligomerization, which ultimately
  leads to signaling. The RD and helicase binds weakly to non-PAMP RNAs (e.g. dsRNAs
  with 5′-overhang) (pathway to the right), which results in non-productive complexes
  with low affinity and low ATPase activity that are unable to signal, and eventually
  dissociate.
