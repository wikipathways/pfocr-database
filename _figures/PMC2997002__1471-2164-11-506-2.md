caption: Gene list involved in TLR pathway generated by KEGG. Red indicates significantly
  increased expression; pink, not remarkably increased expression; blue, significantly
  decreased expression; cyan, not remarkably decreased expression; and gray, unchanged
  expression. White denotes genes that were not identified in the expression profile
  analysis.
