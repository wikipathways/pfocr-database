caption: Schematic diagram showing the basic interaction of microalga G. emersonii
  and endoparasite A. protococcarum. Similar to plant, G. emersonii cells can perceive
  pathogen via potential PRRs and initiate PTI. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was
  rapidly induced in response to infection. Meanwhile, ROS scavenging-related genes
  (glutathione, ferritin, CAT) were upregulated to eliminate excess ROS. Several HSP70
  and HSP90 were upregulated and may serve as putative R genes to recognize the effectors
  of pathogens and trigger ETI. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and endocytosis,
  which may be involved in regulating apoptotic cell death, were also upregulated
  to response to the infection. For endoparasite A. protococcarum, genes for carbohydrate-active
  enzymes, pathogen–host interaction, and putative effectors are significantly upregulated
  during infection. Endocytosis, phagosome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and SNARE
  interactions in vesicular transport pathway represent the KEGG enrichment pathways
  involved in the modulation of vacuole transport of intracellular parasitoid.
