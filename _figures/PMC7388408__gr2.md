caption: Glucose metabolic pathways in immune cells. The glucose metabolic pathway
  includes both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation
  activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) through PI3K-AMPK pathway.
  Low levels of NADPH and glutathione leads to increased levels of mitochondrial reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and decreased levels of ATP. It also contributes to mTORC1
  activation, directly or through elevated levels of kynurenine. mTORC1 activation
  facilitates glucose metabolism through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and
  Myc. In B cells, B cell activating factor (BAFF) and B cell receptor (BCR) signals
  increase glucose metabolism and glycolysis. This promotes pyruvate influx into the
  mitochondria, which is essential for the survival of long-lived plasma cells.
