caption: (A) FTH1P3 promotes proliferation and colony formation via acting as a miRNA
  sponge of miRNA-224-5p to activate frizzled 5 expression; (B) PTENP1 can inhibit
  proliferation and colony formation through acting as a ceRNA of miR-21 to increase
  PTEN expression; (C) up-regulated UCA1 promotes proliferation, metastasis and invasion,
  as well as inhibits cell apoptosis via modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway;
  (D) HOTAIR promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibits apoptosis
  by recruiting EZH2; (E) TUG1 promotes cell growth, proliferation, colony-forming
  ability and invasion; (F) FOXCUT promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion
  via increasing the expression levels of MMPs and VEGF-A, which is regulated by "FOXC1-
  FOXCUT pair".
