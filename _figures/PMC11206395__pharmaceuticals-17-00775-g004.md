caption: The therapeutic mechanism of polyphenols for depression. Depression is caused
  by extrinsic stress and dysregulation of neurotrophic factors in the brain. Quercetin
  and ferulic acid decrease the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
  IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Anthocyanins and ferulic acid upregulate the release of
  BDNF through the ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. Ferulic acid decreases the levels
  of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT)
