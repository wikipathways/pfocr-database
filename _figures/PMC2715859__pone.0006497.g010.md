caption: PrPC and TNAP are GPI-anchored membrane proteins, which majorly reside in
  rafts. Both have been described to interact with ECM proteins , ,  and to participate
  to cell signaling events. PrPC can instruct downstream signaling events, including
  ERK and CREB activation, by mobilizing a Cav/Fyn complex on neurites , –. In addition,
  it modulates the coupling of 5-HT receptors, with specific impact according to G
  protein-dependent pathway . The TNAP ectophosphatase may have different substrates.
  (i) By promoting PLP hydrolysis it contributes to the regulation of neurotransmitter
  synthesis . (ii) Its nucleotidase activity may have implications for purinergic
  signaling , –. (iii) TNAP may be active on phosphoproteins notably of the cell surface
  , . The identification of phospho-laminin as a TNAP substrate uncovers a novel role
  of this ectoenzyme in the regulation of ECM molecules. Laminin and the laminin receptor
  are important components of the perineural net (PN) and are known partners of PrPC.
  The interplay between PrPC, laminin and TNAP within multiprotein complexes may have
  implications for neuronal functions (survival, homeostasis, plasticity).
