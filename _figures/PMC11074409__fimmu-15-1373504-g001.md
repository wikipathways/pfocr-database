caption: Pro- and anti-tumor potential of microorganisms. The anti-tumor effect of
  bacteria occurs through stimulating inflammasome signaling pathways and by stimulating
  T lymphocyte proliferation and TNF alpha production, and by bacteriocins, mainly
  directed against other bacterial competitors, may exhibit oncolytic activity. Viruses
  stimulate carcinogenesis, with some having oncolytic activity (such as picornavirus
  ECHO-7). Bacteria and viruses can be used as vectors for the delivery of antitumor
  molecules. Fungi and animal parasites mainly induce inflammation. In addition, fungi
  contribute to the formation of bacterial biofilms, colonize tissues with bacteria
  and protect them against the immune system while synthesizing pro-tumor metabolites
  such as acetaldehyde, and parasites induce inflammation due to oxidative stress
  and mechanical damage to tissues
