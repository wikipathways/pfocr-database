caption: The NO-GAPDH-Siah1 cell death cascade in neurons. Severe stress in the brain
  induces the NO-GAPDH-Siah1 cell death pathway. Glutamate excitotoxicity is illustrated
  as an example of such severe stress. Stimulation of the NMDA receptor with toxic
  levels of glutamate leads to an influx of calcium that activates nNOS through calmodulin.
  Activated nNOS induces the nitrosylation of GAPDH. SNO-GAPDH binds Siah1, which
  in turn escorts GAPDH to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, GAPDH binds to p300/CBP
  and activates it via acetylation. P300/CBP induces cell death by activating p53-mediated
  transcription of cell death genes.
