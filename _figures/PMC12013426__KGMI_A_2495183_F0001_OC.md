caption: 'The mechanisms of gut microbiome inhibiting the initiation of cancers. A.
  Modulation of immune homeostasis: (1) Microbiota-derived cyclic di-AMP activates
  STING-dependent type I IFN production, leading to activation of innate immunity
  (including monocytes, NK cells and DCs); (2) Clostridium species modified bile acids
  to signal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to produce CXCL16, a chemokine that
  recruits NKT immune cells to perform antitumor surveillance in the liver. B. Inhibition
  of cancer related gene expression and oncogenic pathways: (1) Butyrate inhibits
  HDACs, inducing histone hyperacetylation to activate p21/WAF1 and drive G1 arrest;
  (2) Butyrate activates WAF1 via Sp1 sites (p53-independently), halting cell cycle
  and tumor proliferation; (3) SCFAs activate GPCRs, such as FFAR3/2 and GPR109A,
  in gut/immune cells, leading to beneficial effects on cancer prevention. C. Inflammation
  reduction: Hypoacylated LPS derived from intestinal Prevotella exhibits weak TLR4
  excitability and induces inflammatory tolerance in intestinal epithelial cells,
  thereby inhibiting the onset of CRC. D. Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction
  of apoptosis: (1) Clostridiales produced TMAO induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis
  in tumor cells by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase PERK and thus
  enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in TNBC. (2) Butyrate induces apoptosis
  (Bax and Bcl-2) and activates MAPK signaling to suppress proliferation/migration
  via endocan regulation, inhibiting cancer progression; (3) Certain SCFAs, such as
  PUFAs, inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth by blocking β-catenin and cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2); (4) SCFAs reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis in HCC cell lines
  through activation of GSK-3β, leading to β-catenin degradation. (E) Direct anti-tumor
  effects: (1) Firmicutes convert bile acids to lithocholic acid (LCA), which suppresses
  gallbladder cancer (GBC) by targeting GLS-glutamine metabolism to trigger ferroptosis;
  (2) Butyrate (Roseburia intestinalis) binds TLR5 on CD8+ T cells, activating NF-κB
  to boost activity; (3) Lactobacillus plantarum L168 and indole-3-lactic acid enhance
  IL12a production in dendritic cells via H3K27ac enrichment at IL12a enhancers, priming
  CD8+ T cell immunity to suppress tumor growth. (4) Clostridium butyricum inhibits
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, reshapes gut microbiota, elevates SCFAs, and activates
  GPR43/109A to suppress colorectal tumorigenesis'
