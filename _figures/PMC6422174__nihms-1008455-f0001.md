caption: Successful competition for antigen binding of dark zone GCBCs with are of
  sufficient affinity results in the generation of p-foxo1 through BCR mediated PI3K/Akt
  signaling (a) which promotes initial migration of these cells and “licenses” them
  to remain in the light zone. Additionally, BCR signaling may induce anti-apoptotic
  factors (b) which allow more time for the partly selected GCBCs to productively
  interact with cognate TFH cells. Upon such interaction, BCR and CD40 signaling synergistically
  lead to the expression of c-Myc and the activation of the mTORC1 pathway which induces
  the phosphorylation of S6, therefore fully engaging the process of positive selection
  (c). Positively selected LZ GCBCs migrate towards the DZ and their induced mTORC1-driven
  anabolic state readies them for intensive proliferation, which coincides with the
  acquisition of additional mutations catalyzed by AID. As c-Myc protein levels are
  diluted out with each cell division (d) DZ GCBCs need to be successful in binding
  to antigen in order to undergo another cycle of selection. Proliferating DZ GCBCs
  that fail to bind to antigen due to mutation-mediated reduced BCR affinity or function
  will undergo apoptosis.
