caption: Vitamin D pathway. 7‐DHC follows a two‐stage reaction involving ultraviolet‐B
  irradiation and thermal isomerization. Vitamin D is converted into 25‐hydroxyvitamin
  D3 (25[OH]D3) by a hydroxylation mechanism mediated by vitamin D 25 hydroxylase.
  Subsequently, 1α‐hydroxylase, regulated by PTH and FGF23, transforms 25(OH)D3 into
  its active form, 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3). The proteins 25(OH)D3 and
  1,25 (OH)2D3 mainly circulate bound to carrier proteins (DBP), but a small fraction
  circulates freely or bound to albumin. The internalization mechanism is produced
  mainly by DBP‐megalin (LRP2). However, in some cells this process can occur by binding
  to other proteins and even by passive diffusion. Finally, 1,25(OH)2D3binds to the
  VDR nuclear receptor, interacting with the RXRA, forming a heterodimer that allows
  transport to the cell nucleus. Genes involved in the vitamin D pathway are shown
  in grey. The regulatory pathway of the gene CYP27B1 (METTL1, METTL21B, FGF23, PTH)
  is represented with a dotted line. Endocytosis of the complex formed by LRP2 and
  CUBN requires DAB2, represented in the figure within a light grey circle. The mechanism
  of VD binding to the PDIA3 receptor is not included in the figure
