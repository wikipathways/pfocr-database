caption: A) A majority of cellular mRNAs are degraded by the deadenylation-dependent
  decay pathway. The cellular deadenylase complexes, CCR4-NOT, PARN or PAN2-PAN3 removes
  the poly(A) tail and subsequently, the body of the deadenylated mRNA is degraded
  by 5’-3’ or 3’-5’ decay mechanisms. In the 5’-3’ decay pathway, the Lsm1-7 protein
  complex binds to the 3’-end of the deadenylated mRNA and stimulates decapping by
  the DCP1-DCP2 enzyme complex that generates a monophosphorylated 5’-end. Following
  decapping, the mRNA body is degraded by the action of the 5’-3 exoribonuclease,
  XRN1. Most of the proteins involved in the 5’-3’ decay pathway are localized in
  P bodies. The 3’-5’ decay of the deadenylated mRNA is catalyzed by the 3’-5’ exoribonucleolytic
  activity of the exosome followed by the removal of the cap structure by the scavenger
  decapping enzyme, DCPS. B) The endonuclease-mediated decay pathway triggers the
  degradation of some mRNAs, including those recognized by cellular mRNA surveillance
  and stress response pathways like NMD, NGD, RNase L and IRE1. The decay is initiated
  by an endonuclease cleavage event followed by the digestion of the resulting unprotected
  fragments by exosome and XRN1. The figure is adapted from Fig. 1 in reference .
  Selected examples of viral proteins that interfere with the cellular mRNA decay
  machinery are provided. See text for details. * denotes that the SARS-CoV nsp1-induced
  endonuclease activity could be host-encoded.
