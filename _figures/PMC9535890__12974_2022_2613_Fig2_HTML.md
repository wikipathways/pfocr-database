caption: Mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia. The high energy consumption
  of microglia to maintain immune functions is regulated by mitochondria. Under normal
  circumstances, microglia mainly use glucose oxidation for energy supply. First,
  after being transported into the cell, glucose is converted into pyruvate through
  the glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate is then converted into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria,
  which participates in the TCA cycle and generates a small amount of energy. The
  subsequent ETC creates a chemical gradient by transferring electrons that powers
  the production of ATP. When being insulted by pathogenic factors (e.g., Aβ, p-Tau
  proteins, etc.) or in a state of stress, energy demands of microglia increase. Microglia
  exert metabolic flexibility to switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis for energy supply.
  In addition, microglia also use fatty acids and glutamine as alternative energy
  sources under some conditions
