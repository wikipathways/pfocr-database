caption: The enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis were in green and orange
  arrows indicated the catabolism pathway. Major metabolites (Blue) derived from those
  metabolic pathways are included in the MRMHR quantitation assay. The non-stable
  intermediated metabolites (Red) were not included in the method.
