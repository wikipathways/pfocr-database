caption: Cells at high density rarely proliferate (on the left). They have active
  Hippo signaling (YAP is cytoplasmic), inactive canonical NF-κB (p65/p50 is cytoplasmic)
  and inactive noncanonical NF-κB signaling (NIK is low, p100 is not processed to
  p52, and RELB is cytoplasmic). Upon loss of TRAF3, Hippo and canonical NF-κB signaling
  remain unaltered, but noncanonical NF-κB signaling is activated (on the right).
  NIK levels rise in the absence of TRAF3, activates the downstream cascade, resulting
  in increased p100 processing to p52. The RELB/p52 complex activates innate immune
  response genes, including antigen presentation and interferon pathway components.
  It also overrides CKIs, induces CYCLIN D1 expression, and prevents entering G0 as
  shown by increased number of cells with active CDK2 and phosphorylated RB. Altogether
  it results in cell over-proliferation at high density.
