caption: S100A9 binds to Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate downstream pathways
  for biological effects. S100A9 binds to TLR4, activating the MAPK pathway and subsequently
  NF‐κB, resulting in pro‐inflammatory cytokines release and pro‐inflammatory effects.
  S100A9 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation via TLR4‐Myd88 and releases IL‐1β,
  leading to an exacerbation of inflammation. MAPK activation disrupts endothelial
  barrier function by breakdown F‐actin, ZO‐1, and occludin. Simultaneously, NF‐κB
  activation induces cytokine secretion and inhibits apoptosis through caspase 9/3
  downregulation. S100A9‐TLR4 promotes apoptosis and autophagy through Rac1/2 activation
  of MAPK and PI3K‐AKT pathways. Additionally, their interaction normalizes ketogenesis
  by activating mTORC1 and inhibiting PPARα. p38, p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase;
