caption: Major NAD biosynthetic pathways in lower eukaryotes and invertebrates vs.
  mammals and the enzymatic reaction of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt).
  (A) The NAD biosynthetic pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
  invertebrates, such as C. elegans and Drosophila. The de novo pathway from tryptophan
  is not shown in this scheme. Pnc1, nicotinamidase; Npt1, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase;
  Nma1 and Nma2, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 and 2; Qns1,
  NAD synthetase; Sir2, silencing information regulator 2; Nic, nicotinamide; Na,
  nicotinic acid; NaMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide. (B) The NAD biosynthetic pathway
  from nicotinamide in mammals. The pathways from tryptophan and nicotinic acid are
  not shown in this scheme. Sirt1 and other mammalian sirtuins are representative
  enzymes that catalyze NAD for their enzymatic activities. Nampt, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;
  Nmnat, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide.
  (C) The reaction catalyzed by Nampt. PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate; PPi,
  inorganic pyrophosphate.
