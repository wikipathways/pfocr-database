caption: 'Tumor cells become and stay dormant via signaling from the surrounding tissue
  (niche). High levels of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) in the proximal
  region of primary tissue cause activation of Smad and upregulation of the apoptosis
  suppressor gene bcl2, which in turn induces dormancy in resident tumor cells. Tumor
  cells have also been shown to enter dormancy within dormant microvasculature, which
  is believed to occur because of characteristically low levels of TGF-β1 and periostin
  (POSTN). Osteoblast derived growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6), and stromal cell derived
  bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) in the bone marrow also induces tumor cell dormancy.
  GAS6 is recognized by tyrosine kinase receptor Axl, which activates the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. BMP7
  is received by BMP receptor 2 (BMPR2), which causes activation of cell cycle inhibitor
  p21, upregulation of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
  Strong evidence suggests tumor cells respond to external stimuli by shifting the
  balance of the ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK pathways: in dormant tumor cells the p38 MAPK
  pathway is generally more activated than ERK MAPK.'
