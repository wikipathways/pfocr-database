caption: Kinetics of accumulation of proteins involved in carbon and plastidial metabolisms
  in M. truncatula developing seeds. Some enzymes and substrates leading to the synthesis
  of starch and/or oil are shown. Not shown are other contributions to oil metabolism,
  such as the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. FAS, Fatty acid synthesis; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; TAG, triacylglyceride.
