caption: The individual involvement of the products of the eight studied genes (shown
  in red colour) in the (a) RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK, (b) PI3K/AKT, and (c) GNAQ/11 signalling
  transduction pathways. BRAF (shown in dark red colour) was the only gene found mutated
  in a single patient in our series. All three members of the RAS family of GTPases,
  that is, the HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, function as regulated binary switches and, following
  growth factor stimulation via the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), bind and activate
  downstream effectors, mainly BRAF and PI3K, leading sequentially to the activation
  of the ERK and AKT kinases, operating in the two major signal transduction pathways,
  respectively. Additional pathways, such as the apoptosis pathway and the CDK pathway
  leading to cell cycle progression, can be further activated from these downstream
  effectors of the two major pathways. Upstream of RAS and PI3K, c-KIT can be also
  mutated or amplified in melanoma and in turn activate the downstream effectors of
  the two major pathways. An alternative pathway via the endothelin receptor (ETR),
  involving two heterotrimeric G-α-proteins, that is, GNAQ and GNA11, can also activate
  the BRAF/MEK/MAPK/ERK pathway and appears to be important for both normal melanocyte
  development and melanoma formation. Finally, MITF plays also an essential role in
  melanocyte-specific transcription, exhibiting multiple regulatory functions. mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor;
  TFs, transcription factors.
