caption: The membrane FAS-R (blue) forms a trimer upon ligand binding (TNFSF13, red).
  The adaptor molecule FADD (green) then binds to the death domain of FAS-R through
  its own death domain. The amino terminus of FADD facilitates binding to caspase-8
  (maroon oval). Caspase-8 self-activates through proteolytic cleavage into active
  caspase subunits, which can cleave other effector caspases (3, 6, 9), eventually
  leading to DNA degradation, membrane blebbing, and other hallmarks of apoptosis.
  In most cell types (Type II), caspase-8 catalyzes the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic
  BH3-only protein BID (orange) into its truncated form, tBID. tBID engages anti-apoptotic
  members of the family (e.g. BCL-2), allowing pro-apoptotic members (e.g. BAX) to
  translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus permeabilizing the membrane
  and facilitating release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c (tan). Cytochrome
  c release reinforces the cellular apoptotic drive through the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. Death receptors 4/5 (TNFSF10) appear to have identical intracellular pathway
  signaling to FAS receptor .
