caption: Studies began for all rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal
  pathway, and random assignment to either rAAV injection, rAAV-shRNA ΔFosB or rAAV-NT
  shRNA. Viruses were injected 5 days after the 6-OHDA lesion. More than 3 weeks after
  the 6-OHDA lesion and 3 weeks after the virus injection, the apomorphine test was
  used to confirm complete lesions; animals selected to continue in the study were
  assessed on the following day with the cylinder and stepping tests to determine
  baseline motor deficits. One week after this assessment, daily treatment with L-Dopa
  methyl ester plus benserazide (12/12 mg/kg, i.p.) started for all rats (grey arrow).
  On days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 18, the L-Dopa motor response was evaluated by rating
  contralateral rotation and AIMs. On day 19, the cylinder and stepping tests were
  performed again to determine changes in comparison to baseline. After these tests,
  animals were euthanized for histological and molecular analyses.
