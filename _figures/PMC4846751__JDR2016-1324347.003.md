caption: Simplified scheme of the EP4 signaling in PGE2-mediated hypertrophic actions.
  In response to PGE2, activation of EP4 transactivates epidermal growth factor receptors
  (EGFR), which can result in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 in turn activated signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (Stat3) pathway. Once Stat3 signaling is activated in the nucleus, the hypertrophic
  genes will be expressed to mediate the protein synthesis. In addition, cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2) expression is also stimulated by Stat3 signaling, which will further metabolize
  the formation of PGE2 from arachidonic acid (AA) and trigger the greater activation
  of Stat3 signaling in a positive feedback loop. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein
  kinase A (PKA) or cAMP/exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) pathways
  are not involved in the PGE2-EP4-mediated hypertrophic actions in ventricular myocytes.
