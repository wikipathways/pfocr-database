caption: Tumor angiogenesis leads to non-functional blood vessels. Small tumors have
  an avascular growth, receiving nutrients and oxygen by diffusion. When they reach
  a certain size and the levels of pro-angiogenic factors (such as VEGF) are higher
  than the anti-angiogenic factors, an angiogenic switch takes place. VEGF signaling
  through its receptor VEGFR2 promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration and
  survival to by the activation of multiple pathways, which lead to angiogenesis.
  Tumor blood vessels are poorly covered by pericytes and leaky leading to increased
  hypoxia. Hypoxia in solid tumors is also generated for the rapid growth of tumors
  that increase the oxygen demand that cannot be supplied [13]. Pericytes secrete
  Ang1, which binds with the Tie-2 receptor in endothelial cells. Ang 1 promotes the
  interaction between endothelial cells and pericytes to stabilize the new vessels’
  structure. Nevertheless, the tumor vessels are not mature because the pericyte coverage
  is partial. Consequently, they have high permeability and are not functional resulting
  in a poor drug delivery and ineffective therapies. Created with BioRender.com, accessed
