caption: Schematic model. PMMA particles induce TRAF6-dependent signaling by undefined
  mechanism. Cellular levels of the E2 UBC13 increase coinciding with TRAF6 poly-ubiquitination.
  These events facilitate binding of NEMO and TAK1, and activate the latter. IKK2
  is recruited to NEMO and activated through its phosphorylation (p) by TAK1 and in
  turn it phosphorylates IκB leading to activation of NF-κB. Knockdown of TRAF6 or
  deletion of TAK1 blunts NEMO ubiquitination and hinders activation of NF-κB pathway.
