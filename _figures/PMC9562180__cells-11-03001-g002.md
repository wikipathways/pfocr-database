caption: Cytokines regulate insulin sensitivity in insulin target cells. Activation
  of the insulin receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and initiates
  insulin signal transduction. Activation of TLR2/4 and TNFR results in the promotion
  of NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. The serine kinases IKK and JNK-1 could reduce
  the signaling of IRS-1 and impair downstream insulin signaling. Moreover, the activation
  of IKK causes phosphorylation and degradation of IκB; thus, NF-κB could translocate
  into the nucleus. JNK promotes the formation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which
  in turn transactivates inflammatory gene expression by NF-κB and AP-1, further contributing
  to insulin resistance. PPAR-γ suppresses the NF-κB transcription activity and upregulates
  IRS protein, which favors the improvement insulin sensitivity. LTB4 promotes JNK
  activation through BLT-1 and leads to subsequent IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, ultimately
  promoting cellular insulin resistance. Gal-3 directly inhibits the insulin receptor
  and impairs all the major steps in the insulin signaling pathway. Additionally,
  IL6 induces SOCS-3 and leads to proteasomal degradation of IRS-1 through binding
  to the IL-6 receptor. IL-1β stimulates the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus
  through IL-1R1, promoting inflammatory gene expression. Also, lipid metabolites,
  including FFAs, ceramides, and DAG, activate the PKC to impair IRS-1, which directly
  interfere with insulin signaling.
