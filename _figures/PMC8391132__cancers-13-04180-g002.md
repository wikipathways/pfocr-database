caption: Model of miRNA sponging pathways. (A) circRNA sponging occurs upon expression
  of circRNA containing multiple miRNA target regions that function to sequester miRNA
  resulting in mRNA target upregulation. (B) The canonical RNAi pathway sees miRNA
  being loaded into the RISC complex allowing targeted degradation of corresponding
  mRNA resulting in down regulation. (C) miRNA sponging can be induced artificially
  through the expression of a miRNA cassette that contains multiple miRNA target sites
  for the miRNA of interest. Reporter genes are often included for selection or screening.
