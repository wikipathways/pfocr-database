caption: Redoxosome formation in IL-1 signaling. Redoxosome (redox active endosomes
  which produce O2•−/H2O2) formation has been demonstrated for the activation of NOX2
  by IL-1 in MCF7 cells (). After docking of IL-1 to IL-1R1 MyD88 is recruited as
  effector, and initiates endosome formation. Then, Rac-1 in its GTP-bound conformation
  together with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is transferred to the membrane, resulting
  in the recruitment of the second effector, NOX2 with all its subunits. O2•− produced
  by NOX leaves the endosome via anionic channels (AC) and is dismutated to H2O2 by
  SOD1. This creates an oxidative environment, which promotes docking of IRAK and
  TRAF6 to the receptor complex finally leading to NF-κB activation. An analogous
  pathway works in TNF signaling where TRADD and RIP1 are recruited instead of MyD88
  and TRAF2 instead of TRAF6.
