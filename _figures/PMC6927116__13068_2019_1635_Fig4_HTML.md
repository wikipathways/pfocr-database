caption: Working model of TOR and SnRK/CKIN family of kinases and their major functions
  in Chlamydomonas stress biology. Chlamydomonas rapamycin-sensitive TOR complex 1
  (TORC1) consists of TOR, LST8 and RAPTOR. The inhibition of TORC1 by pharmacological
  means (rapamycin, AZD-8055 or Torin1) has enabled the studies of TOR pathway functions
  in Chlamydomonas, whereas the components of TORC2 have not been identified in photosynthetic
  organisms. When the conditions are conducive to growth (i.e., in the absence of
  abiotic stresses), the TORC1 complex promotes anabolic processes such as protein
  synthesis and therefore growth and represses stress-induced responses such as TAG
  synthesis and the induction of autophagy. TORC1 has also been shown to positively
  regulate the levels of inositol polyphosphates (InsPs), InsP7 and InsP8, to promote
  growth and inhibit TAG accumulation. Although the members of the SnRK and CKIN family
  of kinases in Chlamydomonas and microalgae are not well characterized to date, several
  studies have shown the functions of some members in the acclimation of cells to
  abiotic stresses, including the adjustment of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulation
  of TAG and sulfur (S) assimilation during sulfur deprivation. The relationships
  that are supported by experiments are shown in solid black lines, whereas the dotted
  grey lines with question marks represent the hypothesized regulatory links based
  on previous findings in other model organisms that require further studies in Chlamydomonas.
  The positive and negative regulatory relationships are represented by arrows and
  T-bars, respectively
