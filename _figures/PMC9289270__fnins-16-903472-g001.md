caption: Regulation mechanism of miRNA on microglia polarization. (1) Signaling pathway
  of M1 polarization regulated by miRNA. miR-21-5p acts on microglia through releasing
  pro-inflammatory substances, while miR-214-5p suppress the expression of CXCR5 and
  other pro-inflammatory substances like IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α. NF-κB is thought to be
  a common pro-inflammatory signal pathway. miR-409-3p can downregulate Nr4a2 (a suppressor
  of NF-κB) to activate microglia. MiR-138 may activate the TLR7 to promote NF-κB.
  (2) Signaling pathway of M2 polarization regulated by miRNA. The exosomes containing
  miR-223-3p, miR-30d-5p, or miR-126 may suppress the synthesis of inflammatory factors
  to inhibit the activation of microglia. There is some genetic expression may influence
  the polarization of microglia.miR-146a-5p may downregulate IRK1 and NFT5 to inhibit
  the activation of microglia. MiR-124-3p may suppress the expression of MYH9.miR-26b-5p
  may suppress the expression of CH25H. miR-873-5p may suppress the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which is very common in inflammation. All these three miRNA can inhibit
  microglia polarization. TLR4 signal pathway is a common way to promote inflammation,
  while the inhibition of it can suppress the process. Exosomes of miR-93 may suppress
  the NF-κB signaling pathway through downregulating TLR4 expression. Similar exosomes
  of miR-216a-5p may activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the expression of
  NF-κB through the downregulation of TLR4 to promote the M2 microglia. IKK is a stimulators
  of NF-κB. miR-199b may downregulate IKK to inhibit NF-κB and microglia activation.
