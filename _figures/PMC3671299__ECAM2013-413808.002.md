caption: Schematic diagram of Aβ accumulation mechanism. This schematic diagram summarizes
  the factors influencing Aβ accumulation and the molecular mechanisms involved in
  the pathways for overproduction and impaired clearance of toxic Aβ peptides. Several
  potential targets for AD treatment, such as AChE, LRP1, and RAGE, and certain components
  involved in the control of cerebral blood flow and the autophagic pathway are suggested
  by their direct involvement in Aβ accumulation mechanism.
