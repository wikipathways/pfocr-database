caption: Physiological and pharmacological determinants of the feeding. The determinants
  of the pharyngeal function are distinct in the two contexts probed in this study.
  A, when nematodes are on food, the cholinergic transmission stimulates pumping that
  underpins physiological feeding. The determinants of the pumping rate are EAT-2
  and EAT-18, transducing the MC cholinergic signal in the pharyngeal muscle (, ).
  The subunits of the nicotinic receptor ACR-6, ACR-9, ACR-10, DEG-3, ACC-3, UNC-63,
  the calcineurin subunit CNB-1, and the ancillary protein RIC-3 were identified as
  additional molecular determinants of pumping rate on food. B, the pharmacological
  overstimulation of the cholinergic pathway by aldicarb or levamisole drives activation
  body wall muscle that imposes inhibition of the pumping rate. In this context, a
  lev-1 and unc-29 containing receptor in the body wall musculature is involved in
  this response. The evidence suggests the subunits of the acetylcholine-gated ion
  channel UNC-63, UNC-29, LEV-1, ACR-2, ACR-12 and their auxiliary proteins LEV-9,
  LEV-10, and RIC-3 are important in modulating the body wall muscle activity that
  couples an inhibition of pharyngeal function. Interestingly, there is no unc-38
  dependence to this response precluding the classic L-type receptor in mediating
  the distal inhibition of feeding.
