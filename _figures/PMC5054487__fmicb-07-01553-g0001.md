caption: Kinetic model of metabolic complementation. Two cell types (purple and gray)
  can both potentially produce the product P starting from a substrate S, passing
  through an intermediate metabolite X. The enzymes can be freely allocated to the
  pathway's reaction and consumption of P. The intermediate (X) and final (P) metabolites
  can cross the cell membranes by diffusion. Both bacteria and the host need the final
  product to grow; leading to consumption rates JP, 0, JP, 1, and JP, 2. In the case
  of the Buchnera/Serratia/Cinara consortium, the pathway is completely split across
  the two populations (ES, 2 and EX, 1 are absent).
