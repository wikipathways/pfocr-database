caption: 'Betaglycan is internalized via a (1) clathrin-independent (lipid raft/caveolin-mediated)
  pathway or (2) a clathrin-dependent mechanism. Clathrin dependent endocytosis increases
  signal transduction via (3) betaglycan association with SARA in early endosomes.
  This SARA-betaglycan interaction leads to recycling of betaglycan back to the cell
  surface to continue signal transduction. To degrade betaglycan and downregulate
  signaling, (4) TβRII phosphorylates betaglycan at Threonine 841, increasing (5)
  betaglycan association with β-arrestin2 and (6) caveolin-mediated internalization
  and degradation of betaglycan. Additionally, betaglycan’s cytoplasmic domain can
  be (7) cleaved by γ-secretase to release the cytoplasmic domain and enhance growth
  factor signaling. Abbreviations: CS: Chondroitin Sulfate, HS: Heparan Sulfate, T841:
  Threonine 841, TβRII: Transforming Growth Factor β Receptors II, SARA: SMAD Anchor
  for Receptor Activation.'
