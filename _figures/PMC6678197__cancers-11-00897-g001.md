caption: 'Canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. miRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus
  via their own promoters or host gene promoters by RNA polymerase II or III, forming
  the primary miRNA transcripts which can range from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides
  long. Pri-miRNA transcripts are polyadenylated and capped, then subjected to a microprocessing
  cleavage event by an RNase III type enzyme, Drosha, and its binding partner DiGeorge
  syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) to form a 60–120 nucleotide long precursor
  miRNA transcript (pre-miRNA). After the cleavage event, pre-miRNAs are then exported
  out of the nucleus by exportin-5 to cytoplasm and again subjected to a microprocessing
  event by another RNase II enzyme, Dicer, to form a miRNA duplex. Unwinding of the
  miRNA duplex occurs and one strand is usually degraded, while the other is loaded
  into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). Once loaded, the RISC searches for
  targets of the miRNA in the genome. Once bound to a target mRNA, the RISC may induce
  negative expression of the mRNA by three ways: 1) mRNA destabilization and degradation,
  2) mRNA translational inhibition, or 3) mRNA cleavage. The path at which the mRNA
  is regulated depends upon multiple factors of the mature miRNA.'
