caption: Potential cellular pathways modulated by statins in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interacts strongly
  with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), allowing the virus to enter
  host cells, including endothelial and epithelial cells. Statins can upregulate the
  expression of ACE2 on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells. Recognition
  of SARS-CoV-2 by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of leukocytes activates
  the MYD88–NF-κB pathway and the innate immune response of the host, with the release
  of proinflammatory mediators. Statins can inhibit the MYD88–NF-κB proinflammatory
  pathway and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Statins can exert anti-thrombotic
  effects by reducing the expression of tissue factor on activated endothelial cells
  and decreasing the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-induced thromboxane A2 (TXA2)
  synthesis by platelets. Statins could reduce cholesterol content in the plasma membrane
  of SARS-CoV-2 host cells, thereby destabilizing viral replication phases. Through
  all these mechanisms, statins might prove beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.
