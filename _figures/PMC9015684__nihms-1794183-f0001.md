caption: Schematic illustration of biphasic concentration-dependent regulation of
  Cav-1 gene expression and GSK-3β activity by fluoxetine in astrocytes. Fluoxetine
  is an agonist to serotonin 2B receptors (5-HT2BR). Acute treatment with fluoxetine
  at low concentrations (green arrows) stimulates Src which phosphorylates epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGFR) at Y845 residue and in turn activates phosphoinositide
  3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway. The AKT phosphorylation by fluoxetine at
  low concentrations inhibits c-Fos gene expression and subsequently decreases caveolin-1
  (Cav-1) gene expression (chronic effects) that in turn decreases membrane content
  of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), induces phosphorylation and stimulation
  of PI3K, and elevates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β) phosphorylation thus suppressing
  its activity. At higher concentrations, fluoxetine (red arrows) stimulates metalloproteinase
  (MMP) and induces shedding of growth factor which stimulates EGFR and activates
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2
  (ERK1/2) signal pathway. The ERK1/2 phosphorylation by fluoxetine at high concentrations
  stimulates cFos gene expression and subsequently increases Cav-1 gene expression
  (chronic effects), which acts on PTEN/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β in an inverse fashion. (From
