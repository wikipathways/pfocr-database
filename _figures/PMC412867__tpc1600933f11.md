  .(B) Pathway proposed by . The difference between these two pathways is the positioning
  of Ca2+ spiking between DMI1-DMI2 and DMI3, and the combination of Has and root
  hair branching into RHD.(C) New pathway, in which our results are integrated into
  the already published results. From our results, we can conclude that DMI2/NORK,
  DMI1, DMI3, and its downstream ProMtENOD11:GUS expression are not required for the
  early NF-induced morphological responses. Therefore, we propose that very soon after
  NF perception via LysM proteins and before DMI2/NORK, DMI1, and DMI3, the pathway
  forms a split. One part, including the rapid NF-induced Ca2+ influx, branches off
  to root hair reorientation/Has and RHD, and the other part via DMI2/NORK to ProMtENOD11:GUS
  expression. Because we only used ProMtENOD11:GUS as a NF reporter gene, we can only
  make a statement about this gene, and we do not want to exclude the possibility
  that in DMI2/NORK mutants other NF-induced genes are expressed.
