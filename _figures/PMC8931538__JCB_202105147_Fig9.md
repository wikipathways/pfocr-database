caption: 'Model of CIL regulation by JAM-A. Left: In migrating cells, JAM-A is localized
  at membrane protrusions and is linked to αvβ5 integrin by tetraspanins CD9 and/or
  CD81. Tyr280-phosphorylated JAM-A recruits Csk which limits but does not completely
  inhibit the activity of αvβ5 integrin-associated Src. Through an as yet unknown
  mechanism, JAM-A limits but does not completely inhibit the activity of CD81-associated
  Rac1. Downstream effectors of the Src–Erk1/2 pathway (paxillin, WRC) and of Rac1
  (WRC) remain active and support cell migration by promoting CMA dynamics and protrusive
  activity. Right: At cell–cell contacts between colliding cells, JAM-A''s homophilic
  activity results in JAM-A clustering, resulting in strong inhibition of Src and
  Rac1 and their downstream effectors paxillin and the WRC. As a consequence, CMAs
  are stabilized and protrusive activity is downregulated, preventing migration across
  collided cells. Components with increased activity after JAM-A depletion are highlighted
  by red frames. Abbreviations: CMA, cell-matrix adhesions; WRC, Wave regulatory complex.'
