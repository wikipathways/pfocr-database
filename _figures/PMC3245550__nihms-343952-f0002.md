caption: Arf and Arl function in the secretory pathway and in specialized transport.
  A. Arf proteins have distinct localizations and functions in the ER-Golgi system.
  Arf1 and Arf4 localize to the early cis-Golgi and Arf3 specifically localizes to
  the trans Golgi network (TGN). In addition to the recruitment of coat proteins (COPI
  , GGA, AP1) to the Golgi, Arf1 binds to CERT and FAPP2 to mediate the transport
  of ceramide and glucosylceramide lipids from the cis to the trans Golgi. At the
  ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Arf1 and its GEF GBF1 act with COPII
  to regulate the formation of lipid droplets (LD) and for replication of several
  viruses. The CAPS protein, involved in regulated secretion, is recruited to the
  TGN by Arf4 and Arf5. At the ER Sar1, activated by Sec12, recruits the COPII coat
  allowing vesicle transport to the Golgi.B. In retinal cells Arf4 binds specifically
  to rhodopsin in the TGN membrane and, together with FIP3, ASAP and Rab11, it facilitates
  the transport of rhodopsin in transport vesicles from the inner segment to the outer
  segment, a specialized cilium. Arl3 has been localized in the connecting cilum and
  RP2, an Arl3 GAP, localizes to the TGN, the basal body and the membrane adjacent
  to the connecting cilium.C. In primary cilia, Arl6 recruits the BBSome coat complex
  that facilitates the transport of membrane proteins into the cilium. Arl13 is localized
  to the cilium and has been implicated in intraflagellar transport.
