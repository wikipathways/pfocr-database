caption: Effect of Indoxyl sulfate in atherosclerosis. Schematic presentation of the
  Indoxyl sulfate pathway is linked to atherosclerosis. Tryptophan is metabolized
  by the gut microbiota into indole, and indole is absorbed into the circulation.
  In the liver, indole is metabolized to indoxyl sulfate. In chronic kidney disease
  and dysbiosis conditions, kidneys are incapable of clearing indoxyl sulfate. This
  results in the accumulation of indoxyl sulfate. Systemic inflammation caused by
  indoxyl sulfate can cause coronary calcification and chronic cardiovascular abnormalities,
  eventually leading to atherosclerosis.
