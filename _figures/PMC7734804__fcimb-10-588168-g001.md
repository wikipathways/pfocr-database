caption: Initial establishment of anti-viral state via innate immune responses to
  DENV infection. As soon as the DENV invades host cells, the TLRs (blue panel, left)
  and RLRs (pink panel) recognize the viral RNA and induce a series of signals to
  establish a state of emergency. As described in the text, the series of signaling
  lead to mitochondrial damage and release of the organelle DNA (blue panel, right),
  furthering type I interferon responses. This antiviral state in the initial host
  cells is able to extend up to the adjoining cells via IFN signaling. Various non-coding
  RNAs (as described in the text) regulate different targets in the innate immune
  responses (demonstrated above) including the complement system pathway (not included
  in the above figure).
