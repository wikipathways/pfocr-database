caption: 'An unorthodox A. aceti CAC oxidizes acetate. The gray arrows indicate CAC
  genes that are not found in a draft A. aceti 1023 genome sequence (Kappock et al.,
  unpublished). Each has a functional replacement. Using periplasmic dehydrogenases,
  A. aceti produces large quantities of acetic acid from ethanol and must contend
  with a constant influx of the former. Together with a complete oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway, this variant CAC functions in the eight-electron oxidation of acetic acid:
  CH3COOH + 2 O2 → 2 CO2 + 2 H2O. This pathway skips AckA, Acs, and SCS (sucCD), the
  only steps that would be directly influenced by cytoplasmic nucleotide pools, and
  reduces the number of enzymes that have free CoA substrates from two to one. The
  initial electron acceptors, two NAD+, one FAD, and one ubiquinone (presumed to be
  Q9 in A. aceti), would give a lower energy yield than a canonical CAC but have an
  additional irreversible step, the Mqo-mediated quinone reduction. Genes for the
  glyoxylate shunt enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are not found in A.
