caption: Regulation of MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and G2-M checkpoint by members of the family
  miR-125 and members of miR-let-7c~99a, miR-125a~let-7e~99b, miR-100~let-7a-2, and
  miR-206~133b clusters in cervical cancer. MAPK cell signaling is triggered by MEK-1
  activation via TRIB2 and HOXA1 conducing to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thereby provoking
  apoptosis reduction and inducing proliferation, migration, and invasion. This pathway
  is regulated by downregulation of TRIB2 and HOXA1 by the family miR-99 clustered
  in miR-let-7c~99a, miR-125a~let-7e~99b, and miR-100~let-7a-2. The members of these
  clusters are diminished in cervical cancer. MST2 inhibits Raf-1 and activates LAST2/YAP,
  reducing Ras-MEK-ERK activation, thus diminishing proliferation and inducing apoptosis,
  respectively. The oncomiR-133b from the cluster miR-133b~206 inhibits the tumor
  suppressor MST2. As well as CDC42 and RhoA that in turn inactivates Plexin B1 and
  PTEN increasing PI3K-PDK1-AKT-mTOR signaling, thus augmenting translation. MiR-125a
  from the cluster miR-125a~let-7e~99b counteracts the effect of miR-133b through
  the downregulation of PIK3CD, inhibiting PI3K-PDK1-AKT-mTOR signaling. The family
  miR-99 reduces mTOR protein expression, having an opposite effect to the miR-206~133b
  cluster. The cell cycle is arrested by DNA damage via ATM and ATR activation consecutively
  by the activation of Chk1/2 blocking CDC25 hampering CDK1 stopping transition from
  G2 to M. ATM and ATR prevent Bora activation conducing to Aurora A, PlK1 and MDM2
  inactivation, thereby stabilizing p53 and activating miR-34 family transcription.
  Also, p53 is activated directly by Chk1/2, ATR, and ATM. In cervical cancer PlK1
  is upregulated because miR-100 from the cluster miR-100~let-7a-2 is downregulated,
  promoting MDM2 increase and contributing to p53 decrease, with a concomitant miR-34
  family shrink increasing protein translation, proliferation, and apoptosis reduction.
  In bold are the miRNAs with effect on genes with validated experimental data.
