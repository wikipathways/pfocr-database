caption: 'The miRNA–mRNA interaction networks containing five cell proliferation and
  differentiation related pathways. The dot indicates miRNA, and the box indicates
  a target gene that had a negative correlation with a given miRNA. Red indicates
  up-regulated, green indicates down-regulated, and yellow indicates a miRNA that
  was up-regulated in a given comparison combination and was down-regulated in other
  comparison combinations. The five pathways are FoxO signaling pathway, MAPK signaling
  pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway.
  The miRNA–mRNA pairs in each pathway are shown in Additional file : Table S3'
