caption: Toll-like 4 receptor signaling in MCs. TLR4 triggering occurs after TLR4/MD2-complex
  dimerization. Although CD14 has been detected in MCs at mRNA level, its function
  in LPS recognition has not been completely elucidated. Signaling from TLR4 receptor
  on MCs could occur from PM or endosomes, however, internalization-dependent and
  -independent activation of some elements of the cascade remains to be proven (see
  text for more references). MyD88-dependent pathway requires the participation of
  the Src kinases Fyn and Lyn. Lyn induces the activation of IRAK1/4, which in consequence
  activates TRAF6 and TAK1 proteins; on the other hand, Fyn controls PP2A/PKCα/βII
  axis that negatively regulates signaling. At TAK1, signal bifurcates into the IKK-
  and the MAPKs- dependent pathways. IKK activates NFĸB transcription factor, which
  translocates to the nucleus to start production of inflammatory cytokines. On the
  other hand, phosphorylation of MAPKs activates AP-1 and ATF2, which contribute to
  inflammatory reactions. Signaling cascades are also linked to secretory control
  as PKCα/βII regulates VAMP3+ vesicles, IKK phosphorylates SNAP-23, and ERK1/2 activates
  TACE, all of which control TNF-α release. Other molecules have been described to
  participate in TLR4 signaling such as Ca2+, and PI3K/AKT cascade, which also contribute
  to TNF-α secretion. Figure created with Biorender.com.
