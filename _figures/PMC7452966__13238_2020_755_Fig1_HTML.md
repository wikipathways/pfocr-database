caption: Amino acid metabolism in pluripotency regulation. Threonine/methionine metabolism
  contribute to pluripotency regulation by providing SAM for DNA and histone methylation
  in PSCs. The threonine dehydrogenase TDH is highly expressed in mESCs, maintaining
  a high ratio of SAM/SAH that is correlated with high H3K4me3 levels. TDH expression
  is positively regulated by PRMT5 and negatively regulated by microRNA-9. Metabolism
  of glutamine and glucose regulates pluripotency through α-KG, which is a cofactor
  for Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases (JMDH) and the ten-eleven translocation
  family of enzymes (TETs) that are involved in DNA demethylation. The cellular level
  of L-proline is fine-tuned by the amino acid starvation response (AAR) pathway Gcn2-Eif2α-Atf4.
  Excessive supplementation with L-proline leads to ESC differentiation. Appropriate
  intracellular synthesis of L-proline safeguards PSC pluripotency
