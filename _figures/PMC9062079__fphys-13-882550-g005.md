caption: Cellular and regional differences in AQP expression that contribute to the
  water influx, outflow and efflux in the lens. Apical and basal tips from adjacent
  fiber cells interact to form the anterior and posterior sutures, respectively, that
  function as an extracellular influx pathway that directs ions and water into the
  lens and traverses the lens extracellular diffusion barrier to deliver water to
  the lens core. The fiber cell tips of both sutures contain AQP0, but only the apical
  tips of fiber cells in inner cortex that form the anterior suture contain AQP5.
  In the inner cortex of this anterior influx zone changes in zonular tension dynamically
  regulate the trafficking of AQP5 to the apical tips of fiber cells to modulate the
  flow of water from the anterior suture into fiber cells in this region. In the lens
  core we propose that water uptake is mediated mainly by AQP5 rather than truncated
  AQP0. Once delivered to the lens core water flows out towards the equatorial surface
  for the lens via an intracellular pathway mediated by gap junctions. In the inner
  cortical region of this outflow pathway we propose that the PH2O of fiber cells
  is reduced relative to the PH2O of gap junctions to facilitate the cell-to-cell
  movement of water. This reduction in plasma membrane PH2O is facilitated in part
  by recruitment of AQP0 to junctional structures that restrict the extracellular
  space and AQP5 to plaque like structures on the broad sides of fiber cells that
  have a similar distribution to gap junction plaques. Once water reaches the lens
  periphery it can efflux the lens via AQP1 and AQP5 in epithelial cells and AQP5
  and AQP0 in differentiating fiber cells located at the lens equator. In this efflux
  zone PH2O can also be dynamically regulated by changes in AQP5 membrane trafficking
  in response to changes in zonular tension.

    water reaches the lens periphery it can efflux the lens via AQP1 and AQP5 in epithelial

    In this efflux zone PH2O can also be dynamically regulated by changes in AQP5
