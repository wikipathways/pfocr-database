caption: 'CYP1A1 knock down by siRNA results in the dual inactivation ERK and AKT
  (1). Inactivation of ERK could presumably remove the suppressive pressure that this
  exerts on LKB1 (2), thereby allowing activation of AMPK (3). LKB1-independent mechanisms
  may also be possible. Additionally, inhibition of AKT could result in the release
  of its suppressive effect on AMPK (4). Alternatively, inhibition of AKT by CYP1A1siRNA
  could result in the release of the TSC1/2 complex from suppression (5), followed
  by release of RHEB (6), and subsequent inhibition of mTOR signaling (7). Alternatively,
  AMPK could directly activate TSC2 (5) and inhibit RAPTOR (7), thereby inhibiting
  mTOR signaling(8). In this manner CYP1A1siRNA treatment results in cell cycle arrest
  and increased apoptosis (9). In summary, we propose that CYP1A1siRNA-mediated inhibition
  of ERK1/2 and/or AKT results in AMPK activation, thereby inhibiting the mTOR/P70S6K
  pathway and thus resulting in cellular death. Legend: AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; ERK1/2, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2; KSR, Kinase Suppressor
