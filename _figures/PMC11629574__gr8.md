caption: Schematic diagram showing the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) as a critical
  molecular pattern for diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The initiation of DKD within
  tubule cells triggers the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to
  the degradation of the downstream core mediator YAP1. This cascade results in the
  disruption of YAP1-mediated mitochondrial quality control, characterized by impaired
  mitobiogenesis and mitophagy. Consequently, there is an elevation in the production
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), a decline in mitochondrial membrane
  potential (MMP, ΔΨm), mtDNA copy numbers, oxygen consumption rate, and the enzymatic
  activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. These molecular alterations
  stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL6) and chemokines (CXCL1,
  CXCL6, and CCL19) by tubule cells, instigating the recruitment and activation of
  macrophages. This intricate process significantly contributes to the pathogenesis
  of DKD. MST1, serine/threonine kinase 4; MST2, serine/threonine kinase 3; MOB1,
