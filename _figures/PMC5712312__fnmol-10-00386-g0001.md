caption: Synthesis of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and its complex glycoshingolipid metabolites.
  In the de novo pathway, the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the synthesis
  step to form ceramide, which is the lipid backbone of GlcCer. Serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  are condensated to 3-ketosphinganine (3-KS). Subsequent reduction of 3-KS to sphinganine
  and acetylation by ceramide synthases (CerS) forms dihydroceramide. Desaturation
  catalyzed by ceramide desaturase (DES) yields ceramide, which can be glycosylated
  to GlcCer. After addition of galactose (Gal), GlcCer gives rise to more complex
  glycosphingolipids of the ganglio, globo, isoglobo, lacto, and neolacto series.
  To generate glycosphingolipids of the ganglio series, zero, one, two, or three N-acetylneuraminic
  acid residues (NeuAc) are attached (o-, a-, b-, or c-series). Galactosylation of
  lactosylceramide (LacCer; Gal-GlcCer) is necessary to build lipids of the globo
  series. For both ganglio and globo series, consecutive addition of N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNAc), Gal, and NeuAc by specific glucosyltransferases results in glycosphingolipids
  of different structural complexity and function. Glycosphingolipid homeostasis is
  highly dependent on GlcCer synthesis and its hydrolysis to ceramide and glucose,
  which is catalyzed by the lysosomal and non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase, GBA1 and
  GBA2, respectively.
