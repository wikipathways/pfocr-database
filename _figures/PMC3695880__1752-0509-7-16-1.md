caption: 'The wiring diagram of the UPR model. The complete UPR model comprises 27
  species interconnected with 62 biochemical reaction channels in four compartments,
  ER, nucleus, Golgi body, and cytoplasm. The model utilises a total of 82 parameters.
  For sake of simplicity, some of the details and the apoptotic BAX/BAK/BH3 pathway
  have been omitted from the figure. Please refer to Additional file : Text 1 for
  the complete set of equations and parameters.'
