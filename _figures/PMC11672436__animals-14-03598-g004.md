caption: Co-expression networks in Vibrio ordalii Vo-LM-18 and its OMVs. Each node
  represents a metabolic pathway, and the edges between nodes indicate subordinate
  relationships between different pathways. Proteins involved in each pathway are
  highlighted as either over-expressed (red) or under-expressed (blue)
