caption: 'A schematic diagram showing the Sily-dependent protective and therapeutic
  strategies for DA-induced neuroinflammation. Following DA exposure, Sily may protect
  neurons against the DA-associated oxidative and inflammatory processes, as follows:
  (i) reducing ROS formation, (ii) boosting IL-10 secretion that initiates the M2
  neuroprotective state either directly or indirectly by increasing CRF release, which
  then liberates Dyn and, as a consequence, promotes GDNF synthesis, (iii) blocking
  IFN-γ-mediated M1 neurotoxic state production and, as a result, inflammatory mediators
  release (TNF–α, IL-1β, and NO), as well as AChE activity, (v) depressing EGFR phosphorylation
  and, thereby, GFAP expression, and (vi) prohibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
  JNK, and p38 MAPK. AChE Acetylcholinesterase, CRF Corticotropin releasing factor,
  Dyn Dynorphin, EGFR Epidermal growth factor receptor, GDNF Glial cell line-derived
  neurotrophic factor, GFAP Glial fibrillary acidic protein, IFN-γ Interferon-γ, IL-1β
  Interleukin-1 beta, IL-10 Interleukin-10, MAPKs Mitogen-activated protein kinases,
  NO Nitric oxide, ROS Reactive oxygen species, TNFα Tumor necrosis factor alpha'
