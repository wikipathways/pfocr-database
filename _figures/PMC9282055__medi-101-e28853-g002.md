caption: 'The pathway involving carnitine shuttle and subsequent fatty acid β-oxidation.
  Carnitine is transported to the cytoplasm via the organic carnitine transporter
  novel type 2 (OCTN2) in the plasma membrane. Long chain fatty acid (LCFA) is transported
  to the cytoplasm via the fatty acid transport protein (FATP). LCFA is converted
  to long chain fatty acyl CoA by long chain fatty acyl CoA (LCFA-CoA) synthase. Long
  chain fatty acylcarnitine is produced from long chain fatty acyl CoA and carnitine
  by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) in the inner side of the outer mitochondria
  membrane. Long chain fatty acylcarnitine is transported from the cytoplasm to the
  intermembrane mitochondrial space, followed by the transport of long chain fatty
  acylcarnitine to the mitochondria matrix by carnitine acylcarnitine translocase
  (CACT). It gets split into long chain acyl CoA and carnitine by carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  II (CPT-II) in the mitochondria matrix. Carnitine is returned to the cytoplasm from
  the mitochondria matrix by CACT. Long chain acyl CoA undergoes fatty acid β-oxidation
  mediated by 4 enzymes, including acyl CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl CoA hydratase, hydroxyacyl
  CoA dehydrogenase, and keto acyl CoA thiolase. The first step of fatty acid β-oxidation
  is mediated by very long, medium, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase, which
  involves electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF) and electron transferring flavoprotein
  dehydrogenase (ETFD). Acetyl CoA is one of the final products of fatty acid β-oxidation,
  which produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH)/flavine adenine
  dinucleotide (FADH2) via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, thus leading to adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) production. In addition, acetyl CoA stimulates ketone and glucose
  production (via the activation of pyruvate carboxylase) in liver during fasting,
  thereby suggesting glucose sparing and glucose production, respectively. Ketone
  is produced by acetyl CoA during fasting in the liver and is used as alternative
  energy source in the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain during fasting, thus suggesting
  glucose sparing. However, the inhibition of acetyl CoA production caused by compromised
  fatty acid β-oxidation, which occurs because of carnitine deficiency (primary, secondary:
  because of an inborn error of metabolism or valproic acid) or the defect of carnitine
  transport (CPT-I or CPT-II deficiency) or fatty acid β-oxidation pathway (because
  of various acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or a deficiency of ETF and ETFD), leads
  to cardiac arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy (heart), hypotonia and rhabdomyolysis (muscle),
  steatosis (liver), hypoglycemia, and the loss of consciousness (brain).[,,,]'
