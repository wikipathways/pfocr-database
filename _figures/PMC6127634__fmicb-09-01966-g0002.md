caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of DEGs involved in “Biotic stress” category
  as visualized by MapMan. (A) [P+T vs. P]: plant treated with Trichoderma compared
  to Control plants (water); (B) [P+T+R vs. P+R]: infected plants treated with Trichoderma
  compared to infected plants (R. solani); (C) [P+HA+R vs. P+R]: infected plants treated
  with HA compared to infected plants (R. solani). Each gene is symbolized by a box,
  the gene expression level is color-encoded (red = up-, blue = down-regulation).
  Genes with experimental indication of involvement in the biotic stress are grouped
  in the main central panel (colored in dark gray), while genes and pathways that
  are putatively involved in biotic stress pathway are shown on the left and right
  sides (colored in light gray).'
