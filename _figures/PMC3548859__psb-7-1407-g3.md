caption: Figure 3. Working model of role of RACK1A in D-allose regulated GA induced
  seed germination and early seedling development signal transduction pathway. D-allose
  may negatively regulate GA-mediated seed germination and early seedling development
  through the inhibition of RACK1A expression. Molecular genetics studies indicate
  that RACK1A regulates gibberellin induced seed germination and early seedling development
  and that this process is inhibited by rare sugar D-allose. In the absence of epistasis
  data, the precise position of RACK1A in the GA3signaling pathway cannot be ascertained.
  Based on the current data, a presumed position of RACK1A is indicated that is promoting
  GA3 induced seed germination and seedling development. For the lack of concrete
  data, role of other isoforms of RACK1 genes are omitted from the model.
