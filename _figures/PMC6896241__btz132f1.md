caption: Representation of causal interaction data in a standardized format. (A) The
  Hedgehog (HH) pathway as reported in the literature (; Yang ). In the absence of
  the HH ligands (e.g. Sonic Hedgehog, SHH), PTCH inhibits SMO signalling, while GLI2,
  the transcription factor responsible for HH signalling response, is maintained in
  a repressed state by GSK3B. GSK3B phosphorylates GLI2 and thus promotes its proteasomal
  degradation. In the presence of SHH ligand, PTCH is unable to inhibit SMO. Activated
  SMO positively regulates KIF7 which stabilizes GLI2. Activated GLI2 enhances transcription
  of the HH target genes (e.g. MYC, PTCH, NANOG), resulting in cell proliferation.
  (B) Data from the literature are independently curated in Causality-related resources.
  (C) The adoption of CausalTAB (PSI-MITAB 2.8), as a common exchange format allows
  users for the integration of causality data
