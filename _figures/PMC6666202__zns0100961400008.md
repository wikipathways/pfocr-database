caption: Modulations in AMPK activity, glucose transport, and Δψm in response to the
  energetic stress created by transient glutamate excitation. NMDA receptor activation
  induces a rapid influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions. The removal of these ions by membrane
  ATPases rapidly decrease cellular ATP levels altering the AMP:ATP ratio significantly.
  This alteration in the AMP:ATP ratio and to a minor degree CAMKK activation lead
  to a rapid activation of AMPK. The activation of AMPK signaling pathway facilitates
  the translocation of GLUT3 to the plasma membrane, increasing glucose uptake and
  its metabolism resulting in an increase in Δψm and ATP production. The ability of
  neurons to recover an energetic equilibrium (ATP levels) appears to determine whether
  they will tolerate the excitotoxic event.
