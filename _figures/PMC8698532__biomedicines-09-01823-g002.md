caption: The mechanism of NLRP3 pathway activation and its regulation by ncRNAs. (A)
  The priming of NLRP3 occurs when TLR4 senses some PAMPs and activates the NF-kB
  pathway, which helps in the expression and release of pro-IL-1β. Both PAMP and DAMP
  molecules result in the inflammasome activation and release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Non-coding RNAs can regulate the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome at
  various stages. miR-16 blocks NLRP3 activation by specifically targeting TLR4 receptors.
  MiR-495 and miR-223 specifically target the NLRP3. MiR-214 binds caspase 1. The
  lncRNA EPS inhibits the expression of ASC protein. ncRNAs also positively regulate
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. MiR-21 regulates NLRP3 expression via ERK/SPRY/SMAD
  pathways, and results in mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation, which trigger
  inflammasome activation. This process induces liver fibrosis. The lncRNA NEAT1 helps
  in the assembly of NLRP3 and downstream factors, such as caspase 1 and IL-1β. KCNQ1OT1
  binds miR-214, thus preventing its binding with caspase 1. The lncRNA COX-2 and
  GM4419 enhance NLRP3 expression by interacting with NF-kB. The lncRNA ANRIL regulates
  NLRP3 by the upregulation of the BRCC3 gene. The lnc Gm15441 and lnc XIST suppress
  the expression of NLRP3. (B) miRNAs in patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-derived
