caption: An overview of cellular glucose metabolism. The coupled pathways of glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, and electron transport down the membrane respiratory chain summarize
  removal of 24 electrons from each glucose molecule and ~30 ATP molecules accumulated
  for each four electron reduction of O2. A second major flux of glucose carbons is
  via the pentose phosphate pathway, yielding 2 equivalents of NADPH used for fatty
  acid biosynthesis and to make D-ribose-5-P for nucleic acid biosynthesis. The diagram
  also notes that complete oxidation of the predominant C16 fatty acyl-CoA, palmityl-CoA
  to 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA that are run through the TCA cycle and respiratory
  chain yields ~108 ATPs, emphasizing that saturated fatty acyl chains are energy
  storage molecules.
