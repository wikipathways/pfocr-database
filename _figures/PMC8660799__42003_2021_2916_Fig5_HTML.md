caption: Without the substrate, FhuCDB cycles through inward-open (states 1, 5) and
  outward-open (state 2) upon ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and ADP release. With the
  substrate, FhuD in FhuCDB (state 2) is replaced by the substrate-loaded FhuD (state
  3). The substrate is then released to FhuB and transferred down the translocation
  pathway (state 4). After ATP hydrolysis, FhuB opens the cytosolic gate and releases
  the substrate into the cytosol (state 5).
