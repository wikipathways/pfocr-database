caption: Schematic presentation of our hypothesis. TCE exposure causes oxidative stress
  and oxidative modification of proteins which interact with TLR signaling and Nrf2-NF-κB
  pathways, and lead to elevated lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine generation and
  loss of immune tolerance, eventually resulting to autoimmunity in MRL+/+ mice. Improvement
  in oxidative stress, dysregulation of TLR signaling and impairment of Nrf2-NF-κB
  pathway following SFN supplementation attenuates increased activation of lymphocytes
  and release of cytokines, ultimately leading to alleviation of inflammation/autoimmunity
  mediated by TCE exposure.
