caption: Conversion of vitamin K (VK) 1 to VK2, production of dihydro-VK1, the VK
  cycle, and γ-glutamyl carboxylation. (A) VK1, but not dihydro-VK1, is enzymatically
  converted into VK2 (MK-4) via VK3 , , ; VK1 is converted to dihydro-VK1 by the partial
  hydrogenation process . (B) The active form of VK (VK hydroquinone) is synthesized
  by the reduction of VK quinone (VK1, VK2, and dihydro-VK1) . (C) Gla proteins are
  synthesized from Glu proteins by γ-glutamyl carboxylase via a VK hydroquinone-dependent
  synthesis pathway.
