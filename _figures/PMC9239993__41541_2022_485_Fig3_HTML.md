caption: a Innate Immune response to mRNA vaccines The delivery of the mRNA molecules
  into the cytosol is followed by the detection of the mRNA molecules by TLRs. Double-stranded
  RNA molecules co-delivered as impurities or produced from SAM or as secondary structures
  are additionally detected by RLRs (RIG-1, MDA-5). These drive cytokine and chemokine
  responses that recruit more innate cells to the injection site. Amplified interferon
  response can result in the activation of OAS/PKR whose signals impede translation,
  protein expression and antigen presentation. b Adaptive Immune response to mRNA
  vaccines. Following In vivo delivery of the mRNA vaccine, the mRNA molecules with
  the delivery vehicles are (1) uptaken by cells such as DCs at the site of injection
  by endocytosis with subsequent delivery into the endosomes. This is followed by
  (2) endosomal escape of the mRNA molecules into the cytosol and subsequent (3) translation
  in the cytosol to produce the encoded protein. The produced protein may be retained
  in the cytosol where it is subsequently channelled for (4,5,6) proteasomal-MHCI
  pathway which would eventually drive a CD8 T cell response. Some of the proteins
  may also become (7) membrane-bound and expressed on the surface or (8) secreted/shed.
  Some of the secreted or expressed proteins may be (9) recycled by endocytosis and
  subsequently channelled through the MHCII-restricted presentation to eventually
  drive CD4 T cell response. B-cell and T-cell responses occur by virtue of their
  interactions with the secreted or membrane-bound proteins and MHC-antigen complexes
  respectively. (10) These adaptive responses prevent infection and facilitate the
  elimination of the pathogen upon encounter through antibody production, cytokine
  release and cytotoxic activities.
