caption: The equilibrium model of deleterious and protective factors during AD disease
  progression. Among the biological processes and cellular pathways activated at the
  asymptomatic stage of AD, some may exert protective roles. However, with exacerbation
  of the harmful insults during disease progression, the protective effect is exhausted.
  The resulting imbalance leads to neuronal degeneration and the onset of clinical
  symptoms. The pathway information is extracted from current AD proteomic studies
