caption: ERK signaling pathway and silicosis. ERK signaling pathway is involved in
  diverse cellular events. Growth factor and cytokines bind to RTK on the cell membrane,
  causing the combination of growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb-2) and SOS
  to activate Ras. Active GTP-bound Ras triggers a cascade of Raf–MEK–ERK phosphorylation.
  ERK translocates into the nucleus to regulate the expression of genes. ERK signaling
  pathway participates in the formation and development of silicosis, including silica-elicited
  ROS activating the pathway and inducing the release of cytokines such as TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IL-8; differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and accumulation
  of ECM; EMT process; and cell autophagy and apoptosis.
