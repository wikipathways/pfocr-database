caption: (A) Recognition of LPS by TLR-4 activates JNK, p38 and ERK signalling pathways.
  Meanwhile, a ROS signalling pathway is set up. UCP2 is quickly down-regulated in
  response to LPS via the JNK and p38 pathways to increase mitochondrial ROS production.
  The mitochondrial part of this signal is regulated by UCP2, a physiological brake
  that has to be switched off in order to enhance mitochondrial ROS production. This
  mitochondrial ROS generation, as a feedback signal, stimulates the ERK and p38 pathways.
  In this way, mitochondria contribute to the macrophage inflammatory response. (B)
  Diagram showing the amplified signalling cascade responsible for the enhanced inflammatory
  state of Ucp2−/− macrophages.
