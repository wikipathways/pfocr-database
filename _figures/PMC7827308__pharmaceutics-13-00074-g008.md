caption: Simplified representation of intracellular pathways activated upon TLR activation
  and working mechanism of B18R. Activation of TLRs leads to interaction with adaptor
  molecules TRIF and MYD88. Initiation of successive pathways results in activated
  transcriptions factors (IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB) causing production of type 1 IFNs
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Type 1 IFNs in their turn can activate IFN receptors
  in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Activation of IFN receptors leads to the production
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) via the JAK-STAT pathway. ISG can lead to production
  of proteins included in the signaling pathways (not shown) or proteins inducing
  mRNA damage or diminished mRNA translation. ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; ds RNA,
  double-stranded RNA; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing
  adapter protein inducing IFN-β; MYD88, myeloid differentiation primary response
  protein 88; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; NF-kB, nuclear factor-κB; IFN, type
  1 interferon; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase 1- Signal transducer activator of transcription;
  ISG, IFN-stimulated genes; OAS, 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase; ADAR, RNA-specific
  adenosine deaminase; PKR, dsRNA dependent protein kinase.
