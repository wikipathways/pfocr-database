caption: The cGAS-STING pathway in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A high-fat diet
  (HFD) causes steatosis, which induces mitochondrial stress damage in hepatocytes
  and subsequent releases of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. Cytosolic
  mtDNA is recognized as an endogenous DAMP, which activates the cGAS-STING pathway
  and induces the IRF3 signaling to promote transcription of type I IFNs. Activation
  of the cGAS-STING pathway also induces the NF-κB signaling to produce proinflammatory
  cytokines, which triggers hepatic inflammatory responses. Moreover, proinflammatory
  cytokines activate macrophage function and produce TGF-β1, which activates hepatic
  stellate cells (HSCs) and promotes liver fibrosis in NASH.
