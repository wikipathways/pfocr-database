caption: 'Sources of intracellular ANG II in cardiomyocytes. A, internalization: ANG
  II-AT1 receptor complex undergoes internalization in the process of cellular signaling.
  The complex dissociates intracellularly, resulting in the degradation or release
  of ANG II in the cytoplasm. B, high-glucose stimulation: intracellular synthesis
  following stimulation with high glucose. The precise intracellular site of ANG II
  synthesis is not known; however, it appears to occur outside of the secretory pathway.
  In cardiomyocytes, renin and chymase are involved in intracellular ANG II synthesis.
  C, isoproterenol stimulation: intracellular synthesis following stimulation with
  isoproterenol: In this case, ANG II synthesis likely occurs inside the secretory
  vesicles, due to cosorting of AGT, renin, and ACE. Part of the secretory vesicle
  ANG II content is released into the cytoplasm, while what remains is secreted outside
  of the cell. Cytoplasmic ANG II can freely diffuse into nucleus due to the small
  size. ANG II likely has multiple interaction sites in the cytoplasmic organelles
  and nucleus.'
