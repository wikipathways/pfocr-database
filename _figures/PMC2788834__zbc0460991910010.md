caption: A putative model for the mode of action of 5201F. In biosynthetic pathway
  of the γ-secretase (black arrows), folding and glycosylation states of NCT are monitored
  by CNX in the ER. After the assembly of the γ-secretase complex together with PS,
  APH-1, and PEN-2 (white circle), NCT ECD is glycosylated with complex oligosaccharides
  (black hexagon) in the Golgi. CST treatment yields the stable γ-secretase complex
  containing NCT with aberrant glycosylation (white hexagon), which reduces the proteolytic
  activity. 5201F binding to NCT ECD inhibits the functional folding and glucose trimming
  to form the unstable and inactive γ-secretase complex with NCT*. mNCT and imNCT
  represent mature and immature NCT, respectively.
