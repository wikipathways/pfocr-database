caption: Initiation and maintenance of plant stem cells in root and shoot apical meristems.
  A Initiation of root stem cells during embryogenesis. Gene regulation in the initiation
  of stem cells in embryonic root apical meristem at the late globular stage. Antagonism
  between auxin and cytokinin determines the establishment of root stem cell niche.
  Auxin antagonizes cytokinin output by direct transcriptional activation of ARR7
  and ARR15, feedback repressors of cytokinin signaling (CK signaling). Auxin regulates
  embryonic root stem cell initiation through the action of the MP transcription factor
  and auxin-labile inhibitor IAA12. And auxin cooperates with some transcription factors
  OBE1/2, TAA1/2, TMO5/7, and NTT to regulate the initiation of root stem cells. B
  Initiation of shoot stem cells during embryogenesis. Gene regulation in the initiation
  of stem cells in embryonic shoot apical meristem at globular embryo stage. WOX2
  is involved in the initiation of shoot stem cells through regulating PIN1-dependent
  auxin transport. WOX2 upregulates the HD-ZIP III transcription factors, which seem
  to mediate WOX2 function in the initiation of shoot stem cell through regulating
  cytokinin biosynthesis. Thus, WOX2 and its redundant WOX paralogs are required for
  the initiation of the shoot stem cell by establishing a regulatory framework that
  balances the cytokinin and auxin pathways. ZLL and TPL mediate the initiation of
  stem cells in the embryonic SAM which involves the negative regulation of auxin
  signaling. C Regulatory pathways control the maintenance of root stem cells. Gene
  regulation in the maintenance of stem cells in root apical meristem. The QC-specific
  transcriptional regulation of WOX5 is directly restricted by ROW1, and also regulated
  by CLE40-ACR4 regulatory module. WOX5 inhibits CYCD1;1, CYCD3;3, and CDF4 activity
  to control root stem cells. And auxin induces the expression of TPST and RGF genes,
  and TPST in turn sulfates the RGF peptides to induce the expression of PLT. Coordination
  among cytokinin and auxin maintains the size of root meristem and ensures root growth.
  The two hormones through a simple regulatory circuit converging on the SHY2 protein,
  which is activated by cytokinin and inhibited by auxin and a repressor of auxin
  signaling that negatively regulates the PIN. D Regulatory pathways control the maintenance
  of shoot stem cells. The central regulatory pathway for the maintenance of shoot
  stem cells includes an autoregulatory negative-feedback loop comprising stem cell-promoting
  transcription factor WUS and differentiation-promoting peptide CLV3. Cytokinin positively
  regulates the maintenance of shoot stem cell activity. A feedback module between
  WUS and cytokinin signaling pathway produces accurate positioning of stem cell niche.
  The spatial auxin–cytokinin cross talk for the shoot stem cell maintenance was determined
  by the negative regulation of the expression of IPT5 and ARR7/15 via the auxin signaling
  component ARFs, and in turn by the inhibition of YUCs expression via cytokinin-responsive
  factors
