caption: HSV-1-mediated evasion of the IFNAR-JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The antiviral
  activities of IFN-I are initiated by binding to their cognate receptor IFNAR1 and
  IFNAR2 to trigger a signaling cascade, namely, JAK-STAT pathways. Viral proteins
  from HSV-1 interact with adaptors to block the signal transduction, and some proteins
  target ISGs directly for evasion of host antiviral immunity. Dashed lines indicate
  uncertain interactions that need to be studied further, or the underlying mechanism
  is unknown. P, phosphate.
