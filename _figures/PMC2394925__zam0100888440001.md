caption: l-Tyr biosynthetic pathways. The common aromatic pathway begins with the
  reaction between PEP and E4P, which yields 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  (DAHP). CHA is the branch point of the pathway. PPA is formed from CHA in a reaction
  catalyzed by CM. l-AGN is produced from PPA by the action of an aminotransferase
  (AT). l-AGN is the substrate of TyrAa or TyrAc. HPP is formed from PPA by the activity
  of either TyrAp or TyrAc, and HPP is transaminated by the aminotransferase. In l-Tyr
  biosynthetic pathways, 1 mol of NAD+ or NADP+ is used. The dashed lines indicate
  two or more reactions.
