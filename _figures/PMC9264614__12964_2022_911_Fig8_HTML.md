caption: Proposed model of CDR-dependent aberrant AKT pathway in Hep3B cells. Growth
  factor stimulations abnormally induce CDRs via PI3Kβ in Hep3B. During the process,
  actin and polymerization proteins such as cortactin and N-WASP are involved. Rab5a
  is also activated as the downstream signaling molecule of PI3Kβ, although the function
  is unknown. The abnormal CDRs recruit receptor proteins, which trigger the PI3K
  pathway. PIP3 is generated at the structures and induces aberrant pAKT formation,
  leading to tumor development. Meanwhile, PIP3 can be generated outside CDRs mainly
  by PI3Kα as the normal pathway
