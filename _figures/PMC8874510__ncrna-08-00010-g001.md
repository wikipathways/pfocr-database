caption: Schematic representation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway, including all the
  relevant enzymes and cellular compartments involved. The eukaryotic genomes contain
  transcriptional units that will generate miRNAs. These information units, that appear
  isolated or clustered, can be located in several genomic territories, including
  intergenic regions, coding and non-coding genes. After transcription, the typical
  hairpin-loop secondary structure present in primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) is recognized
  and excised by the microprocessor complex (composed by DGCR8 and Drosha). The generated
  precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) will be exported to the cytoplasm and further processed
  by the Dicer nuclease to generate a dsRNA. The mature miRNA chain will be selected
  by Ago2 and engaged together into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to exert
  its regulatory action.
