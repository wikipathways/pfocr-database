caption: 'The C4H promoter analysis group.  shows a (simplified) version of the core
  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway leading to the synthesis of lignin monomers
  and anthocyanin pigments (not shown). Enzymes present in one PAG are written next
  to their reactions: PAL, 4CL, C4H, CCoAOMT (caffeoyl-CoA-0-methyltransferase).  shows
  the upstream region of C4H, known motifs are displayed in bold text with the motif
  name under the site. Asterisks denote detected sites by PhyloCon. Note that P- and
  L-boxes partially overlap, that both boxes display a high degeneracy (P-box consensus:
  YTYYMMCMAMCMMC; L-box consensus: YCYYACCWACC) and are thus particularly difficult
  to detect.'
