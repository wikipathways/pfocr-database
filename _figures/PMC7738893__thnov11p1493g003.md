caption: Molecular mechanisms for impaired antibody therapeutic activity in cancer.
  1) Tumor-derived exosomes and Nitric Oxide (NO) secretion from tumor; 2) membrane-bound
  TGFβ on Treg cells and secreted IL-10 contributes to impaired ADCC activity of NK
  cells, characterized by downregulation of NK cell activating receptor NKG2D and
  CD16 (FcγR) signaling and decreased IFNγ secretion; 3) Secretion of proangiogenic
  cytokines from macrophages in TME, downregulate the expression of VEGFR1, VEGFR3,
  on vascular endothelium and resulting in resistance to anti-VEGF antibody therapies;
  4) Overexpression of don't eat me a signal (CD47) on tumors and its interaction
  with myeloid-specific checkpoint molecule SIRPα on tumor cells, contribute to dysfunction
  of phagocytic activity of macrophages and neutrophils through signaling via inhibitory
  ITIM motif; 5) IL-10 and TGFβ produced from Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs)
  impair FcγR signaling and thus dampen the phagocytic activity of macrophages and
  neutrophils; 6) Neutrophil-mediated antibody opsonized tumor cells killing, which
  involves CD11b/CD18 dependent conjugate formation and trogocytosis, abolishes by
  CD47-SIRPα axis;7) The overexpression of membrane-bound complement regulator proteins
  (mCRPs) such as CD55, CD59, etc. on tumor cells interfere with the binding of immune
  complexes (Antigen bound antibody) to C1q component of classical complement pathway
  and abolish Complement- dependent Cytotoxic (CDC) activity of antibodies; 8) Dampening
  of antibody-induced tumor antigen-specific immune response results due to reduced
  IFNγ secretion from exhausted NK cells leading to insufficient DC maturation and
  decreased T cell activation. TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; IL-10, interleukin-10;
  IFNγ, interferon-gamma; SIRPα, signal regulatory protein α; ITIM, immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motif.
