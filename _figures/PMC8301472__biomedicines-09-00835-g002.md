caption: Mechanisms of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Malignant
  cells evade host’s antitumor response by the chemoattraction of immunosuppressive
  cells into the TME and the creation of a milieu which inhibits effector T cells
  (Teff). Regulatory T cells (Treg) release transforming growth factor β (TGF-β),
  interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-35 (IL-35) and prostanglandin E2 (PGE2), which
  inhibit Teff proliferation and cytokine release. In addition, Treg secrete granzyme
  B and adenosine [] and lead to apoptosis of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells []. Cytotoxic
  CD8+ T cells are also inhibited by the tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) as they
  produce arginase 1 (ARG1) [], IL-10, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and TGF-β
  []. Dendritic cells (DC) are crucial for T cell priming and their inhibition by
  TAM, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), melanoma cells and unfavorable conditions
  in the TME contribute to immunosuppression and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition.
  MDSC produce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TGF- β, ARG1 and IL-10, which
  inhibit effector T cells. On the other hand, MDSC inhibitory effect on DC is mediated
  by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [,]. MDSC
  are also crucial for neoangiogenesis and tumor invasiveness, because they secrete
  VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and basic fibroblast growth factors (bFBF)
  []. Under the influence of Treg, DC express co-inhibitory membrane protein B7H7
  and CD80 and CD86 are downregulated []. This impairs T cell activation. Chemoattraction
  of Treg is achieved by the expression of CCL22 and CCL28 on melanoma cell, ligands
  for CCR4 and CCR10 expressed on Treg []. The activation of an intrinsic Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway in melanoma cell has been linked to deprived T cell infiltration of TME
  [].
