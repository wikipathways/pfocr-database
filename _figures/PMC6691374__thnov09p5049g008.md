caption: Schematic drawing showing the role of MRP4 in regulation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in the endometrium. In endometrial epithelial cells, MRP4, through protein-protein
  interaction, stabilizes β-catenin (β-Cat) from degradation, which accumulates sufficient
  amount of β-catenin to translocate into the nucleus leading to the transcription
  of target genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Such a role of MRP4 in the endometrium
  is involved in both receptivity transition for embryo implantation and pathogenic
  transformation to develop endometriosis or endometrial cancer.
