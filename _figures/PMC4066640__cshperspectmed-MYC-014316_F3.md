caption: Model for the allele-specific cancer risk of rs6983267. The rs6983267 enhancer
  region forms a large chromatin loop (335 kb), which brings it into proximity with
  the MYC promoter. The cancer risk allele (G, right) is a higher-affinity binding
  site for the TCF-4/β-catenin transcription factor complex in the WNT signaling pathway,
  which is highly active in colon cancer cells owing to loss of the APC tumor suppressor.
  Higher-affinity TCF-4/β-catenin binding promotes higher levels of MYC mRNA to increase
  cancer risk.
