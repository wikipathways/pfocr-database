caption: Socs3-mediated inhibition of inflammation by Ezh2 deficiency. Macrophage
  Ezh2 deficiency reduces suppressive H3K27Me3 marks at the Socs3 transcriptional
  start site and distal enhancer, resulting in increased Socs3 expression. Cytosolic
  Socs3 inhibits proinflammatory gene expression by targeting the TLR-induced MyD88–TRAF6–NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Socs3 enhances TRAF6 ubiquitination, resulting in its proteasomal
  degradation, and thereby suppresses activation of NF-κB–dependent inflammatory genes.
