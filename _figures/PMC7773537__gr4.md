caption: 'The effect of hypoxia and the role of NPs in tumor immunity. The hypoxic
  state in TME contributes to the immunosuppression in TME in multiple ways. First,
  the elevated levels of anaerobic metabolites, such as adenosine and lactate, impair
  the functions of CTL by affecting the production of IFN-γ. Second, hypoxia promotes
  the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, such as MDSCs and Tregs, and also facilitates
  the conversion of macrophages from anti-tumorigenic phenotype TAM1 to pro-tumorigenic
  TAM2. Finally, hypoxia promotes the secretion of immunosuppressive factors, such
  as TGF-β and VEGF. TGF-β is a crucial factor in the transition of fibroblasts to
  CAF. VEGF promotes tumor angiogenesis. The excessive production of VEGF leads to
  the imbalance between the pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, which results
  in rapid but aberrant tumor vessel formation, further exacerbating the hypoxic state
  in TME. (1) NPs modified with MnO2 react with H2O2 in TME and produce sufficient
  oxygen. (2) Another strategy is that NPs loaded with oxygen directly release oxygen
  in TME. PFC with extremely high oxygen solubility has the ability to load large
  amounts of oxygen. NPs encapsulating PFC exhibit high oxygen binding capacity and
  release oxygen in situ. (3) In addition, NPs with Ce4+ or RLX can inhibit the formation
  of CAF. Ce4+ prevents the TGF-β1-initiated and ROS-triggered formation of myofibroblasts
  which produce pro-invasive molecules promoting tumor invasion. RLX inhibits the
  differentiation of pancreatic stellate cells, the precursors of CAFs, by inhibiting
  pSmad2 signaling pathway. (4) NPs also can deliver cytotoxic drugs (such as chemotherapeutic
  drugs or navitoclax) to directly attack CAFs. Navitoclax, an inhibitor of Bcl-2,
  induces apoptosis of CAFs. (5) NPs regulate abnormal tumor vasculature by delivering
  VEGF inhibitor or VDA. The VEGF inhibitor can suppress the binding of VEGF to their
  receptors on endothelial cells and block the VEGF signaling pathway, inhibiting
  tumor angiogenesis. VDAs disrupt existing tumor blood vessels by the induction of
  endothelial cells apoptosis mediated by TNFα.; Abbreviations: Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma
