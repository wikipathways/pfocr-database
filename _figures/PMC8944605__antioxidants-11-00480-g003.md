caption: Summary of major pathways initiating senescence through ROS/RNS deregulation.
  (A) Failure of the antioxidant transcription program arising from NRF2 defects can
  induce senescence. In fact, NRF2 promotes the induction of numerous cytoprotective
  genes harboring ARE/s cis-element/s in their promoters. NRF2 also engages protective
  mechanisms to ferroptosis, thus preventing iron accumulation. Under redox imbalance,
  numerous molecular effectors/factors can mediate senescence-associated growth arrest.
  This relies on the activation of the p53/p21CIP1 and p16INK4a/Rb pathways. Persistent
  DDR activates the p53/p21CIP1pathway, while epigenetic changes due to downregulation
  of BMI-1 and EZH2 proteins of the PCRs complex, induces p16INK4a/Rb pathway and
  establishes the SASP profile. SASP induction is mainly regulated by the redox-sensitive
  NF-κB pathway, along with C/EBPβ, GATA4, and JNK transcription factors. Dysfunctional
  mitochondria can also promote SASP (not shown). Mitochondrial dysfunctions increase
  ROS/RNS levels that also contribute to telomere damage and epigenetic modifications,
  and thus sustain senescence. Reduced levels of NAD+, a mitochondrial metabolite,
  affects the activities of sirtuins (SIRT1–7), thus provoking senescence by the p53/p21
  pathway. Alteration of the NAD+/sirtuin pathway also impacts negatively on FOXO
  and PGC-1α activities, with consequent ROS elevation and mitochondrial dysfunctions.
  FOXO transcription factors increase catalase and SOD2 expression. FOXO1/3 are primarily
  inhibited by AKT and activation of AKT gives rise to senescence through increased
  intracellular ROS levels. FOXO4 activated by JNK induces senescence by engaging
  the p21 pathway. Low NAD+ amounts sustained by dysfunction of PARP1 and NAMPT enzymes
  also induce senescence. (B) Overview of non-coding RNAs deregulated in senescence
  that can modulate ROS/RNS signaling pathways. Up and down arrows indicate ncRNA
  levels that have been found as increased or decreased, respectively in various models
  of oxidative stress-induced senescence.
