caption: 'The known substrate DCM is proposed to be transformed via the Wood-Ljungdahl
  pathway (left). The genome also suggests that DCMF may be able to utilize one or
  more of: tri-, di- and monomethylamine, glycine betaine, dimethylglycine, and sarcosine
  (right). Both sides of the model are predicted to produce acetyl compounds that
  can be transformed into pyruvate, linking them with the central carbon metabolism
  of the cell. Enzymes are written in italics. Gene loci for each enzyme are listed
  in . Abbreviations: ACS, acetyl CoA synthase; BCCT, betaine/choline/carnitine transporter;
  DCM, dichloromethane; DMA, dimethylamine; DMG, dimethylglycine; (CH3)CFSP, (methyl)
  Co(I) corrinoid iron-sulfur protein; CH ≡THF, 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate; CH2 =
  THF, 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate; CH3-THF, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate; CHO-THF,
  formyl-tetrahydrofolate; CODH, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; Fd, ferredoxin; FolD,
