caption: 'Regulation of autophagy by the MTORC1 signaling pathway in cancer cells.
  Glutamine is taken up by cells through the transporter SLC1A5. In addition, the
  antiporter SLC7A5 effluxes glutamine to introduce leucine inside of the cells. Leucine
  activates GLUD1 (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) allosterically, to promote the production
  of αKG and the activation of MTORC1 in a EGLN-dependent manner. MTORC1 integrates
  several inputs, most of them converging in the activation/repression of the TSC1-TSC2
  complex, which inhibits RHEB and thus MTORC1. Glutaminolysis activates RRAG proteins,
  which promote the translocation of MTORC1 to the surface of the lysosome where MTORC1
  interacts with its coactivator RHEB. Active MTORC1 induces the phosphorylation of
  both ULK1 and TEFB to inhibit autophagy. In addition, glutamate, a precursor of
  GSH (glutathione), along with αKG counteracts ROS levels to inhibit the activation
  of autophagy mediated by ATM, AMPK, and TSC upstream of MTORC1. Autophagy plays
  a dual role in cancer: while in early stages autophagy suppresses tumor progression
  by the removal of damaged cellular components, autophagy promotes the growth and
  survival of established tumors by providing nutrients and energy at later stages.
  Green arrows indicate processes that result in autophagy activation; red arrows
  indicate processes that result in autophagy inhibition.'
