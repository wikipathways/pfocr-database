caption: Chk1 suppressed death pathways. Chk1 responds to DNA replication stress in
  an ATR-dependent manner to trigger S-phase checkpoints, suppress inappropriate firing
  of late or cryptic DNA replication origins, and maintain replication fork integrity.
  When this ATR-Chk1 signalling pathway is suppressed cells show an enhanced level
  of apoptosis that appears to be the result of loss of control of replication origin
  firing []. This death pathway is characterized by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP) and caspase-3 activation but is independent of p53 status []. The induction
  of apoptosis in p53 proficient cells is strongly ATM/p53-dependent. This death pathway
  characterized by the p53-dependent induction of the proapoptotic proteins PUMA and
  BAX, MOMP, and caspase-3 activation. p53 deficient cells have a much reduced death
  response following exposure to IR due to the protective effects of ATM- or ATR-mediated
  signalling pathways. However in the absence of Chk1, such cells show a caspase-2-dependent
  apoptotic response that that bypasses Bcl-2, MOMP, and caspase-3 []. How caspase-2
  triggers apoptosis is unclear as previous work suggests caspase-2 induces death
  through BID cleavage and MOMP []. In the p53-/-Chk1 depleted cells this death pathway
  is not activated (X) by IR.
