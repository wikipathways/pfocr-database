caption: 'Overview of molecular targets of lithium in D. melanogaster. In the fly,
  lithium (atomic number: 3, relative atomic weight: 6.94) is thought to inhibit two
  major targets: (i) Shaggy/GSK-3, which is also a target of the insulin signaling
  and the Wnt pathway, and (ii) IMP/IPP. In disease models of D. melanogaster, inactivation/phosphorylation
  of Shaggy/GSK-3 increases intracellular levels of the transcriptional factor Amardillo/β-Catenin,
  which is associated with decreasing levels of beta-amyloid and tau pathology as
  well as improvement of neuronal health. Li-induced inactivation of Shaggy can also
  increase levels of the transcription factor CncC/Nrf2, which is likely to be the
  cause of the observed longevity and xenobiotic stress resistance. Effects of Li
  on the circadian rhythm are not yet explained but are also associated with Shaggy-inhibition.
  Independently of Shaggy/GSK-3, Li increases neuronal signaling, as it promotes synaptic
  neurotransmitter vesicle release through inhibition of IMP/IPP. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; dAkt, protein kinase B; Wnt/Wg, wingless; Shaggy/GSK-3, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; IMP/IPP, Inositol monophosphatase/Inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase;
  CncC/Nrf, cap-n-collar C/Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2.'
