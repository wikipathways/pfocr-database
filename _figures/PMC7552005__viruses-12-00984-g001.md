caption: 'PKR at the crossroads of virus sensing, innate immune signaling, and stress
  response pathways. Cells evolved several cytosolic sentinels that detect virus infection
  and initiate defense mechanisms, including innate immune and stress responses. Cytosolic
  nucleic acid sensors RIG-I, MDA5, and cGAS signal via the mitochondrial adapter
  protein MAVS and the ER-adapter protein STING, triggering downstream signaling cascades
  via the IKK complex (IKKγ, IKKα, IKKβ) and IKKε/IKKγ/TBK1. The IKK complex phosphorylates
  the NF-κB (p50, p65) inhibitor IκB, whose degradation enables the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB and transcriptional activation of IFN-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  TBK1, on the other hand, phosphorylates IRF3/7, whose nuclear translocation mediates
  the transcriptional activation of IFN-α/β (left side). Cytosolic dsRNA that accumulates
  during viral replication is sensed by the stress kinase PKR. As a consequence, phosphorylation
  of eIF2α strongly represses the translation of most cellular mRNAs, while the translation
  of factors related to the stress response (ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34) or cell survival
  (XIAP and Bcl-2) is selectively favored (right side). The other eIF2α-kinases, GCN2,
  PERK, and HRI, contribute to translation suppression by detecting virus-induced
  changes in cellular homeostasis such as nutrient deprivation and accumulation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) or unfolded proteins in the ER. In the cytosol, untranslated
  mRNAs condense together with numerous RBPs and form SGs (1). Upon infection with
  certain viruses, innate immune sensors, PKR, regulators of stress and immune sensors,
  and interferon (IFN)-induced effectors localize in stress granules (SGs) together
  with viral RNA or DNA, forming a signaling platform (2) that coordinates and potentiates
  the antiviral response (3,4,5). PKR is at the crossroads of stress and innate immune
  signaling pathways: PKR interacts with RIG-I, promotes its activation, and amplifies
  the downstream signaling cascade (6). A similar interaction exists with cGAS (7).
  PKR promotes MDA5 filament formation, is activated by MDA5 to enhance downstream
  MAVS signaling (8), and, in turn, can also be activated by MAVS (9). PKR affects
  pro-inflammatory responses by interacting with TRAFs to activate the NF-κB signaling
  and potentially the JNK/p38 MAPK pathway leading to AP-1 activation (10), or directly
  regulates NF-κB activity via phosphorylation of IκB and IKK (11). Finally, PKR is
  involved in controlling the stability and translation of IFN mRNAs (12). Black arrows
  indicate signaling pathways; dashed red arrows indicate crossroads between stress
  response pathways, innate immune signaling, and SGs.'
