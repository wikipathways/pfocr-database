caption: Rational combinations of PARPi with other targeted agents. Hypothesis-driven
  combinations with PARP inhibitors are summarized; (A) combinations of PARPi with
  other compounds targeting alternatives DDR nodes aim to maximize accumulation DNA
  damage during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, together with preventing its repair
  during G2 by minimizing the time to repair. This would lead to accumulation of DNA
  damage during mitosis and cell death. (B) Combinations with drugs targeting other
  biological pathways which have been shown to be modulated and/or to modulate HRR
  function, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, RAS, VEGFR, and AR signalling pathways.
  (C) Rationale for developing PARPi-immunotherapy combinations; defects in DDR might
  increase genomic instability, leading to accumulation of mutations and, putatively,
  increased neoantigen production and T-cell activation. An alternative hypothesis
  supporting PARPi-immunotherapy combinations is the accumulation of cytosolic DNA
  induced by DDR defects, which would activate the innate immune system through the
  cGAS-STING pathway, inducing interferon-mediated response. This pro-inflammatory
  cascade would result in activation of NK cells and macrophages and the infiltration,
  proliferation and antitumour response of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the tumour.
  Paradoxically, the STING pathway also activates the expression of PD-L1 in tumour
  cells, therefore limiting the cytotoxic immune response, but potentially rendering
  the tumour sensitive to PD-L1 blockade (DC, dendritic cell; M∅, macrophage; NK,
  natural killer cell; Treg, regulatory T cell).
