caption: 'Store-dependent and -independent Ca2+ entry pathways in smooth muscle. A:
  activation of plasma membrane phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors initiates
  production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), promoting Ca2+ release and endoplasmic
  reticulum store depletion. Store depletion causes stromal-interacting molecule 1
  (STIM1) translocation and binding to Orai1 Ca2+ channel to activate Ca2+ entry.
  Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel isoforms are also concomitantly
  activated in response to receptor stimulation in smooth muscle. Ca2+ entry activates
  the phosphatase calcinerin, with subsequent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation
  of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), leading to transcription of genes
  involved in migration and proliferation. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) was proposed
  to promote ERK and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation,
  enhancing CREB smooth muscle cell proliferation. Receptor activation of the Akt/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR)/P70S6 kinase (P70S6K)/eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E (eIF4E) pathway promotes enhanced expression of STIM1 and Orai1 and enhanced
  SOCE. CaM, calmodulin; IP3R, IP3 receptor; G, G protein. B: receptor activation
  can lead to arachidonic acid (AA) generation through several routes, including metabolism
  of diacylglycerol (DAG) generated through PLC by DAG lipase. AA is further metabolized
  into downstream metabolites, including leukotrienes. Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and AA
  activate Ca2+-selective channels composed of Orai1, Orai3, and STIM1, and this activation
  is independent of store depletion. Inhibition of these store-independent Orai1/Orai3
  channels caused enhanced Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation and inhibited vascular smooth
  muscle cell migration. LTC4S, LTC4 synthase; 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase.'
