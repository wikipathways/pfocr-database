caption: 'An illustration of the involvement of FKBPs in complex disorders. Generally,
  increased FKBP51 enzymatic activity/protein levels and/or FKBP5 mRNA levels are
  related to negative effects, namely, increased disease severity (and vice versa).
  Positive effects: (A) Neuropsychiatric diseases—in HD, when FKBP51 protein levels
  or activity were decreased using genetic or pharmacological approaches, reduced
  mHTT levels were observed in the isogenic human HD stem cell model [24]. In AD,
  downregulation of FKBP51 activity (using siRNA) profoundly decreases Tau expression
  [49]. (B) Cancer—FKBP51 may function as a tumor suppressor in the AKt signaling
  pathway, through a scaffolding protein that enhances the PH domain and leucine-rich
  repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP)–AKt interaction [76,78]. (C) TD2M—compounds that
  bind/inhibit FKBP51, such as FK506 and the specific inhibitor SAFit, may directly
  diminish adipogenesis and lipid storage, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce
  body mass [80,85]. Negative effects: (D) Neuropsychiatric diseases—in relation to
  AD, over-expression of the chaperone complex consisting of FKBP51 and HSP90 in mice
  inhibited proteasomal degradation of Tau and led to Tau accumulation [50]. FKBP52
  interacts with Tau through a specific proline-rich region. FKBP52 inhibited microtubule
  growth and led to oligomerization and aggregation of Tau [52]. In relation to PD,
  enzymatic activity of FKBP12 increases the formation of α-SYN fibrils at sub-nanomolar
  concentrations [59]. In relation to psychiatric disorders, low DNA methylation levels
  were reported in FKBP5’s intron 7 in patients with psychiatric disorders [61] and
  common allelic variants in this gene were reported to be associated with increased
  risk of developing affective disorders (anxiety, depression, and PTSD) [18]. (E)
  Cancer—FKBP5 functions as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the tissue
  type and the pathways expressed in those tumors. For example, activation of FKBP5
  transcription via the androgen receptor was reported in prostate cancer [67,68];
  an FKBP51–Hsp90–p23 super-chaperone complex stimulates androgen-dependent transcription
  activation and cell growth [70]; FKBP51 is essential for drug-induced NF-κB activation
  in human leukemia [73]; and FKBP51 was identified as a negative regulator of Akt
  [75,76]. (F) TD2M—FKBP5 DNA methylation correlated with adiposity, insulin resistance,
  and systemic inflammation; it also inversely correlated with FKBP5 mRNA levels,
  which were positively associated with adiposity, metabolic, and inflammatory parameters
  [82]; increased FKBP5 DNA methylation correlated with higher HbA1c levels [83].
