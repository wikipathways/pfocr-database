caption: Interaction of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 with their receptors and downstream
  signaling pathways. Receptors for IL-2 and IL-15 share two mutual submits, the common
  cytokine receptor γ-chain (γc) and the β-chain IL-2/15Rβ. Secreted IL-2 binds to
  its unique receptor submit IL-2Rα while membrane-associated IL-15 is trans-presented
  by monocytes or dendritic cells to NK cells or CD8+ T cells through binding with
  IL-15Rα, and then forms the high-affinity heterotrimeric receptor complex allowing
  the activation of downstream signaling. Both IL-2 and IL-15 mainly trigger the phosphorylation
  of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  pathway, which could be limited by CIS/SOCS as a negative feedback. The phosphorylated
  STAT dimers or tetramers then translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription
  of target genes. Other pathways including RAS/Raf/MAPK and phosphoinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT are also activated by the ligation of these cytokines, contributing to
  the complex physical impacts of IL-2 and IL-15 on various immune cells.
