caption: Nox1 is localized to cavaolae in the plasma membrane and endosomes. TNF-α
  stimulates TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1), resulting in the recruitment of TRADD, RIP1,
  Rac and Nox1 to the receptor. The complex produces ROS that activate JNK to initiate
  necrosis. Other activators of Nox1 include Ang II, thrombin, and PDGF. H2O2 produced
  by Nox1 activation initiates hypertrophy by activating p38 MAPK, which associates
  with MAPKAPK2 and Akt. Nox1 also activates SSH1L, which activates cofilin by dephosphorylation
  to promote cell migration. In a parallel pathway, Nox1-derived ROS increase cSrc
  phosphorylation, which activates PDK1, followed by PAK1. Nox1 also stimulates growth
  by activating Ras and ERK1/2, which activate the transcription factor Ets-1 by phosphorylation.
  Ets-1 upregulates Cyclin D, promoting passage through the cell cycle.
