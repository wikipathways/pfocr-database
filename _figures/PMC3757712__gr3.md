caption: Crosstalk between the Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways. Oxidative stress mediated
  Nrf2 activation can lead to the production of antioxidant enzymes and cytoprotective
  enzymes such as SOD, catalase, GSH, haem-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase
  (NQO1) and increased synthesis of GSH, NADPH and multidrug transporters. Nrf2 bind
  to the antioxidant response element (ARE) on DNA and maintains redox balance in
  body . Normally Nrf2 is bound to cytosolic repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1) and labelled for polyubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation.
  However, during oxidative insult, the sulfhydryl groups on Keap1 are oxidised, causing
  the alteration in confirmation of Keap1, and hence releases Nrf2, which then binds
  with ARE elements of the genome along with small Maf proteins . NF-κB is another
  redox regulated transcription factor, involved in inflammation, immune function,
  cellular growth and apoptosis . p65 is a Rel protein with transactivation efficiency
  whereas its partner p50 does not possess transcriptional activity. Oxidative stress
  can cause the activation of IκB kinase (IKK). Activation of IKK causes phosphorylation
  of inhibitor of NF-κB, IκB and hence targets the later for polyubiquitination mediated
  proteasomal degradation, results in release of NF-κB, which then migrates into the
  nucleus, binds with the κ region of genome. With the help of other coactivators
  and histone acetyl transferases (HAT), NF-κB causes the transcription of proinflammatory
  mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2), interleukin-1 (IL-1), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) . Further these two pathways are proposed to inhibit
  each other at their transcription level via protein–protein interactions or through
  secondary messenger effects. Nrf2 pathway inhibits the activation of NF-κB pathway
  by increasing antioxidant defences and HO-1 expression, which efficiently neutralizes
  ROS and detoxify toxic chemicals and hence, reduces ROS mediated NF-κB activation
  . Nrf2 pathway also inhibits NF-κB mediated transcription by preventing the degradation
  of IκB-α. Similarly, NF-κB mediated transcription reduces the Nrf2 activation by
  reducing the ARE gene transcription, decreases free CREB binding protein (CBP) by
  competing with Nrf2 for CH1-KIX domain of CBP . NF-κB also enhances the recruitment
  of histone deacetylase3 (HDAC3) to the ARE region by binding to Mafk and hence interferes
  with the transcriptional facilitation of Nrf2 .
