caption: 'Overview of methodology and results. From left to right in the figure: Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) was applied to human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) in vitro and
  fibrogenic markers were assessed and found to be elevated. To test whether Wnt signaling
  mediated these results, AVICs were treated with Wnt inhibitor (Dickkopf Wnt signaling
  pathway inhibitor 1 [Dkk1]) prior to treatment with LPS and fibrogenic markers did
  not increase as before. Because Wnt inhibition abrogated the expression of fibrogenic
  markers induced by LPS, we probed for a key Wnt ligand, Wnt3a, to determine the
  role that it played in mediated LPS-induced expression of fibrogenic markers and
  found that LPS upregulated the expression of this ligand in AVICs. To confirm Wnt3a
  was the mediator of LPS-induced expression of fibrogenic markers, AVICs were treated
  with recombinant human Wnt3a and results demonstrated elevated expression of fibrogenic
  markers in AVICs, similar to the effects of LPS. Finally, as a second confirmatory
  test to prove Wnt3a was the mediator of LPS-induced expression of fibrogenic markers,
  AVICs were treated with anti-Wnt3a neutralizing antibodies prior to stimulation
  with LPS and fibrogenic markers again did not increase as before. Overall, these
  findings suggested that AVICs upregulated Wnt3a expression after treatment with
  LPS and Wnt3a mediated the observed LPS-induced increase in expression of fibrogenic
  markers in AVICs.'
