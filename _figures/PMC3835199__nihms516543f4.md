  regulator, 〇 = Other,   = Complex/group,   = Peptidase. Gene network in the combined
  dorsal and lateral lobes of prostate of TRAMP mice treated for 4 weeks with 100
  mg/kg/d of OSU-CG5 was created using Ingenuity pathway analysis software. We focused
  on the network that was described as being involved in “Cellular Assembly and Organization,
  Cellular Function and Maintenance, Gene Expression.” Akt appears to have a central
  role in this pathway. Genes are represented as nodes, with upregulated genes colored
  red and downregulated genes colored green. The intensity of the color indicates
  the degree of up-or downregulation. Genes that are not colored were not in the analyzed
  data set. The biologic relationships between genes are indicated by lines; solid
  lines represent direct interactions whereas dashed lines represent indirect interactions.
  Arrowheads indicate the directionality of interaction, and lines without arrowheads
  indicate binding. Lines that begin and end at the same gene indicate autoregulation.
