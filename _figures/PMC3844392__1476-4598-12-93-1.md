  HIF-1α and von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL) is disrupted, leading to HIF-1α translocation
  into nucleus, dimerization with HIF-1β subunit and formation of HIF-1 active form,
  which can regulate transcription of target genes . HIF-1 activates lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH-A), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) and
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) to switch into more glycolytic phenotype []. To prevent
  apoptosis, it induces survivin expression [] and downregulates BAX, BID and caspases
  activity []. HIF-1 can also induce autophagy by upregulation of beclin-1, BNIP3
  and NIX []. Through modulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [], angiopioetin-2
  (Ang-2) [], carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) [] and p21WAF1[] expression, HIF-1 triggers
  activation of pro-survival pathways. Different molecular stresses (including DNA
  damage, hypoxia, oxidative stress), cause dissociation of p53 from murine double
  minute 2 (MDM2) complex, enabling its binding to regulatory elements of target genes
  []. Thereby p53 can repress glycolysis by altering expression of GLUT-1, PGM, TP53-induced
  glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and inhibits pentose phosphate pathway
  by downregulating glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) []. p53 regulates expression
  of many pro-apoptotic proteins, including PUMA, NOXA, CD95, Apaf1, BAX, BID and
  caspases []. Induction of autophagy by p53 relies on activation of damage-regulated
  autophagy modulator (DRAM) [], sestrin 1, sestrin 2 and AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK)
  [], but depending on cellular localization it can also inhibit this process [].
  Regulation the expression of transcription factor ATF3 enables adaptation to hypoxia,
  ER stress, oxidative stress and genotoxic stress [], whereas during hypoxia induction
