caption: Mechanisms of TMAO inducing cell Apoptosis. The mechanisms through which
  TMAO induces cell apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial
  pathways. TMAO induces ER stress, activating the PERK/ATF-4 and IRE-1α/XBP-1s signaling
  pathways, leading to apoptosis, inflammation, and vascular injury. Additionally,
  TMAO-induced apoptosis may result from reduced SERCA activity and disrupted calcium
  homeostasis. It also promotes mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production
  and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes, which upregulate IL-1β and further drive apoptosis.
  TMAO triggers apoptosis by activating the ASK-JNK and SIRT1 pathways. Conversely,
  TMAO may inhibit apoptosis by mitigating aggregation and ER stress caused by G98R
  αA-crystallin. Created in BioRender. Ge, P. (2025) https://BioRender.com/t03q624
