caption: (A) Many substrates and co-factors for chromatin-modifying enzymes are derived
  from metabolic pathways involving the TCA cycle, methionine cycle, folate cycle,
  glycolysis, β-oxidation, and the hexosamine pathway. These metabolites can serve
  as activators or inhibitors of epigenetic writers such as Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing
  proteins, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone acetyltransferases (HATs),
  Ten-eleven translocase DNA demethylases (TETs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs).
  (B) Metabolites can influence nutrient sensing signaling pathways. The kinase complex
  mTORC1 can only be activated by growth factor-induced signaling when the amino acids
  arginine and leucine, as well as the co-factor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), are
  sensed inside the cell. In addition, energy balance communicated through the cellular
  AMP/ADP to ATP ratio can be sensed by AMPK. (C) Transcription factors can be directly
  regulated by metabolites; for example, the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine is an
  endogenous agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and α-KG binds to and activates
  IKKβ and initiates NF-κβ signaling.
