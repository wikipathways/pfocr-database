caption: Disposition of 17β-estradiol (E2) and metabolites. SULT1A1 and UGT1A1 inactivate
  E2, and thus represent an antimitogenic pathway; the products of E2 oxidation, 2-hydroxyestradiol
  (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol, (4-OHE2), are both possible mutagens; 2-OHE2 is
  methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to the antiproliferative compound
  2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeE2), thus this pathway is potentially both antimutagenic
  and anitmitogenic. 2-OHE2 is alternatively sulfated and glucuronidated; this pathway
  would be predicted to be antimutagenic because it inactivates 2-OHE2 and, at the
  same time, promitogenic because it competes with the antimitogenic methylation pathway.
  4-OHE2 is also inactivated by SULT1A1 and UGT1A1. Thus, sulfation and glucuronidation,
  depending on the cellular context and the competing metabolic pathways in a specific
  cell, may represent protective (detoxifying) or detrimental pathways. CYPs, Cytochromes
  P450.
