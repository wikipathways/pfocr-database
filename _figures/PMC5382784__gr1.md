caption: Schematic illustration of extracellular oligopeptide metabolism in P. gingivalis.
  The metabolic pathway of P. gingivalis from the extracellular polypeptides, di-
  and tri-peptide incorporation, amino acid metabolism, and excretion as short-chain
  fatty acids, are schematically illustrated , . Amino acids, except for Ser and Thr,
  are mainly transported as di- and tri-peptides via oligopeptide transporters . Rgp
  and Kgp are mainly localized on the outer membrane (OM), while DPPs, PtpA, and AOP
  are located in periplasmic space , , . Scissors indicate peptidases, which cleave
  peptide bonds at specific positions. Stars represent acylaminoacyl groups at the
  N-terminus. IM, inner membrane.
