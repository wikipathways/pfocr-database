caption: In order for synaptic transmission to occur, neurotransmitters must first
  be synthesized, concentrated in synaptic vesicles, and released across the synaptic
  cleft. V-ATPase (Atp6v), a multi-subunit proton pump, is the primary mediator of
  ATP-dependent concentration of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles and is thus
  vital for healthy synaptic transmission. Our data indicate that human ApoE isoforms
  differentially modulate the expression of Atp6v1B2, a key component of the catalytic
  core of Atp6v, with ApoE2 brain exhibiting the highest expression and ApoE4 brain
  exhibiting the lowest. Moreover, several studies have indicated that the glycolytic
  pathway of glucose metabolism is a direct regulator of Atp6v function. Based on
  these findings, we hypothesize that ApoE2 upregulates Atp6v in the brain and that
  the increased glucose uptake and metabolism previously observed in ApoE2 brain provides
  a direct source of ATP and protons for Atp6v thus facilitating increased Atp6v activity.
  Moreover, we hypothesize that the increased activity of Atp6v results in significantly
  increased neurotransmitter concentration and thus enhanced synaptic function.
