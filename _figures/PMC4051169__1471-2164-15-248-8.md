caption: Mitotic roles of Polo-like kinase pathway. Most of the genes in the mitotic
  of Polo-like kinase pathway were down regulated (green color highlighted) by most
  of the compounds in the classes of metals and inflammatory mediators, but up regulated
  by most of the compounds in the classes of antimicrobial, cancer related drugs,
  pesticides, and PXR mediators.
