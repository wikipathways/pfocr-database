caption: Hypothetical mechanisms of the action of stress and exercise in the BDNF-
  and FKBP5-mediated GR phosphorylation signaling pathway. Aerobic exercise increases
  BDNF expression, which in turn promotes GR phosphorylation through the serine residues
  by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway []. Hence, exercise
  could boost MAPK signaling enhancing the level of the activated form of this transcription
  factor as previous studies have found after only a week of voluntary running [].
  In consequence, activation of a TrkB-MAPK pathway could trigger GR phosphorylation
  and the expression of genes involved in resilience-related neuroplasticity. (A higher
  resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of
  the article).
