caption: 'Model of mTOR signaling network in mammalian cells. It consists of two functionally
  different complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 pathway integrates inputs
  from at least three major cues, namely AAs, growth factors (such as IGF1 and insulin)
  and energy status, to regulate many major processes, including protein synthesis
  and autophagy. mTORC1 signaling is highly sensitive to AAs, which can be transported
  into cells through plasma membrane AATs, and then exert their regulatory roles.
  AA-dependent activation of mTORC1 requires small Rag GTPases. There are four Rag
  proteins that work in heterodimers. Rag A or B binds to Rag C or D. Upon growth
  factor stimulation, mTORC1 signaling is activated through the classical PI3K-PKB/Akt-TSC-Rheb
  pathway. Energy status is also sensed upstream of mTORC1. Low energy activates AMPK,
  which inhibits mTORC1 function by phosphorylating and activating TSC2 as well as
  phosphorylating Raptor. Arrows represent activation, whereas bars represent inhibition.
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC1: mTOR complex 1; IGF1: insulin-like
  growth factor 1; AAs: amino acids; AATs: AA transporters; PI3K: phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase; PKB/Akt: protein kinase B; TSC: tuberous sclerosis complex; Rheb: Ras
  homolog enriched in brain; Raptor: regulatory-associated protein of mTOR; AMPK:
  AMP-activated protein kinase.'
