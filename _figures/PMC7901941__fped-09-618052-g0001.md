caption: Characterizing oligodendrocytes throughout the lineage. Oligodendrocytes
  originate from pre-progenitor (OPP) neural cells and are committed to the oligodendrocyte
  pathway under the influence of NKx2.2, Olig1/2, and Sox10. Once committed to the
  pathway, stage specific markers of oligodendrocytes allow for characterization of
  the lineage. Progenitor (OPC) and pre-oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) feature stage-specific
  growth factor receptors (platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha; PDGFRα),
  surface antigens (neural/glial antigen 2; NG2) and cell adhesion molecules (polysialylated-neural
  cell adhesion molecule; PSA-NCAM), whilst premyelinating oligodendrocytes possess
  enzymes for lipid synthesis (galactocerebrosidase; GalC/O1). Finally, myelinating
  oligodendrocytes are characterized by the presence of myelin proteins such as myelin-associated
  glycoprotein (MAG), myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
  (MOG), and proteolipid protein (PLP). Oligodendrocytes at this final stage of the
  lineage are the only ones capable of producing myelin and must also have contact
  with neuronal axons to perform this role. Figure created with BioRender.com.
