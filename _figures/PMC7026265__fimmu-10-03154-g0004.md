caption: Pharmacological strategies to control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in
  diseases. The inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE1a) kinase domain can be directly
  inhibited by small molecule drugs, such as 4μ8c, MKC-3946, and B-I09. These compounds
  prevent splicing of the Xbp1 messenger RNA (mRNA). STF-08310, a compound selectively
  inhibiting ER stress-initiated endonuclease activity of IRE1, also prevents further
  downstream signaling. These compounds could have effect on T cells, B cells, dendritic
  cells (DCs), macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs), and natural killer
  (NK) cells. PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) inhibitors are developed to inhibit the enhancement
  of PERK, and its downstream factors and could be used in targeting T cells, B cells,
  DCs, and macrophages. In addition, a CHOP-specific inhibitor was developed to prevent
  the CHOP promotor activation. Melatonin has also been reported to selectively inhibit
  ATF6. PERK–CHOP pathway could also be blocked by canopy homolog 2 (CNPY2) inhibition.
