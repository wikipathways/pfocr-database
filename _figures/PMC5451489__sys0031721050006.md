caption: Biphasic metabolism of Protochlamydia during development in Acanthamoeba
  castellanii. This model is based on observed transcriptional patterns, enriched
  functional categories at different developmental stages (, , and  and Fig. S2A),
  and independent experimental evidence reported previously (see text for references).
  Activity of metabolic pathways as inferred from gene expression levels followed
  similar trends early and at midcycle, and at the two later stages, respectively.
  This suggests that ATP import and an amino acid-based anabolism prevails during
  the EB-to-RB transition and RB replication. Later stages are characterized by a
  glucose-based metabolism and a pronounced increase in the activity of the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative (ox.) phosphorylation pathway. Nucleotide transporters
  (Ntt’s) are shown in blue, and amino acid (AA) and oligopeptide transporters are
  shown in green. “Multi” indicates that multiple amino acid/peptide transporters
  with different substrate specificities are expressed. Question marks refer to hypothetical
  transporters not yet identified. Asterisks indicate an increased expression at the
  RB stage compared to the early time point. “RNA” denotes transcription, whereas
  “DNA” indicates DNA replication. Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; glyconeog., gluconeogenesis.
