caption: 'Potential crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and the RSV-mediated
  induction of Nrf2 activity. RSV supplementation activates the transcriptional activity
  of Nrf2, which can interface with the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle. This figure shows
  the various stages of the viral cycle that could be influenced by Nrf2 signaling.
  (a) Binding of the viral spike protein (S) to ACE2 results in virion entry. Nrf2
  suppresses the expression of the ACE2 gene []. (b) The viral nucleocapsid is uncoated
  in the cytoplasm of infected cells. (c) Next, the translation of viral +ssRNA and
  division of the products into different viral proteins occurs. Moreover, viral RNA
  within the host cell activates the cGAS DNA/RNA sensor, which transmits signals
  through the STING adapter [], and facilitates the expression of type I and III IFNs
  []. Nrf2 suppresses IFN production by reducing STING expression []. (d) With respect
  to the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, Nrf2 promotes HO-1 expression, generating
  Fe2+ that can bind to the divalent metal-binding pocket of the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2
  and inhibits its catalytic activity []. (e) To allow for the translation of viral
  structural proteins, double-stranded RNA-activated PKR phosphorylates eIF2 and inhibits
  the translation of viral proteins. PKR also phosphorylates p62 and activates Nrf2
  when its suppressor, KEAP1, is removed by autophagy []. Nrf2 is a PERK substrate
  that acts as a PERK-dependent cell-survival effector. Inhibition of viral proteins
  also activates the UPR. PERK is a vital Ser/Thr kinase protein that also plays a
  role in the UPR pathway. Nrf2 phosphorylation leads to the stabilization and improvement
  of its transcriptional activity []. (f) Virion assembly. Autophagy acts as a cell-monitoring
  mechanism for the control of invasive pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a inhibits autophagy
  activity by blocking the formation of autolysosomes, which may destroy the newly
  synthesized virion []. The newly formed viral particles are assembled across the
  endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. (g) Release of viral particles. Structural
  proteins play an important role in the budding of viral particles released by infected
  host cells []. Numerous studies have proposed that ACE2 receptors are key structural
  proteins for virus budding and entry into host cells []. ACE2: angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; eIF2: eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ER: Golgi
  intermediate compartment; HO-1: heme oxygenase 1; IFN: interferon; KEAP1: Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2;
