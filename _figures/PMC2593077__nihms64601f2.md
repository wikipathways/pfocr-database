caption: Following stimulation with single stranded (ss) RNA, TLR7/8 recruit MyD88,
  IRAKs and TRAF6 to activate 2 distinct pathways. When MyD88, IRAKs and TRAF6 recruit
  Ubc13/TAK, the TAK1 complex then activates the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ
  and IKKγ/NEMO, which catalyzes phosphorylation of IκB proteins and subsequent translocation
  of NFκB to the nucleus. TAK1 also activates the MAPK pathway, which mediates AP-1
  activation. NFκB and AP-1 control the expression of genes encoding inflammatory
  cytokines. When MyD88, IRAKs and TRAF6 recruit TRAF3, IRAK1 and IKKε into a complex,
  IRF7 is directly phosphorylated by IRAK1 IKKε , and then translocated to the nucleus
  to induce expression of IFNα and IFN-inducible genes. Upon interaction with double
  stranded (ds) RNA, TLR3 recruited TRIF and interacts with TBK1 and IKKε, or activates
  the PI3K/Akt complex, which both mediate phosphorylation of IRF3. The phosphorylated
  IRF3 dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus to induce expression of IFNβ and
  IFN-inducible genes, including IP-10. TRIF also interacts with TRAF6 and RIP1, which
  mediate NFκB activation. TLR3 and TLR7/8 are located in endosomes, all signaling
  events occur in the cytoplasm, while activated transcription factors IRF3, IRF7,
  NFκB and AP-1 act on the genes within the nucleus. The cellular compartments are
  not scaled.
