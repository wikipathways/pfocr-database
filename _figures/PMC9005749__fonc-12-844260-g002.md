caption: The comprehensive mechanisms of TIGIT/CD155 axis mediated in the immune system
  in various models and biological contexts. (A) After TIGIT expressed on NK cells
  binds to CD155, the intracellular immunoreceptor (ITT)-like motif of TIGIT is phosphorylated
  at Tyr255 and interacts with Grb2, which terminates MAPK and PI3K signaling via
  recruiting SHIIP1, leading to the inhibition of NK cell function. (B) TIGIT/CD155
  axis directly induces CD8+T cell exhaustion by recruiting SHIP1 and SHP2 phosphatase.
  (C) Tumor cells restrict NK and CD8+T cell activity using the Fap2 protein of F.nucleatum
  bacteria to interact with TIGIT. (D) The deletion of CD226 enhances TIGIT/CD155
  signaling, thereby maintaining the immunosuppressive function of Tregs with the
  inhibition of the AKT-mTORC1 pathway. (E) After TIGIT/CD155 ligation, the transcription
  factor CEBPα promotes the transcription of the soluble effector molecule fibrinogen-like
  protein 2 (Fgl2), thereby the hypersecretion of Fgl2 in Tregs facilitates the suppression
  of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells. (F) The binding of CD155 to TIGIT on dendritic
  cells (DC) induces the production of IL-10 and inhibits the production of IL-12,
  which directly leads to the DC maturation and indirectly reduces the proliferation
  and function of T cells. (G) TIGIT expressed on specific B cell subsets binds to
  CD155 expressed on DC, leading to the decreased expression of IL-12, IL-16 and CCR7,
  thereby inhibiting the maturation and pro-inflammatory response of DC.
