caption: Diagram of the inositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways
  in metazoans. To determine if a novel pyrophosphate is derived from IP5 or IP6,
  one can treat the fraction collected by HPLC with diphosphoinositol phosphate phosphatase
  (DIPP) as previously described []. Identification of the alternative pathway to
  generate IP6 is detailed previously [].
