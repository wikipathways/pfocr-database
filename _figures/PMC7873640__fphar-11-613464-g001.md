caption: A detail description of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling and
  interaction of natural compounds in the regulation of this signaling cascade at
  various levels. Natural compounds such as the resveratrol modulate TGF-β pathway
  by inhibiting the receptor activity such as the attachment of TGF-β to TGF-βRII
  and thus prevent the downstream activation of Smads. Curcumin and Nobilitin both
  modulate Smad2/3/4 and prevent the activation of TGF-β pathway signaling genes such
  as the TWIST1, SNAIL, and SLUG. Caricoside E blocks the formation of Smad complex
  and their translocation to the nucleus. Arctigenin inhibits the TGF-β–mediated activation
  of ERK and thus triggers apoptosis. Baicalin has also been reported that inhibit
  TGF-βRII expression and thus downstream signaling of TGF-β pathway.
