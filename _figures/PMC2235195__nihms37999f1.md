caption: RA synthesis pathway. Conversion of vitamin A (retinol) to retinoic acid
  (RA) requires two sequential oxidation steps. First, retinol is oxidized to retinaldehyde
  by either alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR).
  Second, retinaldehyde is oxidized to RA by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH).
  Once synthesized, RA can regulate transcription by serving as a ligand for nuclear
  RA receptors (RAR), or RA can be further oxidized by P450 enzymes (CYP26) as part
  of a degradative pathway.
