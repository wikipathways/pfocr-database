caption: 'Proposed mechanism of EA inhibition of osteoclast formation caused by LPS.
  (a) In LPS-induced periodontitis, TLR4-mediated phosphorylation of IκB kinase α
  and β (IKKα/β) and NF-κB induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in periodontal tissue cells and the generation of
  the osteoclastogenic receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), an osteoclastogenic
  factor. However, it inactivates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and promotes
  β-catenin degradation. Furthermore, production of the secreted protein semaphorin
  3A (Sema3A) is decreased; Sema3A/neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)-mediated β-catenin degradation
  and nuclear translocation are suppressed, as is transcription and expression of
  osteoprotegerin (OPG), the decoy receptor for RANKL. Finally, the RANKL/OPG ratio
  is increased, leading to osteoclast formation and maturation and subsequent bone
  resorption. (b) Proposed mechanism of EA-induced suppression of osteoclastogenesis
  by LPS: EA strongly suppresses the activation of IKKα/β and NF-κB, indicating that
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated and β-catenin degradation is suppressed.
  Furthermore, Sema3A production is elevated, Sema3A/Nrp1-mediated β-catenin degradation
  is suppressed, and nuclear migration is promoted. This suppresses osteoclast formation
  and excessive bone resorption.'
