caption: 'The HOCl signaling pathway A. Transformed cells. The peroxidase domain (PODFeIII)
  (#1) is released from DUOX through the activity of matrix metalloproteases (#2).
  (DUOX is expressed on transformed, nontransformed and tumor cells). The membrane
  of malignant cells, but not that of nontransformed cells contains active NADPH oxidase1
  (NOX1) that generates extracellular superoxide anions (#3). These form H2O2 after
  dismutation (#4) and are used as substrate by PODFeIII for the synthesis of HOCl
  in a two step reaction (#5 and #6) that involves compound I (PODFeIV=O·+) as intermediate.
  HOCl reacts with NOX1-derived superoxide anions (#7), resulting in the formation
  of hydroxyl radicals (#8) that cause lipid peroxidation and subsequent activation
  of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (#9). Proton pumps in the cell membrane
  (#10) favour the generation of HOCl from OCl−. In the presence of excess H2O2 compared
  to peroxidase, HOCl signaling is impaired through a catalase-like activity of peroxidase
  (#11), the reaction between HOCl and H2O2 (#12) and the reaction between H2O2 and
  hydroxyl radicals (#13). B. Tumor cells. Tumor cells carry catalase (CAT) covalently
  attached to the outside of their membrane. Catalase decomposes H2O (#5) and thus
  inhibits HOCl synthesis (#6,#7). This prevents HOCl/superoxide anion interaction
  and formation of apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals (#8).'
