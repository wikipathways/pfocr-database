caption: Mechanisms of Annexin A1 in tumorigenesis. (A) Annexin A1 promotes cell invasion
  by activating ERK/ITGB1BP1 signaling pathway through PFRs in gastrointestinal cancer
  cells, and Annexin A1 inhibits the activity of COX-2 to promote cell proliferation.
  (B) Annexin A1 promotes EMT through NF-κB and TGFβ signal pathway to increase invasion
  and migration of breast cancer cells, while TGFβ inhibitor SB-431542 can transform
  tumor cells back into epithelial cells. Annexin A1 also induces drug resistance
  in breast cancer cells. (C) Annexin A1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and
  invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells by promoting Snail and inhibiting
  E-cadherin.
