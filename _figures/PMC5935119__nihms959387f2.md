caption: (a). Human genetics data serves as the foundation for ongoing efforts to
  develop therapies to reduce lipoprotein(a) levels, a causal risk factor for coronary
  artery disease. a | The selection of lipoprotein(a) as a therapeutic target was
  supported by a 2009 genome-wide association study comparing 1,145 CAD cases to 3,352
  controls, noting a robust association between variants near the LPA gene, levels
  of circulating lipoprotein(a), and risk of coronary artery disease.b | A dose-response
  relationship was noted, such that a given variant’s impact on circulating lipoprotein(a)
  levels was predictive of the association with CAD (Reproduced with permission from
  REF ) c | In order to anticipate the full spectrum of phenotypic consequences of
  lipoprotein(a) reduction, a phenome-wide association study was performed among participants
  of the UK Biobank. A genetically-mediated one standard deviation decrease in levels
  of lipoprotein(a) was associated with a reduced risk of six distinct diseases (Reproduced

  of lipoprotein(a) was associated with a >80% decrease in circulating levels, providing
  proof-of-principle that targeting this causal pathway in a highly specific fashion
