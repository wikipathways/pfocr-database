caption: Schematic representation of MSC-ACE2 ameliorate S. uberis-induced Inflammatory
  Injury in Mammary Epithelial Cells by upregulating the IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3 Pathway
  (Charting with BioRender.com software). Treatment of EpH4-Ev cells with S. uberis
  at MOI = 10 for 3 h caused EpH4-Ev cells pyroptosis, activated MAPKs/NF-κB signaling
  pathways, promoted the release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-Iβ, and IL-18,
  induced apoptosis, and disrupted the blood-milk barrier. Co-culture with MSC, MSC-GFP
  or MSC-ACE2 activated the IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway and inhibited MAPKs/NF-κB,
  apoptosis, and pyroptosis pathways. Furthermore, MSC-ACE2 reversed the S. uberis-induced
  downregulation of Occludin, ZO-1, and Claudin-3 expression levels and promoted blood-milk
  barrier repair. MSC-ACE2 had a better effect than MSC alone.
