caption: 'Figure 1A. At a basal level, NIK undergoes constant proteosomal degradation,
  executed by four E3 uibiquitin ligases, cIAP1/2 and TRAF2/3. Under such conditions,
  minimal signaling emanates from NIK. B. Upon ligand stimulation (for example, LTβR
  or CD40), there are two possible processes for activation of the non-canonical pathway:
  1) E3 ubiquitin ligases such as TRAF2 and 3 are degraded, leading to stabilization
  of NIK; 2) when the receptor is activated, it competes for TRAF2/3, thus disassembling
  the degradative complex from NIK. As a result, NIK becomes stabilized to perform
  downstream functions, including stimulation of p100 proteolysis. When NIK is stabilized
  by inducers of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, amplification of the canonical NF-κB
  pathway can occur, even though NIK is not required for this pathway.'
