caption: Pathway analysis by IPA software based on the Chemoresistance dataset and
  gene lists related to A) Chemoresistance, B) Survival, C) ECM invasion and remodeling,
  and D) Migration created using the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The relations between
  the genes were inferred from the relationships known in the scientific literature
  using data-mining Ingenuity software. Each node represents a gene; red color denotes
  over-expressed genes; green color denotes down-expressed genes. The colors intensity
  appears according to the related expression level by fold change. Connections indicate
  direct regulatory interactions. Arrows are colored differently to ease the identification
  of the genes involved in over-represented Canonical Pathways and Biomarkers according
  to Ingenuity Knowledge Base.
