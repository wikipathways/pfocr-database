caption: Hypothetical model of miR-338-5p involved in metastatic progression of human
  colorectal cancer. MiR-338-5p is located at an intronic region within AATK gene.
  MiR-338-5p cleaves PIK3C3 mRNA and inhibits the membrane nucleation of autophagosome
  by phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI). Inhibited autophagy then suppresses
  the degradation of Snail and Twist and promotes the tumour metastasis through EMT
  pathway. But, autophagy could not reverse this pathway completely, indicating that
  miR-338-5p may promote metastasis of CRC by inhibiting other target genes.
