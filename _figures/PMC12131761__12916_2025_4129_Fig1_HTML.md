caption: 'Analysis flowchart. In the Mendelian randomisation section, the three key
  assumptions are illustrated and can be described as follows: (1) Instruments must
  be robustly associated with the exposure—usually defined as genome-wide statistical
  significance of the variants; (2) There are no measured or unmeasured confounders
  of the instrument and (3) Instruments are not associated with the outcome via pathways
  other than through the exposure, for example through horizontal pleiotropy. These
  assumptions are known as the (1) relevance, (2) independence and (3) exclusion restriction
  assumption, respectively. ANX = anxiety; ALS = amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; AD = Alzheimer’s
  disease; BP = bipolar disorder; DEP = depression; MS = multiple sclerosis; PD = Parkinson’s
  disease; SCZ = schizophrenia'
