caption: Proposed redox-mediated endothelial cell-aortic smooth muscle cell communication.
  When fed a diet containing 4.0% NaCl, endothelial activity of NOX4 produced amounts
  of H2O2 sufficient to generate an endothelial cell-aortic smooth muscle cell communication
  that directly altered smooth muscle function. Specifically, reduction in PP2a activity
  promoted Akt activation and downstream inactivation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a. Stimulation
  of this important signaling pathway increased Runx2 and reduced catalase, which
  facilitated the activity of H2O2 and increased further Runx2 in aortic smooth muscle.
