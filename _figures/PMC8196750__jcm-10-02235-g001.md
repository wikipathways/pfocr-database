caption: Diagram depicting the secretion of agrin from the presynaptic membrane and
  its interaction with Lrp4, which results in reorganization and reorientation of
  MuSK, promoting a signaling pathway that leads to synaptic differentiation, including
  clustering of AChRs. This involves recruiting rapsyn which links AChRs to the cytoskeleton
  (not shown).
