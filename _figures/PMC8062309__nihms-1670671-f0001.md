caption: The complement cascade is initiated through the classical, lectin, and alternative
  pathways. Complement activation results in inflammation primarily mediated through
  anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, pathogen opsonization for phagocytosis via C3b, and
  cell lysis through the terminal membrane attack complex formation. Endogenous soluble
  regulators of complement activation (CFH, CFI, CFHR1) and membrane-bound regulators
  (MCP, DAF, and CD59) work through inhibition of the complement pathway at different
  steps. Various pharmacologic agents also target the complement activation at different
  steps. Schematic for the level of complement component activation is represented
  for healthy pregnancy (upper two squares) and in preeclampsia (PE, lower two squares)
  and separated by local decidua complement activation (left squares) and peripheral
  complement activation (right squares). Complement component levels are increased
  (red), decreased (blue), or unchanged (purple) depending on the disease state and
  location in pregnancy. Created with BioRender.com
