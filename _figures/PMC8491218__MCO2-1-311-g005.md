caption: Procedure for pathway gene selection. An initial set of genes with known
  associations to a particular TKI (here, we show a subset of sorafenib‐related genes)
  are selected and then evaluated by MFA, which was used to find a correlation between
  cell line drug sensitivity (GI50) and the GE or CN of these genes in those cell
  lines (left). MFA correlation circles visualize these relationships (bottom). The
  gene list is extended, using pathway and interaction databases (i.e. PathwayCommons)
  to find genes related to curated genes which showed MFA correlation to GI50 (one‐node
  distant genes; middle‐left). The list is extended again from the MFA‐correlating
  one‐node distant genes (two‐node distant genes; middle‐right). All curated and extended
  genes which showed an MFA correlation were then used as features to generate a final
  predictive SVM gene signature for the evaluated TKI (right). Genes within the best
  performing sorafenib signature are indicated in thick borders (black for curated
  genes; purple for pathway‐extended genes)
