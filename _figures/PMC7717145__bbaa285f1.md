caption: Disease-based pathway analysis of genes involved in the pathogenesis of lung
  diseases and respiratory failure. (A) Genes involved in these two disease entities
  retrieved from DisGeNET include ACE, ACE2, FOXF1, CFTR, CSF2, TNF, TLR4 and CXCL8.
  (B) Functional protein-protein association networks between SMN1, SMN1-interacting
  proteins and respiratory disease-related proteins (including ACE and ACE2) were
  analyzed by STRING.
