caption: Summary of the vasoconstriction signal transduction pathways showing points
  of intervention by Xyl-B. Vascular tone is the result of joint regulation of endothelium
  and smooth muscle and endothelium-dependent vasodilation is regulated primarily
  by NO-sGC-cGMP signaling cascade and prostacyclin (PGI2) in vascular smooth muscle
  cells. PGI2 is produced by the cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, which form the
  prostaglandin endoperoxide PGG2, PGG2 is converted to PGH2 which is then transformed
  enzymatically into PGI2 by prostacyclin synthase. Our present study demonstrated
  that Xyl-B affected eNOS activity and cGMP level, and sGC was also involved but
  PGI2pathway was not. Additionally, as Xyl-B's inhibitory effect on vasoconstriction
  could not be completely explained by endothelial pathway, we furtherly found that
  Xyl-B regulated vascular tone by affecting both voltage dependent calcium entry
  (VDCC) and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in vascular smooth muscle cells.
