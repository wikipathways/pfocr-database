caption: 'T. cruzi complement evasion mechanisms. There are three complement pathways:
  classic, alternative, and lectin. (A) In the classical pathway, antibodies bound
  to pathogen antigens interact with the complement C1 protein, which cleaves C2 and
  C4 to generate C2a and C4b; these molecules bind to the pathogen surface to form
  the C3 convertase C4b2a. (B) In the lectin pathway, MBL or ficolin binds to mannan
  or glycosylated molecules, respectively, on the pathogen surface, and cysteine proteases
  bound to these molecules cleave C2 and C4, also generating the C3 convertase C4b2a.
  (C) In the alternative pathway, spontaneously hydrolyzed C3b or C3b originating
  from the other complement pathways interacts with factor B, which is cleaved into
  Bb by factor D, forming the C3 convertase C3bBb. The C3 convertases from all the
  complement pathways interact with newly cleaved C3b, forming a C5 convertase that
  cleaves C5 into C5b. (D) C5b interacts with C6–C9 to form the MAC, leading to the
  pathogen lysis. (E) To avoid lysis, T. cruzi relies on molecules, such as calreticulin
  and gp58/68 (Gp58), which block the initial steps of classic/lectin or alternative
  pathways, respectively, and CRIT, T-DAF, CRP, and host-derived microvesicles that
  disrupt or block C3 convertase assembly. Ag, antigen; Carb, carbohydrate; Calre,
  calreticulin.'
