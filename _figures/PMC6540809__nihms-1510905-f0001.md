caption: (a) Myelin-reactive antibodies secreted by autoreactive plasmablasts and
  plasma cells mediate destruction of the myelin sheath by binding C1q and activating
  the classical complement pathway or initiating FcγRIIIa-mediated antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity by NK cells. b) B cells expressing a myelin-reactive
  BCR are capable of processing myelin protein and presenting myelin peptide to autoreactive
  CD4+ T cells, resulting in their activation and proliferation. (c, d) B cells are
  able to foster an environment conducive to autoimmunity by (c) secreting higher
  amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and GM-CSF compared with regulatory
  cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b and (d) by secreting cytokines/chemokines including
  CXCL13 and BAFF which promote the differentiation of FDCs and establishment of TLOs,
  which facilitate the activation and expansion of autoreactive B and T cells. N=
  Neuron, PB= Plasmablast, PC= Plasma cell, FDC= Follicular dendritic cell, TLO= Tertiary
  lymphoid organ.
