caption: 'Representation of the amyloidogenic pathway and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation.
  The formation of β-amyloid plaques (amyloidogenic pathway) occurs in the cell membrane
  and is due to the cleavage of APP by β-secretase, which gives rise to two products:
  a soluble APP fragment (sAPPβ), which is released into the extracellular space and
  a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (C99). This is later cleaved by γ-secretase,
  originating APP intracellular domain (AICD) and Aβ peptides, that further forms
  oligomers and, eventually, accumulate in Aβ plaques. The formation of neurofibrillary
  tangles (hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein) occurs due to hyperphosphorylation
  of Tau protein, which loses affinity for microtubules and thus causes their disintegration
  in AD.'
