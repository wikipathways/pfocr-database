caption: A phenotypic screen can identify novel genes involved in the disease pathway.
  A collection of mutant alleles (gene A–gene Z) can be used to identify genes that
  when mutated result in the same phenotype (phenocopy) e.g., lack of flying ability
  for pink1-mutant flies that are mimicked by parkin-mutant flies. To test if these
  genes function in the same pathway, the phenotypes of double-mutant flies can be
  tested. Loss of gene M worsens the phenotype of the disease mutant, thus, separate
  pathways play a role that converge into one. Loss of gene M does not enhance or
  improve the phenotype of the mutant meaning that these genes function in the same
  pathway (e.g., Pink1-Parkin). Overexpression (OE) of gene M rescues the mutant phenotype
  hints towards gene M functioning downstream of the mutant (e.g., Parkin functions
  downstream of Pink1).
