caption: 'Proposed pathway for the MHC class II-mediated presentation of an intracellular
  influenza virus antigen to CD4 T cells, as gleaned from the new paper by Deng et
  al. []. Following infection, viral RNA is transcribed in the nucleus and viral proteins
  are then translated in the cytoplasm. Viral nucleoprotein (NP), and possibly other
  viral proteins, are then targeted by autophagy, which involves the generation of
  a phagophore via nucleation mediated by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
  (PI3K) complex I (consisting in part of PI3K catalytic subunit type 3/vacuolar protein
  sorting 34 [PIK3C3/VPS34] and BECLIN1), and expansion and sealing of the phagophore
  via the E1-like ubiquitin enzyme autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), which also contributes
  to the conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-I
  with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to generate LC3-II. Typically, the autophagosome
  then fuses with a lysosome to form an autolysosome, leading to cargo degradation
  and recycling, but influenza virus blocks this step. The NP-laden autophagosome
  instead fuses with the MHC class II compartment (MIIC), which contains class II
  proteins and enzymes of the classical class II antigen processing machinery – gamma-interferon-inducible
  lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), various proteases, and the peptide exchange factor
  H2-M. However, the contribution of this machinery to NP processing is yet to be
  tested. MHC class II proteins normally reach MIICs following their synthesis in
  the ER where they are bound by a placeholder polypeptide called invariant chain
  that, upon arrival in MIICs, is degraded by proteases. Following loading with NP
  peptide, the class II molecules traffic to the cell surface for display to CD4 T
  cells expressing cognate T cell receptor (TCR). Abbreviations: 3-MA, 3-methyladenine;
  HA, hemagglutinin; NA, neuraminidase'
