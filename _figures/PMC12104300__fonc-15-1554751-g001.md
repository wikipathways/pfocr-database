caption: 'Eph/ephrin signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): regulatory
  pathways, tumor progression, and therapeutic implications. EphA2-VEGF-AKT/mTOR signaling
  promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis inhibition. The EphrinA3-PI3K/AKT-EMT
  axis drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion. EphrinA4-EphA10
  interaction activates ERK, inducing cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion via OCT4 and
  NANOG. EphA8 overexpression enhances tumor invasion. The EphB4-ephrinB2 pathway
  regulates microvascular density (MVD) and vascular invasion, activating multiple
  pro-migratory pathways, including EGFR, FAK, ERK1/2, p38, AKT, and JNK1/2. EphB6
  overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, while the EphrinB1-TUBB4B
  complex sustains the CSC niche and worsens prognosis. In the lower panel, Eph receptors
  and ephrin ligands associated with disease-free survival are highlighted, along
  with mediators correlated with prognosis in OSCC. The data reflects gene expression
  and immunohistochemistry levels reported in various studies, illustrating their
  correlation with clinical outcomes in affected patients. Created in BioRender. Egal,
