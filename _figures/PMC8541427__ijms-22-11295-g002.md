caption: The mammalian insulin signaling pathway, a simplified schematic representation.
  Insulin receptor (IR) through insulin receptor substrate (IRS) creates binding sites
  that recruit the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane.
  PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which can be dephosphorylated back to PP2 by phosphatase
  and tensin homologue (PTEN), a lipid phosphatase. PIP3 recruits phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) and serine/threonine protein kinase AKT to the plasma membrane,
  where AKT is fully activated by PDK1 and by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  (mTORC) protein kinases. AKT controls cellular metabolism through key downstream
  substrates. In particular, AKT inhibits the activity of GSK3, thus stimulating the
  glycogen synthesis by glycogen synthase (GS). In addition, it promotes the translocation
  of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, through TBC1 domain family member 4 (TBC1D4), thus
  favoring glucose uptake; AKT prevents gluconeogenesis and apoptosis by controlling
  the activity of forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors; AKT controls cell growth
  and metabolism by regulating mTORC activity.  was created with BioRender.com (https://app.biorender.com,
