caption: 'Membrane molecular pathways of Na+signalling in astrocytes. Influx of Na+
  occurs though (i) Na+-permeable channels which include ionotropic receptors (AMPAR,
  NMDAR, P2XR: AMPA, NMDA glutamate receptors and ionotropic purinoceptors, respectively);
  channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family (TRPC1/4/5 channels that
  operate as a part of store-operated Ca2+ entry and hence generate Na+ influx in
  response to the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores; as well as TRPA1
  and TRPV4 channels); voltage-dependent Nav channels and [Na+]o-activated Nax channels;
  (ii) through Na+-dependent SLC transporters that include excitatory amino acid transporters
  EAAT1,2, GABA transporters GAT 1,3, glycine transporters GlyT, noradrenaline transporters
  NET and concentrative adenosine transporters CNT2,3. The main pathway for Na+ exit
  is provided by Na+-K+ pump, NKA. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX fluctuates between forward
  and reverse modes and couples Na+ and Ca2+signalling. Other abbreivations as in
