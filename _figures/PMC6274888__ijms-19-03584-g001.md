caption: The response to immunotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
  relies on destroying cancer cells as well as on breaking the stromal barrier and
  flaring up immune function. Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and TME
  has disrupted the traditional method of cancer treatment and countered the immune-related
  adverse events in patients. In addition to direct cytotoxicity on cancer cells,
  it is important to dissect the immunosuppressive microenvironment with various cytokines
  and immune cells. Furthermore, recognition of mechanisms modulating the PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway and TME will identify more potential therapeutic targets in the future.
