caption: Systemic functions of LGR4. LGR4 plays a significant role in embryonic development/stem
  cell maintenance through its binding to RSPO1 and regulation of the WNT signaling
  pathway. LGR4 reduces inflammation in multiple tissues through inhibition of NFκB
  signaling and cytokine production. LGR4 affects metabolism through multiple mechanisms
  including circadian clock, oxidative and glycolytic pathways regulation.
