caption: 'Three theoretical pathways of plant–OMV interactions (Illustrator: Maraszewska
  Małgorzata). (1) OMVs enter plant cells after recognition of OMV-associated MAMPs
  by RLKs and RLPs (PRRs) and activate PTI. The binding of MAMPs to PRRs results in
  their dimerization. The intracellular domain of PRR dimers phosphorylates RBOHD,
  leading to ROS bursts and rapid Ca2+ ion-flux. An increase in Ca2+ concentration
  activates CDPK and MAPK and co-regulates the activity of RBOHD. Activation of MAPKs
  and CDPKs induces cascades of immune signaling by phosphorylation, resulting the
  activation of transcription factors (TFs) in the nucleus and regulating gene expression.
  (2) OMVs lyse and release the cargo due to the acidic environment of the plant apoplast.
  Hydrolases released from OMV disturb CWI. CWI is controlled by plasma membrane-localized
  receptor-like kinases THE1 and FER. FER acts as a cell surface regulator for ROP/RAC
  GTPases responsible for activating RBOHD, ROS burst, changes in cytosolic pH and
  Ca2+ concentration, and also CDPK and MAPK activity. (3) OMVs may enter into the
  plant cells by the clathrin-independent pathway through lipid rafts (A) or clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis (B). The latter route begins with invagination of clathrin-coated pits
  (CCPs) with simultaneous recruitment of conserved adaptor protein complex 2. Mature
  clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) detach from the plasma membrane and move into the
  cytosol with the involvement of the cytoskeleton. The last stage of endocytosis
  is the uncoating and release of CCV cargo to the cytoplasm or transporting the CCV
  to the early endosome, where the fate of CCV is determined. In both pathways, the
  OMV cargo, being recognized by cytoplasmic receptors NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich
  repeat receptor), may activate MAMP-induced defense components (RBOHD, ROS burst,
  MAPKs, and CDPKs) or changes in defense genes’ expression.'
