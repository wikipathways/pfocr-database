caption: 'Leu supplementation leads to tumor cell death by inducing apoptosis and
  oxidative stress. Leu supplementation can lead to tumor cells death via the following
  three mechanisms: (1) The modulation of tumor cell metabolism. Leu supplementation
  favors oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) over glycolysis by increasing oxygen consumption
  and mitochondrial biogenesis, while reducing glucose consumption. This metabolic
  shift promotes apoptosis and oxidative stress in tumor cells; (2) The regulation
  of the mTORC1 signaling through kinase pathway. Leu supplementation inhibits the
  expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and increases p53 levels. This
  results in the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT1/mTORC1 signaling axis in tumor cells,
  leading to apoptosis and tumor cell death; (3) The modulation of the immune response.
  Leu supplementation enhances anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting immunosuppressive
  regulatory T cells. This effect is mediated by mTORC1 activation, which leads to
  the inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Additionally, Leu competes
  with kynurenine in the kynurenine pathway (KP), thereby restoring the antitumor
  effects of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Therefore, the inhibitory effect
  of Leu, in combination with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan
  2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) inhibitors on kynurenine. Arrows in green stand for “activation”,
  “stimulation”, “increase in level”. Arrows in red stand for “decease in level”.
  Red bars and crosses stand for “inhibition”'
