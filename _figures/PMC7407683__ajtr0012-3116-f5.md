caption: 'FSH and ovarian cancer. FSH stimulates ovarian stem cells and very small
  non-embryonic like stem cells, they are associated with neo-oogenesis and primordial
  follicle assembly in normal ovary. However, over-expressed FSH in ovarian cancer
  accelerates and exaggerates this process which leads to ovarian cancer cell proliferation.
  Additionally, OCT4 cancer stem cells signaling pathway are found stimulated in ovarian
  cancer, suggesting it involves in ovarian cancer cell proliferation. TRPC3 relays
  the signal from FSH to PI3K/Akt and its downstream target: snail, which is responsible
  for EMT. Meanwhile, PI3K/Akt degrades HIF-1α by stimulating Gankyrin. Gankyrin stimulates
  PI3K/Akt by modulating PTEN, consisting of positive feedback of PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. Furthermore, FSH interacts with ROS, leading to the upregulation of Nrf2
  and HIF-1α, and in turn upregualtes VEGF level, which is associated with angiogenesis.'
