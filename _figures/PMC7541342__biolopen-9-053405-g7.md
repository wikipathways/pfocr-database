caption: Cell to cell communication mediate GB progression in Drosophila. Glioma cells
  produce a network of TMs that grow to reach the surrounding tissue that includes
  neurons. Grnd is increased in the GB TMs and Egr is produced in the surrounding
  tissue. Egr activates the JNK signalling pathway through Grnd in GB. As a consequence,
  MMPs are upregulated in GB and facilitate further TM infiltration in the brain that
  is necessary for synapse loss in the surrounding neurons and GB cell number increase.
  This results in tumour progression and lethality.
