caption: Integrin signalling at focal adhesions. After binding to the extracellular
  matrix (ECM), the cytoplasmic tail of integrin beta 1 recruits focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK), which is activated by auto-phosphorylation at the tyrosine 397, and thereby
  allow the binding and activation of Src by phosphorylation of tyrosine 418. The
  activated FAK/Src complex phosphorylates other kinases (i.e. p130Cas and PI3K),
  which in turn elicit a cascade of events that lead to cell proliferation, survival
  and migration. Alternatively, alpha subunits of certain integrins are able to recruit
  Fyn (a Src family member) via caveolin-1. This allows the activation of Shc, which
  combines with adaptor proteins Grb2 and SOS in order to activate the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAP kinase pathway. As represented, the integrin pathway
  has reciprocal action with other signalling cascades triggered by several growth
  factor receptors.
