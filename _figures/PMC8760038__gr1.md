caption: Mechanistic pathway for PGPR-mediated drought tolerance in plants.Main mechanisms
  of PGPR-mediated plant drought resistance.(1) PGPRs regulate the accumulation of
  abscisic acid (ABA), auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CK), and gibberellin (GA) in plant
  cells to activate signal transduction pathways.(2) PGPRs produce ACC deaminase to
  reduce ethylene (ET) content in roots, activating signal transduction pathways.(3)
  PGPRs produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) to form EPS biofilms, rhizosheath structures
  (RS), and small soil aggregates, helping plants to absorb water and nutrients under
  drought stress.(4) PGPRs produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under drought
  stress, activating plant drought response without direct plant contact.
