caption: Cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous paths to NFκB pathway activation
  in MPNs. (A) Hypothesized pathways for cell-autonomous activation of NFκB downstream
  of active JAK2. JAK2 is activated by cytokine receptors such as MPL, or constitutively
  resulting from the V617F mutation. Active JAK2 activates RAS, in turn activating
  the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling cascades, which are active in MPN HSPCs.
  Reported inputs of these pathways to NFκB include phosphorylation of IKK1 by AKT
  and phosphorylation of p65/RELA by S6 kinase (, ). The cell cycle kinase CDK6, a
  transcriptional target of both JAK/STAT and NFκB signaling, also can phosphorylate
  RELA (). Active phosphorylated RELA translocates to the nucleus to mediate transcription.
  (B) Several non-cell-autonomous inputs overproduced in MPNs can activate NFκB. MPN
  driver mutations produce JAK2 hyperactivity, which leads to pathophysiologic production
  of TNF, IL-1, and TLR ligands S100A8/A9 and related family members. NFκB is activated
  either by TNFRs via TRAFs and TAK1, or by TLRs or IL-1 receptor, via the adaptor
  protein MYD88, which binds to these receptors, and recruits IRAK1/IRAK4 kinase heterodimers,
  which in turn activate the IKK complex.
