caption: Compound 1-(S,Rp) stalls DNA replication in pancreatic ductal adenoma carcinoma
  cells resulting in activation of downstream signalling pathways and replication
  fork arrest. Highlighted in green are genes of this pathway that are statistically
  significantly transcriptionally activated in response to treatment with 1-(S,Rp).
  These include three out of the four genes involved in formation of the ‘9-1-1 checkpoint
  complex clamp’ (HUS1, Rad1 and Rad17) and two out of the three genes that form the
  MRN complex (MRE11 and NBN). Also detected experimentally and shown as red circles
  was phosphorylation of RPA1 and both checkpoint kinases 1 and 2. Diagram created
