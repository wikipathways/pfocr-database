caption: Autoregulation of nodulation (AON). Low N levels induce roots to produce
  flavonoids which stimulate rhizosphere-associated rhizobia to produce LCO. In L.
  japonicus, these regulate the major transcription factor NIN which activates both
  NF subunits YA1/YB1 as well as ASL18/LBD16, whose interaction initiates nodulation
  and nodule development. NIN also induces the expression of genes coding for nodulation-suppressing
  CLE peptides [mainly CLE ROOT SIGNAL 1 and 2 (CLE-RS1/2)], which are transported
  to the shoot and perceived by their receptor HAR1. This results in decreased accumulation
  and shoot–root mobilization of miR2111, which negatively regulates the nodulation
  suppressor TML. CLE–HAR1 interaction also leads to higher CK synthesis and signalling
  due to increased expression of IPTG3 and CK translocation to the roots to suppress
  further nodulation events through their receptor LHK1. This receptor also induces
  the expression of CLE-RS3, inducing a positive feedback loop on its own regulation,
  and is required for TML effect in the root cortex. In M. truncatula, low N conditions
  also stimulate roots to synthetize CEP1, which is mobilized to the shoot where its
  candidate receptor CRA2 positively regulates nodulation. RDN1 arabinosylates rhizobia-induced
  CLE12, similar to how CLE-RS2 is arabinosylated in L. japonicus to interact with
  HAR1, while LSS (LIKE SUNN SUPERNODULATOR) also further regulates the expression
  of the HAR1 orthologue SUNN. Mutations in these genes affect LR development since
  they also participate in the plant response to external N. Finally, NF-YA1/YB1 and
  ASL18/LBD16 have positive roles in LR development. Together, these genetic interactions
  show how several of the genes implicated in nodule development and the AON pathway
  overlap with those that regulate LR development. Black lines with arrowheads signify
  a positive effect while blunt-ended magenta lines indicate a negative effect. Solid
  lines indicate regulation while dashed lines signal mobilization to a different
  plant organ. Nodule and LR development are highlighted and in bold. Light brown
  indicates below-ground.
