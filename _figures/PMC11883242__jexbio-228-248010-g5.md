caption: Proposed signalling pathway demonstrating the roles of l-glutamate and ATP
  in controlling contractions (sneezes). A mechanical or chemical stimulus activates
  sensory cilia, triggering the release of glutamate. Metabotropic glutamate receptors
  (mGluRs) on contractile cells lining the aquiferous canal system become activated
  and trigger the release of ATP (1). ATP increases intracellular calcium levels and
  nitric oxide to expand the excurrent canals. Ca2+ also aids in signal amplification
  and propagation by causing the release of more signalling molecules (e.g. ATP and
  glutamate) (2). ATP and glutamate may work in both a paracrine and autocrine manner.
  Eventually, this signal for excurrent canal expansion will weaken as ATP is removed
  from the extracellular space and the signal for constricting the excurrent canals
  will take over, allowing the contraction to come to an end
