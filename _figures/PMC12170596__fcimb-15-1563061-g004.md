caption: Microbiota shapes the suppressive immune microenvironment. H. pylori induces
  expression of the NKG2D ligand in gastric epithelial cells, which is released from
  the cell surface via protein hydrolysis or extracellular vesicles, leading to decreased
  expression of the NKG2D receptor on NK cells and cytotoxic granule degranulation,
  thereby facilitating immune evasion by tumor cells. P. acnes activates the TLR4/PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway, inducing M2 TAM polarization, promoting secretion of immunosuppressive
  factors IL-10 and CCR-2. Butyrate, a derivative of probiotics, negatively regulates
  the NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway, inhibits related macrophage activation,
  and decreases levels of PD-L1 and IL-10 expression, thereby suppressing tumor growth
  in mice. H. pylori activates TLR9, promotes expression of negative feedback regulator
  TRIM30a, downregulates activation of transcription factor IRF3, inhibits the STING
  signaling pathway, and promotes Th17 inflammatory responses and anti-tumor responses
  in vivo. H. pylori drives activation of pro-inflammatory T cells, secretes IL-21,
  induces phosphorylation of STAT3, and induces expression of RORγ-t, promoting Th17
  differentiation and IL-17 secretion. H. pylori activates dendritic cells via the
  TLR2/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-18 axis to induce Tregs, shaping the immune suppressive
  microenvironment. H. pylori and Methylobacterium can reduce expression of TGF-β
  and CD8+ T cell infiltration in a GC mouse model, but their mechanisms remain to
  be elucidated
