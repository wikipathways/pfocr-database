caption: 'Proposed NLRP3 priming and activation pathway in PD. Priming: (1) The first
  signals associated with the priming process may be caused by PAMPs/DAMPs or pathologic
  αSyn binding to TLRs, followed by (2) activation of downstream NF-κB transcription.
  This induces the upregulation of (3) NLRP3 and (3) pro-IL-1β/pro-IL-18 transcription
  in the cell. Activation: The second signal corresponding to the activation process
  may come from (1) the novel TLR5/ion flux in association with the P2X7 receptor/lysosome/mitochondrial
  dysfunction. These events induced (2) K+ efflux in addition to Na+/Ca+ influx, cathepsin
  B release, or mtROS/mtDNA production in the cell. When this process is completed,
  (3) NLRP3’s full structure will be recruited, releasing (4) caspase-1 and maturing
  (4) IL-1β/IL-18. Active caspase-1 now cleaves GSDMD (5) and forms gasdermin pores
  on the cell membrane, inducing programmed cell death known as (6) pyroptosis. Another
  novel pathway involves the facilitation of Fyn kinase, which allows (1) pathologic
  αSyn to directly prime and activate NLRP3 via the CD36 receptor and TLR2, as well
  as (2) mtROS secretion. PAMPs/DAMPs, pathogen/damage-associated molecular pattern;
