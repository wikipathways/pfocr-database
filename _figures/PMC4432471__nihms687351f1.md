caption: Model for the loss of synapses caused by stress and rapid induction of synaptic
  connections by ketamine. Synaptic connections in the PFC are maintained by normal
  circuit activity, but are decreased by chronic stress exposure, which also reduces
  the expression of BDNF. Ketamine can rapidly reverse the effects of stress by causing
  a burst of glutamate that causes a fast synaptogenic response. This is thought to
  occur via blockade of tonic firing GABAergic interneurons that express NMDA receptors.
  Ketamine induction of synapses requires BDNF and activation of the mTOR signaling
  pathway, which regulates the synthesis of new synaptic proteins, including glutamate
  AMPA receptors. The cycling of AMPA receptors to the membrane is also regulated
  by GSK-3β, a target of lithium that has been implicated in the actions of ketamine.
  Although relatively stable, the new synapses reverse after 7–10 days, consistent
  with the time course for relapse of depressed patients after a single dose of ketamine.
  The effects of stress on synaptic connections can also be influenced by exercise,
  enriched environment, and coping mechanisms.
