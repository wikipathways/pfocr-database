caption: Stigmasterol biosynthesis and the phylogenetic relationship of CYP710A-like
  homologs. (A) The biosynthetic pathway of plant sterols leading to stigmasterol.
  Stigmasterol synthesis starts from acetate followed by a series of steps. Plants
  produce a mixture of sterols, in addition to stigmasterol, including campesterol
  (24-methyl) and sitosterol. The enzyme, sterol C-22 desaturase, catalyzes the conversion
  of sitosterol to stigmasterol. Campesterol is the preferred precursor of brassinosteroids
  (BR). Dashed arrows indicate multiple steps and solid arrows denote single step
  in the pathway. HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; SQS, squalene synthase; SMT1, sterol methyltransferase 1; SMT2/3, sterol
  methyltransferase2/3; DWF1, C-24 sterol reductase; CYP710A, sterol C-22 desaturase.
  (B) A cartoon representation of the mechanism of sterol C-22 desaturase mediated
  conversion of sitosterol to stigmasterol. The site of desaturation is marked in
  red circles. (C) Phylogenetic relationship of the CYP710A-like homologs. Bootstrap
  values are shown as percentages (based on 1,000 replicates). Saccharomyces cerevisiae
