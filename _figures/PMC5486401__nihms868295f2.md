caption: TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) proteins recruit one or several adaptor
  proteins (TNFR associated factors 1 to 6 (TRAFs), TNFR associated death domain protein
  (TRADD) and Fas associated death domain protein (FADD)) after ligand binding. As
  a generalization, TNFRSF proteins that utilize TRAFs (left) can be regarded as proinflammatory
  and induce proliferation (cell cycle proteins), survival (anti-apoptotic proteins),
  differentiation and production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines,
  according to the responding cell type. These processes can be induced via activation
  of one or both nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signalling pathways (canonical and non-canonical)
  as well as via MAP kinase cascades. The canonical NF-κB signalling pathway is IKKβ-dependent
  and involves phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB (IkBα) and nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB subunit p50 and transcription factor p65 (RelA); the non-canonical NF-κB
  signalling pathway is IKKα-dependent and involves activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase
  (NIK), processing of p100 to p52, and nuclear translocation of p52 and RelB. The
  MAP kinase cascades involve c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), p38 or other kinases such as serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT).
  TNFRSF members that contain a ‘death domain’ (right) and recruit the death domain-containing
  adaptor protein FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), such as Fas, TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligands 1 (TRAIL1) and TRAIL2, are often regarded as anti-inflammatory
  as they generally lead to cell death (apoptosis or necroptosis) through activation
  of cysteine-aspartic proteases (caspases) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  (RIP) kinases (not shown). TNFR1 and death receptor 3 (DR3), the receptors that
  recruit the TRADD adaptor proteins, can activate inflammatory responses as TRADD
  can recruit TRAF proteins, but additionally activate death pathways through secondary
  complexes containing TRADD, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase
