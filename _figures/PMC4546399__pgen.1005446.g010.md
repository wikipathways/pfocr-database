caption: Here, we provide a target for the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway mediated
  by the MOM-5/Frizzled receptor, CED-12/ELMO, and CED-10/Rac [], placing MOM-5 and
  small GTPases upstream of UNC-5 to negatively regulate unc-5 and determine the polarity
  of phase 3 DTC migration. MIG-2/RhoG had been shown to function as an activator
  of CED-12/ELMO by recruiting the ELMO/DOCK180 complex to the plasma membrane during
  engulfment of apoptotic cells []. It is possible that also in the DTCs MIG-2/RhoG
  functions upstream of CED-12/ELMO to regulate CED-10/Rac. Ligand in red, small GTPase
  signaling molecules in orange, and receptors in Green.
