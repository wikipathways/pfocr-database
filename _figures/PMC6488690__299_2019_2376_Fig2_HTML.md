caption: Expression of CBFs regulated by light quality, the circadian clock, and photoperiod.
  Under warm daytime, a decrease in the R/FR ratio leads to increased CBF expression
  under long-day or short-day conditions. CCA1 and LHY directly bind to CBF promoters
  to positively regulate CBF expression in the early morning. PhyB and the activity
  of PIF4/7 repress CBF expression by directly binding to the promoter region, whereas
  PIF3 is degraded by EBF1/2. During warm night, CBF expression is inhibited by PRRs
  and PIF3/4/7. Under short-day conditions, cold stress can occur during the day or
  night. ICE1 can be activated to induce CBF expression. CAMTA3 and CAMTA5 regulate
  the expression of CBF1 and CBF2 in response to a rapid temperature decrease. PIF3
  represses CBF expression under cold conditions during day and night to balance CBF
  expression. The expression of CBF is also regulated by chloroplast signals and hormones.
  CAMTAs calmodulin-binding transcription activators, CBF C-repeat binding factor;
