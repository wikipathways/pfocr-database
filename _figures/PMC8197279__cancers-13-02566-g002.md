caption: Immunogenic Cell Death-hallmarks targeted by miRNAs. The miRNA processing
  pathway initiates with the transcription of the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) and its
  cleavage to generate the pre-miRNA. Then, pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm, where it is cleaved to its mature miRNA. The functional strand
  of the mature miRNA has the major role to silence target mRNAs through different
  mechanisms. In this review, we summarize miRNAs that target well-known Immunogenic
  Cell Death-associated DAMPs, such as calreticulin (CRT), HMGB1, and Hsps (Hsp70,
  Hsp90).
