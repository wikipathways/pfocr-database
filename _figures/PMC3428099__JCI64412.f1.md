caption: Tyrosine kinases such as EGF are frequently dysregulated in cancer and signal
  downstream to multiple growth and survival pathways, including the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  and the PI3K/AKT pathways. The prosurvival actions of these pathways are mediated,
  at least in part, through phosphorylation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic BCL-2
  family proteins (e.g., BIM, BAD, and MCL-1), leading to alterations in the relative
  abundance of as well as interactions between these proteins. Note that AKT acts
  indirectly to spare MCL-1 by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase–mediated (GSK-mediated)
  MCL-1 phosphorylation and degradation. TKIs act by blocking EGF signaling to these
  key pathways, and modification of the balance between BCL-2 family proteins may
  contribute to TKI-mediated lethality. As shown by the dashed arrows, FAM83A and
  FAM83B could theoretically act downstream of EGF but upstream of BRAF and p85-PI3K
  to promote activation of these survival pathways, leading to attenuation of cell
  death. FAM83A and FAM83B may also, through a yet to be defined mechanism, modify
  the extent or tonicity of EGF signaling itself. By acting at sites downstream of
  EGF, FAM83A and FAM83B may thereby bypass the block to EFG survival signaling induced
  by TKIs, effectively relieving the cell of its addiction to this survival pathway.
  Such a phenomenon could theoretically be prevented by either developing inhibitors
  of FAM83A and/or FAM83B that interfere with their interactions with proteins such
  as BRAF or specifically targeting downstream components of the pathways responsible
  for the prosurvival actions of these proteins. Adapted with permission from Nature
