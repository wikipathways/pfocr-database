caption: Basal cytokinin levels are quantitatively essential for SAM (shoot apical
  meristem) and RAM (root apical meristem) activity and maintenance, and basic shoot
  and root development. High-level tZ is dispensable for root growth and development,
  but specifically promotes shoot growth. Bidirectional transport systems via xylem
  and phloem likely support the predominant shoot destination of tZ, tZR or tZRPs
  originated from either shoots or roots. (Inset) The cytokinin synthesis pathway
  is initiated by IPTs (adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases) using DMAPP (dimethylallyl
  diphosphate) and ATP, ADP or AMP to generate iPRPs (iP riboside 5'-phosphates).
  CYP735A1/A2 convert iPRPs to tZRPs. LOGs (cytokinin nucleoside 5'monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase)
  release active cytokinins, N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) and trans-zeatin (tZ).
