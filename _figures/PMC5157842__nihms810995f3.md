caption: Proposed model for how APP family proteins regulate the motile behavior of
  developing neurons in response to context-dependent guidance cues. (A), Stimulation
  of human APP (or insect APPL) by endogenous ligands activates the heterotrimeric
  G protein Goα (Goα*), which in turn induces Goα-dependent effectors (including Ca2+
  influx) that alter cytoskeletal dynamics required for filopodial retraction. During
  normal development, this signaling pathway helps restrict inappropriate neuronal
  migration and outgrowth, and might also regulate synaptic pruning. In neurodegenerative
  conditions like Alzheimer’s Disease, multiple factors (including Aβ) might induce
  the misregulation of APP signaling, provoking Goα hyperactivation and Ca2+ overload
  that results in neuronal dysfunction and death. (B), Within the developing ENS of
  Manduca, APPL acts as a Goα-coupled receptor (B1) for ligands encountered by the
  migratory EP cells when they extend filopodia off their normal band pathways. Stimulation
  of APPL induces the local activation of Goα within filopodia (B2), resulting in
  Goα-dependent Ca2+ influx (via a voltage-independent Ca2+ current). In turn, Ca2-dependent
  modulation of the actin cytoskeleton results in filopodial retraction, helping to
  keep the neurons on their correct band pathways. A variety of potential ligands
  associated with the ensheathing glial cells and interband musculature might trigger
  APPL-Goα signaling, including insect Contactin (B4). However, in other neurons (and
  in other regions), ligands associated with permissive regions might activate different
  APP/L-linked signaling pathways that promote growth. For example APP interactions
  with the adapter protein Disabled (DAB) can induce the activation of Abl kinase
  [], which might enhance actin remodeling to promote outgrowth (B3). In this manner,
  APP family proteins can function as “molecular hubs”, capable of regulating different
  types of motile responses in a context-dependent manner.
