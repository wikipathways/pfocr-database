caption: The sulfur assimilation pathway. Shown is a schematic representation of the
  sulfur assimilation pathway and its connection to reactions catalyzed by the enzyme
  CysG. The enzyme complex CysIJ requires a 4Fe-4S cluster and the cofactor siroheme.
  Gene products catalyzing various reactions are indicated by the relevant arrows.
