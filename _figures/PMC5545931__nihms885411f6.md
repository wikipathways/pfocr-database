caption: (A) In the canonical pathway, a stable scaffolding complex containing β1
  integrin, RACK1, and IGF-1R activates the FAK-Tyr925/GRB2/ERK pathway, leading to
  tumor cell proliferation, growth, and migration. (B) In WT cells, PSMA expression
  disrupts two pathways, both of which contribute to activation of the more aggressive,
  protumor PI3K-AKT pathway. PSMA physically associates with IGF-1R and RACK1, consistent
  with PSMA disrupting the scaffolding complex, which leads to FAK-Tyr397 hyperphosphorylation
  (“a”), and PSMA expression reverses the phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr925, which is
  required for FAK/GRB2 interactions, thus inactivating ERK signal transduction (“b”).
  (C) Bypassing PSMA interference by directly activating FAK-Tyr925 with extracellular
  matrix (ECM) rescues activation of FAK-Tyr925 and the GRB2/ERK signaling pathway.
  (D) The absence of PSMA allows stable IGF-1R/RACK1/β1 integrin complex formation
  and activation of the FAK-GRB2-ERK canonical pathway, producing less aggressive
  tumors.
