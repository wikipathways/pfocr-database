caption: 'Representation of selected metabolic pathways induced in –P-stressed nodules.
  Drawings are based on PathExpress outputs (; ) and contain two types of nodes: metabolites
  represented by ellipses, and enzymes (boxes) labeled with the enzyme name or abbreviation
  and/or the EC number. Enzymes coded by genes included in the PhvGI are shown. The
  color code indicates the induced gene expression of enzymes (; Supplemental Table
  S1) or increased metabolite pools (; green) or respective decrease (red). Other
  metabolites shown in each pathway (white ellipses) were not detected in our analysis.
  A, Glycerolipid metabolism. ADH, Alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  MAGL, monoglyceride lipase. B, Glycolysis-gluconeogenesis-carbon fixation. ENO,
  Enolase 2; FBPA, Fru-bisphosphate aldolase; G3PD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; 3-PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; TPI, triosephosphate
  isomerase. C, Phe metabolism. CA4H, trans-Cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; MPO, myeloperoxidase;
  PAL, Phe ammonia lyase.'
