caption: Model for the integration of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway with Mef2-dependent
  recruitment of the Ash2L complex to muscle-specific promoters. Before activation
  of p38, MyoD and E47 (MD/E) cooperate with Mef 2d dimers (homo- or heterodimers)
  to establish a transcriptionally poised promoter through recruitment of the acetyltransferase
  p300 and Pol II. This leads to acetylation of nucleosomes on histone H4 within the
  promoter. As differentiation proceeds, cell-cell contact activates the membrane-bound
  receptor Cdo, leading to p38 MAPK activation via the scaffold protein JLP and the
  MKK6 kinase. Once activated, p38 MAPK phosphorylates Mef 2d, leading to targeting
  of the Ash2L methyltransferase complex to muscle-specific promoters. The methyltransferase
  complex then establishes the epigenetic H3K4me3 mark required for abundant expression
  of developmentally regulated genes.
