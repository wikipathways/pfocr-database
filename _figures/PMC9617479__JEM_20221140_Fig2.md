caption: Comparison of cellular metabolism and regulators in NK cells and CD8+T cells.
  Glycolysis and mTOR signaling are key to CD8+ cytotoxic T cell polarization and
  NK cell activation. The transcription factor Myc is regulated by mTOR signaling
  and plays an important role in both CD8+ T cells and NK cells. In CD8+ T cells,
  Myc controls glutaminolysis and links glutaminolysis with biosynthetic pathways,
  while in NK cells, the expression of Myc in murine NK cells is regulated by glutamine
  availability instead of glutaminolysis. Different from anaplerosis, in NK cells,
  glutamine does not supply TCA cycle and glutaminolysis does not sustain OXPHOS.
  In addition, NK cells and CD8+ T cells differ in their utilization of pyruvate.
  Pyruvate produced by glycolysis in NK cells directs metabolism into the CMS rather
  than the TCA cycle. SREBP expression in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells promotes lipid homeostasis
  during cellular expansion and enhances their glycolytic metabolism. In contrast,
  in NK cells, SREBP promotes CMS to control the level of glycolysis and OXPHOS. Thus,
  SREBP is now considered to be an important metabolic regulator of the glycolysis
  pathway in NK cells independent of its traditional role in lipid synthesis. ACAT1,
  a key cholesterol esterification enzyme, is essential for TCR engagement of CD8+
  cytotoxic T cells, but whether ACAT1 plays a role in NK cell function remains unknown.
  PPARs, master regulators of lipid metabolism, play multiple roles in CD8+ T cell
  and NK cell metabolism. PPARs agonist could induce FAO in CD8+ T cells which enhances
  anti-tumor immunity and facilitates anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. In contrast, in obesity,
  PPAR-α/δ agonists leads to lipid accumulation in NK cells, impairing mTOR signaling,
  NK cell metabolism, and function. However, reduced NK cell function in B lymphoma
  caused by increased lipid metabolism could be partially restored by activating PPAR-γ.
  Furthermore, etomoxir (an inhibitor of FAO, blocking carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1, CPT I) does not affect ATP production in activated NK cells indicating that OXPHOS
  may not be predominantly fuelled by FAO ().
