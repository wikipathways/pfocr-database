caption: Putative scheme of signal transduction in thyreocyte according to Riesco-Eizaguirre
  and Santisteban and Rivas and Santisteban [, ]. TSH-stimulated 18F-FDG uptake is
  mediated via adenylate cyclase (AC) and cAMP, ras, PI3K, and Akt. Iodide uptake
  is regulated by PKA. Mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase pathway involving B-type
  Raf (BRAF), extracellular signal–regulated kinase, and mitogenactivated protein
  kinase kinase is supposed to steer cell proliferation. The Gly12Ser point mutation
  of K-ras oncogene as detected in ML-1 cells results in constitutive activation of
  K-ras-PI3K-Akt pathway in this cell line, leading to enhanced glucose transport
  and use
