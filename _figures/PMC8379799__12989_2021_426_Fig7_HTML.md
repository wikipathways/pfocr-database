caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular mechanism underlying of biomass combustion
  soluble constituent (BCSC)-induced cytotoxicity in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial
  cells (HPAEpiC). The p53 signaling pathway was activated after HPAEpiC exposure
  to BCSCs, significantly enhancing the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and
  cleaved caspase-3, and inhibiting Bcl-2 expression
