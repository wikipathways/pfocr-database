caption: Classic Wnt/β-catenin pathway cascade diagram. The figure on the left shows
  the deactivation of the Wnt pathway. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin
  in the cytoplasm is recognized, folded, and phosphorylated by a destructive complex
  composed of scaffold proteins Axin, APC, GSK3β, and CK1, and targeted for degradation
  by a β-TRCP-mediated proteomic mechanism. The figure on the right shows activation
  of the Wnt pathway. The signal induces double phosphorylation of LRP6 by CK1 and
  GSK3-β via the Fizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor complex, which allows the
  axon-containing protein complex to transfer from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane.
  Dsh is also recruited to the cell membrane and binds to Fizzied, and Axin binds
  to phosphorylated LRP5/6. The complex forms on the Fizzled/LRP5/6 membrane and induces
  stabilization of β-catenin by separating and/or degrading axons. β-catenin, which
  accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus and, together with the
  transcription factor TCF, drives the expression of downstream target genes
