caption: Acute opioid binding to the μ-opioid receptor inhibits the downstream cAMP
  (A), which recovers with chronic opioid use and further increases in withdrawal,
  leading to excess NE discharge from the noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus
  (B). Therefore, treatment of withdrawal involves either attenuating the cAMP pathway
  through μ-opioid receptor agonism (A) or inhibiting excess NE discharge from locus
  coeruleus neurons through presynaptic α2-receptor agonism. ATP=adenosine triphosphate.
  cAMP=cyclic adenosine monophosphate. PKA=protein kinase A. NE=norepinephrine. *Not
  approved by the US Food and Drug Administration yet.
