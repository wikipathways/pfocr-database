caption: Upon ligation and clustering by LDL, syndecan-1, -2 and -4 become enriched
  in detergent-resistant membranes and mediate the internalization of ligand via a
  non-clathrin endocytic route [,]. Syndecan-1 overexpression can restore apoE-VLDL
  uptake in human fibroblastic cells that possess no LDL receptor activity by non-clathrin,
  but raft-dependent process []. Syndecan-4 mediates FGF2 endocytosis in endothelial
  cells in a non-clathrin dependent way initiated by syndecan-4 clustering. This process
  is inhibited by cholesterol depletion, but not by dominant-negative dynamins. It
  resembles macropinocytosis as it is accelerated by active Rac, consistent with a
  need for actin membrane protrusions, blocked by dominant-negative Rac and by amiloride
  that blocks Na+/H+ exchange required for macropinocytosis [,]. Interestingly, syndecan-1
  and -2 might have different kinetics of internalization and have differential effects
  on post-endocytic gene delivery mediated by polyethyleneimines []. Recent studies
  corroborate a role for HSPGs in raft-dependent, non-clathrin macropinocytic uptake.
  Although they lack crucial controls with syndecan-specific siRNA and thereby potentially
  also reflect the biology of other HSPGs i.e. glypicans, one can nevertheless reasonably
  assume these studies are relevant for syndecans. (1) Arginine-rich peptides, including
  the R8 and HIV-1 Tat peptides, require cell surface HSPGs and Rac activation for
  their macropinocytic uptake []. (2) DNA uptake relies on HSPGs, lipid rafts and
  macropinocytosis but is independent of clathrin, dynamin and caveolin-1 []. (3)
  Eosinophil cationic protein is internalized by macropinosomes, uses HSPGs as major
  receptor and trafficks along a detergent resistant compartment in a clathrin- and
  caveolin-independent manner. This endocytic route is regulated by Rac and ARF6 and
  requires cholesterol and PI3kinase activity []. (4) The internalization of Herpes
  Simplex virus protein 22 depends on HSPGs through a lipid raft, actin and ARF6 endocytic
  pathway, independent of clathrin and caveolin. Yet this pathway appears different
  from the above mentioned by two criteria. It is independent of Rac and dependent
  on dynamin []. (5) Dependence on dynamin was also observed in another study with
  other HSPG ligands, including HSPG antibodies []. Yet these internalizations were
  invariably clathrin- and caveolin-independent. Moreover these HSPGs endosomes are
  decorated with flotillin-1 and can be inhibited by siRNA against this protein. The
  further fate of HSPGs-endosomes is less clear. Evidence suggests progression to
  late endosomes [] and lysosomes unless recycling can take place in a syntenin-dependent
  manner [].
