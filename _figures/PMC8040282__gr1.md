caption: 'Schematic illustration of de novo reconstitution of prenylnaringenin biosynthetic
  pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This approach includes two important
  strategic aspects: a naringenin biosynthesis platform (surrounded by the dashed
  line) and a prenyltransferase (PT) module for catalyzing the prenylation of the
  naringenin product. In the naringenin biosynthesis platform, six enzymes serve to
  produce naringenin from ʟ-phenylalanine through five metabolic reaction steps. Synthesized
  naringenin then is prenylated by PTs of varying specificities, which catalyze this
  key step of prenylnaringenin biosynthesis. The botanical naringenin 8-prenyltransferase
  (SfN8DT-1) and promiscuous microbial (actinomycete and fungal) PTs are used for
  prenylation of naringenin. Structures of known prenylnaringenins isolated from plants
  are presented, and include 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), 3′-prenylnaringenin (3′-PN),
  and 6-prenylnaringenin (6-PN). PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, trans-cinnamate
  4-monooxygenase (a cytochrome P450 enzyme); CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; 4CL,
  4-coumaric acid-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase.'
