caption: Signaling pathways activated by mito-DAMPs. Upon mitochondrial damage, mito-DAMPs
  such as mtDNA, mtRNA, cardiolipin or ATP are able to stimulate cellular inflammatory
  pathways. Mitochondrial nucleic acids (mtDNA and mtRNA) are released into the cytoplasm,
  where they activate several cytosolic immune sensors. Cytosolic mtRNA is detected
  by Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I), which activates Mitochondrial Antiviral-Signaling
  protein (MAVS), leading to the activation of Interferon Regulatory Factors 3 and
  7 (IRF3 and IRF7) and the subsequent induction of a type I interferon (IFN) response.
  Cytosolic mtDNA activates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which catalyzes the production
  of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds to and activates the STING pathway, leading
  to the transcription of IFN and inflammatory genes via NF-κB. mtDNA can also be
  recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment.
  Upon binding to hypomethylated CpG-DNA, TLR9 triggers downstream signaling cascades
  involving MyD88, ultimately leading to the expression of inflammatory genes. Oxidized
  mtDNA or cardiolipin can also activate NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, leading to
  the recruitment and activation of caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, which are then secreted, promoting an immune
  response. ATP through P2X7R is also a potent activator of NLRP3 inflammasome
