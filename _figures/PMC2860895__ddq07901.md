caption: 'TOM1L2 and genes associated with Alzheimer''s disease in the human interactome.
  A human network of functional coupling was built by probabilistic integration of
  different data sets in human and six model eukaryotic species () and is available
  via web network browser at http://funcoup.sbc.su.se (web page http://funcoup.sbc.su.se/algo.html#noislets
  also describes algorithm 1 employed to retrieve this sub-network). Shapes: diamonds
  to the top left, the four genes previously associated with Alzheimer''s disease
  and TOM1L2 is in the center of the figure; square, group of histones (collapsed
  into single node) that connect presenilins and TOM1L2; triangles, genes assigned
  to a pathway in the KEGG database; circles, other genes. Lines: Evidence of functional
  coupling between genes with protein–protein interactions and mRNA co-expression.'
