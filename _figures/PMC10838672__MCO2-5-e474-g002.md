caption: Schematic diagram of Smo‐driven canonical Hh signaling pathway and targeted
  inhibitors. Hh signaling is controlled by the Ptch and Smo. In the absence of Hh
  and Ptch, activation of Smo leads to the activation of Hh target genes. Dhh, Desert
  Hedgehog; Gli, glioma related oncogene homology transcription factors; Hh, hedgehog;
  HhN, amino‐terminal “Hedge” domain; Ihh, Indian Hedgehog; Kif7, kinesin family member
  protein 7; Ptch, Patched; Smo, Smoothened; Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; SuFu, suppressor
  of fused homolog
