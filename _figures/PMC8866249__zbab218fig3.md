caption: Working model for the host defense against Cutibacterium acnes SK137 via
  TIR-1-p38 MAPK pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans. This study suggested that host
  defense against C. acnes SK137 requires the TIR-1/SARM1 and p38 MAPK cascade. Genes
  encoding antimicrobial molecules including nlp-34, clec-172, clec-180, ilys-2, and
  lys-10 are upregulated by infection with SK137 in a TIR-1-dependent manner. The
  TIR-1-associated receptor(s) that could perceive C. acnes and the transcription
  factor(s) that are regulated by PMK-1 to induce antimicrobial factors remain unidentified.
  Inductive pathways are shown as arrows.
