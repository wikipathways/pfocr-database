caption: Schematic of the epigenetic and transcriptional regulators that function
  downstream of TORC1 to regulate ribosomal gene transcription. Shared transcriptional
  coregulators that may function to coordinate Pol I and Pol II transcription in response
  to TORC1 signaling are listed next to the red arrow. How Pol III dependent rRNA
  transcription is integrated into a coordinated, holistic model for nutrient-regulated
  ribosomal transcription remains known. Only those transcriptional and epigenetic
  regulators discussed in the text are represented in this schematic.
