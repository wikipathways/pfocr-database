caption: 'The resveratrol-targeted genes related part of the top three KEGG pathways.
  (A) Prostate cancer pathway: (1) PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and (2) p53 signaling
  pathway are involved in the process, resulting in impaired G1/G2 arrest, reduced
  apoptosis, genomic instability, cell proliferation, survival, tumor growth, cell
  cycle progression, apoptosis inhibitions. (B) Pathways in cancer: (1) PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway and (3) mTOR signaling pathway are involved in the process, resulting in
  evading apoptosis and proliferation. (C) Glioma pathway: (2) p53 signaling pathway
  and (3) mTOR pathway are involved in the process, resulting in cell survival, G1/S
  progression, uncontrolled proliferation, increased survival, and genomic instability.'
