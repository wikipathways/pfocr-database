caption: Key molecular alterations and signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis
  and progression of gastric cancer, along with selected targeted therapies (adapted
  from Lei et al.8). Many biomarkers have been associated with gastric cancer, such
  as molecules in growth factors pathways and immune checkpoint control modulators.
  Growth factor receptors (e.g., HER2, MET, and FGFR2) typically activate essential
  downstream pathways through dimerization and tyrosine kinase signaling. The downstream
  pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, and JAK/STAT/IRF, mediate essential
  cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, differentiation and survival,
  and participate in the tumorigenesis and progression of many cancer types. DKK1
  regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is also an essential pathway
  involved in cell proliferation, migration, and death. PD-L1 binds to PD-1 and suppresses
  T-cell receptor signaling, and this mechanism is commonly hijacked by cancer cells
  to escape immune recognition. On a related note, dysregulated expression of the
  MMR genes can impair cellular repair function during DNA replication, resulting
  in the MSI-H/dMMR phenotype. This phenotype contributes to gastric cancer through
  different mechanisms, including an upregulated PD-L1 expression. Likewise, EBV is
  associated with different oncogenic effects and it is known to increase PD-L1 expression
  through the JAK/STAT/IRF pathway. B7-H3 and VISTA are also immune checkpoint proteins
  and have been associated with immune invasion in gastric cancer. Another notable
  biomarker is CLDN18.2, a tight junction protein commonly expressed in differentiated
  gastric mucosa cells. CLDN18.2 may become more exposed when tight junctions are
  disrupted upon malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells. In terms of
  biomarker-guided treatments for gastric cancer, trastuzumab and trastuzumab deruxtecan
  are recommended for patients with HER2-positivity. PD-L1-positivity and MSI-H/dMMR
  can guide the use of immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab. Zolbetuximab has been
  approved for patients with CLDN18.2-positive disease in some countries. More targeted
  therapies, including savolitinib for MET-positive patients, are currently under
  clinical investigation. AKT, protein kinase B; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
