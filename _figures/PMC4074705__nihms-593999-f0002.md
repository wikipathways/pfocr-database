caption: ER–PM membrane contact sites regulate calcium (Ca2+) dynamics. Associations

  © Rockefeller University Press, 1957. Originally published in J Biophys Biochem
  Cytol, 3:269-300. Large invaginations of the sarcolemma (the PM), termed transverse
  tubules (T-tubules), were found to be closely associated with membranes of the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR, the ER in muscle cells). These structures were termed triads (a T-tubule
  closely apposed by two terminal SR compartments) and were later shown to be involved
  in Ca2+-mediated and cytoskeletal-mediated muscle contraction, known as excitation–coupled
  contraction. (b) Molecular components responsible for excitation-coupled contraction
  have been identified. At ER–PM contacts, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) localized
  in T-tubules interact with and activate ryanodine receptors (RyR) in the ER [].
  Upon activation, the RyR releases Ca2+ stores from the ER lumen to generate Ca2+
  signals in the cytoplasm necessary for cytoskeletal-mediated muscle cell contraction.
  The protein junctophilin (JP) is involved in ER–PM contact formation in muscle cells
  []. Junctophilin is an integral ER membrane protein with several cytoplasmic MORN
  repeats proposed to bind PIP lipids in the PM. (c) Following release, luminal ER
  Ca2+ stores must be replenished for normal ER function (e.g. lipid synthesis, protein
  folding and secretion). In many cell types, the STIM proteins function in the store-operated
  Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER lumen []. The ER-localized
  STIM protein senses Ca2+ levels in the ER lumen via a Ca2+-binding EF hand domain.
  Upon depletion of Ca2+ in the ER lumen, STIM proteins oligomerize via cytoplasmic
  coiled-coil domains (CC) and translocate to ER–PM contact sites. A polybasic region
  rich in lysine residues (K) within the cytoplasmic tail of STIM binds to PIP lipids
  in the PM. The STIM proteins subsequently interact with and recruit PM-localized
  Orai1 Ca2+ channels (also known as Ca2+ release-activated channels, CRAC) to ER–PM
  junctions. The CRAC-activation domain (CAD) within the STIM proteins directly binds
  and activates Orai1 channels, resulting in Ca2+ influx necessary for cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ signals and for reloading Ca2+ stores into the ER lumen through SERCA (smooth
  ER Ca2+ ATPase) transporters.
