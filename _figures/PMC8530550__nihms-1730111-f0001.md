caption: '(A) T-cell’s cognate TCR-pMHC axis: (1) Human primary T cells engage with
  their cognate antigen peptides, exposed on antigen-presenting cells (APC) via TCR-decorated
  microvilli,. The antigen-engaged microvilli secure early cognate T-cell-APC interactions
  and facilitate the formation of the mature immune synapse. (2) TCR-pMHC interactions
  within the IS form a 13 nm-long molecular axis between APC and T-cell surfaces.
  (3) T-cell cytoskeletal centripetal flow and actomyosin contractility within the
  IS exert shear stresses onto the TCR that results in the mechanical 3D force momentum
  (torque) and bending of the TCR-pMHC axis. 3D force momentum (torque), along with
  the shear and possibly other forces, facilitate the mechanosensory activation of
  the TCR downstream signaling via the Nck-Lck-Zap70 pathway. Note that the interaction
  energy between T-cell and antigen is modulated by the „catch-bond’ mechanism within
  the TCR-pMHC axis in addition to TCR downstream mechanosensing signaling. (B) CD3ε
  TCR complex subunit is a relay for the mechanical forces from the extracellular
  TCR-pMHC axis to the intracellular TCR signaling apparatus. Bypassing the „catch-bond’-modulated
  variability within the TCR-pMHC axis via the CD3ε subunit targeted by the OKT3 mAb
  allows for standardized studying of the TCR’s downstream torque mechanosensing.
  Note the introduction of the additional controlling module as the bundled dsDNA
  between the elastic polyacrylamide gel surface and the TCR complex.'
