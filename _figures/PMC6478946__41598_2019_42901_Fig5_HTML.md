caption: Schematic of Scenario D– The ‘entwined pathway’ approach of repair choice.
  Positions 1–6 represent steps along the DNA DSB repair pathway. (1) Radiation induces
  DSB damage. (2) Due to its high abundance and affinity for DNA ends, on average
  Ku provides the first response to the DSB. (3) DNA-PKcs can attach in a Ku-dependent
  manner and/or MRN can co-localise with Ku/DNA-PKcs. (4.1) Either the DNA-PK synapsis
  can be stabilised allowing for NHEJ repair to follow or the DNA-PK complex can dissociate
  through either autophosphorylation or RNF138 ubiquitylation. (4.2) Either NHEJ can
  be attempted again by the recruitment of Ku and then DNA-PKcs, or steps can be taken
  towards resected-mediated repair. (5) RNF138 is recruited in an MRN dependent manner.
  (6) RNF138 prohibits Ku attachment providing enough time for CtIP resection to take
  place and HR repair to follow. As the repair model is Monte Carlo-based, with various
  progression points at each step, the above is one possible repair route available
  in the entwined pathway model. However, this route has been demonstrated to be important
  for matching protein recruitment kinetics (Fig. ) and highlights an NHEJ and HR
  symbiotic relationship.
