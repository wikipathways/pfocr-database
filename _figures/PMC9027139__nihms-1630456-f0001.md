caption: 'Schematic illustrating the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and protein
  O-GlcNAc turnover. Following its entry into the cell glucose is metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate,
  which is the branch point between the HBP and glycolysis. L-Glutamine: D-fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT), which regulates glucose entry into the HBP, converts fructose-6-phosphate
  to glucosamine-6-phosphate. Subsequent metabolism by glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  (Emeg32), Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (Agm1) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase
  (Uap1) leads to the synthesis of uridine-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).
  UDP-GlcNAc is the obligate sugar donor for (O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) which catalyzes
  the formation of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-modification on ser/thr
  residues of proteins. The removal of O-GlcNAc from the proteins is catalyzed by
  β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) resulting in unmodified proteins and free GlcNAc,
  which can re-enter the HBP following its phosphorylation to GlcNAc-6-Phosphate by
  N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK). There is also a multi-step process where GalNAc
  is metabolized to UDP-GalNAc before subsequent conversion to UDP-GlcNAc by an epimerase.'
