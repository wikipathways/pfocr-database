caption: Targets for lithium’s neuroprotective effects. Targets shown in orange are
  mainly pro-apoptotic proteins/receptors; lithium either significantly downregulates
  these proteins or decreases their expression. Anti-apoptotic proteins are showed
  in blue. Lithium increases their expression and/or levels, thus inducing neuroprotective
  and neurotrophic effects. Activation of brain neurotransmitter-coupled G-proteins
  induces PLC hydrolysis of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG (not shown), which activates PKC.
  IP3 binds to the IP3R, thus inducing the release of ER calcium stores. Increased
  intracellular calcium levels have been described in bipolar disorder and may increase
  the risk of apoptosis. The neuroprotective protein Bcl-2 downregulates ER calcium
  release through an IP3R-dependent mechanism. The same effect is induced by lithium
  treatment, which also increases Bcl-2 levels. IP3 is recycled by IMPase, another
  of lithium’s targets. Cellular signaling through Wnt glycoproteins and frizzled
  receptors result in GSK-3β inhibition, a critical cellular target and effector for
  diverse proteins. Inhibition of GSK-3β prevents β-catenin phosphorylation and stimulates
  its translocation to the nucleus, thus targeting transcription of specific genes
  activating neurotrophic effects and synaptogenesis. Activation of the BDNF receptor
  (Trk-B) activates the ERK/MAPK pathway, which inhibits GSK-3β and BAD. Activation
  of the ERK/MAPK pathway by BDNF increases the expression of nuclear CREB, which
  facilitates the expression of neurotrophic/neuroprotective proteins such as Bcl-2
  and BDNF. BDNF also activates the PI3K pathway, which indirectly inhibits GSK-3β
  and BAD. Mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl also inhibit pro-apoptotic activation of
  BAD, as well as consequent mitochondrial increase of calcium influx and cytochrome
  C release. Bcl-2 = B-cell lymphoma-2; BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  Ca2+ = calcium; CREB = cAMP response element binding protein; Cyt C = cytochrome
  C; DAG = diacylglycerol; ER = endoplasmic reticulum; ERK = extracellular regulated
  kinase; GSK = glycogen-synthase kinase; IMPase = inositol monophosphatase; IP3 =
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3; IP3R = inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3 receptor; Mg2+
  = magnesium; MAPK = mitogen activated protein kinase; NMDA = N-methyl D-aspartate;

  4,5-biphosphate; PKC = protein kinase C; PLC = phospholipase C; PTP = permeability
  membrane pore; TrkB = tyrosine receptor kinase B.
