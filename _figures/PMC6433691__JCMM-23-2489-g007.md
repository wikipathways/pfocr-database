caption: The model of JS‐K‐induced anti‐tumour activity in gastric cancer. As a lead
  anti‐cancer drug compound, JS‐K significantly suppressed the expression of the core
  proteins of mitochondria respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and IV, resulting in
  the reduction of MRC complex I and IV activity and the subsequent reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production. In addition, JS‐K down‐regulated SOD1 and catalase, which
  facilitated the reduction of SOD1 and catalase reducing activity and promoted the
  inhibition of ROS clearance. The aberrant ROS then induces mitochondria depolarization,
  caspase signalling pathway activation and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Therefore,
  MRC complex I and IV or antioxidant enzymes act as novel targets for JS‐K in mediating
  ROS‐dependent anti‐cancer activity in gastric cancer
