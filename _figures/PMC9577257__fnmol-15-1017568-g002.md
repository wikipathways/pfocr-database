caption: Overview of WNT signaling pathways. In the ON state of the canonical pathway,
  the binding of WNT to frizzled (FZD) receptor and LRP on the plasma membrane results
  in activation of DVL protein in the form of polymerization. When polymerized, DVL
  adaptor proteins inhibit the destruction complex (Axin, GSK-3β, APC, and CKIα) function,
  leading to unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. In
  the nucleus, β-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator to TCF/LEF factors
  that, in turn, activate the transcription of WNT target genes. In the OFF state,
  there is no WNT ligand binding and no DVL polymerization and β-catenin undergoes
  phosphorylation by components of the destruction complex. This phosphorylation triggers
  ubiquitylation of β-catenin and its consequent proteasomal degradation. In WNT/PCP,
  the binding of WNT ligand to FZD receptor and the receptor tyrosine kinase-like
  orphan receptor (ROR) on the plasma membrane recruits and activates DVL protein.
  This binding initiates a cascade of signals via Rho or Rac GTPases to promote polarized
  cellular behaviors or promote cell survival by activating the transcription of AP1
  target genes. The binding of the WNT ligand to the FZD receptor and ROR also activates
  the WNT/Ca2+signaling by G-protein-dependent release of Ca2+. The increase of intracellular
  calcium activates PKC and CAMKII. Increased Ca2+ can also activate calcineurin,
  leading to the accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the
  nucleus and promoting transcription of target genes.
