caption: Angiopoietin signaling pathway. When Ang1 binds to Tie2, Tie2 auto-phosphorylates.
  Tie2 receptors regulate downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK)/ERK
  (also known as Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK), Survivin, and eNOS, and inhibits Caspase-9 and
  Bad, among others. These pathways are involved in reducing angiogenesis and vascular
  permeability, favoring vascular stability. Following Tie2 activation, FOXO-1 is
  phosphorylated and inactivated, thereby, promoting endothelial cell quiescence,
  survival, and vascular stability. In addition, the phosphorylation of Tie2 also
  prevents NF-κB signaling activation. In activated endothelial cells, Ang2 is released
  from endothelial Weibel–Palade bodies. It will antagonize Ang1–Tie2 signaling and
  inhibit Tie-2 phosphorylation, leading to vascular instability, vascular leakage,
  inflammation, etc., thereby promoting angiogenesis. Under these conditions, the
  FOXO-1 transcription factor is activated and promotes the transcription of Ang2
  mRNA, further promoting vascular destabilization. Ang, Angiopoietin; and WPB, Weibel–Palade
  bodies.
