caption: The classical biosynthetic pathway from campesterol to brassinolide showing
  known mutants in Arabidopsis that block the conversion of intermediates at the steps
  indicated, or prevent BR perception and/or signal transduction. The pathway on the
  left is termed Early C-6 Oxidation and that on the right, Late C-6 Oxidation. BR-6-Oxidase
  has been shown to convert 6-Deoxocastasterone and 6-Deoxotyphasterol to the corresponding
  6-oxo compounds in Arabidopsis, while the conversion of 3-Dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone
  and 6-Deoxoteasterone has been demonstrated so far in recombinant yeast cells only.
  As discussed in the text, several revisions and alterations in the classical pathway
  have occurred over the past several years that have shortened the route from campesterol
  to brassinolide. Furthermore, biochemical evidence suggests CPD is unlikely to be
  a C-23 hydroxylase.
