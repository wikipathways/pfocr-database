caption: pMMR CRC are characterized by an immune-excluded and immune-suppressive tumor
  microenvironment (TME), leading to resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
  In fact, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  are located outside of tumor core and inner invasive margin, reducing their direct
  contact with tumor cells. Inside tumor core, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Treg) lead to suppression
  of immune response against cancer cells. Moreover, pMMR CRC detains low levels of
  neoantigens, impairing their presentation to CD8+ T cells. In this immune-excluded
  and immune-suppressive TME, chemotherapy, inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD),
  promotes exposure on tumor cell surface of calreticulin, able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis
  and increased TILs inside TME, and of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90, able to
  bind CD40 on dendritic cells (DCs) and activating them. Moreover, ICD promotes the
  release from tumor cells of HMGB1 that could bind TLR4 on DCs surface and promote
  their activation. Radiotherapy leads to increased neoantigen presentation and release
  from tumor cells and increased expression of PD-L1. Anti-angiogenesis drugs, such
  as bevacizumab, and other multikinase inhibitors (MKI), such as regorafenib, are
  able to inhibit the immuno-suppressive effect of VEGF/VEGFR on TME, blocking the
  infiltration of MDSCs, TAMs, and Treg inside TME and the expression of T cell exhaustion
  markers (PD-1, LAG3, TIM3). Anti-EGFR drugs, inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity (ADCC), lead to cancer cells lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. Finally,
  alterations of MAPK pathway on cancer cells promote migration of suppressive immune
  cells inside TME and reduce TILs infiltration; therefore, drugs that target this
  axis might restore antitumor immune cell activity.
