caption: In the vernalization pathway, AGL19 acts as an activator of the FM identity
  genes (LFY and AP1), while both MAF2 and FLC repress SOC1 expression; VIN3 and VRN1
  shut down FLC transcription by methylating the histones of the FLC-associated chromatin.
  For the photoperiod pathway, CRY2, as a receptor of blue light, represses COP1,
  which is the E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinating CO. CO acts as a key activator of
  FT and SOC1, which play vital roles in integrating multiple flowering signals. SPA1
  and SPA3 bind to COP1 and regulate CO protein levels. CDF1 acts as a suppressor
  of CO transcription. FKF1 represses CDF1 expression together with GI, and promotes
  CO expression. MSI1 acts upstream of the CO-FT pathway to enable an efficient photoperiodic
  response. FT protein (blue font), as a florigen transferred from leaf to shoot apex
  (blue dotted arrow), interacts with the FD protein at the shoot apex and activates
  downstream targets, such as SOC1 and AP1. In addition, autonomous, GA and aging
  pathways probably participated in the early flowering of line APL01 (pathways indicated
  in dark gray). Genes indicated in red are up-regulated, while genes indicated in
  green are down-regulated in shoot apical meristems or leaves of line APL01 compared
  with those of line PL01. Genes in black are not significantly changed between two
  lines, genes indicated in blue represent protein. Arrows represent the promotion
  or gene activation, and blunted lines represent gene repression. The detailed gene
  functions are described in .
