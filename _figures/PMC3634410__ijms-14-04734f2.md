caption: 'Low oxygen sensing mechanisms in plants are mediated by the N-end rule pathway
  and ROS. Group VII ERF transcription factors bear a conserved Met-Cys N-degron that,
  under normoxia, targets them to constitutive proteasomal degradation, through a
  branch of the N-end rule pathway that relies on the production of oxydized cysteine
  (*Cys) as an intermediate. Oxygen limiting conditions lead, instead, to stabilization
  of the Met-Cys N-degron, thereby allowing ERFVII to migrate into the nucleus and
  activate transcription of low oxygen-responsive genes. Low oxygen responses under
  anoxia also depend on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers
  the accumulation of ROS-responsive transcription factors and may regulate cysteine-containing
  enzymes, contributing to the activation of MPKs. This triggers a signaling cascade
  leading to enhanced plant tolerance. Abbreviations: MetAPs, Met-aminopeptidases;
  ATE1/2, Arg-tRNA transferase 1/2; PRT6, Proteolysis 6; poly-Ub, poly-ubiquitin chain;
  MPKs, MAP kinases.'
