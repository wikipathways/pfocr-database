caption: 'Parthenolide promotes axon growth by counteracting PI3K/AKT-mediated tubulin
  detyrosination.Hyper-IL-6 or genetic depletion of PTEN (PTEN ko) activate the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway and promote axon regeneration. Additionally, PI3K/AKT acts on
  microtubules (MT) in growth cones and negatively affects MT dynamics, which decelerates
  axon elongation. This effect can be reversed by parthenolide or its water-soluble
  prodrug DMAPT. AKT-mediated GSK3 inhibition has different effects on MTs. The increase
  of CRMP2 activity promotes MT polymerization and axon growth. On the other hand,
  the decrease of MAP1B activity enhances tubulin detyrosination (enzymatic removal
  of C-terminal tyrosine from α-tubulin subunit) and reduces MT dynamics. Parthenolide
  can inhibit detyrosination independently of MAP1B, reversing this limitation of
  PI3K/AKT-mediated axon growth. Created with Microsoft PowerPoint. CRMP2: Collapsin
  response mediator protein 2; DMAPT: dimethylamino parthenolide; GSK3: glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; hIL-6: hyper-IL-6; MAP1B: microtubule associated protein 1B; MT: microtubules;
  PI3K/AKT: PI3 kinase/protein kinase B; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog'
