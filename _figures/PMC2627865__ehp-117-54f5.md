caption: 'Mechanistic model for particle-related proinflammatory response that is
  consistent with our in vivo and in vitro data for CDNPs. The inflammatory signaling
  cascade is activated by oxidative stress due to the combined effects of the particles’
  innate surface reactivity (measured as OxPot; pathway 1) and the presence of bioavailable
  organic compounds (Cyp1a1 induction; pathway 2), which are eliminated via a three-phase
  detoxification process. Abbreviations: H, high; L, low; PM, particulate matter.'
