caption: Common regulatory networks to control the VIN3-FLC-FT pathway to control
  flowering time by vernalization. Common repression and activation complexes are
  likely involved in regulations of VIN3, FLC and FT. Bivalent chromatin status at
  VIN3 chromatin is achieved by vernalizing cold, resulting in transient induction
  of VIN3.
