caption: 'AMPK is phosphorylated by LKB1 and CaMKKβ, and in turn activates PGC1α.
  Four possible mechanisms through which SIRT3 might impact this pathway are depicted
  here: (1) by deacetylating and activating LKB1, (2) by deacetylating and activating
  FOXO3A, a transcriptional activator of PGC1α, (3) by increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio,
  allowing for increased sirtuin activity which could function to activate AMPK and/or
  PGC1α through deacetylation, or (4) by promoting increased cytosolic calcium levels,
  thus promoting AMPK activity through CaMKKβ and PGC1α expression through CaMKIV.'
