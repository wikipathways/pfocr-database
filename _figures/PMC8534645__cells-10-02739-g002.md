caption: Scheme of connection between sirtuins, HIV and hepatic metabolism. SIRT3
  deacetylates GSK-3β, increasing its activity, which in turn weakens TGF-β signaling.
  SIRT6, through down-regulation of TGF-β signaling reduces the expression of profibrogenic
  genes. SIRT1 up-regulates fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes via the FOXO1/PPARα
  signaling pathway. Viral protein Vpr acts opposite to SIRT1 to increase expression
  of genes responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids by increasing SREBP1c activity.
  SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c; FOXO1, forkhead box protein
  O1; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; TGFβ, transforming growth
  factor β; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.
