caption: Schematic representation of the recombination salvage pathway regulation.
  (A) Lesions or perturbations in the DNA (red star) cause fork arrest. The model
  presented here can take place at the stalled replication fork or, as shown, at ssDNA
  gaps left behind by arrested replication followed by restart downstream. Events
  can occur during DNA replication (S phase) or after the bulk of the replication
  has been completed (G2 phase). ssDNA will be immediately covered by RPA and Rad51.
  (B) During normal DNA replication, Srs2 binds to both SUMOylated lysines of PCNA.
  It inhibits the activity of Rad52 and evicts Rad51, thus precluding homologous recombination
  events. PCNA ubiquitylation will lead to damage bypass by translesion synthesis
  (TLS) or by template switch (TS). The choice between these two subpathways may depend
  on the nature and amount of accumulated DNA damage. (C) When lysine 164 of PCNA
  is mutated, Srs2 is still recruited by K127 SUMOylation. Srs2 inhibits the activity
  of Rad52 and Rad51, and since PCNA cannot be ubiquitylated, no DDT subpathway is
  available. The cells are thus extremely sensitive to DNA damage. (D) When Srs2 is
  deleted, or both lysines of PCNA that participate in Srs2 recruitment are mutated
  (pol30-RR), the salvage recombination is driven by Rad52 and Rad51. This requires
  unloading of PCNA by the Elg1 RFC-like complex (although some level of leakage exists).
  (E) In an Δelg1 pol30-RR strain, no TS or TLS recruitment is possible (as PCNA cannot
  become modified), and Srs2 is not recruited; however, the SR pathway cannot proceed
  because PCNA cannot be efficiently unloaded. As a consequence, the cells are sensitive
  to DNA damage.
