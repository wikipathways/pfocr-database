caption: Interplay between NMDA and TrkB receptors mediated by ALA-induced lipid rafts
  in neuronal plasma membranes. An increase in the nutraceutical ALA is hypothesized
  to markedly increase membrane fluidity leading to the efficient formation of lipid
  rafts [] in neuronal plasma membranes. Lipid rafts are the functional domains of
  the plasma membrane and play a crucial role in the regulation of transmembrane signaling
  []. TrkB receptors and some NMDA receptors are constituents of lipid rafts [–] and
  one of the major nonprotein components of lipid rafts is cholesterol []. The enhanced
  formation and/or efficiency of transmembrane signaling is hypothesized to result
  in enhanced activation (phosphorylation) of NMDA and TrkB receptors via the binding
  of BDNF to its cognate receptor, TrkB. Activation of NMDA receptors results in enhanced
  calcium influx and activation of signal transduction pathways leading to activation
  of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) via the canonical pathway (phosphorylation of
  I-κB leads to its dissociation from the dimer (p65/p50) which then translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds to κB sites to regulate gene expression) which in
  turn increases BDNF mRNA and protein levels [–]. Enhanced intracellular BDNF protein
  expression would lead to an increase in secretion, thereby maintaining its availability
  to bind to TrkB in an autocrine fashion [, ] as well as to stimulate neurogenesis,
  synaptogenesis, and synaptic function at distant sites (paracrine function).
