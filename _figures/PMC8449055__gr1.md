caption: Extensive cross talk between the oncogenic MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT signaling
  pathways and vertical versus horizontal modes of inhibition. Vertical inhibition
  consists of combining two or more inhibitors targeting the same linear pathway (e.g.,
  an EGFR inhibitor paired with a MEK inhibitor). Positive and negative feedbacks
  between different components of the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways
  allow for compensatory activation of one pathway when another is inhibited, which
  leads to tumor resistance. Horizontal inhibition mode aims to solve this resistance
  problem by targeting different pathways that function in parallel to regulate the
  same tumor-associated phenotype, such as a MEK inhibitor paired with AKT or PI3K
  inhibitor.

    signaling pathways and vertical versus horizontal modes of inhibition. Vertical
    inhibition consists of combining two or more inhibitors targeting the same linear
