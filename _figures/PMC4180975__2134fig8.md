caption: Model depicting CtsZ regulation of the protumorigenic functions of TAMs and
  cancer cells. Cancer cell-derived CtsZ regulates intracellular proliferation through
  the RGD motif located in the prodomain via activation of the FAK/Src signaling pathway.
  This process can occur through enhancing growth factor/adhesion-dependent integrin
  complex signaling either by intracellular regulation of the C-terminal tail of β-chain
  integrins by CtsZ (1) or at the cell surface through direct and/or indirect interaction
  with integrin complexes (2). (3) CtsZ is secreted by cancer cells mainly as an active
  enzyme and is detected in its active form at the cancer cell surface. While we found
  that active CtsZ is not necessary for the invasive properties of CtsZ, it could
  potentially enhance motility. (4,5) Although less substantially produced than the
  active form, tumor cell-derived pro-CtsZ can also enhance invasion by inducing the
  outside-in signaling of integrins, leading to focal adhesion complexes and actin
  cytoskeleton remodeling, depending on integrin complexes involving the β1 or β3
  chains. In a complementary manner, intracellular functions of CtsZ on integrin complexes
  could also promote cell motility by regulating the inside-out integrin pathway.
  (6) Critically, TAM-derived CtsZ is secreted as both a proform and an active form
  of the enzyme and binds to the cancer cell surface to promote integrin β1- and β3-dependent
  cancer cell invasion. (7) CtsZ derived from TAMs leads to enhanced levels of active
  CtsZ at the cancer cell surface, although it is not substantially internalized and
  does not promote proliferation. (8) In addition to CtsZ-mediated regulation of cancer
  cell invasion, CtsB, CtsL and CtsS cleave intercellular adhesion molecules as E-cadherin
  and JAMs, thereby enhancing migration (; ). (9) Degradation of ECM components by
  these cathepsins leads to enhanced cancer cell invasion and tumor malignancy. (10)
  TAMs express and secrete high levels of CtsB, CtsS and CtsZ, all of which contribute
  to promoting tumor progression (); however, only CtsZ regulates the migratory and
  invasive properties of TAMs in vivo, as we show here.
