caption: Role of lncRNAs in the drug resistance of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
  (1) LncRNA BORG (BMP/OP-Responsive Gene) activates NF-ĸB [], and RPA1 signaling
  is responsible for doxorubicin resistance; the modulating BORG expression restores
  chemosensitivity in TNBC. (2) LncRNA HSP5 downregulates PTEN and upregulates p-AKT
  expression, which is directly responsible for cisplatin resistance in TNBC, whereas
  the restoration of HSP5 expression leads to the reestablishment of drug sensitivity
  in TNBC. (3) LncRNA-ROR serves as a ceRNA, where the upregulation of ROR leads to
  the downregulation of miR-145 via the ARF6 pathway, which is responsible for 5-fluorouracil
  (FU) resistance and metastasis in TNBC. The knockdown of ROR by using shROR leads
  to the restoration of drug sensitivity and regulation of TNBC invasion. (4) The
  upregulation of NEAT1 in TNBC is responsible for the synergistic and combinational
  drug resistance of cisplatin and taxol. The knockdown of NEAT1 by shNEAT1 leads
  to sensitization of the cell to chemotherapy. (5) The upregulation of lncRNA H19
  regulates the AKT signaling pathway responsible for paclitaxel resistance. The knockdown
  of H19 restores chemosensitivity in TNBC. (6) LncRNA HIF1A-AS2 and AK124454 serve
  as integrated mRNA-lncRNA signatures responsible for paclitaxel resistance in TNBC.
