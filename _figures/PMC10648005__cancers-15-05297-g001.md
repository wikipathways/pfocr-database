caption: Schematic representation of the main molecular consequences of phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway activation. Stimulation
  of growth factor receptor activates PI3K, which in turn causes phosphorylation of
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3). This process can be reversed by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Increased
  activity of PIP3 results in recruitment of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1),
  which subsequently phosphorylates and activates Akt. Activation of Akt degrades
  p53, increases protein synthesis, and inhibits the activity of several proapoptotic
  proteins. Akt, through activation of mTOR, enables the formation of the two complexes—mTORC1
  and mTORC2. mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), which are responsible
  for cell growth and protein synthesis. mTORC2, on the other hand, regulates cytoskeletal
  architecture through protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation

  description: Schematic representation of the main molecular consequences of phosphoinositide
    3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway activation.
    Stimulation of growth factor receptor activates PI3K, which in turn causes phosphorylation
    of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate

    of Akt degrades p53, increases protein synthesis, and inhibits the activity of
