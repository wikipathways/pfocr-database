caption: 'Potential curcumin targets as antiviral and anti-inflammatory in SARS-CoV-2
  infection. The first antiviral effect of curcumin against SARS-CoV-2 is its potential
  for preventing the binding of viral S protein to the ACE2 receptor and initiate
  the host cell infection process (1). After penetrating the host cell via endosomes,
  the virus begins the replication process that requires an acid endosomal environment
  to initiate the proteolytic process of viral proteins and subsequent release to
  the external environment. Curcumin acts by inhibiting the Endosomal acidification
  (2) and processing of the viral proteins (Mpro), necessary for viral release (3,4).
  Further, the inhibition of ACE mediated by curcumin (5) prevents the increase of
  Ang II levels. Curcumin inhibits NF-κB (6) through the inhibition of different pathways.
  The binding of PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines that leads to IkB phosphorylation and
  proteasomal degradation is one of those pathways that cause NF-κB activation. Curcumin
  prevents both IkB phosphorylation and p65 subunit from the NF-κB (8), which consequently
  prevents NF-κB activation. The activation of ADAM17 by the AngII-ATR1 axis promotes
  the interaction between EGF and EGFR receptor, which promotes the activation of
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis resulting in NF-κB activation. Curcumin acts as a potential
  inhibitor for mTOR (9), preventing the NF-κB pathway activation. ADAM17-mediated
  signaling also triggers the release of soluble interleukin 6-receptor, forming a
  complex with IL-6 (sIL-6R-IL-6) that binds to glycoprotein gp130. This complex binding
  (sIL-6R-IL-6+gp130) activates the signal transduction pathways responsible to induce
  the activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of STAT3 results in activation
  of NF-κB, which can be prevented by the curcumin (10). The NF-κB activation induces
  a protein complex formation, knowns as inflammasome, which can lead to cell death
  through pyroptosis, a pathway to cell death mediated by the activation of caspase-1.
  However, curcumin can cause the inhibition of inflammasome formation (11) by the
  inhibition of NF-κB. Abbreviations: TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease, serine 2; ACE1,
