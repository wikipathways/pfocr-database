caption: The RLR signaling pathway is shown. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize a complementary
  set of cytosolic viral dsRNA ligands. Their activation is tightly regulated by phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and host proteins such as LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 signal to MAVS, which
  initiates the production of interferon signaling. Circled “P” indicates phosphorylation
  and slashed circled “P” indicates dephosphorylation.
