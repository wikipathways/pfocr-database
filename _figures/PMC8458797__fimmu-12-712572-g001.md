caption: Factor D in the alternative complement pathway. Factor D is produced by adipocytes
  and secreted into circulation. Once MASP-3 has cleaved off the propeptide and converted
  factor D into its mature form, factor D is ready to perform its essential function
  in both the initiation phase and the amplification phase of the alternative complement
  pathway. First, factor D cleavage of C3-bound factor B is responsible for generation
  of the C3(H2O)Bb convertase, which splits C3 into C3b and the pro-inflammatory signaling
  anaphylatoxin C3a. Second, factor D cleavage of C3b-bound factor B in the amplification
  loop is responsible for generation of the predominant C3 convertase C3bBb, which
  amplifies the signal and creates additional C3b and C3a molecules. The classical
  and lectin complement pathways converge at the amplification loop of the alternative
  pathway and as such their signals are also amplified by the action of factor D.
  Besides incorporation into C3 convertase complexes for signal amplification, C3b
  also functions to opsonize cells for phagocytosis and, via downstream reactions,
  initiates MAC formation and cell lysis. Inhibition of these activities on self-cell
  surfaces is controlled by a network of regulatory proteins. Dashed arrows represent
  the rate-limiting steps. C, complement; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; FB, factor
