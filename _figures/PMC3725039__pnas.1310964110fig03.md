  incorporate the effect of differential acidity are in blue. (A) Pathway X (E•S →
  E•I) can be dissected into a four-step or seven-step thermodynamic cycle. (i) Dissociation
  of androstene from KSI; (ii) solution deprotonation of androstene; (iii) solution
  protonation of general base Asp40; (iv) binding of intermediate as a dienolate to
  KSI with a protonated general base (i.e., KSID40N) plus autoionization of water;
  (iv′) solution formation of dienol; (v′) solution deprotonation of oxyanion hole;
  (vi′) binding of intermediate as a dienol to KSI with a protonated general base;
  (vii′) internal proton transfer plus two autoionizations of water. The left-hand
  half-cycle uses  to complete the cycle, and the full cycle uses . The right-hand
  half-cycle relates differential acidity to  and . (B) Detailed treatment of step
