caption: Shown are effects on amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic APP metabolism (blue)
  as well as intra- and extracellular accumulation of Aβ products. The insulin receptor
  (IR) is located within the caveolae and its signaling is promoted by caveolin-1,
  whereas insulin resistance (red), as existent in type 2 diabetes or modeled by Wortmannin
  (yellow), interferes with insu-lin signaling. Impaired insulin signaling inhibits
  the release of sAPPα from the intra- to the extracellular space (blue). It also
  promotes the activation of caspases and via the activation of so-called stress kinases
  enhances the phosphorylation of tau. Increased extra- and intracellular cholesterol
  becomes enriched in lipid rafts, where it is coupled with up-regulation of APP as
  well as α- and β-secretase resulting in increased accumulation of Aβ and CTFs (amyloidogenic
  pathway, blue). These amyloid peptides and fragments are released to the extracellular
  space or remain intracellular. Aβ products activate caspases, which in turn pro-mote
  the splicing of tau and subsequent phosphorylation by stress kinases. Apo4E enhances
  the incorporation of cholesterol into lipid rafts, promotes formation of Aβ products,
  interferes with insulin signaling and inhibits non-amyloidogenic formation of sAPPα.
