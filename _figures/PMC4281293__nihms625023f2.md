caption: 'To reveal potential pathways involved in pancreatic cancer survival, the
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for upstream regulator analysis. The top
  three upstream regulators for the STS associated proteins were MYC, insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and TP53 (). MYC is a transcription factor that
  controls expression of numerous genes that govern cell proliferation, cell growth,
  cell differentiation and apoptosis. In our previous tissue proteomics studies, c-MYC
  was identified as a significant regulator implicating in pancreatic cancer, chronic
  pancreatitis, as well as precancerous PanIN3, , . In the current study, 25 STS associated
  proteins were regulated by MYC. IGF1R plays a crucial role in tumor transformation
  by regulating cell growth and survival. Eleven STS associated proteins were downstream
  of IFG1R pathways, five of which were also regulated by MYC. Tumor suppressor gene
  p53 is frequently mutated or deleted in pancreatic cancer. The protein product of
  p53 gene plays a pivotal role monitoring cellular repair and apoptosis in response
  to genetic damage or metabolite disorder. Twenty-four STS associated proteins were
  regulated by p53 protein. In connection with the other two upstream regulators MYC
  and IGF1R, the top three upstream regulators and their downstream targets (48 STS
  associated proteins) formed a cross-talk network involving two essential traits
  of cancer cells: proliferation and apoptosis. The top three upstream regulators
  for VLTS associated proteins were vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA),
  apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TGF-β1, regulating 10, 9, and 24 VLTS associated proteins
  respectively (). These three upstream regulators linked 35 VLTS associated proteins
  in a network that regulated angiogenesis (VEGFA), cholesterol regulation (APOE)
  and proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis (TGF-β1). While the information
  revealed by IPA is informative and consistent with our understanding of pancreatic
  tumorigenesis, much work is needed to experimentally investigate these molecular
  events that can potentially influence pancreatic cancer survival.'
