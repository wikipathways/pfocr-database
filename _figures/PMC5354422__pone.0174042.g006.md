caption: FIR inhibits MMPs and leads to interference with collagen degradation. Furthermore,
  FIR increases collagen synthesis through the TGF-β/Smad pathway. In addition, FIR-induced
  autophagy may be mediated by inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Autophagy
  can block the epidermal hyperproliferative response to UV and may suppress photoaging.
