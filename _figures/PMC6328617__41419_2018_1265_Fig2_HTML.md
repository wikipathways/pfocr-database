caption: After binding to the ectodomain of the CD44v6 molecule, OPN is potent in
  inducing CRC colonization along with invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, OPN is
  able to activate the CD44v6 molecule through enabling the intracellular domain of
  the CD44v6 molecule to be phosphorylated, which is demonstrated to be able to upregulate
  the expression of genes encoding CCL5, CXCL12, and MMP2/9 (see ref. ). As a result,
  the invasive and metastatic capabilities of CRC cells improve (green line). In addition,
  the interaction between OPN and CD44v6 is able to promote the proliferation of CRC
  cells by activating the HRas/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (red line)
