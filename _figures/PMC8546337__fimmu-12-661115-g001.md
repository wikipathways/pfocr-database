caption: The mechanisms by which poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors promote
  immune response against tumor cells. The PARP inhibitor inactivates GSK3β, which
  can lead to increased PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. The release of dsDNA and
  the activation of the cGAS–STING pathway results in the increased expression of
  type I IFN via the TBK1-IRF3 and TBK1-NF-κB pathways. Type I IFN activates immune
  effector cells by promoting the presentation of tumor dendritic cell antigen/neoantigen,
  and the major histocompatibility complex of a dendritic cell binds to T cell receptors
  and activates T cells. The activated T cells infiltrate the tumors and recognize
  tumor antigens that presented on the tumor cell surface. PD-L1 expression, as an
  immune escape signal, can be targeted with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (red
  dotted line).
