caption: Transcriptional regulation of NLRP3 expression. The activation of TLRs by
  DAMPs, PAMPs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1β triggers NF-κB
  activation, which subsequently induces the transcription of the NLRP3 gene. This
  NF-κB-dependent transcription is mediated by FADD and caspase-8. During IAV infection,
  NLRP3 transcription is also upregulated via the ERK/c-Jun/AP-1 signaling pathway.
  In response to α-synuclein, Fyn kinase regulates PKCδ-mediated NF-κB activation,
  thereby promoting NLRP3 expression. Furthermore, atheroprone flow activates the
  NLRP3 inflammasome through SREBP2 activation. Under hypertonic stress, NFAT5 functions
  as a transcription factor to enhance NLRP3 expression. In endothelial cells exposed
  to high glucose conditions, ELF3 interacts with SET8 to regulate NLRP3 transcription.
  Conversely, during TCDD exposure, AhR suppresses NLRP3 expression. In models of
  LPS-induced septic shock and DSS-induced colitis, GSNOR modulates NLRP3 expression
  by reducing S-nitrosylated MAPK14 levels. Under hypoxic conditions, the accumulation
  of HIF-1α inhibits NLRP3 transcription by downregulating mTOR signaling and promoting
  autophagy, particularly in the context of DSS-induced colitis. AhR aryl hydrocarbon
