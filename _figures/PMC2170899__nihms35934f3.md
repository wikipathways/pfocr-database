caption: 'Schematic representation of the chemotaxis system of E. coli and the Frz
  pathway of M. xanthus. The chemotaxis system of E. coli is composed of a transmembrane
  receptor (MCP) that receives signals from the periplasm; a methyltrasferase (CheR)
  and a methylesterase (CheB) that modulate the methylation state of the MCP; a histidine
  kinase (CheA) linked to the MCP through the helper protein CheW; a response regulator
  (CheY) that, once phosphorilated by CheA, can directly communicate with the flagellar
  motor; the phosphatase CheZ increases the spontaneous dephosphorilation of CheY
  to allow rapid signal termination. The stimulation from the periplasm leads, through
  the chemotaxis system, to the switch in the flagellar rotation so that E. coli cells
  can swim in the direction of nutrients. The Frz pathway of M. xanthus shares homology
  with the chemotaxis system of E. coli: FrzCD is a cytoplasmic MCP methylated and
  demethylated respectively by FrzF (CheR) and FrzG (CheB); FrzE is a fusion between
  a CheA (purple) and CheY (green) domain; FrzA and FrzB are CheW proteins; FrzZ is
  a fusion of two CheY domain. The Frz pathway regulates the frequency by which M.
  xanthus cells reverse the gliding direction to orientate in response to stimuli.'
