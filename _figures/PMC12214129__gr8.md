caption: Summary of the effect of miR-1 loss on glycolytic and pentose phosphate enzymes
  and intermediates.Glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway enzymes (ovals) and intermediates
  (text) depicted. Enzymes up-regulated in miR-1 KO RNA-seq or mitochondrial proteomics
  indicated by green color, and inactivated enzymes indicated by red color. Up-regulated
  metabolites in miR-1 KO metabolomics indicated by bolded green text. Green plus
  sign indicates positive regulation. Target symbol indicates eCLIP-seq-defined miR-1
  target. Created using Biorender.com
