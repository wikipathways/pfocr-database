caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the results of studies investigating the role
  of genes in the p53 pathway in the cellular response to radiation. (A) Mice that
  lack p53 () or PUMA (, ) are resistant to hematopoietic radiation toxicity because
  of decreased radiation-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition,
  mice with hematopoietic cell-specific deletion of Bax and Bak are also resistant
  to radiation-induced acute hematopoietic toxicity (), which recapitulates the phenotype
  observed in p53−/− and PUMA−/− mice. In addition to suppressing apoptosis, deletion
  of p53 increases the fitness of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells after irradiation
  (, ) through mechanisms that are partially dependent on blocking radiation-induced
  senescence. Conversely, deletion of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 decreases
  the fitness of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells after irradiation (, ), which
  is likely due to defects in cell cycle arrest. In long-term hematopoietic stem cells
  (LT-HSCs), radiation induces p21 in a p53-independent manner, which improves self-renewal
  of stem cells. Moreover, deletion of p21 increases p53 levels in LT-HSCs after irradiation,
  suggesting that p21 negatively regulates p53 in LT-HSCs (). (B) Deletion of p53
  in the whole animal (, ) or in the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium () suppresses
  radiation-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by PUMA () and Bax/Bak (), in transit
  amplifying cells in the GI epithelium. However, loss of p53 in the GI epithelium
  exacerbates the radiation-induced GI syndrome (, ) because of defects in p21-mediated
  cell cycle arrest, which leads to mitotic catastrophe in putative intestinal stem
  cells that are responsible for tissue regeneration after radiation. (C) Deletion
  of p53 sensitizes endothelial cells to radiation (, ) due to defects in p21-mediated
  cell cycle arrest. Damage of cardiac endothelial cells by radiation leads to myocardial
  hypoxia and cardiac ischemia, which cause radiation-induced cardiac injury ().
