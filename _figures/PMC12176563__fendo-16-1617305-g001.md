caption: Cardiac substrate utilization and ATP production pathways. (A) The pathway
  through which energy enters the myocardial cells. (B) The ETC extracts protons and
  promotes ATP generation. Figure 1 illustrates cardiac substrate utilization and
  ATP production pathways. Panel (A) depicts pathways through which energy substrates
  enter cardiomyocytes via specific membrane transporters. Panel (B) demonstrates
  how mitochondrial ETC utilizes NADH and FADH2 derived from TCA cycle oxidation to
  establish a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase-mediated ATP production. Both
  panels strictly correspond to the described biochemical processes without extraneous
  additions
