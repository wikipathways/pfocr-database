caption: A Schematic Diagram Developed from the Integration of Differentially Expressed
  Genes (DEGs) and Differentially Accumulated Metabolites (DAMs) in the Phenylpropanoid
  Pathway in Stems. Three biological control leaf samples (CK-Y1, CK-Y2, and CK-Y3)
  and three biological treated leaf samples (C-Y1, C-Y2, and C-Y3) are coded by three
  squares or rectangles in the order of CK-Y1, CK-Y2, CK-Y3, C-Y1, C-Y2, and C-Y3.
  The six squares or rectangles were used to create heatmaps. The expression levels
  of genes and accumulation levels of metabolites in C-Y1, C-Y2, C-Y3, C-Y1, C-Y2,
  and C-Y3 are coded by colored heatmaps of the six squares or rectangles. 4CL, CYP73A,
  and HCT coded with a light blue color on each arrow mean that their gene expression
  levels are downregulated in the treated stems. Cinnamic acid, p-coumaraldehyde,
  and p-coumaroyl quinic acid, which are coded with a light blue color and included
  together in a heatmap contained in a dashed box, mean that their levels are decreased
  in the treated stems, while caffeoyl quinic acid coded by a red color means its
  decrease.
