caption: The genetic defects containing the DNA repair gene, telomerase activity,
  redox genes, and anti-oxidant capacity superimposed by common environmental factors
  are responsible for increased DNA damage by increased free oxygen radical production
  in SSc patients. Increased DNA damage then activates type 1 interferon pathway to
  induce inflammation and collage synthesis mimicking inflamm-aging in patients with
  SSc. On the other hand, the free radicals may also further impede DNA repair in
  SSc patients.
