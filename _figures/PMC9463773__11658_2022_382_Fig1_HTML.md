caption: PAR heterodimerization. A PAR1/PAR4—P2Y12. PAR1-PAR4 heterodimer is required
  for thrombin response within a wide concentration range. Activation of the Gαqpathway
  (black arrows), promotes ADP secretion and the consequent activation of the P2Y12
  receptor. PAR4-P2Y12 dimer complex recruits β-arrestin and Akt (blue arrows) leading
  to the activation of integrin and platelet aggregation. On the other hand, TXA2
  generation (red arrows) depends on Erk1/2 signaling triggered by the three receptors.
  TXA2 is involved in platelet recruitment to the site of injury. B PAR1-PAR2. PAR1
  thrombin-induced activation of PAR1 in the early phases of sepsis is vascular disruptive,
  involving Ca2+ mobilization, and Rho/ROCK activity. The inclusion of PAR2 induces
  a switch to Rac1 signaling and the activation of β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 signaling,
  which is vascular protective. PAR1-PAR2 barrier protection can also depend on FXa.
  C PAR1-PAR3. Thrombin activation of PAR1-PAR3 increases barrier permeability, by
  stimulating Gα13 over Gαq activity. On this line, the activation of EPCR or PAR3
  APC can mediate endothelial barrier protection by directly interacting activating
  PAR1
