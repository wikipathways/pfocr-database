caption: The major targets of amino acids, peptides, and their analogs for the control
  of skin pigmentation. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) plays
  a primary role in inducing gene expression of melanogenic enzymes, such as tyrosinase
  (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) in
  response to various internal and external stimuli. In addition to the α-melanocyte
  stimulating hormone (MSH)/ melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) /adenyl cyclase (AC)/
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-responsive element-binding
  protein (CREB) pathway, the stem cell factor (SCF)/receptor tyrosine kinase protein,
  c-Kit/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, and WNT/frizzled/glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK) 3β/β-catenin pathway can activate MITF. Other signaling pathways,
  such as phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC) β cascade,
  and nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) cascade are also involved in the
  activation of MITF. Melanosome biogenesis occurs through morphologically distinct
  stages 1, −2, −3, and −4. Melanogenic enzymes matured through post-translational
  modifications in endoplasmic reticulum and metal-loading in Golgi apparatus are
  sorted and transported to stage 2 melanosomes. Melanin is synthesized thereafter
  and the mature stage 4 melanosomes with accumulated melanin are transferred through
  dendrites to keratinocytes.
