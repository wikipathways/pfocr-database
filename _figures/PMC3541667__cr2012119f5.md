caption: Hypothetic model explaining how KDM6 may contribute to definitive endoderm
  differentiation. Treatment of hESCs with activin A causes activation of KDM6A and
  KDM6B, which can target and remove the H3K27me3 repressive mark leading to upregulation
  of WNT3. Increased WNT3 causes activation of the WNT pathway and promotes mesendoderm
  differentiation. At the late stage of endoderm differentiation, WNT antagonist gene
  DKK1 is activated by KDM6A and KDM6B in a similar fashion to suppress WNT signaling
  pathway for mesendoderm to definitive endoderm differentiation. ME, mesendoderm;
  DE, definitive endoderm.
