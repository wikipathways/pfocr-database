caption: Activation of the PI3K pathway leads to formation of PIP3 and recruitment
  of Akt to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated and activated. (Left)
  Exposure to small molecule PI3K antagonists currently in the clinic promotes the
  Hsp90-dependent recruitment of active Akt2 from cytosol to mitochondria, and Akt-phosphorylation
  of the permeability pore component CypD resulting in apoptosis inhibition. (Right)
  Exposure to PI3K therapy also induces the oxidative phosphorylation-dependent redistribution
  of mitochondria to the cortical cytoskeleton in proximity with focal adhesion complexes
  implicated in cell motility, and providing an efficient, regional energy source
  to fuel tumor cell motility and invasion. PI3K therapy reprogramming can be blocked
  by combination with the mtHsp90 inhibitor Gamitrinib. ECM, extracellular matrix;
  ETC, electron transport chain; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
