caption: The folate cycle is fueled by the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) and extracellular
  serine. SSP diverges from glycolysis at the level of 3-phosphoglycerate, which is
  converted into 3-phospho-hydroxipyruvate by the action of the enzyme phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHDGH) and ultimately to serine following further enzymatic steps.
  This pathway is of great importance in cancers with mutated or overexpressed PHDGH,
  while serine import plays a pivotal role in maintenance of the serine cellular balance
  in cells with unaltered PHDGH activity. The folate cycle in the vast majority of
  the cells starts in mitochondria by the action of serine hydroxymethyl transferase
  2 (SHMT2) which generates glycine and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-methylene-THF).
  The next reaction can produce NADH or NADPH depending if methenyltetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 2 (MTHD2) or MTHD2-like (MTHD2L) is used to convert 5,10-methylene-THF
  into 5,10-methenyl-THF. The same enzyme than generate one-carbon unit—10-formyl-THF,
  which can be used for ATP production by the enzyme (MTHD1L) or NADPH generation
  in the reaction catalyzed by 10-formyTHF dehydrogenase (ALDH1L2). If ATP is generated,
  10-formylTHF is converted into a format that is transported into the cytosol and
  used by trifunctional MTHFD1 enzyme to regenerate 10-formylTHF for purine synthesis,
  5,10-methylene-THF for thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation in the
  methionine cycle. The unidirectionality of the folate cycle seems to be provided
  by more oxidative mitochondrial redox state that favors use of NAD(P)+ by mitochondrial
  MTHD2(L).
