caption: Non-RNA degradation antisense mechanisms (occupancy only). RNA is transcribed
  from DNA into a precursor form (pre-mRNA) which is undergoes several post-transcriptional
  processing events, such as splicing to remove intronic sequences and polyadenylation
  to form the mature RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is exported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  where it is translated into its protein product. ASOs can be designed to modify
  RNA processing events in the nucleus such as modulate RNA splicing to exclude or
  include a protein coding exon. In some cases, excluding specific exons could result
  in a truncated protein product or alternatively, the RNA missing a specific exon
  is recognized by the cell as mis-spliced and is degraded by the non-sense mediated
  decay (NMD) pathway. ASOs can also be designed to alter polyadenylation site selection
  resulting in loss of RNA regulatory sequences in 3’-untranslated regions of the
  RNA. In the cytoplasm, ASOs can be designed to decrease translation of the RNA into
  proteins by binding to sequences in the 5’-untranslated region of the mRNA or by
  blocking microRNA binding to the RNA. ASOs can also be designed to block translation
  starting at an upstream open reading frame (uORF) or disrupt regulatory RNA structures
  resulting in an increase in protein translation.
