caption: 'Intracellular trafficking of AT1R and main biological responses coupled
  to nuclear AT1R or AT2R stimulation. AT1R stimulation by Ang II induces G-protein
  activation, including Gi, Gq/11, and G12/13 (canonical signaling pathway) and G-protein-independent
  signal transduction (non-canonical pathway) leading to ERK 1/2, JNK, Akt, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinases activation, and eNOS phosphorylation through β-arrestin. Upon agonist
  stimulation, AT1R is internalized through CCPs and caveolae dependent pathways and
  then recycled back to the cell surface or targeted lysosome. AT1R-D5R heteromerization
  induced AT1R proteasomal degradation after D5R stimulation. AT1R translocation to
  the nucleus induces biological responses depicted in the scheme. AT2R translocation
  to the nucleus occurs by heteromerization with AT1R. Nuclear AT2R stimulation induced
  NO generation. Abbreviations: Ang II, Angiotensin II; AT1R, Ang II receptor type
  1; AT2R, Ang II receptor type 2; D5R, dopamine receptor type 5; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; ERK1/2, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; IGF-1,
  insulin-like growth factor 1; IP3, Inositol triphosphate; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase;
  NET, norepinephrine transporter; NO, nitric oxide; PRR, pro-renin receptor; TH,
  tyrosine hydroxylase; β-arr, β-arrestin.'
