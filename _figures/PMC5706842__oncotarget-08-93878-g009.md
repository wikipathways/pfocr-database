caption: Juglanin improved ROS generation in human lung cancer cells. ROS stimulation
  down-regulated PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 activation, while up-regulated JNK/P38 phosphorylation,
  leading to the cell survival reduction through suppressing p65 expression and promoting
  p53 levels. DR4 and DR5 were activated for p53 high expression, which bind to TRAIL
  and activate FADD/Caspase-8, resulting in Caspase-3 cleavage. On the other, p53
  up-regulation accounts for Bad/Bax expression, augmenting Caspase-9 expression and
  activating Caspase-3, contributing to apoptosis eventually. Also, PI3K/AKT de-phosphorylation
  reduced NF-κB signaling pathway, causing anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl
  expression suppression. Moreover, juglanin suppressed ERK1/2 activation and decreased
  cell survival, while JNK/P38 signaling pathways were activated, leading to apoptosis.
  Further, autophagy was also induced for juglanin treatment through Beclin1/PIK3C3
  activation, triggering ATGs and LC3 activation. Finally, autophagy was elicited,
  causing lung cancer cell death. All of the signaling pathways were accounts for
  lung cancer cell death regulated by juglanin.
