caption: ALDH1A1 pathway. This graph shows all genes from our dataset (except SNCA)
  known to interact with ALDH1A1. In blue represent genes that are downregulated,
  in yellow genes that are upregulated and in grey genes not significantly dysregulated
  but important for the pathway. Line in purple represent binding between two molecules
  and an arrow with a positive sign represent a positive regulation.
