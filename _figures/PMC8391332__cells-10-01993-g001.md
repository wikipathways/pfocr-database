caption: Possible mechanisms involved with microbiota changes and neuropsychiatric
  conditions in COVID-19. Individuals affected by SARS-Cov-2 have changes in lung
  microbiota, as well as changes in the gut microbiota, dysbiosis, and gastrointestinal
  symptoms. SARS-Cov-2 enters the respiratory system and systemic circulation but
  can also access other organs and systems, including gastrointestinal and central
  nervous systems. The main mechanism of entry of the virus into cells is mediated
  by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is widely expressed
  in these systems. The virus itself is not the only factor associated with the COVID-19
  severity; it is believed that elevated inflammatory markers, such as chemokine (C-X-C
  motif) ligand-10 (CXCL-10), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
  and C-reactive protein (CRP) and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte rate are also
  involved in disease severity. Systemic exacerbated inflammation could lead to an
  increase in blood–brain-barrier (BBB) permeability, leading to neuroinflammation.
  In addition, the virus can also activate microglia cells, leading to increased cytokines
  release and astrocyte activation, which are associated with the development and
  progression of mood disorders, including depression. These effects also can elevate
  protein aggregates that are involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative
  diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. In the small intestine,
  ACE-2 receptor is necessary for the surface expression of the neutral amino acid
  transporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19). Tryptophan (TRP) is mainly absorbed via the B0AT1/ACE2
  transport pathway and induces the activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway, which regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides, which
  are important to maintain an ideal microbiota in the large intestine. Thus, the
  block of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 binding in the ACE-2 receptor could lead to
  inflammation and microbiota changes, which can be associated with the COVID-19 severity.
  There is bidirectional communication between brain and gut; thus, dysbiosis and
  exacerbated inflammation induced by COVID-19 could affect the brain and increase
  the risk of mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Probiotic treatment could
  be an alternative treatment since it can reduce inflammation and improve gut microbiota.
