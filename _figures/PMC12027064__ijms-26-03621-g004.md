caption: A schematic representation of the microbiota-induced expresssion of MMPs
  in the gut–brain axis and the gut–skin axis. On the left-hand side in the gut–skin
  axis and specifically in acne, C. acnes seem to promote the upregulation of MMPs,
  including MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13. Simultaneously in the gut, bacteria such as
  Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Butyricicoccus produce SCFAs which protect the
  gut and skin barriers by inhibiting HDACs. In melanoma, gut-derived SCFAs seem to
  mitigate MMP-9 expression in the skin through inhibition of HDACs and butyrate-GPCR-mediated
  NF-κB attenuation. On the right-hand side in the gut–brain axis, MMP-10 levels are
  altered in AD, which is correlated to increased colonization of Pasteurellaceae
  and decreased colonization of Lautropia mirabilis in the gut. In MS, researchers
  have observed increased secretory levels of MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13, and the administration
  of probiotic strains Enterococcus durans and a mix of L. rhamnosus, L. casei, and
  L. plantarum downregulated the expression of MMP-9 in the brain and CSF. In the
  CNS, acetate and butyrate have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects on
  microglial cells via the inhibition of HDAC1 and ERK/JNK/NF-κB signaling pathway,
  thus possibly diminishing ΜMP expression. In stroke, plasma MMP-9 levels were found
  to be correlated with the proinflammatory IL-1β/IL-17/TNFα-associated Llobaculum,
  Erysipelotrichia, Erysipelotrichales, and Erysipelotrichaceae taxa. This figure
