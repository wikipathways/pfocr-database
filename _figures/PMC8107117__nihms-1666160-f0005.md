caption: 'Oncogenic mechanisms of YAP1 fusions. Left: Regulation of wild type YAP1
  activity by the Hippo pathway. Right: YAP1 fusion proteins are resistant to Hippo
  pathway-mediated regulation, due to both constitutive nuclear localization (mediated
  by the nuclear localization sequence present in the C-terminal fusion partner sequence)
  and resistance to proteasomal degradation (mediated by the loss of YAP1 S397 in
  the fusion protein). Figure was created with BioRender.com'
