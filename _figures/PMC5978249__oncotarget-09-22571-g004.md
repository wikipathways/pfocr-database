caption: The phosphorylation of selected factors downstream of RAS was quantified
  in SNF94.3 (top) and SNF96.2 (bottom) following treatment with putative inhibitors
  of targets downstream using an antibody array. The node size and font size denoting
  a given factor in a simplified schematic of the PI3K/MEK/mTOR axis are directly
  proportional to the measured relative fluorescent signal, which is proportional
  to the amount of phosphorylation for a given target. Due to differences in antibody
  affinities, relative phosphorylation signal differences can only be remarked upon
  in contrasting the same target between treatment conditions. The specific treatment
  (or DMSO control) associated with each schematic is listed on the bottom, and inhibitor
  lines point to the primary factor targeted. The color of each box represents the
  statistical significance for each given factor, suggesting that the phosphorylation
  levels are significantly different between the two cell lines. The associated p-values
  are provided on the color bar. Broadly, red indicates very strong significance (p
  < 0.00001), purple indicates significance (p < 0.002), cyan indicates borderline
  significance (p < 0.004), and white indicates low confidence in significance (p
  > 0.05).
