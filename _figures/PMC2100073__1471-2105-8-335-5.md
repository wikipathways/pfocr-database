caption: The filamentation signaling pathway. (A) The main chain of the filamentation
  pathway (KEGG Database), (B) PathFinder output for the Sho1-Tec1 pair (75% recall,
  17% precision). For (A), the dashed interactions indicate that these interactions
  do not exists in the database. For (B), the proteins that were not on the main chain
  of the pathway were not colored, whereas the proteins on the main chain are colored
  grey. Proteins that are part of other pathways are colored with different colors.
