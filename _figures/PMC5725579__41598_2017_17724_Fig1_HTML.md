caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway leading to multiple Amaryllidaceae alkaloids.
  Enzymes for which corresponding genes have been isolated from Amaryllidaceae are
  shown in bold black whereas from other plants are shown in bold grey. Broken arrow
  represents more than one biochemical reaction. Number in parenthesis corresponds
  to molecular ion m/z of [M + H] of alkaloid in positive MS mode detection. Abbreviations:
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, trans-cinnamate hydroxylase (CYP73A1); 4CL,
  4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, p-coumarate
  hydroxylase (CYP98A3); TYDC, tyramine decarboxylase; N4OMT, norbelladine 4-O-methyltransferase;
  NR, noroxomaritidine reductase; V11H, vittatine 11-hydroxylase; Sh/Q, shikimate/quinate.'
papertitle: Transcriptome and metabolome profiling of Narcissus pseudonarcissus ‘King
  Alfred’ reveal components of Amaryllidaceae alkaloid metabolism.
