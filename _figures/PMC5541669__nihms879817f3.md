caption: Systematic analysis of genes in pathways upstream of the nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) complex revealed a large repertoire of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-specific
  genetic alterations in B cell receptor (BCR) and myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 (MYD88) pathways. The presence of these mutations leads to aberrant
  activation of the canonical p50-RELA heterodimer and associated tumour dependency.
  These mutations, which are more frequent in the activated B cell (ABC) subtype of
  DLBCL, have provided the rationale for the clinical development of several BCR pathway
  inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. CARD11,
  caspase recruitment domain family member 11; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; IRAK,
  IL-1 receptor-associated kinase; IRF4, interferon regulatory factor 4; ITAM, immune
  receptor tyrosine-based activation motif; JAK1, Janus kinase 1; MALT1, mucosa-associated
  lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1; PKC, protein kinase C; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; TIR, Toll-interleukin receptor; TRAF6,
  TNF receptor associated factor 6. Adapted with permission from REF. , Nature Publishing
