caption: A model of estradiol action on hypothalamic astrocytes involving the progesterone
  production on the basis of present results and previous findings. Circulating estradiol
  acts on astrocytes that regulate progesterone (PROG) synthesis to activate the cAMP-PKA
  pathway. PKA can phosphorylate cytochrome P450scc and 3β-HSD, which regulate PROG
  production. The activated PKA pathway can also increase the expression of CYPs genes,
  which participate in the process of estradiol metabolism. Metabolic products of
  estradiol, 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2, exert strong oxidative stress on astrocytes. ER, i.e.
  estrogen receptor; CHOL, i.e.cholesterol.
