caption: In HCT15-FR cells, the highly expressed KLF6 protein interacts with TAF6L,
  a component of the PCAF complex. This interaction leads to the recruitment of the
  PCAF–p300/CBP complex, which, in turn, increases the succinylation of H3K23su. The
  increased succinylation enhances chromatin accessibility, thereby exposing more
  promoter regions of the FOSL2 gene. As a result, the expression of the FOSL2 target
  gene SEMA3C is upregulated. This upregulation promotes the accumulation of β-catenin
  in the nucleus by increasing Rac1-GTP levels. Within the nucleus, β-catenin forms
  a complex with TCF1, leading to the upregulation of c-Myc expression and, consequently,
  enhancing the 5-FU resistance of colon cancer cells. Moreover, β-catenin also upregulates
  FOSL2 expression through a TCF1-independent pathway, creating a positive feedback
  loop that further strengthens the drug resistance of colon cancer cells
