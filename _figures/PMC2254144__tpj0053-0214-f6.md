caption: A model describing the relationships between after-ripening (AR)-regulated
  genes, AR as a distinct developmental process, and the role of exogenous and endogenous
  ABA in the regulation of the seed transcriptome. (a) Thin arrows indicate developmental
  processes; thick arrows indicate the influence of specific factors on developmental
  pathways. Superscript numbers indicate pre (1) and post (2) AR states of unimbibed
  seeds. A dotted line is used to indicate imbibed seeds induced into a secondary
  dormancy state. Prior to seed desiccation both AR and dormancy (D) are activated,
  dormancy by ABA action, AR by an independent unknown mechanism. Following desiccation
  unimbibed seeds go through a process of dry AR. Freshly harvested imbibed seeds
  are dormant through the action of ABA, and ‘AR-downregulated’ genes are expressed.
  Following AR imbibed seeds express ‘AR-upregulated’ and ‘germination-upregulated’
  genes. Exogenously applied ABA can inhibit the completion of germination in AR seeds,
  but does not alter the expression of these gene sets, or reimpose expression of
  ‘AR-downregulated’ genes. Imbibed AR seeds can be reintroduced into a secondary
  D state, which reimposes upregulation of ‘AR-downregulated’ gene set expression
  and downregulation of ‘AR-upregulated’ gene set expression. (b) The relationship
  between AR and two genes regulating ABA synthesis (ABA1) or perception (LPP2). ABA1
  is a member of the ‘AR-downregulated’ gene set, and itself regulates 121 genes (differentially
  regulated in the D > aba1-1 F comparison, Table S1), and LPP2 is a member of the
  ‘AR-upregulated’ gene set, which has previously been shown to reduce sensitivity
  of the seed to ABA (). RD29B is a member of the ‘AR-downregulated’ gene set, itself
  regulated by ABA ().
