caption: Schematic representation of ripening-related TFs interacting with environmental
  and hormonal signals to regulate tomato fruit ripening. Rounded rectangles represent
  TFs and signaling components. Ethylene-dependent TFs are shown in bright orange,
  ethylene-independent TFs are shown in light green, while ethylene-dependent and
  -independent TFs are shown in light yellow. The ripening master TFs RIN, TAGL, and
  FUL1/2 act together with ethylene to regulate almost every aspect of ripening. Meanwhile,
  RIN regulates fruit softening by directly targeting LOB1. TFs such as HB-1, NAC,
  NOR, NOR-like1, GRAS4/38, AREB, ARF2A/2B, and WRKY1 regulate fruit ripening by altering
  ethylene biosynthesis and responses. Carotenoid and chlorophyll contents during
  tomato ripening are indicated by green and red triangles, respectively. Chlorophyll
  accumulation and degradation is regulated by several TFs, including GLK1/2, TKN2/4,
  and ARFs, and this process is modulated by the interplay of auxin and light. BZR1,
  a brassinosteroid response TF, regulates chlorophyll accumulation via promoting
  GLK2 expression. Light promotes fruit colorization through HY5 and BBX20 proteins,
  and low temperatures regulate anthocyanin accumulation in a light-dependent signaling
  pathway and also in a way connecting with cold-induced CBF signaling.
