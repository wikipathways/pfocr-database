caption: 'Construction of ML-hGRN for putative pluripotency renewal pathway in human
  embryonic stem cells. a. Two-layered hGRN built with bottom-up GGM algorithm. The
  gene IDs represented by each symbol can be found in Additional file : Table S3.
  b. The network built with ARACNE algorithm. The input files for both bottom-up GGM
  algorithm and ARANCE include the expression profiles (microarrays) of 2189 transcription
  factors and 19 putative pathway genes identified from literature []. Only one layer
  was built and red nodes in the second layer represent the three master transcription
  factors known to control the pluripotency renewal. The gene IDs represented by each
  symbol can be found in Additional file : Table S4'
