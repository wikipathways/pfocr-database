caption: Production of Nitric Oxide and Reactive Oxygen Species in Macrophages signaling
  pathways is predicted to be upregulated in EVPs from aged animals. Predicted up-
  and downregulation of mRNA targets in the cardiac hypertrophy signaling pathway.
  The red color indicates predicted upregulation while the green indicates predicted
  downregulation. The complete list of pathway targets and their predicted fold-change
  can be found in Supplementary Table S5.
