caption: The ferroptotic response is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid
  peroxidation, resulting in the formation of lipid peroxides. Increased iron not
  only triggers the Fenton reaction to produce ROS, but also increases the activity
  of iron-containing enzymes (e.g., ALOX), which contributes to lipid peroxidation.
  The activation of the GPX4, AIFM2, or ESCRT-III pathways can limit or repair the
  oxidation of PUFAs that result from the activation of the ACSL4-LPCAT3-ALOX pathway.
