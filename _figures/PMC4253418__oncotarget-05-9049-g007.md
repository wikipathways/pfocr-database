caption: 'Beginning with phospho-RTK and other kinase screening and functional proteomic
  analysis with RPPA on LTED ER-positive breast cancer cells with or without treatment
  with fulvestrant, dasatinib or MK0646 and combining the published reports, a resultant
  pathway signature mediated by LTED and the targeting therapies is illustrated. After
  targeting estrogen therapy, small number of tumor cells acquired adaptive capacities,
  including: 1) compensatory increase ER Expression; 2) activation of multiple receptor
  tyrosine kinases; 3) signal crosstalk between ER and growth factor receptor pathways.
  Fulvestrant down-regulates ER and suppresses the signal crosstalk (pink frame).
  Dasatinib targets multiple RTKs, including EphAs, HGRR, RYK as well as non-receptor
  tyrosine kinases. Combination of fulvestrant and dasatinib inhibits cancer cell
  proliferation and invasion by blocking multiple receptor or non-receptor tyrosine
  kinase and targeting ER and crosstalk between ER and growth factor signaling. MK0646
  targets IGF1R and Insulin R pathway, however, somehow activates RYK and Wnt pathway,
  leading β-catenin accumulation and relocates in nuclei, where, in turn, induce transcription
  of c-Myc and cyclin D1.'
