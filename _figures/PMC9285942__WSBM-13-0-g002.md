caption: Schematic representation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Key events
  along the pathway are numbered within the figure and described in the legend. The
  different types of relation between the pathway components are listed in the legend
  in the top‐right corner, and are represented in the diagram in red if they occur
  in the OFF state (when WNT ligands are absent), and in green if they take place
  in the ON state (when WNT binds to the receptor). Briefly, WNT proteins are produced
  and secreted by a cell. Upon reaching target cell, the WNT proteins trigger a cascade
  of intracellular events when they contact the Frizzled receptor and LRP co‐receptor
  located at the membrane surface. The receptor complex recruits the cytosolic protein
  Disheveled (DSH), which plays an important role in the inhibition of the β‐catenin
  destruction complex, composed by GSK3, AXIN, CK1, and APC. Free cytosolic β‐catenin
  is commonly phosphorylated by the destruction complex and thus marked for degradation.
  When the destruction complex is inhibited, increased levels of β‐catenin causes
  its translocation to the nucleus. Here, β‐catenin physically binds to the TCF/LEF
  family of transcription factors and is thought to displace the TLE/Groucho co‐repressors
  via not completely understood mechanisms. β‐catenin subsequently recruits a series
  of transcriptional co‐factors required for the activation of Wnt target genes
