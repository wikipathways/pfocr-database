caption: A) Model for the effect of rpoa-2(op259) on the apoptotic network via the
  Ras/MAPK pathway. CEP-1/p53 activity is induced by irradiation, and increased at
  baseline in rpoa-2(op259) by an unknown mechanism, but this results in only little
  germ cell apoptosis. rpoa-2(op259) thus has an additional inhibitory effect on apoptosis
  downstream of CEP-1 activation, at the level of the core apoptotic machinery (possibly
  at the level of CED-9). rpoa-2(op259) leads to reduced levels of activated MPK-1
  and genetic overactivation of Ras/MAPK restores IR-induced germ cell apoptosis levels
  in rpoa-2(op259) animals, suggesting that this pathway provides the link. rpoa-2(op259)
  might influence Ras/MAPK activity by affecting the phosphatase LIP-1. B) Model for
  the role of the Ras/MAPK pathway as a central and general modulator of germ cell
  apoptosis levels. Classically, DNA damage-induced and constitutive ‘physiological’
  germ cell death have been distinguished, genetically converging only at the level
  of the core apoptotic machinery. We and others see that the level of Ras/MAPK pathway
  activity is decisive for the extent of germ cell death, both at standard growth
  conditions and following ionising irradiation. Furthermore, activated MPK-1 levels
  are increased soon after irradiation treatment. For constitutive cell death, it
  remains to be resolved whether Ras/MAPK pathway activity is simply permissive or
  whether it is a direct part of the induction signalling. Overall, MAP kinase pathways
  could be acting as a master lever for the sensitivity of germ cells towards further
  pro-apoptotic stimuli.
