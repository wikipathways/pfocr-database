caption: Proposed mechanism of how glycosylation of regulatory factors affects vascular
  calcification. Mechanism of vascular calcification involves loss of inhibitor and
  gain inducer. In the condition rich of phosphate and calcium, the VSMC transdifferentiates
  into osteoblast-like cell (top panel). Calcification inducers such as BMP2, FGF23,
  and ALP were recently reported to be modified by glycosylation. Even the master
  regulator of calcification, RUNX2, is also reported to be modified by glycosylation.
  The activation of an osteogenic program by RUNX2 subsequently induces formation
  and secretion of MVs. Secreted MVs contain enzymes that support calcification (e.g.,
  ALP, (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), which are potent calcification
  inducers). MVs serve as nidus for hydroxyapatite formation. Matrix vesicle formation
  is interfered by autophagy. Autophagy is considered to decrease vascular calcification.
  BMP2 increases calcification through inhibition of autophagy. BMP2 secretion is
  modified by glycosylation. Fully glycosylated proteoglycan induces VC via a BMP2-BMP2R-smad1/5/8
  pathway. TGFβ-TGFβR induces calcification through smad2/3-β-catenin. This pathway
  inhibits autophagy, which eventually increases calcification. FGF23 secretion requires
  glycosylation by GALNT3. FGF23-klotho binding in VSMC activates an osteogenic program
  through ERK1/2. Overall, the increasing glycosylation will stabilize calcification
  inducers and eventually induce vascular calcification (middle and bottom panel).
