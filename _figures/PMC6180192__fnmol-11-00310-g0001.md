caption: A schematic diagram of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)
  activation via Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) and GSK-3. (A) The ligase
  complex Cullin 3 (Cul3) RING-box 1 (RBX1) E3 binds to the adaptor protein Keap1
  via Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac (BTB) domain. The Keap1 protein is ultimately able
  to interact with the Neh2 domain of NRF2 and that allows the ubiquitination and
  degradation of the NRF2 in the cytoplasm. (B) The electrophilic compounds modify
  the specific sensors known as the Cys sensor residues located on Keap1, leading
  to various conformational alterations that prevent NRF2 ubiquitination. Finally,
  NRF2 is accumulated and translocated to the nucleus, and a dimer is formed with
  the small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins (sMaf) to bind the antioxidant
  response element protein (ARE) regions in the DNA and mediate the upregulation of
  its target genes. (C) Alternatively, the NRF2 is activated via Glycogen synthase
  kinase-3 (GSK-3). The adaptor protein known as beta-transducin repeat containing
  protein (β-TrCP) binds to the complex of SCF ubiquitin ligase. Then, the GSK-3 protein
  phosphorylates NRF2 at the Neh6 domain. The phosphorylated form of NRF2 is predictable
  by the β-TrCP complex, which targets it for ultimate degradation. (D) Various signaling
  pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, are able to phosphorylate the GSK-3 protein
  and disrupt its activity, hence allowing the accumulation of NRF2.
