caption: A) Compared to chow-fed control (fl/fl) mice, hepatic insulin signaling is
  reduced in chow-fed hepatocyte-specific Abca1 knockout (HSKO) mice due to reduced
  plasma membrane (PM) free cholesterol (FC) content from decreased (a) trafficking
  of lysosomal FC to the PM and (b) cholesterol biosynthesis (c). Blunted insulin
  signaling leads to decreased activation of the Akt-mTORC pathway (d) and decreased
  expression and processing of SREBP1c (e), resulting in reduced de novo lipogenesis
  (f). Regulation of gluconeogenesis is unchanged in HSKO vs. fl/fl liver (g), but
  fatty acid (FA) oxidation is increased (h), perhaps due to activation of glucagon
  signaling (i). Western-type diet (WTD)-fed HSKO vs. control mice have a similar
  phenotype with decreased PM FC (a), decreased insulin signaling (d), and reduced
  lipogenesis (f), resulting in diminished hepatosteatosis. However, unlike chow-fed
  mice, WTD-fed HSKO mouse liver had decreased FA uptake (j; dashed arrow) and similar
  FA oxidation (k) versus WTD-fed control mice. B) Proposed sequence leading to unique
  selective insulin resistance in HSKO mouse liver. Downward arrows = decreased signal
  pathway/molecule activation relative to fl/fl (control) mice; horizontal arrows
  denote no change. The HSKO mouse liver shows a defect in the Akt2 and mTORC1 response
  to insulin, with a concomitant reduction in de novo lipogenesis. FoxO1 and gluconeogenesis
  remain suppressed by insulin.
