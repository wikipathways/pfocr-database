caption: 'Cellular mechanisms of estrogen-Induced vascular relaxation and remodeling.
  In endothelial cells, estrogen binds to cytosolic/ nuclear ERs, activates MAPK,
  and stimulates gene transcription and eNOS expression. Estrogen also binds to surface
  membrane ERs and stimulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, the MAPK/Akt
  pathway, eNOS activity and NO production. NO activates guanylate cyclase (GC) and
  increases cGMP which causes VSM relaxation by inhibiting Ca2+ influx and stimulating
  Ca2+ extrusion. Estrogen’s antioxidant  effects cause decreases in NADPH and O2–•
  production and increases in NO bioactivity. Estrogen also activates cyclooxygenases
  (COX) and enhances the production of PGI2, which in turn activates adenylate cyclase
  (AC), increases cAMP, and causes VSM relaxation by mechanisms similar to those of
  cGMP. ER also increases the release of EDHF, activates K+ channels and causes VSM
  hyperpolarization and inhibition of Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ channels. Estrogen also
  activates cytosolic/nuclear ERs in VSM and inhibits growth factor (GF)-mediated
  activation of MAPK, gene transcription and VSM growth. Estrogen also binds to plasma
  membrane ERs, decrease [Ca2+]i and inhibit Ca2+- dependent MLC phosphorylation and
  VSM contraction. Estrogen also inhibits PKC-, MAPK- and Rho kinase and thereby leads
  to decreases in the myofilament force sensitivity to [Ca2+]i. Dashed arrows indicate
  inhibition. A: agonist, R: receptor, PLC: phospholipase C, PIP2: phospatidyinositol
