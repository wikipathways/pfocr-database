caption: Subgraph of fasting BNM highlighting a potential SMM pathway. Nodes represent
  the metabolite, genotype and phenotype variables and edges represent the conditional
  dependencies between them. The maternal features are represented by square nodes
  and the offspring features are represented by circle nodes. Newborn outcome variables
  are grey, genotypes are green, and the remaining colors correspond to different
  metabolite classes. The solid, red edges correspond to the purported SMM pathway
  with statistically significant IDE after FDR correction and positive proportion
  mediated in the training data set, with nominal significance and positive PM confirmed
  in the validation data set. Dashed, grey edges correspond to nodes adjacent to the
  SMM pathway. AA, amino acid; AC, acylcarnitine; CHO, carbohydrate; FA, fatty acid;
  GC/TCA, glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid cycle; OA, organic acid; PUR/PYR, purine or
  pyrimidine.
