caption: Highlighted nodes represent genes from all heatmaps in – that were differentially
  expressed between myxomatous and non-myxomatous valves. Red denotes increased gene
  expression, green denotes reduced expression. Connections between nodes (i.e. edges)
  represent potential first-order interactions between 2 proteins. For clarity, genes
  used to induce the network are highlighted in capital text, and a subset of potential
  interactions is highlighted using bolded edges. BMP4, Bone morphogenetic protein;
