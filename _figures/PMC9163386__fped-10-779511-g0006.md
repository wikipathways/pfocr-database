caption: 'The consequence of the administration of C1INH therapeutic agents is predicted
  to ameliorate respiratory distress. Reversing the transcriptomic signature of the
  C1INH (SERPING1) gene was predicted to ameliorate the disease through multiple mechanisms
  and pathways. The data are retrieved from knowledge-based text mining using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen Co., USA). Red node: the manipulated gene;
  orange nodes: predicted to be upregulated; and blue nodes: predicted to be downregulated.
