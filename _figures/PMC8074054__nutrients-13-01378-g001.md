caption: 'Different mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia in patients
  with CD. The combined effect of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) in determining
  increased muscle protein degradation, through NF-KB and increased Myostatin activity,
  are here summarized. By reducing IGF-1 and its related intracellular signal pathway,
  along with the decreased amino acid absorption also due to therapeutic interventions,
  chronic inflammation determines a diminished protein synthesis. Abbreviations: TNF-α:
  tumor necrosis factor Alfa; IL-6: interleukin 6; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  AKT: protein kinase B; mTORC1: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; IGF-1: Insulin-Like
  Growth Factor-1; NF-KB: Nuclear Factor Kappa B.'
