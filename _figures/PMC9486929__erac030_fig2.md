caption: Fe homeostasis of mesophyll cells. Mesophyll cells of dicots such as Arabidopsis
  primarily operate a reduction-based Fe acquisition mechanism, whereas the extent
  of YSL-mediated Fe uptake is less well characterized. IRT-type transporters are
  suggested to mediate the transport of divalent metals. Although transmembrane transport
  is generally accepted to be based on the free forms, Fe should be complexed in the
  cytoplasm to avoid ROS generation. Fe complexed by low-molecular-weight ligands
  is thought to be part of the labile Fe pool of the cells. The proper composition
  of this labile Fe pool is yet to be understood. FRO family enzymes are targeted
  into both chloroplasts and mitochondria, thus their Fe acquisition is supposedly
  dominated by the reduction-based pathway, too. Fe import into the mitochondrial
  matrix and chloroplast stroma is a complex process because of the double-envelope
  system of the organelles. Nevertheless, functional characterization of the protein
  members of this machinery is far from complete, as discussed in . In Fe acquisition
  by chloroplasts, PIC1, NiCo, and MFL components can cooperate, whereas mitochondria
  may primarily operate MIT1 and MIT2. Fe in the chloroplasts and mitochondria is
  directed towards incorporation into hemes and Fe–S clusters. Hemes are synthesized
  by ferrochelatases, but frataxin is considered to be involved in heme biosynthesis
  in mitochondria. Mitochondria and chloroplasts operate the ISC and SUF systems,
  respectively, for the biogenesis of Fe–S clusters. Plant GRXs are involved in the
  management and insertion of Fe–S clusters into apoproteins. The export of Fe–S clusters
  towards the cytoplasm involves NEET proteins and ABC transporters. Both the photosynthetic
  and respiratory electron transport chains require a significant amount of Fe, thus
  in mesophyll cells, Fe is primarily directed towards protein complexes operating
  these processes. During the decomposition of these systems, Fe can be liberated.
  YSL family transporters are considered to be involved in retaining the solubility
  of Fe and exporting Fe out of the plastids. In addition to the organellar Fe–S cluster
  biosynthesis, in the cytoplasm the eukaryotic CIA system, which partly depends on
  the mitochondrial ISC system as a source of reduced sulfur, is operational. Although
  the vacuoles of the leaf cells contribute to the temporal storage of Fe, the primary
  Fe storage that helps to manage temporal Fe excess or Fe liberation are ferritins
  (also illustrated in ). Since Fe is a potentially toxic element, proper control
  over cellular Fe status is essential. Hemerythrin domain proteins BTS(L) were described
  as Fe sensors of plant cells. Nevertheless, the complexity of Fe-status-connected
  responses in plant cells suggests the existence of multiple sensing and regulatory
  mechanisms, mediated by small molecules and Fe–S sensing mechanisms. Although the
  understanding of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cellular Fe homeostasis is
  far from complete, both DNA methylation by Domains Rearranged Methyltransferases
  (DRM) and histone modifications are important signals. For abbreviations and further
  details see the text.
