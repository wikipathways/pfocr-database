caption: Activation mechanism of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. When DNA damage
  occurs within cells (such as through viral infection, DNA destruction, or leakage
  of nuclear DNA), it results in a cellular environment rich in dsDNA fragments. These
  DNA fragments are detected by intracellular cGAS. Once cGAS detects DNA, it undergoes
  a conformational change, forming an active conformation. This active conformation
  allows for the binding of two ATP molecules and one GTP molecule to form cGAMP.
  The synthesized cGAMP is released by cGAS into the cytoplasm, where it binds to
  STING. Subsequently, STING also undergoes a conformational change, enabling it to
  bind to TBK1. The binding of TBK1 to STING activates TBK1, leading to the phosphorylation
  and activation of IRF3. Activated IRF3 translocates into the nucleus and cooperates
  with other transcription factors to promote the transcription and expression of
  type I interferon (IFN-I) genes. The activation of STING also triggers the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway. This activation may occur through a series of molecular events,
  such as the activation of IKK (IκB kinase), leading to the degradation of IκB (inhibitor
  of NF-κB protein), thereby releasing NF-κB and promoting its translocation into
  the nucleus, ultimately activating the transcription of NF-κB-responsive genes
