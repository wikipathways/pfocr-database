caption: Diverse mechanisms of inflammasome activation. The activation of the inflammasome
  by the canonical pathway relies on two signals, the first or the priming signal
  allowing transcription of inflammasome components, and the second or activating
  signal triggering the assembly of the complex. The inflammasome scaffolding receptors
  belong to different families (NLR, ALR and PYRIN), each recognizing different MAMPs
  or DAMPs. Caspase-1 is central in catalyzing inflammasome functions, cleaving pro-inflammatory
  cytokines into their bioactive form and gasdermin D (GSDMD) into an N-terminal pore
  forming domain that elicits pyroptosis. The non-canonical route is mediated by direct
  binding of LPS or phospholipids to caspase-4/-5 in humans or -11 in mice.
