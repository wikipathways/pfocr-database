caption: 'Hedgehog signaling pathway in vertebrates. The above model illustrates our
  current understanding of the vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) pathway signaling. Hh signaling
  cascade is initiated in the target cell by the Hh ligand binding to the Patched
  1 protein (PTCH), a 12-span transmembrane protein located on the plasma membrane.
  Smoothened (SMO), a 7-transmembrane-span protein receptor, is located on the membrane
  of the intracellular endosome. In mammalians, the Hh signaling takes place in the
  nonmotile cilia to which the SMO and other downstream pathway components transit
  to in order to activate the GLI transcription factors [; ; ; ]. An endogenous small
  molecule acting as a SMO agonist is transported outside the cell by PTCH, preventing
  its binding to SMO. In the absence of a Hh ligand, PTCH catalytically inhibits the
  activity of SMO by affecting its localization to the cell surface. Full-length GLI
  proteins are thus proteolytically processed to generate the repressor GLIR, largely
  derived from GLI 3, which represses Hh target genes. Binding of Hh to PTCH, internalizes
  and destabilizes PTCH, so that it can no longer transport the endogenous SMO agonist
  molecules outwards. Intracellular accumulation of this agonist molecule activates
  SMO which translocates to the plasma membrane, apparently concentrating in the cilia.
  Relief of SMO inhibition promotes generation of the activator GLIA, largely contributed
  by GLI 2 and the subsequent expression of the Hh target gene []. CK1α, casein kinase
