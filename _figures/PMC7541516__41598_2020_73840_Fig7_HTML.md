caption: Schematic representation of the proposed putative mechanism of action of
  NESF and NLP in the regulation of GH synthesis in the mammalian somatotrophs. While
  the GH-secretagogue ghrelin (GRL) activates the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to stimulate
  the synthesis of GH through a GPCR with a Gα-stimulatory subunit (Gαs), NESF and
  NLP prevent the activation of this signalling pathway by the adenylyl cyclase stimulator
  forskolin (FK). However, the phosphorylation of CREB is not compromised when the
  pathway is directly activated at the level of PKA by the cAMP-analog CPT. These
  results suggest that exogenous nucleobindin encoded peptides likely exert their
  effects by the inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase, possibly through a GPCR associated
  with a Gα-inhibitory subunit (Gαi). Figure created with BioRender.com tools.
