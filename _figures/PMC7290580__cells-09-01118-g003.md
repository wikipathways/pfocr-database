caption: 'Regulation of signaling pathways by cIAP-mediated degradation of TRAF2 and/or
  TRAF3. In standing state, the cIAPs/TRAF2/3 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex controls
  the cellular content NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) by mediating K43-linked ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. Stimulation of CD40-R (cluster of differentiation 40
  receptor), BAFF-R (B-cell activating factor receptor), TNFR2 (tumor necrosis factor
  Receptor 2), FN14 (Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14), or TLRs (toll-like receptors)
  promotes the recruitment of cIAPs/TRAFs complex to the receptor leading to the accumulation
  of NIK, phosphorylation of IKKα dimer, and activation of the non-canonical NF-κB
  pathway. In receptor-associated complex, TRAF2 can stimulate cIAPs via K63-linked
  ubiquitination. In turn, cIAPs catalyse the K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3
  and, in a lower level, TRAF2, causing their degradation and the formation of a secondary
  complex. Upon TLR stimulation, RIPK1/3 (receptor-interacting kinase 1/3) are also
  recruited to the receptor complex that can lead to the assembly of Ripoptosome and/or
  necrosome. Myd88: Myeloid differentiation primary response 88; TRIF: toll–interleukin
  1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β.'
