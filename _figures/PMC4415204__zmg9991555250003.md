caption: Effects of E2 and STX on hypothalamic POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons. Summary
  of how E2 excites POMC neurons and inhibits NPY/AgRP neurons via a Gαq-mER-mediated
  signaling pathway to regulate metabolism (A). Activation of the Gαq pathway attenuates
  the coupling of the GABAB receptor to GIRK channel activation in POMC neurons, thereby
  increasing the excitability, but enhances the GABAB receptor activation of GIRK
  channels in NPY/AgRP neurons, thereby decreasing their excitability. In NPY/AgRP
  neurons, ERα is also associated with the membrane, and its activation leads to attenuation
  of the GABAB receptor coupling to GIRK channels (B), which is hypothesized to be
  involved in the control of reproduction (see text for more details).
