caption: 'Central metabolic energy pathway in C. pasteurianum from glucose and glycerol.
  Figure based on  and . The knocked out genes (hydA, dhaBCE) and the NADH/NAD+ utilising
  pathways putatively influenced by Rex are highlighted. Other enzymes involved in
  the central energy pathway are numbered as follows: 1, glycerol dehydratase; 2,
  1,3-propanediol oxydoreductase. 3, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 4, dihydroxyacetone
  kinase; 5, triose-phosphate isomerase; 6, phosphofructokinase; 7, phosphoglucose
  isomerase; 8, hexokinase; 9, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 10, pyruvate
  kinase; 11, lactate dehydrogenase; 12, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase; 13, ferredoxin-NADP
  reductase; 14, NADPH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase; 15, ferredoxin hydrogenase; 16,
  phosphate acetyltransferase; 17, acetate kinase; 18, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase;
  19, ethanol dehydrogenase; 20, thiolase; 21, acetoacetyl-CoA: acetate:CoA transferase;
  22, acetoacetyl-CoA: butyrate:CoA transferase; 23, acetoacetate decarboxylase; 24,
  β -hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; 25, crotonase; 26, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  27, phosphotransbutyrylase; 28, butyrate kinase; 29, butaraldehyde dehydrogenase;
