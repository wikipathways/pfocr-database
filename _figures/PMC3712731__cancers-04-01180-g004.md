caption: Display of wild-type and disease pathway diagrams. (a) A cancer disease attribute,
  assigned to events involved in cancer, instructs the browser to hide disease events
  when a user selects to view a wild-type pathway. (b) When a user selects to view
  a disease pathway, disease events appear in the wild type diagram, while all normal
  events are shaded. All disease events and physical entities with disease tags are
  outlined in red for easier visualization.
