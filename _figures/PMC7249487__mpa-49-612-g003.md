caption: The summative mechanistic approach of cigarette smoking–induced PDAC is summarized
  in this diagram. It consists of the ability of cigarette smoke to change the microenvironment,
  cause long-standing inflammation, increase miRNA expression, induce KRAS mutations,
  affect signaling pathways, and alter enzyme secretion. Understanding the combined
  mechanistic pathway will yield positive outcomes in terms of drug discovery and
  reduced PDAC-related mortality.
