  breaks. (1) Upon DSB occurrence, the core histone protein variant H2AX is instantaneously
  phosphorylated on its S139 position to form γH2AX foci, which can be detected at
  the DSB site. γH2AX provides a platform to recruit DDR proteins, such as 53BP1,
  MDC1, and ATM, to DSBs to initiate DDR signal transduction. (2) DNA-dependent protein
  kinase (DNA-PK), composed of Ku70, Ku80, and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs, is
  a classical DSB-sensing and -binding complex. DSB binding by DNA-PK protects the
  broken DNA end from degradation by endogenous nucleases; on the other hand, it recruits
  and activates the downstream components in the NHEJ pathway of DSB repair. (3) BRCA1
  and BRCA2 are key proteins involved in DSB binding and initiating the HR pathway
  and later repair processing. BRCA2 directly recruits RAD51 to sites of DNA damage
  through interaction with conserved BRCT motifs to stabilize the RAD51 nucleoprotein
  filament on the ssDNA end of DSBs. Following end resection of the DSBs, BRCA1 activates
  RAD51 to promote gene conversion of homologous recombination. (4) The MRN complex
  (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) is the primary sensor of DSBs and localizes to damage sites to
  initiate end resection and HR processing. The MRN complex also promotes the recruitment
  and activation of ATM and PARP-1. PARP-1 produces poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and
  extends DNA damage signaling
