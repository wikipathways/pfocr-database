caption: The Hipathia program (http://hipathia.babelomics.org) detected a total of
  four effector circuits in two pathways, Cell Cycle and P53 signaling, that are used
  by both cancers to trigger DNA replication. Arrows in red represent activated circuits.
  Genes in red represent genes upregulated in the cancer with respect to the corresponding
  normal tissue; genes in blue represent downregulated genes and genes with no color
  were not differentially expressed. Squares at the end of the circuit represent the
  cell functions triggered by the circuits. A. Cell Cycle signaling pathway in KIRC
  with three effector circuits activated (highlighted), one of them ending in the
  node containing proteins CDC6, ORC3, ORC5, ORC4, ORC2, ORC1 and ORC6, the second
  one ending in node with proteins CDC45, MCM7, MCM6, MCM5, MCM4, MCM3 and MCM2 and
  the last one ending in node with proteins ORC3, ORC5, ORC4, ORC2, ORC1, ORC6, MCM7,
  MCM6, MCM5, MCM4, MCM3 and MCM2. B. P53 signaling pathway in BRCA with the effector
  circuit ending in protein RRM2B highlighted. C. Cell Cycle pathway in BRCA with
  the same effector circuits activated that in KIRC, but using a different set of
  gene activations. D. P53 signaling pathway in BRCA with the same effector circuit
  activated that in KIRC, but using a different set of gene activations.
