caption: The combination of RRM2 silencing and radiotherapy promotes the activation
  of cGAS/STING signaling pathway in LUAD cells. Knockdown RRM2 increases DNA damage
  accompanies by the increase of dsDNA in cytoplasm. Radiation also induces dsDNA
  accumulation in cytoplasm. The dsDNA fragments activate cGAS and then upregulate
  STING. Activated STING promotes the phosphorylation of IRF3. This triggers their
  translocation into the nucleus and results in the increased transcription and secretion
  of type I IFN genes, including IFNβ, CCL5 and CXCL10
