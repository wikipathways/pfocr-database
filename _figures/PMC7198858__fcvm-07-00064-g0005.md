caption: Neuroimmune communication in inflammation. Afferent neurons monitor peripheral
  immune status by sensing PAMPs, such as LPS; DAMPs, such as ATP; and cytokines,
  such as TNF-α and IL-1β (). Efferent nerves release neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline
  and acetylcholine (ACh), which directly or indirectly activate a variety of immune
  cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. Within the best-studied
  circuit of neuroimmune communication, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,
  inflammation in the periphery is detected by afferent vagal neurons. The information
  is processed in the brainstem, initiating the efferent arm of anti-inflammatory
  pathway. Within the spleen, noradrenaline released from efferent nerves activates
  β2-adrenergic receptors on choline acetyltransferase-expressing T cells. The affected
  T cells in turn release ACh, which suppresses TNF-α production in nicotinic α7-nicotinic
  receptor-expressing macrophages, in part by inhibiting NF-κB signaling (, ). Other
  stimuli that also activate the anti-inflammatory pathway includes PI3 kinase activation
  within inulin-expressing neurons ().
