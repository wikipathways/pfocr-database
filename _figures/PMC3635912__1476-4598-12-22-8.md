caption: Hypothesis for the assembly of CD63/β1-integrins/Timp1 complex along melanoma
  genesis. In the absence of Timp1, almost no association between CD63 and β1-integrins
  occurs in melan-a melanocytes, which might contribute to their anoikis sensitivity.
  The presence of these molecules in pre-malignant 4C melanocytes and 4C11- and 4C11+
  melanoma cells result in the formation of CD63/β1-integrins/Timp1 complex and acquisition
  of anoikis-resistant phenotype. The absence of physical interaction between Timp1
  and β1-integrins might result in a less efficient survival transduction pathway,
  differently of what is seen in melanoma cell lines, in which this complex seems
  to be more tightly assembled.
papertitle: Timp1 interacts with beta-1 integrin and CD63 along melanoma genesis and
  confers anoikis resistance by activating PI3-K signaling pathway independently of
  Akt phosphorylation.
