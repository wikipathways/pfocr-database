caption: Schematic diagrams illustrating the function of lncRNAs in lymphoma cells.
  Various studies have determined diverse mechanisms of function by lncRNAs. (A) A
  high number of lncRNAs leads to the stabilization of mRNA by binding to miRNA. (B)
  LncRNA can act as a miRNA precursor. (C) LncRNAs have been known to regulate gene
  expression through a mechanism involving interaction with the PRC pathway. Generally,
  lncRNAs are imperative for lymphoma carcinogenesis by affecting apoptosis, cell
  proliferation, cell cycle, migration, invasion of lymphoma cells, and chemotherapy
  response.
