caption: 'BA synthesis and transport pathway. BAs are taken up by NTCP, OST‐α, and
  OST‐β on the hepatocyte basolateral membrane, as well as synthesized from cholesterol
  by CYP7A1, followed by transport into canaliculi by the BSEP. Other constituents
  of bile include phosphatidylcholine, transported by canalicular MDR3, and phosphatidylserine,
  shuttled by canalicular ATP8B1. The TJP2 maintains the canalicular membrane and
  inhibits the reflux of BA back into the hepatocyte. The master regulator of BA metabolism
  is FXR, which is induced by BA and activates SHP, leading to inhibition of both
  NTCP transport of BA into the hepatocyte and CYP7A1‐induced synthesis of BA, and
  stimulates BSEP export of BA. The protein defects associated with the various PFIC
  types are highlighted with a black outline. (Not shown is MYO5B, which interacts
  with RAB11A, altering the targeting of BSEP to the canalicular membrane.) Approximately
  95% of Bas are taken up by the ASBT on the ileal enterocyte and enter the portal
  circulation through enterocyte transporters OST‐α, OST‐β, and MRP3, resulting in
  enterohepatic recirculation of BAs. BAs also induce enterocyte FXR, leading to FGF19/FGFR4
  activation with downstream inhibition of CYP7A1‐induced BA synthesis. Adapted with
