caption: Platelet CD36 redox signaling in arterial thrombosis. Platelet CD36 has multiple
  ligands including oxidized lipids in lipoprotein particles, advanced glycated end
  products, thrombospondin, long chain fatty acids, P. falciparum-infected red cells,
  myeloid-related protein 14 (S100A9; MRP14), components of bacterial cell wall, apoptotic
  cells and microparticles, and beta amyloid. The best-characterized CD36 ligand is
  oxidized phospholipid present in oxLDL. Recognition of these ligands by CD36 at
  the surface of the cell promotes two downstream signaling pathway within platelets.
  One is through desensitization of the cAMP and cGMP signaling pathway that are the
  major inhibitory pathways within platelets, and the other is through downstream
  ROS signaling. The effects of ROS are multifaceted and include oxidative cysteine
  modification of Src family tyrosine kinases to enhance kinase activity and increase
  the activation of big MAP kinase ERK5 for a pro-aggregatory and pro-coagulant platelet
  phenotype. In macrophages and endothelial cells, CD36-mediated ROS generation inactivates
  specific mixed phosphatases including SHP-1 and SHP-2, resulting in prolonged activation
  of downstream kinases. In addition, CD36 alters mitochondrial metabolism within
  macrophages into a pro-inflammatory, pro-atherogenic, and ROS-generating organelle.
  We hypothesize similar mechanisms within platelets for phosphatase inactivation
  and mitochondrial dysfunction to enhance prothrombotic kinase activity and oxidative
  stress in dyslipidemia. It is also possible that ROS generated through CD36 activation
  participates in desensitizing the inhibitory pathways through oxidative cysteine
  modification. Created with BioRender.com and accessed on 4 January 2024. ?, hypothesized
