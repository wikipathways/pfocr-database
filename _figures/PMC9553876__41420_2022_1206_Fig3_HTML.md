caption: The classical effect of TTFields is mitosis inhibitions and formation of
  apocyte. A TTFields induces various mode of tumor cell death, including apoptosis,
  autophagy, pyroptosis, immunogenic death, necrosis, necroptosis, and cell cycle
  arrest. Meanwhile, TTFields affects the integrity of membrane and the blood-brain
  barrier, increasing permeability of tumor cell. B TTFields induces activation of
  dendritic cell, RAW264.7. In addition, TTFields leads to T cell infiltration and
  CD45 + leukocyte enrichment. Meanwhile, T1IRG-expressing monocyte, NK cell and immune
  checkpoints are elevated after TTFields treatment.
