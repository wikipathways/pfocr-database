caption: Piezo1-induced autocrine, paracrine, and paratensile effectors in activated
  fibroblasts. Increased Piezo1 activity can activate the p38 MAPK pathway with enhanced
  IL-6 secretion. IL-6 acts as a paracrine effector on cardiomyocytes, as well as
  an autocrine effector for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts themselves. Calcium-stimulated
  ECM synthesis culminates in the activation of new fibroblasts through a paratensile
  manner. However, Piezo1-stimulated TGF-β activation enhances ECM synthesis and acts
  not only as an autocrine effector but also as an indirect paratensile one. Created
