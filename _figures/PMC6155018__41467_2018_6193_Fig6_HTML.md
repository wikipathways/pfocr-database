caption: Model of OM’s effect on cardiac myosin. (1) OM increases the rate of entry
  into strong binding as previously measured by phosphate release rates, but the force
  generating power stroke is inhibited. (2) Myosin remains strongly bound to actin
  (red bar), contributing to increased thin-filament activation at intermediate calcium
  concentrations. (3) OM disrupts the typical pathway of myosin, causing it to pass
  through an ADP or apo (nucleotide-free) state with its lever arm still in the pre-power
  stroke position. (4) Myosin detaches from actin without needing to bind ATP. ATP
  binding must occur before the cycle can start again
