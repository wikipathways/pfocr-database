caption: Some cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. Extracellular
  mediators and cells (platelets) are highlighted in yellow, cell surface receptors
  and ion channels in purple, intracellular signaling in blue and nuclear responses
  in green. See text for detailed descriptions of pathogenic mechanisms and interactions
  among the many pathways that span the extracellular, membrane, cytosolic and nuclear
  domains. VEGF indicates vascular endothelial growth factor; its receptor is KDR.
  Intracellular transduction of this pathway is poorly understood. Endothelin is vasoactive
  and a mitogen, acting through Ca2 + channels and ERK/Jun kinases. Tyrosine kinase
  is the angiopoietin receptor, a system found to be upregulated in pulmonary vascular
  disease.56 Alk 1 and BMPR1-2 are receptors of the TGF-β superfamily, and BMP indicates
  bone morphogenetic protein. Alk 1 mutations cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
  and some cases of Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Epidermal growth factor
  (EGF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, angiotensin II (ANGII) and platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF) are all proliferative stimuli that act through tyrosine kinase
  receptors and are partially transduced by intracellular oxidant species. In the
  intracellular domain, SMADs are regulatory proteins that activate nuclear transcription
  factors and interact with MAP kinases. AML 1 is a nuclear transcription factor of
  potential importance. Elastase, downstream of AML 1, has been implicated in vascular
  disease in experimental animals. Viral proteins are found in vascular lesions in
  the lungs of patients with PAH, raising the possibility that they participate in
  its pathogenesis. Reprinted with permission from
