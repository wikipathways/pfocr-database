caption: HSV-1 mediates innate immune signalling and escape strategies. IFN-I and
  inflammatory cytokines induce antiviral immunity, whereas HSV-1 proteins can hijack
  multiple steps downstream of the TLRs, RLRs, and DNA sensor signalling pathways.
  TLRs are located at the plasma membrane and in the nuclear endosomes, where they
  sense different ligands such as viral dsRNA, dsDNA, and glycoproteins and switch
  signals through TRIF and MyD88, which then leads to activation of IRF and NF-κB.
  Various viral proteins, including ICP0, US3, UL36USP, ICP4, and VP16 are sufficient
  to abrogate the TLR signalling pathway. rig-I and MDA5 in the RLR receptor detect
  distinct RNA structures and signals through the junction protein MAVS protein, triggering
  IRF3 and nf-κB activation. US11, UL36USP, and UL37 block MDA5 and RIG-I-mediated
  antiviral signalling pathways. Cytoplasmic DNA sensors, such as cGAS, IFI16, DDX41,
  and DAI, recognize double-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm and trigger the production
  of IFN-I through STING signalling. VP22, UL37, and UL41 can directly interact with
  cGAS and inhibit its enzymatic activity, subsequently inhibiting downstream signalling.
  ICP0, ICP27, ICP34.5, US3, US11, VP16, VP24, and UL46 interrupt signal transduction
  at the level of the TBK1-IRF3 axis. US3, ICP0, UL24, VP16, ORF61, UL42, and VP24
  interrupt signal transduction at the level of the TBK1-nf-κB axis. HSV-1 also affects
  NLRP3 inflammatory factor assembly, which in turn inhibits IL-1β and IL-1B-mediated
  apoptosis. Black lines indicate cellular processes. Red lines indicate processes
  regulated by HSV
