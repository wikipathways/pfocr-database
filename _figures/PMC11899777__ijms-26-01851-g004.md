caption: 'FcγRIIIb signaling pathway (NETosis pathway, red lines and arrows): Due
  to the lack of ITAMs, the initial steps of signaling are not yet known in detail;
  however, part of the signaling pathway associated with the formation of NETs has
  recently been described. The signaling in neutrophils of SLE patients might start
  from the immune complexes of autoantibodies (the figure represents autoantibody
  complexes with autoantigens like double-stranded DNA or nuclear proteins, which
  is common in SLE.) binding to the receptor. Currently, what is known about the pathway
  has been obtained from in vitro tests. Upon FcγRIIIb IC binding or receptor activation,
  the Syk and TAK 1 kinases are activated. These enzymes trigger the MEK/ERK signaling
  cascade. ERK signaling leads to the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex for
  ROS production, which is required to induce NET formation. PKC is involved in MEK/ERK
  pathway activation. Also, the nuclear factor Elk-1 gets phosphorylated in the nucleus
  by a mechanism independent of ERK. The FcγRIIIb activation promotes a pro-adhesive
  phenotype and enhances NETs; the contribution to phagocytosis is minimal, and phosphorylation
  of ERK is much more efficient in the nucleus. It favors the expression of beta 2
  integrins. FcγRs signaling pathways: FcγRs activating receptors bind to immune complexes,
  facilitating cross-linking and intracytoplasmic activation, for which tyrosine kinases
  of the Src family are activated and phosphorylate tyrosine residues in ITAM on the
  alpha chains of the receptor. Syk, an enzyme with tyrosine kinase activity, is activated
  by Src. SYK phosphorylates multiple substrates, including SOS a guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor that activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway, which facilitates
  the exchange of GDP by GTP in Ras. Ras, a GTPase enzyme, activates Raf, which then
  phosphorylates and activates MEK, which, in turn, phosphorylates ERK. ERK activates
  NF-κB. FcγRIIa (Phagocytosis pathway, blue lines and arrows): Additionally, Syk
  activates PI3K, which produces PIP3 from the phosphorylation of PIP2 in the cell
  membrane, then PIP3 binds to BTK, a kinase that activates small GTPases, such as
  Rho and Rac. These GTPases are involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton
  during phagocytosis. In addition, PIP3 activates PLCγ, which produces the second
  messengers DAG and IP3. DAG activates PKC. PKC activates the NADPH-oxidase complex
  to produce ROS. IP3 binds to IP3R in the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ into
  the cytoplasm. Finally, this señalización promotes a phagocytic phenotype, cytosol
  phosphorylation of ERK, oxidative stress, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(depending
  on the cell type). Abbreviations or molecule’s function: A question mark (?) indicates
  an unknown mechanism of activation. Syk: spleen tyrosine kinase; TAK 1: TGF-beta
  activated kinase 1; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; PKC: protein kinase C; Sos: son of sevenless (a guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor); Ras: a GTPase; Raf: a serine/threonine kinase; Elk-1: ETS-like gene 1,
