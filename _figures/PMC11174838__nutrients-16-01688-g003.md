caption: (A) Following regular resistance exercise and EAA treatment, a decrease in
  myostatin and TNF-α and an increase in IRISIN activate the mTOR signaling pathway
  → increasing muscle mass through a decrease in inflammation and the activation of
  protein synthesis. (B) Compared to EAA intake or resistance exercise alone, EAA
  intake and resistance exercise appear to be more positive for improving muscle quality
  and myokines. Therefore, a combined treatment of resistance exercise and EAA can
  be recommended to maintain health in adults because it has a synergistic effect
  in improving muscle synthesis, myokines, and inflammation factors
