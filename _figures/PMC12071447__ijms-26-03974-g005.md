caption: 'A model of BMP4’s effect on diverse glioblastoma cells—a multifaceted response.
  Upon the receptor binding of BMP4, the activation of the canonical SMAD complex
  initiates a bifurcation of the pathway into a SOX2-inhibitory branch and a p21-activating
  pathway. Consequently, proliferation is inhibited while cellular growth is promoted.
  This cell-cycle arrest yields different outcomes depending on the cellular state:
  smaller PN-like GBM cells, characterized by lower basal levels of p21 yet higher
  SOX2 expression, may preferentially opt for differentiation, as evidenced by astrocytic
  GFAP upregulation (Supplementary Figure S3J,K). Conversely, larger p21 high-expressing
  MES-like GBM cells display a higher propensity to undergo senescence in response
  to BMP4. This senescence-promoting program is characterized by the upregulation
  of genes, such as pro-inflammatory genes, which are already expressed at elevated
  levels in these cells compared to their PN counterparts. Importantly, the documented
  multitherapy-resistant nature of MES-like GBM cells [6] makes their propensity to
  enter senescence a significant therapeutic opportunity, enabling their targeted
  elimination through senolytic drug treatment'
