caption: Schematic diagram depicting the mechanisms of 5-aza-dC treatment in inhibiting
  choroidal neovascularization in a laser-induced mouse model. During laser-induced
  CNV, VEGFA promotes expression of DNMTs and hypermethylation of the Notum promoter
  by binding to VEGF receptor in choroid/retinal endothelial cell. Because it is a
  Wnt antagonist, downregulation of Notum leads to Wnt pathway hyperactivation and
  subsequently endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and hyperpermeability (left
  panel). Inversely, 5-aza-dC administration reverses the effects of VEGFA on endothelial
  cell and inhibits CNV formation (right panel)
