caption: The schematic representation of the regulatory mechanism about PLOD2 was
  summarized. (a) The schematic representation of the regulatory mechanism about PLOD2
  was summarized based on this study. PLOD2 can be regulated by transcription factor
  FOXA1 via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. Meanwhile,
  PLOD2 promotes NSCLC metastasis directly by enhancing migration and indirectly by
  inducing collagen reorganization. (b) The schematic representation of PLOD2 is summarized
  based on previous reports of the regulatory mechanism and this study. Previous reports
  showed that PLOD2 could be regulated by tumor growth factor-α (TGF-β) and hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α (HIF-1α), whereas TGF-β and HIF-1α can also activate the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. Therefore, it is suggested that PLOD2 may be a potential therapeutic target
  that can be regulated by several oncogenes via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
