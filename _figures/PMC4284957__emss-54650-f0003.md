caption: 'Top panel: the bi-directionally transcribed locus is intact. To run the
  control cycle, both sense and antisense transcripts are produced (1). Since the
  transcripts become fully processed, they can both persist as mRNAs (2a) or form
  RNA hybrids and feed into the RNAi pathway (2b). The resulting endo-siRNAs combine
  with Argonautes (most probably a non-slicing isoform such as Ago4) (3). According
  to the availability of target sequence, here the full-length sense and antisense
  transcripts, RISCs are formed (4). The spare Argonaute–endo-siRNA complexes (pre-RISC)
  will find the target sequence at the transcribed locus and induce transcriptional
  silencing (5). Bottom panel: the control cycle with a mutated sense transcript (μντ).
  The initial steps are identical with the top panel (1, 2 and 3); however, the mutation
  causes reduced levels of the full-length sense transcript (4). This could be the
  result of reduced transcription or transcript instability for example. As a consequence,
  pre-RISCs against the mutated transcript will reach the site of transcription and
  induce the silencing of the sense RNA (5) [].'
