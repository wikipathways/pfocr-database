caption: From left to right, the subnetworks correspond to adipose, muscle, and liver
  respectively. The subnetworks in the top level correspond to normal condition (WKY),
  and the subnetworks in disease condition (GK) are listed at the bottom level. Genes
  from WKY tissues are colored in white, while in green/red according to down/up-regulated
  sitations in GK. Given one tissue, all the differential interactions in IR pathway
  are casted to normal or disease strain. A green edge means that the corresponding
  two genes are strongly and negatively correlated, while red one indicates strongly
  positive correlation. The gray edges mean that though they are not differential
  interactions, but their two nodes (genes) are simultaneously differentially expressed.
