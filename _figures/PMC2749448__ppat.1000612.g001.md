caption: The enzyme names are for C. albicans but some have not been directly characterized
  and are annotated based on S. cerevisiae homology. Genes bound and activated by
  Gal4p and Tye7p are in red, genes bound and activated mainly by Tye7p are in blue,
  and genes bound and activated mainly by Gal4p are in green. Genes in black are not
  bound and activated by either factor. For simplicity, “*” represents reactions requiring
  ATP, “**” represents reactions producing ATP, and “***” represents reactions generating
  NADH. These symbols are given for reactions of the glycolytic pathway only.
