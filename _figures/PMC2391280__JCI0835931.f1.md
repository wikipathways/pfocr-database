caption: (A) Indicated are the 5 SNPs within the AKT1 locus that were examined by
  Emamian et al. (), as well as by Tan et al. in their current study in this issue
  of the JCI (). The rs1130233 SNP that reduces expression of AKT1 appears in red.
  AKT1 has 16 exons (boxes). Coding sequence (blue boxes) flanked by the start (ATG)
  and stop (TGA) codons as well as expressed noncoding sequence (white boxes) are
  indicated. (B) AKT is a key node for various signaling systems. DA in the cortex
  is inactivated by COMT and activates DRD1-coupled cAMP signaling whereas DRD2 decreases
  cAMP levels and inhibits AKT activity via β-arrestin2. GABA, glutamate (GLU), and
  various growth factors (GFs) also modulate AKT activity via PI3K, resulting in alterations
  in synaptic growth and transmission. (C) These combined effects on DA modulation
  and synaptic connectivity may alter the function of cells (circles) within neuronal
  circuits important for cognitive function. The caudate of the basal ganglia plays
  a critical role in gating information and restricting access to working memory,
  which relies on proper connections among cortical neurons in the PFC. The gating
  of information itself is heavily dependent on DA transmission, which originates
  from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). One possible, although probably oversimplified,
  scenario is that sensitization to DA via DRD2 may lead to psychotic symptoms and,
  coupled with altered neuronal connectivity and decreased DRD1 signaling, also contribute
  to cognitive dysfunction. Dashed lines represent the functional impairments resulting
  from the SNP4-dependent attenuation of AKT1 expression and signaling.
