caption: C-peptide-initiated signaling cascades. C-peptide is associated with the
  regulation of several signaling cascades, including phospholipase C (PLC) and the
  NF-κB pathway. These intracellular signaling events are likely mediated by a G protein-coupled
  receptor such as GPR146, which has been shown to be necessary for C-peptide signaling
  in KATOIII cells. GPR146 interacts with an as yet unknown G protein, which could
  be either Gαi or Gαo, since several of the cellular actions of C-peptide were shown
  to be pertussis toxin sensitive. GPR146 may interact physically with additional
  proteins on the cell membrane, such as an integrin (green box). C-peptide and insulin
  appear to functionally interact, particularly at the level of Akt. Akt, protein
  kinase B; Ca++, calcium ion; eNOS, endothelial NO synthase; ERK1/2, extracellular
