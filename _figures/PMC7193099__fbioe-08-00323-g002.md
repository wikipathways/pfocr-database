caption: The role of Hippo pathway in heart development and homeostasis. (A) When
  Hippo pathway is on, the mammalian MST1/2 (STE20-like protein kinase 1/2) and SAV1
  (protein salvador homolog 1) complex activates LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor homolog
  1/2) that phosphorylates, in association with MOB1 (MOB kinase activator 1), YAP
  (Yes-associated protein 1) and TAZ (WW domain-containing transcription regulator
  protein 1), thus promoting their degradation. Conversely, when Hippo signaling is
  off, YAP and TAZ shuttle into the nucleus where they bind TEADs (TEA domain transcription
  factor family members) and regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell
  proliferation, survival and migration (). By regulating the activity of YAP and
  consequently the proliferation of prenatal cardiomyocytes, Hippo pathway regulates
  heart size during development. YAP inhibitory kinase TAOK1 (TAO kinase 1) and E3
  ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP (β-transducin repeats-containing protein) are involved in
  YAP degradation. Their silencing has been reported to increase YAP activity in cardiomyocytes
  (). (B) Increased YAP activity has been associated with several pro-regenerative
  effects in developed heart to prevent cardiac diseases or promoting restoration
  after MI, as indicated in the table ().
