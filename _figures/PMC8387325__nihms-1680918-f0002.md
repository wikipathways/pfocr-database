caption: Animals ingest bacteria (yellow) that sometimes colonize the gut. Microbial
  colonization of pathogenic bacteria may induce intestinal bloating, which induces
  NPR-1 neuropeptide signaling to promote aversion of the pathogenic bacteria (red
  signaling pathway), based on . Non-pathogenic colonizing Providencia strains produce
  tyramine (L-Tyr) that may be converted to octopamine within the worm and signal
  through the octopamine receptor (OCTR-1) expressed by ASH sensory neurons to modulate
  avoidance of octanol and influence food choice (green signaling pathway), based
  on . Sensation of the odor 2-butanone inhibits the AWCon chemosensory neuron, which
  inhibits AIY interneuron from releasing FLP-1/FMRFamide neuropeptides that can signal
  to the intestine through the NPR-4/NPY receptor, SGK-1/SGK1 kinase, and DAF-16/FOXO
  transcription factor to control lipid homeostasis (purple pathway), based on .
