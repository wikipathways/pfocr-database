caption: 'effect of lipoxins on cytoplasmic signaling cascades and transcription factors.Notes:
  Lipoxin binds to its G protein-coupled receptor ALX/Formyl peptidyl receptor triggering
  a wide array of cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Binding of lipoxin to its receptor
  ALX prevents binding of other pro-inflammatory ligands like SAA. Lipoxins could
  have alternative effects on PI3K and AKT pathway depending on the cell type. Lipoxins
  can control proliferation of immune cells and cancer cells by inhibiting growth
  promoting PI3K and AKT pathways. Lipoxins act to resolve inflammation by activating
  PI3K and AKT in macrophages to increase their life span. Lipoxin modulates levels
  of neutrophil for effective mounting and resolution of inflammation. They recruit
  neutrophils at the site of inflammation by increasing the cytosolic calcium levels
  and initiating pseudopodia movement, and at the same time control their proliferation
  by blocking MPO. Lipoxin controls synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  by increasing the mRNA level of suppressors of cytokine signaling and prevent transcription
  of inflammatory cytokines like IL-8 by inhibiting nuclear accumulation of NFκB and
  AP-1. Lipoxins are anti-angiogenic by blocking TNFα signaling. Lipoxins control
  the expression of inflammatory genes by decreasing levels of NFκB and AP-1 in the
  nucleus and increasing the levels of NAB1, Nrf2, and PPARγ. Green arrows indicate
  induction and red arrows indicate reduction in expression. Black lines indicate
  downstream biological events.Abbreviations: AP-1, activator protein-1; DAG, diacyl-glycerol;
  EGR1, early growth response 1 gene; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
