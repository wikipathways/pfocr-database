caption: 'Mechanisms of Treg suppression. Contact-dependent mechanisms: Induction
  of apoptosis via engagement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programed
  cell death 1 (PD1), granzyme A/B, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),
  the Fas/Fas-ligand pathway, the galectin-9/T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3
  (TIM-3) pathway and through IL-2 deprivation. Interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligand
  CD80/86 on antigen presenting cells (APCs) delivers a negative signal that prevents
  T cell activation. Cell surface lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) binds to MHC
  class II molecules preventing the maturation and the ability of APCs to activate
  effector T cells. Expression of membrane-bound active TGFβ-1. Disruption of metabolic
  pathways through the production of adenosine from the ectoenzymes CD39/CD73-mediated
  degradation of extracellular ATP to AMP. ATP-derived adenosine increases intracellular
  cAMP levels on Tregs that is transferred to T effector cells through gap junctions,
  leading to the upregulation of inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) and in turn,
  the inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and IL-2 transcription.
  Contact-independent mechanisms: Anti-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-10, IL-35,
  and TGF-β) has been linked with inhibition of T cell activation in vivo. Transfer
  of micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) through exosomes can silence specific genes in
  T effector cells, preventing proliferation and cytokine production.'
