caption: Once LPS from Gram-negative bacteria is recognized by TLR4, the TLR4-MyD88
  pathway is triggered, and early-phase TNFα expression is initiated through the activation
  of NF-κB and MAPKs. Activation of PKCε results in activation of TRAM-TRIF, which
  is responsible for late-phase TNFα and type I interferon (i.e., IFN-α/β) expression.
  Concurrently, IL-32γ binds to PR3 and activates PAR2. PAR2-Ras and -TRIF pathways
  potentially induce TNFα expression, and the latter pathway in particular induces
  type I interferon expression via IRF3/7. At that time, TAG is synthesized to terminate
  TLR4-TRIF signaling, with TRIF preferentially recruited to PAR2 instead. Following
  LPS-induced TNFα expression mainly through TLR4, LPS-induced IL-32γ-PAR2 signaling
  gradually increases type I interferon expression, which potentially translates innate
  to adaptive immunity, or ceases a series of LPS-induced acute inflammation.
