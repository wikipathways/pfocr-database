caption: Graph representation of the ornithine biosynthetic pathway. In ornithine
  biosynthesis, l-ornithine (l-Orn) is synthesized from l-glutamate (l-Glu) through
  five reactions. Red arrows indicate the transfer of the carbon skeleton of l-glutamate,
  blue arrows indicate the transfer of acetyl moiety, and green arrows indicate the
  transfer of a nitrogen atom from l-glutamate. (Left) In the traditional metabolic
  map, multiple substrates and products are involved in each reaction, and their structural
  relationships are implicit. (Right) In our graph representation, physically related
  metabolites are linked with atomic mappings (red and blue arrows), and each reaction
  corresponds to a set of mappings (orange links). Note that the mapping between l-glutamate
  and N-acetyl l-glutamate (N-Ace l-Glu) is shared by two reactions (EC 2.3.1.1 and
  EC 2.3.1.35). The mapping between l-ornithine and N-acetyl l-ornithine (N-Ace l-Orn)
  is also shared. p, Phosphate; sa, semialdehyde.
