caption: Mechanism of action of cytotoxic lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)
  and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1) (Brahmer et al.,
  ; Topalian et al., ; Tsai and Hsu, ). CTLA-4 plays role in de novo immune stimulation
  during antigen priming by antigen presenting cells (APCs), macrophages and dendritic
  cells (DCs). Following antigen exposure, CTLA-4 is expressed on T cells and competes
  with CD 28 for binding at B7 (B7-1/CD 80 and B7-2/CD 86) on APCs. This generates
  inhibitory signals for T-cells which shuts off antigen priming by APCs in the tumor
  draining lymph nodes. CTLA-4 inhibitors namely ipilimumab and tremelimumab restores
  antigen priming by blocking CTLA-4 on T cells. On the other hand PD-1/PD-L1 axis
  plays important role in the adaptive resistance by tumors cells against host immune
  system. PD-1 is expressed on immune cells like T-cells, B-cells and monocytes. The
  expression of PD-L1 is upregulated on tumor cells and APCs in response to interferon
  gamma secreted from activated T-cells via activation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway. PDL-2
  is also a ligand for PD-1 and is exclusively expressed on DCs. Engagement of PD-L1/L2
  by PD-1 inhibits proliferation, migration and effector functions of T-cells. This
  effect is blunted by PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors
  (atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab).
