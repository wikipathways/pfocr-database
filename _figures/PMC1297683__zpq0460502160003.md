caption: 'The final network resulting from applications of our integration method
  to the 18 types of evidence for yeast galactose utilization and a set of network
  analysis tools. This network model recapitulates many known features of galactose
  metabolism (e.g., GAL regulon induction; see text). Also, it provides a number of
  insights into regulatory interactions between different metabolic modules. For example,
  we note a possible mechanistic explanation of how fructose metabolism (BM12) is
  down-regulated in galactose: Gal4p contributes to a decrease in fructose uptake
  by repressing the fructose transporter Hxt7p via Mth1p (see text). The legends for
  nodes and edges in the network are as follows: (i) TFs in nucleus are represented
  by yellow diamonds; (ii) all other proteins (circles) are located according to their
  subcellular localizations (plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus); (iii) circle
  colors represent increase (green), decrease (red), and no significant change (yellow)
  in expression when the carbon source is changed from raffinose to galactose; (iv)
  the three numbered squares shown at the right represent complexes; and (v) blue
  edges represent PP interactions and multicolored edges in the nucleus represent
  PD interactions. Short colored arrows in the cytosol represent the increase (green)
  and decrease (red) in pathway fluxes. Biomodules are labeled with BM, and the short
  black arrows represent communication between the 9 modules selected for this subnetwork
  and the remaining 11 modules (Fig. 11).'
