caption: 'A) Two biosynthetic routes for the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)
  are schematically represented with a focus on the source of HMP-P. Gene products
  are indiecatead by the reactions they catalyze. Those depicted in blue are present
  in S. enterica and not L. pnuemophila. Those in red, are found in L. pnuemophila
  and other organisms as described in the text. In S. enterica, ThiC converts 5’-aminoimidizole
  ribotide (AIR) into HMP-P, while Thi5 synthesizes HMP-P from histidine and a B6
  vitamer. Incorporation of atoms derived from histidine and the B6 vitamer into HMP-P
  are shown (, , ). B) Two pathways for PLP biosynthesis are schematically represented
  with emphasis on the final steps. Enzymes belonging to the DXP-dependent pathway
  are highlighted in red, and exemplified by S. enterica. PdxH is present in many
  organisms as part of a salvage pathway and its presence does not indicate the DXP-dependent
  pathway is present. The enzymes of the DXP-independent pathway are highlighted in
  green and exemplified by S. cerevisiae (Snz/Sno) and B. subtilis (PdxS/PdxT). C)
  Organization of the thiamine biosynthetic locus in L. pneumophila. The putative
  annotations and locus tags for coding regions homologous with other thiamine biosynthetic
  enzymes are shown. The TPP riboswitch in the 5’UTR of lpg1565 is indicated (). Abbreviations:
