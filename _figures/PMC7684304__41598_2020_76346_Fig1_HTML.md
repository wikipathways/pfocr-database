caption: Proposed regulation pattern of betaine, choline, and TMAO in (A) patients
  with chronic kidney disease (CKD); (B) CKD-protected, hibernating, free-ranging
  brown bears; and (C) CKD-prone carnivorous felids, e.g. tigers. In patients with
  CKD (A), high levels of trimethylamine (TMA) N-oxide (TMAO) and choline are detectable,
  whereas betaine levels are low. Dietary intake of phosphatidyl-choline, betaine,
  TMA, TMAO, and L-Carnitine contribute to circulating metabolite levels. Gut microbiota
  can metabolize choline and L-Carnitine to TMA. After intestinal uptake of TMA, hepatic
  flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) convert TMA into TMAO which exerts adverse
  cardiometabolic effects. TMAO levels in CKD are especially elevated due to an increased
  microbial TMA conversion (i.e. gut microbiota dysbiosis), as well as a reduced renal
  excretion of TMAO. In hibernating, free-ranging brown bears (B), there is no food
  intake and betaine, choline, and TMAO are endogenously produced. Based on our data,
  we propose a metabolic switch favouring betaine rather than TMAO synthesis due to
  increased betaine conversion from choline and reduced gut microbiota-caused TMA
  production. In carnivorous animals, e.g. tigers (C), dietary intake of phosphatidylcholine,
  betaine, TMA, TMAO, and L-Carnitine contribute to circulating metabolite levels.
  Similar to patients with CKD, a metabolic switch favours TMA production by gut microbiota
  resulting in high TMAO levels that might be involved in the high CKD prevalence
  of carnivorous felids. Arrow size depicts increased or decreased activation of the
  respective pathway.
