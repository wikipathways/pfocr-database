caption: The processing of engulfed dying cells requires LC3-associated phagocytosis
  (LAP) and promotes an anti-inflammatory response. Upon engulfment of dying cells,
  components of the LAP pathway are recruited to dead cell-containing phagosome (or
  LAPosome). The class III PI3 K complex, comprised of Beclin 1, VPS34, UVRAG, and
  Rubicon, is critical to the sustained and localized production of PI(3)P at the
  LAPosome. PI(3)P serves two roles – the recruitment of the downstream LAP machinery
  (such as ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L, and ATG7) and stabilization of the NOX2 complex for
  the production of ROS. Rubicon is also required for the stabilization of the NOX2
  complex. Both ROS and PI(3)P are required for successful LC3-II decoration of the
  LAPosome, and LC3-II is required for fusion to the lysosome and maturation of LAPosome.
  The anti-inflammatory effects of efferocytosis are mediated by the activity of lipid
  and cholesterol sensors, such as ABCA1, LXR, PPARγ/δ, and PGC-1β, leading to the
  production of IL-10 and TGFβ, whereas pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-12,
  are actively repressed
