caption: Model for the regulation of BCFA synthesis in response to different temperatures
  in S. piezotolerans WP3. The substrates for BCFA synthesis can be generated via
  the degradation pathway from BCAA or from intermediates of the biosynthesis of these
  BCAA. The increment of BCFA synthesis at low temperature (4°C) in WP3 is achieved
  by induction of the BCAA ABC transporter gene cluster, which increases substantially
  the cell contents of BCAA for BCFA synthesis. BCAT, branched-chain amino acid transaminase;
  BKD, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase; PlsB, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase;
  PlsC, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase.
