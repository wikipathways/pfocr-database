caption: At 6 hrs an induction of signaling pathways and transcription factors occurred,
  which was linked to SA signaling. Subsequently at 18 hrs, both SA and JA-linked
  induction of ROS, cell wall strengthening and PR transcripts were observed. At 24
  hrs transcripts related to lignin formation, flavonoid and volatile compound generation,
  as well as JA-linked ROS were up regulated. Text shaded in pink are SA-linked, text
  shaded in green are JA-linked. The pathogen is indicated in grey, nucleus in blue
  and lignin deposition in maroon.
