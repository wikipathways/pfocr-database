caption: To simplify, only one GATA-RE is illustrated in the 5’ region of the GATA2
  gene. In a TRH-dependent manner, TRH-R stimulates the transcriptional activity of
  GATA2 via the PKC pathway. In contrast, TRβ2 associates with the Zn-finger region
  of GATA2 via protein-protein interaction, resulting in the T3-dependent interference
  of GATA2-dependent transactivation (tethering mechanism). Our study suggests that
  liganded TRβ2 inhibits not only the transcription of the TSHβ and CGA genes but
  also the positive feedback autoregulation of the GATA2 gene. Thus, there are the
  intracellular cascades of T3-dependent negative regulation between GATA2 and TSHβ/CGA.
  Reduction of GATA2 protein expression by T3 appears to occur at transcriptional
  level and is independent from the ubiquitin-proteasome system. T3 also causes TSHβ
  mRNA to be unstable. D2, type 2 deiodinase (the major deiodinase in thyrotroph).
  SR, suppressor region (see main text). In addition to GATA2, the CGA promoter is
  regulated by multiple transcription factors including Msx1, SF-1, Lhx3a, cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) and Ptx1 [].
