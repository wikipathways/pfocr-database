caption: Schematic description of proposed processes in the gill epithelium of Hyas
  araneus in response intermediate P CO 2exposure. Medium-term hypercapnia acclimation
  leads to a shift to a new acid–base equilibrium by accumulation of hemolymph bicarbonate
  (HCO3−). CO2 is hydrated into H+ and HCO3− by cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA).
  Protons are actively pumped out of the epithelial cell by an apical vacuolar proton
  ATPase (V(H+)-ATPase), followed by a transport of HCO3− via a basolateral anion
  exchanger (AE) and/or ion channel, such as bestrophin (Best1). Increased energy
  demand is in part met by an enhanced expression of complex I (CI) and complex IV
  (CIV) of the electron transport system and possibly triggered by a soluble adenylyl
  cyclase (sAC) induced signalling pathway. sAC is stimulated by HCO3− and increases
  the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates protein
  kinase A (PKA) that subsequently leads to an induced expression of CI and CIV. While
  enhanced aerobic metabolic processes increase the generation of oxidants, the cellular
  defence against oxidative stress is adversely affected by a lower production of
  NADPH due to a decrease of the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD). NADPH acts as reducing agent for the regeneration of reduced
  glutathione (GSH) to oxidised glutathione (GSSH). The symbols (+) and (−) mark significantly
  up- and down-regulated genes, respectively modified after [, ].
