caption: Schematic representation of how PLCG1 regulates USP1 phosphorylation to mediate
  20E-induced gene expression for metamorphosis. Through ErGPCR and Gαq, 20E promotes
  Src family kinases to up-regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCG1 and induces
  the migration of phosphorylated PLCG1 toward the cell membrane to produce IP3 and
  DAG. Then cytosolic calcium signals a fast increase, including the release of the
  intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of the extracellular Ca2+ via calcium channels
  (T-type calcium channels and/or TRP channels). The increased Ca2+ and DAG activate
  PKC to regulate the phosphorylation of USP1 and CDK10 for gene transcription and
  insect metamorphosis. This chart is based on the models reported by our laboratory,
  including the ErGPCR-regulated nongenomic action (), the interaction between Hsc70
  and USP1 (), and the participation of CDK10-Hsp90-Hsc70-EcRB1 in the 20E transcriptional
  complex ().
