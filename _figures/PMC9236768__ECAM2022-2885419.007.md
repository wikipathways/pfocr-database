caption: Mechanism of JWYHD activation of BMP signaling pathway and promotion of BMSC
  osteogenic differentiation. JWYHD activates BMP2 to bind to its receptor, leading
  to phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, while P-SMAD1/5/8 binds to SMAD4 and is transported
  to the nucleus to jointly regulate the transcription of downstream target genes
  RUNX2 and OCN.
