caption: Mechanism by which secondary BAs regulate liver TH17/Treg cell differentiation
  to maintain NASH tolerance. ① Long-term HCD feeding induces the expression of HMGCR
  to promote TC synthesis in the liver. More primary BAs are synthesized in large
  quantities from TC. ② In the livers of NASH goats, increased expression levels of
  SULT1C2, UGT8, ABCC2 and BAAT promote bile secretion, which results in the accumulation
  of primary BAs in the liver, serum and intestinal tract. ③ In the ileum contents
  of NASH goats, potential pathogenic microorganisms, such as Erysipelotrichaceae,
  Escherichia and Streptococcus, produce more proinflammatory cytokines, which enter
  the liver through the circulation and cause liver inflammation. ④ In NASH-T goats,
  liver-derived primary BAs are secreted into the intestinal tract. ⑤ More BAs-producing
  bacteria from the Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Lactobacillus genera are enriched
  in the ileum contents of NASH-T goats, which produce a large number of secondary
  BAs, especially UDCA, isoLCA and isoDCA catalysed by BSH, BaiA, 7β-HSDH, 7α-HSDH
  and 3β-HSDH. ⑥ The production of secondary BAs accelerates cholesterol clearance.
  ⑦, ⑧ Moreover, the return of secondary BAs to the liver through the portal vein
  inhibits TH17 cell differentiation and promotes Treg cell proliferation in the liver
  by regulating the expression of genes involved in the TH17 cell differentiation/IL-17/PPAR
  signalling pathway, thereby preventing NASH occurrence. HCD, high-concentrate diet;
