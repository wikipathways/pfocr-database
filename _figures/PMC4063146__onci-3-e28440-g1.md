caption: Figure 1. Co-administration of poly-IC and blocking antibodies of the PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway may enhance anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. (A and B) Potential
  mechanisms accounting for the therapeutic benefit of polyinosinic-polycytidylic
  acid (poly-IC) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade. (A) Poly-IC stimulates
  dendritic cells (DCs) to increase expression of peptide/MHC complexes and secrete
  cytokines, including type-I interferon (IFN) that enhances cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  (CTL) activation, proliferation, and maturation. The blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
  using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) improves T cell activation, and CTLs expand and
  become more potent effector cells. (B) Poly-IC activates DCs at the tumor site and
  enhances tumor antigen cross-presentation, leading to the generation of new CTL
  responses. The blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway enhances the effector phase of CTL
  responses. Green arrows, stimulatory; red arrows, inhibitory.
