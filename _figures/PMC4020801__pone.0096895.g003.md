caption: A. Gene ontology analysis shows proteins involved in fatty acid binding.
  platelet degranulation. serine protease inhibitor activity and hydrogen peroxide
  catabolic processes. B Interaction network of identified biomarker candidates involving
  18 out of the 19 proteins. Proteins involved in inflammation. acute phase response
  (including cellular adhesion). signaling via lipid-mediated pathways (including
  transport) and activation of proteolytic cascades. as well as transcriptional activity
  are indicated. Red diamonds indicate proteins which are significant after correction
  for multiple testing. and grey ones are the remainder of the query set. Circles
  indicate gap-fillers which were added to connect proteins via protein-protein interactions.
  Direct association between the significant biomarker set are indicated by a bold
  line. and relate to immune response (immunoglobulin cluster). protease inhibitor
  activity. and an activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling
  pathway/CDC42 signal transduction pathway. as suggested through APOA1 interactions.
  C. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis. Statistically relevant
  biomarker proteins were mapped onto KEGG pathway maps and showed an involvement
  of fibril formation and inhibition of fibrinolysis in the coagulation cascade and
  association with arachidonic acid metabolism.
