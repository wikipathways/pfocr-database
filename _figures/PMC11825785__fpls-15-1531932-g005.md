caption: 'N metabolism pathway in B balsamifera leaves grown under different N regimes.
  The known enzyme names are shown in blue, and the unknown names are shown in red.
  FOM, Formamidase-like; CAN/CAH, Carbonic anhydrase. Each column represents a different
  N treatment (from left to right: CK, N1 and N2), as shown in the upper left corner.
  The average gene intensity is a key color scale according to the scale in the upper
  left corner. Red represents upregulation, whereas green represents downregulation'
