caption: Metabolic pathway based on phenolic profiling. Methanol-soluble phenolics
  differentially accumulated between Sekizaisou and other cultivars. The molecular
  structures of the individual metabolites can be found in Supplemental Figure S6
  and Supplemental Table S2. The canonical monolignol biosynthetic pathway is shown
  with a gray background. As no near-isogenic line of cv Sekizaisou can be provided
  at present, the methanol-soluble phenolics from a single plant of each of 51 different
  mulberry cultivars (Supplemental Tables S3) that had been cultivated in the same
  experimental field and belonged to M. alba were profiled as controls. More and less
  abundant metabolites in cv Sekizaisou compared with the other cultivars are represented
  with red and blue backgrounds, respectively. The dashed arrows indicate one or more
  proposed conversions. C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaric acid:CoA ligase;
