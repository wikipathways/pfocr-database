caption: A schematic representation of the signaling pathways upregulated in the Tfh
  lymphoma cells is shown. a AITL-like mouse model based on adaptive transfer of Tet2
  invalidated mature CD4 T cells transduced with a retroviral vector expression RhoAG17V
  (ref. ). b AITL-like mouse model based on transplantation of the BM of Tet2 KO mice,
  transduced with a retroviral vector coding for mutated RhoAG17V (ref. ). c AITL-like
  mouse model based on transgenic mice, in which Tet2 is invalidated in the whole
  hematopoietic system while RhoAG17V under the control of a CD4-specific promoter
  is exclusively expressed in CD4 T cells. The therapeutic agents (Everiolimus and
  Duvelisib) interfering with the PI3K-AKT-mTORc1 pathway are indicated.
