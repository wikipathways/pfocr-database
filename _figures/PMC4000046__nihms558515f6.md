caption: Simulation of information flow in network models predicts several important
  interactions mediating the synergy of CDK4 and IGF1R inhibition, including AKT pathway
  members. Network edges ranked by their contribution to the model-simulated synergy
  between CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors. Each edge was removed in turn and the effect
  on the cell viability synergy score was recalculated and expressed as the percent
  suppression of original synergy score. The leave-edge-out calculations were performed
  using the 100 lowest error models.
