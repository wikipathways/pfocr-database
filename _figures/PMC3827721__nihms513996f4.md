caption: '(a) Recycling of by-products of RNA modifications. Adenosylhomocysteinease
  (SAHase) hydrolyses S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to L-homocysteine (L-HCys) and
  adenosine. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) phosphorylases adenosine to adenine
  and ribose-1-phosphate (Rib-1-P). Rib-1-P is converted to ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5-P)
  by phosphopentomutase (PPm). Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPs) phosphorylates
  Rib-5-P to produce 5-phosphoribosol-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). Guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (GPT) produces GMP from the reaction of PRPP and guanine, which is a by-product
  of tRnA metabolism. (b) CmP produced during mRnA degradation is recycled to CTP
  using cytidylate kinase (CMPK) and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK-CDP). (c)
  The ME-Model uses the canonical glycolytic pathway, whereas with the M-Model can
  circumvent portions during optimal growth simulations. The canonical pathway involves
  phosphorylation of D-glucose (D-Glc) to glucose-6-phospate (G6P) by hexokinase (HK1).
  G6P is isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI).
  F6P is phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) by phosphofructokinase
  (PFK). FBP is metabolized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP) by FBP aldolase (FBA). The M-Model can circumvent the HK1/PGI portion
  with glucose/xylose isomerase (GXI) and fructokinase (FRK); however, HK1 or PGI
  must also be expressed because G6P is an essential metabolite. PFK can be circumvented
  by diphosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PPi-PFK). FBA can be circumvented
  by a pathway using 1-phosphofructokinase (FRUK), fructose-1-phosphate aldolase (FPA),
  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH(glycerol)), glycerol kinase (GLYK), glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GPDH) and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI). Enzyme commission numbers
  are provided for each reaction. mRNA and protein expression (and quantile) values
  are provided. Flux variability analysis was performed for simulated growth on maltose
  minimal medium. Blue arrows: reactions required for optimally efficient growth with
  the ME-Model, but not the M-Model. Green arrows: active reactions in a single maltose
  minimal medium simulation shown to put results into pathway context. Grey arrows:
  alternate optimal pathways in the M-Model.'
