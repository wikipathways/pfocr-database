caption: CD4+ T cell pro-inflammation and processes may be targeted in preeclampsia.
  Induction of anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells (Th2s) and Tregs, and inhibition of
  pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells (Th17s, TH1s) may be one pathway for preeclampsia
  treatment and prevention. Collectively, modulation of these processes may ameliorate
  the overly pro-inflammatory immune response in preeclampsia. Shifting the ratio
  of pro-to anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells may prevent preeclampsia by allowing proper
  placentation and reducing resultant oxidative stress. This can be done by 1) promoting
  an anti-inflammatory milieu (Th2, Treg, IFN-γ, IL-10) with anti-CD28, statins that
  induce PLGF and VEGF, or 2) inhibiting a pro-inflammatory milieu (Th1, Th17, IL-2,
  IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α) with anti-CD28 or spironolactone, or inhibiting sFlt-1using
  statins. Specific cytokines may also be inhibited, such as IL-6 by anti-TLR5 or
  anti-IL-6; IL-17 by IL-10, ETA inhibitors, IL-17RC, and anti-IL-17; or TNF-α by
  anti-TNF-α. The anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response may result in tolerance and
  a healthy pregnancy while the pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response may lead to
  fetal rejection, endothelial dysfunction, and clinical preeclampsia signs. DC, dendritic
