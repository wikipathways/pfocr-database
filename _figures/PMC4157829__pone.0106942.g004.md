  indicated in green. Metabolites are indicated in black. Ade1, bifunctional purine
  biosynthetic protein; Xpt1, xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; Apt1, adenine
  phosphoribosyltransferase. Enzymes of the histidine and de novo purine biosythesis
  converging pathways, glutamine amidotransferase: cyclase and Ade1, are down-regulated
  in response to gliotoxin. Expression of enzymes involved in the purine salvage pathways,
  Xpt1 and Apt1, is up-regulated in the presence of H2O2 and gliotoxin, repsectively,
  relative to a solvent control , . Figure adapted from pathway.yeastgenome.org. (b)
