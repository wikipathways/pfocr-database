caption: Overview of the experimental design, analysis and validation. The graph showed
  that by combining RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq, we found many candidate genes related to
  lipid metabolism, including Trub2, and the major enrichment pathways such as mTOR
  signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. These potential
  candidate genes and pathways are critical to understanding the beneficial effects
  of betaine production, and further research is needed to determine the precise processes
  by which they alleviate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.
  In conclusion, this study provides a new resource for determining the remission
  effect of betaine on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease
