caption: 'a The colchicine biosynthesis pathway. b The expression level of colchicine-related
  genes in C. appendiculata genome. “P”: Pseudobulb, “S”: Stem, “L”: Leaf. 2: Two
  years old, 4: Four years, 6: Six years. “.1, .2, .3” means sample duplications.
  Row Z-score means the normalization of FPKM values by the z-score method of each
  row. Yellow color represents a high expression level, and pink color represents
  a low expression level.'
