caption: 'Viral modulation of death-receptor mediated apoptosis. Death receptors Fas,
  TRAIL-R and TNF-R form DISC upon binding to their ligands, activate caspase cascade
  and subsequently initiate extrinsic apoptosis. Caspase-8 activation can cleavage
  BID to tBID and link to mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Virus
  infection regulates death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis mainly through virally
  encoded proteins. The regulatory mechanisms involve: (1) regulating the expression
  and function of death receptors/ligands; (2) interfering DISC formation and function;
  (3) regulating caspase activities; (4) regulating the expression and function of
  pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. Black arrow represents signal induction;
  grey arrow represents signal induced by viruses; grey T bar represents signal inhibited
  by viruses.'
