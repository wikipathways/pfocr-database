caption: The scheme of physiological significance of IRP1 in vivo. IRP1 is the predominant
  IRP protein in renal interstitial fibroblasts and pulmonary endothelial cells. In
  iron-replete conditions, IRP1 ligates an iron–sulfur cluster and displays cytosolic
  aconitase activity; in iron-depleted conditions, IRP1 loses its iron–sulfur cluster
  and binds to IREs of target mRNAs to regulate expression of iron metabolism related
  genes. By binding to the 5′IRE of HIF2α mRNA, IRP1 regulates HIF2α expression according
  to iron and oxygen status, and thereby fine-tunes the levels of HIF2α protein in
  cooperation with prolyl hydroxylases and the Von Hippel–Lindau mediated proteasomal
  degradation pathway. In hypoxia or iron deficiency conditions, HIF2α protein is
  stabilized due to inactivation of prolyl hydroxylases, and then translocates to
  nucleus and transcriptionally increase erythropoietin (EPO) expression. Circulating
  through blood, EPO binds to EPO receptors on erythroblasts and stimulates erythroblasts
  to produce red blood cells (RBC), a process that consumes large amount of iron.
  When too much iron is consumed and systemic iron levels are low, IRP1 will be activated
  to reduce HIF2α expression and restrict RBC production. By this feedback mechanism,
  IRP1 regulates the balance between systemic iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis.
  In pulmonary endothelial cells, IRP1 regulates HIF2α translation and subsequently
  regulates the expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide hormone that regulates
  pulmonary vascular contraction and the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes,
  and fibroblasts. Though the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, IRP1 deficiency
  causes pulmonary hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in mice likely by derepression
  of HIF2α expression, increase of ET-1 levels and most probably other HIF2α targets
  also.
