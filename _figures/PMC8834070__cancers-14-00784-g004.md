caption: Signaling Overview in Sporadic Colon Cancer. Activated WNT signaling, via
  mutations in APC or CTNNB1, results in constitutive formation of βcat/TCF4 complexes,
  which drive WNT target gene expression, such as MYC and CCND1. Activated RAS signaling,
  via mutations in K-RAS, result in activation of ERK, which phosphorylates MYC, as
  well as the R-SMADs, inhibiting SMAD migration to the nucleus (not shown). ERK also
  phosphorylates ELK, which results in expression of FOS. JUN is regulated by the
  JNK cascade (not shown), and binds to FOS, forming the AP-1 transcription factor.
  AP-1 and βcat/TCF4 drive expression of CCND1. Cyclin D1 binds to CDK4 or CDK6 and
  phosphorylates pRb, causing the release of E2F. E2F, with MYC, drives the expression
  of other E2F genes and CCNE1. Cyclin E binds to CDK2, which fully phosphorylates
  pRb, leading to progression into S-phase. The TGF-β pathway is inactivated due to
  mutation, though low levels of phosphorylated R-SMAD may be found in the nucleus.
  The cell cycle inhibitors, p15 and p21, which would be expressed given active TGF-β,
  cannot inhibit CDK4/6 or CDK2, and are in grey.
