caption: A model for up-regulation of RAD51 in 8-MOP-treated cells. The Rad53-dependent
  DNA damage signal transduction cascade (left) and repair events (right) leading
  to up-regulation of RAD51. The 8-MOP photolesion (represented as a diagonal bar
  between the DNA strands) is either not processed or is incompletely processed by
  NER, leading to a blocked replication fork resulting in a DSB followed by channeling
  into homologous recombination or TLS. Passage through the homologous recombination
  pathway generates intermediates that act as a signal for up-regulation of RAD51.
  The absence of homologous recombination eliminates RAD51 up-regulation but has no
  effect on Rad53 phosphorylation or cell cycle changes (see Discussion). Lesions
  processed by TLS do not generate a signal for RAD51 up-regulation. Proteins lacking
  in relevant mutants are marked in accordance with their respective pathways. At
  the same time, a signal is transmitted through the Rad53-dependent DNA damage signal
  transduction cascade, resulting in cell cycle arrest. This signal is necessary,
  but insufficient, for RAD51 up-regulation. Neither signal can compensate for the
  other, demonstrating that both are equally needed.
