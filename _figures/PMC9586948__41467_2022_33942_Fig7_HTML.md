caption: Conflict (orange), Event Timing (dark blue), and Goal Maintenance (dark red)
  neurons are illustrated with selected anatomical connections and laminar densities
  of calretinin (CR), calbindin (CB), and parvalbumin (PV) neurons and of D1 and D2
  receptors (right). Dopamine projections from SNpc and VTA modulate all computations
  in SEF. Left, Conflict signal can arise through coincident inputs of gaze-holding
  (STOP, dark red) and gaze-shifting neurons (GO, green) directly from FEF and indirectly
  via thalamus from SC terminating in L2 and L3. Conflict signals integrated across
  apical and basal dendrites can be sent to multiple cortical and subcortical structures.
  Right, Schematic profiles of Event Timing and Goal Maintenance activity with numbered
  phases. Event Timing neurons can receive inputs from DLPFC and ACC informing them
  about an upcoming event. Ramping results from recurrent connections (1, dark blue).
  SEF can receive information about the stop-signal appearance and successful stopping
  from VLPFC and DLPFC and from Conflict neurons. This signal can suppress the ramping
  activity via inhibitory connections onto Event Timing neurons (2, dark blue), resetting
  these neurons for the next ramping phase (3, dark blue), which is terminated by
  the appearance of the feedback tone (4). Event Timing neurons can project to the
  caudate nucleus (CN) to inform the fronto-striatal reinforcement learning loop about
  experienced event timing. Goal Maintenance neurons can delay unwanted movement through
  the push-pull basal ganglia circuitry. Pyramidal neurons can project to the indirect
  (D2) pathway and inhibitory neurons can project to other pyramidal neurons, unobserved
  in this study (gray), that project to the direct (D1) pathway. Inputs from DLPFC
  and ACC terminating in L2/3 can inform SEF of the anticipated timing of task events
  for successful completion of the task based on the experienced SSD. These inputs
  can produce the phasic response in Goal Maintenance neurons (1, red) followed by
  persisting activity via recurrent connections with balanced excitation and inhibition
  (2, red). The feedback tone, integrated with the task rule from DLPFC, terminates
  operant control on behavior through CR and CB inhibition of the sustained activity
  (3). Further details in the text.
