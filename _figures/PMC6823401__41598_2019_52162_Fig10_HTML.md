caption: The figure shows an MPR route that gets activated by the stimulation of progesterone
  receptor and has a role in cell proliferation by upregulation of PKA/cAMP by the
  activation of CREB/CREM/ATF-1. Activation of PR also upregulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  which leads to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by the activation of MAPK/SRC
  by upregulation of transcription factor, Sp1. Activation of EGFR upregulates Ras-MAPK
  pathway by the phosphorylation of binding domain Grb2 which has an effect on cell
  proliferation, anti-apoptosis and invasion. Grb2 also upregulates PIP3 by activation
  of Gab1, PI3K and AKT pathways that is responsible to cell invasion. mTOR complex
  (mTORC1) is upregulated by certain hormones and growth factors through SOS/Ras/Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway or by PI3K-PDK1-PKB pathway or by both. These pathways upregulate Tuberous
  Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/2) which further downregulate Rheb which is a small G-protein
  responsible for protein synthesis by S6K-rps6.
