caption: SQDG present in green vegetables enters the intestine as a common component
  of the human diet. Sulfoquinovosidases [], encoded by yihQ/sftG, cleave the glycosidic
  linkage of the lipid tail to liberate SQ, which is then in most individuals fermented
  mainly by E. rectale to DHPS, acetate, and likely also to formate or H2 and CO2.
  Further plant-derived compounds, such as amylopectin, xylooligosaccharides and other
  carbohydrates, may also be catabolized and fermented by E. rectale. Other Firmicutes
  with the SFT pathway (grey) such as members of the genera Faecalibacterium, Roseburia,
  and Clostridium can also function as primary SQ degraders in some individuals. Some
  Proteobacteria such as E. coli may catabolize SQ via the sulfo-EMP pathway. B. wadsworthia
  cleaves the C–S bond in DHPS via a DHPS-sulfite lyase to produce sulfite for dissimilatory
  reduction to H2S gas coupled to oxidation of, e.g., formate, lactate, and hydrogen,
  while hydroxyacetone and also acetate are excreted. In few individuals, also Desulfovibrio
  piger uses DHPS as substrate for anaerobic sulfite respiration. Taurine is present
  in dietary meat/fish and is liberated from host-secreted taurocholic acids by microbial
  bile salt hydrolases (encoded by bsh), and thus far was considered the sole major
  source of sulfonate-sulfur for respiration and H2S production by B. wadsworthia
  in the human intestine. H2S and short-chain fatty acids are utilized by colonic
  epithelial cells as energy sources, act as signaling molecules, and are absorbed
  and further distributed by the host via the bloodstream [–]. Excessive concentrations
  of H2S gas can break the mucus layer in the colon by reduction of Muc2-mucin disulfide
  bonds to trisulfides [], thereby allowing bacteria to penetrate the mucus layer
  and interact with the host epithelial lining. Arrows colored in black represent
  previously described metabolic pathways, while those in dark red represent pathways
  revealed in this study. SQDG sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, SQ sulfoquinovose (6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose),
  SF 6-deoxy-6-sulfofructose, G3P glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, F6P fructose-6-phosphate,
  FBP fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate, SLA 3-sulfolactaldehyde,
