caption: Cellular response in bovine sperm after frozen-thawed. The frozen-thawed
  process decreases ATP generation by glycolysis and cAMP signalling pathways, which
  in turn impair progressive motility. The frozen-thawed process damages the antioxidant
  system to produce abundant ROS, inducing severe oxidative stress in the sperm to
  impair motility. In response to oxidative stress, autophagy is triggered for protection
  but eventually guides the sperm to step into apoptosis as cellular damage is severe
