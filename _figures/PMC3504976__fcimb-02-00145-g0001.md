caption: A schematic model for TLRs activation by diverse mycobacterial antigens.
  TLRs are involved in the innate recognition and responses in innate immune cells
  to numerous mycobacterial antigens. Some mycobacterial antigens including LpqH,
  lipoarabinomannan (LAM), lipomannan (LM), 38-kDa antigen, LprG, LprA, PhoS1, trehalose
  dimycolate (TDM), phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) activate TLR2/1 or 6, whereas
  TLR4 recognizes heat shock protein (HSP) 60/65 and 38-kDa antigen. TLR activation
  by mycobacterial antigens leads an intracellular signaling pathway that culminates
  in the production of proinflammatory in macrophages and dendritic cells through
  MAPK and NF-κB pathways.
