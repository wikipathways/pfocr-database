caption: (A) and (B) IPA analysis was performed as described in  on PU.1 target genes
  in both ES-EP and MEL cells. The PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways were identified
  as being significantly over-represented among those genes. The left part of each
  panel depicts all of the components of the indicated IPA pathway. Components denoted
  with a filled yellow circle indicate that the gene for that component is associated
  with a PU.1 ChIP-Seq peak in both ES-EP and MEL cells. To the right of each pathway
  is shown the results of gene expression analysis of the indicated genes in early
  erythroid progenitors derived from wild-type embryos relative to PU.1 low embryos.
