caption: 'Gut microbiota regulates bone metabolism through three pathways. Note: In
  immune regulation, Th17 cells are induced and differentiated by specific components
  of the intestinal microbiota, such as SFB, E. lenta, and Bifidobacterium adolescens,
  thereby promoting osteoclastogenesis via receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB
  ligand (RANKL) signaling. Meanwhile, Treg cells, under the influence of intestinal
  Clostridium species, secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, IL-10,
  and TGF-β to suppress osteoclast activity and promote osteogenesis. In terms of
  hormonal regulation, estrogen metabolism is modulated by GUS enzymes associated
  with Lactobacillus and other gut microbiota. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) facilitates
  bone loss mediated by Th17 cells through the action of intestinal SFB, while requiring
  intestinal butyrate to enhance osteogenesis via the Treg/CD8 + T cell-WNT10b pathway.
  Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota may also impact bone metabolism through 5-HT
  synthesis pathways. Among the intestinal metabolites, acetic acid inhibits osteocalcin
  secretion, whereas propionic acid and butyric acid exert protective effects against
  ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Collectively, the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites
  regulate the equilibrium between osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis via immune,
  hormonal, and other physiological pathways'
