caption: 'Role of Acc1 in Lipid Metabolism(A) Metabolic pathway for FA and lipid synthesis.
  Acc1, which is negatively regulated by Snf1 kinase, catalyzes the rate-limiting
  step in FA de novo production. The level of PA in the ER is responsible for transcriptional
  regulation of many genes involved in PL synthesis, in particular INO1, by binding
  and sequestering the repressor Opi1 at the nuclear ER.(B) Schematic view of the
  yeast Acc1 protein (2,233 amino acids). The enzyme consists of three domains: the
  biotin carboxylase domain (BC, amino acids [aa] 58–567), the biotin-carboxyl carrier
  protein (BCCP, aa 701–767) and the carboxyltransferase domain (CT, aa 1603–2101).
  The serine residue at position 1157 is the phosphorylation site for Snf1 kinase,
  which is located in an R/K-X-X-S consensus motif that is present in many Snf1 substrates.See
