caption: (a) The cell wall of S. pneumoniae has a diverse protein population. Proteins
  such as pneumolysin can trigger apoptosis on entering cells by destruction of the
  mitochondria. In addition oxidising components such as hydrogen peroxide can trigger
  apoptosis and necrosis. (b) The host immune response will most likely be made up
  of complement and cytokines which can activate transmembrane death receptors such
  as Fas. This will cause receptors to aggregate together on the cell surface leading
  to apoptosis. The adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) activates
  caspase-8, an initiator protein, to form a signal complex to directly activate caspase-3.
  Active caspase-8 can also cleave BID protein to tBID, which acts as a signal on
  the membrane of mitochondria to facilitate the release of cytochrome c in the intrinsic
  pathway. The mitochondrial stress pathway is initiated when proapoptotic proteins
  in the cytoplasm, BAX, and BID stimulate the rupture of the mitochondria. The release
  of mitochondrial content is aided by the protein BAK. In the caspase dependant pathway,
  cytochrome c released from the mitochondria forms a complex in the cytoplasm with
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1).
  This complex activates caspase-9, an initiator protein. In return, the activated
  caspase-9 works together with the complex of cytochrome c, ATP, and Apaf-1 to form
  an apoptosome, which in turn activates caspase-3, the effector protein that initiates
  degradation. The caspase independent pathway (pyknosis) is as a result of apoptosis
  inducing factor (AIF). The necrotic pathway is activated in severe meningitis. Alterations
  in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium could signal the mobilisation of executioner
  cathepsin proteases and other hydrolases, through calpain activation. Calpains have
  been implicated in the activation of proapoptotic caspase proteases; hence the later
  steps of necrosis correlate with the later steps of apoptosis.
