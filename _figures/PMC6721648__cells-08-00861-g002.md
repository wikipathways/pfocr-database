caption: 'Pathways of androgen action in the Sertoli cell. The classical and non-classical
  pathways of androgen action co-exist in the Sertoli cell. In the cytoplasm the androgen
  receptor (AR) is bound to heat-shock proteins (HSP). When androgens bind to the
  AR it causes a conformational change that releases the AR as monomers. In the Sertoli
  cell, ligand-bound AR monomers can either migrate to the inner side of the cell
  membrane and interact with Src, thus activating the non-classical/non-genomic pathway
  of androgen action; or they can translocate to the nucleus and form homodimers that
  can interact with androgen response elements (ARE) or with other transcription factors
  (TF), thus activating the classical/genomic pathway of androgen action. Src: Steroid
  receptor coactivator, EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor, MEK: Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, CREB: cAMP response
  element binding protein. Based on refs. [,,,,].'
