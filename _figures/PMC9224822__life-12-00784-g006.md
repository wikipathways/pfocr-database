caption: Lipid metabolism and autophagy. CMA (chaperone-mediated autophagy); FA (fatty
  acid); FAO (fatty acid oxidation); FFA (free fatty acid); Lamp (lysosome-associated
  membrane protein); LD (lipid drop); Hsc70 (heat shock homologous protein 71 kDa
  protein); lipid droplet surface proteins plin2 and plin3 are degraded by chaperone-mediated
  autophagy (CMA). The double membrane engulfs a portion of the whole LD to form autophagy
  bodies, which fuse with lysosomes to form autophagy lysosomes. Lysosomal acid lipase
  acts on lipids to form free fatty acids. Cytoplasmic lipase directly acts on the
  surface of LD and degrades lipids into fatty acids. Subsequently, fatty acid metabolism
  produces energy and metabolic intermediates via β- Oxidation in mitochondria. Lysosome-associated
  membrane protein type 2A (lamp2a) is a key protein in the CMA pathway. The accelerated
  degradation of lamp2a determines the loss of lysosomal membrane stability. It includes
  catabolism (fatty acid oxidation (FAO)), biosynthetic pathway (de novo fat formation),
  and storage of lipid droplets (LDS).
