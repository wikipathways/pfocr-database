caption: 'The protective mechanisms of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in ischemic stroke.
  Tregs play a neuroprotective role in the early stage of ischemic stroke by acting
  on white blood cells in peripheral blood: (1)Tregs inhibit the production of neutrophil‐derived
  metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) by expressing programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1), thus
  protecting the integrity of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB). (2)Tregs can directly
  activate C‐C Chemokine Receptor Type 5 (CCR5) and combines with chemokine (C‐C motif)
  ligand 5 (CCL5) on endothelial cells to prevent other immune cells from staying
  in the ischemic area, thus protecting the BBB. (3)Tregs inhibit the activation of
  effector T cells by producing anti‐inflammatory factor such as interleukin (IL)‐10
  and transforming growth factor‐β(TGF‐β). About 5–7 days after stroke, Tregs was
  driven to infiltrate into the brain by the chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 1 (CCL1)
  and chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) and play a brain‐protective role in
  the following ways: (1)Brain Tregs prevent microglia/macrophage polarization toward
  the M1 type and modulate microglia/macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype,
  thus reducing inflammation reaction. (2)Brain Tregs can also inhibit the activation
  of neurotoxic astrocyte through the amphiregulin (AREG)/epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) pathway to promote neurological recovery. (3)Brain Tregs alleviate
  neural injury and promote neurogenesis through IL‐10.'
