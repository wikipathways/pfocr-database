caption: DNA damage-driven inflammation drives age-related pathology. DNA damage triggers
  the activation of innate immune responses, which act as a key mediator of tissue
  degenerative changes and age-related organismal decline. In particular, the presence
  of DNA breaks, small base modifications or bulky DNA adducts in the mammalian genome
  triggers the release of DNA moieties in the cytoplasm, which are predominantly sensed
  by the cGAS/STING signaling pathway stimulating the type I interferon (IFN) response.
  DNA damage also triggers the activation of NF-κB in the cytoplasm that translocates
  into the nucleus to activate the transcription of immune response gene targets.
  Moreover, the accumulation of irreparable DNA lesions may lead to the release of
  senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, such as cytokines, soluble
  growth factors, proteases as well as insoluble extracellular matrix components in
  the surrounding milieu. Cells with compromised genome integrity are also known to
  secrete extracellular vesicles that target a wide range of recipient cells leading
  to metabolic reprogramming and systemic inflammation. Eventually, the multiple links
  between persistent DNA damage and activation of innate immune responses in mammals
  lead to chronic inflammation that drives tissue deterioration, malfunction and organismal
  decline with aging. The recent development of rationalized intervention strategies
  (nucleases, corticosteroids etc.) against direct products of DNA damage itself i.e.,
  nucleic acids or against inflammatory mediators are expected to profoundly lessen
  the adverse consequences of degenerative features that manifest with advancing age.
  Intervention methods targeting DNA damage-induced inflammatory stimuli are depicted
  in red inhibitory arrows.
