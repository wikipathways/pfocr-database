caption: Interplay of H2S and ABA through their biosynthetic pathways.In guard cells,
  the expression of DES1 is induced by exogenous ABA. Conversely, the metabolic activity
  of sulfur can promote the synthesis of ABA. The increase in intracellular H2S can
  promote the synthesis of cysteine, elevate the activity of ABA3, and enhance ABA
  signal transduction. Increases in intracellular cysteine also promote MoCo-S synthesis,
  which further boosts the activity of AAO. Moreover, the increased sulfate and cysteine
  will be taken up into the chloroplasts and enhance the activity of NCED3. Solid
  arrow, existing pathway; dotted arrow, predicted pathway. AAO3, aldehyde oxidase
  3; ABA, abscisic acid; ABA 1/2/3/4, ABA deficient 1/2/3/4; ABI4, ABA insensitive
