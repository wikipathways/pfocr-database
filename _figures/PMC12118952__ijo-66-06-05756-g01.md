caption: Metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells. HCC cells meet the needs of rapid cell
  proliferation through metabolic reprogramming and aerobic glycolysis of hepatoma
  cells is enhanced (3). By reducing pyruvate to lactate, LDH maintains the dynamic
  balance of NADH/NAD+ in cells and ensures the stability of the intracellular redox
  environment (8). Glycolysis may also provide the PPP substrate required for nucleotide
  synthesis (41,42). LDH regulates lipid metabolism through the regulation of NAD+/NADH
  balance, with increased de novo fat synthesis and increased FA β-oxidation in hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells (67,68). Lactate can enter mitochondria through the lactate shuttle
  mechanism and be converted to pyruvate under the reverse catalysis of LDH. LDH participates
  in the TCA and provides more energy to cells (65). HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
