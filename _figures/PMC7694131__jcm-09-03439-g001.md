caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. (a) Wnt signaling OFF:
  If there is no Wnt ligand, or if sclerostin prevents its binding to the receptor
  complex, the destruction complex Axin-APC-CK1α-GSK3 phosphorylates β-catenin, targeting
  it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. (b) Wnt signaling ON: Canonical
  Wnt signaling is activated by Wnt ligands binding to Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6
  co-receptors, resulting in the recruitment of axin and disheveled by the receptor
  complex and leading to GSK3 inhibition, the mechanism of which is still debated.
  β-catenin accumulates, translocates into the nucleus and associates with transcription
  factors to induces the expression of target genes. Scl-Ab blocks the action of sclerostin,
  preventing its binding to Lrp5/6 and therefore canonical Wnt signaling inhibition.
  (c) Non-canonical Wnt signaling can also be activated by binding of Wnt ligands
  to Frizzled receptors. In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, increased intracellular calcium
  concentration, possibly via G proteins and PLC, activates CaMKII, PKC and NFAT.
  In the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, small G proteins such as Rac and
  Rho are activated, resulting in JUNK and ROCK activity. APC: APC adenomatous polyposis
  coli; CaMKII: calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 2; CK1α: Casein kinase 1
  α; GSK3: Glycogen synthase kinase 3; JUNK: Jun kinase; LRP: Low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; NFAT: Nuclear factor of activated T cells; PKC: Protein
  kinase C; PLC: phospholipase C; ROCK: RHO-associated kinase; ROR: Receptor-tyrosine-kinase-like
  orphan receptor; Scl-Ab: Anti-sclerostin antibody.'
