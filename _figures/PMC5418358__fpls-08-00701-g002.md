caption: Signaling pathways in the plant defense response regulated by silicon (Si).
  Crosstalk between signaling pathways in plant defense originating from the actions
  of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) are demonstrated,
  as well as their interactions in modulating the defensive response regulated by
  Si. The SA signaling pathway mainly involves in biotrophs disease, whereas JA and
  ET signaling pathways attribute to necrotrophs disease. T, negative effect; purple
  stars, positive effect; red, increased or up-regulated by Si supply. The networking
  of signaling pathways are modified from .
