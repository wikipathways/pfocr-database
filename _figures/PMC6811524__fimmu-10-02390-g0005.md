caption: Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling manipulation during E. chaffeensis
  infection of monocytes. (1) E. chaffeensis dense-cored cells express surface proteins
  TRP32 and TRP120 that stimulate phagocytosis in a Wnt signaling-dependent manner,
  potentially through interaction with the Wnt receptor complex and stimulation of
  non-canonical Wnt pathways to induce cytosolic Ca2+ flux and cytoskeletal reorganization.
  (2) Pathway activity during bacterial entry as well as T1SS secreted effectors TRP32
  and TRP120 direct stimulation of PI3K-AKT signaling facilitates mTOR activation
  which prevents fusion of the bacterial replicative autophagosome with the lysosome.
  During infection, the secreted TRP effectors localize to the host cytoplasm where
  they interact with proteins involved in Wnt signaling (3) as well as translocate
  to the nucleus where they bind host DNA within the promoter regions of Wnt target
  genes or directly interact with transcriptional regulators of Wnt target genes (4).
