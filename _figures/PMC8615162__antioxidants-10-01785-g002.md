caption: Causes of secondary CoQ deficiency. Mechanisms proposed to trigger the secondary
  variant are grouped in several categories (G1 to G6) indicated in different colors.
  The synthesis of CoQ can be reduced by defects in proteins implicated directly or
  indirectly in the assembly and proper respiratory machinery functioning (G1 (blue)
  and G3 (red)). In orange (G2) are the essential proteins for the maintenance of
  intact mtDNA. Point mutations in mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are also
  associated with low CoQ levels. The stability of Q-synthome depends on ER-mitochondrial
  contact sites (ERMES) and the cholesterol synthesis pathway (G4 (purple)). Defects
  in the proteins implicated in the transport of several metabolites, such as glucose
  or Fe2+, throughout to plasm or mitochondrial membrane cause channelopathies, marked
  in green (G5). The mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial mass by processes such as
  fusion-fission proteins, MFN1, and MFN2 (G6) are shown in yellow.
