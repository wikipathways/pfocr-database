caption: 'Pathway of prostanoid and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid biosynthesis.
  Free arachidonic acid is metabolized into: (i) prostaglandin (PG)G2 and then into
  PGH2 through the catalytic activity of cyclooxygenase; PGH2 is then converted into
  prostanoids (prostaciclyn (PGI2), PGE2, PGF2a, PGD2, and TXA2) by tissue- and cell-specific
  isomerases; (ii) 12S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HpETE) by the activity
  of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) and then subsequently reduced to 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (12S-HETE). Once formed, prostanoids and 12S-HETE bind to their specific G
  protein-coupled receptors: the E prostanoid receptor (EP) 1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 subtypes
  of the PGE2 receptor; the PGD receptor (DP1 and CRTH-2); the PGF2a receptor (FP);
  the PGI2 receptor (IP); the thromboxane receptor (TPa and TPb), and GPR31. These
  receptors activate various intracellular signaling pathways which mediate the effects
  of receptor activation on cell function. Abbreviations: CRTH-2, chemoattractant
  receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper 2 cells; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular-signal regulated kinases; NFkB, nuclear
  factor kappaB; cAMP, cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; IP3, inositol trisphosphate.'
