caption: 'Autophagy, Ca2+ and cancer. Autophagy is a key process necessary for the
  maintenance of the correct cell homeostasis. The unc-51 like autophagy activating
  kinase 1-2/autophagy-related 13/200-kDa focal adhesion kinase family-interacting
  protein (ULK/ATG13/FIP200) complex together with other proteins, such as coiled-coil,
  moesin-like BCL2 interacting protein (BECN1), controls the formation and elongation
  of autophagosome vesicles. The activity of BECN1 is also regulated by the portion
  of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) pool that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). A series of autophagy-related genes (ATG) is essential to the growth and closure
  of the autophagosome. Additionally, Ca2+ signal intervenes to modulate the autophagic
  machinery. A correct Ca2+ transfer between the ER and mitochondria permits optimal
  mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and consequent ATP production. This signal downregulates
  the activation of the energy sensor of ATP/AMP ratio, 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), which is the most investigated positive regulator of autophagic
  induction mechanism, AMPK-ULK1-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). When Ca2+ transfer
  from the ER to mitochondria and/or Ca2+ is imported into mitochondria is compromised,
  AMPK is activated, and survival autophagy is induced. For example, tumors characterized
  by loss of the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) have enhanced
  autophagy levels and attenuated Ca2+ dynamics. In renal carcinoma, miR-501 decreases
  the activity of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) channel, provoking a reduction
  in ATP production and recruitment of AMPK-ULK-mTOR pathway. In contrast, it has
  been observed that reduced Ca2+ dynamics may also activate autophagic cell death.
  Cancers have increased voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC): their inhibition reduces
  Ca2+ entry and activates autophagy to reduce cell proliferation. A decrease in ORAI1
  delays cytoplasmic Ca2+ clearance and activates autophagy. Diverse Ca2+ mobilizing
  agents increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and activate pro-survival autophagy
  by activating Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases 2 (CAMKII). Created with
