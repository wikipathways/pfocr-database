caption: NF-κB Signaling Pathway(Left) Canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. This
  pathway is mediated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκB. (Right) Non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. This
  pathway involves IKKα activation via NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and induces the
  phosphorylation of p100, leading to the generation and translocation of p52.
