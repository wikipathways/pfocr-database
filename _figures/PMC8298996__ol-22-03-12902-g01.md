caption: 'Physiological functions of claudins. a, TJ assembly: Close apposition of
  adjacent plasma membranes where TJ strands are formed by claudins. b, The ‘pore’
  pathway: Solutes or ions pass through a paracellular channel determined by the charged
  residue status in the first ECL (ECL1) of claudins. c, The ‘leak’ pathway, in which
  solutes supposedly pass through the paracellular space, dependent on the breaking
  and reorganization of claudin strands. d, Fence function: Proteins and lipids in
  the exoplasmic leaflet cannot freely diffuse across claudin strands. e, Signaling
  transduction: Claudins mainly function as inhibitory factors and retain signaling
  molecules in the submembrane compartment. f, Claudins outside TJs always associate
  with other molecules to engage in cell-ECM interactions and signal transduction.
  TJ, tight junction; ECM, extracellular matrix; ECL, extraceullar loop.'
