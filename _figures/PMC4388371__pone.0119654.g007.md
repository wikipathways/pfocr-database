caption: Elements in blank box represent the metabolites influenced by copper-laden
  diet and PA treatment. The elements in green box represent the enzymes involved
  in the metabolic pathway. The elements in yellow box represent the peripheral pathways
  that can be associated with the characteristic metabolites.
