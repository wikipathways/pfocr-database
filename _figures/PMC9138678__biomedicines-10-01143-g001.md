caption: 'The figure shows the pathways by which BDNF signals can promote the survival
  of neuronal cells. The binding of BDNF to TrkB receptor switches on 3 different
  signaling pathways: the first pathway is the activation of the (PLC-γ) pathway which
  increases the level of Ca2+ that will terminate the apoptosis that is caused by
  inflammatory mediators (dashed lines), achieved by inhibiting the glycogen synthase
  kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β). The second pathway is activation of mTOR-dependent translation
  through the (PI3K) pathway, resulting in the transcription of BDNF mRNA. Additionally,
  the induction of Akt and Erk downstream enhances gene regulation through the NF-κB
  and CREB transcription factors. The third pathway is regulated by several factors
  such as zinc, epidermal growth factor, glucocorticoids, and the so called neurotrophic
  pathway, which is considered to be independent for BDNF as it can transactivate
  the TrkB and has a role in its signaling. This figure is adapted after modification
  from open access [].'
