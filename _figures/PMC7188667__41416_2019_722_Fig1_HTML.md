caption: a Endogenous metabolites, carcinogens and drugs are conjugated to glucuronic
  acid (GlcA) taken from the preferential co-substrate UDP-GlcA by membrane-bound
  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. The glucuronidation reaction generally
  takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and requires active
  transport of cytosolic UDP-GlcA to the ER. b Four UGT families (UGT1, UGT2, UGT3
  and UGT8) encode the 22 enzymes and alternative isoforms (≥180) that regulate the
  glucuronidation pathway in humans. UGTs are found in most organs, generally anchored
  to the luminal side of the ER. Some UGTs may also reside in the perinuclear membrane
  (not illustrated). The liver expresses the widest array of UGTs. Enzymes of the
  UGT3 and UGT8 families use the co-substrates UDP-glucose, UDP-xylose, UDP-galactose
  and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine rather than UDP-GlcA to catalyse the glycosylation of
  endogenous metabolites (see Box ). c Examples of endogenous metabolites and anti-cancer
  agents targeted by UGTs. Hydroxyl, amine, and sulfhydryl are the main functional
  groups targeted by UGT enzymes. Each UGT is specialised in the conjugation of a
  specific set of substrates.
