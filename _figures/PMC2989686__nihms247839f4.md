caption: Canonical pathways for cardiovascular disease. Schematic representation of
  networking in which SERPINE1 and SERPINF2 are found to be the key molecules in the
  extracellular space and the other members are linked with SERPINE1 by dotted and
  solid lines. The cardiovascular pathway is integrated by obesity and diabetes pathways.
  KF2B (cytoplasm) induces FN 1 (part of diabetes pathway) to induce SERPINE1 (part
  of both obesity and diabetes pathway) (extracellular space). Also, FN 1 induces
  SERPINF2 and SERPING 1 through PLG (extracellular space). SERPINE1 is induced by
  CLL (extracellular space) and indirectly by FN1 and PLG. However, all SERPINE1,
  SERPING1 and SERPINF2 interconnected with each other. Although SERPING1 interconnection
  was not clear in the diabetes pathway. Data is the sum of three independently performed
  experiments.
