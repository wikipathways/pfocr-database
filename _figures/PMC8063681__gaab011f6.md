caption: 'Functional roles of the newly discovered potential biomarkers of endometriosis
  and recurrent implantation failure (A) and recurrent implantation failure (RIF)
  (B). Functions associated with the new biomarkers of endometriosis (A) (eutopic:
  n = 544, ectopic: n = 158) and RIF (n = 27) (B) are shown in the endometrial cellular
  context together with references supporting the role of each function in the pathophysiology
  of the corresponding disorder. The number of biomarkers of eutopic (A, purple boxes)
  and ectopic (A, green boxes) endometriosis and RIF (B, pink boxes) annotated to
  each function are represented. New potential biomarkers belonging to each represented
  function are fully listed in . Functional annotations were performed for each new
  biomarker using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathways () and Gene
  Ontology (GO) () databases. For GO annotation, the three ontologies were used (biological
  processes, molecular functions, cellular components), only experimental-evidenced
  GO-gene associations were included, a propagated GO version was used for considering
  the whole GO-tree structure, and annotated GO terms were filtered by those having
  more than five and less than 500 associated genes. Obtained GO and KEGG annotated
  terms were then grouped in broader functional categories, which are represented
  in this figure. Keywords used in PubMed to search for functions altered in endometriosis
  and RIF patients included ‘endometriosis’, ‘RIF’, ‘recurrent implantation failure’,
  ‘function’, ‘pathway’, ‘gene ontology’ and ‘KEGG’. References: a—(); b—(); c—();
