caption: Simple molecular pathway for sex determination in the mammalian gonads. In
  SRY-positive bipotential gonads, SRY binds to multiple gonad-specific enhancer elements
  of the SOX9 promoter to upregulate its expression, along with DAX1 and SF1. SOX9
  in turn represses SRY in a negative feedback loop, whereas fibroblast growth factor-9
  (FGF9) stabilizes SOX9 expression, as confirmed in FGF9-null XY sex-reversed mice.
  During testis differentiation, SRY, SOX9 or both also act to downregulate the ovarian
  pathway by suppressing RSPO1 during a key window in early development. In the absence
  of SRY, levels of RSPO1 rise and cause increased WNT4 activity and β-catenin (β-Cat)
  signaling by inhibiting internalization of the WNT co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor–related protein-6 (LRP6; ), resulting in an ovary. WNT4 antagonizes the
  expression of activin B (INHBB) and induces the activin B antagonist, follistatin
  (FST), theoretically through β-catenin, preventing testis vasculature development.
  Other male genes downstream of SRY include GATA-binding protein-4 (GATA4), Zinc
  finger protein, multitype-2 (ZFPM2, also know as FOG2), Wilm's tumor-1 (WT1) and
  NR0B1 (DAX1), whereas the gonadal target genes of SOX9 include AMH, FGF9, desert
  hedgehog (DHH), prostaglandin D synthase (PTGDS), and VANIN1 (VNN1). Solid lines,
  known effect; dashed lines, postulated effect. Arrows, positive regulation; blunted-end
  lines, negative regulation.
