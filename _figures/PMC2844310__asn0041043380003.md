caption: The relationship of NFκB to genes identified as “linearly” changing with
  age on the basis of cocitation analysis (Genomatix BibliosphereTM) is shown as a
  Bibliosphere image. Of the probe sets with a slope of >2 in the ad libitum-fed group,
  85 genes are cocited in the Genomatix BibliosphereTM database. At the level of B0
  (cocitation in abstracts), 72 of the 85 genes are connected to NFκB in a network
  (when NFκB is included). Genes with negative slope with aging are displayed as blue
  nodes; a positive slope with aging is given as yellow/red nodes. The intensity of
  color denotes the degree of slope shown in Supplemental Tables 1A and 1B. Nodes
  are connected by black lines if they are cocited. A green line indicates an NFκB-binding
  site in the proximal promoter region of the gene (500 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream
  of transcription start site). IN indicates that the gene was part of the input gene
  set. TF indicates that the gene is a transcription factor. ST indicates that the
  gene is part of a signal transduction pathway. M indicates that the gene is part
  of a metabolic pathway. A closed arrowhead indicates activation. A dark blue node
  indicates a connection annotated by GenomatixTM. An orange node indicates that the
  connection is annotated by Molecular ConnectionsTM.
