caption: Model depicting the proposed effect of the membrane-permeant peptide TAT-GESV
  on NMDAR signaling in neuropathic pain. NMDARs typically consist of two NR1 subunits
  and two NR2 subunits. The latter can interact via its C-terminus with the PDZ1 domain
  of the scaffolding protein postsynaptic density 95 kDa (PSD95), which tethers the
  enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the NMDAR, whereas the PDZ2 domain
  of PSD95 is free to recruit nNOS via its β-finger (orange loop). Preceding the β-finger
  of nNOS is a canonical PDZ domain that recruits NOS1AP, an adaptor protein that
  recruits the p38 MAPK activator MKK3 and mediates nNOS-dependent activation of p38MAPK
  activity [] (left panel). Activation of p38 MAPK leads to phosphorylation of its
  substrates such as serine 15 on p53, which in this study is used as a surrogate
  marker of p38 MAPK activation. We propose that this pathway mediates the contribution
  of NMDAR-nNOS signaling to central sensitization and chronic pain. We postulate
  that TAT-GESV (right panel) displaces NOS1AP from the PDZ domain of nNOS, uncoupling
  the p38 MAPK-p53 pathway from the NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS complex, thereby reducing central
  sensitization and chronic pain.
