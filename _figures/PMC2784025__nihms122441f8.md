caption: Proposed model of the underlying mechanism by which NeuroD6 may bridge neuronal
  differentiation to survival. This model integrates the current results with our
  previously published studies, demonstrating that NeuroD6 upregulates the expression
  of G1 phase-promoting cell cycle regulators and several cytoskeletal elements in
  the absence of NGF (; ), as well as maintain the expression levels throughout serum
  deprivation (). In addition, NeuroD6 prevents caspase-3 activation upon serum deprivation
  by triggering expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 members, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, in
  conjunction with members of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family, such as XIAP
  and surviving (). The NeuroD6-mediated pathways are illustrated by arrows with NeuroD6
  located at the center of this nexus. The positive correlation between NeuroD6 and
  the heat shock network is shown as an integral component of the NeuroD6-mediated
  nexus, leading to the notion that NeuroD6 may bridge neuronal differentiation to
  survival via the expression of specific heat shock proteins, known to influence
  cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal survival through the post-mitochondrial pathway
  depicted in the figure.
