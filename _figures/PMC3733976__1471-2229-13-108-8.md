caption: Effects of Alethea and salinity on proline and polyamine biosynthesis. Pathway
  diagram illustrating conversion of arginine and glutamate to ornithine and thence
  proline. Significant transcriptional effects of Alethea and salinity on genes encoding
  relevant enzymes (italics) are shown as red arrows for up-regulation and blue bars
  for down-regulation.
