caption: APAP-sensitive proteins related to protein synthesis (a). Proteins with cysteine
  SNO/SOH levels changed significantly between APAP treatment and control were used
  to map out the pathway based on manual inspection of UniProt annotations. Proteins
  are represented by their respective gene names. Changes in cysteine oxidations are
  marked with arrows. N – S-nitrosylation, S – S-sulfenylation, ↑ – min. 1.5-fold
  increase in abundance, ↓ – min. 1.5 decrease in abundance. I and G are abbreviations
  of amino acids, isoleucine and glycine respectively. The corresponding data on protein
  expression and SNO/SOH modification levels are provided in ESI Table S1. APAP-sensitive
  proteins from the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway (b). Proteins with
  cysteine SNO/SOH levels changed significantly between APAP treatment and control
  were used to map out the pathway based on manual inspection of UniProt annotations.
  Proteins are represented by their gene names. Changes in cysteine oxidations are
  marked with arrows. N – S-nitrosylation, S – S-sulfenylation, ↑ – min. 1.5-fold
  increase in abundance, ↓ – min. 1.5 decrease in abundance. Alternative routes of
  Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction are marked with dashed arrows. Protein names marked
  with arrows indicate proteins up (↑) or down (↓) regulated under APAP treatment.
  SCF – Skp, cullin, F-box containing complex (multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex);
  Ub – ubiquitination; PAF1C – RNA Polymerase-associated factor 1 complex. The corresponding
  data on protein expression and SNO/SOH modification levels are provided in ESI Table
  S1. .

  contains additional figures and detailed figure descriptions. Supplementary Table
  S1.xlsx contains 5 tables presenting detailed protein expression data. Table A –
  ‘Protein expression’ contains a list of all proteins identified/quantified in label-free
  proteomics experiments; Table B – ‘IPA analysis’ contains the results of the pathway
  analysis of differentially regulated proteins under APAP treatment; Table C – ‘SNO/SOH
  proteome’ contains the list of all unique, iodoTMT-containing peptides quantified
  in min. 2 biological replicates. Table D – ‘RedoxDB + dbSNO’ is a summary of the
  comparative analysis of all identified SNO/SOH proteins and sites with information
  deposited in publicly available repositories of cysteine modifications – RedoxDB
  and dbSNO. Table E – ‘_extended’ is an extended version of  from the main manuscript.
