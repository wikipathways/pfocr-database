caption: 'Wnt signaling, structure and activation: Wnt signaling is activated when
  glycoprotein ligands of the Wnt family bind Frizzled transmembrane receptors located
  at cell membrane level. Upon ligand binding, several cascades could be activated:
  (i) The Wnt/β-catenin, the ligand binds to the frizzled receptors and its coreceptors
  LRP5/6, which recruits the Disheveled (Dvl) protein, which in turn binds to Axin
  and GSK-3 proteins, leading to the disassembling of the β-catenin destruction complex,
  the subsequent release of β-catenin and its nuclear localization In the nucleus,
  β-catenin interacts with LEF/TCF transcription factors and other transcriptional
  activators to trigger activation of Wnt target genes. (ii) The Wnt planar cell polarity
  (PCP) pathway, the ligand binding on Frizzled receptors shows the recruitment of
  Dvl, the scaffold proteins Diego and Flamingo and the formation of a protein platform
  triggering the activity of Rho family GTPase proteins to regulate actin organization
  and cytoskeleton dynamics. (iii) the Wnt/Ca2+ which controls the levels of intracellular
  Ca2+. Upon ligand binding, Dvl is recruited and a G-coupled protein is also recruited,
  which subsequently activate the phospholipase C, whose role consists in the cleavage
  of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP3 diffuses in the cytoplasm to induce Ca2+
  release by cytoplasmic organelles. Ca2+ increase activates the Ca2+ -dependent kinases.'
