caption: The myogenic machinery downstream of myogenin is functional in cells expressing
  the mutant DMPK 3′-UTR. (A) The temporal progression of major events in the C2C12
  differentiation pathway. Cells proliferating in growth media express MyoD and Myf5.
  When cultured in differentiation media lacking growth factors, cells initiate myogenin
  expression, exit the cell cycle, turn on muscle-specific structural genes, such
  as MHC, and fuse into myotubes. (B) Uninfected GFP+mut 3′-UTR pool (mut 3′-UTR)
  cells show a differentiation defect, and do not fuse into myotubes (stained red
  by immunofluorescent staining of MHC) as effectively as GFP+wt 3′-UTR pool (wt 3′-UTR)
  and control C2C12 cells. However, GFP+mut 3′-UTR pool cells infected with a retrovirus
  that produces myogenin are capable of forming thick myotubes similar to those formed
  in GFP+wt 3′-UTR pool and C2C12 cells. Infection with a control retrovirus that
  expresses LacZ has no effect on the differentiation phenotype. Nuclei are stained
  blue with DAPI. (C) Western blot analysis of cultures in growth media shows exogenous
  myogenin expression only in cells infected with the myogenin retrovirus (+myg).
  These blots were also probed for dynein, which serves as a loading control.
