caption: 'Schematic representation of the Calvin–Benson cycle. This display highlights
  the location of CBC metabolites and reactions that catalyse irreversible reactions
  in vivo (thick black arrows; name of enzyme in black box). Reactions that catalyse
  reversible reactions are shown with thin lines, with the arrow indicating the direction
  of net flux during operation of the CBC. The enzymes involved in 3PGA reduction
  are named; the reactions catalysed by transketolase and aldolase are identified
  by a circle and a triangle, respectively. Triose-P isomerase is indicated with an
  arrow, and the isomerases that interconvert Xu5P, R5P, and Ru5P are omitted for
  simplicity, as is the stoichiometry of the reactions. In the absence of photorespiration,
  the CBC catalyses a net reaction of 6NADPH+9ATP+3CO2→6NADP++9ADP+8Pi+1triose-P.
  The remaining Pi is recycled during end-product synthesis, which is indicated here
  schematically for conversion of triose-P (GAP and DHAP) to sucrose. Some end-product
  synthesis starts from F6P for starch, 3PGA for organic acids, amino-derived amino
  acids (E4P) for aromatic acids and phenylpropanoids, and pentose-P for nucleotides.
  Rubisco also catalyses a reaction with oxygen leading to formation of 2PG+3PGA.
  The 2PG is scavenged by the photorespiration pathway, in which two 2PG are converted
  to 3PGA with loss of CO2 and NH3. When this happens, the flux in the CBC must be
  increased relative to end-product synthesis to regenerate the RuBP that is consumed
  in the oxygenase reaction. Abbreviations: 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (1,3BPGA);
