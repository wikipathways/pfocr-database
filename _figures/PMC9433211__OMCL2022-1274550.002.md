caption: 'The neurological links and mutual regulatory mechanisms between ferroptosis
  and other models of cell death including necroptosis, autophagy, apoptosis, and
  pyroptosis. Top left shows that HSP90 and MPTP opening are the positive factors
  of both necroptosis and ferroptosis. Top right shows that several selective autophagy
  including ferritinophagy, lipophagy, clockophagy, BECN1-mediated system XC- inhibition,
  HSP90, and mitochondrial dysfunction promote ferroptosis by degrading ferritin,
  lipid droplets, ARNTL, and GPX4. Ferroptosis induces autophagy by promoting ER stress.
  Down left shows ferroptosis inhibits apoptosis through reducing the JNK signaling
  pathway activity. The p53 is the positive factors of both apoptosis and ferroptosis.
  Down right shows that ferroptosis promotes pyroptosis by improving iron-activated
  ROS through disrupting ferritin while suppresses pyroptosis by inhibiting Cas-1
  activity with GPX4. TRADD: TNF receptor-associated death domain; TRAF: TNF receptor-associated
