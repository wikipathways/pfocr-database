caption: 'Effect of BD exposure during adolescence on skeletal muscle metabolism and
  myokine secretion. When EtOH is consumed in large amounts, as in BD exposure, it
  arrives at other tissues like SKM. This EtOH generates a great amount of reactive
  oxygen species, which in the end lead to the appearance of oxidative stress. Consequently,
  the expression ratio of pAMPK/tAMPK increases, resulting in a stimulated AMPK function.
  The active AMPK, as an important energy status sensor, regulates several other proteins.
  On the one hand, it inhibits the expression of SREBP1 and mTOR, which, respectively,
  will decrease the lipid and protein synthesis; on the other hand, AMPK stimulates
  FOXO3a and ULK1 expressions. FOXO3a will result in the stimulation of the protein
  breakdown pathways: it promotes the initiation of autophagy; and increasing the
  Atrogin-1/MAFBX expression, it also activates the proteosome system. Besides, ULK1,
  together with FOXO3a, will stimulate the initiation of autophagy and the mitochondrial
  autophagy process (mitophagy). Additionally, the oxidative stress diminishes the
  expression of IRS-1, which will not stimulate Akt. This protein, when active, stimulates
  mTOR and inhibits FOXO3a; in this case, being inactive, it will produce the opposite
  effects, promoting a general IR process. Furthermore, EtOH exposition seriously
  affects myokine secretion to serum, increasing IL-6 and myostatin levels and decreasing
  BDNF, fractalkine, FGF21, irisin, LIF, and SPARC values. This altered pattern of
  secretion contributes to the muscular destruction, the insulin resistance, and to
  the development of a cognitive impairment. In summary, BD exposition promoted the
  lipolysis and protein degradation in SKM and inhibited protein synthesis and lipogenesis,
  also altering the insulin signaling pathway, contributing to a general IR process.
