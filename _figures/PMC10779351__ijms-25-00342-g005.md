caption: 'Illustration of Ferroptosis in Pancreatic Beta Cells and Its Relation to
  NADPH. This figure depicts the process of ferroptosis, a unique form of cell death
  characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, in the context of pancreatic
  beta cells in diabetes. Highlighted are the key elements leading to ferroptosis:
  elevated blood sugar and pro-inflammatory cytokines triggering oxidative stress
  and iron accumulation, promoting lipid peroxidation. The figure outlines the role
  of NADPH in both promoting ROS generation via NOX and supporting antioxidant defense
  through glutathione regeneration. It showcases the dual function of NADPH in influencing
  ferroptosis—as a substrate for ROS production and as a crucial element for cellular
  antioxidant mechanisms. Additionally, the figure underscores the impact of ferroptosis
  on pancreatic beta cells, including reduced insulin secretion and beta cell mass,
  contributing to the progression of diabetes. This visualization encapsulates the
  complex interplay between metabolic factors, oxidative stress, and cell death pathways,
  emphasizing the importance of understanding ferroptosis in diabetes for developing
  potential therapeutic interventions. Cartoon in Figure 5 was created with BioRender.com'
