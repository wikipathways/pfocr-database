caption: Mechanisms underlying SALL4 regulation and function in gastric cancer. YAP
  increases the transcription of SALL4. miR-16 downregulates the mRNA level of SALL4,
  while miR-188-5p expression positively correlates with SALL4 expression. SALL4 targets
  TGF-β1 and activates the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. HK-2 is another downstream
  target of SALL4, which promotes glycolysis in gastric cancer. In gastric cancer,
  CD44 and VEGF are also the downstream targets of SALL4, and are responsible for
  the oncogenic roles and angiogenesis respectively. Dual-regulated of EZH2 and KDM6A
  on SALL4 modulates tumor progression via Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in GC
