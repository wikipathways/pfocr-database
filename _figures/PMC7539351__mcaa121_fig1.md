caption: The impacts of phytohormones on cellulose synthesis and microtubule (MT)
  organization. Cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose
  synthase (CESA) complexes (CSC) that move along underlying cortical MT. CESAs are
  synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then transported via the Golgi
  and the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) to the PM, possibly via small CESA compartments
  (SmaCCs). Phytohormones regulate CESA expression. For example, the brassinosteroid
  (BR)-regulated transcription factor BES1 can directly bind to the promoter of CESAs,
  thus activating expression. Also, the gibberellin (GA)-mediated DELLA-NAC signalling
  pathway may regulate CESA expression and secondary wall biosynthesis. Besides transcriptional
  regulation, phytohormones can control post-translational modifications of CESAs.
  Here, BIN2, a negative regulator of BR signalling, negatively regulates CSC activity
  and cellulose synthesis by phosphorylating CESA1 in Arabidopsis. Some PM-localized
  receptor kinases provide links between hormone signalling and cellulose and cell
  wall synthesis. FEI1 and 2, two leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases, might interact
  with ACS, an important component for ethylene (ET) synthesis, which may regulate
  cellulose synthesis and cell expansion. The protein kinases THESEUS (THE1) and FERONIA
  (FER) might connect jasmonic acid (JA) signalling, cellulose synthesis and cell
  wall integrity. Notably, most of the links between phytohormone levels, signalling
  and cellulose synthesis are indirect and much work is needed to consolidate the
  connections and underlying mechanisms. MT organization and dynamics are regulated
  by phytohormones. For instance, auxin (IAA) impacts MT organization via the IAA-ABP1-ROP6-RIC1-KTN1
  pathway. Moreover, prefoldin (PFD) proteins can interact with DELLAs and then directly
  influence MT dimerization and behaviour. The data presented here derive from current
  studies on Arabidopsis.
