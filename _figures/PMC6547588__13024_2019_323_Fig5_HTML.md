caption: Involvement of LOAD risk factors at the BBB. Transport of Aβ through endothelial
  transcytosis is PICALM-dependent and a major pathway for clearing Aβ from the brain.
  Aβ-bound ApoE and free Aβ bind the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  1 (LRP1) that associates with PICALM during transcytosis. CD2AP contributes in the
  upkeep of BBB integrity through a process hypothesized to involve its binding-partner
  Rac1. Endothelial CD2AP further interacts with VCAM (CD106) and ICAM-1 (CD54), affecting
  immune cell extravasation
