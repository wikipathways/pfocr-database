caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. SARS-CoV-2 enters target cells
  through an endosomal pathway by S proteins binding to cellular receptor angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). Following entry of the virus into the host cells, the viral RNA
  is unveiled in the cytoplasm. The complex drives the production of negative-sense
  RNAs through both replication and transcription. Finally viral nucleocapsids are
  assembled from genomic RNA and N protein in the cytoplasm. Virions are then released
  from the infected cell through exocytosis.
