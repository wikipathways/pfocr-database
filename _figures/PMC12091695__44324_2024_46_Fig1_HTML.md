caption: '1) Enhanced LDL-cholesterol uptake: Under hypoxic/ischemic conditions, macrophages/microglia
  show increased expression of LDL-receptor (LDLR) and increased internalization of
  LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). 2) Activation of ACAT1/SOAT1: Hypoxic/ischemic conditions
  promote increased cholesterol uptake along with increased ACAT1/SOAT1 activity which
  increases CE formation. 3) ROS mediated oxidation of CE: Ischemia induces ROS formation,
  which leads to CE oxidation (Ox-CE) via activation of radical and nonradical modification
  pathways69. 4) Induction of Inflammation signaling: Ox-CE can activate TREM1 through
  TLR459,68. TREM1 induces inflammation by activating the DAP12/Syk (spleen tyrosine
  kinase) signaling cascade. TREM1 inhibition decreases levels of inflammatory cytokines65.
  5) Release of proinflammatory cytokines: The nuclear factor-κB (NFκβ) signaling
  pathway is induced by TREM1, which leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  such as IL6, IL1β, TNFα, MCSF41,70 6) Retinal neovascularization: Activated macrophages/microglia
  play a key role in regulating angiogenesis and are critically involved in the pathogenesis
