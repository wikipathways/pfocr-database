caption: A bird’s-eye view of the reactions summarized in this review. Simple dopa
  and dopamine after the initial oxidation to their corresponding quinones often exhibit
  intramolecular cyclization and further oxidation to dihydroxyindolic compounds which
  suffer oxidative polymerization to produce melanin pigments. Although the reactive
  species formed in the pathway can exhibit external reactivities to a certain extent,
  mostly internal reactions seem to dominate in the case of dopa and dopamine. On
  the other hand, NADA and NBAD, which are major sclerotizing precursors for hardening
  and strengthening the exoskeletons of insects, mostly exhibit external reactivities
  and glue to structural proteins and carbohydrate polymers, generating different
  kinds of biomaterials. Peptidyl dopa derivatives as well as peptidyl dehydrodopa
  derivatives also show mostly external reactivities and produce biomaterials exhibiting
  different strengths and elasticities. All biopolymers formed from catecholamines
  are capable of exhibiting antioxidant as well as antibiotic properties to varying
  degrees.
