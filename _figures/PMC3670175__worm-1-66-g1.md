caption: Figure 1. Downregulation of nhr-49 by RNAi affects the abundance of proteins
  involved in fatty acid metabolism. Stable amino acid labeling and quantitative proteomics
  was use to identify the differentially expressed proteins in L4 stage nematodes
  treated with nhr-49 RNAi compared with empty vector controls. Among the regulated
  proteins, enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, especially peroxisomal β-oxidation,
  are significantly overrepresented. The indicated protein is known or predicted,
  based on sequence homology to yeast or mouse orthologs, to be involved in the indicated
  biochemical pathway. Green and red indicate proteins that become less and more abundant,
  respectively, in response to RNAi mediated knock down of nhr-49.
