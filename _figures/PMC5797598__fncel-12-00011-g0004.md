caption: Neuromodulation in sickness and behavioral immunity (blue) Drosophila can
  avoid feeding or laying eggs on infected food by detecting geosmin produced by some
  fungi, bacteria and cyanobacteria. Geosmin activates ORNs expressing OR56a that
  project to the DA2 glomerulus in the antennal lobe. They form synaptic contacts
  with projection neurons specific for this pathway. (red) In infected flies, octopaminergic
  neurons (OA neurons) can detect peptidoglycan, a component of the bacterial cell
  wall, and induce a decrease in egg-laying in infected flies. (black) Peptidoglycan
  also activates the innate immune response via the IMD and Toll pathways that lead
  to the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Studies from C. elegans and
  honeybees suggest that serotonin could form the link between the malaise caused
  by the ingestion of a pathogen or a toxin and the learned avoidance of the infected
  food.
