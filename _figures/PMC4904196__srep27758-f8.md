caption: In normal conditions, PCs use glucose as a primary energy resource, which
  is metabolized to pyruvate via the glycolysis pathway, which involves the glycolytic
  enzyme NSE (NSE promoter is ON). The pyruvate is oxidized and enters the tricarboxylic
  (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria to generate ATP. In the traumatic brain injury,
  high amounts of glutamate are released from injured cells, which in turn excites
  neurons to further release the glutamate. The excess amount of extracellular glutamate
  is taken up by BG that were activated by cytokines released from activated microglia.
  In the activated BG, the NSE promoter is activated to produce the NSE, which converts
  glucose into lactate, with the subsequent transfer of lactate to neurons (astrocyte-neuron
  lactate shuttle). The lactate inhibits glycolysis in the PCs through hydroxycarboxylic
  acid receptor 1 (HCA1), leading to suppression of the NSE promoter activity in PCs
  and facilitating lactate metabolization into pyruvate.
