caption: SKP2-p27 axis. The SKP2-p27 axis is a critical regulatory pathway governing
  cell cycle progression and proliferation. SKP2, a component of the SCF complex,
  targets the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 for ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation. This ubiquitin-mediated destruction of p27 relieves its
  inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression, allowing cells to transition from G1
  to S phase. Dysregulation of the SKP2-p27 axis is implicated in various cancers
  (solid and, including hematological malignancies), emphasizing its pivotal role
  in maintaining proper cell cycle control and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic
  targetin various malignancies
