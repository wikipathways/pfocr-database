caption: 'Fig. 1: Cobalamin metabolism and corresponding causes of deficiency. Causes
  of cobalamin deficiency are shown in blue. The metabolic pathway starts when (1)
  dietary cobalamin (Cbl), obtained through animal foods, enters the stomach bound
  to animal proteins (P). (2) Pepsin and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach sever
  the animal protein, releasing free cobalamin. Most of the free cobalamin is then
  bound to R-protein (R), which is released from the parietal and salivary cells.
  Intrinsic factor (IF) is also secreted in the stomach, but its binding to cobalamin
  is weak in the presence of gastric and salivary R-protein. (3) In the duodenum,
  dietary cobalamin bound to R-protein is joined by cobalamin–R-protein complexes
  that have been secreted in the bile. Pancreatic enzymes degrade both biliary and
  dietary cobalamin–R-protein complexes, releasing free cobalamin. (4) The cobalamin
  then binds with intrinsic factor. The cobalamin–intrinsic factor complex remains
  undisturbed until the distal 80 cm of the ileum, where (5) it attaches to mucosal
  cell receptors (cubilin) and the cobalamin is bound to transport proteins known
  as transcobalamin I, II and III (TCI, TCII and TCIII). Transcobalamin II, although
  it represents only a small fraction (about 10%) of the transcobalamins, is the most
  important because it is able to deliver cobalamin to all cells in the body. The
  cobalamin is subsequently transported systemically via the portal system. (6) Within
  each cell, the transcobalamin II–cobalamin complex is taken up by means of endocytosis
  and the cobalamin is liberated and then converted enzymatically into its 2 coenzyme
  forms, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin (this process is shown in greater detail
  in Fig. 2).*Nitrous oxide, a general anesthetic, causes multiple defects in cobalamin
  use, most of which are intracellular and clinically relevant only in people who
  have low or borderline-low serum cobalamin levels. Photo: Christine Kenney'
