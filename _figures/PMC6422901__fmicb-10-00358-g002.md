caption: 'Schematic for arachidonic acid (AA) pathway: phospholipids from the plasma
  membrane are mobilized and converted to AA by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme activity.
  Cyclooxygenase 1 (constitutive) and cyclooxygenase 2 (inducible) enzymes catalyze
  the synthesis of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) from AA through an unstable intermediate
  PGG2 (; ). PGH2 is converted by microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES) to PGE2,
  which is released in the microenvironment. Besides PGE2, other prostanoids formed
  from PGH2 include PGI2, TXA2, PGD2, and PGF2α (). In human cells, generally, four
  types of LOs, namely, 5-, 12-, and 15-LO-1 and -2 have been identified. 5LO in conjunction
  with its activating protein, FLAP, catalyze the dioxygenation of AA into give 5-hydroperoxy
  eicosapentaenoic acid (5-HpETE). 5LO, with FLAP, then catalyze a second step, the
  dehydration of 5-HpETE to the intermediate LTA4, that leads to the formation of
  the leukotrienes and lipoxins (). Hydrolysis of LTA4 is catalyzed by LTA4 hydrolase
  (LTA4H) to produce LTB4. LTA4 is also metabolized by the enzyme LTC4 synthase to
  produce LTC4, which is acted upon by γ-glutamyl-transpeptidases to yield LTD4. LTD4
  is acted upon by a dipeptidase (DiP) to produce LTE4. The combination of LO, -5,
  -12, or -15 on the same arachidonic acid molecule produces lipoxins.'
