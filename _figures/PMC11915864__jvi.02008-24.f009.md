caption: A model of RNF20 demonstrates dual regulation of the chicken MDA5-IFN-β signaling
  pathway by targeting chMDA5 (created using Figdraw). When the RLR signaling pathway
  is inactive, RNF20 maintains chMDA5 transcription in the nucleus. Upon viral infection,
  the RLR signaling pathway is activated, causing RNF20 to translocate from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, RNF20 interacts with chMDA5, catalyzing its
  K27 and K48-linked polyubiquitination, leading to chMDA5 degradation
