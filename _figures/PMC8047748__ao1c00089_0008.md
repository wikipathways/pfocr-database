caption: Illustration of the transformation pathway for BaTiO3 precursor powders from
  an aqueous solution, from an amorphous network (step 1) at low temperatures to crystallization
  of BaTiO3 (step 3) through reaction of the intermediate phases (step 2). The intermediate
  phases consist locally of small domains of BaCO3 with a calcite structure and a
  Ti-rich phase with a BaTi4O9 structure, although there is limited long-range order
  for both phases. Structures made by VESTA.
