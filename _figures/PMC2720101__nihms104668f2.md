caption: Viral infection of cells initiates the homo-dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation
  and activation of interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase
  (PKR). Activated PKR phosphorylates its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of
  eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha), leading to the inhibition
  of cellular protein synthesis. HSV-1 encodes for γ34.5, a viral protein that mediated
  protein phosphatase 1α to dephosphorylate EIF2-alpha, releasing the translational
  block initiated in normal cells upon infection. In the absence of viral γ34.5 gene
  the viral replication is blocked by cellular responses in normal cells. Cancer cells
  with an activated RAS/MEK pathway suppress PKR autophosphorylation, hence allowing
  γ34.5−/− virus to replicate in them.
