caption: PGE2 Promotes Immunoregulation through Cross-Regulation between β-catenin
  and NF-κB by Activating the Wnt-β-catenin Signaling Pathways. (A) Without the Wnt
  ligand, β-catenin is bound by GSK-3β, Axin, and APC. This binding-stimulated phosphorylation
  of β-catenin by GSK-3β leads to the ubiquitination of β-catenin, which is further
  degraded by proteasomes. (B) When the Wnt ligand binds to the Fz receptor and the
  LRP co-receptor, activation of the canonical Wnt signal occurs, followed by activation
  of Dvl and inhibition of GSK-3β. To regulate gene transcription, β-catenin accumulates
  in the nucleus and binds to T cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factors (TCF/LEF).
  (C) PGE2 stimulates a double signaling cascade through the EP2 receptor via PI3K
  and protein kinase Akt activation involving the free G-protein βγ subunit and the
  direct association of the G-protein αs subunit to Axin. Following PGE2 activation
  in these two pathways, unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm,
  then enters the nucleus and inhibits the transcription factor of NF-κB (D). The
  activity of β-catenin can inhibit NF-κB via two possible mechanisms—by stabilizing
  IκBα or by binding to NF-κB subunit p50—which prevents its transport from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus and also occurs in the nucleus. Both mechanisms can cause a decrease
  in the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. The inhibition of NF-κB by β-catenin activation
  reduces inflammation. This figure was created using the BioRender online app and
