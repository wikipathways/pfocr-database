caption: '(A) Initially, the follicular growth that begins during gestation is gonadotropin-independent,
  although granulosa cells are influenced by FSH. The post-natal phases are gonadotrophin-dependent,
  and FSH influences the transition of the GCs of the larger antral follicles to the
  ovulatory follicles. After birth, folliculogenesis, a highly regulated process,
  can be classified into three phases: follicle growth, transition and maturation,
  and ovulation. In humans and mice, five stages of follicular development are described:
  primordial follicles, primary follicles, secondary follicles (preantral), antral
  follicles, and preovulatory follicles (Graafian). The phase of follicle transition
  from the preantral stage to the early antral stage and follicle growth and maturation
  is dependent on stimulus by FSH and LH (gonadotropin-dependent phase), which play
  an obligatory role in follicle differentiation, selection, and survival. (B) FSH
  actions in folliculogenesis, including in the induction of GCs proliferation and
  stimulation of GCs in the estradiol production by aromatase (CYP19A1) conversion
  of the androgens produced by theca cells (i.e., dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol,
  androstenedione, and testosterone) from cholesterol in responding to LH (steroidogenesis).
  The interaction of the FSH-FSHR localized in the membrane surfaces of GCs activates
  adenylyl cyclase and stimulates the proliferation of CG cells by activating the
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA), mitogen-activated protein
  kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), and PI3K/Akt pathways.
  In particular, cAMP/PKA promotes the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding
  (CREB) protein and other proteins that promote an increase in the expressions of
  genes that encode the growth factors and proteins involved in steroid hormone production
  and cellular growth. This gonadotropin can impede the apoptosis of GCs via the PI3K/Akt
  pathway.'
