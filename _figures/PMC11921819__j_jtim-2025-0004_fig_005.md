caption: Cuproptosis in Tumor Immunity. Tumor cells undergoing cuproptosis release
  various DAMPs (such as ATP, HMGB1, and CRT), which promote the maturation of dendritic
  cells (DCs) and the activation of CD8+ effector T cells. Cuproptosis enhances antitumor
  immunity by modulating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This pathway is activated
  in dendritic cells by tumor cells experiencing cuproptosis, subsequently promoting
  the release of inflammatory mediators. Tumor cells also release lysyl oxidase-like
  4 (LOXL4), which, when encountered by macrophages ex vivo, induces an immunosuppressive
  phenotype and activates the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), further
  inhibiting the function of CD8+ T cells
