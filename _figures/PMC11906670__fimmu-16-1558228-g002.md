caption: 'Biosynthesis pathways and receptors of AA-derived eicosanoids and their
  influence on cDC migration. Eicosanoids are bioactive lipids primarily derived from
  AA, a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid released from membrane phospholipids
  by cPLA2. AA metabolism occurs through two main biosynthetic pathways: the COX pathway
  and the LOX pathway. In the COX pathway, constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2
  enzymes convert AA into PGH2, a precursor for various prostanoids, including prostaglandins,
  prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. PGE2, synthesized via COX-2 and PGES, acts on EP1-4
  receptors. PGE2 signaling through EP2 and EP4 receptors on cDCs enhances CCR7 expression
  and function, promoting cDC migration toward dLNs and facilitating their localization
  within the T cell areas. PGD2, produced through the COX-2/PGDS pathway, signals
  via DP1 and DP2 (CRTH2) receptors. Unlike PGE2, PGD2 signaling through DP1 receptors
  on DCs downregulates CCR7 expression and enhances their ability to promote Th2 cell
  differentiation. In the LOX pathway, 5-LOX converts AA into 5-HPETE and LTA4. LTA4
  is further processed into leukotrienes. LTC4 synthase/LTC4S catalyzes the formation
  of LTC4, which is subsequently converted to LTD4 and LTE4. LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4,
  collectively known as cysteinyl leukotrienes, interact with CysLT1, CysLT2, and
  CysLT3 receptors. On DCs, CysLT1 receptor signaling supports CCR7-mediated mobilization
  of cDCs from peripheral tissues to dLNs. Additionally, LTA4 hydrolase/LTA4H produces
  LTB4, which binds to BLT1 and BLT2 receptors and acts as a potent chemoattractant
  for neutrophils. Overall, during steady-state and type 1/type 17 immune responses,
  the PGE2 signaling pathway enhances CCR7 expression and CCR7-dependent cDC migration.
  However, during the initiation of type 2 immunity, the LOX and COX pathways are
  activated and interact, particularly through mediators such as LTC4, LTD4, and PGD2.
  This coordinated mechanism promotes Th2 cell-mediated immunity while ensuring efficient
  guidance of DCs to dLNs under conditions of reduced CCR7 activity. Figure created
