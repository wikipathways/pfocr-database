caption: The effect of AAA risk genes on the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic
  complications in the KEGG database. (a) Boxes with red outlining indicate proteins
  or related complexes encoded by AAA risk-related genes, and boxes surrounded by
  orange indicate that the corresponding coding gene contains a miRSNP in the 3′-UTR.
  (b) Schematic diagram of the miRSNP-miRNA-gene-pathway axis. The yellow ellipse
  indicates a risk gene, the blue ellipse indicates miRNA, and the red five-pointed
  star indicates that the miRNA target relationship has been experimentally verified.
  We marked the SNP of the target gene on line between the miRNA and the risk gene.
  A red outer circle represents the pathway, green represents the AGE-RAGE signaling
  pathway in diabetic complications, and blue represents the TGF-beta signaling pathway.
