caption: 'Activation of mGlu5 receptors triggers diverse distinct and converging signalling
  pathways. The group I mGlu receptor family preferentially couples to Gq, leading
  to activation of the canonical PLC–IP3–DAG–Ca2+pathway. As reviewed in the text,
  mGlu5 receptors promiscuously couple to other G proteins as well as alternate second
  messengers and kinases via mechanisms that can be independent of Ca2+ mobilization.
  Protein–protein interactions with scaffolding and regulatory proteins (blue ovals)
  add further diversity: integrating different signalling pathways, directly mediating
  interactions between mGlu5 receptors and ion channels such as the NMDA receptor
  and regulating the activity of the mGlu5 receptor itself. As an additional level
  of complexity, the signalling pathways and effectors stimulated by mGlu5 receptor
  activation also show considerable cell type dependence.'
