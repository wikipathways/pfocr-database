caption: Representative working modes of mutant p53 GOF. (A) p53-R249S is phosphorylated
  by CDK4/cyclin D1 and translocated into the nucleus as mediated by PIN1. The nuclear
  R249S binds to and augments c-Myc activity, leading to enhanced ribosome biogenesis
  and proliferation. (B) Mutant p53 prompts TGF-β-mediated EMT and metastasis by binding
  to Smad2/3. The interaction between mutant p53 and Smads leads to elevation of the
  downstream EMT and metastasis genes. Also, mutant p53, Smads, and TAp63 form a ternary
  complex that suppresses the anti-metastasis activity of TAp63. (C) Mutant p53 interferes
  with the assembly of the Mre11–Rad50–NBS1 complex on DNA double-stranded breaks,
  leading to genome instability. (D) Mutant p53 transcriptionally induces RhoGD1 and
  RhoGEF-H1 (; ) through mechanisms to be identified, which elicits RhoA–ROCK–GLUT1
  cascade, leading to increased aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, mutant p53 binds
  to the transcription factor SREBP, leading to the activated mevalonate pathway responsible
  for the regulation of lipid metabolism. (E) Mutant p53 modulates redox and proteasome
  by interacting with NRF2. Mutant p53 can induce and repress NRF2 target genes to
  control the glutathione (GSH) level and the redox balance. Moreover, mutant p53
  promotes the expression of NRF2 target genes involved in proteasome machinery, leading
  to increased proteasomal degradation of tumor suppressors. (F) Mutant p53 suppresses
  apoptosis by directly binding to caspases. Upon external and/or internal stimuli,
  the initiator caspases, caspase-8, and caspase-9, can proteolytically activate the
  effector caspases, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, thus triggering the caspase-dependent
  apoptosis. However, mutant p53 can interact with and inhibit caspase-8, caspase-9,
  and caspase-3 to compromise the caspase-dependent apoptosis. In conclusion, p53
  mutants execute their oncogenic GOF by interacting with transcription factors or
  cofactors to promote (A, B, D, E) or repress (B, E) gene expression, or with proteins
  irrelevant to transcription (C, F). mtp53 indicates mutant p53.
