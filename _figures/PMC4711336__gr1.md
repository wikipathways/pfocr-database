caption: TGF-β signaling and regulation. (A) Active TGF-β is prevented from binding
  to receptors due to incorporation with ‘ligand trap proteins’ such as latency-associated
  peptide (LAP). (B) Binding of TGF-β to the Type II TGF-β receptor leads to phosphorylation
  of the Type I TGF-β receptor intracellular domain and activation of the Smad signaling
  pathway, in addition to Smad-independent signaling including MAPK pathways. (C)
  Decoy receptors such as BAMBI bind TGF-β but prevent downstream signaling. (D) Smad7,
  an inhibitory Smad, binds to the phosphorylated Type I TGF-β receptor and prevents
  downstream signaling.
