caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis annotates the differential proteins with biological
  and cellular functions and then calculates which of these biological and cellular
  processes are significantly overrepresented within the list of differential proteins.
  Further, Ingenuity constructs a network of all the proteins involved in the overrepresented
  biological functions. Figure 2 presents an overview of the proteins exclusively
  expressed in either meningioma (in red) or arachnoidal (in green) cells and involved
  in the most significant overrepresented processes namely DNA replication, Recombination,
  and Repair, Cancer and Cell Cycle; and shows the direct relationships between the
  proteins as described in literature. Ingenuity constructed a highly significant
  functional network involved in DNA replication, Recombination, and Repair, Cancer,
  Cell Cycle of protein exclusively expressed in either meningioma (in red) or arachnoidal
  (in green) cells.
