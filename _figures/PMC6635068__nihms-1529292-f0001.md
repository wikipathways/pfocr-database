caption: 'Left (DNA): Wild-type RB1 may be lost through genomic alterations (e.g.,
  deletions, missense/nonsense mutations, indels or rearrangements) or epigenomic
  modifications (e.g., methylation of the RB1 gene promoter). Fluorescence in situ
  hybridization (FISH) is a method for detecting gene copy losses or rearrangements
  but not point mutations or indels; however, FISH can be performed from very sparse
  material and allows for in situ visualization of intratumoral heterogeneity. Next
  generation sequencing that includes exonic regions of the RB1 gene locus may be
  performed from clinical biopsy specimens or circulating tumor DNA to detect point
  mutations and indels; these assays also detect rearrangements when located within
  exonic regions and can usually identify mono- or bi-allelic deletions, though copy
  number losses are more challenging to detect in samples with low tumor DNA content.
  Whole genome sequencing would be required to detect complex genomic alterations
  outside exonic regions of RB1 (not depicted), and specific assays such as bisulfite
  sequencing would be required to detect epigenetic modifications of the RB1 gene.
  Middle (Protein): Biallelic loss of the RB1 gene locus leads to loss of RB1 protein
  expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), but point mutations and frame shifts may
  result in expression of a hypofunctional or truncated polypeptide product that could
  potentially be recognized by RB1 antibodies for IHC. Non-genomic alterations such
  as epigenetic modifications, decrease in gene transcription/translation, or increased
  degradation could lead to decreased Rb protein levels by IHC, but the degree of
  decrease in levels may be indeterminate with regards to functional outcomes. Right
  (mRNA): Transcriptome-based assays may be performed from clinical biopsy specimens.
  RNA-based assays may not be able to distinguish upstream mechanisms of Rb pathway
  loss.'
