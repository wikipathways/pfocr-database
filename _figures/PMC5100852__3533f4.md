caption: Sequential methylation (red) and Kennedy (blue) pathways for biosynthesis
  of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCholine) in C. elegans. The sequential methylation pathway
  starts with phosphoethanolamine (pEA) to produce phosphocholine (pCholine) through
  two methylation steps catalyzed by the phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferases,
  PMT-1 and PMT-2 (). Phosphomonomethylethanolamine (pMME) and phosphodimethylethanolamine
  (pDME) are the methylated intermediates. pCholine is also produced by phosphorylation
  of choline by choline kinases. pCholine is converted to cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline
  by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase PCYT-1. Finally, PtdCholine is produced
  by the choline-ethanolamine phosphotransferases CEPT-1 or CEPT-2 using diacylglycerol
  and CDP-choline as substrates.
