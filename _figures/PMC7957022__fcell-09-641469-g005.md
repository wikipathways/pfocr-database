caption: The main signaling pathways responsible for therapeutic resistance mediated
  by the tumor environment. Tumor cells can adaptively inhibit oncogenic AKT, which
  induces the secretion of inflammatory molecules such as IL-6/8, and EVs to restrict
  damage during therapy. The ATM-TRAF6-TAK1 axis related with DNA damage may also
  be involved in resistance. Some metabolites, such as lactate, in the TME have been
  reported to activate the mTOR pathway through glutamine metabolic pathways, inducing
  resistance to VEGF inhibitors. In addition, the STAT3 pathway may also rapidly respond
  to cytokines, promoting the secretion of exosomes, by upregulating Rab and increasing
  anti-apoptotic signaling in the TME. IL-6 and exosomes derived from the stroma deliver
  Jag1, Notch ligand, and Notch3 activate the Notch pathway to trigger resistance.
