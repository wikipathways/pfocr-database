caption: High‐risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection disrupts the molecular pathways
  that regulate epithelial differentiation and cell proliferation. Cell cycle progression
  is regulated in the different epithelial layers by members of the pRb (retinoblastoma)
  family of proteins. The E7 proteins of high‐risk HPV types can target members of
  this protein family for degradation (shown in B). This releases members of the E2F
  transcription factor family, which allows basal and parabasal cells to enter S‐phase.
  In uninfected epithelium (shown in A), the release of E2F is dependent on external
  growth factors, which stimulate cyclinD/cdk activity to allow pRb phosphorylation
  and E2F release. The expression of cellular proteins involved in cell cycle progression
  is regulated by p16INK4A, which is involved in a negative feedback loop by suppressing
  the activity of the cyclinD/cdk. The inability of low‐risk HPV types to drive robust
  basal cell proliferation is thought to be because these types can only efficiently
  target the p130 retinoblastoma family member, which controls suprabasal, but not
  basal cell cycle entry. The high‐risk E7 proteins are thought to target all members
  of the pRb family. In addition to E7, high‐risk HPVs encode a second protein involved
  in cell cycle entry. This is the E6 protein, which acts to suppress the rise in
  p53 that would otherwise occur following E7‐mediated elevation in p14 levels. (shown
  in B) Elevated p14 leads to inactivation of the MDM protein that is normally involved
  in degrading p53. High‐risk E6 proteins directly regulate p53 levels in the cell
  by mediating its ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome pathway. In uninfected
  cells (shown in A), p53 levels are maintained at a low level, partly as a result
  of the normal activity of MDM

  description: High‐risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection disrupts the molecular
    pathways that regulate epithelial differentiation and cell proliferation. Cell
    cycle progression is regulated in the different epithelial layers by members of
    the pRb (retinoblastoma) family of proteins. The E7 proteins of high‐risk HPV
    types can target members of this protein family for degradation (shown in B).
    This releases members of the E2F transcription factor family, which allows basal
    and parabasal cells to enter S‐phase. In uninfected epithelium (shown in A), the
