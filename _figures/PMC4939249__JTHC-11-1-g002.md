caption: 'Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) signal transduction pathway in the collecting
  duct. Vasopressin binds to the V2 receptor on the basolateral surface of the principal
  cells of the collecting duct of the kidney. The receptor couples to Gs (a heterotrimeric
  GTP-binding protein), which then binds to adenylate cyclase and increases cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a multimeric
  protein. When activated by cAMP, it phosphorylates the acuaporin-2 (AQP-2) molecule,
  where it is delivered via cytoplasmic vesicles to the apical surface of the collecting
  duct. The water channels then allow a single file of water molecules to traverse
  the apical membrane in response to the osmotic gradient where they are returned
  to the circulation. (Adapted from Sanghi P, Uretsky BF, Schwarz ER. Vasopressin
