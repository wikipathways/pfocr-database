caption: The mechanisms of action for immune checkpoint inhibitors include the CTLA-4
  pathway (on the left, panels (A) and (B)) and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (on the right,
  panels (C) and (D)). Normally, CTLA-4 is present on the surface of T-cells and by
  binding to its ligands, CD80 and CD86 (expressed on antigen-presenting cells), it
  exerts an inhibitory effect on the T-cell proliferation (A). Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies
  (a variety of ICIs) bind to CTLA-4 and block its inhibitory effects, stimulating
  T-cell proliferation (B). Similarly, T-cells express PD-1, which binds to its ligand,
  PD-L1, present on cancer cells, suppressing T-cell proliferation (C). Anti-PD-1
  antibodies bind to PD-1 blocking its inhibitory effects and stimulating T-cell proliferation
  (D).
