caption: Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate and lactate, providing pyruvate for
  the TCA cycle. In the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA and enters
  the TCA cycle by combining with OAA to form citrate. Citrate export out of the mitochondria
  maintains the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool needed for lipid synthesis and protein modifications.
  While providing reducing equivalents for OXPHOS and ATP production, the TCA cycle
  generates substrates for the biosynthesis of proteins, nucleotides, and lipids.
  Although glucose and fatty acid breakdown support mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production
  in adipocytes, carbon from amino acid sources also maintains the TCA cycle. Glutamine
  can serve as an anaplerotic substrate for the TCA cycle, providing a-KG and allowing
  preservation of the cycle in conditions of mitochondrial stress. BCAAs also represent
  anaplerotic sources in adipocytes, providing acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA to the
  TCA cycle. In Acly+/+ adipocytes, glucose is the primary contributor to the cytosolic
  acetyl-CoA pool. However, adipocyte-specific deletion of ACLY reveals a compensatory
  pathway that requires ACSS2 to maintain the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool. ACSS2 converts
  acetate derived from the gut microbiota or re-capture from the epigenome into acetyl-CoA
  for lipogenesis and protein modifications, including histone acetylation. Other
  short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota promote histone acetylation by
  inhibiting histone deacetylases.
