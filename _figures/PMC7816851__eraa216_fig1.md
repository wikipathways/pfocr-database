caption: Schematic representation of the gene regulatory network controlled by FLC.
  (A) FLC is a master regulator of flowering that integrates cues from several flowering
  pathways in Arabidopsis. FLC expression is repressed by the cold-induced vernalization
  pathway. FLC directly represses the florigen-encoding gene FT and SQUAMOSA PROMOTER
  BINDING-LIKE PROTEIN 15 (SPL15). SPL15 is additionally post-translationally regulated
  by the gibberellin pathway via DELLA proteins and at the post-transcriptional level
  by the ageing pathway via miR156. The MADS-domain protein SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION
  OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) is encoded by another direct target of FLC, and cooperates with
  SPL15 to activate target genes such as FRUITFULL and MIR172B. (B) A type II coherent
  feed-forward loop regulates expression of the positive floral regulator TARGET OF
  FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1). FLC and SVP directly repress TFS1 transcription and that of
  its positive activator SOC1. Activation of TFS1 expression in the inflorescence
  meristem also involves SPL9.
