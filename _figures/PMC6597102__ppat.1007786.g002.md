caption: Surface adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and EPCR are known molecules facilitating
  binding of PfEMP-1 expressed on iRBCs. Induction of a signaling cascade triggers
  the transcription of TNF family members and chemokines. Binding of TNFR-2 and LT-βR
  activates the NF-κB pathway, inducing the CXCL10 and CCL2 recruit immune cells,
  such as CD8+ T cells. Barrier integrity is maintained by tight junction proteins
  (claudins and occludins) and adherens junction proteins (cadherins and catenins).
  Pericytes are recruited and maintained at the BBB by the PDGFβ-PDGFRβ signaling
  axis. Pericyte production of TGF-β promotes adhesion of endothelial cells to the
  basement membrane via induction of N-cadherin and up-regulates claudin-5 as well
  as down-regulates the inflammatory capacity of astrocytes. apoE is hypothesized
  to down-regulate pericyte-induced regulation of endothelial cell tight junctions.
  Astrocytes can be pro-inflammatory, secreting a variety of cytokine and chemokines
  that include CXCL10, CCL2, IL-6, IL-1β, IFNs, and growth factors such as VEGF. The
  expression of cytokine receptors such as the IL-6R/gp130 complex and IFNAR facilitate
  responses of astrocytes in the context of an inflammatory response. During inflammation,
  astrocytes form a physical barrier at the BBB via claudin 1/4 in a structure called
  the glial limitans perivascularis, which regulates immune cell and molecule trafficking.
  Astrocytes are implicated in regulating BBB integrity via Ang-I/II derived from
  secreted angiotensinogen. Ang-II promotes the formation and maintenance of endothelial
  tight junctions via binding to the AT-1 expressed on endothelial cells. SHH is also
  secreted from astrocytes and has been shown to up-regulate occludin and claudin-5
  on BMECs by signaling through the PTCH1 receptor. BDNF and GDNF are important for
  growth and survival factors secreted from astrocytes, and BDNF is reported to be
  reduced in the peripheral blood stream of CM patients. Ang-I/II, angiopoietin-I/II;
