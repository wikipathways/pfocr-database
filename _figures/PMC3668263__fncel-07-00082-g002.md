caption: LRRK2 regulates cell biological functions important for neurogenesis. Several
  lines of evidence support roles for LRRK2 in microtubule function, endocytosis/vesicle
  trafficking and autophagy. LRRK2 is likely to impact upon neurite outgrowth and
  the latter stages of neurogenesis through direct association with membrane structures
  and microtubules and/or regulation of signaling pathways. In addition, LRRK2 has
  been implicated in proliferation and may therefore also govern early stages of neurogenesis.
  The interaction between microtubule function, vesicle trafficking, autophagy and
  proliferation and the canonical Wnt pathway is depicted but other pathways are likely
  to play additional roles.
