caption: AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. In HCC genomic amplification
  (8q22 gain), downregulation of miRNA-375 and stabilization of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC protein
  by monoubiquitination have been identified as potential mechanisms of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
  overexpression. Microarray analysis identified AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC downstream genes
  (left box). AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC increases LEF-1 with resultant activation of β-catenin
  pathway. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC induces the transcription factor late SV40 factor (LSF)
  which transcriptionally regulates osteopontin (OPN), matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP9), and thymidylate synthase (TS). AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC downregulates insulin-like
  growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7), an inducer of senescence. Right box shows
  AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC-interacting proteins identified in HCC cells. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
  interacts with staphylococcal nuclease domain containing-1 (SND1) and together these
  two proteins increase RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activity that facilitates
  oncogenic miRNA-mediated degradation of tumor suppressor mRNAs. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
  interacts with the translational machinery that potentially facilitates association
  of specific mRNAs, such as multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and coagulation factor
  XII (FXII), to polysome increasing their translation. The net effects of these events
  are augmentation of hallmarks of cancer.
