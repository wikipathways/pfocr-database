caption: 'SLAMF receptors modulate cancer progression. The regulatory roles of SLAMF
  receptors in cancer depend on both the specific types of SLAMF receptors and the
  type of cancer. a The homophilic interaction of SLAMF3 between leukemia cells and
  T cells contributes to activating T cells, and the SLAMF2-SLAMF4 interaction between
  them initiates cytotoxic anti-tumor effects mediated by T cells. However, the homophilic
  interaction of SLAMF7 between NK cells and leukemia cells inhibits the tumor killing
  effects mediated by NK cells. Moreover, SLAMF5 expressed on leukemia cells promote
  tumor progression by upregulating the PD-1 expression on effective T cells as well
  as the PD-L1 expression on leukemia cells. b The homophilic interaction of SLAMF7
  between NK cells and MM cells or T cells and MM cells inhibits the anti-tumor responses
  mediated by NK cells or T cells. SLAMF3 expressed on MM cells also promotes tumor
  progression by activating the RASAL3-RAS-Erk signaling pathway. Moreover, other
  immune cells infiltrated in TME contributes to MM progression. SLAMF7+Treg cells
  can inhibit the function of T cells, and SLAMF5+MDSCs can induce immunosuppressive
  signaling pathways. c The interaction of SLAMF4 and SLAMF2 expressed on NK cells
  and lymphoma cells respectively enhance the anti-tumor effects mediated by NK cells.
  In addition, the activation of SLAMF8 expressed on lymphoma cells promote cancer
  progression, but the specific mechanisms are unknown. d In CRC, the interaction
  of SLAMF4 and SLAMF2 between NK cells and target tumor cells enhances cytotoxic
  effects. However, SLAMF8+macrophages and SLAMF4+MDSCs promote tumor progression.
  e The homophilic combination of SLAMF3 expressed on HCC cells and adjacent hepatocytes
  can promote tumor apoptosis while inhibiting cancer progression. Moreover, SLAMF7+ macrophages
  can inhibit MAPK-ATF-2-mediated CCL2 production, which further inhibit the formation
  and migration of type 2 macrophages. In contrast, the SLAMF2 stimulated by growth
  differentiation factor 15 can promote tumor progression by inhibiting ERK-AP-1 signaling
  pathway. f The combination of SLAMF4 and SLAMF2 respectively expressed on NK cells
  and melanoma cells enhances killing effects, which can be impaired by their homophilic
  SLAMF7 combination. The red lines represent the positive roles of SLAMF receptors
  in inhibiting cancer progression, while the purple lines indicate their negative
  roles in cancer progression. Abbreviation: MM, multiple myeloma; HCC, hepatocellular
