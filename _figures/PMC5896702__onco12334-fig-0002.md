caption: 'Biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy. Tumor cells can evade T‐cell
  attack after immunotherapy via primary or acquired mechanisms of resistance. Potential
  biomarkers of primary resistance include the following: negative PD‐L1 expression
  (A); low neoantigen or mutation load (B); MMR proficiency leading to decreased neoantigens
  (C); low levels of TILs in the tumor parenchyma (D); increased frequency of circulating
  MDSCs (E); decreased levels of IDO (F); deleterious mutations in the IFN‐γ pathway,
  including in the IFNGR (G); loss of function mutations in JAK 1/2 (H); amplification
  of MDM2 (I); and increased VEGF signaling (J). Acquired resistance biomarkers include
  the following: loss of MHC I molecules, leading to inability of T cells to recognize
  neoantigens via the TCR (K); acquired mutations in JAK 1/2 (L); loss of immunodominant
  neoantigens (M); and upregulation of suppressors such as TIM‐3 or LAG‐3 (N). Biomarkers
  can be based on decreased or loss of function (red Xs) or may be upregulated during
  resistance (red upward arrows).Abbreviations: APC, antigen‐presenting cell; CTLA‐4,
  cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated protein 4; IDO, indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase; IFN‐γ,
  interferon‐γ; IFNGR, interferon‐γ receptor; JAK 1/2, Janus kinase 1 and 2; LAG‐3,
  lymphocyte‐activation gene‐3; MDM2, murine double minute 2; MDSC, myeloid‐derived
  suppressor cell; MHC I, major histocompatibility class I; MMR, mismatch repair;
  PD‐1, 2programmed cell death protein 1; PD‐L1, programmed cell death ligand 1; STING,
  stimulator of interferon genes; TCR, T‐cell receptor; TIL, tumor‐infiltrating lymphocyte;
  TIM‐3, T‐cell immunoglobulin mucin‐3; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.'
