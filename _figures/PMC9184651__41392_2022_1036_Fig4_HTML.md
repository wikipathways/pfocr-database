caption: Key signaling pathways mediated oxidative stress. NOXs are core enzymes mediated
  oxidants production. Nox4 is upregulated in the kidney by Ang II and TGF-β pathways
  or by oxidation end products AOPP. Upregulated Nox4 induces excessive ROS accumulation
  and activates downstream pathways including ERK, mTORC, PKB, and MAPK signaling.
  Excessive ROS activates the NF-κB pathway, inducing chronic inflammation and renal
  fibrosis by upregulating the expression of CXCR4 and β-catenin. As positive feedback,
  NF-κB activation increased the expression of NOX and NOS to create more ROS. Downregulation
  of the SIRT family inhibits Nrf2, which is a positive regulator of antioxidant proteins
  and an inhibitor of NF-κB. The reduction of antioxidants increases the expression
  of ASK1 that activates the p38 and JNK. Red fonts in brackets are inhibitors. NOX
