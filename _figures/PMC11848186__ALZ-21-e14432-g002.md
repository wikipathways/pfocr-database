caption: The relationship between inflammation and AD is complex. Inflammation influences
  both the tau protein and the Aβ pathway, which are critical to the development of
  AD. In the Aβ pathway, inflammation stimulates the production of β‐secretase and
  γ‐secretase, enzymes that generate Aβ proteins. These proteins aggregate and accumulate
  in the extracellular space, leading to the formation of Aβ plaques that bind to
  neurons. Additionally, inflammation activates various kinases, such as MAPK and
  CDK5, which lead to the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, resulting in the formation
  of intracellular NFTs. The accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyper‐phosphorylated tau
  in neurons causes structural abnormalities, neuronal cell death, and, ultimately,
  the progression of AD. Key cytokines that induce both Aβ and tau pathways include
  pro‐inflammatory cytokines, such as IL‐1β and IL‐18. AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ,
