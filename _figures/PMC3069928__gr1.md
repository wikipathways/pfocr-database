caption: The biological actions of IGF-1 are mediated by IGF-1R and modulated by IGFBPs.
  Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 bind the extracellular domain of IGF-1R and
  induce the autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor domain. The
  major IGFBP circulating in the serum is IGFBP-3; it circulates as a ternary complex
  formed by the BP-3 itself, the IGFs, and an acid-labile subunit. This complex protects
  IGFs from proteolysis, prolonging their half-lives in the bloodstream. The affinity
  of the IGFBPs for IGFs is generally higher than that of IGF-IR. The free IGF/BP-bound
  IGF ratio is crucial for the determination of the effectiveness of this growth factor.
  After IGF-1R activation, the insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) (eg, IRS-1) become
  phosphorylated, determining the activation of two main cascades (Ras/Raf–mitogen-activated
  protein kinase [MAPK] and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase [PI3K]–PDK1[3′–phosphoinositide–dependent
  kinase–1]–antiapoptotic protein family/PKB [Protein Kinase B] pathways). In particular,
  one component of IGF-1 mitogenic signaling is mediated by TK through the association
  between the adapter protein Shc, growth factor receptor–binding (Grb) protein-2,
  and son of sevenless homolog (Sos)-1, which is capable of inducing both ras and
  MAPK cascades. The MAPK pathway modifies transcription activity at the nuclear level.
  Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and PI3K activation are also involved in IGF-1 signaling,
  similar to the action of insulin.
