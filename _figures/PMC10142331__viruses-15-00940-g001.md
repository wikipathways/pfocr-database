caption: 'Mechanisms by which SFTS inhibits key immune signalling pathways and promotes
  inflammation. This diagram illustrates the main mechanism by which the host cell
  pathway is impacted by the NS proteins of SFTSV. Interferon release, the primary
  signaling mechanism for immune evasion, is inhibited by NSs in a number of ways,
  including the following: (1) NSs inhibit IFN production by isolating TRIM21/25,
  TBK1, STAT1/2, and IRF3/7 into their inclusion bodies. (2) Inhibition of the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting IFN production. The toxic NS proteins of SFTS
  induce inflammation through two pathways, including the following: (1) NSs produce
  inflammatory factors by promoting the transcription of NF-kB into the nucleus. (2)
  NSs trigger BAK upregulation and BAX activation through infection, leading to mitochondrial
  DNA oxidation and subsequent cytosol release and triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation,
  which leads to inflammatory factor production.'
