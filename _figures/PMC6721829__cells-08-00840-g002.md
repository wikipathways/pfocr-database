caption: 'miRNAs in regulating cancer stem cells characteristics: miRNAs can both
  inhibit or stimulate the development and characteristic of CSCs such as the ability
  of self-renewal, sphere formation, and chemoresistance through targeting signaling
  pathways involved in their survival and proliferation. Many miRNAs were found to
  inhibit CSCs: miR-145 and miR-200c through inhibiting ADAM, miR-494 via BMI, miR-195-5p
  and miR-34 via inhibiting the Notch1 pathway, and miR-99a through inhibiting mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). Conversely, miR-519d and miR-128 inhibit CSCs via activating
  caspases. On the other hand, miRNAs can stimulate CSCs development: miR-19 and miR-501-5p
  through activating the wingless (WNT)/β-catenin signaling pathway; miR-21 and miR-221/222
  via inhibiting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN); and miR-483-5p, miR-196b-5p,
  and miR-494-3p through activating the Cyclin D1, STAT3, and Notch1 signaling pathways,
  respectively.'
