caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed molecular mechanisms underlying
  the protective effects of paeonol (PAE) in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HIR) in
  rats. (1) Under resting conditions, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1)
  forms a complex, which leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear factor
  erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). HIR triggers the increase in reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), which causes Nrf2 to dissociate from its complex and translocates
  into the nucleus, where it forms a complex with small Maf proteins (sMaf) and antioxidant
  response elements (AREs). The formed complex guides the transcription of cytoprotective
  genes, such as heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). PAE augments the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, while
  the HIR inhibits its full efficiency. (2) HIR stimulates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid
  differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) signaling pathway, which is a critical
  activator for nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). IκBα, a negative regulator of NF-κB,
  is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, allowing for its proteasomal degradation. This
  leads to freeing the NF-κB subunit and its translocation to the nucleus, where it
  hetero-dimerizes at the κB response element (κBRE). This further stimulates the
  transcription of various pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α) and regulates the pro-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)
  and the anti-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). As indicated, PAE inhibits
  TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB pathways, while HIR enhances their signaling. In addition, PAE
  inhibits the apoptotic cascade by stimulating Bcl-2, while inhibiting Bax ameliorating
  HIR-induced apoptosis. Several cross-talks between the three different molecular
  signaling pathways are illustrated.
