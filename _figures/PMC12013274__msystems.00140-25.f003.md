caption: 'The integrated metabolic network for amino acid biosynthesis of S. maydis
  holobiont. Final products (amino acids) are framed by a circle, and the unframed
  compounds represent the precursors. Amino acids and precursors are colored according
  to the compartment where they can be biosynthesized (S. maydis, B. aphidicola, or
  S. symbiotica cells). Some are hence bicolored or tricolored. Linear arrows represent
  a biosynthetic pathway, and thick empty arrows represent transport reactions. Question
  marks correspond to the hypotheses raised by the genomic inference we carried out
  for the present work. 3-M-2-OB: 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate; 3-M-2-OP: 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate;
