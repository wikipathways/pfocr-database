caption: Methionine metabolism in vivo. Methionine, released into the amino acid pool
  as a result of protein breakdown, is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the
  universal methyl donor. After loss of the methyl group in various methyltransferase
  reactions, SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which in turn is converted
  to homocysteine (Hcy) via a reversible reaction. Homocysteine can be remethylated
  either by methionine synthase (MS) or by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT) to methionine and thus complete the methionine cycle. Homocysteine may also
  be metabolized via the transsulfuration pathway to form cystathionine, cysteine,
  and other downstream products. Also shown is the fate of [1-13C]methionine and [C2H3]methionine
  tracers. As shown, the [C2H3] tracer is lost in the methyltransferase reactions,
  so that homocysteine will only be labeled with 13C, which is lost when 13CO2 is
  formed during the conversion of α-ketobutyrate to propionyl coenzyme A (CoA). During
  fasting, the rate of appearance of methionine measured by [1-13C]methionine tracer
  represents methionine entering the amino acid pool due to protein breakdown, whereas
  that measured by [C2H3]tracer includes protein breakdown plus that formed from methylation
  of homocysteine. CβS, cystathionine β synthase; CγL, cystathionine γ lyase; GSH,
  glutathione; DMG, dimethylglycine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
