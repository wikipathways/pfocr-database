caption: Summary of the prominent metabolites in HG-treated primary neurons (in the
  intracellular and extracellular compartments). The pathway referenced to the KEGG
  database and small molecule pathway database (SMPDB). The metabolites with frames
  are detectable metabolites. The dashed arrows denote significant differences of
  metabolite levels exposed to HG, compared to controls. The absorption and release
  of metabolites are labeled with arrows crossing the membrane. The positive and negative
  signs represent stimulation or inhibition, respectively after HG exposure. *p <
  0.05 compared to controls.
