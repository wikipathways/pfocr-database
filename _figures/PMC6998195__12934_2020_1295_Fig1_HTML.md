caption: Scheme of (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis based on the MVA pathway in S. cerevisiae.
  To increase the metabolic flux of the MVA pathway in S. cerevisiae, tHMG1 was overexpressed
  and the competitive ERG9 pathway was dynamically controlled by replacing its endogenous
  promoter with PHXT1. ERG20 was simultaneously fused with CnVS of C. nootkatensis
  and overexpressed to channel the metabolic flux to (+)-valencene production. The
  production of (+)-nootkatone was achieved by the overexpression of HPO, ATR1, and
  the indicated dehydrogenases
