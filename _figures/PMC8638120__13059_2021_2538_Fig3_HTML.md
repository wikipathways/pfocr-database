caption: NEASE visually highlights the impact of the AS regulation at the interactome
  level. The gray nodes represent proteins from the pathway and the red nodes represent
  genes with AS events. Red edges represent the affected interactions for the nodes
  with known DDIs, DMIs, or co-resolved structures. The visualization of the pathway
  “Synaptic vesicle cycle” from the KEGG database for the exons upregulated in the
  neural tissues shows that the splicing in the genes CLTA and CLTB is co-regulated
  and affects the interactions of the same complex. Similarly, NEASE highlights the
  importance of the domain ATP6V0A1 which is upregulated in neural tissues and binds
  seven proteins from the “Synaptic vesicle cycle” pathway
