caption: Positive and negative regulatory events in shrimp Toll pathways. Positive
  regulation of the shrimp Toll pathway can amplify signaling cascades to rapidly
  limit and clear invading pathogens. In microbial recognition, intracellular signaling
  leads to activation of Dorsal, which in turn induces the transcription of a microRNA
  gene, miR1959. MiR1959 can target the mRNA of Cactus, an inhibitor of Dorsal, resulting
  in reduced Cactus protein levels, which leads to the up-regulation of Dorsal activity
  to boost some effectors, such as AMP expression against invading microbes. On the
  other hand, the activation of the Toll pathway must be controlled and inhibited
  to ensure a properly timed and adjusted response. Along with the clearing of invading
  pathogens, the gradually increased Cactus leads to the inhibition of Dorsal activity
  by their direct interaction, which establishes a negative-feedback loop to abate
  NF-κB pathway signaling to avoid the sustained activation of this pathway. In addition,
  there multiple negative regulators have been identified—including Tollip, SARM,
  FliI, and β-Arrestin—that modulate the Toll pathway in different ways.
