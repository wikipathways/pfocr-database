caption: 'The interaction between SH2 and SH3 domains of GRB2 with upstream and downstream
  proteins in the signal pathway is illustrated as follows: (a–e) Interactions with
  upstream proteins involving the SH2 domain of GRB2; (a) The role of the GRB2 SH2
  domain in mediating EGFR activation and internalization; (b) Formation of a heterotetramer
  between two inactivated FGFR2 and the GRB2 SH2 domain in the absence of growth factors,
  with Shp2 mediating recruitment in the presence of growth factors; (c) Shc recruiting
  GRB2 through different phosphorylation sites to mediate the MAPK and c-Myc pathway;
  (d) Involvement of the GRB2 SH2 domain in receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Met and IGFR)-mediated
  pathways; (e) Participation of GRB2 in the downstream signaling of non-receptor
  tyrosine kinase integrins; (f,g) Interactions with downstream proteins involving
  the n-SH3 domain of GRB2 or c-SH3 domain of GRB2; (f) Binding of the GRB2 SH3 domain
  to downstream proteins such as SOS, Cbl, and Dynamin; (g) Interaction between GAREM
  and the GRB2 c-SH3 domain mediating MAPK signaling pathway conduction; (h) Participation
  of GRB2 in the activation of mTOR and ERK through its c-SH3 domain, along with PRR14
  and Gab2, respectively; (i) SUMOylation of GRB2 promoting the formation of more
  GRB2-SOS complexes, mediating ERK activation. Key abbreviations: EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; Shp2, Src-homology-2-domain-containing
  protein tyrosine phosphatase. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; c-Myc, Myc
  proto-oncogene protein; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; FAK, focal adhesion
  kinase; cyt-PTPe, tyrosine phosphatase epsilon; PR, proline-rich domain; GAREM,
  GRB2-associated regulator of ERK/MAPK; PRR14, proline-rich protein 14; SUMO, small
  ubiquitin-like modifier'
