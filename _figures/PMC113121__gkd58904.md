caption: Proposed mechanism of nick recognition and ligation by DNA ligases. In this
  schematic diagram we propose the following ligase reaction pathway. (1) NAD+ or
  ATP binds in the nucleotide-binding pocket, followed by closure of domain 2. (2)
  AMP is transferred to the active site lysine (bold) in a transadenylation reaction
  involving magnesium, and NMN+ or PPi is released. (3) Domain 2 opens up and the
  enzyme is ready for nick binding. (4) The adenylated enzyme binds to phosphorylated
  nicked DNA. Domain 2 closes in on the nick site. In the larger ligases, such as
  Tfi ligase, additional domains may wrap around the DNA. (5) AMP is transferred to
  the 5′-phosphate of the nick. (6) The ligase catalyses in-line attack of the 3′-OH
  on the adenylated 5′-phosphate of the nick, forming a phosphodiester bond and sealing
  the break, with the concomitant release of AMP. The enzyme opens up and falls off
  the dsDNA ready to undergo another catalytic cycle.
