caption: A possible model to explain the involvement of AATF in mTOR pathway. In response
  to cellular stress, antiapoptotic transcription factor (AATF) is activated and recruited
  onto DDIT4 and Deptor promoters, inducing their expression. This results in a simultaneous
  decrease in mTORC1 activity and increase in mTORC2 activity, allowing induction
  of autophagy and survival.
