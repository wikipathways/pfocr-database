caption: Canonical TGFβ signaling mediated by TGFβ co-receptor endoglin and soluble
  endoglin formed after proteolytic cleavage. In the case of endoglin, TGFβ dimers
  binding results in endoglin conformational changes, with sequential facilitation
  of TGFβRIs attachment, and endoglin dimer replacement with TGFβRIIs. Endoglin can
  also modulate TGFβ signaling due to its ectodomain shedding. A soluble endoglin
  effectively sequestrates TGFβ dimers, thus diminishing pathway activation.
