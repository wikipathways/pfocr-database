  Metabolic network reconstruction. Black lines indicate enzyme-encoding genes that
  were expressed and unchanged in health and disease, red lines indicate genes upregulated
  during disease, and blue lines indicate genes upregulated during health. Colored
  regions identify different sections of the metabolic pathway map. Those highlighted
  in yellow represent important pathways that were upregulated in disease. Complete
  data showing all differentially regulated genes are available in supplementary files
  2 and 3 at http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html. THF,
  tetrahydrofolate metabolism; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
