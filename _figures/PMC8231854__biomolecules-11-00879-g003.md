caption: A working model for the control of MMP-9 gene expression in cancer cells
  via galectin-7. De novo expression of galectin-7 in cancer cells by the GOF pathway
  leads to accumulation of intracellular galectin-7 (1). Intracellular galectin-7
  translocates directly to the nucleus to trigger MMP-9 gene expression (5) or be
  released by cancer cells in the extracellular tumor microenvironment (2). Once outside
  cancer cells, extracellular galectin-7 can bind and activate glycoreceptor-mediated
  signaling pathways that lead to MMP-9 gene expression (3). Such a mechanism can
  be activated in adjacent cancer cells or in the same cell following an autocrine
  mechanism (4).
