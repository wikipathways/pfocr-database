caption: The model depicting the relationship between CIBZ, RB1CC1 and autophagy.
  RB1CC1, the key mediator of mTORC1 signaling to autophagy, regulates early initial
  stages of autophagosome formation in response to starvation or mTORC1 inhibition,
  and forms a multiprotein complex by interacting with ATG13, ULK1 and ATG101. While
  knockdown of ZBTB38 decrease the RB1CC1 level, inhibit initiation of the mTORC1
  autophagy cascade, the autophagy pathway was blocked, and finally induces the death
  of neural cells.
