caption: NAD+ biosynthesis pathways. Human dependency on vitamin B3, for NAD+synthesis,
  is based on high activity of alpha-amino-beta-carboxy-muconatesemialdehyde decarboxylase
  (ACMSD), which diverts alpha-amino-beta-carboxy-muconatesemialdehyde (ACMS) away
  from NAD+synthesis. Nicotinamide (NAM) is the main precursor for NAD+synthesis and
  the byproduct of NAD+-consuming enzymes. Under physiological conditions, de novo
  synthesis of NAD+ from tryptophan, in the kynurenine pathway, takes place mainly
  in the liver. The main dietary precursors for NAD+synthesis are nicotinic acid (NA),
  nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide (NAM), collectively termed vitamin B3
  or niacin. Endogenously, NAM is generated as a byproduct of NAD+-consuming reactions.
  Under physiological conditions, most of the NAM generated in NAD+-consuming reactions
  is recycled to NAD+. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a safeguard, which
  in conditions of either overwhelming NAM generation in NAD+-consuming reactions,
  or dietary surplus, methylates NAM to prevent NAM’s inhibitory effect on PARPs and
  SIRTs.
