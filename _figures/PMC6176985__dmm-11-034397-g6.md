caption: Hypothetical model of sEng action on the vasculature. (A,B) In normal endothelial
  cells, membrane endoglin is a component of a receptor complex that contains type
  I (RI; ALK1), and type II (RII; BMPR2/ActRII) TGF-β receptors, which can be activated
  by BMP9, leading to an equilibrium between pro- and antiangiogenic factors (A).
  In endoglin-silenced endothelial cells (Eng-iKOe), BMP9 cannot bind to endoglin
  and BMP9-dependent signaling is disturbed, leading to a dysregulated expression
  of angiogenic factors, decreased migration during angiogenesis and the presence
  of AVMs (B). (C,D) In normal endothelial cells, the circulating extracellular region
  of endoglin (sEng) can interact with BMP9, sequestering the ligand, interfering
  with the intracellular signaling of the receptor complex and changing the angiogenesis
  balance towards a dysregulated state (C). In Eng-iKOe, BMP9 cannot bind to membrane
  endoglin, but interacts with sEng, and the resulting BMP9/sEng complex interacts
  with the ALK1 receptor on the cell membrane, enhancing the proangiogenic ALK1 signaling
  and decreasing the incidence of AVMs (D). The involvement of endoglin in the TGF-β1/ALK5
  signaling pathway of endothelial cells has been omitted for simplification.
