caption: Somatic alterations in the PI3K pathway in prostate cancer. Selected genes
  in the PI3K pathway are depicted, alongside the mechanisms by which they are altered
  in prostate cancer. Putative proto-oncogenes are boxed in red and tumor-suppressor
  genes in blue. PI3K signaling is frequently activated by deletion of PTEN. PHLPP1
  encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates activated Akt, and is frequently co-deleted
  with PTEN in metastatic tumors (). Genomic rearrangements disrupt MAGI2, which encodes
  a scaffolding protein that stabilizes PTEN (; ). Recurrent deletions inactivate
  the FOXO1A gene, which encodes a transcription factor substrate of Akt that mediates
  PI3K signaling. Although rare, oncogenic mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase
  EGFR or AKT1 may activate the pathway upstream or downstream of PI3K (; ). The expression
  of most pathway members is dysregulated at the transcript level as well.
