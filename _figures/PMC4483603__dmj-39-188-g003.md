caption: . Aerobic glycolysis and oxidative glycolysis. The glycolysis converts glucose
  to pyruvate via same metabolic pathway. In aerobic glycolysis (blue arrow), lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH) shifts the pyruvate to lactate because the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDC) is inactivated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs). In oxidative
  glycolysis (green arrow), PDC converts the pyruvate to β-oxidation increases acetyl-CoA
  (Ac-CoA), which is further oxidized via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. HK, hexokinase;
  Hif-1α, hypoxia inducible factor 1α; PFK1, phosphofructokinase 1; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; ETS, electron transport system; G-3-Pi, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced;
  FADH, flavin adenine dinucleotide reduced.
