caption: Okadaic acid (OA), microcystin and nodularin are involved in oxidative stress
  and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in several toxicities
  to organisms. The toxins induce oxidative stress, damage macromolecules such as
  proteins, lipids, and DNA, and inhibit protein folding activity. It also decreases
  the activity of DNA repair enzymes that influence cell cycle proliferation and trigger
  carcinogenesis. OA and nodularin weaken the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant
  enzymes, triggering apoptosis and excessive ROS production. ROS generation has also
  been examined in the context of the JNK pathway leading to apoptosis via activating
  downstream transcription factors AP-1 and Bid. ROS causes mitochondrial dysfunction,
  induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pathway, a Ca2+ dependent
  pathway, and triggers apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits oxidative phosphorylation
  and ATP synthesis, which finally causes apoptosis. Eventually, ROS enters other
  pathways and triggers apoptosis.
