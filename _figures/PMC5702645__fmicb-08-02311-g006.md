caption: Model of HClO-induced biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Sublethal
  concentrations of HClO-releasing agents NaClO and Ca(ClO)2 are able to induce expression
  of P. aeruginosa PA3177 via a yet unknown regulatory pathway. PA3177acts as a DGC
  and catalyzes the formation of the second messenger c-di-GMP. These high intracellular
  c-di-GMP concentrations promote the switch from a free-living motile to a surface-associated
  sessile lifestyle and contribute to the development of persistent P. aeruginosa
  infections. Mutant analyses revealed an important role for the Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides
  as effectors in the PA3177-dependent pathway.
