caption: . Schematic representation showing some interactions between the plant hormones
  abscisic acid (A), auxin (B), brassinosteroids (C) and ethylene (D) under heavy
  metal exposure. (A) Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn treatments increase endogenous levels
  of ABA. Under As stress, NCED2 and NCED3 (ABA biosynthesis genes) are up-regulated.
  Vanadium (V) is also shown to trigger the expression of genes associated with ABA
  signaling and biosynthesis. The genes PYL, PP2C and SnRK2 that are putatively involved
  in ABA signal transduction were identified under Cu and Zn exposure. (B) Under B
  starvation PIN1 changes auxin distribution and possibly inhibits root elongation.
  Cd induces NO accumulation, which represses auxin transport and reduces root meristem
  size. NO is also involved in the auxin signaling pathway in response to Cu exposure.
  Under Cd stress, an auxin conjugate (IAA-Asp) modulates catalase and peroxidase
  activity and decreases hydrogen peroxide concentration. In the same condition, auxin
  (NAA) increases hemicellulose 1 content and more Cd is fixed in the roots. (C) BRs
  induce SOD, CAT and POD activities, protecting plants against heavy metal toxicity.
  (D) ACS and ACO expression leads to higher production of ethylene. ACS2 and ACS6
  are regulated by MPK3/MPK6 at transcriptional and translational levels. MPK3 and
  MPK6 phosphorylate the transcription factor WRKY33, which in turn regulates ACS2
  and ACS6 gene expression. The WRKY33 protein also binds directly to ACS2 and ACS6
  promoters. EIN2 is an important component of the ethylene signaling pathway and
  acts as a transducer of stress response. Lead treatment increased the transcript
  levels of EIN2 in Arabidopsis seedlings under heavy metal exposure. It has been
  suggested that EIN2 regulates AtPDR12, an ABC membrane-transporter that excludes
  Pb and Pb-containing toxic compounds from the cytoplasm. Dashed black line indicates
  possible regulation. Arrows and T-bars represent positive and negative regulation,
  respectively. Green arrows indicate increased levels. As, arsenic; B, boron; Cd,
