caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between the IGF1 signaling axis
  and p53 genome protection pathway. p53 is activated in response to a broad spectrum
  of cellular insults and, in its hyperphosphorylated state, it can lead to cell cycle
  arrest and/or apoptosis. p53 was shown to inhibit transcription of the antiapoptotic
  genes IGF2 and IGF1R. On the other hand, p53 enhanced expression of the proapoptotic
  gene IGFBP3. Thus, p53 is capable of regulating the activity of the entire IGF signaling
  axis by controlling expression and activity of ligands, receptors, and IGFBPs in
  a coordinated fashion. The abundance and activity of p53 itself was shown to be
  regulated by IGF1, which induced p53 degradation in an Mdm2-dependent fashion.
