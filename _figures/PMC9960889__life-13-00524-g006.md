caption: A working model showing putative signal transduction mediated by the HOS1
  protein under cold exposure and strong lighting. It can be supposed (?) that when
  exposed to cold and strong light, HOS1 stabilizes the content of ROS by blocking
  its generation through NADPH oxidases (RbohD/F). As a result, there is no increased
  generation of ROS and no activation of ROS-regulated expression of ascorbate peroxidases
  Apx1 and Apx2. Inactivation of HOS1 removes (X) this regulatory block. The expression
  of RbohD/F activates the pathway of ROS-regulated expression of Apx1 and Apx2, which
  leads to a decrease in the content of ROS by active ROS decomposition.
