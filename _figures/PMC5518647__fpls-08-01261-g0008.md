caption: A summarized overview of the branch points between primary berry metabolism
  toward the phenylpropanoid pathway overlaying transcriptomic and metabolomic data
  generated from exposed and control grapes harvested at each phenological stage.
  Blocks indicate the mean-centered log2 fold change of the FPKM expression value
  of the specific transcripts and metabolites involved in the particular enzymatic
  step at each berry developmental stage when comparing exposed to control samples.
  Significant differential expression (q ≤ 0.05) of genes and compounds are indicated
  by a bold contour (frame). Total concentrations (μg/g FW) of phenolic acids, flavonols
  and flavan-3-ols are represented by ANOVA line-plots where significant differences
  (q ≤ 0.05) between exposed and control samples are indicated by an asterisks (*).
  Line graphs representing exposed and control samples are staggered along the x-axis
  representing the respective developmental stages. Gray circles represented compounds
  that were not measured, whereas black circles represent various possible compounds
  at the same enzymatic step. Striped gray arrows represent regulatory steps by associated
  transcription factors. The genes represented by numbers are listed in Table .
