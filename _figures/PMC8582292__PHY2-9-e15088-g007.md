caption: 'Schematic drawings of the background neural mini‐network underlying the
  higher‐level effects of MDMA. The inset shows the membrane‐ and system‐level effects
  of MDMA on local DA and ACh release. By modifying the VTA pathway, MDMA can influence
  DA release in the NAc in vivo. There are direct effects of MDMA on striatal and
  accumbal DA release that can be separately studied in slice preparations. The reverse
  function of DAT activity induced by the inward transport of MDMA (substrate of DAT)
  from the extracellular environment induces the release of DA from the cytoplasm.
  GBR‐12909, which is a selective inhibitor of DAT, and hypothermia (17°C) prevents
  MDMA from inducing the nonquantal release of DA. It should be noted that the forward
  and reverse transport mechanisms are mediated by the same transporter. The extracellular
  DA, elevated by MDMA, contributes to a specific behavioral effect of MDMA, the passive
  social behavior. The indirect effect of MDMA on ACh release in the striatum is shown.
