caption: Schematic hypothetical model of HopA1 virulence, elicitation of ETIHopA1pss
  and potentiation on PTI. PAMP perceptions by PRRs elicit PTI utilizing the MAPK
  (MPK3/4/6) networks to perturb AS-NMD pathway through the degradation of UPF proteins,
  phosphorylation of splicing and other associated factors. Upregulated splice variants
  of TNLs (RPS6, SNC1) and other defense-associated transcripts contribute to PTI
  signaling. Defensive overshoots are prevented by the macromolecular ‘resistasome
  complex (triangle) functions comprising of SRFR1, EDS1 and TNLs (RPS6). Protein-protein
  interactions with SRFR1 modulate uncontrolled activation of RPS6. In susceptible
  plants, HopA1s suppress PTI via post-transcriptional and translational inhibitions
  of immune-related transcripts (such as FRK1, WRKY22, WRKY29, WAK2, FOX) including
  TNLs. In resistant plant, resistasome sense HopA1pss activities to cause activation
  of RPS6 (RPS6*) through unknown mechanisms. The elicited ETIHopA1pss amplify PTI
  through MAPK3/6 signaling and other unidentified routes.
