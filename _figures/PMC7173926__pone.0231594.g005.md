caption: Typical EC related tumorigenesis- and metastasis-associated PAN-ECM genes
  were identified. Most of them were collage-related genes and were downregulated
  in tumorigenesis and upregulated in metastasis of EC. The PAN-ECM genes in volved
  in GP6 signaling pathway with opposite expression in tumorigenesis and metastasis
  of EC were colored. Green colour genes indicates an inhibition z-score of -1.414.
  Red colour genes indicates an activation z-score of 4.146; The color is more intensive,
  the absolute z-score is higher.
