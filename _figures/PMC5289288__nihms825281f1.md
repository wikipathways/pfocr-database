caption: (A) Mice were randomly divided to control (C) and tibia fracture/cast (F)
  groups. 3 weeks after fracture, ipsilateral hindpaw skin protein was extracted and
  separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. (B) When probed with fracture and
  control mouse sera and CRPS and control human sera, total protein extracts harvested
  from 3w fracture mice were shown to bind differentially to mouse fracture serum
  and sera collected from CRPS patients (yellow ellipses). These same spots were excised
  from 2-d gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (red ellipses) and processed
  for LC-MS. (C) Proteins that were shown (by LC-MS) to be increased in the fracture
  group were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and plotted based on known involvement
  in autoimmune conditions. Darker colors indicate increased evidence for involvement.
  Asterisks indicate some of the targets that were chosen for further analysis.
