caption: Putative NFκB signaling pathway data mined from Euprymna scolopes reference
  transcriptome and genome. Genes in dark blue have been found previously in E. scolopes,
  whereas genes in light blue are being reported here for the first time. Gene with
  a dotted line was not found in the E. scolopes genome or transcriptome. Elements
  of the pathway found in E. scolopes included pattern recognition receptors (PRRs,
  oval), effector enzymes (triangle), and signaling cascade genes (rectangular). PGRP

  receptors SOD superoxide dismutase, HSPs heat shock proteins, MYD88 Myeloid differentiation
