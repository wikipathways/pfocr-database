caption: Schematic of classical and non-classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.
  Top panel Classical neurotransmitters are typically synthesized in the presynaptic
  cell and packaged into synaptic vesicles. Upon stimulation, vesicles fuse with the
  membrane and release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft where the neurotransmitters
  can bind to postsynaptic receptors to elicit their effects. Neurotransmitters in
  the synaptic cleft are removed by reuptake or are degraded. Classical neuropeptides
  are derived from precursors synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  Proteolytic processing begins in the trans-Golgi network or immature secretory vesicles
  and continues in the maturing vesicles. Classical neuropeptides are packaged into
  dense core vesicles, which can also contain classical neurotransmitters. Upon stimulation,
  vesicles fuse with the membrane to release their contents. Classical neuropeptides
  typically elicit their effects on G-protein coupled receptors and are eliminated
  by extracellular peptidases. Bottom panel Non-classical neurotransmitters and the
  proposed pathway of non-classical neuropeptides. Non-classical neurotransmitters
  are synthesized from their precursors upon stimulation of the signaling cell and
  are not stored in vesicles. Examples such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  are derived from lipid precursors while nitric oxide is produced from arginine.
  Once produced, non-classical neurotransmitters are rapidly secreted and act upon
  receptors or other targets which can be membrane-bound or intracellular. Non-classical
  signaling can proceed in a retrograde manner as it does not require synaptic transmission.
  In our proposed model, non-classical neuropeptides are derived from intracellular
  proteins by the action of proteases. The peptides are then secreted by an unknown
  mechanism, and elicit their effects on receptors or other targets. Although some
  of these targets may be distinct from the targets of classical neurotransmitters,
  some may also be common. For example, the hemopressins, a family of putative non-classical
  neuropeptides, bind to CB1 receptors which are also the target of the non-classical
  neurotransmitters anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol
