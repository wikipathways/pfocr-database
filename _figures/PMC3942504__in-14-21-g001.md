caption: Molecular mechanisms of Bcl-6 expression in T cells. Bcl-6, the master regulator
  of TFH cell differentiation is controlled by a complex signaling pathway. Co-stimulatory
  molecules such as CD28 and ICOS activate PI3K to induce Bcl-6 expression. PTEN,
  PHLPP2 inhibit Bcl-6 expression through interfering PI3K signaling and Foxo1 directly
  inhibits Bcl-6 expression. Various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-21, IL-12, and IFN-γ
  induce Bcl-6 expression through JAK-STAT signaling pathway while high level of IL-2
  in combination with IL-12 induces T-bet to inhibit Bcl-6. Blimp-1 and Bcl-6 is reciprocally
  regulating each other to make a decision of effector T cell fate between TFH and
  non-TFH effector cells. Some miRNA such as miR-17-92 induces Bcl-6 expression by
  interfering phosphatases, which inhibit PI3K signaling pathway while miR-10a directly
  inhibits Bcl-6 expression.
