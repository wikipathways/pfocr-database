caption: 'Proposed Multicompartmental Degradative Pathway of L-lysineL-Lysine degradation
  is initiated by either peroxisomal α-deamination (pipecolate pathway) or mitochondrial
  ε-deamination (saccharopine pathway). Both pathways converge in 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde,
  which is subsequently metabolized to 2-aminoadipate and 2-oxoadipate. Our data strongly
  indicate that DHTKD1 is part of a 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase-complex (OGDHc)-like
  enzyme and is involved in the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA. A
  minor route for this reaction via the tricarboxylic-acid (TCA)-cycle enzyme OGDHc
  might exist but does not compensate for the lack of DHTKD1. Succinyl-CoA and glutaryl-CoA
  are known to inhibit OGDHc (not shown). DTHKD1 might be an interesting drug target
  for glutaric aciduria type I, which is caused by inherited deficiency of glutaryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase (GCDH). MIM numbers of inherited diseases of the lysine degradative
  pathway are provided (e.g., MIM 245130 for 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria).
  Dotted lines indicate multiple enzymatic steps. The following abbreviations are
  used: AADAT, 2-aminoadipate transaminase; AASDH, 2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase;
  AASS, 2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde synthetase; DHTKD1, proposed E1 subunit of an
  OGDHc-like complex; and PIPOX, pipecolate oxidase. Mitochondrial transporters are
  not shown in this figure.'
