caption: A working model for the signaling pathway controlling the formation of SGs
  in yeast under 2-DG treatment. A working model demonstrating the SG formation signaling
  pathway identified in this work. TORC1/2 was determined to be involved in an early
  step in this pathway. The signal was further transduced through its downstream effectors
  Sch9 and Ypk1 to influence the level of LCBs. Downstream of the LCBs, Ubi4 and Ubp3
  together modulate Lsm7 phase separation and thereby regulate SG formation
