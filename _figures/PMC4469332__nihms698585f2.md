caption: Intracellular levels of BH4 depend on three production conduits the de novo
  synthesis pathway, the recycling pathway and the salvage pathway. BH4 biosynthesis
  is mediated through the de novo pathway which can be modulated by numerous inflammatory
  signals, notably through direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme GCH1. The
  recycling pathway allows the recreation of BH4 from the BH2 dispensed by the hydroxylases
  and is essential to maintain the proper ratio of BH4/BH2 levels. Precise physiological
  roles for the salvage pathway are not fully characterized, but it acts to keep BH4
  levels stable in a similar way to the recycling pathway. Known mutations for key
  enzymes of the metabolism of BH4 are indicated by an asterisk.
