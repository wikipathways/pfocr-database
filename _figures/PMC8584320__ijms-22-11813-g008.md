caption: 'Location of substances detected in this study in the metabolic pathway.
  Substances were detected by comparison with metabolites registered in the HMT metabolite
  library. Graph shows the relative area values in mock-inoculated control (blue),
  plants inoculated with strain 4 (red), plants inoculated with strain 2 (green),
  mock-inoculated control plants under saline conditions (orange), plants inoculated
  with strain 4 under saline conditions (dark blue), and plants inoculated with strain
  2 under saline conditions (purple). N.D: not detected.'
