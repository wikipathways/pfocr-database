caption: 'Network of ABA-induced stomatal closure. (Figure and figure legend are reproduced
  from .) The color of each node represents its function: enzymes are shown in red,
  signal transduction proteins are green, membrane transport-related nodes are blue,
  and secondary messengers and small molecules are shown in orange. The full names
  of network components corresponding to each abbreviated node label are indicated
  below. Small black circles represent putative intermediary nodes mediating indirect
  regulatory interactions. Arrowheads represent activation, and short perpendicular
  bars indicate inhibition. Light blue lines denote interactions derived from species
  other than Arabidopsis, and dashed light blue lines denote inferred negative feedback
  loops on pH and S1P. Nodes involved in the same metabolic pathway or protein complex
