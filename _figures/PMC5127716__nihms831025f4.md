caption: 'Schematic of immune signaling cascades triggered by Cryptococcus neoformans
  recognition. (a) Dectin-1 signaling pathway. Dectin-1 can induce both Syk-dependent
  and Raf (Syk-independent) pathways. Dectin-1 can activate macrophages through the
  Syk pathway, triggering phagocytosis; following phagocytosis, Dectin-1 activation,
  coupled to ROS production, contributes to inflammasome activation or fungal killing
  and activates the transcription factor NF-κB through CARD9, triggering inflammatory
  cytokine production. The Raf-1 (Syk-independent) pathway enhances NF-κB and inflammatory
  cytokines. (b) Inflammasome pathway. The Syk-dependent pathway requires combination
  of two signals. The first signal, which can be mediated by TLR activation, together
  with a second signal, such as ROS production and/or lysosomal damage, induces the
  oligomerization of the NLRP3 complex, activation of caspase 1, and production of
  IL-1β. Abbreviations: ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a
  C-terminal CARD; Bcl10, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 10; CARD9, caspase recruitment
  domain–containing protein 9; CLR, C-type lectin receptor; IL, interleukin; MALT-1,
  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer
  of activated B cells; NLRP3, Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain–containing 3;
  PLCγ2, phospholipase Cγ2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Syk, spleen tyrosine kinase;
  TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α'
