caption: The spindle assembly checkpoint and error correction. (A) The SAC pathway
  originates at kinetochores and converges, through several steps, on the assembly
  of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which acts as the SAC effector. MCC has
  been proposed to target the complex of APC/C pre-bound to a second molecule of Cdc20
  (which can act both as an APC/C co-activator and as an MCC subunit) (, ). APC/CCdc20
  promotes poly-ubiquitylation (Ub) of Cyclin B and Securin, promoting mitotic exit
  and separation of sister chromatids. MCC inhibits this activity of APC/CCdc20 until
  all chromosomes have achieved bi-orientation, at which point the SAC becomes “satisfied”
  (it subsides). (B) In this model of Aurora B function, any kinetochore–microtubule
  interaction, even if erroneous, satisfies the SAC. Aurora B is not a SAC component,
  but its ability to recognize and correct improper attachment makes it activate the
  SAC indirectly through generation of unattached kinetochores (as an intermediate
  in error correction), which are considered the only source of SAC signal. (C) In
  this alternative model, any tensionless kinetochore is a source of SAC signal, albeit
  of different signal strengths (size of the red flashes). Aurora B is directly required
  both for error correction and for the SAC. (B,C) were adapted from Ref. ().
