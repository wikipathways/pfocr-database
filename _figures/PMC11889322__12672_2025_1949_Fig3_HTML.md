caption: The diagram depicts the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway,
  starting with the cytoplasmic retention of inactive AhR in a complex with heat shock
  protein 90 (HSP90), X-associated protein 2 (XAP2), and p23. Upon ligand binding,
  whether exogenous or endogenous, AhR is activated, dissociates from the complex,
  and translocates to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, AhR associates with AhR nuclear
  translocator (ARNT) to form a heterodimer that binds to xenobiotic response elements
  (XREs) for the regulation of target gene transcription. Feedback mechanisms, such
  as AhR repressor (AhRR) -mediated inhibition and ligand metabolism via cytochrome
  P450 (CYP) enzymes, regulate the pathway. The diagram also shows how AhR interacts
  with pathways such as Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and hypoxia-inducible factor
  1-alpha (HIF-1α), showing its part in cancer progression, immune system regulation,
  and detoxification
