caption: NFκB-BRD4 signaling in innate inflammation and remodeling. Schematic model
  of mucosal epithelial cell in the bronchiolar epithelium. TLR liberates NFκB from
  sequestered cytoplasmic stores, in cooperation with oxidative stress generated by
  activated TLR RelA is phosphorylated on Ser residue 276, a post-translational modification
  required for binding to BRD4. Transient, short term activation of NFκB results in
  highly inducible gene expression of innate response genes. By contrast, persistent
  activation of NFkB signaling results in activation of mesenchymal core regulatory
  proteins and the fibrotic pathway. NFκB•BRD4 complex links innate inflammation with
  epigenetic programming and airway remodeling.
