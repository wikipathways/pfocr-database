caption: Overview of the transport, central metabolism, and energy production in P.
  torridus. Sugar, peptide, and amino acid uptake systems are shown in red, drug exporters
  are shown in pink, trace elements transport systems are shown in green, other and
  hypothetical transporters are shown in gray. Bold numbers mark the number of each
  transporter. Protein translocation systems are shown in violet, and the components
  of the respiratory chain are shown in yellow. A total of 93 secondary and 17 primary
  transporters were found in the genome sequence, resulting in an unusual ratio of
  5.6:1. So far, no aldolase gene is found. Enzyme activity essays indicate a functional
  nonphosphorylated Entner Doudoroff pathway for glucolysis (unpublished data). Pathways
  for the respiration of the organic acids acetate, lactate, and propanoate were identified.
  NADH2 and reduced ferredoxin is produced in the P. torridus central carbon metabolism
  but the final reducing compound of the NADH-oxidoreductase is still unknown as no
  electron-input module for it was detected.
