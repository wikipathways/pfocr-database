caption: The developmental processes that are controlled by auxin and its potential
  impacts on seed size and weight. Active auxin, influenced by auxin biosynthesis,
  oxidation, conjugation, and transport, initiates auxin signaling pathway, in turn,
  which also have a potential feedback loop for maintaining the fine cellular auxin
  concentration. In both monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants, auxin has been found
  to be involved in regulating the development of embryo, endosperm and seed coat,
  which have the potential role in determining the seed size and seed weight of plants.
  Recent studies have confirmed that silique development also has the impact on seed
  development.
