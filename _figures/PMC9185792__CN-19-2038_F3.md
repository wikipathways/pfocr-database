caption: Mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induced by Synthetic Cannabinoids and Synthetic
  Cathinones. Through the activation of CB1 and MA T/R receptors of the brain, these
  molecules determine an intense noradrenergic stimulation. The direct action of synthetic
  cannabinoids on the heart is realized through the activation of the CB1 and CB2
  receptors with both cardiotoxic and cardioprotective effects, while it is not clear
  which signaling pathway is triggered by synthetic cathinones. (Illustrated by Tina
  Šinigoj ©, 2020). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available
