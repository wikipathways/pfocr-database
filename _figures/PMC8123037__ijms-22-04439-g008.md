caption: A proposed mechanistic model for the protective effects of metformin in the
  injured retina. In NMDA-induced neuronal cell death, an increase in the intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration is the key initial step; however, inflammatory responses are
  also involved. Metformin suppresses the inflammatory responses associated with neuronal
  cell damage. In addition, metformin may strengthen the endogenous neuroprotective
  system involving the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
