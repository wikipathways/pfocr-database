caption: The emergence of wings may have triggered the innovation of the last moult
  and the origin of (hemimetabolan) metamorphosis. One of the first innovations could
  have been the upregulation of E93 expression in mature nymphs. This could have contributed
  to wing maturation, prothoracic gland degeneration and adult commitment of epidermis.
  Another necessary requirement would be for JH to play an inhibitory role in metamorphosis,
  repressing E93, possibly through Kr-h1, as in extant insects. Refinements of this
  incipient MEKRE93 pathway would have adjusted the regulation of the genes involved,
  mainly Kr-h1 and E93, in different tissues and at the appropriate times. Differential
  solutions for ‘condensing’ juvenile and/or subadult stages in different lineages
  would have produced the life cycle diversity that we observe today in hemimetabolan
  species. The same Kr-h1–E93 axis could have regulated the tendency to attenuate
  the development of the wing pads in nymphal instars. (Online version in colour.)
