caption: The scheme shows the involvement of HDAC6 in two different functions of dendritic
  cell during Lm infection, the autophagy and the TLR signalling. (1) The fusion of
  phagosome with lysosome is dependent on cortactin and F-actin. The deacetylation
  of cortactin by HDAC6 allows the correct fusion, followed by an autophagic clearance
  of Lm. The absence of this enzyme delays the fusion of phagosome and lysosome, facilitating
  Lm to escape from phagosome leading to an increased bacterial load. (2) Di- and
  tri-acyl lipopeptides and peptidoglycan (PGN) of Lm are recognized by TLR1/2 or
  TLR2/6, activating the TLR pathway. HDAC6 is able to interact with the TLR-adaptor
  protein MyD88 which caused an enhanced down-stream signalling of TLR pathway, increasing
  NF-κB and MAPK activation. This stronger activation (independent on HDAC6 enzymatic
  activity) results in higher pro-inflammatory cytokine production and iNOS induction,
  reinforcing the ability of the DC to combat against this intracellular pathogen.
  Although the absence of HDAC6 does not fully abolish the activation of the DC, a
  lower induction of NF-κB and MAPK pathways promotes a lower activation of the anti-bacterial
  transcriptional program of the DCs. Note that both processes occur during Lm infection
  and the pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS induction can impact on the autophagic
  process. The images in the figure are not scaled.
