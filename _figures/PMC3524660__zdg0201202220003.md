caption: Synthetic pathway for norepinephrine (NE) and a cartoon of a sympathetic
  nerve ending. NE is stored in vesicles and released into neurovascular synapses
  in response to MSNA bursting. Postsynaptic binding results in vasoconstriction,
  which can be assessed by measuring local blood flow with Doppler ultrasound and
  other methods. Some of the released NE spills over into the plasma. However, the
  NE transporter (NET) takes up and conserves the large majority of released NE. A
  specific vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) is responsible for translocating
  NE from the cytoplasm into the vesicles. A recent technique of venous biopsy has
  been successfully used to detect changes in synthetic proteins (). [Modified with
