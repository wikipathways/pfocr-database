caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of astaxanthin. The biosynthetic pathway was grouped
  into four major modules: the upstream MVA pathway (module 1 or AHT, including atoB,
  hmgS, and thmgR), the downstream MVA pathway (module 2 or MPPI, including mevk,
  pmk, pmd, and idi), the lycopene pathway (module 3 or EBIA, including crtEBI and
  ispA) and the astaxanthin pathway (module 4 or YZW, including crtYZW). Abbreviation
  for the compounds: HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A; MVA, mevalonate;
  MVAP, phosphomevalonate; MVAPP, diphosphomevalonate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate;
  GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Dashed arrow indicates multiple enzymatic steps.
  The genes expressed encode the following enzymes: atoB, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase;
  hmgS, HMG-CoA synthase; thmgR, truncated HMG-CoA reductase; mevk, mevalonate kinase;
  pmk, phosphomevalonate kinase; pmd, mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; idi,
  IPP isomerase; ispA, FPP synthase; crtE, GGPP synthase; crtB, phytoene synthase;
  crtI, phytoene desaturase; crtY, lycopene cyclase; crtW, β-carotene ketolase; crtZ,
  β-carotene hydroxylase'
