caption: Illustrative diagram for exosome-mediated transfer of therapeutic resistance
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Drug-resistant (donor) cells may communicate
  with drug-sensitive (recipient) cells by the intercellular transfer of various types
  of EVs, such as exosomes (usually expressing tetraspanins such as CD9/63/81, TSG101
  and syntenin-1), which are of endocytic origin []. Upon fusion of secretory multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane, exosomes are released into the extracellular
  space. The initial steps of this process are usually modulated by the endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) []. The mechanisms involved in the
  release of exosomes are also regulated by other protein families, such as Rab GTPases
  and SNARES [, ]. Once EVs reach the recipient cells, they may fuse with their plasma
  membrane or be internalized by the endocytic pathway. Exosomes may transfer miRNAs,
  lncRNAs, proteins (such as drug-efflux pumps), and other key players responsible
  for drug resistance, which allows de novo development or horizontal dissemination
  of cancer resistance traits to the recipient cell populations. For example, mesenchymal
  stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes trigger the activation of calcium-dependent protein
  kinases and EGFR/Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk kinase cascade in gastric cancer cells, while polarized
  macrophages promote cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells by exosomal transfer
  of miR-21 which functionally activates PI3K/AKT signaling via down-regulation of
  PTEN in recipient cells [, ]
