caption: Proposed model of SDF-1-induced apoptosis. SDF-1-induced CXCR4 activation
  induces Noxa stabilization, Bak up-regulation, and Bcl-XL down-regulation. Collectively,
  these lead to Bax/Bak activation followed by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.
  Consistent with this model, increased expression of Noxa or Bak is shown to induce
  apoptosis in these cells, and Bcl-XL expression, Bak shRNA, or Noxa siRNA is shown
  to inhibit SDF-1-induced apoptosis. Likewise, AMD3100 and DN-Casp-9 inhibit apoptosis,
  providing further support for the involvement of CXCR4 and the caspase 9-mediated
  intrinsic pathway in this process.
