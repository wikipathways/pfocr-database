caption: Scheme of the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
  (CIPN) in mice treated with paclitaxel (A) or oxaliplatin (B). (A) Paclitaxel causes
  macrophage (Mφ) accumulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sciatic nerves
  (primary sensory neurons) and upregulates histone acetyltransferases (HATs) via
  the ROS/p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, resulting in acetylation and cytoplasmic translocation
  of nuclear HMGB1 followed by its secretion. Unknown humoral factors released from
  neurons in response to paclitaxel promote the HMGB1 release from Mφ. The secreted
  HMGB1 causes neuronal excitation through activation of RAGE, TLR4, and the CXCL12/CXCR4
  axis, leading to CIPN characterized by pain or numbness. TMα prevents CIPN following
  paclitaxel treatment by degrading extracellular HMGB1 in a thrombin (TB)-dependent
  manner. (B) Oxaliplatin induces HMGB1 release possibly from multiple cells including
  Schwann cells, leading to CIPN through neuronal sensitization via activation of
  RAGE, TLR4, and CXCL12/CXCR4 pathways. Exogenously applied TMα and endothelial TM
  accelerate thrombin-induced degradation of HMGB1, thereby reducing the CIPN induced
  by oxaliplatin. Anticoagulants such as dabigatran, argatroban, warfarin, and rivaroxaban
  reduce the thrombin-dependent degradation of HMGB1 by TM and TMα, thereby aggravating
  CIPN and cancelling the anti-CIPN effect of TMα.

  description: Scheme of the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced peripheral
    neuropathy (CIPN) in mice treated with paclitaxel (A) or oxaliplatin (B). (A)
    Paclitaxel causes macrophage (Mφ) accumulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
    and sciatic nerves (primary sensory neurons) and upregulates histone acetyltransferases
    (HATs) via the ROS/p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, resulting in acetylation and cytoplasmic
    translocation of nuclear HMGB1 followed by its secretion. Unknown humoral factors
    released from neurons in response to paclitaxel promote the HMGB1 release from
    Mφ. The secreted HMGB1 causes neuronal excitation through activation of RAGE,
    TLR4, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, leading to CIPN characterized by pain or numbness.
    TMα prevents CIPN following paclitaxel treatment by degrading extracellular HMGB1
    in a thrombin (TB)-dependent manner. (B) Oxaliplatin induces HMGB1 release possibly
    from multiple cells including Schwann cells, leading to CIPN through neuronal
    sensitization via activation of RAGE, TLR4, and CXCL12/CXCR4 pathways. Exogenously
    applied TMα and endothelial TM accelerate thrombin-induced degradation of HMGB1,

    argatroban, warfarin, and rivaroxaban reduce the thrombin-dependent degradation
    of HMGB1 by TM and TMα, thereby aggravating CIPN and cancelling the anti-CIPN
    effect of TMα.
