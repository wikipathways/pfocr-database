caption: Schematic model depicting potential mechanism that might contribute to epithelial-specific
  regulation of the CFTR gene. In this model, arrows and bubbles marked in gray indicate
  multiple potential SRF-mediated regulation pathways, such as protein–protein interaction
  and potential induction by the Ras-related GTPases cascades. Blue and pink bubbles
  indicate trans-factors identified in this study that contribute to the basal CFTR
  transcriptional activity. Black and double arrow shows the functional antagonism
  between YY1 and SRF identified in this study through the CFTR-CArG-like element
  characterization.
