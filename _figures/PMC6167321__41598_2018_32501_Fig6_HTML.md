caption: Hypothesis of metformin’s effect on low-level Pb-induced nephrotoxicity in
  rats. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrate that low-level Pb-induced
  renal injury is closely correlated with excretion of d-LA, ALA and GAA. The main
  protective mechanism of metformin is through the methylglyoxal pathway, which reduces
  d-LA excretion.
