caption: The role of DUBs in TGF-β-mediated breast cancer metastasis. DUBs regulate
  the TGF-β pathway to function in breast cancer metastasis. UCHL1. USP15 and USP4
  stabilize membrane TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) via deubiquitination, and thus promote
  TGF-β-induced metastasis. UCHL1 is released by exosomes. USP15 is recruited to TβRI
  with the assistance of TRAF4. USP4 is phosphorylated by AKT, which promotes its
  migration from nucleus to cytoplasm and membrane. In contrast, OTUD1 downregulates
  TβRI by stabilizing the SMAD7–SMUF2 complex, which constructs a E3 ubiquitin ligase
  targeting TβRI for degradation. Elevated free fatty acid (FFA) promotes TGF-β-induced
  ERK activation, which phosphorylates SMAD4 and promotes the formation of the USP9X–Smad4–Smad3
  complex, enhancing transcription of downstream genes of the TGF-β pathway.
