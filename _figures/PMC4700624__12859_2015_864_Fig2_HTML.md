caption: Changes in the representation of IGF-Akt pathway. a shows the protein synthesis
  regulation related part of IGF-Akt pathway []. In this pathway representation relations
  of proteins are well annotated with their directionality, type of interaction, etc.
  b shows that during manual conversion of the canonical pathways to PPI network representation
  (by retrieving all PPI interactions between the fixed set of e nodes) this kind
  of information is lost and only undirected edges represent physical binding between
  proteins. Moreover, the structure of the pathway is altered by extra edges and some
  connections are missing. c shows the effect of the network selection which removes
  redundant edges but retains most of the nodes
