caption: Proposed working hypothesis. Chronic administration of morphine activates
  the ceramide metabolic pathway, resulting in increased formation of S1P in glial
  cells during activation of sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1 and/or 2. After its extracellular
  release, S1P binds S1P receptors (which remain to be identified) on glial cells,
  initiating a series of events culminating in enhanced production of proinflammatory
  cytokines and PN-mediated nitration of glutamate transporters (GTs) and GS. Activation
  of glial TLR4 may provide a link between chronic administration of morphine and
  activation of the ceramide metabolic pathway in the development of morphine-induced
  hyperalgesia and antinociceptive tolerance.
