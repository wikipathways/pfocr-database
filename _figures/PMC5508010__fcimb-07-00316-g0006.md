caption: Bipartite metabolism of IBPs aiming to avoid the exclusive use of glucose
  (an indispensable carbon source of their mammalian host cells) by the IBPs for their
  intracellular metabolism. This strategy divides the bacterial carbon metabolism
  into two modules. Module 1 (green-framed), contains the upper (energy-dependent)
  part of the glycolytic pathway, as well as the oxidative and non-oxidative arms
  of PPP. These metabolic pathways are fed mainly by glucose, glucose-6P or polymers
  (e.g., glycogen) yielding these hexoses and deliver intermediates essential for
  the (energy-dependent) biosynthesis of cell envelope components, nucleotides, aromatic
  amino acids and NADPH, a co-factor essential for several biosynthetic pathways (especially
  fatty acids/lipids). The synthesis of certain cell envelope components and NADPH
  is indispensable for intracellular growth of the IBPs while all other components,
  including aromatic amino acids and nucleotides produced in module 1 can be also
  provided by the host cell (see Figure ). Module 2 (red-framed) comprises the lower
  part of glycolysis, the TCA cycle and electron transport chain (ETC). Module 2 can
  be fed by C3-carbon sources, such as glycerol-(3P), serine, cysteine and pyruvate,
  by glutamine/glutamate and possibly by TCA intermediates, e.g., malate. It delivers
  mainly ATP by (a) substrate phosphorylation through NAD-dependent oxidation of these
  carbon sources and (b) by oxidative phosphorylation via ETC which converts NADH
  back to NAD necessary for maintaining the oxidation of the above carbon substrates.
  Module 2 delivers also intermediates for the biosynthesis of several amino acids,
  all of which can be imported from the host cell. Indispensable is, however the production
  of meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDAP) and PEP for the synthesis of peptidoglycan and
  of Ac-CoA for the biosynthesis for specific cell-envelope-associated fatty acids/lipids
  (see Figure ).
