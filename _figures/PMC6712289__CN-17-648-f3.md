caption: Potential mechanisms proposed for the AS-IV action in experimental models
  of neurological disorders. In step A, the protective effect of AS-IV (10 and 20
  mg/kg) observed in an experimental I/R model as outlined prevented the accumulation
  of CD11b/CD18 positive neutrophils and reduced the expression of the intracellular
  adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which was partially achieved by the strong attenuation
  of TNF-α and IL-1β anti-inflammatory mechanism production by the suppression of
  these molecules related to neutrophil adhesion. Another proposed action mechanism
  reduced BBB permeability and decreased lymphocyte infiltration due to anti-inflammatory
  action, resulting in in decreased neuroinflammation. In step B, the AS-IV acted
  on the ischemic region, decreasing the metabolism of glucose and resulting in the
  reduction of clot area, attenuating the volume of cerebral infarction. The anti-edema
  action of AS-IV was also correlated with AQP4 regulation, which mediates the flow
  of water in the CNS with a consequent decrease of the cerebral edema and reduction
  of microglial activation, followed by reduced BBB interruption and MMP9 (Matrix
  metaloproteinase) related to vasogenic edema, which was inhibited by AS-IV which
  also decreased lymphocyte infiltration. In step C, the effect of the AS-IV was observed
  in a culture of dopaminergic neurons when 100 μM was administered. This model of
  6-OHDA showed cell death in the SNpc (substantia nigra pars compacta), while the
  group treated with AS-IV notably increased cell survival, attenuating the loss of
  dopaminergic neurons since it presented intact germination; and in step D, the AS-IV
  prevented mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing the enzyme action of the SOD and
  GSH antioxidant defense system to convert hydrogen peroxide into H2O and O2, thereby
  preventing lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage. The AS-IV inhibited the
  apoptotic pathway between both action mechanisms proposed for neurodegenerative
  diseases. These action mechanisms were briefly summarized and evaluated in the reviewed
  studies, reporting that AS-IV reduced the activation of the BAX channel (which accelerates
  programmed cell death) and increased Bcl-2 that represses apoptosis. Furthermore,
  AS-IV prevented the activation of the procaspases that activate the effector caspase
  3, thus preventing oxidative stress, apoptosis and a decrease malondialdehyde (MDA)
  which catalyzes the formation of numerous ROS. AS-IV also increased mitochondrial
  potential and ATP generation, inhibiting the membrane pore opening and consequently
  reverting the mitochondrial oxidation. In step E, AS-IV action in the experimental
  model induced by Aβ-amyloid illustrated, since it inhibits Aβ-amyloid formation
  by the APP, thus inhibiting the BACE-1 which cleaves this protein by generating
  the toxic amyloid, and it also inhibited presenilin-1 expression. In step F the
  TH enzyme of dopamine, NO and NOS synthesis increased, which elevated dopamine release
  in the striatum. (The color version of the figure is available in the electronic
  copy of the article).
