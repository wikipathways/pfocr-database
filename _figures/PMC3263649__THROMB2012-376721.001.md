caption: Cyclooxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid pathway in platelets. Thrombin,
  generated in vivo or ex vivo by several chemical or physical stimuli, activates
  its protease-activated receptors (PARs) increasing intraplatelet calcium, which
  triggers phospholipases (PL) A2-dependent cleavage of arachidonic acid (AA) from
  plasma membranes. AA is the enzymatic substrate of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2.
  COX-1-dependent AA path in platelets generates mainly TXA2 which amplifies platelet
  activation by binding to its platelet receptors (TPs). COX-2-dependent AA path in
  normal platelets is less prominent and generates mainly PGE2 which acts as a positive
  modulator of platelet response to other agonists by binding to its platelet receptors
  (EPs). TXA2 both in vivo or ex vivo is nonenzymatically hydrolized to TXB2, which
  is biologically inactive but stable, and can be measured in ex vivo assays or undergoes
  further hepatic enzymatic biotransformation in vivo.
