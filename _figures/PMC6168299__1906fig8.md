caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms in Ang II-induced cholesterol accumulation
  by downregulation of ABCA1 in pancreatic β cells. In healthy β cells (normal status
  shown in the left), transcription factor LXR is recruited into nuclear and induces
  ABCA1 expression to facilitate cholesterol out of the cell, which protects insulin
  secretion response to high glucose. Treatment with Ang II (right) downregulates
  ABCA1 expression by stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway via AT1R and reduction of
  nuclear LXR, resulting in cholesterol accumulation in β cells. As a result, GSIS
  is impaired. C, cholesterol; P, phosphorylation of MEK or ERK.
