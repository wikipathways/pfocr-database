caption: 'Flux-independent signaling by NMDARs in brain disorders. (A) Flux-independent
  signaling by NMDARs leads to neuronal excitotoxicity upon massive glutamatergic
  stimulation. NMDARs trigger InsP3-induced ER Ca2+ release, which inhibits the EF-2
  protein and interferes with protein synthesis. Furthermore, NMDARs can stimulate
  Ca2+ entry through PANX1 channels via Src-dependent phosphorylation of PANX1. Excessive
  Ca2+ entry leads to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, mPTP opening, and apoptosis. Finally,
  agonist binding to GluN2B-containing NMDARs can remove the p85 regulatory subunit
  from the catalytic domain of PI3K, thereby inducing PI3K-dependent NADPH oxidase-2
  (NOX2) activation. NOX2 can also be activated via Ca2+ entry through ionotropic
  NMDARs and lead to cytotoxic superoxide production. The red circle indicates the
  agonist, whereas the blue circle indicates the co-agonist. (B) The Aβ protein binds
  to GluN2B-containing NMDARs to induce a flux-independent signaling pathway that
  leads to AMPAR removal from the PM and dendritic spine shrinkage via the p38 MAPK
  signaling pathway. ↓: decrease; ↑: increase'
