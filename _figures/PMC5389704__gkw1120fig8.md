caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ms2ct6A and other t6A derivatives. In bacteria, A37
  of tRNAs responsible for ANN codons is modified to t6A by multiple enzymes (TsaB,
  TsaC, TsaD and TsaE) using L-threonine, bicarbonate and ATP as substrates. In tRNAThr
  from γ-proteobacteria, t6A37 is methylated by TrmO using AdoMet to form m6t6A37.
  In certain populations of bacteria, fungi, plant and protists, t6A37 is cyclized
  by TcdA using ATP to form ct6A37. In organisms bearing an MtaB homolog, t6A37 and
  ct6A37 in particular tRNAs are 2-thiomethylated by MtaB to form ms2t6A37 and ms2ct6A37,
  respectively.
