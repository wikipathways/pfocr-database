caption: Activated pathways in DCs stimulated by XPa and the immune response during
  immunization and infection. a The activated pathways in DCs induced by XPa. TLR4
  recognizes LPS, TLR5 recognizes the flagellin protein, the cGAS-STING pathway is
  stimulated by nucleic acids, and TLR9 recognizes CpG (which was not detected in
  XPa). MyD88 can activate IRF3 through the TBK1 protein in TLR4 signaling, thus increasing
  downstream gene expression (MyD88–TBK1-independent genes). b The immune response
  during immunization and infection. Upon encountering XPa, DCs are rapidly activated
  and become mature. Mature DCs migrate to the lymph nodes where DCs present antigens
  to T cells. Following antigen encounter, T cells are activated, proliferate, and
  differentiate into effector and memory T cells (TCMs and TEMs). When mice are exposed
  to PAO1 challenge, TEMs help rapidly clear the bacteria
