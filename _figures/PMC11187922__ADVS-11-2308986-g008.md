caption: Schematic illustration of the main findings in this study. The figure depicts
  the cell–cell interactions between Mgp hiMSCs and immune cell subsets within the
  biomaterial‐mediated bone repair process, which is mainly mediated through Mdk/Lrp1
  ligand–receptor pair and SPP1/Integrin pathway. The Mgp hiMSCs could enhance osteogenesis
  via activating the PI3K‐Akt signaling pathway
