caption: 'JAK-STAT regulation of intestinal permeability: Leak Pathway. The leak pathway
  is associated with altered expression and localization of ZO-1, occludin, and tricellulin
  resulting in lower levels of these proteins at the tight junction. Expression of
  JAM-A is also downregulated through the JAK-STAT pathway. JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors
  prevented the decrease in tricellulin expression by IL-13. Furthermore, with tofacitinib
  treatment, the reduced expression and mislocalization of ZO-1 and occludin induced
  by IFN-γ are mostly reversed. JAM-A levels were also corrected by tofacitinib. These
  illustrations were made using BioRender. (JAK: Janus Kinase, STAT: Signal Transducer
  and Activator of Transcription, OCLN: Occludin Gene, TRIC: Tricellulin Gene, JAM-A:
  Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A Gene).'
