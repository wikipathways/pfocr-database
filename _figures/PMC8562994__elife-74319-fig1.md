caption: (A) The parotid gland (orange), which is a major source of saliva, often
  becomes damaged when head and neck cancer patients receive radiation therapy (red
  waves) to kill or shrink their tumors (dark grey). (B) To explore ways to protect
  this sensitive gland, Feng et al. examined how the nutrient nitrate affected miniature
  pigs exposed to radiation. This revealed that the animals that do not receive additional
  nitrate before treatment experience a rapid decrease in salivary flow. Irradiated
  human parotid cells (top) had decreased levels of sialin (green), a protein that
  transports nitrates into serous acinar cells (blue rectangle) which produce saliva.
  As a result, the level of nitrate inside the cell drops, and EGFR (yellow) – one
  of the components of the EGFR-AKT-MAPK signaling pathway – remains in an inactive
  state (red dot). This causes the cells to die (apoptosis), perhaps explaining the
  decline in the flow of saliva in irradiated pigs and humans. Adding inorganic nitrate
  to the cells before treatment (bottom) increases sialin and therefore nitrate levels
  inside the cell. In turn, nitrate could increase the production of sialin, creating
  a positive feedback loop that allows the cell to maintain relatively stable amounts
  of sialin after radiation. This triggers the activation of EGFR (green dot), which
  stimulates the cell to grow and prevents programmed cell death.
