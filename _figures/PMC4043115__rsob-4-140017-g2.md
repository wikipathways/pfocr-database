caption: Intracellular trafficking and cellular requirements for polarization of PIN
  proteins. Auxin binding to its receptor ABP1 inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (CME) through ROP6/RIC4 signalling. PIN proteins require the DRP1 function for CME.
  They are internalized to the TGN/EE and then follow the pathway to the RE that is
  regulated by BEN1 and VPS45/BEN2 ARF-GEFs. Recycling of PIN proteins from the RE
  to the PM is regulated by a GNOM-dependent mechanism. Control of apical and basal
  PIN targeting depends on the phosphorylation status of PIN proteins. PIN proteins
  are directed to the apical domain through phosphorylation by PID/WAG1/WAG2 kinases,
  whereas they are guided to the basal domain by dephosphorylation by means of PP2A/FyPP1/FyPP3
  phosphatases. Basal targeting of PIN cargoes is controlled by GNOM. BFA, brefeldin
  A.
