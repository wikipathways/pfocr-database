caption: 'Effects of addition of cysteine (Cys) to effects of dietary MR on hepatic
  eIF2α and PERK phosphorylation. The effect of a 0.12% MR diet containing 0.2% cysteine
  was compared with the 0.12% MR diet alone as described in . A: Band densities of
  phosphorylated eIF2α (peIF2α) and phosphorylated PERK (pPERK) were expressed relative
  to total eIF2α and PERK, respectively, and compared by ANOVA. Data are presented
  as mean ± SEM (n = 8). *Differ from the CON group at P < 0.05. B: Schematic model
  of proposed mechanisms of GCN2-independent signaling by dietary MR in the liver.
  The diet-induced decrease is GSH activates PERK, which is proposed to activate eIF2/ATF4,
  NRF2, and their corresponding ISR and NRF2 transcriptional programs. ARE, antioxidant
  response element; CARE, C/EBP ATF response element.'
