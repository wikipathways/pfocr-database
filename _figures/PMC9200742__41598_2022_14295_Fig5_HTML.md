caption: Molecular mechanism underlying anti-inflammatory effect of CLU in knee OA
  FLSs. CLU has been reported to protect against IL-1β-induced production of ROS,
  inflammatory cytokine, and cartilage-degrading enzyme in knee OA FLSs through suppressing
  activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which may further impede progression of
  synovitis and subsequent cartilage degradation in knee OA.
