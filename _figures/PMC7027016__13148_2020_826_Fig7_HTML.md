caption: Histone methyltransferases and demethylases are involved in tumor angiogenesis.
  HIF signaling pathway and VEGFA signaling pathway play a central role in tumor angiogenesis.
  LSD1 and G9a could promote HIF1α expression and increase its stability, which subsequently
  accelerates VEGFA and its downstream genes expression, and activates VEGFA signaling
  pathway to regulate tumor angiogenesis. In addition, EZH2, DOT1L, SMYD3, SETD3 and
  SET7 are also involved in regulating VEGFA expression or VEGFA signaling pathway
  during tumor angiogenesis
