caption: Targeting cancer cells with a combination of auranofin (AUR) and a platinum
  agent in the context of the tumor microenvironment. AUR and platinum agents inhibit
  the function of TrxR, inducing an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  mitochondrial permeability, and DNA damage, resulting in cancer cell death. Accumulation
  of intracellular ROS induces ER stress, activation of PERK and caspase-8, and the
  upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK, further potentiating cell death.
  This pathway triggers the release of danger or damage associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) such as calreticulin (ecto-CRT), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein
  and ATP into the tumor microenvironment where they collectively activate antigen
  presenting cells (APCs). Mature APCs migrate into the lymph nodes and present tumor
  antigens to immature T cells, which develop into CD8+T cells with anti-cancer cytotoxic
  activity. The inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on
  cancer cells prevents the neutralization of T cells by cancer cells, maintaining
  T cell cytotoxicity and favoring tumor cell death. This release of DAMPs into the
  tumor microenvironment via ER stress and the consequent activation of T cells is
  known as immunogenic cell death or ICD
