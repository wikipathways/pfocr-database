caption: Proposed metabolic pathway derived from the metabolites significantly altered
  in liver tissues depending on the administration of Platycodon grandiflorum to High-Fat
  Diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. In the histograms, the peak intensity was plotted
  on the y-axis, while the different experimental groups were plotted on the x-axis.
  Black square ND, group fed with a normal diet; red square HFD, group fed with a
  high-fat diet; orange square HPGL, group fed with a high-fat diet and 1% P. grandiflorum;
  brown square HPGH, group fed with a high-fat diet and 5% P. grandiflorum.
