caption: 'The conventional folate (a) and biopterin (b) biosynthetic pathways as found
  in (a) plants, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that are capable of de novo folate
  synthesis, and (b) in mammals and other organisms that utilize 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4) as a cofactor. Certain organisms, such as some fungi, cyanobacteria and pseudomonads,
  possess both pathways. Pathway (c) involving the P. falciparum PTPS orthologue is
  demonstrated in this work and (d) shows the substrates (i), (iii) and products (ii),
  (iv) of conventional DHNA and PTPS enzymes respectively. Underlined product (ii)
  in pathways (a) and (c) is 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (6HMDP), the required
  substrate for PPPK. Asterisked product (iv) in pathway (c) was identified from its
  oxidation product (see text). Abbreviations: GTPC, GTP cyclohydrolase I; P, poorly
  defined phosphatase activity (thought in some systems to first involve loss of pyrophosphate
  then subsequent removal of the final phosphate); DHNA, dihydroneopterin aldolase;
  PPPK, hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase; DHPS, dihydropteroate synthase;
  DHFS, dihydrofolate synthase; PTPS, pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase; SR, sepiapterin
  reductase.'
