caption: The integrated proteomic and metabolomic results showed that several biological
  pathways were enriched, and these pathways contained proteins and metabolites that
  were significantly upregulated in BF or BP. (A) The enriched pathways of significant
  proteins and metabolites, the colour of the dots represent significance based on
  the combined p‐value, with red more significant and yellow less significant, and
  the size of the circle represents the pathway impact factor. (B) The pathway of
  cysteine and methionine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.
  Squares are identified proteins, circles are identified metabolites, and text which
  is not within a square/circle are proteins and metabolites included in the pathways
  but not identified in this study. Green indicates proteins and metabolites which
  showed no significant differences between the two sample types, red represents significantly
  higher abundance in BF, and blue represents significantly lower abundance in BF.
