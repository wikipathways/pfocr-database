caption: Action of SPOCK1 in hepatoma cell lines. In harmony with previous results,
  Spock-1 stimulates the Akt-mTOR pathway. Akt activation results in apoptosis inhibition.
  The mitochondrial localization of the proteoglycan may interfere in other ways as
  well with the apoptotic activity, which needs further evaluation. SPOCK1 silencing
  resulted in the downregulation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase receptor and members
  of the Sarc tyrosine kinase family, indicating the stimulatory potential of the
  proteoglycan on the signaling activity, partly through the MAPK pathway. Furthermore,
  SPOCK1 inhibition pointed to a decrease of two nuclear proteins CREB and CDK4; the
  former is a multivalent transcription factor with strong oncogenic potential, and
  the latter is the stimulator of cell cycle. Both nuclear proteins can be upregulated
  via MAPK signaling. Furthermore, CREB establishes interaction with several nuclear
  factors, facilitates DNA synthesis, and regulates chromatin function as well. Its
  action is in a good agreement with the effect of SPOCK1 on DNA synthesis, cell migration,
  and invasion ().
