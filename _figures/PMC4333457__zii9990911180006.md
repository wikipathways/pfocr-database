caption: Proposed human innate immune signaling pathways activated during V. cholerae
  O1 infection of the duodenum. We developed this model by combining our proteomic
  results and the results of the pathway analyses using Ingenuity's IPA software.
  Our model draws connections between differentially abundant proteins in our data
  set (red boxes), predicted upstream regulators (blue boxes and circles), enriched
  canonical pathways (blue lines), and proteins/pathways known to respond to V. cholerae
  and cholera toxin (CT) in vitro (black boxes, circles, and lines). Dashed lines
  represent binding interactions, whereas solid lines with arrowheads indicate activation
  or regulation of a downstream protein. Solid lines with blunt ends indicate repression
  of a downstream protein. Upon exposure to V. cholerae, TLR4 is stimulated, which
  leads to activation of NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome; concurrently, CT stimulates
  G-protein-coupled receptors (GM1), which activate p38 MAPK. These inflammatory mediators
  drive production of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, IL-12β, and IFN-β; NOS2 is
  also activated, leading to nitric oxide (NO) production. IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-18
  function in autocrine loops to further amplify their own production, the inflammatory
  response via NF-κB and NLRP3, and cell death by apoptosis. IL-17A produced by activated
  T cells aids in regulating innate defense protein production, such as that of S100A8
  and S100A9. Interactions found using Ingenuity's Knowledge Base are labeled with
  actions, and references are given in parentheses (, ). IFNR, IFN receptor.
