caption: Fibrillar Aβ activates the classical (and alternative) pathway of complement,
  resulting in C3b/iC3b deposition on plaques, glial recruitment and generation of
  neurotoxic molecules, and potential lysis by the Membrane attack complex (MAC/C5b-9)
  of complement. The red and green arrows signify pathways that are probably detrimental
  and protective respectively. The yellow arrows represent events that are suggested
  to occur in response to complement activation in vivo but have yet to be definitively
  proven. The black dotted lines indicate potential targets for intervention/inhibition
  of detrimental pathways. Modified from ().
