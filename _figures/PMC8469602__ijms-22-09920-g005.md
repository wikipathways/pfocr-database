caption: Schematic showing the mechanism of T2R-mediated Gram-positive bacterial internalization
  and survival in GECs. T2R14-mediated internalization of S. aureus might involve
  actin remodeling, while S. mutans internalize via T2R/TLR-dependent mechanisms in
  GECs (pathway (1A,B)). T2R14 in GEC influences actin remodeling (based on cytochalasin
  D treatment and PAK1-associated actin pull-down), thus modulating bacterial internalization
  (pathway (2)). The activation to T2R14 signaling by bacteria or their signaling
  molecules leads to an increased secretion of innate immune markers, such as IL-8/CXCL8
  and antimicrobial peptide hBD-2 in GECs. It is currently unknown whether T2R14 internalizes
  into clathrin-coated vesicles and signals (dotted arrows on the membrane). Figure
  was drawn by using BioRender, Toronto, ON, Canada.
