caption: Because AMPK inhibits mTORC1 by direct and indirect mechanisms, drugs that
  activate AMPK could be effective in the treatment of cancer. The best-described
  AMPK activators (shown in bold) are metformin, AICAR, 2-DG, PIAs, and A-769662.
  Metformin is a biguanide widely prescribed for the treatment of type II diabetes,
  AICAR is an AMP mimetic, and 2-DG is a glucose analogue. These three drugs activate
  AMPK by mechanisms that are dependent upon the upstream kinase and tumor suppressor,
  LKB1. Conversely, the lipid-based Akt inhibitors, PIAs, activate AMPK independently
  of LKB1 (or Akt, not shown). However, cellular activation of AMPK by PIAs is dependent
  upon another upstream kinase, CaMKKβ. The thienepyridone A-769662 activates purified
  AMPK in vitro, and might also activate AMPK directly in cells.
