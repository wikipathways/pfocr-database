caption: Simplified visualization of NAD+ production pathways. Mutations in the FH
  gene result in the accumulation of fumarate, leading to global DNA hypermethylation
  and subsequent silencing of NAPRT. FH-mutant tumor cells rely on the NAD+ salvage
  pathway for NAD+ production. Inhibiting NAMPT disrupts this pathway and induces
  tumor cell death. Additionally, PARP inhibitors can be used in combination with
  NAMPT inhibitors for synergistic tumor cell killing. The five arrows in the de novo
  synthesis pathway indicate the five additional steps to synthesize quinolinic acid
  from tryptophan.*PARPs are not the only enzyme that converts NAD+ to NAM; sirtuins
  also catalyze that transformation.NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase
