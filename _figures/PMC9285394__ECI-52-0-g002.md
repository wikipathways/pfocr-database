caption: 'Overview of the contractile apparatus in vSMC and mutations affecting vSMC
  functions causing TAAD formation. The contraction of vSMC is initiated by Ca2+ influx,
  binding to calmodulin. This Ca2+/Calmodulin complex binds to myosin light chain
  kinase, which phosphorylates the myosin filaments and results in contraction. Decrease
  in the Ca2+ concentration within in the cell inactivates myosin light chain kinase
  and de‐phosphorylation of the myosin filaments, controlled by type I cGMP‐dependent
  protein kinase, results in vSMC relaxation. Mutations in genes encoding for vSMC
  contractile apparatus proteins (indicated in red) result in reduced force generation.
  Mutations in genes encoding for the large glycoprotein fibrillin‐1 (indicated in
  red) affect the structure of microfibrils and result in increased active TGF‐β levels.
  Mutations in the TGF‐β signalling pathway and downstream proteins (indicated in
  red) can also contribute to TAAD formation by affecting transcription. Abbreviations:
  Ca2+, calcium ion; P, phosphate; TAAD, thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection;
  TGFBR, transforming growth factor β receptor; TGF‐β, transforming growth factor
  β; vSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell. Elements were modified from Servier Medical
