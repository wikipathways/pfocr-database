caption: Aging-induced M1 proinflammatory phenotype promotes Nrf2-ARE pathway disruption
  in the subventricular zone (SVZ) driving neurogenic impairment in parkinsonian mice
  via PI3K-Wnt/β-catenin dysregulation. In young mice a regulatory circuit linking
  microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine to Nrf2-ARE protective pathway
  in SVZ, provides an efficient self-adaptive mechanism against inflammatory/neurotoxin-induced
  oxidative stress. In addition to govern the redox balance within the SVZ niche,
  Nrf2-induced Hmox target gene may simultaneously protect astrocytes, thereby up-regulating
  the expression of vital Wnt signaling elements switching-on key components required
  for maintaining SVZ cells in a proliferative state, promote differentiation and/or
  for exerting neuroprotective effects. Crosstalk between two pivotal pathways, the
  PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades appear to cooperate to finely
  control the transcriptional activator, β-catenin, in turn representing a point of
  convergence to direct proliferation/differentiation/survival in SVZ stem niche.
  Importantly, SVZ “rejuvenation” may have beneficial consequences for DAergic neuroprotection,
  and viceversa. Astrocytes (blue), neuroblasts (red), transit-aplifying cells (yellow)
  and ependymal (purple) cells in SVZ niche are schematically illustrated (modified
