caption: YAP promotes cancer cell survival and resistance to RAF-MEK-targeting agents.
  The figure shows a schematic of the role of YAP in BRAF- and RAS-mutant tumor cells
  and areas for future exploration, such as the basis of molecular crosstalk and co-regulation
  of target genes between YAP and the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway. MAPK, mitogen
  activated protein kinase; YAP, yes-associated protein.

  pathway inhibitors.
