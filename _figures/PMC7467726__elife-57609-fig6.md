caption: Cells in low glucose perform gluconeogenesis (Dark cells), as would be required
  in low glucose medium. During this process, dark cells predominantly budget aspartate
  for their carbon needs to synthesize trehalose. The accumulated trehalose reserves
  in the dark cells allow them to survive environmental challenges including desiccation
  and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Trehalose also accumulates externally, and once
  threshold levels of external trehalose are reached, some cells stochastically switch
  to the light state and utilize this trehalose to fuel their high glycolysis and
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. Cells that switch to the light cell state
  predominantly use aspartate as a ‘nitrogen’ source to synthesize nucleotides via
  PPP, while utilizing trehalose for their carbon needs. This makes light cells primed
  for proliferation, which in turn results in increased or directional colony expansion.
  This metabolic specialization and division of labor between the light and dark cells
  creates a cross-feeding system (built around trehalose), and allows the colony as
  a whole to survive unfavorable conditions and forage efficiently even in nutrient
  limiting conditions.
