caption: Sequence of intracellular events leading from the binding of AVP to its V2
  receptor (top) to the insertion of AQP2 water channels into the apical membrane
  (bottom). The potential pre-cAMP formation sites that can be disrupted are (a) activation
  of inhibitory G protein (Gi) by the increased activity of PKC brought about by diacylglycerol
  (DAG) formed as a result of stimulation of the PI signalling pathway by agents such
  as PGE2 and ATP, and (b) decreased activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms 5
  and 6 expressed in the medullary collecting duct. The potential post-cAMP formation
  sites which can be disrupted are (a) rapid hydrolysis of cAMP by phosphodiesterases
  (PDE; isoforms III and IV) by calcium-calmodulins activated through the PI signalling
  pathway by agents such as PGE2 and ATP and (b) decreased activity of PKA, resulting
  in decreased protein phosphorylation and membrane insertion of AQP2
