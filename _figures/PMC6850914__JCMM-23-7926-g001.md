caption: Signal transduction pathways initiated by IL‐29. IL‐29, a heterodimeric cytokine,
  binds to receptor complex composed of IL‐28R1 and IL‐10R2. The induced Janus kinase/signal
  transduction and activator of transcription (JAK‐STAT) pathway leads to the activation
  of STAT1 and STAT2, and subsequently combines with IRF9 to form ISGF3 transcription
  factor complex. The formed complex transmits signalling to the nucleus. Similarly,
  the activating signalling was transmitted to the nucleus via mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (Akt), nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) and nuclear
  factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1) pathways, presenting the ability of antiviral
  protection, anti‐proliferative response and immune regulation
