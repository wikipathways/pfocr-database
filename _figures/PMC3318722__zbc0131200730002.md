caption: Standard lignin biosynthetic pathway in angiosperms, adapted from Vanholme
  et al. (), also showing putative pathways for synthesis of monolignol p-coumarate
  conjugates 3. The predominant route toward the three main monolignols 1 is shown,
  with some of the more minor pathways in gray. The various routes through the pathway
  have been reviewed (, ). 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; HCT, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate
  shikimate p-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate/coniferaldehyde
  5-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid/5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde O-methyltransferase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; POD, a generic peroxidase (generating the radicals
  required for monomer polymerization to lignin). Compound numbers are from .
