caption: Proposed model for GPAA1 promoting growth and metastasis of gastric cancer.
  The genetically amplification results in upregulation of GPAA1 in gastric cancer,
  which consequently promotes growth and metastasis of this malignant tumour. On the
  one hand, the upregulation of GPAA1 facilitates increased amount of metastasis-promotive
  GPI-anchored protein, such as MMPs, C4.4A, and UPAR; on the other hand, the aberrant
  overexpression of GPAA1 enhances the formation of lipid raft, which next activates
  ERBB signalling to promote proliferation of gastric cancer

  protein and enhancement of ERBB signalling pathway.
