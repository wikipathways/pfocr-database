caption: 'Antibiotic-specific biochemical pathways of resistance. Proteins that exhibited
  significant changes in abundance (±2-fold compared with untreated cells; p value
  < 0.05) in (A) streptomycin or (B) doxycycline-treated cells were mapped to molecular
  pathways by functional network associations (glycolysis, green; transcription and
  translation, gray; removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), red; iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
  cluster biogenesis, blue; nitrogen cycle, tan; fatty acid biosynthesis, purple;
  arginine cycle, pink; tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, yellow, capsular polysaccharide
  (CPS) biosynthesis, orange). Regulation of pathway reactions by proteins exhibiting
  unchanged (black vector), increased (green vector), or decreased (red segment) abundance.
  Selected cellular proteins are designated by shape: outer membrane porins (oval
  dimers), components involved in electron transport (pentagon), protein synthesis
  (oval), or removal of ROS (circle). The protein color is identical for pathway regulation
  that is common to both antibiotics, and subdued with red dashed borders if down-regulated
  in one treatment versus the other.'
