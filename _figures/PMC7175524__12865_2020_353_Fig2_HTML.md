  Middle: In contrast to immunotherapies, the administration of epitherapies alters
  the gene expression of T cells. Epitherapy may “level the playing field” between
  cancer and immune cells by reducing tumor aggression through reprogramming of cancer
  stem cells from the mesenchymal to the epithelial phenotype. Additionally, epitherapies
  prime different subsets of exhausted T cells to better respond to immunotherapy.
  Different classes of epigenetic therapy have distinct transcriptional roles in resetting
  the epigenome. Right: Once primed by epitherapies and treated with monoclonal antibodies,
  such as blockade to the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, T cells have optimal capacity for reinvigoration
  long term'
