caption: Model for the components and downstream targets of the cAMP/protein kinase
  A (PKA) pathway in Cryptococcus neoformans. The upstream components of the proposed
  pathway are associated with the plasma membrane (horizontal line) and respond to
  extracellular signals such as glucose and amino acids [, -]. The proteins include
  the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr4, a Gbeta-like/RACK1 homolog Gib2, a regulator
  of G-protein signaling Crg2 and the G-protein alpha subunit Gpa1 [, -]. These components
  influence the activity of adenylyl cyclase (Cac1), as does the Aca1 protein and
  CO2/HCO3-, to ultimately influence cAMP levels [, , -]. Phosphodiesterases (Pde1/2)
  can also act to reduce cAMP levels and dampen signaling []. The levels of this second
  messenger influence the activity of PKA by binding the regulatory subunit (Pkr1)
  and causing its dissociation from the catalytic subunits (Pka1 and Pka2) [, ]. Processes
  that are discussed in the text and influenced by the pathway and by Pka1 and Pka2
  are shown below the catalytic subunits. Some of these processes are regulated by
  the transcription factors Rim101 and Nrg1, although direct connections have not
  been established in all cases [, ]. This situation is reflected by the arrows from
  Pka1 and by the possibility of other regulatory factors indicated by the protein
  with a question mark.
