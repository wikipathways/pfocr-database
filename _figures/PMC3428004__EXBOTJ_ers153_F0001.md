caption: 'A schematic representation of the FVBP pathway in MD. Glycolysis and the
  pentose phosphate (PP) pathways provide the initial carbon substrates (phosphoenolpyruvate
  and erythrose-4-phosphate, respectively) for the condensation to a benzene ringed
  structure through the shikimate pathway. The aromatic amino acid phenylalanine is
  generated by a succession of two plastid enzymes (CHORISMATE MUTASE, CM; AROGENATE
  DEHYDRATASE, ADT). PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL) converts phenylalanine to t-cinnamic
  acid, or PAL can associate with CINNAMTE-4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H) ultimately to form
  p-coumaric acid. Floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (FVBP) metabolic branch
  1 emanates from phenylalanine with the PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE (PAAS) enzyme,
  branch 2 by way of t-cinnamic acid through ACYL-ACTIVATING ENZYME (AAE), and branch
  3 from p-coumaric acid. All FVBP compounds are boxed with a black line. Enzymes
  also depicted: PHENYLACETALDEHYDE REDUCTASE (PAR), CONIFERYL ALCOHOL ACYLTRANSFERASE
  (CFAT), ISOEUGENOL SYNTHASE 1 (IGS1), EUGENOL SYNTHASE1 (EGS1), and 3-KETOACYL-COA
  THIOLASE (KAT1).'
