caption: Simplified Scheme of Predicted Fluxes of C16 and C18 Fatty Acids in Membrane
  Leaf Glycerolipids of Arabidopsis Wild-Type, fatb-ko, and fatb-ko act1 Mutant Plants.The
  numbers in the figure represent average values of mol % units of C16 and C18 fatty
  acids accumulated in membrane glycerolipids. A range of values is given when alternative
  biosynthetic pathways were considered (see text for details). The average mol %
  units were calculated based on the mol % abundance of a particular fatty acid in
  a specific lipid, the relative abundance of the lipid, and the contribution of each
  pathway (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) to the synthesis of that lipid () (see Discussion
  for more details). Arrows represent the flux of acyl molecules through FATB and
  FATA, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KAS-II), and lysophosphatidate sn-2 acyltransferase
  (LPAAT), which are either used for lipid biosynthesis in the plastid (prokaryotic
  pathway) or exported from the same organelle. ACT1 (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase)
  transfers 18:1 to glycerol-3-phosphate in the prokaryotic pathway. Question marks
  indicate that (1) the actual flux of 16:0 through FATA in wild-type leaves is not
  known and an upper limit of 4 mol % units can be estimated based on fatb-ko data
  (however, flux through FATA in fatb-ko could be a compensatory mechanism) and (2)
  alternative pathways for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol in the fatb-ko
  act1 double mutant can be considered.
