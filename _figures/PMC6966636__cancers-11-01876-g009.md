caption: 'HMGCS2-mediated ketogenesis impacts liver cancer progression and treatment.
  The mechanism operates as follows: Downregulation of HMGCS2 expression reduces ketone
  production and promotes liver cancer cell proliferation and migration by enhancing
  c-Myc/cyclin D1 and EMT signaling and by suppressing the caspase-dependent apoptosis
  pathway. Administration of a ketogenic diet significantly inhibited liver cancer
  cell growth in mice. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic strategy
  of targeting HMGCS2-mediated ketogenesis in liver cancer.'
