caption: Natural products upregulating TGF‐β pathway in treatment of leukemia. This
  schematic represents the modulation of TGF‐β signaling by natural compounds in specific
  forms of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia‐related
  changes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia (NB4), and leukemic
  mouse model. Natural ingredients such as green tea extract (GTE), halofuginone (HF),
  and ethanolic olive leaf extract (EOLE) are shown to downregulate TGF‐β signaling.
  The canonical TGF‐β signaling pathway involves the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which
  then forms a complex with Smad4 and translocates to the nucleus to influence gene
  expression. Key impacts of these natural compounds include inhibition of immune
  surveillance genes (e.g., reduced NK cells and IFN‐γ, increased TNF‐α and Treg cells),
  inhibition of apoptotic‐trigger genes (granzyme, perforin), and activation of angiogenesis
  genes (VEGF). This diagram highlights the intricate roles of GTE, HF, and EOLE in
  modulating TGF‐β signaling and their potential therapeutic effects in leukemia.
