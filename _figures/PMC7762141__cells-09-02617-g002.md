caption: Host immune response against P. aeruginosa infections in the pseudostratified
  respiratory epithelium. (a) Recognition of P. aeruginosa. Pathogen recognition receptors
  (PRRs) located on the immune cells (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9) recognise the PAMPs
  of P. aeruginosa (Lipoprotein, LPS, flagellin, and CpG-DNA, respectively) and trigger
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. OMV endocytosis activates
  the NF-κB pathway. (b) Innate immune response. (i) Neutrophils, recruited in response
  to P. aeruginosa (ii) Macrophages, which phagocytise bacteria or dying neutrophils
  (iii) complement system (CS). (c) Adaptive immune response. A skewed Th2 response
  occurs during P. aeruginosa infection with high but inefficient antibody production.
  In addition, the production of sIgA seems to be relevant, as its levels may correlate
  with the status of Pseudomonas infection.
