caption: Schematic figure for the molecular mechanisms of bile acids and farnesoid
  X receptors (FXR) among gut microbiota, hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and circadian
  rhythms. As the speed-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis,
  CYP7A1 can be downregulated by FXR activated by bile acids and fibroblast growth
  factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 4 activated by FGF15. FGF15 is expressed and secreted
  by intestinal endothelial cells (IECs). FXR activated by bile acids in IECs contributes
  to the expression of FGF15. Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) give diurnal rhythms
  to the generation of FGF15. Partial primary bile acids are transformed into secondary
  bile acids mainly through the 7alpha-dehydroxylation of certain members of gut microbiota.
  FXR binding with bile acids can upregulate antimicrobial peptides, which can suppress
  the overgrowth of gut microbiota. Primary and secondary bile acids return to liver
  via portal system. In liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), bile acids can
  activate the FXR and leading to the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS), increasing the level of NO and decrease the pressure in portal system. Secondary
  bile acids can activate NF-κB signaling and senescence-associated secretary phenotype
  (SASP) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thus promoting cirrhosis, while under some
  circumstances, bile acids can prevent the activation of HSCs by upregulating peroxisome
  proliferation-associated receptor gamma (PPARγ). FXR binding with bile acids can
  inhibit the expression of osteopontin in natural killer T (NKT) cells, the interleukin
  (IL)-6 induced expression of C reactive protein (CRP) in hepatocytes, and the expression
  of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) in macrophages. Acetylation of FXR
  leads to a series of pro-inflammatory issues and impaired substance metabolism,
  while small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-ylation of FXR can inhibit the expression
  of NF-κB pathway-related molecules. FXR can also downregulate the expression of
  Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) and perturb the infection of
  hepatitis B virus (HBV). The transcription of HBV is also regulated differently
  when FXR is activated by different ligands. Period (Per) and REV-ERBα, as central
  circadian clock transcription factors, upregulates NTCP and CYP7A1, respectively.
