caption: (A) Interactions found in polyQ-containing ID hub proteins located in both
  cytoplasm and nucleus using protein interaction annotation of HPRD. Direction of
  arrow indicates the protein interaction annotation used (i.e., “A → B” depicts that
  the HPRD annotation for protein interactors of protein A includes protein B; double-headed
  arrow depicts PPIs found in both proteins). Red and blue boxes indicate polymorphic
  and monomorphic in polyQ repeat length, respectively. (B) Ataxin-1 and USP7 participate
  in the same signaling pathway
