caption: Acute stress is detected by the amygdala, which sends signals to the hypothalamus
  to activate the two stress response systems. The hypothalamus stimulates the sympathetic
  branch of the autonomic nervous system (sympatho-adrenal-medullary axis). This direct
  pathway from the hypothalamus to the medulla of the adrenal glands causes rapid
  release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) using synaptic mechanisms
  in what is known as the fight-or-flight response. These effects stop approximately
  10min after the cessation of the stressor. In the parasympathetic division of the
  autonomic nervous system, the slower acting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
  axis relies on a hormonal-based signaling cascade. The hypothalamus releases corticotrophin-releasing
  factor (CRF), which travels through the pituitary portal system to the pituitary
  gland and stimulates it to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then
  stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, which initially increases access
  to energy stores for the body to use during the stress response. The hypothalamus
  and pituitary glands have cortisol receptors that create a negative feedback loop.
  When stimulated, CRF and ACTH production is suppressed, thus reversing the effects.
  These initial effects begin roughly 10–15min after stressor onset and continue for
  hours past stressor cessation, in order to restore system-wide homeostasis. This
