caption: Intracellular immune signaling in S. exigua hemocytes following fungal infection.
  Fungal hyphae or conidia are recognized by pattern recognition receptor (‘PRR’),
  which activates the Toll pathway to increase PLA2 activity. The activated PLA2 releases
  linoleic acid (‘LA’), which is desaturated and elongated into arachidonic acid (‘AA’).
  AA is then oxygenated by two peroxinectins (‘POX F/H’) into PGH2, which is isomerized
  into TXA2/TXB2 by TXA2 synthase (‘TXAS’). TXA2/TXB2 is transferred out of the cell
  to bind with its GPCR (‘PGE2R’) and activate phospholipase C (‘PLC’). PLC increases
  intracellular inositol triphosphate (‘IP3’) concentrations which binds to its receptor
  (‘IP3R’) on endoplasmic reticulum, thereby releasing Ca2+ into the cytoplasm Ca2+
  triggers calcium-induced calcium release (‘CICR’) from a ryanodine receptor (‘RyR’).
  The free Ca2+ is a secondary signal to activate small G proteins for actin polymerization
  to facilitate hemocyte behavior.
