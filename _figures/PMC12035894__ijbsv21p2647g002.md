caption: Carcinogenic mechanisms of estrogen and its metabolites in breast cells.
  A. This figure illustrates the potential oncogenic signaling pathways of estrogen
  and its metabolites in breast cells. There are three main oncogenic signaling pathways
  associated with estrogen, all of which involve the participation of ER. 4-OHE2,
  an estrogen metabolite, also plays a significant role in the oncogenic signaling
  pathway. It may act on ER to induce oncogenic signals and may also be capable of
  generating oncogenic signals through a pathway that is independent of ER. B. This
  figure illustrates the mechanism through which the genotoxicity of estrogen and
  its metabolites leads to breast cancer. The potential mechanisms primarily involve
  depurination and redox cycling. This genotoxic effect ultimately leads to damage
  or breakage of the DNA structure, thereby causing the transformation of breast cells
  into cancerous cells. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; 4-OHE2, 4-hydroxyestradiol;

  3 kinase; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
