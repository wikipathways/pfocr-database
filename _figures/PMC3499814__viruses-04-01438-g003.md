caption: The type I IFN signaling pathway and inhibition by influenza A viruses (Figure
  adapted from []). IFN-β produced by influenza virus-infected cells binds IFN receptors
  causing the phosphorylation of Tyk2 and Jak1. This is followed by binding and phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2 which subsequently form a complex with IRF9. This ISGF-3 complex
  acts as a transcription factor for >300 genes, several of which display an antiviral
  effect (see text). The expressed protein PKR is activated upon recognition of viral
  dsRNA, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis, including viral proteins. PKR
  is inhibited by the cellular protein P58IPK, however P58IPK activity is downregulated
  by binding cellular hsp40. The IRF7 protein is phosphorylated in the presence of
  influenza A virus, leading to activation of a positive feedback loop, causing the
  transcription of IFN-α and IFN-β. Indicated in red are mechanisms of the influenza
  A virus to interfere with this pathway, these interfering mechanisms are explained
  more extensively in the text.
