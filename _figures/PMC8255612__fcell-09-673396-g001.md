caption: 'Post-translational modification of BMP signaling components. (A) Conventional
  model of BMP signaling pathway. Upon BMP ligand binding, BMP type 1 receptor (BMPR1)
  is phosphorylated. Subsequently, R-SMADs, SMAD1/5/8, become phosphorylated and,
  together with SMAD4, localize into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. This
  process can be inhibited by SMAD6. Additional post-translational modifications affect
  the signaling pathway in various ways: SMAD6 can regulate BMPR1 by facilitating
  its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Upon ubiquitination of SMAD6, SMAD6
  loses its ability to inhibit the BMP signaling cascade, which ultimately leads to
  upregulation of the signaling pathway. When SMAD4 undergoes sumoylation, nuclear
  accumulation of the protein is enhanced. (B) N-glycosylation. N-glycans can bind
  to BMP ligands as well as to BMP type 2 receptors (BMPR2), enabling proper folding
  and binding of the proteins. (C) O-GlcNAcylation. In Drosophila, Sxc facilitates
  O-GlcNAcylation of Sax, the ortholog for human ALK2, resulting in the attenuation
  of the signaling pathway.'
