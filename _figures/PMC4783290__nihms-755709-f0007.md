caption: 'Interplay between retinoic acid (RA), etv5a, and Notch signaling in the
  renal progenitor field mediates multiciliated cell (MCC) formation during nephrogenesis.
  etv5a responds downstream of RA signaling to promote MCC fate, although it is likely
  that etv5a is not the only target of RA in this pathway. Conversely, Notch signaling
  inhibits etv5a activity to restrict MCC formation and favor transportive cell identity.
  In addition, etv4 promotes MCC fate, although it is not resolved if etv4 acts within
  renal progenitors or neighboring tissues, and whether other known MCC specification
  factors impact etv4 in other embryonic locales to affect pronephros development.
  Abbreviations: P (podocyte), N (neck), PCT (proximal convoluted tubule), PST (proximal
  straight tubule), DE (distal early), CS (corpuscle of Stannius), DL (distal late),
  PD (pronephric duct), C (cloaca).'
