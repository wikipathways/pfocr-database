caption: Working model. A diagram showing our working model. Under homeostatic conditions
  of normoglycemia, podocyte expressed miR-146a suppresses expression of Notch-1 and
  ErbB4 to maintain healthy cells. Diabetic milieu, including TGF-β1 (and MCP-1),
  induces MCP1 and MCPIP1 in podocytes, which decreases miR-146a levels. This results
  in de-repression of Notch-1 and ErbB4, which together with EGFR, induce podocyte
  injury. Blocking this signaling pathway with ErbB4/EGFR inhibitors suppresses the
  harmful signaling and decreases podocyte injury in vitro and glomerulopathy in vivo.
