caption: Model proposed for the coronavirus 5′-terminal double-stranded template switch-facilitating
  structure and pathway for the RdRp template switch in trans. (A) Model for the putative
  double-stranded template switch-facilitating structure. Mapped acceptor hot spots
  (boxed) for template switches onto the bovine coronavirus genome and antigenome
  drawn as an open structure in the context of stem-loops I, II, and III as predicted
  and structure mapped in the positive strand (, ). In the negative strand, stem-loops
  II and III are predicted (), and stem-loop I is drawn as a near-mirror image of
  stem-loop I in the positive strand. The 65-nt leader and antileader sequences are
  shaded, the nucleotides making up the leader-associated intergenic core sequence
  (UCUAAAC) in the loop of stem-loop II are underlined, and the start codon for open
  reading frame 1 is boxed. It should be noted that the stem-loop I region for group
  2 coronaviruses (represented here as nt 1 to 51 for BCoV) has recently been alternatively
  represented as two stem-loops by Kang et al. (). (B)  Proposed model as redrawn
  from Zúñiga et al. () for positive-to-positive-strand template switching from donor
  to acceptor sites in cis during synthesis of negative-strand templates for sgmRNA
  synthesis. In this model, only the positive-strand viral genomic template is shown.
  The matching donor and acceptor regions are checkered. Base-paired regions between
  the positive-strand genome and nascent negative strand are indicated by vertical
  lines. The complete transcription complex with proteins and RNA is depicted by the
  shaded oval. (C) Proposed model as drawn by Wu et al. () for positive-to-positive-strand
  template switching in trans from a DI RNA donor to the viral genome acceptor. In
  this model, only the positive-strand templates are shown. (D) Proposed model for
  positive-to-negative-strand template switching in trans from a DI RNA donor to the
  viral antigenome acceptor (to explain the data in this report). In this model, both
  the full-length viral genome and antigenome templates are shown. The switch generates
  a chimeric ambisense product that is potentially longer than the viral genome. Note
  that in this model the 3′ terminus of the completed viral antigenome along with
  the 5′ terminus of the viral genome are components of the transcription complex.
