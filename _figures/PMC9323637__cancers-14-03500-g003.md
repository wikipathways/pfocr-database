caption: The pleiotropic effects of tumor cells, cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. The mevalonate
  (MVA) pathway upregulation in tumor cells contributes to increased protein prenylation
  and activation of GTPases, including Rho, and increased Hippo pathway activity,
  specifically YAP. MVA pathway activity, as well as Rho and YAP, contribute to epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and therapy resistance. MVA pathway upregulation
  activates the ERRα pathway in CSCs, which in turn stimulates multiple proto-oncogenes,
  enhancing the propagation of CSCs and promoting therapy resistance. Rho activation
  increases stemness of CAFs, which also contribute to increased HMG-CoA synthase
  1 (HMGCS1) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) expression, sustaining increased MVA pathway
  expression. Upregulated MVA signaling also alters immune cell function by stimulating
  T-cells’ shift to aerobic glycolysis, fueling MVA metabolism as well as increased
  SREBP-2 activity. The non-sterol branch of the MVA pathway is also implicated in
  increasing T-cell proliferation, migration and cytotoxic responses. Macrophage survival
  is also promoted in a Rac-1-dependent manner. Together, the various cell types within
  the tumor microenvironment contribute to the promotion of tumorigenesis.
