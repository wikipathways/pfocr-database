caption: The polyamines, spermine, spermidine and their diamine precursor, putrescine,
  are naturally occurring polycations that are essential for the normal growth and
  proliferation of all cells. These ubiquitous molecules play an important role in
  numerous physiological functions such as cell growth and proliferation, nucleic
  acid and protein synthesis, cell adhesion and repair of the extracellular matrix,
  immunity, etc. (– and references therein). The cellular concentrations of these
  compounds are highly regulated via biosynthesis, transport, degradation and interconversion
  of these molecules and also through the induction and degradation of the enzymes
  involved in their biosynthesis and degradation. A reduced level of polyamines has
  been shown to affect cell proliferation, migration, and cause defective embryo development,
  while over accumulation induces apoptosis and cell transformation (). Altered levels
  of polyamines have been found in disease conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease
  (), cystic fibrosis (,) and in a variety of tumor and cancer cells (–). The polyamine
  metabolic pathway in higher mammals, including humans is well understood (, ,  and
  references therein). The first committed and regulatory step in the polyamine biosynthetic
  pathway is the conversion of ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase
  (). The successive polyamines, spermidine and spermine are then synthesized by the
  sequential addition of aminopropyl groups to putrescine catalyzed by their respective
  synthases (). Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), the key enzyme in
  the catabolism of eukaryotic polyamines, acetylates spermine and spermidine and
  the mono-acetylated spermidine/spermine are either degraded by N1-acetylpolyamine
  oxidase or exported from the cell. The SSAT level is very low under normal conditions
  and is rapidly induced by a variety of stimuli such as hormones and growth factors,
  toxic compounds, polyamines and polyamine analogs, certain drugs and pathophysiological
  conditions ().
