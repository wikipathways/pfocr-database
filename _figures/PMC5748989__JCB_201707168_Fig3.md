caption: Regulation of energy homeostasis, reproductive processes, and somatic growth
  or maintenance by signaling pathways that perceive and respond to nutrient availability.
  (A) Nutrient abundance leads to increased insulin/IGF-1 and mTORC1 signaling, which
  collectively promote cellular processes that support energy storage or expenditure,
  increased reproduction, and growth. (B) Nutrient depletion leads to increased AMPK
  signaling and transcriptional activity of FoxO transcription factors, which promote
  protective cellular processes that support energy production or conservation, maintenance
  of reproductive function rather than progeny production, and lifespan extension.
  This simplified model does not account for macronutrient-specific responses or tissue-specific
  nutrient detection, and it does not distinguish between different tissues when summarizing
  downstream signaling effects. Black arrows indicate increased stimulation of a signaling
  pathway in response to the environmental conditions, and gray dotted arrows indicate
  little or no stimulation of a signaling pathway under the environmental conditions.
  Large text or arrows indicate relatively high levels of signaling compared with
  small text or arrows; blue indicates up-regulation or promotion, and red indicates
  down-regulation or suppression.
