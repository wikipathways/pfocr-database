caption: 'A, The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is tightly regulated by multiple feedback loops
  (dashed lines) to control growth factor signaling. B, Aberrant RTK signaling in
  tumor cells can override this regulation and addition of mTOR inhibitors C, can
  further increase activation of AKT. This occurs through multiple mechanisms including
  de-repression of the negative feedback loops whereby S6K induces degradation of
  IRS-1/2 (uncoupling RTK signaling to PI3K) and S6K inhibits the mTORC2 complex.
  D, We report that rapalog-induced activation of AKT can be blocked with the dual
  Src/c-Abl inhibitor, dasatinib; however the specific SFK(s) and directed downstream
  targets are unknown. As both Src kinase and mTOR pathway activity are found to be
  increased in breast cancer, these findings suggest pathway convergence that promotes
  tumor viability. This novel convergence reveals a potential vulnerability and supports
  the use of combinatorial agents that act downstream of RTKs. Abbreviations: RTKs,
  receptor tyrosine kinases; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; S6K,
  ribosomal S6 kinase; IRS-1/2, insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS-1/2); mTORC2,
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2.'
