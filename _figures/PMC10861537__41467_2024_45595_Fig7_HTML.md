caption: HGSOC TME is heterogeneous and composed of different CAF subsets, including
  the FAP+ CAF-S1 and FAP- CAF-S4 myofibroblastic populations. Chemotherapy globally
  increases the stromal content, but reduces the proportions of both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4
  myofibroblasts. The combination of several high-throughput technologies shows that,
  among the CAF-S1 population, the content in the ANTXR1+ ECM-myCAF cluster decreases
  the most following chemotherapy, while the proportion of the ANTXR1- detox-iCAF
  cluster increases. Concomitantly, chemotherapy increases CD8+ T lymphocyte density.
  Indeed, ECM-myCAF reduce CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity through the YAP1 signaling pathway,
  thereby explaining that the more the content in ECM-myCAF decrases after chemotherapy,
  the more CD8+ T cell infiltrate the tumor upon treatment. Figure 7 was created with
