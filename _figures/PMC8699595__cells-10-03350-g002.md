caption: Abscission checkpoint pathways in higher eukaryotic cells. (a) Active Aurora
  B localizes inside the midbody center to delay abscission in late midbodies. (b)
  Abscission checkpoint signaling in normally segregating cells or cytokinesis with
  chromatin bridges. Signaling pathways that promote localization of the chromosomal
  passenger complex (CPC) inside the midbody center are shown in green background,
  a pathway of Aurora B activation at the midbody center is shown in pink, and signaling
  pathways that implement the abscission checkpoint downstream of Aurora B are in
  yellow background. p, phosphorylation. Unknown molecular events are indicated by
  question marks.
