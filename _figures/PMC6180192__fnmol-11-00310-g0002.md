caption: A Schematic diagram of crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria
  resulting from prion fibrils accumulation within the brain. (A) Prion fibrils are
  accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (a major calcium storing organelle), and
  it activates ER stress. Dysregulated calcium will result in increased calcium flux
  in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Opening of the inositol receptors (IP3R)
  and ryanodine receptors (RyR) are located on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum
  as a result of dysregulated calcium levels. (B) Escape of calcium from the endoplasmic
  reticulum will result in the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria crosstalk, and
  unfolded protein response within the endoplasmic reticulum is triggered to restore
  the normal functions. (C) When the stress goes beyond the tolerable level, the reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) are produced within the mitochondria and the adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) producing capacity is hampered. ROS will result in mitochondrial DNA mutation.
  Respiratory chain complex abnormalities will result in further production of ROS
  and decrease the ATP levels. Finally, the membrane dimerization and drop in membrane
  potential will result in the initiation of apoptosis and cell death.
