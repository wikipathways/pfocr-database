caption: Representation of the molecular interaction pathway analysis of the associated
  and causal genes linked to aneuploidy. Purple coloured molecules indicate the copy
  number variation overlapping genes identified in the study. Breast cancer gene 1
  (BRCA1), amyloid protein precursor (APP) formed major hubs, interacting with other
  CNV- NDJ genes involved in meiotic recombination and DNA repair and hence are indicated
  in red colour. Paths between genes represent protein-protein interactions, regulation
  and phosphorylation activities. This complex network analysis was performed using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa).
