caption: (A) Network of all identified proteins associated with mTOR pathway in our
  dataset. (B) Network of differentially expressed proteins in mTOR pathway. Red nodes
  represent up-regulated proteins and blue nodes represent down-regulated ones. Width
  of edges and data represent the interaction confidence score. (C) Diseases associated
  with differentially expressed proteins in mTOR pathway based on enrichment analysis
  in Web Gestalt. (D) KEGG analysis identified signaling pathways associated mTOR
  pathway proteins differentially expressed in T-R cells.
