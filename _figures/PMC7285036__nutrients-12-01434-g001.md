caption: 'The host–microbial metabolites interplay in health and chronic inflammatory
  disorders. Gut microbes produce metabolites that act either at local tissue or remotely
  in the liver and pancreas (A). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), damage to intestinal
  permeability is associated with changes in microbiota composition (dysbiosis). Consequently,
  this disrupts the homeostasis of microbial-derived metabolites, leading to increased
  inflammatory potential locally and systematically (B). Ultimately, protective metabolites
  (SCFA, SBA and indoles) are decreased, whereas pre-disorder metabolites such as
  BCAA are increased. This further disrupts the energy metabolism by impairing the
  insulin signaling pathway and accumulating fat droplets in the liver, as a result
  of developing hepatic (NAFLD) and pancreatic disorders (AP, T1D and T2D). The production
  of two energy regulating hormones, GLP-1 and PYY, is triggered by the secretion
  of SCFA (butyrate). With decreased SCFA in disease state, production of GLP-1 and
  PYY is also limited, therefore worsening the disrupted energy metabolism. AP: acute
  pancreatitis; BA: bile acid; BCAA: branched-chain amino acid; GLP-1: glucagon-like
  peptide 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  PYY: peptide YY; SBA: secondary bile acid; SCFA: short-chain fatty acids; T1D: type
  1 diabetes; T2D: type 2 diabetes.'
