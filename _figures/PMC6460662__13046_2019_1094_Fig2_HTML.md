caption: Mechanism of action of anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs. Due to activation of VEGF signaling
  pathways in various cancers, several anti-cancer drugs have been developed to target
  the VEGF pathway. Aflibercept is a peptide-antibody directed at PIGF and VEGFA,
  while bevacizumab is a mAb specific for VEGFA. Ramucirumab is a mAb that targets
  the VEGFA receptor (VEGFR2). On the other hand, sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  for VEGFR, primarily VEGFR2. Each of these drugs prevent oncogenic signaling by
  VEGF overexpression
