caption: (A) Following TNF binding to the TNFR, the adaptor proteins TRADD, TRAF2,
  and RIP are recruited to the receptor. RIP mediates activation of the IKK complex
  through ubiquitin-dependent interaction with NEMO. (CYLD and A20 are deubiquitiases
  that can remove K63 ubiqutin from the indicated proteins to arrest NF-κB activation.)
  (B) Binding of LPS or IL-1 results in receptor dimerization and recruitment of the
  adaptor proteins TRIF, MyD88 and TIRAP. This receptor complex then recruits IRAK1,
  which becomes activated by IRAK4. Activated IRAK1 leaves the receptor complex and
  binds TRAF6. TAB2 then mediates interaction of activated TRAF6 with the TAK1/TAB1
  complex. TAK1 activates the IKK complex by phosphorylation of IKKβ. (C) Activated
  IKK phosphorylates IκBα or IκBβ, which leads to their degradation and thus nuclear
  localization of NF-κB transcription factor dimers. In the alternative NF-κB pathway
  (not depicted), activated IKKα phosphorylates p100 (or p105), targeting it for processing
  by the proteasome into the mature p52 (or p50) protein. Dimers containing these
  processed p52 or p50 proteins can then enter the nucleus. Shown in green are NF-κB
  signaling components that can be alternatively spliced to enhance NF-κB signaling;
  in red are those where alterative splicing can inhibit the NF-κB response; ones
  in green and red have both inhibitory and activating splice variants; in white are
  NF-κB signaling proteins where alternative splicing is not yet known to affect the
  NF-κB response. Arrows indicate activating steps; double-sided arrows indicate reversible
  interactions; and bars (as with CYLD and A20) indicate inhibitory effects.
