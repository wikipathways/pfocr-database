caption: In response to various stimuli such as infection or injury, mucosal epithelial
  barriers express a range of signals that ILC2s can integrate. The most studied and
  thought to be of utmost importance pathway of activation of ILC2 is formed by the
  “alarmins,” IL-33, TSLP, and IL-25 that cause release of the canonical IL-13, IL-5,
  and amphiregulin cytokines expression. Upon damage, necrotic epithelial cells can
  release IL-33 while apoptotic epithelial cells, can release ATP, that further activates
  mast cells to release IL-33. Alternatively, epithelial cells can release TSLP or
  the newly identified and specialized chemosensory epithelial cells, namely tuft
  cells, can release IL-25. Recently mucosal sensory nervous system has been shown
  to detect helminths and protists and release in response Neuromedin (Nmu) or vasoactive
  intestinal polypeptide (VIP) that can both activates by themselves ILC2s or synergise
  with alarmins to potentiate ILC2 response. Finally, some cytokines and lipid mediators
  have emerged as potential controllers of ILC2s, with the prostaglandin PGI2 and
  the lipoxin LXA4 limiting ILC2 cytokines release, while the prostaglandin PGD2 and
  the leukotriene LTD4 can potentiate the same cytokine expression. The regulatory
  IL-27 cytokines as well as Interferon (IFN)g can dampen ILC2 activation.
