caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for Jab1/COPS5 regulation network in cancer.
  Jab1/COPS5 is a multiple protein and plays an essential role in tumorigenesis. In
  this case we showed the predicted expression level of other genes in the regulation
  network in response to increased measured level of let-7 based on the IPA database.
  The color of each gene represents the corresponding expression level. Light-red
  means activation and light-blue means inhibition, while red means increased measurement
  and green means decreased measurement.
