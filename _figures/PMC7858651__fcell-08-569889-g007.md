caption: 'Model of the functional effect of RGS8 in SCA14. Left panel: mGluR1-PKCγ
  signaling pathway in the normal situation. mGluR1 activation via Gαq activates phosphoinositide
  phospholipase C (PLC) to produce inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). IP3 binds to the IP3 receptor and calcium ions (Ca2+) are released from the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The combination of DAG and Ca2+ activates PKCγ and induces
  the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. RGS8 is involved in the regulation
  of mGluR1 signaling. Right panel: In the SCA14 PKCγ(S361G) mutant with constitutively
  active kinase domain, the phosphorylation of PKC substrates is enhanced. PKCγ(S361G)
  can directly interact with mGluR1 (orange arrow) which may further promote mGluR1-PKCγ
  signaling. Increased expression of RGS8 may be a protective reaction for dysregulated
  mGluR1 signaling (red circle) and limits the mGluR1-PKCγ pathway activation in SCA14
  PKCγ(S361G). Dysregulated RGS8 has been reported in several SCAs implicating dysregulation
  of the mGluR1 pathway within the pathogenesis of SCAs.'
