caption: UPR signaling schematic. The UPR signaling pathway is an adaptive endoplasmic
  reticulum response. GRP78 unbinds from the three signaling arms (IRE1, PERK, ATF6)
  upon sensing the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic
  reticulum. PERK is a type I transmembrane protein that phosphorylates the eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit (eIF2α). Induction of ATF4 regulates the
  expression of several genes, including the pro-apoptotic DNA damage-inducible transcript
  3 (DDIT3; referred to as CHOP) and antioxidant signaling responses. ATF6 is a type-II
  transmembrane bZIP transcription factor in which Golgi localization signals are
  blocked by GRP78 binding. Dissociation of GRP78 from ATF6 results in translocation
  of ATF6 to the Golgi complex, and cleavage of ATF6 by the site-1 (SP1) and -2 proteases
  (SP2) to form its active p50 form. Several downstream targets of ATF6 include GRP78,
  GRP94, and GRP58. Activation of IRE1α enables the unconventional splicing of XBP1.
  Various downstream targets of XBP1(S) include p58IPK, ERAD signaling components,
  and several protein chaperones.
