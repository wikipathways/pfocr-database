caption: Schematic diagram depicting the possible molecular mechanisms by which mitoQ
  prevents renal tubular cell injury by maintaining mitochondrial integrity under
  HG conditions. Under HG conditions, nuclear Nrf2 expression and activity are down-regulated
  in tubular cells, which decreases PINK1 transcription and subsequent Parkin phosphorylations
  and then leads to defective mitophagy. This insufficient mitophagy results in ROS
  overproduction and aberrant mitochondrial dynamics characterized by Drp1 activation
  and Mfn2 suppression, changes accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, fragmented
  mitochondria accumulation and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation, i.e.,
  caspase 3 release, which eventually leads to cell apoptosis. Interestingly, mitoQ
  treatment increases the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1, and the nuclear location
  of the former up-regulates the transcription of PINK and restores mitophagy, which
  maintains mitochondrial quality control, thereby attenuating hyperglycemia-induced
  tubular injury and apoptosis.
