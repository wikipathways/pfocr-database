caption: Inherited predisposition to nerve sheath neoplasia involves germline mutations
  in key tumor suppressor genes. In NF1, neurofibromin loss leads to constitutive
  MEK/ERK pathway activation. NF2 is associated with Merlin loss, a tumor suppressor
  with multiple complex effects, regulating RAC, PI3K and receptor tyrosine kinases
  (including PDGFR). Less is currently known about the genetic basis of schwannomatosis,
  which is sporadic in most cases. Germline mutations in the SMARCB1 gene, encoding
  a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, are present in approximately
  one third of familial cases and 10% of sporadic ones. Carney complex frequently
  results from mutations in the PRKAR1A gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of
  protein kinase A. Conversely, MEN2b, caused by activating mutations in the RET oncogene,
  does not result in true neoplasms in the peripheral nerve, but rather hamartomatous
  growths.
