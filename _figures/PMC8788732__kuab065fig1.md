caption: 'An overview of biosynthetic pathways for monoterpenoids. Each monoterpenoid
  is derived from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
  There are three pathways to synthesize IPP and DMAPP: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway,
  the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, and the isopentenol pathway. DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; AcCoA, acetyl CoA; AcAcCoA, acetoacetyl CoA; HMG-CoA,
  β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA; MVAPP, mevalonate 5-diphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; HMBPP, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl
  diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate.'
