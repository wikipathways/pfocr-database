caption: FGFR signaling pathway regulation. FGFR signaling is negatively regulated,
  partly by CBL (inducing FGFR degradation after receptor internalization), by SEF,
  SPRY, MKP1, and MPK3 (which negatively regulate proliferation and survival related
  pathways). FGFRs can also regulate their own activation due to the autoinhibitory
  function of Ig-I. Image created with biorender.com.
