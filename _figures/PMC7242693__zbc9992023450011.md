caption: Synthesis of bacteriochlorophylls a, g, and b from divinyl-protochlorophyllide
  a. There are two types of Chlide a oxidoreductases. The type found in R. sphaeroides
  and most other anoxygenic phototrophs converts Chlide a into 3-vinyl BChlide a.
  However, organisms such as Heliobacterium modesticaldum (Hm) that produce BChl gF
  or Blastochloris viridis that produce BChl b have an enzyme that converts 3,8-divinyl
  Chlide into BChlide g, which has an ethylidene side chain at the C8 position. BChl
  a and b are usually esterified with phytol by the BChl synthases (BchG) that occur
  in those organisms. However, BChl g is esterified with farnesol by the Bchl g synthases
  that occur in heliobacteria. Note that divinyl PChlide is also the precursor for
  the synthesis of the family of pigments known as Chl c. For additional details,
  see section “Extension of the pathway beyond Chlide a/Chl a.” The shaded boxes surrounding
  the names of some compounds coordinate with other pathway figures and the summary
  in .
