caption: Summary of FGF effects in breast cancer cells. The Fibroblast Growth Factor
  (FGF) ligands are produced by a variety of cells including adipocytes, cancer associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs), and breast cancer cells. FGFs bind to FGF receptors, inducing
  receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation of its intracellular kinase domain.
  The FGFR signaling network activates downstream signal transduction pathways such
  as the RAS/MAPK pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, PLCγ pathway, and JAK/STAT pathways.
  The downstream effects of these pathways include an increase in cell proliferation,
  migration, angiogenesis, and survival. Downstream-activated effector molecules of
  FGFR signaling can also activate the estrogen receptor in a ligand-independent manner
  which is implicated in endocrine therapy resistance.
