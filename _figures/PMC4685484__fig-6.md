caption: HMGB1-RAGE binding and downstream activation. The signaling pathway of RAGE
  involves the key adaptor proteins, MyD88 and TIRAP, which it shares in common with
  TLR4 signaling. All-thiol HMGB1 also serves to signal an increase in chemotactic
  activity. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version
