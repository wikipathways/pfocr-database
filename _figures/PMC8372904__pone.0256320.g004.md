caption: In ATLL cells, p47 is degraded by the autophagy-lysosome pathway, leading
  to increased NEMO protein level and activation of IKK, which result in the constitutive
  activation of the NF-κB pathways. CQ and HCQ inhibit autophagy and increase p47
  protein level, which inhibit NF-κB pathway activation along with loss of CADM1 expression,
  leading to caspase-3 related apoptosis.
