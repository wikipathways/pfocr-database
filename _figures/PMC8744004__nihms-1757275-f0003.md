caption: '‘First step’ - Fructose: Fructose influx into the liver induces immediate
  changes in the lipid metabolism. This causes an increase in uric acid due to the
  degradation AMP via the purine degradation pathway, an increase in apoCIII expression
  via ChREBP and an increase in de novo lipogenesis, through an increase in substrate
  and the action of transcription factors (ChREBP and SREBP). These processes lead
  to an increase in postprandial triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL). Hydrolysis
  of the triglyceride via lipoprotein lipase converts TRL into intermediate density
  lipoprotein and then LDL particles.‘Second step’ - Glucose: Postprandial glucose
  levels lead to non-enzymatic glycation of LDL particles and interfere with the clearance
  of these particles. Further, plasma glucose aids in the oxidation of LDL particles
  with results in oxidized LDL particles.LDL-R – LDL receptor; KHK – ketohexokinase;
  TG – triglycerides; TRL – TG-rich lipoprotein'
