caption: Humoral innate immune signaling pathways. (A) Represents a schematic diagram
  of the Toll pathway. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi recognized by pathogen recognition
  receptors (PRRs) trigger the activation of this pathway. Modular serine protease
  (MSP) and spätzle-processing enzyme (SPE), which are regulated by several PRRs are
  thought to process the cleavage of the spätzle ligand into a mature spätzle that
  binds to the Toll receptor, initiating downstream signaling pathway that culminates
  in the translocation of the NFB-like transcription factors Dif and/or Dorsal into
  the nucleus, promoting the expression to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response
  to infection. Serpin (Spn) tightly regulates the primary steps of this pathway to
  avoid exaggerated immunity. (B) Represents a schematic diagram of the IMD pathway.
  Gram-negative bacteria recognized by receptors of the IMD pathways like the peptidoglycan
  recognition protein-LC (PGRP-LC) trigger the pathway activation, promoting the formation
  of the IMD, FADD, and Dredd (caspase 8 homolog) complex. This in turn activates
  Dredd, which is thought to be involved in the cleavage of the NFB-like transcription
  factors Relish (Rel). This formed complex also activates Tak1 (MAP3 kinase) and
  the IKK complex (IRD5 and key) to phosphorylate Rel. Once translocated into the
  nucleus, Rel promotes the expression to AMPs in response to invading pathogens.
  (C) Represents a schematic diagram of the JAK/STAT pathway. The UPD ligand binds
  to the DOME receptor leading to its activation. The phosphorylation of JAK and DOME
  create docking puts for STATs recruited to the formed complex. STATs themselves
  become phosphorylated generating an active dimer that translocates to the nucleus,
  promoting effector gene expression.
