caption: Francisella is recognized on the host cell surface by TLR2. The signal is
  transmitted through the adaptor protein MyD88. Subsequently MAPKs, PI3K and Akt
  are activated, which leads to enhanced NFκB activity, inflammatory cytokine production,
  and effective host response. SHIP negatively regulates the activation of Akt to
  prevent effective host response. During Francisella infection miR-155 is induced
  through the TLR signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt, ERK, JNK, and NFκB. MiR-155 induction
  in turn down-regulates SHIP to promote the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and
  inflammatory cytokine production. The highly virulent F. tularensis suppresses or
  subverts the induction of miR-155 in human monocytes, while the relatively avirulent
  F. novicida does not.
