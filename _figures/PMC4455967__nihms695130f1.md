caption: Degradation of ceramide to sphingosine by ceramidase and subsequent phosphorylation
  by sphingosine kinase 1 or sphingosine kinase 2 produces S1P. S1P can be reversibly
  degraded to sphingosine by S1P phosphatase and lipid phosphate phosphatases or irreversibly
  degraded by S1P lyase to 2-trans hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine,. Notably,
  FTY720 and some of its analogues are preferentially phosphorylated by sphingosine
  kinase 2 (REF. ) and were shown to be degraded by lipid phosphate phosphatase 3
  in vitro.
