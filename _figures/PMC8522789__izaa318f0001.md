caption: Figure shows the interaction between different cytokines and JAK pairings
  and resultant physiologic effects in both healthy and disease states. Normal cytokine
  signaling through JAK pairs is essential for bodily functions such as providing
  immunity against pathogens and hematopoiesis. In inflammatory bowel disease, an
  exaggerated immune response leads to excessive signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway,
  resulting in overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and a cycle of chronic,
  relapsing gastrointestinal inflammation and potential damage.
