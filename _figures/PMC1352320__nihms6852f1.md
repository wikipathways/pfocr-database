caption: 'Soluble phospholipid precursors: (G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; I-3-P, inositol-3-phosphate;
  C-P, choline phosphate; CDP-C, cytidinediphosphate choline). Phospholipids: (PA,
  phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol; CDP-DAG, cytidinediphosphate diacylglycerol;
  PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PMME, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine; PDME, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine). Arrows represent routes of metabolic conversion. The names
  of the structural genes for enzymes catalyzing specific metabolic conversions are
  shown adjacent to the arrows. Genes that were shown in the present study to be repressed
  in the presence of inositol and choline ( and ) are underlined. Values indicate
  the fold level of repression in response to the combination of inositol and choline
  was well as the standard deviation in the level of expression (−/+) for indicated
  genes. The positions at which inositol and choline enter the metabolic pathway are
  boxed.'
