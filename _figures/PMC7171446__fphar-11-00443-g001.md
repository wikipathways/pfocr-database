caption: 'KIT activation in normal mast cells: Under normal conditions, soluble SCF
  binds to KIT leading to receptor dimerization and kinase domain activation, which
  induces the initiation of a cascade of multimolecular phosphorylation events involving
  a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways such as the phosphatydylinositol
  triphosphate kinase (PI3K) pathway, the Janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducers
  and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, and the rat sarcoma (Ras)/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway (; ; ), among others. In parallel with the
  complex process underlying KIT activation, strict regulatory mechanisms including
  the monoubiquitination of KIT that occurs after KIT/SCF binding and the action of
  inhibitory molecules such as SHP-1, PKC, or SOCS-1 play an important role in hampering
  exaggerated and potentially harmful activation states of the receptor. Information
  about the targets of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors showing activity is illustrated.
