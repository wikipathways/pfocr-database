caption: 'We present a model of how pol II (L1 and mRNA) and pol III transcript interactions
  with their respective cellular components in the cytoplasm may influence the retrotransposition
  timing of LINEs and SINEs. Structures are not drawn to scale. Transcription and
  processing are not the limiting steps for L1 and Alu, as both pol II and pol III
  spliced tagged transcripts are present in the cytoplasm as early as 3 h post-transfection.
  However, Alu requires about 24 h to generate an insert, while L1 requires about
  48 h (*). Pol II transcript: LINE RNA and pol II-driven mRNAs reach the cytoplasm
  after processing and modifications. The cytoplasmic pol II transcript has been spliced,
  polyadenylated and capped at its 5′ end (shown as a black dot at the end of the
  RNA). The cap allows the recognition by several proteins involved in translation
  forming a large protein complex interacting with the transcript. Capping also allows
  for the association with the PABP-1, elongation factors and the circularization
  of the mRNA (not shown). This large multi-protein complex interacts with the translation
  machinery to generate the needed ORF1 and ORF2 proteins. The generated proteins
  will preferentially bind to the L1 RNA that encoded them (cis-preference). Multiple
  ORF1p molecules (yellow circles) and possibly ORF2p (red circle) bind the L1 transcript.
  We propose that the formation of the L1 RNP complex will allow the L1 RNA to separate
  from the translation machinery and evade the normal degradation pathway en route
  to the nucleus. This process of detachment from the ribosomal complex and avoidance
  of the RNA decay pathways may increase the time requirement for L1 retrotransposition.
  These extra steps probably contribute to the extended time requirement for L1 to
  complete the retrotransposition process. The L1 RNA (likely as an RNP with ORF1
  and ORF2) reaches the nucleus and generates a new insert (represented as a white
  box in the DNA). In our assay system, the insertion process of L1 elements requires
  about 48 hours for completion. Cellular RNAs (e.g., mRNAs and the pol II Alu RNA)
  can occasionally use the L1 proteins to mediate their mobility in trans. However,
  retropseudogene (pol II mRNA) inserts are not efficiently generated in our experimental
  system and require ORF1p. We propose that the spurious interaction with ORF1p allows
  these mRNAs to be shunted to the nucleus to go through the retrotransposition process.
  In addition, it is likely that ORF1p also contributes to the retrotransposition
  process in the nucleus. The ORF1mneo transcript generates inserts more efficiently
  than the other tested pol II transcripts, possibly because of close proximity to
  ORF1p in cis. Overall, the efficiency of a pol II transcript to generate inserts
  in tissue culture is likely correlated with its ability to interact with ORF1p.
  The role of ORF2p in the cytoplasm is unclear. Pol III transcript: SINE RNA reaches
  the cytoplasm with little or no processing and interacts with specific proteins.
  The cytoplasmic SINE RNP is stable and compact. In the case of Alu, the transcript
  forms a specific structure which binds the SRP9 (green circle) and SRP14 (blue circle)
  proteins. It is hypothesized that these proteins may target SINE RNA to the ribosomes,
  generating transient close proximity to nascent L1 proteins that might be essential
  for SINEs to efficiently use L1 in trans for retrotransposition. Although SINE RNPs
  may be targeted to the ribosomes, they are not functional components of the translational
  complex, making this interaction likely transitory. Whether pol III RNA gains access
  to the L1 retrotransposition machinery in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus remains
  undetermined. Because SINE transcripts are not translated or functional components
  of the translational complex, the SINE RNPs are likely “free” to sequester the L1
  proteins and immediately proceed with the retrotransposition cycle. We propose that
  the pol III SINE probably reaches the nucleus in a more efficient manner than the
  pol II transcripts, such as the L1 RNA, which must first dissociate from the translational
  complex and avoid the normal mRNA degradation pathway. In our system, the insertion
  process of an Alu requires 24 hours or less for completion (* represented as a white
  box in the DNA).'
