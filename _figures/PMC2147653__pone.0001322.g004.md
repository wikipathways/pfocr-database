caption: Nested ANOVAs were utilized on microarray data to test for altered expression
  of the major sulfur utilization biosynthetic pathways as described. The pathways
  linking one major metabolite to another with statistically significant altered expression
  are shown as colored arrows. Red shows that the 35S:MYB lines led to increased transcript
  levels for the biosynthetic pathway in comparison to wild-type, while blue shows
  decreased transcript levels. Dark color represents a change of 50 percent or more
  while the lighter color shows a change of less than 50 percent. The genes used for
  each pathway are as listed in . MYB28 illustrates the comparison of transcript levels
  in 35S:MYB28 lines versus Col-0. MYB29 illustrates the comparison of transcript
  levels in 35S:MYB29 lines versus Col-0. MYB76 illustrates the comparison transcript
  levels in 35S:MYB76 lines versus Col-0.
