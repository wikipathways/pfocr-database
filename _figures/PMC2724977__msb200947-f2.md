caption: Comparison of ERK signalling as found in the EGFR map and in Reactome. In
  Reactome, ERK1 or ERK2 are phosphorylated by MKK1 or MKK2, respectively. The same
  reaction is found in the EGFR map, but here ERK1 and ERK2 are represented as a single
  entity, namely ERK1/2, which combines both proteins and can be phosphorylated by
  MKK1 and MKK2. In Reactome, dimerization and translocation to the nucleus are still
  separately described for each entity. Then, the representation switches from separate
  entities to one combined entity. In addition, the dissociation of MKK1 or MKK2,
  which is needed before the dimerization of ERK can take place, is not described
  in Reactome. Manual intervention is needed to correctly map both representations.
