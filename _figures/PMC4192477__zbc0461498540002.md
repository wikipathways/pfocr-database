caption: Numerous proteins that interact with core components of the NOD2 and MAPK
  signaling pathways were identified as regulators of IL-8 secretion. Positive (red)
  or negative (blue) regulators of IL-8 secretion known to interact with core components
  of the NOD2 signaling pathway, as determined using STRING and/or BIOGRID PPI databases,
  are shown. NOD2, RIPK2, RELA, and the indicated MAPKs were selected as core components
  and are highlighted by large circles. Gray shading indicates genes whose knockdown
  did not significantly affect IL-8 protein levels. The knockdown of underlined genes
  affected both IL-8 secretion and NF-κB activation. Genes in boldface type were validated
  using independent siRNA pools. Normalized IL-8 data is included in supplemental
  Fig. S6.
