caption: The canonical pathway from the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) to aquaporin-2
  (AQP2) upregulation to induce drug-induced hyponatremia. Drugs that can cause hyponatremia
  bind to the V2R at basolateral membranes of collecting ducts and stimulate adenylyl
  cyclase activity, resulting in increased cAMP production. The cAMP/PKA signaling
  also induces enhanced AQP2 targeting to the apical membrane and increased AQP2 transcription
  probably through CREB phosphorylation.
