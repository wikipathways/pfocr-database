caption: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair by homologous recombination (HR) and
  key molecules (MRN complex, ATM, CHK2, BRCA1, PALB2, BARD1, BRIP1, BRCA2, RAD51,
  RAD51C, and RAD51D). Part 1 (overall HR pathway against DSBs). In response to DSBs
  or stalled replication fork (not shown), the initial step for HR is the sensing
  of damaged sites by the MRN complex, which is comprised of MRE11, RAD50, and Nijmegen
  breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1 or, alternatively, NBN), followed by the resection
  procedure. Either side of DNA is lysed from 5′ to 3′ by MRE11 (shown like “PAC-MAN”
  in this figure) with its exonuclease and endonuclease activities and BRCA1 enzymatic
  activities, forming an overhanging 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) end which can
  invade homologous template. RAD51 is recruited by the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 effector
  complex and is loaded on ssDNA to form RAD51–ssDNA nucleofilament. Recombinase RAD51
  synthesizes DNA using sister chromatids as a template, extending to the second DNA
  end, which is terminated by D-loop capture (not shown), and forms a double Holliday
  junction (not shown), resulting in non-crossover or crossover outcomes via resolution.
  Parts 2–4 (magnified view of BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex and molecular associates).
  In response to DSBs, a serine/threonine kinase ATM, another sensor molecule of DSBs,
  is recruited with checkpoint activation and phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase
  2 (CHK2) to recruit the BRCA complex (Part 2). BRCA1 (1863 amino acids (a.a.)) is
  phosphorylated by ATM or ATR (ATR works when stalled replication fork occurs) at
  several motifs containing serine residues. Another serine residue (S988), located
  in the center of BRCA1, is phosphorylated by CHK2. Phosphorylated BRCA1 is recruited
  and accumulated at the damaged sites. BRCA1 functions as an adaptor for BRCA2 recruitment
  through the linking mediator of PALB2. BRCA1 functions by forming a heterodimeric
  complex with BARD1 via the RING finger domain at the N-terminus of BRCA1 and with
  BRIP1 through two BRCT domains at the carboxyl-terminus of BRCA1. PALB2 binds to
  BRCA1 at the coiled-coil domain via the N-terminal residue of PALB2 (Part 3). The
  N-terminus of BRCA2 interacts with PALB2 through its carboxyl terminus. BRCA2 (3418
  amino acids (a.a.)) contains eight conserved motifs called BRC repeats in the middle
  part encoded by exon 11 to which RAD51s are bound. The carboxyl-terminus of BRCA2
  contains a TR2 domain, another binding site for RAD51. BRCA2 serine 3291 (S3,291)
  phosphorylation, which is required for binding of RAD51 to BRCA2, is regulated by
  cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). RAD51 paralog complexes (RAD51B–RAD51C–RAD51D-XRCC2
  (BCDX2) and RAD51C–XRCC3 (CX3)) interact with RAD51 under the regulation of the
  BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 complex and may promote RAD51 nucleofilament formation (Part 4).
