caption: Fig. 8. Proposed model for the development of the mammalian lymphatic vasculature.
  Upon the formation of the vascular system, LYVE-1 starts to be expressed in venous
  endothelial cells (EC) in the cardinal vein at approximately E9.5–E10.0. Probably
  at around this stage this tissue becomes competent to respond to a specific lymphatic
  inductive signal [(A), lymphatic competence]. Almost at the same time and following
  its polarized induction by some as yet unknown short-range signaling molecule, Prox1
  starts to be expressed in a restricted subpopulation of endothelial cells in the
  cardinal vein. Initially, all endothelial cells in the veins are probably bipotent
  and it is upon the expression of at least Prox1 that some of those cells become
  biased (committed) to initiate the lymphatic differentiation program. Expression
  of these two markers is one of the first indications that lymphangiogenesis has
  been initiated [(B), lymphatic bias]. As development proceeds, this subpopulation
  of LYVE-1- and Prox1-positive endothelial cells starts to bud from the veins in
  a Prox1-independent manner. At this stage, VEGFR-3 expression still remains almost
  equally high in both vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. However, maintenance
  of the budding and migration requires Prox1 activity and a feedback signaling mechanism.
  As the cells bud in a polarized manner, they start to express additional lymphatic
  endothelial markers. At around E11.5, SLC expression is first detected and, while
  the VEGFR-3 expression level remains high in budding lymphatic endothelial cells,
  it weakens in blood vascular endothelial cells. The expression of these four lymphatic
  markers may indicate that this process becomes specified irreversibly toward the
  lymphatic pathway [(C), lymphatic specification]. Our results suggest that this
  step is also dependent on Prox1 activity and on the feedback signaling mechanism
  required for the maintenance and polarized budding of these lymphatic endothelial
  cells. In Prox1-null embryos, endothelial cell budding becomes arrested at around
  E11.5–E12.0 due to the lack of Prox1 function, and random budding occurs because
  the feedback loop signaling mechanism is interrupted. As a result, the budding cells
  still detected in E11.5–E12.0 Prox1-null embryos do not express any of the lymphatic
  markers (LYVE-1, Prox1, SLC or VEGFR-3), but instead they express high levels of
  vascular markers (laminin and CD34). As a result, lymphatic bias, and therefore
  lymphatic specification, are never accomplished, and a default blood vascular identity
  is acquired instead.
