caption: Clusterin as a critical signaling node. A, Candidate genes identified by
  DNA microarray were analyzed with the Ingenuity software tool to construct an objective
  signaling network. Up-regulated genes in the PE-treated rats are shown in red; down-regulated
  genes are depicted in green. B and C, Analysis of the network demonstrates a link
  between clusterin and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Components of the network are
  listed in B with fold change compared with control. Regulatory network showing potential
  interactions between molecules is shown in C.
