caption: Schematic model of the binding dynamics of Aip with R1α and Cα in somatotrophs
  of different mouse models, contributing to GH secretion and somatotropinoma formation.
  (A) In the wild-type mouse, the inactive cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme
  separates into its subunits upon PKA pathway activation, where the active catalytic
  subunit Cα exerts its downstream effects. Aip can bind the holoenzyme as well as
  the unbound catalytic and regulatory (R1α) subunits, probably with different affinities.
  (B) During lower Aip levels, e.g. in the Aip+/− mouse, Aip binding to unbound Cα
  may be reduced thereby freeing Cα for an increased activation of downstream targets,
  leading to more PKA pathway activation, increased GH secretion and somatotroph tumor
  formation. (C) In the double heterozygous Aip+/−, Prkar1a+/− mouse, Aip that was
  previously bound to unbound R1α may now be free to bind to Cα, thereby inhibiting
  its catalytic activity and reducing GH secretion.
