caption: 'The phosphopeptide motif located adjacent to the XRCC1 BRCT2 domain supports
  interaction with the APLF NHEJ scaffold, but the functional significance of this
  interaction remains unclear. From the perspective of SSBR, APLF adds additional
  recruitment capabilities provided by the PAR-binding Zn finger (PBZ) and histone
  chaperone domains (HCD) that may support additional damage recruitment capabilities
  beyond those provided by the XRCC1 BRCT1-PAR interaction. Such interactions could
  support recruitment of XRCC1/LIG3 to specific although as yet undetermined types
  of SSB. From the perspective of NHEJ, problems encountered at the final ligation
  step might be resolved by replacement of XRCC4-LIG4 with XRCC1-LIG3, which supports
  more challenging ligations that might arise. This interaction also may support the
  lower fidelity alt-NHEJ pathway if APLF is involved in alt-NHEJ, however such involvement
  has not been demonstrated and information about this pathway is currently limited.
  Other abbreviations: FHA, forkhead-associated domain; PBB – the XRCC1 N-terminal
  pol β-binding domain.'
