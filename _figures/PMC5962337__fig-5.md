caption: Mn homeostasis and toxicity. (a) Mn can be transported via Tf and DMT1, as
  well as via Zn carriers, ion channels, and shuttle systems. (b) Mn is detoxified
  by Fpn at the plasma membrane or by its sequestration in the secretory system via
  the ZnT1 transporter or the Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPases SPCA1/2. ATP13A2 mediates sequestration
  of Mn in lysosomes. (c) Mn enhances ROS generation via Mn-catalyzed autoxidation
  of DA that involves the redox cycling of Mn2+ and Mn3+ and the generation of ROS
  and DA-o-quinones. (d) Mn accumulates in the mitochondria via the MCU and increases
  the accumulation of labile Fe. (e) Mn-induced neurotoxicity is linked to oxidative
  damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and also to a decrease in Glu uptake by the
  EAATs in astrocytes (arrow in EAAT indicates reversal of Glu transport) leading
  to excitotoxicity in neurons, as well as the induction of inflammation. DA, dopamine;
  EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; Glu, glutamate; MCU, mitochondrial Ca2+
  uniporter; Mn, manganese; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SPCA, secretory pathway
  Ca2+ ATPase; ZnT, zinc transporter.
