caption: m6A methylation plays a critical role in adaptive immunity. (A) m6A modification
  can promote the CD4+ T helper cells proliferation and differentiation by decaying
  SOCS mRNAs and consequently activating IL-7-STAT5 pathway. (B) m6A methylation plays
  an essential role in sustaining the suppressive functions of CD4+ T Regulator cells
  by decaying SOCS mRNAs and consequently activating IL-2-STAT5 pathway. (C) E3 ligase
  VHL promotes the early initiation of Tfh cells development via suppressing HIF-1α-GAPDH–mediated
  glycolysis, ultimately enhancing ICOS expression by reducing m6A-labed ICOS mRNA.
  (D) METTL14-mediated m6A modification facilitates IL-7-induced pro-B cell proliferation
  by decreasing a group of transcripts that negatively regulate cell cycle. SOCS,
  suppressor of cytokine signaling; JAK, Janus Kinase; STAT5, Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 5; VHL, Von Hippel–Lindau; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α; ICOS, inducible T cell costimulatory; Ub, Ubiquitination.
