caption: 'Folate biosynthesis and structures of pathway intermediates. (a) Conventional
  and alternative folate biosynthetic pathways. (i) The conventional folate biosynthetic
  scheme is found in plants, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that are capable of de
  novo folate synthesis. (ii) The alternative scheme is found in P. falciparum, in
  which PfPTPS provides a route to 6HMDP that bypasses the need for a DHNA activity.
  HPPK and DHPS activities are found on a single bifunctional protein in P. falciparum
  and related organisms (). The asterisked metabolite in pathway (ii) was identified
  only from its oxidation product []. Enzymes are shown in boxes. Abbreviations: GCHI,
  GTP cyclohydrolase I; PP/P, sequential pyrophosphatase and phosphatase activities
  (the pyrophosphatase has been identified in several organisms [,]); DHNA, dihydroneopterin
  aldolase; HPPK, hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase: DHPS, dihydropteroate
  synthase; DHFS, dihydrofolate synthase; PfPTPS, pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase
  orthologue from P. falciparum; pAB, p-aminobenzoate; L-Glu, L-glutamate. (b) Structures
  of the two products of the PfPTPS reaction in Figure 1a, scheme (ii). (i) 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin.
