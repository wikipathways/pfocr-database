caption: Schematic examples illustrate that 13C-analysis can be utilized to determine
  the contributions of various biosynthetic pathways towards final product yield.
  (A) 13C analysis to study the carbon assimilation during syngas fermentation (13CO2,
  12CO and H2). Analysis of metabolite labeling patterns can determine CO2 and CO
  utilization for pyruvate production. The isotopomer data of pyruvate was used as
  a demonstration of 13C applications for product yield calculations. (B) Threonine
  and citramalate pathway for the synthesis of 1-butanol. The carbon rearrangement
  network shows the labeling of 1-butanol from the two biosynthesis pathways, when
  fed with 1-13C pyruvate and 13C bicarbonate.
