caption: 'The main metabolic pathways triggered by chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH).
  Hypoxia and starvation occurring during CBH activate several cell pathways. The
  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway is strongly activated during CBH. Increased
  AMP binds to AMPK, which is phosphorylated by several kinases, such as LKB1. Glucose
  deprivation increases p53, which stimulates the transcription of sestrin 1/sestrin
  2 proteins, which, in turn, enhance the AMPK activation. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)-induced DNA damage increases the ataxia-telengiectasia-mutated (ATM) activity,
  thus leading to increased p53 and REDD1 transcription. Upon oxidation by ROS, cytosolic
  ATM forms homodimers and activates AMPK by phosphorylation. CBH-induced calcium
  overload activate AMPK through calcium calmodulin-dependent kinases. AMPK inhibits
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by acting on the Tsc2 protein. Tsc2 is part
  of the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex, which converts the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine
  diphosphate (GDP)-bound Rheb, which causes the inhibition of mTOR. In particular,
  AMPK phosphorylates Tsc2 at two sites, thus enhancing the ability of the Tsc1/Tsc2
  complex to block Rheb-dependent mTOR activation. Finally, mTOR inhibition leads
  to ATG activation. The hypoxia-induced Akt pathway stimulates mTOR by inhibiting
  Tsc2. This occurs through Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Tsc2, thus inducing its
  dissociation from the complex Tsc1/Tsc2. This stabilizes Rheb to activate mTOR,
  thereby inhibiting ATG. The activation of Akt also triggers a phosphorylation cascade,
  producing various effects. A key protein targeted by Akt is the transcription factor
  cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which induces the expression
  of genes related to cell growth and survival, such as brain derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) and the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2. Moreover, Akt increases the expression
  of the alpha subunit of the transcription factor HIF-1, which is essential for hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activity. In turn, HIF-1 regulates the transcription
  of the genes related to anaerobic metabolism, thus promoting the shift towards the
  glycolytic metabolism. CBH-induced hypoxia and starvation also activate ATG throughout
  mechanisms that do not involve mTOR. The hypoxia-induced HIF-1 increases the expression
  BNIP3, which, via beclin 1, promotes ATG. An increased amount of beclin1 occurs
  through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway under starvation and oxidative
  stress. Red arrow: increased activity/levels, Blue arrow: decreased activity/levels,
