caption: 'A: Both ligands and receptors are single-pass transmembrane proteins composed
  of different structural domains. Ligands have an extracellular domain with three
  related structural motifs: 1) the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) motif; 2) the Delta
  and OSM-11-like protein (DOS) motif and 3) a third motif is composed of EGF-like
  repeats, both calcium binding and non calcium-binding, that can affect signaling
  efficiency. Jagged ligands also have a cytosine-rich (C-rich) domain. The extracellular
  domain of DLK1 has only a DOS motif and EGF repeats. The structure of the transmembrane
  and intracellular portions of the ligands remain largely unknown. Notch receptors
  have an extracellular domain that contains EGF-like repeats and a negative regulatory
  region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The intracellular domain
  contains an RBPJ association module (RAM) that binds the transcription complex,
  a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), seven ankyrin repeats (ANK), and a proline
  (P)/glutamic acid (E)/serine (S)/threonine (T) (PEST) motif that targets the protein
  for degradation. B: The receptor is activated in a juxtacrine manner through its
  interaction with a ligand presented by an adjacent cell. Appropriate ligand binding
  produces a conformational change in the Notch receptor, exposing the extracellular
  domain for ADAM10 enzyme cleavage []. Subsequently, there is a second cleavage within
  the transmembrane domain [], performed by the gamma-secretase (GS) complex. GS cleavage
  releases the active form of the receptor—Notch intracellular domain (NICD)—into
  the cytoplasm from which it translocates into the nucleus. Here NICD complexes with
  the DNA-binding transcription activator factor RBPJ (also known as CBF1 and CSL)
  to displace the transcriptional repressor Mint. This displacement facilitates the
  recruitment of activators such as Mastermind (MM) and thereby the transcription
  of pathway target genes. The main targets of the Notch pathway are two families
  of transcriptional repressors: the Hairy and enhancer of split (HES) and the Hairy/enhancer-of-split
  related with YRPW motif (HEY) proteins. Although it remains unknown if HES6 is a
  target of Notch pathway, recent studies reveal that HES6 may play an important role
  in prostate cancer progression. To quench Notch pathway activation, the NICD is
  phosphorylated on the PEST domain by E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby targeting it
  for proteosomal degradation [].'
