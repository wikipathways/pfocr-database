caption: Neuroprotective effects of H2S in Alzheimer’s disease. Homocysteine can increase
  neuronal cell apoptosis and inhibit the production of endogenous H2S and cause the
  upregulation of ERS-related GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-12. Proper H2S concentration
  protects neurons by inhibiting ROS generation and preserving MMP pathway to reduce
  Alzheimer’s disease symptoms. H2S can increase expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
  or reduce cellular ROS toxicity and also restrain homocysteine-induced ERS and hippocampal
  neuronal apoptosis by upregulating BDNF/TrkB pathway in Alzheimer’s disease rat
  models.
