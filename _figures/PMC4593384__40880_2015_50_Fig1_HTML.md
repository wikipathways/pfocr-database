caption: Multilevel map connecting genes via pathways to hallmarks. a Illustration
  of the automated process that links genes to pathways and to hallmarks. Left A pathway
  from the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). All genes marked with an orange star
  are upstream of the Gene ontology (GO) process “negative regulation of apoptotic
  process” (red box). (The text of the protein complexes and GO processes are not
  meant to be readable.) Middle A part of the GO hierarchy. The GO process “negative
  regulation of apoptotic process” is associated with the more general GO process
  “regulation of programmed cell death” (blue box), which is representative of the
  cancer hallmark “resisting cell death.” Right Mapping between each hallmark and
  one or more general GO terms. b Depiction of the multilevel map, which links 1384
  genes to 343 pathways and to 10 hallmarks. c A table indicating the number of genes
  and pathways linked to each of the 10 hallmarks
