caption: 'A) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on soft substrates exhibit a low
  contractility phenotype: low spread area, poorly developed focal adhesions (FAs)
  and stress fibers, and lower levels of lamin-A,C in the nuclear lamina. B) Lamin-A,C
  level is regulated by tension-dependent kinase activity. Low tension allows lamin
  to be phosphorylated, leading to increased solubility and turn-over. The filamentous
  lamina is thus maintained in a state appropriate to the mechanical environment of
  the nucleus. C) On soft substrates, transcription factor (TF) RARG remains in the
  cytoplasm, reducing transcription of the lamin-A,C gene (LMNA) and favoring adipogenesis,
  an effect enhanced by agonists to the retinoic acid (RA) pathway. TF YAP/TAZ also
  remains cytoplasmic, favoring adipose and neuronal lineages over osteogenesis. D)
  By contrast, MSCs that have been cultured on stiff substrates have a high contractility
  phenotype: high spread area, well developed FAs and stress fibers, high levels of
  TF serum response factor (SRF), and a nuclear lamina rich in lamin-A,C. E) High
  tension on the nuclear lamina inhibits phosphorylation and turn-over of lamin-A,C.
  F) The contractility of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton is regulated in response to
  substrate stiffness by the Rho/ROCK signalling cascade. G) On stiff substrates,
  TF RARG translocates to the nucleus, increasing transcription of LMNA and driving
  osteogenesis, an effect enhanced by the addition of antagonists to the RA pathway.
  YAP/TAZ levels in the nucleus are also increased, favoring osteogenesis over adipogenic
  or chondrogenic cell fates.'
