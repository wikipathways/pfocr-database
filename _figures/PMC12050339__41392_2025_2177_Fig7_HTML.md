  in the processing of VEGFC,241–243 which is essential for the initial steps of lymphangiogenesis.
  The absence of CCBE1 and VEGFC leads to impaired development and dysfunction of
  meningeal lymphatic vessels.249 b FOXC2 is one of the main promoters of lymphatic
  valve development, while the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 acts as an inhibitor
  of lymphatic valve formation and maintenance in LECs. Elevated FOXO1 is associated
  with reduced FOXC2, and Akt-mediated phosphorylation leads to FOXO1 inactivation,
  thereby facilitating lymphatic valve formation.264,265 c Piezo1 controls mLV drainage

  flow and functional drainage by facilitating VEGF-C expression, VEGFR3 activation,
  and lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation via integrin-mediated interactions

  in lymphangiogenesis,290,291 where EGFR dephosphorylation mediates the subsequent
  dephosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. This dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 may lead
  to a reduction in VEGFR3 and connexin expression, resulting in discontinuation of
  basal mLVs and impaired mLV drainage.47 e CGRP-triggered CLR signaling pathway activation

  as a vasodilator by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase, elevating cyclic-GMP,

  Ca2+ reuptake, inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase activity, and inducing lymphatic
  vessel relaxation.52,343 h CX3CR1 mediates leukocyte recruitment to form lymphatic
