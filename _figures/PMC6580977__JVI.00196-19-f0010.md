caption: Model of action of p22-mediated inhibition of IFN-α signaling. HBV virion
  infects hepatocyte via sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)-mediated
  entry, followed by nuclear import of nucleocapsid and the establishment of cccDNA
  episome. cccDNA serves as the transcription template to produce viral mRNAs. During
  the translation of precore protein from the 3.5-kb precore mRNA, the initially translated
  N-terminal signal peptide is recognized by the cellular signal recognition particle
  (SRP) receptor and directed to the rough ER. After the cleavage of signal peptide
  by ER-associated signal peptidase (SPase), the translation resumes and p22 is synthesized
  and enters the ER lumen. Subsequently, p22 is sorted into the Golgi apparatus, where
  the CTD is cleaved off by Golgi apparatus-resident endopeptidase furin to generate
  the secreted HBeAg/p17. In the meantime, a portion of p22 is retrotranslocated into
  the cytosol from the ER and can be further imported into the nuclear compartment
  due to the presence of the NLS motif on the CTD domain, which is recognized by cellular
  nuclear transportation receptor karyopherin α1 (Kα1). When the cell receives IFN-α
  treatment, the cytoplasmic p22 can blunt the IFN-α-elicited JAK-STAT pathway through
  competing with the binding of Kα1 with activated pSTAT, leading to downregulated
  IFN signaling and ISG expression. This mode of action represents a viral strategy
  to evade the innate antiviral response. This scheme was illustrated by using the
  Biology Bundle of Motifolio Drawing Toolkits.
