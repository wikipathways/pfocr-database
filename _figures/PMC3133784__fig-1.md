caption: Overview of signaling pathways that control transcription during transition
  from exponential growth to diauxic shift and stationary phase. PKA and TORC1 converge
  and negatively regulate Rim15p and transition to diauxic shift and quiescence. The
  key targets of this pathway are transcriptional factors Msn2p/Msn4p and Gis1p. Snf1p
  is active when glucose is exhausted and regulates expression of genes involved in
  catabolism of nonfermentable carbon sources. Only the basic scheme is shown and
  the text provides more detail.
