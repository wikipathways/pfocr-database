  3C improves the depressive behavior of mice with endotoxins induced neuroinflammation
  by promoting the anti-inflammatory activity of microglia through adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK)/ peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) alleviates peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ)/NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3
  (NLRP3) axis-mediated neuroinflammation and relieve depression-like behaviors in
  chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mice
  by up-regulating PPARγ expression. Baicalin can improve depressive-like behavior
  and neuroinflammation in CUMS and LPS-induced mice by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/forkhead
  Box O1 (FOXO1) pathway. Ginsenoside Rg1 may reduce chronic social defeat stress
  (CSDS)-induced depressive-like behavior in mice by inhibiting the transcriptional
  activity of NF-κB and regulating mitogen activation and SIRT1 signaling pathways.
  Pinocembrin can reverse CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors by regulating nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NF-kB signaling
  pathways. Catalpol improves depression-like behaviors in CUMS mice by alleviating
  oxidative stress-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuroinflammation. Cinnamic
  acid can attenuate LPS-induced depression-like behaviors by reducing oxidative stress,
  and ameliorating LPS-induced BDNF damage. Asperosaponin VI exerts antidepressant
  effects by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, down-regulating the expression
  of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and normalizing abnormal glutamate transmission
