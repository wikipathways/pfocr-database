caption: Relation between some major controlling factors involved in apoptosis. Two
  major pathways of caspase activation have been described in mammalian cells, resulting
  in apoptosis. In the mitochondrial pathway Bax and Bid are cell death factors, which
  increase mitochondrial permeability and release of cytochrome C. Cell survival factors
  Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and BAG-1 inhibit actions of Bax and Bid on mitochondria. Apaf-1,
  a downstream mediator of apoptosis, along with cytochrome C, associates with caspase
  9 in cytoplasm and leads to its activation. The resultant apoptosome initiates a
  cascade of effector caspases, which include caspases 3, 6, and 7. Active caspase
  3 activates DNA fragmentation factor and promotes internucleosomal cleavage of DNA.
  The death receptor pathway is triggered by members of the death receptor superfamily
  such as CD95 and tumour necrosis factor receptor. Formation of a death inducing
  signalling complex induces caspase 8 activation and thereby the downstream caspase
  cascade. Further control of the apoptotic process is provided by inhibitors of apoptosis
  in the cytoplasm that abrogate caspase activity.Interaction between the two pathways
  exist. P53 is known to induce apoptosis, but exact mechanisms are not clear. The
  mitochondrial pathway seems to dominate in breast cancer
