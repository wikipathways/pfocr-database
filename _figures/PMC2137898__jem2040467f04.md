caption: Model for the regulation of HSC self-renewal by the Smad signaling pathway.
  The canonical Smad pathway inhibits HSC expansion. This inhibition can be relieved
  upon enforced expression of the inhibitory Smad7. Recently, TIF1γ has been shown
  to compete with Smad4 for binding of R-Smads, leading to differentiation of primitive
  cells into erythrocytes. In addition to its inhibitory role in HSCs as a critical
  partner in the canonical Smad pathway, Smad4 has a positive effect on self-renewal,
  possibly as a transducer of unknown regulators outside this pathway.
