caption: Effects of neddylation on the anti-viral pathway. Neddylation is pivotal
  in the antiviral pathway, inducing inflammatory cytokines and type I-IFN. Upon infection
  by RNA viruses, such as Sendai virus (SeV), NEDD8 either acts on ubiquitin E3 ligase
  and affects NF-κB translocation or binds to IRF7 directly and promotes inflammatory
  cytokine and type I IFN production. Moreover, neddylation is involved in the conjugation
  of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the IFN-β promoter, and this was proved
  using MLN4924. If invaders are DNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, NEDD8
  targets the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and converts it to cGAMP.
  cGAMP then attaches to the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and activates
  TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3, activating the type I-IFN gene. STING signaling
  also results in the expression of inflammatory cytokines through the NF-κB pathway
  (dashed line). Other proteins involved in the innate antiviral pathway have not
  yet been reported as substrates of neddylation.
