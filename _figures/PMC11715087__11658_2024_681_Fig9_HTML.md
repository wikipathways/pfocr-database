caption: 'A working model summarizing key conclusions from this study. Upper panel:
  NAXD-deficient yeast and human cells display inhibition of de novo serine synthesis.
  In human cells, this effect is revealed only under certain conditions, such as cultivation
  in the presence of galactose instead of glucose. It is possible that this blockage
  of the serine synthesis pathway contributes to downstream perturbations in lipid
  metabolism, which were suggested on the basis of plasma metabolomic analyses in
  a NAXD patient [18]. Lower panel: NR and inosine partially rescue NAXD deficiency
  phenotypes via distinct mechanisms. Our results suggest that inosine exerts a rescue
  effect in HAP1 NAXDko cells by reducing the cells'' reliance on the serine synthesis
  pathway for downstream metabolic processes, whereas NR supplementation presumably
  leads to positive effects via relieving PHGDH inhibition through reduced NADHX burden
  and/or increased NAD+/NADH ratio'
