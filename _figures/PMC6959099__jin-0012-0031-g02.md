caption: Metabolic changes associated with innate immune responses in lung disease.
  An overview of the metabolic changes associated with innate immune cell regulation
  in asthma (a) and COPD (b). a Studies in animal models show that chronic exposure
  to inhaled allergen leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium
  that is accompanied by a reduction in OXPHOS and activation of glycolysis, which
  supports the production of cytokines and inflammatory cell recruitment. Bronchial
  epithelial cells from patients with asthma also show increased glycolysis, but at
  the same time exhibit up-regulation of ARG 2, which acts as a protective mechanism
  by restoring OXPHOS, reducing glycolysis and inhibiting inflammatory mediator production.
  Epithelial-derived IL-33 and TSLP induce the maturation and activation of dendritic
  and ILC2 that orchestrate adaptive immune responses. Upon activation, DCs show a
  reduction in FAO and OXPHOS and an up-regulation of glycolysis, PPP and FAS to meet
  the biosynthetic demands of inflammatory mediator production. IL-33-induced ILC2
  maturation, on the other hand, is inhibited by PKM2 through a reduction in the expression
  of the IL-33 receptor, IL1RL1. Moreover, up-regulation of ARG 1 supports allergen-dependent
  proliferation of ILC2 cells. IgE produced by B cells activates mast cells to release
  histamine and lipid mediators driving airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness.
  Binding of IgE to its receptor triggers inactivation of PKM2, truncating glycolysis
  and leading to accumulation of upstream intermediates that are channelled to the
  biosynthesis of lipid mediators released during degranulation. Studies in animal
  models report a role of FAO in M2 differentiation of macrophages and the development
  of allergic inflammation; however, other studies show conflicting findings. b Cigarette
  smoke and other inhaled pollutants are thought to induce ROS-mediated mitochondrial
  dysfunction and attenuated energy production, due to impaired FAO and TCA, in the
  epithelium of patients with COPD. These defects may be accompanied by increased
  glycolysis and ROS production that drive epithelial-mediated inflammatory cell recruitment
  and lung pathology. Mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral and alveolar macrophages
  from patients with COPD has also been associated with mitochondrial ROS production
  and increased glycolysis, which possibly lead to increased inflammatory mediator
  production and defective phagocytosis and bactericidal activity. TSLP, thymic stromal
  lymphopoietin; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ARG 1, arginase 1; ARG 2, arginase
  2; ILC2, type 2 innate lymphoid cells; DC, dendritic cells; FAO, fatty acid oxidation;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; PKM2, pyruvate kinase
  isoform M2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; COPD, chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease.
