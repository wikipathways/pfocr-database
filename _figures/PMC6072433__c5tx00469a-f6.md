caption: . Summary of molecular pathways affected by APAP treatment (5 mg APAP per
  mg cellular protein for 48 h) observed using label free proteomics and SNO/SOH TMT.
  Detoxification of NAPQI leads to depletion of GSH and accumulation of endogenous
  RNS and ROS that contribute to generation of modified proteins. In response, cells
  activate pathways that lead to decreased protein synthesis and increased production
  of reducing power via the pentose phosphate pathway.

  (ESI) available: Supplementary data in the form of a pdf file and an Excel table
  are available free of charge at the publisher''s site. ‘Supplementary Figures.pdf’
  contains additional figures and detailed figure descriptions. Supplementary Table
  S1.xlsx contains 5 tables presenting detailed protein expression data. Table A –
  ‘Protein expression’ contains a list of all proteins identified/quantified in label-free
  proteomics experiments; Table B – ‘IPA analysis’ contains the results of the pathway
  analysis of differentially regulated proteins under APAP treatment; Table C – ‘SNO/SOH
  proteome’ contains the list of all unique, iodoTMT-containing peptides quantified
  in min. 2 biological replicates. Table D – ‘RedoxDB + dbSNO’ is a summary of the
  comparative analysis of all identified SNO/SOH proteins and sites with information
  deposited in publicly available repositories of cysteine modifications – RedoxDB
  and dbSNO. Table E – ‘_extended’ is an extended version of  from the main manuscript.
