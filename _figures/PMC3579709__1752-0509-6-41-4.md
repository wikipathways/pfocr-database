caption: Inconsistency contributions to carbohydrate metabolism. The maps depict the
  usage patterns and inconsistency contributions for (a) the control and (b) the high
  and (c) low inconsistency groups (HIG and LIG). The thickness and color of a reaction
  edge correspond to the usage frequency and the contribution strength, respectively.
  The pathway maps have been obtained from the BIGG database [].
