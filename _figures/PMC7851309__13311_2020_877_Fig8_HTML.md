caption: 'mPDM608 treatment shifts CD4+ T-cell populations into an anti-inflammatory
  phenotype. Gene expression values from CD4+ T cells treated with 10 mg/kg mPDM608
  were normalized to PBS treatment. qRT-PCR data show gene expression changes following
  mPDM608 treatment compared to PBS controls (n = 4). Fold changes and p values for
  differentially regulated gene expression were determined using Qiagen RT2 Profiler
  PCR Array Data Analysis software, version 3.5. Significant differences in fold change
  were determined in which p < 0.05. (a) Table of fold regulation and p values for
  genes significantly upregulated or downregulated ≥ 2-fold following treatment with
  mPDM608. Genes upregulated ≥ 2- to 5-fold are shown in pink and > 5-fold are in
  red. Genes downregulated ≥ 2- to 5-fold are shown in light green and > 5 are labeled
  dark green. (b) Depiction of the direct and indirect network pathways generated
  using genes from panel (a). The depicted pathway is a merged product of 2 connected
  networks: hematological system development and function and inflammatory response
  and cell-to-cell signaling. The resulting gene network was analyzed and prepared
  using Qiagen’s IPA software. Green coloration indicates downregulated genes. Pink
  or red coloration indicates upregulated genes. Nodes lacking color indicate genes
  identified by IPA that were not measured but are involved in the signaling pathways.
  Gray arrows indicate direct relationships between 2 connecting genes'
