caption: 'Scheme of proposed signaling pathway used by bradykinin to stimulate proliferation
  in A498 cells. This scheme is described in the Discussion section.Notes: BK stimulates
  ERK through the B2 receptor-Gq/11pathway, which includes the activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), PLC-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, and calmodulin
  (CaM) activity. BK B2 receptors stimulate NHE1 activity, which is necessary for
  the ERK-dependent proliferation of A498 cells. The dashed line indicates a putative
  pathway used by BK to activate NHE upstream of ERK.Abbreviations: BK, bradykinin;
  ERK, extracellular acidification rate; NHE, Na+/H+ exchange.'
papertitle: The bradykinin B2 receptor induces multiple cellular responses leading
  to the proliferation of human renal carcinoma cell lines.
