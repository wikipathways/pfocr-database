caption: Schematic illustration of the cytoprotective effects of dexamethasone in
  HK-2 cells. Raf-1 and 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to colocalize with the GR
  multiprotein complex. Binding of the dexamethasone to the cytosolic GR causes release
  of heat shock proteins, activates the ligand–receptor complex, and triggers the
  translocation of the ligand receptor to the nucleus to subsequently elicit traditional
  genomic effects. In addition, the ligand–receptor interaction also rapidly activates
  the B-Raf/MEK/ERK 1/2 pathway, thereby exerting direct cytoprotective effects. It
  is possible that heat shock proteins or 14-3-3 proteins, both known mediators of
  Raf/MEK/ERK 1/2 signaling, provide the crosstalk. Dex, dexamethasone; GR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; hsp, heat shock protein. Block arrows denotes activation; dashed arrows
  suggest movement. ?? denotes possible role in activating the kinase cascade.
