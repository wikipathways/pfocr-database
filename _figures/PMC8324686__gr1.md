caption: Cholesterol transport through the endolysosomal network. After binding to
  LDLR, LDL-cholesterol is internalized, and the LDL-LDLR complex is transported to
  endosomes, where LDL-cholesterol dissociates from LDLR. LDLR can be transported
  back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes (RE). LDL-cholesterol is transported
  to late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY), where lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes
  cholesterol esters to release free cholesterol. TPC2 is important for LE-LY fusion
  and thus for further cholesterol transport. NPC2 can bind and deliver free cholesterol
  to NPC1. NPC1 regulates cholesterol transport to other cellular compartments, such
  as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by interacting with Rab7 and the plasma membrane
  via Rab8a. The ER-located RNF26 recruits and ubiquitinates p62, leading to the binding
  of specific endosomal-associated adaptor proteins to mediate the positioning of
  vesicles in the perinuclear area, but its function in cholesterol transport needs
  to be elucidated. Gramd1b, or Aster-B, is implicated in both LE/LY-to-PM and PM-to-ER
  cholesterol transport. When cholesterol levels in the ER are low, SREBP is translocated
  to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of genes involved in lipogenesis
  and cholesterol uptake and synthesis. Cholesterol levels in LE/LY affect lysosomal
  function and thereby also the autophagic pathway, in which p62 is an important player.
  Rab24 is thought to reduce autophagy and thereby contribute to MAFLD. The endosomal
  WASH complex and the retromer subunit VPS35 are also known to affect autophagy,
  but their physiological role in this context and in MAFLD remain unknown.
