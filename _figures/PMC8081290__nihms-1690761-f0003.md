caption: Complexity emerges after the integration of individual metabolic signaling
  pathways, the latter discussed and cited in the main text. Depicted are contributions
  from the extracellular milieu, including stressed, injured, and apoptotic cells
  (ACs), which are recognized by cell surface receptors such as toll like receptors
  (TLRs), MerTK (Mer Tyrosine Kinase) and CD36. Contributions of glucose carbons and
  hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) regulate Mф cytokine secretion. Integration of
  metabolic signaling occurs through the Krebs cycle, electron transport chain (complexes
  I-IV and ATP synthase), and NAD+ pathways. Fatty acids (FAs) and amino acids (AA)
  also influx into the axes. Taken together, these key metabolic circuits have the
  potential to regulate growth factors, cytokine production, and crosstalk between
  Mфs and neighboring cells. ACO = aconitase. alphaKG = alpha ketoglutarate. AMPK
  = AMP-activated protein kinase. ARG = arginine. Beta-ox = Beta oxidation. CIT =
  citrate. CoA = Coenzyme A. CHOL = cholesterol. CPT = carnitine palmitoyltransferase.
  DAMP = damage associated molecular patterns. EPI = epigenetic. FADH2 = flavin adenine
  dinucleotide. FFA = free fatty acid. FUM = fumarate. GLU = glucose. G6P = glucose
  6-phosphage. GLUT = glucose transporter. IDH = isocitrate dehydrogenase. FABP =
  fatty acid binding protein. HIF = hypoxia inducible factor. mTOR = mechanistic target
  of rapamycin. mROS = mitochondrial ROS. NAD = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
  NO = nitric oxide. PHD = prolyl hydroxylase domain. PPP = pentose phosphate pathway.
  SLC = solute carrier family. SDH = succinate dehydrogenase. SCOT = succinyl-coenzyme
  A-oxoacid transferase. SIRT = sirtuins. SUC = succinate. VEGF = vascular endothelial
  growth factor.
