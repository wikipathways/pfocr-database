caption: 'DNMT proteins regulate cytosine methylation. DNMT3A/B are important regulators
  of de novo methylation. TET proteins demethylate DNA by converting 5-mC into 5-hmC,
  5-fC, and 5-caC through a pathway of three consecutive oxidation reactions. Subsequently,
  5-fC and 5-caC are recognized by TDG which activates the base excision repair pathway.5-caC:
  5-carboxylcytosine; 5-fC: 5-formylcytosine; SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAM: S-adenosylmethionine;
  TDG: Thymine-DNA glycosylase.'
