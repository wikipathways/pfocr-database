caption: The putative floral development regulatory network of reblooming bearded
  iris. This regulatory network was modified and integrated from the transcriptome
  sequencing results of the circadian rhythm related genes, the flowering pathway
  (including vernalization and photoperiod pathways) genes and the growth related
  pathway genes. Dark-blue indicates a relative increase of expression, and light-blue
  represents a relative decrease of expression. T1-T6 represents the six developmental
  stages in Table . OB and RB represent once-bloomers and rebloomers, respectively
