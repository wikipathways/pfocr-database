caption: Model explaining the roles of OsGUN4 during oxidative stress. In WT plants,
  the 1O2 level increases with the progress of photosynthesis, and activate EXECUTER
  1 and/or EXECUTER 2 sense 1O2 level and other transcription factor genes, such as
  BAP1, but greatly repress the transcription of PhANGs. The transcription factors
  further activate downstream target genes including PRX genes, and the peroxidases
  encoded by them together help scavenge ROS thus maintain a low ROS levels. However,
  in gun4 mutants, the 1O2 level remains low due to lack of functional GUN4 hence
  the 1O2-mediated retrograde signaling pathway is not activated, and consequently,
  (1) a relatively high level of photosynthesis is maintained, which continuously
  generates ROS, (2) PRX genes are not activated hence ROS scavenging capacity remains
  low, which together result in the accumulation of excessive ROS.
