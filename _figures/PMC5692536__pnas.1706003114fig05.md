caption: 'A proposed model of the control of chloroplast redox homeostasis. (A) Light-driven
  photochemical reactions of photosynthesis generate reduced Fd (FdRED) and NADPH
  by the action of Fd-NADP+ reductase (FNR). Additionally, NADPH can be produced by
  the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). Chloroplast Trxs are responsible
  for the light-dependent redox regulation of metabolic pathways and the feedback
  regulation of photochemical reactions. 2-Cys Prxs display three thiol-based redox
  states: oxidized (2CPox), reduced (2CPred), and overoxidized (2CPovox), which is
  reduced by sulfiredoxin (SRX). (B) In NTRC-deficient plants, the accumulation of
  oxidized 2-Cys Prxs provokes draining of reducing power from the pool of Trxs, and,
  consequently, redox regulation of their targets is impaired. (C) Decreasing the
  content of 2-Cys Prxs accordingly decreases the draining of reducing power from
  the pool of Trxs, and the redox regulation of their targets is thereby restored.'
