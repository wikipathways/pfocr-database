caption: 'The TNF-α/TNFRSF1A,B/NF-KB signaling pathway. TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory
  cytokine synthesized by various cell lineages, mainly macrophages, dendritic cells,
  keratinocytes as well as various T cell types. It exerts its functions through binding
  to type 1 (TNFR1) and 2 (TNFR2) cell membrane receptors. TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B) shows
  higher affinity for TNF-α. NF-κB is a dimer made up of Rel family proteins (p50,
  p52, Rel A/p65, cRel, and Rel B), the p50/p65 heterodimer being the most common.
  In the absence of TNF-α stimulation, the activity of NF-κB is regulated at cytoplasmic
  level by an inhibitory complex of proteins called IKB or Kappa Beta inhibitors (IkB
  alpha, beta, and epsilon) that regulate its function by blocking its translocation
  to the nucleus. The binding of TNF-α to its receptors triggers the activation of
  the inhibitor kinases of NF-κB or “IKK complex” consisting of IKK-alpha, IKK-beta
  and IKK-gamma or NEMO. The characteristic event is the phosphorylation of IKB-alpha
  by the IKKa/b complex, inducing its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome;
  and thus, allowing the release of NF-κB. Once in the nucleus, NF-κB meets another
  inhibitory protein called IKBZ. Likewise, IKBZ can act as a transcription factor
  regulated by IL-17A, IL-1beta, and to a lesser extent, by TNF-α. In turn, IKBZ plays
  an important role in the development and expansion of Th17 lineages. Finally, CARD14
  activates NF-κB by partially known mechanisms (see text for more details), although
  some authors suggest that CARD14 would activate the IKK complex, consequently regulating
  the activity of NF-κB, leading to an increase in its transcriptional activity. TNF-α:
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha. TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A): TNF-α type 1 receptor. TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B):
  TNF-α type 2 receptor. NF-κB: nuclear factor of kappa light chain enhancer of activated
  B cells. IKB: kappa-beta inhibitors. IKK: inhibitor kinases of NF-κB. IKBZ: z-inhibitor
  protein of NF-κB. IL: interleukin. Th: T-helper. CARD14: caspase recruitment domain
