caption: TLR4 signaling – a converged immune response pathway for hemorrhagic shock
  and septic shock. TLR4 not only serves as a key sensor of pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) but also is proposed recently to act as a receptor for some endogenous
  molecules called “alarmins”. HDACIs block TLR4 signaling at multiple steps; therefore,
  they can inhibit immune response for both hemorrhagic shock and septic shock.
