caption: The ligands for KIR receptors are mainly HLA I antigens. HLA molecules were
  grouped into four major categories based on the amino acid sequence determining
  the KIR-binding epitope. All expressed HLA-C alleles are placed in C1 or C2 group
  and most HLA-B alleles can be classified as either Bw4 or Bw6. The number of protein
  sequence variants characterized to date for each KIR receptor is provided. The figure
  shows signaling pathways from the activated receptors via tyrosine kinase binding
  protein-DAP12 and inhibitory receptors to. Phosphorylation DAP12 events result in
  recruitment of SYK family kinases such as Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and ZAP70
  (zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70 kDa). In this pathway take part via alia
  LAT (Linker for activating of T cells), Shc (Src homology 2 domain containing),
  GRB2 (Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), 3BP2(c-Abl Src homology 3 domain-binding
  protein-2). Syk interacts with SLP76 (SLP-76 tyrosine phosphoprotein) and activates
  Vav proteins (guanine nucleotide exchange factors). ZAP70 and SYK pathways lead
  to ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
  kinases) activation results in NK cells cytotoxity. Once the ligand is recognized
  by an inhibitory receptor, the pathway is blocked through dephosphorylation by tyrosine
  phosphatase protein (SHP-1) and 11 (SHP-2).
