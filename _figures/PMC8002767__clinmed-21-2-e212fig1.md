caption: Simplified illustration of the mechanism of checkpoint inhibitor modulation
  of the immune response to cancer cells. a) Normal physiological state. In the unaltered
  physiological state, detection of cancer cell antigens, either via antigen-presenting
  cells or cancer cells themselves, causes T-cell activation. Pictured are two physiological
  mechanisms that reduce exaggerated immune response, but also immunosurveillance
  and therefore elimination of cancer cells. (1) CTLA-4 outcompetes CD-28 to bind
  to CD-80. Instead of further activation by CD-28, CTLA-4 sends inhibitory signals
  to deactivate T-cells. (2) Binding of PD-L-1 on the cancer cell or antigen-presenting
  cell to PD-1 on a T-cell activates inhibitory signals to immune response and encourages
  apoptosis of immune cells. b) State with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Checkpoint
  inhibitor therapy acts on both mechanisms via three targets. (1) Anti-CTLA-4 mAb
  binds to CTLA-4, resulting in subsequent promotion of T-cell activation and survival
  by the CD-28 pathway. (2) Anti-PD-1 mAb binds to PD-1 on T-cells, preventing a negative
  feedback pathway. (3) Anti-PD-L-1 mAb binds to PD-L-1 on cancer cells, preventing
  the same negative feedback. CTLA-4 = cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4; mAb = monoclonal
  antibody; PD-1 = protein death 1; PD-L-1 = protein death ligand 1.
