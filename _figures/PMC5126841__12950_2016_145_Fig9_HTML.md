caption: Schematic representation of the study. This study suggests a possible mechanism
  to augment the immunological response on use of Riboflavin with antibiotics, AZM
  and CIP, which is achieved by enhanced ROS, ensuring enhancement of pathogen clearance
  and by the antioxidant properties of Riboflavin protection of the host cell is ensured,
  thus helped in maintaining a balanced redox state in the cell. Riboflavin by its
  proteasome inhibitory action might down regulates the NF-κβ pathway, thus reducing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and COX2, which on one hand prevent infection
  and on other hand lowers inflammatory damage
papertitle: Riboflavin along with antibiotics balances reactive oxygen species and
  inflammatory cytokines and controls Staphylococcus aureus infection by boosting
  murine macrophage function and regulates inflammation.
