caption: Protein-protein interaction network and functional enrichment analysis of
  proteins with acetylation, carbamylation and phosphorylation sites regulated by
  bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The network contains 54 common proteins which
  had altered levels of carbamylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation by the LPS
  treatment (n = 4) vs. control group (n = 3). The bar graph shows the direction of
  regulation (p < 0.05) of the three modifications after LPS treatment. The network
  was enriched in proteins of the innate immune system, cytokine signaling pathway
  in immune system, and protein post-translation modification pathway using Reactome
  and they are highlighted the color of pink, blue, green, respectively. The line
  colors represent if the interactions were experimental determined (pink) and curated
  in databases (purple)
