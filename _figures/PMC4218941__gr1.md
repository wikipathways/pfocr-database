caption: Regulation and effects of JNK signaling in hepatocytes. Activation of JNK
  in hepatocytes occurs through phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues
  that is triggered by extracellular stimuli including growth factors and cytokines,
  injurious mediators including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) and nutritional and metabolic factors.
  This phosphorylation involves a multi-step protein kinase signaling cascade with
  MAPKKKs and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases MKK4 and MKK7.
  JNK phosphorylation is negatively regulated by signaling through ERK1/2, PKC and
  PKD. JNK activity is also down regulated by phosphatases. JNK signaling effects
  are predominantly mediated through transcriptional activation of the c-Jun/AP-1
  signaling pathway, but also by the direct effects of JNK to lead to biological effects
  such as cell proliferation or death. Red lines show inhibitory pathways.
