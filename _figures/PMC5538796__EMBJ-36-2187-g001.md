caption: (A) Endothelial cells (ECs) line blood vessels and remain quiescent for years.
  In these vessels, ECs, termed phalanx cells, are maintained in a quiescent state,
  in part through the interaction of mural cells such as pericytes and smooth muscle
  cells (SMCs), which stabilize the vessel, strengthening intercellular junctions
  and improving barrier function. Upon stimulus to extracellular cues such as vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF), ECs switch to
  an angiogenic phenotype towards the growth factor gradient. (B) In normoxia, endothelial
  cells (ECs) are characterized by high rates of glycolytic flux, where glucose is
  metabolized to pyruvate and lactate. 6‐phosphofructokinase/2,6‐bisphosphatase 3
  (PFKFB3) is upregulated during angiogenesis and regulates glycolytic flux through
  the production of fructose 2,6‐bisphosphate, an allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK1), a rate‐limiting step of glycolysis. Glucose intermediates are also used
  to fuel the side‐glycolytic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), important for redox
  homeostasis. ECs also utilize fatty acids (FAs), which are transported to the mitochondria
  by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A), a rate‐controlling step of fatty acid
  β‐oxidation (FAO). FAO produces acetyl‐CoA (Ac‐CoA), which contributes to sustaining
  the TCA cycle, in conjunction with anaplerotic substrates such as pyruvate, glutamate/glutamine
  or aspartate (as indicated with *). (C) During venous EC‐to‐lymphatic endothelial
  cell (LEC) differentiation, prospero homeobox transcription factor 1 (PROX1), an
  essential transcription factor necessary for LEC differentiation, directly binds
  to the CPT1A gene/promoter, increasing FA mitochondrial import and FAO. This increased
  FAO in LECs is utilized to fuel histone acetylation through the export of citrate,
  where it regenerates Ac‐CoA in the cytosol. This histone acetylation is targeted
  towards lymphatic genes necessary for LEC differentiation, proliferation and migration.
