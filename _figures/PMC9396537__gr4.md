caption: 'Cardiorenal protection of SGLT2 inhibitor based on metabolic reprogramming.
  SGLT2 inhibition leads to marked glycosuria and a net caloric loss, which mimics
  a fasting-like metabolic response. The energy substrates shift from carbohydrates
  to FAs and ketone bodies, which restore ATP levels to exert cardiorenal protective
  effects. SGLT2 inhibitors induce a nutrient deprivation transcriptional paradigm
  via acting on nutrient-sensing pathways. SGLT2 inhibitors activate the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α
  pathway, enhancing FAO and ketogenesis, which improve the energy state of the heart
  and kidney. In addition, the activated AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway exerts other protective
  effects, including improving mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, enhancing autophagy,
  and attenuating oxidative stress. SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit the mTOR pathway and
  thereby improve insulin resistance, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and oxidative
  stress. In addition, inhibition of mTORC1 prevents tubular and podocyte damage,
  partially via the effects of increased ketone bodies on mTORC1. Abbreviations: SGLT2:
