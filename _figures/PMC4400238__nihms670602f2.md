caption: 'The examples in this figure use the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1 for illustrative
  purposes although the concept likely applies to multiple checkpoint ligands. Top:
  Innate immune resistance. In some tumors, constitutive oncogenic signaling, such
  as through activation of the AKT pathway or gene amplification, can up-regulate
  PD-L1 expression on tumor cells independently of inflammatory signals in the TME.
  Bottom: Adaptive immune resistance refers to PD-L1 induction in tumors as an adaptation
  to sensing of immune attack. In adaptive resistance, PD-L1 is not constitutively
  expressed but rather, is induced by inflammatory signals such as IFN-g produced
  by T cells attempting to execute an active anti-tumor response. Expression of PD-L1
  in a non-uniform distribution associated with lymphocyte infiltrates suggests adaptive
  induction in response to immune reactivity within the TME. Adaptive resistance can
  be generated by cytokine-induced PD-L1 expression on either tumor cells themselves
  or on leukocytes (macrophages, myeloid suppressor cells, dendritic cells or even
  lymphocytes) in the TME. Inhibition of tumor specific T cells by PD-L1- (or PD-L2)-expressing
  leukocytes may involve cross-presentation of tumor antigens such that PD-1-dependent
  inhibition is in cis. Adaptive resistance may be a common mechanism for the intratumoral
  expression of multiple immune checkpoint molecules.'
