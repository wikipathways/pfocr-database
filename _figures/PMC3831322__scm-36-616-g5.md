caption: A scheme illustrating potential mechanisms by which nandrolone reduces bone
  loss after SCI. Small arrows indicate the direction of change after SCI. The findings
  of our study suggest that nandrolone increases levels of Wnt3a, LRP5, and Fzd5,
  and activates Wnt-signaling pathway, resulting in an increase in OPG/RANKL ratio,
  thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. These effects of nandrolone are accompanied
  by increases in expression of RunX2 and ENC1, which may act by promoting osteoblast
  differentiation. These effects lead to a protection against bone loss after SCI.
