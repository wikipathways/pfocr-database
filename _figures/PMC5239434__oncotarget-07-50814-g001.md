caption: NADPH can be produced by the isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) IDHl (cytoplasm)
  and IDH2 (mitochondria); the one-carbon cycle enzymes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenases (ALDHlL) ALDHlL1 (cytoplasm), ALDH1L2 (mitochondria) and methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MLHFDlL, mitochondria); the rate-limiting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) at the oxidative branch of the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); and the NADP-dependent malic enzymes MEl (cytoplasm)
  and ME3 (mitochondria). In tum, NADPH is the donor of reductive potential to glutathione
  reductases (GR) and thioredoxin reductases (TrxR), that reduce oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) and oxidized thioredoxins (Txr-S2) to their reduced forms (GSH and Txr(SH)2,
  respectively). Glutathione peroxidases (GPx), glutaredoxins (Grx) and peroxiredoxins
  (Prx) are reduced by GSH, and Prx can also be reduced by Trx(SH)2. Catalase and
  superoxide dismutases (SOD) are autocatalytic enzymes that do not use NADPH as a
  cofactor; however, NADPH binds tightly to catalase, enhancing its activity.
