caption: 'Outline of the biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxins (AFs) and the AF gene
  cluster. (A) The formations of 1-group AFs (AFB1 and AFG1) from VA and 2-group AFs
  (AFB2 and AFG2) from VB. In the biosynthesis of AF, there are pathways for the formation
  of 1-group AFs (AFB1 and AFG1) from VA and 2-group AFs (AFB2 and AFG2) from VB.
  VB is converted to VA, and VA and VB respectively serve as precursors of 1-group
  and 2-group AFs. ver-1 (aflM), ordB (aflX), hypA (aflY), and verA (aflN) genes are
  suspected to be involved in the step from VA to DMST as well as the step from VB
  to DHDMST. dmtA (aflO) gene, which is a homolog of A. nidulans stcP gene, is involved
  in the conversion from DMST to ST as well as the conversion from DHDMST to DHST.
  (B) The structures of STM and DHSTM. STM is the stereoisomer of DMST, and DHSTM
  is the stereoisomer of DHDMDT. (C) The AF gene cluster in the genome of aflatoxigenic
  fungus. Enzyme genes and regulatory gene(s) are schematically shown in an approx.
  70-kb DNA region. verA gene (closed arrow) and each of ver-1, ordB and hypA genes
  (striped arrows), and dmtA gene (open arrow) are indicated. DHDMST: dihydrodemethylsterigmatocystin,
  DHST: dihydrosterigmatocystin, DHSTM: dihydrosterigmatocystin, DMST: demethylsterigmatocystin,
  ST: sterigmatocystin, STM: sterigmatin, VA: versicolorin A, VB: versicolorin B.'
