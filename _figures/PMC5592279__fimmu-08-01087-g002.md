caption: Potential mechanisms of immuostimulatory effects of Coriolus versicolor.
  (A) Detection of polysaccharopeptide (PSP) by TLR(s) (and perhaps other receptors)
  on T lymphocytes initiates signaling cascades, such as the p38 MAPK pathway, leading
  to enhanced T cell proliferation and the release of largely pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. (B) Binding of PSP to any/all of Dectin-1, CR3, or TLRs
  on macrophages leads to the activation of genetic events that increase phagocytic
  activity and induces the production of oxidative radicals and cytokines such as
  tumor necrosis factor-α. (C) Recognition of PSP by the BCR leads to B cell activation,
  clonal proliferation, and eventual differentiation into IgM+ or IgG+ plasma and
  memory B cells. Alternatively, PSP may be acting on B cells in a similar fashion
  to T cells, non-specifically activating them through TLR(s) and leading to a general
  increase in polyclonal IgM and IgG levels (data not shown).
