caption: 'Blue lines represent the genome with DSB sites, and clusters of vertical
  bars indicate the TR region. The DSB ends can be bound by two groups of proteins
  independently: the binding of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex (Ku
  70 and Ku80) and the following ligase IV seals the gap by direct rejoin the broken
  ends, which is termed non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (A); While the binding
  of MRN complex and Exo1 nuclease initiates the 5''-3'' resection of the ends, which
  is followed by either a replication slippage pathway (B) or homologous recombination
  (HR) pathway (C, D). In the replication slippage pathway, the TR region forms a
  secondary structure and leads to mispairing between the template and the newly-synthesized
  DNA strand. In the HR pathway, the 3'' overhang invades into the homologous template
  DNA (red lines) and primes DNA synthesis (dash lines) to form a structure called
  D-loop, which will result in a double Holliday junction (dHJ). dHJ can either be
  resolved by strand cleavage with or without crossover, which is referred as classical
  DSB repair (DSBR) pathway of HR (C), and dHJ can also be dissolved by helicases
  to generate a non-crossover (D). Alternatively, D-loop can be directly dissociated
  through a synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway, which results in
  exclusively non-crossover products (D).'
