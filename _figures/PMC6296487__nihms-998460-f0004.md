caption: There is multi-layer cross-talk between BR and plant immunity pathways. 1.
  Genetic studies indicated that BR and PAMP receptors may compete for common co-receptor
  BAK1, thus enabling BR repression of PTI. 2. Bacterial infection leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of BIK1, which activates RBOH and ROS burst to confer hypersensitive
  response. 3. In the nucleus, BR-activated BZR1 can inhibit PTI-mediated defense
  gene expression through WRKY11/15/18, HBI1 or in collaboration with WRKY40. 4. BZR1
  can also function through JA and GA pathways (directly or through NAC transcription
  factor JUB1) to regulate fungal defense. 5. JUB1 can modulate BR and SA pathways
  to inhibit bacterial defense. 6. In contrast, BES1 is activated by the MAPK pathway
  and plays a positive role in bacterial defense, which involves MYB30, its E3 ligase
  MIEL1 and likely other regulators. 7. Recent studies also suggest that BR signals
  to activate MEK2–SIPK through BRI1 and BSK1, which in turn triggers RBOH to generate
  ROS to confer virus resistance. On the other branch, BES1 inhibits the expression
  of RBOH and thus virus resistance, mediating tradeoffs between BES1-promoted growth
  and virus resistance.
