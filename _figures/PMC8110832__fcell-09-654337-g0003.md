caption: The effect of mannose and pyruvate on cancer cell proliferation. (A) Exogenous
  mannose generates mannose-6-phosphate under the catalysis of hexokinase. High levels
  of mannose-6-phosphate significantly inhibit aerobic glycolysis and pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) by inhibiting the activities of hexokinase, PGI and G6PD, which affects
  lactate production and TCA cycle, resulting in cell growth arrest and chemotherapeutic
  sensitivity. (B) Pyruvate represses histone gene expression by inducing the expression
  of NAD+ biosynthesis enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) via
  myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), which then increases NAD+ levels and activates
  the histone deacetylase activity of SIRT1. Downregulated histone gene expression
  leads to cell cycle arrest and tumor cell growth defects. HKs, hexokinases; G-6-P,
