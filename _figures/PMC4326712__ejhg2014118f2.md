caption: 'Simplified synopsis on the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways and
  their interactions. The signaling cascades start at a receptor tyrosine kinase (e.g.,
  a growth hormone receptor). Shown on the left is the PI3K-AKT pathway, on the right
  the RAS-MAPK pathway. (Some) interactions of the pathways are highlighted by thick
  arrows: activated RAS is known to interact with PI3K, activating its downstream
  signaling. Furthermore, SHP2 (the protein encoded by PTPN11) also interacts with
  the PI3K pathway. The effects are shown in the red boxes: inhibition of apoptosis,
  start of translation, induction of cell proliferation and inhibition of cell differentiation.
  All of these are possible underlying mechanisms not only of MCAP, but also of tumorigenesis.
