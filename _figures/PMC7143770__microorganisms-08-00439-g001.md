caption: Schematic representation of the conserved fatty acids biosynthesis pathway
  based on the Lb. paracasei ATCC334 fatty acids synthesis model. In red are highlighted
  the genes considered in this study. Acc genes (accA, accB, accC, accD) are involved
  in the malonyl-CoA synthesis. Malonyl-ACP Malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (fabD) catalyze
  the coenzyme A substitution with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Malonyl-ACP is condensed
  by 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (fabH) to acetyl-CoA, producing a β-ketoacyl-ACP. Ketoacyl-ACP
  reductase (fabG) starts with a reduction and is followed by a dehydration executed
  by 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP- dehydratase (fabZ). A second reduction by enoyl-ACP-reductase
  (fabK) produces acyl-ACP. In order to continue the elongation reaction, acyl-ACPs
  are dehydrated by 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (fabF) and the elongation chain cycle starts
  again. Once sufficiently elongated, acyl-ACPs are processed by different hydrolytic
  enzymes depending on the chain length. Medium-chain fatty acids (i.e., C:12) are
  released by the esterase activity of the Medium-chain acyl-ACP hydrolase (mch).
