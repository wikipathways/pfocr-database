caption: The mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling branches. mTOR is the catalytic subunit of
  two complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to growth factors, hypoxia,
  low energy, and amino acids. The TSC1–TSC2 complex coordinates the growth factor,
  oxygen, and energy inputs to mTORC1 by negatively regulating the Rheb GTPase, which
  directly activates mTORC1. The Rag-GTP-binding proteins regulate the amino-acid
  input to mTORC1 by an independent mechanism. mTORC1 controls protein synthesis through
  4E-BP1 and S6K1 and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid synthesis while
  inhibiting autophagy by less defined mechanisms. Less is known about mTORC2 signaling.
  Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling activates mTORC2 through the PI3K/PTEN
  pathway, but the mechanism has not been elucidated. When active, mTORC2 phosphorylates
  the AGC kinases AKT, SGK, and PKC, which have multiple functions in controlling
  cell survival, metabolic regulation, and cytoskeletal organization. AGC kinases
  are co-regulated by mTORC2 and PDK1, and the coordinate phosphorylation by both
  is required for maximal kinase activity (PDK1-dependent S6K phosphorylation is not
  shown). Negative feedback loops and crosstalk between both branches of the mTOR
  network have important implications in mTOR-targeted therapy. S6K1 mediates well-known
  negative feedback loops (red) that attenuate PI3K-AKT signaling in response to mTORC1
  activation, the best known being direct phosphorylation and inactivation of insulin
  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). An emerging function for direct negative and positive
  regulation of mTORC2 by S6K1 and TSC1/2, respectively, may contribute to negative
  feedback regulation to ensure AKT signaling is low when mTORC1 is active.
