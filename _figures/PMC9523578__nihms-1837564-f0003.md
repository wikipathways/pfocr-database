caption: Illustration of bacterial effectors that manipulate the plant ubiquitination
  pathway. The action of effectors delivered from Gram-negative bacteria into the
  plant cell cytoplasm through the T3SS or T4SS is depicted. The effectors exert their
  action by acting as E3 ubiquitin ligase with domains RING/U-box or F-box of SCF
  or NEL, SUMO or cysteine protease, that binds with proteasome subunit and interfere
  with signaling pathway. (A) The P. syringae T3E AvrPtoB has U-box/RING- E3 ubiquitin
  ligase activity that mimics plant E3. It has both kinase and E3 ligase activity
  that enable functions in the ubiquitination and degradation of PRRs (FLS2, BAK,
  CERK, EFR) and R proteins (Pto, Fen, Prf). This prevents the downstream MAPK cascade
  and inhibits PTI and degradation of R protein that leads to prevention of ETI. HopZ4
  acts on the 26S proteasome subunit component Rpt6 and thereby preventing SA-mediated
  defense. (B) The R. solanacearum has GALA protein that has LRR and an F-box domain
  that mimic plant E3, thereby promoting disease. (C) A. tumefaciens VirF has F-box
  domain and it mimics SCF E3 ligase that targets the VIP1 and VirE2 proteolysis thereby
  enabling integration of the DNA to promote crown gall. (D) The Rhizobium sp. NopM
  is a NEL family E3 and it reduce the ROS production and NopT effector induces PCD.
  (E) The Xanthomonas sp. harbors many effectors that has been characterized from
  few species. The T3E XopP from Xoo has RING/U-box domain with E3 activity. XcvXopD
  has SUMO protease activity that promotes senescence in plants, XccXopD alters host
  components RGA and interferes with signaling to promote infection. Similarly, Xcv
  AvrXv4 possess SUMO protease activity, Xcv 85–10 XopI with F-box domain was identified,
  and XcvXopL with NEL domain effector and E3 activity has been reported.
