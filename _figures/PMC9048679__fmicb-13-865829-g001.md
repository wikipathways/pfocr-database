caption: Ste5 and associated kinases in the pheromone pathway. (A) Model of the pheromone
  pathway. Pheromone secreted by haploid cells of different mating types binds to
  a G protein-coupled receptor and promotes the release of Gβγ dimer from Gα monomer.
  Ste5 is recruited by Gβγ dimer to the plasma membrane and initiates the activation
  of a kinase cascade. Activated Fus3 is dissociated from Ste5 and stimulates downstream
  mating responses. (B) Schematic representation of domains of ScSte5. Here and elsewhere
  in this paper, a prefix of “Sc” stands for protein or gene of S. cerevisiae.
