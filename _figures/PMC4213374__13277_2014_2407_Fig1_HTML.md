caption: This figure illustrates some of the mechanisms by which CD40L can influence
  on different cell functions and the processes by which these altered cells can impact
  on host immunity in neoplastic diseases. CD40L is present as a membrane-bound form
  (mCD40L), present first of all on T lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+, iNKTc, and NKc), and
  as a soluble form (sCD40L) derived primarily from active platelets. Interaction
  of the ligand with the receptor (CD40) may not only potentiate the anti-tumor immunity
  but also promote the development of cancer. The binding of CD40L with a receptor
  on dendritic cells (DC) leads to the expression of co-stimulatory molecules necessary
  for the correct antigen presentation and protects DC against apoptosis induced by
  factors derived from tumor cells (TC). Moreover, CD40L/CD40 interaction enhances
  the proliferation and maturation of lymphocytes B (B cells) and the production of
  antibodies against the tumor. mCD40L present on various cells induces apoptosis
  of tumor cells via the TRAF-JNK/AP-1-caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway. On the other hand,
  the activation of endothelial cells (EC) may result in enhance TF pro-coagulant
  activity and high expression of VEGF, main mediator of tumor angiogenesis
