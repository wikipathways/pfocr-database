caption: Proposed mechanism of evasion of DENV and DENV-infected cells from classical
  and lectin pathway-mediated complement attack in the host. NS1 protein released
  by DENV-infected cells activates the classical pathway of complement activation
  resulting in the formation of a tri-partite C1S-NS1-C4 complex. C4 undergoes enzymatic
  cleavage forming C4a (anaphylatoxin and chemotaxin) and C4b present in the fluid
  phase becomes susceptible to spontaneous hydrolysis attributing to paucity of C4
  in the circulation (). NS1 recruits C4BP and binds with it leading to subsequent
  recruitment of C4b to engage with the NS1-C4BP complex to allow the ‘stepping-in’
  of factor I. Factor I is a negative regulator of complement activation that cleaves
  C4b into C4c and C4d fragments to limit the classical as well as the lectin pathways
  (). Competitive binding of NS1 to MBL prevents recognition of DENV by MBL that protects
  DENV from neutralization by MBL.
