caption: Polyamine transport and synthesis pathways. Cadaverine is synthesized by
  decarboxylation of lysine by putative lysine decarboxylase (LDC), while CadB serves
  as an antiporter for cadaverine and lysine exchange. Arginine decarboxylation by
  arginine decarboxylase (ADC) generates agmatine, a precursor for putrescine. Enzymatic
  activities of agmatine deiminase (AguA) and carbon-nitrogen hydrolase family protein
  (AguB) convert agmatine to putrescine in two steps or agmatine directly to putrescine
  by agmatinase (SpeB). The conversion of ornithine directly to putrescine by ornithine
  decarboxylase (ODC) is considered to be the main evolutionary pathway of polyamine
  biosynthesis in most organisms, but this gene is not currently annotated in pneumococcal
  genomes (shown in red). Ornithine/arginine antiporter (ArcD) regulates intracellular
  concentrations of arginine and ornithine. Putrescine can be converted to spermidine
  and spermine in sequential steps using decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine [dcSAM,
  catalyzed by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC)] from methionine as a methyl
  donor by the enzymatic activity of spermidine synthase (SpeE). Alternatively, putrescine
  can be converted to carboxyspermidine and spermidine by carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase
  (CASDH) and carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (NspC), respectively. Pneumococcal genomes
  encode a single polyamine transporter (PotABCD) that is predicted to import spermidine
  and putrescine. Polyamine catabolism includes acetylation and thereby sequestration
  by a polyamine acetyltransferase (AT). Polyamine oxidase (APAO) that catalyzes the
  reverse reactions, i.e., generates free polyamines from acetylated forms (and other
  enzymes shown in red), are not annotated in the genome, at present.
