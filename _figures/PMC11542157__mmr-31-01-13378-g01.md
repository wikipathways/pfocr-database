caption: Signaling pathways regulating CMA activity. The calcineurin-NFAT pathway
  was initially reported to be capable of inducing CMA activation in T cells. Furthermore,
  this pathway also regulates CMA activity during T cell activation and proliferation.
  In eukaryotic cells, AMP-activated protein kinase not only regulates autophagy but
  also induces CMA, which leads to the breakdown of lipid droplets by reducing cytoplasmic
  lipase activity. In the context of p38-TFEB signaling, p38, which is a serine/threonine
  kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, phosphorylates TFEB, thereby
  inhibiting its activity. This suppression of TFEB activity inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome
  degradation mediated by CMA, thereby promoting glial cell activation. AKT phosphorylates
  a downstream substrate of mTOR, which in turn activates mTOR. mTOR is known to negatively
  regulate autophagic activity. RARα reduces the levels of lysosomal proteins, thereby
  affecting the interaction between lysosomal proteins Rab11 and Rab, and subsequently
  limiting CMA activity. The figure was generated using Adobe Illustrator 2021, version
