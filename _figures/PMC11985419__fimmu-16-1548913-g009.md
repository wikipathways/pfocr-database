caption: Schematic of ICAM-1-Mac-1 mediated NET formation mechanism in response to
  LPS or LTA. Neutrophils stimulated by LPS or LTA induces an influx of extracellular
  Ca2+, resulting in elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. The interaction between endothelial
  ICAM-1 and neutrophil Mac-1 triggers an undefined signaling pathway. This pathway,
  along with Ca2+, synergistically regulates the citrullination of histone H3, thereby
  promoting NET formation
