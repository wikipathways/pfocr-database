caption: Schematic representation of steps in echinocandin biosynthesis as exemplified
  by proposed pneumocandin biosynthetic pathway in Glarea lozoyensis (). KS, ketosynthase
  domain; AT, acyltransferase domain; DH, dehydratase domain; MT, methyltransferase;
  ER, enoylreductase domain; KR, ketoreductase domain; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  A, adenylation domain; T, thiolation domain; C, condensation domain; CT, terminal
  condensation domain. All reactions have undergone some degree of functional analysis,
  except for GlOXY3 (?), which has been inferred because its gene is present only
  in Leotiomycete clusters encoding echinocandins with hydroxy-glutamine in their
  peptide core. The numbering of the adenylation domains of GLNRPS4 follows the order
  of peptide assembly.
