caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in cancer stem cells. (a) The NF-κB pathway
  (left): TNF-α, the proinflammatory cytokine, binds to the TNF receptor and induces
  the formation of IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκB-a. Phosphorylation of IκB-a
  results in its degradation via proteasome which leads to the accumulation of p65-p50
  (acting as an NF-κB) dimer into the nucleus and regulates the transcription of the
  targeted genes. (b) The TGF-β pathway (middle): TGFβ1 ligand upon binding to the
  TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFβR2) promotes (indicated by black arrows) the dimerization
  of TGFβR2 with TGFβR1, resulting in the transphosphorylation of TGFβR1. The activated
  TGFβR1 further activates R-SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3) by phosphorylation. SMAD2/3 trimerizes
  with a co-SMAD (SMAD4). The SMAD trimer upon localization into the nucleus activates
  (indicated by purple arrows) the gene transcription and promotes cell growth and
  survival. (c) The PI3K pathway (right): the binding of the ligand to the RTK results
  in the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid PIP2 via intracellular PI3K and it
  then converts to PIP3. PKB bounds to its docking site in PIP3, and upon phosphorylation,
  it gets activated by various kinases involving mTOR and DNA-dependent protein kinases,
  which further enhances PKB-mediated phosphorylation and the activation or repression
  of downstream mediators. PTEN, a phosphatase that is a negative regulator (inhibition
  is indicated by red arrows) of this process, helps in the dephosphorylation of PIP3
  to PIP2 (the black arrows are depicting pathway activation/signal propagation).'
