caption: 'Oncogenic Role of H. pylori in Gastric Cancer Pathogenesis: The internalization
  of the CagA protein by gastric epithelial cells triggers chronic inflammation, amplifying
  its carcinogenic effects. Various adhesins enable H. pylori to attach to host cells,
  establishing a Type IV secretion system (T4SS) that translocates CagA into the host
  cytoplasm. Inside the cell, CagA interacts with SHP2 phosphatase or Grb2, activating
  pathways that increase interleukin-8 (IL-8) and stimulate AP-1 via the Ras/Raf/ERK
  cascade(including NK-κB and MAPK pathways). Once activated, ERK translocates to
  the nucleus to phosphorylate ELK1, which, in conjunction with serum response factor
  (SRF), binds to the serum response element (SRE) on DNA, thereby enhancing the expression
  of proto-oncogenes c-Fos and c-Jun, which are essential for cell cycle progression
  and proliferation. In a parallel signaling cascade, cortactin phosphorylation activates
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to further phosphorylation events. Additionally,
  PAR1b inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1) specificity for RhoA,
  thereby activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. This cascade enhances
  cell proliferation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and inflammation, all contributing
  to tumorigenesis'
