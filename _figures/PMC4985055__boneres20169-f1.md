caption: TGF-β signaling in bone. TGF-β is synthesized as a latent protein stored
  in the ECM, whose activation depends on osteoclastic bone resorption. Active TGF-βs
  binds to tetrameric receptor complex comprising two TGF-β types I receptors (TβRI)
  and two type II receptors (TβRII). TβRII transphosphorylases TβRI to induce Smad-dependent
  and non-Smad-dependent signaling. In the Smad-dependent signaling, phosphorylated
  R-Smad (Smad2 or 3) complexes with Smad4 and co-translocates into the nuclei, where
  they recruit co-factors to regulate target gene expression. In the non-Smad-dependent
  pathway, phosphorylated TAK1 recruit TAB1 to initiate the MKK-p38 MAPK or MKK–ERK1/2
  signaling cascade. Smad7 negatively regulate Smad signaling by preventing R-Smad
  phosphorylation, targeting R-Smad for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation with Smurf2
  and inhibiting R-smad/co-Smad complex nuclei translocation. Arkadia positively regulates
  Smad signaling by targeting Smad7 for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation. MAPK phosphorylates
  Runx2 to promote its transcriptional activity while Smad2/3 recruits HDACs to antagonize
  Runx2 activity. TGF-β–Smad signaling promotes proliferation, chemotaxis, and early
  differentiation of osteoprogenitor. However, it inhibits osteoblast maturation,
  mineralization, and transition into osteocyte. It also inhibits osteoclast differentiation
  by decreasing RANKL/OPG secretion ratio, although it promotes osteoclastogenesis
  via directly binding with receptors on the osteoclast. TGF-β, transforming growth
  factor-β.
