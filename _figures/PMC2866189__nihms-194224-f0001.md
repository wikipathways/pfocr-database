caption: Overview of the dynamic interactions of the major RNPs involved in pre-mRNA
  processing, mRNA biogenesis and regulation of gene expression. The nascent transcript
  (pre-mRNA), capped with a 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap, is bound by hnRNP proteins
  and SR (serine-arginine-rich domain-containing) proteins. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
  particles (snRNPs) bind to the splice sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns. The
  spliced introns are excised as lariats, which are then debranched and degraded.
  The exon junction complex (EJC) assembles on spliced mRNA ~20 nucleotides upstream
  of joined exons, followed by the export of the mRNA to the cytoplasm. MicroRNAs
  (miRNAs) in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) bind to target mRNAs
  to regulate translation and mRNA stability. The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) binds
  to the poly(A) tail of cytoplasmic mRNAs. The SR domains are indicated with a star.
  cEJC indicates the remaining stable EJC on mRNA in the cytoplasm, which is removed
  by translating ribosomes.
