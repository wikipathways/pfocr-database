caption: A number of cell surface molecules controls and suppresses T cell activation
  by directly suppressing T cell activation (via CTLA-4 or PD-1), by directly signaling
  the T cell, or indirectly in the case of CTLA4Ig, or regulatory T cells by binding
  to DCs inducing IDO. IDO catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan to kynureine and
  subsequent catabolic byproducts. Local decreases in the availability of tryptophan
  and the presence of its catabolic byproducts inhibit T cell proliferation and may
  induce apoptotic death. Inhibition of clonal expansion leads to a functional state
  of tolerance. This pathway may be accentuated by the presence of IL-10 or TGF-β.
  Regulatory T cells secretion of IL-10 may induce these B7-dependent DC-signaling
  pathways as well.
