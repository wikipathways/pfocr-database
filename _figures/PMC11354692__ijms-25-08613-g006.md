caption: Key genes regulating IAA, ABA, and GA signaling. (A) IAA signaling. (B) ABA
  signaling. (C) GA signaling. Red and blue boxes indicate up- and down-regulated
  genes, respectively. The trunk of the graph represents key genes obtained based
  on the KEGG database. The normalized mean expression of each gene is represented
  by a color cell based on the color scale. All blue backgrounds in the figure represent
  key protein regulatory pathways of signaling pathways
