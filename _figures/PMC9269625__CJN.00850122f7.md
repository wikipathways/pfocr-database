caption: Overview of metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial function in sepsis-associated
  AKI. The principal pathway of energy production in kidney cells switches from oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis in the early stage of sepsis. A functional
  changes in mitochondria in this phase may determine the extent of kidney injury
  in the later stage. Mitochondrial biogenesis through PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)
  and the removal of damaged mitochondrial via mitophagy mediated by the PTEN-induced
  kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PARK2) may allow cells
  to return to using OXPHOS, followed by the recovery from injury. In contrast, abnormal
  mitochondrial dynamics, such as an increase in dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1),
  exacerbate sepsis-associated AKI. In response to the mitochondrial damage, the cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is also activated,
  which accelerates inflammation in kidney cells. Lastly, Szeto-Schiller-31 (SS-31;
  antioxidant) and Mdivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor) have potential as therapeutic drugs for
  sepsis-associated AKI via the attenuation of mitochondrial damage.
