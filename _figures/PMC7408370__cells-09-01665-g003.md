caption: 'Genome editing using designer nucleases (DN): (A) Targeting of the DN to
  the coding region of a gene promotes the formation of a DSB which is typically repaired
  via NHEJ. The subsequent formation of indel mutations (grey box) may generate a
  premature stop codon, eventually leading to gene inactivation. (B) DN can be targeted
  to regulatory elements (RE) in order to disrupt the binding site of an activating
  transcription factor (TF). As a result, downstream gene transcription might be reduced
  or abolished in a cell-specific fashion as described in . (C) Two DNs can be directed
  to sites flanking an exon containing a non-sense mutation for its deletion. The
  resulting gene might result in the generation of a truncated, albeit partially functional,
  protein. (D) Targeting of a DN in proximity of a genetic mutation and simultaneous
  delivery of a donor template harboring the correct genetic sequence might result
  in precise gene editing via harnessing of the homology directed repair pathway.'
