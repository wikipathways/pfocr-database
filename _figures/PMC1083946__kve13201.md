caption: Fig. 1. Overview of pheromone and glucose signalling in S. cerevisiae. The
  putative glucose receptor Gpr1 activates the Gα protein Gpa2, for which no β or
  γ subunits have been identified yet. Rgs2 stimulates the GTPase activity of Gpa2
  and thus inhibits glucose-induced cAMP signalling. Gpa2 is thought to activate adenylate
  cyclase (Cdc35/Cyr1) but direct biochemical evidence for this is still lacking.
  The basal activity of adenylate cyclase also depends on the Ras1 and Ras2 proteins
  of which the signalling function, if any, remains unclear. Activation of PKA by
  cAMP results in stimulation of growth and pseudohyphal differentiation, loss of
  stress resistance, mobilization of trehalose and glycogen and in reduced life-span.
  Pheromone sensing depends on the Ste2 and Ste3 receptors that respectively bind
  α- and a-factor and that transmit the signal to the heterotrimeric G-protein consisting
  of the Gα protein Gpa1 and the βγ subunit Ste4 and Ste18. The RGS protein Sst2 is
  able to diminish signalling by stimulating the GTPase activity of Gpa1. Ste4 recruits
  both the scaffolding protein Ste5 and Ste20 (which can also be stimulated by Cdc42)
  to the membrane resulting in activation of the mating MAP kinase cascade (Ste11,
  Ste7 and Fus3). Activation of the MAP kinase pathway results in growth arrest and
  conjugation.
