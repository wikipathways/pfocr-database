caption: '(A) On mRNAs without downstream exon–exon junctions, UPF1, together with
  eRF1 and eRF3, interacts with SMG1 to form the SURF complex []. The SMG1 regulatory
  SMG8–SMG9 heterodimer and the scaffold protein DHX34 aid in SURF complex assembly,
  subsequent UPF1 phosphorylation, and interaction between the SURF complex and UPF2–UPF3,
  leading to formation of the decay-inducing (DECID) complex and UPF1 phosphorylation
  (right) [,]. Ribosome, eRFs, SMG1 and its regulators may dissociate from the RNA
  at this stage, and hence are shown by more transparent shapes. (B) The exon-junction
  complex (EJC), a key NMD enhancer in vertebrates, when present in 3′-UTRs can recruit
  UPF2/UPF3B to 3′-UTR (left) and facilitate formation of the UPF complex, and hence
  DECID complex formation (right), leading to UPF1 phosphorylation and NMD activation.
  Shapes representing various protein factors are labeled. Yellow circle, phosphate.
  Abbreviations: NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; SURF complex, SMG1–UPF1–eRF1–eRF3;
  UTR, untranslated region.'
