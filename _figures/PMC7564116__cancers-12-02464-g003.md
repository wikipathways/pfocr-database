caption: Functions of circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC). (A) Function as miRNA sponges.
  circ_000984 bears miRNA binding sites for miR-106b-5p. When circRNA is absent, the
  miRNA binds to the miRNA-response elements (MREs) of CDK6 mRNA, leading to decreased
  levels of CDK6 protein and, hence, decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion.
  The presence of circ_000984 impedes this regulation of CDK6 expression by sequestering
  miR-106b-5p. (B) Interaction with RBPs. circACC1 interacts with β and γ subunits
  of PRKAA1 (AMPK), leading to its stabilization and activation. PRKAA1 phosphorylates
  ACC and PFKFB3, leading to increased β-oxidation and glycolysis, respectively. This
  mechanism promotes CRC progression. (C) circRNAs can encode for peptides. circ-LGR4
  encodes for a peptide, which interacts with LGR4 receptor and activates Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, resulting in CRC cell proliferation and invasion.
