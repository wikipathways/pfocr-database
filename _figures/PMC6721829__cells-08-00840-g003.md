caption: 'Mechanistic overview of miRNA-mediated regulation of the stemness of cancer
  stem cells via targeting signaling pathways: miRNAs can act as both suppressive
  and enhancer of stem cells features such as self-renewal, sphere formation, cancer
  relapse, migration, invasion, and chemo- and radiotherapy resistance. Via targeting
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, many miRNAs regulate the stem cell features
  by targeting β-catenin. Upregulation of miR-19, miR-501-5p, and miR-744 stimulates
  the activation of β-catenin. Hence, it is translocated to the nucleus and stimulates
  gene expression. Conversely, upregulation of miR-708-5p and miR-142-3p inhibits
  β-catenin activation and prevents its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Another signaling
  pathway targeted by miRNAs is AKT/PI3K/PTEN. MiR-21, miR-221/222, and miR-106b-5p
  upregulation inhibit the function of PTEN. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-21 and
  miR-23a stimulate the activation of the AKT/PI3K pathway, whereas upregulation of
  miR-128 inhibits its activation. Upregulation of miR-106b is found to act on TGF-β
  through targeting Smad. Downregulation of miR-200c stimulates the activation of
  Notch pathways and, hence, enhances CSC features. Another important signaling pathway
  associated with CSC development is the JAK/STAT pathway. Upregulation of miR-196b-5p
  and miR-500a-3p and downregulation of miR-218 stimulate the activation of STAT3
  molecule. Further, downregulation of miR-136 stimulates CSCs as a result of activating
  various proteins including NF-kB, survivin, cyclin D1, and Bcl2. In addition, upregulation
  of miR-155 activates NF-kB. Taken together, the stem cell features can be stimulated
  or suppressed by miRNA-regulated expression of signaling proteins.'
