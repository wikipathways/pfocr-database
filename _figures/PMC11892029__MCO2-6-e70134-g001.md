caption: The role of BMPR2 and CAV‐1 in PAH. (A) The role of BMPR2 in PH. In PAECs
  and PASMCs, mutations in BMPR2 lead to a reduction in BMPR2 protein levels, disrupting
  the BMP signaling pathway and promoting excessive cell proliferation. Additionally,
  in PAECs, BMPR2 mutations contribute to PH by inhibiting IL‐15Ra expression at the
  cell membrane through disruption of the trans‐Golgi network. Furthermore, in PASMCs,
  reduced BMPR2 levels affect histone methylation, leading to increased NFYA expression,
  which in turn enhances cell cycle progression and glycolytic protein expression,
  further driving pathological remodeling in PH. (B) The role of CAV‐1 in PH. Similarly,
  a decrease in Cav‐1 at the cell membrane in both PAECs and PASMCs contributes to
  the development of PH. In PAECs, the oxidant molecule peroxynitrite, produced by
  NOX1 and iNOS, modifies Cav‐1, leading to reduced calcium influx in vascular endothelial
  cells. This inhibits vasodilation and promotes PH. Additionally, Cavin‐1 competitively
  binds to Cav‐1, reducing BMPR2 levels at the cell membrane, thereby inhibiting its
  downstream signaling and driving vascular remodeling. Vascular injury‐induced shedding
  of MVs and sAB depletes Cav‐1, further decreasing BMPR2 levels. This shedding also
  enhances TGF‐β production by macrophages, contributing to disease progression. In
  PASMCs, activation of PPARγ by the agonist GW1929 requires Cav‐1 and leads to increased
  p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, promoting apoptosis while inhibiting proliferation.
  Moreover, PPARγ activation by GW1929 significantly reduces hypoxia‐induced Cav‐1
  upregulation, establishing a negative feedback mechanism that regulates its expression.
