caption: The role of HH signaling in viral infections. HH pathway is dysregulated
  during infection with a variety of viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis
  C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1), influenza A virus (IAV),
  Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus (KSHV). Most of these viruses induce pathological processes by regulating
  the expression, protein stability, and subcellular localization of GLI proteins
  and other components of HH signaling in HH-responding cells. In contrast, dysregulation
  of HH signaling is triggered in HH-producing cells by ZIKV and in both cells by
  HBV and HCV. In addition, HTLV-1 and HCV employ HH signaling to facilitate viral
  transcription and replication.
