caption: Schematic representation of the lipoxygenase pathway and its inhibitors.
  Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) releases arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) into
  the cytosol from the cell membrane, where they are exposed to oxygenation by different
  lipoxygenases (5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX) to produce intermediate hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (HpETE) and hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HpODE) products. After further
  oxidation, these bioactive products (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroxyoctadecadienoic
  acids (HODES), and leukotrienes) interact with several receptors influencing different
  signaling cascades that are known to be involved in cell cycle, survival, and migration.
  The inhibitors (red text) used in this study aimed to prohibit these LOXs from synthesizing
  their products. FLAP窶認ive LOX-Activating Protein and NDGA窶馬ordihydroguaiaretic acid.
