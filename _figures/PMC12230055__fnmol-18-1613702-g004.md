caption: Visual network mapping of authors and co-cited authors in PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway research in ischemic stroke; (a) network of authors with at least three
  publications generated using VOSviewer. Different nodes in the graph represent different
  core authors and different color bands indicate different collaborative clusters;
  (b) network of co-cited authors with at least 20 citations generated using VOSviewer
  and Pajek. Different nodes represent different co-cited authors, node size is proportional
  to the number of citations, and different color bands represent different clusters
