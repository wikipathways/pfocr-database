caption: The role of liver macrophage in the initiation and progression of liver fibrosis.
  This figure provides an overview of the heterogeneity and plasticity of liver macrophages.
  (A) KCs, located in the hepatic sinus endothelium, can be activated by DAMPs after
  suffering from liver injury, and activated KCs can release macrophage chemokine
  CCL2 to recruit the Ly6Chi subgroup monocytes to the liver. KCs express a variety
  of PRRs, including TLRs, NODs, and RIG-I, which facilitate the effective identification
  and removal of foreign pathogens. KCs can also secrete inflammatory cytokines (e.g.IL-1β
  and TNF-α) to aggravate the damage of hepatocytes. KCs can secrete IL-12, IL-15,
  IL-1β, and AIM, which further recruit and activate NK-T cells. In turn, NK-T cells
  can produce inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, thereby modulating the function
  of KCs and impacting the progression of liver fibrosis. In addition, KCs can regulate
  a variety of metabolic pathways, including the cholesterol and iron metabolism.
  Besides, KCs can remove damaged cells and metabolic waste to maintain the metabolic
  balance. (B) Under the chemotaxis axis, Ly-6Chi subgroup monocytes can be recruited
  to the liver, where they differentiate into proliferating Ly-6Chi subgroup macrophages,
  and these macrophages can secrete TGF-β1 and PDGF to activate HSCs. In addition,
  KCs can also release NLRP3, TGFβ, PDGF, ROS, and RNS, then induce the quiescent
  HSCs activated into myofibroblasts, ultimately secreting ECM and inducing liver
  fibrosis. KCs can also secrete MMP9, which is conducive to the degradation of liver
  ECM. In addition, KCs can promote collagen cross-linking and scar formation by modulating
  the expression of LOXL2
