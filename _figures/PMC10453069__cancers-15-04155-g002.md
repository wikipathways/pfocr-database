caption: ATM- and ATR-mediated pathways in the presence of damaged DNA. (a) The ATM
  signaling pathway responds to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which cause the inactive
  ATM to split into active ATM monomers to start a phosphorylation cascade. This event
  recruits other signaling proteins, such as CHK2 and TP53, to allow for DNA damage
  repair or apoptosis and senescence if the damage is too severe. (b) The ATR pathway
  is activated in times of replicative stress caused by DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs),
  lack of nucleotide bases, and stalls at the replication fork. The subsequent binding
  of replication protein A2 (RPA32) to the replication fork allows a phosphorylation
  cascade of ATR and CHK1 to happen, leading to cell cycle arrest by CDC25-mediated
  CDK1 activation to ensue DNA fidelity. p = phosphorylation
