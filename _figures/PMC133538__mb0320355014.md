caption: Scheme of Hsp27-induced effects on apoptosis. Hsp27 reduces F-actin damage
  induced by apoptotic drugs (e.g., cytochalasin D and staurosporine) and thus attenuates
  the activation of the pathway that links F-actin damages to mitochondria. Activation
  of this pathway induces cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, and procaspase
  activation. The mechanism of activation of this pathway is unknown but may be a
  consequence of altered integrin signaling pathway or changes in F-actin-dependent
  subcellular distribution of members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bid. Hsp27 also
  attenuates cytochrome c release in cells exposed to agents that do not rapidly destroy
  F-actin architecture (e.g., etoposide and Fas), suggesting that other upstream pathways
  are under the control of Hsp27 expression. Hsp27 also acts downstream of mitochondria
  by interfering with apoptosome formation, probably through its binding to cytochrome
  c once it is released from mitochondria. Hsp27 also appears to bind and negatively
  modulate caspase 3. In L929 cells, the upstream activity necessitates a higher level
  of Hsp27 expression (>0.45 ng/μg) compared to the downstream effect which is already
  detected in cells expressing Hsp27 (0.1 ng/μg).
