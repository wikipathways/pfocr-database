caption: 'Proposed mechanism for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. In the figure, β subunits
  in one F1 molecule are labeled β1, β2, and β3. Two configurations of the enzyme
  are sufficient to describe all of the intermediates in the proposed reaction pathway:
  (i) the three-nucleotide structure with T (tight), L (loose), and C (closed) sites
  in the β subunits (I and II, boxed by the green dashed line); and (ii) the two-nucleotide
  structure with T, L, and O (open) sites (III, boxed by the red dashed line). Conformations
  T and T′ of the β subunit are highly similar, but T contains ATP and T′ contains
  ADP plus Pi. Starting with the most stable species (I), ATP synthesis proceeds through
  a proton translocation driven conformational change. This transformation (I to II)
  can occur only with ATP in the T site. Next, ATP is released from the C site which,
  after release, changes to the O conformation. After intermediate III is reached,
  the molecule binds ADP in the O site, which immediately changes to the C-conformation,
  and Pi in the L site becomes species I (but with subunit numbers cyclically permuted).
  The reaction proceeds cyclically through these steps. Note that, in this mechanism,
  in contrast to previous proposals (, , , ), the concerted conformational change
  involving all three β subunits (I to II) occurs in the three nucleotide form of
  the enzyme and does not involve a β subunit in the open conformation.'
