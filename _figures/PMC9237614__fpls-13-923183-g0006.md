caption: DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs in photoperiod and circadian clock pathways. (A) Transcriptional
  trends of DEmRNAs in photoperiod and circadian clock pathway and visualized as heatmaps.
  (B) DEmRNAs targeted by hub-DElncRNAs. Expression profiles of hub-DElncRNAs and
  their target genes related to photoperiod and circadian clock based on the transcriptome
  data. Transcriptional change levels were normalized by log2transformed (FPKM + 1).
