caption: Schematic representation of the Notch signaling pathway. Once synthesized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (①), the inactive single peptide precursor moves to
  the Golgi where it is cleaved by a furin-like convertase (S1 cleavage) (②) and translocates
  into the cell membrane. The binding with a Notch ligand (③) induces the second cleavage
  (S2) by a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAM) family (④), resulting
  in the formation of a membrane-tethered Notch truncated (NEXT) fragment, which is
  further processed in two sites (S3 and S4) by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase
  complex (⑤), generating the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), the active form of
  the Notch receptor (⑥). The NICD can now enter into the nucleus, where it exerts
  its transcriptional activity (⑦). The ubiquitination of the NICD (⑧) leads to its
  proteasome degradation (⑨).
