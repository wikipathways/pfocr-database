caption: MAP kinase signalling pathways. Major pathways that transfer extracellular
  signals to the nucleus are the MAP kinase signalling pathways. The extracellular
  stimuli may be heterogeneous, deriving from exposure of cells to growth factors,
  phorbol esters, cytokines, or cellular stresses, such as osmotic shock and γ-irradiation.
  In principal, the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway transduces mitogenic signals involved
  in cellular proliferation or differentiation. The JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways regulate
  the cellular inflammatory or stress response. There are interactions between both
  pathways on MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) levels immediately upstream of MEK (not
  indicated in the presented scheme). The downstream targets of the MAP kinase signalling
  pathways are the MAP kinases, ERK, JNK/SAPK and p38, which directly or indirectly
  interfere with transcription factors, such as Elk-1, ATF2 or cJun for activation
  of gene transcription. Upstream signalling components include the family of Rho
  GTPases such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42 which interfere with MAPKKK. Cellular stresses
  such as hypoxia may activate JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways which exert influence on
  cJun and ATF-2 activation.
