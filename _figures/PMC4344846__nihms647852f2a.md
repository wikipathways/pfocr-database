caption: 'A, B Canonical Wnt pathway; C, D Noncanonical Wnt pathway. (A) In the resting
  state, nuclear translocation and activation of β-catenin is inhibited by the APC
  destruction complex, which sequesters β-catenin in the cytoplasm and leads to its
  ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The Fzd receptor is also targeted
  for degradation by ZNRF3 ubiquitin ligase []. (B) (i) IQGAP1 regulates β-catenin
  in canonical Wnt signaling. Wnt binds to the Fzd-LRP5/6 receptor complex, recruits
  Dvl, inactivates the APC destruction complex, and β-catenin is stabilized and translocates
  to the nucleus []. (ii) Although not required for canonical Wnt signaling, RSPO
  augments this pathway []. Wnt/RSPO co-stimulation activates LGR4 and clears ZNRF3
  from the cytoplasm, which increases the amount of active Fzd in the Wnt-Fzd/RSPO-LGR4/IQGAP1
  “supercomplex” []. This enhances β-catenin/IQGAP1/Dvl complex formation and facilitates
  the nuclear import of β-catenin in an importin-β5/Ran dependent manner [, ]. Ran-GTP
  hydrolysis releases β-catenin, which interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors.
  (C) The noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates oriented cell movement
  for polarization. Wnt/RSPO increases the association of IQGAP1 with the actin polymerization
  proteins mDia1 and N-WASP and activates the small GTPases Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 to
  promote cell polarity []. This may occur through association of IQGAP1 with Dvl,
  a reported activator of Rho GTPases. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
