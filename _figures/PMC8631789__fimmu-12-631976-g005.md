caption: 'A summary of the events that occurred in a representative old, or female
  patient with decompensated AHB (A) and the proposed T cell interactions in the interleukin
  17 (IL-17)-centered, hepatic destructive pathway (B). (A) The notes in the blue
  frames depict the upregulated (upward arrows) or downregulated (downward arrows)
  cytokines or pathway. sPD-1, soluble programmed death-1; IL-17, interleukin 17;
  INF-γ, interferon gamma; IL4, interleukin-4; IP-10, interferon gamma-induced protein
  10. Words in the frame depicted the hepatic IHC results; CD4, cluster of differentiation
  4; CD8, cluster of differentiation 8; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; Th17,
  T helper 17 cell; Treg, regulatory T cell; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen. Small
  red arrows: upregulation; small blue arrows: downregulation. (B) Black arrow heads:
  stimulation; black blunt ends: inhibition; small red arrows: upregulation; small
  blue arrows: downregulation.'
