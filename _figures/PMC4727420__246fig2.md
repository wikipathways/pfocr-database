caption: Global view of biological processes and molecular functions of HDL proteins.
  Proteins detected in HDL were associated with biological functions using Gene Ontology
  process annotations. This approach demonstrated significant overrepresentation of
  proteins involved in several categories, including lipid metabolism (P = 10−15),
  the immune response (P = 10−6), protease inhibitor activity (P = 10−7), antigen
  processing (P = 10−3), and the acute-phase response (P = 10−5).

  with HDL in reduced cholesterol efflux capacity via the ABCA1 pathway.
