caption: 'The consequences of ATR inhibition and malfunction of the S-phase checkpoint.
  A disrupted ATR/Chk1 pathway does not arrest the cell in the S phase and allows
  cycle progression with under-replicated DNA. This causes the accumulation of SSBs
  and DSBs, fork collapse, and deregulation of the inhibition of late origin firing.
  Moreover, a lack of radical maintenance and inhibition of new RNR synthesis leads
  to the accumulation of HU-induced ROS. The circled images show anaphase aberrations
  detected using Feulgen staining (top) and the accumulation of ROS (H2O2) in the
  cytoplasm in DAB-stained root meristem cells [] (bottom) of Vicia faba subsp. minor.
  The experimental procedure for 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining (to detect H2O2
  by means of DAB polymerization) was as follows: roots of V. faba were submerged
  in Tris-buffered (10 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA-2Na, 100 mM NaCl) DAB-HCl (1 mg mL−1; pH
  7.5) dissolved in distilled water or in 2.5 mM HU (HU-treated plants). Following
  24 h incubation, excised 3 mm root tips were fixed for 45 min in PBS-buffered 4%
  paraformaldehyde (20 °C), washed (3 times) with PBS, and placed in citric acid-buffered
  2.5% pectinase (pH 5.0; 37 °C for 45 min). Digested root meristem cells were washed
  with PBS and squashed onto microscope slides in a mixture of glycerol and PBS (9:1;
  v/v). Production of H2O2 was observed under the microscope as reddish-brown areas
  in the cells (indicated by a black arrow in the circled image).'
