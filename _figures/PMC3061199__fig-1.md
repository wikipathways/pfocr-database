caption: Molecular and cellular alterations involved in neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's
  disease (AD). The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by β-secretase (β)
  and γ-secretase (γ), resulting in the liberation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ).
  Aβ may interact with Fe2+ and Cu+ to generate hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical,
  resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation that generates toxic aldehydes that impair
  the function of membrane Na+ and Ca2+ ATPases (ion pumps). The membrane then depolarizes,
  and glutamate receptor channels (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor) and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) open and Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm.
  Aβ may also form Ca2+-permeable pores in the plasma membrane; the interaction of
  Aβ with the plasma membrane may be facilitated by binding to phosphatidylserine
  (PtdS). Aβ may also act directly on mitochondria to induce superoxide anion radical
  (O2•−) production, Ca2+ overload, and decreased ATP production. Amyloidogenic APP
  processing prevent α-secretase (α) cleavage of APP, which normally generates an
  activity-dependent secreted form of APP (sAPPα) that engages a signaling pathway
  involving cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that activates K+ channels, thereby
  hyperpolarizing the membrane and reducing Ca2+ influx and free radical production.
  Amyloidogenic processing also generates an intracellular APP domain (AICD) that
  can translocate to the nucleus and modify gene transcription in ways that perturb
  redox and Ca2+ homeostasis. Presenilin-1 (PS) functions as a Ca2+ leak channel in
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and PS mutations may impair this Ca2+ leak channel
  function resulting in excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the ER and enhanced Ca2+
  release through ryanodine receptor (RyR) and IP3 receptor (IP3R) channels. There
  is also evidence that PS can interact directly or indirectly with RyR and smooth
  ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) to alter ER Ca2+ release and uptake. Altogether, the cascade
  of events described here first impairs synaptic transmission and may ultimately
  kill neurons in AD. Modified from Bezprozvanny and Mattson (). For interpretation
