caption: Adenosine production and signaling pathway. Following cell death or cellular
  stress, ATP is rapidly released into the extracellular space through mechanisms
  such as vesicle exocytosis, ABC transporters, pannexin-1, connexins, and P2X7R.
  Extracellular ATP can then activate P2X and P2Y receptors or be converted into adenosine
  via the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. The enzymatic action of CD39 can be reversed
  by AK and NDPK. Adenosine can also be produced via the CD38-CD203a-CD73 pathway.
  In addition to ectonucleotidases, alternative membrane-bound phosphatases, including
  TNAP and PAP, can contribute to adenosine generation. Once generated, extracellular
  ADO can bind to P1 receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR, and A3R), be degraded to inosine
  by ADA, or be transported into the intracellular space through equilibrative or
  concentrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs and CNTs, respectively). ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ABC, ATP-binding
  cassette; AK, adenylate kinase; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; TNAP, tissue-non-specific
  alkaline phosphatase; PAP, prostatic acid peptidase; ADO, adenosine; ADA, adenosine
  deaminase; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase
