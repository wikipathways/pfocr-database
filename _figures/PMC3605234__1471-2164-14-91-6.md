caption: Schematic summary of the C. cacaofunesta mitochondrial proteome survey. (A)
  Detailed representation of a hypha, including the nucleus and the mitochondria.
  (B) Nuclear – mitochondrial communication represented by the protein import (predicted/identified
  by LC-MS/MS). In the mitochondria are represented proteins involved in pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and tricarboxylic acids cycle (TCA). Also, are represented
  aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH); hypothetical proteins; novel proteins and proteins
  encoded in mtDNA. (C) Zoom of the mitochondrial subcompartments. Proteins involved
  in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and polypeptides with probable role in pathogenicity
  are depicted. Cytochrome-dependent respiratory chain components (complexes I to
  V); alternative respiratory pathway including alternative NADH (NADH alt) and alternative
  oxidase (AOX); glutathione S-transferases (GST); ATP-binding cassette transporters
  (ABC) and protein homologous to mitochondrial carrier of Fussarium oxysporum (FOW1).
