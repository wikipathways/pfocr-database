caption: (a) Major pathways of glucose metabolism. Hexokinase uses ATP to phosphorylate
  glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) in the first irreversible step of the glycolytic
  pathway. Glc-6-P regulates hexokinase activity by feedback inhibition [], and it
  is a ‘branch-point’ metabolite that has alternative metabolic fates. Glc-6-P can
  continue down the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate that can then be used
  in mitochondria by oxidative metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  It can also enter the pentose phosphate shunt pathway (PPP) to generate NADPH for
  management of oxidative stress and precursors for nucleic acid biosynthesis, and,
  in astrocytes, it is a precursor for glycogen. Most of the glucose carbon derived
  from the PPP re-enters the glycolytic pathway downstream of Glc-6-P. The glycolytic
  pathway produces a net of 2 ATP per molecule of glucose and oxidation of pyruvate
  via acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) in the TCA cycle produces about 30 ATP for a
  total of about 32 ATP. Formation of pyruvate from glucose requires regeneration
  of NAD+ from NADH produced by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction
  by the malateaspartate shuttle (MAS). NADH cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane,
  and the MAS transfers cytoplasmic NADH to the mitochondria where it is oxidized
  via the electron transport chain (ETC). When glycolytic flux exceeds that of the
  MAS or the TCA cycle rate, or during hypoxic or anoxic conditions, NAD+ is regenerated
  by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction that converts pyruvate to lactate. Because
  intracellular accumulation of lactate would cause reversal of the LDH reaction,
  lactate must be released from the cell by monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT).
  Exit of lactate eliminates pyruvate as an oxidizable substrate for that cell and
  limits the ATP yield per glucose to two. (b) Three models for the fate of lactate
  generated in brain from blood-borne glucose or astrocytic glycogen. The astrocyte-to-neuron
  lactate shuttle (ANLS) was proposed on the basis of glutamate-evoked increases in
  glucose utilization and lactate release by cultured astrocytes (reviewed in []).
  In brief, the model states that Na+-dependent uptake of neurotransmitter glutamate
  from the synaptic cleft by astrocytes generates a demand for 2 ATP in astrocytes,
  one to extrude Na+ and one to convert glutamate into glutamine in the glutamate-glutamine
  cycle (). The model states that this ATP is generated by the glycolytic pathway
  and is associated with release of lactate from astrocytes and its uptake by nearby
  neurons where it is oxidized. Thereby astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling is linked
  with the glutamate-glutamine cycle and excitatory neurotransmission. Thus, during
  brain activation glycolytic upregulation is stated to occur in astrocytes, with
  astrocyte-derived lactate providing the major fuel for neurons. The neuron-toastrocyte
  lactate shuttle (NALS) is based on kinetics of glucose uptake into brain cells in
  response to increased metabolic demand and different model assumptions compared
  with the ANLS []. Here, glucose is predicted to be predominantly taken up into neurons
  due to their high energy demand and the higher transport rate of the neuronal glucose
  transporter, GLUT3, compared with the astrocytic glucose transporter, GLUT1 [].
  Lactate is posited to be generated by neurons and taken up by astrocytes. The lactate
  release model [] is based on the observed mismatch between total glucose utilization
  and oxidative metabolism and measured lactate release from brain during brain activation
  in vivo. If lactate were produced and locally oxidized, total and oxidative metabolism
  would be similar in magnitude. However, the rise in oxidative metabolism varies
  with experimental condition and pathways stimulated, it is much less than that of
  total glucose utilization []. Astrocytes have a much faster and greater capacity
  for lactate uptake from extracellular fluid, and for lactate dispersal among gap
  junction-coupled astrocytes compared with neuronal lactate uptake and shuttling
  of lactate to neurons []. Astrocytic endfeet surround the vasculature, and can discharge
  lactate to perivascular fluid for efflux from brain.
