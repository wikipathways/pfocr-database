caption: Hypothetical pathway linking the mitochondrial function, OMI/HTRA2, apoptosis,
  and intracellular cholinergic signaling. The well-documented presence of nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the mitochondrial outer membrane defines all
  eukaryotic cells as cholinoceptive cells and acetylcholine, the main known endogenous
  ligand of these receptors, as a universal intracellular signaling molecule. (1)
  As a matter of fact, biosynthesis of ACh is directly linked to mitochondrial glycolysis
  and citric acid cycle. In mitochondria, glucose converted to pyruvate, and thereby
  production of acetyl-Coenzyme A (A-CoA) [], (2) which is partly used in the citric
  acid cycle for generation of bioenergetic molecules such as ATP, and (3) the rest
  may enter into the cytoplasm for instance for biosynthesis of ACh by ChAT, which
  is apparently required for activation of the mitochondrial nAChR (mt-nAChR). (4)
  The mt-nAChRs and their regular activation by intracellular ACh may hence function
  as a biodynamic sensor. For instance, in favorable conditions, a high access to
  glucose is sensed due to production of ACh and activation of mt-nAChRs, (5) thereby
  preventing auto processing of the mitochondrial serine protease OMI/HTRA2, (6) which
  could otherwise lead to activation of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
  [, ]. Certain conditions, such as ongoing pathological processes (like those occurring
  in the AD brain) or other stressful stimuli, may either cause mitochondrial dysfunction
  and/or greatly limit mitochondrial access to glucose and production of pyruvate,
  leading to diminished synthesis of A-CoA and thereby ACh. Indeed, there are direct
  links between ACh and insulin secretion [], and/or insulin resistance and Alzheimer’s
  disease [], glucose metabolism [], as well as mitochondrial dysfunction []. In such
  circumstances, a hypothetical pathway is that as a mean to maintain protective action
  of ACh through mt-nAChRs [, ], the reduced cytosolic A-CoA induces (7) translocation
  of ChAT into the cell nucleus, where ChAT somehow will participate in modulation
  of gene expression of various key proteins []. (8) Two of these key proteins are
  most likely nAChR and ChAT itself. This could explain the positive correlation between
  OMI/HTRA2, nAChR, and ChAT reported in the current study (Figs.  and ). In other
  words, an increase in the nAChR levels will enhance the possibility of activation
  of the receptors even at reduced levels of intracellular ACh, while an increase
  in ChAT levels could reflect an attempt to increase ACh biosynthesis. This may work
  if the cause is not a reduced access to pyruvate, and thereby a severe depletion
  of A-CoA, but rather excessive degradation of ACh. This latter scenario may be caused,
  for instance, by certain stress stimuli, known to shift the ACHE gene transcription
  in favor of the soluble stress-associated read-through AChE splice variant (AChE-R)
  [–], which could result in excessive degradation of the intracellular ACh. The observed
  positive correlation between OMI/HTRA2 and the stress-associated AChE-R variant
  support this latter notion. However, when such preventive measures (totally or partially)
  fail to normalize the intracellular ACh-signaling, OMI/HTRA2 mitochondrial serine
  protease (perhaps together with cytochrome C) is expected to be released into the
  cytoplasm, initiating apoptosis cascades []. This explains our finding of higher
  levels of activated OMI/HTRA2, and its cytoplasmic dispersion in the AD brain compared
  to control (Fig. ). The association of OMI/HTRA2 with BuChE may be related to the
  same phenomenon occurring in non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, in which the
  intracellular BuChE may replace the AChE-R variant since BuChE in the brain is known
  to have mainly astroglial origin
