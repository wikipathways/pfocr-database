caption: Figure 1. Key role of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase GlmS for bacterial
  cell envelope synthesis. (A) The hexosamine pathway in Enterobacteriaceae. This
  pathway generates UDP–GlcNAc from Fru6P and glutamine (Gln) in four sequential reactions
  catalyzed by enzymes GlmS, GlmM, and GlmU. UDP–GlcNAc is the dedicated precursor
  for biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides. GlmS catalyzes synthesis
  of GlcN6P, which is the key reaction. If available, various amino sugars can be
  taken up and converted to GlcN6P, bypassing the need for GlmS. GlcN6P can also be
  recycled from degradation of peptidoglycan. Degradation by enzyme NagB allows utilization
  of GlcN6P as nitrogen and carbon source. (B) Origin and fate of the glmUS transcript
  in E. coli. Genes glmU and glmS are co-transcribed from two promoters. In the absence
  of external amino sugars, promoter P1 is activated by transcriptional regulator
  NagC increasing transcription rates 3-fold. The glmUS co-transcript is processed
  by RNase E generating monocistronic mRNAs that are usually rapidly degraded. Upon
  GlcN6P depletion, the glmS mRNA can be stabilized by base-pairing with sRNA GlmZ
  enhancing GlmS synthesis.
