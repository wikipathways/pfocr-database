caption: 'Notch and Eph / ephrin signaling pathways of non-myelinating oligodendrocytes
  relative to corresponding ones of their myelinating counterpart. Edge types are
  the same as in . (A) This network illustrates three aspects of Notch signaling (asterisk):
  1, (large arrow) up-regulation of ASCL1 / MASH1; 2, (arrowhead) increased expression
  (> 13-fold) of HES5; 3, (small arrow) enhanced transcription of lipocalin-prostaglandin
  D2 synthase (L-PGDS). Inset – an OTMP+/L-PGDS+ pN-OLG demonstrating that the L-PGDS
  protein is synthesized by these cells. (B) The canonical pathway for the Eph / ephrin
  tyrosine kinases was used to highlight A2B5+/OTMP+ transcripts relative to the O4+
  transcripts. Small arrows point to the up-regulated EphA receptors. Arrowhead signals
  the ephrin B receptor. Asterisks denote the G-coupled CXCR4 receptor and its ligand
  CXCL12 / SDF-1, which together with ephrin B may play a role in cell migration.'
