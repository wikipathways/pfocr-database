caption: The solid edges shows the known pathway, for sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  to threonine, containing 11 reactions, ranked third in our results. The dashed edges
  show how the shortest pathway containing 10 reactions differs. Compound nodes are
  ovals, mapping nodes are boxes and reactions are diamonds.
