caption: 'Proposed working model: POPX2 regulates the TAK1-IKK-NF-κB pathway during
  DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. DNA damage stimulates the activation and translocation
  of ATM to the cytosol, which promotes the formation of a complex containing TRAF,
  TAK1 and its binding proteins. TAK1 is activated as a consequence. Activated TAK1
  then activates downstream signaling pathway through the IKK complex resulting in
  upregulation of NF-κB-mediated transcription for anti-apoptotic genes. POPX2, by
  acting directly on TAK1, impedes the activation of TAK1. As a result, downstream
  anti-apoptotic activities in response to DNA damage are inhibited'
