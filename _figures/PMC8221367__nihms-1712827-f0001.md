caption: (A) In the absence of Wnt ligands (left), intra-cytoplasmic β-catenin is
  sequestered in the “destruction complex”, which consists of the scaffold protein
  Axin2, APC, GSK3β, and CK1. This complex phosphorylates β-catenin marking it for
  ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Wnt ligand binding to its
  receptor complex (right), comprised of the Fzd receptor and the LRP 5 and 6 co-receptor
  proteins, leads to recruitment of the destruction complex to the cell membrane followed
  by its disassembly and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. At this stage,
  β-catenin translocates into the nucleus where it displaces the transcriptional repressor
  proteins Groucho/TLE and binds to the nuclear Tcf1/Lef1 proteins to activate gene
  transcription. (B) Schematic view of long (p45) and short (p33) Tcf1 protein isoforms.
  The β-BD (red), HDAC (orange), and in HMG (blue) domains are depicted.APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; CK1, casein kinase 1; Fzd, frizzled;
  LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins; TLE, transducin-like Enhancer
  of split; Tcf, T cell factor; Lef, Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; β-BD, β-catenin
  binding domain; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HMG, high-mobility group.
