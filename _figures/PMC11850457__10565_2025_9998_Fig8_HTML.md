caption: Schematic illustration of engineered hucMSC-sEV and mechanisms in modulating
  macrophages and treating cisplatin-induced AKI. Engineered hucMSC-sEV were prepared
  though electroporation with miR-13896 mimic. These modified hucMSC-sEV exhibited
  protective effects against cisplatin-induced AKI. Mechanically, miR-13896 was found
  to inhibit Tradd/NF-κB pathway and promote macrophages shifting from M1 to M2 phenotype
  to alleviate inflammation. (The figure was created by Figdraw)
