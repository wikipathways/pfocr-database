caption: Intracellular crosstalk between brassinosteroid signalling and plant immunity.
  BAK1, BIK1, BSK1 and BSU1 are signalling components of both the BR–BRI1 and flg22–FLS2
  ligand–receptor pairs. BR binding to BRI1 and BAK1 results in release of BIK1 from
  BRI1 and activation of the BRI1–BAK1 complex. BSK1 and CDG1 are activated through
  phosphorylation by the receptor complex. BSK1 or CDG1 activates BSU1, which, in
  turn, inactivates BIN2 by dephosphorylation and proteasomal degradation mediated
  by the F-box protein KIB1, allowing the dephosphorylated BZR1 and BES1 to enter
  the nucleus and induce BR-dependent gene expression, which modulates growth and
  development. After flg22 recognition, FLS2 and BAK1 bind and activate BIK1 and BSK1
  through phosphorylation. Phosphorylated BIK1 dissociates from the FLS2–BAK1 complex
  and activates the respiratory burst oxidase protein D (RBOH), leading to a burst
  in ROS production, whereas BSK1 triggers downstream MAPK components. Notably, the
  MAPK pathway, which is mediated by MAPKKK3 or MAPKKK5 (MAPKKK3/5) during plant immunity,
  antagonizes the stomata developmental pathway that is mediated by YDA by competing
  for the downstream MAPK kinases (MKKs) upon BR perception. BZR1 and BES1 might play
  distinct roles in plant immunity. BR-activated BZR1 negatively affects immunity-related
  gene expression, directly, through HBI1 or in association with the WRKY transcription
  factor WRKY40. BZR1 also functions as a positive regulator of JA-activated defence
  genes that are associated with defence responses against insects and necrotrophic
  pathogens. In contrast, BES1, a direct substrate of MPK6, plays a positive role
  in microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP)-induced gene expression and antagonizes
  jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated plant defence responses. MAMP-triggered defence reduces
  the expression of the HBI1 gene and the BR biosynthetic genes. P circled in orange
  and green indicates phosphorylation events triggered by BR and flg22, respectively,
  and circled Ub denotes ubiquitylation. For convenience, not all known signalling
  components are shown. This figure was created with BioRender.
