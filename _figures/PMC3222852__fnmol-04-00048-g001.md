caption: GSK3 plays pivotal roles in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal
  polarization. Neuronal polarization process begins by breaking cell symmetry, which
  is thought to be initiated by local activation of intracellular signaling in the
  nascent axon. Symmetry-breaking signals might involve confined activation of cell
  surface receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine
  kinases, in the growth cone of the future axon. Several lines of evidence suggest
  GSK3 as a crucial node molecule of the initial symmetry-breaking pathways, such
  as the protein kinase A (PKA)–LKB1 pathway, the PI3K–partition defective protein
  (Par) pathway, and the Wnt–disheveled (Dvl) pathway. Local activation of symmetry-breaking
  signals leads to the reorganization of cytoskeletal elements, thereby establishing
  neuronal polarity. GSK3 might serve as a key molecule in the coordination of cytoskeletal
  elements by controlling microtubule dynamics and assembly via regulation of several
  microtubule-binding proteins (MBPs). Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK)
  has also been suggested to function downstream of the Par complex to control neuronal
  polarization by regulating MBPs. Once the symmetry is broken, maintaining the selective
  extension one neurite – the future axon – can be controlled by multiple mechanisms,
  including local protein synthesis and degradation, and selective transport mechanisms.
  GSK3 has been implicated in the local protein synthesis pathway by controlling the
  activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex via phosphorylating
  tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), but the exact roles of the players involved and their
  regulation in the context of axon growth await to be determined. Local protein degradation
  through activation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is another possible
  mechanism to maintain asymmetrical accumulation of polarity proteins. Molecules
  that control GSK3 activity, such as Akt, PAR3/6, and LKB1, have been suggested as
  targets of the local degradation process. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests
  that protein levels of multiple downstream substrates of GSK3 are controlled by
  phosphorylation-dependent proteolytic degradation. Future studies are required to
  determine whether GSK3 activation in dendrites plays a part in maintaining the polarized
  growth of the axon and restricting the growth of the dendrites by controlling local
  protein degradation. Finally, selective delivery of membrane and cytoskeletal components
  and signaling proteins into defined compartments is an important mechanism to maintain
  neuronal polarity. GSK3 phosphorylates several motor proteins and polarity proteins
  to control their selective transport and localization. See text for further details
  for each of the mechanism depicted in the figure.
