caption: Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways. S-adenosyl methionine (S-AdoMet)
  is synthesized from methionine by the SAM synthetase, it is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid (ACC) by the ACC synthase (ACS), 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) being a by-product.
  MTA is recycled to methionine through the Yang Cycle by successive enzymatic reactions
  involving different intermediates among which 5-methylthioribose (MTR) and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate
  (KMB). S-AdoMet is also the precursor of the spermidine/spermine biosynthesis pathway.
  Ethylene production results from the ACC oxidation catalyzed by the ACC oxidase
  (ACO) that also generates carbon dioxide and cyanide. Malonylation of ACC to malonyl-ACC
  (MACC) reduces ACC content and consequently ethylene production. Ethylene can stimulate
  its own biosynthesis, by improving ACC synthesis catalyzed by ACS, and conversion
  to ethylene by ACO. Ethylene binds to receptors (among which ethylene receptor 1,
  ETR1) located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which leads to the deactivation of the
  receptors that become able to recruit CTR1 (constitutive triple response). Release
  of CTR1 inhibition allows EIN2 to act as a positive regulator of ethylene signaling
  pathway. EIN2 acts upstream of nuclear transcription factors, such as EIN3 (ethylene
  insensitive), EILs (EIN3-like), ERBPs (ethylene responsive element binding protein),
  and ERFs (ethylene response factor). → and —∙ arrows indicate positive and negative
  interactions between the different elements of the signaling cascade, respectively.
