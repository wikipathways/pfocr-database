caption: Insulin signaling. (A), activation of the insulin receptor by binding of
  insulin to the α-subunits of its receptor, initiates autophosphorylation of the
  intracellular portion of the β-subunits, resulting in the recruitment and phosphorylation
  or receptor substrates such as IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4 Shc proteins. Shc
  activates Ras-MAP pathway, culminating in proliferation. IRS proteins activate the
  PI3K-AKT pathway, the signal of which is transmitted to promote translocation of
  GLUT4 and glucose transport into the cell. (B), the binding of fetuin-A to the extracellular
  portion of beta subunit attenuates tyrosine kinase signaling, resulting in reduced
  glucose transport and hence a possible source for insulin resistance.
