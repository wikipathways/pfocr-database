caption: Overview of biotinylated miR-182-5p pull-down-predicted targets involved
  in the DNA damage response pathway genes involved in different canonical pathways
  underlying the DNA damage response, including the G2M cell cycle checkpoint, BRCA1-dependent
  HR-mediated pathway, cyclins and role of cell cycle regulators, role of CHK proteins,
  and ATM signaling. (Dark gray) miR-182-5p targets identified by biotin pull-down.
  These canonical pathways were found to be significantly enriched compared with 10
  random gene lists of similar size using IPA (P-value < 0.02).
