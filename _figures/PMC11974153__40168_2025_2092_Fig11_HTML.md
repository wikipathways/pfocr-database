caption: Mechanisms of PDCoV infection alleviation by FMT. The fecal microbiota suspension
  from 90-day-old healthy pigs were transplanted into 3-day-old piglets, which could
  maintain the intestinal physical barrier, characterized by reduced levels of DAO
  and D-Lac in serum and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the intestine of 3-day-old
  piglets infected with PDCoV, and maintain the intestinal chemical barrier, characterized
  by the increased the number of intestinal goblet cells, the expression of MUC2 protein,
  and the thickness of the mucus layer. FMT significantly enhanced arginine metabolism,
  which may be related to that gut microbiota can reduce the inflammatory response
  induced by PDCoV by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κb signaling pathway.The mechanisms
