caption: The BMP pathway in cardiomyocyte differentiation. The BMP signaling cascade
  begins with the binding of BMP ligands to type I and II transmembrane receptors.
  Phosphorylation of the receptors leads to the phosphorylation of SMADs, which then
  interact with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus to promote gene expression.
  Phosphorylated SMADs also phosphorylate p38 from the MAPK signaling pathway, which
  in turn phosphorylate ISL1 and prevent proteasomal degradation of ISL1, resulting
  in ISL1 translocation into the nucleus to turn on cardiomyocyte-specific genes.
  Additionally, Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates, NKX2.5, and the phosphorylated
  active NKX2.5 interacts with SMAD4 to translocate NKX2.5 into the nucleus to turn
  on cardiomyocyte-specific genes. Created with BioRender.com
