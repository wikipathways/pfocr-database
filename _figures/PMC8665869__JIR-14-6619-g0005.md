caption: A schematic diagram depicting the proposed signaling mechanism via which
  Rg1 can exert its neuroprotection effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia
  pyroptosis. Following LPS stimulation, phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) translocates
  into the nucleus and binds to the promoters of related genes such as AIM2 inflammasome.
  AIM2 transcription is initiated and forms inflammasome complexes with ASC and pro-caspase-1.
  Activated caspase-1 mediates the maturation of IL-1β, and the cleaved N-terminal
  of GSDMD triggers pyroptosis. However, phosphorylation of STAT3 enhanced the expression
  of NLRP3. NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1 are assembled into inflammasome complexes
  and mediate microglia pyroptosis. Rg1 disrupts the pathway and protects against
  LPS-induced microglia pyroptosis and inflammatory response through inhibition of
  STAT3 signaling.
