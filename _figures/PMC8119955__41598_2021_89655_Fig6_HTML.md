caption: Illustrative diagram for exosome-mediated transfer of therapeutic resistance
  in the RCC microenvironment by the clinically approved KTZ. Exosome act as intercellular
  messengers that give the ability to communicate between both cells of the same type
  and other cell types. The exosome cargoes contain nucleic acids (miRNAs, DNAs, and
  RNAs), proteins (cytoplasmic proteins, tetraspanins, and membrane receptors), and
  lipids (ceramides, and cholesterol). The exosomes secreted from cancer cells can
  affect the local tumor microenvironment, alter the extracellular matrix, and enhance
  the drug resistance, cancer cell growth, metastasis, and immune escape. The initial
  steps of this process are usually modulated by the endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport (ESCRT) dependent or ESCRT independent pathway, and then the mechanisms
  involved in the release of exosomes are also regulated by other protein families,
  such as Rab GTPases such as Rab27a and Rab27b. The inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway
  by KTZ leads to transcriptional downregulation of Alix, nSMase, and Rab27a. A inhibition
  of exosome biogenesis and secretion relative proteins, and the inhibition of cyclin
  D1 by KTZ are decreased the tumor growth of RCC as well as sunitinib resistant cancer
  cells. (EE) early endosome; (LE), late endosome; (MVB), multivesicular bodies; (ESCRT),
  endosomal sorting complex required for transport.
