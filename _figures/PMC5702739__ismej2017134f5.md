caption: 'Conceptual model for establishment and maintenance of cyanobacteria on feathermoss.
  A putative time-line includes the following steps: (1) moss releases NO into the
  environment, which is sensed by the heme NO-binding protein (H-NOX) fused with associated
  histidine kinase (HK), (2) cyanobacteria respond with reactive nitrogen species
  mediation by the secretion of flavorubredoxin (F) and FG-GAP repeat-containing protein
  (G) as chemical cues to the host and other cyanobacteria, (3) NO signaling pathway
  triggers hormogonia differentiation (hrm locus) and gas vesicle formation (gvp locus),
  (4) chemotaxis and motility (ptx, pix and hmp loci and pil and hsp loci, respectively),
  (5) cyanobacteria colonize the moss and differentiate into vegetative stage, (6)
  the host signals to the cyanobacteria through NO for spatial localization and re-direction
  of the hormogonia, (7) increased NO signaling induces biofilm formation to favor
  host–symbiont NO-mediated communication and enhance currency exchange, (8) production
  of aliphatic sulfonate (AS) compound and transfer from the host to the cyanobacteria.
  The cyanobacteria provide N as amino acid (AA) to the moss. Newly described loci/function
  are in bold.'
