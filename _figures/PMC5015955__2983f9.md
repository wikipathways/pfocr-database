caption: Diagram indicating the proposed regulation for activation/inhibition or nonconnection
  between rlmA and mpkA and the cell wall biosynthesis genes during cell wall stress
  induced by CR. midA is the mechanosensor primarily involved in sensing cell wall
  stress induced chitin-binding agents such as CR. The connection with the CWI pathway
  PkcA/Bck1-Mkk2-MpkA epistatic module is mediated by the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor rom2 and the Rho GTPase rho1, which are involved in MpkA phosphorylation.
  The blue boxes indicate genes that respond to CR and are thus transcriptionally
  regulated. The green boxes indicate genes grouped in the category of poor/nonresponders
  to CR that results in limited or no transcriptional responses to CR. The orange
  boxes represent the negative responder genes (down-regulated) to CR. The symbols
  (+) and (−) shown in green or red indicate a regulatory consequence of rlmA and/or
  mpkA in positively or negatively regulating (respectively) transcription of target
  genes. Curved arrow indicates the positive feedback regulatory effect of rlmA in
  maintaining the MpkA phosphorylation during the CR-induced cell wall stress. Dashed
  lines indicate additional hypothetical signaling transduction mechanism. This diagram
  is based on data from this article (, , , and ), , ,  and . CR, congo red; CWI,
  cell wall integrity.
