caption: Involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) in neuropsychiatric disorders.
  UPR is a major pathway in protein quality control in cells including neurons and
  is characterized by signaling cascades in the ER, mediated by the protein sensors,
  PERK, IRE1α, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Activation of PERK by
  autophosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α
  (eIF2α), reducing the synthesis of critical synaptic proteins in neurons that affects
  memory processes and synaptic plasticity associated with intellectual disability,
  cognition, and addiction (Trinh et al., ; Placzek et al., ). PERK/eIF2α has also
  been linked to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and mutant
  Neuroligin3 induced UPR and to anxiety-like behavior and GABAergic neuron damage
  in the amygdala (Ulbrich et al., ; Trobiani et al., ). IRE1α upon activation dimerizes
  and auto-phosphorylates which activates its kinase and RNase domain. The RNase domain
  further performs the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA, resulting in spliced
  XBP1 mRNA that translates into a potent transcription factor, XBP1s (Uemura et al.,
  ). XBP1 polymorphism in its promoter region has been associated with, Schizophrenia
  (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and depression (Kakiuchi et al., ; Watanabe et al.,
  ; Grunebaum et al., ). XBP1s also upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) that is a major factor involved in synaptic plasticity in health and disease.
  Activation of Protein kinase A (PKA) via cyclic AMP by different agents in the brain
  can in turn influence IRE1α (Saito et al., ). Inhibition of IRE1α ameliorated the
  social behavior deficits, a commonly observed trait in some neuropsychiatric disorders
  (Crider et al., ). Upon UPR induction, ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi apparatus
  for further processing by Site-1 and Site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P, respectively),
  leading to the release of amino-terminal fragment ATF6f with transcription factor
  functions. The expression of a mutant CASPR2 associated with ASD was shown to increase
  ATF6 (Falivelli et al., ; Canali et al., ). The precise role of ATF6 signaling in
  neuropsychiatric disorders warrants further investigations.
