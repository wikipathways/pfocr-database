  Ethylene signaling involves ethylene receptors [ethylene response 1 (ETR1), ethylene
  response sensor 1 (ERS1), ETR2, ethylene insensitive 4 (EIN4), and ERS2], the negative

  the EIN3/EIL1-HLS1 module (; ; ; ). Ethylene inhibits hypocotyl elongation by activation
  of ERF1 pathway, upregulation of WDL5 expression, and downregulation of PGX3 expression
