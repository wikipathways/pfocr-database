caption: E2s participate in the NF-κB pathway. (A) T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation
  promotes the binding of SLP-76 and UBE2I and increases the SUMOylation of SLP-76.
  SLP-76 and UBE2I synergize to augment TCR-mediated IL2 transcription by nuclear
  factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in a manner dependent on SUMOylation of SLP-76
  []. (B) Under the action of the stimulation signal, IκBα will rapidly undergo phosphorylation
  modification under the stimulation of IKK. IKK contains two catalytic subunits,
  IKKα and IKKβ, and one regulatory subunit IKKγ []. In the classical pathway, IKKβ
  phosphorylates IκBα and is then recruited into the SKP1/CUL1/F-box protein (SCF)
  complex via βTrCP containing the F-box domain. βTrCP contains a WD40-repeat domain,
  which can specifically bind to two phosphorylated serine sites on the N-terminus
  of IκBα []. The RING domain contained in ROC1 can recruit E2 and to polyubiquitinylate
  phosphorylated IκBα, so that it is degraded by the 26S proteasome and “releases”
  NF-κB into the nucleus []. (C) In the non-classical pathway, activation of the pathway
  was suggested to depend on receptor-induced TRAF3 degradation and stabilization
  of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) []. TRAF3 physically associates with NIK via a specific
  sequence motif located in the N-region of NIK and ubiquitinates NIK to stabilize
  it with UBE2D []. CD40 and B cell activativing factor belonging to the TNF family
  (BAFF) of the tumor necrosis factor (TNFR) superfamily activate NIK selectively,
  and then NIK phosphorylates and activates IKKα. Activated IKKα catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of the two Ser sites at the C-terminus of the p100 precursor protein, and the phosphorylated
  modified p100 is recognized by the SCF-βTrCP complex []. The proteasome only degrades
  the C-terminus of p100 that contains ankyrin repeats, but does not affect the N-terminus
  (that is, the p52 subunit) containing the rel-homology domain (RHD) []. Then, p52
  combines with RelB to form a dimer, which promotes the expression of target genes
  that can mature and activate B cells [].
