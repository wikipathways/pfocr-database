caption: 'Phytohormonal signalling networks mediating plant HS response. The ABA signalling
  pathway evokes the ABA-mediated HS response through activation of downstream HSFs
  (e.g., HSFA6b), which then stimulate HSPs expression. The expressed HSPs invigorate
  photosynthesis and protein homeostasis under HS conditions, consequently leading
  to improved HS tolerance. Additionally, ABA mediates HS tolerance in a nitric-oxide
  (NO)-dependent manner, whereby the respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), H2O2
  and NO-transduced HS signals regulate osmolytes accumulation and antioxidant enzyme
  activities. In addition, ABA modulates the levels of carbohydrates and energy status
  via accelerated transport and enhanced metabolism of sucrose to enhance plant HS
  tolerance. Meanwhile, sucrose alone may act as a regulatory signal and/or provide
  energy, thereby contributing to HS tolerance. However, ABA has been shown to inhibit
  brassinosteroids (BRs) functioning in HS response. BRs activate HSPs through BR-controlled
  transcription factors such as Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1), EMS-Suppressor
  1 (BES1), Brassinazole Resistant 1 (BRZ1) and phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs,
  e.g., PIF4, PIF7, etc.). BES1 may also evoke the heat shock response pathway mediated
  by ABA-repressed PP2 C-type phosphatases. BZR1 and PIFs, as regulated by BRs, play
  critical roles in auxin-mediated thermomophogenesis, by regulating the expression
  of auxin-biosynthesis genes, via auxin-responsive factors (ARFs). The YUCCA8 (YUC8)
  and Transport Inhibitor Response 1 (TIR) also play central regulatory roles in this
  BR-Auxin signalling pathway. Meanwhile, the chromatin-modifying enzyme Histone Deacetylase
  9 (HDA9) mediates histone deacetylation at YUC8 nucleosomes to promote H2A.Z depletion,
  which then allows for the binding of the transcriptional regulator, e.g., PIF4 to
  YUC8 promoter. Conversely, light/thermo- receptors Crytochrome 1 (CRY1) and Phytochrome
  B (PhyB) suppress the HS-induced activation of PIFs and the expression of auxin-responsive
  genes. In addition, BR-mediated HS tolerance has pointed to a crosstalk that possibly
  exists among BRs with ABA and SA signalling pathways, through these hormones sharing
  similar transcriptional targets. Salicylic acid (SA) is known to trigger HSFs, which
  then activate HSPs to restore protein homeostasis, thereby inducing HS tolerance.
  Additionally, SA increases reactive oxygen species (especially H2O2) accumulation,
  which triggers the activation of antioxidant enzymes, consequently improving HS
  tolerance. Furthermore, SA enhances proline biosynthesis resulting in increased
  antioxidant enzyme activities and maintenance of photosynthetic activity under HS
  conditions. Exogenously applied jasmonic acid (JA) increases the accumulation of
  jasmonates such as methyl jasmonate, 12-oxophytodienoic acid and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile),
  which activate the antioxidant defense system, consequently leading to HS tolerance.
  Meanwhile, JA and SA have exhibited cross-linkage, while JA and ET are antagonistic
  in their HS response regulation. Ethylene (ET)-mediated signalling involves ET modulating
  the transcript levels of HSFs (e.g., HSFA1a and HSFA2a, b, etc., which then stimulate
  ET-signalling-related genes (e.g., Ethylene Insensitive 2, Ethylene Insensitive-Like
  1, Ethylene Insensitive-Like 2, etc.). Meanwhile, auxin plays a critical role in
  HS-induced thermomorphogenesis. Note: Arrows depict positive regulation while lines
  with blunt ends indicate inhibition or negative regulation. Other abbreviations
