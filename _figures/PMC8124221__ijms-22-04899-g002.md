caption: EGFR/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibitory molecules used in preclinical
  and clinical studies for glioma therapy. Upon binding to its ligand or genetic alterations,
  EGFR is activated and triggers a series of cascade reactions. Among these reactions,
  the phosphorylation and the consequent activation of the ERK pathway and the PI3K/mTOR
  axis regulate cell growth, proliferation, motility, survival, transcription, and
  protein synthesis. Many molecules have been developed and employed targeting EGFR,
  PI3K, and mTOR proteins. Recently, mTOR inhibition by Torin1 and AZD8055 has been
  shown to mediate EGFR internalization and its delivery to lysosomes in GBM cells
  []. This image was created with BioRender software.
