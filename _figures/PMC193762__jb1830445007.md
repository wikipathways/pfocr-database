caption: Model of the C-signal transduction pathway. The signaling event in the pathway
  is the interaction between C signal exposed on the surface of one cell and the hypothetical
  C-signal sensor on a second cell. Starvation results in a RelA- and (p)ppGpp-dependent
  transcription of the csgA gene and in the accumulation of the intercellular A signal
  as well as in the induction of sdeK transcription. Moreover, starvation results
  in a RelA-independent inhibition of todK transcription. The A and E signals induce
  transcription of fruA (, ). C-signal transmission activates csgA transcription,
  possibly by activating the proteins in the act operon (), and FruA, conceivably
  by stimulating the activity of the cognate FruA histidine protein kinase (labeled
  HPK); subsequently the phosphoryl group is transferred from the kinase to FruA.
  Phosphorylated FruA—directly or indirectly—alters the activity of the Frz signal
  transduction system in such a way that aggregation is induced. In addition phosphorylated
  FruA activates transcription—directly or indirectly—of C-signal-dependent genes,
  here exemplified by the dev operon. The possible sites of action of the SdeK kinase
  and the TodK kinase are indicated by the shaded box (see text for explanation).
  All the components in the cell to the right are also present in the cell to the
  left; for simplicity, only csgA is shown in the cell to the left.
