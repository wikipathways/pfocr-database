caption: Glycoengineering mAbs for enhanced sialylation and glycan-targeted ADC production.
  (A) Cells can be supplemented with ManNAc or analogs (e.g., Ac4ManNAc or 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc),
  which intercept and increase flux through the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway with
  the indicated relative efficiencies (“R.E.” values) increasing sialylation of recombinant
  glycoproteins, such as mAbs. (B) Alternatively, cells can be supplemented with analogs
  containing non-natural chemical moieties (e.g., Ac4ManNAz or 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAz to
  install azide groups or Ac46-Thio-Fuc to install thiols). These functional groups,
  which do not naturally occur in glycans, constitute chemical handles for conjugation
  to small molecules including drugs, toxins, or imaging agents.
