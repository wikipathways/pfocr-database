caption: Schematic representation of the effect of Triolein on brain damage after
  ischemic stroke. Triolein, as demonstrated in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery
  occlusion (MCAO/R) through the Suture-Occluded Method, exhibited notable efficacy
  in reducing cerebral infarction size and facilitating the recovery of neurological
  function. Mechanistically, Triolein activated the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, further
  inhibited the autophagy process, inhibited the release of inflammatory factors,
  decreased the polarization of M1 microglia, and increased the survival of HT22 cells.
  The observed effects were found to be partially counteracted by the administration
  of GSK-690693 and Bafilomycin A1. Created with BioRender.com
