caption: (Top) Basal overexpression of Dsg2 drives activation of various signaling
  cascade, but not overexpression of c-Myc, presumably leaving the epidermis primed,
  but unperturbed. Additionally, there is increased epidermal and dermal uPAR expression.
  (Bottom) During wound healing, uPAR can be shed and processed from the keratinocytes
  membranes as soluble uPAR (suPAR) and the D2D3 fragment, respectively. uPAR can
  also be shed via exosomes after shuttling through the endosomal sorting pathway;
  both mechanisms increase dermal uPAR concentration and promote matrix remodeling
  and wound resolution. Through uPAR-mediated signaling, Dsg2 potentiates expression
  of pro-migratory laminin-332 in the regenerating basement membrane.
