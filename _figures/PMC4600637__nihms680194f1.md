caption: '(A) CDC42 signaling pathways that regulate the contribution of F-actin to
  dendritic spine structure. The activity of CDC42 is inhibited by ARHGDIA, a guanine
  nucleotide dissociation inhibitor that suppresses intrinsic GTPase activity. CDC42-CDC42EP
  pathway: Activated CDC42 inhibits CDC42 effector proteins (CDC42EP), which dissociate
  the complex of septin filaments consolidated by SEPT7 in the spine neck. This opening
  of the septin barrier permits an influx of molecules from the parent dendrite that
  facilitate F-actin mediated growth of spines in response to excitatory inputs. CDC42-PAK-LIMK
  pathway: CDC42 activates p21-activated serine/threonine protein kinases (PAK), which
  in turn activate LIM domain-containing serine/threonine protein kinases (LIMK).
  Activation of this cascade inhibits the cofilin family of actin depolymerizing proteins
  that regulate the turnover of F-actin required for structural stability of spines.
  Arrows indicate activation and blunted lines indicate inhibition of each target.
  (B) Subjects with schizophrenia exhibit up- or down-regulation for multiple components
  of the CDC42-CDC42EP and CDC42-PAK-LIMK pathways in DLPFC deep layer 3 pyramidal
  cells. Solid short arrows next to transcript indicates reported evidence in this
  paper; open short arrows indicate previously reported evidence (, ). (C) Predicted
  functional consequences in schizophrenia of altered CDC42 signaling pathways in
  DLPFC deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Higher levels of ARHGDIA would directly inhibit
  the activation of CDC42 holding it in an inactive GDP-bound state. CDC42-CDC42EP
  pathway: The effect of higher levels of ARHGDIA would be amplified by the combination
  of lower levels of CDC42 and higher levels of CDC42EPs, impairing the transient
  opening of the septin barrier in spine necks in response to excitatory inputs, and
  thereby suppressing the influx of molecules into the spine head required for spine
  growth and maintenance (). CDC42-PAK-LIMK pathway: The combination of higher levels
  of ARHGDIA mRNA, lower levels of CDC42 mRNAs and lower levels of PAK mRNAs (Given
  the much higher expression levels of PAK1 than PAK3, the down-regulation of PAK1
  and PAK2 is predicted to have the dominant effect.) would all converge to increase
  phosphorylation (inactivation) of cofilin family proteins and suppress actin depolymerization,
  resulting in F-actin destabilization and spine loss. The up-regulated levels of
  LIMK1/2 and PAK3 may represent compensatory, but inadequate, responses to mitigate
  the negative impact on F-actin dynamics of the upstream molecular pathology in this
  pathway.'
