caption: 'Schematic representation of the planar cell polarity pathway. In this pathways
  two receptor complexes are formed at the opposite sides of a cell: On one side,
  frizzled forms a complex with Flamingo/Celsr, disheveled (Dvl), and Diego/Diversin,
  whereas the other side the complex consists of Flamingo/Celsr, Van Gogh/Vang, and
  Prickle. The extracellular parts of these complexes interact, thereby controlling
  the cellular polarization via activation of JNK/p38 MAPK, small GTPase and Rho-associated
  kinase (ROCK) signaling. Although the role of Wnt in this signal transduction cascade
  is only partially understood, this protein may interfere with the Vangl1-FZD interaction.
  This could subsequently disturb the balance between the signaling of the Vang1/Prickle/Celsr
  complex and the FZD/DVL/Diego/Celsr complex.'
