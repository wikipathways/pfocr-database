caption: 'Mechanisms of cardiovascular dysfunction in diabetes: role of superoxide
  and peroxynitrite. Hyperglycemia induces increased superoxide anion (O2•−) production
  via activation of multiple pathways including xanthine and NAD(P)H oxidases, cyclooxygenase,
  uncoupled nitric oxide synthase (NOS), glucose autoxidation, mitochondrial respiratory
  chain, polyol pathway, and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). Superoxide
  activates AGE, protein kinase C (PKC), polyol (sorbitol), hexosamine, and stress-signaling
  pathways leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin
  II (Ang II), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and NAD(P)H oxidases, which in turn generate more
  superoxide via multiple mechanisms. Hyperglycemia-induced increased superoxide generation
  may also favor an increased expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) through the
  activation of NFκB, which may increase the generation of nitric oxide (NO). Superoxide
  anion may quench NO, thereby reducing the efficacy of a potent endothelium-derived
  vasodilator system. Superoxide can also be converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
  by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and interact with NO to form a reactive oxidant peroxynitrite
  (ONOO−), which induces cell damage via lipid peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes
  and other proteins by oxidation and nitration, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) among others. Peroxynitrite also acts on mitochondria [decreasing the membrane
  potential (Ψ)], triggering the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome
  c (Cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). These factors mediate caspase-dependent
  and caspase-independent apoptotic death pathways. Peroxynitrite, in concert with
  other oxidants (e.g., H2O2), causes strand breaks in DNA, activating the nuclear
  enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). Mild damage to DNA activates the
  DNA repair machinery. In contrast, once excessive oxidative and nitrosative stress-induced
  DNA damage occurs, overactivated PARP-1 initiates an energy-consuming cycle by transferring
  ADP-ribose units (small red spheres) from NAD+ to nuclear proteins, resulting in
  rapid depletion of the intracellular NAD+ and ATP pools, slowing the rate of glycolysis
  and mitochondrial respiration, and eventually leading to cellular dysfunction and
  death. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers,
  generating free PAR polymer and ADP-ribose, which may signal to the mitochondria
  to induce AIF release. PARP-1 activation also leads to the inhibition of cellular
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity, which in turn favors
  the activation of PKC, AGE, and hexosamine pathway leading to increased superoxide
  generation. PARP-1 also regulates the expression of a variety of inflammatory mediators,
  which might facilitate the progression of diabetic cardiovascular complications.
