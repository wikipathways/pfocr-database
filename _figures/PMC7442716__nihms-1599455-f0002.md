caption: HSD3B1 encodes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isotype 1 (3βHSD1) in peripheral
  tissues including the breast, placenta, prostate, and skin. 3βHSD1 is required for
  the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal steroid, to androstenedione
  in a rate-limiting step. Androstenedione may subsequently be converted to downstream
  androgens including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the androgen synthesis
  pathway. HSD3B1(1245A) encodes 3βHSD1 protein that readily associates with autocrine
  motility factor receptor (AMFR), an ubiquitin ligase that targets protein for endoplasmic-reticulum-associated
  degradation (ERAD). This results in a low concentration of intracellular 3βHSD1
  protein and limits the conversion of DHEA precursor steroids to downstream androgens.
  Given this effect, we refer to HSD3B1(1245A) as the adrenal-restrictive allele because
  its inheritance limits the production of potent sex steroids from adrenal precursors.
  In contrast, HSD3B1(1245C) encodes a missense version of the 3βHSD1 protein that
  weakly interacts with AMFR, a property that confers resistance to ERAD. As a consequence,
  3βHSD1 accumulates intracellularly and facilitates a greater flux of DHEA metabolites
  into the distal portion of the androgen biosynthesis pathway. We therefore refer
  to HSD3B1(1245C) as the adrenal-permissive allele because its inheritance enhances
  the metabolism of adrenal precursors to potent sex steroids, enriching production
  of androgens and estrogens in the periphery.
