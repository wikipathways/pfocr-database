caption: Mechanism of PB2 on the protective effect in liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis
  is mainly initiated by the activation of HSCs. The injured liver tissues can release
  Hh ligands to activate the Hh pathway, leading to the activation of HSCs, ECM deposition
  and angiogenesis during liver fibrosis. In the current study, PB2 directly inhibited
  the Hh signalling pathway, therefore down‐regulating the transcription of VEGF‐A,
  HIF‐1α, α‐SMA, Col‐1 and TGF‐β1 in HSCs to suppress the activation, ECM production
  and angiogenesis of HSCs, leading to the reversal of liver fibrosis

  via the Hedgehog pathway during liver fibrosis.
