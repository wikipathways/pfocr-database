caption: Metabolic pathways dysregulated in pancreatic cancer. The GLUT-1 transporter
  is upregulated in PDAC, which increases glucose uptake and glycolysis and promotes
  the flux of their intermediates into other metabolic pathways, such as the PPP.
  Glucose is metabolized into pyruvate, which feeds into the TCA cycle. Metabolic
  reprogramming of tumor cells restructures the TCA cycle and produces a high amount
  of lactate. The dysregulated FAS pathway contributes to the generation of building
  blocks for membrane synthesis. The fatty acids produced are oxidized via FAO to
  Acetyl CoA, which feeds back into the TCA cycle to generate NADH and NAD+ and stimulates
  the electron transport chain to produce more ATP for the PDAC cells. In PDAC cells,
  both oxidative and non-oxidative phases of the PPP are upregulated to generate NADPH
  for scavenging ROS and nucleotides for DNA synthesis. Amino acid metabolism feeds
  into the TCA cycle to meet the high metabolic demands of the tumor cells. Red represents
  upregulated metabolites and green represents dysregulated metabolic pathways. PDAC,
  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; GLUT-1, glucose transporter 1; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; FAO, fatty acid oxidation;
  NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; U, upregulated.
