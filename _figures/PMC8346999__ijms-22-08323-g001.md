caption: The classical Arg/N-degron pathway. N-degrons are classified as type 1 or
  type 2 according to the residues exposed by proteases such as Endoprotease and MetAP.
  Asn, Gln, and Cys are tertiary destabilizing residues (in the light-yellow box),
  converted into secondary destabilizing residues, Asp, Glu, and oxidized-Cys (in
  the light-green boxes), respectively, and finally become type 1 Arg N-degrons through
  ATE1-mediated arginylation (C* denotes the oxidized N-terminal cysteine residue).
  Cysteine is oxidized by typical ROSs and the recently reported ADO (ROSs, reactive
  oxygen species; ADO, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) dioxygenase).
