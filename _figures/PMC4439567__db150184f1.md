caption: Distinct TGF-β–dependent signaling pathways cause characteristic glomerular
  changes in DN. TGF-β signaling pathways can be divided into the canonical (activin
  receptor-like [ALK] 5–mediated) and the alternative (ALK1-mediated) pathways. The
  canonical pathway has been shown to cause several downstream end points of DN, including
  mesangial ECM deposition and GBM thickening, but, conspicuously, not albuminuria.
  Based on a new study by Fan et al. (), the alternative pathway is likely a distinct
  mediator of TGF-β–induced foot process effacement and albuminuria. Reproduced, in
  part, from Jefferson et al. ().
