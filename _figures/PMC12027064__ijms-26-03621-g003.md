caption: Schematic representation of the microbiota-induced expression of MMPs in
  ECM remodeling during IBD and CRC. In IBD, Bacteroidetes mainly produce acetate
  and propionate, while Firmicutes generate butyrate. SCFAs regulate MMP expression
  in IBD; propionate and butyrate reduce IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3
  secretion, while lactate suppresses TNF-α-induced MMP-9 via GPR81, preserving intestinal
  barrier integrity. Butyrate inhibits NF-κB activation, reducing ECM degradation,
  though prolonged low-dose exposure increases pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 alongside TIMP-1
  and TIMP-2, preventing active MMP-2 formation. In CRC, LPS, a key component of Gram-negative
  bacteria like S. marcescens and E. coli, contributes to IBD by activating the TLR-4/NF-κB
  pathway, leading to gut barrier dysfunction and promoting CRC. Elevated MMP-9 levels
  disrupt tight junctions, increasing intestinal permeability. This figure was created
