caption: Schematic model for the regulation of axon regeneration by BRC-1–BRD-1. Under
  normal conditions, BRC-1–BRD-1 is localized in the nucleus. In response to axon
  injury, PKA phosphorylation of BRC-1 Ser-266 induces the translocalization of BRC-1–BRD-1
  to the cytoplasm. The BRC-1–BRD-1 complex poly-ubiquitylates DGK-3, resulting in
  its degradation. BRC-1–BRD-1 enhances the EGL-30 signaling pathway to promote axon
  regeneration.
