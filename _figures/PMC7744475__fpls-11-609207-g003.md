caption: 'Chaperone-mediated folding of viral glycoproteins in the ER. Following translation,
  the nascent protein enters into the ER through the translocon pore (SEC61) and is
  glycosylated by the membrane-bound oligosaccaryltransferase complex. Processing
  of the glycan by α-glucosidase I (GI), to remove the outermost glucose residue,
  enables recognition by Malectin. The removal of a second glucose yields a monoglucosylated
  structure that is the substrate for the lectin binding chaperones: calnexin (CNX)
  and calreticulin (CRT). These chaperones recruit other folding partners, such as
  the oxidoreductase ERp57, to support glycoprotein folding. Once the glycoprotein
  is appropriately folded the final glucose is removed by GII to release the protein
  from the CNX/CRT folding cycle. The glycoprotein can then traffic into the Golgi
  apparatus for further modifications, including proteolytic cleavage and glycan maturation.
  In contrast, aberrantly-folded glycoproteins are reglucosylated by UDP:glucose glycoprotein
  glycosyltransferase (UGGT) causing their retention in the CNX/CRT folding pathway
  for another round of chaperone-mediated folding. Terminally misfolded proteins are
  eventually targeted for Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) to prevent
  misfolded proteins progressing through the secretory pathway. A single glycan is
  depicted for simplicity.'
