caption: 'Mechanisms of SOCS action. Schematic representation of the mechanisms by
  which SOCS proteins negatively regulate cytokine receptor signaling via the JAK/STAT
  pathway. (A) Competitive binding. SOCS proteins bind to phosphorylated tyrosine
  residues on the cytokine receptor via their SH2 domain, thereby preventing docking
  of STAT (and other) proteins and so inhibiting their subsequent activation. (B)
  Degradation. SOCS proteins bind through their SH2 domains to phosphorylated target
  proteins such as receptor-associated JAK proteins (left) or receptors themselves
  (right), subsequently assembling components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex:
  elongins B and C binding to the BC box and Cullin 5 binding to the Cul box located
  within the SOCS box. Other components of the complex such as Rbx2 and E2 are assembled
  through interactions with Cullin 5. Ubiquitin molecules are transferred from the
  ligase to the target protein substrates, which signals their degradation along with
  that of associated proteins within the complex. (C) Inhibition of kinase activity.
  Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 utilize their SH2 domain to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine
  residues on either JAKs (left) or receptors (right), respectively. Both then directly
  inhibit JAK kinase activity via their KIR domain.'
