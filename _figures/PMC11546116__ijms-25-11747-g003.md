caption: Vascular regeneration after MI. Hypoxia triggers vascular regeneration in
  the damaged heart tissue. Hypoxia Inducible factor (HIFs) stimulate the production
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the degradation of
  the basement membrane, allowing the migration of ECs and the recruitment of stem/precursor
  cells. In particular, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), cardiac progenitor cells
  (CPCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited to the site of injury, where
  they release a variety of pro-angiogenic factors and miRNAs. These signals stimulate
  pre-existing endothelial cells (ECs) to differentiate into tip and stalk cells,
  which drive the sprouting of new blood vessels. Additionally, the EPCs themselves
  are stimulated to differentiate into mature ECs, contributing directly to the formation
  of new vasculature. These mechanisms are mainly regulated by the DLL4/Notch signalling
  pathway driven by cytokines such as interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10) (as described
  in Section 4.2. paragraph). In the final stages, pericytes are recruited to stabilise
  and mature the newly formed vessels, ensuring proper vascular function in the healing
  heart
