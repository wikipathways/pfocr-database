caption: Canonical pathways generated in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of interferon
  signaling pathway of DEGs in (A) T helper cells, (B) T cytotoxic cells, (C) monocytes,
  and (D) B lymphocytes of infected goats at 9 dpi. Genes that were upregulated are
  shown in red and downregulated in green. The intensity of red and green corresponds
  to an increase and decrease, respectively, in Log2 fold change. Genes in gray were
  not significantly differentially expressed and those in white are not present in
  the dataset but have been incorporated in the network through the relationship with
  other molecules by IPA. Symbol shape indicates gene function.
