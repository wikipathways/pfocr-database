caption: Big ET-1 is cleaved to ET-1 by endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) in endothelial
  cells. ET-1 binds its specific receptors ETA and ETB with differential effects.
  Binding of ET-1 to ETA or ETB on smooth muscle cells leads to vasoconstrictive and
  proliferative effects. ETB are transiently expressed on endothelial cells after
  birth; binding of ET-1 to ETB on endothelial cells leads to down regulation of ECE
  activity and increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) which
  lead to vasodilation and anti-proliferation. Reproduced from [], with permission.
