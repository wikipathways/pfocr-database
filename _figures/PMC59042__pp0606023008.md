caption: MoR catalytic cycles for its FeCN and Cyt c reductase activities. A, FeCN
  reductase reaction of MoR. B, Cyt c reductase reaction of MoR. MoR is represented
  by the bar and its cofactors with their redox state shown for each reaction step.
  Note that the heme-Fe of MoR remains oxidized during the FeCN reductase reaction.
  The numbering of the rate constants is based on the Cyt c reductase reaction since
  it has more steps. The inner cycle where NAD+ remains bound to the enzyme during
  oxidation by the electron acceptor is probably the preferred pathway. Thus, the
  rate constants in the outer cycle, which are for events also taking place in the
  inner cycle, are shown with corresponding primed rate constants. At the end of the
  outer cycle, MoR is fully oxidized and the enzyme is ready to begin another cycle,
  which is shown by circling the MoR representation to simplify the graphic.
