caption: Mutations in six genes (TLR3, UNC93B1, TRIF, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3), all
  involved in the TLR3 signaling pathway, have been found in HSE patients. TLR3, UNC93B1,
  and TRIF are specifically involved in TLR3 signaling. TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 are
  also involved in signaling of other RNA and DNA sensors (RIG-I, MDA5, and cGAS).
  TLR3 signaling is initiated by the recognition of dsRNA, inducing activation of
  the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways via TRIF, leading to the production of IFN-α/β and/or
  IFN-λ. TLR3, UNC-93B, TRIF, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 deficiencies are associated with
  impaired IFN-α/β and/or IFN-λ production upon stimulation of TLR3 or infection with
  HSV-1. A mutation in the gene encoding IRF3 is described in the paper by Andersen
  et al.
