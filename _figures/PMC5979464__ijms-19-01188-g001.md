caption: The major neuroendocrine and autonomic pathways that regulate secondary immune
  organs are illustrated. They include two neuroendocrine pathways, (1) the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis (HPA) and (2) the sympatho-adrenal medullary (SAM) axis, and two “hardwired”
  autonomic circuits, (3) the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and (4) the parasympathetic
  nervous system (PaSNS). (1) The HPA axis is a feedback system whereby corticotropin-releasing
  hormone (CRH) is released from neurons in the hypothalamus that project their axons
  into the anterior pituitary. The release of CRH stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH) into the circulation. ACTH stimulates the release of corticosterone
  (CORT) into the bloodstream. Circulating CORT has systemic effects including effects
  on secondary immune organs or tissues (Spleen, lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid
  tissue (GALT) are shown in the illustration). (2) In the SAM axis, preganglionic
  sympathetic neurons secrete acetylcholine in the adrenal medulla, which stimulates
  the release of catecholamines, predominantly epinephrine (EPI) and, to a much lesser
  extent, norepinephrine (NE), into the circulation, such as the HPA axis. Circulating
  NE/EPI can potentiate the actions of sympathetic nerves acting at adrenergic receptors
  in immune organs. (3) The SNS circuit to the spleen and LNs is a two-neuron chain
  (green neurons), with preganglionic cholinergic sympathetic neurons innervating
  postganglionic neurons whose nerve terminals end in the spleen and lymph nodes.
  The major neurotransmitter of postganglionic neurons is norepinephrine (NE). In
  secondary lymphoid organs, such as LNs and spleen, NE binds to adrenergic receptors
  expressed on immune cells, vasculature and connective tissue cells. Ligand binding
  to adrenergic receptors regulates the cellular responses of the immune cells that
  express these receptors. The predominant adrenergic receptor subtype expressed on
  spleen cells is the β2-adrenergic receptor. (4) The PaSNS is also a two-neuron chain
  (yellow neurons) of efferent nerves that supply the viscera, in particular the gut.
  Preganglionic neurons reside in the brainstem (medulla) and exit the central nervous
  system (CNS) as cranial nerves that end upon postganglionic neurons, most often
  embedded in the visceral organs they supply. Depicted here is the parasympathetic
  supply to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). There is no definitive evidence
  that the PaSNS innervates the spleen, but the vagus nerve clearly can influence
  immune responses in the spleen—most likely via the migration of vagally influenced
  immune cells in the gut that migrate to the spleen. The up or down arrows shown
  next to these regulatory pathways indicate the most common direction of change in
  the activity of that pathway in most of the prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory
  diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
