caption: Changes in transcripts related to phenylpropanoid metabolism in response
  to aphid feeding in susceptible plants. A subset of the phenylpropanoid pathway
  is shown, with enzyme abbreviations in gray font. Each circle represents a soybean
  gene and its microarray result is depicted by its color hue, color saturation, and
  size. Genes whose results meet relaxed DE criteria (| fold| ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.05) are shown
  in blue (suppressed) or yellow (induced). If a gene’s results fail to meet the relaxed
  criteria then they are represented by a small white circle with a gray outline.
  Color intensity indicates statistical confidence and circle size indicates fold
  change.
