caption: Adenosine metabolism pathway. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is degraded to
  adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1
  (CD39). AMP is then converted to adenosine (ADO) by 5’-Nucleotidase (NT5E/CD73).
  Both enzymes are expressed on the cell surface of numerous cells in the tumor microenvironment.
