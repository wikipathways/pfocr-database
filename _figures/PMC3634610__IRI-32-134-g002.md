caption: Signaling network of Dectin-1. Multiple pathways downstream of Dectin-1 rely
  on Syk. This can lead to PLCγ2/Ca2+signaling leading to PKCδ activation that controls
  calcineurin/NFAT and ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome, and the phosphorylation of CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1.
  The CARD9 complex is able to activate all NF-κB subunits including c-Rel by removing
  its inhibitor, IκB, through activation of the IKK complex. Syk can also activate
  IKK complex through the non-canonical NIK pathway, leading to the activation of
  NF-κB subunits RelB and p52. This pathway can be inhibited the Raf-1-mediated pathway
  involving p65. Phosphorylated and acetylated p65 can interact with RelB, sequestering
  it away from an active NF-κB complex. Resultant activation of NFAT and NF-κB results
  in modification of gene transcription including cytokines and chemokines. Dashed
  arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined.
