caption: A model of human pre-BCR-induced signal transduction depicted from the current
  study. (A) The stimulation of pre-BCR triggers activation of SYK/ZAP70 tyrosine
  kinases which in turn leads to activation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. MAPK
  and PI3K pathway show opposing effect in order to maintain the optimal activity
  of c-Fos and NF-κB, which may control the normal development of pre-B cells. (B)
  The pre-BCR-induced down-regulation of Rag1/2 expression is PI3K-dependent and involves
  FOXO3A.
