caption: YAP is at the epicenter of a signaling network. Growth factors (TGFα, EPEG,
  and HBEGF) induce EGFR signaling leading to KRAS activation, which in turn, stimulates
  YAP activation and increased expression. Other tyrosine kinase receptors, a specific
  integrin (ITGA2), multiple GPCRs, an inhibitor of Hippo pathway (MUC1) and actin
  polymerization via multiple pathways also stimulate YAP activity. Activation of
  YAP stimulates its coupling with TEAD, thereby promoting the expression of multiple
  YAP/TEAD-regulated genes that were identified in screens in different cell types.
  Reference to the study or studies connecting each gene to YAP/TAZ, as well as further
  details concerning the network are in the text
