caption: The p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. (A) Dendrogram of the four mammalian
  p38 MAP kinases p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. Kinase domain and unique PDZ interaction
  motif in p38γ are highlighted. (B) Structure of p38α showing N- and C-lobes of the
  kinase domain with the active site in between. ATP binding site, activation loop
  and TGY dual phosphorylation are highlighted. The active site is covered by the
  activation loop, which undergoes dual phosphorylation resulting in conformation
  change, access of substrates to the active site and full kinase activation. Structure
  was reproduced from PDB 3HVC using Pymol. (C) Mammalian p38 kinases comprise of
  4 proline-directed serine/threonine kinases - p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ – encoded
  in 4 individual genes. p38 MAP kinases are activated by a plethora of extrinsic
  (extracellular) or intrinsic (intracellular) factors. The classic activation of
  p38 follows a three-tiered mechanism. Stimuli of p38 activation are cellular stressors
  such as oxidative stress, inflammatory stimuli/cytokines, UV radiation, and osmotic
  pressure at cell membranes. Upstream stimuli activate a MAP kinase kinase kinase
  (MAPKKK) such as ASK1, TAK1, MLK or TAO kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and
  activate a MAPKK, such as MKK3, MKK4 or MKK6, which in turn phosphorylates p38 kinases
  on Threonine and Tyrosine residues in the activation loop. Dual phosphorylation
  of p38 can be detected by phospho-specific antibodies as a marker of activated p38.
  Dual-phosphorylated p38 is fully active and targets downstream phosphorylation substrates
  to alter their structure, activity, function, localization or interaction with other
  biomolecules. An alternative activation mechanism of p38α downstream of TAK1 involves
  direct interaction with TAB2 followed by auto-phosphorylation of p38α. Classic downstream
  targets of p38 kinases include transcription factors (e.g., ATF-1/2 and MEF2), chaperones
  (e.g., HSP27), cytoskeletal regulators (stathmin, tau), and other signaling factors
  (e.g., MAPKAP kinase 2/3, MSK1/2, MNK1/2, DLG4, and GSK3β). Feedback inhibition
  of p38 kinases occurs through dephosphorylation by MAP kinase phosphatases (e.g.,
  MKP1), limiting activity of upstream kinases, or transcriptional feedback.
