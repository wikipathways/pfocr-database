caption: 'The schematic diagram of the suggested metabolite pathway based on urine
  collected from both untreated and treated rats. The metabolites highlighted in blue
  are metabolites successfully identified from the urine of both untreated and treated
  rats. The metabolites highlighted in yellow are metabolites that showed significantly
  greater intensities in urine of treated rat collected on Day 1. A: TCA cycle, B:
  Phenylalanine metabolism, C: Glycine, serine, threonine metabolism, D: Propanoate
  metabolism, E: Methane metabolism, F: Nicotinate & nicotinamide metabolism, G: Arginine
  & proline metabolism, H: Glycolysis, I: Alanine, aspartate & glutamate metabolism,
  J: Glyoxylate & dicarboxylate metabolism, K: Purine metabolism, L: Taurine & hypotaurine
  metabolism, M: Cysteine & methionine metabolism, N: Glycerophospholipid metabolism,
  O: Lysine degradation, P: Sulfur metabolism, Q: Vitamin B6 metabolism.'
