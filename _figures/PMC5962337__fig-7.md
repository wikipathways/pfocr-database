caption: iAs biochemistry, redox signaling, and neurotoxicity. (a) iAsIII species
  prevail in anaerobic conditions, while aerobic environments contain iAsV species.
  iAsIII enters cells through AQP9/7 and GLUT, while iAsV uses phosphate transporters.
  Three mechanisms for iAs methylation have been proposed. (b) Oxidative methylation
  refers to the progressive reduction of AsV to AsIII metabolites by the Trx/TR system
  and the oxidative methylation of AsIII species by AS3MT. (c) The GSH conjugation
  pathway is based on the formation of As(GS)3 by the GSTs. As(GS)3 is subsequently
  methylated by AS3MT. (d) The protein thiol conjugation mechanism suggests that instead
  of As(GS)3, iAsIII binds to protein thiols and is methylated while still being conjugated
  to proteins. iAsIII methylation is likely to alter epigenetic signatures by alterations
  in AdoMet, a cosubstrate required for methyl group transfer. (e) Methylated metabolites
  and GSH/protein complexes are highly reactive and are exported through the MRPs.
  (f) DMA(GS) can form DMAH and react with O2 to form DMAH• and DMAOO•. DMAIII also
  reacts with O2 and forms DMAOOH. These reactive species lead to lipid peroxidation
  and protein carbonylation (oxidative stress). (g) AsV can replace phosphate in several
  metabolic pathways (arsenylation) where the end product is reduced AsIII. AsV binds
  ADP via ATP-synthase and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and ATP formation in
  the mitochondria. AsV is also arsenylated by GAPDH to generate iAsV-3-P-glycerate
  from G3P. (h) iAsIII toxicity generates ER stress likely via thiol depletion and
  alterations in redox balance. (i) AsIII binds to thiol containing molecules (coenzyme
  A, DLA, GSH) and protein thiols inactivating enzymatic function. (j) iAsIII toxicity
  is counteracted by Nrf2 and MTF1 that mediate the transcriptional-dependent induction
  of antioxidant systems and MTs. AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; AQP, aqua(glycerol)porin;
