caption: Biogenesis of piRNAs in flies begins in the nucleus and initiates the ping-ping
  cycle in the cytoplasm. (a) Precursor transcripts originating from piRNA clusters
  that contain anti-sense TE sequences are exported from the nucleus and processed
  into smaller fragments, possibly by the mitochondrial-associated endonuclease, Zucchini.
  (b) AUB binds precursor piRNA fragments with a preference for fragments that contain
  a 5′ terminal uracil (1U). Mature primary piRNAs are generated when an unknown 3′
  ≥ 5′ exonuclease trims the precursor piRNA fragment bound to AUB and HEN1 catalyzes
  the 2-O methylation of the piRNA 3′ end. (c) When mRNA of active transposons is
  exported from the nucleus, AUB piRNA anneals to complementary sequences within the
  mRNA and cleaves the transcript. (d) The cleaved transcript is loaded into AGO3,
  followed by trimming and 2′ O-methylation of its 3′ end, to generate mature secondary
  piRNA. (e) AGO3 loaded with the secondary piRNA is believed to target and cleave
  newly generated precursor transcripts that are loaded into AUB to initiate a new
  round of Ping-Pong
