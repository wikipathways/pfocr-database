caption: 'TLR signalling pathways: All TLRs except TLR3 share a common initial signalling
  pathway through MyD88 to the IRAK1/2/4TRAF6 complex. TLR3 uses TRIF to activate
  the IRAK1/2/4TRAF6 complex. From here, TLR1–6 are able to signal via MAPK and NEMO
  to activate API and NF-κB, respectively, and promote transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines. TLR8 also follows the same pattern but is only able to signal via NEMO,
  not MAPK. TLR7/9 are also able to activate NEMO and additionally IKK-α to promote
  IFN-α production. In addition to the MAPK and NEMO pathways, TLR3 is also able to
  signal via TRAF3 to promote IFN-β production [–].'
