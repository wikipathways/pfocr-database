caption: 'HIF-1 promotes the expression of glycolytic enzymes and transporters. Enzymes
  are represented in italicized blue font and their substrates in bold black. Green
  arrows point at HIF-1-target gene products directly involved in the acceleration
  of the glycolytic flux. In the simplified scheme, only those that have been identified
  as potential therapeutic targets are highlighted. Abbreviations: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GLUT, glucose transporter; MCT4, monocarboxylate transporter 4; P,
  phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid (cycle).'
