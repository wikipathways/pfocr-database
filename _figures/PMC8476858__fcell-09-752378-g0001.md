caption: 'Overview of intra- and extracellular routes of aSyn aggregation and pathology
  pathways as highlighted within this Research Topic: (1) Intracellular aSyn aggregation
  can be triggered by overexpression, post translational modifications (PTMs), or
  mutations within aSyn (e.g., A53T, A30P). (2–5) Pathological aSyn conformers comprising
  oligomers and fibrils block the autophagic/lysosomal pathway by interfering with
  BAG5 and the autophagic adaptor protein p62 (2), the lysosomal enzymes β-glucocerebrosidase
  (GBA1; 3) and cathepsin D (CTSD; 4), all critical for aSyn degradation. Dysfunction
  of GBA1 causes glycosphingolipids (glucosylceramide, GluCer) to increase (5). These
  lipids further drive aSyn aggregation. Pathological aSyn conformers also affect
  mitochondrial function, the lysosomal-mitochondrial crosstalk (6), vesicle recycling,
  and endocytosis (7), as well as formation and function of the actin cytoskeleton
  (8). Moreover, aSyn accumulation induces microRNAs involved in cell cycle activation
  (9). (10) Effects of aSyn-mediated pathologies were analyzed and summarized within
  different models (human, murine, C. elegans), exhibiting important roles of aSyn
  within the hippocampus. Additionally, aSyn is capable of escaping neurons causing
  cell-to-cell propagation and hence spreading of disease, which causes pathological
  effects on peripheral immune cells (11) and the gastro intestinal tract (GIT). The
  gut-brain-axis contributes to the spread of pathological aSyn conformers and disease
  pathology (12, 13). This illustration contains images from Servier Medical Art (smart.servier.com).'
