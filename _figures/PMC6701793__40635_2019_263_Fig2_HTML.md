caption: Biological processes associated with up-regulated genes after cecal ligation
  and puncture and back-regulated by landiolol infusion. a Venn diagram associated
  with the 1259 up-regulated genes in CLP group and the 418 down-regulated genes in
  CLP plus landiolol group in males. The 226 common genes represent regulated genes
  with a characteristic V form, up-regulated in sepsis and back-regulated by landiolol
  infusion. From these 226 common genes, a gene ontology analysis with the DAVID Database
  revealed significant biological processes (P-Benjamini < 0.05). A gene network diagram
  was performed using Cytoscape integrating the 226 genes (light grey circles) with
  their associated biological processes (dark grey rectangles). Genes associated with
  the JAK/STAT pathway, IL6R and STAT, with the PI3K/AKT and focal adhesion pathways,
  FGF2 and NFκB1, and with the mitogen-activated protein kinase and tumour necrosis
  factor-α pathways, cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element modulator and
  MAPK14 and GRK5, are surrounded by a black circle. b Venn diagram associated with
  the 506 up-regulated genes in CLP group and the 12 down-regulated genes in CLP plus
  landiolol group in females. Note that only 12 genes were down-regulated in CLP plus
  landiolol condition and that only seven of them were back-regulated. No significant
  biological processes were found associated to these seven genes presented in the
  table; two genes are members of the adrenergic signalling in the cardiomyocyte KEGG-pathway
  and the others are isolated genes. CLP cecal ligation and puncture, CLP + Lnd CLP
