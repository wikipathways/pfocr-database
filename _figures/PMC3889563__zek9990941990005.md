caption: 'Schematic representation of energy metabolism of glycosome and its connection
  with mitochondrion. Data represent subcellular localization of G3PDHs in T. brucei
  and their involvement in biochemical pathways. Thin black arrows represent glucose
  degradation common for both PF and BF. Bold black arrows represent a G3P:dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate shuttle and its integration into the glycosomal redox balance in BF. Gray
  dotted arrows represent a redox balancing pathway specific for PF. G3PDH is a glycosomal
  NAD-dependent isoform; mtG3PDH is the mitochondrial FAD-dependent isoform that constitutes
  the shuttle. putG3PDH represents the second FAD-dependent isoform with an unknown
  role in cellular metabolism (see the text). Boxes represent enzymes: GAPDH, glycosomal
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FoF1, mitochondrial complex V/ATPase;
  TAO, trypanosomal alternative oxidase. Q in an oval represents coenzyme Q/ubiquinol.
  Abbreviations represent metabolic intermediates: 1,3BPGA, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FBP, fructose bisphosphate; FUM, fumarate; GAP,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; MAL, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. ?, a place of reaction is not certain, i.e., glycosome
  versus cytosol for fumarase and intermembrane space-facing versus cytosol-facing
  for putG3PDH.'
