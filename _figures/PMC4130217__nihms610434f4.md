caption: Protomural role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Endometriosis favors
  Th2 cell production and M2 polarization, which lead to an increase in TAM. Through
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and other unknown pathways, TAM promotes tumorigenesis.
  Mechanisms include suppression of the adaptive immune response by the release of
  chemokines such as CCL-8 that recruit T-cell subsets devoid of cytotoxic ability
  (eg, Th2, T reg), which in turn release immunosuppressive mediators including interleukin
  (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. TAM signaling also promotes angiogenesis
  through production of epithelial growth factor, TGF-β, and chemokines, and stimulates
  tumor cell growth and survival factors such as NF-κB, migration inhibitory factor
  (MIF), and IL-1. TAM also plays a role in degradation of extracellular matrix and
  tissue remodeling activity through expression and release of matrix metallopeptidases
  2 and 9 (MMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), which digest tumor basement
  membrane and facilitate metastasis.
