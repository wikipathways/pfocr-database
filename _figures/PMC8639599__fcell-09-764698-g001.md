caption: Cellular and molecular components of bone marrow endosteal niche in both
  healthy and leukemic scenarios. The illustration contrasts the activities and components
  of the endosteal niche under physiological conditions and during the course of acute
  myeloid leukemia. In a normal scenario, signaling pathways such as MPL/THPO, Jagged
  1/Notch 1, and Ang-1/Tie-2 promote the maintenance of hematopoietic cells in a primitive
  profile and their capacity for self-renewal. Osteopontin, via β1-integrin, acts
  as a negative regulator of stem cell pool size by blocking cell proliferation. N-cadherin
  constitutes a cell adhesion mechanism between HSCs and osteoblasts. In contrast,
  the role of the canonical Wnt signaling on the maintenance of HSCs is still debated.
  Collagen and fibronectin constitute the main components of the extracellular matrix
  of the bone marrow microenvironment. Mesenchymal stromal cells give rise to osteoblasts
  and adipocytes. In the AML scenario, leukemic stem cells secrete a variety of molecules
  such as BMP, DKK1, CCL3 that, together, lead to inhibition of adipogenic differentiation
  of MSCs, promotion of the osteogenic lineage, impairment of osteoblast functioning
  and an environment rich in immature osteoblasts. In addition, the RANK/RANKL signaling
  pathway leads to osteoclastogenesis and increased osteoclast survival.
