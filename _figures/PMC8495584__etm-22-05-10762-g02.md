caption: Potential underlying mechanism of EVO on the induction of tumor cell apoptosis.
  EVO can induce apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathways by activating either
  caspase-8, 9 or 3, which decreases the expression of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2
  in tumor cells, whilst increasing the expression of the apoptosis inducer Bax. Activation
  of the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway is mediated by translocation of apoptosis-inducing
  factor into the nucleus. EVO exhibits apoptotic activity by inhibiting NF-κB activation,
  which inhibits the expression of downstream gene products cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. In
  addition, inactivation of the PI3K/AKT or PI3K/PKC signaling pathways decreases
  expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins SIRT1 and ERKs whilst increasing p53 expression.
  Generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide also potentiates the function
  of p53 and p21, which can in turn mediate EVO-induced apoptosis. Arrows represent
  stimulatory effects, whilst dotted arrows represent translocation and T-lines represent
  inhibitory effects. EVO, evodiamine; PKC, protein kinase C; SIRT1, sirtuin 1.
