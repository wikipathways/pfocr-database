caption: Illustration of cross-communication network of BCR, PI3K, and NF-κB signaling
  pathways that harbor effective therapeutic targets in lymphoma. BCR signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling, and NF-κB signaling are independent but interconnected and may form complex
  crosstalk network. One pathway may act as upstream or downstream of other pathways
  and some molecular targets function as key points and players involved in several
  pathways. These key molecules have been shown promise to be a good therapeutic target
  for effective treatment in lymphoid malignancies. (A) Tonic BCR signaling pathway
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway; (B) chronic active BCR signaling; (C) canonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway; (D) noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. The arrows indicate
  direction of activating signaling steps; the light-colored bars indicate inhibitory
  signaling steps; the black bars show inhibition from therapeutic agents toward targets.
