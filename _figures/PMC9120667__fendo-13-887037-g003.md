caption: Wnt signaling has emerged to be a major player in the regulation of cellular
  metabolism. Influx of glucose, glutamine, and Methionine metabolites have been linked
  to canonical Wnt signaling. Glucose is used by cells for energy metabolism in glycolysis
  and the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle (TCA), yielding pyruvate, ATP, and NADH. Glutamine
  is avidly consumed in cancer and leads to the reduction of downstream metabolites
  such as α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Methionine is an essential amino acid that feeds
  the Methionine cycle to produce S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl-donor
  of the cell. Upon substrate methylation, SAM is converted to S-Adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which subsequently generates homocysteine (Hcy). The Methionine cycle is
  linked to the folate cycle in a larger metabolic pathway known as One Carbon Metabolism.
  Targeting the PRMT1 cofactor, SAM, through metabolic interference could tune Wnt
  signaling responses.
