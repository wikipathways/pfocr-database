caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway
  is activated through the binding of a ligand to a death receptor, which in turn
  leads, with the help of the adapter proteins (FADD/TRADD), to recruitment, dimerization,
  and activation of caspase-8. Active caspase-8 then either initiates apoptosis directly
  by cleaving and thereby activating executioner caspase (-3, -6, -7), or activates
  the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through cleavage of BID to induce efficient cell
  death. The intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptosis pathway can be activated through
  various cellular stresses that lead to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria
  and the formation of the apoptosome, comprised of APAF1, cytochrome c, ATP, and
  caspase-9, resulting in the activation of caspase-9. Active caspase-9 then initiates
  apoptosis by cleaving and thereby activating executioner caspases.
