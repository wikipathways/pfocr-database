caption: 'Proteins differentially regulated in RCC involved in carbohydrate metabolism
  are shown overlaid on the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway KEGG #00010 diagram.
  Anaerobic glycolysis is upregulated while other carbohydrates metabolism appears
  down regulated. The enzymes colored in red correspond to the proteins which we found
  upregulated in ccRCC, and in green those (or pathways associated) we found downregulated
  in ccRCC. We added the corresponding gene symbol next to the enzyme or enriched
  process.'
