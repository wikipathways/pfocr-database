  Schematic of the metabolic pathway and relative levels of NFG, LFG, and LPG metabolites detected in the different guava leaf extract groups (0%, 0.5%, and 2%). The metabolite pathways were adopted from the KEGG database and modified. The Y-axis of the graph represents peak areas of respective metabolites. Different letters indicate significant difference based on Duncan’s multiple-range test. Metabolites in green and orange font have relatively higher abundance when fermented by L. fermentum and L. plantarum, respectively (0%: 0% guava leaf group; 0.5%: 0.5% guava leaf group; 2%: 2% guava leaf group;
  : non-fermented (NFG); : fermented by L. fermentum (LFG); : fermented by L. plantarum (LPG))
