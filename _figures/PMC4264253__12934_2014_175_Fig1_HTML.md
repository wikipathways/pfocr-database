caption: Metabolic pathway from glucose to astaxanthin in X. dendrorhous . The pathway
  consists of the glycolytic pathway and mevalonate, terpene, β-carotene and astaxanthin
  synthetic pathways. IPP, isopentenyl-pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate;
  GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl-diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate;
  AcaT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HmgS, HMG-CoA synthase; HmgR, HMG-CoA reductase;
  CrtE, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase; CrtS, astaxanthin synthase. IPP and DMAPP
  are the isoprenoid building blocks and prenyltransferases generate GPP, FPP and
  GGPP, the common precursors of monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15) and
  diterpenoids (C20), respectively. Carotenoids (C40) such as astaxanthin are constructed
  by condensation of two molecules of GGPP.
