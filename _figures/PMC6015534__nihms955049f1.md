caption: Schematic describes the major developmental steps that underlie the differentiation
  of preskeletal mesenchymal cells toward endochondral (right) and intramembranous
  (left) ossification. Multiple distinct mechanisms control fate determination and
  commitment of the progenitor cells to either developmental pathway, including hypoxia
  and retinoid and Wnt/β-catenin signaling that are particularly relevant to studies
  discussed in this review article. In many if not all respects, these developmental
  pathways are recapitulated in the formation of endochondral and intramembranous
  masses of HO tissue. Thus, specific steps and factors involved in each developmental
  pathway are being tested and exploited as possible and reasonable therapeutic targets
  for acquired and/or congenital forms of HO (as described in the text). Note that
  factors and pathways mediating the transition from mineralized hypertrophic cartilage
  to endochondral bone are very similar to those regulating osteogenic differentiation
  (listed on the left). BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor;
  RAR, retinoic acid receptor; ul-RAR, unliganded RAR; PTHrP, parathyroid hormone-related
  protein; IHH, indian hedgehog; APase, alkaline phosphatase; MMP, matrix metalloprotease;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast
  growth factor receptor; and OSX, osterix.
