caption: This presentation will focus on molecular mechanisms underlying transduction
  of BCR signals that enforce the antigen unresponsiveness of anergic B cells. Results
  suggest that the BCR functions minimally as a three position molecular switch. In
  unoccupied receptors, ITAM tyrosines are unphosphorylated and the receptor is therefore
  “off”. Acute occupancy of receptors leads to transduction of activating signals
  via biphosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines and consequent engagement of the SYK tyrosine
  kinase and downstream pathways. Chronic receptor occupancy leads to biased ITAM
  monophosphorylation and engagement of the Lyn tyrosine kinase and its stimulation
  of downstream inhibitory signaling circuitry (). By tyrosine phosphorylation of
  the inositol lipid phosphatase SHIP and its adaptor Dok-1, Lyn triggers a pathway
  that blocks signaling by receptors that require PtdIns3,4,5P3 for signaling. This
  regulation is imposed locally on, for example, signaling by co-aggregated BCR, and
  more broadly, inhibiting signaling by remotely stimulated chemokine, cytokine and
  perhaps BAFF receptors. It is likely that other Lyn targets, e.g. CD22 and coupled
  tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, also participate in maintenance of anergy.
