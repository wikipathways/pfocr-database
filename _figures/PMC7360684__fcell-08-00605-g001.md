caption: Cancer metastasis and TGF-β signaling. Cancer cells alter their morphology
  through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β signaling pathway
  activity, increasing their migratory potential. Invading the basement membrane and
  the extracellular matrix, tumor cells reach the vasculature (blood or lymph vessels)
  and become circulating tumor cells (CTCs) after intravasation. Gradually, the magnitudes
  of TGF-β signaling increase dramatically to enable the EMT-invasion processes. Cancer
  cells reach a secondary site after extravasation. Following TGF-β signaling reduction
  and consequent mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), cancer cells colonization
  proceeds to the growth of a metastatic lesion. Anti-TGF-β therapies administered
  in early stage cancers, before initial invasion, would inhibit metastasis by avoiding
  EMT. The same strategies used to treat late-stage cancers would also induce MET
  and seeding of secondary tumors.
