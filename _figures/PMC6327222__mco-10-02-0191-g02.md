caption: AR signaling pathway and the possible effect of soy isoflavones. Several
  possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which isoflavone
  activity affects AR. Possible mechanism include the transcriptional regulation of
  AR, the induction of AR degradation by the proteasomal pathway and the inhibition
  of ligand-AR complex translocation to the nucleus, leading to the possible inhibition
  of nuclear AR binding to ARE and thereby triggering an effect on the transcription
  of androgen-dependent genes (e.g., PSA). Indirect effects of isoflavones on AR may
  also be mediated by affecting the synthesis of testosterone, its conversion to DHT
  and the sequestration of DHT from binding AR, thereby reducing prostate cancer risk.
  ↑ indicates induction; ⊥ indicates inhibition. AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen
  response element; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; Hsp90, heat-shock protein 90; PSA, prostatic-specific
  antigen; ub, ubiquitin; T, testosterone.
