caption: Mechanism of quercetin-induced Nrf2 activation and enhanced antioxidant defenses.
  This figure illustrates how quercetin interacts with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  The elevated ROS levels activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
  (Nrf2) pathway, which subsequently promotes the expression of antioxidant genes,
  such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). As a result,
  the antioxidant response is potentiated, reducing oxidative stress and protecting
  cells from damage
