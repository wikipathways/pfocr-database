caption: 'Effect of acetylation/deacetylation on proteins involved in the regulation
  of apoptosis: c-Myc, p53, E2F1, ERK1/2 and Akt. Inhibitors (iHDAC), but not sirtuins,
  increase the acetylation of c-Myc at lysine 323 and inhibit tumorigenesis which
  promotes the association of c-Myc with Max, a partner required for c-Myc activation.
  HDAC inhibitors downregulated c-Myc by blocking GSK-3 phosphorylation. HDAC3 deacetylates
  c-Myc at lysine 323, protecting the protein from ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.
  c-Myc stimulates the expression of p53 and E2F1. Inhibition of the E2F1/p53 pathway
  prevents neuronal apoptosis. E2F1 acetylated at three lysines (K117, 120, and 125)
  promotes DNA double-strand break repair. The C-terminal lysines (K320, K373, K382)
  in p53 acetylation increases p53 activity in response to DNA damage. Upon DNA damage,
  the acetylation of p53 disrupts the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 and causes
  the activation of proapoptotic genes. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can reduce neuronal apoptosis
  and cerebral edema by deacetylating p53. The HDAC6 inhibition reduces the amount
  of nuclear HDAC6 and therefore the interaction between HDAC6 and p53, which leads
  to an increase in p53 acetylation. ERK1/2 acetylation at lysine 72 (K72) reduces
  the enzyme activity towards transcription factor ELK1, a substrate of ERK1; ERK1/2
  deacetylation by HDAC6 promotes ERK1 activation and prevents cell apoptosis. Protein
  kinase Bα (Akt) is acetylated at lysines 163 and 377 (K163, K377). The inhibition
  of HDAC6 leads to a decrease in the ability of Akt to bind PIP3. SIRT1 can also
  deacetylate and thus activate Akt and the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathway. HDAC3 binds
  to Akt and deacetylates it at lysine 20, promoting protein phosphorylation. Sirtuin1
  (SIRT1) and Sirtuin2 (SIRT2) are involved in the deacetylation of Akt at lysines
  14 and 20, which leads to the activation of the enzyme.'
