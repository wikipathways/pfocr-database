caption: AMH and FSH signaling pathways, cellular outcomes, and main functions in
  IVF practice. (Blue cell) AMH binds to the Amhr2 receptor, leading to the formation
  of the Amhr2-Alk2, 3, and 6 type 1 transmembrane serine/threonine kinase complex.
  Activated complex initiates the phosphorylation of Smad proteins 1, 5, and 8. The
  latter bind to Smad4 allowing entry into the nucleus leading to follicle selection
  regulating genes. Smad6 which acts as a negative regulation of both BMP and TGF-beta/activin-signaling
  inhibits nuclear translocation of the activated complex leading to transcriptional
  suppression of Smad 1, 5, 8 targets. An accessory pathway through AMH stimulated
  b-catenin activation and subsequent binding to LEF-1 (Lymphoid Enhancer Binding
  Factor 1) further induces expression of Smad-dependent genes [, , ]. (Pink cell)
  FSH binding to the Fshr G protein-coupled receptor has been shown to activate the
  Gαs/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway []. Appl1 interacts with the FshR
  to trigger the PI3K signaling pathway while Src family members promote a similar
  activation in an FSH-dependant fashion, while triggering a similar response for
  the ERK cascade [, ]. Coupling of FshR to Gαh (tissue transglutaminase) leads to
  PLCδ activation []. Downstream effectors of these cascades, namely, Foxo1, Creb,
  and c-Jun, become activated through phosphorylation and translocate to the nucleus,
  leading to the expression of follicular development regulating genes as well as
  driving the expression of Estradiol. The FSH signaling cascades have been extensively
  reviewed in []
