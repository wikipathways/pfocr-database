caption: HLA-G effect in the different cells of the immune system. (A) Inhibitory
  effect of HLA-G on T cells. The binding of HLA-G to ILT2, activates the ITIM domains
  of the latter and recruits the SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases. On the one hand, these
  proteins are capable of inhibiting the TCR signal, through ZAP70 dephosphorylation.
  On the other hand, they trigger a signaling pathway leading to NF-kB activation,
  which enhances IL-10 expression. HLA-G also exerts its inhibitory function through
  competition for the union of classical HLA class I molecules to the CD8 coreceptor
  in CD8+ T cells, and to the TCR. (B) HLA-G binds to its cognate receptors ILT2 and
  KIR2DL4, both containing inhibitory domains ITIM, which upon activation, recruits
  SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to Vav1 inactivation, and thus downregulating the cytotoxicity
  capacity of NK cells. (C) In B cells, HLA-G works via ILT2, where SHP-1 mainly,
  is responsible for the dephosphorylation of AKT leading to mTORC1, GSK-3β and Foxo
  inactivation. (D) Like in T cells, the pathway initiated by HLA-G through ILT2 and
  ILT4 leads to NF-kB activation. This factor causes an increase in IL-6 and IL-10
  expression. IL-6 is capable of binding to IL-6 receptors on DCs and, through the
  STAT-3 activation factor, inhibits HLA class II assembly.
