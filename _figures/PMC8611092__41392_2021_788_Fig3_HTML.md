caption: The specific mechanism of glioma progression between circRNAs and PI3K/AKT
  pathway. Circ0014359 exerts its effects by inhibiting the level of miR-153 and regulating
  the PI3K/AKT axis. CircDICER1 in combination with MOV10 plays a critical role in
  glioma angiogenesis via regulation of miR-103a-3p (miR-382-5p)/ZIC4. CircHIPK3 regulates
  biological functions to improve sensitivity to temozolomide through suppression
  of the miR-524-5p/KIF2A-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. circRNAs can also facilitate
  glioma tumorigenesis and progression by regulating the circPIP5K1A/miR-515-5p/TCF12/PI3K/AKT
  axis in glioma. Image created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
