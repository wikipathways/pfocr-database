caption: Multifaceted action of HAT on the complex crosstalk between ECs and cancer
  cells. HAT suppressed the antigenic potential of HUVECs by targeting the VEGFR2
  signaling pathway. HAT reduced the production of angiogenic and chemotactic factors
  by cancer cells. HAT inhibited the development of erlotinib resistance in PC9 cells
  by attenuating HGF production from ECs
