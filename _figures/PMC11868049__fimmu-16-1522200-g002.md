caption: 'The downstream effects of the ubiquitination process in the cGAS-STING pathway.
  Affects NF-κB signaling pathway: Gelsevirine affects STING/NF-κB by promoting ubiquitinated
  degradation of STING and Gn by blocking ubiquitinated activation of STING; affects
  IRF3/IRF7 signaling pathway: TRAF6 ubiquitinates or USP21 deubiquitinates STING
  to activate or maintain STING stability, promoting downstream activation of IRF3
  and IRF7; affects autophagy: p62 mediates ubiquitination of cGAS and autophagic
  degradation of STING; affects ER Stress: STING acts as a mediator of ER Stress,
  and ubiquitination of STING by TRIM13 leads to STING degradation. Image created
