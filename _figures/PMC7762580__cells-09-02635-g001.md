caption: 'Overview of fructose and glucose degradation pathways. Fructose uptake is
  mediated by GLUT5 and can be metabolized via different pathways: (1) phosphorylation
  via KHK to F1P, which is then hydrolyzed by aldolase B to DHAP and GA. Subsequently,
  fructose carbons can therefore enter glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.
  (2) Phosphorylation via HK, entering glycolysis in the form of F6P, and (3) via
  the polyol pathway producing glucose which in turn can enter gylcolysis. Glucose
  can be taken up by several glucose transporters (here GLUT1) and is metabolized
  via glycolysis. Glucose can also be used for endogenous fructose production providing
  the possibility to bypass PFK. PFK is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis and
  is inhibited by high levels of ATP and citrate as well as low pH and low oxygen
  levels. From an energetic point of view, the degradation pathways from fructose
  and glucose to pyruvate do not differ. Fructose degradation via KHK to GA3P consumes
  two ATP just as glucose in glycolysis. In the pay off phase, both pathways generate
  four ATP and two NADH+H+. Bypassing PFK inhibition by endogenous fructose production,
  however, consumes one additional NADPH+H+ and produces one NADH+H+. AKR1B1: aldo-keto
  reductase family 1, member B1; ALDO: aldolase; G3P: glycerol 3-phosphate; GA3P:
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GLUT1: glucose transporter 1; GLUT5: fructose transporter;

  hexokinase; KHK: keto hexokinase; PFK: phosphofructokinase; SORD: sorbitol dehydrogenase;
