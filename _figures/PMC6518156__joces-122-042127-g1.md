caption: The mechanical integrin cycle. (A) Cell-ECM adhesion occurs when actin-dependent
  protrusions bring integrins at the leading edge (orange) in contact with the matrix
  (purple) where they can bind. (B) Next, the integrins link to the actin cytoskeleton
  through adaptor proteins, such as talin (blue), Shp2, filamin or α-actinin. Integrins
  bind to these adaptor proteins through their β-tails. Rearward actin flow, generated
  by actin polymerization and actomyosin contractions (see Box 1) induces a pulling
  force on the integrin-ECM linkage. On sufficiently rigid substrates, this may serve
  to accelerate an integrin-activating conformational change, as well as a talin stretch,
  which may expose buried vinculin-binding sites (yellow). Although the bent conformation
  of the ligand-bound αVβ3-integrin crystal structure produced much controversy in
  the integrin field (; ), it has subsequently been shown in electron microscopy experiments
  to stably bind fibronectin (). Force might accelerate the switch to high-binding
  affinity by freeing the ligand-bound integrin head from the constraints of neighboring
  domains, which would essentially accelerate the allosteric pathway to the activated
  state (). (C) The cell begins to pull itself over the site of adhesion. Intramolecular
  conformational changes in α5β1 integrins facilitate their inward translocation,
  whereas αVβ3 integrins remain anchored at the edge. This segregation of integrins
  may further facilitate the talin stretch. At this stage of adhesion, a wide variety
  of intracellular focal-adhesion proteins are accumulated in the adhesive plaque
  (grey oval). (D) Ultimately, highly clustered integrins switch from high- to low-binding
  affinity, possibly catalyzed by the phosphorylation of β3-integrin tails. Membrane
  exocytosis places recycled, low-affinity integrins at the end of microtubules, often
  2-4 μm away from the leading edge. The integrin turnover in focal adhesions (from
  C to D) is ∼1-3 minutes (). For the description of a single integrin see supplementary
  material Fig. S1.
