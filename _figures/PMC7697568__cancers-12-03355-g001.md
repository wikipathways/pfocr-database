caption: 'Overview of Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt ligands secreted from stromal cells
  are activated by porcupine-mediated post-translational modification and bind to
  Frizzled (FZD) receptors on Wnt receiving cells. This functions to inhibit a destruction
  complex containing axin-like protein (AXIN)1/2 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
  thus disinhibiting β-catenin (CTNNB1), the master transcriptional regulator of Wnt
  singaling. Frizzled receptors are degraded due to the action of ring finger protein
  43 (RNF43), which is in turn inhibited by binding of R-spondin (RSPO) ligands to
  leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled (LGR) family receptors, thus augmenting
  Wnt signaling tone. Wnt pathway activation is regulated at multiple levels by negative
  feedback loops, including those mediated by AXIN2 and notum palmitoleoyl-protein
  carboxylesterase (NOTUM). Recurrent mutations in CTNNB1 and APC result in ligand-independent
  pathway activation while mutations in RSPO and RNF43 depend upon binding of Wnt
  ligands to Frizzled receptors. GSK: glycogen synthase kinase; LRP: lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein.'
