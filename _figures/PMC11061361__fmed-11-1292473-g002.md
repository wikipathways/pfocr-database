caption: LIPUS holds potential as an effective approach to counteract synovial inflammation
  and fibrosis. LIPUS demonstrates the ability to mitigate synovial inflammation and
  joint dysfunction through the enhancement of autophagy in macrophage-like synoviocytes
  and the inhibition of mature IL-1B production. Additionally, LIPUS has the capacity
  to modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in fibroblast-like synoviocytes,
  facilitating β-catenin degradation and nuclear translocation, regulating downstream
  gene transcription, and ultimately impeding synovial fibrosis. Figures created with
