caption: Exercise induces the release of metabolites and proteins that promote learning
  and memory formation through activation of Bdnf expression and signaling in the
  hippocampus. Bones release osteocalcin that promotes Bdnf expression through an
  epigenetic mechanism involving RbAP48 (, ). The liver releases the ketone body betahydroxy-butyrate
  that induces hippocampal Bdnf expression by inhibiting class I HDACs, namely HDAC2
  and HDAC3 (, ). The muscle releases FNDC5/irisin that activate hippocampal Bdnf
  expression through an unknown mechanism (). In addition, the muscle release lactate
  that activates the hippocampal SIRT1/PGC1-alpha/FNDC5 pathway and in turn Bdnf expression
  (). Finally activated platelets have been shown to store and secrete BDNF (, ).
  Whether these factors mediate the positive effects of exercise in stroke is not
  clear and needs to be addressed. In addition, the role of BDNF signaling in exercise-mediated
  neuroprotection also needs to be assessed. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  FDNC5, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5; HDACs, histone deacetylases;
