caption: 'ER response after misfolding and aggregation of α-syn, AAT, and FG. (1)
  The ER increases its stress levels upon protein misfolding and aggregation produced
  by the dysfunction of homeostasis in the cellular milieu [,]. (2) The UPR system
  is activated by the following stress sensors IRE1-α, PERK, and ATG-6, which in turn
  activate the transcription factors XBP1 and eIF2α involved in the regulation of
  the ER stress response and autophagy pathway-dependent degradation [,,]; for the
  case of FG, there are no studies linking UPR with FG misfolding and aggregation,
  however, considering the similarities of FG with AAT in terms of cellular toxicity,
  it is likely that similar defensive processes take place [,]. (3) The main degradation
  systems: the autophagic pathway and the ubiquitin–proteosome system (UPS) deteriorate
  their function in the face of increased misfolded proteins [,,]. This prevents the
  correct degradation of proteins, causing an increase in their aggregation. Within
  the autophagic pathway, in the case of α-syn, macroautophagy and CMA are known to
  mediate the degradation of this protein upon misfolding []. In contrast, for the
  case of AAT and FG, the types of autophagy involved in their degradation have not
  yet been elucidated [,,]. (4) In parallel, there is an increase in mitochondrial
  stress, which affects its UPR function upon α-syn (dotted line) [], AAT [], and
  FG [] misfolding, leading to dysfunction of this organelle. (5) Finally, dysfunction
  of the above pathways leads to activation of the transcription factor CHOP (C/EBP
  Homologous Protein) that directly or indirectly potentiates the activity of caspases,
  culminating in cell death by apoptosis [,,,].'
