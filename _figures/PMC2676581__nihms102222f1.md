caption: Biochemical effects of gene fusions cluster around tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling
  pathways, which alter the activity of intracellular proteins, and transcription
  factor (TF) activity, which control gene expression at the DNA level. Here we outline
  the examples of the Ras and PI-3K pathways, which are commonly involved downstream
  of TK activation and are frequently implicated in the oncogenic effects of gene
  fusions. PI-3K works via increased activity of the master regulator Akt, which controls
  many cellular processes including the nuclear TF NfκB. Likewise, the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk
  pathway promotes activation of TFs, including Elk-1, which is a target of Erk. These
  signaling pathways and gene expression signatures result in the phenotypic qualities,
  such as invasiveness and increased proliferation, observed in cancers.
