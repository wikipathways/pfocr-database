caption: (A) Schematic of preparing M1 macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticles (PIR@M);
  (B) Intratumor injection of PIR@M NPs stimulated the polarization of TAMs into the
  M1 subtype by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and the IPF5 signaling pathway.
  After polarization into the M1 subtype, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines
  that induced tumor apoptosis can be increased, and the suppressed cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  can regain their function. Increasing cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration and inflammatory
  factors at the tumor can enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy; (C, D) The
  ratio of tumor, spleen M1 type cells, and 1–6 were the saline groups, P@M, PI@M,
  Vc + PI@M, PR@M, and PIR@M groups. Reprinted with the permission from Ref. 134.
