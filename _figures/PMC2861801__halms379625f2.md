caption: Schematic representation of the two major transduction pathways of apoptotic
  signalling. The first one, called the extrinsic pathway, is activated by the binding
  of ligands to membrane-bound death receptors of the TNFR family. The second pathway,
  called the intrinsic pathway, involves a plethora of signals that converge on the
  mitochondria via the pro- and the anti- apoptotic members of the Bcl2 family. The
  extrinsic pathway links into the intrinsic pathway via a pro- apoptotic Bcl2-family
  protein, Bid.
