caption: Crosstalk of Notch and Wnt in epithelial homeostasis and HPV-modulated homeostasis.
  A) Notch and Wnt regulate one another to achieve Wnt-ON/Notch-OFF or Notch-ON/Wnt-OFF
  states. For Wnt-ON/Notch-OFF, Dishevelled interacts with Notch1 and inhibition of
  NICD-dependent transcription of Notch target genes leads to loss of p53. Loss of
  p53 subsequently enables accumulation and activation of β-catenin. For Notch-ON/Wnt-OFF,
  the Notch1 receptor sequesters β-catenin at the membrane. Moreover, NICD can form
  a complex with β-catenin and CSL in the nucleus to deactivate β-catenin. p53-dependent
  activation of Notch and inhibition of β-catenin induces the cell to commit to differentiation
  [99,104,105]. B) HPV's modulation on the crosstalk between Notch and Wnt depends
  on mutual effectors in the pathways. High-risk E6 degrades p53 which has an activating
  function on Notch1 and inhibitory function on β-catenin. High-risk E6 also binds
  to and stabilizes Dishevelled which inhibits Notch1 and activates Wnt by inhibiting
  the Axin destruction complex. The role of E7 and its cooperative effects with E6
  on the crosstalk remain to be well-characterized [108,109]. C) Table summarizes
  the interactions of Notch & Wnt components, including p53 and Dishevelled, with
  Alpha- and Beta- HPV E6 and E7
