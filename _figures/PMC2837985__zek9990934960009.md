caption: Proposed model for the regulatory mechanisms of the Ras and cAMP signaling
  pathways in stress response and antifungal drug susceptibility in C. neoformans.
  The Ras1-dependent signaling pathway promotes cell survival under diverse environmental
  stresses, such as cell wall destabilization, osmotic shock, oxidative and genotoxic
  stresses, and high temperature, in a manner mediated by Cdc24 and Cdc42. Ras1 appears
  to affect resistance to antifungal drugs by maintaining cell wall and membrane integrity.
  Along with Ras1, Ras2 plays some minor role in controlling antifungal and oxidative
  stress sensitivity. The cAMP signaling pathway is involved in responses to stress
  from heavy metals and toxic metabolites. Notably, small heat shock proteins, Hsp12
  and Hsp122, are positively regulated by the cAMP signaling pathway and appears to
  affect resistance against AmpB treatment. However, expression of HSP12 and HSP122
  is much more significantly regulated by the HOG pathway.
