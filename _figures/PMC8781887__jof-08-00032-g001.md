caption: 'Organization and biological roles of the fission yeast Cell Integrity Pathway
  (CIP). (A) The overall architecture and main components of the CIP in S. pombe.
  (B) Transcriptional regulation. Atf1, the main downstream transcription factor regulated
  by the stress activated MAPK pathway (SAPK) via Sty1 MAPK, can be also targeted
  by Pmk1 under specific stimuli, such as cell wall stress. The possibility that Pmk1
  may, together with Sty1, regulate the expression of other Atf1-dependent genes besides
  ecm33+ is currently unknown. (C) Control of mRNA-stability through RNA binding proteins
  (RBPs). The RBPs Nrd1 and Rnc1 become phosphorylated by Pmk1 during growth and stress
  to modulate the stability of mRNAs encoding the dual specificity phosphatase Pmp1
  (Rnc1), and the myosin II essential light chain Cdc4 (Nrd1), thus allowing an accurate
  control of the Pmk1 activity threshold and cytokinesis, respectively. Sty1 also
  phosphorylates Rnc1 in vivo to prompt destabilization of mRNAs encoding SAPK components,
  resulting in reduced MAPK activity. (D) Regulation of calcium homeostasis. Pmk1
  and calcineurin antagonistically regulate the activity of the Yam8-Cch1 channel
  complex to modulate the calcium influx in response to saline and cell wall stresses.
  (E) Functional cross-talks. Upper: Functional interaction between CIP and target
  of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways. Tor complex-2 (TORC2) and its main activator,
  the Rab GTPase Ryh1, positively control de novo synthesis of Pck2 and trigger Pmk1
  activation in response to cell wall (CW) damage or upon glucose limitation. Ryh1
  also promotes the plasma membrane targeting of several CIP upstream components and
  Pmk1 activation independently of TORC2 signaling. Conversely, activated Pmk1 down-regulates
  Ryh1 activity. Lower: The SAPK pathway negatively controls CIP signaling through
  the transcriptional induction of the MAPK phosphatases, Pyp1, Pyp2, Ptc1, and Ptc3,
  that dephosphorylate both Sty1 and Pmk1. Pmk1 dual specificity phosphatase Pmp1
  also dephosphorylates Spk1, the MAPK of the pheromone response pathway. Dotted lines
  indicate that the molecular links and/or mechanisms have not been fully established.
