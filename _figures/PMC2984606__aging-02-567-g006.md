caption: In adult worms the FGFR EGL-15(5A) targeted for activation by the Klotho
  KL1 isoform can allow EGL-17 ligand binding. Under physiological conditions, the
  Klotho/EGL-15/EGL-17 complex constitutively represses the DAF-2 (Insulin/Igf-like)
  receptors by a still unknown pathway. Such complexes may induce DAF-16 (FOXO) de-repression
  and subsequent overexpression of longevity factors, such as antioxidant enzymes.
  When worms have to cope with a potent stress, the Klotho/EGL-15/EGL-17 complex may
  directly activate DAF-16 by a DAF-2-independent pathway (dashed line). Such activation
  mechanism remains to be elucidated.
