caption: A. Schematic representation of the non-selective autophagy pathway. After
  the nucleation and elongation step, the mature autophagosome containing a portion
  of cytoplasm fuses with the lysosome, in which cellular contents are degraded. B.
  Schematic representation of mitophagy, in which the autophagy machinery selectively
  recognizes either cytosolic receptors (such as p62 recruited by the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway) that bind to ubiquitinated mitochondria, or mitochondrial outer-membrane
  receptor proteins, such as BNIP3 and FUNC1. Mitochondria are then degraded in the
  autolysosome. C. Major upstream signaling pathways that induce autophagy and mitophagy
  during exercise. Activation of AMPK stimulates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR and
  inducing the ULK1/2 kinase. AMPK also promotes the expression of the FoxO3 transcription
  factor, which upregulates multiple autophagy genes at the transcriptional level.
  Unknown circulating factors may as well contribute to autophagy induction after
  exercise.
