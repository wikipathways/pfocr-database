caption: miR-35 regulates germ cell death by buffering MAPK activity via negative
  regulation of ndk-1 and by also targeting egl-1 after genotoxic stress. a miR-35
  acts to buffer NDK-1 activation of MAPK. Absence of miR-35 result in more cells
  enriched in NDK-1 protein, which leads to increase in MAPK activity and germ cell
  death. b Schematic diagram of model for miR-35 inhibition of MAPK and core apoptosis
  pathway activation. MiR-35 negatively regulates germ cell death by targeting both
  EGL-1 in the core apoptosis pathway and NDK-1, a positive regulator of MAPK signalling
papertitle: MiR-35 buffers apoptosis thresholds in the C. elegans germline by antagonizing
  both MAPK and core apoptosis pathways.
