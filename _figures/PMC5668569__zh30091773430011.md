caption: The interplay between NO and H2S in colonic smooth muscle. In colonic smooth
  muscle, relaxation in response to nitric oxide (NO) is mediated via stimulation
  of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, cGMP generation, and cGMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKG) activity. PKG phosphorylates various targets in the contractile
  pathway to decrease intracellular Ca2+ and/or increase myosin light chain phosphatase
  activity, key requirements in muscle relaxation. cGMP/PKG pathway, in addition,
  activates cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) to generate H2S, which in turn inhibits PDE5
  activity and augments cGMP/PKG pathway.
