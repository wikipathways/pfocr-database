caption: Sites within the early steps of the insulin signaling pathway affected by
  OGT and O-GlcNAcylation. Upon insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, OGT is recruited
  to the insulin receptor (IR), tyrosine-phosphorylated, and catalytically activated
  () (1). OGT in turn modifies proteins, such as transcription factors (Sp1 and STAT3)
  (2) and kinases (PDK1), as well as a potential host of other unknown proteins (3).
  Acute insulin stimulation induces OGT interaction with at least PDK1 in the insulin
  signaling pathway and an increase in O-GlcNAc modification (4). Elevation of O-GlcNAc
  induced by PUGNAc inhibits OGT interaction with PDK1. Wortmannin (5) is a general
  inhibitor of PI3K, which blocks downstream AKT activation (6). During normal insulin-stimulated
  insulin receptor/AKT signaling, the insulin receptor becomes activated and phosphorylates
  the IRS-1 and IRS-2 YXXM motifs (Y608XXM and Y628XXM), which recruit and activate
  PI3K p85, resulting in downstream activation of PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates
  AKT (Thr308), resulting in GLUT-4 glucose uptake (7). Elevations in O-GlcNAc specifically
  induced by the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc result in O-GlcNAc modification of IRS-1
  and decreased phosphorylation of Y608XXM (8), decreased PI3K p85 interaction with
  IRS-1, and downstream reduced phosphorylation of Thr308 of AKT, resulting in reduced
  GLUT-4 glucose uptake. IRS-1, IRS-2, and PDK1 were all excellent substrates for
  OGT in vitro (9). O-GlcNAc modification of PDK1 may play a role in reduced AKT activation.
