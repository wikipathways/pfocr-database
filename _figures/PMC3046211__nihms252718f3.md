caption: There is compelling evidence that disruption of host cell cycle checkpoint
  control by HPV-16 E7 promotes numerical and structural chromosomal instability through
  disruption of centrosome duplication control and altered DNA replication dynamics,
  respectively. Activation of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway by HPV-16 E7 can have
  different outcomes depending on the presence of a functional FA pathway (see text
  for details). HPV-16 E7 has been shown to facilitate entry into mitosis by inducing
  accelerated claspin degradation. Whereas the exact fate of altered metaphase cells
  in the context of HPV-16 E7 remains to be determined, it is clear that the ability
  of HPV-16 E6 to attenuate p53-mediated host cell responses contributes ultimately
  to host cell viability and continued proliferation.
