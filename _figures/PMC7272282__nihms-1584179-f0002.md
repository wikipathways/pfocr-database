caption: 'Checkpoints occur at entry into S phase (the G1/S checkpoint), during replication
  (intra-S checkpoints) and entry into mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint). For S and G2/M
  phase checkpoints, ATR activates CHK1 following replication stress-induced SSBs,
  which subsequently activates WEE1 or inhibits CDC25 phosphatases, leading to deactivation
  of CDKs. The attenuated CyclinB/CDK1 activity results in the stoppage of G2 to M
  transition. For G1/S checkpoint, ATM activates CHK2 following DNA DSBs, which in
  part activates p53. Active p53 transcriptionally induces expression of the CDK inhibitor
  p21, leading to inhibition of CyclinD/CDK4/6 and CyclinE/CDK2 complexes, thus causing
  G1 arrest. Proteins contributing to cell-cycle progression are indicated in white
  boxes, and cell-cycle arrest in gray boxes. Abbreviations: ATM = ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutate; ATR = ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related; CDC25 = cell division cycle
  25; CDK = cyclin-dependent kinase; CHK = cell cycle checkpoint kinase; DSBs = double-strand
  breaks; SSBs = single-strand breaks'
