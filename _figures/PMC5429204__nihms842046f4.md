caption: In the primed nociceptor, neuroplasticity manifests as a PKCε-dependent mechanical
  hyperalgesia , , , . While in the normal nociceptor PGE2 induces hyperalgesia by
  activating PKA, which lasts ~2h 2, in the primed nociceptor an autocrine signaling
  pathway at the plasma membrane  is also triggered, culminating in the activation
  of PKCε, prolonging the PGE2-induced hyperalgesia to more than 4 h , . The activation
  of this additional pathway involves the transport of cAMP, produced by adenyl cyclase
  (AC) stimulation, across the plasma membrane into the extracellular compartment.
  In sequence, cAMP is metabolized to AMP and then adenosine, by ecto-phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) and ecto-5′nucleotidase (E5NT), respectively, ultimately activating Gi-coupled
  A1 adenosine receptor (A1). This stimulates PKCε, responsible for the late component
  of PGE2-induced hyperalgesia in the hyperalgesic priming. While this autocrine mechanism
  is present in both males and females, in females (bigger circle) it is regulated
  by estrogen, which acts at the estrogen receptor alpha (EsRα), regulating either
  the expression or the activity, or both, of the E5NT, thus modulating the conversion
  of AMP to adenosine, and the downstream signaling that will produce PKCε-dependent
  hyperalgesia. The regulation of E5NT by EsRα has been suggested to involve either
  a genomic mechanism, regulating the expression of this enzyme, or the interaction
  between EsRα and E5NT, directly or through second messengers. In the first case,
  transcription factors such as AP-1 and Sp1, which are active at the E5NT gene promoter
  , , are regulated by activation of EsRα , , . Of note, this interaction has been
  observed in hippocampal neurons, and associated to differences in neuroplasticity
  between the sexes . The second possibility would be the direct interaction of the
  receptor with the enzyme, supported by studies demonstrating co-immunoprecipitation
  of estrogen receptors and E5NT, suggesting that these elements can interact through
  physical association . In addition, activation of messengers/kinases that increase
  either the expression or the activity of the E5NT, such as PKC, has also been reported
  , , . Hence, even though these signaling pathways have not been demonstrated in
  nociceptors, it is plausible that they are involved in the regulation of processes
  in which E5NT plays a role, therefore explaining why the knock down of EsRα in the
  nociceptor impairs the expression of priming in females.
