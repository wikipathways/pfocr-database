caption: Signaling pathway resulting in TNFα-mediated necroptosis, and specific necroptotic
  inhibitors targeting RIP1 and MLKL. Upon TNFα binding to its cognate receptor, TRADD,
  TRAF2 and RIP1 are recruited to form complex I. In the second step, bound proteins
  dissociate from the receptor when TNFR is engulfed into the cytosol. In turn, TRADD
  and RIP1 are bound to FADD and caspase 8, eventually forming the cytoplasmic complex
  II. In situations where caspase is compromised, RIP1 interacts with RIP3 to trigger
  consecutive downstream signaling events, including the recruitment of MLKL and PGAM5,
  which transmit cytosolic death signals to the mitochondria. Nec-1 and NSA inhibit
  RIP1 and MLKL, respectively, with high specificity. TNFα, tumor necrosis factor
  α; RIP, receptor-interacting protein kinase; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like;
  TRADD, TNF receptor 1-associated death domain protein; TRAF2, TNK receptor-associated
  factor 2; TNFR, TNFα receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; PGAM5, phosphoglycerate
  mutase family member 5; Nec-1, necrostatin-1; NSA, necrosulfonamide.
