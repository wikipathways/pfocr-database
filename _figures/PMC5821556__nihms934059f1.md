caption: Neurotransmitters, growth factors, cytokines and hormones (insulin) activate
  their membrane-bound receptors to recruit the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways
  and activate mTORC1 and mTORC2. The PI3K pathway activates mTORC1 via phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1)-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on its activation loop (Thr308).
  PI3K also activates mTORC2 through an unknown mechanism. Ras activates mTORC1 by
  a parallel pathway via activation of MEK1/2 (ERK kinases) and phosphorylation of
  ERK. The mTOR protein is part of both complexes and can undergo phosphorylation
  at multiple sites, including Ser2448. The mTORC1 controls protein synthesis through
  activation of ribosomal S6 kinases 1/2 (S6K1/2) and inhibition of eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). S6K1/2 activate the ribosomal protein
  S6 via phosphorylation at Ser235/236 and Ser240/244. Of note, Ser 235/236 may also
  be phosphorylated by the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), further downstream from
  ERK. The mTORC2 controls several neuroprotective signaling pathways via phosphorylation
  of Akt at Ser473, which together with the PDK1-mediated phosphorylation at Thr308
  results in full Akt activation. Once activated, Akt translocate to various subcellular
  compartments, including the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic transcription
  factor Forkhead box class O3a (FoxO3a). Phosphorylation at Ser253 by Akt leads to
  rapid translocation of FoxO3a from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, preventing its
  binding to the promoter of apoptotic genes, with a net pro-survival effect. In the
  cytoplasm, Akt can phosphorylate the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) at
  Ser9 inhibiting its kinase activity, and preventing the phosphorylation of further
  downstream targets, including the microtubule-binding protein tau and the transcription
  factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).
