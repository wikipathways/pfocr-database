caption: Myc-regulated metabolic pathways in cancer. Glucose is taken up by glucose
  transporters (GLUT) and phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to form glucose-6-phosphate
  (glucose-6-P). Glucose-6-P can then either enter glycolysis or the pentose phosphate
  pathway, which supports nucleotide synthesis by yielding two NADPH reducing equivalents
  and one ribose per molecule of glucose. The serine biosynthesis pathway branches
  off glycolysis, producing serine and glycine that likewise support nucleotide synthesis.
  Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) converts serine to glycine which, in a
  series of coupled reactions, can be used to create nucleotide and epigenetic methyl
  donor 5,10-CH2-tetrahydrofolate and mitochondrial NADPH for redox control. Lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDHA) can regenerate NAD+ by converting glycolysis-derived pyruvate
  to lactate, which is then exported out of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCT1-4). Alternatively, pyruvate can enter the TCA cycle in a pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH)-dependent conversion to acetyl-CoA. TCA cycle citrate can be exported to the
  cytoplasm where it is converted to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). Cytoplasmic
  acetyl-CoA can then be channeled into lipogenesis. In addition to glucose, glutamine
  is an important fuel source in cancers. Glutamine is transported across the membrane
  by the glutamine transporter (SLC1A5/ASCT2) and converted to glutamate by glutaminase
  (GLS or GLS2). Glutamate can then be converted to the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG) by glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) or aminotransferases.
