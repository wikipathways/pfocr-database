caption: Evolutionary and metabolic models of HCT function. A, Evolutionary model
  for the conservation of the HCT/CYP98 pair in embryophytes. Gray branches represent
  organismal evolution of species. Green and cyan branches represent HCT (this study)
  and CYP98 () gene evolutions, respectively. CYP98 encodes p-coumaroyl 3′hydroxylase
  (C3′H). B, Metabolic model of P. patens phenylpropanoid pathway. HCT plays a pivotal
  role in controlling the formation and deconjugation of shikimate esters, the evolutionarily
  conserved intermediates for phenolic ring functionalization by C3′H enzyme. Shikimate
  partly derives from the pentose phosphate pathway and is a precursor of l-phenylalanine,
  potentially establishing a regulatory control of photosynthetic carbon allocation
  to the phenylpropanoid pathway through two critical steps. The occurrence of a CSE/4CL
  alternative route toward caffeoyl-CoA in P. patens remains an open question. E4P,
  D-erythrose 4-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
