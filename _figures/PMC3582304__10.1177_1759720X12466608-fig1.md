caption: Diagrammatic representation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the
  presence of the Wnt ligand, the ligand binds to frizzled (Fzd) receptor and its
  coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6. Disheveled
  (Dvl) is subsequently activated, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)
  from phosphorylating β catenin. The cytoplasmic level of β catenin consequently
  rises, and β catenin translocates into the nucleus to bind with transcriptional
  factors T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (Lef-1), upregulating
  the target gene expression. In the absence of the Wnt ligand, GSK3β constitutively
  phosphorylates β catenin which leads to ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation
  of β catenin. Thus, the target gene expression level remains low.
