caption: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the 10 most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathways based on KEGG analysis. pCAG-APE1-
  and pCAG-EGFP-injected unilateral obstructed ureter (UUO) kidneys were compared
  for differentially-expressed genes. The DAG shows the topological relationships
  among the 10 most enriched GO terms. Circles and boxes with different colors represent
  enriched GO terms for biological process and molecular function categories. Every
  node indicates one GO term; boxes represent the top 10 enriched GO terms and the
  P value of the enrichment analysis. The enrichment degree is illustrated by color
  shades, with the darker the shade, the higher the enrichment. (a) The DAG of the
  10 most enriched GO terms in the biological process category. Note that immune response
  was the most enriched GO term among biological processes. (b) The DAG of the 10
  most enriched terms for molecular function. Note that catalytic activity was the
  most enriched GO term among molecular functions. (c) Cytokine–cytokine receptor
  interaction pathways based on KEGG analysis (KEG map04060)–. Yellow rectangles represent
  down-regulated genes, whereas red rectangles represent up-regulated genes after
  pCAG-APE1 injection. Copyright permission of this KEGG pathway map was kindly provided
