caption: Targeted NFĸB, RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/MTOR therapy strategies for FOXC1-overexpressing
  prometastatic cancers – I. Drugs that target the NFkB signaling pathway (Binding
  of transcriptional coactivator and RNA polymerase to p50/p65 heterodimer not shown).
  Indirect targeting opportunities are also depicted where targeted inhibition of
  alternate signaling pathways effectively blocks activation of the NFĸB signaling
  pathway as well. These include targeting of the EGFR receptor, various members of
  the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway (including RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK), as well as the
  individual members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
