caption: Supplementation with arginine can improve endurance exercise performance,
  enhance SDH enzyme activity, and upregulate MyHC I/IIA mRNA or protein expression
  in GAS or QUA, suggesting that arginine induces conversion from fast- to slow-twitch
  fibers. In addition, arginine promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and activates the
  Akt/mTOR signaling pathway involved in muscle function and muscle fiber remodeling
