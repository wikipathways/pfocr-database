caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
  Metabolic switches driven by genetic alterations, alter the cell intrinsic properties
  of cancer cells leading to metabolic changes in the TME. (A) Nonmalignant cells
  have low level steady-state biosynthetic activity and low energy demands. Under
  normoxia, nonmalignant (quiescent) cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  as primary ATP source. Steady-state FAO also contributes to the cellular ATP pool.
  Without extrinsic stimuli the PI3K–Akt pathway is inactive and downstream targets,
  e.g., HK, PFK2, FOXO, HIF1α, mTOR, and NRF2, are not activated. Low levels of AMPK
  activity keep HIF1α and mTOR in check. p53 participates in the repression of glycolysis
  by expression of TIGAR, PTEN, and SCO2. Myc and PGC1α are not active in quiescent
  cells. (B) Cancer cells acquire mutations that promote glycolysis by multiple mechanisms.
  Oncogenic PI3K–Akt signaling and suppressed AMPK signaling induce activation of
  glycolytic enzymes such as HK and PFK2 and transcription factors such as FOXO. Hypoxia-induced
  HIF1α also promotes the expression of glucose transporters glucose transporter 1
  (Glut1) and Glut4 and glycolytic enzymes. mTOR signaling is enhanced causing an
  increase in biosynthetic precursors. Activated PI3K–Akt signaling leads to upregulation
  of NRF2 and expression of glycolytic genes, NADPH, and anti-oxidants thereby protecting
  cancer cells from oxidative damage. PGC1α contributes to the intracellular anti-oxidant
  defense mechanisms. Mutation or deletion of p53 results in loss of glycolytic inhibitors,
  such as TIGAR, PTEN, and SCO2, whereas oncogenic Myc induces expression of glucose
  transporters and glycolytic genes resulting in dominance of glycolysis as the key
  metabolic pathway in cancer cells. Oncogenic Myc also promotes the expression of
  glutamine transporters and GLS. Myc also enhances the levels of cellular NAPDH and
  anti-oxidants via PKM2. Expression of IDO induces degradation of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenin.
  These molecular changes induce a dramatic augmentation of nucleotide, amino acid,
  and lipid biosynthesis, which are paired with enhanced catabolic pathways to enable
  cancer cells to proliferate rapidly. Abbreviations: Akt1, protein kinase B; AMPK,
