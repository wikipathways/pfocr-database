caption: Transcription regulators of key genes in astrogenesis. (A) Cytokine receptor
  and its effectors. Binding of ligands from the IL-6 family of cytokines (e.g., LIF,
  ONC-M, CT-1) brings the receptor associated janus kinases into contact, leading
  to their phosphorylation and binding to STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the
  cell nucleus as homodimers or heterodimers and regulate the transcription of target
  genes. (B) Schematic example of BMP receptor and its effectors in the canonical
  BMP signaling pathway. This signal transduction cascade is initiated by binding
  to cell surface receptors and forming a heterotetrameric complex comprised of two
  dimers of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The constitutively
  active type II receptor transphosphorylates the type I receptor when a heterotetrameric
  complex is formed. By doing so, the type I receptor is activated, which allows receptor-regulated
  Smads, or R-Smads, to be phosphorylated. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are the R-Smads
  that participate in BMP signaling (Smad1/5/8). Following their association, R-Smads
  bind to co-mediator Smad (co-Smad) Smad4, and this complex moves to the nucleus
  where it acts as a transcription factor to control the expression of genes in conjunction
  with coactivators and corepressors. Smad6 and Smad7 (Smad6/7), also known as inhibitory
  Smads (I-Smads), are involved in the signaling pathway feedback inhibition. (C)
  The transmembrane proteins Delta and Serrate (called Jagged in mammals) are NOTCH
  receptor ligands. Two proteolytic cleavage events in the NOTCH signaling cascade
  are facilitated by ligand–receptor interaction. ADAM-family metalloproteases catalyze
  the first cleavage, while γ-secretase, an enzyme complex, mediates the second. The
  NOTCH intracellular domain (Nicd), which is released by the second cleavage, moves
  into the nucleus and works to induce transcription with the DNA-binding protein
  CSL and its co-activator Mastermind. (D) EGF receptor traditional function involves
  activating several downstream signaling cascades to convey extracellular mitogenic
  signals, such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and EGF. Among them are signaling
  modules involving phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Ras, and phospholipase C-γ. Pathways
  primarily involved in FGF signal transduction control various cell processes. Cell
  proliferation and differentiation are regulated by the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, which
  is triggered by the creation of an FRS2 complex. The creation of an FRS2 complex
  also initiates the PI3/AKT pathway, which controls cell survival and destiny determination.
  Ultimately, DAG and IP3 are created upon PLCγ binding to the active FGFR, activating
  PKC. The PLCγ pathway affects the adhesion, migration, and shape of cells. Due to
  overlapping signaling effectors, these two pathways exhibit significant crosstalk.
  While factors driving astrogenesis significantly differ from those involved in neurogenesis,
  the developmental heterogeneity of astrocytes is largely dependent on the same patterning
  mechanisms that drive the spatial distribution and identity of neurons across the
  CNS [64]. Recently, single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses of rodent cortex
  suggested an intricate layering of astrocytes instructed by cortical neuronal layering
  during early postnatal development [65]. Therefore, the demonstration of developmental
  heterogeneity among astrocytes prompts inquiries into their functional diversity
  that may depend on the specific brain region or the neural circuitry to which they
  belong [66]. Acquiring a deeper understanding of the specialized astrocyte populations
  could lead to new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of neurological disorders.
