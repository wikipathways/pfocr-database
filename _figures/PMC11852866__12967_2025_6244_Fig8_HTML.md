caption: Schematic illustration of ITIH5-mediated fibroblast–macrophage crosstalk
  exacerbates cardiac remodelling after MI. In myocardial tissue, ITIH5 expression
  is upregulated after MI and is localised to the ECM, regulating ECM-macrophage-fibroblast
  signalling network interaction thereby promoting macrophage profibrotic phenotype
  transformation, CFs activation and cardiac remodelling. In addition, highly expressed
  ITIH5 can be secreted into the peripheral blood and act as a biomarker in patients
  with ICM. In terms of mechanism of action, ITIH5 activates the CD44 receptors on
  the surface of the macrophage cell membrane in a hyaluronan-dependent manner and
  activates the macrophage STAT3 signalling pathway, promoting profibrotic phenotype
  transformation
