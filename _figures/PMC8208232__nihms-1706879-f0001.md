caption: 'Summary of the bidirectional relationship between lipid metabolism disturbance
  and ER stress. The schematic shows the accumulation of the most abundant lipid species
  in the CNS induces ER-stress and ultimately UPR activation. The UPR signaling pathway
  initiates through three arms of UPR: ATF6, IRE1 α and PERK. The downstream mediators
  of these transmembrane receptors can dysregulate transcription of genes involved
  in lipid biosynthesis. ATF6 response to both protein and lipid accumulation, important
  for activation of fatty acid oxidation pathway and as a transcription factor induce
  ER stress regulatory genes. Activation of PERK and phosphorylation of eIF2α under
  lipid species accumulation-induced ER stress enhances CHOP expression which may
  lead to apoptosis and cell death. The UPR arm IRE-1α activation which has been reported
  mostly under protein aggregation can enhance lipogenic gene expression. The suggested
  model of crosstalk between UPR signaling pathway and lipogenesis and reciprocally
  between lipid accumulation and UPR induction causes neuronal dysfunctionality and
  CNS inflammation (Created with BioRender.com).'
