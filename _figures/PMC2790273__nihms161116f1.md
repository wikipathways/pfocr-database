caption: Possible cross-talk between Nod2, TCR, Cd28, TLR and TNFR family members
  in regulating NF-κB. In non-T cells, muramyl dipeptide (MDP) can initiate a signaling
  cascade that requires Nod2 and RIP2, and results in nuclear accumulation of p50
  and RelA as a result of Tab-TAK1-mediated activation of the IKKα-IKKβ-IKKγ complex
  and subsequent degradation of IκB. This pathway is also activated by TLR and IL-1R
  family members through MyD88, TRAF6 and RIP2, and by TNFR family members through
  TRAF2 and RIP1. whereas TLR, IL-1R and TNFR members can promote p50-RelA activation
  in T cells, it is not clear whether MDP, through Nod2, can also affect this pathway
  in T cells or whether T cells can take up MDP through specific transporters or phagocytosis.
  Shaw et al. propose that Nod2, independent of MDP recognition, influences T cell
  activity by binding NIK and c-Rel and by promoting c-Rel nuclear accumulation (left).
  whether c-Rel is activated as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with p50 was not investigated.
  It is unclear whether this putative NIK–c-Rel–Nod2 complex is downstream of the
  TCR, CD28, cytokine receptors or other receptors, and whether it is associated with
  other molecules. Cooperation between the TCR and CD28 in T cells can also promote
  p50-RelA nuclear translocation through PKCθ-Carma1-Bcl10-Malt1. TCR, CD28, TNFRs
  and TLRs can also trigger nuclear translocation of c-Rel (in the form of c-Rel–c-Rel
  or p50–c-Rel dimers) by targeting IκB. TNFR family members, by recruiting TRAF3
  and thus inhibiting TRAF3-mediated degradation of NIK, can also activate the IKKα-dependent
  noncanonical NF-κB pathway leading to p52-RelB nuclear translocation. This may also
  promote cross-talk with Nod2 by stabilizing and freeing NIK to allow formation of
  the NIK–c-Rel–Nod2 complex.
