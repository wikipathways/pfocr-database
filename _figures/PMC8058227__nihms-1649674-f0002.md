caption: (A) Uptake of dietary nutrients (red) in response to animal feeding, results
  in release of Drosophila insulin like peptides (Dilps) from the insulin producing
  cells (IPCs). Dilps trigger ecdysone biosynthesis in the prothoracic gland (PG)
  which is part of the larger ring gland (RG). Uptake of dietary nutrients also trigger
  production of enzyme shade in the fat body and other peripheral tissues. Ecdysone
  released from the PG is converted to 20E by the enzyme shade. 20E binds to EcR/Usp
  heterodimer to regulate ecdysone responsive genes in tissues. (B) Representation
  of different neurons involved in regulating ecdysone biosynthesis. The PTTH neurons
  and the serotonergic (SE0pg) neurons innervate the prothoracic gland and the IPCs
  innervate the corpora cadiaca (CC). The IPCs and the PTTH neurons express Allatostatin
  A receptor, and the Allatostatin A producing neurons innervate the IPCs and PTTH
  to regulate release of Dilps and PTTH respectively. CA, corpora allata; PM, pharyngeal
  muscles; PV, proventriculus. (C) A schematic of different signaling pathways in
  the PG that regulate ecdysone biosynthesis. Dietary cholesterol stored in the form
  of lipid droplets in autophagosomes provide the building blocks for ecdysone production.
  Dilps released from the IPCs activate PI3-kinase and dietary amino acids activate
  TOR pathway to promote ecdysone synthesis. PTTH released by the PTTH neurons activates
  the downstream Ras/Raf pathway to promote ecdysone synthesis. The bioamines, octopamine
  (released by cells of the PG) and serotonin (released by the SE0pg neurons) activate
  Octb3R and 5-HT7 to increase cAMP levels and increase ecdysone. Activin as well
  as Octopamine/Octb3R impinge on insulin signaling and PTTH driven Ras/Raf signaling
  to regulate ecdysone production [,].
