caption: Flux-independent signaling pathways activated by AMPARs in neurons. AMPARs
  can signal in a flux-independent manner to recruit several signaling pathways. AMPARs
  can interact with Gi/o proteins to either inhibit voltage-gated CaV2.1 channels
  or activate voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV). Extracellular Na+ entry through NaV
  channels can promote mitochondrial Ca2+ release through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+
  exchanger (mNCX). In addition, AMPARs can signal through Gi/o proteins to accelerate
  vesicle recycling or induce BDNF gene expression through ERK activation, which is
  mediated by the interaction between AMPARs and the tyrosine kinase, Lyn. Alternately,
  AMPARs can activate the ERK phosphorylation cascade to promote cell survival via
  the Gi/o protein-dependent recruitment of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Finally, AMPARs
  can also signal through Gi/o proteins to inhibit the expression of the Arc gene

  description: Flux-independent signaling pathways activated by AMPARs in neurons.
    AMPARs can signal in a flux-independent manner to recruit several signaling pathways.

    survival via the Gi/o protein-dependent recruitment of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Finally,
