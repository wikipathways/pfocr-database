caption: Processes affecting TOB1 levels and diverse mechanisms underlying TOB1 tumor
  suppression activity. (A) The level of TOB1 expression is affected by three different
  mechanisms, including LOH for TOB1 gene in the cancer genome, down-regulation of
  TOB1 mRNA expression by target microRNAs, and induction of TOB1 protein degradation
  by cues such as its phosphorylation. miR25 represses TOB1 mRNA expression by binding
  to its 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) directly. TOB1 phosphorylated by MAPKs or
  RPS6KA undergoes ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase, SKP2, resulting in its
  degradation through the proteasomal pathway; (B) TOB1, a tumor suppressor protein,
  inhibits cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and leads to the induction
  of apoptosis. In addition to inhibiting the transcription of cell cycle-associated
  genes in the nucleus, TOB1 physically cooperates with tumor suppressors, SMAD4 or
  phosphatase, and tensin homolog-10 (PTEN), to produce a yet unknown signal for the
  degradation of AURKA or AKT, thereby indirectly regulating β-catenin level in the
  cytosol. Moreover, TOB1 directly interacts with β-catenin in the nucleus, leading
  to down-regulation of target genes of the TCF/β-catenin complex. TOB1 overexpression
  induces the reduction of BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression, increment of BAX expression,
  and caspase-3 activation.
