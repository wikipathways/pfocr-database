caption: Schematic model depicting the signaling pathways of mCD83 (left side, (A–C))
  as well as sCD83 (right side, (D–F)), which contribute to resolution of inflammation.
  (A) The transmembrane domain of mCD83 stabilizes MHCII (and CD86) by antagonizing
  MARCH dependent ubiquitination in TECs and immune cells. (B) Deletion of mCD83 in
  DCs results in an over-activated DC phenotype. DCs show enhanced expression of costimulatory
  OX40L as well as CD25 and an increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-12 as well as IL-2 upon stimulation with TLR-ligands. This correlates with increased
  IRAK-1 levels and concordantly, CD83-deficient DCs stimulate T cells more potently
  (up-facing red arrows) (C) CD83 deletion in Tregs results in a pro-inflammatory
  phenotype, characterized by decreased expression levels of Gata3, Foxp3, Smad2/3
  as well as KLRG1 and CD103 (down-facing red arrows). In addition, CD83-deficient
  Tregs show increased expression levels of TLR-2 and TLR-4, IRAK-1 as well as secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β. (D) Binding of sCD83 to the
  MD-2/TLR-4 complex leads to IRAK-1 degradation which results in anti-inflammatory
  responses. In T cells, this leads to induction of Klf10. (E) sCD83 induces the TGF-β/IDO
  axis, whereby IDO leads to enhanced conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. Mechanistically,
  tryptophan deprivation leads to inhibition of T effector cell proliferation and
  kynurenines induce expansion of Tregs via the AhR pathway. Upregulation of TGF-β
  by sCD83 induces the IDO1-signaling activity, which in turn leads to prolonged induction
  of Tregs. (F) Via Rab1a, sCD83 interferes with rearrangement of actin-filaments,
  modulating the density of co-stimulatory molecules at the immunological synapse.
