caption: Treatment with resveratrol could decrease expression of miR-21 and finally
  decrease cancer cell survival; these events have been occurred after enhancing PTEN
  expression and blocking PI3K/AKT and mTOR pathways []. Also, resveratrol could decrease
  cancer cell survival and proliferation via inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway [, ]
