caption: Translocations occur by breakage and illegitimate joining of distinct genomic
  regions (shown in orange and green) either within the same chromosome or on separate
  chromosomes. Multiple pathways contribute to the formation of translocations. In
  one pathway, androgen receptor (AR) binds to its target sites in the genome upon
  stimulation by androgen. Binding of AR induces local chromatin remodeling and leads
  to spatial association of multiple AR target sites, possibly making these regions
  susceptible to breakage. Upon genotoxic stress such as irradiation, AR recruits
  the activation-induced cytidine deaminase AID, which is capable of inducing DNA
  double-strand breaks. In a second pathway, ORF2, which is overex-pressed in cancer
  cells, associates with target sites in the genome in response to androgen signaling
  and induces double-strand breaks. Determinants of ORF2 expression and targeting
  are unknown. Juxtaposed chromosomes containing persistent double-strand breaks induced
  by either mechanism are prone to translocation. Such translocations may contribute
  to tumorigenesis.
