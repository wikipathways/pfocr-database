caption: Exosomes between urinary system tumours and cancer‐associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs). Exosomes are important communication tools between CAFs and urinary system
  tumours. CAFs can encapsulate various signalling molecules in exosomes and deliver
  them to tumour cells to exert their effects. For instance, miR‐181d‐5p secreted
  by CAFs can directly suppress the expression of RNF43 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
  and activate the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway, thus promoting the stemness and
  progression of tumours. CAFs can also secrete LINC00355, which competitively bind
  to miR‐15a‐5p in bladder cancer (BCa), leading to upregulation of high mobility
  group AT‐hook 2 (HMGA2). It can also bind to miR‐34b‐5p, increase the expression
  of its target gene ABCB1 and enhance the chemoresistance of BCa cells to cisplatin.
  miR‐146a‐5p released by CAFs targets suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1)
  and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in BCa, leading to the activation of
  STAT3. miR‐146a‐5p has also been found to play a role in prostate cancer (PCa),
  where it can target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathway, affect epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduce
  the migration and invasion of PCa cells. CAFs secrete miR‐432‐5p, which targets
  GREM2 through the transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) pathway and promotes PCa
  resistance to taxanes. Similarly, tumour cells can also secrete exosomes that act
  on CAFs. RCC cells secrete circEHD2 vesicles that promote the activation of CAFs
  and interleukin (IL)‐6 secretion, thereby promoting the metastasis of RCC. LINC00665
  secreted by BCa cells activates the classical TGF‐β signalling pathway, transforming
  fibroblasts into CAFs, stimulating CAFs to secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
  promoting lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of BCa and ultimately leading
  to chemotherapy resistance
