caption: Autophagy process and potential targets for modulating autophagy. Activation
  of UNC51-like kinase (ULK) complex in response to certain signals initiates isolation
  membrane and the formation of phagophore. (Upstream pathway of ULK1 complex is depicted
  in .) Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex composed of Beclin 1, class
  III PI3K, PIK3R4, and activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy protein 1
  (AMBRA1) is also required for the phagophore formation. The Atg-Atg12-Atg16L complex
  and LC3-II phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugate promote the elongation and enwrap
  the cytosolic cargos including mitochondria, leading to the formation of autophagosome.
  Subsequently, lysosome fuses with the autophagosome (the formation of autolysosome)
  and releases acid hydrases into the interiors to degrade the cytosolic cargos. Autophagy
  can be activated by drugs such as BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics that prevent the
  formation of autophagy inhibitory complex of Beclin 1 and BCL-2. In contrast, ubiquitin-mediated
  decrease of Beclin 1 protein by Spautin-1 and inhibition of class III PI3K by 3-methyladenine
  (3-MA) can inhibit autophagy. In addition, there are drugs to inhibit the late phase
  of autophagy process. Lysosomotropic agents that enhance lysosomal pH such as chloroquine
  inhibit lysosomal enzymes and also prevent the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome,
  resulting in inhibition of autophagy. Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the fusion of autophagosome
  and lysosome by inhibiting vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) located in the lysosomal membrane.
  Compounds such as pepstatin A and cystatin B are inhibitors for lysosomal protease.
