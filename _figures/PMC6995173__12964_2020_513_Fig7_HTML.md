caption: Model of NAMPT’s role in the proliferation of human CRC cells through the
  regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A high level of NAMPT (left panel) yields
  more NAD+ and induces downregulation of Axin and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin,
  thereby leading to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the increased growth
  of CRC cells. However, when NAMPT is inhibited by genetic or pharmacological methods
  (right panel), the NAD+ level is reduced and Axin is upregulated. Then, β-catenin
  is degraded, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is suppressed, resulting in the inhibition
  of cancer cell proliferation

  cancer growth and Wnt/β-catenin signaling via increasing Axin level.
