caption: Role of AKR1C2 and AKR1C4 in male virilization. Left panel, Fetal testis
  Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Only the backdoor pathway to DHT is shown. CYP11A1
  represents cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. CYP17A1, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase;
  HSDB2, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2; HSD17B3, androgenic 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 3; HSD17B6, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6; SRD5A, steroid
  5α-reductase; StAR, steroid acute regulatory protein. Italics refer to gene names.
  Right panel, DHT synthesized in the fetal Leydig cells is required for the formation
  of the male genitalia and virilization. Loss-of-function mutations in AKR1C2 and
  AKR1C4 prevent the formation of DHT by the backdoor pathway and actively protect
  the undifferentiated genital anlage from androgens so that the female phenotype
  predominates. “X” marks the end of the anogenital distance, which is longer in boys.
