  pathway, its regulation, and perturbation by dioxin

caption: Molecules are color-coded by type, as indicated. Solid lines show reactions
  and transport steps, with the red solid line signifying the 20,22-desmolase reaction
  (k_Des), which is affected by dioxin. Dashed lines represent feedback regulation
  (red) from estradiol and progesterone on the synthesis and release of FSH and LH
  hormones from the pituitary to plasma, exerting control over the development of
  the antral follicles and the corpus luteum. Key genes are displayed in grey rectangular
  boxes
