caption: 'IL-37 inhibits liver fibrosis. Liver injury stimulates lymphocyte infiltration,
  and macrophages and KCs release proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines. KCs secrete
  PDGF and TGF-β. PDGF activates HSCs and regulates collagen synthesis. TGF-β regulates
  the transition from HSC to MFC, stimulates ECM protein synthesis, and promotes the
  occurrence of liver fibrosis. TGF-β promotes liver fibrosis via two pathways: (1)
  TGF-β activates the ALK5-Smad3 pathway to promote PAI-1 expression; (2) TGF-β activates
  ALK-1 to induce Smad1-mediated differentiation and inhibit Id1 expression. Under
  normal physiological conditions, after TßR1-mediated COOH-terminal phosphorylation
  of Smad3, pSmad3C translocates to the nucleus, activates p21 WIF1 gene transcription,
  and inhibits tumor activity. Under chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis, Smad3
  in the cytoplasm undergoes linker phosphorylation, and pSmad3L translocates to the
  nucleus and activates the transcription of c-Myc gene, enhancing the oncogenic activity
  of fibers. IL-37 downregulates the c-Myc gene by co-localization with pSmad3L, directly
  targets the fibrosis pathway, and restricts cytokine release from lymphocytes, macrophages,
  and KCs to inhibit inflammation and HSC activation. HSC, hepatic stellate cell;
  MFC, myofibroblast-like cell; TGF, transforming growth factor.'
