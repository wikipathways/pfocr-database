caption: DDR-induced immunogenic modulation. DNA-damaging agents induce a variety
  of DNA lesions, and if repair is unsuccessful, they may increase the tumor mutational
  burden (TMB). An elevated TMB promotes the generation of neoantigens, which are
  presented on MHC class I molecules to T-cell receptors (TCR), enhancing T-cell recognition.
  DNA damage also results in cytosolic DNA accumulation, triggering STING pathway
  activation and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), thereby
  promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD). Concurrently, cancer cells may upregulate
  PD-L1 expression to evade immune responses through a PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Immune
  checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) block this pathway, restoring T-cell function and reinforcing
  their antitumor activity. This illustration highlights how DDR-targeting therapies
  can synergize with ICIs to potentiate cancer immunotherapy. Figure produced using
