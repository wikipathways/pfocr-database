caption: Classes of bacterial signal peptides. Sec signals are characterized by an
  amino-terminal positively charged domain of 5–6 residues, followed by a central
  hydrophobic core of 10–12 residues and a polar region of 6 residues containing the
  signal peptidase cleavage site. TAT signals contain slightly longer amino-terminal
  (containing the signature RR) and hydrophobic domains of 10–20 residues each, followed
  by a similar carboxyl-terminal cleavage region. SRP substrates are typically inner
  membrane proteins in which a long hydrophobic transmembrane domain acts as a signal
  anchor and is surrounded by polar regions that ultimately reside in the cytoplasm
  and periplasm. These signals are discriminated and funneled to the appropriate pathway
  based on these characteristics at various stages of the preproteins’ export. For
  example, the long hydrophobic domain of an SRP substrate is detected during synthesis;
  SRP associates cotranslationally with the nascent chain emerging from the ribosome
  and directs it to the SecYEG pore. Sec signals are detected posttranslationally
  and targeted by SecA to the SecYEG translocon. TAT signals are translocated posttranslationally
  via the TAT translocation channel. Blue, charged amino terminal region; yellow,
  hydrophobic region; orange, polar cleavage region.
