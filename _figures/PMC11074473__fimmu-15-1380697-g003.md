caption: The role of m5C methylation in innate immunity (By figdraw.). First, the
  RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is reverse-transcribed into complementary RNA strands within the
  cell through the action of viral protein replicase and transcriptase to form a double-stranded
  RNA structure. This double-stranded RNA is crucial in viral replication and transcription,
  as it can activate the RNA sensing mechanism within the host cell to trigger the
  immune response, as manifested by the production of INFs and other inflammatory
  factors. In the innate immune system, toll-like receptor (TLR), cGAS, and RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) are key pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). They are responsible
  for recognizing various invading pathogens, RNA, and DNA, as well as triggering
  immune responses. TLR is a crucial PRR in the innate immune system, and different
  TLRs can recognize different invading pathogens, dsRNA, ssRNA, and CpG-DNA. They
  activate the intracellular pathways and transcription factors (such as IRF7 and
  NF-kB) through adaptor proteins (such as MyD88) to trigger the immune response.
  cGAS, a cytoplasmic PRR, and cytoplasmic DNA sensor can recognize mitochondrial
  DNA in the cytoplasm to activate STING, which can recruit TBK1 and IKK and then
  activate IRF3 and NF-kB, eventually causing the release of inflammatory cytokines
  and IFNs. RLRs, a class of intracellular PRRs, mainly recognize viral RNA through
  RIG-I or MDA5 and transduce signals through MAVS to activate IRF3, thereby eventually
  leading to the release of IFNs. m5C modification plays a crucial role in these signaling
  pathways. Specifically, m5C-modified RNA can inhibit the activity of signaling activated
  by TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8. Additionally, NSUN5 promotes the activation of the cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway through methylating GPX4 mRNA. Meanwhile, NSUN2 can inhibit the
  host RNA polymerase III (Pol III)-transcribed non-coding RNA (ncRNA), especially
  RPPH1 and 7SL RNA, thereby inhibiting the RIG-mediated IFN response. All in all,
  m5C methylation modification plays a regulatory role in the innate immune signaling
  pathway and is essential for regulating the immune response
