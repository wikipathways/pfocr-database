caption: The delicate balance of autophagy in cell survival and death. Autophagy is
  involved in the auditory pathway, which is reviewed exactly from the peripheral
  to the central auditory system. Autophagy is activated by Fox family members, BNIP3L,
  Urolithin A, PINK1, AMPK, DRP-1, rapamycin, SIRT1, and PRDX1 but inhibited by miR-34a,
  3-MA, GSK3β, and mTORC1 signaling in cells suffering from aging, noise and ototoxic
  drugs. Some common stresses usually exist, such as ROS and LPS. Accumulated lipofuscin
  and disrupted nuclear translocation of TFEB are shown in degenerated SGNs with impaired
  autophagy; in contrast, SGN degeneration is ameliorated after restoring autophagy
  and promoting TFEB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, autophagy is thought to defend
  against damage to the auditory cortex caused by aging or ototoxicity. Autophagy
  can alleviate these conditions and protect cells, although controversy remains.
  Activation of autophagy by Pou4f3 mutation and NLRX1 mediation can accelerate the
  ototoxic potential of cisplatin in hair cells and HEI-OC1 cells. Most importantly,
  appropriate autophagy plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of cell homeostasis.
