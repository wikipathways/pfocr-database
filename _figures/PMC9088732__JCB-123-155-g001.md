caption: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) replication
  and endosomal/autophagic pathways, simplified scheme. Current knowledge supports
  both beneficial and detrimental effects of the autophagic pathway for SARS‐CoV‐2
  replication. A major entry route for the virus is endocytic uptake, which requires
  lysosomal acidification for viral RNA release. The autophagic pathway is a multifactorial
  and multistep pathway with a vast range of possibilities for pharmacological targeting.
  In the more initial phases, phagophores, and double‐membrane vesicles (DMVs) are
  formed, most likely from the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly also promoted by some
  coronavirus proteins. SARS‐CoV‐2 replication takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum
  as well, at very similar, if not identical, membrane structures. SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibits
  the last step of autophagy leading to viral degradation, that is, the fusion of
  autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, thus inhibiting autophagic
  flux. Accordingly, compounds impacting autophagy are expected to be efficient in
  fighting SARS‐CoV‐2 only if they enhance autophagic flux
