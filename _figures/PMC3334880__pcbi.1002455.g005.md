caption: 'The grey line represents the maximum-parsimony tree linking the major metabolic
  phenotypes (diagrams). Three major modules shown schematically (see the legend)
  are pterin/folate- metabolism, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle
  reactions. Lost reactions (symbol) include the acetyl-CoA synthase (in  metabolism),
  and ferredoxin-dependent succinyl-CoA synthase (in TCA loop) or citryl-CoA synthase
  (not shown). Abbreviations: , formyl; , methylene; ACA, acetyl-CoA; PYR, pyruvate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; F6B, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; RIB, ribose-phosphate;
  RBL, ribulose-phosphate; ALK, alkalinity; others as in . Arrows indicate reaction
  directions; dashed line connecting 3PG to SER indicates intermittent or bidirectional
  reaction. Highlighted in yellow are the innovations underlying divergences, while
  red labels on links indicate evolutionary force associated with each innovation,
  explained in the text. Beneath each diagram is an extant species or clade name where
  the phenotype is found. Colored regions indicate domains within which all known
  instances of the indicated phenotypes are restricted.'
