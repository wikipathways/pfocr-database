caption: 'A diagram of pathways by which AGEs affect genes involved in steroid synthesis
  and follicular development. AGEs induce LHR mRNA expression and alter LH hormone
  action by inappropriate activation of ERK1/2 pathway. The interaction of AGEs with
  its cell membrane receptor RAGE induces StAR (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein),
  P450scc (cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme), CYP17A1 (17 alpha-hydroxylase
  and 17, 20 lyase), and 3β-HSD (3β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) mRNA expression
  levels. AGE-RAGE interaction also induces AMHR-II mRNA levels and increases SMAD
  1/5/8 phosphorylation (AMH pathway). AGEs: advanced glycation end-products; RAGE:
  receptor for advanced glycation end-products; AMH: anti-Mullerian hormone'
