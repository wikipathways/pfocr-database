caption: (A) Regulation of developmental responses to nitrogen starvation by the UPR.
  The carbon source and the presence or absence of a nitrogen source are shown in
  the left column. The right column shows how the UPR regulates the two developmental
  programs of diploid cells under each condition. The outcome is shown in bold letters
  in a box. Arrows stand for activating pathways, blunt-ended lines for inhibitory
  pathways. For discussion see text. (B) Model of a nitrogen-sensing pathway including
  translation and protein unfolding in the ER.
