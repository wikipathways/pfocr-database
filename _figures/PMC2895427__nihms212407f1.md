caption: Model of the Rcs signalling pathway. The sensor kinases, RcsC and RcsD, are
  activated in vivo by unknown signal(s). RcsC autophosphorylates its receiver domain
  (shaded oval) and transfers the phosphate to the histidine phosphotransfer domain
  (white triangle) on RcsD (). RcsD phosphorylates the receiver domain of the response
  regulator, RcsB (). Phosphorylated RcsB binds DNA as a heterodimer with RcsA or
  an unknown partner or as a homodimer to activate transcription. A few of the known
  Rcs-regulated genes (RcsA-dependent and -independent) are listed. Three of the genes
  activated by RcsB independently of RcsA are ugd, ftsZ () and ydeI, as shown in this
  article.
papertitle: The Rcs phosphorelay system is specific to enteric pathogens/commensals
  and activates ydeI, a gene important for persistent Salmonella infection of mice.
