caption: 'Graphic summary. (a) Graphical representation of the main results of this
  work. The nucleotide pool is adequate and balanced in myoblasts, allowing fast DNA
  replication. Upon differentiation into myotubes, muscle cells deeply silence transcription
  of a few genes involved in dTTP synthesis, exemplified by TK1. Accordingly, such
  genes display markedly reduced histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation and their products
  are depleted in myotubes, in spite of cell cycle re-entry. Loss of key metabolic
  enzymes leads to a dramatic fall in dTTP and, indirectly, dGTP levels. As a consequence,
  cell cycle reactivation in myotubes is marred by slow DNA replication, accompanied
  by DNA damage. (b) Synthesis of thymidine triphosphate in mammalian cells. dTTP
  synthesis occurs through two pathways: de novo synthesis by RNR and salvage of TdR.
  The latter is initiated by two thymidine kinases, cytosolic TK1, expressed in S
  phase, and mitochondrial TK2, which is a constitutively expressed enzyme. During
  S phase, RNR is composed by homodimers of the R1 and R2 subunits, whereas in non-dividing
  or differentiated cells R2 is replaced by p53R2. De novo-produced thymidine monophosphate
  (dTMP) derives from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) via methylation by TS. In
  its turn, dUMP derives from (i) dephosphorylation of dUDP produced by RNR and (ii)
  deamination of deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) by DCTD. The latter process prevails
  in mammalian cells. The salvage pathway receives TdR from the intracellular catabolism
  of dTMP by 5′-nucleotidases (cytosolic cdN and mitochondrial mdN) and of dTTP by
  the nuclear dNTP-triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 or via uptake from the extracellular
  environment. In terminally differentiated myotubes DCTD, TS and TK1 are strongly
  repressed (barred arrows) and reactivation by p21 and p27 silencing fails to induce
  them to levels approaching those of proliferating cells. Thus both pathways converging
  on dTMP, an essential precursor of dTTP, are severely impaired in reactivated myotubes'
