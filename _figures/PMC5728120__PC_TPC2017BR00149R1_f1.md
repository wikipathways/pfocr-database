caption: Crosstalk among Chlorophyll, Bilin, and Naphthoquinone Biosynthesis in Chlamydomonas.The
  biosynthesis of chlorophyll (Chl), heme, and linear tetrapyrroles (bilins) in Chlamydomonas
  share a common pathway from glutamate to PPIX via the intermediate ALA. The heme
  and chlorophyll pathways diverge with the insertion of iron or magnesium, respectively,
  into PPIX. The bilins biliverdin IXα (BV) and PCB are derived from heme via the
  successive action of HMOX1 (purple rectangle) and PCYA1. PCB is hypothesized to
  be the chromophore cofactor of chlorochrome, which may target key enzymes involved
  in chlorophyll biosynthesis (represented by dashed blue lines). Feedback inhibition
  of ALA synthesis by heme is depicted with a dashed red line. Light-regulated steps
  of chlorophyll biosynthesis are indicated with red and blue lightning bolts, which
  represent red- and blue-light-dependent activity of the light-dependent protochlorophyllide
  oxidoreductase. Intermediates committed to chlorophyll, heme, and bilin pathways
  are colored in green, red, and teal, respectively. Enzymes, cofactors, and cosubstrates
  are shown next to arrows. Gene names of key enzymes include Mg-chelatase (CHLD,
  CHLH1, CHLI1/2, and GUN4), Mg-protoporphyrin O-methyltransferase (CHLM), copper
  response defect 1 (CRD1), copper target 1 (CTH1), light-dependent protochlorophyllide
  oxidoreductase (POR1), light-independent (dark) protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase
  (DPOR; encoded by plastid genes chlB, chlL, and chlN), chlorophyllide a oxygenase
  (CAO1), chlorophyll synthase (CHLG), ferrochelatase (HEM2), heme oxygenase (HMOX1),
  and phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PCYA1). Based on this work, hypothetical
  targets of blue-light-activated chlorochrome are shown with blue dashed arrows.
