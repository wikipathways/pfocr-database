caption: Apart from diffusion, the transport of free fatty acids (FA) across the brush
  border membrane (BBM) is facilitated by different proteins, such as plasma membrane
  fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm), fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), and
  fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). It is then translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) by cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP and I-FABP). MGAT and DGAT
  enzymes then convert MAG and FA to TAG with an intermediate synthesis of DAG.Cholesterol
  uptake is facilitated by Niemann-Pick C-1-like 1 (NPC1L1). There is evidence for
  the involvement of other proteins in this pathway such as SR-B1. In the intracellular
  compartment, free cholesterol has two fates. It can be exported back to the intestinal
  lumen by ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8 (ABCG5/8) or converted to cholesterol
  esters by acyl CoA cholesterol acyltransferases 1& 2 (ACAT1 & ACAT2).Newly translated
  apolipoprotein B (apoB-48) is lipidated by microsomal triglyceride transport protein
  (MTP) to form primordial chylomicrons (CM) that is further expanded in size by the
  addition of TAG in the core by MTP to form a pre-CM. These particles also acquire
  apoAIV at this time. Prechylomicrons are concentrated and exported from the ER in
  PCTVs. L-FABP facilitates the budding of PCTV from the ER. These vesicles then fuse
  with the cis-Golgi in a process that requires VAMP7. In the Golgi, apoA1 is added
  to prechylomicrons. Later, these particles are transported to plasma membrane using
  different transport vesicles and are ultimately released towards the basolateral
  side by enterocytes.TAG are exclusively transported via the CM pathway. By contrast,
  cholesterol is transported across the intestinal epithelial cells by two pathways.
  One pathway is the same as the CM pathway. In this pathway free cholesterol and
  esterified cholesterol are added onto CM by MTP. In the second apoB-independent
  pathway, cholesterol is secreted involving ABCA1 and apoAI.ApoAI is synthesized
  in the ER and transported independent of CMs to the Golgi where some of it associates
  with CMs and the rest is secreted independent of CMs. The free apoAI might play
  a role in cholesterol transport.
