caption: Complementary changes of transcript and metabolite levels indicating the
  activation of mitochondrial TCA cycle and of plastid biosynthetic pathways producing
  fatty acids, amino acids, and apocarotenoids. Enzymatic steps referring to TC sequences
  with significantly more EST clones in cDNA libraries from mycorrhizal when compared
  to nonmycorrhizal roots (R > 1.7) are marked in green. Confirmation of differential
  transcript levels by real-time RT-PCR is indicated by bold red arrows or red dots.
  Metabolites showing increased amounts in mycorrhizal roots are marked in red, and
  metabolites with decreased amounts are shown in blue. Increased amounts of metabolites
  might partially be due to fungal biosynthetic activity (see discussion). PPP, Pentose
  phosphate pathway; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; GAP, glycerinaldehyde 3-P.
