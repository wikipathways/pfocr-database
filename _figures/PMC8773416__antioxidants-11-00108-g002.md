caption: 'Glucose metabolism via the PPP and its role in redox pathways. The glycolytic
  intermediate glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) can be diverted into the PPP, which is an
  NADPH-producing pathway. In turn, NADPH is an electron donor for the de novo glutathione
  (GSH) system mediated by GSH reductase using glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to generate
  reduced glutathione (GSH). The GSH system is the most abundant intracellular non-protein
  thiol that exerts essential antioxidant roles against ROS in all animal cells. NADPH
  is also an important electron donor for the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex, and hence
  further contributing to stimulation of glucose metabolism via PPP. The NOX complex,
  however, produces the superoxide anion (O2·−), which is an anion radical that can
  be rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the action of superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) and further catalysed by catalase (CAT) producing oxygen and H2O. Abbreviations:
  6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; 6PGDH. 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; 6PGL, 6-Phosphogluconolactonase;
  6PGLS, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate.'
