caption: Proposed model for TLS pathway. Replication fork stalling uncouples the replicative
  helicase from normal high-fidelity DNA polymerases resulting in DNA unwinding and
  generation of tracts of ssDNA, which is coated by RPA. RPA-ssDNA serves to initiate
  the ATR-Chk1 pathway to activate cell cycle checkpoint control. RPA-ssDNA also recruits
  RAD18 E3-ligase to activate DNA damage tolerance pathway. PCNA monoubiquitinated
  at K164 (ub-PCNA) by RAD18-RAD6 operates as a molecular switch from normal DNA replication
  to the TLS. Under normal conditions ubiquitinated PAF15 is bound to PCNA. Upon DNA
  damage PAF15 is degraded by the proteasome and this facilitates the binding of TLS
  polymerase to ub-PCNA. Additionally, Spartan is recruited to DNA damage sites by
  ub-PCNA and is required to stabilize RAD18 and ub-PCNA on the chromatin. TLS polymerase
  Polη (Pol eta) bound to ub-PCNA, inserts a nucleotide directly opposite the lesion
  and requires an additional TLS polymerase, such as Polζ (Pol zeta), to extend beyond
  the insertion. Following extention, the second polymerase switch is initiated where
  the TLS polymerase is replaced by high fidelity replicative DNA polymerase. USP1
  deubiquitinates PCNA and DNA synthesis is resumed by high-fidelity replicative DNA
  polymerase. The precise mechanism of polymerase switching and regulation of TLS
  by Spartan, PAF15 and USP1 is still unclear
