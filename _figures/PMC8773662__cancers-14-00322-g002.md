caption: Resume of the metabolic changes taking place in tumor cells and interstitial
  cell subpopulations. Lactate is released into the interstitium, contributing to
  its acidification. The acidity and hypoxia of the interstitium and the relative
  deficit of glucose and amino acids induce functional changes in the various cell
  subpopulations of the interstitium, including myofibroblasts, endothelial cells,
  T lymphocytes, and macrophages, among others. All these changes mainly promote tumor
  growth. Upward pointing arrows indicate increased levels or activity of that molecule
  or pathway. The downward pointing arrows indicate the opposite. Created using BioRender.
