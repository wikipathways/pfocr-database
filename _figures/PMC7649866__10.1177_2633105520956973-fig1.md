caption: 'A diagram depicting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex pathway: During
  an infection, an inflammatory response causes a release of cytokines such as Interleukin
  (IL) 1β, IL 6 and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF α) in the systemic circulation.
  This leads to the activation of the afferent vagus nerve signalling to the brain.
  This signalling subsequently results in the activation of the anti-inflammatory
  efferent vagus nerve cholinergic signalling with the release of neurotransmitter,
  acetylcholine (ACh). The ACh then inhibits the release of cytokines from the macrophages,
  decreasing systemic cytokine levels. Adapted from Pavlov, et al., 2012.'
