caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin pathway repression
  by 1,25(OH)2D3 in human colon carcinoma cells. (a) Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated
  by mutation of APC, CTNNB1/β-catenin or AXIN genes, or by deregulated signaling
  from Wnt plasma membrane receptors. These alterations cause accumulation of β-catenin
  protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus and transcription of its target genes; (b)
  1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity in colon carcinoma cells
  by several mechanisms. It promotes VDR/β-catenin binding, thus reducing the amount
  of β-catenin bound to TCF (1); it induces the expression of CDH1 gene coding for
  E-cadherin, which sequesters β-catenin at the plasma membrane adherens junctions
  (2); and it enhances the expression of the extracellular Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 (3)
  and of TCF4 (4). Additional paracrine mechanisms of antagonism have been proposed.
