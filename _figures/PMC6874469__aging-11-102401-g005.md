caption: 'ERβ/Ptgds signalling pathway imbalance disrupting renal lipid metabolism
  and continues influencing ‘hypothalamus-uterus-kidney axis’ (HUK axis) function.
  During ovary failure, a significant downregulation of ERβ (green bubble) leads to
  PTGDS overexpression (green helix shape) due to persistent releasing ‘estrogen secretion’
  instruction from hypothalamus after ovary failure. We call this ‘fake – immunity’.
  This would further activate the generation of PGD2 and its derivatives (orange bubbles,
  each compound represent by blue hexagon shape) in renal cells (yellow cell structure),
  and inhibit them exert into body fluid circulation through the autocrine and paracrine
  pathways to reach other intracellular targets (serum: light pink colour; urine:
  light yellow colour). Therefore, extensively accumulation of these Ptgds regulated
  metabolites promote kidney lipid toxicity progression (cytoskeleton destruction,
  grey blue colour part in left panel), then kidney microenvironments disturbance
  occurs; consequently, inhibition of Ptgds transmission along the ‘hypothalamus-uterus-kidney
  axis’ result in its decreased expression in hypothalamus neurocyte (green cell structure).
