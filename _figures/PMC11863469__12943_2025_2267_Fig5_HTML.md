caption: Regorafenib targets key pathways involved in tumor progression, including
  stromal kinases (FGFR, PDGFR) that regulate the TME, angiogenic kinases (VEGFRs,
  Tie-2) critical for blood vessel formation and stabilization, and oncogenic kinases
  (RET, KIT) that drive tumor cell proliferation and survival. A notable mechanism
  of action is its inhibition of CSF-1R on macrophages, which disrupts the development
  and maintenance of tumor-TAMs. By targeting TAMs, regorafenib diminishes its role
  in promoting tumor growth and immune evasion, shifting the TME toward an anti-angiogenic
  and anti-proliferative state. Additionally, regorafenib’s inhibition of VEGFRs and
  Tie-2 enhances its anti-angiogenic effects by reducing the formation of blood vessels
  necessary for tumor growth and metastasis
