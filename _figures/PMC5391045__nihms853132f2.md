caption: 'The network diagrams were generated using ToppCluster (www.toppcluster.cchmc.org)
  software. Gene lists were derived from clinically available next generation sequencing
  panels for cardiomyopathy (n=50) and CHD (n=44). A) Abstracted cluster network showing
  a selected subset of features from the following categories: Gene ontology (GO)
  GO: molecular function; GO: biological processes; GO: cellular component; human
  phenotype; mouse phenotype; pathway; disease (cardiomyopathy, CHD). The features
  are color coded by category and connected to cardiomyopathy (white circle ) and
  CHD gene nodes. B) Gene level network with nodes (blue) selected from features in
  GO: biological processes category. The network illustrates that regulation of cellular
  component of movement, actin filament-based processes, and cardiac chamber morphogenesis
  are shared in common between cardiomyopathy and CHD genes, whereas regulation of
  force of heart contraction and tube development are unshared.'
