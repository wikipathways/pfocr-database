caption: Cytoplasmic chromatin DNA activates the cGAS‐STING pathway and induces type
  I IFN and senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) production, which promote
  cellular senescence. Uptake of tumor‐derived DNA may lead to activation of the cGAS‐STING
  pathway in DCs and production of type I IFN, which regulates cross‐priming of CD8+
  T cells for anti‐tumor immunity. Immune checkpoint pathways of PD‐L1/PD‐1 and B7/CTLA‐4
  negatively regulate CD8+ T cell activity killing cancer cells. Combinatory treatments
  with CDNs augment the anti‐tumor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti‐PD‐1,
  ‐PD‐L1, ‐CTLA4 antibodies), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
