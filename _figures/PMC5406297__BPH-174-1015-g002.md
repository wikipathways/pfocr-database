caption: Effects of insulin窶人ike peptide 3 (INSL3) on osteoblasts. INSL3 is constitutively
  released by the Leydig cells of the testis under the control of luteinizing hormone
  (LH). Once in the bloodstream, INSL3 acts on osteoblasts through RXFP2, the INSL3
  receptor. The downstream signalling pathway of INSL3 in osteoblasts involves the
  activation of adenylate cyclase (AC), the increase in intracellular cAMP levels
  and the downstream activation of MAPK. The action of INSL3 on osteoblasts finally
  results in cell proliferation and differentiation, extracellular matrix formation
  (collagen and matrix proteins), mineralization and indirect regulation of osteoclastogenesis
  to maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption.
