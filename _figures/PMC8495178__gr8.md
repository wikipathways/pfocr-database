caption: m6A modification induces HSC ferroptosis by regulating autophagy signaling
  pathway. The upregulation of methylase METTL4 and the downregulation of demethylase
  FTO increased the levels of m6A modifications in BECN1 mRNA. m6A reader YTHDF1 promoted
  BECN1 mRNA stability via recognizing the m6A binding site, thus triggering autophagy
  activation, and eventually leading to HSC ferroptosis.
