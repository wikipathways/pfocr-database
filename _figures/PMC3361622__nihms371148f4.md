caption: 'Here we present a schematic of the immunosuppressive pathways throughout
  the brain tumor and molecular inhibitors that reverse the potent immunosuppression.
  It has previously been demonstrated that glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells, as
  well as tumor-resident dendritic cells (DC) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (mSC) express indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). IDO1 expression is regulated
  by the Jak/STAT and NF-κB pathways, which can be induced by IFN-γ- and TGF-β-receptor
  activation, respectively. IDO1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme that metabolizes tryptophan
  (Tryp.) to kynurenine (Kyn.), the latter of which has a potently suppressive effect
  on T effector responses and an inducing effect on Treg function. In contrast, IDO1
  can also directly activate NF-κB signaling which is able to maintain and/or upregulate
  TGF-β expression. The increased TGF-β levels reinforce Treg-expressed CTLA-4 and
  GITR. CTLA-4 directly interacts with B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) on DCs, resulting
  in downregulation of further T cell stimulation. The GBM and mSC both express TGF-β,
  which can synergize with PD-L1 to suppress the T cell effector response. By targeting
  one of more of these immunoregulatory pathways regulated by GBM, it may be possible
  to reverse the immunosuppression. Candidate targets for immunoregulatory suppression
  are shown in red. Note: Although IDO1 expression and signaling are only shown in
  GBM cells, a similar mechanistic pattern is presumed to also occur in DC and mSC.
