caption: Acetyl-CoA production from fatty acid and glucose metabolism in muscle mitochondria.
  Fatty acids enter the cells by fatty acid transporters. Once in the cell they are
  activated to fatty acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) before entering the mitochondria.
  At the level of the outer part of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), fatty
  acyl-CoAs are bind to carnitine, by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity,
  to form fatty acylcarnitine derivatives which diffuse through the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. Thus, the formed fatty acylcarnitines are transported across the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM) via carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). In
  the mitochondrial matrix, CPT-2 converts fatty acylcarnitines back to fatty acyl-CoAs,
  which enters the β-oxidation pathway, and to free carnitine which can exit from
  the mitochondria in exchange with other acylcarnitines through CACT. Mitochondrial
  acetyl-CoA is generated from both β-oxidation of fatty acids and from pyruvate.
  Pyruvate is formed in the glycolytic pathway form glucose which enters the muscle
  cell via the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). Pyruvate is transported in the
  mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate carrier (MPC) of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
  Once in the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA throughout the complex
  of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). This acetyl-CoA, together with that formed
  in the β-oxidation pathway can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to
  produce equivalent donors in the form of NADH (H+) and FADH2 which are oxidized
  in the mitochondrial electron transport chain to produce ATP.
