caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/VEGF pathway. Aging often causes reduced ROS
  clearance and increased ROS activity. Accumulation of ROS in cells can cause mtDNA
  mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction and then result in decreased levels of VEGF.
  Decreased levels of VEGF may lead to Aβ deposition and hamper the repair of hair
  cells and spiral ganglions in the inner ear as well as the reconstruction of blood
  vessels in the brain, resulting in dementia or presbycusis. Further studies are
  still needed to determine whether there is a time order of the occurrence of both
  diseases and whether hearing loss caused by a decrease of VEGF will further increase
  the risk of dementia and its progression.
