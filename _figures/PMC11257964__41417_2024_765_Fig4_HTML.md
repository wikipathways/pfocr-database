caption: PANoptosis can occur in response to cellular stress or certain microbial
  infections, such as the IAV. When specific sensors, like ZBP1 are triggered, the
  assembly of the PANoptosome is formally initiated. This, in turn, promotes the activation
  of effectors, including the GSDMD/GSDME, caspase-3/7, and MLKL, and ultimately leads
  to inflammatory cell death as well as the release of DAMPs and PAMPs. The process
  of PANoptosis is an intricate form of cell death whose mechanism is regulated by
  several crucial components. These parts come from important members of the apoptosis,
  pyroptosis, and necroptosis signaling pathways, including ZBP1, the caspase family,
  NLRP3, RIPK1, and RIPK3. Targeting these regulatory molecules in the PANoptosis
  signaling pathway is promising for the treatment of certain diseases, especially
  cancer. Other methods, such as the utilization of nanoparticles to activate PANoptosis,
  have also been demonstrated to possess therapeutic potential
