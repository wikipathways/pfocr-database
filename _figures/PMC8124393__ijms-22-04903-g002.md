caption: LncRNAs involved in the relevant signaling pathways implicated in oral cancer
  progression. (a) Wnt/β-catenin signaling. LncRNAs, such as AC007271.3, MALAT1, PLAC2,
  SNHG3, TUG1, and UCA1, could activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling mainly through inducing
  β-catenin accumulation. The increased β-catenin would further translocate into the
  nucleus and bind to LEF/TCF transcription factors to activate the downstream effectors,
  promoting the malignant behavior of oral cancer cells. In addition, lncRNA LINC00941
  could induce the expression of Caprin-2, which further promotes the phosphorylation
  of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6, and thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (b)
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Several lncRNAs are able to target the different components
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to affect oral cancer progression. Overexpression of
  lncRNA MALAT1 could increase the phosphorylation of PI3K to induce PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling, thereby promoting the EMT and cisplatin resistance of OSCC. Another lncRNA
  GAS5 could suppress the malignant behavior of OSCC by serving as ceRNA to sequester
  miR-21 and thereby reverting the miR-21-mediated repression of PTEN, a negative
  regulator of PI3K signaling. In addition, lncRNA CASC9 could enhance cell proliferation
  by inhibiting autophage-mediated cell apoptosis via inducing AKT phosphorylation
  and the subsequent activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in OSCC.
