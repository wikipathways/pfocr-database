caption: Schematic model depicting the subcellular localization of ZO-2, CD1, and
  GSK-3β during the cell cycle. At the early stages of G1, CD1 enters the nucleus
  and initiates cell cycle progression toward the S phase. At the later stages of
  G1, ZO-2 is imported into the nucleus. GSK-3β enters the nucleus at the S phase,
  and ZO-2 decreases the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 by a yet unknown
  pathway. Activated GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 at Thr286, triggering CD1 nuclear
  export, ubiquitination, and degradation by the 26S proteasome. At mitosis, ZO-2
  leaves the nucleus and is speculatively recruited to the emerging cell borders of
  the dividing cells. Time indicated in purple corresponds to time after nocodazole
  washout, whereas time indicated in brown represents time after mimosine washout.
