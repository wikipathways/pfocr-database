caption: 'Extracellular vesicles release is a highly organized and conserved phenomenon.
  b Cells release a wide range of extracellular vesicles, including large EVs like
  microvesicles and apoptotic bodies, small EVs known as exosomes, and small particles
  (< 50 nm) recently named exomeres. a Up to date biogenesis pathways of small EVs:
  1 tetraspanin-enriched microdomains; 2 Sendycan-syntenin-ALIX: The cytosolic adaptor
  syntenin reacts with sendycan through its PDZ domains and with ALIX via three LYPXnL
  motifs. In turn, ALIX binds to ESCRT-III, which promotes intraluminal vesicle budding.
  ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I recruit the small EVs cargo, while Rab27 helps the multi-vesicular
  body (MVB) fusion with the cell membrane; 3 MVB could be directed to lysosomes for
  degradation with the help of RAB7, RAB5, and the autophagy-related protein LC3.
  As a new ESCRT-independent pathway for small EVs biogenesis, RAB31 has been found
  to recruit GTPase-activating protein (TBC1D2B) that inactivates RAB7 and thereby
  favors EVs content secretion rather than the degradation in lysosomes. 4 Sphingomyelinase
  catalyzes the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Ceramide
  enriched endosomes tend to form inward buds ending in ILV formation'
