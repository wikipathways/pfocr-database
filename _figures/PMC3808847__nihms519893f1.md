caption: Kisspeptin and Neurokinin B Pathway Deficiencies and Resulting Phenotypes
  in Mice and Men. Neurokinin B (NKB) is hypothesized to regulate kisspeptin (Kiss1)
  release which in turn stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release and
  normal reproductive function (left panel). It remains unclear at this time whether
  NKB might also directly regulate GnRH release (dotted line). NKB pathway deficiency
  (middle panel) is hypothesized to cause a decrease in Kiss1 and subsequently GnRH
  release resulting in idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) with a subset
  of patients “reversing” later in life; NKB pathway deficient mice are subfertile.
  In contrast Kiss1 pathway deficiencies appear to result in a more dramatic decrease
  in GnRH release causing life-long IHH in humans and complete infertility in mice.
