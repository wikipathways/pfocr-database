caption: In the nucleus, TAF7 acts as a checkpoint regulator of transcription through
  its regulation of the enzymatic activities of TAF1/TFIID, TFIIH/CDK7, BRD4, and
  P-TEFb/CDK9. TAF7 can also function as an RNA chaperone, binding RNA transcripts,
  and transporting them into the cytoplasm through an XPO1-dependent pathway. In the
  cytoplasm, TAF7 delivers its RNA cargo to polysomes to promote protein translation.
  Subsequent release of RNA from TAF7 reveals its NLS enabling the import of cytoplasmic
  TAF7 back to the nucleus.
