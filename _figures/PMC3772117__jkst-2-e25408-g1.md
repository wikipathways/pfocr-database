caption: Figure 1. The Drosophila JAK-STAT pathway. Three Unpaired (Upd) ligands here
  collectively referred to as Upd (orange) activate a dimeric receptor Domeless (Dome)
  (magenta). This results in activation of the JAK Hopscotch (Hop) (green), leading
  to tyrosine phosphorylation of Dome. The phosphorylated receptor/JAK complex phosphorylates
  STAT92E dimer (blue) on Y711, generating an active STAT92E dimer. A consensus TTCNNNGAA
  site is bound by the activated STAT92E dimer, leading altered gene expression. One
  of the best-characterized STAT92E target genes is Socs36E, encoding a negative regulator
  of JAK/receptor activity (pink). A second receptor Eye Transformer (ET) (also called
  Latran [Lat]), referred to as ET/Lat (red), forms heterodimers with Dome and inhibits
  JAK-STAT signaling. Brown circles represent phospho-tyrosine residues.
