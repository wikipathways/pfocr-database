caption: The proposed SL biosynthetic pathway. SLs are derived from the carotenoid
  pathway, branching out from 9-cis-β-10 carotene by the action of iron-binding carotenoid
  isomerase DWARF27 (D27) in rice or AtD27 to generate 9-cis-β-10 carotene. The carotenoid
  cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7), which is encoded by Arabidopsis More Axillary Growth3
  (AtMAX3), rice D17/HTD1 or pea Ramosus (RMS)5, and petunia Decreased Apical Dominance
  (DAD)3, catalyzes 9-cis-β-10 carotene into 9-cis-β-10 carotenal. CCD8, encoded by
  AtMAX4/D10/RMS1/DAD1, then converts 9-cis-β-10 carotenal into carlactone. In Arabidopsis,
  MAX1 converts carlactone into MeCLA and lateral branching oxidoreductase (LBO) converts
  the MAX1-derived MeCLA (methyl carlactonoate) carlactonoic acid (CLA) that is subsequently
  converted to methyl carlactonoate (MeCLA) by the unidentified methyl transferase,
  and finally lateral branching oxidoreductase (LBO) converts the MAX1-derived MeCLA
  into hydroxy methyl carlactonoate (OH-MeCLA), whereas in rice, MAX1/CYP711A2 converts
  CLA that is then converted to 4-deoxystrigol (4-DO) by CYP711A2 (Os900), and finally
  CYP711A3 (Os1400) further catalyzes 4-DO to yield orobanchol. Bioactive SLs are
  perceived by the α/β-fold protein D14 acting as an SL receptor. D14 interacts with
  D3/AtMAX2 to form the D14-SCFD3/AtMAX2 ubiquitination complex, through which the
  SL signaling repressor D53/SMXL6,7,8 was degraded by a 26S proteosome pathway.
