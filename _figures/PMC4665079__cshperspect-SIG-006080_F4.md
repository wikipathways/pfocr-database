caption: 'Death receptor signaling pathway. The death receptor signaling pathway is
  triggered by ligation of a death receptor (TNFR1, Fas, or TRAIL-R1/2) and potentially
  leads to three different outcomes: survival, apoptosis, or necrosis. (A) Upon ligation
  (by FasL and TRAIL, respectively), Fas/CD95 and TRAIL-Rs assemble a caspase-activation
  platform called the DISC. This platform recruits and activates caspase-8 via the
  adaptor protein FADD and thus engages the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. (B) Upon
  ligation to TNF, TNFR1 recruits the adaptor protein TRADD and the kinase RIP1, which
  in turn mobilizes additional partners, such as the ubiquitin ligases TRAF2 and cIAP1/2.
  These catalyze the nondegradative ubiquitylation of RIP1 as well as other components
  of the protein complex, resulting in the stabilization of a prosurvival and proinflammatory
  signaling platform called complex I. (C) The removal of ubiquitin chains of RIP1
  by inhibition of cIAP1/2 or through the action of deubiquitylases destabilizes complex
  I, thus allowing the release of TRADD and RIP1. TRADD and RIP1 then promote the
  formation of a series of cytosolic complexes (complex II) that can initiate either
  apoptotic or necrotic cell death. In the proapoptotic configuration of the complex,
  TRADD and RIP1 recruit FADD and caspase-8, resulting in caspase activation and apoptosis.
  When FADD or caspase-8 are absent, or when caspase activity is blocked, RIP1 binds
  to and activates RIP3, thus triggering necrotic cell death. Expression of FLICE-like
  inhibitory protein (FLIP) inhibits the activity of both complexes. FLIP forms a
  heterodimer with caspase-8 that cannot induce apoptosis but still displays catalytic
  activity, and this activity antagonizes the activation of RIP3. Therefore, complexes
  containing FLIP–caspase-8 heterodimers simultaneously block apoptosis and RIP-dependent
  necrosis.'
