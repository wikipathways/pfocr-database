caption: Age-associated disruption of signaling pathways at the NMJs. Normal adult
  (upper panel) and aged (lower panel) neuromuscular junctions are depicted showing
  major dysregulated pathways. NRG-ErbB -mediated signaling, implicated in NMJ stability
  and sprouting of tSCs, could also be involved in the migration of tSCs during aging
  that results in partial coverage of the NMJ. The cell surface glycoprotein CD44
  seems to increase tSC plasticity, at least in ALS and aging mouse models. Agrin-MuSK
  pathway is essential for NMJ maintenance. The dysregulation of agrin levels in tSCs
  could induce NMJ destabilization during sarcopenia. Intracellular S100 proteins
  present altered expression in aged tSCs, which in turn affects Ca2+-mediated signaling.
