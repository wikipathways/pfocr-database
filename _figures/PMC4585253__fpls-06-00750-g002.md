caption: Overview of molecular and biochemical events used by biotrophic or hemibiotrophic
  bacteria to acquire nutrients during apoplast colonization. Pathogenic bacteria
  use several strategies to acquire nutrients. They can either modulate their own
  machinery or manipulate plant cell machinery to acquire nutrients. During modulation
  of their own machinery, bacteria activate various transporters and take up nutrients
  that are present in apoplast. They can secrete cellulose degrading enzyme to release
  cell wall-bound nutrients (Cw-Inv). For uptake of less preferred nutrients they
  use two different ways. First, by secreting enzyme in apoplasm that converts undesirable
  form of nutrient into desirable form and then take up that desirable form of nutrient
  by transporter. Second, the uptake of less preferred nutrient by specific transporter
  and then suitably metabolize its energy. Sucrose specific phosphotransferase system
  is shown here for uptake of sucrose in the form of sucrose-6-phosphate (S6P) and
  catabolize it into fructose (F) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Type III secretion
  system (TTSS) delivered effectors target expression of sugar transporter-encoding
  genes of host cell. Effector-mediated induction of SWEET (sugar will eventually
  be exported transporter) transporter for increasing sugar eﬄux in apoplast is shown
  here. Also induction of sugar biosynthesis genes for high sugar synthesis in cytosol
  and its movement to apoplast is shown. Expression of host cell wall-invertase-mediated
  conversion of sucrose into glucose and fructose in apoplast is depicted. α-Ketoglutaric
  acid transporter (KgtP) secreted by bacterial pathogen though TTSS and its localization
  in host cell membrane and the eﬄux of α-ketoglutaric acid from host cell into apoplasm
  is illustrated. Enzyme II BC, Fructose specific phosphotransferase system; SSPTS,
