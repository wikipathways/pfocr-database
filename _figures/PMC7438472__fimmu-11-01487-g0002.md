caption: Activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. Cytosolic DNA [DNA virus, poly(dA:dT)]
  is directly recognized by AIM2 and leads to the “canonical” activation of AIM2 inflammasome.
  Cytosolic bacteria activate AIM2 inflammasome via a type I IFN-dependent “non-canonical”
  pathway. Intracellular bacteria escape the vacuole and release small amounts of
  DNA, which is detected by cGAS and IFI204. Then type I IFN is synthesized and drives
  the expression of IRF1 in an autocrine manner. Upon the expression of IRF1, GBP2/GBP5
  and IRGB10 are produced and cause the rupture of bacterial/vacuolar membrane, exposing
  a mass of DNA for AIM2 to recognize. Finally, assembly of the AIM2 inflammasome
  causes proteolytic activation of IL-1β/IL-18 and GSDMD. GSDMD forms pores on the
  cell membrane that allow the secretion of IL-1β/IL-18. AIM2, absent in melanoma
  2; GSDMD, gasdermin D; IFN, interferon; IFNAR, IFN α and β receptor; cGAS, cyclic-GMP-AMP
  synthase; IFI204, IFN activated gene 204; IRF1, IFN regulatory factor 1; GBP, guanylate-binding
  protein; IRGB10, immunity-related GTPase family member b10.
