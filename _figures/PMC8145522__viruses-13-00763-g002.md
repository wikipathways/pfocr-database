caption: Summary of flavivirus ubiquitin-mediated antagonism of IFN production. (A)
  (1) ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8)
  to cleave ubiquitin from caspase-1, stabilizing caspase-1 and allowing increased
  cleavage and degradation of the pattern recognition receptor, cGAS []. (2) ZIKV
  NS3 protein is ubiquitinated by an unknown host enzyme, leading to the enhanced
  formation of the serine protease complex, NS32B. This leads to increased binding
  of STING and possibly increased STING cleavage [,]. NS3 also mediates ubiquitination
  and degradation of MAVS []. (3) DENV2 subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) binds the
  E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and prevents its deubiquitination by USP15. This downregulates
  TRIM25 and results in diminished RIG-I ubiquitination and attenuated RIG-I-mediated
  signaling []. (B) RBM10 is a putative activator and mediator of RIG-I ubiquitination.
  DENV NS5 binds and mediates the proteasomal degradation of RBM10 []. (C) The interaction
  of WNV NS1 with RIG-I correlates with a global decrease in K63-linked ubiquitination
  of RIG-I. This change results in its degradation suggesting that NS1 is mediating
  this effect. The ubiquitin-modifying enzyme is unknown []. (D) The serine protease
  complex NS3-NS4A of flavivirus-related hepatitis C virus (HCV) cleaves Riplet, an
  E3 ligase required for ample activation of RIG-I by ubiquitination, as well as MAVS
  to antagonize the RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway []. Riplet may also function as an
  E3 ligase to activate TBK1 or IRF3 directly or indirectly, an effect that is disrupted
  by NS4A [].
