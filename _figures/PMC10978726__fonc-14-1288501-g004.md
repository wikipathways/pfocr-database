caption: Involvement of SKP2 in hematological malignanices. SKP2, a critical player
  in hematological malignancies, features prominently in various cancers including
  acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and T-cell acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma,
  primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Extranodal
  natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma and myeloproliferative diseases. Mediated through
  diverse pathways such as PI3K/Akt, NFkB, and MYC, overexpression of SKP2 is often
  correlated with aggressive disease and poor outcomes, highlighting its significance
  in cancer biology and emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic interventions
