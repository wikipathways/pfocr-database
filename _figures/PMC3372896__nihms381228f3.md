caption: Intersection of pathways controlling Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cadherin-mediated
  adhesion. Connections between cadherin and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways are
  based on studies in tissue culture cells and in tissues, and some involve manipulations
  of protein levels and expression patterns (for details, see text). All possible
  intersections between these pathways and their outcomes are represented together
  as a map, although individual pathways are likely to occur only in specific physiological
  contexts. Pathways that activate are indicated by solid green, pathways that reduce
  activity are indicated in solid red, and indirect consequences of pathway activation
  or inactivation are indicated by dotted lines.
