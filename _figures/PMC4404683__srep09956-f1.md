caption: AKT/mTOR deactivation decreases MDM2 and p53 phosphorylation and increases
  stable p53, which triggers its downstream targets. Simultaneously, p53 may increase
  PTEN to suppress AKT activation further. FC85 inhibited both AKT (Ser473) and mTOR
  (Ser2448) phosphorylation. ISA27 dissociated the MDM2-p53 complex, thus re-activating
  p53. The combined therapy with FC85+ISA27 more efficiently re-activated the p53
  pathway, producing a synergic effect on the inhibition of GBM cell viability; most
  importantly, the simultaneous inhibition of AKT/mTOR and of the MDM2-p53 complex
  led to a synergic effect in triggering cellular differentiation/apoptosis of GSC
  subpopulation. (b) The design of FC85 starting from the general structure of OXIDs.
  (c) The synthetic procedure for the preparation of FC85.
