caption: a Following MI, compensatory remodeling promotes partial recovery of LV function
  in the early weeks following the index event. In hemorrhagic infarction, the extravasated
  red blood cells promote active inflammation and participate in the formation of
  fat deposition within the infarction zone. This renders the hemorrhagic MI highly
  active with respect to functional losses, which define chronic heart failure (CHF).
  In contrast, non-hemorrhagic MIs are not iron-rich and do not result in prolonged
  inflammation or promote fat deposition, which stabilizes the infarct zone leading
  to stable functional remodeling in the chronic phase of infarction. b Iron mediates
  a recurring cycle of events contributing to fat deposition in the chronic phase
  of hemorrhagic MI. Iron from hemorrhage promotes the recruitment of unpolarized
  macrophages and oxidizes the lipids in its vicinity; the oxidized lipid and iron
  are taken up by the macrophages, which promote their polarization into a pro-inflammatory
  state and transform into foam cells. The foam cells produce ceroids and destabilize
  the lysosomes and drive foam cell apoptosis, the remnants of which participate in
  fat deposition, with the released iron recycled to enter the pathway which perpetuates
  to continually support inflammation and growth of the fat depot.
