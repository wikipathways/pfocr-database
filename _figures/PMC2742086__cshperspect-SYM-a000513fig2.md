caption: Functional and structural organization of migratory mesenchymal cells. (A)
  Front–rear polarity overview. Migratory cells have a distinctive organization between
  the front of the cell (leading edge) and rear (uropod). Rho family GTPase activities
  have different functions in inducing actin polymerization at the leading edge (Cdc42,
  Rac1), and actomyosin contraction at the rear (RhoA). The centrosome, microtubules,
  and the secretory pathway (Golgi) are oriented toward the front of the cell. Endocytic
  and exocytic pathways are also oriented in the rear–front orientation, which allows
  internalization of integrins from the rear, and exocytosis and endocytosis of integrins
  in the front, all of which are required for cell migration. Phosphatidylinositides
  have a polarized distribution in the front–rear polarity. Polarity protein complexes
  are localized to the front of the cell (Scribble/DLG and PAR/aPKC). (B) Front–rear
  polarity signaling pathways. Polarity protein complexes (blue) are upstream and
  downstream of Rho small GTPases (Rac1 and Cdc42) and their downstream effectors
  (yellow) and end-point effects (white). For details, see text.
