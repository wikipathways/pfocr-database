caption: Sulfate reduction pathway leading to the production of sulfur-containing
  amino acids and compounds. (1) Extracellular sulfate is taken up through two transporters,
  Sul1 and Sul2, and sequentially reduced to sulfite and sulfide. (2) Excess sulfide
  can be converted to hydrogen sulfide which diffuses out of the cell or (3) assimilated
  into amino acid synthesis pathways. (4) Production of α-ketobutyrate links this
  pathway to threonine and the branched amino acid synthesis pathways (Fig. ). (5)
  Methionine can be acted on by a lyase to form methanethiol, which is a major precursor
  for numerous sulfur-containing aroma compounds. (6) Methanethiol can also be produced
  via transamination of methionine, which is also the first step of the Ehrlich pathway
  (Fig. ). Adapted from Landaud (2008), Pereira et al. (), and Saccharomyces Genome
  Database (Cherry et al.).
