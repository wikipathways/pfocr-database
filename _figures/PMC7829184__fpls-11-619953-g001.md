caption: A comprehensive model for ABA in regulating strawberry fruit ripening. The
  regulation of ABA in strawberry fruit ripening is involved in conserved and novel
  signaling mechanisms. ABA in fleshy fruits is perceived by its receptors, PYR/PYL/RCAR
  and ABAR, which initiates signal transduction, including the conserved signaling
  pathway ABA-PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2-ABF/AREB in both Arabidopsis and strawberry
  (signaling pathway 1) and the novel signaling pathway ABA-FaABAR-FaRIPK1-FaABI4
  in strawberry (signaling pathway 2). In strawberry ABA signaling, ABAR/FaRIPK1 serves
  as a receptor complex, which is distinct from the Arabidopsis ABA-ABAR-WRKY40-ABI4/ABI5
  signaling pathway (signaling pathway 3). ABA interacts with several synergistically-regulated
  molecules such as ethylene, sugar, polyamines, auxin, and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) during strawberry fruit ripening. The symbols (→, ⟞, and ↔) represent promotion,
  inhibition, and cooperation, respectively. ABA, abscisic acid; ABAR, putative abscisic
