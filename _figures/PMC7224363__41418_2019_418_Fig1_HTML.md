  also known as Stearoyl-CoA-desaturases (SCD), introducing a double bond and thus
  affecting lipid metabolism. b Crystal structure of SCD1. PDB file 4YMK. c Inhibition
  of SCD1 induces cell death via ferroptosis by impinging on lipid metabolism. Indeed,
  ferroptosis and SCD1 enzymatic action share a number of lipid mediators, linking
  the two phenomena. At the same time it acts on cancer stem cells by regulating the
  autocrine Wnt pathway and the hippo pathway, shown on the intracellular right side,
  as well as by regulating apoptotic programmed cell death, not shown. Both actions
  contribute to the regulation of different stages of cancer progression, as highlighted
  on the far right. See main text for details. ACC acetyl-CoA carboxylase, FAS fatty
