caption: 'Mechanism of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.Notes: 1) Androgens bind
  and activate the AR despite the castration of testes-derived androgens. Androgens
  are secreted from other sources such as adrenal glands, adipose tissue, and intratumoral
  testosterone production.– 2) Prostate cancer cells become sensitized to low levels
  of circulating androgens post-castration by increasing the production of AR via
  gene amplification and by increasing the local conversion of testosterone to potent
  dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via 5alpha-reductase.– 3) Promiscuous pathway. Mutations
  (mostly missense) of the LBD of AR expand the binding specificity, allowing non-androgenic
  steroids, such as estrogen (E), progesterone (P), and glucocorticoid (G) to bind
  and activate the AR.– 4) Alternative splicing within the NTD or LBD of the AR gene
  allows the AR protein to translocate and bind the DNA without the need for ligand
  binding or dimerization., Some AR splice variants promote castration resistance
  and anchorage-independent growth through coupling to the full-length AR mRNA production.
  5) Alteration of the levels of coactivators and co-repressors, signaling intermediates
  between the AR and transcriptional machinery, affect the AR activation by sensitizing
  to lower levels of androgen and alternative activation mechanisms.– 6) Bypass pathway.
  Prostate cancer cells develop the ability to evade apoptosis and survive when exposed
  to low levels of androgen via upregulation of the molecule Bcl-2, a regulator of
  programmed cell death.– 7) Stem cell regeneration may continually supply the androgen-independent
  population of prostate cancer cells after ADT.–Abbreviations: AR, androgen receptor;
  LBD, ligand binding domain; NTD, amino-terminal domain; ADT, androgen deprivation
  therapy; CRPC, castration resistant prostate cancer; PSA, prostate-specific antigen;
  mRNA, messenger RNA; LH, luteinizing hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone.'
