caption: BBR and its derivatives are involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress mechanisms.
  They influence the endoplasmic reticulum stress by acting on the PERK, ATF6, IRE1,
  and CHOP pathways; sharp arrows (→) indicate stimulation, and blunt arrows (⊥) indicate
  inhibition. The figure was drawn using Figdraw
