caption: Still’ disease interactome a considering all disease effectors and their
  direct interactors and b focusing on disease effectors and their interaction to
  drug targets, and comparison to c pathway enrichment results of sJIA gene expression
  data. The network around Still’s disease characterization was constructed using
  the bibliographic characterization and interaction databases (a) presents enrichment
  of pathways found also enriched within the independent disease expression data (c).
  The network created around Still’s disease includes all drug targets evaluated in
  the study directly interacting with at least one effector of the disease (b). ANA,
  anakinra; CAN, canakinumab; CS, corticosteroids; MTX, methotrexate; SAR, sarilumab;
  TCZ, tocilizumab
