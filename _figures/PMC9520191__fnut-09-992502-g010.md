caption: Schematic illustration depicts that a new approach was carried out to bind
  AMP with ZnONPs as an immunostimulator. AMP-ZnONPs could significantly activate
  RAW264.7 cells by TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to improve its immune function.
  Therefore, AMP-ZnONPs remarkably enhanced phagocytosis, the release of NO, cytokines
  and the costimulatory molecules of RAW264.7 cells.
