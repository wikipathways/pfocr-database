caption: Signalling pathways associated with PRDXs and hypothetical illustration of
  PRDXs in mouse spermatozoa. (A) Protein-protein interactions, cellular regulations,
  and associated diseases related to PRDX activity illustrated using the Pathway Studio
  program. (B) Hypothetical illustration demonstrates the effect of conoidin A on
  sperm function and fertilisation. Conoidin A decreases PRDX activity in spermatozoa,
  which is associated with the alteration of several sperm functions, including motility,
  viability, and capacitation status, perhaps as a consequence of altered reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), DNA fragmentation index (DFI), mitochondrial membrane potential
  (MMP), ATP levels, PKA activity, and tyrosine phosphorylation. All of these changes
  ultimately affect fertilisation and early embryonic development.
