caption: 'Acute myocarditis can result from an overt immune response to exposure to
  cardiotropic pathogens, and cardiac damage can be due to the production of inflammatory
  cytokines of innate and adaptive immune systems. On one hand, although transitory,
  dsRNAs produced during the replication cycle of CVB3 can bind TLR-3 or TLR-7 and
  promote inflammatory response through the activation of NFkB. On the other, dsRNAs
  can mediate viral clearance by degrading the viral genome by activating IRF-3 /
  IRF-7 pathways. Various innate immune cell types, such as γδ T cells, NK-T cells
  and mast cells, can influence the disease-outcome. While γδ T cells and mast cells
  promote cardiac damage, NK-T cells can dampen such a response. Exposure to environmental
  microbes that carry mimicry sequences for cardiac antigens can lead to the generation
  of pathogenic cross-reactive T cell and antibody responses. Nonetheless, once cardiac
  damage sets in, intracellular proteins (e.g., Myhc-α) that were previously invisible
  to the immune system can be released as a result of epitope spreading, leading to
  their uptake by APCs (e.g., DCs) and inducing CD4 T cell responses. Alternatively,
  APCs can engulf infected cardiomyocytes and induce both CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses
  via cross-priming. Upon activation, antigen-sensitized CD4 T cells secrete Th1 and
  Th17 cytokines that favor heart autoimmunity by activating macrophages and promoting
  neutrophil infiltration, thereby aggravating cardiac damage while providing help
  to CD8 T cells and B cells via cytokines and chemokines. CD8 T cells can contribute
  to myocarditis in two ways: 1) secretion of cytokines similar to those secreted
  by CD4 T cells with identical consequences; and 2) killing of cardiomyocytes infected
  with cardiotropic pathogens (e.g., CVB3) via MHC class I-dependent pathway. In the
  meantime, pathogen-specific T cells, neutralizing antibodies and antiviral cytokines
  such as IFN-α, IFN-β can be generated, which facilitate elimination of the microbe.
  Nonetheless, the newly generated cardiac-reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells can persist
  and contribute to chronic inflammation. In these scenarios, however, presence of
  efficient Treg cells can dampen autoimmune responses, as they are highly critical
  for maintenance of self-tolerance.'
