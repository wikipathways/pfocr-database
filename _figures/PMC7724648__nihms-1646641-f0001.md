caption: The diverse range of cellular functions regulated by dynamic O-GlcNAcylation
  and a few examples of techniques for detecting and modulating this modification.
  O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) utilizes uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc),
  the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), to modify various
  proteins while O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes these modifications. OGT and OGA inhibitors
  have been developed to investigate their functional roles. Other chemical tools,
  such as metabolic labeling, have also been applied to study O-GlcNAc dynamics.
