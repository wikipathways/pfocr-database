caption: Initial engagements between cationic antimicrobial peptides and bacterial
  cells occur at the surface level. Cationic antimicrobial peptides are drawn to the
  anionic components present in the membranes of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
  bacteria through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. Figure 2
  highlights that both daf-2, a gene similar to the human insulin/IGF-1 receptor,
  and age-1, which is comparable to the human phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K),
  show features indicative of a longer lifespan. In the pathways illustrated in Figure
  2, the binding of an insulin-like molecule triggers the activation of DAF-2, which
  then phosphorylates itself and engages its downstream effector AGE-1 to facilitate
  the conversion of PIP2 into PIP3, while DAF-18 works against this process. The activation
  of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 occurs as a result of PIP3. As
  a result, the key downstream target DAF-16 undergoes phosphorylation, leading to
  its inactivation, which prevents its translocation into the nucleus and disrupts
  the transcriptional regulation of numerous effectors associated with stress resistance,
  longevity, and fat metabolism. The daf-16 mutation significantly mitigates the impacts
  caused by the daf-2 and age-1 mutations. The infection of C. elegans by bacteria
  triggers the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway (PMK-1), which subsequently promotes
  the release of antimicrobial peptides and initiates an innate immune response. The
  antimicrobial defense in C. elegans is regulated by conserved MAPK signaling pathways.
  Bacterial infections in the intestine activate the p38/PMK-1 signaling pathway through
  the kinases NSY-1 and SEK-1. Dashed lines illustrate the cascades mentioned in earlier
  research, whereas solid lines reflect the findings from the current investigation.  Upregulation;
