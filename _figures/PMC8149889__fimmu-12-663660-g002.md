caption: The functional dialogue between dNK cells and EVT cells at the maternal-fetal
  interface. HLA-G Cycle and Gal-9/Tim-3 signal inhibit/impair degranulation process
  and control the cytotoxicity of dNK Cells. Human dNK cells selectively transfer
  GNLY but not granzymes via nanotubes to EVT cells. Transferred GNLY kills intracellular
  bacteria without killing the EVT cells. Sialylated protein on the target cell promotes
  nanotube formation, while its receptor on dNK cells need further research. KIR/HLA
  allorecognition system (KIR2DS1-HLA-C2 and KIR2DL4-HLA-G) drives EVT cells invasion
  and uterine artery remodeling via synthesizing a series of soluble factors. HLA-G-LILRB1
  signal activates the PI3K-AKT pathway and drives the expression of transcription
  factor PBX1. Furthermore, PBX1 upregulates the transcription of the GPF including
  PTN and OGN and promotes fetal development.
