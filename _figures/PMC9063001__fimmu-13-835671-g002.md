caption: 'The IL-23/IL-17 axis in inflammation: Hypothetical mechanisms linking comorbid
  psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The shared molecular mechanisms, such as the IL-23/IL-17
  inflammatory pathway, may exist in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and atherosclerosis.
  Stimulated keratinocytes and vascular endothelial cells will transfer signals to
  inflammatory cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes and monocytes)
  in skin epidermis or endothelium to release transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and
  inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-21, IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-23). Thus, the inflammatory
  microenvironment emerges to stimulate the production of IL-17. IL-17 family includes
  6 subtypes (IL17A-F), and the expressions of IL-17A and IL-17F are significantly
  elevated in the disease process. There are several types of IL-17-derived cells
  (e.g., innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), γ δ T cells, naïve T cells, mast cells, and
  neutrophils) and the main source of IL-17 is the differentiation of naive T cells
  into Th17 cells. Naive T cells can also be differentiated into Th1 cells that promote
  the production of IFN- γ and TNF-α to assist the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis
  of the diseases. Th17 cells also highly express IL-23R for IL-23 binding, which
  sustains IL-17 production and increases Th17 cell proliferation and survival. Th17
  cell differentiation requires retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt that cooperates
  with other transcription factors, including ROR-α, signal transducers and transcriptional
  activators 3 (STAT3) for resultant IL-17 production, which could further aggravate
  the inflammation on the epidermis and show proatherogenic effects on vascular endothelium.
  Current evidence tends to support the view that IL-17 exerts mainly pro-inflammatory
  role in the comorbid psoriasis and atherosclerosis.'
