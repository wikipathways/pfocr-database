caption: The insulin signaling pathway illustrates the pivotal role of insulin in
  energy regulation, with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway playing a crucial
  role. (A) AKT's role in promoting glycogen and fat synthesis by inhibiting glycogen
  synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). (B) Direct regulation of glycolysis by AKT through
  stimulation of glucokinase. (C) Protein synthesis via the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway. (D) Inhibition of triglyceride production by suppressing forkhead
  box protein A2 (Foxa2). (E) Enhancement of glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells
  through the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) pathway and the translocation
  of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) to the cell membrane, also influenced by
  protein kinase C (PKC) activation
