caption: The proposed biosynthetic and maintenance pathways for the metallocofactors
  of the class Ia (a), Ib (b), and Ic (c) ribonucleotide reductases. The steps shown
  in blue highlight the requirement for the extra reducing equivalent, and in red,
  the maintenance pathway. In the case of class Ib, two possible routes to the putative
  MnIV MnIII intermediate are shown. In black is the mechanism originally proposed
  () in which NrdI acts as a source of HOO(H). In green is an alternative mechanism
  in which NrdI acts as a source of O2•−. In this mechanism, either NrdIhq or NrdIsq
  might serve as the one-electron reductant of O2; a distinction cannot be made between
  these possibilities at this time, and only the former is shown. Details of the proposed
  mechanisms are described in the text.
