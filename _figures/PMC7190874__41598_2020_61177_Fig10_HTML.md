caption: 'Liver analysis. (A) Protein-protein interaction network generated with STRING
  from DEGs in the Liver. The network comprises 937 nodes and connected with 2691
  edges (p-value of 1.0 e-16). For the rest of the details see Fig.  and also high
  resolution panel A in Supplementary information . (B) The graph shows t the results
  from the pathway enrichment analyses for the DEGs obtained from the liver. The bars
  depict the negative logarithm of the false discovery rate (FDR). (C) Genes with
  the highest degree of connectivity obtained from the PPI network with Cytoscape.
  D.I–IV) Top four modules obtained from the PPI network using Cytoscape’s plugin
  MCODE (Red nodes: Upregulated in hepta KO mice; Green nodes: Downregulated in heptaKO
  mice).'
