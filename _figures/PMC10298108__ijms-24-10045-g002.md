caption: PD-1 cell signaling pathway. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 results in the
  phosphorylation of ITIM and ITSM, subsequently leading to the recruitment of SHP2,
  which goes on to inhibit the PI3K/Akt and RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Altogether,
  this leads to the inhibition of proliferation and cytokine production and the induction
  of apoptosis [35,40]. In addition, SHP2 stimulates phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN), which dephosphorylates PI3K—inhibiting its activity [45]. Image designed
