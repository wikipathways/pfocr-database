caption: GSEA reveals dysregulation of actin signaling networks. (A) A gene set enrichment
  list of genes shared by the top 30 gene sets, ranked by their level of differential
  expression is shown to the left of the network. In the map of the gene sets to the
  right, nodes represent gene set clusters that result from the χ2-test for gene set
  enrichment () and edges represent the gene overlap between sets. Nodes are colored
  by χ2 values, node size indicates the number of genes in the set and edge thickness
  indicates number of genes shared between sets. (B) WS DEG (FDR < 0.2) pathway showing
  physical and predicted interaction network for the top-scoring GSEA gene set, ‘Actin
  cytoskeleton form and function at the synapse,’ GO term association (2 × 10−13,
  ‘actin cytoskeleton organization’). (C) WS DEG GSEA gene set (from B) shows unexpected
  match to the excitatory dendritic spine, capturing systems that regulate cytoskeleton
  in response to receptor excitation. Diagram is modified from Dillon and Goda (),
  updated to include recent evidence for microtubule co-regulation involving WS genes.
  Node labels identify WS DEGs. Node colors and density indicate WS DEG intensity
  by rank (FDR < 0.2) (blue = decreased, red = increased), or non-detected as a WS
  DEG (gray). WS region genes (LIMK1 and CLIP2) are shown with white text in blue
  shade. Note the growth ends of actin (barbed) and microtubules (plus) form a coregulatory
  bridge to the NMDAR, which includes WS DEG’s Drebrin 1 (DBN1, rank 20/12122) and
  cortactin (CTTN, rank 12), major cytoskeletal regulators in adult spines and axonal
  growth cones (,). The bridge complex represents experimentally established components
  that connect CLIP2 to the NMDAR through PAFAH1B1 () and independently through direct
  MT plus end binding of CLIP2 to EB3 (), through DIP2A (), DNB1 and CTTN, to SHANK-PSD95.
  ACTR3 is a major constituent of the actin branching complex ARP2/3 that is regulated
  by both CTTN (), and MAP1B () (binds both MT and actin), both of which were significantly
  over-expressed in WS (). The relationship of WS DEG’s to ASD risk genes () taken
  from the literature is noted (pink star), shows a striking synergism, complementarity
  and overlap, suggesting that WS, caused by a small gene set, may define the excitatory
  dendritic spine and its gene networks as a common brain substrate for the disturbed
  behavioral systems involved in approach or avoidant social behaviors seen in WS
  and ASD, where the large number of genes and networks has precluded identifying
  these. (D) Duplicate of (C) showing WS genes in pink and ASD in gray or both (half
  pink and half gray).
