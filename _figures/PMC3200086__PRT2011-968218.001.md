caption: Possible mechanisms of viral vector actions in gene therapy of chronic pain.
  Recombinant viral vectors encoding therapeutic genes infect target cells and express
  antinociceptive substances after subcutaneous inoculation or intrathecal administration.
  Gene products such as GAD and BDNF can lead to the release of GABA, which is an
  inhibitory neurotransmitter. IL-4 and IL-10 can suppress the expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines produced by activated glial cells and antagonize the signaling pathway
  activated by these cytokines. Endogenous opioid peptides have analgesic effects
  through opioid receptors. Nav1.7 antisense can prevent an increase in Nav1.7 expression
  and decrease inflammatory hyperalgesia.
