caption: 'Overview of the HIF pathway under normoxia and hypoxia.Under normal oxygen
  levels, HIF-α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), leading to its degradation
  via the von Hippel-Lindau protein-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. During hypoxia,
  PHD activity is inhibited, allowing HIF-α to accumulate, enter the nucleus, dimerize
  with HIF-1β, and activate target genes involved in adaptation to low oxygen. Abbreviations:
  HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha; HREs, hypoxia-responsive elements; ECF,
  extracellular fluid; ICF, intracellular fluid'
