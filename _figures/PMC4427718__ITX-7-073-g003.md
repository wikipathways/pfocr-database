caption: A biological network capturing the immune response and the metabolism of
  glycosaminoglycan and sphingolipid revealed from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® (IPA®).
  Molecules in the network represent the genes that were expressed in a different
  manner in tumor compared to surrounding non-tumorous parenchyma tissues following
  MS-300 exposure (significant interaction analysis). Blue and red indicate significantly
  decreased and increased fold change, respectively, of the gene expression affected
  by cigarette smoke in the tumors as compared to the parenchyma and sham controls.
  Color intensity qualitatively represents the degree of fold change. Straight and
  dashed lines specify direct and indirect interaction, respectively.
papertitle: Systems toxicology approaches enable mechanistic comparison of spontaneous
  and cigarette smoke-related lung tumor development in the A/J mouse model.
