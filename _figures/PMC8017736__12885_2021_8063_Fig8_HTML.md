caption: Mechanistic scheme depicting immune escape of CRC cells via MSC-EVs (Adobe
  Illustrator CS6, Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Secretion of MSC-EVs into CRC cells
  increased the expression of miR-222 in the cells. miR-222 targeted ATF3 to inhibit
  its activity, which led to the activation of ATF3-regulated AKT pathway and a subsequent
  increase in CRC cell malignant phenotype and immune escape
papertitle: Extracellular vesicles-derived microRNA-222 promotes immune escape via
  interacting with ATF3 to regulate AKT1 transcription in colorectal cancer.
