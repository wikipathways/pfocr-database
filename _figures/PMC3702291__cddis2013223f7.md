caption: Schematic model of signaling pathways in salinomycin-induced cell growth
  inhibition and apoptosis. Salinomycin exerts its antitumor effects by inhibition
  of oncogenic proteins such as Stat3, cyclin D1, and Skp2 but upregulates the tumor
  suppressor p27Kip1. Salinomycin inhibits Stat3 activation and thus decreases transcription
  of its target proteins, including cyclin D1 and survivin, which are important for
  cell cycle progression and cell survival. Salinomycin activates the APC/Cdh1–Skp2–p27Kip1
  pathway, leading to degradation of Skp2 and thus accumulation of the cell cycle
  inhibitor p27Kip1, which culminates in cell cycle arrest. Salinomycin also activates
  apoptosis signaling pathways including Akt inactivation and caspase-3 activation,
  which leads to cell death
papertitle: Salinomycin induces cell death via inactivation of Stat3 and downregulation
  of Skp2.
