caption: 'Model of canonical inflammasome activation involving regulation of autophagy
  induced by Ehrlichia. The canonical iflammasome activation pathway proposed in Ehrlichia
  infection involves two steps. In the first step, Ehrlichia invade the target cell
  and induce TLR9/MyD88 downstream targets to activate NF-κB. Activated NF-κB function
  as a transcription factor to upregulate NRLP3 complexes, pro-IL1β and pro-IL-18.
  In the second step, NRLP3 inflammasomes would be activated after recognition of
  Ehrlichial PAMPS which are secreted to the cytosol via type I and IV secretion systems.
  Accumulation of mtDAMPS originated by inhibition of autophagy via MyD88/mTORC1 signaling
  would also induce inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation results in activation
  of caspase-1 that subsequently induces cleavage of pro-IL1β and pro-IL-18 into their
  mature forms. Mature IL-1β and IL-18 are then secreted to the extracellular space
  to contribute to the establishment of a pro-inflammatory environment. Direct arrow:
  positive regulation; blocking arrow: negative regulation; question mark (?) means
  hypothetical, and not experimentally proven.'
