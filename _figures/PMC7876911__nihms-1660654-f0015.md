caption: A combination of STFs with MTF drives optimal gene expression-regulation
  by the TSC. The normal signal-induced expression of a red blood cell gene is perturbed
  due to a SNP that either eliminates an existing STF binding event or creates a new
  STF binding site in a critical signaling center. This can lead to a lack of response
  to an episodic signaling pathway, initiated by an exogenous stressor, and eventually
  lead to phenotypic variability.
