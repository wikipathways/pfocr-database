caption: Three pathways for the specific incorporation of selenium into biological
  macromolecules. Selenophosphate is required for synthesis of selenocysteine (SeCys)-containing
  selenoproteins via cotranslational insertion of SeCys via selC tRNA that is first
  charged with serine. A specific elongation factor (SelB) interacts with the selenocysteine
  insertion sequence mRNA element located 3′ to the UGA codon (encoding the 21st amino
  acid, SeCys). This pathway was best defined in E. coli using the FDHH enzyme as
  the model (, , ). Selenophosphate is also required as a metabolic precursor for
  modification of uridine residues in several tRNAs (not SeCys tRNAs) to form 2-selenouridine.
  Both selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) and YbbB proteins have been shown to be required
  for this production of the selenouridine residue (). In the third pathway, the incorporation
  of selenium into SDMHs in a labile form is not understood, and the dependence of
  this pathway on selenophosphate has not yet been established, although this labile
  form of selenium has been shown to occur in several molybdoenzymes isolated from
  clostridial species (, , , -, , ). It has been proposed that this pathway exists
  in E. faecalis, based on two computational studies (, ), and that the first and
  second pathways are absent.
