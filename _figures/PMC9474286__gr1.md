caption: 'Synthesis pathway of monolignol and lignan metabolites from phenylalanine/tyrosine
  to pluviatolide. Pathway sections highlighted in color were studied in vivo. The
  yellow section is included in E. coli strains type I, which produce coniferyl alcohol
  from tyrosine. E. coli strains type II express the genes necessary for the pathway
  section highlighted in blue, resulting in the production of secoisolariciresinol
  from coniferyl alcohol. PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; TAL: tyrosine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H: cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4HPA3H: 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase; COMT:
  caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT: caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; 4CL:
  4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR: cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD: cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase;
  –[H]: one-electron oxidation, for instance, catalyzed by laccase from Corynebacterium
  glutamicum (CgL1) or copper efflux oxidase (CueO); PLR: pinoresinol-lariciresinol
