caption: Schematic summarizing the concept of the lysosome as a central element in
  the greater lysosomal system of neurons with links to the endocytic streams from
  somadendritic and axonal domains, and to the macroautophagy stream and its close
  allies, the ubiquitin-proteosomal system (UPS) and chaperone-mediated autophagy
  (CMA) components. What flows into this system must also leave in some form, depicted
  here as the salvage pathway with delivery to the Golgi/TGN, mitochondria, and other
  sites in the cell. The complexity of the disease cascades in lysosomal disorders
  is conjectured to emanate in part from disruption of these interrelated components
  of the greater lysosomal system, as described in the text. (EE, early endosome;
  RE, recycling endosome; LE, late endosome; LY, lysosome; SE, signaling endosome;
  AV, autophagic vacuole; ER, endoplasmic reticulum).
