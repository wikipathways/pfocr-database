caption: 'A: Schematic diagram of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and known enzymes
  (red font) and B: their corresponding differentially expressed genes in the present
  study in Coffea arabica (the heatmap gives log2fold change between the yellow (YF)
  colored fruits relative to purple (PF), red (RF) and orange (ORF) colored fruits.
  Expression with positive values in the legend of the heatmap at the right side of
  the figure means lower expression in YF while negative values means higher expression
  relative to either PF, RF or ORF (See heatmap key in B). GGPP: geranyl–geranyl diphosphate;
  PSY: phytoene synthase; LYCE: lycopene epsilon-cyclase [EC:5.5.1.18]; CHXB/E: beta-ring
  hydroxylase [EC:1.14.15.24] (or LUT5); BCIS: beta-carotene isomerase, CCD7 and CCD8:
  carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 7 and 8, respectively [EC:1.13.11.68–69]; ZEP:
  zeaxanthin epoxidase [EC:1.14.15.21]; VDE: violaxanthin de-epoxidase [EC:1.23.5.1];
  BCIS: beta-carotene isomerase [EC:5.2.1.14]; AAO3: abscisic-aldehyde oxidase [EC:1.2.3.14];
  ABA2: xanthoxin dehydrogenase [EC:1.1.1.288]; NCED: 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase
  [EC:1.13.11.51]; CYP7070A: (+)-abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase [EC:1.14.14.137]; and
