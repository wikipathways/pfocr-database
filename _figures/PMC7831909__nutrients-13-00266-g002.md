caption: Sulforaphane targets Nrf2 pathway to prevent kidney disease progression.
  Glucoraphanin in cruciferous vegetables is hydrolyzed to sulforaphane by the enzyme
  myrosinase or by the gut microbiome. Sulforaphane inhibits the KEAP-1-mediated degradation
  of Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to migrate from the cell cytoplasm into the nucleus where
  it binds to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the promoter regions of
  Nrf2 target genes, thereby increasing their transcription, and hence their activities.
  The result is a decrease in ROS and factors involved in inflammation and fibrosis.
