caption: Schematic overview of a potential I1 and adenosine receptors crosstalk. Reference
  is made to the signaling cascades of the adenosine A1 and A2A receptor subtypes.
  Adenosine A2A receptor activation with the nonselective agonist adenosine or the
  more selective agonist CGS21680 leads to enhanced expression of pERK1/2 via a cAMP-dependent
  or independent mechanism. I1 activation with its respective agonist, clonidine or
  rilmenidine, enhances expression of pERK1/2 via a PC-PLC pathway. pERK1/2 activates
  neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which causes increased production of NO and
  decreased sympathetic neuronal activity.
