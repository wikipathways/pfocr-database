caption: The principal feature of exhaustion (left) is upregulation of inhibitory
  receptors such as PD-1. Engagement of PD-1 to its ligand (PD-L1) results in the
  inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell
  proliferation such as PI3K/AKT pathway. Inactivation of AKT (due to the lack of
  site-specific phosphorylation mediated by PI3K, mTORC (on Serine473), and PDK1 (on
  Threonine308)) in turn lifts the block on FOXO transcription factors and thereby
  activates p27, a repressor of cell cycle (G1-S transition). Senescence (right) can
  be induced by either AKT inhibitory receptors (e.g., KLRG-1) or DNA damage response
  mediators including ATM and ATR. KLRG-1 prevents AKT phosphorylation (on Serine473)
  removing its block on p27, and thereby results in cell cycle arrest. The DNA damage
  response components activate p53, p21, p38, and p16 which inhibit cell cycle progression
  by blocking the function of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The figure
  adapted from [].
