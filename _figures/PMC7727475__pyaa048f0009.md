caption: The possible mechanisms whereby roflumilast reverses AD-related memory loss
  and depression. Roflumilast not only improves learning and memory but also attenuates
  depression-like behavior in AD mice, most likely via the PDE4-mediated cAMP/CREB/BDNF
  signaling pathway, in which Bcl-2/Bax may also be involved. More specifically, roflumilast
  inhibits PDE4, in particular PDE4B and PDE4D, leading to accumulation of cAMP and
  subsequent increases in pCREB, BDNF, and Bcl2/Bax in the brain. Therefore, roflumilast
  can be a therapeutic agent for AD, in particular the comorbidity of memory deficits
  and depression.
