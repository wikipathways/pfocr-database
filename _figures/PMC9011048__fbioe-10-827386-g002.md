caption: Overview of natural and engineered metabolic pathways for the production
  of mixed acids (succinate, acetate and lactate) from diverse carbon substrates (xylose,
  arabinose, glucose, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid)
  in C. glutamicum. Assimilation of xylose to be facilitated by XylA (xylose isomerase)
  and XylB (xylulose kinase) denoted by pink in the figure and assimilation of arabinose
  facilitated by AraA (arabinose isomerase), AraB (ribolokinase) and AraD (ribulose
  5-phosphate 4-epimerase) denoted by purple. Abbreviations in arabinose and xylose
  assimilation Rib5P (ribulose 5-phosphate), Xyl5P (D-xylulose 5-phosphate), G6P (glucose
  6-phosphate), F6P (fructose 6-phosphate), 3PG (3-phosphoglycerate). Succinate is
  synthesized through the reductive branch of TCA cycle from pyruvate or PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate)
  under anaerobic conditions (; ). Acetate is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and L-lactate
  is synthesized via pyruvate. Aromatic catabolic pathway represented by red arrows.
  Anaplerotic pathways denoted by dotted lines.
