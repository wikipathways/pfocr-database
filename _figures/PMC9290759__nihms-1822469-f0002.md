caption: 'Different mechanisms of Treg induction by probiotics to reduce inflammation.
  (1) Probiotics metabolize the dietary fibers such as resistant starch, inulin, FOS,
  β-GOS to release SCFAs: acetate, butyrate and propionate. These SCFAs activate the
  GPR43 and GPR109A: on intestinal epithelial cells to inhibit the NF-κB pathway to
  reduce inflammation; on DCs to generate tDCs producing TGFβ, IL-10, and RA; and
  on Treg cells. This interaction of SCFAs and GPCRs results into induction and expansion
  of Tregs capable of suppressing the inflammatory state. GPR43 is activated by all
  three SCFAs; however, GPR109A is activated only by butyrate. SCFA induction also
  involves inhibition of HDACs which in turn increases the production and suppressive
  function of FoxP3+Tregs by promoting the acetylation of Foxp3 protein. In addition,
  SCFAs modulate the production of PGE2 and COX2 (butyrate in particular), promoting
  expansion of pre-existing Tregs. (2) Microbial tryptophan metabolites including
  IAA, IAId, IA, and ILA interact with the AHR on DCs to generate tDCs and AHR on
  T cells to promote Treg function and/or produce anti-inflammatory IL-22. (3) Probiotic
  Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938-mediated production of adenosine and its metabolite
  inosine, by serving as an A2A agonist, inhibits TH1/TH2/TH17 cells and promotes
  Treg-mediated immunoregulation. (4) Probiotics interact with TLR2 expressed on intestinal
  epithelial cells and immune cells to induce tDCs and subsequently to induce Tregs
