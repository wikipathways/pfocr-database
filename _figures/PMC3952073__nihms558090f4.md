caption: (1) In young hepatocyte specific TAK1-deficient (TAK1ΔHep) mice, NF-κB activation
  is inhibited, while TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 activation is enhanced, which promotes
  hepatocyte death and compensatory proliferation. (2) During hepatocytes transform
  into malignant cells, the TGF-β-Smad pathway changes its property, which leads to
  the upregulation of pro-carcinogenic, pro-angiogenic, pro-fibrotic, and anti-apoptotic
  molecules that maintain tumor cell survival and growth.
