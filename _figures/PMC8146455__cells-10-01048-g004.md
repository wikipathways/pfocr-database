caption: A hypothesized role of CCN4 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Both immune
  cells and so-called hepatic stellate cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of
  liver fibrosis. Upon metabolic disturbances, infiltrated T-cells, macrophages, and
  other immune cell types, as well as the liver-resident macrophages, induce the activation
  of HSC, their proliferation, and ECM deposition. CCN4 might accelerate both HSC
  activation and liver inflammation contributing in this way to the aggravation of
  liver fibrosis.
