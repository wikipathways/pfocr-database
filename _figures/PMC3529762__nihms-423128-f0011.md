caption: Illustration of GnRH signaling pathways necessary for FSHβ induction. c-Fos
  is rapidly induced by GnRH through activation of ERK1/2, which is dependent on PKC,
  and its phosphorylation of transcription factor ELK1, which is similar to c-Fos
  activation by growth factors. c-Fos induction however, also requires SRF phosphorylation
  by CamKII that allows prebound SRF to interact with ELK1 and activate transcription,
  which represents specificity of GnRH signaling pathway. GnRH induction of c-Jun
  occurs by activation of p38, through yet unknown mechanisms, and phosphorylation
  of prebound ATF2, which interacts with basal factor NFY. Once induced, c-Fos and
  c-Jun heterodimerize to form AP1, bind FSHβ promoter and interact with NFY to induce
  FSHβ transcription.

  description: Illustration of GnRH signaling pathways necessary for FSHβ induction.
    c-Fos is rapidly induced by GnRH through activation of ERK1/2, which is dependent
    on PKC, and its phosphorylation of transcription factor ELK1, which is similar
    to c-Fos activation by growth factors. c-Fos induction however, also requires
    SRF phosphorylation by CamKII that allows prebound SRF to interact with ELK1 and
    activate transcription, which represents specificity of GnRH signaling pathway.
    GnRH induction of c-Jun occurs by activation of p38, through yet unknown mechanisms,
    and phosphorylation of prebound ATF2, which interacts with basal factor NFY. Once
    induced, c-Fos and c-Jun heterodimerize to form AP1, bind FSHβ promoter and interact
    with NFY to induce FSHβ transcription.
