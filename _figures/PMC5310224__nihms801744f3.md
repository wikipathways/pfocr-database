caption: a | Upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation, the inositol-requiring enzyme
  1α (IRE1α) arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated through a mechanism
  that requires TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) recruitment to the TLR and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase NOX2. Spliced X-box
  binding protein 1 (XBP1s) functions as a transcription factor for the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines interleukin-6 (Il6) and tumour necrosis factor (Tnf). In a separate pathway,
  translation of activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) mRNA is inhibited by TLR4
  ligation, which decreases C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) levels and apoptosis in
  activated macrophages. This favours macrophage survival and as such facilitates
  the immune response. b | In the absence of TLR signalling, phosphorylated IRE1α
  is subject to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation
  (left panel). Upon TLR ligation, however, TRAF6 interacts with and catalyses the
  ubiquitylation of IRE1α, which prevents PP2A–mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation
  of IRE1α, thereby amplifying inflammation (right panel). c | Endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress-induced activation of IRE1α can induce Il1b transcription through glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which simultaneously inhibits Xbp1 splicing and thereby
  the transcription of XBP1s target genes, including Tnf.
