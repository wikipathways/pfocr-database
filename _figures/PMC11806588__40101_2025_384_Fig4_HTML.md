caption: Summary of the potential pathways and mechanisms of genes associated with
  skin cancer-related phenotypes. (i) BNC2 induces G0/G1 phase arrest, preventing
  uncontrolled cell division and thereby reducing skin cancer risk; (ii) CLPTM1L is
  in high linkage disequilibrium with TERT, a gene essential for telomere synthesis
  and linked to increased skin cancer susceptibility; (iii) LPP promotes angiogenesis
  and tumourigenesis through activation of the Ras signalling pathway
