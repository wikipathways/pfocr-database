caption: Simplified depiction of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signal transduction pathway. Binding
  of a ligand to a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Dimerization of receptor
  subunits leads to phosphorylation of cytoplasmic domains, leading to receuitment
  of adaptor proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors in turn leading to activation
  of RAS GTPase proteins, which activate RAF kinases (e.g. BRAF), in turn phosphorylating
  and activating MEK family kinases. MEK proteins can then phosphorylate ERK proteins,
  leading to ERK activation and translocation to the nucleus, where ERK serves to
  activate transcription factors, including c-myc, and regulate gene expression governing
  cell cycle entry and proliferation. PI3K is able to be activated directly via receptor
  tyrosine kinases following ligand binding and may additionally be activated by RAS
  proteins. Several commercially available and investigational inhibitors of BRAF,
  MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 are depicted as well.
