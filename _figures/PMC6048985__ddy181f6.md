caption: Metabolic reprogramming in BHD-associated kidney cancer. (A) Metabolites
  in gycolytic pathway. (B) A scheme of the increased transportation of fatty acids
  into mitochondria. (C) Metabolites in TCA cycle. Blue or red square box represents
  data of adjacent normal kidney (normal) or BHD-associated kidney cancer (tumor),
  respectively. Y-axis represents arbitrary unit of signal intensity detected in LC/MS
  spectrometry. Upper or lower edge of square box indicates upper or lower quartile,
  respectively. Upper or lower whisker indicates maximum or minimum of distribution,
  respectively. Plus indicates mean value. Line inside square box indicates median
  value. White dot indicates extreme data points. Welch’s two sample t-test was applied
  to determine whether the means of two populations are different.
