caption: ABA metabolism pathway. Zeaxanthin conversion into violaxanthin is catalyzed
  by zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). ABA4 is involved in the synthesis of neoxanthin,
  which is then cis-isomerized, together with violaxanthin, by an unknown isomerase.
  Carotenoid cleavage is catalyzed by a family of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases
  (NCED) to form xanthoxin. Xanthoxin moves to the cytosol by an unknown mechanism
  and is converted into abscisic aldehyde by a short-chain dehydrogenase reductase
  (SDR1), which is then oxidized into ABA by an abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO3).
  Sulfuration of AAO3 molybdenum co-factor by ABA3 is necessary for enzyme activity.
  The 8′-hydroxylation by CYP707A enzymes is thought to be the predominant pathway
  for ABA catabolism. Hydroxy-groups of ABA and its catabolites, phaseic acid (PA),
  neoPA, and dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) are targets for conjugation. ABA-glucose ester
  is formed by ABA glucosyltransferases (UGT) and hydrolyzed by glucosidases, including
  BG1 and BG2.
