caption: A model for DNA-RNA hybrids and their consequences for replication throughout
  the cell cycle.Spontaneous DNA-RNA hybridization might be favored by different conditions
  at any moment of the cell cycle, including insufficient RNA coating, negative supercoiling
  and DNA breaks or ssDNA gaps. This is counteracted by the action of multiple mechanisms
  including DNA-RNA helicases. The ssDNA displaced by the DNA-RNA hybrid entails a
  major susceptibility to DNA damaging agents. Moreover, DNA-RNA hybrids can be processed
  by nucleases leading to breakage all over the cell cycle. Upon encountering by the
  replication forks, DNA-RNA hybrids could be tolerated by directly re-priming downstream
  of the lesion, leading to DNA-RNA hybrids at un-replicated regions in S phase. Alternatively,
  DNA-RNA hybrids, as well as other types of lesions, can induce fork stalling and
  eventually fork collapse in S phase. This would be prevented by the ATR/CHK1 DDC
  pathway. Stalled forks may trigger the formation of postreplicative ssDNA gaps,
  which are a substrate for spontaneous RNA hybridization. In the absence of PRR,
  the extensive accumulation of ssDNA gaps would obstacle further processing, possibly
  delaying the full completion of DNA synthesis and prompting mitotic failures.
