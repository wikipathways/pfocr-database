caption: 'Metabolic analysis of metabolites in the glycolytic pathway and the Krebs
  cycle in WT and kcn11 cells that were grown in N-depleted media for 2 days, respectively.
  G3P and acetyl-CoA were also assayed in kcn11 cells supplemented with 40 mM sucrose.
  G6P: Glucose-6-phosphate; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; F16BP: fructose-1,6-diphosphate;
  GA3P: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 3-PGA: 3-Phosphoglyceric acid; DHAP: Dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvic acid; G3P: glycerol phosphate; LysoPA: lysophosphatide;
  PA: phosphatidic acid; DAG: diacylglycerol; TAG: triacylglycerol; AKG: Alpha-ketoglutarate'
