caption: Illustrative representation of crosstalk among Ca2+signaling components under
  temperature stressed condition. Upon sensing heat stress, plants respond through
  increased expression of several HSPs and other proteins like DREB, etc., along with
  activation of the GAD-GABA pathway. During cold stress, freezing tolerance is achieved
  through upregulated expression COR, ICE1, etc. CRLK, calcium/calmodulin-regulated
  receptor-like kinase 1; ICE1, inducer of CBF expression 1; CRT/DRE-C, repeat/dehydration-responsive
  element; SR, serine/arginine-rich; HSPs, heat shock protein; GAD, L-glutamate decarboxylase;
  GABA, γ-amino butyrate.
