caption: Schematic figure illustrating that Pae alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy
  by promoting Opa1-mediated mitochondrial fusion via activating the CK2α-Jak2-Stat3
  pathway. Pae binds to diabetes-inactivated CK2α and restores its activity that subsequently
  interacts with Jak2 and induces the phosphorylation and activation of the Jak2-Stat3
  signaling. Activated Stat3 binds to the Opa1 promoter to promote Opa1-mediated mitochondrial
  fusion. Afterward, Pae-induced upregulation of Opa1 promotes mitochondrial fusion,
  inhibits mitochondria-derived oxidative stress, preserves mitochondrial function
  and protects against diabetic cardiomyopathy. Pae, paeonol; Mito, mitochondrial;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; DCM, diabetic cardiomyopathy.
