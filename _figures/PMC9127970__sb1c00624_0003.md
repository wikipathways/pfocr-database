caption: The designed biosynthetic pathway converts acetate into EG in six steps.
  The KEGG reaction number (R0XXXX) is listed for each step when available. The enzymes
  (in purple and italics) and the genes (in blue and italics) required for the steps
  are also shown for each step. The genes CLAU_1850 and CLAU_2675 are from C. autoethanogenum,
  while the genes citD/E/F, acnB, aceA, ghrA, aldA, and fucO are from E. coli.
