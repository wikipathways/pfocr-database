caption: 'C. elegans cellular pathways and their crosstalk, relating to aging and
  the stress response. Shown (from left to right) are the insulin/insulin-like growth
  factor (IIS) signaling pathway, the mitochondrial signaling pathways, and the mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Arrows indicate positive regulatory events and
  bars indicate inhibitory interactions. Purple block arrows represent interactions
  between the different pathways, whereas dashed purple block arrows indicate possible
  indirect interactions. The oval molecules and their corresponding mammalian homologs
  involved in IIS [, , , ] are as below: AGE-1/PI3K, phospatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  PDK-1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ortholog; SGK-1, a serine/threonine
  protein kinase that is orthologous to the mammalian serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible
  kinases (SGKs); Akt/PKB, the serine/threonine kinase; DAF-16/FOXO, forkhead box
  O (FOXO) transcription factor. Mitochondrial dysfunctions [90–96] are associated
  with apoptotic/programmed cell death (PCD), aberrant autophagic regulation, endoplasmic
  reticulum dysfunction, and intracellular calcium, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) subgroup of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases; CED-4, CED-9, and EGL-1
  belong to a conserved genetic pathway to regulate apoptosis during C. elegans development
  []; PINK-1, a predicted serine/threonine kinase which is similar with human PINK1,
  PTEN-induced kinase-1; SKN-1/Nrf, skin in excess transcription factor 1/NF-E2-related
  factor; mtROS, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; ATP, adenosine-5′-triphosphate;
  HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1. Major molecules in TOR pathways
  include TSC1/2, tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 and 2; RHEB, Ras homolog enriched
  in brain; TOR, target of rapamycin kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase ortholog.
