caption: (See previous page). Mechanisms of non-homologous end joining. (A). Canonical
  NHEJ (C-NHEJ). C-NHEJ is initiated by binding of the Ku80-Ku70 heterodimer to the
  DSB, which recruits the DNA-PK catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. Several proteins, including
  Artemis, the polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and members of the polymerase X family,
  process the DNA ends to make them competent for the subsequent ligation steps. Finally,
  ligase IV, in association with Xrcc4 and Cernunos/Xlf, seals the double-strand ends.
  (B) Alternative end-joining (A-EJ). In the absence of Ku70/Ku80, the DNA ends are
  resected in a reaction favored by the nuclease activity of Mre11 and CtIP. Note
  that Parp1 is involved in A-EJ initiation. The resulting ssDNA reveals complementary
  microhomologies (2–4 nt or more) that can be annealed; gap filling completes the
  end joining. Finally, Xrcc1 and ligase III complete the A-EJ process. Notably, A-EJ
  is always associated with deletions at the junctions and frequently, but not systematically,
  involves microhomologies that are distant from the DSB. (C) The 2-step DSB repair
  pathway choice model. After signaling of the DSB by ATM and MRN, (I) binding of
  Ku80/Ku70 protects the DSB ends from resection, routing DSB repair toward the conservative
  C-NHEJ pathway. (II) The nuclease activity of Mre11 and CtIP favor ssDNA resection,
  which can then initiate the HR or A-EJ pathway. A short ssDNA resection is sufficient
  for A-EJ but not for HR. A-EJ is an exclusively non-conservative mutagenic process.
