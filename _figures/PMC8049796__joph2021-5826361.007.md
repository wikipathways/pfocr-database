caption: The β2 adrenergic receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor. Activation of
  the receptor by adrenaline leads to peripheral vasodilation through the Gs signal
  pathway. Activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to conversion of ATP to cAMP, which
  activates phosphor kinase A (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to deactivation of myosin
  light chain kinase (MLCK), which, when activated, leads to contraction. Thus, activation
  of PKA leads to vasodilation (©EyeTRU).
