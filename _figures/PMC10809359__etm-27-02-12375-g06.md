caption: PPI network of the signalling molecules regulating macrophage activity and
  HIF-1 signalling pathways. The PPI network was analysed with The Search Tool for
  the Retrieval of Interacting Genes website. The 12 nodes on the left represent the
  signalling molecules regulating the macrophage activity signalling pathways, and
  the eight nodes on the right represent the eight signalling molecules in the HIF-1
  signalling pathways; the line between two nodes indicates that there was a PPI between
  the two molecules. PPI, protein-protein interaction; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor
