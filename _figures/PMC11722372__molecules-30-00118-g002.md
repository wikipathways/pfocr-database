caption: 'Schematic of the putative biosynthetic pathway of DAs in Aconitum plants.
  The precursors for DA biosynthesis are generated from the Methylerythritol (MEP)
  and Mevalonate (MVA) pathways. The specific genes within the red-marked enzyme families
  have been identified, while those marked in gray remain undiscovered, and the enzyme
  genes marked in blue are predicted from transcriptome sequencing but have not been
  experimentally validated. DA skeleton rearrangement: cyclases and CYP450; skeleton
  decoration: CYP450, OMT, and BAHD acyltransferases. Abbreviations: AACT (acetoacetyl-CoA
  thiolase), HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), HMGS (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase), MVK (mevalonate kinase), PMK (phosphomevalonate kinase), MVD (mevalonate
  diphosphate decarboxylase), DXS (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase), DXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase), MCT (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase),
  CMK (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase), MDS (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase), HDS ((E) -4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate
  synthase )IPPI (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase), GGPPS (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
