caption: KIT signaling pathways. KIT signaling occurs through several pathways. Phosphorylation
  of the juxta-membrane Tyr residues recruits Src family kinases (SFKs), in particular
  Lyn, initiating PI3K signaling and the phosphorylation of other signaling and adaptor
  proteins. These events most likely occur within lipid rafts where the PI3K substrate,
  PI(4,5)P2, is converted to PI(3,4,5)P3, a signaling lipid that contributes to the
  activation of other enzymes. Adaptor proteins (NTAL and Grb2) are phosphorylated
  by the receptor or by Src kinases and recruit other signaling proteins, forming
  signaling complexes. PLCγ1, for example is recruited by the adaptor protein NTAL
  to lipid rafts, activated by phosphorylation and by PI(3,4,5)P3, cleaving PI(3,4)P2
  to form IP3, which induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores; and DAG,
  together with Ca2+ activates PKC. Tyr residues within the kinase insert domain of
  KIT interact with PI3K and Grb2, leading to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway.
  Another pathway critical for KIT mediated proliferation, particularly in gain-of-function
  KIT mutants, is the activation of the transcription factors STAT1/3/5 (signal transducers
  and activators of transcription). Janus kinase (JAK) is phosphorylated after KIT
  activation, and in turn phosphorylates STAT allowing its translocation to the nucleus,
  where it exerts its function. Inhibitory pathways of KIT also regulate responsiveness
  to SCF. The juxtamembrane Tyr residues of KIT can recruit the phosphatases, SHP1,
  SHP2 and SHIP1, which may contribute to negative regulation of KIT signaling. In
  addition, recruitment of the ubiquitin E3 ligase, c-Cbl, via the dimeric adaptor
  protein APS, may be a critical determinant for ubiquitination and degradation of
  KIT. Both Tyr 936 and Tyr 570 appear to regulate the recruitment of c-Cbl and binding
  of APS. APS exists as a dimer and thus may require two simultaneously phosphorylated
  KIT residues to recruit c-Cbl. For simplification, only one extracellular domain
  of KIT is represented and bound ligand is not depicted.
