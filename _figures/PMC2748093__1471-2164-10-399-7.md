caption: Partial representation of the metabolic pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis
  (Kegg map 00900). TCs more expressed at 45 DAF are boxed green, while those more
  expressed at 135 DAF are boxed purple. In black boxes are those TCs expressed at
  all fruit ripening stages and in both genotypes. Genotype-specific TCs more expressed
  at 45 DAF, more expressed at 135 DAF and with unchanged expression are included
  in green, purple and black circles, respectively, and reported with C (Coratina)
  and T (Tendellone) when they are exclusively present in one of the two cultivars.
