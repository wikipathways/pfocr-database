caption: Current understanding of LPA/LPA5R stimulation of NHE3 activity and mobility
  based on current studies and the previous reports from the laboratory of Yun and
  colleagues (, ). Please note that NHERF2 is involved in the pathway in at least
  three steps, anchoring the LPA5R (), binding PLC (), and binding and releasing NHE3;?
  identify steps at which detailed understanding remain to be identified. BB, brush
  border; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol.
