caption: Working model for the acute hypotensive effect of short-chain fatty acid
  (SCFA) delivery on blood pressure (BP, blood pressure; WT, wild type; KO, knockout).
  Gpr41 acts to decrease blood pressure in response to SCFA, whereas Olfr78 acts in
  opposition to increase blood pressure. In WT animals, the hypotensive response of
  Gpr41 prevails. When Olfr78 is genetically deleted, the hypotensive response is
  further accentuated as the “brake” on the pathway has been removed. However, when
  Gpr41 is genetically deleted, the hypotensive response is absent, and instead a
  slight hypertensive response (presumably mediated by Olfr78) remains.
