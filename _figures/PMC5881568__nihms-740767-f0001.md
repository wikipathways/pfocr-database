caption: 'AMP binding activates AMPK by three effects, i.e. promotion of Thr172 phosphorylation
  by LKB1 (effect #1), inhibition of Thr172 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases
  (PP) (effect #2), and allosteric activation (effect #3). All three effects are opposed
  by binding of ATP, while binding of ADP mimics effect #2 and #1, but not #3. CaMKKβ
  phosphorylates the same site as LKB1 (Thr172) in response to increases in cellular
  Ca2+.'
