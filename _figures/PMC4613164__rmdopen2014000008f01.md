caption: 'Simplified overview of the HCV life cycle and sites of direct acting antiviral
  therapies. HCV binds to one of several putative cell surface receptors and is internalised.
  Once inside the hepatocyte, the HCV genome is translated to produce a single large
  protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed
  by proteases of viral and host origin to produce three structural and NS proteins.
  The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex that
  is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places
  via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand
  RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production
  of new positive strand viral genomes. The NS5A protein is part of the cytoplasmic
  replication complex but has no enzymatic activity and although its function remains
  unclear it is critical to the viral lifecycle. New virus particles are thought to
  bud into the secretory pathway and are released at the cell surface. Inset: Proteins
  encoded by the HCV genome. The genome carries a long ORF encoding a polyprotein
  of 3010 amino acids. Translation of the ORF is directed via flankin NTR regions,
  which serve as robosomal entry sites. The HCV polyprotein is cleaved by viral-derived
  and host-derived proteases into structural and NS proteins. The putative functions
  of the cleavage products are shown. DAA, direct-acting antiviral; IFN, interferon;
  HCV, hepatitis C virus; NS, non-structural; ORF, open reading frame; NTR, non-translated.'
