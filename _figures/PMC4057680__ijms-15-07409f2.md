caption: Schematic illustration of LDH-FITC nanoparticle intracellular fate. (A) TEM
  image of LDH-FITC nanoparticles; (B) CHO cells transfected with LDH-FITC nanoparticles;
  (C) Pumping protons into the endosome to facilitate acidification for subsequent
  proteolysis of nutrients, followed by an influx of chloride ions; (D) Acid-driven
  dissolution of LDH-FITC nanoparticles in the late endosome to buffer acidification
  and ions were released; (E) Entrance of water molecules to the endosome due to an
  increase in ionic strength, leading to osmotic swelling and endosome burst, which
  releases LDH-FITC nanoparticles into the cytoplasm. Step I. Adhesion of LDH-FITC
  nanoparticles to the cell membrane; II. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis; III. Endosomal
  changes; IV. Nuclear localization of LDH-FITC; V. Cytoplasmic distribution of LDH-FITC;
  VI. Lysosomal pathway; VII. Unspecific uptake through macropinocytosis; VIII–IX.
  Caveolae-mediated endocytosis; X. Microtubule directing thefreed LDH-FITC nanoparticles
