caption: Main pathways involved in the pathophysiology of HHT. Members of the TGF-β
  family (mainly BMP9 and 10), bind to specific cell surface type I (R-I) and type
  II (R-II) receptors. These receptors exhibit serine/threonine kinase activity. The
  main R-I receptors involved in this pathway are ALK-1 and ALK-5. On the other hand,
  R-II receptors include TβRII, ActRII, BMPRII. Endoglin is an auxiliary receptor
  that associates with the ligand, ALK-1/R-II complex, potentiating its action. A
  soluble form of endoglin (sol-eng) can be generated by proteolysis of the membrane-bound
  receptor that can sequester ligands (BMP9 or 10) and thus modulate their binding
  to R-I/R-II receptors. The association between R-I (either ALK-1 or ALK-5) with
  R-II determines the specificity of ligand signaling. Upon ligand binding, R-II transphosphorylates
  R-I, which then propagates the signal by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated
  Smad family of proteins. Once phosphorylated, R-Smads form heteromeric complexes
  with a cooperating homologue called Co-Smad (Smad4) and translocate to the nucleus
  where they regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes. In endothelial
  cells, ALK1 and ALK5 activate signaling two different pathways via Smad1, 5, 8 (ALK1)
  or Smad2, 3 (ALK5), respectively. The first one promotes transcription of genes
  related to angiogenesis. The second promotes transcription of genes related to repairing
  phase. Endoglin, ALK1, Smad4, and BMP9 proteins are encoded by ENG, ACVRL1, MADH4,
  and GDF2 genes respectively. ActR, activin receptor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein;
  BMPR, BMP receptor [,,].
