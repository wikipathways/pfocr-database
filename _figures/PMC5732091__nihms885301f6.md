caption: 'In the canonical pathway, when the Frizzled receptor is not activated, the
  destruction complex (Apc and Axin) binds β-catenin inducing its phosphorylation
  as mediated by GSK-3β and CKI, which results in β-catenin degradation. When the
  Frizzled receptor is activated, the destruction complex is inactivated resulting
  in the stabilization of β-catenin that translocates to the nucleus and induces target
  gene expression in coordination with TCF/LEF. In the non-canonical pathway, the
  activation of Frizzled receptors lead to activation of the small GTPases Rho and
  Rac. Inversin, localized in the basal body, functions as a switch between both pathways.
