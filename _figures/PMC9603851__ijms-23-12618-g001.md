caption: The TLR4 pathway. TLR4 is localized on the cell surface of microglia, where
  it senses DAMPs that are derived during brain damage. The TLR signaling pathway
  is activated by ligand-induced dimerization of receptors, followed by the binding
  of MyD88 and TIRAP or TRIF and TRAM. TLR4 translocates from the plasma membrane
  to endosomes with a switch from MYD88 to TRIF signaling. Activation of IRAK-1, IRAK-2,
  IRAK-4, and TRAFs leads to the activation of TAK1, TAK1-binding protein (TAB)1,
  TAB2, and TAB3. This complex phosphorylates and therefore activates IKKβ, which
  again forms a complex with IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO. This leads to phosphorylation of
  NFκB inhibitory protein, which consequently frees NFκB. TAK1 is also involved in
  the phosphorylation and therefore activation of MAPKs. Transcription factors such
  as NFκB and AP1 induce proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of endosomal TLRs leads
  to the production of interferons through transcription factor IRF3. Although TLR4
  has the ability to use both pathway arms, TLR2 can only signal through the MyD88-dependent
  pathway.
