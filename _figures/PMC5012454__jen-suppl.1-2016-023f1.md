caption: Physiological effects of ROS on synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptor stimulation
  (1) during normal brain activity results in calcium influx. Neural nitric oxide
  synthase (nNOS) is activated (2) through the Ca2+-dependent pathway involving calmodulin.
  Stimulation of nNOS leads to controlled bursts of superoxide production from NADPH
  oxidase (3) via protein kinase G (PKG). Superoxide is rapidly transmuted to H2O2,
  which pass the membrane and participate in various cellular processes. H2O2 and
  calcium are required for the recruiting of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (4). H2O2 also facilitates the calmodulin-dependent
  activation of neurogranine and calcium calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) sequentially
  (5). Nitric oxide (NO) produced by nNOS allows the entrance of Fe2+ through interaction
  with the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT-1) (6). H2O2 and Fe2+ react to form the
  high reactive species OH−, which stimulates the ryanodine receptors (RyR) allowing
  the liberation of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (7) amplifying the Ca2+
  signal. The activity of ERK, PKC, and CaMKII results in AMPA receptor phosphorylation,
  which is fundamental to increase the number of units in the plasma membrane and
  increase the receptor efficacy. ERK and CaMKII translocate into the nucleus and
  activate specific transcription factors such as the cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) (8). New proteins are synthesized in order to promote long-term changes
  in synaptic function and synaptic morphology. If dopaminergic modulation occurs,
  the production of antioxidants is increased (9). Dopamine and D1 receptors form
  an internalized complex, which reacts with the accumulated ROS as a reducing factor
  (10). The relative abundance of antioxidant enzymes assures the preponderance of
  physiological over pathological processes. Antioxidants neutralize the excessive
  production of ROS, especially those derived from mitochondria (11). In the nucleus,
  base excision repair (BER) components compensate DNA damage caused by ROS (12).
