caption: Stalling of replication forks on DNA ICLs induces lesion recognition by the
  FANCM–FAAP24–MHF1/2 complex and subsequent recruitment of the FA core complex, which
  in turn recruits the mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI to the ICL region. FANCM also
  initiates checkpoint response, which phosphorylates multiple FA proteins. Ubiquitinated
  FANCD2 acts as a landing pad for recruiting several nucleases to coordinate nucleolytic
  incisions. Unhooking the DNA leaves the cross-linked nucleotides tethered to the
  complementary strand, which are bypassed by TLS polymerases. DNA incisions create
  a DSB, which is then repaired by HR. Downstream FA proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2,
  and PALB2 promote RAD51-dependent strand invasion and resolution of recombinant
  intermediates.

  description: Stalling of replication forks on DNA ICLs induces lesion recognition
    by the FANCM–FAAP24–MHF1/2 complex and subsequent recruitment of the FA core complex,
    which in turn recruits the mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2-FANCI to the ICL region.
    FANCM also initiates checkpoint response, which phosphorylates multiple FA proteins.
    Ubiquitinated FANCD2 acts as a landing pad for recruiting several nucleases to
