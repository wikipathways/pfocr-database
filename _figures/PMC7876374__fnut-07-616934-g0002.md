caption: Effect of EGCG on miRNA and Ca2+signaling in T cells. EGCG is able to upregulate
  miR-15b-5p, thus decreasing Calcium influx (SOCE) proteins Orai1/STIM2. As a result,
  Ca2+-sensitive functions of T cells such as cell proliferation and cell growth in
  mice CD4+ T cells are blunted. As shown in human Jurkat lymphoblasts, EGCG also
  downregulates the PTEN/mTOR pathway and mitochondrial potential in addition to the
  Calcium influx, thus affecting the cell growth and proliferation.
