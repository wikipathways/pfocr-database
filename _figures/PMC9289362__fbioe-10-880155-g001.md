caption: Process of protein synthesis. mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, transported
  to the cytoplasm and translated by the ribosome, and then the protein binds to the
  rough endoplasmic reticulum, folding and processing before entering the Golgi apparatus.
  The soluble protein is PTMs and then secreted through the secretory pathway. Through
  cell engineering strategies such as anti-apoptotic engineering, metabolic engineering,
  cell cycle engineering, and protein PTMs engineering, overexpression of dominant
  genes, gene knockout, and siRNA interference inhibit unfavorable gene expression,
  transform mammalian cell lines, and improve cell lines Performance, effectively
  improve cell viability and increase the production of recombinant protein.
