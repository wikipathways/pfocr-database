caption: 'Anaerobic fermentation of glycerol as a platform for the production of fuels
  and reduced chemicals. Synthesis of these products from glycerol is a redox-balanced
  or redox-consuming process. The synthesis of ethanol or butanol along with either
  CO2-H2 or formate would generate ATP. Engineering the remaining pathways would involve
  their transformation to either ATP-generating (succinate and propionate) or ATP-neutral
  (1,2-PDO and isopropanolamine) pathways. The maximum theoretical yield in each case
  is higher than that possible from the use of common sugars such as glucose or xylose.
  The butanol pathway is not native in E. coli. Abbreviations: AcCoA, acetyl-CoA;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate; and 1,2-PDO,
  1,2-propanediol.'
