caption: Expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the photorespiratory
  pathway. The line and symbol chart next to each enzyme represents the expression
  profiles of DEGs shown in . The lines with different colors represent the assembled
  transcripts for an enzyme in the photorespiratory pathway. According to the gene
  expression levels under CK conditions, these transcripts were listed next to each
  chart in descending order. The grazing gradient is shown on the x-axis and the gene
  expression level (the mean FPKM value of three biological replicates) is shown on
  the y-axis. The photorespiratory cycle is a process in photosynthetic cells involving
  the chloroplasts, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the cytosol. In chloroplasts, Rubisco
  catalyzes the oxygenation of RuBP, which generates one molecule of 3-PGA and one
  molecule of 2-PG. The 2-PG is first dephosphorylated to glycolate by PGLPase, after
  which it diffuses into the peroxisome. In the peroxisome, the O2-dependent glycolate
  is oxidized to glyoxylate by GOXase to produce H2O2, which is quickly detoxified
  by CATase. Glyoxylate is transaminated to glycine by the parallel action of GGTase
  or SGTase. Glycine then moves into the mitochondrion, wherein the GDCase multienzyme
  system and SHMTase convert two molecules of glycine to one molecule of serine, NH3,
  and CO2. After being transported from the mitochondrion to the peroxisome, serine
  is converted by SGTase to hydroxypyruvate, which is reduced to glycerate by HPRase.
  The glycerate returns to the chloroplast to be phosphorylated by GLYKase (glycerate
  3-kinase), and the resulting 3-PGA is converted to RuBP in the Calvin–Benson cycle.
  * represents transcripts that were not DEGs among the four grazing treatments.
