caption: Our working hypothesis suggests that interfering with desaturation by reduction
  of FAD2 activity in the ER leads to reduction in 18:2 content and consequently 18:3
  content in seeds, with a corresponding increase in 18:0 as seen in soybean seeds
  from aphid-infested plants. In the aphid-infested leaves, we observed increase in
  16:0 and reduction in 18:2 and 18:3. These changes could result from a block in
  FAD6 and negative feedback inhibition of KASII that causes an increase in 16:0 rather
  than increases in 18:0 and 18:1. Alternatively, KASII and FAD6 could be independently
  affected by aphid infestation. Putative points of regulation in response to aphid
  feeding are marked with a red symbol. Only relevant enzymatic reactions and transport
  events are shown for simplicity.
