caption: 'Sugar and lipid precursors of prominent members of simple glycolipid groups
  and their furnishing pathways. Biosynthesis of simple glycolipids that harbor glucoside
  units, like glucosides of astaxanthin  and zeaxanthin  as well as glucosylated sterols
  , cellobiose and sophorose lipids , require UDP-glucose as glycosyl donor. Peculiar
  glycosyl donors that are activated in other ways than UDP are required in case of
  rhamnolipids , trehalolipids , vicenistatin  and elaiophylin . All glycosyl donors
  are derived from glucose -1-phosphate except that of glycosylated hopanoids whose
  glycosyl donors is derived from β-d-fructofuranose-6-phosphate and ribose . Mannosylerythritol
  lipids are expected to derive the glycosyl unit, mannosylerythritol, from erythritol
  and GDP-mannose which originate from d-erythrose-4-phosphate and β-d-fructofuranose-6-phosphate
  intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway as described in the yeast Yarrowia
  lipolytica, . The lipid moiety originates mostly from fatty acid synthesis and/or
  β-oxidation except glycosylated macrolides, carotenoids and sterols/hopanoids whose
  lipid moiety is furnished from the polyketide for the former and from mevalonate/isoprenoid
  pathway for the latter two groups. 6PGL: 6-phosphogluconolactone; 6PG: 6-phosphogluconic
