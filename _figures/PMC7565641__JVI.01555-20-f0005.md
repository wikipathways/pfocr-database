caption: 'Innate immune signaling pathways modulating BV transgene expression. BV
  infection activates at least two different STING-dependent signaling pathways: the
  cGAS-dependent signaling pathway (black arrows), which activates the STING-TBK1-IRF3
  axis, inducing type I IFN production and exacerbating the production of type III
  IFN, and the DNA-PK-dependent pathway (blue arrows), which produces IFN-λ1 in human
  epithelial cells. All of these responses suppress BV transgene expression (red)
  by affecting the transport of nucleocapsids to the nucleus and the transcription
  and translation of the transgene. RNA Pol III is not a relevant cytosolic nucleic
  acid sensor in BV infection (orange arrows).'
