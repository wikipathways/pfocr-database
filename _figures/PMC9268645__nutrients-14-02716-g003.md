caption: 'Antiviral actions of VDES and the innate immune response: autophagy/apoptosis.
  Autophagy is an essential mechanism by which cells cope with viruses. Autophagic
  encapsulation of viral particles packages them for lysosomal degradation and subsequent
  presentation of antigens and adaptive antiviral immune responses. Therefore, autophagy
  may be highly sensitive to changes in 25OHD serum levels. The specific mechanisms
  by which VDES promotes autophagy involve down regulation of the mTOR pathway, which
  inhibits autophagy, and the promotion of Beclin 1 and PI3KC3, key autophagy-driving
  enzymes. The upregulation of intracellular Ca and NO by VDES also stimulates the
  activity of PI3KC3 to promote autophagy. DEFB4A: defensin beta 4A. mTOR: mammalian
  target of rapamycin. Ca: calcium. NO: nitric oxide. PIK3C3: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3. TLR: toll-like receptor. VDR: vitamin D receptor.'
