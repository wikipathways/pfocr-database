caption: RPA is thought to remain bound to the single-stranded DNA excision gap along
  with XPG, which contains a domain that may facilitate the recruitment of the DNA
  polymerase clamp protein PCNA to the gap. PCNA is then loaded onto the primer-template
  junction by either the canonical RFC complex or the CTF18-RFC complex and may undergo
  ubiquitination by Rad18. Depending on the particular RFC that was utilized and the
  ubiquitination status of PCNA, Polymerases ε, δ, or κ are then recruited to gap
  to carry out gap filling DNA synthesis. Polymerases δ and κ carry out approximately
  half of repair synthesis as part the same pathway, whereas polymerase ε functions
  independently to carry out the remaining gap filling. The remaining nick is sealed
  by either DNA Ligase I (Lig I) or the XRCC1-Lig III complex.
