caption: The possible viral entry and replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. When the
  S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cellular receptor ACE2, it begins its life
  cycle. After the receptor is bound, the conformational change of the S protein helps
  the viral envelope to fuse with the cell membrane through the endosome pathway.
  Then, SARS-CoV-2 releases the RNA into the host cell. Genomic RNA is translated
  into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small
  products by viral proteases. The polymerase generates a series of subgenomic mRNAs
  through discontinuous transcription, which is ultimately translated into related
  viral proteins. Viral proteins and genomic RNA are subsequently assembled into virions
  in the ER and Golgi, and then transported through vesicles and released from the
  cells. ERGIC, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Created with BioRender.com.
