caption: Molecular pathways involved in irreversible G1 arrest proceeding senescence.
  Dysfunctional telomeres, hyperactive oncogenes and various genotoxic agents stimulate
  the ATM/ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. The ATM/ATR kinases induce
  the early response by activating Chk1/2 checkpoint kinases that, in turn, by inhibiting
  Cdc25 phosphatases, prevent activation of cyclin E1-Cdk2, which is a key regulator
  of G1/S transition. ATM also phosphorylates the p53 tumor suppressor that, by inducing
  the Cdk inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21), plays a central role in the G1 exit program
  (late response). In addition to cyclin E1-Cdk2 (cE1-K2) complexes, p21 also inhibits
  cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 (cD1-K4/6) complexes that phosphorylate and inactivate pRb family
  pocket proteins. In turn, active pRb inhibits the E2F1-dependent expression of genes
  controlling G1/S progression, thus irreversibly blocking the cell cycle entry. Senescence
  is also associated with p16Ink4A (p16) upregulation, but the pathways leading to
  its induction are not entirely elucidated. This Cdk inhibitor specifically targets
  Cdk4/6 and prevents their association with D-type cyclins. While p16 does not intervene
  in G1 arrest (p16 is upregulated after induction of p21 and G1 arrest), it plays
  a key role in senescence maintenance.
