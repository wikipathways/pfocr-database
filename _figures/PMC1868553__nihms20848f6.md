caption: Aminopeptidase 1 (Ape1), which is synthesized as an inactive precursor (prApe1)
  in the cytoplasm follows both pathways for its delivery to the vacuolar lumen where
  it is proteolytically processed to yield the mature form of the enzyme (mApe1),
  is shown as a model substrate. The commitment of yeast cells to either pathway depends
  on nutrient conditions. In both pathways, autophagy and cytosol-to-vacuole transport,
  cytosol and in the case of autophagy also entire organelles are engulfed and sequestered
  by a double membrane. The initial step of this process, which also referred to as
  vesicle nucleation, takes place at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). Factors
  known to be involved in the function of this organelle, including the PtdIns 3-kinase
  Vps34, are also shown. Upon completion, autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles are targeted
  to and fuse with the vacuolar membrane. Ultimately, the resulting autophagic and
  Cvt bodies are degraded in the vacuolar lumen.
