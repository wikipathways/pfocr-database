caption: Downstream signalling of programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) is mediated by signalling phosphatases. Engagement of the T cell
  receptor (TCR) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) begins a cascade of intracellular
  signalling resulting in T cell activation. The TCR cannot signal intracellularly
  itself; this is accomplished instead by the adjacent CD3 chains containing immunoreceptor
  tyrosine‐based activation motifs (ITAMs). Following TCR engagement, the ITAM motifs
  are phosphorylated by Fyn and Lck kinases, resulting in ZAP‐70 recruitment. ZAP‐70
  is then phosphorylated by Fyn and Lck, activating it, and allowing the continuation
  of the downstream signalling. PD‐1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) binding
  suppresses this pathway through the actions of the phosphatase Src homology region
  2‐containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP‐2), which dephosphorylates ZAP‐70
  and PI3K, inhibiting the signalling cascade. CTLA‐4 exerts its actions similarly
  through SHP‐2, but also through PP2A, which dephosphorylates AKT, further inhibiting
  the pathway.
