caption: 'Molecular mechanisms augmenting microvascular constriction in subarachnoid
  hemorrhage and potential interventions. A mechanosensitive complex initiates myogenic
  vasoconstriction via membrane potential depolarization: this leads to calcium entry
  via opening of voltage-gated calcium channels; voltage gated potassium channels
  also open, leading to hyperpolarizing potassium efflux that limits the extent of
  depolarization (negative feedback). Intracellular calcium activates calmodulin (CAM),
  myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the contraction apparatus. In addition, calcium
  entry and depolarization lead to the activation of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1),
  which synthesizes and releases sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) into the extracellular
  compartment. Extracellular S1P activates the S1P2 receptor subtype (S1P2R), thereby
  activating the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway. ROCK signaling
  inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), which enhances MLCK''s activation
  of the contractile apparatus. Extracellular S1P is sequestered from S1P2R by the
  cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which transports S1P
  across the plasma membrane for degradation. In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), potassium
  channels are down-regulated, leading to enhanced depolarization through disinhibition.
  SAH also stimulates inflammatory tumor necrosis factor signaling, which down-regulates
  CFTR expression and enhances the activation of Sphk1. This increases pro-constrictive
  S1P / S1P2R / ROCK signaling, which enhances constriction via the inhibition of
  MLCP. Therapeutics targeting these pathological processes include: (i) intra-arterially-delivered
  nimodipine (calcium channel blocker; limits calcium entry), (ii) retigabine (potassium
  channel activator; reduces depolarization), (iii) etanercept (inhibits TNF signaling;
  reduces S1P synthesis and increases S1P degradation), (iv) lumacaftor (increases
  CFTR expression; increases S1P degradation), (v) fingolimod (stimulates S1P receptor
  internalization; inhibits ROCK activation), and (vi) fasudil (ROCK inhibitor; limits
  inhibition of MLCP).'
