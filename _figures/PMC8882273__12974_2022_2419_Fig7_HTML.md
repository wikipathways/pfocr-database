caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways that mediate the action of
  MCC950 in rescuing the detrimental effect of the NLRP3-dependent pathway in the
  presence of mutant HTT. In the current study, we demonstrated that expression of
  polyQ-expanded mHTT enhanced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in striatal
  progenitor cell lines (STHdhQ7and STHdhQ109) and a transgenic mouse model of HD
  (R6/2 mice). Long-term treatment of HD mice with a NLRP3 inhibitor (MCC950) not
  only reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome but also rescued neuronal
  survival and reduced gliosis in a transgenic mouse model (R6/2) of HD. Importantly,
  oral administration of MCC950 markedly reduced disease progression in R6/2 mice.
  Collectively, these findings indicate that MCC950 has therapeutic potential for
  the treatment of HD. Further characterization of the functional role of MCC950 in
  HD, as proposed herein, will provide important insights that could help facilitate
  the development of neuroprotective strategies targeting the bioenergetic defects
  of HD and other aggregate-related diseases
