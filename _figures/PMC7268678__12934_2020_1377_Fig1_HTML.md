caption: The HBA biosynthesis pathway and related modification strategies. a HBA biosynthesis
  pathway. The introduced foreign genes are marked blue, and the whole pathway was
  divided into a precursor module and an HBA module. The two branching pathways are
  shown in the red box. b An RBS library and combinatorial constructs were used to
  screen the optimal relative expression levels for the four heterologous genes hemABCD
  to achieve the purpose of optimizing precursor supply. c Weakening the expression
  of the native hemE and cysG genes on the chromosome
