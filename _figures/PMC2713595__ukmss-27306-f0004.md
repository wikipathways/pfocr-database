caption: An overview of the different NKG2D signalling pathways (arrows) in mice and
  humans and the consequences of their interaction with different receptor pathways,
  e.g. ITAM, and microenvironmental signals, e.g. cytokines, is presented. In mice,
  NKG2D can associate with either DAP10 (NKG2D-S or -L) or DAP12 (NKG2D-S) [, ]. In
  humans, NKG2D only associates with DAP10 []. In resting human NK cells, some receptors
  can induce cellular activation directly, e.g. CD16 []. Other NK receptors, such
  as NKG2D, NKp46, 2B4 or DNAM require priming with cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-15
  and IL-18 to induce activation in resting NK cells []. NKG2D can also induce cellular
  activation by synergising with other receptor pathways (Synergy), in this case ITAM
  receptors, e.g. NKp46 or NKG2D-S/DAP12 complexes []. The consequences of classical
  activation in NK cells is induction of cellular cytoxicity or cytokine production
  e.g. interferon-γ. It is not known whether these pathways can induce regulatory
  activity directly in different NKG2D+ immune cell-types e.g. Treg. In some scenarios
  (*) this cytotoxicity may not just being directed towards tumours or virus-infected
  cells and may be targeted towards activated T cells or activated macrophages to
  downregulate potentially harmful immune responses [, , ]. Sustained/chronic NKG2D
  signalling can induce NKG2D receptor endocytosis and downregulation or cross-tolerisation
  of unrelated NK receptor pathways [-]. Evidence exists for an NKG2D-mediated pathway
  that could be involved in regulatory responses or tolerance induction in different
  cell-types, such as regulatory T cells, NKT and γδT cells. It is not known whether
  an NKG2D signalling pathway exists that can induce these non-classical responses
  directly in different immune cell-types (dotted arrow).
