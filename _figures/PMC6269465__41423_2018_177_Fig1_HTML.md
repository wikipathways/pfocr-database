caption: Effect of SPPL2a deficiency on IFN-γ machinery. Antigen-presenting cells
  (APCs), such as macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs), recognize extracellular mycobacteria
  through TLRs such as TLR2/4/9 (1). Thereafter, MyD88 binds TLR through its intracellular
  domain TIR, which activates the NF-κB pathway. The translocation of NF-κB to the
  nucleus induces the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 and
  IL-23 (2). APCs can also recognize the bacteria through receptors such as scavenger
  receptors (SR), mannose receptors (MR) and complement receptors (CR), which triggers
  the formation of the phagosome (3). The phagosome then fuses with a lysosome and
  forms the phagolysosome, where bacteria are degraded (4). Intracellular receptors
  recognize peptides from the degraded bacteria, which also triggers the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway and cytokines secretion (2). The MHC-II formed is associated
  with the CD74 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the endosomal
  compartment (5). The luminal domain of CD74 is degraded and the MHC-II is loaded
  with the peptide. Upon MHC-II loading with peptide, CD74 is cleavage by the SPPL2a
  protein and intracellular domain of N-terminal fragment (NTF) CD74 is released into
  the cytoplasm. Such cleavage is required for the recycling of the NTF CD74. In the
  patients with complete SPPL2a deficiency, the NTF accumulates in the membrane of
  endosome vesicles, impairing the MHC-II processing. Finally, the loaded MHC-II is
  located to the surface cell and presented to the TCR from the T cell (6). Furthermore,
  cytokines secreted by DCs are recognized by T cell (7), which triggers the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ (8). The secreted IFN-γ binds
  to receptors on the surface of DCs and macrophages. Upon recognition, the binding
  of JAK/STAT to the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) induces the expression of several genes
  including ISG, IRF8 and TNF-α (9). Finally, such signals are important in the APCs
  activation and other mycobacteria immune response events such as the formation of
  the granuloma (10)
