caption: Classification of BCL-2 family proteins and their role in the regulation
  of the internal pathway of apoptosis. The family consists of three subgroups of
  proteins connected to each other by region of sequence homology, the so-called BCL-2
  homology (BH) domains. BH3-only proteins, which normally possess only the BH3 domain,
  are activated by apoptotic stimuli to initiate signaling along the pathway. Proteins
  containing only BH3 interact with both BCL-2-associated X protein (Bax) and BCL-2
  antagonist/killer (Bak) effectors and anti-apoptotic guardians. Guardians provide
  protection against apoptosis progression both by isolating proteins containing only
  BH3, thus inhibiting effector activation, and by direct neutralization of activated
  effector proteins. Upon release, the activated effectors oligomerize on the mitochondria
  outer membrane, which increases the permeability of this barrier. This allows the
  release of apoptogenic factors, primarily cytochrome c (cyt c), to the cytosol and
  subsequent activation of caspases.
