caption: The PKA                                                     pathway.                                              The                                             PKA
  pathway is a nutrient sensing pathway.  In mammals, nutrients are                                             sensed
  by a G-protein (GEF) that activates an adenylyl cylase (AC).  AC                                             produces
  cAMP, which binds to the regulatory subunits (R) of the PKA                                             holoenzyme,
  releasing the catalytic subunits (C), which are then free to                                             enter
  the nucleus of the cell and activate gene transcription or to                                             interact
  with other signaling proteins in the cell.
