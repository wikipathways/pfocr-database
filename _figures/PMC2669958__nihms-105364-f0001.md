caption: 'Simplified model for the involvement of cell cycle proteins in the regulation
  of survival and differentiation by neuronal chemokine receptors: SDF-1α may affect
  expression of survival genes by regulating Rb and E2F-1 function. Also, SDF-1α could
  affect the interaction of Rb and/or E2F-1 with additional proteins involved in the
  regulation of cell survival (i.e., mdm2, Akt and MAP kinases). Thus, alterations
  of the CDK/Rb/E2F pathway—induced by activation of chemokine receptors under pathological
  conditions—may be implicated in HIV-induced neuropathogenesis.'
