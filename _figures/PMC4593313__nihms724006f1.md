caption: Cellular interactions in normal and diseased vasculature. In the normal homeostatic
  vessel (left), basal signaling of FGFs via FGFR1 and FGFR3 promote junctional integrity
  in endothelial cells (blue) via stabilization of VE-cadherin and catenins, which
  mediate stability of adherens junctions. These signals promote vascular integrity
  and homeostasis. Several layers of quiescent, contractile vascular smooth muscle
  cells (green) surround the endothelium. During vascular pathology (right), disruption
  of the FGF pathway by either increased or decreased signaling results in dysfunction
  of vascular cells. Top Endothelial cells with overactive FGF signaling have altered
  cell surface receptors and cytokine production. As a result, these paracrine signals
  recruit inflammatory cells stimulate and underlying smooth muscle cells. Bottom
  Vascular smooth muscle cells respond to FGF by proliferation and migration, potentially
  contributing to neointimal lesion formation. In addition, under conditions such
  as high phosphate, FGFs contribute to osteogenic differentiation of vascular cells.
  These cellular and molecular changes promote a vascular environment leading to atherosclerosis,
  vascular stenosis, or vascular calcification
