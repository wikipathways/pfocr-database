caption: While TGFβ3 blocks proliferation of both HDFs and HKCs, it selectively inhibits
  migration of HDFs, but not HKCs, due to 7 to 10 fold higher expression of TβRII
  (). TGFβ3 uses TβRII/TβRI/Smads2/3/Smad4/PKA pathway to transmit its anti-motility
  signal. The anti-proliferation signaling by TGFβ is beyond the scope of this study.
  The numbers in “n  = ” are arbitrary to reflect the differences in TβR expression
  in fold between HDFs and HKCs.
