caption: A restructured photosynthetic apparatus supports the rewiring of central
  metabolism in UWO 241. A, The photosynthetic apparatus of UWO 241 is assembled to
  promote high rates of CEF sustained by the formation of a PSI-cyt b6f supercomplex.
  CEF supports the photoprotection of PSII and PSI and provides additional ATP for
  downstream metabolism. B, ATP is consumed, in part, by the CBB cycle as well as
  an up-regulated shikimate pathway and carbon storage pathways (starch, glycerol).
  The model is based on data presented here and in other studies (, ; ). Fd, Ferredoxin;
  IAA, indole acetic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyrimidine; RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate;
  TCA, trichloroacetic acid.
