caption: Involvement of the cytoskeleton in the immune response to viral infections.
  The inclusion of actin, the microtubule, and vimentin affects the regulation of
  the RLR signaling pathway in interferon production. (A) R12C can be released from
  the actin phosphatase complex during viral infection and participate in the binding
  of RLRs to PP1α/γ. (B) GEF-H1 can be released from the microtubule motor protein
  complex during viral infection and affect the phosphorylation of IRF3. (C) Vimentin
  can regulate TBK1 and IKKε, and affect the phosphorylation and nuclear import of
  IRF3. (D) The actin nucleating factor Spir-1 interacts with the K7 protein of vaccinia
  virus upon infection, promoting the IRF3 activation downstream of MAVS and upstream
  of IKK or TBK1. RLRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor. R12C,
  a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). GEF-H1, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor. IRF3, interferon regulatory factor. TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1.
  IKKε, IκB kinase epsilon
