caption: After sensing damage such as DSBs, an ATR‐dependent pathway contributes to
  cell cycle arrest by inhibiting CDK/cyclin complexes needed for the G2/M transition.
  Concomitantly, an ATM‐dependent pathway upregulates the plant‐specific transcription
  factor SOG1 that activates expression of hundreds of genes, including the CDK inhibitors
  SMR5 and SMR7, genes required for entering and progressing through the endocycle
  program, and CYCB1. CYCB1 together with the plant‐specific CDKB1 phosphorylates
  RAD51 to promote HR repair. Meanwhile, the key cell cycle CDK activity remains suppressed
  solving the dilemma of conflicting CDK regulation requirements in response to DNA
  damage.
