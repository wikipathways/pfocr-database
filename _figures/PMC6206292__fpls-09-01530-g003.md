caption: 'Diagram of carbohydrate metabolism pathways with their related DEGs (differentially
  expressed genes) and DAMs. (A) Pathway of starch and sucrose metabolism. (B) Pathways
  of the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. DAMs
  are in bold black fonts. No significantly differentially accumulated metabolites
  are in black fonts; unidentified metabolites are in gray fonts. The abbreviations
  of gene names are in italics. The log2Foldchange was colored using Cluster 3.0 (red
  for upregulated DEGs, green for downregulated DEGs, yellow for upregulated DAMs,
  and blue for downregulated DAMs), and the vertical columns represent R12, R36, S12,
  S36, RS12 and RS36, from left to right. R12: R-12h-IN vs. R-12h-CK; R36: R-36h-IN
  vs. R-36h-CK; S12: S-12h-IN vs. S-12h-CK; S36: S-36h-IN vs. S-36h-CK; RS12: R-12h-CK
  vs. S-12h-CK; and RS36: R-36h-CK vs. S-36h-CK. IN, inoculated; CK, control check.
  A color bar is in the upper right corner. Abbreviations of gene names are listed
  in Supplementary Excel .'
