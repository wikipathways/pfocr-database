caption: Mechanism of GLP-1RAs in protecting endothelial cell function. High glucose
  leads to eNOS uncoupling, and high glucose stimulates the production of ROS from
  NOX expressed on endothelial cells through activation of PKC. ROS lead to mitochondrial
  dysfunction, increase the production of NF-κB, and mediate oxidative stress in endothelial
  cells. NF-κB increases the expression of inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and P-selectin, and inhibits NO
  synthesis in endothelial cells, thereby inducing endothelial cell proliferation
  and migration. GLP-1RAs activate eNOS to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway and
  increase NO synthesis through the cAMP-dependent AMPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.
  In addition, mitophagy plays a vital role in maintaining endothelial cell homeostasis,
  whereas excessive mitophagy after mitochondrial dysfunction increases ROS release
  instead. GLP-1RAs not only ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction but also inhibited
  the recruitment of PINK1/Parkin, preventing excessive mitophagy. AKT, protein kinase
