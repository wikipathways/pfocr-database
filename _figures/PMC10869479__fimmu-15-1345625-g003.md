caption: Overview of the P2X7-mediated signaling pathway. P2X7R triggers the activation
  of P38/ERK/JNK MAPK, leading to the build-up of TNF mRNA in the cytosol, which contributes
  to neuroinflammation. Moreover, sAPPα, released due to non-amyloid α cleavage of
  APP, is also impacted by P2X7R, following two distinct pathways, one ADAM-dependent
  and the other ADAM-independent. ROS can be toxic to neurons both inside and outside
  the cell, leading to neuronal death and promoting neurodegenerative disease progression.
  P2X7R mediates NOX-2 activation, resulting in the accumulation of ROS. P2X7R also
  stimulates the production of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles and IL-1β secretion, resulting
  in pro-inflammatory effects outside of the cell
