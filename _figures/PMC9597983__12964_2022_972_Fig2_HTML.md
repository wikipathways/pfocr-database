caption: The illustration of the possible signaling circuits involved in MT1-MMP-mediated
  autophagy and apoptosis following ConA treatment. In the unfunctional-p53 tumor
  cells, ConA can induce P73, which leads to the translocation of FOXO transcription
  factors to the nucleus so that they can induce an apoptotic gene profile. Also,
  ConA can induce JAK/STAT-3, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways, which all would
  carry on the autophagy and apoptosis processes by modulating some essential factors
  like inducing BNIP3 to exit from the nucleus and initiate both programmed cell death
  I and II. Moreover, via inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway, ConA can increase
  the cytoplasmic level of Ca2+, which results in the accumulation of unmatured MT1-MMP
  in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. In P53-containing cells, nevertheless, ConA activates
  p53 in a post-translational way to create a transient cell-cycle arrest, which will
  induce cellular DNA repair
