caption: Schematic representation showing the regulation of AR downstream genes by
  small-molecule modulators. a Androgens or SARMs bind to AR LBD and induce conformational
  changes that facilitate the recruitment of coactivators and activation of gene expression.
  b The binding of antagonists to LBD blocks the AR signaling pathway. c, d The binding
  of PROTAC molecules to AR LBD (c) or DBD (d) promotes proteasome-mediated degradation
  of AR and decreases the activity of AR signaling pathway.
