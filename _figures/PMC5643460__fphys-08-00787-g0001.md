caption: 'Sphingolipids metabolism in nervous cells. In mammals, there are two main
  pathways to produce sphingolipids: (A) the catabolic sphingomylinase pathway that
  takes place in the lysosomal and plasma membranes and leads to the degradation of
  sphingomyelin (SM) into ceramides by Sphingomyelinases (SM); (B) the de novo synthesis
  pathway which starts on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with
  the condensation of Palmitoyl-CoA and L-Serine to form 3-ketosphinganine. (C) Then,
  ceramides are transported to the Golgi apparatus to be metabolized into more complex
  sphingolipids such as glucosyl-ceramides and sphingomyelin.'
