caption: Signal molecules regulating CaN activity to mediate podocyte injury. (1)
  AT1-AA induces podocyte injury via activation of the TRPC6- Ca2+/CaN pathway. (2)
  Ang II contributes to podocyte injury by increasing TRPC6 expression, which activates
  CaN/NFAT signaling. (3) Ang II induces Ca2+/CaN signaling and podocyte injury by
  downregulating miR-30 family members. (4) RANK promotes podocyte injury by activating
  Ca2+/CaN/NFAT signaling. (5) MiR-30 family members inhibit uPAR-ITGB3 signaling
  activation through the CaN/NFAT pathway.
