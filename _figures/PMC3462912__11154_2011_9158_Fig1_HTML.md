caption: Diagrammatic representation of the amino acid sequence of human preproinsulin
  (signal peptide–green, B-chain–red, C-peptide–orange, A-chain–dark blue) indicating
  sites of mutations identified in patients with diabetes as well as hyperinsulinemia
  and hyperproinsulinemia. Mutations shown in black disrupt proinsulin folding and/or
  disulfide bond formation leading to permanent neonatal diabetesmellitus (PNDM);
  mutations in light blue do not impair folding but are associated with reduced insulin
  receptor binding potency (hyperinsulinaemia); mutations in light green are associated
  with hyperproinsulinaemia and either impair proteolytic processing to insulin or,
  in the case of H34D, aggregation and sorting into dense-core granules of the regulated
  secretory pathway. Mutations in pink and purple were found in patients with a diagnosis
  of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and type 1b diabetes, respectively.
  The R55C mutation has been found in patients with a diagnosis of type 1b diabetes
  as well as MODY. The mutations shown in gray (A23S, A23T, L68M and G84R) are rare
  variants without functional effects on proinsulin/insulin biosynthesis. The mutations
  shown in yellow are recessive mutations that affect insulin biosynthesis (mutation
  of the translation initiation Met) or cause the synthesis of a nonsense protein
  (Q62X)
