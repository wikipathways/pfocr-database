caption: ABA-independent signaling pathway in response to cold, heat, and osmotic
  stress. The stress is perceived by receptor/ion channel such as OSCA1 and COLD1
  present on the plasma membrane. ABA-independent signaling in response to cold stress
  is mediated by the ICE1 signaling cascade involving DREB. Osmotic stress is transduced
  in a similar manner as cold stress but can activate stress response by regulating
  ZFHD and NAC transcription factors. Heat stress can activate stress response through
  induction of ROS. This leads to activation of MPKs, protein kinases (PKs) and other
  phosphatases, that can trigger the Heat Shock Factors (HSF), which is kept from
  entering the nucleus by HSPs (HSP70/90 complex). An increase in misfolded cytosolic
  proteins following heat shock, can destabilize this complex allowing HSF to enter
  the nucleus and induce transcription of stress responsive genes by binding to their
  HSE.
