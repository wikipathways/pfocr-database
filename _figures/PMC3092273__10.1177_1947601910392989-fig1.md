caption: Complementary signaling pathways activated in human cancer cells. Two signaling
  pathways are shown that are commonly activated in cancer cells. It is proposed that
  activation of these 2 signaling pathways promotes progression through different
  regulatory points in G1 of the cell cycle. (A) The Ras pathway involves a kinase
  cascade whereby activated Ras proteins recruit and activate Raf, which then phosphorylates
  and activates MEK, which then phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase (MAPK). This
  leads to increased expression of cyclin D and passage through R. This pathway is
  ordinarily activated by growth factors that prevent G1 cell cycle exit to quiescence.
  (B) The mTOR pathway is complicated and has many inputs. The PI3K input involves
  the generation of PIP3 from PIP2, which recruits and activates PDK1, which then
  phosphorylates Akt at Thr308. Akt can then phosphorylate and suppress the GAP activity
  of TSC1/2. Suppression of TSC1/2 results in elevated activation of the GTPase Rheb,
  which then leads to a complex activation of mTORC1 via the activation of PLD1 and
  suppression of FKBP38 whereby elevated PLD activity generates the phosphatidic acid
  necessary for the formation of mTORC1 complex and FKBP38 dissociates from mTORC1.
  mTOR stimulates ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (S6K), which stimulates the translation
  of many transcripts including those for Myc. In addition, mTORC1 suppresses TGF-β
  signals in a manner that is poorly understood. Suppression of TGF-β signals leads
  to elevated cyclin E–CDK2 activity and subsequently higher levels of cyclin E. This
  pathway is also impacted by the AMPK, which, in combination with the tumor suppressor
  LKB1, activates TSC1/2 and suppresses mTOR under conditions where ATP levels are
  low and AMP levels are high. AMPK was also shown to phosphorylate Raptor, a protein
  associated with mTORC1, leading to the inactivation of mTORC1. Akt is also phosphorylated
  by mTORC2 at Ser473 in response to insulin and IGF1 in a PLD-dependent manner. Phosphorylation
  at this site has been correlated with altered substrate specificity and kinase activity
  for Akt. A common theme in this complex signaling network is that it is highly sensitive
  to the presence of nutrients needed for cell growth.
