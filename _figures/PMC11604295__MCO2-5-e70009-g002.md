caption: Functions of TDEVs in tumor progression. The figure highlights the current
  understanding of the roles of EVs during different stages of cancer including angiogenesis,
  oncogenic signaling, TME remodeling, and metabolic reprogramming. EVs carrying diverse
  factors in the TME enhance critical signaling pathways in tumor cells related to
  angiogenesis. Cargos (such as EGFR and KRAS) derived from TME (mainly from CAFs,
  immune cells, MSCs, and tumor cells) to other tumor cells, thereby stimulating the
  oncogenic signaling pathway in recipient cells. Cancer cells exhibit a significant
  dependence on glucose as their predominant energy substrate, with the regulation
  of glycolysis being governed by rate‐limiting enzymes, including PKM2, PFKP, and
  HK2. EVs regulate glycolysis through these key enzymes and other essential molecules
  targeted by EVs. The deregulation of amino acid, lipid metabolism, and increased
  OXPHOS via EVs‐mediated processes is being more recognized as a characteristic of
  cancer cells, presumably playing a role in the malignant development. TDEVs are
  thought to have a role in the metabolic reprogramming of neighboring cells, including
  CAFs, MDSCs, T cells, macrophages, and other various cell types such as fibroblasts,
  brain astrocytes, skeletal muscle cells, HUVECs, MSCs, and adipocytes. EVs, extracellular
