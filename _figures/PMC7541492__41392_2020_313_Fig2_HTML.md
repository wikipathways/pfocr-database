caption: The tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to resistance via EMT. Increased
  levels of TSP-1 (the activator of TGF-β1) secreted by mesenchymal tumor cells on
  the one hand facilitates the further activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway,
  contributing to a positive feedback effect on EMT; on the other hand, it promotes
  the generation of Foxp3+ Tregs from naive CD4+ CD25− T cells that antagonizes the
  activity of cytotoxic T cells, together with the induction of impaired DCs and inhibition
  of NK cells within the TME, thus ultimately resulting in immunotherapy, and even
  chemotherapy resistance. Tumors arising from the mesenchymal cells express a higher
  level of PD-L1 and lower level of MHC-I, together with more Tregs within TME in
  comparison with those formed by the epithelial cells, supporting the immunosuppressive
  role of EMT programs, which at least in part contributes to the resistance to cancer
  therapies. The TAMs, known as the most plentiful immune-related stromal components
  in TME, have been shown to infiltrate mainly at the invasive fronts of tumors. CCL2,
  synthesized by cancer cells, triggers the recruitment of circulating monocytes with
  the expression of CCR2 into tumors with the subsequent acquisition of a TAM phenotype.
  ZEB1-expressing macrophages promote their own polarization toward a stronger protumor
  phenotype; and meanwhile, upregulate the expression of CCL2 and CD74 in cancer cells
  through an increased release of MMP9, resulting in a mesenchymal/stem-like state.
  This forms a CCR2-MMP9-CCL2+ feedback loop between TAMs and the cancer cells. TSP-1
