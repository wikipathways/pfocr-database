caption: Gentisic acid attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through downregulation
  of the ERK1/2 pathway. Pressure overload, such as transverse aortic constriction
  (TAC), activates the ERK1/2 signalling pathway in the heart. Given TAC stimulation,
  in addition to the increase in GATA4 or Sp1 expression, atrial natriuretic peptide
  (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression are also elevated. In the cardiac
  hypertrophy mouse model, gentisic acid administration ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy
  and fibrosis through suppressed activation of ERK1/2 and downregulation of Sp1 or
  GATA4
