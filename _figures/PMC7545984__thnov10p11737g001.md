caption: Anti-fibrotic roles of the GSK-3β signaling network in fibrosis. SIRT3 deacetylates
  GSK-3β in mitochondria, which results in the instability of substrates, such as
  SMAD3 and c-Jun, and reduces their import into the nucleus. The phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β at Ser9 by PI3K/AKT signaling pathway leads to its inactivation. SGK1
  can inactivate GSK-3β by phosphorylation, thus contributing to the development of
  fibrosis. TGF-β1 induces α-SMA expression and triggers collagen production through
  increasing the expression of the Ser-9-phosphorylated inactive form of GSK-3β. The
  GSK-3β expression can be induced by PP2A, thereby limiting the proliferation of
  collagen. Activated ILK subsequently increases Ser9 GSK-3β phosphorylation, which
  is associated with many forms of adult fibrosis. Moreover, GSK-3β can mediate phosphorylation
  of substrates, including SNAIL, BCL2, β-Catenin, SMAD3, c-Jun, and NF-κB, which
  almost leads to the inhibition of these downstream effectors. ROS, reactive oxygen
