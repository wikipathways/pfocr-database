caption: Representative model of the NRF2 signaling pathway activation in spinocerebellar
  ataxia 3 (SCA3), based on literature evidences. As a consequence of NRF2-mediated
  activation of the antioxidant response, reduction of cellular and mitochondrial
  ROS production is observed, thus inactivating the apoptotic pathway. In addition,
  NRF2 increases cellular levels of p62, which shuttles the mutant ataxin 3 aggregates
  to the autophagosomes, reducing their cellular concentration. At the same time,
  p62 interferes with the KEAP-1/NRF2 complexes, thus blocking the KEAP-1 mediated
  NRF2 degradation and sustaining its activity.
