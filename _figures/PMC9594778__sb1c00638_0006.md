caption: Metabolic pathway for muconate production in engineered P. putida CJ442.
  Abridged metabolic pathway adapted from the comprehensive metabolic map in Bentley
  et al. Deleted genes are shown in red; heterologous genes are shown in brown; native
  genes that are overexpressed are shown in green. The riboregulated protein phosphoenolpyruvate
  synthase enzyme (PpsA), which converts PYR into PEP, is shown in blue, and its flux
  is demonstrated with a blue arrow (gradient represents tuning of overexpression
  using CRs in this study). Multiple-step reactions are indicated by multiple arrows.
