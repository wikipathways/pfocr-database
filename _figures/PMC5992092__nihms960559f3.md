caption: EVs produced after alcohol exposures can be taken up by recipient hepatocytes,
  leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of cell death signals
  in recipient cells. The EVs secreted from alcohol-exposed rodents and patients with
  ALD contain increased amounts of miR-122 and miR-155, that could stimulate hepatic
  inflammation. CD40L- and Hsp90-enriched EVs activated the hepatic monocytes/macrophages.
  The EVs from alcohol or acetaminophen-exposed rodents are functional and can promote
  cell death by activating the apoptosis signaling pathway, including phospho-JNK,
  proapoptotic Bax and activated, cleaved caspase-3 in recipient hepatocytes.
