caption: Representation of the possible connections between transcriptional programs,
  metabolism, epigenetics, and T cell differentiation states. The transcriptional
  programming of the expression of genes that encode components of metabolic pathways
  (yellow panel) will cause changes in cellular metabolism programs (blue panel).
  The changes in the levels of metabolites that serve as donors and co-factors for
  epigenetic-modifying complexes might then lead to differential epigenetic programming
  (green panel) that will determine the fate of the effector or memory T cell states
  (orange panel). The metabolic and epigenetic pathways displayed are an abstract
  representation of cellular metabolism and epigenetic modifications, respectively,
  and are not intended to visually represent a specific metabolic pathway or epigenetic
  program.
