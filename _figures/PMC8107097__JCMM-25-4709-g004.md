caption: Schematic illustration of S100A9 inducing NP degeneration through the activation
  of NF‐κB signalling pathway. The injury of disc leads to the ingrowth of blood vessel
  into NP and the subsequent activation of the oxidative stress to induce the expression
  of S100A9 in NP cells. The expressed S100A9 combines with its specific receptor,
  TLR‐4, to induce P65 translocation into the cell nuclei to increase the expression
  of pro‐apoptotic, pro‐degradation and pro‐inflammatory genes, which results in the
  NP cell apoptosis and matrix degradation to accelerate NP degeneration. Paquinimod
  that was a specific S100A9 inhibitor can block the binding of S100A9 with TLR‐4.
  NP, nucleus pulposus; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa‐B; TLR‐4, Toll like receptor‐4
