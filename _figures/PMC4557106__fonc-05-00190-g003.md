caption: Pharmacologic modulators of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo cascade involves
  many protein–protein interactions that could serve as novel targets, and numerous
  pharmacologic compounds either directly or indirectly modulate Hippo activity. Some
  of the compounds activate Hippo components and others have an inhibitory role. While
  not all referenced studies have proven that modulation of upstream regulators result
  in concomitant changes in YAP or TAZ activity, these provide proof of principal
  that targeting Hippo signaling could be harnessed as a novel strategy to treat sarcomas.
  This is not an inclusive list, and other compounds are known to modulate Hippo components.
