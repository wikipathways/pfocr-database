caption: These genes code for proteins that are key elements of excitatory transmission,
  including ionotropic NMDA (Grin2a) and AMPA (Gria3), and modulatory metabotropic
  receptors mGluR1 (Grm1) and mGluR8 (Grm8). The vesicular glutamate transporters
  Slc17a5, Slc17a8 are associated with the efficiency of the glutamate presynaptic
  repackaging. In addition, the glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (Grip1) is
  involved in synaptic trafficking of AMPA and can mediate synaptic strength and synaptic
  memory. Misregulation of glutamate receptor signaling has been indicated in AP (see
  ).
