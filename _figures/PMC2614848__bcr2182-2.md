caption: Exploring disturbances in molecular pathways as a cause of drug resistance.
  Presented are results from studies 'dissecting' the p53 pathway with respect to
  anthracycline resistance in breast cancer. Thus far, we have identified mutations
  affecting TP53 (encoding the p53 protein) as well as CHEK2 (encoding the chk2 protein)
  to be associated with drug resistance; in contrast, we have not identified mutations
  associated with resistance in the genes encoding p21, p21b or p19 [-,-].
