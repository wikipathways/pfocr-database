caption: A generalized schematic presentation of signaling pathways targeted by molecular
  therapies in malignant glioma. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are shown in their
  activated (dimerized) form, binding ligand. The diagram illustrates pathways that
  are activated upon receptor activation. Many receptors share common intracellular
  effectors (i.e. Ras, AKT, protein kinase C [PKC], etc.) and no single intracellular
  pathway is exclusive to a particular receptor. Arrowheads indicate the activation
  of an intracellular molecule and/or a cellular response. A line with a blunted end
  corresponds to the inhibition of a cellular molecule and/or signaling pathway. As
  shown, molecular therapies have been designed to inhibit signaling pathways at different
  stages of the cellular response. Some therapies, such as bevacizumab, target angiogenesis
  at the level of the receptor by antagonizing VEGF-VEGFR interactions. Others, such
  as temsirolimus, target effectors (mTOR) that are downstream in a cellular response.
  AKT is a serine/threonine protein kinase (also known as protein kinase B [PKB])
  with pleiotropic effects on cell survival and growth. Raf is a serine/threonine
  protein kinase with pleiotropic effects on cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation.
  Ras is a small G protein, ‘a GTPase’, which acts as a second messenger by catalyzing
  the hydrolysis of GTP to guanosine diphosphate. EGFR =epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERK =extracellular regulated kinase (also known as mitogen activated protein kinase
  [MAPK]); FT =farnesyltransferase; GTP =guanosine tripho-sphate; MEK =MAP-ERK kinase;
  mTOR =mammalian target of rapamycin; PDGFR =platelet-derived growth factor receptor;
  PI3K =phosphoinositide-3-kinase; PIP2 =phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate; PIP3
  =phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate; PTEN =phosphatase and tensin homologue
  deleted on chromosome 10; VEGF =vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR =vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor.
