caption: CircRNA-miRNA interactions are potentially involved in the initiation and
  progression of CRC. a Network of circRNA-miRNA interactions potentially associated
  with the KEGG pathway of COLORECTAL CANCER. The network was based on the top 10
  dysregulated circRNAs in CRC and their predicted target miRNAs with experimentally
  supported or in silico predicted target genes which were involved in the KEGG pathway
  of COLORECTAL CANCER. miRanda software was used to predict the target miRNAs of
  circRNAs, and miRPath software was used to identify miRNAs associated with the COLORECTAL
  CANCER pathway. The purple square node represented up-regulated circRNAs. The cyan
  square node represented down-regulated circRNAs. The red star node represented miRNAs
  associated with COLORECTAL CANCER pathway. The log2FC was represented by a color
  scale, increased from cyan (relatively lower log2FC) to purple (relatively higher
  log2FC). b The top 10 dysregulated circRNAs were potentially associated with the
  KEGG pathway of MicroRNAs in cancer (section of “Colorectal cancer”). Target miRNAs
  of top 10 dysregulated circRNAs were screened according to the KEGG pathway of MicroRNAs
  in cancer, and target miRNAs associated with the KEGG pathway of MicroRNAs in cancer
  were identified. Among the top 10 dysregulated circRNAs, circPRKAG2, circITGAL,
  circDDX17, circASPHD1, circSPIDR, and circHOMER1 could potentially bind to miRNAs
  involved in the KEGG pathway of MicroRNAs in cancer. Modified from the KEGG pathway
  map of MicroRNAs in cancer

  that circDDX17 acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer.
