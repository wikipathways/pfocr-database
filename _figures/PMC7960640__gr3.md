caption: Potential effects of transactivation of GPCR and vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on effector protein recruitment or endocytosis. Schematics
  (a) and (b) are based on findings detailed in Ref. [] using BRET to measure β-arrestin2
  recruitment to β2-adrenoceptor when co-expressed with the vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). β2-Adrenoceptors were stimulated with the agonist isoprenaline,
  resulting in GRK phosphorylation of the β2-adrenoceptor C terminus and subsequent
  rapid recruitment of β-arrestin2, which then subsided within minutes (a). However
  co-stimulated with isoprenaline and the VEGFR2 prototypical agonist VEGF165a altered
  the profile of β-arrestin2 recruitment (b). Although peak responses were truncated
  and then partially dropped, BRET signals did not return to baseline. This suggested
  that the presence of ligand-activated VEGFR2 lead to sustained β-arrestin2 coupling
  to β2-adrenoceptor. These data also reconciled with observations also seen in Ref. []
  that β2-adrenoceptors and VEGFR2 co-internalise into the same Rab5+ endosomal compartments
  following stimulation with either receptor agonist. This has the potential for modulation
  of signalling, in respect to pathway activation, kinetics of signalling or intracellular
  fate of receptors (recycling or degradation) when compared to endocytosis of either
  receptor alone. GPCRs have also been shown to indirectly modulate cell surface expression
  and endocytosis of RTKs resulting in altered signalling outcomes. The example depicted
  here is derived from data in Ref. [] (c). Ligand-induced activation of a GPCR leads
  to Gαi-mediated activation of intracellular protein kinases, which can then directly
  phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues on the C terminus of the RTK. The example
  depicted here is in respect to sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor (S1P1 R)-mediated
  regulation of VEGFR2 endocytosis and involves the intracellular protein kinase c-Abl,
  phosphorylating VEGFR2 at tyrosine residue 951 (as opposed to the prototypical activation
  residue of Tyr1175) ultimately inhibiting VEGFR2 endocytosis. This leads to sustained
  VEGFR2-mediated Rac signalling that drives endothelial cell proliferation and enhances
  tumour growth.
