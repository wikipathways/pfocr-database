caption: Regulation of immune activity by CORT through TREM2. Under chronic stress,
  CORT stimulates inflammatory signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which
  involving key pathways such as NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, and JAK/STAT, which collectively
  drive the progression of inflammation. TREM2 is a crucial membrane receptor protein
  with immunomodulatory functions that help inhibit inflammation. However, sustained
  high levels of CORT disrupt the ability of immune cells to suppress inflammation
  by inhibiting the TREM2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
