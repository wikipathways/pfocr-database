caption: Folic acid metabolism. This schematic shows the process by which folate/folic
  acid is used for DNA methylation. The MTHFR 677C→T variant reduces enzyme activity
  () and may help to divert the available methyl groups from the DNA methylation pathway
  toward the DNA synthesis pathway (–). The pathway is complex and highly regulated.
  with feedback loops and interactions not shown in the schematic. Gene names for
  enzymes are in italics and cofactors are in parentheses. DHF, dihydrofolate; DHFR,
  dihydrofolate reductase; DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; dTMP, thymidylate; dUMP, deoxyuridine
