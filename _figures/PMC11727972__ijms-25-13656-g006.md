caption: 'Bile acids (BAs) regulate cancers via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In
  breast cancer research, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) has potently augmented runt-related
  transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) levels by triggering farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation
  (down-solid black arrow), subsequently enhancing the synthesis of both bone sialoprotein
  (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN) (down-solid black arrow), thereby promoting the progression
  of the disease (up-solid red arrow). In colon cancer, CDCA markedly enhanced the
  expression levels of both matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and the epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) (down-solid black arrow). Initially, the activated EGFR was
  found to promote the progression of colon cancer by engaging the Ras-Raf1-MAPK kinase
  1/2 (MEK1/2)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling cascade
  (down-solid black arrow). Thereafter, it was revealed to contribute to the disease’s
  advancement through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT)–mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (down-solid black arrow). Additionally, the activation
  of the EGFR was observed to facilitate the progression of colon cancer by modulating
  the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)–signal transducer and activator of the transcription
  (STATs) signaling pathway (down-solid black arrow). In liver cancer research, obeticholic
  acid (OCA) has been found to reduce interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
  secretion, thereby decelerating cancer progression (down-solid black arrow), which
  is attributed to the inhibition of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)–signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)–suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)
  signaling pathway induced by FXR activation (down-solid black arrow). In pancreatic
  cancer, both deoxycholic acid (DCA) and CDCA markedly activated the FXR, orchestrating
  the Src-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)–c-JUN-mucin 4 (MUC4) signaling pathway (down-solid
  black arrow), and thereby contributing to the progression of pancreatic cancer (up-solid
