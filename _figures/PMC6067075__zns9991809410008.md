caption: Our working hypotheses and conclusions. The ApoE2 brain exhibits the most
  metabolically robust profile, whereas the ApoE4 brain presents the most deficient
  profile on the uptake and metabolism of glucose, the primary energy source for the
  brain. Particularly, these two ApoE genotypes are significantly different in the
  expression of GLUTs and hexokinases. On the uptake and metabolism of ketone bodies,
  the secondary fuel for the brain, both ApoE2 and ApoE4 brains show more robust profiles
  than the ApoE3 brain. PGC-1α may serve as an upstream master regulator of the bioenergetic
  robustness of ApoE2 whereas an inhibition of PPARγ signaling pathway may underlie
  the energy deficiency associated with ApoE4. In support of this notion, PGC-1α overexpression
  attenuated the bioenergetic deficits induced by ApoE4. A therapeutic approach that
  can bypass the deficiency in glucose uptake and glycolysis by providing glucose
  metabolizing intermediates, e.g., pyruvate, may hold the promise to reduce AD risk
  in ApoE4 carriers; however, a ketogenic strategy may provide a more meaningful benefit
  in ApoE3 than in ApoE4 carriers.
