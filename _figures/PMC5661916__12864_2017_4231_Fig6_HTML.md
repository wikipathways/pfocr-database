caption: The involvement of miRNAs and their predicted targets into plant hormone
  signaling pathways in sugarcane response to cold stress. The miR3440-ETR, miR4993-CTR1,
  miR164/3711-EBF1/2 were involved in the ethylene signal pathway which is related
  to the fruit ripening senescence. miR6443-CRE, nov-miR20-A-ARRs were involved in
  the cytokinine signal pathway which is related to the cell division shoot initiation.
  miR5054-BRI1, miR165/414-BAK1, miR5671-TCH4 are involved in the brassinostercid
  signal pathway which is related to cell elongation and cell division. miR5054/414-GID1,
  miR6214-DELLA are involved in the gibberellin signal pathway which is related to
  stem ABF growth and induced germination. miR2660-PP2C, miR854-SnRK2/ABF, miR2665-ABF
  are involved in ABA signal pathway which is related to stomatal closure and seed
  dormancy. miR5221-AUX1, miR393-TIR1, miR160/167-ARF, miR6190-SAUR, miR5671-GH3,
  miR4993-AUX/IAA are involved in auxin signal pathway which is related to cell enlargement
  and plant growth. miR169/1441-MYC2 are involved in jasmonic acid signal pathway
  which is related to senescence and stress response
