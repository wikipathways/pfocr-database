caption: 'Our data indicate that HIV-1-induced nuclear Aβ accumulation in brain endothelial
  cells is dynamin-dependent, involving EEA1 and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.
  Dynamin colocalizes with EEA1 in the perinuclear region of endothelial cells, appears
  to be upstream from the EEA1- and TGF-β/Smad signaling routes and may act as a master
  regulator of these signaling pathways and control nuclear uptake of Aβ. These events
  may contribute to HIV-1-induced brain deposition of amyloid and ultimately to the
  development of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-1-infected brains. Abbreviations: Aβ,
  amyloid beta; EEA1, early endosomal antigen 1; TGFβ-RI, transforming growth factor
  beta receptor type I.'
