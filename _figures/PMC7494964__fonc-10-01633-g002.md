caption: 'The direct and indirect antitumor mechanisms of the somatostatin analogs
  in meningioma. Somatostatin analogs exert their direct antitumor effects by binding
  to SSTR2, which leads to the activation of SHP1 and SHP2. SHP2 can further activate
  SHP1. SHP1 mediates antiproliferative action through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway
  and induces cell cycle arrest through down-regulating cyclin D1 while up-regulating
  p27/Kip 1. Suppressing secretion of VEGF and GH/IGF-1 and activating the immune
  system are involved in indirect antitumor mechanisms of somatostatin analogs. Abbreviations:
  Akt, protein kinase B; GH, growth hormone; insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1);
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SHP1, SH2-containing phosphatase-1; SHP2, SH2-containing
  phosphatase-2; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; and VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor.'
