caption: TGF-β signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. The ligand TGF-β binds
  to cell transmembrane receptor TGF-βRII (serine threonine kinase), subsequently
  recruiting TGF-βRI, to form receptor–ligand complex. This process can be promoted
  by the TGF-βRIII transmembrane receptor. The activated receptor–ligand complex leads
  to phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in the cytoplasm (receptor activated SMADs)
  and subsequent formation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 complex.
  Once in the nucleus activated Smad4 induces gene transcription for TGF-β target
  genes regulating proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and EMT. SMAD6/7 negatively
  regulates R-SMAD activity and nuclear translocation. AR inhibits the TGF-β1/SMAD
  transcriptional activity, and ultimately TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.
  Non-SMAD pathways, including ERK and PI3K/AKT are regulated by TGF-β to promote
  tumor growth and invasion. In addition, TGF-β promotes tumor growth and metastasis
  by VEGF-regulated angiogenesis and MMP-9-induced cell invasion. Cofilin coordinates
  responses to TGF-β required for migratory, invasive and metastatic properties. P,
  phosphorylation.
