caption: CRISPRi system design and construction for reducing byproduct formation in
  engineered E. coli producing n-butanol. a Schematic representation of the n-butanol-production
  pathway. The reconstituted n-butanol-production pathway consists of five enzymes
  involved in the six-step synthesis of n-butanol from acetyl-CoA. Glucose and glycerol
  mainly used for n-butanol production in E. coli are redirected into succinate, lactate,
  acetate, and ethanol production during glycolysis. b A plasmid encoding the five
  genes of the reconstructed n-butanol pathway. The expression of n-butanol-pathway
  genes was controlled by a constitutive lac promoter (lacP′). c The CRISPRi plasmid
  harboring an sgRNA array consisting of four sgRNAs targeting pta, frdA, ldhA, and
  adhE genes in E. coli. The CRISPRi system consisted of a dCas9 protein and sgRNAs
  governed by an l-rhamnose-inducible promoter (PrhaBAD) and a J23119 constitutive
  promoter (PJ23119), respectively. P, F, L, and A are sgRNAs targeting endogenous
  pta, frdA, ldhA, and adhE gene, respectively. AdhE, aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase;
  AtoB, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; CamR, chloramphenicol-resistance gene; Crt,
