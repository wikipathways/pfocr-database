caption: Postulated biosynthetic pathway for ms2i6A in E. coli and ms2io6A in S. typhimurium.
  The gene designations correspond to identified genetic loci or postulated (not yet
  identified) functions. Known cofactors and substrates are indicated. DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; R, the ribose moiety. The dashed arrow
  indicates that the reaction in question is used to a lesser extent. The hydroxylation
  reaction (mediated by MiaE, giving io6A and ms2io6A) does not occur in E. coli.
