caption: Schematic representation of IRI and RISK pathways linked to NO‐mediated cytoprotection.
  Pre and postconditioning phosphorylate PI3K‐Akt, and MEK‐1/2‐ERK‐1/2 cascades, which
  are also associated with phosphorylation of eNOS (RISK pathway) (Liem et al. ).
  Pharmacological postconditioning with nitrite shares cGMP‐dependent and independent
  (nitrosation and nitrosylation) pathways with the RISK pathway (Liem et al. ). The
  major mediators of post‐IRI are ROS production, dysregulated intracellular Ca2+
  overload, and mPTP opening. Nitrite inhibits ROS generation by nitrosation of complex
  I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Nitrite inhibits cytosolic Ca2+ overload
  by nitrosation of L‐type Ca2+ channels (inhibiting Ca2+ release) and SERCA2a (activating
  Ca2+ uptake) (Sun et al. ). Nitrite also inhibits mPTP opening by phosphorylating
  serine/threonine residues of mitochondrial proteins by activating cGMP/PKG signaling
  (Kim et al. ). Then, the IRI in skeletal muscle enters the second stage, where systemic
  inflammation occurs in the vascular endothelium of vital organs including kidney
  and lung. Although nitrite remarkably reduces rhabdomyolysis and systemic release
  of proinflammatory mediators by decreasing cell vulnerability to reperfusion, abnormal
  interactions of leukocytes with systemic vascular endothelium are inhibited by nitrite‐derived
  NO/N2O3, preventing lethal complications (hypovolemic shock, ARDS, acute renal failure,
  and DIC) to secondary systemic inflammation (Murata et al. ). RISK pathway, reperfusion
