caption: Mammalian Notch1 is given as an example of Notch receptors in mammals and
  Drosophila. Notch receptors are cleaved by furin in the Golgi compartment to form
  heterodimers that span the plasma membrane once. The EGF repeats of Notch1 are colored
  according to the O-fucose, O-glucose and complex N-glycans attached as described
  in . Notch ligands also carry EGF repeats but to date no functional effects have
  been observed in the absence of O-fucose glycans. Ligands require their N-terminal
  DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain to bind to Notch receptors. Ligand binding is followed
  by endocytosis of NECD into the ligand cell, cleavage by an ADAM protease at a juxtamembrane
  site followed by cleavage by a complex containing γ-secretase in the transmembrane
  region (leaving Val 1744 N-terminal in the case of Notch1). Released NICD goes to
  the nucleus to complex with the CSL transcriptional repressor bound to the consensus
  GCTGATAG in promoter regions of genes. The co-activator MAML is recruited and target
  genes are activated. Well characterized Notch target genes include the Hes and Hey
  transcriptional repressors.
