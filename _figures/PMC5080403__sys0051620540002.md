caption: Selected metabolic features of the unFirm_1 phylotype as inferred from genome
  and proteome comparisons. The unFirm_1 phylotype encoded limited sugar utilization
  capabilities; however, a complete WL pathway and enzymes inferred to function in
  fatty acid degradation were observed. Metaproteomic analysis (genes, enzyme complexes,
  and transport systems are highlighted to indicate quantitative MaxQuant LFQ values)
  indicated that unFirm_1 was much more detectable in the Link_ADIb sample, with all
  WL pathway enzymes being detected, as well as genes associated with fatty acid degradation.
  In particular, the high relative abundance of a unidirectional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
  aldolase/phosphatase (ALDOA) supported the hypotheses that unFirm_1 performs gluconeogenesis
  (anabolic glucose metabolism). Broken lines indicate annotations for which representative
  genes were not identified in the respective reconstructed genomes. Gene names and
  identification (IMG gene ID) numbers can be found in  in the supplemental material.
