caption: Proposed model in which Mad and Medea bind to the Wg Pangolin-Armadillo transcriptional
  complex in the absence of BMP signals. Previously, Mad was believed to be transcriptionally
  active only when phosphorylated at its C terminus by BMP receptor. In this model,
  Mad promotes activation of Wg pathway target genes when not phosphorylated. In the
  presence of BMP, Wg serves to prolong the signal from Mad phosphorylated in the
  C-terminal domain by inhibiting GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the linker region
  of Mad (, ). In addition, BMP signaling also diverts Mad or Medea from the Wg pathway
  to promote activation of BMP target genes, thereby causing competition between the
  BMP and the Wingless pathway.
