caption: Rgg2 (blue) and Rgg3 (green) are transcription factors that control expression
  of target promoters in response to peptide pheromones (center panel). Induction
  of this regulatory pathway generates biofilm production and lysozyme resistance.
  (Right panel) The metal-dependent transcriptional regulator MtsR (red) represses
  transcription of shp3 until iron or manganese concentrations are limiting, whereupon
  repression is relieved and SHP3 pheromones are generated to initiate the positive
  feedback loop of SHP production. (Left panel) Import of mannose through PtsABCD
  leads to enhanced expression of Rgg2 by an unknown mechanism, but we suggest includes
  an additional transcriptional regulator modified by transport of mannose.
