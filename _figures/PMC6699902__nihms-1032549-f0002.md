caption: (A) In the striatum, M4 has multiple actions on the circuitry of the BG.
  On cortical and thalamic inputs into the striatum, activation of presynaptic M4
  on these terminals can decrease glutamate release and promote long-term depression
  in the striatum. This change in glutamatergic drive occurs on direct and indirect
  pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs). M4 activation specifically on D1-SPNs causes
  the release of an endocannabinoid, likely 2-AG, (purple circles), which acts on
  cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB 2) receptors on SNc dopaminergic terminals to induce
  a sustained inhibition of DA release. The effects of decreased DA release from direct
  pathway SPNs modulating indirect pathway SPNs remains unclear. M4 activation on
  cholinergic interneurons is suggested to decrease tonic firing and ACh release,
  however, no studies have directly examined this using selective pharmacological
  or genetic tools. (B) In the SNr, M4 decreases GABA release probability from D1-SPNs
  onto GABAergic cells of the SNr. This likely occurs through D1DR and M4 having competing
  actions on adenylate cyclase (AC), cAMP production, and downstream cAMP signaling.
  Additionally, this M4 mediated inhibition of D1DR signaling in D1-SPN terminals
  occurs tonically. However, it remains unclear whether this is caused by tonic activity
  of the M4 receptor, or tonic release of ACh from cholinergic cells of the PPN.
