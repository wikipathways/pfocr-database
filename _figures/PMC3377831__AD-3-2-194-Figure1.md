caption: 'Biosynthesis and catabolism of melatonin. The main pathway is indicated
  by bold arrows. Abbreviations: AAAs, aryl acylamidases; AAF, arylamine formamidase;
  AANAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; AFMK, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine;
  AMK, N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine; ASMT, acetylserotonin methyltransferase; CYP,
  cytochrome P450 monooxygenase or dealkylase; HIOMT, hydroxyindole O-methyl-transferase;
  MelDA, melatonin deacetylase. * Pyrrole ring cleavage is catalysed by various enzymes,
  such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, myeloperoxidase, other peroxidases, and by
  several reactive oxygen species. ** Alternately, AFMK can be deformylated by hemoperoxidases
  and photochemical mechanisms. For further metabolites see ref. [].'
