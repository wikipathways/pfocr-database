caption: Mechanism of the inhibition by 8-Cl-ADO in B-lymphocytes. 1, 8-Cl-ADO is
  transported intracellularly by an es-type ENT protein and metabolized to ADOHcy
  to () induce apoptosis. 3), Extracellular 8-Cl-ADO alters the action of A1, A2a,
  and A2b adenosine receptors that () activate or inhibit PKA. 5), PKA is stimulated
  extracellularly at GPCRs by ISO or intracellularly at () adenyl cyclase by forskolin
  (Fsk). 7), Growth factors or cytokines activate GPCRs to stimulate the ERK1/2 cascade
  of the MAPK signaling pathway. 8) LPA stimulates GPCRs that interact with RTK that
  activate ERK1/2. 9) PKA interacts with c-Raf-1 or B-Raf of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway
  to stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation. 10, 8-Cl-ADO alters the activity of
  PKA.
