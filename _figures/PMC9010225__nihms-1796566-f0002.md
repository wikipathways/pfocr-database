caption: PARthanatos signaling pathway following ischemia and reperfusion. Following
  ischemia and reperfusion injury, the excess release of glutamate activates NMDA
  receptor (NMDAR) and causes extracellular calcium influx, which leads to nitric
  oxide (NO) production and reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g., superoxide, hydrogen
  peroxide, and peroxynitrite (ONOO−)) generation. Peroxynitrite can directly damage
  DNA and causes PAPR-1 hyperactivation. PARP-1 uses NAD+ as the substrate to generate
  poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) and catalyzes the addition of PAR to different accept proteins
  (AC) including PARP-1 itself, which might lead to energy depletion. Then, free PAR
  and/or PARylated accept proteins are translocated from nucleus to mitochondria and
  trigger AIF release from mitochondria. AIF recruits MIF to the nucleus where MIF
  functions as a nuclease and cuts DNA into a large fragmentation leading to chromatinolysis
  and subsequent cell death. TRPM2 receptor (TRPM2R) is regulated by free intracellular
  PAR and may amplify PARthanatos signaling by increasing calcium influx. In contrast,
  poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) dynamically cleaves PAR into mono ADP-ribose,
  which suppresses PAR death signal. In addition, Iduna is a PAR-dependent E3 ligase
  and interferes with PARthanatos by blocking PAR-AIF cross talk
