caption: Hypothetic model for PCP signaling during axon growth in the MB. In α lobes,
  axon branch extension appears to be controlled by the Fz receptor, which presumably
  perceives a Wnt signal. Once activated, Fz recruits Dsh, and potentially Rac1, which
  will both contribute to the activation of the formin dDAAM, a cytoskeletal effector
  element involved in filopodial actin polymerization. In the β lobes, Wnt5 and Vang
  cooperate, most likely through an as yet unidentified coreceptor, to promote β lobe
  extension by signaling to the same or a similar Dsh/Rac1/dDAAM module that is at
  work in the growth cone of the dorsally running axons. Thus, we propose that Dsh,
  Rac1, and dDAAM form the core of a common effector system, which is used by both
  the dorsal and ML-specific guidance cues to direct changes of the actin cytoskeleton
  in the growth cone of the MB axons.
