caption: Comparison of the pathways responsible for the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic
  effects of immune complexes containing oxidized LDL (oxLDL-IC) and malondialdehyde-modified
  LDL (MDA-LDL-IC). OxLDL-IC activate cell proliferation pathways through Syk, a pathway
  that leads to activation of Akt and NFkB. The activation of Akt leads prevents the
  inactivation of anti-apototic gene products (Bcl-xL in the diagram). S1P-mediated
  activation of Akt and proliferation genes has been suggested by previously published
  data from our group (Hammad et al., ). This could result from the direct activation
  of SK1 by Syk, or as a consequence of the release of growth factors, upon ligation
  of the corresponding receptor, which activate S1k via PKC. As for the pro-apoptotic
  properties of MDA-LDL-IC, two possible pathways could be involved. One would result
  from the simultaneous activation of SK2 (whose phosphorylation is less stable than
  that of SK1) and S1PP. This would result in a reduced generation of S1P, and accumulation
  of ceramides, which in turn would inhibit anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 in the diagram)
  and allow the activation of the pro-apoptotic intrinsic pathway. An alternative
  (and not exclusive) pathway to reach the same effect would involve the degradation
  of internalized MDA and release of highly charged phospholipids whose interaction
  with a CD36-TLR2 complex would activate the generation of ROS and increased cellular
  stress.
