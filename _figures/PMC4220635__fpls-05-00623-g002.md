caption: Predicted biosynthetic pathway of SLs and abscisic acid. In the SL biosynthetic
  pathway, D27 catalyzes the isomerization of all-trans-β-carotene (3) to 9-cis-β-carotene
  (4), and 9-cis-β-carotene (4) is converted to carlactone (5) by CCD7 and CCD8. Carlactone
  (5) would be oxidized by some enzymes including a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
  MAX1 (CYP711A) and converted to SLs including 5DS. Abscisic acid is also synthesized
  from all-trans-β-carotene (3). In the abscisic acid biosynthetic pathway, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase (NCED) catalyzes the cleavage of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid at the 11–12
  double bond to produce a precursor of ABA, xanthoxin.
