caption: Model of VEGF Action on MVECs of Blood-Neural BarriersThe majority of VEGFR1
  and VEGFR2 is found on the apical (luminal) and basal (abluminal) side, respectively,
  of brain or retinal MVECs. Based on computer simulation (), such a receptor distribution
  is predicted to result primarily in VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 homodimers at the apical and
  basal surface, respectively. Residual apical VEGFR2 or basal VEGFR1 would not be
  found in homodimers but rather in heterodimers with the more abundant receptor.
  Signaling from VEGFR1, mainly triggered by circulating VEGF, activates a PI3K/Akt
  pathway, which plays a role in endothelial cytoprotection. Signaling from VEGFR2,
  triggered by tissue-borne VEGF, activates p38 and mediates paracellular permeability,
  hallmarked by macromolecular flux, electrical conductance, and a loss of Cldn5.
