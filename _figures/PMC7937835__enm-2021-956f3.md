caption: Lessons from mitochondrial proteostasis in adipose tissue. Growth differentiation
  factor 15 (GDF15) is induced by cellular stress, including aging, inflammation,
  cancer, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Adipocyte mitoribosomal stress perturbs
  mitochondrial proteostasis, which upregulates the metabokine GDF15. GDF15 regulates
  macrophage polarization toward the M2-like state. M2-like macrophages are also induced
  by the Th2 cytokines, interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13, which signal through the Janus
  kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) pathway
  and lead to improvement of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. GDF15-deficient
  macrophages are prone to a M1-like phenotype, which is associated with adipose inflammation
  and systemic insulin resistance. Therefore, GDF15 has a beneficial effect on regulating
  macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, which is further associated with improvement
  of systemic metabolism. ATF, activating transcription factor; UPRmt, mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response.
