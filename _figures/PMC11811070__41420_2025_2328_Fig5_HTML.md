caption: The canonical pyroptosis pathway is initiated by the activation of TLRs or
  TNFRs in response to DAMPs or PAMPs, leading to NF-κB activation and transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18) and NLRP3. Following a second
  stimulus, such as ROS, mitochondrial or lysosomal damage, NLRP3 inflammasomes assemble,
  activating caspase-1. Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature
  forms and activates gasdermin-D (GSDMD). The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD oligomerizes
  and forms pores in the plasma membrane, ultimately leading to pyroptotic cell death.
  In the non-canonical pathway, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) bind directly
  to caspase-4/5 (in humans) or caspase-11 (in mice), activating them and triggering
  GSDMD cleavage and pore formation
