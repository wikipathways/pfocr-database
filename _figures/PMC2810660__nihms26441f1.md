caption: 'Newly synthesized IKK and NIK proteins (labeled as nIKK and nNIK, respectively)
  are rapidly captured by the Hsp90 chaperone complex (for simplicity, the three IKK
  subunits, IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ, are just indicated as IKK). Two possible roles of
  this association are: promote the maturation and/or maintain the correct conformation
  of the IKK and NIK proteins. When Hsp90 function is absence (e.g. inhibition by
  geldanamycin, GA), the nascent IKK and NIK proteins cannot maturated and/or the
  mature proteins (labeled as mIKK and mNIK) cannot maintain the correct conformation,
  resulting in degradation via the autophagy pathway. In response to the classical
  NF-κB stimuli, IKK is activated, therefore leading to IκB proteasomal degradation
  and NF-κB activation. Hsp90 seems also involved in the formation of a large IKK
  signalsome required for IKK activation, although it is not required for the association
  among the three IKK subunits themselves. Unlike the mature IKK proteins that are
  relatively stable, the mature NIK proteins are quickly degraded by the proteasome.
  This proteasomal degradation is mediated by TRAF3 and possibly also by other proteins
  such as TRAF2. The non-canonical NF-κB stimuli somehow lead to TRAF3 degradation
  and/or dissociation from NIK, thereby protecting them from the proteasomal degradation.
  The NIK proteins freed from TRAF3 then have a chance to activate and recruit the
  mature IKKα into p100 for its processing and subsequent NF-κB activation. Although
  it always binds to NIK, Hsp90 is not required for the formation of the NIK/IKKα/p100
  complex. However, it remains to be investigated whether Hsp90 is involved in the
  NIK regulation by TRAF3 or by the upstream NF-κB stimuli. Of note, IKK and NIK proteins
  escaped from GA-mediated autophagic degradation by autophagy inhibition remain their
  abilities, at least partially, in NF-κB activation. These results suggested that
  nascent IKK and NIK proteins may have some activity or they can become mature, possibly
  less efficiently, without Hsp90. So, the major role of Hsp90 might be to suppress
  autophagic degradation of IKK and NIK but not to help their folding.'
