caption: Tumor suppressor pathways control Mdm2 function. The p14ARF protein is a
  negative regulator of Mdm2 function and is transcriptionally controlled by the E2F
  family. The RB pathway regulates E2F function. Multiple components of this pathway
  have been shown to play a role in human cancer as either oncogenes (Cyclin D, Cdk4,
  and Cdk6) or tumor suppressors (p16INK4A and pRB). TGFβ signaling can also exert
  a suppressor effect via transcriptional up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor p15INK4B. It should also be noted that TGFβ signaling has been implicated
  in regulating p14ARF expression more directly via the direct interaction of Smad
  proteins with the ARF genomic locus ().
