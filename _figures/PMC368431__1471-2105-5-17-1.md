caption: Sample view of a VisAnt application. Displayed are connections in a segment
  of the MAPK regulatory network constructed by data from Lee et. al.,[] (Brown lines
  with arrows, indicating binding of protein to DNA) and correlations in microarray
  experiments published by Hughes, et al[] (green lines), as well as links established
  by protein-protein binding etc. Genes for membrane-bound receptors, and related
  pathway proteins and transcription factors linked by physical interaction and gene
  expression relation are shown. Protein/DNA is represented as the nodes. Red nodes
  represent proteins that are annotated in at least one KEGG pathway (the quick-tip
  of node STE12 indicates that it maps to KEGG pathway 04010). A "-" indicates that
  the node is fully expanded (i.e. all connections are shown) while the "+" indicates
  that some links have not yet been displayed. Correlations between nodal proteins
  are indicated by connecting lines (edges), different colors corresponding to different
  experimental methods.
