caption: Stress-responsive roles of UBL5/Hub1. (A) In S. cerevisiae, Hub1 is upregulated
  at the transcriptional level upon heavy metal and oxidative stresses by the yeast-AP1
  (YAP1) transcription factor. Overexpressed Hub1 facilitates intron-specific splicing
  and, as a result, contributes to stress tolerance. (B) As a splicing regulator,
  UBL5/Hub1 promotes proper splicing of FANCI pre-mRNA. Additionally, this ubiquitin
  relative interacts with FANCI protein and helps stabilize FANCI homodimer as well
  as FANCD2-I heterodimer, thereby facilitating the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA damage
  repair pathway to resolve interstrand DNA crosslink (ICL). (C) In C. elegans, mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt) induces upregulation of ubl-5 which is mediated
  by the transcription factor daf-16. The gene product is then accumulated and functions
  in the nucleus, though precise molecular function to alleviate the mitochondrial
  stress is unclear.
