  CrtE is a hypothesized functional GGPPS, which could use IPP and DMAPP as substrates
  to generate GGPP as the final product. The arrows with solid lines indicate that
  the products are generated naturally in cyanobacteria whilst the arrows with dashed
  lines indicate that the products could be potentially produced from the corresponding
  substrates through metabolic engineering. MEP, methylerythritol-4-phosphate; GPPS,
  geranyl pyrophosphate synthase; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase.
