caption: The regulation mechanism of SOX9 in ovarian cancer. In most studies of ovarian
  cancer, SOX9 plays an oncogene role. Upregulation of SOX9 expression promotes Stertoli
  cell differentiation, ovarian cancer cell survival under hypoxia, MCS formation,
  chemoresistance, growth, development, CSC stemness, migration, invasion, initiation
  and progression. Promoting the expression of certain miRNAs can inhibit the expression
  of SOX9 and thus suppress ovarian cancer. Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also an important
  pathway, and downregulation of SOX9 expression can inhibit it then suppress ovarian
  cancer chemoresistance, growth, development, CSC stemness. Each color represent
  a regulation mechanism of SOX9.
