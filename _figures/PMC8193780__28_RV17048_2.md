caption: 'Signaling pathway. Signal 1: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind their cognate
  ligands such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), trigger NF-κB signaling pathway, and
  ultimately lead to the expression of pro-IL-18, pro-IL-1β, and NLRP3 protein. Signal
  2: DAMP (damage-associated molecular patterns) and PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns) are recognized by NLRP3, causing NLRP3-ASC-pro-caspase-1 inflammasome
  assembly and activation, which convert inactive caspase 1 to active caspase 1 and
  subsequently cleaves pro-IL-18 or pro-IL-1β to corresponding active form.'
