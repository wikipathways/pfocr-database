caption: PI3K/PTEN–mTOR pathway. mTOR is activated by signaling through the PI3K–Akt
  pathway, regulating cell growth and proliferation. PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 act as negative
  regulators of the mTOR pathway, and removal leads to hyperactivation of mTOR. mTOR
  complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling requires activation of the adaptor protein raptor,
  and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which is largely insensitive to acute rapamycin treatment,
  requires activation of the rictor protein. Although regulation of mTORC2 is less
  clearly defined, it has been linked to cytoskeleton organization.
