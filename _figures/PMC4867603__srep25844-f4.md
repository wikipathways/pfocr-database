caption: Enzymes with decreased phosphorylation upon HFD were mapped onto known lipid
  metabolic networks as annotated in the KEGG database. Metabolic links with kinases
  were based on curated literature-based evidences. Enzymes, metabolites and kinases
  are represented by circles, rectangles and diamonds, respectively. HFD-altered enzymes
  are shown in blue, kinases are shown in yellow and other associated proteins are
  shown in gray. Literature-derived regulatory roles have been indicated with asterisk
  (‘*’).
