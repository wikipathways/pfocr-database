caption: Predicted biosynthetic pathway for the alkylcitric acids. The solid box represents
  building blocks of hexylcitric acid, which were not detected in this work. Dashed
  boxes indicate compounds which were detected by mass spectrometry; all other compounds
  were purified and identified by NMR. Solid arrows indicate steps for which the products
  were purified and their structures resolved by NMR. Dashed arrows indicate steps
  for which the products were determined with MS by comparison to published compounds.
  Yields indicated with an asterisk (*) represent amounts obtained from the SP1 (akcROE)
  strain; all other amounts represent yields obtained from the SP2 (akcROE hadAOE)
  strain.
