caption: Signaling pathways of MDSCs expansion and activation. a CSFs, SCF, IL-6 and
  VEGF are key promoters of MDSCs proliferation and expansion. The process is regulated
  by JAKs-STATs, PI3K-Akt, and Mek-Erk signaling pathways, leading to the expression
  of BCL-XL, Cyclin-D1, and C-myc in MDSCs. MDSCs expansion is inhibited by interferon-related
  factor 8 (IRF-8). G-CSF and GM-CSF downregulate IRF-8 expression through modulation
  of STAT3 and STAT5, respectively. b Numerous cancer-associated factors mediate the
  activation and immunoregulatory function of MDSCs. PGE2 activates EP2/4 signaling
  through Mek-Erk and PI3K-Akt pathways. IFN-γ and IL-1β activate MDSCs through JAK1-STAT1
  pathway. Proinflammatory danger signals such as S100A8/A9 proteins and high-mobility
  grow box-1 (HMGB1) enhance MDSCs trafficking and function by binding to TLRs. IL-4
  and IL-13 function through IL-4Rα-dependent STAT6 activation. TNF-α activates TNF-R
  signaling by upregulating cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) expression
  and by suppressing caspase-8 activity. All these signals can induce the expression
  of inhibitory factors such as ARG-1, iNOS, NOX-2, COX-2, TGF-β, and IL-10 in MDSCs.
