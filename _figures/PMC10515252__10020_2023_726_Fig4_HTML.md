caption: m6A modifications interact with the CRC inflammatory microenvironment. METTL3
  promotes the formation of the inflammatory microenvironment and CRC proliferation
  by inhibiting SOCS2. Additionally, METTL3 promotes M1-type macrophage polarization
  and inhibits M2-type macrophage by promoting STAT1 expression. The m6A methylated
  EphA2/VEGFA promotes angiogenesis in CRC by targeting the PI3K/AKT inflammatory
  signaling pathway. The functions of m6A “erasers” in the inflammatory microenvironment
  of CRC are still unclear
