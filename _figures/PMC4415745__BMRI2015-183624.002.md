caption: System analysis of metabolomic alterations in lung cancer. The KEGG database
  was searched for each disrupted metabolite detected; each KEGG pathway was scored
  according to the pathway impact. The map was generated using the KEGG reference
  map. Green boxes indicate enzymatic activities with putative analogous cases in
  humans.
