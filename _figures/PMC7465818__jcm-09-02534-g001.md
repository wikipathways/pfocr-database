caption: 'The canonical NF-κB pathway can be activated via multiple different ligand/receptor
  interactions. Signaling through these receptors eventually converges on the IKK
  complex (made up of IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ) where it causes phosphorylation and activation.
  Activated IKK triggers the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the IκB-α
  via the ubiquitin-proteasome, releasing the bound NF-κB dimer (p65/p50 dimer is
  shown in this diagram). The NF-κB dimer can then move into the nucleus and bind
  to DNA to cause transcriptional regulation. In the non-canonical pathway, signaling
  via a more limited set of receptors converges on NIK, which then binds to and phosphorylates
  a dimer of IKKα. Phosphorylated IKKα causes the phosphorylation and ubiquitination
  of p100, which is complexed to RelB. p100 is cleaved through proteasomal degradation
  to produce a p52 NFκB subunit complexed with RelB to form the active NF-κB heterodimer,
  which can then move into the nucleus and bind to DNA to cause transcriptional regulation.
  Abbreviations: TNFR, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; TCR, T cell receptor; BCR,
  B cell receptor; TLRs, toll-like receptors; BAFF-R, B-cell activating factor receptor;
  Ub, ubiquitin.'
