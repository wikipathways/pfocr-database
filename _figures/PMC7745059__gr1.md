caption: The cGAS‒STING‒TBK1 signaling pathway. Cytosolic dsDNA is recognized by cGAS,
  catalyzing the production of cGAMP, which directly binds to the STING dimer on the
  ER and leads to its activation. The activated STING dimer is then translocated to
  perinuclear microsome from ER via Golgi apparatus, where the C-terminal tail is
  released leading to STING polymerization. This translocation results in the recruitment
  and activation of TBK1 by autophosphorylation, which in turn catalyzes the phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of IRF3 to induce transcription of type I IFN genes and
  other inflammatory genes.
