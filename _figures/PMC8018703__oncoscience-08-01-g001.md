caption: A. Cancer cells develop metabolic plasticity in order to satisfy the sufficient
  supply of reduced carbon sources for the generation of ATP, building blocks and
  reducing power to support cancer cell survival and proliferation. The figure depicts
  the key features behind the Warburg effect in cancer cells, including glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, pentose pyruvate pathway, glutamine metabolism, and use of TCA cycle
  intermediates to synthesize lipids, aminoacid and nucleotides. B. Isocitrate dehydrogenases
  (IDH1 and IDH2) are critical metabolic enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation
  of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG), NAD(P)H, and CO2. IDHs epigenetically control
  gene expression through effects on αKG-dependent dioxygenases, maintain redox balance
  and promote anaplerosis by providing cells with NADPH and precursor substrates for
  macromolecular synthesis. Mutant IDH1/2 causes accumulation of the oncometabolite,
  2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which has been considered as an early and critical contributor
  to oncogenesis. So far, two mutant IDH inhibitors, enasidenib and ivosidenib have
  been approved for IDH-mutant relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
  C. Glutaminolysis is an important energy source in tumor cells. Glutamine (Gln)
  is an important supplier of building blocks that support macromolecular biosynthesis
  and antioxidant molecules, and in turn, cell mass accumulation and proliferation.
  The antitumor effects of several inhibitors of glutaminolysis such as CB-839 and
  6-diazo-5-oxy-L-norleucine (DON) have been explored in preclinical studies. D. Mitochondria
  play a central role in cancer development. Targeting electron transport chain complex
  I using specific inhibitors such as metformin, phenformin, ME-344 and IACS-010759
  is considered an attractive therapeutic strategy to selectively kill cancer cells.
