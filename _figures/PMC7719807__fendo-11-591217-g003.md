caption: Schematic model of GPER trafficking and signaling. Nascent GPER is biosynthesized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it undergoes carbohydrate addition, editing
  and dimerization prior to forward trafficking through the Golgi apparatus during
  its transport to the plasma membrane. Misfolded GPER is polyubiquitinated and degraded
  at the 26S-proteasome. At the plasma membrane GPER exists as a high affinity GDP-coupled
  Gαβγ heterotrimer. Upon engagement of estrogenic ligands, GPER assumes an activated
  confirmation resulting in the dissociation of Gαs and Gβγ subunit proteins, which
  in turn, stimulate adenylyl cyclase and integrin-dependent release of membrane-tethered
  EGF-ligands, respectively. Independent studies evaluating retrograde trafficking
  of GPER suggest that it undergoes constitutive endocytosis and degradation via a
  ubiquitin-transGolgi-proteasome pathway. It is not yet clear whether sustained GPER
  signaling is observed from intracellular receptor (question marks).
