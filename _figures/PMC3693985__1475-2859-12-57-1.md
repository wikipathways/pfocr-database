caption: 'Engineering a xylose-to-L-lactic acid homofermentative pathway (1.2 mole
  xylose = > 2 mole L-lactic acid). Genes encoding important enzymes are indicated
  by italics. The relevant gene encoding enzymes are: pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (engineered for anaerobic expression in a previous study); pta, phosphotransacetylase;
  adhE, alcohol dehydrogenase; ackA, acetate kinase; ldhA, D-lactate dehydrogenase;
  ldhL, L-lactate dehydrogenase (expressed from ldhA promoter); pflB, pyruvate formate
  lyase; frdABCD, fumurate reductase. The abbreviated metabolic intermediates are:
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate. The stop sign indicated
  the relevant gene was deleted.'
