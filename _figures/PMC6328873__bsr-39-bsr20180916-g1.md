caption: (A) Leishmania spp. promastigotes activate the PI3K signal pathway. PI3Kγ
  isoform leads to activation of the ERK pathway that phosphorylates PKC promoting
  the NADPH oxidase assemble. The NADPH oxidase generates ROS causing oxidative dissociation
  of the NE from the azurosome complex present in the membrane of azurophilic granules.
  NE is translocated to the nucleus where this enzyme cleaves the histones promoting
  chromatin decondensation and NET release. The PI3Kδ isoform probably causes calcium
  influx through an unknown membrane channel promoting ROS generation from the mitochondrial
  respiratory chain. ROS lead to the nuclear translocation of NE as mentioned above,
  or the influx of calcium activates the PAD4 causing histone citrullination and chromatin
  decondensation. (B) Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes are sensed by the TLR2/4 receptor
  complex leading to NADPH oxidase assemble via the MyD88/IRAK4/p38 pathway. ROS promote
  NE translocation to the nucleus from the azurosome complex or activate the TRPM2
  channels leading to calcium influx, which activates PAD4. Both pathways converge
  in the chromatin decondensation and NET release by histone cleavage or histone citrullination,
  respectively. (C) Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites trigger NETosis dependent on
  NE activity and extracellular calcium influx but independent of NADPH oxidase-derived
  ROS. It is likely that other ROS sources could be implicated in NETosis induced
  by amoebas since exogenous ROS from trophozoites or ROS from the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain can promote NE translocation, chromatin decondensation, and NET release as
  described elsewhere. In contrast, the trophozoites cause calcium influx that activates
  PAD4 promoting protein citrullination. Since PAD4 activity is not necessary for
  NETs release by amoebas, protein citrullination could be a mechanism of the parasite
  to evade the anti-microbial action of NETs. (D) The Apicomplexa parasites Eimeria
  bovis and Neospora caninum are sensed by neutrophils throughout the CD11b receptor,
  which in turn activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The ERK pathway leads to calcium
  mobilization from the storages operated calcium entry (SOCE) that promotes NADPH
  oxidase activation or directly promotes NADPH oxidase assemble by phosphorylation.
  ROS are generated from this complex and the NE translocation takes place to decondense
  chromatin for release of NETs.
