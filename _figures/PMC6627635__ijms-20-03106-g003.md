caption: 'Predicted/established targets of selective flavonoids in platelets: Flavonoids
  modulate platelet activation through multiple mechanisms. For example, quercetin
  inhibits Fyn and Syk phosphorylation whilst also promoting nitric oxide (NO) generation
  in endothelial cells. Tamarexitin inhibits Syk phosphorylation. Chrysin inhibits
  glycoprotein (GP)VI-mediated signalling; however, the mechanism of action for this
  is unknown. Tangeretin and nobiletin inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) whilst
  nobiletin also promotes the generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
  Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits calcium (Ca2+) mobilisation by promoting the
  inhibitory phosphorylation of inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). Apigenin inhibits
  thromboxane A2 (TxA2) signalling by antagonising the thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor
  (TP receptor) whilst ginkgetin inhibits the same pathway by reversibly inhibiting
  COX-1. Please note that these flavonoids may have additional targets beyond those
  shown in this figure, and these are only a selected examples. Flavonoids are highlighted
  in red. Naturally occuring signalling pathways are represented by black arrows.
  “T” arrows denote inhibition whether it occurs naturally (black) or due to the effects
  of flavonoids (red). Red, dashed line indicates uncertainty in the specific target
  of the flavonoid. Red arrows coupled with red pluses denote potentiation of activity
  evoked by the flavonoid.'
