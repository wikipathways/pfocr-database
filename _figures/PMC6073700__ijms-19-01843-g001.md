caption: Activation of the growth hormone receptor and its signal transduction. Growth
  hormone (GH) binds to and activates its dimerized receptor (GHR). The activation
  leads to JAK2 binding via N-terminal 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin (FERM) domain to
  Box 1 motif of the GHR and subsequently to phosphorylation of the intracellular
  tyrosine residues. The phosphotyrosines provide sites for binding of the various
  target signaling proteins including STATs, which in consequence leads to their phosphorylation.
  STATs are present in the cellular cytoplasm mostly in dimerized form. After phosphorylation
  STATs translocate into the nucleus where these transcriptional activators bind to
  appropriate promoter regions on DNA, which results in the transcription of gene
  or a set of genes. Box 1—proline-rich domain; ECD—extracellular domain; FERM—N-terminal
  4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin domain; ICD—intracellular domain; JAK2—Janus kinase
  2; P—phosphorylation marker; STAT—signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  TMD—transmembrane domain.
