caption: GC-MS analysis of selected DFRC cleavage products from isolated EL of (A)
  WT, (B) SCOP-1, and (C) SCOP-2 lines. 4-O etherified scopoletin and 8-O etherified
  scopoletin were detected with an m/z of 193 and 192, respectively. (D) Putative
  routes of scopoletin incorporation together with the expected chemical markers after
  DFRC analysis. Scopoletin covalently couples into the lignin polymer via radical
  coupling, giving rise to scopoletin as a starting unit (route i), as an internalized
  unit (route ii), and as a phenolic end unit (route iii). Ar stands for aryl, e.g.,
  a G or S unit, or a unit derived from a second scopoletin monomer. Mw, weight-average
  molecular weight.
