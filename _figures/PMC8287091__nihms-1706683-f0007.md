caption: Ovarian cancer ascites fluid and other malignant effusions have multiple
  products, including DAMPs (), cytokines, and chemokines (), that chemoattract and
  activate neutrophils. Our previously published () and current results show that
  multiple neutrophil effector functions including signaling via CD11b/CD18 (CR3;
  receptor for iC3b) and C5aR, NADPH oxidase, SNARE-mediated intracellular transport
  and exocytosis of granular and/or vesicular constituents, protein synthesis, and
  PS drive this suppressor function. Following exposure of neutrophils to ASC, a positive
  feedback loop through C5aR activation increases surface expression of CD11b/CD18,
  and secondary and tertiary granule products, including flavocytochrome b558. ASC-activated
  neutrophils also increase surface expression of properdin, which stabilizes the
  alternative pathway C3 convertase to further activate complement. Activated neutrophils
  cause trogocytosis of T-cell membranes that is CD11b-dependent, likely by enhancing
  neutrophil adhesion to T cells, though an alternative mechanism could be iC3b binding
  and signaling. In response to these cumulative signaling and injurious cues, T cells
  acquire a profound immunoparalysis, characterized by suppression of critical signaling
  and metabolic pathways necessary for activation and proliferation. These signaling
  pathways driving neutrophil suppressor function and T-cell non-responsiveness are
  potential targets for therapeutic modulation.
