caption: The kynurenine pathway (KP) and its suggested role in Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD) pathogenesis. Although 5% of tryptophan is converted to serotonin by tryptophan
  hydroxylase, the remainder gets metabolized by the KP. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) are the rate-limiting enzymes of the
  KP, which metabolize tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine, which is further metabolized
  into kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, quinolinic
  acid (QA), and eventually, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Kynurenine is
  converted to anthranilic acid and kynurenic acid, which is neuroprotective. 3-Hydroxykynurenine
  is neurotoxic and can be converted to xanthurenic acid. 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid
  is converted to picolinic acid, which is neuroprotective, whereas QA is neurotoxic
  (; ). The involvement of the KP in AD pathogenesis is caused by the elevation of
  IDO by amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) and interferon gamma (INF-ɣ), resulting in neurodegeneration
  and the cognitive and behavioral deficits shown in AD. It is proposed that the IDO
  inhibitor DWG-1036 will act to reduce the neurobehavioral deficits seen in AD. RED
  = neurodegenerative processes; BLUE = neuroprotective processes.
