caption: a This table shows each of the tumors in the trial, grouped by RCB status.
  The tumors predicted to have an activated Hypoxia pathway, based on the pathway
  signature and expression of HIF targets, are indicated in the first row with a “+”.
  The EMT / Stem Cell status is determined from the expression of the leading edge
  EMT genes. Shieldin Loss reflects the concomitant loss of copy number and expression
  of SHLD2. b In this cohort of gBRCA mutant breast cancer patients, loss of shieldin,
  high hypoxia signature, or high EMT/Stem Cell signature is predictive of resistance.
