caption: p53 inactivation protects some cells from the negative consequences of deletion
  of Dicer. The p53 tumor suppressor responds to impaired miRNA processing by inducing
  senescence, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Non-hematopoietic cells that harbor
  inactivated p53 can survive and grow (albeit possibly more slowly) in the absence
  of Dicer. In contrast, hematopoietic cells are extremely sensitive to Dicer loss
  and rapidly undergo apoptosis, regardless of p53 status. *Co-inactivation of the
  Rb pathway with p53 results in synthetic lethality.
