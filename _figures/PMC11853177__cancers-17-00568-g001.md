caption: 'The diagram of the cytokine-mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathway and potential
  targets of inhibition of the pathway. ① Upon binding of cytokines to the cytokine
  receptors, the signal transduction process is initiated. Cytokine-mediated receptor
  dimerization leads to ② the recruitment and activation of JAKs by phosphorylating
  tyrosine residues; ③ Activated JAKs recruit and phosphorylate STATs, ④ that then
  dimerize and ⑤ translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, STATs bind to STAT-binding
  promoter in the DNA, leading to the transcription of cytokine responsive genes.
  There are a few negative regulators along the JAK/STAT signaling pathway: suppressors
  of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) inhibit JAKs by acting as pseudo-JAK substrates,
  while protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) down-regulate the pathway by dephosphorylating
  JAK/STAT components; protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIASs) can interact
  with activated STATs and inhibit their DNA binding and their transactivating capacity.
  Therapeutic targets of JAK inhibitors and agents inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling
  are indicated. This presentation was created in BioRender. Ni, X. (2025) https://BioRender.com/h10d557
