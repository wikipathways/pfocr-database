caption: miR-15a-5p targets Fyn, FcRγ, Serglycin, MYLK and PKCθ, which are involved
  in platelet GPVI signaling. By regulating the expression of these molecules, miR-15a-5p
  regulates MK αIIbβ3 activation and ⍺-granule release. Red blunted and dotted arrows
  indicate inhibition of the targets by miR-15a-5p. Black dotted arrows indicate additional
  molecules involved in the signaling pathway that are not tested in this study. Black
  solid arrows indicate a known signaling pathway. miRs are shown targeting the proteins
  for simplicity of presentation.
