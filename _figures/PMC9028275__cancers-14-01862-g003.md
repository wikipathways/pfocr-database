caption: The association between mtDNA and tumor metastasis. (a) Angiogenesis is a
  rate-limiting factor in tumor growth. Cancer cells carrying the 13885insC mutation
  of the ND6 subunit have higher spontaneous metastasis potential. A PCR array analysis
  showed higher levels of VEGF, CCL7 and other metastasis-associated genes. The increase
  in VEGF and CCL7 levels is obviously an important factor in stimulating tumor blood
  vessel growth to promote tumor cell invasion, migration and infiltration. (b) EMT
  is a process in which the epithelial tumor cells lose adhesion ability and cause
  the migration of mesenchymal cells to promote metastasis and drug resistance. The
  mtDNA depletion can lead to a loss of characteristic epithelial cell features and
  to a mesenchymal phenotype being gained. The RAF/MAPK signaling pathway is highly
  activated and accompanied by the expression of TGF-β. The above suggest that the
  tumor cells acquire higher invasiveness. The mutations of mtDNA may be accompanied
  by decreased respiratory enzyme complex activity and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which leads to the malignant phenotype of the tumor. (c) Tumor immune escape is
  a critical step in tumor metastasis and malignant progression. Oxidized mtDNA can
  be released into the cytoplasm, which induces IFN signals through cGAS-STING-TBK1,
  thereby upregulating the expression of PD-L1 and IDO-1 to inhibit the activation
  of T cells. It has been reported that mtDNA stress in HCC cells with increased mitochondrial
  division significantly increases CCL2 production by activating the TLR9-mediated
  NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby promoting TAM recruitment and polarization and
  consequently promoting tumor progression. Mitochondrial DAMP (including mtDNA) can
  activate neutrophils to generate NETs, which have been shown to promote cancer-related
  formation and are associated with accelerated metastasis. Immature pDC can recognize
  the CpG sequence on mtDNA through TLR9, and can induce the production of CD4+CD25+Treg
  cells after activation and maturation. Treg cells secrete cytokines IL10 and TGF-β,
  which produce powerful immunosuppressive functions.
