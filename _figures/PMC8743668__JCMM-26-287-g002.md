caption: 'Molecular mechanism of relation between miR‐26a‐5p, miR‐26b‐5p and DLGAP1‐AS1:
  DLGAP1‐AS1, by acting as sponge for miR‐26a‐5p and miR‐26b‐5p, enhances the levels
  of an oncogenic cytokine IL‐6 that can activate JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway and
  reciprocally elevate the transcriptional activity of DLGAP1‐AS1, thus forming a
  positive feedback loop. DLGAP1‐AS1 can also activate Wnt/β‐catenin pathway by positively
  regulating CDK8 and LRP6, downstream genes of miR‐26a/b‐5p. In this manner, DLGAP1‐AS1
  contributes to HCC tumorigenesis and EMT by sponging miR‐26a‐5p and miR‐26b‐5p.
  On the contrary, DLGAP1‐AS1 knockdown significantly increases miR‐486‐5P levels
  and suppresses cell proliferation in HCC. The high expression of miR‐486‐5p leads
  to reduced cell proliferation, and miR‐486‐5p suppression is able to offset the
  impact of DLGAP1‐AS1 silencing on HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis. H3F3B acts
  as a target of miR‐486‐5p and is positively regulated by DLGAP1‐AS1 in HCC. The
  up‐regulation of DLGAP1‐AS1 can partly revive the declined cell proliferation in
  response to DLGAP1‐AS1 knockdown'
