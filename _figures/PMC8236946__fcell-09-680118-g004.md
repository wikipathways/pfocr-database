caption: STriatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase dysregulation in Alzheimer’s
  disease. Both protein level and activity of STEP are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease,
  and are thought to be the result of increased Aβ. Increased soluble Aβ levels precede
  the appearance of cognitive impairments. Aβ activation of α7nAChRs, together with
  glutamatergic NMDAR stimulation, increased calcium influx which then activates PP2B/DARPP-32/PP1
  pathway leading to the dephosphorylation and activation of STEP. On the other hand,
  Aβ can also inhibit the proteasomal degradation of STEP leading to accumulation
  of STEP. These together lead to increased level of active STEP which aberrantly
  dephosphorylates its substrates. Dephosphorylation of SPIN90 by STEP also leads
  to the dissociation of SPIN90 from cofilin, leading to the activation of cofilin
  which then depolymerizes F-actin to G-actin. These events, together with the inactivation
  of other STEP substrates, and AMPA and NMDA receptors’ internalization, lead to
  dendritic spine and synapse loss resulting in the learning and memory and cognitive
  impairments seen in AD. Aβ-induced alterations in PKA/Akt/CREB pathway result in
  deficient BDNF/TrkB signaling, which in turn, contributes to the synapses loss and
  synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits, via impairing the degradation of STEP.
