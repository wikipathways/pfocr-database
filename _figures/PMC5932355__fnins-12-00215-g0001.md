caption: Molecular mechanisms linking insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease.
  Central insulin receptors are activated similarly to peripheral insulin receptors.
  This activation includes the autophosphorylation of the receptor followed by phosphorylation
  of other components of the cascade such as IRS1, Akt, and GSK-3. Insulin resistance
  results in stimulation of Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1 instead of normal Tyr-phosphorylation.
  Additionally, insulin resistance decreases p-JNK favoring the p(Ser)-IRS1. Insulin
  resistance also results in decreased phosphorylation of Akt affecting several downstream
  components of the insulin pathway, including GSK-3; this increment of the dephosphorylated
  form of GSK-3 (active state) stimulates tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation.
  Moreover, decreased activity of Akt induces PKA which also contributes to tau phosphorylation.
  Hyperphosphorylated tau further impairs insulin signaling. Additionally, the high
  levels of insulin, exhibited in insulin resistance states, compete with the Aβ for
  the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) that is in charge of degrading both insulin and
  Aβ, affecting the clearance of Aβ. Through these multiple molecular mechanisms,
  insulin resistance might accelerate mild cognitive impairment as well as AD development
  and progression. See text for details.
