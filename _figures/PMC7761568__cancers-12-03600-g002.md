caption: 'Influence network of TCR signalling. The antigen recognition by TCR leads
  to the formation and activation of LAT (linker of activated T cells) protein complexes,
  including, among other proteins, VAV and phospholipase C gamma (PLCG). LCK/FYN (p56lck/p59fyn)
  kinases also participate in this process via phosphorylations of key molecules of
  TCR complexes. This LAT-signalosome initiates several downstream signalling pathways
  such as Ca2+/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) (p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (NFĸB) []. These pathways acting together induce the expression of interleukin-2
  (IL2), which is a key regulator of T cell proliferation and clonal expansion. Another
  signalling pathway needed for a complete T cell activation is the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which reinforces the survival of activated T cells.
  Ligands for inhibiting and activating checkpoints as well as cytokines modulate
  the activity of the TCR signalling network on different levels. Key players of TCR
  signalling (white nodes) with activating (red nodes), inhibiting (green) checkpoints,
  and interactions with cytokines (pink nodes) are recapitulated into an influence
  network: nodes (ellipses) represent ligands (dark grey), proteins, genes or pathways,
  and edges account for positive (in green) or negative (in red) influence of one
  entity onto the others; square nodes show pathways (light grey) or phenotypes (dark
  grey).'
