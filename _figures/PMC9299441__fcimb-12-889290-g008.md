caption: Model of F. tularnesis anti-apoptosis signaling in neutrophils. Signaling
  via TLR2 heterodimers and phagocytic receptors engage mutliple survival signaling
  pathways. MEK and ERK promote survival in some systems but not during F. tularensis
  infection. p38 MAPK and PI3Kα are required for extended neutrophil survival in our
  system and both may act via NF-κB, leading to expression of prosurvival factors,
  including XIAP. p38 MAPK may also be upstream of MK2 and GSK3β, and our recent data
  demonstrate that glycolysis and glycogen play key roles in neutrophil survival during
  F. tularensis infection and glycolysis pathway enzymes, including PFKFB3 are induced.
  At the same time, both PI3K and p38 are linked to inhibition of the proapoptosis
  factors BAD and BAX that disrupt mitochondrial integrity to initate the intrinsic
  appoptosis pathway. Having excluded a role for AKT, we speculate that other effectors
  of PI3K, such as PDK-1 and PKCζ may be involved, but this remains to be determined.
  Blue symbols, prosurvival enzymes with roles in other systems. Green symbols, molecular
  and pathways required for PMN survival during LVS infection. Red, proapoptosis factors.
  Grey, signaling intermediates not yet tested in our system.
