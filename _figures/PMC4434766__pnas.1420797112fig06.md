caption: 'Conceptual model displaying the decomposition network of SOM in high-Arctic
  peat soils. SOM input is from two main sources: plants and microbial cells. The
  selection of network components is based on the combined information presented in
  the study, including inhibition studies; measurements of gases, organic acids, and
  ethanol; enzyme assays; metatranscriptomics; and metagenomics. Each colored box
  represents a biochemical transformation of a substrate (origin of arrow) to a product
  (end point of arrow). Dashed lines indicate a less prominent pathway (i.e., butyrate
  oxidation). The dotted line indicates putative links between metabolisms/pools (ethanol
  oxidation and PHB metabolism; availability of plant cell wall proteins). The color
  coding is based on the identified temperature responses. Blue: decrease in transcription;
  red: increase in transcription; green: a switch in the taxa responsible, with consequences
  for propionate and acetate metabolisms; white: no clear change. Pathways are indicated
  by letters a–s: a, hydrolysis; b, c, and d, primary fermentations; e, ethanol fermentation
  to propionate and acetate or to acetate and H2; f, PHB metabolism; g and h, acetogenesis;
  i, propionate fermentation to acetate, formate, and H2 or to acetate and H2; j,
  butyrate fermentation to acetate, formate, and H2 or to acetate and H2; k, methanogenesis
  from acetate; l, methanogenesis from H2 and CO2; m, methanogenesis from formate;
  n, proteolysis; o, penta-glycine proteolysis; p, glycine cleavage/degradation; q,
  sarcosine reduction; r, betaine reduction; s, methanogenesis from methylamines.'
