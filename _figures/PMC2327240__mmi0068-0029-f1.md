caption: Lifestyles of phage λ.A. A cell infected with phage may follow the lytic
  or lysogenic response. The lysogenic state can be maintained indefinitely (prophage
  shown in red), occasionally cured and become non-lysogen or induced leading to lytic
  development.B. A schematic diagram showing the key regulatory elements in the lytic
  and lysogenic response. In both the lytic and lysogenic response, early transcription
  of N and Cro take place. In the lytic pathway, the delayed early transcripts lead
  to the accumulation of Q, which activates late gene expression (head and tail genes
  and lysis functions). CII activity is maintained below a detectable level (this
  work). In contrast, during the lysogenic response, CII activity dominates the network.
  High levels of CII, which are stabilized by CIII, lead to the activation of transcription
  from the pI, pE and paQ promoters. The inhibition of Q expression by the transcript
  initiated at the paQ promoter prevents late gene expression. Promoters are shown
  in green, phage functions in orange, antisense RNA in purple and lysogenic, and
  lytic pathways are shown in blue and red respectively (adapted from ). The threshold
  effect on Q activity is shown as a black T.
