caption: Astrocyte-neuron-oligodendrocyte energy metabolism interactions. Glucose
  in neurons is primarily used for ATP production and is metabolized into lactate
  in astrocytes. The glucose transporters (GLUTs) mediate the transportation of glucose
  into cells. GLUT1, located in cerebral endothelial cells, transits glucose from
  the blood into the brain tissue. GLUT1 also mediates the entrance of glucose into
  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Glucose is transported into neurons via GLUT3.
  Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and connexin (Cx) contribute to astrocyte-neuron-oligodendrocyte
  lactate transport. MCT1 and MCT4 in astrocytes release lactate, which diffuses into
  neurons due to the lactate gradient and is actively taken up by neurons via the
  MCT2. Additionally, MCT1 in the myelin cooperates with MCT2 in the axon to translate
  the lactate from oligodendrocytes to neurons. Therefore, glucose and lactate, together
  with their transporters, contribute to the astrocyte-neuron-oligodendrocyte energy
  metabolism interactions. TCA, tricarboxylic acid; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
