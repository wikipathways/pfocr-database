caption: Representation of some of the metabolic adaptation and reprogramming of cancer
  stem cells. In the interconnected metabolic pathways of glucose, the key junctions
  are glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway and central molecules are Glucose-6-phosphate,
  Pyruvate and Acetyl-CoA. In proliferative state cells metabolized Glucose mainly
  through PPP and perform less glycolysis and ATP has been produced from TCA cycle
  via respiratory electron-transfer chain by Acetyl-CoA coming either from pyruvate,
  Fatty acids and Amino acids oxidation. In Hypoxic condition PPP is inhibited and
  glucose metabolized through anaerobic glycolytic pathway. In presence of low glucose
  intermediate metabolites and ATP are produced mainly by glutaminolysis and fatty
  acids oxidation. CSCs synthesize fatty acids for membrane formation and oxidized
  this for energy production the equilibrium between anabolism and catabolism of fatty
  acids is maintain by NADPH and ATP requirement.
