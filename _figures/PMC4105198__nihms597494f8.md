caption: (a–b) During EGFR TKI treatment, a β3-positive cancer stem cell population
  is selected. Integrin β3 interacts with KRAS via Galectin-3 to promote RalB activation.
  RalB subsequently activates TBK1 resulting in the activation of the NFkB pathway
  and thereby promoting cell survival. Importantly, ligation of integrin is not required
  for this signaling cascade. As demonstrated the inhibition of this non-canonical
  pathway sensitizes β3-positive tumor cells to EGFR TKI. Targeting this pathway genetically
  or pharmacologically was able to reverse cancer stemness and drug resistance.
