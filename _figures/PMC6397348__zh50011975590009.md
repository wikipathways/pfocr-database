caption: 'Diagram: BPI fold-containing group A member 1 (Bpifa1) regulation of noncanonical
  Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interferon (IFN) signaling. Left: Bpifa1 is a lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)-binding molecule and is likely to influence inflammatory signaling by modulating
  LPS-TLR4 interactions. In the absence of Bpifa1, impaired noncanonical TLR4 signaling
  through TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing INFβ1 (TRIF) results in decreased
  interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) expression, leading to decreased IFNλ expression.
  Canonical LPS-TLR4 activation and cytokine expression is not affected by Bpifa1
  deficiency. Middle: Bpifa1 binding to LPS facilitates immune signaling through TNF
  receptor associated factors (TRAF), which in turn activates IRF5 to induce interleukin
  (IL)-12 expression, inducing IFNγ. During Bpifa1 deficiency, key components of this
  pathway are downregulated (IL-12rb1, Jak2, Irf5), resulting in decreased IFNγ expression.
  Right: decreased expression of IFNγ and IFNλ during Bpifa1 deficiency causes downstream
  downregulation of Irf9, Irf7, Cxcl10, Cxcl9 and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). Shaded
  boxes denote lower gene expression in our model. Dashed arrows represent impaired
  signaling pathways in our model. AEC, airway epithelial cell; APC, antigen-presenting
