caption: 'Mitochondrial energy metabolism. Energy metabolic processes occurring in
  mitochondria mainly include the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative
  phosphorylation has been classified as (1) oxidizing phase: Transfer of electrons
  from reducing coenzymes through complexes I–IV to the electron terminal receptor
  “O2” (this process is also known as ETC); (2) TCA cycle: The energy released by
  ETC is stored in an electrochemical gradient that catalyzes the complex V that phosphorylates
  ADP to ATP. Complexes I/II are electron‐receiving portals in the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway, receiving electrons from NADH and FADH2, respectively, but complex II does
  not exercise the function of pumping H+ to the intermembrane space. Complexes I/III/IV
  utilize the energy released during the transfer of electrons to pump H+ outward.
  Because complexes I–IV are anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane, they require
  the lipid‐soluble electron transport “messengers”, cytochrome c and coenzyme Q (ubiquinone),
  in order to complete the process of ATP formation. Complex II plays a dual role
  in cellular energy metabolism because it is also a key enzyme in the TCA cycle.
  Mutations in IDH, FH, and SDH, genes encoding key enzymes in the TCA cycle, reprogram
  energy metabolism and promote the development of certain cancers. complexes I, NADH:
  ubiquinone oxidoreductase; complex II, succinate dehydrogenase; complex III, cytochrome
  bc1; complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase; complex V, ATP synthase; ETC, electron transport
  chain; FH, fumarate hydratase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase'
