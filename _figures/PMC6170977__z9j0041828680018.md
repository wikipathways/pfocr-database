caption: 'Nutrient stress and insulin resistance. A: endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
  manifested as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is activated in multiple models
  of liver insulin resistance. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen
  initiates the UPR, activating PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (PERK),
  inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6).
  Key effectors of the UPR include c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mRNA splice
  variant of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s). JNK may directly impair proximal insulin
  signaling, although this is controversial. XBP1s transcriptionally activates the
  de novo lipogenic program and promotes hepatic steatosis, which may in turn drive
  hepatic insulin resistance through diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC)ε
  signaling. B: muscle insulin resistance is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction,
  although cause and effect relationships are not clearly defined. The red pathway
  describes observations made in humans: older adults and the young lean insulin-resistant
  offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) display reduced mitochondrial ATP
  synthesis in skeletal muscle, probably reflective of reduced ATP demand as resting
  mitochondria operate at submaximal ATP synthetic rates. This decrease in substrate
  oxidation promotes lipid storage, increasing intramyocellular lipid (IMCL). IMCL
  accumulation may then impair proximal insulin signaling through activation of the
  DAG/PKCθ axis, accounting for the reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake observed
  in these individuals. Alternatively, chronic overnutrition and/or lipid oversupply
  increases the mitochondrial capacity for fatty acid oxidation. However, because
  ATP demand is relatively inflexible, this increase is not enough to match supply,
  leading to IMCL accumulation and increased rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation.
  Incomplete fatty acid oxidation produces acylcarnitine species and reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Acylcarnitines have been hypothesized to impair insulin signaling
  through undefined mechanisms, and ROS have broad cellular effects, including impairment
  of mitochondrial function. ROS-induced mitochondrial damage would then exacerbate
  these effects, further promoting IMCL accumulation and ROS production.'
