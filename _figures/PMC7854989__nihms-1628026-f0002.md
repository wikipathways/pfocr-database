caption: a) Normal liver biology reveals heterogenous spatially zonated hepatocytes
  as well as liver endothelial cells. Hepatocytes in the periportal zones that receive
  more oxygen complete high ATP-demanding tasks such as cholesterol synthesis and
  urea cycle and use the Ras signaling pathway. Pericentral hepatocytes in a chronic
  hypoxic environment are used for tasks such as bile synthesis and drug metabolism
  and use the Wnt pathway. b) Liver fibrosis activates heterogeneous subsets of myofibroblasts
  (MFB) with only one subpopulation that expresses alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
  S100a6 is proposed as a more universal marker for MFB activation. One subpopulation
  of MFBs that is termed “scar-associated” is PDGFRa+ and is influenced by HSCs and
  scar-associated macrophages (SAMac) which have a unique gene signature and are pro-fibrogenic.
  HSCs are also spatially zonated to be either portal vein-associated (PaHSC) or central
  vein-associated (CaHSC). CaHSCs are the pathogenic collagen producing cells and
  exclusively express LPAR1, which binds the lipid signaling molecule lysophosphatidic
  acid. c) In liver endothelial cells (LEC), NASH increased expression of genes involved
  in lipid metabolism, antigen presentation, and chemokine release, but down regulated
  those involved in vascular development and homeostasis. NASH expands the monocyte-derived
  macrophage (MDM) population whereas the Kupffer cell (KC) population is decreased.
  TREM2+ macrophages correlated with increased liver fibrosis and a higher NAFLD score.
  These MDMs also had downregulation of S100a8 and S100a9. NASH conditions led to
  increased expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and
  remodeling, but restricted expression of NGfr, which promotes HSC apoptosis. d)
  Expansion of macrophages were also found in visceral adipose tissue of mice fed
  a high fat diet. These macrophages were also heterogenous with one subpopulation
  being Trem2+.
