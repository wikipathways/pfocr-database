caption: The overall hypothetical outline of integrated approach of distinct signalling axis
  for the stimulation of coagulatory mechanism during Covid-19 infection a. The infection
  of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs generates a condition of hypoxia followed by the activation
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signallingwhich ultimately stimulates HIF-1 by forming a complex
  of HIF-1α and HIF-1β in combination with transactivators including CBP and P300,
  b. The activated HIF-1 complex turns on the direct expression of VEGF, essential
  for the process of angiogenesis, c. HIF-1 also triggers expression of NF-κB, a transcription
  factor by activating of IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ) to phosphorylate the inhibitor
  of the classical pathway (IκBα), resulting degradation by its proteasomes. The transcriptionally
  active classical NF-κB heterodimer (p50:p65) then gets free to enter the nucleus
  and affect transcription of inflammatory genes, d. Simultaneously, HIF-1 also enhances
  apoptotic response by facilitating mitochondria to release cytochrome C and activates
  caspase 3. Likewise, HIF-1 can activate BNIP3 which binds Bcl-2/Bcl-xl and activates
  proapoptotic protein, Bax. HIF-1 also causes the stabilization of p53, required
  for apoptosis. JNK/SAPK  signalling activated by HIF-1 can also initiate apoptotic
   cascade through an unknown mechanism.  These signalling activation by HIF-1 can
   trigger the process of apoptosis, followd by PS externalization, Collectively,
  hypoxia induced mechanisms including inflammation, angiogenesis and apoptosis can
  further direct to the establishment of  thrombotic cascades. The dashed arrow (
