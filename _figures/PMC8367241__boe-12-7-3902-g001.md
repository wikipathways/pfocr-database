caption: Schematics of the optical redox ratio (ORR) in mitochondria, following light
  absorption by cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and its correlation to the ATP generation
  pathway. Normal cells produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in normoxic
  conditions. Within the mitochondria, NADH and  are oxidized, respectively, to  and
  FAD, increasing RR. In hypoxic conditions, cells use the glycolysis pathway to supply
  ATP. Glycolysis reduces the electron carriers  and FAD to NADH and , respectively,
  lowering the ORR.
