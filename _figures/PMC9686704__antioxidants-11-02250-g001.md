caption: '(A) Under the condition of high glucose, the overload of NADH and FADH2
  produced by the TCA cycle in retinal cells can induce high mitochondrial membrane
  potential, which makes the ETC stagnate in complex III, and the electrons and protons
  accepted by CoQ are difficult to transfer to the downstream. At this time, O2 can
  be used as electron acceptors to generate superoxide. (B) The accumulation of intracellular
  superoxide can consume NAD+, thus inhibiting the activity of GAPDH and blocking
  the glycolytic pathway. (C) The polyol pathway of glycolysis is activated, that
  is, glucose is converted into sorbitol under the action of aldose reductase, and
  sorbitol can be catalyzed by NAD+ into fructose. Due to the consumption of NAD+,
  sorbitol accumulates, leading to cell hypertonicity, damaging retinal capillary
  endothelial cells, and causing microcirculation disorders. (D) The metabolic pathway
  of hexosamine is activated. The produced glucosamine can lead to the loss of retinal
  pericytes and the formation of acellular capillaries by inhibiting VEGFR2 and Ang2
  in the normal retina. At the same time, the production of UDPGlcNAc increases, promoting
  the synthesis of O-linked glycoprotein. The latter covalently modifies transcription
  factor Sp1, activating the expression of glucose-responsive gene Pal-1 in vascular
  smooth muscle cells, thus promoting the occurrence of DR. (E) The decrease of GAPDH
  activity leads to the increase of triose phosphate, which can produce DAG and also
  participate in the formation of various AGEs. DAG can directly activate PKC, increasing
  the activity of PLA2 and promoting the production of PGE2, thereby inhibiting the
  activity of Na+/K+ ATPase. PKC itself is associated with increased permeability
  of retinal vascular endothelial cells, angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and decreased
  blood flow. (F) AGEs can interact with RAGE to promote the activation of NF-κB,
  upregulate the expression of VEGF and ICAM-1, and activate the RhoA/ROCK signaling
  pathway, thus promoting apoptosis, increasing vascular permeability, causing microcirculation
  disorders, and inducing angiogenesis in the retina. Abbreviations: NADH, nicotinamide
