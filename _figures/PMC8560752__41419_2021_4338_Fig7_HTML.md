caption: ARSD, as a molecule brake on ERα signaling pathway, restricts ERα in an uncontrolled
  active state and avoids the overgrowth caused by ERα through activating Hippo/YAP
  pathway in order to reach homeostasis in breast luminal epithelial cells.

  of breast cancer cells via activating Hippo/YAP pathway.
