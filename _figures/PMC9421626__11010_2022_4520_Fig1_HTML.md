caption: Protective mechanisms of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and hydroxychloroquine
  (HCQ) against Type II diabetes and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Type II
  diabetes leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolic derangement, downregulation
  of NO/cGMP/PKG signaling resulting in endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction.
  These conditions predispose diabetic individuals extremely vulnerable to severe
  COVID-19 infection and “cytokine storm”, which may lead to high risk of vascular
  hyperpermeability, pulmonary dysfunction, increased risk of myocardial infarction,
  and sudden cardiac death. PDE5 inhibitors are known to activate NO/cGMP/PKG signaling
  pathway, which may improve pulmonary function and exert cardioprotective effect.
  HCQ can exert anti-diabetes actions via inhibiting insulin degradation as well as
  enhancing pancreatic insulin secretion, along with its well-known anti-inflammatory
  effects. Furthermore, PDE5 inhibitors and HCQ may also suppress SARS-CoV-2 cell
  entry/viral proliferation and alleviate the pathological events (e.g., cytokine
  storm) of COVID-19 in the vital organs, such as heart and lungs. eNOS endothelial
