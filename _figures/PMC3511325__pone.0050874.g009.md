caption: ', IL-6/R or OSM activates the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which increases Bcl-xL
  expression and causes activation of the Akt signaling pathway in a STAT3-dependent
  manner. Increased Bcl-xL expression and binding to Bax, as well as Akt activation
  inhibits NMDA or glutamate-induced neuronal death. B, IL-6/R and OSM also induce
  SOCS3 expression in a STAT3-dependent fashion. SOCS3, in turn, modulates IL-6/R
  or OSM induced Bcl-xL expression and Akt signaling pathway in a negative regulatory
  manner, which contributes, in part, to NMDA or glutamate-induced neuronal death.'
