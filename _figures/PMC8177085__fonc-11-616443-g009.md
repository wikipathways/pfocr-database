caption: A proposed model for the pyrotinib-mediated inhibitory effects on the apoptosis,
  migration, and invasion of BCs. Pyrotinib is an irreversible HER 1, 2, and 4 inhibitor
  that inhibits the downstream signals of the Akt/p-65/FOXC1 pathway, resulting in
  a significant efficacy in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HER2-overexpressing
  cancer cells.
