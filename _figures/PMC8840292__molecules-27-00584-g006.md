caption: Integrated network of functional interactions between metabolites (represented
  by their KEGG C-codes) and genes (represented by their abbreviation names) whose
  levels were affected in rare minnow by MP exposure. Metabolites and genes are connected
  if they share at least one common KEGG pathway. Increased or decreased metabolite
  or mRNA abundances (genes) in MP-exposed samples are indicated by red and blue symbols,
  respectively. Standard names of some relevant metabolites are shown in green.
