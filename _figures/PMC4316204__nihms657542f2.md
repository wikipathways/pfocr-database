caption: a | Tadpole-to-adult intestinal epithelium remodelling during Xenopus laevis
  morphogenesis. In the pre-metamorphosis tadpole, the small intestine consists of
  a single layer of larval epithelium (also known as typhlosole), connective tissue
  and a thin muscle layer. During metamorphosis, thyroid hormone (TH) is produced
  in high levels, inducing the release of matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) by stromal
  cells to trigger apoptosis of larval epithelial cells. At the same time, proliferating
  stem and progenitor cells give rise to new adult epithelial cells that replace the
  larval epithelium. During metamorphosis, the basement membrane and the muscle layer
  are thicker. The levels of other MMPs, such as MMP2 and/or MMP9 and MMP14, increase
  during tadpole metamorphosis after epithelial cell death, suggesting that they may
  have a role post-apoptosis. At the end of metamorphosis, the differentiated adult
  intestine becomes capable of self-renewal and forms a multiply folded epithelium,
  similar to the mammalian adult intestine.b–d | Intestinal epithelium remodelling
  in other vertebrates. Laminin distribution during mammalian intestine development
  determines small intestine and colon architecture. The basement membrane of villi
  in the intestine is composed mainly of laminin 511 α5 chain. In mice, a lack of
  laminin 511 in the intestinal basement membrane leads to a compensatory deposition
  of colonic laminins (laminin 111 and laminin 411), which results in the transformation
  of the small intestinal to a tissue with a colon-like mucosal structure that shows
  high levels of cell proliferation, low levels of the cell cycle inhibitor cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor B (CDKN1B), and higher numbers of goblet cells (part b). RGD-dependent
  substrates such as fibronectin can bind to α8β1 integrin. This anchorage prevents
  anoikis in undifferentiated human intestinal epithelial crypt (HIEC) cells through
  the recruitment of vinculin and the activation of the PI3K–AKT signalling pathway
  (part c). Collagen VI is produced by HIEC cells and regulates fibronectin assembly
  by restraining cell–fibronectin interactions, which influences cell functions such
  as migration. A lack of collagen VI leads to recruitment of tensin at the fibrillar
  adhesion points via the activation of myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs), which
  mediate actomyosin contractility, extensive fibrillogenesis and cell migration (part
  d). FAK, focal adhesion kinase. Figure part a modified from Establishment of intestinal
  stem cell niche during amphibian metamorphosis. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol Volume 103.
