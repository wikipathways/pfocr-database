caption: 'The molecular mediators and ‘direct’ anti-cancer/anti-tumor effects of metformin
  in breast cancers: (A) Metformin treatment-mediated adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) activation subsequently involves ‘AMPK-dependent’ inhibition
  of mTORC1, cellular-Myc (c-Myc), acetyl–CoA carboxylase (ACC), and NF-κB and pathways
  and/or activation of p53 pathway and double-stranded RNA specific endoribonuclease
  (DICER)-dependent pathways. The ‘AMPK-independent’ anti-cancer or anti-tumor effects
  of metformin reportedly require the activation of regulated DNA damage-1 (REDD1)
  and/or the inhibition of Rag GTPases and signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3)-dependent mechanisms. (B) Both AMPK-dependent and independent mechanisms
  ultimately account for the reported in vitro, in vivo, and clinical anti-cancer
  effects of metformin that involve translational inactivation, cell-cycle arrest,
  inhibition of cellular proliferation and migration, activation of apoptotic cell
  death, inhibition of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), suppression of cancer
  invasiveness and metastasis, and counteracting multidrug/therapy resistance in breast
  cancers.'
