caption: Coordinated upregulation of cytoprotective genes occurs as a result of Nrf2
  activation. Nrf2-dependent genes identified by microarray are listed in bold italics.
  These genes function together in the production and utilization of glutathione.
  Genes involved in cellular uptake of glutathione-constituent amino acids glycine
  and glutamate are increased. Additionally, the rate-limiting step of glutathione
  synthesis is the formation of the γ-glutamyl cysteine moiety by γ-glutamyl cysteine
  ligase. Transcription of both subunits of this enzyme is induced. Moreover, enzymes
  responsible for glutathione utilization, reduction, and conjugation are all represented
  in microarray data. Similarly, production and use of the common detoxification enzyme
  cofactor NADPH is stimulated. The pentose phosphate pathway is a common cellular
  mechanism whose two main functions are the production of reduction equivalents in
  the form of NADPH and the production of ribulose-5-phosphate for nucleotide and
  nucleic acid synthesis. In the case of Nrf2 activation, the pathway is focused on
  NADPH production, as the fructose-5-phosphate molecules are recycled back to glucose-6-phosphate
  by transaldolase and transketolase. NADPH also may be synthesized by malic enzyme
  oxidation of malate to pyruvate. NADPH is the major cofactor used in cellular reductions
  and is used especially frequently by detoxification enzymes like NQO1, P450s, and
  GSTs. Furthermore, Nrf2-dependent genes function together to detoxify superoxide,
  and meanwhile to prevent Fenton chemistry on the SOD-produced intermediate H2O2.
  This occurs by two methods. First, ferretin sequesters free iron by binding it in
  the ferric form. Second, catalase, thioredoxin, and peroxiredoxins reduce H2O2 to
  water. Thus, Nrf2-driven genes reduce superoxide to water and prevent production
  of hydroxyl radicals. [Modified from Lee et al., 2004 ()].
