caption: 'The role of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) and kynurenine pathway
  metabolites in adaptive immunity. The induction of IDO1 expression on professional
  APC leads to TRP depletion and KYNs generation in the local microenvironment. Together,
  TRP deprivation and KYNs-dependent activation of AhR signaling result in metabolic
  stress sensed by GCN2K, mTOR, and TCR complex zeta-chain, leading to impaired T
  cells metabolism and their antigen-specific response. The activation of IDO1-dependent
  KP in APC can directly affect the differentiation of naїve CD4+ T cells by cell
  cycle arrest and apoptosis of Th1 cells, inhibition of differentiation of Th17 cells
  while promoting Th2 cells polarization. KYN metabolites, by signaling via the AhR,
  can also direct the conversion of naїve CD4+ T cells to the immunosuppressive phenotype
  of Treg and prevent its reprogramming to effector Th17 cell. Similar effects on
  cells of the adaptive immune system are exerted by IDO1 activation in the Breg,
  which regulates T cell responses via the release of IL-10 and TGF-β, the suppression
  of Th1, Th17 cells, and by converting CD4+T cell into Treg. In summary, the IDO1-dependent
  pathway of TRP degradation may alter Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance and create the
  local milieu, that is dominated by anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, TGF-
  β), contributing by this way to the long-lasting immunotolerance. Abbreviations:
  TRP—tryptophan; IDO1—indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; KYN—kynurenine; KYNs—kynurenines;
  GCN2K—general control nondepressible 2 kinase; mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin;
  APC—antygen presenting cel; Th1—T helper type 1 cell; IL—interleukin; IFN-γ—interferon
