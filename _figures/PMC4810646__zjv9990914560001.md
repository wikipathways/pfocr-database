caption: OAS-RNase L pathway. (Left) Interferon induction and signaling. Viral dsRNA
  is produced during virus replication (1) and sensed by PRRs, such as MDA5 (2), initiating
  a signaling pathway leading to transcription, translation, and secretion of IFN-α/β
  (3). Autocrine and paracrine IFN signaling through the interferon receptor (IFNAR1)
  (4) stimulates the expression of ISGs (5 and 6). (Right) RNase L activation. (7)
  OASs sense viral dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. (8) 2-5A binds to RNase L, inducing
  its dimerization and subsequent activation. (9) RNase L degrades RNA.
