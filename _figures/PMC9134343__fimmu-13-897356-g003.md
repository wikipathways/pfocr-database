caption: '(A) The anti-lung cancer effects: IL-33 can promote the differentiation
  and maturation of DCs through MyD88 pathway, thus increasing the antitumor effect
  of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. It is also able to enhance the secretion of GZmB and
  IFN-γ by CD8+ T cells and NK cells through NF-κB pathway. Notably, IL-33 downregulates
  PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells, and its interaction with TNF-α, which up-regulates
  ST2 expression in NK cells, enhances antitumor effects. (B) The pro-lung cancer
  effects: By up-regulating the expression of GLUT1 on lung cancer cells, IL-33 can
  enhance their glucose uptake and glycolysis, which lead to the proliferation of
  lung cancer cells. IL-33 increases the secretion of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37
  in macrophages. LL-37 cooperates with IL-33 to increase the phosphorylation of p38
  MAPK as well as NF-kB p65 pathways, and augment IL-6 and IL-1b secretion, thus resulting
  in the proliferation of lung cancer cells. IL-33 can increase the frequency of Tregs
  in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and enhance the differentiation and function of
  Tregs by up-regulating the expression of FoxP3, which can lead to immune escape.'
