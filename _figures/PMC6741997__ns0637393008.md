caption: Model of the neuronal death pathway involving Cdks. In this model, mutant
  SOD1, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation can trigger deregulation
  of Cdk5 that subsequently upregulates Cdk4. The activation of nuclear Cdk4 leads
  to the phosphorylation of Rb, promoting its dissociation from E2F-1 with ensuing
  transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. This provokes mitochondrial
  disturbances, caspase activation, and ultimately neurodegeneration. The toxicity
  of nuclear Cdk4 upregulation, Rb phosphorylation, and the ensuing signaling pathway
  can be attenuated by interference of deregulated Cdk5 activity. For instance, this
  may be achieved by overexpressing NF-H, which acts as a phosphorylation sink for
  deregulated Cdk5 activity. Cdk4 can also be activated independently of Cdk5 deregulation.
