caption: The Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Rho is kept in the inactive GDP-bound state
  (yellow/blue complex) by sequestration with Guanine nucleotide Dissociation inhibitors
  (GDIs; green comples) and the activity of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). Rho
  can be activated through Guanine Exchange Factors (GEFs), enabling the exchange
  of GDP for GTP. Rho-GTP (orange/blue complex) can then activate ROCK (blue/red complex)
  by binding to the Rho binding domain. Active ROCK can then phosphorylate multiple
  downstream effectors eliciting changes in actin membrane stabilisation, growth cone
  collapse and increased cell adhesion, which in astrocytes results in glial scar
  formation. Arrows indicate activation events, whereas blunted lines indicate inhibitory
  effects.
