caption: Schematic representation of key regulatory pathways in implicated in gliomagenesis,
  and corresponding inhibitors that have been investigated in GBM. (A) PDGFR, VEGFR,
  EGFR as oncogenic receptors implicated in the angiogenesis axis. (i) Overexpression
  of PDGF and PDGFR in GBM cells collectively lead to increased tumour cell survival,
  growth, and migratory capability. (ii) Abnormal activation of the VEGFR pathway
  is responsible for the development of the characteristic leaky neovasculature found
  in GBM through promoting endothelial cell survival, differentiation, and migration,
  as well as encouraging microvascular formation. (iii) EGFR is commonly overexpressed
  in GBM and is implicated in improving tumour cell survival, growth, and proliferation
  through multiple pathways. (B) STAT3 can be activated by multiple receptors including
  IL-6 receptor, EGF, PDGF and HGF via the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. STAT3 activation
  is modulated by both upstream and downstream regulators. However, STAT3 is often
  upregulated in GBM cells, thus resulting in overexpression of STAT3 target genes,
  leading to gliomagenesis. (C) Overexpression of RTK and deficiency of the negative
  regulator PTEN in GBM cells collectively lead to the hyperactivation of AKT, which
  in turn mediates the activation of downstream kinases that regulate cell proliferation
  and protein synthesis. (D) Healthy cells depend on PARP to repair single-strand
  breaks. Inhibition of PARP-dependent DNA repair results in accumulation of double
  strand-breaks, which induce the activation of homologous recombination as the compensatory
  pathway to repair DNA damage. Oncometabolite D-2-HG blocks the activation of this
  compensatory pathway through induction of BRCAness, hence offering PARP as a synthetic
  lethality target in IDH-mutant GBM cells. Inhibition of all these targets (in red
  boxes) therefore serves as potential therapeutic approaches in treating GBM.

  description: Schematic representation of key regulatory pathways in implicated in
    gliomagenesis, and corresponding inhibitors that have been investigated in GBM.
    (A) PDGFR, VEGFR, EGFR as oncogenic receptors implicated in the angiogenesis axis.
    (i) Overexpression of PDGF and PDGFR in GBM cells collectively lead to increased
    tumour cell survival, growth, and migratory capability. (ii) Abnormal activation
    of the VEGFR pathway is responsible for the development of the characteristic
    leaky neovasculature found in GBM through promoting endothelial cell survival,
    differentiation, and migration, as well as encouraging microvascular formation.
    (iii) EGFR is commonly overexpressed in GBM and is implicated in improving tumour
    cell survival, growth, and proliferation through multiple pathways. (B) STAT3
    can be activated by multiple receptors including IL-6 receptor, EGF, PDGF and
    HGF via the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. STAT3 activation is modulated by both
    upstream and downstream regulators. However, STAT3 is often upregulated in GBM
    cells, thus resulting in overexpression of STAT3 target genes, leading to gliomagenesis.
    (C) Overexpression of RTK and deficiency of the negative regulator PTEN in GBM
    cells collectively lead to the hyperactivation of AKT, which in turn mediates
    the activation of downstream kinases that regulate cell proliferation and protein
    synthesis. (D) Healthy cells depend on PARP to repair single-strand breaks. Inhibition
    of PARP-dependent DNA repair results in accumulation of double strand-breaks,
    which induce the activation of homologous recombination as the compensatory pathway
    to repair DNA damage. Oncometabolite D-2-HG blocks the activation of this compensatory
    pathway through induction of BRCAness, hence offering PARP as a synthetic lethality
    target in IDH-mutant GBM cells. Inhibition of all these targets (in red boxes)
    therefore serves as potential therapeutic approaches in treating GBM.
