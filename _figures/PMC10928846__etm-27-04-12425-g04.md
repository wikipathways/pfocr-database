caption: Mechanism underlying the effects of BCA on the treatment of Perthes disease.
  BCA inhibits endothelial dysfunction induced by IL-6-EMPs via the NFκB pathway,
  and may therefore be considered a potential drug for the treatment of Perthes disease.
  Created with BioRender.com. BCA, biochanin A; EMPs, endothelial microparticles;
  ICAM, intercellular cell adhesion molecule; p, phosphorylated
