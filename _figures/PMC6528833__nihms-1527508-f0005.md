caption: FLT3-ITD signaling leads to genomic instability that can be reduced with
  the use of PARP inhibitors. FLT3-ITD signaling leads to downstream upregulation
  of ligase III (Lig3) and PARP1, key factors in the highly error-prone ALT NHEJ repair
  pathway. In combination with upregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), this leads
  to large genetic aberrations including chromosomal rearrangements and deletions.
  In turn, these changes make these cells more prone to developing genetic alterations
  that may cause disease progression and drug resistance (A). The use of PARP inhibitors
  in these cells can reduce ALT NHEJ and thereby decrease genomic instability, disease
  progression and drug resistance (B).
