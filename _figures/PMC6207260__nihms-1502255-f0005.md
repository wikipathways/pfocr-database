caption: ↓ represents a reduction, ↑ represents an increase, ↔ represents weak or
  conflicting evidence and? Represents a lack of available data for the indicated
  outcome. Black arrows indicate pathway and drug interactions, with arrow points
  indicating induction and ovals indicating inhibition. The yellow box indicates that
  these pathways respond in a similar direction to the interacting pathway indicated
  by the black lines. AICAR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NMN, nicotamide mononucleotide;
  SIRT, sirtuin; STACs, sirtuin activating compounds.
