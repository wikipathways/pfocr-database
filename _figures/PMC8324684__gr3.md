caption: Relationship of liver steatosis with the VLDL secretory pathway. One important
  feature of hepatocytes is the ability to efficiently export excess triglycerides
  and other lipids as VLDL. (A) If the rate of VLDL assembly and secretion is limiting,
  triglycerides are diverted to lipid droplets and the extent of steatosis increases.
  Impairment of VLDL secretion can be caused by naturally occurring mutations in proteins
  pivotal for VLDL production (APOB, MTTP, TM6SF2), by insulin action, lack of the
  major VLDL surface lipid phosphatidylcholine and possibly by reduced polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFA) or by endoplasmic reticulum stress. (B) Clinical studies report
  that VLDL secretion, and in parallel dyslipidemia, increase with progression of
  MAFLD along with liver steatosis. A plateau is reached at the MAFL or the steatohepatitis
  stage, probably because the VLDL secretory capacity has reached a limit. In advanced
  liver disease such as cirrhosis VLDL secretion is reduced again, likely reflecting
  the loss of functional hepatocytes.
