caption: Common oxidant sources signal through a variety of pathways. Schematic indicates
  proposed oxidant targets in red, which dictate the pathways affected. Colocalization
  of the oxidant source and proximate target may provide pathway specificity. In several
  pathways, both proximate targets and intermediate steps are unclear.
