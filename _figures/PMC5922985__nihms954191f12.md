caption: '(a) The ATM model of the p53 signaling pathway []. (b) Connectivity configuration
  for the model. Blocks 1–4 form a negative feedback loop (p53 production→Mdm2mRNA→Mdm2→Mdm2_p53→p53
  degradation) and Block 5–8 comprise a cascade reaction (IR event→damDNA→ATMA→p53
  and Mdm2 phosphorylation) which triggers an oscillation in the loop. Note that the
  rates of Mdm2-dependent p53 degradation (Reaction 4) and Mdm2_P degradation (Reaction
  22) are propagated to the blocks that produce p53tot (Block 1) and Mdm2tot (Block
  4), respectively. Note also that p53 and Mdm2 react with each other and also with
  ATMA, so fan-out configuration is used for Block 2, 7, and 8. (a) Adapted from the
  figure originally published in [C. J. Proctor and D. A. Gray, “Explaining oscillations
  and variability in the p53-Mdm2 system,” BMC Syst. Biol., vol. 2, p. 75, 2008],
