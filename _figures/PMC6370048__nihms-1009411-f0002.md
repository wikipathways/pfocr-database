caption: Downstream effectors and upstream regulatory pathways of RKIP. RKIP is an
  important regulator in a complex web of interactions. While it predominantly acts
  as a metastasis suppressor in the EMT pathways (Notch1, let-7, NF-κB), it also affects
  and is affected by pathways controlling apoptosis and cellular proliferation. (I)
  RKIP is the only physiological inhibitor of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK axis that binds directly
  to Raf-1, BRAF, or MEK (not shown) to prevent signal transduction to ERK and beyond.
  RKIP curtails MAPK-mediated cell proliferation through several mechanisms; for instance,
  it prevents ERK from repressing Aurora B kinase activity, leading to an active spindle
  checkpoint blockade of cell cycle reentry. (II) it inhibits the EMT-inducer Notch1
  and its pro-EMT downstream targets N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail. (III) Alternatively,
  it stabilizes GSK-3β and subsequently upregulates pro-EMT molecules such as Snail,
  Slug, cyclin-D1, and β-catenin. (IV) Among those described, the RKIP/Myc/LIN28/let-7/HMGA2/BACH1
  axis (minimally shown) is systematically identified as a pathway controlling expression
  of a bone metastasis signature (BMS) consisting of OPN, CXCR4, and MMP1. RKIP activates
  let-7, which in turn inhibits HMGA2 and BACH1 from activating the BMS candidates
  just mentioned. (V) Phosphorylation of RKIP by PKC increases the former’s affinity
  for GRK-2, a negative regulator of GPCR signaling. Once bound to RKIP, GRK-2 is
  isolated from GPCRs, allowing enhanced GPCR signaling. (VI) Due to its ubiquity
  in human tissues, RKIP has been shown to downregulate the adhesion molecules ICAM-1
  and VCAM-1 as well as MMPs responsible for mesenchymal transformation in diverse
  cell types. (VII) Transcriptional repression of RKIP occurs through binding of EZH2
  as part of the PRC2 to the RKIP promoter. Post-transcriptional regulation of RKIP
  mRNA is governed by miR-27a and miR-224. (VIII) Metastatic tumor cells often exhibit
  a dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/YY1/PTEN/RKIP loop that drives metastatic transition.
  In the nonmalignant example of the loop, RKIP suppresses NF-κB activity through
  inhibition of IKK. Without RKIP, NF-κB is free to upregulate oncoproteins YY1 and
  Snail. Snail then downregulates total RKIP levels or inhibits PTEN and enhances
  PI3K/Akt pathway activity. (IX) RKIP inhibits STAT3 activation both directly by
  binding to STAT3 monomers and indirectly by preventing c-Src autophosphorylation.
