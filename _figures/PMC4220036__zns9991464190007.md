caption: Proposed mechanism of transnitrosylation of PTEN by SNO-DJ-1. Schema illustrates
  SNO-PTEN formation by transnitrosylation. Pathophysiologically relevant levels of
  NO can S-nitrosylate DJ-1 at Cys106. DJ-1 interacts with the proapoptotic protein
  PTEN, and, when DJ-1 is S-nitrosylated, SNO-DJ-1 acts as an endogenous nitrosylase
  toward PTEN. This transnitrosylation reaction generates SNO-PTEN, resulting in the
  inhibition of PTEN phosphatase activity. Decreased phosphatase activity contributes
  to the survival of neurons (e.g., by relatively increasing neuroprotective phospho-Akt).
  Thus, transnitrosylation of PTEN by SNO-DJ-1 may mediate a neuroprotective NO signaling
  pathway.
