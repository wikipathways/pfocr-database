caption: Potential neurotransmitter pathway affected by genetic 5‐HTT inactivation
  at PND8. Serotonin (5‐HT) is produced in the raphe nucleus and transported in vesicles
  to the axon terminals located in, among others, the prefrontal cortex (PFC). 5‐HT
  can be released from these vesicles into the synaptic space, where it can activate
  subtypes of receptors. 5‐HT2A, encoded by the Htr2a gene, is a Gq coupled 5‐HT receptor
  present on glutamatergic pyramidal cells in deep cortical layers (V and VI) (Vollenweider
  and Kometer 2010). Heterotrimeric G‐protein complexes are made up of alpha, beta
  and gamma (such as Gng3) subunits. RGS proteins, such as Rgs4, are able to deactivate
  G‐protein subunits (Neubig and Siderovski 2002). The most prominent pathway stimulated
  by the 5‐HT2A receptor is the diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate
  (IP3) pathway (IP3‐DAG) (Wischhof and Koch 2015) which activates Protein kinase
  C (encoded by Prkcb). Studies have shown that 5‐HT2A receptor signaling is reduced
  in (adult) 5‐HTT−/− mice (gray dotted line) (Qu et al. 2005; Rioux et al. 1999).
  Upon activation, 5‐HT2A can trigger glutamate (GLU) release from the pyramidal cell
  (Vollenweider and Kometer 2010). GLU is synthesized by the conversion of glutamine
  (GLN) catalyzed by glutaminase (GLS) and packaged into synaptic vesicles by the
  vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs; encoded by, among others, Slc17a7) (Rudy
  et al. 2015). Glutamic acid decarboxylases, encoded by Gad1 and Gad2, catalyze the
  synthesis of gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamate (Fehr et al. 2003). Long
  distance transport of synaptic vesicles, containing synaptic vesicular proteins
  (e.g., synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B encoded by Sv2b (Morgans et al. 2009)),
  occurs by kinesin and dynein (encoded by, among others, Dynll1) in the microtubule‐rich
  axon and vesicles then travel through the actin‐rich cortex at the nerve terminal
  on a myosin motor (Schlager and Hoogenraad 2009). Synapsins (encoded by, among others,
  Syn2) regulate the release of neurotransmitters by preventing vesicles from migrating
  to the presynaptic membrane by binding synaptic vesicles to actin (Bahler et al.
  1990). The SNARE complex, composed of three membrane‐associated proteins (encoded
  by, among others, Vamp2), mediates the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane
  (Waites and Garner 2011). Complexin (encoded by, among others, Cplx3) acts as a
  positive regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and binds selectively to the neuronal
  SNARE complex (Hu et al. 2002). Extracellular GLU can activate a variety of receptors.
  Each receptor can activate its own signal transduction pathway inside the postsynaptic
  neuron. mGlu2 receptors, encoded by the Grm2 gene, are localized in the pre‐ and
  postsynaptic membrane (Gonzalez‐Maeso et al. 2008; Delille et al. 2013; Schoepp
  2001). Activation of presynaptic mGlu2 receptors negatively modulates the release
  of glutamate by providing a feedback that prevents excessive glutamate release (Anwyl
  1999; Scanziani et al. 1997) and regulates the release of other neurotransmitters
  (Cartmell and Schoepp 2000). Postsynaptic mGlu2 receptors can regulate neuronal
  excitability via the modulation of ion channels (Anwyl 1999). mGlu2 is a Gi/o coupled
  receptor that inhibits the adenylate cyclase (AC)—cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) pathway (Schoepp 2001) (presynaptic mGlu2) and can also activate the MAPK
  and PI3K‐AKT pathways (postsynaptic mGlu2) (Wischhof and Koch 2015; Niswender and
  Conn 2010). Studies have shown that mGlu2 can form a heterocomplex with the 5‐HT2A
  receptor (Fribourg et al. 2011; Gonzalez‐Maeso et al. 2008) (gray dotted line).
  mGlu4, encoded by Grm4, is an autoreceptor localized at the active zone of boutons
  which inhibits the AC—cAMP pathway (Corti et al. 2002; Nicoletti et al. 2011). AMPA
  receptor (encoded by, among others, Gria4) activation can result in sodium and calcium
  influx. The intracellular signaling pathways used by AMPA receptors are not fully
  understood. One potential pathway is PI3K‐dependent activation of MAPK (Perkinton
  et al. 1999). NMDA receptor (encoded by, among others, Grin2a) activation results
  in an increase in calcium influx, which in turn activates MAPK signaling‐related
  cascades (Haddad 2005). Glutamate receptor signaling might affect transcription
  of genes involved in synapse formation and neurite outgrowth. For example, NMDA
  receptor signaling can influence netrin 1 (Ntn1) gene expression, which is a diffusible
  protein involved in cell migration and axon guidance and linked to 5‐HT (Bonnin
  et al. 2007; Toriumi et al. 2012). In addition, 5‐HTT (encoded by Slc6a4) and the
  vesicular monoamine transporter (encoded by Slc18a2) are transiently expressed in
  glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in early postnatal development, suggesting that
  5‐HT can be taken up by glutamatergic neurons and can be released upon activation
  (Lebrand et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2015). Several genes involved in vesicular transport
  and downstream signaling pathways shown in this network are downregulated in the
  5‐HTT−/− rats, suggesting reduced synaptic transmission. 5‐HT, 5‐hydroxytryptamine
