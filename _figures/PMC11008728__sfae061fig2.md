caption: Potential mechanisms involved in kidney allograft rejection in the context
  of ICI. (1) Reactivation of alloreactive quiescent T cells by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway. (2) Cross-reactivity between tumoral neoantigens and kidney allograft antigens.
  (3) Systemic inflammation can cause overactivation of the immune system, with off-target
  effects and potential activation of dormant alloreactive T cells. (4) CTLA-4 expressed
  on Tregs interacts with co-stimulatory molecules CD80/86 preventing APCs from effectively
  stimulating effector T cells. CTLA-4 can also directly interact with CD80/86 expressed
  on effector T cells. PD-1 on Treg prevents alloreactive B cells from stimulating
  other T cells and can inhibit directly T effector cells expressing PD-L1. Blocking
  both pathways leads to loss of regulatory T cells function and activation of host
  alloimmune responses.
