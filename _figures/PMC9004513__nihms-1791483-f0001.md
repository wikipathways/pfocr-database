caption: mTORC1 is activated by interacting with Rheb-GTP at the lysosome. Recruitment
  of mTORC1 to the lysosome is mediated by the RagGTPases; heterodimers of Rags recruit
  mTORC1 by binding to the mTORC1 subunit Raptor when RagA/RagB is bound to GTP and
  RagC/RagD is bound to GDP. The GTP/GDP loading status of the Rags is mediated by
  Ragulator and GATOR1, as well as other GAPs and GEFs. Specific sensors for the amino
  acids Methionine (SAMTOR), Leucine (Sestrin2), and Arginine (CASTOR1/2) have been
  identified; when levels of the sensed amino acids are low, these proteins inhibit
  GATOR1 or GATOR2 activity to modulate the GAP activity of GATOR1 towards RagA and
  RagB. Amino acids also stimulate the GEF activity of Ragulator/SLC38A9/v-ATPase
  complex towards RagA/B and the GAP activity of FLCN towards RagC/D. Glucose levels
  are sensed indirectly via DHAP levels, which controls GATOR2 activity via an as-yet
  undescribed mechanism. The GEF activity of Ragulator is modulated by multiple amino
  acids via the v-ATPase and SLC38A9; cholesterol also activates mTORC1 signaling
  via SLC38A9. NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1), the major lysosomal cholesterol transporter,
  interacts with SLC38A9 and inhibits the activation of mTORC1 by cholesterol. Protein-derived
  amino acids stimulate lysosomal mTORC1 activity via a HOPS-dependent pathway that
  has not yet been fully described, but which is antagonized by the RagGTPases. The
  availability of Rheb-GTP is limited by the activity of the TSC complex, which is
  a GAP for Rheb; TSC activity is inhibited by insulin/IGF-1 signaling via AKT, which
  phosphorylates TSC2. Purine nucleotides are sensed via TSC2 as well, inhibiting
  TSC activity, although the precise sensor has not yet been identified. Figure adapted
