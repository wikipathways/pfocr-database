caption: The roles of various key members of the LRP receptor family; LRP4, LRP5,
  LRP6 and LRP8 in bone related traits and bone mass regulation. Gain-of-function
  mutations in LRP5 give rise to high bone mass phenotypes in humans and mice, whereas
  loss-of-function mutations in LRP5 and LRP6 give rise to decreased bone mass. Knockout
  or loss of function mutations of the inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  such as sclerostin, DKK1 and the sFRPs give rise to increased bone mass and overexpression
  of these proteins results in decreased bone mass. Sclerostin inhibition of LRP5/6
  appears to be LRP4 dependent. Loss-of-function mutations in LRP4 lead to increased
  bone mass. Likewise, Dkk1 inhibitory function is mediated through Kremen1/2 and
  loss of either of these binding partners results in increased bone mass. At present
  it is unclear whether LRP8 is inhibited by sclerostin or Dkk1. Recent studies have
  shown that neutralizing antibodies to LRP6 can reduce bone mass. Treatment with
  neutralizing antibodies to sclerostin or Dkk1 as well as small molecule inhibitors
  results in increased bone mass. LRP5/6 and LRP8 appear to have roles in regulating
  osteoblastogenesis and therefore have the potential through this axis to either
  increase or decrease bone mass. Diseases such as Osteoporosis and Osteogenesis Imperfecta
  are envisioned as candidates diseases for treatment with agents that lead to increased
  bone mass, whereas diseases such as Sclerosteosis/Van Buchem's and potentially other
  sclerosing bone diseases are candidates for approaches that lead to decreased bone
  mass. See text for references
