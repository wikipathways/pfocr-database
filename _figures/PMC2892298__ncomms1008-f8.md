caption: Organogenesis starts as pluripotent embryonic stem cells develop into multipotent
  neural and mesenchymal cells. These progenitor cells are important for embryo growth
  and organogenesis through their ability to self-renew and give rise to many different
  cell types. This study demonstrated that SoxC proteins—Sox4, Sox11 and Sox12—have
  a primary role in ensuring the survival of these cells. They directly activate the
  gene for Tead2, a transcriptional mediator of the Hippo signalling pathway that
  is capable of mediating at least some of their cell survival functions. It is likely,
  however, that they also fulfil some of their functions through the activation of
  other genes that remain to be uncovered.
