caption: The biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) in higher plants occurs via an indirect
  pathway (marked with solid, black arrows) and is initiated from the cleavage of
  β-carotene (C40). Initial steps in ABA biosynthesis occur in plastids, while final
  reactions take place in cytosol. In a direct pathway (marked with dashed, black
  arrow), which occurs in some fungi, ABA synthesis starts with the β-carotene precursor
  farnesyl diphosphate (C15). ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase;
  I?, unknown isomerase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; SDR, short-chain
  alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase; AAO, abscisic aldehyde oxidase.
