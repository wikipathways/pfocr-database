caption: The histone H3K4 methyltransferase, Set1, as part of COMPASS, is recruited
  to genes through interaction with the Polymerase-associated factor (Paf1) complex
  (1) (; ). H3K4 trimethylation is found at the start sites of the transcription of
  active genes, as well as “poised” genes with stalled RNA Pol II (). Upon release
  of RNA Pol II by phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain (CTD) at serine 2 (P-Ser2),
  numerous factors associate with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain including the
  histone H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 () (2). Set2 can be recruited through interactions
  with both the CTD of Pol II and the Paf1 complex (; ).
