caption: Molecular cascades of fear memory stabilization in the amygdala. A postsynaptic
  increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, mediated through Ca2+ influx via NMDA
  receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and through release from intracellular
  stores upon activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), triggers a
  plethora of signalling steps. Three major, mutually interconnected signalling routes
  involve Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII), the protein kinase
  (PK) family of enzymes, and tyrosine kinase (TK) pathways. Signalling cascades can
  reach the nucleus to induce macromolecular synthesis, and they can control translational
  processes. Consequently, they can act on cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules to
  re-organize and stabilize synaptic structures, or regulate AMPA receptor trafficking
  to the synapse. At intermediate steps, protein kinase signals converge on the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways, including the extracellular
  regulated kinases (ERK). RAS, RAF, and MEK kinases transduce intra- and extracellular
  signals, mediated for instance through tyrosin receptor kinases (Trk), to the MAPK/ERK
  pathway. Scaffolding proteins dictate specificity of activation as well as entry
  in the nucleus. MAPKs translocated into the nucleus phosphorylate transcription
  factors, such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Actin rearrangement
  is under the control of RhoGTPases, whose activation from a GDP- to a GTP-bound
  form is controlled via Ca2+ or kinase pathways, including tyrosine kinases (TK)
  and SRC kinases. RhoGTPases control activity of Rho-associated kinases (ROCK), a
  key molecule for regulation of the cytosekeleton.

  description: Molecular cascades of fear memory stabilization in the amygdala. A

    Signalling cascades can reach the nucleus to induce macromolecular synthesis,
