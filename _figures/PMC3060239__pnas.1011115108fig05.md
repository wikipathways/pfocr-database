caption: Model of the RBP-ROH/STRA6/JAK/STAT pathway. Binding of RBP-ROH to the extracellular
  moiety of STRA6 triggers tyrosine phosphorylation within an SH2 domain-binding motif
  in the receptor's cytosolic domain. Phosphorylated STRA6 recruits and activates
  JAK2, which, in turn, phosphorylates STAT5. Activated STAT5 translocates to the
  nucleus to regulate the expression of target genes, including SOCS3, which inhibits
  insulin signaling, and PPARγ, which enhances lipid accumulation. The model of STRA6
  (GeneID 64220RBP) was generated using software http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui.
  The 3D structure of holo-RBP (GenBank accession no. DAA14765.1) was solved as described
  in ref. .
