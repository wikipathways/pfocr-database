caption: Intracellular trafficking of EAAT3. Newly synthesized EAAT3 moves via the
  biosynthetic pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi compartments
  to the plasma membrane (exocytic route, green arrows). From the cell surface, EAAT3
  is constitutively endocytosed and directed through early endosomes (EE) and recycling
  endosomes (RE) back to the plasma membrane (recycling route, red arrows). Alternatively,
  internalized EAAT3 may be directed from EE to late endosomes (LE) and further to
  lysosomes (Lys) for proteolytic degradation (blue arrows). Proteins involved in
  promoting (+) or inhibiting (−) EAAT3 trafficking are indicated at the respective
  translocation steps.
