caption: Simply comparing and contrasting the expression patterns of perturbed genes
  was inadequate for deciphering the MAPK pathway response dynamics. Clearly, the
  uniqueness of the MAPK pathway responses suggested that very different invasion/evasion
  mechanisms have evolved for each pathogen. More sophisticated methods are needed
  to identify potential points of host response disruptions. This is done by interrogating
  the trained DBN model for the MAPK Pathway for genes that exceed threshold Bayesian
  z-scores>|2.24| (“mechanistic genes”) and gene-gene network relationships (arcs).
  For example,  shows the visualization of the MAPK pathway network. The network can
  be employed to visualize several key features that would otherwise be difficult
  to discern by looking at spreadsheet lists of genes. For example the state of gene
  modulation is distinguished by color-coded nodes. The state of upstream and downstream
  genes can be easily identified. Various threshold levels can be modified to identify
  significantly perturbed genes (annotated with orange circles, ). The strength of
  correlation between gene pairs is indicated by the color and thickness of the arcs
  connecting the genes.
