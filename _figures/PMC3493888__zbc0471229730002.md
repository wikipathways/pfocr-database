caption: Biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acids in M. tuberculosis and site of action
  of anti-TB drugs. The C48–C54 meromycolate chain is biosynthesized by FAS-II through
  the processive addition of multiple malonate units onto C16–C26 precursors generated
  by FAS-I. The initial substrates of FAS-II are thus medium length keto-acyl-ACP
  resulting from the condensation by the M. tuberculosis FabH protein of the acyl-CoA
  products of FAS-I with malonyl-ACP. After reduction by the β-keto-acyl-ACP reductase
  MabA, dehydration by the (3R)-hydroxyacyl dehydratases HadAB and HadBC, and reduction
  by the enoyl-CoA reductase InhA, either the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase KasA or KasB
  catalyzes the condensation of the resulting product with malonyl-ACP units, thereby
  initiating the next round of elongation. The products of FAS-II may undergo further
  elongation and functional modifications of the meromycolic acid chain, catalyzed
  in part by AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, prior to the condensation of the
  activated α-branch with the meromycolic acid chain to yield the full-size MA ().
  INH and ethionamide (ETH) are inhibitors of InhA; thiolactomycin (THL) is an inhibitor
  of KasA. ISO and TAC inhibit the dehydration step.
