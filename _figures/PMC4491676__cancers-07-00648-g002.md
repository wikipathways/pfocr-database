caption: PP2A as a tumour suppressor in signaling pathways. The PP2A holoenzyme containing
  B55γ, negatively regulates the MAP kinase pathway through inhibition of c-SRC [,,].
  PP2A holoenzymes containing B56β and B56γ directly dephosphorylate ERK to negatively
  regulate the MAP kinase pathway []. PP2A negatively regulates Akt activity through
  dephosphorylation of Akt at Thr 308 to regulate cell survival []. As well as functioning
  as a phosphatase, PP2A also controls cell migration by acting as a regulator of
  growth factor and adhesion receptor assembly through its interaction with RACK1
  during cell migration [].
