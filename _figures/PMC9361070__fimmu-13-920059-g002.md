caption: Mechanisms of iron metabolism in ferroptosis. Fe3+ can couple to transferrin
  and enter the intercellular milieu mediated by TfR1. Transferrin can be recycled
  and exported extracellularly and blocked by HSPB1. Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by DMT1
  in endosomes, and Fe2+ can be transported into the cytoplasm. Fe2+ can be released
  from ferritin through NCOA4-mediated ferritin phagocytosis, and part of Fe2+ can
  be exported outside the cell and oxidized by FPN. In addition, DOX can also induce
  ferroptosis. Cardiac output of DOX activates the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, and Nrf2 further
  activates the downstream protein Hmox1 and prompts it to oxidize heme and release
  iron, leading to ferroptosis.
