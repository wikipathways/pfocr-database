caption: POMC processing pathway and constitutive-like secretion. The pathways leading
  from POMC to 18-kDa fragment-NH2 and JP-NH2 are illustrated. Cleavages by prohormone
  convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) proceed in the order indicated (). The first cleavage generates
  ABI and β-lipotropin (data not shown). ABI is cleaved to produce 18-kDa fragment
  and ACTH (data not shown); 18-kDa fragment can be amidated by PAM only after carboxypeptidase
  E (CPE) removes the C-terminal basic amino acids, generating 18-kDa fragment Gly.
  Pulse-chase metabolic labeling studies demonstrated that about half of the 18-kDa
  fragment is amidated before further cleavage (); cleavage by PC1/3 produces 16-kDa
  fragment and JP-NH2 or JP-Gly, which is then amidated. Antibodies specific for the
  γ3MSH region of POMC and for the amidated C terminus shared by 18-kDa fragment-NH2
  and JP-NH2 were validated previously (). Red symbol, N-linked glycan. These post-translational
  modifications occur as newly synthesized POMC travels through the secretory pathway.
  POMC cleavage begins in the TGN, and processing continues as immature secretory
  granules form mature secretory granules over a period of ∼2 h. Secretion of the
  final products of POMC processing (16-kDa fragment, JP-NH2, ACTH, and β-lipotropin)
  can be stimulated by application of secretagogues like BaCl2. Secretion of several
  biosynthetic intermediates (ABI, 18-kDa fragment) occurs in the absence of a stimulus
  and is referred to as constitutive-like secretion.
