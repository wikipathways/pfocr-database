caption: NF-κB signal transduction pathway. NF-κB heterodimer between p65 and p50/52
  proteins is located in the cytosol complexed with the inhibitory protein IκBα. Through
  the intermediacy of integral membrane receptors, a variety of extracellular signals
  (like TNFα or growth factor BDNF) can activate the enzyme IκB kinase (IKK, consisting
  of Ikkα, β, and γ) via TAK1 or PI3K/Akt, respectively. IKK, in turn, phosphorylates
  the IκBα protein, which results in dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB and eventual
  degradation by the proteosome. The activated NF-κB is then translocated into the
  nucleus where it binds to specific sequences of DNA called response elements and
  initiates the gene transcription.
