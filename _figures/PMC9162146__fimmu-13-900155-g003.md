caption: Exosomal ncRNAs-mediated immune regulation. (1) Macrophages-derived exosomal
  miR-501-3p facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis. Hypoxia can upregulate miR-301a-3p
  expression by modulating HIF-1a and HIF-2a, thus inhibiting the PTEN/PI3K-γ signaling
  pathway and promoting tumor invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT). (2) Tumor-derived exosomal miR-9 and miR-181a consequently affect proliferation
  of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to promote tumorigenesis. Also, these
  MDSCs inhibit the activation of T cells. (3) Antigens can be encapsulated in exosomes
  and delivered to dendritic cells (DCs). Then, DCs activate T cells to initiate the
  immune response. Tumor-derived exosomes can inhibit the differentiation of MDSCs
  into DCs. DCs-derived exosomes facilitate the release of IFN-γ, which subsequently
  inhibits tumorigenesis. (4) Tumor-derived exosomal miR-21 and miR-29a can target
  TLRs to provoke pro-tumoral inflammation, rendering tumor growth and metastasis.
  Tumor-derived exosomal miR-203, targeting TLR4 in DC cells, downregulated the expression
  of TLR4 and related cytokines, such as PD-L1, TGF-β, and VEGF. (5) Tumor-derived
  exosomal miR-20a-5p and miR-891a inhibit Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation while
  increasing the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). (6) CAF-derived exosomal
  lncH19 can be transferred into tumor cells to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling via
  serving as a ceRNA for miR-141. (7) Tumor-derived exosomal circUHRF1 can elevate
  the expression of TIM-3 on the surface of NKs, thus inhibiting the cytotoxicity
  of NKs.
