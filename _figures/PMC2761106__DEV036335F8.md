caption: Model of BMP7 signaling in the NZ. BMP7 preferentially functions  through
  the JNK signaling pathway to promote proliferation in the nephron  progenitor compartment.
  The SMAD machinery is silent at the transcriptional  level in cap mesenchyme, but
  becomes increasingly activated as cells progress  to the renal vesicle stage and
  beyond.
