caption: The role of remimazolam in inflammatory. LPS induces macrophage secretion
  of cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, which could directly lead to inflammatory
  response. As a result, remimazolam not only had effect on the activation of NF-κB,
  p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and PI3K signal pathway at 15 min after LPS treatment but also
  regulate Rab5a related TLR4 expression at cell surface in response to LPS at later
  time.
