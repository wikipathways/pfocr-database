caption: PADK has a positive and selective effect on lysosomal CatB which likely explains
  its beneficial effect on AD-type protein accumulation pathology. E64d elicits low-level
  positive CatB modulation which may be part of its therapeutic action. In addition,
  evidence indicates that E64d potently blocks pathogenic, calpain-mediated cytoskeletal
  damage, and the compound is known to block a number of lysosomal enzymes. The singular
  action on calpain or the dual effect on calpain and the lysosomal pathway may explain
  E64d’s protective results.
