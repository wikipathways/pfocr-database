caption: Pathogenetic cascade of HAPC. Genetic predisposition governs the hypoxic
  response trajectory, eliciting three divergent downstream pathways that collectively
  drive pathologic erythrocyte population dynamics. This cascade culminates in imbalanced
  erythropoiesis characterized by accelerated erythroid production and attenuated
  apoptosis, with hyperproliferation serving as the core driver of erythrocytosis.
  Mechanistically, bone marrow erythroid precursors exhibit dysregulated proliferation-apoptosis
  equilibrium, mediated through synergistic activation of pro-survival signaling (e.g.,
  EPO/HIF axis) and suppression of apoptotic executors (e.g., BCL-2 family modulation).
  The self-reinforcing cycle of erythroid expansion establishes the pathologic foundation
  of HAPC progression
