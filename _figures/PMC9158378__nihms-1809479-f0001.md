caption: Canonical Shh signaling consists of SHH production, secretion, receptor binding,
  signal transduction, and transcription factor activation. Mutations have been identified
  in humans diagnosed with HPE in each of the proteins included in the schematic except
  for Smoothened (SMO). Furthermore, environmental chemicals found in commonly consumed
  plant products have been shown to alter SMO and GLI activity, and ethanol and Vitamin
  D3 are purported to inhibit Shh signaling at multiple steps along the pathway. Emphasis
  here has been placed on environmental chemicals with a high probability for human
  exposure rather than providing a comprehensive list of Shh pathway antagonists.
