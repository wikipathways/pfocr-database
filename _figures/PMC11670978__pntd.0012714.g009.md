caption: HnAg was collected after grinding the H. nana with a handheld homogenizer
  and injecting them intraperitoneally into mice with UC. HnAg can activate the AhR/IL-22
  signaling pathway, which leads to increased differentiation of ISCs and tight junctions
  in the intestinal tract, and thus alleviates the intestinal damage caused by DSS
