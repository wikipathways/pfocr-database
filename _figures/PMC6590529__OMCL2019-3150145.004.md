caption: Two degradation pathways of GSH. One way occurs outside the cell where GSH
  is degraded by γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) which is expressed only on the outer
  surface of particular cell; the other newly discovered pathway occurs in the cytoplasm
  where GSH is degraded through ChaC1 and ChaC2.
