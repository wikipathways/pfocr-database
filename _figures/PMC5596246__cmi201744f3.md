caption: Caspases control the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Cytosolic DNA from virus
  or self-DNA from mitochondria or the nucleus could activate cyclic GMP–AMP synthase
  cGAS, which catalyzes the production of cGAMP in the presence of ATP and GTP. cGAMP
  binds and activates the ER-localized adapter protein STING, which then recruits
  and activates TBK1. This is followed by the phosphorylation and activation of the
  transcription factors IRF3, NF-κB and STAT6, leading to I-IFN, proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokine production. The apoptotic caspases-9, -3 and -7 could inhibit cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3-mediated
  IFNα/β production, while the inflammatory caspase-1 could cleave cGAS to control
  innate immunity during inflammasome activation. cGAS, cGAMP/cAMP synthase; STING,
  stimulator of IFN genes; TBK1, Tank-binding kinase 1; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor
  3; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  6; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA.
