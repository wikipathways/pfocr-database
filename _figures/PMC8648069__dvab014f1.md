caption: Potential impacts of developmental MeHg exposures on dopamine neurotransmission.
  The developing brain of fetus is susceptible to environmental exposure to neurotoxins.
  The primary pathway for dopamine synthesis involves several enzymes including TH
  and DDC. For the dopamine neurotransmission, MeHg exposure can alter the epigenetic
  regulation of the TH gene and potentiate the effect of dopamine neurotransmission
  agonists such as amphetamine []. TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; L-DOPA, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine;
  DDC, DOPA decarboxylase; VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter 2; DAT, dopamine
  transporter
