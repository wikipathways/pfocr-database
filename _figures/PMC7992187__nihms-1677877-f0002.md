caption: (A) In the Drosophila testis, Hub cells secrete the ligand Unpaired (Upd),
  which activates Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
  (JAK-STAT) signaling in the GSCs and CySCs. In the CySCs, JAK-STAT activation is
  sufficient for stem cell self-renewal, while the GSCs are maintained by signaling
  from both the hub cells and CySCs. Activated pStat92E in the CySCs activates expression
  of zn finger homeodomain 1 (zfh1) and chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis
  (chinmo), which are important for CySC self-renewal and identity. Activation of
  Zfh1 turns on expression of the BMP ligands glass bottom boat (gbb) and decapentaplegic
  (dpp) in the CySCs, which activate BMP signaling in the GSCs, important for GSC
  self-renewal and maintenance. Activation of BMP signaling in the GSCs by the hub
  cells and CySCs also inhibits expression of bag of marbles (bam) to prevent differentiation.
  Activation of pStat92E in the GSCs promotes GSC adhesion to the hub. Activation
  of pStat92E in the CySCs also activates expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling
  at 36E (socs36E), a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway. In addition, EGF
  from the GSCs to the CySCs regulates their abilities to encapsulate germ cells and
  GSC divisions. (B) In the Drosophila ovary, JAK-STAT acts in the cap cells to activate
  BMP ligand, dpp. Dpp/Gbb activates BMP signaling in the GSCs, resulting in phosphorylation
  of Mothers against dpp (pMad) and activated transcription of dads against dpp (dad).
  pMad and its partner Medea translocate to nucleus and repress transcription of bam,
  inhibiting GSC differentiation (). This repression is relieved once the GSC daughter
  cell leaves the niche. Brain tumor (Brat) reduces BMP responsiveness in the CB.
  EGF from the CB activates EGF signaling in the neighboring escort cells, where it
  represses the transcription of dally (). This ensures that BMP ligands Dpp/Gbb are
  restricted to the cap cells and BMP activation only occurs in the GSCs. Adapted
  from .
