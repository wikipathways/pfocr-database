caption: Proposed mechanistic model for sex steroid-driven regulation of Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa virulence and persistence. (1) The polarity of the various sex steroid
  hormones influences their ability to diffuse across the P. aeruginosa (lipid bilayer)
  membrane with their degree of impact on membrane dynamics dependent on the diffusion
  rate. More polar molecules such as estriol (with lower hydrophobicity) diffuse more
  slowly and therefore are more likely to interact with lipopolysaccharides and proteins
  in the bacterial cell envelope compared to less polar molecules such as testosterone
  or ethinylestradiol (with higher hydrophobicity), which diffuse more rapidly through
  the bacterial membrane. (2) Interactions between polar sex steroids, membrane proteins,
  and lipopolysaccharides are sensed by surface signaling systems, including the muc
  operon (mucA/B), leading to (3) activation of the alginate biosynthetic pathway
  through the muc operon, (4) upregulation of downstream genes involved in surface
  sensing (pili, c-di-GMP) and quorum sensing (pqs, las, rhl, vfr), and (5) biofilm
  formation (polysaccharides, alginates). (6) The increased secretion of quorum sensing
  autoinducer (AI) molecules coupled to increased membrane protein production alters
  membrane composition and fluidity and promotes “lipid raft” formation and membrane
  stress-inducing (7) OMV release that dampens host inflammatory responses and further
  promotes bacterial persistence and tissue damage. (8) In chronic P. aeruginosa infection
  with “hormone-responsive” strains, the constant pressure exerted by sex steroids,
  particularly on the bacterial envelope, promotes adaptive change, which aims to
  protect the bacterium by creating defensive barriers such as alginates that surround
  bacterial cells, leading to mucoid conversion with bacterial persistence and poorer
  clinical outcomes. EE2, ethinylestradiol; T, testosterone; E3, estriol; TSDG.HCl,
  17β-N,N-dimethylglycinate testosterone hydrochloride; OMV, outer membrane vesicle;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides.
