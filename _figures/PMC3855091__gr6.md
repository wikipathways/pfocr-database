caption: A model of Foxa2 deletion leading to premature aging and age-onset obesity.
  (A) Cis-regulatory modules regulated by Foxa2. Once Stat5b is activated, phosphorylated
  (P), and translocates to the nucleus, together with Foxa2 the factor turns on genes
  important in synthesis, transport, and detoxification of bile acids (left panel).
  A bile acid (BA) ligand bind to FXR, activating the nuclear receptor, and FXR in
  synergy with Foxa2 induces targets essential for xenobiotic detoxification (right
  panel). (B) Deletion of Foxa2 leads to a premature aging phenotype. Accumulation
  of bile acids in Foxa2 mutants leads to activation of inflammatory gene expression
  modulated by Nf-κb, which is hyperactivated in mouse models of premature aging.
  Hepatic gene expression in young Foxa2-deficient mice resembles that of older males
  due to reduced growth hormone levels and Stat5b signaling. Decreased expression
  of FXR-dependent detoxification genes leads to reduced stress resistance in a long-lived
  mouse model. These features of Foxa2 mutants lead to premature aging. (C) Deletion
  of Foxa2 in the liver leads to age-onset obesity. Young Foxa2 mutants accumulate
  bile acids that induce cytokine signaling and low-grade inflammation mediated by
  activated Irf3, Stat3, and NF-κB. In addition, Foxa2 co-regulates many genes with
  Stat5b, a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory factor. Together, activation of
  Stat3 and reduced Stat5b signaling lead to low-grade hepatic inflammation in young
  Foxa2 mutants. Foxa2 and its targets, two of which are direct, normally antagonize
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Reduced expression of repressors
  of mTOR and presence of inflammatory cytokines contribute to activation of mTOR
  in livers of older Foxa2-deficient mice. Increased mTOR activity and reduced Stat5b
  signaling lead to induction of Srebp1-c and de novo lipogenesis in the liver, resulting
  in age-onset obesity.
