caption: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is restricted to the basal surface
  of the airway epithelial cells. This figure serves to highlight how the integrity
  of the apicoadherens junction can regulate epithelial cell signaling. Under conditions
  of low paracellular permeability created by the cytoskeleton and cell-cell contacts,
  there is segregation of EGF ligand and receptor, thereby inhibiting constant cellular
  signaling. In conditions of increased paracellular permeability, EGF can bind its
  receptor and activate its pathway, where phosphorylated ERK serves as readout of
  EGFR activation. Thus the epithelial barrier can modulate epithelial signaling pathways.
