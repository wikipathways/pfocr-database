caption: The anti-inflammatory mechanism of IL-10. IL-10 activates JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway, which further activates SCOS3 and anti-inflammatory process. It also polarizes
  Th1/Th17 to Th2/Treg and M1 to M2, which have anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover,
  it promotes the switches of IgG1 to IgG3 and IgA1 to IgA2, which have better mucosal
  protective effect. IL-10 also inhibits phagocytosis. IL-10 is reduced in obesity
  and this may contribute to the proinflammatory state and possible lung injury.
