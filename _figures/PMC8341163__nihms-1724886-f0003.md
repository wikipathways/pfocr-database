caption: 'A) SSBR is initiated by detection of the Cas-induced nick by the XRCC1/PARP1
  complex. Then, either direct ligation, SP-SSBR or LP-SSBR can be involved to re-seal
  the nick. Newly synthesized strands are colored in red. B) ncMMR is initiated by
  detection of the X*•Z mismatch by MutSα. Subsequently, there are two potential pathways
  that can process the Cas-induced nick: the EXO1-dependent and -independent pathways.
  (1) EXO1 is directly recruited and activated at the site of the nick by MutSα. It
  digests the nicked strand in a 5’-to-3’direction across from the mismatch, leading
  to formation of a gap across from the X*-containing strand, which becomes coated
  by RPA. DNA replication factors, including RFC, PCNA and Pol δ/ε, are then recruited
  to fill in the gap, using the X*-containing strand as a template. (2) In the EXO1-independent
  pathway, the DNA replication complex is directed recruited to the nick to carry
  out strand replacement synthesis. The displaced 5’-flap is then digested by FEN1
  or DNA2. In both pathways, the final ligation is performed by LIG1, with the X*•Z
  mismatch being turned into a X*•Q base-pair intermediate.'
