caption: MTDH/AEG-1 promotes tumor progression through the integration of multiple
  signaling pathways. Oncogenic Ha-Ras increases MTDH/AEG-1 expression through the
  activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β,
  and subsequently enhances the stabilization and binding of c-Myc to the MTDH/AEG-1
  promoter. MTDH/AEG-1 can activate AKT, NFκB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways to promote
  proliferation, survival and invasion. Activation of NFκB signaling is in part mediated
  by the direct interaction of MTDH/AEG-1 with p65 and CBP, a general transcriptional
  co-activator. MTDH/AEG-1 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through increasing
  the activity of MAPK kinases ERK and p38, which phosphorylates GSK3β and stabilized
  β-catenin. Furthermore, MTDH/AEG-1 increases the expression of LEF-1, a transcriptional
  cofactor for β-catenin. The pro-metastasis function of MTDH/AEG-1 is mediated by
  the interaction of the lung-homing domain of MTDH/AEG-1 with an unknown receptor
  in endothelial cells. The broad spectrum chemoresistance function of MTDH/AEG-1
  is mediated by a number of downstream genes that promote the resistance to multiple
  chemotherapeutic agents. Proteins with direct interactions with MTDH/AEG1 are shown
  in green. Dotted line indicates pathways yet to be fully validated or characterized.
