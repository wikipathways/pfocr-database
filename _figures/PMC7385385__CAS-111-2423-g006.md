caption: Schematic diagram of integrin β8‐induced bladder cancer cell proliferation
  and drug resistance. The cellular surface integrin β8 receptor could induce Y‐box
  binding protein 1 (YBX1) activation through phosphorylation. Phosphorylated (p‐)YBX1
  upregulates c‐Myc to promote tumor cell proliferation. Simultaneously, activation
  of nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB)/B‐cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) signaling through YBX1 causes
  resistance to chemotherapy in bladder cancer, resulting in poor clinical outcome.
