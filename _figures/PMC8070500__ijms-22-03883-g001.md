caption: The JNK pathway is conserved between mammals and flies. Upon internal and
  external stress stimuli, ligands (ex. TNF/Egr) activate transmembrane receptors
  (ex. TNFαR/ Grnd) and initiate a cellular response based on a MAPK cascade phosphorylation.
  In mammals, different ligands can trigger the signal path; while in Drosophila,
  Eiger (Egr) is the TNF ligand that predominantly initiates the stress response via
  TNF receptors (Grindewal, Grnd; or Wengen, Wng). In mammals, there is MAPK path
  gene redundancy that is shown in this diagram compared with flies. MAPKs are encoded
  by multiple genes in mammals, whereas in Drosophila, one single gene is described
  for each enzyme. The cellular response converges in JNK/Bsk phosphorylation, which
  triggers the expression of transcription factors as Jun/Jra and Fos/Jay, known as
  an AP-1/dAP-1 complex. Finally, AP1/dAP-1 modulates the transcriptional program
  of genes involved in a variety of biological activities. This pathway can be activated
  at other steps indicated with dotted lines in the diagram.
