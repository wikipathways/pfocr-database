caption: Branched biosynthetic pathway for the formation of flaviolin (above) and
  HPQ melanin (below). The names of the starter units and the intermediates are indicated
  next to their chemical structure. The enzymes involved in the pathway in Streptomyces
  toxytricini (in red letters) or in Streptomyces coelicolor (in green letters) are
  shown. Note that RppB is proposed to be involved in more than one biosynthetic step.
