caption: Model for the control of oocyte meiotic maturation in C. elegans. MSP signaling
  for oocyte meiotic maturation requires Gαs–ACY-4–PKA activity in the gonadal sheath
  cells. PDE-6 and TWK-1 may function in the gonadal sheath cells as negative regulators
  of meiotic maturation. The gonadal sheath cells inhibit meiotic maturation in part
  via gap-junctional communication involving the innexins INX-8 and INX-9 in the gonadal
  sheath cells (T. Starich and D. Greenstein, unpublished data) and INX-14 and INX-22
  in oocytes (). SACY-1 is a strong negative regulator of meiotic maturation that
  functions in the germ line upstream of, or in parallel to, the positive regulators
  OMA-1 and OMA-2. CoREST-like complex has a function in the germ line that is needed
  for the dependence of meiotic maturation on the Gαs–ACY-4–PKA sheath cell pathway.
  For illustrative purposes, TWK-1 and sheath cell MSP binding activity are displayed
  in a localized fashion, though this is unlikely to be the case (Govidan et al. 2009;
  this work).
