caption: MOR activation pathway leading to ICa inhibition in the VANs. The use of
  PTX showed that the ICa inhibition by MOR activation is Gαi/o dependent. Use of
  paired pulses showed that the VD signaling mechanism does not significantly participate
  in the ICa inhibition. The use of forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, IBMX, H89, and okadaic acid
  indicate that the ICa inhibition (LVA and HVA) by MOR activation is mediated by
  the cAMP pathway. Involving the Gαi/o inhibition, AC inhibition, decreased of cAMP
  levels, decreased of PKA activity and decreased of PKA-dependent phosphorylation
  of calcium channels. In the scheme, arrow-endings indicate activation and the line-endings
  indicate inhibition. The names and lines in red indicate the drugs used. AC, Adenylyl
  cyclase; GP, G Protein; PDE, Phosphodiesterase; VD, Voltage dependent signaling
  mechanism; VGCC, Voltage gated calcium channels; VI, Voltage independent signaling
  mechanism.
