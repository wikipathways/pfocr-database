caption: Transcriptional gene switches. (A) Prokaryotic regulator proteins are fused
  to transcriptional regulator proteins and bind to DNA operator sequences to control
  the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner. (B) Combining prokaryotic
  regulator proteins with ligand- or light-induced dimerization systems (DSs) enables
  the signal-dependent recruitment of transcriptional regulator proteins. (C) Cell-surface-located
  G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) sense extracellular signals and trigger signal
  transduction via signaling pathways to control cellular processes such as gene transcription
  in target cells. (D) An engineered diguanylate cyclase (DGCL) synthesizes the second
  messenger c-di-GMP in a red-light-responsive manner, triggering a downstream signaling
  pathway and leading to the transcriptional activation of target genes. DBD, DNA-binding
  domain; SD, sensory domain; TR, transcriptional regulator; IPA, interaction partner
  A; IPB, interaction partner B; TF, transcription factor; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.
