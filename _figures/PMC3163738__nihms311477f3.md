caption: 'IFN-α (type-I IFN) and IFN-λ (type-III IFN) signal through distinct receptor
  complexes, but activate the same intracellular signaling pathway. IFN-α binds to
  a cell surface receptor complex composed two trans-membrane proteins: IFNAR1 and
  IFNAR2. IFN-λ binds to a distinct receptor complex composed of the IFN-λR1 (IL-28RA)
  and IL-10R2 chains. The binding of IFN-α or IFN-λ to their cognate receptors induces
  a common signaling cascade that results in the activation of STAT1 and STAT2 which
  together with IRF-9 (p48) form ISGF3 transcription factor complexes. The newly formed
  ISGF3 complexes then translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus where they bind
  to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes
  (ISGs) such as MX1, OAS1 and IRF7. The proteins encoded by these genes in turn mediate
  the antiviral activity of the type-I and type-III IFNs.'
