caption: GRP78/BiP, an ER chaperone, is closely associated with three sensors of the
  UPR, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, inhibiting them under normal physiological conditions.
  Upon ER stress or misfolded protein accumulation, GRP78 dissociates from all these
  UPR transducers and permits stress sensors to activate downstream signaling. A different
  signal transduction system activates each pathway. The most conserved signal transducer,
  IRE1 (which contains a serine/threonine kinase and an RNase domain on its cytosolic
  side), undergoes homodimerization and autophosphorylation, and its activation mediates
  the activation of its RNase domain to produce spliced XBP1 mRNA, which is the active
  isoform of XBP1 that is translocated to the nucleus to increase UPR target genes,
  including chaperones and ERAD. The RNase domain of IRE1 also regulates the RIDD
  (regulated IRE1-dependent decay) pathway, where IRE1 degrades ER membrane-localized
  mRNAs through its RNase activity, resulting in a reduction in the amount of protein
  imported into the ER lumen. Similarly, during ER stress, the cytosolic domain of
  IRE1 interacts with TRAF2 and activates the downstream kinase ASK1, enhancing the
  activated JNK pathway and triggering apoptosis. Similarly, activation of PERK increases
  the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the translation protein eIF2, which
  attenuates protein translation to reduce ER protein overload, while paradoxically
  upregulating ATF4 mRNA, which targets the activation of proapoptotic CHOP and other
  UPR target genes. Upon sensing ER stress, a third UPR transducer, ATF6 alpha, is
  translocated to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes cleavage by site-1 and site-2
  proteases. The cleaved fragments are then translocated to the nucleus and activate
  the transcriptional target genes of ATF6, including chaperones and XBP1. Adaptive
  response failure may not resolve ER stress and may upregulate UPR signaling to induce
  apoptosis.
