caption: (A) ME reaction. ME catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C4 dicarboxylic
  acid malate to the C3 acid pyruvate and CO2. Depending on the type of ME, NAD or
  NADP is used. A metal ion cofactor is essential for the reaction. (B) The PEP-pyruvate-OAA
  node and its connection with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and acetate activation.
  ME (SfcA and/or MaeB) in combination with PEP synthetase (PpsA) allows the formation
  of PEP, the direct precursor for gluconeogenesis, from TCA intermediates. Alternatively,
  PCK (PckA) can also direct C4 intermediates to PEP. The conversion of PEP to pyruvate,
  an essential step in glycolysis, is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PykA or PykF).
  Also shown is the activation of acetate, which involves two possible pathways. One
  is catalyzed by the AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), and an alternative
  pathway uses acetate kinase (AcKA) in combination with PTA.
