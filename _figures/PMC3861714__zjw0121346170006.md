caption: Diagrammatic representation of the BZR1-co-purified proteins identified in
  this study and their binding positions. 14–3-3, PP2A, and BIN2 (in green) are known
  BZR1-binding proteins. CYSB, HDA19, and MKK5 (in red) were shown by in vitro and
  in vivo experiments to be new BZR1-binding proteins. CAMTA5, UBP12, CYP59, MAPK4,
  RH8, RD21A, and RD21B (in yellow) were shown by in vitro experiments to be BZR1-interacting
  proteins. BSK1 and SYTA (in pink) interact indirectly with BZR1. The BZR1-binding
  regions for the interacting proteins are given above the bar.
