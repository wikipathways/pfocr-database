caption: The Top2b-regulated gene, Bbs7, is an essential protein for BBSome-mediated
  ciliary trafficking. Pathway based on Chandra et al., 2022 [17], Hsu et al., 2021
  [18], Milacic et al., 2024 [14], Li et al., 2017 [11], and Weinbrecht et al., 2017
  [16]. Bbs7 mutations cause shortened outer segments and cone–rod dystrophy. Red
  arrows denote downregulation, while red crosses in this figure denote the absence
  of promoter binding and inhibition. The upward blue arrow represents upregulation
