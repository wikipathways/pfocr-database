caption: Protein-protein interaction map of Notch transcription modifiers. The Notch
  interaction network was generated by connecting the Notch transcription modifiers
  identified in the genome-wide study with protein-protein interaction links (e.g.
  two-hybrid and Co-IP data from the DroID database []). This resulting network included
  126 genes (nodes) with 237 physical interactions (edges). Genetic interactions were
  not used for the network and the resulting map was drawn using Cytoscape []. A.
  These physical links are shown in relation to components of the activated Notch
  pathway (N and Su(H)) and the Notch repressor complex (Su(H), H, CtBP and gro),
  shown in red. B. Expanded view of the chromatin factors identified in this study
  that form the central core of the interaction network (blue). C. Ttk is a known
  downstream target of Notch signaling. The transcriptional and physical interaction
  data suggests that this factor may have a positive feedback role in Notch induced
  transcription. D. Factors with roles in mRNA processing (yellow). The interaction
  network suggests that these proteins may be working though the chromatin machinery
  to modulate Notch transcription. E. The interaction network suggests the possibility
  of a similar chromatin based mechanism for the class of ribosomal proteins known
  as Minute. The network file is included with the supplemental data (Additional file
  ) and can be viewed in detail using the open source Cytoscape viewer http://www.cytoscape.org.
