caption: '(A) Viable microbes that comprise the commensal microbiota of the anterior
  midgut produce acetate and shed peptidoglycan. These two products are necessary
  for activation of the IMD pathway within DH31/Tk-expressing enteroendocrine cells.
  In the anterior midgut, the membrane-associated receptor PGRP-LC is the principal
  sensor of peptidoglycan. IMD pathway signaling in these cells results in expression
  of AMPs, Tk, and DH31. The ultimate result is control of the microbiota through
  antimicrobial action, intestinal contractions, and inhibition of lipid synthesis
  within enterocytes. (B) In antibiotic-treated, germ-free, or IMD pathway mutant
  flies, the IMD pathway is not activated, and AMPs, Tk, and DH31 are not made. The
  absence of Tk expression leads to increased numbers of lipid droplets within enterocytes
  presumably due to de-repression of lipid synthesis. In addition, decreased levels
  of DH31 result in decreased intestinal contractions. (C) In the uninfected fly,
  there is little signaling through the IMD pathway of the posterior midgut, and expression
  of IMD pathway-regulated genes is repressed by the transcription factor Caudal.
  Because Tk expression in the posterior midgut is not under control of the IMD pathway,
  Tk is expressed and homeostatic levels of lipids are synthesized in enterocytes.
  (D) Pathogens such as V. cholerae gain access to the posterior midgut. In this case,
  peptidoglycan activates the IMD pathway, and AMP synthesis is increased. Because
  V. cholerae activates degradation of phospholipids, lipid droplets coalesce, leading
  to larger lipid droplets in spite of an overall decrease in TAG stores. Abbreviations:
  ABX, antibiotic; TCT, tracheal cytotoxin; TKR, tachykinin receptor; VM, visceral
  muscle; EC, enterocyte; EE, enteroendocrine; TAG, triacylglycerol.'
