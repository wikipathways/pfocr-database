caption: A. In the absence of Wnt signals, cytosolic β-catenin is degraded by a β-catenin
  destruction complex composed of Axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase 1α (CK1α). Both GSK3β and CK1α can
  phosphorylate β-catenin, which triggers ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  of β-catenin by proteasomes. B. The Wnt signaling pathway is activated by binding
  of Wnt ligands, to Frizzled and LRP5/6 at the cell surface. LRP5/6 is activated
  by phosphorylation, which recruits the β-catenin destruction complex to the plasma
  membrane. The cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 2 (Caprin2)
  facilitates LRP5/6 phosphorylation by GSK3β and enhances the interaction between
  Axin and the cytoplasmic tail of LRP5/6, which promotes the sequestration of the
  β-catenin destruction complex. The cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin rises and translocates
  into the nucleus, where it binds to the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors,
  displacing co-repressors Groucho and HDAC and acts as a co-activator to stimulate
  the transcription of anti-apoptotic, Bcl-2. C. In the C. pneumoniae AR39-infected
  cells, signalosomes are formed around the inclusion possibly through the chlamydial
  Inc protein Cpn1027 interacting with the β-catenin destruction complex, composed
  of Caprin2, Axin, GSK3β and CKIα resulting in the activation of the Wnt signaling
  transduction pathway in the absence of extracellular stimulation of Wnt. This leads
  to an increase in the cytoplasmic pool of β-catenin, nuclear β-catenin and membrane-associated
  β-catenin. The β-catenin-transactivated anti-apoptosis genes may promote the survival
  of the C. pneumoniae AR39-infected cells, hence the survival of AR39.
