caption: Schematic figure of the underlying mechanisms of mesopore size regulating
  clot‐immune responses and the strategies to develop clot‐immune regulatory biomaterials.
  A) Mesopore size below 9 nm has little impact on fibrin formation and the following
  biological activities of cell. Mesopore size above 9 nm induces thinner fibers and
  smaller contact area with cells, which reduces inflammatory response via pathway
  of the cell adhesion‐cytoskeleton assembly‐inflammatory response. B) The development
  strategy diagram of clot‐immune regulatory materials by tuning fibrin network parameters
  including fiber thickness, fibrin porosity, density, mechanical strength, and degradation
  pattern.
