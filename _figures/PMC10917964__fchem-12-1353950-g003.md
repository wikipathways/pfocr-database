caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the promotion of bone formation by incorporating
  Sr2+ on the surface of titanium-based materials. The incorporation of Sr2+ has a
  dual effect: firstly, it promotes the adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts
  by activating the classical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This activation increases
  the expression of proteins and growth factors such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
  bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), insulin-like growth
  factor (IGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
  stimulating osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, ultimately
  promoting bone formation. Secondly, Sr2+ regulates osteoclast differentiation through
  the RANK/RANKL axis, inhibiting the expression of osteoclast-associated genes like
  tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9), and
  activated T-nuclear factor c1 (NFATc1), thereby suppressing bone resorption driven
  by osteoclasts'
