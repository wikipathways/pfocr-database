caption: RHO-1 acts via three distinct pathways to increase synaptic strength at the
  C. elegans neuromuscular junction. We propose an addition to the competing G-protein
  pathway model in C. elegans motor neurons (; ; ). To this pathway we added RHO-1
  as a negative regulator of DGK-1. Activation of RHO-1 causes a loss of DGK-1 activity,
  leading to a stabilization of diacylglycerol (DAG) levels at sites of release. Presynaptic
  DAG recruits UNC-13 to release sites, and the accumulation of UNC-13 at release
  sites correlates with increases in ACh release. We further propose that RHO-1 acts
  by a second presynaptic pathway that is independent of DGK-1 inhibition and of DAG-binding
  to UNC-13. Finally, our data suggest that RHO-1 expression at a site other than
  the motor neuron potentiates the response of the muscle to ACh.
