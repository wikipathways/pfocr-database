caption: A model of the effects of cigarette smoke on the small airway protein profile.
  A Cigarette smoke consists of gaseous and particulate matter (tar) phase and the
  ROS in cigarette smoke induce oxidative stress. B Particulate matter causes an increase
  in ferritin levels in RTLF and affects fibrinogen and plasma kallikrein levels.
  Plasma kallikrein plays a role in the contact activation, coagulation and the alternative
  complement pathway. C Oxidative stress causes cell damage or apoptosis. Levels of
  TCTP, which protects cells from the apoptotic cell death, were increased in current
  smokers. Protein S, which is involved in the inhibition of coagulation and clearance
  of apoptotic cells was decreased in current smokers. In a complex with C4BP, protein
  S also prevents excessive complement activation and inflammation on the surface
  of apoptotic cells. sRAGE inhibits the induction of pro-inflammatory responses caused
  by the activation of RAGE signalling and decreased levels of sRAGE may contribute
  to inflammation. Upregulation of pro-inflammatory proteins and cytokines occurs
  due to oxidative stress and FSTL3 acts by neutralizing the activity of these proteins
  and induces the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, ROS cause
  damage to proteins, lipids and DNA and impair protein folding. Increased expression
  of heat shock proteins in the lungs exposed to cigarette smoke promotes the repair
  of misfolded proteins. Decreased levels of SPOCK2, which provides protection against
  influenza virus infection, may contribute to inflammation by making the epithelial
  cells more susceptible to viral infections. D Changes in the forementioned proteins
  all contribute to promoting inflammation and our findings suggest an important role
  of the complement system in this process. A decrease in CD55 and factors H and I,
  important inhibitors of complement activation, was observed in female current smokers,
  which could lead to excessive complement activation resulting in the depletion of
  C3 and C5, and this could be an important initiating step in the pathogenesis of
  small airway inflammation
