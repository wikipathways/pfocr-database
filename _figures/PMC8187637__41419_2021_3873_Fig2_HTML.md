caption: (1) Formation of stress granules (SGs) can be triggered by diverse cell damaging
  conditions, including viral infection, oxidative stress, heat shock, nutrient deprivation,
  ultraviolet radiation or proteotoxic stress. Particular stress conditions are detected
  by specific kinases—protein kinase R (PKR), haem-regulated inhibitor (HRI), general
  control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2) and pancreatic eIF2α kinase (PEF)—that then become
  activated and (2) phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit
  alpha (eIF2α). (3) eIF2α is involved in the formation of translation initiation
  complexes and, when phosphorylated, leads to dissociation of these complexes and
  to translational arrest. (4) mRNAs, 40S ribosomal subunits, and proteins involved
  in translation start to accumulate and to assemble together, along with other proteins
  that are recruited to the forming SGs. This primary aggregation process produces
  a stable SG core. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that constitute SG cores include ras
  GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T-cell intracellular antigen-1
  (TIA-1), tristetraprolin (TTP) and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).
  (5) A secondary aggregation step resulting from additional, albeit weaker, intermolecular
  interactions originate the shell of the SGs. RBPs recruited in this step include
  heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A0 (hnRNPA0), hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1 and RNA-binding
  protein EWS (EWSR1). (6) When stress conditions abate, SGs are either disassembled
  by molecular chaperons or (7) are cleared by autophagy. (8) Disassembly allows for
  a rapid recovery of protein synthesis.
