caption: A, Death ligands activate opposing signals leading to apoptosis via a caspase
  pathway, or to alternative pathways via kinases and NF-κB. Alternative pathways
  include both survival and phenotypes such as inflammation, cell migration, and differentiation,
  and are mediated at least in part via transcription of target genes. B–C, Different
  ligands lead to sequential recruitment of distinct signaling complexes to receptor
  tails, with the primary complex promoting cell survival/inflammation in the case
  of TNF but apoptosis in the case of TRAIL/FasL. B, TNF leads to the formation of
  a primary signaling complex (complex I; bold blue arrow) that activates the NF-κB
  pathway, and induces cell death via the delayed formation of a secondary complex
  (complex II; dashed red arrow) that becomes active only when NF-κB signaling is
  inhibited. Apoptosis, in turn, negatively regulates the NF-κB pathway through cleavage
  of complex I proteins such as RIP1. When apoptosis is also inhibited, necroptosis
  may ensue through formation of an alternative secondary complex (IIb; not shown).
  C, TRAIL and Fas agonists primarily activate apoptotic DISCs (bold red arrow), but
  also activate NF-κB and kinase signaling through formation of secondary or alternative
  DISC structures (dashed blue arrow). In some cases NF-κB signaling in response to
  TRAIL/FasL is weak relative to apoptotic signaling, or becomes dominant only in
  cases when apoptotic signaling is dampened or blocked. Necroptosis may ensue when
  both apoptosis and survival signaling are inhibited in certain settings (not shown).
  D, Summary of factors affecting apoptotic vs. non-apoptotic DISC formation and signaling
  in response to TRAIL and FasL. Receptor clustering, which is controlled by ligand
  concentration, membrane vs. soluble ligand presentation, receptor localization in
  lipid rafts, and receptor post-translational modifications, reaches a threshold
  of activation that promotes pro-apoptotic DISC assembly, caspase-8 (C8) activation,
  and cell death (left). In contrast, sub-threshold receptor clustering leads to reduced
  formation of pro-apoptotic DISC structures and/or formation of anti-apoptotic DISCs
  (right). Stimulation strength and extent of receptor clustering can influence subsequent
  DISC structure and components, which are also regulated by the availability of different
  DISC factors. Some or all of these factors may impact signaling choices in different
  contexts and may vary with regards to TRAIL vs. FasL signaling. In some cases, cells
  may fail to die due to insufficient apoptotic signaling even in the absence of additional
  survival pathway activation.
