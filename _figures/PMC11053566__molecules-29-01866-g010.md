caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of action of eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactones on
  the TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. Structures of alantolactone, alantolactone
  derivatives, and eudesmane derivatives are presented. TNF-R1 is cleaved to its soluble
  forms by TACE and released into the culture medium. Upon binding to TNF-α, TNF-R1
  recruits TRADD, RIPK1, and TRAF2 to form the membrane-proximal complex, which activates
  IκB kinase β by phosphorylating serines 177 and 181 in the activation loop. In the
  cytoplasm, phosphorylated IκBα is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome.
  Upon dissociation from IκBα, NF-κB subunits, including RelA, translocate to the
  nucleus and bind to the κB sites of target genes, initiating their transcription.
  Based on the present and previous studies, the mechanisms of action of eudesmane-type
  sesquiterpene lactones on the TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling pathway are proposed
  as follows: (1) Alantolactone promotes the TACE-dependent shedding of TNF-R1, thereby
  down-regulating the expression of cell-surface TNF-R1 (this study). (2) Alantolactone
  inhibits IκB kinase β by interacting with the ATP-binding site [29]. (3) Three alantolactone
  derivatives inhibit RelA binding to DNA, but not its nuclear translocation [30].
  (4) Eudesmane derivatives 3, 4, and 7 promote the ectodomain shedding of TNF-R1
  and thereby down-regulate the expression of cell-surface TNF-R1 (this study). (5)
  Eudesmane derivative 1 inhibits RelA translocation to the nucleus [54]'
