caption: Key signals mediating progenitor fate decisions during hepatogenesis. (A)
  Activation of Nodal signaling in the embryonic epiblast (Ep) lineage initiates mesendoderm
  (ME) formation. In Xenopus and zebrafish, maternal signals activate this pathway.
  In mice, Nodal, BMP4 and WNT3 act in a reinforcing loop to activate Nodal and induce
  ME. Subsequently, high levels of Nodal signaling establish the endoderm regulatory
  network leading to the segregation of, and commitment to, definitive endoderm (DE),
  while FGF and BMP drive mesoderm (M) formation by antagonizing Nodal signaling.
  (B) The graded activity of Wnt, FGF and BMP signaling patterns the endoderm along
  the AP axis to generate posterior foregut precursors (PFG) with hepato-pancreatic
  potential that can be distinguished from anterior foregut [AFG; deriving lung (L)
  and thyroid (T)] and midgut-hindgut [MG-HG; deriving intestine (I)] progenitors.
  P represents pancreatic progenitors. (C) FGF-MAPK, BMP and Wnt signaling positively
  regulate hepatic specification to generate hepatoblasts (Hb), although the role
  of Wnt at this stage of liver development has not been demonstrated in mammals (indicated
  by dashed box). (D) Hepatoblast differentiation into cholangiocytes (Ch) and hepatocytes
  (H), and the final maturation of these cells, is regulated by a wide array of signaling
  pathways that display complex cross-regulation. These pathways also influence the
  3D structural organization of the liver and define its zonal characteristics. The
  corresponding developmental stages are indicated beneath the scheme.
