caption: 'Intracellular signal transduction pathways that have been proposed to be
  involved in macrolide immunomodulation. There are three major pathways that are
  influenced by macrolides. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are receptors for many
  polypeptide growth factors and cytokines. RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) stimulate MEKK, and this activates the MAPK cascade. MAPK phosphorylates
  and activates transcription factors inducing proinflammatory genes (). Macrolides
  inhibit MAPK activation, in particular, ERK1/2 activation. TLRs recognize bacterial
  molecules. For example, in response to LPS stimulation, TLR4 and adaptor molecules
  (not shown) activate the IRAK family and TAK1. TAK1 then stimulates two distinct
  pathways, the IKK complex and the MAPK pathway. The latter leads to the induction
  of AP-1, while the former activates NF-κB through the degradation of IκB proteins
  and the subsequent translocation of NF-κB (). G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-
  or RTK-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) produces inositol triphosphate
  (IP3). IP3 is a ligand for the intracellular IP3R channel of the endoplasmic reticulum''s
  internal Ca2+ stores. Activation of PLC also leads to the production of diacylglycerol
  (DAG), which in turn activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin signaling
  are then activated (). Macrolides inhibit intracellular Ca2+ increase. Abbreviations:
  AP-1, activator protein 1; CaMK, calmodulin kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; GFR, cytokine receptor/growth factor receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor;
  IKK, IκB kinase; IP3R, inositol triphosphate receptor; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; TAK1, transforming growth factor-activated
  protein kinase 1; TLR, Toll-like receptor. Blue arrows, major pathways influenced
  by macrolides; dashed arrows, subpathways or cross-talk pathways; red lines with
  “ML,” inhibition by macrolides; white bent arrow, cell response.'
