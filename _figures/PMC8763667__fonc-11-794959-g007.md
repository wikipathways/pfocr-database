caption: Schematic depiction of the role of Gli2 in cisplatin (DDP) resistance in
  ovarian cancer. Under normal circumstances, the Hh signaling pathway is inhibited
  and therefore, Gli2 cannot bind to the downstream target genes. This maintains DDP
  sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells and cell proliferation is inhibited. When the
  Hh signaling pathway is abnormally activated, Gli2 is overexpressed, enters the
  nucleus in the activated form of Gli2A and directly binds to the downstream target
  gene MDR1. This promotes DDP resistance in ovarian cancer cells, thereby significantly
  enhancing cell proliferation.
