caption: 'IL-6 Signaling (Classical and Trans): IL-6 signaling leads to both anti-inflammatory
  and inflammatory cascades by classical and trans-signaling pathways. Classical IL-6
  signaling is anti-inflammatory through IL-6 binding to the transmembrane cell surface
  receptor. IL-6 trans-signaling is thought to be pro-inflammatory pathway. In this
  state, IL-6/IL-6R complex bind to the gp130 on cell surface. The both of classical
  and trans-signaling through IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex activates cellular pathways
  by JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK pathways.'
