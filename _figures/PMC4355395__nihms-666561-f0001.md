caption: The Aβ precursor protein (APP) is processed in one of two main pathways that
  yield either Aβ peptides or non-amyloidogenic products. If APP is sequentially cleaved
  by the α-secretase, and then, the γ-secretase, then nonamyloidogenic products form.
  However, if APP is cleaved by β-secretase and then γ-secretase, then Aβ is produced.
  As Aβ peptides continue to be produced, they form low-n oligomers, fibrils and eventually
  plaques. It is believed that soluble low-n oligomers produce the neuronal and cytotoxic
  injury in Alzheimer's disease.
