caption: 'Alterations of expression levels of genes associated with flavonoid pathway
  in leaves of A. mongolicus under low temperature stress. The expression level of
  genes (FPKM value) is represented by a heatmap, where red represents high expression
  and blue represents low expression. Abbreviations: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR),
  flavone synthase (FNS), chalcone synthase (CHS), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL),
  4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase
  (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and isoflavone synthase
  (IFS)'
