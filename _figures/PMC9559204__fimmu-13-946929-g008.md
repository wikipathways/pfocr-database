caption: The proposed mechanism of action of AcpM in Mtb-infected macrophages. AcpM
  promotes the expression of miR-155, which targets SHIP1 to activate the Akt/mTOR
  pathway. The activated Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibits TFEB nuclear translocation
  and reduces the expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes, which is likely to
  induce antimicrobial defense in macrophages. AcpM also improves intracellular mycobacterial
  survival by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion.
