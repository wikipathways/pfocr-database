caption: Three potential pathways currently exist and function in CRPC that may confer
  increased levels of androgen biosynthesis within the tumor through the sequential
  actions of steroidogenic enzymes that are normally active in the testes and adrenal
  glands. Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by the action of STAR and CYP11A1.
  In the front-door (canonical or classical) pathway (greyish green), characterized
  by the necessity of testosterone (T) as an essential precursor that generate DHT,
  pregnenolone is converted to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by the sequential hydroxylase
  and lyase activity of CYP17A1. DHEA (from intrinsic or adrenal) is then acted on
  by HSD3B to yield androstenedione or by HSD17B3 (or AKR1C3) to yield androstenediol,
  which are subsequently converted to T, followed by its 5α-reduction to dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT) by 5α-reductases (SRD5As). On the other hand, the backdoor pathways refer
  to use of distinct substrates and enzymatic reactions to synthesize DHT bypassing
  T as intermediate. In the primary backdoor pathway (pink), the progesterone intermediates
  are 5α- and 3α-reduced by SRD5As and AKR1C2 before the lyase activity of CYP17A1,
  forming the androsterone and then to androstanediol by HSD17Bs (or AKR1C3) to generate
  DHT. In the secondary backdoor (5α-Adione) pathway (yellow), androstenedione as
  produced in the classical pathway is converted to 5α-androstenedione (5α-Adione)
  by SRD5As instead of conversion to T, and then to DHT by HSD17Bs (or AKR1C3). The
  necessary steroidogenic enzymes (gene names) catalyzing different steps of androgen
  biosynthesis are colour-coded across the three pathways. (STAR = steroidogenic acute
  regulatory protein; CYP11A1 = cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme; CYP17A1 = steroid
  17α-monooxygenase; AKR1C3 = aldo-keto reductase 1C3; HSD17Bs = 17B-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenases; HSD3Bs = 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases; SRD5As = steroid 5α-reductase;
  AKR1C2 = aldo-keto reductase 1C2.).
