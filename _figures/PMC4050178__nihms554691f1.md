caption: 'Brief Overview of DNA Damage Repair: Three common types of DNA damage are
  depicted in this image as well as an summary of the pathways/proteins that are activated
  in response to each type of damage. A. A double strand break DNA break (DSB) most
  often results in the activation, by phosphorylation (indicated in this figure by
  a circled p), of the PI3 kinase ATM. Multiple pathways are downstream of ATM including
  homology dependent DSB repair (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), the Fanconi
  Anemia pathway (FANC), as well as the p53 signaling pathway. B. In response to intrastrand
  crosslinks (crosslink), ATR and its interacting partner ATRIP become activated and
  phosphorylated leading to the induction of several downstream pathways. The activated
  ATR/ATRIP complex induces the Fanconi Anemia repair and Nucleotide Excision Repair
  (NER) pathways, as well as the p53 signaling pathway. C. Finally, a single strand
  DNA break (SSB) causes the activation of both PARP1 and the MRN (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1)
  complex and ultimately together with XRCC1, DNA Ligase III as well as multiple other
  repair proteins fixes the lesion.'
