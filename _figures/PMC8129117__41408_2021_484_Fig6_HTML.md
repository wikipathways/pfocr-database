caption: Data presented in this study demonstrate that CLL cells contain elevated
  levels of H2O2 with significantly reduced O2− levels compared to normal B-cells.
  This is primarily due to the presence of highly active mitochondrial SOD2 enzyme
  in CLL cells converting O2− into H2O2 more rapidly. Overexpression of SIRT3 in CLL
  cells deacetylates SOD2 and likely maintains its constitutive enzymatic activity.
  Moreover, we have also detected reduced expression of catalase in CLL cells causing
  H2O2-accumulation. Although we have identified two distinct CpG-Islands (I and II)
  for methylation in the human catalase promoter, our results suggest that it is the
  Island-I, which primarily regulates catalase levels in CLL cells. Indeed, we have
  detected variable degrees of methylation in CpG-Island-I of the catalase promoter
  only in CLL cells and not in normal B-cells and that, catalase expression is reduced
  in CLL cells both at mRNA and protein levels. While released from mitochondria,
  H2O2 may activate the AXL/FGFR/AKT/ERK signaling axis and/or the BCR pathway, independent
  of ligand, and maintain constitutive activation levels of these cell survival pathways
  through a positive feedforward loop. For example, activation of AKT/mTOR pathway
  leads to increase of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial metabolic activities and
  thus, generation of ROS. Of note, we found that ROS generation or BCR activation
  induces SIRT3 expression in CLL cells. Therefore, one potential therapeutic intervention
  can be to increase ROS-scavenging capacity using antioxidants, thereby abrogating
  ROS signaling and suppressing tumor growth in combination with current CLL therapies.
