caption: An example of a pathway showing omics data pop-ups. Pathways can be displayed
  at varying levels of detail, and this pathway’s display depicts an intermediate
  level of detail including enzymes, EC numbers and genes, but no chemical structures.
  Notice the green arrows at the top of the pathway, which provide hyperlinks to related
  upstream pathways. After an omics dataset has been uploaded, the user can easily
  add data pop-ups to the pathway diagram displaying the omics data for genes or metabolites.
  The user can select from heat map, bar graph or plot representation. Multiple time
  points are supported.
