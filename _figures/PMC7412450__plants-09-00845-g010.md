  leaves. Lipid groups in bold type were altered significantly under the moderate
  heat stress conditions of Path 2 of the main experiment (). Lipid groups underlined

  Reactions involved in oxidation of galactolipids. The most well-characterized process
  involves formation of OPDA (or dnOPDA) through a lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase,
  allene oxide cyclase, and oxophytodienic acid reductase. This conversion of 18:3
  to OPDA (or 16:3 to dnOPDA) was demonstrated to occur while the fatty acid is esterified
  to the galactolipid []. The processes forming other oxidized galactolipids during
  heat stress in Arabidopsis leaves are less well-characterized, but they are likely
  to include the non-enzymatic formation of phytoprostanes [], as well as other enzymatic
  pathways. “b”: Acylation of MGDG on the 6-position of the galactose ring with a
  fatty acid coming from DGDG or a second MGDG, catalyzed by AGAP1 []. “c”: Processive
  galactosylation of MGDG, catalyzed by the galactolipid galactosyltransferase SFR2,
  to form polygalactolipids, such as TrGDG and TeGDG, and DAG [,]. “d”: Possible formation
  of DAG from galactolipids by an unknown lipase. This pathway could contribute 16:3
  as 18:3/16:3 DAG to the PA, PC, and TAG pools. “e”: Fatty acids can be hydrolyzed
  from MGDG by acylhydrolases, such as HEAT-SENSITIVE LIPASE, which cleaves the fatty
  acid (typically 18:3) in the 1-position of MGDG []. “f”: MGMG or DGMG could be hydrolyzed
  to release fatty acids, but the identity of the gene product catalyzing this reaction
  is not known. “g” and “h”: The acyl editing pathway for incorporation into and removal
  of fatty acids from PC. “g” represents LPCAT, which transfers a fatty acid (after
  activation to acylCoA) to LPC to form PC [], whereas “h” represents an acylhydrolase,
  acting on PC, resulting in LPC and a fatty acid, or perhaps a reverse LPCAT reaction,
  resulting in LPC and fatty acyl CoA [,]. The acyl editing cycle can bring new fatty
  acids into PC. Note that an LPC:LPC transacylase (LPC + LPC to PC + glycerophosphocholine)
  that could contribute to PC formation via acyl editing has been identified in safflower
  seeds [,]. “i”: DAG and PC can be interconverted, although when heating stress is
  severe, PC levels drop while DAG levels rise. PC can be hydrolyzed by a phospholipase
  C to form DAG, whereas the enzyme that synthesizes PC from DAG, CTP-choline:DAG
  phosphocholine transferase, can also catalyze the reverse reaction [,]. “j” and
  “k”: DAG can also be formed from PC via a phospholipase D, possibly by PLDδ [],
  followed by a PA phosphatase. “l”: TAG is formed during heating by transfer of a
  fatty acyl chain from PC to DAG, as catalyzed by PDAT1 []. “m”: Hydrolysis of sterol
