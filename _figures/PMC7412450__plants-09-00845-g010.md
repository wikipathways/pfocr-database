  leaves. Lipid groups in bold type were altered significantly under the moderate
  heat stress conditions of Path 2 of the main experiment (). Lipid groups underlined
  were changed under severe stress (). The green area represents the chloroplast and
  its lipids. Lipid groups in red type are increased, those in blue are decreased,
  and those in black were not measured. The letters “a” to “o” indicate reactions.
  Dashed lines indicate processes that are less well understood, or less clearly involved
  in producing the observed lipid changes, in comparison to the solid lines. “a”:
  Reactions involved in oxidation of galactolipids. The most well-characterized process
  involves formation of OPDA (or dnOPDA) through a lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase,
  allene oxide cyclase, and oxophytodienic acid reductase. This conversion of 18:3
  to OPDA (or 16:3 to dnOPDA) was demonstrated to occur while the fatty acid is esterified
  to the galactolipid []. The processes forming other oxidized galactolipids during
  heat stress in Arabidopsis leaves are less well-characterized, but they are likely
  to include the non-enzymatic formation of phytoprostanes [], as well as other enzymatic
  pathways. “b”: Acylation of MGDG on the 6-position of the galactose ring with a
  fatty acid coming from DGDG or a second MGDG, catalyzed by AGAP1 []. “c”: Processive
  galactosylation of MGDG, catalyzed by the galactolipid galactosyltransferase SFR2,
  to form polygalactolipids, such as TrGDG and TeGDG, and DAG [,]. “d”: Possible formation
  of DAG from galactolipids by an unknown lipase. This pathway could contribute 16:3
  as 18:3/16:3 DAG to the PA, PC, and TAG pools. “e”: Fatty acids can be hydrolyzed
  from MGDG by acylhydrolases, such as HEAT-SENSITIVE LIPASE, which cleaves the fatty
  acid (typically 18:3) in the 1-position of MGDG []. “f”: MGMG or DGMG could be hydrolyzed
  to release fatty acids, but the identity of the gene product catalyzing this reaction
  is not known. “g” and “h”: The acyl editing pathway for incorporation into and removal
  of fatty acids from PC. “g” represents LPCAT, which transfers a fatty acid (after
  activation to acylCoA) to LPC to form PC [], whereas “h” represents an acylhydrolase,
  acting on PC, resulting in LPC and a fatty acid, or perhaps a reverse LPCAT reaction,
  resulting in LPC and fatty acyl CoA [,]. The acyl editing cycle can bring new fatty
  acids into PC. Note that an LPC:LPC transacylase (LPC + LPC to PC + glycerophosphocholine)
  that could contribute to PC formation via acyl editing has been identified in safflower
  seeds [,]. “i”: DAG and PC can be interconverted, although when heating stress is
  severe, PC levels drop while DAG levels rise. PC can be hydrolyzed by a phospholipase
  C to form DAG, whereas the enzyme that synthesizes PC from DAG, CTP-choline:DAG
  phosphocholine transferase, can also catalyze the reverse reaction [,]. “j” and
  “k”: DAG can also be formed from PC via a phospholipase D, possibly by PLDδ [],
  followed by a PA phosphatase. “l”: TAG is formed during heating by transfer of a
  fatty acyl chain from PC to DAG, as catalyzed by PDAT1 []. “m”: Hydrolysis of sterol
  esters to free sterols and fatty acids. Although sterol ester levels drop during
  heating, the levels of sterol esters in Arabidopsis are low, so this is a minor
  source of fatty acids and free sterols. “n”: Glucosylation of sterols by transfer
  of glucose from UDP-glucose by UGT80B1 and UGT80A2, which account for 85–90% of
  the SG formed [,]. “o”: Acylation of SGs, from an unknown acyl donor, to form ASGs,
