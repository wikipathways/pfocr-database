caption: PD-1:PD-L1 mechanisms between T-cells and tumor cells. (A) Loss of phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) in tumor cells induces the Phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)—Akt
  pathway with consecutive overexpression of PD-L1 (); (B) once PD-L1 binds to PD-1,
  the resulting inhibition influences tumor surveillance such as Fas-mediated apoptosis
  (). By co-activation of PD-1 concomitant to TCR in T-cells, the phosphorylation
  of the SHP-2 domain results in a down-regulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. This step
  alters the mTOR complex, which regulates T cellular differentiation (); (C) upon
  immune checkpoint inhibition, either with PD-L1-mAb (Atezolizumab) or PD-1-mAbs
  (Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab), T-cell differentiation is switched to CD8+ T effector
  (T eff) or T memory (T mem) cells, inducing apoptosis by completing the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) of the tumor cells ().
