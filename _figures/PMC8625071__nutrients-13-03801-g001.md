caption: Schematic diagram of apoptotic mechanisms of various natural products against
  pancreatic cancer. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is regulated primarily by anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 inhibits release of mitochondrial cytochrome c.
  Cytochrome c which is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane forms the apoptosome
  complex in the cytosol with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, leading to caspase-9 activation.
  Caspase-9 then activates effector caspases, resulting in some cleavages of cellular
  proteins and finally cell death by apoptosis. Several natural products such as 8-Chrysoeriol,
  Elemene, EEIHL, Moringa aqueous leaf extract, Piperlongumine, TFAE, PS, SSBE, F1,
  F35, DMC, SN, MGDG, sugiol, Crocetinic acid, Coix seed emulsion, Hydroxychavicol,
  and Eucalyptus microcorys down-regulated Bcl-2. Dicatenarin, Skyrin, H3, DMC, MGDG,
  Rottlerin, S. chinensis polyphenol-rich extract induced cytochrome c release to
  the cytosol. Some drugs affected on caspase-3, 8, and 9 straight without going through
  the process. Meanwhile, MAPKs signaling pathway, stimulated by ROS, could also inhibit
  anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In addition to MAPKs, several processes triggered
  by ROS act directly or indirectly on apoptosis.
