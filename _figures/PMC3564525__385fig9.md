caption: A schematic diagram depicting the mechanism of how the Tor1 signaling and
  HOG MAPK pathway integrate to sustain hyphal elongation. Rapamycin reduces Tor1
  activity, which in turn represses the basal activity of Hog1 via two tyrosine phosphatases,
  Ptp2 and Ptp3. Inactive Hog1 fails to keep the repressor Sko1 on the promoter of
  BRG1, allowing the expression of Brg1 and hyphal elongation. Black lines represent
  active regulatory relationships; gray lines represent relationships that are inactive.

  by lowering Hog1 basal activity.
