caption: 'Keratinocyte-derived EVs modulate immune cells and promote inflammation
  in psoriasis. EVs released from keratinocytes treated with recombinant IL-17A (rIL-17A)
  and IL-23 (rIL-23) exhibit elevated levels of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) mRNAs,
  such as human β-defensin 2 (hBD2) and S100A12 [83]. Long-term IL-17A exposure further
  enhances β-defensin 2 expression and increases mRNA levels of neutrophil chemoattractants
  within EVs [82]. EVs from psoriasis-related, cytokine-treated keratinocytes can
  induce neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in neutrophils [83]. Keratinocyte-derived
  EVs enriched with leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) promote M1 macrophage polarization
  via the TGFβR1 signaling pathway, leading to upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes
  [81]. EVs from inflamed keratinocytes transfer miR-381-3p to CD4+ T cells, promoting
  Th1 and Th17 polarization and thereby contributing to psoriasis progression [74].
