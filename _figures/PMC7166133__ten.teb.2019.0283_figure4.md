caption: 'The PHD2-VHL signaling cascade: an opportunity to regulate the HIF pathway.
  In response to molecular oxygen (O2), FIH and PHD2 (in the presence of Fe2+, 2-OG,
  and ascorbate) hydroxylate specific amino acid residues on HIF-1α. FIH-mediated
  hydroxylation blocks cofactors CBP/p300 from binding to HIF-1α, thereby reducing
  HIF transcriptional activity. PHD2-mediated hydroxylation results in ubiquitination
  of the ODDD domain of HIF-1α by the VHL component of the ECV (elongin/culin/VHL)
  ubiquitin ligase complex, thus promoting degradation of HIF-1α in the 265 proteasome
  and reducing HIF transcriptional activity. Under hypoxic conditions, PHD2 and FIH
  activity are reduced, thus enabling HIF-1α to translocate and accumulate in the
  nucleus, where it activates expression of HIF target genes in the HRE as part of
  a transcriptional complex with HIF-1β, CBP/p300, and other cofactors. A negative
  feedback mechanism exists in which PHD2 expression is also enhanced by HIF activity.
  CBP, CREB-binding protein; FIH, factor inhibiting HIF; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ODDD,
  oxygen-dependent degradation domain; PHD2-VHL, prolyl hydroxylase 2–von Hippel-Lindau.
