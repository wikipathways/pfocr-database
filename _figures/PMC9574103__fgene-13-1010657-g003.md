caption: Metabolic pathway alterations in PE—Steroid hormone biosynthesis. (A) Description
  of glucocorticoid metabolism. (B) Description of sex hormone metabolism. Steroid
  hormones are synthesized from cholesterol mainly through the catalysis of the cytochrome
  P450 (CYP) family and the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) family. The catalysis
  of cholesterol is initiated by CYP11A1, and cholesterol is subsequently metabolized
  into glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex hormones. The dysregulation of
  glucocorticoid metabolism and sex hormones in the PE placenta is illustrated in
  (A) and (B), respectively. Red and blue fonts indicate significant increases and
  decreases, respectively. * Differential genes in the discovery and RNA microarray
  validation. △ Differential genes in the discovery and qPCR validation. The genes
  in grey represent they are lack in the placenta, and the X in grey indicates that
  this reaction is blocked in the placenta.
