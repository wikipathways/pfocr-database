caption: Production, degradation, transport, and action of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Whereas LPA is produced extracellularly, S1P
  is produced intracellularly. At least two pathways are postulated for LPA. (①) In
  the autotaxin (ATX) pathway, lysophospholipids (LPLs), mainly lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC), are produced by the action of phospholipase A1 or A2 (PLA1/2), and the resulting
  LPLs are converted to LPA by ATX. (②) In the non-ATX pathway, phosphatidic acid
  (PA) is generated on the cell membrane, possibly by phospholipase D (PLD), and the
  resulting PA is converted to LPA by PA-selective phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1α). LPA
  targets the six LPA receptors (LPA1–6). LPA is specifically degraded by lipid phosphate
  phosphatases (LPPs) to monoacylglycerol (MAG) and phosphate. S1P is produced mainly
  from sphingosine (Sph) by a phosphorylation reaction. Two sphingosine kinases (SphK1
  and SphK2) have been identified. S1P produced intracellularly is transported outside
  by S1P-specific transporters (Spns2 and MFSD2B). Meanwhile, S1P is degraded by lyase
  to hexadecenal (HD) and phosphoethanolamine (PE). After transport to the extracellular
  milieu, S1P binds to ApoM on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and circulates in the
  bloodstream. LPPs are also responsible for extracellular degradation of S1P. HDL-bound
  S1P is brought close to the receptors (S1P1–5), which then activates intracellular
  signaling pathways.
