caption: 'Partial monolignol biosynthetic pathway based on Ref. []. The pathway generates
  the primary monolignols 1 and, following incorporation into lignins via radical
  coupling reactions, the lignin H, G, and S units. p-Coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H),
  the enzyme of major focus here, is now understood to operate on p-coumarate esters
  of shikimic acid (shown), quinic acid, or possibly others, themselves produced by
  p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate/shikimate p-hydroxycinnamoyl transferases (HCTs)
  [], rather than directly on p-coumaroyl-CoA as previously thought (shown in gray).
  Enzymes on the remainder of the pathway have their standard abbreviations [] except
  for BMT. CAD cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, CCoAOMT caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase,
  CCR cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, COMT caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, F5H ferulate
  5-hydroxylase. BMT is the assumed p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA: monolignol transferase,
  an analog of the recently characterized putative p-coumaroyl-CoA: monolignol transferase
  [], which acylates a fraction of the monolignols, mainly sinapyl alcohol, in poplar
  prior to the export of lignin monomers to the wall; incorporation of these p-hydroxybenzoate
  conjugates into lignins results in the p-hydroxybenzoylation of the polymer that
  is readily seen in NMR spectra (Fig. )'
