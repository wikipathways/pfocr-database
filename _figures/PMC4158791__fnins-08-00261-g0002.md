caption: Role for trans-astrocytic lactate trafficking in glutamate turnover. Why
  would the brain want a lactate transport from one astrocyte to different neighboring
  astrocytes? One possibility is that lactate-pyruvate interconversions could be of
  importance for proposed pathways linking glutamate formation, which is astrocyte-specific,
  with its oxidative degradation, which may also be mainly or exclusively astrocytic
  (see papers cited in Hertz and Rodrigues, ). The proposed pathways linking glutamate
  synthesis, excitatory neurotransmission, and glutamate oxidation are illustrated
  in this figure. Pathway 1 (numbered in yellow rectangle) shows the proposed cytosolic-mitochondrial
  metabolite trafficking associated with astrocytic production of glutamine. Pathway
  2 shows glutamine transfer from astrocytes to glutamatergic neurons and extracellular
  release of transmitter glutamate. Pathway 3 illustrates subsequent re-uptake of
  glutamate and its oxidative metabolism in astrocytes. Pathway 4 provides the necessary
  aspartate- and oxaloacetate-dependent connections between pathways 1 and 3, with
  all pathways located in the same cell. A major problem with this model is that glutamate
  formation and oxidation may not occur in the same astrocyte, but, instead, in spatially-separated
  astrocytes. Trans-astrocytic lactate transport and its subsequent conversion to
  pyruvate and carboxylation would allow rapid synthesis of oxaloacetate (OAA) and
  aspartate that are needed for oxidation and synthesis of glutamate, respectively,
  according to this model (pathway 4) (lower right corner for OAA and upper left corner
  for aspartate). Lactate influx (shown in capital letters and with black arrows)
  could compensate for a lack of trafficking of these two compounds (pathway 4) between
  spatially separated glutamate-synthesizing and glutamate-oxidizing astrocytes. In
  addition, provision of lactate-derived pyruvate to astrocytes would provide a faster
  source than glucose for provision of the precursor carbon skeleton, and if only
  one of the two glucose molecules is replaced with pyruvate, malate would still be
  able to enter the mitochondria during glutamate synthesis. Biosynthesis of glutamine
  is shown in brown, and metabolic degradation of glutamate in blue. Redox shuttling
  and astrocytic release of glutamine and uptake of glutamate are shown in black,
  and neuronal hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and its release is shown in red.
  Reactions involving or resulting from transamination between aspartate and oxaloacetate
  are shown in green. Lactate could provide pyruvate for many of the reactions in
  these pathways in many astrocytes. AGC1, aspartate-glutamate exchanger, aralar;
