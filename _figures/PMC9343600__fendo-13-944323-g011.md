caption: Schematic representation of the probable mechanistic explanation behind the
  bone protective effect of linagliptin and metformin in a high-fat diet (HFD) induced
  diabetic osteoporosis. HFD-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus which is characterized
  by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance blocks the AMPK pathway, inhibits BMP-2
  production, Smad phosphorylation, and bone forming RunX2 gene expression. This results
  in the alteration of downstream biomarkers including RANKL/OPG, ALP, and OCN which
  subsequently inhibits bone formation. Another pathway is the hyperglycemia upregulated
  DPP-4 enzyme which reduces incretins thereby increasing the production of bone marrow
  adipose tissue which further upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and sclerostin,
  which subsequently inactivates the Wnt signaling pathway. Inactivated Wnt pathway
  and adipocyte-induced PPARϒ overexpression increase bone resorption by altering
  bone turnover markers like RANKL/OPG, ALP, TRAP, and OCN. HFD-induced high leptin
  levels also cause adipocyte formation and reduced bone formation. Treatment with
  linagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) and its combination with metformin mitigate hyperglycemia
  and leptin production while increasing incretins and bone formation. This is possibly
  achieved via activating AMPK and Wnt pathways as confirmed by increased BMP-2 expression
  and reduced sclerostin respectively. L, Linagliptin; M, Metformin; DPP-4, Dipeptidyl
