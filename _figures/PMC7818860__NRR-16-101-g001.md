caption: 'Pathways of autophagy regulation.Activation of autophagy involves the inhibition
  of the mTORC1 by deprivation of growth-promoting stimuli (growth factors, amino
  acids) or by AMPK (1). The ULK1 complex regulates the class III phosphatidylinositol
  (PtdIns) 3-kinase complex (2). Both complexes induce the formation of the phagophore
  (a double membrane rich in PI3P), which elongates into a vesicle (autophagosome)
  (3). This elongation requires the Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complex (4) and lipidation of
  LC3 (LC3-II), which are inserted in the membrane of the phagophore (5). p62 recruits’
  proteins, fatty droplets, and/or organelles into the autophagosome (6). Atg4 slides
  the LC3-II molecules that are located on the outside of the autophagosome membrane
  and transforming them back into their cytosolic form (7). The autophagosome fuses
  with the lysosome, forming an autophagolysosome (8). RSV modulates autophagy through
  AMPK/mTORC1 dependent and independent pathways (9, 10). AMPK phosphorylates nuclear
  p53, which promotes transcription (11). Dram1 regulates autophagolysosome formation
  (11). Sestrin1/Sestrin2 and p38MAPK inhibit mTOR (12, 13). TSC1 and TSC2 (mTOR blockers)
  favor the activation of the SIRT1 pathway (14). SIRT1 activates AMPK by feedback
  and regulates TSC1 and TSC2 (15, 16). SIRT1, in the nucleus, deacetylates FOXO1
  and FOXO3, which promote the transcription of Rab7 (autophagosomes maturation) and
  Bnip3 (Beclin1 regulator), and deacetylates LC3 (17–20). In the cytoplasm, SIRT1
  promotes the deacetylation of the Atg 5 and Atg7, favoring phagophore elongation
  (21–22). RSV increases autophagy through CaMKKβ (23). Additionally, RSV activates
  autophagy by decreasing the TLR4/NF-κB pathway that activates mTOR (24), by inhibiting
  PI3K/Akt, ERK, and JNK (25). Ambra1: Activating molecule in beclin 1-regulated autophagy
