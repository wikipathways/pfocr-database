caption: Signalling pathway and endogenous antagonists of IL-1β and IL-18. Binding
  of IL-1β to IL-1R1 and IL-18 to IL-18Rα is facilitated by the accessory proteins
  IL-1RAcP and IL-18Rβ, respectively, resulting in recruitment of the adapter proteins
  myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)
  and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), which then causes NF-κB activation. Endogenous
  inhibitory molecules also exist for both cytokines. For IL-1β, these include an
  IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra), which competes with the IL-1RI for IL-1β binding, as
  well as a second IL-1β receptor, IL-1RII. The membrane-bound form of IL-1RII receptor
  contains a short cytosolic signalling domain whereas the soluble form of IL-1RII
  contains only the extracellular portion of the receptor. Thus, while they bind IL-1β,
  they fail to support the activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways.
  Similarly, the actions of IL-18 are negatively regulated by a binding protein known
  as IL-18BP.
