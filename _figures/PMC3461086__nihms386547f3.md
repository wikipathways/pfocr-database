caption: Overview of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (1) Under normal conditions,
  β-Catenin is phosphorylated by a protein complex consisting of GSK3β and Axin among
  other proteins. This phosphorylation triggers the degradation of the β-Catenin molecules.
  (2) Wnt proteins bind to a receptor of the frizzled family which in turn causes
  the recruitment of Disheveled and other proteins such as Axin forming a receptor
  complex. LRP is a protein hypothesized to stabilize the complex. This recruitment
  causes the disassembly and inactivation of the degrading protein complex which in
  turn allows the buildup of β-catenin and accumulation in the nucleus where the molecule
  impacts gene transcription.
