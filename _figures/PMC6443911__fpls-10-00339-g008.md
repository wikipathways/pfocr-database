caption: 'Expression patterns of the most relevant genes related to hormone biosynthesis/homeostasis,
  perception, and signal transduction plotted within the correspondent KEGG maps (the
  pathway code is also indicated at the top-right of eachmap). Only the most relevant
  part of the pathways of brassinosteroids (A), gibberellins (B), ethylene (C), auxin
  (D), abscisic acid (E), cytokinins (F), and jasmonate (G) were extracted (the whole
  maps are available as –) and represented according to the standard KEGG visualization,
  with the same colors rendered by Pathview () and some slight variations (an additional
  legend is provided): the names of the compounds and the key enzymes/proteins are
  reported with regular and bold fonts, respectively. Concerning the ERFs, only those
  with consistent expression patterns in both years are reported along with their
  nomenclature () and classification. The differential expression level was calculated
  as log2-ratio (Flooded versus Control), scale-centered for each time point, and
  color-coded as displayed in the legend (blue: <–1; red: >+1). Each box, representing
  a specific enzymatic or regulatory step, is divided in three sub-boxes representing
  the different time points: from left to right T1, T2, and T6.'
