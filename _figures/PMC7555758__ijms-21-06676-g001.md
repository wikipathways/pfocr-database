caption: The interplay between neurons and glia in various conditions. Neuroprotective
  functions of activated microglia are the elimination of Aβ plaque, release of neuroprotective
  cytokines, and synapse pruning. However, when it turns into a neurotoxic way, it
  causes hyperactivation of synapse engulfment, the release of neurotoxic factors,
  and the involvement of tau pathology. Microglia and astrocytes can reciprocally
  activate each other either in the neuroprotective or neurotoxic pathway. Not only
  cytokines or toxins but also microRNAs can modulate the functional conversion of
  glia. Some ion channel expressions also contribute to the modification. NO—nitric
