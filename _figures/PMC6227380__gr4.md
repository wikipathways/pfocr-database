caption: The effects of DUSP5 deletion on oncogenic signalling through the Ras-ERK
  pathway may depend on the nature of the driving oncogene. Deletion of DUSP5 in cells
  harbouring mutant HrasQ61L causes elevated nuclear ERK activity. This is associated
  with changes in gene expression and an increased susceptibility to Hras-driven skin
  carcinogenesis identifying DUSP5 as a tumour suppressor. In contrast, in MEFs expressing
  mutant BrafV600E deletion of DUSP5 causes a much stronger ERK activation that is
  associated with senescence, growth arrest and suppression of cell transformation
  indicating that in cancers driven by activated Braf DUSP5 may be essential for cancer
  cell survival.
