caption: 'Gut microbiota-regulation of AHR signaling in the liver diseases. Triglycerides
  as in NAFLD, alcohol as in ALD, ischemia, surgical injury and other factors lead
  to the dysregulations of the microbiome and gut-derived metabolites, which can against
  the activation of the AHR, increase the intestinal permeability and incur the bacteria
  translocation into the blood. By providing probiotics or AHR agonists, the AHR signaling
  pathway was activated to reduce the intestinal permeability, decrease the immune
  macrophages, inhibit the transformation of Th 17 cells into Treg cells, and finally
  enhance the intestinal expression of IL-22 and Reg3γ, which ultimately alleviate
  the liver damage via down-regulating the inflammatory factors such as MCP-1, TNF-α,
  ROS, MDA and SOD. Abbreviations: AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Treg, regulatory
  T cells; REG3γ, regenerating islet-derived protein; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
