caption: Proposed action of plakoglobin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Receptor
  tyrosine kinases such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 transduce signals
  through the insulin receptor substrate-1, which can either activate the MAPK or
  PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. There is evidence of crosstalk between RAS and PI3K
  in some contexts. Plakoglobin has been demonstrated to modulate PI3K by binding
  to the p85 regulatory subunit and there is also evidence of MAPK modulation by plakoglobin.
  Levels of plakoglobin are controlled by the E3 ligase Trim32.

  and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways in early resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
