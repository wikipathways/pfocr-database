caption: Type I IFN signaling is down-regulated by negative regulators. Various negative
  regulators cross-regulate the type I interferon (IFN) response, which modulates
  the expression levels and activation states of IFN signaling components. On HBV
  infection and invasion, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize HBV and activate
  the downstream pathway to induce IFN expression. IFNAR1/2 recognize type I IFN and
  activate Janus kinases 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), followed by the activation
  and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription factors
  (STATs), leading to the expression of various IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several
  ISGs were identified as negative regulators of the IFN signaling pathway, including
  the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, ubiquitin-specific protease
  18 (USP18), Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2), p38 mitogen-activated
  kinases (p38 MAPKs), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR), protein tyrosine phosphatases 1 B (PTP1B), and some regulators
  awaiting exact mechanisms. HBV, hepatitis B virus; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor 3;
  IRF7, IFN regulatory factor 7; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2;
  DCs, dendritic cells.
