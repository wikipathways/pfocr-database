caption: Schematic representation of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in C. glabrata.
  (A) Sterol intermediates (boxed with a single line) that accumulate due to perturbations
  in C8-isomerase (ERG2 protein) activity. (B) Sterol intermediates that accumulate
  following azole inhibition of sterol 14α-demethylase (ERG11 protein). The fungistatic
  sterol 14α-methylergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3β,6α-diol is highlighted (boxed with a double
  line). Broken arrows, multiple enzymatic steps; unbroken arrows, single enzymatic
  step. ERG3, ERG4, ERG5, ERG6, ERG25, ERG26, and ERG27 encode C5-desaturase, C24-reductase,
  C22-desaturase, C24-methyl transferase, C4-methyloxidase, C4-decarboxylase, and
  C3-ketoreductase, respectively.
