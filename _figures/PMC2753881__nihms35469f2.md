caption: Cell model for anion and liquid secretion by submucosal gland cells. Anion
  secretion is generally attributed to serous cells. Cl− is the dominant anion that
  is secreted and it enters the cell across the basolateral membrane through the Na+-K+-2Cl−
  cotransporter (NKCC) and exits across the apical membrane through anion channels.
  CFTR mediates secretion induced by VIP and forskolin whereas an alternate anion
  channel, perhaps a Ca+2-activated anion channel, likely participates in the secretion
  induced by muscarinic agonists. HCO3− secretion is mediated through two potential
  pathways. HCO3− generated intracellularly results from the actions of carbonic anhydrase,
  which catalyzes the synthesis of HCO3− and H+ from CO2 and H2O. Removal of H+ from
  the cytoplasm by Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) results in the net synthesis of intracellular
  HCO3− that exits the cell through apical membrane anions channels. This pathway
  is induced by both forskolin and muscarinic agonists. It is likely that forskolin
  also induces transepithelial HCO3− secretion where HCO3− enters cells across the
  basolateral membrane via a Na+-nHCO3− cotransporter (NBC) and exits across the apical
  membrane through anion channels. The mechanisms for forskolin- and VIP-induced secretion
  are probably very similar and require CFTR. Transepithelial secretion of anions
  creates an electrical gradient for cations (mostly Na+) to follow through the paracellular
  pathway and the resultant osmotic gradient pulls water across the barrier. For convenience,
  water is shown moving through the paracellular pathway, but, due to the presence
  of AQP5 in the apical membrane, a significant fraction of water movement is transcellular.

  description: Cell model for anion and liquid secretion by submucosal gland cells.
    Anion secretion is generally attributed to serous cells. Cl− is the dominant anion
    that is secreted and it enters the cell across the basolateral membrane through
    the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) and exits across the apical membrane through
    anion channels. CFTR mediates secretion induced by VIP and forskolin whereas an
    alternate anion channel, perhaps a Ca+2-activated anion channel, likely participates
    in the secretion induced by muscarinic agonists. HCO3− secretion is mediated through
    two potential pathways. HCO3− generated intracellularly results from the actions
    of carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the synthesis of HCO3− and H+ from CO2
    and H2O. Removal of H+ from the cytoplasm by Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) results in
    the net synthesis of intracellular HCO3− that exits the cell through apical membrane
    anions channels. This pathway is induced by both forskolin and muscarinic agonists.
    It is likely that forskolin also induces transepithelial HCO3− secretion where
    HCO3− enters cells across the basolateral membrane via a Na+-nHCO3− cotransporter
    (NBC) and exits across the apical membrane through anion channels. The mechanisms
    for forskolin- and VIP-induced secretion are probably very similar and require
    CFTR. Transepithelial secretion of anions creates an electrical gradient for cations
    (mostly Na+) to follow through the paracellular pathway and the resultant osmotic
    gradient pulls water across the barrier. For convenience, water is shown moving
    through the paracellular pathway, but, due to the presence of AQP5 in the apical
    membrane, a significant fraction of water movement is transcellular. See text
