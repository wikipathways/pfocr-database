caption: '(A) Summary of KEGG analysis results for genes belonging to the cell cycle,
  MAPK, focal adhesion/ECM-receptor interaction and cell communication pathways found
  changed by TGF-β treatment in HKc/HPV16 (upper panel) and HKc/DR (lower panel).
  Red: ≥ 2-fold up-regulated; green β 2-fold down-regulated by TGF-β. (B, C) Gene
  ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes as determined using the GeneSifter
  software. The y-axis represents the percentage of genes changed up or down, within
  each group of genes (in each cellular process) that changed in response to 48 h
  of TGF-β treatment (40 pM) in HKc/HPV16 (B) and HKc/DR (C) by β 2-fold. Data are
  grouped into different ontology groups (x-axis) and each is further separated into
  increased (red bars) and decreased (green bars) expression.'
