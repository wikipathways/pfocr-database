caption: Metabolic Reprogramming of Immune Cells in the Hypoxic Tumor Microenvironment.Under
  hypoxic conditions, immune cells undergo metabolic shifts that foster immunosuppression
  and drug resistance. TAMs rely on glycolysis and OXPHOS, generating ROS to mediate
  immunosuppression. B and T cells display altered glucose and glutamine metabolism,
  resulting in the upregulation of immunosuppressive factors such as IL-10, CD137,
  and CD125. TANs and MDSCs, through VISTA and associated pathways, promote immune
  evasion. CAFs export lactate via MCT4, activating the TGF-β1/p38 MAPK pathway, which
  reinforces tumor resistance
