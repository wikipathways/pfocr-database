caption: The pathway analysis of metabolic differences between the stimulus group
  and the control group. Different metabolites obtained by the stimulus group and
  the control groups were submitted to the online website metaboanalyst 4.0 for relevant
  pathway analysis. The metabolic pathways involved in the stimulus group and the
  control group was shown in Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (a) and Pyruvate metabolism
  (b).
