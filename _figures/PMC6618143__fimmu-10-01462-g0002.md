caption: Overview of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Glucose is converted into
  pyruvate by glycolysis (red square), in the cytosol. Among the glycolytic intermediates,
  glucose-6P can be diverted into PPP (green square) sustaining NADPH and ribose-5P
  production that, in turn, are used for fatty acid or nucleotide and UDP-GlcNAC synthesis,
  respectively. In hypoxic conditions, pyruvate is preferentially reduced to lactate,
  whereas in normoxic conditions it is decarboxylated into acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria.
  Here, acetyl-CoA enters into the TCA cycle, providing reducing agents to the ETC
  to generate energy. Citrate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle, can be exported into
  the cytosol where it participates in fatty acid synthesis (FAS; light blue square).
  Fatty acids can be oxidized via FAO (dark blue square) within the mitochondrial
  matrix thus generating acetyl-CoA to replenish the TCA cycle. PPP, pentose phosphate
