caption: Molecular mechanism for the suppression of TNF-α and chronic inflammation.
  This figure shows molecular mechanism of TNF-α suppression and chronic inflammation
  by phytochemicals, flavonoid, and vitamin D. TNF-α induces chronic inflammation
  and related disorders and finally induces metabolic syndrome. Flavonoid quercetin
  reduces the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the surface of macrophage
  and suppresses the formation of lipid raft on the cell membrane. Suppression of
  TLR4 stops activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway. In addition, vitamin D-enhanced
  LL-37 also suppress the activation of transcription factor NF-κB via TLR4 stimulation.
  Then, the active form of vitamin D, 1α, 25(OH)2-D3, conjugates with the vitamin
  D receptor (VDR) in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus. The vitamin
  D-VDR complex attaches to the gene promoter region of TNF-α and stops production
  of TNF-α. Interaction between phytochemicals and vitamin D suppress the production
  of TNF-α and induction of chronic inflammation. Finally, lowered TNF-α production
  suppresses the chronic-inflammation-related disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular
  diseases, and Alzheimer’s and suppresses metabolic syndrome.
