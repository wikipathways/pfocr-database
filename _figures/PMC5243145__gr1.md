caption: Model of OPG regulation of bone remodelling and TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
  OPG binds to RANKL expressed by stromal cells to prevent RANK–RANKL binding on pre-osteoclasts
  to regulate osteoclastogenesis. OPG can also bind to TRAIL and inhibit TRAIL binding
  to TRAIL receptors expressed on tumour cells. In doing so, OPG can protect against
  TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
