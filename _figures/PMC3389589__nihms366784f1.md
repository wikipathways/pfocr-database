caption: The mTORC1 complex regulates the activity of downstream targets that eventually
  lead to enhanced translation. Cell growth, angiogenesis, transcription, ribosome
  biogenesis and inhibit autophagy. Its regulation is complex and only selected pathways
  known to be implicated in human epilepsies are seen here. TSC1 and TSC2 dimers inhibit
  mTORC1 activity but when mutations impair their function, diseases such as TSC or
  CDIIB ensue (; ; ; ). Other disorders with overactivated mTORC1 include PMSE (mutations
  of STRADalpha) (; ), PTENopathies (Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome
  and Proteus syndrome) where loss of function mutation of PTEN are seen (; ; ). Neurofibromatosis
  type 1, which is due to neurofibromin 1 (NF1) mutations, may also lead to overactivation
  of the mTOR pathway (; ). The incidence of epilepsy, including IS, in neurofibromatosis
  type 1 is lower than in other neurocutaneous disorders. Although it has been speculated
  that the association of epilepsy and neurofibromatosis 1 may be more than coincidental,
  there is no definite proof of a causative role of NF1 in human epilepsies [hence
  the (?) in the figure] (; ).
