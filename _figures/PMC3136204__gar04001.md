caption: 'Ca2+ channels and pumps that have been immunolocalized in mammalian sperm.
  Arrows indicate the most common direction of Ca2+ movement caused by these entities
  in most cell types. The chief channels and pumps involved in hyperactivation are
  CatSper channels and PMCA, which are indicated by large arrows. Others that have
  been identified include the following: sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase
  (SERCA), IP3-gated channels (IP3); voltage-operated Ca2+channels (VOCC), TRPC Ca2+
  channels, secretory pathway Ca2+ ATPase (SPCA), NCX, mitochondrial uniporter (MCU)
  and CNG Ca2+ channels.'
