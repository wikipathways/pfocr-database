caption: Most important targets of gga-miR-302b-5p and gga-miR-302-3p miRNAs. The
  main molecular targets for the studied miRNAs have been presented. The molecular
  pathways and targets for gga-miR-302b-5p are on the left side and for gga-miR-302b-3p
  on the right side. MAKP signalling is responsible for maintaining pluripotency and
  proliferation in mammals. It can be activated by a series of intrinsic and extrinsic
  stimulatory signals. In chickens, gga-miR-302b-5p controls the proliferation rate
  via MAPK signalling. In the case of low-proliferating PGC cell lines, gga-miR-302b-3p
  expression was high. It can be assumed that the high gga-miR-302b-3p expression
  somehow causes downregulation of pathways promoting proliferation, thereby causing
  cell cycle arrest at the G1 stage. gga-miR-302b-5p was found to be highly expressed
  in high-proliferating PGC lines. Hence, it can be hypothesized that probably the
  high expression of gga-miR-302b-5p is contributed in controlling throughout its
  molecular targets in the MAPK signalling pathway. miR-302b-5p probably by inhibiting
  the MAPK pathway components can cause high proliferation rate in PGC lines, and
  miR-302a is responsible for the fast transition from the G1 to S phase in the cell
  cycle [].

  description: Most important targets of gga-miR-302b-5p and gga-miR-302-3p miRNAs.
    The main molecular targets for the studied miRNAs have been presented. The molecular
