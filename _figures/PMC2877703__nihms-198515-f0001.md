caption: Anabolic and catabolic pathways regulating skeletal muscle mass. The major
  anabolic pathway regulating protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is mTOR/TORC1 signaling.
  Upstream triggers (IGF-1, mechanical, amino acids) activate mTOR signaling through
  a number of different intermediary proteins such as Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in
  brain), PLD1 (phospholipase D 1) and its metabolite PA (phosphatidic acid), Vps34
  (vacuolar protein sorting 34) and Rag GTPases (Rag). The activity of mTOR can be
  inhibited by Redd2 through a TSC2-dependent mechanism or enhanced by eIF3f acting
  as a scaffolding protein for mTOR and its downstream target S6K1. The activity of
  the mTOR pathway can also be modulated through crosstalk with the TGF-β pathway
  through myostatin inhibition of Akt activation or FoxO up-regulation of MaFbx resulting
  in eIF3f degradation. Catabolic pathways discussed include FoxO and NF-κB. The FoxO
  pathway is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation and regulates the expression of the
  muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and MURF1, though the evidence for MURF1
  is currently unclear. NF-κB pathway can be activated by different cytokines (TNF-α
  and IL-6) and has been shown to regulate MURF1. The activities of both FoxO and
  NF-kB signaling pathways can be modulated through interactions with the heat shock
  proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp27.
