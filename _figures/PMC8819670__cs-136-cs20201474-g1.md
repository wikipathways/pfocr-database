caption: Schematic of the core Hippo pathway, including the generally tumour suppressive
  core kinase module (highlighted in blue) and tumorigenic transcriptional module
  (highlighted in red). A selection of upstream, regulatory components are additionally
  included. Protein products of genes frequently mutated in various specific tumour
  types are shown in darker colours. Note that MST1/2 are encoded by STK4/3 respectively
  and TAZ by WWTR1.
