caption: Potential elements of PKG-independent signaling mechanism underlying NKA-LTCC
  crosstalk. Binding of activator SSA412 to NKA not only enhances native catalytic
  activity of the enzyme, but also triggers signal to activate Src and Erk1/2. These
  signaling proteins would then relay the signals to phosphorylate both LTCC β2 Ser496
  and α1 Ser1928. Black arrows indicate the direction of activation of NKA-induced
  signaling pathway. The dotted lines show undiscovered proteins that may participate
  in the activation of NKA-induced signal transduction pathway. Phosphorylation of
  α1 Ser1928 may lead to up-regulation of LTCC activity. Phosphorylation of β2 Ser496
  may be linked to down-regulation of the channel.
