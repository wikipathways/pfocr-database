caption: Model of MAPK regulation of RegA. Stimulation of cAMP receptors (cARs) leads
  to Erk2 activation and RegA phosphorylation on residue T676 (negative regulation).
  RegA contains two putative MAPK docking motifs, one near the amino terminus (section
  designated N) and another near the carboxyl terminus (section designated C). Erk2
  association with RegA does not require, and may be inhibited by, the carboxyl-terminal
  docking motif. Erk2 interactions with RegA might require a docking site distinct
  from those of conventional MAPKs or Erk2 might interact indirectly with RegA through
  another protein (e.g. a scaffold). Erk1 is activated downstream of Erk2 and Erk1
  might phosphorylate RegA on residue S142 (positive regulation). Erk1 can function
  in pathways independent of RegA. Histidine kinase pathway signalling also leads
  to the phosphorylation of RegA. RegA function reduces cAMP levels and PKA catalytic
  activity that promote spore formation. Spatial proximity between the amino and carboxyl
  terminus is unknown. Double arrows represent multiple unknown signalling steps.
