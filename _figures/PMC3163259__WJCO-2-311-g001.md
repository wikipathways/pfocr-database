caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the absence and presence of Wnt stimulus. A:
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling is regulated by several antagonists to prevent the formation
  of frizzled (FZD)-Wnt-low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6)
  complex. Secreted frizzled-related protein (sFRP) and Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF)
  bind directly to Wnt, whereas dickkopfs (DKKs) bind to LRP5/6. Furthermore, human
  homologue of Dapper (HDPR1) and Prickle-1 inhibit the action of dishevelled (Dvl).
  In the absence of Wnt stimulus, β-catenin is first primed for phosphorylation by
  casein kinase Iα (CKIα) followed by phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β) at three residues. The phosphorylated β-catenin is targeted for ubiquitination
  by β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) and is subsequently degraded
  by the proteasome. In the nucleus, T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor
  (LEF) represses transcription of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes by interacting
  with co-repressor Groucho; B: Wnt binds to and activates FZD and LRP5/6 receptors.
  Dvl is recruited to the plasma membrane and binds to FZD. This results in the recruitment
  of Axin and GSK3β to LRP5/6. LRP5/6 is then phosphorylated by CKIα and GSK3β, resulting
  in an inactivation of the destruction complex and leading to β-catenin accumulation
  in the cytoplasm. β-catenin then subsequently translocates to the nucleus where
  it binds with TCF/LEF and other co-activators e.g. CREB binding protein (CBP) to
  mediate transcription of genes and microRNAs responsible for proliferation and growth.
