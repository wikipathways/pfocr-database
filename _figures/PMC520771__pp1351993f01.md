caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathways leading to some benzenoid compounds in petunia.
  CoA-dependent, β-oxidative pathway of side chain shortening is shown in blue, whereas
  CoA-independent, non-β-oxidative pathway is shown in black. Red arrows show CoA-dependent
  and non-β-oxidative pathway. Solid arrows indicate established biochemical reactions,
  whereas broken arrows indicate possible steps not yet described. The conversion
  of cinnamoyl-CoA to benzoyl-CoA has already been described in mammals (). BSMT and
  SAMT, S-adenosyl-l-Met:benzoic acid/salicylic acid and salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase,
  respectively; BA2H, benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase; BZL, benzoate:CoA ligase; C4H, cinnamic
  acid-4-hydroxylase; SA GTase, UDP-Glc:salicylic acid glucosyltransferase. Volatile
  benzenoid/phenylpropanoid-related compounds shown with a yellow background were
  analyzed in petunia floral scent and in petal tissue. Additionally, the pools of
  l-Phe and benzoic acid were also evaluated.
