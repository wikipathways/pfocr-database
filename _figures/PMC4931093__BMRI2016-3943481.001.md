caption: Mechanotransduction in transcriptional regulation. Description. Interacting
  with G-actin inactivates MAL. F-actin polymerization uses up amounts of unpolymerized
  F-actin and removes the inhibition of MAL through G-actin and released MAL binds
  to the SRF. This activated SRF binds to DNA and induces transcription. YAP can be
  inhibited by mechanisms not connected with kinases such as AMOT. AMOT protein binds
  actin filaments and allows YAP to enter the nucleus. If it comes to F-actin depolymerization,
  AMOT dissociates from actin and retains YAP in the cytoplasm. When YAP is phosphorylated
  by LATS, AMOT recruits ubiquitin ligase to AMOT/YAP complex and initiates the YAP
  proteasome degradation. The protein bound to tight junction ZO-2, together with
  YAP, enters the nucleus where it inhibits the activity of YAP. The p130 isoform
  of AMOT acts in the opposite manner and promotes nuclear localization of YAP and
  acts as a transcriptional cofactor of the YAP-TEAD complex. Rho GTPases control
  YAP/TAZ activity through canonical GPCR-linked (G-protein coupled receptors) manner
  or noncanonical activation of YAP through focal adhesion signaling and FAK kinase.
  It is hypothesized that the presence of F-actin and stress fiber formation (stress
  fibers) is crucial for the activation of YAP and TAZ. Upon translocation to the
  nucleus, they associate with TEAD transcription factor which drives transcription
  of proliferative genes. Rho GTPases and actin associated proteins (CAP-Z Cofilin,
  Gelsolin) can have a stabilizing effect on the network of actin filaments and directly
  or indirectly regulate YAP/TAZ translocation to the nucleus. Mechanical forces generated
  by ECM can be directly transmitted by the cytoskeleton to the nucleus through LINC
  complex. Mechanical signal transduction is received by nucleoskeleton proteins (laminae,
  emerin) that directly or indirectly may affect gene expression. Activation of β-catenin
  and translocation to the nucleus in response to compressive forces. β-catenin is
  structural component of adherens junctions in epithelial cells, regulating cell-cell
  interactions. Shuttling of β-catenin between the cytoplasm and nucleus is a key
  step in this signaling pathway. Unphosphorylated β-catenin can enter the nucleus
  and activate transcription, despite activation canonical Wnt pathway (adapted from
  Low et al. []).
