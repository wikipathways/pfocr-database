caption: Working model for Hxt6 regulation by the Rod1-Snf1–14-3-3 signaling pathway.
  The 14-3-3 protein Bmh2 and the regulatory domain of Snf1 associate with the arrestin-like
  domain of Rod1. Rod1 forms a complex with Hxt6 at the plasma membrane, which facilitates
  its degradation upon glucose addition. Increased levels of Snf1 or Bmh2 reduce this
  association and delay Hxt6 degradation, presumably by reducing the efficiency of
  Rsp5-dependent ubiquitylation of the permease. MVB, multivesicular body; EE, early
  endosome; Vac, vacuole; Arr, arrestin-like domain; KD, kinase domain; RD, regulatory
  domain.
