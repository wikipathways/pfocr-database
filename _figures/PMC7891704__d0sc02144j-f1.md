caption: . The primary pathways of 1,5-InsP8 synthesis and metabolism. The graphic
  incorporates a proposal, that the pathway for 1,5-InsP8 turnover comprises a predominantly
  cyclical interconversion of InsP6, 5-InsP7, 1,5-InsP8, and 1-InsP7. IP6K = inositol
  hexakisphosphate 5-kinase; PPIP5K = diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate 1-kinase
  (this enzyme also possesses an active 1,5-InsP8 1-phosphatase activity); DIPP =
  diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphatase.
