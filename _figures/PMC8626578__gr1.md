caption: Molecular mechanisms of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2
  is bound by its sequestering protein, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)
  in the cytoplasm. Keap1 prevents the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus and marks
  it for proteosomal degradation. Under stressed conditions, the cysteine residues
  which maintain the association with Nfr2 are oxidized, modifying their shape and
  releasing Nrf2. Unbound Nrf2 is then free to translocate to the nucleus for activation,
  initiating the cytoprotective signaling cascade.
