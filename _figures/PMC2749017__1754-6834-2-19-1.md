caption: Lactose and D-galactose catabolism in Hypocrea jecorina. The heterodisaccharide
  lactose is cleaved extracellularly into its monomers D-glucose and D-galactose.
  While D-glucose is assimilated via glycolysis (not shown), D-galactose can be converted
  by two different pathways. The galactokinase of the classical Leloir pathway (left)
  is specific for α-D-galactose and therefore, β-D-galactose has to be epimerised
  to the α-anomer before it can enter this pathway. A second pathway identified in
  Hypocrea jecorina starts with the reduction of both anomeric forms of D-galactose
  to galactitol. Two hypothetical pathways are drafted for the further degradation
  of galactitol.
