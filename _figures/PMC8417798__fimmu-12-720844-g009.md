caption: Proposed mechanism of obesity-mediated attenuation of ventilator-induced
  lung injury. In obesity, higher circulating levels of IL-6 result in the activation
  of JAK2–STAT3/NFκB and overexpression of SOCS3 at the baseline status, the so-called
  chronic inflammation. The upstream pathway of WNK4 includes NFκB, SOCS3, and possibly
  PKC. These proteins also account for the baseline upregulation of WNK4 in obesity.
  After mechanical stretching (brown color), signal transduction via JAK2 is hindered
  immediately by the existing SOCS3 overexpression in obesity. Subsequently, the inhibition
  of JAK2 signaling retards the STAT3–SOCS3 and NFκB cascades and the WNK4 axis. Eventually,
  VILI is also attenuated.
