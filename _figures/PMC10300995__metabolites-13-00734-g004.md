caption: 'Influence of altered tumor metabolism on immune cells. In the TME, most
  glucose is consumed by tumor cells, resulting in glucose shortage of Teff, which
  decreases the section of IFN-γ, IL-7 and GzmB. Lactate accumulation in TME influences
  proliferation, effector function and secretion IL-2 and IFN-γof Teff. Lactate inhibits
  NK cell cytotoxicity, IFN-γ secretion and promotes NK cell apoptosis. Lactate also
  enhances Treg survival and immunosuppressive function via increasing PD-1 expression.
  The immunosuppressive function of TAMs is also promoted by lactate via activating
  Arg1 to produce arginine. Succinate, one of the metabolites in glucose metabolism,
  is able to enhance TAM immunosuppressive function via the PI3K-HIF-α pathway. IDO
  catalyzes tryptophan to Kyn, which impacts Teff function and enhances Treg survival.
  In this figure, the arrow “up” means increase or enhance; “down” means decrease
  or weaken. Teff: effector T cell; Treg: regulatory T cell; GzmB: granzyme B; NK:
  natural kill cell; TAMs: tumor-associated macrophages; Arg1: arginase 1; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; HIF1α: hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; IDO: indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase;
