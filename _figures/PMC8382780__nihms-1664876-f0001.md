caption: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolic pathway. Cytosolic glutamate is converted
  by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) to form GABA, which is subsequently translocated
  into the mitochondria, where GABA is reversibly converted by GABA transaminase (GABA-T)
  to succinic semialdehyde (SSA). SSA is converted either by SSA reductase (SSAR)
  to γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), or by SSA dehydrogenase (SSADH) to succinate, which
  then enters the Krebs cycle. In the absence of SSADH (i.e., SSADH deficiency), GABA
  and GHB are accumulated to pathologic levels.
