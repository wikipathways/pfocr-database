caption: 'Schema of the predicted mechanisms implicated in SW480 and HT29 cells response
  to cisplatin and miR-519d. MiR-519d inhibits TRIM32 expression and thus suppresses
  the expression of Bcl-2 and promotes the cisplatin-caused generation of ROS. Because
  of the high level of ROS and inhibition of Bcl-2, apoptosis signals produced by
  cisplatin were expanded to trigger the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. As a result, MMP (Δφ) was decreased and the effector caspases (caspase-9
  and caspase-3) are triggered to cause the apoptotic cell death of SW480 and HT29
  cells.Abbreviations: TRIM32, tripartite motif 32; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; MMP,
  mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
