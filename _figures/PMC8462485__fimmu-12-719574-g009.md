caption: 'The proposed mechanism by which Ori regulates the transplant immune response
  through the NLRP3/Iκ-B/NF-κB pathway. Step 1: LPS, DAMPs, etc. were recognized by
  TLR4 of DC and then induced the transcription of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 through
  the Iκ-B/NF-κB pathway with the upregulating expression of MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and
  CD86. Step 2: Ori could bind to cysteine 279 of NLRP3 via covalent bond formation
  to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome interaction and the subsequent production of IL-1β
  and IL-18. On the other hand, Ori could interact with the pathway of Iκ-B/NF-κB
  and prevented its activation. Step 3: In the subsequent immune responses, following
  the administration of Ori, the activated DC induced the alternation in naïve T-cell
  differentiation to expand Tregs along with increased cytokines of TGF-β and IL-10,
  and downregulate Th1 cells with the reduced secretion of IFN-γ. In summary, the
  functional outcome is to suppress the cellular immune responses.'
