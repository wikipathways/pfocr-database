caption: Summary of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway as well as the relative
  expression levels and patterns of key genes in the hybrids. Genes with the associated
  EC number are provided. Accessions encode the differentially accumulated proteins
  identified in this study. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; and F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase.
