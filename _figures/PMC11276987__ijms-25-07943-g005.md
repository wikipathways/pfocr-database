caption: Unifying hypothesis for transmissible ER stress, UPR, adipocyte SASP, NLRP3
  inflammasome activation and inhibition of human antigen R (HuR) RNA-binding protein,
  SIRT-1, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), adiponectin (APN), and impaired heat shock
  (HS) response during chronic metabolic stress in obesity. Under conditions of nutrient
  excess, insulin signaling, hypoxia, and ER stress, hypertrophic adipocytes fail
  to undergo apoptosis and thus develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP). This is associated with loss of HuR-SIRT1-HSF1 pathways, impaired HS response,
  prolonged activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and release of detrimental exosomal
  miRNA. The WAT SASP and ER stress can spread to other tissues, including pre-adipocytes,
  WAT-infiltrating bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMΦ), skeletal muscle, vascular
  endothelium, pancreatic β cells, and Kupffer cells/hepatocytes. This leads to accelerated
  obesity, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, T2DM, and NASH/liver cirrhosis. A
  key feature of SASP in hypertrophic adipocytes is the recruitment of BMD monocytes
  and their polarization to metabolically activated macrophages via cytokine, chemokine,
  and exosomal microRNA (miR-34a, miR-155) release and formation of crown-like structures
  (CLS) in WAT. Lean WAT produces exosomal adiponectin (APN), which, in the presence
  of a functional heat shock response, inhibits vascular, pancreatic β-cell, hepatocyte,
  and WAT metaflammation and senescence. In obese VAT, exosomal adiponectin is decreased
  by 40-fold. Impaired multimerization of adiponectin due to vitamin C deficiency
  contributes to ER stress and UPR in hypertrophic obesity and loss of HMW adiponectin
  secretion. Hypoxia in hypertrophic obesity also impairs oxygen and ascorbate-dependent
  ER protein folding, leading to the UPR response and further ER stress. During adipocyte
  hypertrophy, ER stress can be improved by vitamin C, tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid
  (TUDCA), or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) administration [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89]
