caption: Canonical mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway under normal circumstances and in the presence
  of activating mutations. (A) Canonical RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade and its normal activation
  by external signals (e.g., FGF and EGF growth factors) binding to receptor tyrosine
  kinases [e.g., fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR)]. This interaction triggers signaling through RAS-GTP, RAF, MEK,
  and ERK culminating with the action of phosphorylated ERK in its substrates and
  the regulation of cellular biological functions. In the absence of external stimulus,
  active RAS-GTP switches to its inactive form RAS-GDP by hydrolysis due to GAPs action.
  (B) In the presence of BRAF p.V600E mutation, BRAF constitutively activates MAPK/ERK
  signaling even in the absence of growth factors and dimerization with RAS, sustaining
  MAPK/ERK signaling. (C) Activating mutations in RAS genes (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS)
  lead to unbalance between inactive and active RAS forms toward the active state
  (RAS-GTP) either by reducing GTP hydrolysis or by increasing the rate of GTP loading.
  This mechanism constitutively activates MAPK/ERK signaling even without external
  stimulus, sustaining its signals.
