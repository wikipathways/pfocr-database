caption: Genes are represented by their locus tag and the gene name, if applicable.
  Locus tags and gene names with highlighted background indicate genes that were found
  to be up-regulated (blue) or down-regulated (red) under aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions.
  Locus tags and gene names printed in pink indicate genes that were found to be highly
  transcribed. Pathway end products (yellow) and intermediates (gray) are also highlighted.
