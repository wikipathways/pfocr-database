caption: A model of MCH‐MCHR1 signaling in cilia length shortening. PDLIM5 is the
  most significant key factor for MCHR1‐mediated shortening of cilia length. Alpha‐actinin
  1/4 as an F‐actin regulator by cross‐linking F‐actin is a crucial downstream target
  of the PDLIM5 signaling pathway that causes MCHR1‐induced cilia shortening. First,
  MCH binds to MCHR1 on the cilium, resulting in the activation of Gi/o‐Akt and Gi/o‐JNK
  to transiently increase PDLIM5 mRNA expression (treatment with MCH for 2 h). This
  leads to the upregulation of its protein products. Next, treatment with MCH for
  4 and 6 h increases the expression of alpha‐actinin 1 and 4 mRNA and protein expression,
  which interact with PDLIM5. This upregulation is blocked by PDLIM5 knockdown, suggesting
  a link between alpha‐actinin 1/4 and PDLIM5. Alpha‐actinin 1/4 mRNA expression is
  not upregulated at early time points, indicating that upregulated PDLIM5 initially
  binds to the constitutive preexisting alpha‐actinin 1/4, which leads to the rearrangement
  of actin filaments (actin polymerization, actin bundling). The actin network participates
  in cilia lengthening through the effect on the long‐range intracellular trafficking
  of vesicles to the ciliary base., ,  It is conceivable, therefore, that a larger
  actin meshwork elicited by the PDLIM5‐alpha‐actinin 1/4 complex might not allow
  the arrival of materials at the centrosome that are necessary for its maintenance,
  resulting in ciliary shortening
