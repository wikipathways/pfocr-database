caption: Immunopathogenesis of AA. Schematic diagram depicting the autoimmune process
  of AA. The hair follicle presents autoantigen on MHC class I and MHC class II to
  CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which presumably interact with these cells during immunosurveillance,
  and/or in response to inflammatory signals released in response to environmental
  stimuli. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines produced by these T cell populations
  act on the hair follicle cells, causing them to release more cytokines and chemokines
  that further recruit T cells and NK cells. IFN-γ, a key mediator of AA pathogenesis,
  upregulates IL-15 and inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL9/10/11, in the hair
  follicle via the JAK-STAT pathway. In CD8+ T cells, IL-15 increases production of
  perforin and cytotoxic granzymes, also via the JAK-STAT pathway. NKG2D ​+ ​NK cells
  and CD4+ T cells can bind with NKG2D ligands on the hair follicle, triggering further
  release of perforin and cytotoxic granzymes and resulting in apoptosis of hair follicle
  cells. Potential immunomodulatory treatments, such as JAK inhibitors, are denoted
  in red, and signaling pathways are denoted by yellow, pink, and black arrows. Published
  information is marked with a star, and speculative information is marked with a
  question mark (?). Created with BioRender.com.
