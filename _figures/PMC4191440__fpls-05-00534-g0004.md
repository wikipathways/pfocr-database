caption: Proposed mechanism for signaling pathway affecting flavonoid biosynthesis
  under UV-B radiation. UV-B radiation is strongly absorbed by tryptophan (Trp) amino
  acid residues in the dimeric form of UVR8 photoreceptor leading to the monomerization
  of UVR8. Monomeric UVR8 and COP1 form a complex that accumulates in the nucleus
  of the cells. The UVR8-COP1-SPA complex stabilizes bZIP transcription factor HY5
  promoting the activity of different R2R3 MYBs for the transcription of specific
  flavonoid biosynthesis genes (Favory et al., ; Christie et al., ; Jenkins, ; Li
  et al., ).
