caption: Proposed model for WRKY45-dependent regulation of DP biosynthesis. BTH acts
  on the rice SA signaling pathway, which is split into WRKY45- and OsNPR1 subpathways.
  BTH primes the expression of DP biosynthetic genes via WRKY45. M. oryzae infection
  triggers early accumulation of CKs, which in turn act synergistically with the WRKY45-mediated
  SA signaling pathway to activate expression of DP biosynthetic genes, leading to
  accumulation of DPs. MKK4-dependent pathways are also shown
