caption: 'Metabolic regulation of antioxidants: Highly proliferative cancer cells
  rely on glycolysis to meet its exceedingly high energy demands. Activation of Hypoxia
  inducible factor-1 (Hif-1) cause the suppression of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)
  resulting in the opening up of glucose transporters and increase in the flux of
  glucose in glycolytic cycle. During hypoxia, Hif-1 switches cell gene expressions
  from glycolysis to production and utilization of lactates (Warburg effect). The
  oncometabolites, fumerate and succinate may act on Hif-1 for inducing a ‘pseudohypoxic’
  response. Besides, mutations in p53 attenuate TP53-induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis
  Regulator (TIGAR) causing a lack of inhibition on the Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) enzyme activity leading to the increase in the metabolic flux through glycolytic
  and Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP). The D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) and the L-2-hydroxyglutarate
  (L2HG) are enantiomers of the metabolite 2-HG arising from the mutations in the
  Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1/2/3 (IDH1/2/3). Eventually, these changes may cause altered
  metabolic flux responsible for the initiation of neoplasms. Thick solid lines indicate
  strong and dotted lines indicate weak flux of metabolites. Abbreviations: HK, Hexokinase;
