caption: Catalase prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals in both apoptosis-inducing
  signaling pathways. In the hypochlorous acid pathway, this occurs through decomposition
  of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, and in the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite
  pathway, it proceeds through decomposition of peroxynitrite into nitrite and oxygen.
