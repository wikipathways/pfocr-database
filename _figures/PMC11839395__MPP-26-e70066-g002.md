caption: Impacts of viral infection on plant metabolic pathways. This diagram illustrates
  the interplay between plant metabolism and viral infections, focusing on primary
  and secondary metabolic pathways and their alterations in response to viral infection.
  The relationships between metabolic pathways and their respective viral effects
  or defence mechanisms are highlighted. BCAAs, branched‐chain amino acids; BMV, brome
  mosaic virus; CCYV, cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus; CLCuMV, cotton leaf curl Multan
  virus; CMV, cucumber mosaic virus; DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  F1,6BP, fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphate; FA, fatty acid; Farnesyl‐PP, farnesyl pyrophosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate; G6P, glucose‐6‐phosphate; GABA, γ‐aminobutyric
  acid; GRBV, grapevine red blotch virus; HK, hexokinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  mETC, mitochondrial electron transport chain; OAA, oxaloacetate; PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia‐lyase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase; PMV, poppy mosaic virus; PRSV, papaya ringspot virus. PVY, potato virus
  Y; PWV, passionfruit woodiness virus; RBSDV, rice black‐streaked dwarf virus; RDV,
  rice dwarf virus; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAM, S‐adenosyl methionine; SSAMS,
  S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine synthetase; SCMV, sugarcane mosaic virus; TBSV, tomato bushy
  stunt virus; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TCV, turnip crinkle virus; TMV, tobacco mosaic
  virus; TRV, tobacco rattle virus; Unsaturated FA, unsaturated fatty acids; ZYMV,
