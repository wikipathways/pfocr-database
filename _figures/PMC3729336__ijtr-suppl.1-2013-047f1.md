caption: 'Schematic overview of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. L-Tryptophan (L-TRP)
  is the extracellular fluid is transported into cells by a high-affinity tryptophan
  transporter. The first rate-limiting enzyme indoleanime 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)
  catalyses the initial enzymatic step in the KYN pathway leading to the synthesis
  of a number of KYN metabolites. IDO1 is induced by several proinflammatory cytokines;
  therefore, KYN metabolism is increased during many inflammatory conditions. By contrast,
  glucocorticoid hormones increase transcription of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO)
  and peripheral degradation of L-TRP via the KYN pathway. The biological function
  and induction mechanism of IDO2 are still unclear and controversial. IDO1 is an
  important regulatory enzyme in the production of L-KYN in a broad spectrum of cell
  types. Low activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) in some cells restricts
  the capacity to synthesize QUIN from L-TRP.Abbreviations: KAT I, II, III, Kynurenine
