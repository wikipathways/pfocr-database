caption: STA-1 Signaling in C. elegans. Standard STA-1 activity mirrors the TGF-β
  pathway, in terms of contribution to development, but there is an alternate mechanism
  in which STA-1 directly interacts with members of this path. In the absence of DAF-7,
  4 or 14, STA-1 is able to directly contribute to TGF-β signaling through interactions
  with the DAF-1 receptor or the downstream Smad, DAF-8. There is also a proposed
  feedback inhibition of dauer initiation through (pro-dauer) DAF-3 regulated transcription
  of sta-1.
