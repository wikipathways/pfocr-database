caption: Phase separation in cGAS-STING signaling pathway. cGAS phase separates with
  DNA to form a liquid droplet that excludes inhibitory mediators like BAF and TREX1
  outside. Then, secondary messenger 2′3′-cGAMP is produced, and its translocation
  activates STING and TBK1, eventually upregulating type-1 IFN secretion that is essential
  for innate immune responses. Meanwhile, after cGAS stimulation, the remaining STING
  forms a puzzle-like structure that avoids excessive activation of STING and TBK1.
  Tegument protein ORF52/VP22 from herpesvirus replaces cGAS and then phase separates
  with DNA to impede 2′3′-cGAMP production, which causes viral immune evasion
