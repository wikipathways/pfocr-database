caption: Contribution of DCs and their expression of CCR7 to the pathogenesis of corneal
  and ocular surface inflammatory disease. DCs that populate the tissues of the ocular
  surface initiate this pathway via (1) capture of antigen (e.g,, microbial products,
  allergens, autoantigen, alloantigen, etc.) and subsequent migration to regional
  lymph nodes via a CCR7 mediated process. (2) Pathogenic T cells are then activated
  in the LN via migratory DCs and access the ocular surface tissues by way of systemic
  circulation. (3) Pathogenic T cells, in turn, cause disease by promoting a proinflammatory
  cascade (e.g., secretion of cytokines, recruitment of myeloid cells, etc.), and
  causing cytotoxicity of ocular cells.
