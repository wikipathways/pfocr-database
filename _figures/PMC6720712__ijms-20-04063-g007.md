caption: Diagram illustrating the underlying mechanism by which that miR-15a regulates
  the differentiation of chicken intramuscular preadipocytes by targeting ACOX1, SCP2
  and ACAA1 in the PPAR signaling pathway. A red upward arrow indicates that this
  process is promoted, or this indicator is increased; a red downward arrow indicates
  that this process is inhibited, or this indicator is decreased. PPARs, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptors; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein; ACAA1, acetyl-CoA
  acyltransferase 1; SCP2, sterol carrier protein 2; ACOX1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1.
