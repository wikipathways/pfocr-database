caption: 'Apt functions as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway in CySCs.
  Apontic (Apt) is required in the CySCs as a feedback inhibitor of STAT signaling
  to promote the CySC to cyst cell transition: see text for details. Apt’s genetic
  interactions with the STAT-targeting miR-279 and the conserved inhibitor of STAT,
  Socs36E, suggest it may mediate expression of these targets, as in ovaries. GSC=Germline
  Stem Cell, CySC=Cyst Stem Cell'
