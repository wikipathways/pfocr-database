caption: 'a | Several pathways of brain energy metabolism in neurons are disrupted

  disorders with declines are shown in the red boxes). Increased production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and neuroinflammation that negatively affect brain energy levels
  are shown with a thick black arrow. The combination of impaired ATP production and
  increased levels of ROS contributes to declining brain function. b | Molecules or
  potential therapies implicated in brain energy rescue strategies target six broad

  oxaloacetate, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide
  (GIP), leptin, amylin, metformin, liraglutide and sitagliptin); anaplerosis and
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (purple; propionic acid (C3), heptanoic acid
  (C7), octanoic acid (C8), d-β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and ketone esters (KE)); mitochondrial
  transport and biogenesis (olive-grey); ketogenesis (orange; interventions indicated
  with two asterisks: BHB, C8, decanoic acid (C10) and KE); or protection against
  ROS and inflammation (light green; interventions indicated with three asterisks:
  ghrelin, GLP1, GIP, leptin, adiponectin, metformin, AP39, mitochondrial division
  inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1), MitoQ, BHB, ketogenic diet and KE). Details of the molecules
  or potential therapies are shown in  (preclinical studies) and , (clinical studies).
  Complementary interventions such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diet and exercise
  are not shown. Neurons take up lactate generated by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes
  (not shown). Medium-chain fatty acids such as decanoic acid and octanoic acid in
  the circulation can enter astrocytes and produce ketones and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA).
