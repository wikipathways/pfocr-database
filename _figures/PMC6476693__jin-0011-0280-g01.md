caption: Metabolic profiles influence macrophage inflammatory status. Macrophages
  respond to planktonic infections via sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) through Toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement. This favors aerobic glycolysis
  to provide TCA cycle intermediates for anabolic processes required for proinflammatory
  effector mechanisms. In contrast, biofilm infections polarize macrophages towards
  an anti-inflammatory state, and the biofilm-derived signals that drive this process
  are largely unknown (indicated by question mark). Since anti-inflammatory macrophages
  are typified by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) it is predicted that biofilm
  infections will bias cells towards this metabolic pathway, and several receptors
  associated with anti-inflammatory cytokines might be involved (i.e., CD36, IL-10R,
  IL-4R, and IL-13R). The metabolic gradients present in the tissue microenvironment
  (i.e., nutrients, oxygen) also influence the pro- versus anti-inflammatory profiles
  of macrophages that are intimately linked to their metabolic state. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
