caption: Schematic illustration of the Spore-Based Oral Autonomous Nanoparticles and
  its transepithelial transport mechanism. The chemotherapeutic drugs DOX and sorafenib
  (SOR), which are used as a synergistic treatment of cancer, are co-loaded in spores
  to construct an autonomous NPs generator (DOX/SOR/Spore-DA). The generator can continuously
  produce large amounts of DOX/SOR/Spore-DA NP in the GIT microenvironment. Subsequently,
  NP is effectively taken up by epithelial cells through the apical sodium-dependent
  bile acid transporter-mediated endocytic pathway, which can overcome various biological
  obstacles of the intestinal epithelium and increase the release of basolateral drugs,
  thereby improving the bioavailability of drugs.Reprinted with permission from Ref.
