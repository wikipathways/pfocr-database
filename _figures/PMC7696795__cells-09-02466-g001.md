caption: 'Activation of JNK by proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17 leading to
  autoimmune arthritis. Binding of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α or IL-17 to its
  receptor induces activation of JNK-AP-1 leading to autoimmune arthritis. Along the
  signaling pathways, many adaptors and kinases are involved. The sequences of activation
  are indicated with arrows. The TNF-α- and IL-17-mediated signaling pathways are
  shown in red color and green color, respectively. The common pathway shared by both
  TNF-α and IL-17 signals is illustrated in black color. Abbreviations: TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha; TNF-αR, TNF-α receptor; IL-17, interleukin-17; TNFR1, TNF
