caption: Biosynthetic pathway and post-assembly-line conversions of piscibactins and
  photoxenobactins in X. szentirmaii. Solid and dashed arrows indicate assembly line
  biosynthesis and post-assembly-line conversions in culture media, respectively.
  Post-assembly-line conversions from 5 to 1–4 and 6 were observed both in vivo and
  in vitro, while the conversion from 5 to 8 was observed in vitro (, traces ii–v).
