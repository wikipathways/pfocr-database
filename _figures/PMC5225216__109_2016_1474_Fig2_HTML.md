caption: Hypothesis of intercellular energy relocation triggered by gut microbiota.
  Dietary alteration can result in change of gut microbiota and weakening of gut integrity,
  subsequently penetration of gut microbes and their products. The TLRs on metabolic
  cell such as adipocyte can sense the low amount of gut bacteria-derived TLR ligands,
  which leads to catabolic events including lipolysis. Energy or nutrient is shunted
  to other locations. Activation of the TLR pathway turns on glycolysis in immune
  cell (e.g., macrophage) to initiate polarization (upper panel). When the change
  in diet persists, e.g., overeating in obesity, other metabolic mechanisms are activated.
  Expansion of adipose tissue results in high turnover of lipids in adipocytes. Excess
  energy continuously overflows to other organs. More immune cells infiltrate into
  those organs, and energy or lipids are now taken up by the adjacent macrophages
  for their own utilization to sustain inflammation, which aggravates metabolic dysfunction (middle
  panel). The glycolysis and lipolysis pathways are briefly depicted in the boxes
  at the bottom (bottom panel)
