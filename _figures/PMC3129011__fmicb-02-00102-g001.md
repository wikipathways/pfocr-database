caption: A working model of cervical infection by gonococci. Based on published, as
  well as unpublished data, a putative, working model of the dynamic interactions
  mediating gonococcal disease of cervical epithelia is presented in context of the
  menstrual cycle. Estrogen (E2), predominant in the follicular phase is depicted
  by the blue line. Progesterone (Pg) is predominant in the luteal phase following
  ovulation (occurring around day 14) and is depicted in green. Menses occurs when
  both E2 and Pg levels are low. The actions of E2 and Pg are mediated by their cognate
  steroid hormone receptors (SHRs, shown as purple crosses). Upon stimulation, SHRs
  function as transcription factors mediating the expression of select cellular products
  (e.g., complement (C′) protein C3) or as signaling mediators (e.g., in the Akt-dependent
  induction of nitric oxide, NO). Cervical epithelial cells produce and secret all
  of the proteins comprising the alternative pathway of the C′ system. During the
  luteal phase and during menses, C3 is release to the extracellular milieu where
  it is activated to form C3b upon gonococcal infection. C3b binds to the gonococcus
  surface where it is rapidly cleaved to form inactive, iC3b, a necessary ligand for
  complement receptor 3 (CR3)-mediated cervical cell invasion. Deposition of C3b upon
  the gonococcus surface in conjunction with CR3 engagement promote the sustained
  release of secreted gonococcal products, including a phospholipase D (PLD) that
  aid colonization, invasion, and survival of gonococci during their residence within
  the lower female genital tract. As estrogen concentrations begin to rise, CR3 presence
  on the surface of pex cells is increased. More CR3 available to bind iC3b-opsonized
  gonococci correlates with the increased association of gonococci with pex cells.
  Engagement of CR3 triggers the recruitment of SHRs to the cytoplasmic domain of
  CR3 where they likely participate in the cervical cell signaling pathways triggered
  with gonococcal infection. The direct interaction of (Ng)PLD with (host) Akt, triggers
  ruffle formation and the internalization of gonococci within macropinosomes. Levels
  of CR3 on the surface of both uninfected and infected pex cells decrease with increasing
  E2. This might indicate that the internalization of gonococci is augmented by E2
  in the mid-follicular phase. Gonococcus-containing vacuoles coalesce near the apical
  surface within pex cells, and CR3 is disengaged. Protein secretion by intracellular
  gonococci residing within the macropinosome under conditions of low Pg is likely
  down-regulated as a consequence of rapid C3 depletion. However, as progesterone
  levels begin to rise, C3 levels also would again increase because of transcription
  factor activity exerted upon the C3 gene by SHRs. It is then expected that Akt activity
  would be increasingly maintained as more PLD is released by gonococci in the presence
  of increased C3(b). The ability of Pg to promote the intracellular survival of gonococci
  occurs in part by augmenting Akt activity, which triggers nitric oxide (NO) production.
  NO supports (micro)aerobic respiration by intracellular (and extracellular) gonococci.
  Late in the luteal phase, Akt activity decreases with progressively decreasing Pg.
  Decreasing Akt, which also plays a role in cellular trafficking, in conjunction
  with other host and bacterial constituents, may modulate the release of C3 and gonococci
  from pex cells to the extracellular cell surface where ever increasing numbers of
  bacteria colonize the cell surface, eventually leading to the formation of a biofilm.
