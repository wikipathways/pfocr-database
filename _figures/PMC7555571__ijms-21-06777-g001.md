caption: 'The AHR signaling pathway. In the classical pathway, an inactive form of
  the AHR is cytoplasmic and complexed with HSP90, AIP and SRC. Upon ligand binding,
  the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus, where the AHR forms a complex with
  ARNT and binds to XRE, inducing AHR-target gene expression. The AHR can also induce
  transcription of genes involved in inflammation, immune response and/or development.
  AHRR competes with the AHR for binding with ARNT and forms the inactive heterodimer
  AHRR-ARNT. The dissociation of the AHR transcriptional complex leads to translocation
  of the AHR to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded via the proteasomal pathway. AHR:
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AHRR: AHR repressor; ARNT: AHR nuclear translocator;
  AIP: AHR-interacting protein; Ub: ubiquitin; and XRE: xenobiotic response element.'
