caption: 'The androgen receptor (AR) signalling pathway. The AR protein is structurally
  made up of three main functional domains: The N-terminal domain (NTD), the DNA-binding
  domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). A small hinge region lying between
  DBD and LBD is not shown. In its inactive form, the AR is bound to chaperone proteins
  of the Heat-shock protein (HSP) class. In addition to HSPs, Choline kinase alpha
  (CHKA) has recently been identified as an AR chaperone, bound both in the cytosol
  and the nucleus. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is synthesised from testosterone locally
  and binds the LBD of the AR, specifically the ligand-binding pocket. Upon binding,
  a conformation change in the AR occurs, where the HSP chaperones dissociate and
  the NTD and LBD form interactions (N/C interaction). Nuclear translocation occurs
  due to conformation change-induced exposure of a nuclear localisation signal (NLS)
  within the hinge region. Subsequent interactions of the NLS with the nuclear import
  proteins drive the AR into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, the AR can exist in
  both dimer and monomer forms, however when binding to androgen response elements
  (AREs) of the DNA, the AR almost always exists as a dimer. Androgen-bound transcriptionally
  active AR dimers assume parallel “head-to-head” and “tail-to-tail” conformations,
  wherein the NTD, DBD and LBD all form the dimerisation interface. The two NTDs within
  the AR dimer adopt different conformations and surround the LBDs, with one NTD mainly
  interacting with its own LBD through intra-molecular N/C interaction, while the
  second NTD appears to form both intra- and intermolecular N/C interactions by interacting
  with both LBDs within the AR dimer. Transcriptional initiation can then occur by
  interactions with coactivators and subsequently transcription of AR target genes
  by other cofactor enzymes. These genes increase proliferation and survival signals
  to stimulate cell growth .'
