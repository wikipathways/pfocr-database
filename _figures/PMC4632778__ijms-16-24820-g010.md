caption: Schema of osteogenic differentiation through the BMP signaling pathway and
  possible regulation by PARP activity. (A) BMP-2 activates Smad1/5/8 (dark gray arrows)
  and upregulates Runx2 transcription to promote osteogenic differentiation. Runx2
  induces expression of Osterix and accelerates transcription of Osteocalcin, Bone
  Sialoprotein, Osteonectin, and Osteopontin (brown thick arrows). PARP activity may
  also be involved in this pathway (black dotted arrows). Dotted lines are based on
  the results of this report; (B) PJ34 is suggested to suppress BMP-2 and Smad4 signaling
  (light gray arrows), leading to attenuation of mRNA levels for these factors (diagonal
  stripe arrows) and subsequent decrease in osteogenic differentiation.
