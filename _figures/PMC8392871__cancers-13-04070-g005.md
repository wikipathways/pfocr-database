caption: 'Scheme of the mechanism of P-bi-TAT in blocking thyrointegrin αvβ3 and its
  impact on NF-kB signaling pathways. Extracellular matrix (ECM) contains the RGD
  cell binding sequence that can bind to the thyrointegrin αvβ3 and initiate a cell
  signaling cascade that results in increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators.
  P-bi-TAT interferes with the interaction between RGD and thyrointegrin αvβ3, resulting
  in downregulation of multiple signaling pathways (FAK-Src, ERK, and AKT). P-bi-TAT
  downregulates NF-kB signaling pathway through activation of FAK signaling pathway.
  P-bi-TAT interferes with the action of NF-kB, resulting in downregulation of plasma
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. Red = inhibition, green = activation. Abbreviations:
  ADAMT = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin, RGD = arginyl
  glycyl aspartic acid, ERK = extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, FAK = focal adhesion
  kinase, IL = interleukin, MMP = Matrix metalloproteinase, PKC = protein kinase C,
  PTK2 = protein tyrosine kinase 2, and NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain B.'
