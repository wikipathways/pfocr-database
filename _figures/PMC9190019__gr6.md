caption: Schematic representation of RHX6-mediated inhibition of the activation of
  EGFR signaling pathway. RHX6 interference with RHBDF1 binding to TACE and clathrin
  leads to diminished mature TACE. Clathrin bound to RHX6 is unable to recruit HSC70,
  thus unable to carry out pro-TGFα transportation to the cell surface, failing to
  activate EGFR signaling pathway. TACE, TNFα converting enzyme.
