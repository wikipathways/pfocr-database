caption: Microglial metabolic programming and immune functions in AD. Alzheimer’s
  pathogenic stimuli Aβ and tau induce microglial metabolic alterations. Metabolic
  alterations are mediated by the mTOR-HIF1a pathway and characterized by decreased
  OXPHOS, increased glycolysis, impaired ATP production, a “broken” TCA cycle, increased
  ROS, and lipid droplet accumulation. These alterations in turn effect microglial
  immune functions including phagocytosis, chemotaxis, cytokine production, membrane
  biogenesis, and antigen presentation. GLUTs, glucose transporters; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor- α; IL-6, interleukin-6;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1β; HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin.
