caption: 'In plants and some fungi, the phenylalanine ammonia lyase/tyrosine ammonia
  lyase (PAL/TAL, dotted lines) activities catalyze the conversion of Phe or Tyr into
  trans-cinnamic acid () and trans-hydroxycinnamic acid, respectively, which are subsequently
  converted into benzyl alcohol or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and other derived compounds
  through oxidative and nonoxidative pathways (, ). The shikimate and chorismate pathway
  for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids is shown. The main intermediates are indicated:
  phenlypyruvate and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The PAL/TAL reactions have not been
  demonstrated in Saccharomycotina yeasts, bacteria, and animal cells (, , ). In bacteria,
  they synthesize 4-HB directly from chorismate () or, in the case of Pseudomonas
  putida, through a mandelate pathway (). The great production of benzyl-derived compounds
  by H. vineae through an alternative pathway will contribute to our understanding
  of the steps that are shown with interrogation symbols on this scheme. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate.'
