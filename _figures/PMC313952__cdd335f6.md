caption: Fig. 6. Models for EGFR, FGFR and an unknown RTK pathways. The order of linear
  pathways was either determined by double mutants analyses or inferred from biochemical
  assays in other model systems. For example, the relationship between sem-5 Grb2
  and let-341 Sos1 was adapted from the previous molecular characterization of mammalian
  counterparts. Arrows indicate a positive effect and bars indicate a negative effect.
  For simplicity, only events upstream of RAS are presented. The dashed pathway X
  is insufficient to allow signaling in the absence of let-60 activity. The putative
  relationships between ptp-2 and target genes are yet to be defined. A, B and X are
  hypothetical receptor tyrosine kinase, adaptor and RasGEF, respectively.
