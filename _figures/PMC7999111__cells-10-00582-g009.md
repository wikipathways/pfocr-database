caption: 'Regulation of photosynthetic CO2-fixation and abiotic stress tolerance in
  the ‘turbocharging’ plants with the AaPEPC1. Overexpression of the AaPEPC1, a highly
  abundant enzyme catalyzing the primary fixation of CO2 in CAM plants, increases
  photosynthetic CO2-fixation, and rewires the diel accumulation-depletion pattern
  of malate and glucose. The re-programed malate-dependent carboxylation leads to
  the feedback up-regulation of the orthologs of key CAM pathway genes, i.e., nocturnal
  carboxylation and diurnal decarboxylation modules. The increased malate content
  up-regulates pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase (P5CR), which results in higher proline accumulation. Proline accumulation
  enhances the salt and drought tolerance of the transgenic plants expressing AaPEPC1.
  Additionally, a higher glucose content produced from the photosynthetic source is
  transported as sucrose or glucose to sink tissues and organs to promote cell proliferation,
  elongation, and expansion, as well as to maintain energy and metabolic homeostasis,
  resulting in improved biomass production [,]. The up arrows indicate up-regulation
  of expression of genes coding these enzymes or content. CA: carbonic anhydrase;
  OAA: oxaloacetate; MDH: malate dehydrogenase; ALMT: aluminum-activated malate transporter;
