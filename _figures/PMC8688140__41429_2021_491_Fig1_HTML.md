caption: 'A schematic of the key cellular and biomolecular interactions between ivermectin,
  host cell, and SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevention of complications:
  ivermectin (IVM) (red block) inhibits and disrupts binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
  at the ACE-2 receptors (green). The green dotted lines depict activation pathways
  and the red dotted lines depict the inhibition pathways. The TLR4 receptors are
  directly activated by SARS-CoV-2 and also by LPS mediated activation (seen during
  ICU settings) causing activation of NF-Kb pathway and MAP3 kinases leading to increased
  intranuclear gene expression for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (responsible
  for cytokine storm) and NO release (responsible for blood vessel dilatation, fluid
  leak, low blood pressure, ARDS and sepsis). The NF-Kb and STAT-3 pathway activation
  is central to the pathogenesis and sequelae of COVID-19. STAT-3 physically binds
  to PAK1 and increases IL-6 transcription. The annexin A2 at the cell surface converts
  plasminogen; PLG to plasmin under the presence of t-PA. Plasmin triggers activation
  and nuclear translocation of STAT-3. An upregulation of STAT-3 stimulates hyaluronan
  synthase 2 in the lung cells causing hyaluronan deposition leading to diffuse alveolar
  damage and hypoxia. STAT-3 also directly activates TGF-beta initiating pulmonary
  fibrosis; a typical characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 lung pathology. The damaged type
  2 cells express PAI-1 and an already hypoxic state also causes an upregulation of
  PAI (through hypoxic inducible factor-1) along with direct stimulation by STAT-3.
  Simultaneous STAT-3 and PAI-1 activation inhibits t-PA and urokinase-type plasminogen
  activator leading to thrombi formation. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds
  to the CD147 on red blood cells and causes clumping. IVM in turn binds to SARS-CoV-2
  Spike protein and hence prevents clumping. T cell lymphopenia in COVID-19 can also
  be attributed to the direct activation of PD-L1 receptors on endothelial cells by
  STAT-3. IVM directly inhibits the NF-kb pathway, STAT-3, and indirectly inhibits
  PAK1 by increasing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The natural antiviral response
  of a cell is through interferon regulatory genes and viral RNA mediated activation
  of TLR-3 and TLR7/8- Myd88 activation of transcription of interferon regulator (IRF)
  family. For a virus to establish an infection, this antiviral response needs to
  be inhibited by blocking interferon production. The proteins such as importin and
  KPNA mediate nuclear transport of viral protein and subsequent IFN signaling. The
  SARS-CoV-2 proteins (ORF3a, NSP1, and ORF6) directly block IFN signaling causing
  the surrounding cells to become unsuspecting victims of the infection. IVM inhibits
  both importin ab (green) as well as the KPNA1 receptors (brown) causing natural
  antiviral IFN release. IVM also inhibits viral RdrP, responsible for viral replication.
