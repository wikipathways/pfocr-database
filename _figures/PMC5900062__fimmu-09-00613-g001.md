caption: Activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways through
  membrane-bound extracellular ligands. TNFR and toll-like receptor (TLR) family members,
  as well as antigen receptors activate the canonical pathway; and regulation of B
  cell activating factor receptor (BAFFR), CD40, OX40, LTβR, and receptor activator
  of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) activate the non-canonical pathway. Triggering
  of canonical pathway results in activation of p50/p65 (RelA), while the non-canonical
  pathway signaling leads to activation of p52/RelB complexes. Both pathways require
  phosphorylation and activation of inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) subunit(s) in
  order to release NF-κB molecules that are sequestered by an inhibitor, e.g., IκBα
  or p100. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the inhibitors by IKKs release NF-κB
  that translocate into nucleus in the forms of homodimers or heterodimers complexes
  and bind to the κB site of their target genes.
