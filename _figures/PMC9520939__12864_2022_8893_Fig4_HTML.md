caption: 'Suggested reconstruction of the response of Plakortis angulospiculatus (top
  panel) and Haliclona vansoesti (bottom panel) after exposure to coral (A and C)
  and macroalgae (B and D) dissolved organic matter. Schematic representation based
  on the set of annotated differentially expressed transcripts between the coral-
  and macroalgal-DOM treatments, which are circled by a full line. Transcripts circled
  by a dashed line are part of the non-differentially expressed set, but included
  here because their presence could regulate specific cellular functions when associated
  with some of the differentially expressed transcripts. Transcripts upregulated in
  the metazoan set are depicted in the background tissue, while transcripts upregulated
  in the prokaryotic sets are depicted inside the bacterium shape. Activation is indicated
  by full arrows, while inhibition by dashed lines. Signaling pathways are written
  in red color. Abbreviations: NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa-B; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; AKT, serine/threonine-protein kinase; Arp2/3, actin related protein
  2/3 complex; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; FA, fatty acids; AA, amino acids; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle. Created with BioRender.com'
