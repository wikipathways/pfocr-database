caption: Demethylation in PADI4 and a simultaneous restoration of its expression occurred
  during ATRA-induced differentiation. Furthermore, ATRA stimulation facilitates the
  nuclear translocation of PAD4, and in turn, PAD4could promote the differentiation
  of APL cells in the presence of ATRA. Mechanistically, PAD4 could directly regulate
  SOX4 expression via citrullinating histone3, thereby antagonizing the methylation
  of H3Arg17. In addition, PU.1 is validated as the direct target of SOX4, and PAD4
  could function to promote differentiation or regulate PU.1 expression in a SOX4-dependent
  manner, suggesting a functional pathway may form among PAD4, SOX4, and PU.1 in the
  pathological mechanism of APL.
