caption: Phosphorylation (P) of specific sites in PRs couple multiple receptor functions,
  including transcriptional synergy in the presence of steroid hormones and growth
  factors predicted to activate MAPK and/or CDK2, and nuclear import or export (shuttling)
  in response to MAPK activation. Rapid ligand-dependent PR downregulation by the
  ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (degradation) occurs upon nuclear export. 1. Ligand-binding
  mediates dissociation of heat-shock proteins and nuclear accumulation of PR dimers.
  2. Nuclear PRs mediate gene regulation via the classical pathway; phosphorylated
  PRs may recruit regulatory molecules that are phospho-proteins, and function in
  one or more inter-connected processes (transcription, localization, and turnover),
  perhaps linked by a common cellular machinery. 3. PRs and growth factors activate
  MAPKs independently via a c-Src kinase-dependent pathway, and this may result in
  positive regulation of PR action via “feed-back” regulation (i.e. direct phosphorylation
  of liganded PRs or co-activators), occurring in both the absence and presence of
  steroid hormone ligands and on PRE-containing or other PR-regulated gene promoters.
  4. Activation of MAPKs by PRs provides for regulation of gene targets whose promoters
  do not contain PREs and are otherwise independent of PR-transcriptional activities
  but utilize PR or SR-activated MAPKs, such as regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter
  by Ets factors. 5. MAPK regulation of PRs has been shown to mediate nuclear accumulation/shuttling
  and nuclear export that is coupled to regulation of PR transcriptional events.
