caption: Effects of heat shock on apoptosis related pathways. Heat shock stimulates
  apopotosis via several pathways. It also induces Hsp27 expression, and its phosphorylation.
  Hsp27 in turn acts to offset the potential damage induced by heat shock in part
  through inhibition of apoptosis. It does so at several steps in the apoptotic pathway.
