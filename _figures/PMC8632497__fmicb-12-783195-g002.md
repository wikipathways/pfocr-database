caption: A new plasmid-borne lac operon characterized in Erwinia sp. E602. (A) Lactose-galactose
  metabolic pathway. Gene names are above the arrow, and the yellow box represents
  the downstream metabolic pathway. The red color indicates that the gene is located
  on the plasmid and black means that the gene is located on the chromosome. (B) A
  structure diagram of the new lac operon and its downstream lacI-like gene encoding
  the WP_212408226 protein. The arrows indicate the transcription directions of the
  genes.
