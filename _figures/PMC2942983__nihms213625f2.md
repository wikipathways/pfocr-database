caption: 'The mechanisms by which paraquat enters the cell are still unknown. However,
  it is clear that paraquat can promote the generation of ROS in the cytoplasm by
  three distinct mechanisms including: 1) redox cycling, 2) inhibition of mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, and/or 3) induction/activation of ROS generating enzymes
  such as NADPH-oxidases. Paraquat has also been shown to induce neuronal oxidative
  stress through the activation of glial cells. Accumulation of ROS leads to oxidative
  stress observed by the oxidative modification of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids
  which mediate the activation of cell death signaling cascades. Neuron loss in PD
  is mostly associated with apoptosis, and paraquat-induced apoptosis has been demonstrated
  to involve mainly intrinsic pathways. Oxidative stress can directly induce the activation
  of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. However, paraquat-induced oxidative stress
  has also been suggested to trigger the activation of ASK1/JNK signaling cascade
  through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of IRE1,
  and also by the direct oxidation of Trx. Activation of SAPKs such as JNK has been
  demonstrated to regulate the activation/induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
  members, which can further trigger the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inducing
  cytochrome C (Cyt C) release and the activation of caspases.'
