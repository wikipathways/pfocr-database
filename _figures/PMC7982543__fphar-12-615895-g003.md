caption: Pathological pathway of “Lipid-toxicity Inflammation” or “Dampness-heat Syndrome”—Insulin
  Resistance-Metabolic disease. We try to explain the classic theory of TCM by using
  modern western medicine (MWM). In obese patients with dampness heat syndrome, a
  large amount of free fatty acid (FFA) is produced in the body, causing lipotoxicity,
  called “lipid toxicity or Fei Du”. A large amount of FFA may cause chronic low-grade
  systemic inflammation, which causes “heat” as one symptom of inflammation. These
  may be the modern medical interpretation of “fat makes people hot” in dampness heat
  syndrome. The severity of obesity-type metabolic disorders (diabetes, fatty liver,
  obesity) reflects the degree of inflammatory injury. The activation of various inflammatory
  signaling cascades in chronic low-grade systemic inflammation leads to the activation
  of NF-κB, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and inflammatory bodies, thereby causing
  insulin resistance. The common pathological feature of obese metabolic disorders
  is chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. IR, insulin receptor;
  IRS, insulin receptor substrate; FFA, free fatty acids. The signal pathway map here
  was generated by Adobe Illustrator software.
