caption: Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) as a modulator of signalling pathways
  involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes during different human pathologies.
  In rheumatoid arthritis, RKIP is constitutively expressed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes,
  being capable of decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and MMP’s through
  inhibition of ERK and NF-κB signalling. In diabetic nephropathy, Rituximab is able
  to upregulate RKIP, which in turn inhibits NF-κB pathway, leading to a drug sensitization.
  Likewise, in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), RKIP overexpression decreases NF-κB
  activity and subsequently contributes to the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines, while RKIP silencing activates NF-κB signalling and increases the
  production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Didymin ameliorates liver injury through
  reduction of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and also by enhancing RKIP
  expression, thereby inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. RKIP also plays
  a main role in Th17-mediated immune responses by positively regulating IL-17-induced
  pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
  (EAE). Specifically, RKIP promotes the formation of an IL-17R-Act1 complex, resulting
  in enhanced MAPK- and P65-mediated NF-κB activation and consequently triggering
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This will ultimately
  promote disseminated CNS (central nervous system) inflammation, neuronal demyelination,
  and the development of EAE symptoms. In Parkinson’s disease, RKIP suppresses apoptosis
  and inflammation in MPP+-treated microglial cells through the inactivation of NF-κB
  and MEK/ERK signalling pathways.
