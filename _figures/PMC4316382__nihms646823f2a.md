caption: Combined inhibition of PKCι and Hh signaling inhibits the CSC phenotype.
  A) PKCι regulates multiple signaling pathways that maintain both CSC and bulk tumor
  cells and drives tumor initiation, growth, survival, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.
  In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells harboring 3q26 amplification, PKCι
  phosphorylates SOX2 and regulates SOX2-mediated transcriptional activation of HHAT
  leading to autocrine Hh pathway activation. This PKCι/SOX2/Hh signaling axis is
  required to maintain a CSC phenotype. PKCι also forms an oncogenic complex with
  the polarity protein PAR6 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epithelial
  Cell Transforming Sequence 2 (ECT2) that functions to drive a RAC1/PAK/MEK/ERK signaling
  cascade that transcriptional upregulates Matrix Metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10) to
  promote tumorigenicity of both bulk tumor and cancer stem cells. B) The PKCι inhibitor,
  Auranofin and the SMO inhibitor, LDE225 synergistically block the growth of LSCC
  CSCs. C) PKCι and Hh inhibition transcriptionally downregulate their respective
  transcriptional targets HHAT, GLI1 and MMP10 and combined inhibition of PKCι and
  Hh further downregulates expression of these gene targets. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.
