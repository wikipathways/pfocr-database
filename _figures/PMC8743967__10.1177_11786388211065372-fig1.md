caption: Cysteine turn-over pathways. Cysteines are released from both dietary and
  endogenous protein catabolism in the form of the dimer Cys-S-S-Cys, L-cystine. This
  is then hydrolyzed into cells, consuming GSH, to provide free cysteines on demand.
  Extra amounts of cysteine result from intracellular conversion of methionine/homocysteine
  operated by CBS and CSE (transsulfurations pathway). Free cysteines are available
  for protein synthesis and for GSH de-novo biosynthesis. In alternative, cysteines
  are processed by CBS and CSE working according their alternative pathways or by
  CAT/3MPST to release H2S. Finally, cysteines may generate H2S by non-enzymatic conversion.
  Any excess of free cysteine is immediately removed by CDO so that intracellular
  cysteine concentration remains quite stable.
