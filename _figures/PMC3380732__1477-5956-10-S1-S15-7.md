caption: Analysis of the cell cycle pathway. Selected nodes from the merged cell cycle
  pathway. The original nodes in the pathway are in green. The TFs (squares) and microRNAs
  (triangles) that target them are also included. The differentially expressed gene
  CCND1 is marked in red and the TF TFE3 (putative regulator) is in light blue According
  to the pathway definition in KEGG, SMAD3 promotes the expression of CDKN2B and CDKN2B
  inhibits CCND1 and CDK4. According to our analysis, CCND1 was over-expressed in
  ER+ samples.
