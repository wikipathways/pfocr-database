caption: Flowcharts show, from left to right, a transrectal ultrasonography–guided
  systematic biopsy alone pathway (control), in which all patients with clinical suspicion
  of prostate cancer undergo this procedure; a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plus
  targeted biopsy pathway, in which individuals with a positive prebiopsy MRI undergo
  a transrectal ultrasonography–guided targeted biopsy alone; and an MRI plus targeted
  and systematic biopsy pathway, in which individuals with positive prebiopsy MRI
  findings undergo a transrectal ultrasonography–guided targeted biopsy combined with
  a systematic biopsy. In both hypothetical MRI pathways, individuals with negative
  MRI findings do not undergo a prostate biopsy procedure.
