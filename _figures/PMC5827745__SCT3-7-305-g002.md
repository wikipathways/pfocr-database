caption: 'The BCR‐ABL pathway involves an intricate signaling networks including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK,
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR, TGF‐β, WNT/β‐catenin, Hedgehog, and NOTCH. In the nucleus, the translocation
  from the normal chromosomes 9 to 22 generates the BCR‐ABL hybrid gene, producing
  the constitutively active tyrosine kinase oncoprotein. In the cytosol, the BCR‐ABL
  protein, following recruitment of GRB2/GAB2/SOS complex, stimulates the conversion
  of GDP‐bound form of RAS in its active GTP‐bound state. Therefore, the permanently
  activated RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway leads to an abnormal cell proliferation. In addition,
  the ignition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway causes both the activation of mTOR and
  the inhibition of FOXO3, resulting in LSCs survival. This result is also promoted
  by the activation of TGF‐β/SMAD4 way. Simultaneously, BCR‐ABL supports the novel
  ALOX5 signaling pathway, suppressing the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. The inhibition
  of GSK3 maintained through the deregulation of both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and WNT/β‐catenin
  pathways results in increased cytoplasmatic β‐catenin levels and, therefore, carcinogenesis.
  The progress of the disease in also correlated to Hh pathway, through the release
  of GLI transcription factor, and NOTCH signaling through either the suppression
  of β‐catenin phosphorylation by NICD or NICD inhibition by DSH. Abbreviations: ABL,
