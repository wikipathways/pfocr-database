caption: Sources of OCR and ECAR and metabolite flux in developing embryos. Oxygen
  (O2) is consumed by respiring mitochondria in cells to support oxidative metabolism
  of multiple substrates. Hydrogen ions (H+) are exported from cells with lactate
  but can also be generated from CO2 in the aqueous G-MOPS buffer or co-transported
  into cells along with pyruvate or lactate. The six carbons of glucose can be released
  as CO2 during oxidative metabolism, as two lactate molecules following glycolysis,
  or utilized in the biosynthetic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and one-carbon metabolism
  (1CM) pathway.
