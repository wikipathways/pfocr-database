caption: The NLRP3 inflammasome regulates the caspase-1 dependent maturation and secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome typically requires
  a bimodal signaling pathway. A Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent priming step activates
  the NF-κB-dependent transcription of NLRP3 and the pro-forms of the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (i.e., IL-1β and IL-18). A second signal involves the activation of the
  P2X7R receptor by stimulation with exogenous ATP, which triggers potassium ion (K+)
  efflux. Oligomerization of NLRP3 is followed by recruitment of the adaptor molecule
  ASC and the pro-form of caspase-1, leading to the activation (cleavage) of caspase-1.
  Activated caspase-1 in turn catalyzes the cleavage of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3
  inflammsome may be activated by agents that cause mitochondrial dysfunction, leading
  to the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the
  NLRP3 inflammasome may be activated by particulates such as monosodium urate or
  silica, in a mechanism that may involve disruption of the lysosomes.
