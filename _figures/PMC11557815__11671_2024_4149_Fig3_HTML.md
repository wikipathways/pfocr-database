caption: The impact of P. gingivalis-derived BEMNs containing virulence factors, including
  gingipains (Kgp and RgpA) on the process of inflammation in a vessel wall and ASCVD
  development. A Secretion of BEMNs from P. gingivalis in gingivae. B Penetration
  of P. gingivalis-derived BEMNs into VECs through the lipid microdomains and the
  release of Rgp and Kgp into the cytoplasm. These toxins promote the expression of
  cytokines and chemokines. Putative introduction of engineered BEMNs loaded with
  drugs into VECs and the release of Rgp and Kgp inhibitors. C BEMNs induce degradation
  of cellular tight junctions. BEMN-derived gingipains promote the release of chemokine,
  followed by the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, SMPCs, platelet cells, B
  cells, and T cells into endothelial intima. Gingipains of BEMNs stimulate the expression
  of IFN-γ, which promotes formation of B7-H1 receptors on the surface of monocytes,
  T cells, B cells, and DCs. Differentiation of monocytes in Mphs and DCs; BEMN-derived
  Rgp/Kgp induce dedifferentiation of VSMCs, their phenotypic switching to Mphs-like
  cells, and migration from media to intima. Engulfment of oxLDL and mLDL by monocyte-derived
  Mphs and VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells, followed by their transformation into
  foam cells and AS progression. D Chemokines cause conformational changes of G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) on the immune cell surface thus triggering GTP-ATP-cAMP-PKA pathway
  with subsequent regulation of associated gene expression, leading to ASCVD progression.
  E Growth factors, PDGF, and pro-inflammatory cytokines induce participation of MYOCD-SRF
  regulatory module in “phenotypic switching” of VSMCs
