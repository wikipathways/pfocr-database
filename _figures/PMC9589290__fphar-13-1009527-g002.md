caption: The effect of multiple TCT on CAP. Acupuncture and taVNS stimulating in ear
  branch can activate CAP and the reduce inflammatory cytokines; Auricular acupuncture
  and electroacupuncture “Zusanli” (ST36) increased the activity of local acetylcholine
  transferase, promoted the transcription and synthesis of ACh, inhibiting the expression
  of NF-κB in lung tissue and stimulating the CAP in the lung; Moreover, electroacupuncture
  ST36 activated the vagus nerve pathway connected to the spleen and reduced the production
  of TNF in the spleen; Electroacupuncture “Hegu” (LI4) activates muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor signals in the brain, and then activates the efferent vagus nerve and splenic
  nerve to activate CAP; Electroacupuncture at “Baihui" (GV20) and “Shenting” (GV24)
  increase the expression of α7nAChR in hippocampal neurons; The chinese medcine Jiao-Tai-Wan
  reduced the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and increase the content of
  ACh. The ultimate effect of TCT is to activate CAP to reduce the production of inflammatory
  factors in effector organs to inhibit inflammation.
