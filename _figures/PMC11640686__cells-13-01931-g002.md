  (accessed on 16 November 2024)). Notes: The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
  is involved in a whole range of biological functions, from cell growth to cell differentiation
  and apoptosis. SMAD1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 are receptor-regulated SMADs. They bind to
  membrane-bound serine/threonine receptors and are activated by the kinase activity
  of the receptors. SMAD4 acts as a cofactor that binds to activated R-SMADS (SMADs)
  forming a complex that translocates into the nucleus [63]. Pathway inhibitors: SB431542,
  LY364947, RepSox, Dorsomorphin, LDN193189. The Notch signaling pathway regulates
  cell proliferation, cell fate, differentiation, and cell death in all metazoans.
  The Notch pathway is activated when Delta or Jagged ligands on neighboring cells
  activate cleavage of the receptor releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD).
  The Notch pathway plays a role in specifying neural subtypes [64]. Pathway inhibitors:
  DAPT, LY411575. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulates several developmental
  processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, morphogenesis,
  and patterning. FGF signaling via MEK/ERK is critical for self-renewal and proliferation
  of human PSCs [65]. The WNT signaling pathway is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved
  pathway that regulates crucial aspects of cell fate determination, cell migration,
  cell polarity, neural patterning, and organogenesis during embryonic development
  [66]. Pathway activators: CHIR99021, SB216763; pathway inhibitors: IWR-1-endo. The
  Hedgehog (Shh) pathway is important in post-embryonic tissue regeneration and repair
  processes. Specifically, Shh signaling is implicated in the induction of multifarious
  neuronal populations in central nervous system [67]. Pathway activators: Purmorphamine,
  SAg. The RHO/ROCK pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and plays an important
  role in cell adhesion, proliferation, motility, contraction, and apoptosis. Loss
  of cadherin or integrin binding activates the Rho pathway in human PSCs, leading
  to anoikis [68]. Pathway inhibitors: Y-27632, thiazovivin. The 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger important in reprogramming and differentiation
  for many cell subtypes [69]. Pathway activator: forskolin. The protein kinase C
  (PKC) family of kinases is commonly activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium
  and is involved in several signaling pathways that can regulate differentiation
  [70]. Pathway activators: prostaglandin E2, (−)-Indolactam V; pathway inhibitors:
  HA-100, GO6983. Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent morphogen required for embryonic
  development. RA acts in a paracrine fashion to shape the developing eye and is essential
  for normal optic vesicle and anterior segment formation [71]. Activators: 9-cis
  retinoic acid, all-trans retinoic acid, CD437, TTNPB. RAR, RXR -RA receptors. Epigenetic
  marks such as acetylation (Ac) of histones and methylation (Me) of histones or DNA
  serve to induce or inhibit gene expression in a heritable manner. Global changes
  in epigenetic marks are critical for reprogramming [35]. DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors:
  RG108; histone methyltransferase inhibitors: BIX01294; histone demethylase inhibitors:
  tranylcypromine; histone acetyltransferase inhibitors: garcinol; histone deacetylase
  inhibitors: sodium butyrate, trichostatin A, valproic acid'
