caption: The complex mechanism of KA-induced neuronal damage includes a sequence of
  events and its outcome varies depending on the administration route. A, The intraperitoneal
  route of KA administration is realized through an injection of the drug into the
  peritoneal cavity (1). The molecules then get absorbed by blood vessels (2) and
  travel to the brain, where they pass the blood-brain barrier via passive diffusion
  (3). B, The intracerebral administration can be performed in various zones but the
  most common are intraventricular (1) and intrahippocampal (2). In case of intraventricular
  injection, the drug molecules diffuse directly into the cells surrounding the ventricle
  wall and another part is taken by the blood vessels to be distributed throughout
  the entire brain. Intrahippocampal administration, on the contrary, provides a more
  localised damage, as KA molecules activate KA receptors in the hippocampus at the
  site of injection. C, The intranasal route starts with the injection of KA in the
  nasal cavity (1), where the molecules are absorbed by receptors of the olfactory
  epithelium (2), from where they travel through the olfactory pathway to the hippocampus
  and other areas of the brain (3). D, KA, once having reached the brain tissue, initiates
  a cascade of events First, it binds to the KARs, causing membrane depolarization
  and cell firing (1). Excessive firing can lead to osmotic imbalance and, eventually,
  rupture of the postsynaptic membrane (2). At the same time, influx of calcium into
  the cell results in multiple enzymes activation, such as phospholipase, endonucleases
  and proteases, all of which damage various cell structures (3). Additional effect
  of an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration is mitochondrial disfunction, and
  excessive production of reactive oxygen species (4). All these mechanisms potentiate
  each other and terminate in apoptosis (5). BBB — blood-brain barrier, ER — endoplasmatic
  reticulum, HC — hippocampus, KAR — kainic acid receptor, OB — olfactory bulb, ORs
  — olfactory receptors, ROS — reactive oxygen species.
