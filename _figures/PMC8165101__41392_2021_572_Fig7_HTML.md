caption: Molecular process of DNA damage repair related to PARP and the mechanism
  of action of PARP inhibitors. Endogenous single-strand breaks (SSB) are repaired
  mostly by PARP-dependent base excision repair (BER) pathway. PARP inhibitors suppress
  the repair of SSB and the unrepaired SSB can be converted to double-strand breaks
  (DSB) that are toxic to cells. Homologous recombination (HR) is the major pathway
  to repair DSB. However, the DSB in BRCA1/2 mutant cells cannot be repaired through
  HR, thus resulting in genomic instability and cell death. Figure created with BioRender.com
