caption: IL-10-mediated modulation of myeloid cells. IL-10 binds to a tetrameric receptor
  consisting of two IL-10Rα and two IL-10Rβ subunits. 1. IL-10/IL-10R interaction
  leads to JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation and the consequent STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation.
  P-STATs, and in particular P-STAT3, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where
  it promotes the transcription of specific molecules (i.e., SOCS3) or transcription
  factors (i.e., BCL3 and NFIL3), and inhibits the transport of MHC class II to the
  plasma membrane. 2. IL-10 signaling inhibits LPS-mediated activation of IKK that
  in turn prevents NF-kB-p65/p50 nuclear translocation and the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine. In parallel, IL-10 promotes the selective NF-kB-p50/p50 nuclear translocation,
  which concurs in downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and, in association
  with BCL3, promotes IL-10 expression. 3. IL-10 inhibits PI3K/Akt pathway that prevents
  LPS-mediated activation of MyD88, resulting in the inhibition of the expression
  of IRF-3 and IRF-8. 4. IL-10-mediated inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway leads to GSK3β
  and MITF activation, responsible for the upregulation of the transcription of GPNMB.
  5. IL-10 downmodulates LPS-induced expression of miR155, which directly inhibits
  SHIP1 and favors the negative regulation of TLR4 signaling by counteracting PI3K
  activity. 6. IL-10 enhances LPS-mediated induction of miR146b and miR187, which
  post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA encoding for TNF-α and reduce IL-6 and IL-12p40
  transcription via inhibition of the transcription factor IkB. TYK, tyrosine kinase;
