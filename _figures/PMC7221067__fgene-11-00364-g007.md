caption: Schematic representation of potential CSW-dependent mechanisms for life span
  regulation. CSW-mediated life span modulation depending on organs regulating energy
  resources acquired by feeding, like gut, fat body, and neurons. Arrows between them
  indicate subsequent effects. Through the insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)
  pathway, CSW in fat body and neurons produced systemic effect on all peripheral
  tissues such as metabolic homeostasis and aging delay. Likely, CSW acting in gut
  mediates IIS pathway-dependent local effects (see ). Different tissues are not equally
  sensitive to loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) csw alleles.
