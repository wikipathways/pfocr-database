caption: The ROS/NLRP3 signaling pathway participates in sepsis-related immune responses.
  The sepsis associated oxidative stress induces ROS generation via oxidation of mitochondria.
  PAMPs/DAMPs trigger P2X7 activation and promote Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. Increased
  Ca2+ influx (calcium overload) and ROS destroy the stability of mitochondria, triggering
  mtDNA and cytochrome C accumulation within the cytoplasm, to assemble NLRP3 inflammasomes
  and induce apoptosis. LPS activates TLR4/NF-κB signaling to express pro-IL-1β and
  pro-IL-18. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-lβ and pro-IL-18 into their mature
  forms to increase the inflammatory response. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasomes depend
  on caspase-1 to mediate immune cell apoptosis. During the whole process, autophagy
  is activated by ROS to clear mtDNA, and to partially reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein
  3; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; PAMPs/DAMPs, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns; mtDNA, mitochondrial
  DNA.
