caption: Interactions between NK cells and senescent cells. In response to DNA damage,
  MICA is selectively expressed on senescent cells rather than proliferative cells.
  MICA interacts with NKG2D and activates NK cells via ITAM. Activated NK cells produce
  and secrete granzyme B and perforin to kill senescent cells. Shedding MICA from
  the senescent cell membrane surface leads to NK cells off-target and senescent cell
  evasion. HLA-E is upregulated by the p38 pathway. HLA-E binds to NKG2A and inhibits
  NK cell activation via the ITIM on the NKG2A intracellular segment. CD155 exerts
  dual effects as its combination with DNAM-1 activates NK cells while its combination
  with CD94 or TIGHT inhibits NK cell activation. Shedding CD155 participates is involved
  in the evasion of senescent cells as its binding affinity to DNAM-1 is higher than
  that to TIGHT and CD94. The expression of MICA and CD155 is directly regulated by
  transcriptional factor E2F1. uPAR is specifically expressed on the senescent cell
  membrane surface, and CAR-T therapy targeting uPAR has been designed to eliminate
  senescence. DPP4 has been treated as a target of immunotherapy via ADCC. NKG2D,
  natural killer group 2, member D; HLA-E, human leukocyte antigen-E; IL-6, interleukin-6;
