caption: 'Results show the expression of genes involved in: (A) DNA damage checkpoints
  (sensors, mediators, transducers and effectors of double and single strand break
  (DSB; SSB)); (B) DSB repair mechanisms (non homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous
  recombination (HR)); (C) SSB repair mechanisms (base excision repair (BER), nucleotide
  excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR) and direct DNA repair (DDR)) were analyzed
  during primary and secondary CD8 responses generated in the absence of CD4 cells
  using mouse DNA damage signaling pathway and the DNA repair RT2 profiler PCR arrays
  (Qiagen). For each experiment, CD8 T cells were pooled from 4 mice in primary responses
  and 4–6 in secondary responses. The average expression level of unmodified housekeeping
  genes selected among the five included was used for normalization. Results are expressed
  as fold change relative to reference samples (naïve cells in primary responses;
  memory cells in secondary responses) and represent the average of 3 to 4 independent
  experiments. Primary responses are shown in blue; secondary responses in red. Up
  and down arrows indicate up and down regulation respectively; rectangles indicate
  no significant changes in gene expression. Asterisks indicate statistical significance:
  *, p < 0,05; **, p ≤ 0,01; ***, p ≤ 0,001.'
