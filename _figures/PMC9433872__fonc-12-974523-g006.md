caption: The regulatory mechanism of LIN28 in breast cancer. LIN28 can block the production
  of let-7 miRNA and disinhibit the target genes of let-7 miRNA (RAS, MYC and HMGA2),
  thus promoting the migration of breast cancer cells. Inhibition of CAIX will affect
  let-7/LIN28 axis and related metabolic pathways. CREB1 binds to the promoter of
  LIN28, activates LIN28/miR-638/VASP pathway, and promotes the proliferation and
  migration of breast cancer cells. LIN28 can recruit MSI2, directly induce the mRNA
  decay of upstream kinase of YAP1, and negatively regulate Hippo pathway, leading
  to the activation of YAP1, thus enhancing CSC like characteristics, tumorigenesis
  and metastasis in TNBC cells. Arrows indicate activation and blunted lines indicate
  inhibition.
