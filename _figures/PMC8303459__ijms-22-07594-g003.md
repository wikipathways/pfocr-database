caption: 'Activation of ERK5 by drugs inhibiting the mevalonate pathway and correlation
  between CDC42 function and ERK5 activity: (a), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzym-A-reduktase
  inhibitors (statins), a group of cholesterol-lowering drugs, and N-bisphosphonates
  (N-BP), used for osteoporosis treatment, activate ERK5 via inhibition of the mevalonate
  biosynthesis pathway. By inhibition at different stages of the mevalonate cascade,
  both drugs interfere with prenylation and subsequent membrane localization of small
  GTPases such as CDC42, thus stalling them in a functionally inactive stage []. Functional
  inactivation of CDC42 leads to elevated ERK5 activity, which can be also mimicked
  by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDC42 [,]. Activated ERK5 also inhibits PAK1 expression,
  thereby interfering with downstream effects of CDC42 []; (b), inverse correlation
  of ERK5 and CDC42 activity in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and differentiated osteoblasts.
  While ERK5 activity is high in MSCs, it drops during osteogenic differentiation
  [,]. Conversely, CDC42 activity is low in MSCs and rises during the differentiation
  process [,].'
