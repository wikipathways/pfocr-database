caption: Obesity-associated SRC-1 variants. A, SRC-1 modulates the leptin signaling
  pathway. On leptin binding, the leptin receptor (LEPR) phosphorylates JAK2, which
  in turn activates STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it binds to the POMC promoter. SRC-1 and other coactivators
  are recruited as part of a coactivator/corepressor complex and initiate transcription
  of the neuropeptide Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which reduces food intake in the
  fed state. B, Rare variants in SRC-1 identified in individuals with severe early-onset
  obesity. Variants previously reported () and found to cause a loss of function are
  denoted in black and located above the protein; newly identified variants are denoted
  in gray, below the protein. AD, activating domains 1 and 2; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix;
  HAT, histone acetyl transferase domain; NRID, nuclear receptor interacting domain;
  PAS, Per-Arnt-Sim (A and B) domains; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator-1.
