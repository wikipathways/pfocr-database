  B) Heat maps based on 371 genes derived from Student''s T test: comparison between
  the heat map obtained using our dataset (A) and an independent dataset derived from
  Genomics and bioinformatics groups, LMP, CCR, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
  MD (B). IPA based on the 317 differentially expressed genes (derived from Student''s
  T test p < 0.01) with functional annotations, constructed a primary network centered
  on NF-KB signaling (C) and a second ranking network centered on TGF-β and Interferon-α/β
  signaling (D) where genes up-regulated or down-regulated in higher permissive cell
  lines are respectively indicated in red and green. E) A canonical pathway analysis
  related to assembly of the RNA polymerase II complex also showed a down-regulation
  of this pathway in higher permissive cell lines.'
