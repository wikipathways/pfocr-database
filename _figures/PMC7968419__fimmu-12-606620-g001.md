caption: Schematic presentation of possible cross-linkages between PCOS and HT. Involvement
  of the most important genetic factors and molecular pathways. Treg cell dysregulation
  emerges as a critical point in the genetic and functional network linking the two
  diseases. In PCOS, genetic variation emphasizes the contribution of both hormonal
  imbalance (gonadotropins, androgens, and female sex hormones) and metabolic factors
  (IR and INS secretion), often interacting through a feedback loop. Suppression of
  TGF-β signaling pathway in combination with IR may lead to dysregulation of Treg
  cells and promotion of autoimmunity in women with PCOS (red line connections). Possible
  interaction of ncRNA (miRNA, lncRNA) with TGF-β signaling. The most important genes
  are indicated in blue; darker blue designates susceptibility genes for both diseases.
