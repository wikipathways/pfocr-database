caption: Cellular retinoic acid synthesis and metabolism in chordates. Retinol bound
  to plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) is transferred to cytosol via STRA6 receptor,
  where aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH) and retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) convert it to
  retinaldehyde, and finally retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) convert retinaldehyde
  to retinoic acid (RA). Subsequently, the synthesized RA binds to cytoplasmic retinoic
  acid binding protein-2 (CRABP-2) and regulates target gene transcription.
