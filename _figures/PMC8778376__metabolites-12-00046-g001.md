caption: 'Schematic representation of how autonomous oncometabolites affect the development
  of CRC: (a) In the absence of glucose, the oncogenic Kras signaling upregulates
  the expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the enzyme involved in conversion
  of aspartate (ASP) to asparagine (ASN), which in turn promotes proliferation. (b)
  KRAS and BRAF mutations lead to upregulation of the glucose and glutamine transporters
  SLC2A1 and SLC1A5 (Solute carrier family 2 and 5 member), respectively, which leads
  to an increased glutamine and glucose uptake that is crucial to sustain cancer cell
  proliferation. (c) Activation of the Wnt pathway suppresses oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) and favors activation of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway, which leads
  to increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn
  supports tumor angiogenesis and proliferation. (d) The accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate
  (D-2HG) stimulates the expression of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) markers
  and anti-apoptotic genes, thereby promoting proliferation, invasiveness, and reduced
  apoptosis. (e) Kynurenine pathway metabolites (KPMs) accumulate in the cell due
  to the overexpression of the membrane solute carrier LAT1 (L-type/large amino acid
  transporter 1), which trigger the PI3K-AKT and β-catenin pathways to activate genes
  involved in proliferation. Moreover, kynurenine promotes the nuclear translocation
  of AHR (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor), which process leads to increased proliferation.'
