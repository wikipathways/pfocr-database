caption: 'Summary of expression patterns of complement components in the placenta.
  Our findings are highlighted in black arrows (PE: preeclampsia, LO-PE: late-onset
  preeclampsia). Pictured are the components that we studied in their respective position
  in the activation cascade (green solid lines and shapes) or regulatory network (red
  dotted lines and shapes). The C system is composed of approximately 20 plasma proteins,
  which can be activated in a stepwise cascade via the classical (CP, via Ag-Ig: immunocomplexes
  or CRP: C-reactive protein), lectin (LP), or the alternative pathway (AP). In addition,
  there are approximately 15 components that act as receptors or protective molecules
  on cell membranes. All three pathways result in the activation of the main complement
  component C3 and thereafter of the terminal pathway causing the formation of membrane
  attack complexes (MACs) and ultimately target cell damage. C5b (not studied, in
  gray) is the activated component at the onset of terminal pathway. FH is a regulator
  of the alternative pathway, where its main role is to act as a cofactor for Factor
  I in the cleavage of C3b into iC3b. Similarly in the classical pathway, cleavage
  of C4 to activated form C4b is inhibited by a potent regulator C4bp. C3b and C4b
  are both generated by activation of not only the classical, but of the lectin pathway
  as well. C1q is a potent activator of the classical pathway. Binding of the complex
  (C1qr2s2) activates the C4 step. Together with decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55)
  and membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), C4bp regulates the progression of the
  classical C pathway by controlling the formation and function of the classical pathway
  C3 convertase, C4b2a. Like FH, MCP can also act as a cofactor in C3b inactivation.
  In the classical pathway, DAF accelerates the disassembly of C4b2a and in the alternative
  pathway that of C3bBb. DAF is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane molecule.
  Complement receptor type 1(CR1, CD35) is a membrane-bound regulator expressed primarily
  by bone-marrow derived cells.'
