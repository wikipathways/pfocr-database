caption: The role of the JAK/STAT pathway in COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response.
  The SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm. IL-6 binds to the soluble or membrane-bound
  receptor, forming a complex with ubiquitously expressed gp130 protein. The intracellular
  domain of gp130 activates JAK/STAT and downstream signaling pathways that promote
  the expression of pro-inflammatory genes involved in inflammation and tissue damage.
  Antagonists of IL-6 (tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab) antagonize ligand-receptor
  engagement and prevent IL-6 mediated signaling. sgp130Fc is an exclusive inhibitor
  of IL-6 trans-signaling. Baricitinib, Tofacitinib, and Ruxolitinib inhibit activation
  of JAKs and prevent activation of immune cells and inflammatory reactions.
