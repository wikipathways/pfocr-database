caption: Model for HAMP- and PAMP-induced signalling pathway. The perception of OGs
  by their receptor/s or Flg22 by FLS2 activates AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 that subsequently
  trigger gene expression and AtrbohD-mediated ROS production, callose accumulation
  and other defence responses. Responses activated independently of ROS (such as PAD3
  expression) are required for resistance against Botrytis cinerea, whereas ROS-dependent
  responses restrict bacterial growth.
