  relationships (links) based on (a) shared genes (gray solid lines), shared symptoms
  (orange dashed lines) and comorbidity (blue sinusoidal lines); (b) shared pathways
  (gray solid lines) using common disease and pathway genes, (c) shared pathways (gray
  solid lines) using the proximity of the pathway genes to the diseases genes in the
  interactome.
