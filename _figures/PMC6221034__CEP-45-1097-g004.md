caption: Scheme of ROS‐related tubular damage in acute kidney injury (AKI). In sepsis,
  TLR4 recognizes LPS and transduces it by downstream signalling mainly through the
  NF‐κB signalling pathway. This in turn increases the secretion of cytokines and
  mediators, including TNF‐α and IL‐1β, which promote H2O2 generation and exacerbate
  the inflammatory response. Mitochondria in tubular cells increase O2˙− production
  in ischaemic reperfusion injury. Pericytes, which can be detached from endothelial
  cells in injured kidneys, express and release VAP‐1, which catalyzes the oxidative
  deamination of primary amines, resulting in the production of H2O2 in the extracellular
  space. This generates a local H2O2 gradient, which in turn enhances the recruitment
  of neutrophils in ischaemia reperfusion kidney injury. Nrf2 translocates to the
  nucleus and binds to antioxidant‐related elements in the promoter regions of antioxidants,
  including SOD. LPS, lipopolysaccharide, TLR4, Toll‐like receptor 4; NF‐κB, nuclear
  factor‐κB; TNF‐α, tumour necrosis factor‐α; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1β; VAP‐1, vascular
  adhesion protein‐1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; BM, basement membrane
