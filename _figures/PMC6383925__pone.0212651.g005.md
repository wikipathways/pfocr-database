caption: Under phosphate-limiting conditions, phosphate may be recycled from PC via
  phospholipase C activity. We note however that an equivalent of the F. graminearum
  PC-PLC enzyme has not been identified in C. neoformans or S. cerevisiae. The DAG
  backbone of PC, which includes its fatty acids, is then incorporated into DGTS in
  a 2-step process via the betaine lipid synthase BTA1.
