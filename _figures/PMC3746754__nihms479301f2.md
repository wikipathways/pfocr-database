caption: Transferrin has two iron binding sites which have high affinity for Fe (III).
  Diferric transferrin binds to transferrin receptor-1 (TrF-1) which is then endocytosed.
  The endocytic vesicle is acidified by the actions of a vesicular ATPase (V-ATPase)
  which is a proton pump, actively moving H+ into the vesicle. At low pH, transferrin
  releases its cargo of iron which can leave the endocytic vesicle either through
  ferroportin or by co-transport with H+ through the divalent metal transporter-1
  (DMT1). Iron may then transit through what is called the labile iron pool (LIP)
  to sites of storage or utilization, or may leave the cell through ferroportin present
  in the plasma membrane. Iron can also enter the LIP from heme which is broken down
  by heme oxygenase. Iron brought into the cells can regulate the activities of the
  iron regulatory proteins-1 and -2 (), which in turn regulate proteins involved in
  iron metabolism. It can also be chaperoned by PCBP1 to safe storage in ferritin.
  The protein hepcidin regulates ferroportin levels by triggering its degradation.
  In turn, hepcidin is regulated by HFE which triggers an increase in hepcidin synthesis.
  HFE is normally bound to transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1), but the binding site is
  also recognized by diferric transferrin which competes with HFE for binding. The
  HFE is released and binds to transferrin receptor-2 (TfR-2) which triggers a signaling
  pathway up-regulating hepcidin. The movement of iron out of the cell by ferroportin
  is enhanced by the ferroxidase activities of ceruloplasmin (Cp) and/or hephaestin.
  In this figure, dotted lines indicate movement and solid lines indicate descriptors.
  The labile iron pool (LIP) is surrounded by a dotted line indicating that the LIP
  is not a discrete entity located within an organelle, but likely exists throughout
  the cytoplasm.
