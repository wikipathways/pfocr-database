caption: 'Expression pattern of genes involved in early symbiotic nodulation. a Expression
  pattern of key genes under cold stress. b Expression pattern of key genes under
  dehydration stress. c Expression pattern of key genes under high salinity stress.
  Additional abbreviations are as follows: NFR (nod factor receptor); DMI (does not
  make infections); NSP (Nodulation signalling pathway); ERN (ERF required for nodulation);
  and ENOD (early nodule). Filled colours correspond with their degree of regulation
  by the stresses'
