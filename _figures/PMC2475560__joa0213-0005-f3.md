caption: Schematic diagram illustrating how A-type lamins in association with other
  INM proteins modulate different signalling pathways that participate in either adult
  stem cell maintenance (TGF-β pathway) or growth-related stress responses (Ras/MAPK
  pathway). In the TGF-β pathway, TGF-β ligands in the extracellular space bind to
  dimerized TGF-β serine/threonine kinase receptors (type I and type II R) found on
  the plasma membrane. Ligand-receptor binding results in the phosphorylation of the
  receptor Smads 2/3, which disassociate from the receptor and form a heteromeric
  complex with the co-mediator Smad 4 in the cytoplasm, which can then translocate
  across the nuclear membrane. A-type lamins alone or together with the INM protein
  MAN1 bind to the Smad complex in the nucleus and inhibit their activation of transcription
  factors (TF) and target genes. In the Ras/MAPK pathway, growth factors in the extracellular
  matrix bind to heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or receptor tyrosine
  kinases (not shown) on the plasma membrane. This leads to the activation of the
  G protein Ras (in a complex with Grb2 and SOS proteins) through GDP/GTP exchange,
  which is then free to bind to serine/threonine protein kinase Raf and/or G protein
  Rac (not shown). In the cytosol, downstream kinase cascade from Raf includes phosphorylation
  of protein kinase MEK 1/2, which leads to activation and enhanced phosphorylation
  of ERK 1/2 dimers and their subsequent translocation across the nuclear membrane.
  A-type lamins alone or together with some unknown INM proteins may bind to phosphorylated
  ERK 1/2 and inhibit their activation of transcription factors (TF) and gene expression.
  Grb, growth factor receptor-bound protein; SOS, son-of-sevenless; GDP/GTP, guanosine
  di/triphosphate; MEK, mitogen- or extracellular signal-related kinase.
