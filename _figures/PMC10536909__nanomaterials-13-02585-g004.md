caption: The Arabidopsis cryptochrome photocycle. This figure represents a composite
  consistent with published data. In the dark, cryptochromes are in the inactive state
  (C-terminal domain folded against the protein, flavin in the oxidized redox state).
  Upon illumination with blue light (wavelengths below 500 nm), flavin undergoes photoreduction
  to the FADH° redox form (rate constant k1) by forward electron transfer via the
  Trp triad pathway []. This event triggers conformational change and unfolding of
  the C-terminal domain to give the activated form of the receptor, which is thereby
  accessible for signaling partner binding. Subsequent illumination of FADH° with
  an additional photon of either blue or green light (wavelengths below 600 nm) can
  induce further reduction to the (FADH−) inactive redox form (k2), although at much
  lower efficiency than k1. Reoxidation to the resting (FADox) state from FADH° occurs
  spontaneously in the presence of molecular oxygen, with a rate constant (k1b) of
  several minutes, and is accompanied by the formation of ROS and H2O2. More rapid
  reoxidation occurs from the FADH− redox form to FADox by an alternate pathway involving
  formation of transient oxygen and flavin radical intermediates [,]. Changes in rate
  constants k2b and k1b would explain the change in biological activity under applied
  magnetic field conditions. Reprinted with permission from []. Copyright 2016, Elsevier.
