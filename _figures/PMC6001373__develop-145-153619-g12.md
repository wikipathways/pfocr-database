caption: Working model for the actions of HDAC1/2 in the regulation of nephrogenesis.
  HDAC1/2 perform sequential functions during NPC and epithelial differentiation.
  (A) In the NPCs, HDAC1/2 are recruited (possibly by Six2/Sall1) to Six2 enhancer
  where they serve a positive regulatory role. HDAC1/2 also interact with Osr1 in
  the maintenance of NPCs. (B) HDAC1/2 in the NPCs and/or nascent nephrons restrain
  Wnt protein activity in adjacent stroma via unknown mechanisms. (C) HDAC1/2 directly
  or indirectly regulate the RV transcriptional network (Pax8/Fgf8/Lhx1) upstream
  of the Notch/HNF1A/HNF4A pathway. The dotted line indicates that NPC-specific deletion
  of HDAC1/2 arrests nephrogenesis at the RV stage.
