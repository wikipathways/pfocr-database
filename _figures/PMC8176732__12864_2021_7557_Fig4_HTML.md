caption: Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation. a Schematic
  representation for tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) adapted from Wikimedia Commons
  (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cycle_de_krebs.png). For each step of the
  TCA cycle intermediate products, enzymes (bold) and coenzymes (FAD and NAD+) are
  indicated. For each enzyme, heatmaps show relative expression (z-score)in females
  from T0 to T14d. b KEGG pathway diagram (map 00190) including gene expression results
  for the five genes among the DEGs in N. flemingeri. The upper part of the figure
  shows the five respiratory chain complexes with the corresponding E.C. numbers for
  each enzyme. In the bottom part, heatmaps show relative expression (z-score) of
  each enzyme associated with the respiratory chain complex in females from T0 to
  T14d. All enzymes shown were identified as DEGs. Copyright permission to use and
