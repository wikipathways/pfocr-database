caption: (A) APN regulates a SDF-1 chemotactic gradient for BMSCs migration from the
  bone marrow to the circulation by increasing SDF-1 concentration in circulation
  and decreasing SDF-1 expression in bone marrow after injury. Bone marrow-derived
  MSCs express CXCR4 receptor and follow the favorable gradient to repair the bone
  defect. MMP9 expression is increased and facilitates recruitment of MSC to the circulation.(B)
  Simplified representation of AdipoR1 signal transduction pathway in osteoblastic
  cells. AdipoR1, CK2, and Smad1/5/8 form an inactive complex in the absence of APN.
  APN treatment disassembles the complex and releases Smad1/5/8 for phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation. Once at the nucleus, pSmad1/5/8 activates SDF-1 expression.
