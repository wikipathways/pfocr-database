caption: Autophagy and the inflammasome. TLR signaling results in the activation of
  NF-κB which in turn regulates the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA can lead to the activation and oligomerization
  of NLRP3 and recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC. This complex recruit and activates
  caspase 1 subsequently, recruiting, and activating IL-1β. Autophagy is also induced
  by TLR signaling which in turn can regulate the inflammasome pathway via direct
  clearance of activators (mitochondria), inflammasomes and subunits (NLRP3, ASC)
  as well as its substrates (pro-IL-1β). In the absence of autophagy, damaged mitochondria
  can accumulate and activate the inflammasome pathway leading to the dysregulation
  of IL-1β production and secretion.
