caption: Glucose and glycerol co-utilization strategies in microbes. (a) Glucose and
  glycerol co-utilization strategy for the production of redox-demanding products.
  Black-colored arrows indicate the native metabolic pathways. Blue-colored arrows
  indicate the chemical biosynthesis pathways of glycerol. (b) Glucose and glycerol
  synergetic utilization strategy for the production of glucose derived products.
  Black-colored arrows indicate the native metabolic pathways; blue-colored arrows
  indicate the main metabolic pathways of glycerol for cell growth; and purple-colored
  arrows indicate the chemical biosynthesis pathways of glucose. G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; DHA, dihydroxyacetone; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PYR, pyruvate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway; PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; glpF, glycerol facilitator;
  glpK, glycerol kinase; gldA, glycerol dehydrogenase; glf, glucose facilitator; PTS,
