caption: LIF protects cardiac myocytes by both genomic and non-genomic means. Dimerization
  of gp130 and LIFR activates the associated JAK tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate
  recruitment sites for STAT3 and STAT1 (YXXQ), and a scaffold protein SHP2 (YXXV)
  that is coupled to ERK1/2, ERK5, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt activation.
  STAT3 and the SHP2-based signaling pathways are linked to cellular protection and/or
  cell growth. JAK-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation on Y705 enhances its dimerization
  and DNA binding. Activated STAT3 induces expression of anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative
  stress, and pro-angiogenic genes, and STAT3 S727 phosphorylation boosts gene transcription.
  In the nucleus, U-STAT3 may affect gene expression either as a transcription factor
  or by modulating chromatin structure. In parallel, STAT3 has protective actions
  on mitochondrial function. STAT3 optimizes mitochondrial respiration and limits
  ROS formation, thereby opposing mPTP opening and ensuring mitochondrial integrity.
  These non-genomic actions of STAT3 are enhanced by S727 phosphorylation. ERK1/2
  and Akt are components of the RISK pathway of cardiac protection that is evoked
  by pre- and postconditioning. ERK1/2 has protective effects on mitochondria via
  phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3-α/β, which prevents mPTP opening. PI3K-Akt
  signaling also inhibits opening of mPTP via phosphorylation of GSK3-α/β or mitochondrial
  hexokinase II (HKII). See text for additional details. Adapted with permission from
