caption: Correlation between inflammasomes and HSCT. A Initially, conditioning regimens
  lead to extensive tissue damage throughout the body, triggering substantial PAMPs
  and DAMPs. These molecules activate inflammasomes in APCs and other cell types,
  amplifying inflammatory signals by enhancing the function of APCs. Additionally,
  they suppress anti-inflammatory cells and release further DAMPs. Inflammasomes also
  impact the structural integrity of intestinal cells and regulate the secretion of
  antimicrobial peptides. B In the second phase, donor T cells are activated after
  interacting with APCs. Inflammasomes affect the migration and antigen-presenting
  abilities of APCs. They also regulate T cell responses by promoting the maturation
  of CD8+ T cells and driving CD4+ T cells towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, accelerating
  the progression of GVHD. C During the third phase, effector cells execute their
  functions through various molecular mechanisms. CD8+ T cells induce cell damage
  via Fas-Fas ligand (FasL), perforin/granzyme, and TNF pathways. The cytotoxic effect
  of CD8+ T cells is further enhanced by inflammasomes. Moreover, inflammasomes influence
  the proliferation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells and regulate the secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the development of GVHD
