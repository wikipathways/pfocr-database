caption: Migration of opioid-containing immune cells and opioid release within inflamed
  tissue. Adhesion molecules interact with their respective ligands to facilitate
  endothelial transmigration of immune cells. In response to stress or releasing agents
  (e.g., CRF, IL-1, CXCL8), the immune cells secrete opioid peptides. Opioid peptides
  or exogenous opioids bind to opioid receptors on primary afferent neurons, leading
  to analgesia. Direct adhesion between opioid-containing immune cells and peripheral
  sensory neurons (via ICAM-1 and/or NCAM) may be necessary to release opioid peptides
  within the effective range of peripheral opioid receptors. The immune cells, depleted
  of opioids, then migrate to regional lymph nodes. The arrows denote an increased
  expression within inflamed tissue of cell adhesion molecules, opioid receptors,
  endogenous opioid peptides, and receptors for ligands that trigger opioid release
  on the surface of immune cells (e.g., CXCR2, IL-1 receptors, CRF receptors). This
  all enhances the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of the peripheral opioid
  pathway in inflammatory conditions.
