caption: Overview of the Th17 pathway. T-helper (Th) 17 cells undergo differentiation
  from Th0 cells. The first step involves transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß and interleukin
  (IL)-21 that initiate the differentiation. Next, IL-6 and IL-1ß amplify the Th17
  lineage and finally, IL-23 is required to maintain the lineage and to acquire its
  pathogenic role. Th17 differentiation can be shifted towards regulatory T (Treg)
  cells depending on cytokine environment. Developmental pathways of both cells are
  interconnected and reciprocally inhibited. Treg lacking exon 2 of FoxP3 impairs
  the Th17/Treg balance with increase amount of IL-17+ T cells. These Δexon 2 FoxP3
  Treg cells, and some Tregs in inflammatory conditions, can also produce IL-17. Moreover,
  IL-17A/F/AF are produced by Th17 cells but also by other immune cells. These cytokines
  bind the same receptor, activate different pathways and finally induce inflammation.
  IL-17 function is regulated positively or negatively by different mediators.
