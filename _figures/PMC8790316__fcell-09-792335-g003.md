caption: 'The mechanisms of PS involved in coagulation. During the initiation step
  of the coagulation cascade, PS exposure mediates TF decryption initiating the extrinsic
  coagulation pathway. TF/FVIIa complex can then activate FIX and FX. Subsequently,
  FXa assembles with FVa on the surface of monocytes, and the prothrombinase complex
  generates thrombin by cleavage of prothrombin in blood plasma. During the amplification
  phase, thrombin activates circulating FV and FVIII, causing its release from vWF.
  Subsequently, FVIIIa and FVa combine with PS-rich phospholipids on the activated
  PLTs surface. Following ECs activation, increased P-selectin and vWF expression
  initiate PLTs adhesion to the endothelium through binding with PLTs PSGL-1 and glycoprotein
  GP Ib/IX/V complex, respectively. ICAM-1 promotes PLTs adhesion via binding of fibrinogen
  with GPIIb/IIIa on the PLTs membrane. Moreover, exposed subendothelial collagen
  promotes PLTs adhesion and activation by binding to GPVI, eventually leading to
  PLTs aggregation. Activated PLTs release mediators, especially ADP and TXA2, which
  attract circulating platelets to the growing thrombus. PLTs activate FXII by MPs
  formation and poly P release, and increase the generation of fibrin. In the propagation
  phase, exposed PS facilitates the assembly of the tenase and prothrombinase complexes
  of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin cleaves soluble fibrinogen into fibrin and
  activates FXIII, which forms cross-linked and stable fibrin. The above coagulation
  processes ultimately lead to platelet activation and thrombus formation. ECs: Endothelial
