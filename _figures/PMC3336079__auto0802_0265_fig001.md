caption: The NFκB pathway induces glucose import to support survival of B-cell lymphomas;
  autophagy prolongs survival after NFκB inhibition. Stimulation of NFκB by TLRs or
  EBV-LMP1 promotes GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane at two distinct points.
  IKKβ and PtdIns3K cooperate to activate AKT, whereas NFκB-driven transcription is
  essential for AKT-mediated AS160 phosphorylation. In NFκB-high, untreated lymphomas,
  GLUT1-mediated glucose import supports proliferation and survival. After NFκB inhibition,
  lymphoma cells are deprived of glucose, causing starvation-induced autophagy that
  delays death. When NFκB and autophagy are inhibited simultaneously, lymphoma cells
  die rapidly of a metabolic crisis.
