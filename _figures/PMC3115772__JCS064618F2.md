caption: Molecular mechanisms for integration of adhesive signals. Activation of Rac
  by both cadherins (dark blue) and integrins (light green) upregulates proliferation
  in an additive manner through an increase in the expression of cyclin D1 (orange
  arrows). Cyclic cell strain induces cadherin-dependent activation of Rac and cyclin
  D1, but it has not yet been established how sensitive integrin-mediated promotion
  of proliferation is to cyclic strain. Cadherins and integrins antagonistically influence
  the activity of Rho GTPase and thus of Rho (purple arrows). Active Rho has dramatically
  different effects on cell adhesion depending on the downstream effector it binds.
  Rho signaling through Dia produces reorganization of actin in a manner that strengthens
  cell–cell adhesion, whereas signaling through ROCK enhances actin contractility,
  which in turn promotes cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion. However, a high level
  of Rho- and ROCK-mediated actin contractility is antagonistic to cell–cell junctions.
  Fer kinase is activated by cadherin and integrin adhesions, and activated Fer phosphorylates
  (P) the actin-organizing protein cortactin (blue arrows). Reorganization of the
  actin cytoskeleton by cortactin can enhance either cell–cell adhesion or migration.
  Shear stress across endothelial cells leads to inflammation (green arrows). Shear
  stress induces the assembly of a VEGFR–VE-cadherin–Shc complex (VEGFR in purple)
  and the phosphorylation of Shc, which then leads to activation of ERK1/2 and, subsequently,
  to inflammation. Phosphorylated Shc associates with integrins in a cadherin dependent
  manner and activates the NF-κB pathway, also resulting in inflammation. Solid lines
  represent direct interactions or effects, dashed lines indicate an indirect or unknown
  mechanism. The extracellular matrix is shown beneath the cells in blue and the actin
  cytoskeleton is represented by the pink lines.
