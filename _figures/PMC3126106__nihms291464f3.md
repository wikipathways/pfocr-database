caption: The dotted arrow indicates the interaction between PLCβ2 and the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) is not direct but involves IP3 (not shown). EC cells, like some taste
  cells, contain synaptic vesicles with transmitters (yellow balls) and neuropeptides
  (green balls) that will bind to their receptors on nerve terminals (yellow and green
  rectangles, respectively) that in turn influence many physiological processes (see
  text). Also shown is the presence of TRPA1 ion channels that respond to a variety
  of spices and irritants. In addition, some of these cells also contain GPCR-odorant
  receptors and, other still to be identified receptors (“Others”).
