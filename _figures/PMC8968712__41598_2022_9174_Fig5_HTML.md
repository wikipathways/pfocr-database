caption: Aerobic exercise via SRA improves hepatic steatosis description model. Aerobic
  exercise is closely linked to the reduction of intrahepatic lipid aggregation and
  inflammatory responses through the inhibition of SRA levels. Mechanistically, aerobic
  exercise may inhibit the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 by suppressing SRA expression,
  which leads to upregulation of ATGL expression. In addition, remission of inflammation
  was accompanied by significant alteration of inflammatory proteins and the P38/JNK
  signaling pathway.

  description: Aerobic exercise via SRA improves hepatic steatosis description model.
    Aerobic exercise is closely linked to the reduction of intrahepatic lipid aggregation
    and inflammatory responses through the inhibition of SRA levels. Mechanistically,
    aerobic exercise may inhibit the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 by suppressing
    SRA expression, which leads to upregulation of ATGL expression. In addition, remission
    of inflammation was accompanied by significant alteration of inflammatory proteins
    and the P38/JNK signaling pathway.
