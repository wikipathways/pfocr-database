caption: Disruption of Hippo signalling by deleting core kinase components (MST1,
  MST2, SAV1, MOB1A, MOB1B, LATS1, LATS2 and Merlin) leads to uncontrolled proliferation
  of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells (cholangiocytes). Transgenic mice
  with deficiency in Hippo pathway show spontaneous liver tumours derived from hepatocytes
  and/or cholangiocytes, as well as hepatomegaly caused by expansion of hepatocytes.
  Notably, Sav1-knockout mice exhibit expansion of hepatic progenitor cells, which
  is not observed in mice with deficiency of other Hippo pathway components. On the
  other hand, induced ectopic expression of YAP1 converts hepatocytes into progenitor
  or ductal-like cells. These observations indicate a unique role of SAV1 in regulating
  YAP1 activities in hepatic progenitor roles. LATS, large tumour suppressor; MOB1,
  Mob1 homologue protein; MST, mammalian ste20-like kinase; SAV1, salvador family
  WW domain-containing protein 1; YAP1, Yes-associated protein 1.
