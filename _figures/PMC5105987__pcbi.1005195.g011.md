caption: Two NetPocos associated with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). These NetPocos
  are consistently selected by L1 regularized logistic regression in the final model
  for risk prediction. The circle nodes represent proteins and rectangular nodes represent
  SNPs. Red dashed lines represent the eQTL association between a SNP and a gene,
  purple lines indicate that a SNP is in the ROI of the respective gene, and the blue
  edges represent a protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the products of respective
  genes. The genes that are previously reported to be associated with CAD are highlighted
  in gold. (a) A NetPoco enriched in cardia muscle tissue regeneration (p-value =
  0.0003) and activation of MAPKK activity (p-value = 0.02), (b) a NetPoco enriched
  in positive regulation of insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway
  (p-value = 0.0006).
