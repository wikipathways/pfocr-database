caption: The PKC-β mediated NF-κB activation results in B cell survival while PKC-δ
  inhibits the NF-IL-6 transcription factor, decreasing IL-6 production and subsequently
  results in B cell anergy. PKC-ζ phosphorylates RelA, which is an IKK-independent
  pathway to regulate NF-κB. PKC-ζ was also found to regulate cytokine gene expression
  by activating ERK. Unlike other PKC, PKCλ can be phosphorylate by SFKs, such as
  Blk, Fyn and Lyn, ln the PKC-β-NF-κB pathway, IKK is activated by the recruitment
  and oligomerization of signaling substrates, including Bcl10, which ubiquitinate
  lKKγ with MALT1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13(UBC13)
