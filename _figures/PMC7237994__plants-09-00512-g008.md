caption: Proposed model for glutamate-mediated hormone antagonism, proline synthesis,
  and redox modulation under drought and/or glutamate treatment. Black arrows represent
  the ABA-dependent pathway of response to drought, and green arrows represent the
  glutamate-mediated SA pathway under drought. Red or blue arrows indicate the decrease
  or increase of redox potential. The thickness of the arrow expresses the strength
  of induced or depressed response.
