caption: Molecular modulation of peripheral myelination by the Sirt2/Par-3/aPKC pathway.
  (A) Schematic graphs summarizing the progression of Sirt2 expression, Par-3 acetylation,
  and phospho-aPKC levels during developmental myelination and remyelination after
  nerve injury in adult mice. (B) Model based on the profiles shown in A illustrating
  how decreases in Par-3 acetylation due to elevated Sirt2 levels result in aPKC inactivation
  and effects on downstream targets that control myelin assembly in SCs. Such targets
  include other polarity proteins (e.g., such as Par-1, Lgl, and Crb), signaling molecules,
  and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (e.g., GSK3β and APC); see  for details.
