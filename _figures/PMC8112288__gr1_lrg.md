caption: Cartoon showing the major pathways targeted by O3 and its ROS and RES mediators
  on COVID-19. 1) O3 can even enter the cell via aryl-hydrocarbon receptors (AHR)
  and may form ROS or RES, both able to activate the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE system, inducing
  an anti-oxidant response. As the activation of Nrf2 blocks the NF-κB signaling,
  Nrf2 activation inhibits the inflammatory signal (anti-inflammatory action). 2)
  The anti-oxidant response is enhanced by blocking the Keap-1 mediated degradation
  of Nrf2; 3) The activation of Nrf2 releases HO-1, which exerts an anti-thrombotic
  action and moreover inhibits p65 expression and translocation into the nucleus,
  so suppressing the NF-κB pathway (anti-inflammatory action); 4) the HO-1 mediated
  anti-thrombotic action promotes the reduction of organ damage in I/R injury models,
  which are protected by the HO-1 stabilized HIF-1α,. Nitric oxide (NO), elicited
  by the anti-thrombotic action, increases the production of HO-1, so emphasizing
  the beneficial effect of HO-1 on vascular endothelia, dampening thrombotic mechanisms
  and promoting cardiovascular protection. 5) Hypoxia induces the activation of the
  HIF-1α pathway, which up-regulating the expression of ACE-1 receptors and subsequently
  down-regulating ACE2R, inhibits SARS-CoV2 spreading in the organism. HIF-1α enhances
  the production of HO-1. Green circles (+) = activation, red circles (-) = inhibition.
  Ozone is indicated by the picture with 3 full circles.
