caption: 'Metabolic pathways map. Metabolites that were identified in exhaled breath
  are marked with dark colour, while lighter colors are used for unidentified metabolites
  that demarcate important points in the pathways. Pathways including metabolites
  that decreased significantly between the start of the ramp and VO2max are: (A):
  blue for glyoxylate metabolism; (B): yellow for TCA cycle; and (C): grey-blue for
  tryptophan metabolism. Trends for changes in metabolite intensities are marked with
  arrows. Furthermore, (D): glycolysis is marked in green, lipid metabolism in brown,
  and ketone pathway in red. Summary data for each identified metabolite are represented
  with box plots (with median, quartiles, maxima and outliers) using intensities for
  all subjects from the start on the ramp to VO2max. Continuous intensity data over
  time are represented from one sample subject (subject 6).'
