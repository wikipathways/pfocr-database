caption: 'Under the condition of diabetes, hyperglycemia induce the activation of
  Nox2 in the cell, and at the same time, the excessive glucose will be metabolized
  by auto-oxidation and four other glucose metabolism pathways, thereby generating
  a large amount of ROS. These ROS subsequently disturb mitochondrial biogenesis and
  mitochondrial DNA repair, abnormally methylate mitochondrial DNA, and reduce the
  expression of antioxidants. The series of reactions ultimately lead to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and induce cell apoptosis. In addition, ROS can promote the expression
  of NF-κB, MAPK and other molecules, thereby intensifying the inflammatory response.
  ROS can also activate the MMP-9 pathway, which also contributes to DR. NF-κB: Nuclear
  factor kappa-B; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; DR:
  Diabetic retinopathy.'
