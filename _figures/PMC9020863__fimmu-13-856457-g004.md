caption: Insect immune defense modulation by miRNAs upon pathogenic invaders. Upon
  fungal invasion, insect miRNAs can silence fungal virulence genes, such as C6TF
  and Sec2p, and inhibits its replication (blue). Upon bacterial invasion, insect
  miRNAs individually or synergistically regulate the Toll pathway key components
  (Tube, Dorsal, Dif, etc.) positively, leading to activation of AMP gene effectors
  and inhibition of bacterial replication. Those elements can negatively modulate
  the same signaling at the late stage of the infection, decreasing the AMP gene expression
  for insect immune homeostasis. On the other hand, insect miRNAs can promote bacterial
  replication by inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway and indirectly those under its
  control (ROS, PO, phagocytosis) (in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, for instance)
  (brown). Lastly, IBP2 is significantly upregulated upon viral invasion of insects.
  The latter’s expression is drastically repressed by insect miRNAs, leading to viral
  replication. In contrast, insect miRNAs inhibit viral replication by downregulating
  components (URM) of the ubiquitinylation process (green).
