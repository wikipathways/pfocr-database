caption: Pathway analysis of disease associations in the hypothalamus (genes regulated
  at p<0.001; fold change > ±1.5). Green indicates a down-regulation in the gene and
  red indicates an induction in gene expression. Each connection has two or more references
  supporting the association or relationship. Note that dieldrin-mediated genes are
  located in a variety of cellular compartments and are predominantly induced after
  treatment.
