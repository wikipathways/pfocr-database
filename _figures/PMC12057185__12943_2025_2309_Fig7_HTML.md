caption: 'Cohesive model of lipidation in the TME. 1. TCR Signaling: N-myristoylation
  and S-palmitoylation regulate T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by ensuring membrane
  localization and activation of Lck and Fyn in CD4⁺ T cells. Upon TCR activation,
  CD4⁺ T cells release cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, modulating immune responses
  and shaping the TME. 2. BCR Signaling: In B cells, N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation
  ensuring the proper membrane anchoring of Lyn and HGAL. Following BCR activation,
  B cells facilitate antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex class
  II (MHC II) through human leukocyte antigen HLA-DM/HLA-DO, enhancing CD4⁺ T-cell
  activation and adaptive immunity. 3. PD- 1/PD-L1: S-palmitoylation stabilizes PD-L1
  and PD- 1, preventing their lysosomal degradation. This prolongs PD- 1/PD-L1 interactions,
  thereby inhibiting TCR activation, reducing T-cell cytotoxicity, and allowing tumors
  to evade immune surveillance. 4. IFN-γ Signaling: S-palmitoylation of interferon
  gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1)serves as a lysosomal sorting signal, reducing IFN-γ responsiveness
  and impairing MHC-I upregulation, which dampens CD8⁺ T-cell activation. Additionally,
  excessive lactate production by tumor cells acidifies the TME, lowering pH, suppressing
  NFAT, and reducing IFN-γ secretion, further contributing to immune evasion. 5. Lactate
  Metabolism: S-palmitoylation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) enhances glycolytic
  flux, increasing lactate accumulation in the TME. Lactate acidifies the TME, suppressing
  NFAT,thereby impairing T-cell function. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and
  tumor endothelial cells uptake lactate via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)
  and utilize it as an energy source, and activate the NF-κB/HGF signaling and NF-κB/IL-
  8 pathway, respectively. while glycolytic tumor cells and CAFs export lactate via
  MCT4, forming a metabolic symbiosis. Lactate also stabilizes HIF- 1α, inducing VEGF
  production, further supporting tumor growth and vascularization. 6. TLR4 in Macrophages:
  Upon recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) in macrophages is activated. S-palmitoylation of MyD88 by ZDHHC6 is required
  for the recruitment of TLR signaling complexes, driving NF-κB activation and proinflammatory
  cytokine release. N-myristoylation of TRAM directs its localization to plasma membrane
  microdomains, where PKCε phosphorylation facilitates TRIF-mediated IFN-I signaling
  in response to TLR4 activation, shaping macrophage polarization within the TME.
  7. NK Cell: Natural killer (NK) cells rely on S-palmitoylation to enhance receptor-ligand
  clustering within lipid rafts, such as NKG2D-MICA/MICB interactions, thereby optimizing
  tumor cell recognitionand cytotoxicity. TCR: T-cell receptor; BCR: B-cell receptor;
