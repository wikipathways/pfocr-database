caption: Summary of PLK1 inhibition-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy. (A) PLK1
  inhibition-based chemotherapy. The cancers treated by a PLK1 inhibitor and a chemotherapy
  drug are displayed in the human figure. Under the cancer names are the chemotherapy
  drugs, highlighted by 4 different colors as PLK1 inhibitors. (B) PLK1 inhibition-based
  targeted therapy. The cancers are treated by targeting PLK1 and the other pathway.
  Under the cancer names are the targeted pathways, highlighted by PLK1 inhibitors
  in 4 different colors. The purple, orange, blue, and green backgrounds represent
  BI2536, BI6727, NMS-1286937, and other PLK1 inhibitors, respectively. (Created with
