caption: Schematic diagram showing DTX family related signaling pathways and interactions
  in carcinomas. In the regulation of Notch endocytosis, ubiquitination of PI5P4Kγ,
  as a substrate of DTX1, promotes the endocytosis and maintaining of Notch on the
  membrane of TVC, thereby restraining the recycling of Notch to the cell membrane.
  DTX family proteins, such as DTX1, DTX3L, and DTX4, are primarily involved in the
  regulation of the Notch signaling pathway and expression of downstream genes to
  affect tumor growth, and metastasis. In the regulation of tumor growth and metastasis,
  DTX1 and DTX3L also enhance the phosphorylation of downstream proteins, such as
  STAT1, AKT, and ERK. In the regulation of apoptosis, ubiquitination of c-FLIP by
  DTX1 stimulates TRAIL-induced cell death. The combination of P300 and DTX1 inhibits
  the expression of multiple genes, which is also associated with apoptosis. The expression
  of caspase-3 and PARP1 is decreased by DTX3L to inhibit apoptosis. In the regulation
  of tumor immunity, the expression of DTX4 is negatively regulated by PD-L1. NICD,
