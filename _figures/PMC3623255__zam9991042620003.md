caption: In vivo flux distribution of G. oxydans during growth with glucose at 8.0
  h (sample point I, panel A) and 14.25 h (sample point II, panel B) after switch
  of naturally labeled to specifically 13C-labeled glucose (GLC). The network diagram
  shows the metabolic pathways in the periplasm and the cytoplasm that were in the
  focus of the 13C-MFA study. Metabolites are represented by rectangles (white, extracellular;
  pink, periplasmic; orange, cytoplasmic). Flux values (yellow hexagons) at sampling
  times are related to 100% glucose (sample point I, panel A) or gluconate (sample
  point II, panel B) uptake. The width of each flux edge is scaled proportional to
  its underlying value; flux arrows are pointing in net flux direction. For abbreviations
  of flux and metabolite names used in the model, see Table S3.2 and S3.3 in the supplemental
  material. Absolute net flux values are given in the supplemental material (see Table
  S3.4).
