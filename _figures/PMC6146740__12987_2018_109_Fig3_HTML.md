caption: PLVAP regulates vascular development and function. a Absence of Wnt and Norrin
  ligands for the Lpr5/Frzd receptor complex results in inactive canonical β-catenin
  signaling in non-barrier endothelium and in early embryonic stages in barrier endothelium.
  As a consequence, cytosolic β-catenin is targeted for proteolytic degradation through
  phosphorylation by the “β-catenin destruction complex”, which consists of the APC/axin/GSK3b-complex.
  Low levels of β-catenin allow upregulation of PLVAP expression in endothelial cells.
  However, it is unknown how PLVAP expression is upregulated during vascular development.
  PLVAP expression in the developing vasculature is essential during angiogenesis.
  PLVAP may directly promote angiogenesis or give mechanical support to capillaries,
  which prevents the formation of leaky vessels after the drastic remodeling steps
  of angiogenesis. b The canonical β-catenin signaling pathway is active in late embryonic
  stages in barrier endothelium. In the presence of Wnt or Norrin ligands, the “β-catenin
  destruction complex” is inhibited which results in the accumulation of β-catenin
  in cells. Nuclear β-catenin induces the transcription of β-catenin-target genes,
  which results in the downregulation of PLVAP expression. Low levels of PLVAP expression
  induce maturation of the BRB and BBB. EC endothelial cell(Adapted from [])
