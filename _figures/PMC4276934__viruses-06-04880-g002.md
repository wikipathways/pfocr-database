caption: Reactome mapping of differentially-expressed genes. Abundance of differentially-expressed
  IFNγ pathway transcripts in Pirital arenavirus-infected hamster livers relative
  to uninfected group were estimated by RSEM and statistically analyzed with DESeq.
  The symbols for the elevated genes were imported into the Reactome plugin of Cytoscape
  for pathway analysis. Genes in purple boxes were elevated in infected animals (author’s
  unpublished data) and suggests this pathway is important in the host response to
  the virus.
