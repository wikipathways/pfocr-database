caption: Pta-AckA pathway and Cpx two-component signal transduction pathway. (A) Schematic
  diagram of the Cpx pathway. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner or cytoplasmic membrane;
  H, site of autophosphorylation of the histidine kinase CpxA; D, site of autophosphosphorylation
  of the cognate response regulator CpxR; bent arrow, transcription initiation site
  of the CpxR target gene, cpxP. CpxP (P), a periplasmic chaperone (gray triangle),
  inhibits the activity of CpxA. CpxP binds to a substrate (black triangle). The CpxP-substrate
  complex is degraded by the ATP-independent periplasmic protease DegP (thunderbolt).
  Released from CpxP, CpxA can autophosphorylate using ATP as its phosphoryl donor.
  Phospho-CpxA then acts as a phosphoryl donor to CpxR. Phosphorylation exposes the
  CpxR DNA-binding domain (), which binds its target genes, including cpxP. CpxA also
  possesses phosphatase activity, which removes phosphoryl groups from phospho-CpxR
  in the form of Pi. (B) Schematic diagram of the Pta-AckA pathway that converts acetyl-CoA
  to acetate via an acetyl-P intermediate.
