caption: 'Metabolic map of differentially expressed genes in carbon and energy metabolism
  of Drosophila paulistorum. Upregulated genes are shown in green and downregulated
  genes in blue. DE genes from all conditions of the OR semispecies are represented.
  Green box: TCA cycle. Yellow box: Glycine and serine metabolism. Blue box: pentose
  phosphate pathway. The figure is redrawn based on KEGG map01200'
papertitle: The effect of Wolbachia on gene expression in Drosophila paulistorum and
  its implications for symbiont-induced host speciation.
