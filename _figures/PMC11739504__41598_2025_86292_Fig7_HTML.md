caption: Summary illustration of this study. Red ovals indicate KAT2B; green circles
  indicate IFT-B particles; blue circles indicate SMO; light grey circles indicate
  α-tubulin. The color intensity indicates the abundance. (a, b) During ciliogenesis,
  the basal expression level and subcellular localization of Kat2b in the cytosol,
  centrosome, and basal body gradually increased. Kat2b interacts with α-tubulin and
  regulates the acetylation level of α-tubulin via its catalytic activity. When Kat2b
  was depleted, the rate of cilium assembly was delayed, causing less acetylation
  level of α-tubulin, and the recruitment of IFT to be impaired. (c) When the Hh signaling
  pathway was activated using SAG treatment, the recruitment of SMO along the cilium
  is less under the absence of Kat2b
