caption: Hypothesized altered feedback control of the POMC gene promoter in cells
  having USP8 or RASD1 mutations (mut) versus wild type (wt). Contributing flux through
  pathway components and the effect of POMC (proopiomelanocortin gene) transcription
  are shown in cartoon form as small/medium/large arrow thicknesses. Pathway diagram
  is based on . (A) Signaling through the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor
  (CRHR) in the context of intact feedback inhibition as indicated by active RASD1
  and Gαi (red) allows for coordinated biosynthesis and secretion of ACTH. (B) USP8
  mutation (green) allows for enhanced activity of the EGFR-recycling apparatus and
  thereby triggers stronger positive regulation of adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  production. (C) Signaling through the CRHR in the context of disrupted feedback
  inhibition as indicated by RASD1 and Gαi (white and disconnected from Gαs) may allow
  for dysregulated and increased secretion of ACTH. (D) Signaling schematic in the
  context of both USP8 and RASD1 mutation, showing the possible additive or synergistic
  effects downstream from extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; Ca2+, calcium; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; cAMP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium
  channel.
