caption: Changes in proteins induced in the cytosol of microglia activated by BzATP
  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS (lipopolysaccharide); BzATP (2’-3’-O-(4-benzoyl
  benzoyl) adenosine 5’-triphosphate); TLR (Toll receptor); MYD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88); IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase); MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase); ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). MyD88 and IRAK are
  downstream members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) inflammatory signaling pathway
  that leads to several functional outputs, including the activation of nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NFκB), and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. →, activates; ⊥, inhibits
