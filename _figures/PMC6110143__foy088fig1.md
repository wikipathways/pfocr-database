caption: Anterograde communication pathways regulating gene transcription in yeast.
  Key yeast genes and proteins involved in the transcriptional regulatory network
  of signaling pathways among the nucleus, the cytoplasm and mitochondria (see text
  for details). The nucleus regulates biosynthesis and function of mitochondria through
  anterograde pathways (red lines), which are also sensitive to carbon and nitrogen
  sources. Glucose and preferred nitrogen sources activate PKA and TOR kinases and
  inhibit Snf1. Rim15 and of Mig1 are regulated by shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm.
  Anterograde regulation control the transcription of genes encoding proteins destined
  to mitochondria (red dashed lines). Nuclear genes highlighted in red are upregulated
  by the bolded transcription factors located above them. Cat8 and Adr1 can also regulate
  activation of RTG-dependent retrograde communication pathway (see Fig. , blue line).
