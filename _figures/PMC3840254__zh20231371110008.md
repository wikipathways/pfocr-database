caption: Summary of proposed pathway leading from TGF-β1 receptor binding to ROS generation.
  The dotted lines denote connections established in a range of cell types. The solid
  lines denote connections demonstrated in the present work. The protein expression
  of Sirt1, Pgc1a, Ucp2, and Nox4 did not change in our system. MMP, mitochondrial
  membrane potential; OCR, oxygen consumption rate; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; gene and protein names explained in the text. Phosphorylated
  TSC2 is the inactive form, which is permissive for mTOR activation.
