caption: 'Tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and its signalling pathways. TNFR1
  has four extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). Signalling via TNFR1 occurs
  by TNF-induced recruitment of monomeric membrane-bound TNFR1 molecules to form a
  homotrimer configuration which, when bound to ligand, causes a three-dimensional
  conformational change in the extracellular domain that is then transduced intracellularly
  to activate signalling pathways. The cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1 contains a TNF receptor
  type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) that couples this receptor to one of two
  distinct signalling pathways. The default pathway activates nuclear factor kappa-B
  (NF-κB) and other non-apoptotic pathways (not shown). This is mediated by the formation
  of complex I, comprising TNFR1 and NF-kB activating signalling components such as
  receptor interacting protein (RIP) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2).
  Formation of complex I is transient and TNFR1 can be internalized after TNF binding
  leading to dissociation of the TRADD/TRAF2/RIP complex and association of FADD,
  recruitment of pro-caspase 8 and formation of complex II, which then recruits the
  apoptotic machinery. If NF-kB activation triggered by complex I is successful, cellular
  FLIPLlevels (see below) are sufficiently elevated to block apoptosis and cells survive.
  The ovals in the figure represent different activating signalling components. FADD:
  FAS-associated death domain. FLIPL: FLICE-like inhibitory protein long, the long
  form of caspase 8 inhibitor.'
