caption: 'Schematic model of AngII-induced and mechanical stress-induced signaling
  pathway in vascular smooth muscle caveolae. Caveolae model modified from Matthäus
  et al. (). Left: Ang II induces rapid translocation of AT1R to caveolae, AT1R and
  Caveolin 1 associate with each other. Caveolin 3 accompanies with AT1R. Right: Mechanical
  stress induces translocation of Caveolin 1 to non-caveolar sites and is associated
  with β1-integrins/Fyn/Shc to activate ERK signaling pathway. Cav1, Caveolin 1; Cav3,
  Caveolin 3; AngII, Angiotensin II; AT1R, AngII type1 receptor; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Ca2+-permeable ion channels, such as TRPC, transient receptor
  potential channels, and EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.'
