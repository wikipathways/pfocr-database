caption: Cisplatin-induced DNA damage activates p53, which in turn transcribes CDKN1A
  (p21) and activates the Fas apoptosis pathway and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
  Activated Akt is important for dynamic shuttling of p21 from the nucleus toward
  the cytoplasm, where p21 can block apoptosis. miR-106b seed family members (miR-106b
  fam.) are involved in regulating p21 expression levels. Oct4 regulates the expression
  levels of the miR-106b seed family members. Cisplatin-sensitive cells are characterized
  with high levels of Oct4 and miR-106b family members and as a consequence low amounts
  of cytoplasmic p21, resulting in cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin-resistant
  cells have lower levels of Oct4 and miR-106b family members and high amounts of
  cytoplasmic p21, resulting in CDK2 inhibition and concomitantly moderate levels
  of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, deactivation of Akt with LY294002
  (LY), triciribine (TR), or siRNA against Akt sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells.
  Deactivation of Akt leads to nuclear localization of p21, which in turn is no longer
  capable of blocking cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of pre–miR-17-5p
  in cisplatin-resistant cells resulted in lower p21 levels and an increase in cisplatin-induced
  apoptosis. Dotted lines indicate interaction, whereas solid lines indicate (p53-induced)
  transcription.
