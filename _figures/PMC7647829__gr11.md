caption: Proposed mechanism by which melatonin exerts its proliferative and antiapoptotic
  effects on chicken granulosa cells. Briefly, interaction between melatonin and its
  receptor promotes PI3K to generate inositol phospholipids, as the second messengers
  activate the phosphorylation of Akt. Akt subsequently activates the mTOR-raptor
  complex, thereby resulting in the phosphorylation of many target proteins and finally
  regulating proliferation and apoptosis of chicken granulosa cells. MTR1/2 represents
  melatonin receptors.
