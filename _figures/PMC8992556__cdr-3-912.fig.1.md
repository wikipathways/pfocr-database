caption: 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis. Top panel shows reactions that occur in
  the adrenal reticularis. Bottom panel shows the conversion of adrenal steroids into
  the potent androgens testosterone and 5α-DHT in human prostate. The classical or
  canonical pathway is shown in red; the 5α-adione pathway is shown in blue; the backdoor
  pathway from allopregnanlone is shown in purple; the alternative pathway from 5-androstenediol
  is also shown. All enzymes are listed in italics by their gene names as follows:
  AKR1C1, 3α(20α)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; AKR1C2, type 3 3α-hydroysteroid dehydrogenase;
  AKR1C3, type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; CYP17A1, 17α-hydroxylase17/20 lyase;
  HSD3B1, type 1 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; HSD17B2 and 17HSD17B4, type 2 and
  type 4 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; HSD17B6, type 6 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  and retinol dehydrogenase; and SRD5A1/2, type 1 and type 2 steroid 5α-reductase'
