caption: The E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino plays a positive role in shrimp antibacteria
  response. Pellino acts as a conserved scaffold protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase in
  the TLR signaling pathway. (1) Pellino promotes the K63-linked ubiquitination of
  TARF6 (). (2) In addition, Pellino can ubiquitinate MyD88 for degradation to negatively
  regulate TLR signaling and maintain innate immune homeostasis (). Pellino can also
  interact with Pelle in shrimp. The expression of Pellino is up-regulated upon pathogens
  stimulation, and to increase the activity of Dorsal, thus enhancing AMPs expression
  with V. parahaemolyticus challenge (), in which Dorsal is also involved in defense
  against gram-positive bacterial in S. paramamosain (). However, the ubiquitinated
  substrates of Pellino in shrimp (such as whether MyD88 is ubiquitinated) is currently
  unknown.
