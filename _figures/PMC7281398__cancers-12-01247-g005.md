caption: Summary of Gene Ontology Analysis and Pathway analysis on genes that are
  associated with ex vivo VP16 response, ranked according to adjusted p-values. (A)
  Biological processes and (B) molecular functions linked to genes associated with
  response towards VP16. Pathway terms from (C) KEGG and (D) REACTOME with significantly
  enriched genes that are associated with VP16 response. An interaction network visualization
  on the right depicts the gene–gene interactions for selected processes, pathways,
  or functions, indicated with dotted lines. Blue indicates a negative correlation
  and orange–red indicates a positive correlation with drug resistance.
