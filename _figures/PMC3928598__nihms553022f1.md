caption: 'Glucose imported into the cells is rapidly phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  and converted to fructose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently metabolized to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  by L-glutamine-D-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate
  is dependent on availability of glutamine, which is formed by glutamine synthetase
  (GTS). Glucosamine-6-phosphate is subsequently metabolized by glucosamine 6-phosphate
  N-acetyltransferase (Emeg32) to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate, which is converted
  to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate by Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (Agm1) and
  the synthesis of UDP- uridine-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is catalyzed
  by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (Uap1). Flux through the HBP can be
  increased with glucosamine, which is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to form glucosamine
  6-phosphate thereby bypassing GFAT. UDP-GlcNAc is the obligatory substrate for OGT
  (uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine: polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)
  leading to the formation of O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-modified proteins.
  ß-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from the proteins.'
