caption: 'This figure shows the mechanistic interplay between NETosis and atherosclerosis
  development in the pre-NET stage. Black upward arrow indicates the expression of
  this substance is upregulated; indigo arrow indicates the substance binds to the
  corresponding receptor or reaches the corresponding location through inteacellular/extracellular
  movement; purple arrow indicates that up-regulation of gene expression leads to
  up-regulation of expression of specific substances; indigo wavy arrow indicates
  the former leads to the production of cellular biological activities in the latter
  through some cellular pathways. (A). The central part shows a cross-section of an
  artery and describes the situation inside the blood vessel during the development
  of atherosclerosis. Damaged endothelial cells upregulate the expression of chemokines
  such as VCAM-1/ICAM-1, which can promote neutrophil infiltration. Foam cells and
  oxLDL gradually accumulate in the intima, and smooth-muscle cells migrate like an
  intermediate layer. NETs and oxLDL adhere to the intimal surface to form the basic
  structure of plaque attachment. (B). The upper left part shows the stimuli involved
  in NETosis activation in the pre-NET stage. These include bacteria, viruses, some
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α), oxLDL, and ROS. There
  are also signalling pathways involved in this process, such as the NADPH oxidase
  pathway, which produces a large amount of ROS; the NF-κB signalling pathway, which
  upregulates the expression of IL-6/IL-8; and the cGAS-STING signalling pathway,
  which is the key mechanism of mtDNA leakage and NETosis. (C). The upper right panel
  shows the effect of factors that promote NETosis in the pre-NET stage on the development
  of atherosclerosis. For example, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6/IL-8 upregulate
  the expression of TNF-α in macrophages, amplifying the inflammatory response; IFN-γ
  induces apoptosis, leading to endothelial damage; and IL-36 activates inflammasomes.
  (D). The lower part shows the interaction between the signalling pathways, i.e.,
  the common stimuli for NF-κB and cGAS-STING (e.g., IL-8/IL-6, VCAM-1), and the positive
  feedback between the two, leading to a massive production of ROS. Abbreviations:
  oxLDL (oxidised low-density lipoprotein)'
