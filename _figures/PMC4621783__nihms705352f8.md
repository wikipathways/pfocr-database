caption: Model for the Ca2+ dependent signaling pathway activated by PAR2. Activation
  of PAR2 receptors by serine proteases (trypsin) and peptide agonists (SLIGRL and
  SLIGKV) evokes phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation leading to IP3 production and ER
  store-release through the opening of IP3 receptors. Release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores leads to activation of STIM1 which opens CRAC channels comprised of Orai1
  subunits. Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels activates calcineurin-NFAT signaling
  to transcriptionally induce IL-6 and IL-8 production, likely in conjunction with
  other pathways. CsA, Cyclosporin A; U73122, PLCβ inhibitor; BTP2 and RO2959, CRAC
  channel inhibitors.
