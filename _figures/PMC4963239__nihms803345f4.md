caption: Four representative, simplified signaling pathways are shown. Each pathway
  is activated by different signals; for instance, p53 signaling is activated during
  cell stress, toll like receptors (TLR) are activated in response to infection, and
  the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is activated in response to
  metabolic cues. Each pathway converges on a distinct transcription factor that targets
  a different Mediator subunit, helping to recruit and regulate Mediator activity
  at select genomic loci. The end result is transcription factor-dependent activation
  (or repression) of a specific set of genes that are important for the response to
  the stimulus. Due to Mediator's role in relaying and integrating these signals directly
  to the transcription machinery (including the pol II enzyme itself), Mediator can
  be considered an endpoint of signaling cascades.
