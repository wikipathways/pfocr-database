caption: Glutathione synthesis pathway. Glutathione is synthesized from L-glutamate
  and L-cysteine in a 2-step reaction catalyzed in an ATP dependent manner by γ-glutamylcysteine
  ligase (GCL) (also referred to as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) and the addition
  of glycine by glutathione synthase. Glutathione can be recycled to its constitutive
  amino acids by γ-glutamyl-n-transferase and dipeptidase.
