caption: The pooled microarray datasets downloaded from NCBI were used to identify
  the relationship of these candidate genes. The genes in the upstream of the network
  were assumed to be less variant, so coefficient of variation (CV) of each gene (presented
  in percent) was calculated to determine its site in the regulatory network. Besides,
  Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (-1 to 1) of the desired gene pairs decide
  whether they were negative/positive control with significance level p<0.05. Number
  of patients = 653. The red lines or arrows represent significant correlation (P-value
  <0.05). Coefficient of variation in red, correlation coefficient in blue and P-value
  in green.
