caption: Incorporation of arachidonic acid into membrane-bound phospholipids by the
  Lands pathway (). Free AA is converted to the CoA ester and then a substrate for
  lysophospholipid acyltransferases located in the ER for incorporation into membrane
  phospholipids. The free AA can also be a substrate for various oxidation reactions
  to form bioactive eicosanoids or β-oxidation, while CoA esters can be substrates
  for acyltransferases to for cholesteryl esters or diacyl- and triacylglycerols.
