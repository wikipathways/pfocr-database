caption: Schematic illustrating interaction of key elements in the tumor stroma in
  CCA progression. Several components of the CCA tumor microenvironment activate mechanisms
  that promote tumor growth, migration and activation of tumor associated angiogenesis
  and lymphangiogenesis. Interaction between VEC and CCA cell via VEGFR2-VEGFA assisted
  by neuropilin leads to tumor angiogenesis via upregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
  HIF1α activated by an inflamed tumor microenvironment stimulates CCA progression.
  VEGFC secreted by CCA as well by CAF (via PDGFD stimulation of tumor cells) aids
  in the process of lymphangiogenesis by stimulating LECs to divide via VEGFR3 engagement
  and upregulation of ERK/JNK pathway. Further contributing to the surrounding milieu,
  exosomal vesicles secreted by CCA triggers production of IL6, CCL2, CXCL1, CXC3CL1,
  and PDGF-AA which in turn when secreted in the tumor stroma induces CCA proliferation
  and growth pathways. CCA, Cholangiocarcinoma; MSC, Mesenchymal Stem Cell; LEC, Lymphatic
