caption: Small-molecular combination as a novel strategy to optimize limbal stem cell
  (LSC) expansion in culture. GSK3β inhibitors [lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR-99021],
  DKK inhibitor (IIIC3), and Wnt mimic (MFH-ND) activate the canonical Wnt pathway
  to improve LSC expansion. Growth factor (pigment epithelial-derived factor), cytokine
  (leukemia inhibitory factor), ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), and BMP signaling inhibitor
  (LDN-193189) also promote LSC self-renewal through multiple signaling pathways.
  TGF/β signaling inhibitor (SB431542) and Notch signaling inhibitor (DAPT) prevent
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition of LSC by inhibiting the corresponding pathways.
  Histone deacetylase inhibitor (VPA), miRNA agomir/antagomir and nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor [nicotinamide (NAM)] might enhance the efficiency
  of LSC expansion through the regulation at epigenetic, post-transcriptional, and
  metabolic levels. ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  miRNA, microRNA.
