caption: Signaling pathways associated with the biomechanical traits of cardiac fibrosis.
  With the changes of ECM mechanical properties during the process of cardiac fibrosis,
  myofibroblasts are activated . In classical signaling pathway, the TGF-β receptor’s
  activation induces phosphorylation of the C-terminus of SMAD. The phosphorylated
  SMADs then form a complex with the co-mediator SMAD, SMAD4, the complex is translocated
  into the nucleus, where it binds to the gene promoter. Upon myofibroblasts are activated,
  TGF-β is released from binding proteins in the ECM, leading to sustained activation
  and contraction of myofibroblasts, finally causing a vicious cycle of fibrotic progression.
  In addition, integrins which sense changes in external forces can also contribute
  to the remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Studies have shown that the activation of
  cell membrane surface mechanosensitive receptors (such as Piezo1, AT1R and TRPV4)
  are also key pathways in the vicious cycle of fibrosis. Correlational studies have
  shown that Piezo1 can be activated by shear stress, stretching and matrix microarchitecture.
