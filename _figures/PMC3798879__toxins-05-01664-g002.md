caption: Pim-dependent inactivation of the negative regulator SOCS. (a) In v-Abl as
  well as in (b) PMT-mediated signaling, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway leads
  to the constitutive expression of the otherwise short-lived serine/threonine kinase
  Pim. Phosphorylation of its downstream target, the suppressor of cytokine signaling
  (SOCS) inhibits the ability of SOCS to act as an ubiquitin ligase. Thus JAK molecules
  accumulate in the cell leading to the hyperactivation of STAT3 signaling, increased
  cell survival and anchorage-independent growth.
