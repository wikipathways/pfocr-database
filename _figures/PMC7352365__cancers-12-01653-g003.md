caption: Regulation of the p53/MDM2 pathway by HERC2. In basal conditions, HERC2 and
  NEURL4 regulate p53 transcriptional activity by promoting its oligomerization. MDM2
  maintains low levels of p53 by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Upon DNA
  damage, associated kinases phosphorylate MDM2 and HERC2. In addition, p53 is activated
  by acetylation and phosphorylation. The phosphorylated MDM2 is detached from the
  complex and is autopolyubiquitylated and subsequently degraded. Activated p53 binds
  to the promoters of its target genes, such as p21 or MDM2, and a negative feedback
  loop is established in the latter case.
