caption: 'Role of long noncoding RNA in the RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling pathway:
  a Viral PAMPs are recognized by intracellular PRRs followed by recruitment of different
  adapter proteins, including TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF), Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response 88 (MyD88), mitochondria localized
  IPS-1, and endoplasmic reticulum-localized stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
  to activate TBK1/IKKε and the IKK complex. Activated TBK1 and IKK phosphorylate
  IRF3/7 or IκB, leading to activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3/7 or NF-κB,
  consequently increasing the transcription of Type-I interferons and proinflammatory
  cytokines. After sensing viral DNA, AIM2 also induces the conversion of the inactive
  form of proIL-1β to its bioactive form IL-1β through an inflammasome complex that
  consists of ASC and caspase-1. Interferons and proinflammatory cytokines collectively
  help resolve viral infection. b Inactive RIG-I exists in a closed conformation with
  its CTD masking the CARDs. RNA binding to the helicase domain unmasks the CARD for
  downstream signaling and allows binding of the TRIM25 interaction to host long noncoding
  RNA lnczc3h7a to the helicase domain of RIG-I. Lnczc3h7a acts as a scaffold to facilitate
  the RIG-I-TRIM25 interaction so that TRIM25 can add K63-linked ubiquitin chains
  to the CARD of RIG-I. Ubiquitination results in RIG-I oligomerization and interaction
  with IPS-1. IPS-1 then recruits several signaling proteins to finally activate IRF3/7
  or NF-kB, which upon nuclear translocation induce Type-I interferons and proinflammatory
  cytokines'
