caption: Eighteen probe sets were differentially expressed when CIT was higher than
  1,200 minutes and not significant between groups (CSP vs. PPP). Pathway Analysis
  showed that almost all these genes belong to the same network (score 23) and associate
  with the inflammatory response and immune cell trafficking.
