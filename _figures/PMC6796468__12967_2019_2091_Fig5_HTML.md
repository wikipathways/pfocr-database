caption: Proposed model of PYCR1 interference on HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis.
  PYCR1 interference could inhibit IRS1 expression and insulin resistance via JNK
  signaling pathway suppression, which subsequently inhibited HCC cell proliferation
  and promoted cell apoptosis
papertitle: PYCR1 interference inhibits cell growth and survival via c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase/insulin receptor substrate 1 (JNK/IRS1) pathway in hepatocellular cancer.
