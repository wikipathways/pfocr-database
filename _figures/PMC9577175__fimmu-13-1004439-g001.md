caption: Signaling pathways of NOD1 and NOD2 leading to the development of liver injury.
  Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 detect muropeptides
  derived from the intestinal bacteria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Activation
  of NOD1 and NOD2 leads to the polyubiquitination of receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 2 (RIPK2). Polyubiquitination of RIPK2 requires molecular interactions
  between RIPK2 and E3 ligases, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP),
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), and TNF-receptor associated factor
  6 (TRAF6). A20 and MYSM1 remove polyubiquitin chains from RIPK2. Activation of RIPK2
  induces the production of TNF-α and IL-6 through the nuclear translocation of NF-κB
  subunits and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and
  thereby promotes the development of liver injury.
