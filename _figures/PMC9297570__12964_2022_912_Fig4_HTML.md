caption: hTid-1 in the regulation of cancer-associated proteins. A hTid-1enhances
  the attachment of pVHL with HIF-1α which increases the attachment of poly-ubiquitin
  chains to HIF-1α, and its subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway. B
  hTid-1 interacts with both Wild-Type and mutant p53, causing the translocation of
  p53 into the mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. C
  Upon HGF stimulation, hTid-1 interacts with the Met protein causing its dissociation
  from the Met Receptor, and an increase in cellular proliferation. D hTid-1 along
  with CHIP causes the degradation of ErBb2. E hTid-1 interacts with STAT5b and stops
  cell growth
