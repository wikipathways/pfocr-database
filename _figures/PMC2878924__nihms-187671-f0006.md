caption: Two models for coupling the circadian clock to the cell cycle/checkpoint
  response. (A) Serial coupling. The XPA repair factor, the p21 and Wee1 cell cycle
  proteins, and the c-Myc transcription factor, which are involved in DNA repair,
  the cell cycle, and cellular proliferation, respectively, are encoded by clock-controlled
  genes (CCG), and hence DNA repair, checkpoint activation, cell cycle regulation,
  and cellular proliferation are gated by the clock (solid line). Conversely, the
  cell cycle influences the circadian cycle by halting transcription during mitosis,
  thus causing a phase shift of the circadian rhythm (broken line). (B) Direct coupling.
  The core circadian clock protein Cry, in conjunction with Tim participates in the
  ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway in response to UV and UV-mimetic agents. Similarly, Per1
  participates in the ATM-Chk2 signaling pathway in response to IR and radiomimetic
  agents.
