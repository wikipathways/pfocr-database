caption: Overview of the transsulfuration pathway. There are four enzymatic pathways
  for the biosynthesis of H2S, including CBS, CSE, MPST coupled with CAT, and MPST
  coupled with DAO. Non-enzymatic H2S generation occurs in the presence of reducing
  equivalents such as NADPH and NADH, reactive sulfur species in persulfides, thiosulfate,
  and polysulfides that are reduced into H2S and other metabolites. The transsulfuration
  pathway intersects with the transmethylation pathway at homocysteine. Methionine
  is an indispensable amino acid and is transmethylated intracellularly via S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), an important methyl donor for most biological methylation reactions, producing
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in this process, and is then hydrolyzed to homocysteine.
  Homocysteine can be remethylated back to methionine by N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). The cysteine generated by the pathway can be conducted into GSH
  synthesis by the action of the enzymes γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and
  glutathione synthetase (GS) or converted to other sulfur-containing molecules such
  as taurine. Taurine is generated by the action of three enzymes, CDO, cysteine sulfinic
  acid decarboxylase (CSAD), and hypotaurine dehydrogenase (HTAU-DH).
