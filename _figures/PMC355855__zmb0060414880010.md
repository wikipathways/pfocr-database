caption: Models for repression of TGF-β signaling by the Smurf-Smad7 complex and reactivation
  of TGF-β signaling by the Jab1/CSN5-Smad7 complex. (A) Smad7 inhibits TGF-β signaling
  by preventing access of Smad2 or Smad3 to the TGF-β receptor. (B) Smad7 inhibits
  TGF-β1 signaling by binding directly to Smurfs, bringing the Smurf/Smad7 complex
  to TβRI, and inducing the turnover of TβRI. (C) Jab1/CSN5 enhances TGF-β signaling
  by binding to Smad7 and inducing degradation of Smad7 through the COP9-proteosome
  pathway.
