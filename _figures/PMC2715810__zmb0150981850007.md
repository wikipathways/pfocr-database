caption: Model of PERK pathway controlling rRNA transcription and translation in comparison
  to mTOR. (A) PERK pathway. Unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activate the PERK kinase.
  PERK phosphorylates eIF2α leading to inhibition of translation initiation and inhibition
  RRN3/TIF-IA activity, resulting in dissociation of RRN3/TIF-IA and Pol I from the
  preinitiation complex. Dashed lines indicate that direct interaction of components
  has not been demonstrated. (B) mTOR pathway. Under favorable conditions, signaling
  from growth factors and nutrients activates mTOR leading to phosphorylation of 4E-BP
  and S6K. Inhibition of 4E-BP and activation of S6K by mTOR phosphorylation cooperate
  to increase the efficiency of translation initiation. While the entire pathway has
  yet to be elucidated, mTOR and S6K activity lead to phosphorylation of rRNA transcription
  factors increasing transcription of rRNA.
