caption: The lipid II cycle of Gram-positive bacteria is a prime target for antibiotics.
  a The lipid II cycle, as the core pathway of cell wall biosynthesis, drives the
  transport of PG subunits across the cytoplasmic membrane via attachment to lipid
  carrier molecules. The cytoplasmic production of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (M) from
  UDP-GlcNAc (G) is catalysed by the MurA-F ligases,,. Subsequently, at the internal
  leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane the translocase MraY and the transferase MurG
  sequentially attach UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-GlcNAc to the lipid carrier
  undecaprenyl phosphate (UP), giving rise to the lipid I and lipid II intermediates,
  respectively. Various flippases translocate lipid II to the outer leaflet of the
  cytoplasmic membrane, where penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) incorporate the subunits
  into the growing PG layer. This leaves the lipid carrier in its pyrophosphate form
  (UPP), which has to be recycled to UP by dephosphorylation to allow a new round
  of PG monomer transport. Given that all known UPP phosphatases (UppPs) act at the
  external leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane,, carrier recycling requires flipping
  of UP to the internal leaflet by a yet unknown mechanism,. Finally, dilution of
  lipid carriers is counterbalanced by cytoplasmic synthesis of UPP by UppS, but likewise
  to UP flipping, the required mechanism to present UPP to the externally acting phosphatases
  is unknown. Several antibiotics inhibit key steps of cell wall biosynthesis by forming
  complexes with UP, UPP or lipid II, as indicated by the T-shaped red lines. b The
  lipid II cycle can be considered as a closed-loop system, in which all fluxes ji
  from one state of the cycle into the next balance each other. Since UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide
  and UDP-GlcNAc use lipid II cycle intermediates as carriers for the transport across
  the cytoplasmic membrane, the flux of PG precursors, jPG (red arrows), is equal
  to the flux of the cycling reactions (blue arrows)
