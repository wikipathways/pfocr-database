caption: Binding of EPO to either the homodimeric EPO-receptor (EPOR) complex or the
  heterotrimeric EPOR-βCR complex first activates Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2).
  Phosphorylation and activation of Jak2 recruits secondary messengers and activates
  secondary signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor-κB. Some of the pathways mediating EPO-mediated
  protection are similar to those mediating erythropoiesis or neuroprotection. In
  particular, EPO-mediated inhibition of apoptosis involves activation of protein
  kinase B/Akt to inhibit caspase-9 or activate nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) or inhibit
  Bad, or stimulate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), or MAPK
  pathway to increase anti-apoptotic messengers in the mitochondria including Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL. The most common pathway for EPO-mediated cardioprotection as well as
  vascular protection is EPO-induced augmentation of nitric oxide (NO) production
  by PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS). EPO is also shown to regulate intracellular Ca2+ by activating phospholipase
  C (PLC).
