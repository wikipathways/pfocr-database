caption: The network of Wnt signaling regulates tumor metabolism reprogramming. The
  activated Wnt signaling pathway promotes the up-regulation of MCT-1, CYC1 and ATP
  synthase by the downstream transcription factor TCF/LEF, resulting in the secretion
  of intracellular lactate and the occurrence of aerobic glycolysis. Wnt signaling
  pathway can also up-regulate the expression of GLUT-1, LDH, PKM2, SLC1A5 and other
  genes by c-Myc promoting glycolysis, nucleotide and fatty acid synthesis in tumor
  cells. The non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis by activating
  Akt-mTOR to stabilize the expression of mTORC1 and β-catenin. The activated mTOR
  pathway promotes glucose uptake by increasing glucose transporter expression. On
  the other hand, the mTOR pathway can also lead to an increase in fatty acid synthesis
  by up-regulating the expression of acetyl-CoA, resulting in an increase in fatty
  acid oxidative metabolism. In addition, activation of the mTOR pathway can also
  result in upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, resulting in enhanced
  pentose phosphate bypass and promotion of ribonucleic acid synthesis. ROS levels
  can directly affect the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. ROS can interact
  with TCF4, alter the binding of β-catenin to TCF, and interact with the transcriptional
  link factor of FOXO3a, thereby changing the gene expression of cells and promoting
  tumorigenesis.

  description: The network of Wnt signaling regulates tumor metabolism reprogramming.
    The activated Wnt signaling pathway promotes the up-regulation of MCT-1, CYC1
    and ATP synthase by the downstream transcription factor TCF/LEF, resulting in
    the secretion of intracellular lactate and the occurrence of aerobic glycolysis.
    Wnt signaling pathway can also up-regulate the expression of GLUT-1, LDH, PKM2,
    SLC1A5 and other genes by c-Myc promoting glycolysis, nucleotide and fatty acid
    synthesis in tumor cells. The non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes aerobic
    glycolysis by activating Akt-mTOR to stabilize the expression of mTORC1 and β-catenin.
    The activated mTOR pathway promotes glucose uptake by increasing glucose transporter
    expression. On the other hand, the mTOR pathway can also lead to an increase in
    fatty acid synthesis by up-regulating the expression of acetyl-CoA, resulting
    in an increase in fatty acid oxidative metabolism. In addition, activation of
    the mTOR pathway can also result in upregulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
    resulting in enhanced pentose phosphate bypass and promotion of ribonucleic acid
    synthesis. ROS levels can directly affect the transcriptional activity of β-catenin.
    ROS can interact with TCF4, alter the binding of β-catenin to TCF, and interact
    with the transcriptional link factor of FOXO3a, thereby changing the gene expression
    of cells and promoting tumorigenesis.
