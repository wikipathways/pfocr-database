caption: Replenishment of NAD+ through biosynthesis (de novo) and salvage pathways.
  Given there are many NAD+-consuming enzymes, it is essential that NAD+ be replenished
  to maintain compartmental NAD+ levels. This occurs through the salvage and biosynthetic
  pathways. NA, nicotinic acid; NAM, nicotinamide; NAMN, NA mononucleotide; NMN, NAM
  mononucleotide; NMNAT, NMN adenylyltransferase; NAAD, NA adenine dinucleotide; NAD+,
  NAM adenine dinucleotide; NAPT, NA phosphoribosyltransferase; NAMPT, NAM phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NR, nicotinamide riboside. Except for NAMPT, the role of these pathways in NAD+
  replenishment in skeletal muscle, and in response to exercise, are essentially unknown.
  Molecules generated in each pathway are in orange; enzymes are in blue.
