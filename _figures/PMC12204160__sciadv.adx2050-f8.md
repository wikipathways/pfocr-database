caption: Illustration of glucose transport from the choroid circulation to the outer
  retina, its metabolism to GABA, and the targeted ON bipolar signaling pathway. Glucose
  transport to the outer retina diminishes in RP with the loss of abundant rod OSs
  (ROSs), leading to reduced GABA synthesis centered in GABAergic amacrine cells.
  GABA is required to suppress the initial ON cone bipolar signal, and with reduced
  retinal GABA in RP, the cells become hyperresponsive to light. Transmission of this
  deregulated signal downstream to RGC causes an ON > OFF imbalance, highlighted by
  a positive PERG and diminished detection of changes in luminance and contrast. Retinal
  GABA synthesis can be restored in RP by subretinal injection of WT rod OSs that
  reestablish glucose transport from the RPE to the outer retina. The GABAA receptor
  agonist Ativan can restore cone pathway regulation for detection of luminance changes
  and contrast in the face of diminished retinal GABA in RP
