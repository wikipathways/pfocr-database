caption: Nerve regeneration is negatively regulated by AMPK. (A) The mTORC1 pathway
  inhibits cap-dependent mRNA degradation to increase transcription. Injury induces
  calcium influx to activate CaMKIIα/PSMC5 (26S proteasome subunit) pathway and degrades
  AMPK, resulting in mTORC1 pathway activation in axons. Decreased AMPK activation
  reduces cap-dependent mRNA degradation that is involved in axon regeneration. (B)
  Nerve injury impairs AMPK activation resulting in the upregulation of mTORC1 and
  c-jun pathways to enhance translation in Schwann cells. (C) AMPK activation inhibits
  axonal regeneration and Schwann cells-mediated re-myelination. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase. CaMKIIα, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α. elF4E, eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor. mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1.
  p4EBP, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor-4E-binding protein. RAPTOR, regulatory
  protein associated with mTOR. TSC2, tuberous sclerosis complex 2.
