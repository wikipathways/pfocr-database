caption: Integration of differentially expressed mRNAs, microRNA target gene, lncRNA
  target gene and protein modulating focal adhesion function in human brain microvascular
  endothelial cells treated with γ-valerolactones and stressed with TNF-α. (A) Heatmap
  of differentially expressed gene pathways, miRNA target gene pathways, lncRNA gene
  pathways and protein pathways. The intensity of the blue color depends on the number
  of genes in each pathway, the lighter blue color is indicative of a higher number
  of genes. Comparisons of pathways between biological categories identified a group
  of pathways in common including chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine cytokine receptor,
  focal adhesion, gap junction, FOXO signaling, fatty acid metabolism, and pathways
  that regulate endothelial cell interaction and permeability. (B) A representative
  integrated analysis of differentially expressed genes and proteins, and target genes
  of differentially expressed miRNAs, lncRNA is shown for Focal adhesion. Yellow =
  differentially expressed genes; Red = target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs,
  Green = target genes of differentially expressed lncRNAs, Blue = differentially
  expressed proteins. Color gradations = genes identified in both omic maps.
