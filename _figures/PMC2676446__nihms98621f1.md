caption: Regulation of p53 and MDM2 and the outcomes of p53 activation. A, MDM2 inhibits
  p53 through an autoregulatory loop. MDM2 directly binds to the transactivation domain
  of p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, causes the ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation of p53, and exports p53 out of the nucleus which promotes
  p53 degradation and inhibits its activity. MDMX, a homologue of MDM2, also directly
  binds to the transactivation domain of p53 and inhibits p53 activity, but does not
  induce p53 degradation. ARF binds to MDM2 and sequesters MDM2 into the nucleolus,
  leading to the stabilization of p53. B, activation of p53 can also lead to induction
  of apoptosis via intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) apoptosis
  pathways. Apoptosis can be transcriptional-dependent or -independent because p53
  itself can participate in mitochondrial mediated apoptosis through interaction with
  proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. C, activation of p53
  can halt cell cycle progression in the G1-S and G2-M boundaries of cell cycle through
  the up-regulation of the p21, Gadd45, and 14-3-3-σ proteins. Transition into the
  S-phase requires cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), such as CDK2, which phosphorylates
  and inactivates Rb, rendering E2F free and transcriptionally active, leading to
  cell cycle progression. However, p53 activation induces the CDK inhibitor p21, which
  leads to cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, Cdc2/cyclinE activity is essential for
  entry into mitosis, and this activity can be inhibited by p21, Gadd45, and 14-3-3-σ,
  resulting in G2-M phase arrest. D, senescence is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism
  of p53. Telomere erosion, DNA damage, and oxidative stress or oncogenic stress can
  signal p53 activation, triggering senescence response via the p21-Rb-E2F signaling
  pathway. Oncogenic Ras can activate MAPkinase pathway that phosphorylates and activates
  p53 and also induces the expression of ARF, which in turn binds to and inhibits
  MDM2, leading to the up-regulation of p53 and the induction of senescence. E, p53
  can suppress angiogenesis through the down-regulation of proangiogenic proteins
  and up-regulation of antiangiogenic proteins. In addition, p53 can bind to HIF-1α,
  a promoter of angiogenesis during hypoxia, and target it for degradation by MDM2.
  In a p53-independent manner, HIF-1α interacts with the p53-binding domain of MDM2,
  and transcriptionally up-regulates the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
  promoting angiogenesis. F, p53 plays a critical role in DNA damage repair. DNA damage
  and replication errors can activate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia
  telangiectasia and Rad-related (ATR) kinases, which trigger several cellular responses,
  including DNA repair. ATM and ATR can phosphorylate DNA repair protein 53BP1 as
  well as induce the accumulation of p53 through phosphorylation directly or via CHK1and
  CHK2 kinases. p53 participates in DNA repair in a transactivation-dependent manner
  through the up-regulation of proteins such as p53R2 (p53-inducible small subunit
  of ribonucleotide reductase), p48 (gene product of DDB2 gene), and XPC (xeroderma
  pigmentosum group C protein), and in an independent manner through interaction with
  other DNA repair proteins, such as 53BP1.
