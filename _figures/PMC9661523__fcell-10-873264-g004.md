caption: EC subtypes, their transitions, and functions in heart development and diseases.
  ECs mainly consist of vascular ECs, lymphatic ECs, coronary vascular ECs, capillary
  ECs, endocardial ECs, and valvar ECs. These subtypes of ECs have different molecular
  characteristics and biological functions depending on their anatomical positions.
  Vascular ECs can be divided into arterial and venous ECs, and Ackr1+ venous ECs
  have been shown to prepare cardiac function after injury. Both vascular and endocardial
  ECs were speculated to regulate heartbeat through the NOS pathway. During heart
  development, parts of endocardial cells transform into valvar cells through the
  endo-MT process. Capillary ECs are also potential regulators of immune responses
  in the healthy adult human heart.
