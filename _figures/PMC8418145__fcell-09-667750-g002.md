caption: Functions of TFEB. (A) TFEB is involved in the biogenesis of lysosomes (a),
  mitochondrial (e), peroxidases (f), and autophagosomes (b). (B) TFEB participates
  in multiple types of autophagy, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone
  mediated autophagym (CMA) by regulating the function of lysosomes. It is also involved
  in autophagy at various steps, such as the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome
  in macroautophagy (a), the localization and trafficking of LAMP2A in CMA (b), and
  the priming the clearance of damaged mitochondrial in mitophagy (c). (C) TFEB regulates
  immune responses in both innate and adaptive immune systems. TFEB is involved in
  activation, bactericidal capacity, and production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages
  (a). In dendritic cells, TFEB inhibits the antigen presentation of MHC class I but
  enhances the expression of MHC class II (b). In T cells, TFEB is related to antibody
  response in reaction to the activation of CD40 at cellular surface (c). (D) The
  modulation of TFEB activity. Lysosomal proteins, such as V-ATPase, cathepsin B,
  and MCOLN1 that are induced by TFEB, can regulate TFEB activity in return (a). mTORC1
  is critically involved in the TFEB phosphorylation, which can be activated by TFEB
  (b). TFEB is a major regulator of ALP, and both lysosomal damage and autophagy disruption
  result in TFEB activation (c). TFEB directly activate PGC-1α, and it can be activated
  in a PGC-1α-dependent manner (d). TFEB induces mitophagy by activating PINK1/Parkin
  pathway, and its activity is also enhanced by stimulating PINK1/Parkin (e). (mTORC1,
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; CMA, chaperone mediated autophagy; PGC-1α,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α; TFEB, transcription
  factor EB; MHC, major histocompatibility complex).
