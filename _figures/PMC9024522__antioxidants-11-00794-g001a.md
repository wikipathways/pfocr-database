caption: The flavonoid biosynthesis and its regulation in cereal and Solanaceae crops.
  Scheme of the pathway leading to the production of flavonoids and phenolic acids
  in monocots (a) and dicots (b). Phenylalanine is first deaminated by PAL to produce
  cinnamic acid, then converted by C4H into p-coumaric acid, which can enter the synthesis
  of hydroxycinnamic acids (i.e., chlorogenic acid and other phenolics) or it can
  be conjugated with coenzyme A to produce 4-coumaroyl-CoA by 4CL. CHS catalyses the
  condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to naringenin
  chalcone, then converted to the flavanone naringenin by CHI. Indeed, naringenin
  may be converted to flavones by FNSI/FNSII (e.g., maysin in maize), to the red phlobaphenes,
  derived from condensation of the 3-deoxy flavonoids apiferol and luteoforol (a)
  and to dihydroflavonols, such as dihydrokaempferol (DHK), which can then be used
  by F3′H to produce dihydroquercetin (DHQ) or by F3′5′H to form dihydromyricetin
  (DHM) (b). Dihydroflavonols are then converted to flavonols (e.g., kaempferol, quercetin,
  and myricetin) by FLS. Downstream, DFR reduces the dihydroflavonols to their respective
  colourless leucoanthocyanidins, which are then converted into the coloured anthocyanidins
  (e.g., cyanidin, pelargonidin, and delphinidin). The main enzymes catalyzing the
  reactions in the pathway are reported in violet. Regulatory proteins belonging to
  diverse classes of transcription factors are marked with coloured dots. Branches
  leading to different classes of flavonoids and anthocyanins are indicated with diverse
  colours; in B, thicker purple and red arrows highlight the branch leading to the
  most abundant derived anthocyanins. The name of the enzymes is detailed in the abbreviation
  list.
