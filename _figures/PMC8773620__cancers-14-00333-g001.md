caption: The complex Hedgehog signaling cascade and mechanism of action of SMO and
  GLI inhibitors. In the absence of HH proteins, PTCH 1 inhibits Smoothed (SMO) and
  acts as a negative regulator of the HH signaling pathway. Conversely, when HH proteins
  are present, they bind to PTCH1, hindering its inhibition of SMO. Activated SMO
  upregulates the SMO-SUFU-GLI signaling cascade, which promotes the transcription
  of the GLI (glioma-associated oncogenes), leading to tumor proliferation, invasion,
  tumor metastasis and cancer stem cell survival. Vismodegib and sonidegib are two
  small oral molecules that are selective antagonists of the HH pathway, which act
  by directly binding to SMO, inhibiting downstream activation of the HH-signaling
  cascade. GANT-61 is a GLI-inhibitor that has shown potent inhibition of GLI1 and
  GLI2 in preclinical studies of MB cancer cell lines. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) antagonizes
  the canonical SHH pathway by directly binding to GLI1 and has shown anticancer activity
  against MB both in in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. I-BET 151, an inhibitor
  of the bromodomain protein BRD4, has also been shown to directly interact with GLI1
  and GLI2, reducing the GLI-transcriptional activity.
