caption: A) Bile acids are synthesized in the liver and secreted into the GI at a
  concentration of nearly 10 mM. During GI transit, approximately 90% is actively
  reabsorbed and recycled into the liver to be used in new rounds of digestion. During
  this recycling, bile acids signal through FXR, FGF19/15 and FGFR4 to regulate the
  rate limiting step of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1. B) Bile acids are synthesized
  in two pathways. In the alternative pathway, only CDCA (chenodeoxycholate) derivatives
  (in humans) and CDCA / MCA (muricholate) derivatives (in mice) are made. In the
  classical pathway, both CDCA and CA (cholate) derivatives are formed. CA synthesis
  is dependent on CYP8B1 and the absence of CYP8B1 leads to only CDCA (and MCA) formation.
