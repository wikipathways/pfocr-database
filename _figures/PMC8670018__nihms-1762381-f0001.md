caption: RANKL-RANK-OPG function in the thymus. Embryonic medullary thymic epithelial
  cell (mTEC) precursors require TRAF6-dependent RANKL-RANK-mediated activation of
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathway to induce expression of the mTEC transcription factor
  autoimmune regulator (AIRE). During embryogenesis, RANKL-expressing CD3−CD4+IL-7Rα+
  lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and invariant Vγ5 TCR-expressing dendritic epidermal
  T cell (DETC) progenitors control early formation of AIRE+ mTECs. In the postnatal/adult
  thymus, double negative (DN) thymocytes acquire a CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP)
  phenotype in the thymic cortex, interact with cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs)
  during positive selection and migrate to the thymic medulla as CD4+CD8− or CD4−CD8+
  single-positive (SP) thymocytes. In the postnatal/adult thymic medulla, mTEC AIRE
  is induced by RANKL, as well as the other TNFSF member CD40L and LTαβ, expressed
  by TCRαβ high CD4+ SP thymocytes. RANKL is expressed at lower levels by CD8+ SP
  thymocytes, and RANKL-expressing invariant NKT cells also contribute to AIRE+ mTEC
  differentiation. mTECs negatively regulate RANKL-mediated AIRE induction via expression
  and secretion of the inhibitor OPG. Negative selective of SP thymocytes is determined
  by presentation, through MHC-TCR interactions, of peripheral self-antigens (Ag)
  and tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) by mTECs and DCs. TRA presentation requires
  promiscuous gene expression by AIRE+ mTECs and subsequent DCs cross-presentation
  of mTEC-expressed TRAs. SP thymocytes that experience high-affinity TCR interactions
  with peripheral self-antigen or TRAs are either negatively selected via apoptosis
  or induced to become regulatory T cells (Tregs)
