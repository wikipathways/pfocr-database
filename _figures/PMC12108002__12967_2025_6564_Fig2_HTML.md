caption: Major signaling pathways and transcription factors in BMSCs. Factors such
  as alcohol, hormones, or trauma trigger an increase in SAA expression. SAA inhibits
  the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and activates the downstream PPARγ of the MAPK
  signaling pathway. Stimulations with GCs and alcohol can directly reduce bone formation
  by inhibiting the activity of β-catenin by impeding the Wnt signaling pathway. BMP2
  can phosphorylate Smad1/5/9 and drive the activation of osteogenesis and angiogenesis
  while inhibiting adipogenesis. However, Ski, which functions as a negative regulator
  through interactions with Smad proteins, can promote adipogenic differentiation.
  The PI3K/AKT pathway, which is influenced by alcohol stimulation, inhibits proliferation
  and osteogenic differentiation. These signaling pathways target crucial transcription
  factors such as Runx2 for osteogenesis and PPARγ and C/EBPs for adipogenesis
