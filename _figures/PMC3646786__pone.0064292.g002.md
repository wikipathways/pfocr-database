caption: While the metabolic pathway of purine degradation is present in bacteria,
  fungi, plants and animals, there is hidden complexity between species. In addition
  to species in which only part of the pathway is present, these variations include
  at least three examples of convergent evolution (conversion of xanthine to uric
  acid, allantoin to allantoate, and urea to ammonia), offshoots of the pathway that
  are only present in some species (allantoin racemase, ureidoglycine production and
  hydrolysis) as well as points at which spontaneous conversion occur without the
  need for enzyme activity (dashed arrows). Steps predicted to be absent from C. neoformans
  are opaque.
