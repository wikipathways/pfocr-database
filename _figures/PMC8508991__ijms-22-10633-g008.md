caption: 'An overview of the role of Sfp1 in the cellular stress response induced
  by LL-37. Based on the findings of previous studies and this study, LL-37 targets
  cell wall components and causes cell wall remodeling. Consequently, LL-37 activates
  the Mkc1 MAP kinase signaling pathway to maintain cell wall integrity (CWI). LL-37
  also triggers the UPR pathway to adapt and respond to ER stress conditions. Moreover,
  LL-37 likely induces ER-derived ROS accumulation to cause oxidative stress and affects
  ER-related protein secretion. Interestingly, analyses of deletion of the SFP1 gene
  further correlated the role of the transcription factor Sfp1 in cell wall maintenance,
  ER homeostasis and oxidative stress response upon LL-37 treatment. OSR genes: oxidative
  stress responsive genes.'
