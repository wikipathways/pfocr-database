caption: 'Summary of metabolite changes in Lilium “Sorbonne” caused by B. elliptica
  infection. The metabolites not detected are indicated by a gray-filled grid. Dotted
  lines indicated some metabolites, and enzymes are not shown. Metabolites with statistically
  significant (P ≤ 0.05) changes are shown in the heat map, in which blue and red
  colors indicate low and high accumulation, respectively. Data on the number of metabolites
  in the heat map were log-transformed. The six boxes represent control (uninoculated)
  and inoculated samples at different stages of infection (i.e., different time points
  post-inoculation): control_6 h, inoculated_6 h, control_24 h, inoculated_24 h, control_48
  h, and inoculated_48 h (left to right). Different background colors represent different
  metabolic pathways: purple, alkaloid pathway; brown, phenylpropanoid pathway; yellow
  green, benzenoid pathway; blue, flavonoid pathway; green, lignin pathway. Gene names,
  annotations, and RNA-seq data are summarized in . PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, p-coumaroylCoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; CSE, caffeoylshikimate esterase; C3′H, coumaroylquinate 3′-monooxygenase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase;
