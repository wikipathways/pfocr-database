caption: A) Reaction scheme of the TCA cycle, including a canonical topology for the
  Krebs cycle the glyoxylate shunt and the succinic semialdehyde pathway. B) TCA intermediates
  are considerably stable in 70°C water; no reactivity is detected within 5 hours,
  except for oxaloacetate which forms pyruvate (). C) An Archean sediment-like transition
  metal mixture increases reactivity. Isocitrate forms α-ketoglutarate, succinate
  and pyruvate, while α-ketoglutarate forms succinate ().D) Reactions as identified
  (C) projected to a TCA cycle graph. α-hydroxyl and α-keto moieties that allow specific
  interaction with ferrous iron are indicated in red.
