caption: Major components and auxiliary factors of the Notch signaling pathway (modified
  from [6]). In signal-receiving cells, Notch receptors are first synthesized in the
  endoplasmic reticulum and then translocated to the Golgi apparatus, where EGF-like
  repeat sequences undergo glycosylation modification during translocation. The Notch
  receptor then undergoes S1 cleavage in the Golgi to form a heterodimer and is transported
  to the cell membrane. In the presence of ubiquitin ligase, some Notch receptors
  on the cell membrane are endocytosed into the nuclear endosome, which has an acidic
  environment and contains ADAMs and γ-secretase. Notch receptors in endosomes have
  two fates, they can either be recirculated to the cell membrane and cleaved to the
  NICD (the E3 ubiquitin ligase Deltex acts as an activator of Notch, capable of upregulating
  Notch), or they are translocated to lysosomes for degradation. In signaling cells,
  the Notch ligand is inactive at the cell membrane, and after Neur or Mib ubiquitination,
  the ligand is activated and a Notch signaling cascade occurs (ligand–receptor binding
  indicated by bright red triangles). The ligand can then be endocytosed and the accompanying
  pulling force induces traction of the bound ligand and receptor toward the side
  of the signaling cell. In the absence of traction, the S2 site of the Notch receptor
  is masked by the NRR, and with increasing traction, the S2 cleavage site is exposed,
  allowing for a second cleavage to occur. ADAMs are indispensable for S2 cleavage.
  The product of Notch undergoing S2 cleavage is NEXT, which also has two fates, either
  remaining on the cell membrane and binding to γ-secretase to undergo a third cleavage
  (S3 cleavage) to produce the NICD, or endocytosis into the endosome and binding
  to γ-secretase on the membrane to undergo cleavage to produce either NICD or NEXT
  translocation to the lysosome for degradation. In total, there are three approaches
  to generate the NICD, which are classified as ligand-independent activation, ligand-dependent
  endocytosis-independent activation, and ligand-dependent endocytic activation. The
  resulting NICD can undergo phosphorylation modifications, leading to FBXW7-mediated
  NICD degradation. The NICD can translocate into the nucleus or remain in the cytoplasm
  to crosstalk with other signaling pathways such as NFκB, mTORC2, AKT, and Wnt. In
  the absence of the NICD, CSL binds to transcriptional repressors to inhibit the
  transcription of target genes. Once the NICD enters the nucleus, it can bind to
  CSL to recruit MAML, release transcriptional repressors, and recruit coactivators
  to promote the transcription of Notch target genes. The top right corner is the
  structural view of the ligand and the bottom left corner is the structural view
  of the receptor. NICD, Notch intracellular domain; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
