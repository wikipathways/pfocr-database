caption: (A) Workflow of the reverse engineering process. A Boolean network model
  was used to deduce the constraints on the network interactions from the discrete
  time trajectory. After generating all possible networks, the minimal network constraint
  and prior knowledge about signal transduction were incorporated to select for minimal
  circuits responsible for the shmoo formation. (B) The resulting regulatory circuit.
  Solid and dashed edges are used to denote the canonical pheromone response pathway
  and novel regulations, respectively. Edges with bar-end, regulation of inhibition;
  edges with arrow-end, activation. The input of the network is the TFs activated
  by pheromone that can directly regulate gene expression, such as Ste12 and Tec1.
