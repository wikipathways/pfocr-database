caption: Sulfur switches can exist as "Redox Sensors" and as "Redox Rheostats" in
  generic redox circuitry models. Simplified models show (A) oxidative stress pathway
  (solid line) associated with high levels of ROS, RNS, and free radicals from mitochondrial
  dysfunction, NADPH oxidase activation, and nitric oxide synthase activation triggered
  by pathologic upstream signals. Redox signaling pathway (B, broken line) shows the
  process involving relatively low levels of diffusible reactive species associated
  with physiologic condition. In redox signaling, the small diffusible reactive species,
  termed "redox messengers" are generated by ROS/RNS sources and react with redox-sensitive
  macromolecules termed "redox sensors". These redox sensors are often sulfur switches,
  consisting of sulfur atoms within specific proteins. Sulfur switches also occur
  as regulatory elements, termed "redox rheostats", which are not needed to define
  the pathway but regulate its activity. The characteristics of these sulfur switches
  can differ because the redox sensors are integral components of pathways while the
  sulfur rheostats regulate activity.
