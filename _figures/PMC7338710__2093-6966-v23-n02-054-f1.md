caption: Nuclear Factor-κB pathway. The nuclear factor-kappa (NF-_B) level differently
  regulates cartilage homeostasis. Upon ligand binding to the receptor present on
  the cell surface, the activated IKK causes phosphorylation of IκB which further
  results in NF-κB activation which translocate to the nucleus where serves as a transcription
  factor and bind to DNA to induce NF-κB target gene transcription which further results
  in various cellular responses like Apoptosis, Inflammation, Proliferation and Hypertrophy
  in chondrocytes. NF- κB induces catabolic gene expression through NF-_B response
  elements located in the promoters of the MMP1, MMP9, MMP13 and ADAMTS5 genes.
