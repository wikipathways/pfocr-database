caption: 'Molecular regulation of MSCs during bone formation. (a) Ihh pathway: Indian
  hedgehog (Ihh) stimulates, directly or indirectly (through the parathyroid hormone-related
  peptide (PTHrp) synthesis), chondrocytes proliferation and their differentiation
  into hypertrophic or larger cells. Ihh binds to its receptor Patched (Ptch), which
  inhibits Smoothened (Smo). The resulting activation of Smo leads to an increase
  of intracellular concentration of Gli proteins (Gli activator (GliA) and Gli repressor
  (GliR)) subsequent of the inhibition of their degradation regulated by glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK3β), protein kinase A (PKA), and casein kinase (CSK). After
  translocation into the nucleus, Gli activator could bind to its promoter and stimulate
  various genes'' expression, especially Runx2 [, ]. (b) PTH and PTHrp pathway: parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related (PTHrp) bind to PTH-receptor1 (PTHr1),
  which is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates adenylate cyclase. This leads
  to cAMP production, PKA and PKC stimulation, and Runx2 expression. The exact mechanism
  leading to Runx2 is still unknown. (c) BMP pathway: bone morphogenetic proteins
  (BMPs) binds to a tetrameric receptor encompassing type I (BMPR1) and type II (BMPR2)
  receptors that are serine-threonine kinases. The receptor activation induces signal
  transduction through Smads or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Smads are
  cytoplasmic molecules that are classified into 3 subsets: (1) receptor-regulated
  Smads (Smads 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8); (2) common-partner Smads (Smad 4); (3) inhibitory
  Smads (Smads 6, 7). Smads 1, 5, and 8 are activated by phosphorylation induced by
  BMPs interacting with their receptors. Receptor-regulated phosphorylated Smads are
  then able to form a dimeric complex with Smad 4 allowing its nuclear translocation.
  When phosphorylated, Smads 6 and 7 both inhibit Smads 1, 5, and 8 phosphorylation
  and Smad 4 linking []. In the nucleus, the dimeric Smad complex will induce the
  target genes expression such as Runx2, distal-less homeobox 5 (Dlx5), and osterix
  (Osx) which are osteoblastic genes [, ]. (d) Wnt-β catenin canonical pathway: Wnt
  molecules are involved in multiple cell functions, including osteogenesis. Wnt-1,
  Wnt-3a, Wnt-4, Wnt-5, Wnt-10b, and Wnt-13, are essential in bone formation []. Wnt
  binds to its receptor Frizzled (Fzd) and coreceptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (Lrp). In absence of binding, dishevelled (Dsh) remains inactivated in the
  cytoplasm and β catenin can form a complex with GSK3β, adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC), and axin that leads to their degradation by ubiquitination. When Wnt binds
  to its receptor, phosphorylated Dsh induces axin and GSK3β inhibition and thus leads
  to β-catenin accumulation. β-Catenin is then able to translocate into the nucleus
  where it drives the target genes expression. (e) MAPK pathway: mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) are able to phosphorylate and inhibit GSK3β and Smads 1,
  5, and 8 activities. They are also able to induce Runx2 and Dlx5 expression. MAPK
  can be triggered by epithelial growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
  and BMPs.'
