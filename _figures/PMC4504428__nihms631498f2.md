caption: In normal tissues the expression of MDM2 and p53 are balanced; whereas in
  HCC cells the balance is disrupted, where the expression of MDM2 can be high and
  p53 can be low. This imbalance can be attained through the higher expression of
  SRF, Enigma Lim, HBx and PRL-1 in combination with lower expression of KLF6, Sirt3,
  and ING1. Furthermore, up-regulation of rRNA synthesis can inhibit p53 due to reduced
  ribosomal protein availability for MDM2 binding. (Larger shapes depict higher expression
  of the indicated proteins and thicker lines depict up-regulation of indicated pathways.)
