caption: 'Possible signal transduction pathway triggered by extracellular Pi in mammalian
  cells. Type III Na/Pi cotransporter, especially PiT-1, plays a major role in the
  sensing of the cells to the altered extracellular Pi concentration. Increased extracellular
  Pi binds to type III Na/Pi cotransporter on the plasma membrane, then induces activation
  of FGFR, Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, and Akt pathway, which subsequently regulates gene
  transcription through binding of several transcription factors (e.g., AP1, Nrf2,
  Egr1) to the phosphate response element in the nucleus. The signaling molecule(s)
  that link between type III Na/Pi cotransporter and FGFR are currently unknown.Abbreviations:
  AP1, activator protein 1; Egr1, early growth response 1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
