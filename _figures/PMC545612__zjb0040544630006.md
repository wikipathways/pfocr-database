caption: Metabolic neighbors of the pta-ackA pathway during anaerobic growth in a
  rich medium. The aerobic overflow pathway (phosphoenolpyruvate→pyruvate→acetyl-CoA→acetate)
  is indicated by boldface arrows. The anaerobic mixed-acid fermentation is shown
  by thin arrows with open arrowheads. Excreted products are marked by thick downward
  open arrows. Only the key substances are shown.
