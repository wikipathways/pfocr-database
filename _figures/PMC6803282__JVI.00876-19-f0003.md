caption: 'Mechanistic network analysis predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The
  figure shows mechanistic network analysis by IPA of genes differentially expressed
  in experimentally induced OPA compared to mock-infected lung. (A) Neovascularization
  network. (B) Network for cell viability and tumor growth. The regulators are colored
  by their predicted activation state: activated (orange) or inhibited (blue). Darker
  colors indicate higher scores. The edges connecting the nodes are colored orange
  when leading to activation of the downstream node, blue when leading to its inhibition,
  and yellow if the findings underlying the relationship are inconsistent with the
  state of the downstream node. Pointed arrowheads indicate that the downstream node
  is expected to be activated if the upstream node connected to it is activated, while
  blunt arrowheads indicate that the downstream node is expected to be inhibited if
  the upstream node that connects to it is activated.'
