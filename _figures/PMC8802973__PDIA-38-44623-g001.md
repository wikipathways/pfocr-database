caption: The contribution of interleukins (IL) 12, 17, 23 and tumour necrosis factor
  α (TNF-α) to the tumour microenvironment in mycosis fungoides (MF). IL-12 has been
  indirectly restoring the cytotoxic mediated CD8(+) answer and promoting tumour regression
  by stimulating the differentiation of pre-T-helper 1 lymphocytes. IL-23 can stimulate
  pre-T-helper 1 lymphocytes, followed by creating T-helper 17 cells subset and increased
  secretion of IL-17 proinflammatory cytokines. MF cell is also able to secrete IL-17A,
  IL-17F and IL-17A/IL-17F heterodimers. It is reinforced by upregulated JAK3/STAT3
  pathway, which has been shown to be promoted by activated T-cell receptor (TCR),
  which is necessary for malignant transformation in MF to occur. One of the possible
  ways of activating TCR is related to Staphylococcal enterotoxin A. NF-kB upregulation,
  with its anti-apoptotic effect on lymphoma cells, seems to be important and relevant
  in the pathogenesis of CTCL. It has been promoted by TNF-α as well as proinflammatory
  IL-17 cytokines. IL-25 (IL-17E) is promoting STAT6 pathway. Those interactions result
  in increased IL-13 secretion (also in autocrine manner). Especially in the advanced
  stage of the disease it contributes to forming Th-2 cytokine profile, what results
  in decreased cytotoxic immunosurveillance and tumour growth
