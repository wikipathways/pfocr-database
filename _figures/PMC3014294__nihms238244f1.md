caption: A) mAKAP assembles a cAMP-responsive complex of signaling enzymes at the
  perinuclear membrane in the heart. PKA, PDE4D3 Epac1 and ERK5 are brought together
  with other associated enzymes to control different aspects of cardiomyocyte physiology.
  B) When intracellular cAMP levels are elevated the mAKAP-associated PKA phosphorylates
  the PDE4D3 in the complex at two sites, leading to increased metabolism of cAMP
  by the phosphodiesterase. Likewise, cAMP activation of Epac1 in the complex activates
  Rap1 to inhibit ERK5 signaling. C) As cAMP levels fall, the Epac1-mediated inhibition
  of ERK signaling is lost and mitogenic signaling favors cell growth. D) mAKAP assembles
  an oxygen sensitive signaling pathway that includes the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah2,
  prolyl hydroxylase, von Hippel-Lindau protein and the transcription factor HIF-1α.
  Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is continually degraded however, when oxygen levels
  fall, the mAKAP associated PHD is degraded and HIF-1α accumulates and translocates
  into the nucleus.
