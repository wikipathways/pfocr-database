caption: A proposed mechanism in this study. HDM stimulates PAR2 activation on HBECs,
  followed by a downstream signaling pathway through ERK phosphorylation and TSLP
  production, which can be suppressed by preincubation of PAR2 antagonist or ERK inhibitor.
  HBECs-generated TSLP in a conditioned medium contributes to fibroblast proliferation
  and collagen production in human fibroblasts. Based on the findings, this concept
  can be proved that fibroblast proliferation and collagen production in HLFs can
  be enhanced by recombined TSLP or suppressed by anti-TSLP neutralization antibodies.
  HBECs, human bronchial epithelial cells. HLFs, human lung fibroblasts
