caption: Membrane-anchored ST2/soluble ST2 isoforms functional differences in role
  and expression. Membrane-anchored ST2 (ST2) expression is controlled by the distal
  promoter region through the promoters GATA1, GATA2 and PU.1. ST2 comprises the functional
  receptor in the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway. Soluble ST2 (sST2) expression is controlled
  by the proximal promoter region. Its promoters remain to be elucidated and the isoform
  share the same extracellular domain which makes sST2 a competitive inhibitor of
  ST2 in the IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway.
