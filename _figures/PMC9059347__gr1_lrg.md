caption: Endogenous cholesterol synthesis and monitoring of cellular cholesterol levels.
  When the amount of accessible cholesterol in the plasma membrane exceeds a threshold
  level, the excess cholesterol is moved to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a non-vesicular
  mechanism mediated by the Aster/GRAMD1 family of sterol transporters. The sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) is the main regulator of the cholesterol
  biosynthesis. SREBP2 is proteolytically activated at the Golgi, releasing the N-term
  transcription factor domain that translocates to the nucleus. Upon migration into
  the nucleus (long purple arrow), SREBP2 transactivates target genes via the binding
  of the sterol regulatory elements (SRE) to the gene promoters. In the ER, cholesterol
  regulates the SREBP2 pathway and undergoes esterification. SCAP and INSIG are sterol-sensing
  proteins that monitor cholesterol and oxysterol levels in the ER, respectively.
  When INSIG binds SCAP, the complex retains SREBP2 in the ER. If the SREBP-activating
  protein (SCAP) is not bound to INSIG, the SCAP-SREBP2 is exported to the Golgi complex
  (long red arrow). Fluctuations of <5% in cholesterol levels in the ER suffice to
  trigger SREBBP2 cleavage (short red arrow). Phosphatidylserine is a serine phospholipid
  present in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane that is also recognized by the
  GRAM domain of Aster/GRAMD1 proteins and modulates cholesterol transport from the
  PM to the ER.
