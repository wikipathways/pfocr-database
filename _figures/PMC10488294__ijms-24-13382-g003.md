caption: 'AML cell differentiation by S100A9. A high ratio of S100A9 to S100A8, when
  S100A9 binds to TLR-4, results in phosphorylation and activation of p38, JNK, and
  ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways increases differentiation
  of AML cells and mice survival. (TLR4: toll-like receptor 4, ERK1/2: extracellular
  signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase, AML: acute
  myeloid leukemia). Created with BioRender.com'
