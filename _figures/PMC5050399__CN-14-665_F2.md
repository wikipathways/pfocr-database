caption: IDO and kynurenine monooxygenase activity are enhanced by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, and as a result the balance between the formation of 3-hydroxykynurenine
  and of kynurenic acid is shifted to the side of 3-hydroxykynurenine, which forms
  3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and finally quinolinic acid. As KYN synthesized in the
  periphery can also penetrate the brain, KYN pathway metabolism in the brain is also
  initiated by KYN that crosses the blood brain barrier. KYN and 3-hydroxykynurenine
  easily cross the BBB, whereas quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid crosses the BBB
  poorly. The 3-hydroxykynurenine arm of the pathway leading to quinolinic acid production
  takes place in microglia, and kynurenic acid production takes place in astrocytes.
  The KYN pathway in the microglia can be enhanced in inflammatory conditions, as
  kynurenine monooxygenase activity is enhanced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Immune
  responses can also activate microglia and cause an influx of macrophages into the
  brain, which causes a significant increase in quinolinic acid synthesis.
