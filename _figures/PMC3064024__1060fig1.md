caption: The relationship between binding of ligands to the pattern recognition AGE
  receptor, RAGE and inflammation, gene expression, oxidative and nitrosative stress,
  and damage to the macro- and microvasculature. Elevated levels of glucose bind to
  proteins and form AGEs (I), which bind to RAGEs. RAGE signaling activates NADPH
  oxidase (II) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (III). Increased ROS
  increases advance oxidation protein products (AOPPs), more AGEs, and AGE-modification
  of oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs). Furthermore, increased ROS may deplete glutathione, thereby
  suppressing glyoxalase I activity, a mechanism favoring further AGE accumulation
  (IV). AGEs, AOPPs, macrophage glycoprotein (MAC-1), and AGE-oxLDL ligands of RAGE
  sustain stimulation of RAGE, and these processes, together with increased ROS, activate
  key transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Egr-1 (V), which
  increase gene transcription factors and activate inflammatory mechanisms (VI). Consequences
  include increased migration and activation of RAGE-expressing neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages,
  T-cells, and dendritic cells (VII). This results in the release of the proinflammatory
  RAGE ligands S100/calgranulins and high-mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1). In
  this inflammatory environment, further AGEs may be formed as well. Via interaction
  with RAGE, these ligands magnify activation of NF-κB, Agr-1, and other factors (VIII),
  thereby amplifying cellular stress and tissue damage leading to neurovascular and
  bone dysfunction. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) formed from cleavage of RAGE by disintegrins
  such as ADAM 10, a metalloproteinase, and β- and γ-secretases. sRAGE or a spliced
  variant (esRAGE) compete for binding of ligands to RAGE, and a deficiency could
  theoretically initiate the sequence of events activating an inflammatory cascade
  with an increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (E-selectin, endothelin-1
  tissue factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other proinflammatory cytokines
  [interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α]) and damage to neurons, kidney, eye,
  the vasculature, and even bone. Increasing sRAGE or its administration could competitively
  reduce activation of the AGE/RAGE pathway and it consequences. Modified with permission
