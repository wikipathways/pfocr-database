caption: The BMP signaling pathway in apical papilla cells during tooth root development.
  Created with BioRender.com. BMP ligands (such as BMP2/4) bind to BMP receptor type
  II and BMP receptor type I (BMPR1A/ACVR1) complexes, thus activating canonical and
  noncanonical BMP signaling and modulating the expression of downstream target genes,
  including Dspp, Klf4, Dkk1 and Osx. As BMP signaling is blocked by ablation of BMP
  ligands or BMP receptors, the expressions of WNT antagonists, Dkk1 and Sost, are
  downregulated, but β-catenin and Ibsp is upregulated. As a result, it specifies
  the fate of dental pulp and promotes the differentiation of apical papilla cells
  into odontoblasts. Noggin acts as an extracellular antagonist, suppressing BMP signaling
  leads to reduced size in the first and second maxillary molars, altered crown patterns,
  and failed formation of multiple roots.
