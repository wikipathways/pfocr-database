caption: Simplified schematic presentation of HCV genotype 2a-mediated blocking of
  the insulin signaling pathway. We suggested previously that HCV infection upregulates
  Ser-312 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and impairs the Akt signaling pathway by modulation
  of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the upstream insulin signaling pathway (). Analysis
  of the downstream signaling pathway reveals that HCV further downregulates tumor
  suppressor TSC1/TSC2, resulting in an upregulation of Rheb. This results in downstream
  activation of mTOR and S6K1, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of IRS-1,
  causing insulin resistance. Directions of solid arrows on the side indicate up-
  or downregulation of specific signaling molecules.
