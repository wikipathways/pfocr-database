caption: Pharmacology of nitric oxide signaling. NO is generated by glutamatergic
  stimulation of NMDARs, but other sources of calcium from Calcium permeable AMPAR
  or L-type calcium channels are also recognized. Calcium influx activates nNOS (via
  calmodulin) which catalyzes the conversion of the amino-acid arginine to citrulline,
  releasing NO. nNOS activity may be blocked by competitive antagonists such as L-NAME
  (NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl), absorbed by chelating agents, or generated
  independently of nNOS by perfusion of NO donors. NO diffuses across cytoplasm, membranes
  and between cells to bind to its intracellular receptor – soluble guanylyl cyclase
  (sGC) which catalyzes GTP to cGMP – a cyclic nucleotide which activates protein
  kinase G (PKG). ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) is a competitive
  blocker of sGC, while BAY 41-2272 is a positive modulator. KT 5873 is an antagonist
  of PKG. cGMP signaling may in turn be suppressed with phosphodiesterases, such as
  PDE5, which can be blocked by sildenafil. Blockers or antagonists are shown in red,
  chelating agents in orange, and positive modulators in green. The canonical pathway
  is indicated by the thick black arrows, with links from other sources by fine arrows,
  and the spectrum of PKG actions via dashed arrows.
