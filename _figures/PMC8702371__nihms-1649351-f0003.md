caption: 'In this algorithm, tumor tissue types are further delineated using histologic
  and molecular features that have data supporting their use in animal models and
  early phase clinical studies. Breast cancer is first delineated by the presence
  of alterations in the PI3K pathway, which are predicted to grow in response to systemic
  insulin. The treatment of these tumors, and endometroid subtypes of endometrial
  cancer that also have high PI3K activity, should be paired with a very low carbohydrate
  diet (VLCD). Other types of breast cancer may respond best to combination therapies
  using the fasting mimicking diet (FMD) or low fat diets (LFD). We speculate that
  this paradigm can also be used for prostate cancer and glioblastoma, however the
  specific subtypes that respond well to each diet have not been demonstrated. APC-mutated
  colorectal cancers develop and progress in response to a variety of dietary components
  like red meat, processed meat, fructose-containing sugars, and low fiber diets so
  a plant-based whole food (PBWF) approach may be best in this setting. PIK3CA: gene
  for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 alpha; PTEN: gene for Phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; APC: gene for adenomatous polyposis coli; FMD: fasting mimicking diet;
  LFD: low fat diet; VLCD: very low carbohydrate diet; PBWF: plant-based whole food
  diet.'
