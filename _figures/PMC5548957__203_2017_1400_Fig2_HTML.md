caption: 'Rotavirus interactions with the host innate system: viral entry into cells
  and viral double strand RNA (dsRNA) induce the generation of pathogen-associated
  molecular pathways (PAMPs). As a result, cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors
  (PRRs), such as RIG-I and MDA-5 are activated, leading to mitochondrial-associated
  adaptor protein MAVS-dependent activation of transcription factor IRF3/IRF7. Activated
  IRF3/IRF7 translocates to nucleus, where it induces the transcription of several
  genes resulting in the transcription and expression of IFN-α/β. IFN secretion from
  rotavirus infected cells results in the establishment of antiviral state in bystander
  cells, mediated by signaling through the transcription factors STAT1, STAT2, and
  IRF9. The viral protein NSP1 induces proteosomal degradation of RIG-I, MAVS, IRF3,
  and IRF7. On the other hand, the induction of IFN in rotavirus infected cells also
  requires nuclear factor κβ (NF-κβ), following the proteosomal degradation of its
  inhibitory partner IκB-α; NSP1 can block this pathway by inducing the proteosomal
  degradation of β-TrCP, which is an essential co-factor for IκB-α degradation. As
  a result, NSP1 affects the quality and intensity of the interferon response (Arnold
  and Patton ; Estes and Greenberg )'
