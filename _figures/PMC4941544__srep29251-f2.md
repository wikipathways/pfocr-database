caption: The green rectangle nodes and black arrows show the KEGG genes and their
  interactions while the blue nodes and red arrows show the miRNAs and their interactions
  with the genes, respectively. In each miRNA node added, we show the total number
  of miRNAs (blue circles) that are known to target the gene, and the names of the
  miRNA (blue rectangles) that were actually measured in the 8 colorectal miRNA datasets.
  This is a subset of the total set of miRNAs known to target genes on this pathway.
