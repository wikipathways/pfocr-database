caption: The occurrence of ferroptosis involves the transition metal iron, ROS, and
  PUFA-PLs. In a healthy body, System Xc- protects against oxidative stress damage,
  which consists of two subunits, SLC7A11 and SLC3A2. This system promotes the production
  of GSH by transporting cystine into cells and reducing it to cysteine. In the human
  body, GSH is a powerful reducing agent. As a cofactor of GPX4, it can convert reduced
  GSH into oxidized GSH and reduce lipid peroxides, thereby reducing oxidative stress
  damage. Therefore, System Xc- and GPX4 are important regulatory targets in ferroptotic
  amino acid metabolism. In a hyperthermic environment, p53 in the body increases
  significantly through the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. By acting on the SLC7A11 subunit of
  System Xc-, the antioxidant system in the body is imbalanced, ultimately leading
  to the accumulation of lipid peroxidation and cell death. In addition, another pathway
  has been found to induce ferroptosis in EHS. The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway targets
  ACSL4 to promote ferroptosis. In previous studies, ACSL4 has been shown to contribute
  to the execution of ferroptosis by esterifying CoA to specific polyunsaturated fatty
  acids. Therefore, this pathway positively regulates ferroptosis and aggravates cell
  damage under HS
