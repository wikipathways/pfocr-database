caption: Some examples of the cross-talk of circRNA and m6A modification in HCC. (a)
  The m6A modification of YAP promoted the binding between miR-582-3p and the YAP
  mRNA. In addition, it promoted HuR binding and stabilizing miR-582-3p, so as to
  downregulate the expression of YAP. circ104075 could upregulate YAP expression by
  absorbing miR-582-3p, thus contributing to HCC progression through Hippo signaling
  pathway. (b) m6A modification stabilized circRNA-SORE, and circRNA-SORE acted as
  miR-103a-2-5p and miR-660-3p sponge so as to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and
  promote the progression of HCC. (c) ZEB1 acted as a target of circ-KIAA1429 and
  could be recognized by m6A “reader” YTHDF3, which could enhance the stability of
  ZEB1 mRNA. ZEB1 was also a critical transcription factor of EMT process. Therefore,
  upregulating the expression of ZEB1 by circ-KIAA1429 could accelerate the EMT process,
  and further facilitate the development of HCC.
