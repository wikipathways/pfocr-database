caption: Perception and transduction of cytokinin (CK) and ethylene (ET) signals in
  the model plant Arabidopsis. (A) The cytokinin signaling pathway. The perception
  of CKs in Arabidopsis primarily involves the perception of these hormones by dimerized
  receptors such as the CRE1 receptor via the cyclase/histidine kinase-associated
  sensing extracellular (CHASE) domain. CRE1 then auto-phosphorylates (histidine kinase
  (HK) activity) and immediately transfers its phosphate group to the conserved histidine
  of a protein belonging to the histidine-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) family.
  This small protein then acts as a cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttle and in turn phosphorylates
  a type B response regulator, which, when activated, positively regulates the transcription
  of response genes to the CK signal. (B) The ET signaling pathway. Ethylene molecules
  are detected by ethylene receptors (epitomized here by ETR1) with ethylene binding
  to the three transmembrane helices (in sky blue). Binding of ET to the dimerized
  ETR1 receptor downregulates its activity. In the absence of ET, ETR1 activates the
  serine/threonine kinase CTR1. The CTR1 protein then phosphorylates the EIN2 protein
  located in the ER membrane, leading to the proteolysis of EIN2. In the presence
  of ET, ETR1 activity is reduced, leading to less CTR1 activity; this leads to lower
  phosphorylation and accumulation of EIN2 protein and subsequent activation of the
  EIN3 and related transcription factors. EIN3 then positively regulates the transcription
  of ET signal response genes. (C) The domain structure of the Arabidopsis ET (ETR1)
  and CK (CRE1) receptors.
