caption: 'Tonifying Kidney and Activating Blood decoction demonstrates potential therapeutic
  effects by inhibiting ventricular fibrosis and the activation of the p38MAPK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, as well as repairing the blood-brain barrier in chronic heart
  failure rats.This suggests a significant role of the p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in the pathogenesis of ventricular fibrosis and blood-brain barrier damage.Abbreviations:
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B.(By BioRender
