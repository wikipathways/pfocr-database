caption: Working model for the role of CCN6 in breast cancer invasion. Our data support
  the hypothesis that CCN6 regulates the levels and activity of IGF-1R signaling pathway
  in mammary epithelial cells. Low levels of CCN6, as found in aggressive invasive
  carcinomas of the breast, result in activation of IGF-1R signaling and increased
  ZEB1 levels and function.

  IGF-1 receptor signaling in breast cancer.
