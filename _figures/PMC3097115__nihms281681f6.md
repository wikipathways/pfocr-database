caption: 'Positive interactions are depicted with arrows, while negative interactions
  are depicted with T-bars. Proteins are shown in capital letters; gene names are
  shown in lower case italics. (A) The core GLP-1 Notch signaling pathway shown with
  the downstream GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways that promote entry into meiosis (; ). PRP-17
  and other C. elegans splicing factor orthologs promote meiotic development by positively
  regulating the GLD-1 pathway through the splicing of mRNAs of genes that function
  in this pathway. Because the relevant direct splicing targets of PRP-17/ spliceosome
  have not yet been identified, we show general positive regulation on the GLD-1 pathway
  as a whole. (B) The core germline sex determination pathway in C. elegans (). In
  hermaphrodites GLD-1 and FOG-2 act to promote spermatogenesis by repression of tra-2
  mRNA in early larvae; the switch to oogenesis occurs upon repression of fem-3 mRNA
  and derepression of tra-2 mRNA in late larvae. PRP-17 and other splicing factor
  orthologs may promote the oocyte fate in C. elegans germline sex determination via
  splicing of the mRNA of an unknown gene (or genes) X, which functions as a translational
  repressor of fem-3 mRNA during hermaphrodite oogenesis. In (A), PRP-17 and the splicing
  factors have been placed downstream of GLP-1 signaling as triple mutants of glp-1
  null, gld-3 null with prp-17, mog-1 or mog-6 mutations (described here) and teg-4
  () are tumorous, demonstrating that glp-1 activity is not required for the overproliferation
  phenotype. Previous work indicated that the GLD-2 polyA polymerase and the GLD-3
  Bicaudal-C related RNA binding protein function together to promote entry into meiosis
  (; ; ;  and ). Therefore, we were surprised to find that the gld-2(q497) prp-17(oz273);
  glp-1(q175) triple mutant is not tumorous, but rather has the glp-1 premature meiotic
  entry phenotype, with similar results in triple mutants with mog-1 and mog-6 (data
  not shown) as well as for teg-4 (). There are other situations where gld-2 and gld-3
  do not behave identically in the proliferation versus meiosis decision. gld-3(q730)
  has a stronger meiotic entry defect in combination with gld-1 or nos-3 null alleles
  than does gld-2(q497) (;  and ). The genetic behavior of the pas-5 proteasome subunit
  shows a similar set of interactions with gld-2, gld-3 and glp-1 as the splicing
  factor mutants: the pas-5; gld-3; glp-1 mutant is tumorous while gld-2 pas-5; glp-1
  mutant shows the glp-1 premature meiotic entry phenotype (). How might GLD-2 and
  GLD-3 function together yet display some different genetic behaviors? One possibility
  is that GLD-3 may have a separate function, outside of its role with GLD-2, in promoting
  entry into meiosis, possibly in the proposed third pathway that acts in parallel
  to the GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways (). Alternatively, although the gld-2(q497) allele
  used these experiments is a stop mutation (), it may not fully eliminate gld-2 activity.
  In contrast, the gld-3(q730) allele is a deletion that likely eliminates all gld-3
  activity. While the reasons for differences in behavior of gld-2 and gld-3 remain
  to be resolved, the finding that the tumorous phenotype of the gld-3 null with splicing
  factor mutants is independent of glp-1 activity strongly supports the proposal that
  the splicing factors function, at least in part, downstream of GLP-1 signaling.'
