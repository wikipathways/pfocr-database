caption: Hypoxia induces a HIF-1-mediated signaling cascade that results nuclear translocation
  of HIF-1α and activation of hypoxia-regulated genes, including GLUT1, MCT1/4 and
  CAIX. Cells reprogram their metabolism to engage the glycoytic pathway, a “glycolytic
  switch” that results in increased production and export of lactate, leading to a
  decline in pHe. One consequence of extracellular acidification is the disruption
  of the intracellular pH (pHi), a decrease in which rapidly affects basic cellular
  functions. The overexpression of CAIX in hypoxia catalyzes the hydrolysis of CO2
  to HCO3− and H+ in the extracellular microenvironment. The HCO3− is actively transported
  into the cancer cell, thereby regulating pHi and maintaining cell survival. The
  H+ participate in the generation of an increasingly acidic extracellular space,
  promoting tumor cell invasiveness. Inhibition of CAIX catalytic activity using monoclonal
  antibodies or specific small molecule inhibitors prevent the production of these
  enzymatic metabolites, leading to decreased survival and reduced invasive capacity.
