caption: 'ASC-mediated switch between pyroptosis and apoptosis: intracellular pathogens
  and their products lead to activation of the ASC-dependent inflammasome. Strong
  inflammasome activation preferentially leads to caspase 1 recruitment and activation,
  and associated pyroptosis, IL-1β and IL-18 activation, and inflammation. Pathogen-derived
  inhibitors may prevent caspase 1 activation. Weak inflammasome activation promotes
  ASC-mediated caspase 8 recruitment and activation of the apoptotic pathway. Depending
  on the signaling cell type (type I or II), the mitochondrial signaling pathway may
  or may not be engaged'
