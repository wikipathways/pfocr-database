caption: Major pathways of apoptosis. An extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (left) involves
  the stimulation through binding of death receptor (e.g., FasR and TNFR) to their
  respective ligands (e.g., FasL and TNF-α), recruiting adaptive proteins such as
  Fas-associated death-domain (FADD) and pro-caspase-8 (pro-C8), forming death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) and relaying signals to activation of effector caspases
  such as caspase-3 (C3), C6, and C7. In addition, Bid is also activated, which transduces
  these death signals to the intrinsic pathway. On the other hand, an intrinsic pathway
  of apoptosis is induced in response to cellular stresses such as DNA damage and
  ROS that increase the expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g., Bid,
  Bad, and Bax), while repressing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g., Bcl-2,
  Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), leading to an alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential
  and the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C). Proteins such as Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  (C9) are activated, resulting in the formation of an apoptosome, which then stimulate
  the activation of effector caspases. NF-κB and JNK/ASK-1 also play a role in apoptotic
  signaling through the regulation of antiapoptotic molecules such as FLIP and Bcl-2.
