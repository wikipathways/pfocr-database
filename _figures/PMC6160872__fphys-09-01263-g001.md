caption: 'Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and O-glycosylation with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine
  during pregnancy. (Pink rectangle) Around 3–5% of intracellular glucose is converted
  through the HBP to substrate for enzymes involved in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc,
  consequently leading to protein modification through O-GlcNAc. OGT catalyzes the
  addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins, whereas OGA removes O-GlcNAc from proteins. (Bigger
  figure) Under physiological conditions, O-GlcNAc modifications to intracellular
  proteins are essential for embryogenesis, promoting the function and viability of
  various cell types. This process may be disrupted under specific conditions, including
  hyperglycemia or OGA disruption, where an increase in O-GlcNAc is observed, with
  a consequent reduction in cell proliferation, impaired blastocyst formation and
  decreased embryo viability. Abbreviations: HBP, Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway;
  O-GlcNAc, glycosylation with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine; OGA, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase;
  OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase.'
