caption: The Hippo pathway acts as an endogenous block to sustained mammalian MG proliferation
  and reprogramming. MG normally express low levels of the S phase-promoting protein
  cyclin D1 (CyD), which is a direct transcriptional target of YAP/TEAD. However,
  due to co-expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27KIP1, cyclin D1 activity
  is repressed and MG are kept in a quiescent state. Upon retinal damage, p27KIP1
  expression is lost coincident with upregulation of cyclin D1 expression and activity,
  which triggers MG to enter the S phase. However, over an additional 12-24 h, the
  MG exit the cell cycle and are prevented from expanding clonally into a proliferative,
  progenitor-like population. This block in MG cell cycle re-entry is due to Hippo
  pathway-mediated phosphorylation of YAP, which leads to YAP cytoplasmic retention
  or ubiquitin degradation. As a consequence, YAP is kept out of the nucleus and cyclin
  D1 is not expressed in MG.
