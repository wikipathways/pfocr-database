caption: Contrasting strategies for disrupting interferon (IFN)-mediated responses
  in hepatitis A virus (HAV) versus hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections. (A) In HAV-infected
  cells, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates are sensed by
  cytosolic retinoic acid activated gene I (RIG-I)-like RNA (RLRs) (RIG-I and melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5 [MDA5]) as well as endosomal Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)3. However, the adaptor proteins mitochondria-associated antiviral protein
  (MAVS) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-β (TRIF), and the regulatory
  subunit of the IκB kinase complex, NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), are degraded
  by viral proteinases (), disrupting signals extending from RLRs and TLR3 such that
  little or no activated IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)3 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB cells
  reach responsive promoters in the nucleus, and very little or no IFNs are produced.
  (B) In contrast, in HEV-infected cells, HEV RNA is recognized by RIG-I and MDA5,
  and possibly by TLR3 as well. Signaling pathways may be impeded by open reading
  frame (ORF)1 papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) domain antagonism of RIG-I activation
  and X domain inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation, but they are not disrupted and
  substantial amounts of IFNs (predominantly IFN-λ) are produced. Secreted IFNs bind
  to their receptors on the surface of infected cells and induce IFN-stimulated gene
  (ISG) expression via the Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators
  of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion.
  Despite this activation of JAK/STAT signaling, HEV replication persists.
