caption: The de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. It is a  ten-step pathway involving
  the conversion of  phosphoribosylpyrophosphate to inosine monophosphate. All substrates  and
  intermediates in the pathway are labeled. The third step is  catalyzed by the enzyme
  glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GAR  Tfase). This enzyme is monofunctional
  in E. coli, but  exists as part of a trifunctional protein in mammalian cells. The
  three  activities that are condensed are GAR Tfase, GAR synthase, and AIR  synthase.
  The latter enzymes catalyze step 2 and step 5 of purine  biosynthesis. Aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR  Tfase) catalyzes step 9 and exists as a bifunctional,
  condensed with  the tenth activity of the pathway inosine monophosphate (IMP)  cyclohydrolase
  from E. coli to humans. AICAR Tfase uses  the same 10-formyltetrahydrofolate cofactor
  as GAR Tfase.
