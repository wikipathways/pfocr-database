caption: The hAgo2 apo state is characterized by extensive opening and closing motions
  of the Mid-PIWI and PAZ-N terminal lobes. Upon stable anchoring of the guide RNA
  within the Mid and the PAZ domain, the interlobal flexibility of the lobes decreases.
  Binary complexes are conformationally defined, but ternary complexes show a high
  degree of conformational heterogeneity. Stepwise association of the target is accompanied
  by conformational changes in hAgo2 and the guide and target RNA. Dependent on the
  extent of complementarity between guide and target RNA, different conformational
  states are adopted. Some of these states require the release of the 3’-end of the
  guide from the PAZ domain. Target RNAs with extensive complementarity but without
  central matches to the guide RNA adopt a conformation with an efficient exposure
  of the guide 3’-end. This conformational state is potentially coupled to an exit
  of this complex from the regulative cycle to enter the target-directed miRNA degradation
  pathway. Complexes composed of hAgo2 and a fully matched guide-target duplex are
  not found in a single but a variety of conformations including the catalytically
  active form (indicated by the scissor). The nucleic acids within these complexes
  frequently switch in between conformations. In addition, the domains along the axes
  in between the F23 and the Mid or the PAZ domain are mobile suggesting an engulfment
  of the bound RNA substrates. The shaded conformation is only transiently sampled.
  The 5’-end and 3’-end of the guide are anchored in the Mid and PAZ domain, respectively
  (anchoring points are indicated by small circles). Flexibility of hAgo2 domains
  or lobes are indicated by gray arrows.
