caption: Schematic overview of IDO induction by H. ducreyi LOS. Engagement of TLR4
  on the DC surface by H. ducreyi LOS activates MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent
  signaling pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway leads to the activation of MAPK
  (p38, JNK, and ERK) and NF-κB signals. The MyD88-independent pathway is mediated
  by TRIF, which activates IRF3 as well as MAPKs and NF-κB. Signaling through MAPKs
  and NF-κB leads to the expression of TNF-α, whereas activation of IRF3 (, ), MAPKs,
  and NF-κB is required for the expression of IFN-β. Secreted TNF-α and IFN-β bind
  to their cognate receptors, TNF receptor (TNFR) and IFNAR, via autocrine mechanisms
  to activate the MAPK and NF-κB and JAK-STAT signal pathways, respectively. The JAK-STAT
  signaling promotes the formation of the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (a heterotrimer
  of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9). The cooperative activation of these pathways leads to
  transcriptional activation of the INDO gene, which encodes IDO, and the production
  of IDO protein.
