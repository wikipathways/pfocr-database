caption: 'This picture demonstrates different pathways of carbon and lipid metabolism
  such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TAG biosynthesis, transhydrogenase
  cycle, TCA cycle, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid beta oxidation, carotenoid
  and steroid biosynthesis. Substrates have been abbreviated and enzymes have been
  numbered. Abbreviations of substrates, transporters and pathways are provided in
  Additional file : Table S1. List of numbers denoting different enzymes is provide
