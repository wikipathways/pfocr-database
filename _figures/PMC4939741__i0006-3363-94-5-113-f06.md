caption: 'Composite changes in markers of the insulin-signaling pathway and their
  relationship with insulin sensitivity in the liver (left panel), muscle (middle
  panel), and adipose tissue (right panel) in GD90 fetuses. Liver: prenatal T activates
  mTOR and its downstream regulator p70S6K, indicating increased hepatic insulin sensitivity.
  Muscle: decreased p-GSK3β characterizes increased activity of this enzyme, suggesting
  decreased insulin sensitivity in the muscle. Adipose tissue: no detectable changes
  in p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-ERK, p-p70S6K, and p-GSK3β were observed, indicating normal
  insulin sensitivity. The open arrows represent proposed mechanisms for development
  of insulin resistance in each tissue; ↓: decreased expression; ↑: increased expression;
  (–): unaltered expression. Red arrow indicates results from this study; yellow box:
  no change; green box: increased expression; and orange box: decreased expression.'
