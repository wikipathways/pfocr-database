caption: 'An oversimplified schematic of a possible link between mitochondrial (dys)function
  and sex-dependent mental illnesses. MD: stress can interfer with electron transport
  chain (ETC) system and increase reactive oxidative species (ROS), inducing depressive-like
  behaviors. Estrogens (E), sigma1 receptors (Sig-1R), and mitochondrial benzodiazepine
  receptors (MBR) located at voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) can attenuate
  such behavioral deficits, possibly through estrogen receptor β subtype (ERP). Alcohol:
  The level of alcohol correlates with ROS levels due to dysregulation of ETC by increased
  NADH. Yet the role of ROS on facilitating alcohol reward is still unknown. Cocaine:
  Cocaine increases mitochondrial oxidative stress. Further, activation of Sig-1R
  can facilitate reward and potentiate relase behaviors, possibly through increase
  of Rac1. Extinction from cocaine can increase mtDNA. Opioids: Opioids can disrupt
  mitochondrial anti-apoptotic pathway. ROS can impair MOR-dependent signaling cascade.
  MOR antagonism can increase glutamate excitotoxicity. Meth: Meth can induce ROS
  and apoptosis by first depeting DA contents then disinhibiting glutamtergic neurons,
  leading to glutamte excitotoxicity. E can attenuate Meth-induced apoptosis. GAD
  and PTSD: Both GAD and PTSD are associated with dysregulation in ETC system that
  induces ROS. E can alleviate symptoms of GAD and PTSD possibly via ERβ. SZ: More
  mtDNA variants are seen in SZ men than women. Women have a higher prevalence of
  SZ during menopausal period.'
