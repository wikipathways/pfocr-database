caption: The schematic diagram illustrates ATPR‐induced acute myeloid leukaemia cells
  differentiation and cycle arrest by blockade of E2A/c‐Myc/P53 pathway. ATPR induces
  cell differentiation and cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the expression
  of E2A/c‐Myc and activating the P53 pathway
