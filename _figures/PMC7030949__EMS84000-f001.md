caption: 'The key pathways are as summarised. Glycolysis, a series of pathways involved
  in glucose catabolism to pyruvate yielding intermediates for entry into PPP, lactate
  fermentation (‘anaerobic glycolysis’), TCA cycle and lipid synthesis. In oncology,
  the ‘Warburg effect’ (aerobic glycolysis) describes the upregulation of glycolysis
  observed in many cancers even in the presence of oxygen. In ccRCC, upregulation
  of glycolysis correlates with poor prognostic outcomes in patient. Pentose Phosphate
  Pathway (PPP), is a branched pathway from glycolysis, provides reducing equivalents
  (NADPH) and precursors for nucleotide synthesis (building block of DNA/RNA). Upregulation
  of PPP correlates with aggressive ccRCC and poor prognostic outcomes in patient.
  The TCA cycle is a series of reactions that fully oxidise carbohydrates, lipids
  and proteins and generates reducing equivalents (NADH) for the electron transport
  chain to generate ATP. TCA cycle intermediates provides a source of precursors for
  lipids and amino acid biosynthesis. Anaplerosis is the process of replenishing the
  TCA cycle intermediates. Downregulation of TCA cycle genes correlates with aggressive
  ccRCC and poor prognostic outcomes in patients. Lipid Metabolism pathways, lipid
  synthesis is required for energy stores and synthesis of cell membrane components
  whereas lipid degradation (β-oxidation) is required for release of energy stores.
  Upregulation of fatty acid synthesis correlates with aggressive ccRCC and poor prognostic
  outcomes in patients. Glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, glutamine is metabolised
  to α-ketoglutarate for entry into the TCA cycle in a reversed flow of the canonical
  TCA cycle (orange arrows), citrate can be extracted for lipid synthesis. This is
  an essential metabolic pathway that supports the growth of cancer cells with mitochondrial
  defects such as FH-deficient RCC. Oncometabolite production pathways, loss-of-function
  mutations in FH and SDH genes encoding the respective TCA cycle enzymes lead to
  an accumulation of fumarate and succinate. 2HG exists in two isoforms (D2HG/L2HG).
  D2HG is accumulated by gain-of-function neomorphic activity of IDH enzymes. L2HG
  is accumulated by promiscuous activity of MDH/LDH activity. Loss-of-function of
  the enzymes D-/L2HGDH which catalyse the oxidation of D-/L2HG to α-ketoglutarate
  also result in the accumulation of D2HG and L2HG respectively.Abbreviations: αKGDH-
