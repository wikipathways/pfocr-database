caption: 'Phosphorylated glucose enters either the glycogen synthetic pathway or is
  further converted to fructose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. The
  majority of fructose-6-phosphate is channeled to glycolysis. Less than 5% of glucose
  uptake is ultimately channeled to a unique accessory pathway for glucose metabolism,
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This pathway begins with the rate-limiting
  enzyme, L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), followed by
  acetylation of gluocsamine-6-phosphate by glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase
  (Emeg32) to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P). Next are two reversible
  reactions: the conversion of GlcNAc-6-P to GlcNAc-1-P by phosphate-acetylglucosamine
  mutase and then the formation uridine diphosphate-GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) by UDP-GlcNAc
  pyrophosphorylase. This high-energy molecule serves as the monosaccharide donor
  for the post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcase
  (OGA) removes O-GlcNAc modification from proteins.'
