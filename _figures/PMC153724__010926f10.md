  acyl-CoAs serve as substrates in the synthesis of cuticle lipids (). The wax2 mutation
  primarily blocks the synthesis of aldehydes and their metabolites, suggesting that
  WAX2 may function in acyl-CoA reduction. wax2's cuticle membrane disruption and
  the WAX2 protein's homology with hydroxylases suggest that WAX2 also may be required
  for cutin synthesis.
