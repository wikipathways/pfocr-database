caption: 'Intracellular signal propagation of human toll-like receptors and corresponding
  ligands in innate immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and ligands in human are
  revealed in the figure. Individual TLRs recognize specific (pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns, PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of corresponding
  ligands. TLR signaling is propagated by activation of its cytoplasmic TIR (Toll/IL-1R)
  domain and cooperation with various adaptor molecules, such as myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD-88), toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter
  protein (TIRAP), toll interacting protein (TOLLIP), (IRAK), (TRAF), TIR domain-containing
  adapter inducing interferon (IFN)-beta (TRIF), and TRIF-related adapter molecule
  (TRAM). TLR signaling consists of two distinct pathways, MyD-88-dependent and MyD-88-independent:
  (1) MyD-88-dependent pathway: The MyD88 dependent pathway is down-stream of TLR1,
  TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR9. This pathway leads to the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines and is triggered by the association of activated TIR domain and MyD-88,
  recruitment of IRAK1, IRAK4 and TRAF6 to the TLR-MyD-88 complex and consequent phosphorylation
  of IRAK1 and TRAF6. The signal is propagated by this phosphorylated adaptor molecular
  complex to the down-stream MAP kinases-AP1 and IKK complex-NF-κB; (2) MyD88-independent
  pathway: This is associated with the induction of INF-beta mediated by TLR3 or TLR4
  activation. Intracellular signaling via the MyD-88 independent pathway is propagated
  by the action of TRIF and TRAM as adaptor molecules. The signal consequently activates
  the IKK pathway to produce INF-beta.'
