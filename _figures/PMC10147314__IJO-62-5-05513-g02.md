caption: Several signaling pathways are closely related to NEDD8. L11 is modified
  by NEDD8 and remains in the nucleolus; in contrast, unmodified L11 enters the nucleoplasm
  to bind to MDM2, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of p53. IκB, the
  inhibitor of NF-κB, is recognized by NEDD8-modified SCF after phosphorylation, thereby
  degrading it and activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway, PTEN is modified by NEDD8 and moves into the nucleus, promoting the phosphorylation
  of PIP2 and activating downstream pathways. NEDD8, neural precursor cell expressed
  developmentally downregulated 8; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; CSN, constitutive
  photomorphogenesis signalosome; MDM2, murine double minute 2; SCF, Skp1-CUL1-F-box
  protein; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; RBX, ring-box; NEDP1,
  NEDD8 protease 1.
