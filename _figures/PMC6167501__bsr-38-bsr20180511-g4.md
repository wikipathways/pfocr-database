caption: '(A) When there is an absence of Wnt ligand, the cascade is ‘off’ and β-catenin
  is recruited to the APC and axin complex. This allows β-catenin to be phosphorylated
  by CK1α and GSK3β, and then subsequently ubiquitylated by β-TrCP. Following ubiquitylation,
  β-catenin is directed to the proteasome to be degraded. Low levels of cytoplasmic
  β-catenin repress gene transcription of Wnt targets by LEC and TCF. (B) In the canonical
  pathway, Wnt ligands binds to the FRDZ receptor and LPR5/6, which are phosphorylated
  by CK1α and GSK3β. It evokes DVL to interact with p-FRDZ, leading to the inactivation
  of the destruction complex, preventing β-catenin degradation. Stabilized, β-catenin
  translocate into the nucleus and increases gene transcription by forming a complex
  with TCF, LEF and the co-factors PYGO, BCL9, and CBP. In melanoma cells, WNT1 and
  WNT3A are the major ligands responsible for the constant activation of Wnt canonical
  pathway, leading to β-catenin stabilization in the cytosol, which favors melanoma
  progression. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CBP, cAMP response
  element-binding protein; CK1α, casein kinase 1α, DVL, dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; LEF, lymphoid enhanced transcription factor; PYGO, Pygopus;
  TCF, T-cell transcription factor; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein.'
