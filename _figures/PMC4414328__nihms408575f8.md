caption: We propose three possible pathways that could lead to liver NKT cell anergy.
  (A). Repeated α-GalCer stimulation or PGE2 carried by IDEN leads to induction of
  Wnt ligands in the liver. Released Wnt 3a and Wnt 5a subsequently bind to liver
  NKT cells and activate β-catenin mediated TCF/LEF1 activation, which results in
  induction of NKT cell anergy. (B) Up take of IDEN-PGE2 by hepatic DCs results in
  activation of the β-catenin mediated pathway which then prevents the secretion of
  IL-12 induced by TLR stimuli. (c) IDEN-PGE2 could also directly bind to PGE2 receptors
  and subsequently activate the β-catenin mediated pathway by inactivation of GSK-3β.
