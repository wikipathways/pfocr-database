caption: 'Tentative H+ circuit inside respiring inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM).
  Panel A proposes that cardiolipin (CL) can exist in two conformations: ‘closed'',
  with the two hydrophobic domains close together, when the phosphate residues are
  deprotonated (anionic) and their polarity prevails so that they lay close to the
  aqueous milieu; and ‘open'' (about 4.8 nm long) with the two hydrophobic domains
  laying in each of the two leaflets of the IMM, when the phosphate residues are protonated
  and become less polar. Panel B proposes that the H+ (black dotted line) are transferred
  to the Glu 58 (E58) at the center of subunit c through a subunit of ATP synthase
  by proton tunneling. H+ would flow from the periplasmic side, always bound to phospholipid
  heads. This putative pathway would be in line with the existing charged amino acids
  in a subunit. Then, after almost one complete turn, H+ would be acquired by an Arg
  residue and eventually by CL, generating a protonated bis-glycerol phosphate with
  negligible polarity. This can be arranged in each layer of the membrane. H+ would
  be shuttled by CL towards the center of each electron transport chain (ETC) (generic
  respiratory complex, RC in Figure), which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic
  side of the membrane.'
