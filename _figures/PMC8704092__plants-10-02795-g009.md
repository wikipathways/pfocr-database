caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of flowers of C. tinctorius in vascular
  inflammation of HUVEC. The potential role of flowers of C. tinctorius as a beneficial
  therapeutic herb inhibited vascular inflammation via ROS/NF-kB pathway. However,
  modulation of Nrf-2/HO-1/CO signaling axis is involved in its vascular protection
  in vascular endothelial cells.
