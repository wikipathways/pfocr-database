caption: STAT3 molecular pathway. A. STAT3 is localized in cytoplasm in an inactive
  state. B. Upon ligand binding by diverse cytokines such as Interleukin-6, growth
  factors, and lipid metabolites, transmembrane cytokine receptors multimerize, bringing
  receptor-associated JAKs into close physical proximity. This triggers its subsequent
  activation by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 by upstream receptor tyrosine
  kinases (eg. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) and receptor-associated tyrosine
  kinases (eg. Janus Kinase and Src). Following activation, pSTAT3 undergoes dimerization
  and translocates into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. Activated
  STAT3 has been shown to promote cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, and
  tumor metastasis.
