caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐related signaling pathway in osteoclast. ROS
  mediate osteoclast activation is closely related to age‐associated alterations.
  ROS production is indispensable for downstream signaling transduction. However,
  during the aging process, the generation of ROS is robustly increased due to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and a disordered scavenger system, thus resulting in the upregulation
  of osteoclastic gene expression. AP1, activator protein‐1; DOCK, dedicator of cytokinesis;
