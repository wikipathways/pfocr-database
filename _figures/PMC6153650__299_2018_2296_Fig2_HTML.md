caption: Terpene production in plants. a Examples of some medically important terpenes
  produced by plants. The names and class of the products are given in black and red,
  respectively, with the medical applications in blue. b Overview of the two terpene
  biosynthetic pathways in plant cells. Key biochemical intermediates are named in
  black, with important enzymes described in the main text named in red. The various
  classes of end products are named in blue. The MVA pathway is localised to the cytosol
  and associated endomembranes and is responsible for the production of sesquiterpenes
  and triterpenes. The MEP pathway is localised to the plastid and synthesises monoterpenes,
  diterpenes, sesterterpenes and carotenoids (tetraterpenes). CoA Coenzyme A; HMG
