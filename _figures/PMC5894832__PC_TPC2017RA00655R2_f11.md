caption: Proposed Model for the Repression of Seed Maturation Gene Expression in Arabidopsis
  Seedlings.According to this model, HSI2 dimers () may directly target the AGL15
  promoter by binding to RY elements and histone methylation marks through its B3
  and PHD domains, respectively. HSI2 recruits PRC2 by interaction with MSI1 to repress
  AGL15 expression through deposition of H3K27me3 marks. Additional interactions with
  MED13 and HDA6, reported by , are also shown. Since AGL15 positively regulates the
  expression of the LAFL genes that encode the seed maturation transcription factors
  LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2, silencing of AGL15 by HSI2 leads to reduced expression
  of these regulatory genes. In hsi2null plants, on the other hand, AGL15 expression
  remains high and LAFL gene expression is activated, leading to ectopic expression
  of the seed maturation genetic pathway. Solid lines indicate directly upregulated
  targets of AGL15 (). While our results indicate that silencing of AGL15 is a major
  component of LAFL gene repression in seedlings, another potential target(s) of HSI2
  could also play a role in this regulatory mechanism.
