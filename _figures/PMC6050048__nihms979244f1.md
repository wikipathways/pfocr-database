caption: 'In HER2-positive breast cancer, despite effective anti-HER2 regimens with
  mono or dual agents to more completely inhibit all the HER dimers, intrinsic and
  acquired resistance is considerable. The prevalent determinants of response and
  mechanisms of resistance include the following categories: A) Optimized response
  to anti-HER2 therapy requires HER2 oncogenic addiction, which is mostly associated
  with high and homogeneous levels of HER2 gene copy number, and gene and protein
  expression (left). However, sustained activation of HER2 signaling through alterations
  in HER2 such as mutations or protein cleavage may result in resistance to therapy
  (right); B) Activation of alternative survival pathways (e.g., upregulation of ER
  levels and activity); C) Deregulation of the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway, mainly
  due to activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit
  of PI3K or to partial or complete loss of PTEN, leading to PI3K hyperactivation;
  D) Tumor immune microenvironment and immune response.'
