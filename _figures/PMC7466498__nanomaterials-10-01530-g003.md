caption: Schematic representation of the proposed photocatalytic mechanism. The LA
  sites (A) enable the adsorption of benzyl alcohol (B), via a deprotonation pathway.
  Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation leads to the formation of
  hot electrons and holes (C). Hot electrons get trapped at vacancy sites, where they
  activate adsorbed O2 (C,D). Hot holes facilitate the α-H abstraction from the adsorbed
  benzyl alcohol (C,D). The cerium-coordinated superoxide species can abstract hydrogen
  from H-Au species (E), regenerating the catalyst surface. The formed benzaldehyde
  couples with aniline in the next step to generate the imine.
