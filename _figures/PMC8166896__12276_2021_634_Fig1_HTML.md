caption: TNF ligation induces complex I formation, which is composed of TRADD, TRAF2,
  cIAP1/2, RIPK1, TAK1, LUBAC, and the IKK complex, resulting in the activation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. When NF-κB target protein synthesis is inhibited by
  cycloheximide treatment, complex II a, consisting of TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8,
  is activated. Caspase-8, activated as part of complex II a, induces apoptosis through
  the cleavage of downstream molecules. The inhibition of RIPK1 ubiquitination or
  cytotoxicity-induced inhibition of phosphorylation, the early steps of TNF signaling,
  results in the induction of complex II b, which is composed of RIPK1, FADD, and
  caspase-8. Complex II b activation results in the induction of apoptosis through
  activated caspase-8. When caspase-8 is inhibited, RIPK1 and RIPK3 form necrosome
  complexes through homotypic interactions with RHIM, resulting in the activation
  of MLKL through a phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylated MLKL undergoes oligomerization
  and migrates to the plasma membrane where it induces necroptosis by initiating membrane
  rupture or regulating ion flux. Death ligands, including FasL and TRAIL, initiate
  necroptosis by inducing necrosome complex formation. LPS, poly(I:C), double-stranded
  RNA, and viral RNA activate necroptosis by TRIF-mediated necrosome complex formation.
  Viral RNA or cellular endogenous RNA binding to ZBP1 results in RIPK1-independent
  necroptosis through the ZBP1–RIPK3 complex. Necroptosis factors are strictly regulated
  by ubiquitination, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and protein–protein interactions.
