caption: 'Three pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR). (1) inositol requiring
  enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway (left, green), a dual endonuclease and kinase, binds the
  chaperone binding protein (BiP) in its monomeric state. On sensing unfolded/misfolded
  protein IRE1 oligomerizes and auto-trans phosphorylates (red Ps). Activation of
  the endonuclease specifically splices 26 nucleotides out of the XBP1 mRNA, causing
  a frameshift mutation that removes a premature stop codon, thus enabling translation
  of the full length transcription factor. With increased stress, the non-specific
  endonuclease function cleaves endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated mRNAs in a process
  called regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). The IRE1 kinase domain associates
  with other signaling partners that phosphorylate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). ERAD,
  ER-associated degradation. (2) Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway
  (middle, blue): ATF6 release of BiP uncovers a Golgi localization signal (GLS) enabling
  translocation to the Golgi. There it is cleaved by Site-1 and Site-2 proteases (scissors),
  liberating the ATF6 transcription factor. (3) Protein kinase R like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway (right, pink): in the presence of phosphorylated
  protein, PERK also oligomerizes and transphosphorylates, activating its kinase activity.
  PERK in turn phosphorylates eIF2α, resulting in transient global translational inhibition
  apart from a few specific mRNAs such as ATF4. ATF4 promotes transcription of the
  apoptosis-inducing transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Cellular
  processes altered by the UPR pathways and key gene targets that are UPR components
  are in boxes.'
