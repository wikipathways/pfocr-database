caption: ABCA1, a major transporter that regulates HDL biogenesis and cholesterol
  efflux in macrophages accumulated in the artery wall, is regulated by a number of
  miRNAs including miR-33. miR-33 controls numerous steps of the reverse cholesterol
  transport pathway by regulating the expression of numerous genes associated with
  HDL biogenesis (ABCA1), cholesterol efflux in peripheral tissues [ABCA1 and ABCG1
  (only in rodents)] and bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1) and secretion (ABCB11 and ATP8B1).
  In addition to miR-33, ABCA1 is highly regulated at the post-transcriptional level
  in several tissues by numerous miRNAs including miR-33, miR-148a, miR-144, miR-758,
  miR-128a, miR-27a/b, miR-26 and miR-10b. Free cholesterol in nascent HDL is further
  esterified to cholesteryl esters by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)
  leading to the formation of mature HDL particles. HDL particles deliver cholesterol
  to the liver via the SRB1 receptor, which is also regulated by several miRNAs including
  miR-185, miR-223, miR-96.
