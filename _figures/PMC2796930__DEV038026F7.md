caption: Model for FGF-receptor signalling in the generation of hindbrain neural cell
  diversity. FGF-receptor signalling in the hindbrain specifies both SMNs and OLPs
  by promoting olig2 expression, and gliogenesis, by promoting sox9 expression. In
  ventral neural progenitors FGF-receptor signalling cooperates with the Shh pathway
  to control olig2 expression. Olig2 promotes the generation of SMNs by acting in
  combination with proneural factors, such as Ngn1. Subsequently, FGF-receptor signalling
  controls gliogenesis by promoting sox9 expression in neural progenitors throughout
  the DV axis. In Olig2 expressing progenitors, this results in oligogenesis, and
  in dorsal progenitors, in the genesis of GS-positive astroglia. Other signals including
  Notch, BMP and cytokine, are likely to participate in the latter.
