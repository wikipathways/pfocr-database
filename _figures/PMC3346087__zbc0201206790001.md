caption: Structure and biosynthesis of petrobactin, the virulence-associated siderophore
  of Bacillus anthracis. A, petrobactin is a symmetrical, mixed catechol-hydroxy-carboxylate
  siderophore comprised of a central citric acid moiety, two spermidine arms, and
  two 3,4-DHBA moieties. The unique 3,4-position of the hydroxyl groups in the catechol
  confers the stealth characteristics of petrobactin during host infection. B, the
  asbABCDEF gene cluster, shown with B. anthracis strain Ames labels, encodes the
  enzymatic machinery required for biosynthesis of petrobactin. Products include NIS
  synthetases (gray), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like aryl transferase system
  (white), and a 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase/3,4-DHBA synthase (black). C, shown
  is the proposed pathway for petrobactin biosynthesis. Left panel, AsbF converts
  3-dehydroshikimate to 3,4-DHBA, which is in turn adenylated by AsbC and loaded onto
  the phosphopantetheine thiol of the aryl-carrier protein AsbD. In vitro, AsbE transfers
  the 3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl group from AsbD to the primary amino groups of spermidine.
  Right panel, through regioselective condensation of spermidine with citric acid,
  AsbA and AsbB form intermediates that subsequently react with 3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl
  units. The flexibility of AsbB in vitro suggests multiple possible routes for the
  biosynthesis of petrobactin.
