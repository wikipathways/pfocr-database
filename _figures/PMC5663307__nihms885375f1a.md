caption: 'Neisseria meningitidis can adhere to and form colonies on the vascular endothelium
  via pilin. Meningococcal virulence factor such as factor H binding protein can down
  regulate complement response and allow bacterial proliferation. Bacterial-endothelial
  interactions result in endothelial inflammation via NFkB responses and can further
  promote endothelial infection, capillary leakage and translocation of bacteria across
  the vessel–. Invasive meningococcal disease is associated with decreased activity
  of the metalloproteinase ADAMST13 and increased activity of von Willebrand factor
  (vWF) , . Ultra-large vWF (UL vWF) multimers contribute to platelet (PLT) aggregation
  and intravascular thrombosis,. Endothelial inflammation contributes to platelet
  dysfunction via N. meningitidis-derived nitric oxide with impaired vascular homeostasis
  and NO mediated impairment ADP-mediated platelet aggregation. Inflammatory cytokines
  change the coagulation profile towards pro-coagulation with a reduction of activated
  protein C (APC) and anti-thrombin III (ATIII) and upregulation of prothrombin and
  the anti-fibrinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The end result
  of the interaction of multiple ‘inflammatory’ pathways in the organ is micro-thrombosis,
  tissue ischemia, oxidative insult, ischemia and cell death. Plasm exchange therapy
  can reverse this process. B. Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndromes. Sterile microangiopathies
  such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) are associated with inhibition
  of ADAMST13 activity via the presence of auto-inhibitors, whereas atypical HUS or
  “congenital TTP” has been associated with ADAMST13 and inhibitory complement gene
  mutations,. Upon infection with Shiga toxin (ST)-producing pathogens, ST has direct
  effects on the vascular endothelium and results in increased release of ultra-large
  vWF multimers and to directly inhibit ADAMST13 activity level, further promoting
  thrombosis formation–. ST mediated aHUS causes a pro-inflammatory endothelial state
  by promoting leukocyte adhesion and by producing endothelial derived cytokines such
  as IL-8, similar to the vascular pathophysiology observed in purpura fulminans.
  Exposure of human endothelial cells to the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-al and
  IL-1b increase expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on endothelial cells and
  result in further susceptibility to ST by a feed-forward mechanism75. Shiga-toxin
  causes production of Complement 3a (C3a), with loss of thombomodulin (TM), changes
  in cell surface adhesion molecules and a propensity toward clot production, –. In
  aHUS, mutations in the alternative complement regulatory pathway, especially mutations
  in the complement factor H, impair control of Complement 3b (C3b) on the cell surface
  by inability to recognize sialic acid and helps to explain the thrombogenic potential
  in these patients, . Mutations have recently been described in multiple complement
  regulatory genes in adult patients with aHUS, with 12% of patients having compound
  mutations. In addition to plasma exchange therapy, the anti-C5a monoclonal antibody
  eculizumab is FDA approved for this process.Abbreviations: Thombocytopenia Associated
