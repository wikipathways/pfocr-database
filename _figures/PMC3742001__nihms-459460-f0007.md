caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the signaling pathways relevant to this study.
  Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) results in the recruitment of the
  adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS), which results in the activation
  of PI3K-AKT- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK (extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase) pathways. Serine phosphorylation of IRS on the 636/639
  and 789 residues is associated with reduced signaling from IRS, whereas Y895 phosphorylation
  is associated with enhanced signaling. Blockade of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) with
  rapamycin results in the inhibition of S6K, which leads to reduced IRS S636/639
  phosphorylation, enhanced phosphorylation of IRS Y895 residue, and the recruitment
  of the adaptor protein Grb2, resulting in the activation of the ERK pathway. Activated
  ERK1 associates and phosphorylates Nav1.7, leading to hyperexcitability of sensory
  neurons. Activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in
  response to metformin treatment, leads to enhanced IRS S789 phosphorylation (which
  is an inhibitory phospho site) and reduced phosphorylation of IRS Y895 (which is
  a phospho site associated with enhanced IRS activity) residue, which suppresses
  the recruitment of Grb2, thus reversing rapamycin-induced activation of the ERK
  pathway.
