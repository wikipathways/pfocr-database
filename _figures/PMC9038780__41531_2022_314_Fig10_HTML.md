caption: a The schematic depicts the MGO-altered glutamatergic proteins in the midbrain
  of Thy1-aSyn mice. In contrast to control, vehicle-injected mice (left), MGO-injected
  mice (right) display signs of altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling.
  Proteomics data suggest a probable increase of glutamate production (glutaminase)
  and packaging in glutamatergic vesicles (VGLUT), the release of glutamate to the
  synaptic cleft and astrocytic reuptake (EAAT1) or entry to the postsynaptic neuron
  via AMPA or NMDA receptors. The increase in these receptors may occur at the synapse
  or extrasynaptically, inducing excessive calcium entry to the cell. An increase
  of both CAMK2A and CAMK2B is also observed, supporting the hypothesis of enhanced
  glutamatergic signaling. A strong imbalance in the postsynaptic levels of calcium
  can occur and contribute to excitotoxicity. b Proteomics data also suggest alterations
  in several components of the electron transport chain in the oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. Are detected upon aSyn overexpression (Veh-Thy1-aSyn vs Veh-WT mice), after
  MGO injection (Veh-WT vs MGO-WT) or in MGO-injected Thy1-aSyn (vs Veh-Thy1-aSyn),
  suggesting that MGO and aSyn trigger the dysfunction of this common pathway. In
  fact, some of these targets are glycated in MGO-injected Thy1-aSyn mice. c The glycated
  proteome also impacts on proteostasis components such as the proteasome, autophagy-lysosome
  pathway, and heat-shock proteins response. d MGO further increases aSyn S129 phosphorylation
  and aSyn insolubility, typical hallmarks of aSyn pathology.
