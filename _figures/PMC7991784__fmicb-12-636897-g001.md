caption: HBV-induced lipid metabolism changes in hepatocytes. HBV infection, replication,
  and expression in hepatocytes can change hepatic lipid metabolic pathways in many
  aspects. In HBV-transfected cell lines, HBV-transgenic mice or liver specimens from
  CHB patients, transcriptional factors (TF), and genes related to hepatic lipogenesis
  have changed much. Enhanced activation of LXR and SREBP1c increased downstream lipogenesis
  genes, including FAS, ACC, SCD, et al., and promoted free fatty acid (FFA) biosynthesis
  and lipogenesis (; ; ; ; ; ; ). On the other hand, activation of LXR, C/EBP, PPARα
  and PPARγ can also increase FFA oxidation through adinonectin, or other ways (;
  ). Simultaneously, phosphatidylcholine synthesis was enhanced too (). The key TF
  SREBP2 and enzyme HMGCR in the cholesterol synthesis pathway were stimulated by
  HBV replication or HBx protein, inducing increased cholesterol uptake and synthesis
  in hepatocytes (; ). The interaction between HBV and NTCP facilitated CYP7A1 expression
  and bile acid biosynthesis (; ; ). Moreover, HBV replication decreased the expression
  of several types of apolipoprotein (Apo), including ApoA1 (; ; ), ApoA5 (), ApoB100
  (), or ApoC3 (), and repressed synthesis of HDL, LDL, VLDL in hepatocytes (). While
  expression of ApoE () or ApoM () increased after HBV infection. Changes in hepatic
  lipid metabolism induced changed lipid levels in peripheral blood, including increased
  SFA and MUFA (), decreased ApoA1, ApoA5, ApoB100, or ApoC3 (; ; ; , ; ), or increased
  ApoE or ApoM (; ). However, the level of TG and TC showed a decrease in CHB patients
  compared to normal controls (; ; ). The expression of genes in the red circle was
  increased, while that in the green circle was decreased. (ACBP, acetyl-CoA binding
