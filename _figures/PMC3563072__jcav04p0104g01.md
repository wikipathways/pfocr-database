caption: Schematic representation of the innate IFN-RNase L pathway as influenced
  by viral infection. Viral infection triggers the release of Type I interferons,
  which act on the infected cell in an autocrine fashion. IFN signaling initiated
  the Oligoadenylate Synthase (OAS)/RNase L pathway for nucleic acid degradation (Adapted
  from Silverman 2007) [50].
