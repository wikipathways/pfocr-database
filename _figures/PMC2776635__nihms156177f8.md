caption: A schematic representation of the p66Shc pathway in androgen action on prostate
  cancer cell proliferation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-bound androgen receptor (AR)
  complex can activate two independent pathways—AR-dependent gene expression, such
  as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and AR-dependent cell proliferation, involving
  the p66Shc–reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway. Stimulation of androgenic proliferation
  includes an increase in p66Shc protein level after DHT treatment. Increased p66Shc
  translocates into mitochondria, where it interacts with cytochrome c (Cyt c), localized
  in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and generates ROS production. Increased ROS
  production promotes cell cycle progression, through Cyclin D1 and, which in turn,
  increases cell proliferation. In addition to the activation of p66Shc–ROS pathway,
  a part of the cell growth is also mediated by the genomic effects of the AR-dependent
  pathway (Dotted arrow).
