caption: Synthesis of murine bile acids in mice. 7-Keto-LCA is an intermediate between
  CDCA and UDCA produced by bacteria with 7α/β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (7α/βHSDs).
  7-Keto-LCA can be converted to CDCA or UDCA by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase1
  (11βHSD1) in the liver. Our in vitro experiments showed that αMCA and βMCA can be
  synthesized from CDCA and UDCA, respectively. Further experiments are required to
  investigate if UDCA can be produced by an alternative pathway and if epimerization
  between αMCA and βMCA can occur in the liver and/or in the intestine by the gut
  microbiota.
