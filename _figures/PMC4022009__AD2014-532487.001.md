caption: 'Potential mechanisms of action of autoantibodies in AMD. Classical activation
  of complement pathway by autoantibodies produced by autoreactive plasmocytes could
  destroy directly RPE. In addition, autoantibodies could recruit, activate, and induce
  RPE phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils in a complement dependent or independent
  manner. Moreover, autoantibodies could induce choroidal vessels involution by inhibiting
  vessel growth or in contrary enhancing choroidal neovascularization by inducing
  proangiogenic factors production by macrophages and neutrophils. VEGF: vascular
  endothelial growth factor; RPE: retinal pigmented epithelium; location of the neural
  retina is mentioned but not represented.'
