caption: Model of FLT3-ITD signaling on intracellular compartments in AML cells. (Left)
  FLT3-wt normally moves to the PM along the secretory pathway for binding its ligand.
  Upon stimulation with FLT3 ligand at the cell surface, the wild-type receptor activates
  downstream molecules. (Right) FLT3-ITD is retained in the Golgi apparatus in AML
  cells. The mutant can activate kinases, such as AKT and ERK, in the perinuclear
  Golgi region, but not in the ER before reaching the PM. On the other hand, FLT3-ITD
  activates STAT5 in the ER, where it is newly synthesized.
