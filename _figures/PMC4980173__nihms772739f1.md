caption: 'Schematic presentation of the molecular and blood pressure responses elicited
  by peripheral NMDAR activation. This model is based on our reported findings in
  male conscious Sprague-Dawley rats.,, The peripheral NMDAR can be activated by its
  ligands, glutamate or NMDA. NMDAR blockade with antagonists, AP-5 or ethanol attenuates
  peripheral NMDAR-mediated cardiovascular responses. Following activation, Ca2+ influx
  occurs and multiple signaling cascades are triggered: 1) PI3K-Akt signaling, 2)
  NOX activation and 3) PKC activation. PI3K-Akt signaling increased nNOS phosphorylation
  leading to NO generation, which in turn contributes to ROS generation within the
  vasculature and vasoconstriction. This signaling is inhibited at multiple points
  within the pathway by either PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin or nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS) inhibitors, N (ω)-propyl-L-arginine (NPLA) or N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl
  ester (L-NAME). Peripheral NMDAR activation also activates NOX leading to ROS generation
  and vasoconstriction; nonspecific NOX inhibitor, apocynin attenuates these responses.
  Activation of PKC mediates the phosphorylation of NOS leading to NO generation,
  which contribute to downstream ROS generation and vasoconstriction. Inhibition of
  PKC with chelerythrine reduces vascular NO and ROS generation and NOX activation
  as well as the pressor response elicited by peripheral NMDAR activation.'
