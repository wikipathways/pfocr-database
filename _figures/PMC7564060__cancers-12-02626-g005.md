caption: Effect of radiation therapy (RT) on MDSCs. Treatment with conventional fractionated
  radiotherapy (CFRT) promotes the secretion of tumor cytokines and chemokines in
  response to activation of the STING signaling pathway and DNA damage. These secreted
  factors bind to the receptors on the membrane of MDSCs, which increases the number
  of MDSCs migrating to the TME, upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on MDSCs, and
  strengthens the ability to suppress T cells. Ablative hypofractionated radiotherapy
  (ABHRT) reduces the recruitment of MDSCs by destroying the hypoxic environment in
  the TME and induces tumor apoptosis, leading to reactivation of the antitumor response.
  CCL, CC chemokine ligand; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor.
