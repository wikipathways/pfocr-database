caption: Transcriptomic and metabolomic pathways of flavonoids synthesis enhanced
  by Fe7(PO4)6 NMs in tomato fruits. (a) sucrose metabolism; (b) shikimic acid pathway;
  (c) phenylalanine synthesis pathway; (d) flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The data
  of transcriptomics and metabolomics were normalized before comparison in heatmaps.
  The color scheme represents decrease or increase of value of log2(fold change) and
  the fold change indicated the FPKM ratio of DEG and response value ratio of DEM
  in 50 mg kg−1 NMs to control. At transcriptional level, blue represents downregulation
  and yellow means upregulation; at metabolic level, blue represents downregulation
  and red means upregulation. Upper squares represent samples of CK and lower ones
  represent samples of NMs.
