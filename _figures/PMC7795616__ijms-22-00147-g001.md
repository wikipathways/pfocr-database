caption: Endoglin signaling. When TGF-β binds to its type-II receptor in the absence
  of endoglin, the type-I receptor ALK-5 is recruited and transphosphorylated. This
  subsequently leads to phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which then forms a complex with
  Smad4, translocates to the nucleus and regulates target genes involved in vessel
  maturation. The presence of endoglin on the cell membrane inhibits this signaling
  pathway (left panel). In the presence of endoglin, binding of BMP-9 or TGF-β to
  the type-II receptor results in recruitment and transphosphorylation of ALK-1, which
  phosphorylates Smad1/5/8, resulting in regulation of angiogenic target genes (right
  panel). Endoglin can be cleaved from the cell membrane by MMP-14, creating a soluble
  form of the receptor which may function as a ligand trap.
