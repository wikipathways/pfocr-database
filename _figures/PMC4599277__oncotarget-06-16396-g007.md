caption: Leptin treatment induces phosphorylation of Stat3 leading to increased recruitment
  of Stat3 to miR34a resulting in repression of miR34a. Inhibition of miR34a allows
  increased levels of Wnt1 expression in the presence of leptin. Leptin treatment
  results in stabilization and nuclear localization of βcatenin increasing activation
  of Wnt/βcatenin responsive genes. Honokiol treatment inhibits leptin-induced phosphorylation
  of Stat3, releases Stat3 from the conserved Stat3-binding site located in the first
  intron of miR-34a hence releasing the repressive effects of Stat3 and increasing
  miR34a expression. miR34a represses Wnt1 expression. Honokiol treatment results
  in abrogation of Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway even in the presence of leptin.
