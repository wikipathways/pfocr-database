caption: A heat stresses responsive regulatory network in maize. Heat stress damages
  the cell membrane when exposed to heat stress and promotes the release of apoplastic
  Ca2+. Heat stress disturbs the plasma membrane’s fluidity and permeability, resulting
  in a loss in function of chloroplasts and mitochondria, higher cytosolic Ca2+, ROS,
  NO, and over-accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins. Increased cytosolic
  Ca2+, ROS, and NO are secondary messengers and stimulate downstream regulatory networks.
  Heat stress disrupts protein homeostasis, inducing unfolded-protein response (UPR)
  and signaling pathways mediated by IRE1-ZmZIP60 and ZmZIP28. The ZmZIP60 activates
  the expression of a type-A HSF and HSFTF13, which upregulates the expression of
  HSP genes, i.e., Hsp90. The Ca2+signaling is essential in heat tolerance of seed-set
  in maize under field conditions, where calcium, a critical secondary messenger,
  converges signals transmitted from high temperature, membrane fluidity, calcium
  efflux, and ABA (among others), amplifying them through the activation downstream
  of genes, such as HSFA6b, ABF1, CYCD5;1, MutS2, and HSPs during reproductive stage
  via the MAPK pathway, and eventually enhance maize tolerance to heat stress for
  seed-set. This figure was made using BioRender.
