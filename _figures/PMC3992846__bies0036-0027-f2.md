caption: 'Production of biosynthetic precursors during glycolytic metabolism and their
  putative regulation during Xenopus tail appendage regeneration. A: Pathways demonstrating
  how glucose or its derivatives can contribute to biosynthetic processes as well
  as how glucose metabolism may be regulated during appendage regeneration as outlined
  in the essay. Diagram adapted from ,,. Colors indicate conceptually different pathways
  or interactions: glycolysis toward glucose combustion (black); pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP, shown in red); molecular contributions of biosynthetic pathways (blue);
  NAD/H, NADP/H, ATD/P reactions shown in green; reintroduction of PPP products into
  glycolysis (gray); putative inhibitory mechanisms during Xenopus tadpole tail regeneration
  (yellow); putative activation mechanisms during Xenopus tadpole tail regeneration
  (purple); putative activity of PI3/Akt given its previously characterized interactions
  with leptin/insulin/RTK activity ,. Asterisk (*) indicates that the PK inhibition
  by ROS and tyrosine kinase activity have been reported for the PKM2 version of the
  PK enzyme ,. Acronyms are as follows: HK, hexokinase; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; 6PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; 6PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  PPEI, phosphopentoseisomerase; PPE, phosphopentose epimerase; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  TK, transketolase; TA, transaldolase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; ALDO, aldolase;
  TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK,
  phosphoglycerate kinase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase; ENO, enolase; PK, pyruvate
  kinase. B: In situ hybridization showing expression of g6pd following amputation
  and during the regeneration of Xenopus tropicalis tadpole tails. Solid red arrow
  shows a portion of the notochord that has exited the wound site. Open red arrow
  shows regenerative bud tissue. C: Transillumination (trans) and HyperYFP ([H2O2])
  images showing the detection of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) following Xenopus laevis tail amputation using the H2O2 sensitive HyPerYFP
  probe ,. Relative levels of H2O2 levels shown in the scale found to the right of
  the images. Solid red arrow shows a portion of the notochord that has exited the
  wound site.'
