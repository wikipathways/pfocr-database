caption: 'PI3K/AKT and RAS/EGFR/ERK pathways. Class IA PI3K are heterodimers consisting
  of a p85α regulatory subunit and a p110α catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA).
  The p85α regulatory subunit normally stabilizes p110α and inhibits its catalytic
  activity. Activation of the PI3K pathway via ligand binding to transmembrane RTKs
  such as EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3, results in phosphorylation of p85α and activation
  of the p110α catalytic subunit. Once activated, PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 at the
  plasma membrane to produce the lipid second messenger, PIP3. This step is inhibited
  by PTEN, which dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2. PIP3 binds to PDK1 which phosphorylates
  and activates AKT. Activated AKT phosphorylates TSC1/2, leading to mTOR activation
  and increased protein synthesis and cell growth. AKT increases cell proliferation
  by phosphorylating GSK3 which normally regulates the degradation of cyclin D. In
  addition, activation of AKT promotes cell survival by inhibiting proapoptotic factors
  such as BAD and FOXO transcription factors, and by phosphorylating MDM2 which antagonizes
  p53-mediated apoptosis. Other PI3K activation pathways depend on adaptor proteins
  such as GRB2, which binds to and activates SOS, stimulating RAS and independent
  activation of p110α. A Ras-binding domain in p110α also mediates activation by RAS.
  RAS-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane activates RAF, which in turn activates
  MEK and ERK, respectively. ERK phosphorylates several proteins that control cell
  proliferation and cell cycle progression. Somatic mutation frequencies in cervical
  squamous cell carcinomas are shown next to each gene []. Abbreviations: RTKs, receptor
