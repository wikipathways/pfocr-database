caption: CD8+ T cell memory and effector differentiation are tightly regulated by
  opposite signals received from inflammatory cytokines and developmental modulators.
  CD8+ T cell memory is promoted by binding of WNT ligands to Frizzled/Low-density
  lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) 5/6 complexes and by interleukin-21 (IL-21)
  or other cytokines signaling through signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3). Activation of these signaling pathways result in the expression of transcriptional
  regulators and molecules that favor self-renewal and memory formation, including
  STAT3, Eomesodermin (EOMES), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6), Kruppel-like factor 2
  (KLF2) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). At the same time, these signaling
  pathways inhibit the expression of transcription regulators that promote CD8+ T
  cell effector differentiation and senescence, such as T-BET (encoded by T-box 21
  (TBX21)), B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1(BLIMP1, encoded by PR domain
  containing 1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1)) and inhibitor of DNA-binding 2 (ID2). Conversely,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-12 drive CD8+ T cell differentiation
  by triggering STAT4 and STAT5 signaling as well as the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the RAS/RAF/ mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These signaling pathways induce the expression of
  the pro-effector molecules T-BET, BLIMP1 and ID2, as well as the inhibition of pro-memory
  transcription modulators such as forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), BCL6 and ID3. Between
  these self-renewal and pro-differentiation pathways there is a considerable amount
  of cross-talk such that the net effect of each pathways is precisely balanced. APC,
