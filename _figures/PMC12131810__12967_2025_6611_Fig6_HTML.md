caption: Role played by glial cells in axonal regeneration. (A and C) Following SCI,
  neuronal damage signals prompt the release of damaged mitochondria from neurons.
  Subsequently, astrocytes phagocytose these damaged mitochondria, leading to increased
  expression levels of Rho-GTPase1 and TFAM within mitochondria. This activation triggers
  the Rho-related signaling pathway, facilitating mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes
  to neurons. (B) Injury-induced signaling activates the GJA1-20 K/CX43 signaling
  pathway in astrocytes, enabling mitochondria to mitigate oxidative stress and facilitating
  their transfer to neurons to sustain energy supply capacity. (D) Activation of the
  RAB7-related signaling pathway in astrocytes promotes astrocytic proliferation and
  facilitates association with peripheral astrocytes to provide ATP to neurons, thus
  fostering axonal regeneration
