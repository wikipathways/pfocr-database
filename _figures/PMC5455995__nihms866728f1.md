caption: 'RAS pathway is prognostic in breast cancer. (A) A schematic illustration
  of the EGFR/HER2/RAS signalling pathway is shown. The two upstream receptors, EGFR/HER2,
  the midstream kinases, phospho-ERK, and the most downstream signalling gatekeeper,
  SIAH E3 ligase, were highlighted. (B) SIAH and/or EGFR expression can be used to
  monitor tumour responses and identify resistant tumour clones post-NST and strategy
  patients. The therapy-induced changes in SIAH and EGFR expression, are highly prognostic
  in identifying effective/ineffective therapies, differentiating partial responders,
  identifying resistant tumour clones and predicting remission/relapse in breast cancer
  patients with lymph node metastases at first line therapy. EGFR, epidermal growth
  factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activate protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activate protein
  kinase kinase; NST, neoadjuvant systemic therapy; RAF, rapidly accelerated fi brosarcoma;
  SIAH, seven in absentia homologue. (Adapted from van Reesema et al. SIAH and EGFR,
  two RAS pathway biomarkers, are highly prognostic in locally advanced and metastatic
  breast cancer. EBioMedicine 2016; 11: 183–198 []).'
