caption: 'The regulatory network of the DEGs is identified by co-expression, GO and
  pathway analysis. Each node corresponds to a gene, and a pair of nodes is connected
  with an edge if there is a significant co-expression relationship between them.
  Red: up-regulated genes; Green: down-regulated genes'
