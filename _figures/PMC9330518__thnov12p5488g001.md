caption: 'Schematic illustration of the NAcp@CD47 nanocapsule for dual delivery of
  anti-CD47 antibodies and STING agonists for GBM immunotherapy by repolarization
  of macrophages and promotion of phagocytosis. (A) The process of constructing the
  FAPá responsive prodrug nanocapsule: anti-CD47 antibodies and CDG are co-encapsulated
  in NAcp@CD47 using MPC, APM and FAP-α-responsive peptide crosslinker in situ polymerization
  nanocapsule. (B) The mechanism of NAcp@CD47 polarization of microglia and macrophages
  against GBM. After intravenous injection, NAcp@CD47 can be delivered to the CNS
  crossing the BBB mediated by MPC, release anti-CD47 antibodies and CDG after FAP-α
  enzymatic degradation in the GBM microenvironment to block the phagocytosis checkpoint
  CD47-SIRPα and promote the production of IFNs via the STING signaling pathway. Consequently,
  the reprogrammed microglia (or macrophages) enhances the phagocytosis of cancer
  cells. Similarly, IFNs facilitate increased infiltration of immune cells and increase
  immunogenicity to convert “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors.'
