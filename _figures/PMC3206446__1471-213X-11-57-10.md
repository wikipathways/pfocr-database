caption: Model for how the loss of scrib affects Hippo pathway signaling. In an epithelial
  cell, the core Hippo pathway components Hpo (H), Wts (W), Sav (S) and Mats (M) inhibit
  the activity of Yki, which acts to regulate transcription through its DNA binding
  partner, Sd. Extracellular regulation of the pathway occurs through the two transmembrane
  proteins, Crb acting through Ex, and Ft, acting through both Ex and D. Ex can also
  directly bind to and inhibit Yki. Loss of scrib in the eye disc is associated with
  aPKC-dependent inhibition of the Hippo pathway. Although JNK signaling is activated
  by either the loss of scrib, or ectopic aPKC activity, JNK is not required for Hippo
  pathway inhibition. In the wing disc, loss of scrib is also associated with JNK
  activation, and although JNK signaling has been shown to be sufficient to downregulate
  the Hippo pathway in the wing disc [], Hippo pathway signaling remains impaired
  in scrib mutants even when JNK is blocked. Epistasis experiments suggest that pathway
  inhibition in scrib mutants occurs, at least in part, downstream or in parallel
  to Ex and Ft, and could impact upon either the core components (H/S/M/W) or upon
  Yki activity itself.
