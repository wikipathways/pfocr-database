caption: cGAS-STING pathway and metabolic reprogramming. Metabolic reprogramming in
  macrophages is centered on two TCA cycle breakpoints, namely the cis-aconitate withdrawal
  point when succinate ACDO1 activity is elevated and IDH is blocked, enabling the
  conversion of cis-aconitate into itaconic acid. The antimicrobial properties of
  itaconic acid and its role as a pro-inflammatory mediator are well-established.
  It can also inhibit STING activation via Nrf2. Additionally, itaconic acid acts
  as an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, preventing the conversion of succinate
  into fumarate. This hinders glycolysis as the primary energy metabolism of M1 via
  HIF-α, which is less efficient than OXPHOS in M2. STING-IFN activation in M2 leads
  to its reprogramming to M1, but this process can be inhibited by PDK2/4 deficiency,
  which also rescues obesity-associated insulin resistance. LPS Lipopolysaccharide,
