caption: mtDNA released into cytoplasm in acute tissue injury induced by trauma and
  triggered the activation of cGAS-STING and TLR9-MyD88. Stress signaling was transferred
  into the nucleus through activated cGAS-STING and TLR9-MyD88 pathways, which mediate
  the activation of the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling and the formation of neutrophil
  extracellular trap.
