caption: 'Bacterial components that affect innate and adaptive immunity in the intestine.
  Bacterial MAMPS signal through host PRRs. PSA (A) from Bacteroides fragilis interacts
  with TLR2 on plasmacytoid pDCs to induce IL‐10 production from CD4+ T cells and
  Treg clonal expansion. Lactobacillus plantarum  d‐alanylated teichoic acid (D) also
  signals through TLR2 on DCs to modulate effector and regulatory T‐cell populations.
  Flagellin activation of TLR5 on epithelial cells alters microbiota composition.
  Luminal bacteria promote mucus secretion and movement of monocytes closer to epithelial
  stem cells through a MyD88‐dependent signalling pathway. Sphingolipid metabolites
  from B. fragilis promote iNKT activation in adults. SCFA metabolites from bacteria
  impact immunity through multiple mechanisms: activation of GPRs, inhibition of HDACs,
  and regulation of autophagy. Butyrate exerts anti‐inflammatory effects on macrophages
  through HDAC inhibition and promotes barrier function in IECs through stabilization
  of HIF. Lactobacilli produce an AhR ligand, indole‐3‐aldehyde, which induces IL‐22,
  promoting AMP expression and mucosal homeostasis. AhR signalling on ILC3s also inhibits
  Th17 cell expansion. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AMPs, antimicrobial peptides;
  GPRs, G protein‐coupled receptors; HIF, hypoxia‐inducible factor; I, indole‐3‐aldehyde,
  an AhR ligand; IECs, intestinal epithelial cells, ILC3, group 3 innate lymphoid
  cell; MAMPS, microbe‐associated molecular patterns; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein 88; PRRs, pattern recognition receptors; pDCs, plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells; PSA, polysaccharide A from Bacteroides fragilis; SCFAs, short‐chain
  fatty acids; TLRs, Toll‐like receptors.'
