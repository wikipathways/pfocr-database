caption: Interactions of COPD and OSAS in inflammatory mechanisms that predispose
  to cardiovascular disease. Both COPD and OSAS are associated with elevated levels
  of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in addition to tumour necrosis
  factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), and are also associated with oxidative
  stress. However, cigarette smoking and obesity are confounding variables in these
  associations. Hypoxia is a key factor in elevated TNF-α production in OSAS, which
  is particularly relevant to the overlap syndrome. Each inflammatory pathway has
  been associated with atherogenesis and subsequent cardiovascular disease. COPD,
  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; OSAS, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
