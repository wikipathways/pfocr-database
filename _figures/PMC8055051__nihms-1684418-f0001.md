caption: Each KEGG pathway is converted into a gene interaction network where only
  the genes in the pathway are represented, and all direct and indirect interactions
  among the genes are preserved. For each network, four DAGs (using four alternative
  cycle removal methods depth-first search (DFS), minimum feedback arc set (MFAS),
  PageRank (PR), and ensemble (EN)) and 1,000 random DAGs for each of the four DAGs
  are generated. The random DAGs follow the node and edge statistics of their corresponding
  DAG. For each gene interaction network, synthetic gene expression data is generated
  using SynTRen and the fitness of the four DAGs (and the corresponding 4×1,000 =
  4,000 random DAGs) is assessed using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) scoring.
