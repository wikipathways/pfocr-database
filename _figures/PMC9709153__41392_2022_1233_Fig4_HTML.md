caption: MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPKs signaling can be activated by exercise-induced
  mechanical stress and a range of growth factors, including NRG1, TGF-β and BMP,
  thus playing an important role in exercise-induced tissue regeneration. MAPK/ERK
  signaling activates YAP translocation into nucleus, promoting cardiomyogenesis.
  The activation of ERK also promotes neurogenesis and cycling of satellite cells.
  The restoration of cyclin D1 inhibits TGF-β/Smad signaling. The p38 MAPK and JNK
  can activate the transcription factors that initiate the expression of osteogenetic
  and myogenetic genes, including Myod, MRF, and Myogenin, promoting osteogenesis
  and myogenesis. Created with BioRender
