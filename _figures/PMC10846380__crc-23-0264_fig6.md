caption: CK1α degradation by FPFT-2216 and subsequent p53 pathway activation and CBM
  complex/NFκB pathway inhibition. FPFT-2216 enhances CK1α degradation in lymphoid
  tumor cell lines, resulting in antiproliferative activity via the following two
  pathways. (1) In the case of p53 wild-type, CK1α degradation activates p53/p21,
  resulting in cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition. In addition, the binding of
  MDM2, whose expression is increased by p53, to p53 is suppressed in the presence
  of an MDM2 inhibitor, further enhancing p53 activation. This is presumed to be the
  combined action mechanism of FPFT-2216 and an MDM2 inhibitor. (2) CK1α degradation
  attenuates CBM complex activities, such as MALT1 caspase activity, and suppresses
  downstream NFκB pathway activation
