caption: Several cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, activate the NF-κB signaling
  pathway by phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, leading to its ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation. Activated NF-κB members translocate into the nucleus and induce transcription
  of inflammatory genes, including Nlrp3, Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-18. Ghrelin suppresses
  the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation, resulting in anti-inflammatory
  activity. Ghrelin also inhibits the microglial production of cytokines such as TNF-α,
  IL-1β, and IL-6. Anamorelin appears to suppress inflammation in a GHSR-dependent
  manner
