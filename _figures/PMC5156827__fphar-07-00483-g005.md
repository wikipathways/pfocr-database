caption: 'Schematic diagram of the disturbed metabolic pathway related to LPS/EA treatment.
  The notations are as follows: (↑) in red, metabolite higher in LPS/EA treated group
  than in LPS/CH and LPS/RE groups; (↓) in green, metabolite lower in LPS/EA treated
  group than in PS/CH and LPS/RE groups. The related metabolic pathways are cycled
  in a black box; ALT, glutamate pyruvate transaminase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase.'
