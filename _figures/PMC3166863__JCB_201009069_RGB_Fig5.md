caption: NPHP4 antagonizes the Hippo pathway. Active Hippo signaling leads to phosphorylation
  (P) and activation of the large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinase, which in turn phosphorylates
  YAP at Ser-127 and TAZ at Ser-89. This creates phosphoepitopes that are rapidly
  engaged by 14-3-3, leading to cytoplasmic retention of YAP and TAZ and the inhibition
  of their transcriptional activation potential. NPHP4 abrogates the interaction of
  large tumor suppressor with its substrates YAP and TAZ, which abolishes 14-3-3 binding
  and allows for nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ.
