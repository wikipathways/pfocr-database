caption: A schematic model of Dex-SPIONs protect HUVECs from H2O2 damage via inducing
  autophagy response. After intravenous injection, Dex-SPIONs can be internalized
  by HUVECs, resulting in the induction of autophagy flux by inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of PRAS40, an upstream autophagy blocker of autophagy through activating mTORC1.
  Then, NO generation is increased through upregulation of autophagy, probably due
  to the increased expression of eNOS. Eventually, the upregulated NO inhibits the
  phosphorylation of JNK and its downstream apoptotic pathway, leading to restoration
  of cell viability from oxidative damage
