caption: After chemotherapy or radiotherapy there can be activation of signaling pathways
  which can actually promote cell survival and may lead to therapy resistance. Chemotherapeutic
  drug treatment (shown in irregular black oval) frequently results in the induction
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (shown in black square). ROS can induce the calcium
  calmodulin kinase (CaM-K) cascade which can induce Ras which can subsequently activate
  both the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades (most components of the two
  cascades which promote signaling are show in green ovals, transcription factors
  activated by events are shown in yellow diamonds, transcription factors inactivated
  by events shown in black diamonds). Induction of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways can result in the activation of many survival pathways, and regulate both
  cell cycle progression as well as protein translation. Some of the phosphorylation
  events mediated by Akt actually serve to inhibit the activities of key proteins
  such as the Foxo transcription factors and the murine double minute (MDM2) ubiquitin
  ligase (depicted in black ovals). MDM2 serves to regulate p53 protein stability
  by ubiquitination, however when it is phosphorylated by Akt it is inactivated. Moreover
  chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy can induce the ataxia telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) protein shown in a black oval, which can in turn phosphorylate and regulate
  p53. p53 can have complex positive and negative effects on cell growth (depicted
  in yellow diamond), it can regulate the expression of p21 cyclin dependent kinase
  inhibitory protein-1 (p21Cip1) which controls cell cycle progression. p53 can also
  control the transcription of genes such as Puma, Noxa and Bax which are involved
  in apoptosis (all of these molecules are shown in black ovals, as they tend to inhibit
  cell cycle progression or promote apoptosis). Both Akt and ERK can phosphorylate
  p21Cip1 which alters its activity and ability to inhibit cell growth (shown as black
  phosphorylation sites) and subsequently influence cell growth and therapy resistance.
  p27Kip1 can also be phosphorylated by both Akt and ERK, however the effects of these
  phosphorylation events are unclear. Akt phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in
  its cytoplasmic localization, while ERK phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in
  elevated levels of the protein. Hence phosphorylation of proteins by ERK and Akt
  can have dramatic effects on cell proliferation and contribute to the therapy resistance.
  Chemo- and radiotherapy also induce breaks in the DNA. In the presence of functional
  BRCA1 and BRCA2 (indicated in yellow ovals) these breaks may be repaired and normal
  gene transcription can occur. However when BRCA1 or BRCA2 are mutated, the repair
  of these genes may not occur and proper gene transcription might not occur. This
  figure serves as an introduction as to how activation of these pathways by chemotherapy
  and radiotherapy may contribute to therapeutic resistance.

  description: After chemotherapy or radiotherapy there can be activation of signaling
    pathways which can actually promote cell survival and may lead to therapy resistance.
    Chemotherapeutic drug treatment (shown in irregular black oval) frequently results
    in the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (shown in black square). ROS
    can induce the calcium calmodulin kinase (CaM-K) cascade which can induce Ras
    which can subsequently activate both the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades
    (most components of the two cascades which promote signaling are show in green
    ovals, transcription factors activated by events are shown in yellow diamonds,
    transcription factors inactivated by events shown in black diamonds). Induction
    of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can result in the activation
    of many survival pathways, and regulate both cell cycle progression as well as
    protein translation. Some of the phosphorylation events mediated by Akt actually
    serve to inhibit the activities of key proteins such as the Foxo transcription
    factors and the murine double minute (MDM2) ubiquitin ligase (depicted in black
