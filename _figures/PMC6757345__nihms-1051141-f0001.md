caption: Fatty acids are carried across the mitochondrial membrane by the carnitine
  system consisting of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (isoforms a and b) and 2 (CPT1a,
  CPT1b, CPT2) working with carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). Under pathologic
  conditions transport can be reversed to release acylcarnitines from mitochondria.
  Beta-oxidation consists of four enzymatic steps. Step one is conducted by short-chain,
  medium-chain, long-chain, and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (SCAD, MCAD,
  LCAD, VLCAD). For long-chain substrates steps 2–4 are conducted by mitochondrial
  trifunctional protein (TFP) while for shorter substrates these steps are catalyzed
  by separate enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratases (ECH, ECHS1), the hydroxacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenases (HCDH, HCDH2), and finally, the thiolases (MKT, ACAT1). The genes
  indicated in red font have been studied for loss-of-function or gain-of-function
  relationships to insulin resistance and T2DM phenotypes. See  and text for details.
