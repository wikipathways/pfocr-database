caption: Correlation network among processes with activity modified by both OEA and
  KDS-5104 treatments is shown. Each node depicts individual biological activity.
  Histograms represent means ± SEM of semiquantitative activity of biological functions
  according to treatments, based on the hierarchical PLS computation performed from
  the individual components, with letters a, b, and c the ANOVA significance threshold
  (P < 0.05). Node size represents the importance of the process to predict adipose
  tissue mass (based on VIP values of the PLS analysis). The edges represent the absolute
  Pearson coefficient ρ values among the nodes. Edge thickness represents the strength
  of the correlation among connected nodes. The correlation network was built on the
  maximum stringency calculated from the minimum structure displaying all nodes. The
  significance of the Pearson correlation coefficient was checked by false discovery
  rate with a q value of <0.05. This threshold corresponded to Pearson correlation
  ρ values of >0.701. By convention, pathway score values of the control mice were
  always positive, thus emphasizing the contrasting effect of treatments. Individual
  pathway components are displayed as a heat map sorted according to hierarchical
  clustering (red box, relative increase; green box, relative decrease [see supplementary
  material for significant levels across treatments). The asterisk indicates which
  individual components in the biological module weighs more in the biological score
  process and is more likely to predict adipose tissue fat pads mass (greatest VIP
  index of the PLS analysis). Adipose tissue mass is shown as means ± SEM of unit
  of variance. AT, adipose tissue; G, gene; B, biochemical; P, physiological; ep,
  epididymal; per, peritoneal; intest., upper intestine; muscle, gastrocnemius muscle;
  ES, endocannabinoid signaling; GM, glucose metabolism; LT, lipid transport; EI,
  energy intake; LG, lipogenesis.
