caption: Effect of irradiation (IR) on infected versus uninfected cells. The diagram
  is a depiction of what may be occurring in HIV-1-infected T cells versus uninfected
  cells. Infected cells exposed to low-level IR (either single or multiple low doses)
  would deregulate the p53 pathway (i.e.p53/Tat binding,,,) and allow cells inappropriately
  to enter the S phase. The cells would then either enter apoptosis at the S or move
  to the G2 phase, followed by enhanced apoptosis through Vpr. Vpr has been shown
  to regulate the DNA damage response. The net effect is apoptosis of infected cells
  with increased viral release. Other potential deregulation of DNA damage response
  has been observed in HIV-infected cells through the DNA-PK/p53 pathway and other
  retroviruses, including HTLV. On the other hand, uninfected T cells, when exposed
  to IR, would activate their normal p53, leading to activation of p21/wafl and binding
  to cyclin/cdk complexes (i.e., cdk2/E, cdk2/A, or cdc2/B), resulting in blocks at
  the G1/S or G2/M for DNA repair. After a certain period of time required for DNA
  repair, cells would resume into the next phase of replication. The model assumes
  that viral gene expression is increased with IR over time and cellular apoptosis
  is enhanced by irreversible DNA damage to the infected cells, while the virus is
  replicating.
