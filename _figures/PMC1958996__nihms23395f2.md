caption: An alternative pathway to that presented in  exists whereby E2Fs and associated
  pocket proteins regulate expression of PPARγ1. Activation of PPARγ2 likely occurs
  through the induction of C/EBPα by PPARγ1, and C/EBPα then induces PPARγ2 expression.
  This model is consistent with a role for clonal expansion in promoting adipogenesis.
  G0, G1, and S correspond to phases of the cell cycle, while GD is a term used to
  define the growth-arrested state of terminally differentiated cells.
