caption: This diagram summarizes the switch from dopamine and serotonin mediated transmission
  (top), to serotonin mediated transmission (bottom) in direct pathway striatal neurons
  following neonatal 6-OHDA lesions. Within the intact striatum (top), dopamine acting
  at D1 dopamine receptors, together with serotonin acting at 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors,
  results in DARPP-32 phosphorylation via cAMP and PKA. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors
  also leads to DARPP-32 phosphorylation, this time through PLC and casein kinase
  1. Although DARPP-32 is not the only target of PKA and PLC, it represents a central
  regulatory mechanism within striatal projecting neurons, mediating the effects of
  both dopamine and serotonin ().Following neonatal 6-OHDA lesions (bottom), signaling
  via dopamine D1 receptors is redundant, as dopamine is absent. Under these conditions,
  DARPP-32 phosphorylation is under the control of the 5-HT receptors. The post-lesion
  striatum is characterized by increased 5-HT2A receptor expression and 5-HT axonal
  hyperinnervation. Both of these alterations are likely to significantly enhance
  the ability of 5-HT to regulate DARPP-32 phosphorylation and therefore neuronal
  function. In addition, 5-HT2 receptors couple to the ERK1/2/MAP Kinase pathway,
  which is crucial for neuronal and synaptic plasticity. This pathway is not used
  under normal conditions (see top). Activation of ERK1/2 could provide an alternative
  signaling route to the nucleus, leading to the activation of transcription factors
  that regulate neuronal gene expression, and ultimately neuronal plasticity. ERK1/2
  activation could represent a mechanism which allows direct pathway neurons to adapt
  and remain functional in the absence of dopamine.
