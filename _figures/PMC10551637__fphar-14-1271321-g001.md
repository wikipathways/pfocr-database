caption: Mechanism of Action of Nanoparticles Targeting Bone Marrow Cells in the Modulation
  of Immunotherapy After being phagocytosed by myeloid cells, nanoparticles can activate
  the STING signaling pathway in tumor-associated macrophages, thereby initiating
  cellular immunity. At the same time, they can release the carried LncRNA or miRNA
  to silence specific gene expressions, leading to a transformation in the macrophage
  subtype. Nanoparticles carrying specific ligands such as PD1, B7, and OX40 can bind
  to specific ligands on dendritic cells and M1-type macrophages, enhancing the antigen
  presentation ability of dendritic cells and M1-type macrophages and strengthening
  the specific immunity against tumor cells. Nanoparticles carrying chemotherapy drugs
  have a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor tissues, promoting immunogenic cell death
  (ICD) and thus enhancing the direct cytotoxic effects of T cells and NK cells on
  tumor cells. In addition, during blood transport, nanoparticles wrap Lipidosomes
  and PEG to reduce cytotoxic side effects on normal tissues, enhancing the specificity
  of immunotherapy.
