caption: Hypothalamic insulin signaling. Insulin binds to insulin receptor on the
  cell membrane, leading to the phosphorylation of IRS, which in turn activates PI3K,
  to generate PIP3 that activates Akt via PDK1. Akt phosphorylates FOXO1 leading to
  its expulsion from the nucleus, leading to decreased Npy and Agrp and increased
  Pomc expression. Akt also activates mTOR signaling. Palmitate impairs insulin signaling
  by inducing, inflammation, ER stress, and lysosomal and proteasomal degradation
  of INSR or IRS. Components of the insulin signal transduction pathway are targeted
  by miRNAs include. INSR is targeted by miR-1983 and miR-7, IRS is targeted by miR-7
  and miR-200a, and PI3K is targeted by miR-103.
