caption: A, The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway and additional branches downstream
  of Axin/GSK-3. In the absence of Wnt (ligand), a destruction complex consisting
  of Axin, APC, GSK-3, and CK1 catalyzes sequential phosphorylation of β-catenin,
  leading to ubiquitylation by β-TRCP ubiquitin ligase and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. Independently of β-catenin, GSK-3 destabilizes other proteins that
  are regulated by Wnt-STOP (Wnt-stabilization of proteins) signaling and also suppresses
  mTORC1 and the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ. B, Upon Wnt binding to Frizzled
  and LRP co-receptors, Axin is recruited to LRP and APC dissociates from the complex.
  GSK-3 phosphorylation of β-catenin is inhibited; unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulates,
  translocates to the nucleus, and binds to TCF, leading to Wnt target gene expression.
  Wnt mediated inhibition of GSK-3 also activates mTORC1 (proliferation, growth, translation),
  YAP/TAZ (Hippo signaling), and Wnt-STOP (protein stabilization) independently of
  but in parallel with β-catenin.
