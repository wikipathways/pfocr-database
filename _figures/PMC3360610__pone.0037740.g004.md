caption: '(A) Metabolome and transcriptome data of the pathway involved in biosynthesis
  and catabolism of polyamines and related metabolites from arginine. The average
  concentrations of each metabolite (nmol/1×106 cells) at time intervals (0, 0.5,
  2, 8, 24, 48 and 120 h) are shown. The enzymes are shown in yellow or blue in case
  where their transcript levels increased or decreased by >3 fold relative to time
  0 h, respectively. Abbreviations are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; AdoMet, S-Adenosyl
  methionine; dAdoMet, S-adenosylmethioninamine. Solid lines represent the steps catalyzed
  by the enzymes whose encoding genes are present in the genome, whereas dashed lines
  indicate those likely absent in the genome. Abbreviations are: MAO, monoamine oxidase;
  AdoMDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; SPDS, spermidine synthase; SPS, spermine
  synthase; GAD, glutamate decarboxylase. Data are shown as means ± S.D. Statistical
  comparisons were made by Student''s t test (* P<0.05, ** P<0.01). (B) Level of some
  biogenic amines and its precursors during encystation. X-axis represents time in
  hours, whereas Y-axis represents the concentration of metabolites in nmoles/1×106
  cells. Data are represented as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made by
  Student''s t test (* P<0.05, ** P<0.01).'
