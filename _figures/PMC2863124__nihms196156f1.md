caption: A schematic representation of the DNA damage and replication checkpoints
  in various organisms. The human/mouse pathway is based on evidence from both organisms.
  Bold arrows indicate some evidence for direct biochemical regulation, although this
  evidence may only be in vitro phosphorylation. Dashed arrows indicate that the regulation
  has been shown in vivo not to be sufficient for establishment of cell cycle arrest.
  In both cases the regulation seems to be more important for maintenance of the arrest.
  A question mark after a protein indicates that there is only circumstantial evidence
  for its involvement. A question mark without a protein indicates that there is evidence
  for some protein at that point in the pathway, but no evidence as to its identity.
