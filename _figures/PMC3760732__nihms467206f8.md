caption: Schematic representation of pathway interactions among HGF/c-Met, PI3K/Akt,
  and Notch signaling pathways. Activation of Notch receptor (red) by Delta/Jagged
  ligands (green) results in translocation of NICD (red oval) to the nucleus (purple),
  where Hes1 repressor (black) is upregulated, leading to downregulation of PTEN and
  c-Met transcription., NICD also induces proliferative signaling (green box). Activation
  of c-Met receptor (brown) by ligand HGF (yellow oval) stimulates PI3K (pink) and
  pAkt (blue) signaling. Phospho-Akt may interact with NICD in the nucleus, potentially
  increasing expression of Delta/Jagged ligands.
