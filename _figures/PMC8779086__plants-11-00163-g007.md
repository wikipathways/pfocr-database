caption: The hypothetical involvement of proteins with lectin domains in plant defense.
  The lectin gene whose expression changed drastically during the Fusarium oxysporum
  infection and their potential association with the general processes are presented.
  The downregulated and upregulated pathways are given in blue and red backgrounds,
  respectively. Lectins are part of a comprehensive network of plant-pathogen interactions
  that includes cross-talk between plant resistance and pathogen spread. SA—salicylic
  acid, JA—jasmonic acid, ABA—abscisic acid, MEP—non-mevalonate pathway.
