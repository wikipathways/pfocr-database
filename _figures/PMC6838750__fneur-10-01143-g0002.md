caption: Main processes involved in exercise-induced and neurotrophin-mediated increased
  viability of dopaminergic neurons. Physical activity leads to an increased level
  of neurotrophins in the brain. This upregulation stimulates anti-apoptotic proteins,
  mediates clustering and release of synaptic vesicles, activates CREB leading to
  phosphorylation and activation of TH, increases BH4 level allowing conversion of
  tyrosine to L-DOPA, activates a pathway that inhibits DAT activity, increases blood
  flow and angiogenesis, enhances neurogenesis, and reduces inflammation. In summary,
  all these processes lead to greater survival of dopaminergic neurons and increased
  level of dopamine. Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; CREB, cAMP
  response-element binding protein; DAT, dopamine transporter; L-DOPA, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine;
  TH, tyrosine hydroxylase.
