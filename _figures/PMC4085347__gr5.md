caption: A mechanism showing tyrosine kinase receptor induced regulation of Nrf2 nuclear–cytoplasmic
  shuttling under redox homeostasis conditions. The cytoplasmic signal transduction
  (blue) of GSK3ß regulates the Nrf2 phosphorylation and its transfer from nucleus
  (pink) to cytoplasm. The GSK3ß acts as an upstream regulator for Src-family kinases
  which include Fyn/Src/Lyn/Fgr kinases. Gradually, when cell achieves the redox homeostasis
  state, the activated GSK-3ß phosphorylates Fyn kinase at threonine residue to promote
  nuclear localization of Fyn. The phosphorylated Fyn kinase further phosphorylates
  Nrf2 Try568 residue within the nucleus, which result in Nrf2 separation from ARE
  leading to export/degradation of Nrf2 from the nucleus. On the other hand, during
  early response of oxidative stress, PKC mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 at ser-40,
  inactivated the GSK3ß due to the phosphorylation at ser-9 residue and only basal
  level of Fyn kinase expression was detected. The Fyn kinases were auto-phosphorylated
  at Tyr213 residue via unknown tyrosine kinase signalling. The Tyr-213 phosphorylated
  Fyn exported from nucleus via Crm1-exportin so that Nrf2–ARE expression was enhanced
  in early response to oxidative stress conditions [] Fyn acted as an inhibitor of
  Nrf2–ARE complex at a later stage of oxidative stress when cell is trying to attain
  a redox homeostasis (delayed response).
