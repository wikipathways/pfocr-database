caption: Effects of quercetin on cancer cell growth and proliferation. (A) Quercetin-triggered
  cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle is downregulated by quercetin-related mechanisms at
  the all stages. Cyclin B, a mitotic cyclin, is complexed with CDK1 to regulate the
  cell growth and mitosis progression (transition stage of G2 to M). In the cell cycle,
  cyclin D is also known as a key regulator in transition stage of M to G1 phase and
  is complexed with CDK4/6 to regulate the cell cycle. CDK2, a serine/threonine protein
  kinase, plays a crucial role in the initiation of DNA synthesis in the transition
  stage of G1/S. CDK2 also has a role in the transition stage of S/G2 in which it
  forms a complex of cyclin A/CDK2 to phosphorylate CDC6 and E2F1 and then triggers
  the S/G2 phase transition. These functional proteins, including CDK1, CDK2, cyclin
  B and cyclin D, are suppressed in quercetin-exposed tumor cells. (B) Quercetin-triggered
  downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt protein binds Fz family receptor
  in the signaling pathway and then it disrupts the function of destruction complex
  to inactivate the GSK3. This mechanism allows the β-catenin to localize in nucleus
  for activation of TCF/LEF transcription factors. In the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, quercetin inhibits the nuclear translocation of the β-catenin. (C) Quercetin-triggered
  suppression of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT pathway. In the signaling pathway of JAK/STAT,
  a cytokine activates its receptor to trigger the cascade phosphorylation of its
  proteins (JAK and STAT proteins), which plays a crucial role for activating the
  transcription process-related genes. In the signaling pathway, the quercetin may
  suppress the phosphorylation of STAT by JAKs. As for PI3K/AKT pathway, it is triggered
  by EGF and the catalytic domain of EGFR kinases and then all protein kinases such
  as PI3K, AKT and mTOR are phosphorylated to regulate the cell growth and proliferation.
  This signaling pathway is also suppressed through quercetin-exposed mechanisms.
  (D) Quercetin-triggered induction of ATM and MAPK pathway. ATM signaling pathway
  can be induced by EGFR and Mre11 complex and it activates p53 protein for DNA reparation
  and cell apoptosis. As for the MAPK pathway, MEK and RAF are induced by quercetin
  to activate the JNK, p38 and ERK in the signaling pathway for apoptosis induction
  and proliferation suppression. CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDC6, phosphorylate
