caption: Pathway for the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. A diagram of the
  general synthesis pathway for PUFAs. Mammalian enzymes are drawn in blue accompanied
  by solid black reaction arrows. The Δ12 and omega-3 desaturase enzymes (gray with
  dashed gray arrows) are included, as C. elegans possess these desaturase activities;
  however, C. elegans do not synthesize the 22+ carbon PUFAs produced in mammals.
