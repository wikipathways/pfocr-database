caption: Network-based clusters identification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. (A) Cluster 1 was related to MAPK and FoxO pathways.
  (B) Cluster 2 was related to PI3K-Akt and HIF-1 pathways. (C) Cluster 3 was related
  to TNF and AGE-RAGE pathways. (D) Cluster 4 was related to the fatty acid degradation
  pathway. (E) Cluster 5 was related to the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. (F)
  Cluster 6 was related to the relaxin pathway.
