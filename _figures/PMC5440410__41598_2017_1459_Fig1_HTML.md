caption: 'Schematic representation showing the link between the choline synthesis
  and the Wnt-mediated β-catenin pathway. (a) Normal breast tissue: In a normal breast
  tissue Wnt (green polygon) signalling is absent and β-catenin (brown rectangles)
  level is maintained low in the cell cytosol due to phosphorylation (red stars) and
  degradation of β-catenin. Also, cyclin D1 (red circles) translocates to the nucleus
  at a reduced rate to participate in G1 to S phase transition. The cell division
  rate is regulated. Phosphatidyl choline (PtdCho; blue rectangle) which is a membrane
  phospholipid, converts into phosphocholine (PCho; brown triangle) in the cytosol
  by the activity of phospholipase D (PLD; grey circle). (b) Malignant breast tissue:
  During malignancy, Wnt signalling is active and hence β-catenin increases in the
  cytosol which can translocate to the nucleus and bind to cyclin D1 (brown rectangle + red
  circle), to increase the rate of cellular transcription. With the increase in cellular
  proliferation, membrane requirement for PtdCho increases which in turn leads to
  increased PLD activity (double grey circle). PCho increases in the cell cytosol,
  thereby increasing the tCho levels. Increased cytosolic β-catenin levels also increases
  the activity of PLD.'
