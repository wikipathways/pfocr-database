caption: The proposed mechanism how aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) may affect the
  progression of pancreatic cancer (PC) through the activation of Notch signaling
  pathway []. ASPH catalyzes the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues
  present in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of Notch receptors and ligands.
  The C-terminal catalytic domain of ASPH contains the amino acid (AA) sequence M670HPGTHM675.
  After ASPH overexpression is induced, the enzyme interacts with the EGF-like repeats
  in Notch receptor extracellular domain (ECD), promoting the interaction between
  Notch receptor and its ligand (e.g., Jagged [JAG]). The receptor-ligand interaction
  induces a conformational change of the Notch receptor, leading to S2 and S3 cleavage.
  The S3 cleavage releases the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma
  membrane, which then enters the nucleus and mediates the conversion of the CSL [CBF1–Su(H)–LAG1]
  repressor complex into a transcriptional activation complex and the recruitment
  of mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) coactivator protein, leading to the transcriptional
  activation of a number of downstream target genes, including those from hairy and
  enhancer of split (HES) and hairy-related transcription factor (HRT or HEY) families,
  cyclin D1 (CCND1), c-myc, cyclooxygenase-2 or prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
  2 (PTGS2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGFA).
