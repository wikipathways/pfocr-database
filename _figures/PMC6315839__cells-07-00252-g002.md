caption: 'Model of biosynthesis and signal transduction of jasmonic acid (JA) and
  ethylene (ET). JA and ET can synergistically activate ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3)
  and ethylene insensitive 1 (EIL1), which are positive regulators of ERF1 and octadecanoid-responsive
  Arabidopsis AP2 59 (ORA59), leading to the induction of plant defensin 1.2 (PDF1.2).
  The active form jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile) can be recognized by coronatine
  insensitive 1 (COI1) and the co-receptor Inositolpentakis phosphate 5 (InsP5), causing
  the degradation of jasmonate ZIMs (JAZs). There are two antagonistic branches in
  the JA response: the MYC branch and the ERF branch. JAZ proteins can suppress the
  activity of MYC2, the positive regulator of Vegetative storage protein 2 (VSP2),
  by enrolling the negative regulator Topless (TPL) via the novel interactor of JAZ
  (NINJA). MYC2 can directly interact with mediator 25 (MED25, which is a subunit
  of the mediator. MYC2 can activate the expression of NAC domain containing proteins
  (ANACs) to upregulate VSP2. MYC3 and MYC4 can activate JA response additively with
  MYC2 by binding to the G-box. JAZs could also suppress the activity of jasmonate
  associated MYC2 like proteins (JAMs), which are a group of transcriptional repressors
  that could bind to the MYC2 target sequence G-box to negatively regulate the JA
  response. The MYC2 protein is regulated at protein levels. MYC2 can be ubiquitinated
  during the JA response for degradation. Thus, JA-mediated defense is suppressed.
  Conversely, MYC2 can be inversely deubiquitinated to stay stable, triggering a positive
  regulation on JA response. In the ERF branch, JAZs can inhibit the activity of EIN3
  and EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) by direct association with them and enrollment of the histone
  deacetylase 6 (HDA6). In the ET pathway, there are five ethylene receptors localized
  in the ER membrane. A copper ion interacts with the ethylene-binding domain. The
  interaction is required for high-affinity ethylene-binding activity. By binding
  to ET, constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1) is deactivated by ET receptors. CTR1
  can inhibit EIN2, which activates EIN3 and EIL1 by preventing their degradation
  of them via EIN3-binding F box protein 1 and 2 (EBF1 and EBF2). Activation (closed
  arrowhead), suppression (⊥), and important genes are indicated.'
