caption: How type-A GABA receptors may function as an electrochemical vulnerability
  to cancer cells. (A) In an embryonic cell, the GABAA receptor upon binding of GABA
  moves chloride anions out of the cell and is depolarizing (top), while in a mature
  neuron, GABAA receptors move chloride anions into the cell upon binding of GABA
  and is hyperpolarizing (bottom). (B) In cancer cells, the direction of ion flow
  is out of the cell, like that of the embryonic receptor. (C) Anion flow is enhanced
  upon binding of a benzodiazepine, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.
  Within minutes of benzodiazepine binding to the GABAA receptor, the significant
  efflux of chloride anions depolarizes the mitochondrial transmembrane as well causes
  their fission. In addition, there is enhanced expression of the oncogene TP53. (D)
  The intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway is activated, including an enhanced
  expression and localization of the BCL2 Associated Agonist of Cell Death (BAD) protein.
  There are also significant morphological changes in the cancer cells, including
  DNA duplication, as illustrated. Created with BioRender.com.
