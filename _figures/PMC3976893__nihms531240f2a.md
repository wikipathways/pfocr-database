caption: Roles of SOCS in feedback regulation of innate immunity. (A) Cytokines bind
  to membrane receptors and transduce signals through activation of JAK/STAT. SOCS
  protein is up-regulated by this pathway, and in turn feedback blocks cytokine signaling
  by targeting the JAK/STAT pathway. (B) SOCS1 inhibits LPS-activated Toll-like receptor
  signaling pathway by directly blocking IRAK1 and IRAK4.
