caption: Presumed intracellular signaling pathways of G-protein coupled receptors
  (GPCRs) in smooth muscle contraction. GPCR activation leads to shared, but possibly
  also to family- or subtype-specific responses in intracellular signaling, the latter
  being imparted by different patterns of G protein coupling. Gαq/11 proteins may
  preferentially activate phospholipase (PLC)-β, leading to the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Gα12/13 proteins interact with RhoGEFs and consequently
  preferentially active RhoA/Rho kinase. The Gαs protein family activates adenylate
  cyclase, while the Gαi/o protein family inhibits the enzyme. (A) α1-adrenoceptor
  with its subtypes (α1A,B,D), activated by methoxamine (MXE), phenylephrine (PE),
  and noradrenaline (NA). All three subtypes are present in the hyperplastic prostate
  at a ratio of 85:1:14 for α1A:α1B:α1D. (B) Thromboxane receptor (TP), activated
  by the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. (C) Endothelin A receptor (ETA), activated
  by endothelin-1 (ET-1). (D) Muscarinic receptor with its subtypes M1-5. All subtypes
  of muscarinic receptors are activated by methacholine (MCH), while carbachol (CCH)
  only activates subtypes M1, M3-5. Human detrusor smooth muscle predominantly contains
  subtypes M2 and M3 at a ratio of 3:1. After . Previously supposed, receptor-specific
  preferences in G protein coupling and intracellular receptors are indicated by different
  arrow sizes (bold, presumably predominant pathway for a receptor) (see text for
  details). * presumed signaling pathway of M3 receptors in the human detrusor.
