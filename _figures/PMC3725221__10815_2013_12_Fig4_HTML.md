caption: A schematic of the events within the granulosa cell depicting how the interactions
  of LHR and adiponectin might occur. LH or hCG binds and activates the LH receptor
  which increases cAMP and activates the PKA pathway of signal transduction. This
  increases AdipoR2 mRNA expression and also results in the translocation of R2 to
  the cell membrane. Adiponectin binding of AdipoR2 activates an as-yet undetermined
  signaling pathway and increases the production of Progesterone from the 22OH-cholesterol
  substrate
