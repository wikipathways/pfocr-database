caption: Vascular endothelial cells and the development of early atherosclerotic lesions.
  Early lesions of atherosclerosis in the human carotid artery develop in the area
  of a major curvature (carotid sinus) exposed to low time-average shear stress, a
  high oscillatory shear index, and steep temporal and spatial gradients. Endothelial
  cells at this site display an atheroprone phenotype, which promotes a proinflammatory
  milieu driven by the priming of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is then perpetuated
  in response to subendothelial apoB LPs. NF-κB activation promotes the entry of blood-borne
  monocytes (blue cells) through the junctions of endothelial cells (orange cells)
  into the intima, and there, monocytes differentiate into macrophages (red cells).
  In contrast, arterial geometries that are exposed to uniform laminar flow evoke
  an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype driven by the transcriptional integrators
  KLF2 and KLF4. This atheroprotective endothelial phenotype, together with a decrease
  in LP retention, promotes an antiinflammatory and antithrombotic environment that
  affords relative protection from atherosclerotic lesion development.
