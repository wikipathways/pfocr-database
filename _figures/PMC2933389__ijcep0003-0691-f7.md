caption: p-mTOR triggers progression of the cells to G1 phase of the cell cycle. In
  diffuse PHHI, the mature acinar and ductal cells with admixed endocrine and exocrine
  component express p-mTOR on the plasmalemmal aspect, and these cells enter cell
  cycle, as it is highlighted by the expression of Ki67. However, they do not progress
  to S phase (Skp2 of 0.18%). These cells have nuclear expression of p27Kip1 - a Cyclin
  E/Cdk2 complex inhibitor; these findings support the theory that there is G0/G1
  phase arrest in diffuse PHHI.
