caption: Dietary restriction (DR) is associated with a decreased activity of the target
  of rapamycin (TOR) pathway which down regulates the level of protein synthesis,
  leading to a reduced fertility. DR induces an increase in the ribosomal loading
  of genes encoding for proteins participating to the electron transfer chain (ETC.)
  having shorter 5′UTRs, with lower GC content and lesser secondary structure than
  the average cell proteins. The increased expression of Complex I and Complex IV
  proteins results in an enhanced ETC functions and increased lifespan. Essential
  amino acid (EAA) supplementation, and in particular by methionine, in the presence
  of DR is associated with an of IIS–insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) expression
  which counters the down-regulation of TOR activity and the negative effects on fertility
  while lifespan extension is maintained
