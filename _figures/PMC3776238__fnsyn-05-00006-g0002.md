caption: Wnt regulation of larval NMJ differentiation. Vesicular release of the Wnt-binding
  protein Evenness Interrupted/Wntless/Sprinter (Evi/Wls/Srt) facilitates pre-synaptic
  secretion of Wingless/Wg. In the pre-synaptic bouton, binding of Wg to the Frizzled-2
  receptor (DFz2) activates components of the canonical pathway and leads to pre-synaptic
  differentiation. In the post-synaptic muscle, Wg binds to DFz2, inducing endocytosis
  of the receptor. As part of the Frizzled nuclear import (FNI) pathway, Evi/Wls/Srt
  recruits the Wg receptor-interacting protein dGRIP, leading to transport of DFz2
  to the nucleus. Entry of DFz2 into the nucleus alters gene expression, promoting
  post-synaptic, and possibly, pre-synaptic differentiation (red dotted arrow). Additional
  regulators of Wg signaling excluded from this figure include laminin A, integrin,
  the HSPG perlecan/trol and HSPG sulfation. In addition, Wnt5 is also secreted by
  the pre-synaptic bouton (black dotted arrow) and acts through the tyrosine kinase-like
  receptor Derailed (Drl) to promote pre-synaptic differentiation retrogradely (red
  dotted arrow).
