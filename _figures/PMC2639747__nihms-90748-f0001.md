caption: Mechanisms of Smad3 in TGF-β–induced antiproliferative transcriptional responses.
  In repressing the protooncogene c-Myc, a preexisting cytoplasmic complex containing
  Smad3, E2F4/5, and p107 likely begins to move into the nucleus in response to ligand
  stimulation and binds DNA at a RSBE/TIE site in the c-Myc promoter. Smad4 is recruited
  to this complex as well. In the induction of CDK inhibitors p15Ink4b and p21Cip1,
  a different Smad3/4 complex cooperates with FOXO at a distal promoter element to
  activate transcription. The PI3K/Akt pathway has the ability to antagonize TGF-β/Smad3
  signaling by inhibiting FOXO nuclear localization. The Smad3/4 complex also stimulates
  transcription in conjunction with Sp1 at a proximal promoter element. Finally, transcription
  of p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 is directly repressed by c-Myc through its association with
  Miz-1 and/or Smad2/3 at the initiator site. Thus, attenuating c-Myc expression is
  a prerequisite for induction of p15Ink4b and p21Cip1.
