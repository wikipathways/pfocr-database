caption: First, HMGA1 accelerates the transition of G1 into S phase in cervical cancer
  cells by regulating cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, which further promotes tumor growth.
  Second, HMGA1 promotes cell migration and invasion in cervical cancer by the miR-221/222-TIMP3-MMP2/MMP9
  pathway not by the miR-221/222-MMP2/MMP9 pathway, which consequently induces tumor
  metastasis. Lastly, HMGA1 can directly regulate the transcription of MMP2 and MMP9
