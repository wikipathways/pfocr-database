caption: Sphingolipids act as critical bioactive signaling molecules to determine
  many aspects of cell fate and function. Central to the sphingolipid pathway is ceramide,
  a key mediator of the apoptotic response of cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic
  drugs. Ionizing radiation activates acid SMase to induce the conversion of sphingomyelin
  to ceramide. Chemotherapies including TMZ promote ceramide accumulation through
  multiple mechanisms, including the activation of ceramide synthases and N-SMase
  (shown in blue). Enhanced activity of other key enzymes involved in sphingolipid
  metabolism, including acid ceramidase, sphingosine kinases or glucosylceramide synthase
  (shown in red), represent mechanisms which GBM cells exploit to overcome existing
  therapies through reducing therapy-induced ceramide accumulation.
