caption: 'Sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Ceramide is the central hub of sphingolipid
  biosynthesis. Ceramide can be formed through de novo synthesis, salvage pathway,
  or through the hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids (blue). In the de novo synthesis
  pathway, serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) condenses L-serine + palmitoyl-CoA to
  generate 3-ketosphinganine (3-keto-dihydrosphingosine). The enzyme 3-ketosphinganine
  reductase (3-KDSR) then reduces 3-ketosphinganine to generate sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine),
  which is then converted to dihydroceramide by (dihydro)ceramide synthases 1–6 (CerS1–6).
  Dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) catalyzes the formation of ceramide by desaturating
  dihydroceramide. In the salvage pathway, sphingosine can be converted to ceramide
  by CerS1–6. Ceramide can also be metabolized by ceramidases (CDases) to generate
  sphingosine, which is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SPHK1 and SPHK2)
  to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In reverse, S1P phosphatases (SGPP) can
  dephosphorylate S1P to reproduce sphingosine. The irreversible actions of S1P lyase
  can metabolize S1P to yield ethanolamine 1-phosphate and C16 fatty aldehyde, the
  sphingolipid metabolic pathway exit point. Ceramide kinase (CERK) can phosphorylate
  ceramide to generate ceramide-1-phosphate, which can also be used to regenerate
  ceramide by phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP). In the hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids,
  sphingomyelin can be generated from ceramide by sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), which
  allows phosphorylcholine transfer to ceramide from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and
  releasing diacylglycerol (DAG). In return, sphingomyelinases (SMases) cleave sphingomyelin,
  leading to the release of phosphocholine and ceramide. Additionally, glucosylceramide
  synthase (GCS) and ceramide galactosyltransferase (UGT8) generate glucosylceramide
  and galactosylceramide, respectively, from ceramide. This process is also reversible.
  Abbreviations: GlcCDase, glucosylceramidase; GCDase, galactosylceramidase; GAL3ST1,
  galactosylceramide sulfotransferase. The pink coloring indicates bioactive sphingolipids,
  and the blue coloring indicates complex sphingolipids [47]'
