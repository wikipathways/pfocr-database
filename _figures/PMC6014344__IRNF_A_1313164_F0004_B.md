caption: Cross-link between TGF-β pathway, Wnt pathway, and ILK pathway. This simplified
  schematic shows major intracellular signaling networks and mediators involved in
  the regulation of podocyte EMT. Overall, TGF-β is the prototypic inducer and TGF-β/Smad
  pathway is the essential one of podocyte EMT, whereas the effects of other mediators
  are often context-dependent, variable, and incomplete. Activated ILK directly phosphorylates
  several physiologically important downstream effector kinases including Akt and
  GSK-3β, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin, which indirectly controls the
  expression of an array of genes that are required for the EMT process. As to Wnt
  network, upon binding to Wnt receptor, activated Wnt proteins induce a series of
  downstream signaling events involving Disheveled (Dvl), axin, adenomatosis polyposis
  coli (APC), casein kinase-1 (CK-1), and GSK-3β, resulting in dephosphorylation of
  β-catenin. TGF-β, ILK, and Wnt signals are interconnected and converged at the phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β and activation of β-catenin, which leads to the activation of EMT transcriptional
  programs. Therefore, β-catenin, to some extent, could function as a master switch
  that can integrate signal inputs from multiple pathways and control the EMT-related
  transcriptome.
