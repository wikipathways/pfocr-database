caption: Leptin is generated in adipose tissue and transported via the bloodstream
  to the hypothalamus. The binding of leptin to leptin receptors (ObRb) stimulates
  the expression of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and pro-opiomelanocortin
  (POMC). Simultaneously the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related
  peptide (AgRP) is suppressed. POMC is transformed by means of proprotein convertase
  1 (coded by PCSK1), partly into α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which
  functions as an agonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). The stimulation of
  MC4R, or the resulting activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which
  binds to tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), leads to a saturated (anorexigenic)
  state. If, in contrast, little or no leptin is present, the hunger-stimulating (orexigenic)
  peptides NPY and AgRP are expressed. AgRP is a direct antagonist of MC4R. A large
  proportion of the mutations that lead to monogenic forms of obesity are found in
  the genes that code for the proteins of the leptinergic–melanocortinergic metabolic
  pathway (red boxes). For three of these genes (POMC, MC4R, and BDNF), genome-wide
  significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to polygenic
  forms of obesity were found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
