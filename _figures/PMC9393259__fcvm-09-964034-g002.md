caption: The role of DAMPs released from ferroptotic CMs in inflammation. The release
  of DAMPs from ferroptotic cells activates the downstream NF-κB inflammatory pathway
  through the TLR and RAGE receptors of inflammatory cells, leading to the production
  of inflammatory factors (e.g., NF-κB, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β) which were
  also produced due to the increase of ROS to induce more CMs ferroptosis. In addition,
  ECs respond to DAMPs via TLR4 receptors and release chemokines to promote more inflammatory
  cells entering the myocardial microenvironment. CM, cardiomyocyte; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern; HMGB, high mobility group
  box; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; TLR, Toll-like receptors;
  MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; NLRP,
  NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein; NLRC, NLR family CARD
  domain containing; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; IL, interleukin; TRIF,
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; IFN, interferon; EC, endothelial
  cell.
