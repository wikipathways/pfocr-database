caption: IGF2BP2 is highly activated in fibrotic livers of mice. Mechanistically,
  IGF2BP2 enhances the stability of the m6A-modified transcript ALDOA in the glycolytic
  metabolic pathway, which is crucial for HSCs activation. In addition, lactate produced
  by activated HSCs via the glycolytic pathway serves as a substrate for lactylation,
  which plays an essential role in the activation of HSCs. Created with BioRender.com
