  Analysis tool using lineage specific (B16-MDSCs vs DCs) differentially expressed
  proteins, which shows detailed interaction relationships between the input nodes
  (differentially expressed proteins between MDSCs and DCs), and regulatory kinases
  encircled in blue. This interactome links SRC kinases with protein transport, mRNA
  processing, cytoskeletal re-organization and decreased glycolysis. Nodes in red,
  up-regulated proteins. Nodes in green, down-modulated proteins. In white, predicted
  protein nodes. A, activation; B, binding; C, causes/leads to; CC, chemical-chemical
  interaction; CP, chemical-protein interaction; E, expression; EC, enzyme catalysis;

  Protein-Protein binding; PR Protein-RNA binding; RB Regulation of Binding; RE Reaction;
  RR RNA-RNA Binding; T Transcription; TR Translocation. Dash arrows, indirect interactions.
