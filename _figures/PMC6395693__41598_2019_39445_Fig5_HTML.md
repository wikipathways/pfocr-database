caption: 'Transcription factor regulatory effect network identified using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA). In the network nodes, the upper panel shows transcription
  factors, the middle panel shows differentially expressed genes, and the lower panel
  shows biological functions and diseases. For the network edges, a solid line indicates
  direct interaction, while a dashed line indicate indirect interaction. Node colours
  in upper and lower panels: predicted activation in orange; predicted inhibition
  in blue. Node colours in middle panel: downregulated in data set coloured green;
  upregulated in data set coloured red (not represented in this network). Edge colours;
  predicted activation in orange; predicted inhibition in blue, findings inconsistent
  with state of downstream node in yellow; effect not predicted in grey.'
