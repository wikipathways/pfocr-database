caption: Simplified representation of the regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway
  and differentially regulated genes. Regulation of actin cytoskeleton encompasses
  signaling to the cytoskeleton through GPCRs, ITGs and growth factor (GF) – RTKs,
  leading to diverse cell functions including changes in cell motility, proliferation
  and survival., , ,  GPCR signaling is activated by a number of external stimuli
  and signals through heterotrimeric G-proteins, which in turn stimulates a variety
  of downstream signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K, FAK and Rho family of GTPases
  (Rho, Rac and cell division cycle 42 – CDC42) and downstream protein kinase effectors
  including p21-activated kinase (PAK).,  Within the 35-gene signature, F2R and OPN3,
  both GPCR proteins, were dysregulated. Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) are
  multifunctional signaling proteins that directly bind to activated G-proteins and
  are integral for modulation of the GPCR signaling process. RGS12, a RGS protein,
  is upregulated in the resistant cell lines. RTKs are high-affinity cell surface
  receptors for GF and are key regulators of normal cellular processes and progression
  of many types of cancers. Predominant signaling pathway that mediates signals from
  RTK-GF is the MAPK pathway. FAK and PI3K pathways are also known to have important
  roles in signal transduction. FGF9, a GF, is upregulated in the resistant cell lines.
  ITGs are a family of cell-surface-adhesion receptors that transmit signals to the
  cell to determine migration, survival, differentiation and motility in context with
  the GPCR and RTK-GF signaling. One of the first integrin signaling molecules to
  be activated is FAK, which in turn activates other signaling pathways. Signaling
  initiated by GPCR, RTK-GF or ITGs results in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton
  and KIF4A, upregulated in resistant cell lines, is a known actin cytoskeleton protein.
  Genes upregulated in the resistant cell lines are shown in red, whereas downregulated
  genes are shown in blue
