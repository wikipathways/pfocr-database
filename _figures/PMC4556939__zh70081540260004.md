caption: 'Dynamic features of FID-induced gene expression pathway: differentially
  expressed transcripts between cumulus cells derived from COCs after 6 h of in vitro
  maturation (Ct-6H) and with FID-supplementation (FID-6H) were subjected to Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis. Considering the genes implicated in cumulus physiology, gene expression
  pathway revealed activation of PKA, ERK1/2, and calcium pathways. The genes involved
  in cumulus expansion, ovulation, steroidogenesis, glucose metabolism, intracellular
  signaling, and oocyte competence were upregulated. Molecular relationships are based
  upon the Ingenuity knowledge base.'
