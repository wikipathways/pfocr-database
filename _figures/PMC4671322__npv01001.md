caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic metabolic phenotype. Oncogenic
  pathway alterations driving the Warburg effect involve (i) activation of the PI3
  K/Akt/mTOR pathway driving a glycolytic state (light green arrows); (ii) pyruvate
  kinase induced negative regulation of glycolysis, which provides glycolytic intermediates
  necessary to facilitate macromolecular biosynthesis (orange arrows); and (iii) shunting
  of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway to build redox potential (dark
  green arrows). In the first of these major metabolic alterations (light green arrows),
  PI3 K activates Akt, which stimulates aerobic glycolysis and enhances transcription
  factor expression including hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) through the action
  of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Expression of transcription factors
  including HIF1 and Oct 1 further drives a proglycolytic state by enhancing the activity
  of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, which shunt pyruvate back towards
  glycolysis and away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In the second

  cytosolic dimeric pyruvate kinase M2 functionally negatively regulates glycolysis,
  shunting free carbons back toward macromolecular biosynthesis, which supports cell
  proliferation. In the third major metabolic alteration, PKM2-mediated regulation
  of glycolysis also shunts glycolytic intermediates toward alternative carbon-consuming
  pathways (dark green arrows) including the pentose phosphate and hexosamine pathways,
