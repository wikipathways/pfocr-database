caption: 'Targeted therapy pathways.Notes: Protein kinase B (AKT) is a serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinase that affects glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription
  and cell migration. Together, RAS, c-RAF, MEK 1/2, RAS, and ERK 1/2 comprise the
  MAPK–ERK pathway, which is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal
  from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell;
  it is also known as the “Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK pathway.” Janus kinase (JAK) is a family
  of intracellular, non-receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated
  signals via the JAK–STAT pathway. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is an important
  signaling pathway for growth control, metabolism, and translation initiation. The
  active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP).Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; MTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; STAT, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription.'
