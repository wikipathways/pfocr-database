caption: The biogenesis and function of ribosomal RNA-derived fragments. (1) QDE-2-interacting
  small RNAs (QiRNA)/ribosomal RNA-derived fragment (rRF) pathway discovered in fungi
  (Neurospora crassa) [], and recently found in plants, flies, and mammals [,,,].
  These rRFs originate from ribosomal DNA (rDNA) after DNA damage, which is detected
  by OsRecQ1 (RecQ DNA helicase homologue/QDE-3). This leads to recruitment of OsRDR1
  (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] homologue/QDE-1) at the single-stranded DNA
  (ssDNA) site, production of aberrant RNA (aRNA) from ssDNA, and conversion of the
  aRNA into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) via its RdRp activity. Dicer processes the
  dsRNA substrate into qiRNA rRFs, which then serves as guide RNA to repress messenger
  RNA (mRNA) translation. (2) Native ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) harbor microRNA (miRNA)
  sequences, which may be generated under specific conditions (e.g., stress). These
  miRNAs may be located in internal transcribed spacer (ITS1), as hsa-miRNA-663 in
  humans [], or in ITS2, as mmu-miRNA-712 in mice []. In Opium poppy, two and three
  miRNAs are present in the 18S and 28S rRNAs, respectively []. These miRNAs/rRFs
  follow the noncanonical miRNA pathway and repress translation of its mRNA targets.
  For example, in mice, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) mRNA is repressed
  by mmu-miR-712. TIMP3 being an inhibitor of MMP2/9 (matrix metalloproteinase-2/9)
  and of ADAM 10/12 (disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10/12) expression [], its repression
  induces endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis. (3) In the phased small interfering
  RNAs (phasiRNA)/rRF pathway, the large subunit (LSU) loci of rDNA are transcribed
  into phasiRNA precursors (pre-phasiRNAs). A miRNA incorporated into Ago1 (or 7 or
  10) effector complexes guides endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-phasiRNA [], generating
  two rRFs, one of which acts as an RDR6 template, leading to the production of dsRNA.
  DCL4 processes the dsRNA, and produces phasiRNAs that are methylated (Met) by HEN1
  []. Once incorporated into Ago1-loaded RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), phasiRNAs/rRFs
  (21 nt) guide cleavage of homologous mRNAs [], illustrating the importance and biological
  significance of rRFs. (4) In the P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI)–piRNA/rRF
  pathway, some piRNA/rRF precursors are produced from rDNA. In the primary processing
  pathway, piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) precursor are transcribed, exported to the
  cytoplasm, processed by Zuc and methylated by the methyltransferase Hen1 []. The
  resulting mature piRNAs are selected and loaded onto MILI (piwi-like protein 2,
  or PIWIL2) protein (in mouse, PIWI or AUB [aubergine] in Drosophila), which can
  enter the secondary processing pathway (the ping-pong cycle). MILI-piRNA/rRF complexes
  mediate cleavage of piRNA precursors and transposon (and protein-coding) transcripts,
  which silences transposon and gene expression at the post-transcriptional level
  []. These cleavage products are then loaded onto MIWI proteins (in mouse, Ago3 in
  Drosophila), which share functional features with MILI-piRNA/rRF complexes. The
  piRNA biogenesis pathways are well conserved across species, such as C. elegans,
  fish, and mouse. MILI/PIWI–piRNA complexes are involved in translational regulation
  by interacting with polysomes [], mRNA cap-binding complex (CBC, in mice), and mRNA
  deadenylase (DeA, in Drosophila) []. MILI/PIWI proteins and piRNAs regulate the
  expression of genes and transposons at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  levels. EMS, ethyl methanesulfate; UV, ultraviolet.
