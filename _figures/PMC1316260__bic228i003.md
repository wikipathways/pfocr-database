caption: Upon ligand binding, RTK autophosphorylates (phosphates are shown as red
  circles) on tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for adaptor and signalling
  molecules. Ras and Rap1 are activated by the recruitment of guanosine-nucleotide
  exchange factors (SOS, C3G) via adaptor proteins (Shc and Grb2; Crk). Ras can activate
  Raf-1 and B-Raf; Rap1 presumably can activate B-Raf. Raf proteins phosphorylate
  and activate MEK-1/2, which in turn activate ERK-1/2 (indicated by black arrows).
  Negative-feedback loops (indicated by red lines) include the induction of MKPs by
  ERK as well as the inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1 and SOS.
