caption: 'A. Pathogens: Figure depicts age-associated changes in signaling mechanisms
  leading to increased cytokine secretion in response to pathogens and decreased phagocytosis
  and migration of DCs. Increased basal expression of PTEN results in inhibition of
  activation of AKT kinase of PI3kinase signaling pathway. Reduced AKT phosphorylation
  functions as a positive regulator for TLR signaling leading to increased activation
  of p38 MAP kinase and NFκB which in turn result in increased proinflammatory cytokine
  secretion and inflammation. Reduced activation of AKT however inhibits phagocytosis
  and migration of DCs. B. Self Antigens: Figure depicts age-associated changes in
  signaling mechanisms leading to increased reactivity of DCs to self- antigens such
  as DNA. Increased basal level activation of NFκB leads to semi-maturation of DCs
  which results in enhanced response to self antigens and subsequent inflammation.'
