caption: 'CK2-centered functional association network represented with the database
  STRING v10.0. (A) The network shows the top 50 human genes related to CK2 subunits
  CSNK2A1, CSNK2A2, and CSNK2B (number of nodes and edges: 53 and 369, respectively)
  based on neighborhood, experiments, text mining, and database sources. Briefly,
  the human CK2 subunits were searched in STRING by gene name using the multiple protein
  search functionality. The functional association network was then retrieved by selecting
  50 as the maximum number of interactors to show from the first shell (step 1) and
  checking the mentioned interaction sources (these options are found within the “data
  settings” drop down menu); (B) A clone of network A with the red nodes representing
  proteins connected to deregulated pathways (KEGG pathway: hsa05200); (C) A network
  representation of the map: Pathways in cancer (KEGG pathway: hsa05200). The map
  was downloaded from the KEGG PATHWAY [] database (accessed 30 November 2016) and
  imported to Cytoscape with the CyKEGGParser v1.2.7 plugin []. A high-resolution
  image of this figure is also available in the .'
