caption: Molecular mechanisms of eCB-STD. When a large Ca2+ elevation is caused by
  activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or NMDARs, 2-AG is generated in a DGLα-dependent
  manner (a, CaER). A key enzyme of this pathway, which is expected to be activated
  by Ca2+ elevation and produce diacylglycerol, is not identified. When PLCβ is stimulated
  by activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, diacylglycerol is generated and converted
  to 2-AG by DGLα (b, RER). When subthreshold activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors
  is combined with a small Ca2+ elevation, 2-AG is produced through PLCβ-dependent
  pathway because the receptor-driven PLCβ stimulation is Ca2+-dependent (c, Ca2+-assisted
  RER). 2-AG is released from postsynaptic neurons, activates presynaptic CB1R, and
  induces transient suppression of transmitter release. (Reproduced with modification
