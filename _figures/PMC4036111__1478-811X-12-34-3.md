caption: Schematic of the FGFR signaling pathway. Based on published surface plasmon
  resonance data, we assume that FGF binds first to HSGAG before it binds to the receptor.
  The Ras-Raf signaling cascade is reduced to a two-step cascade to increase model
  identifiability. The model also accounts for negative feedback from pERK to FRS2
  and nuclear localization of pERK.
