caption: TGF-beta signaling highlighted in KEGG pathway analysis in parallel with
  SPIA pathway analysis by using microarray result of SNU-2414 set. Genes that were
  upregulated more than two-fold were highlighted in red in KEGG diagram and the list
  from SPIA pathway. Genes that were downregulated more than two-fold were highlighted
  in blue in KEGG diagram and the list from SPIA pathway. Genes that were up- or downregulated
  more than 1.5-fold were highlighted in purple in KEGG diagram.
