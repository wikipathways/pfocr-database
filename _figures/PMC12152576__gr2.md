caption: 'Type- I IFN signalling pathway IFNα/β binding activates the type-I IFN signalling
  pathway via receptor dimerization which subsequently recruits and phosphorylates
  JAK1 and TYK2, which in turn activate the STAT proteins including STAT1/2/3 and
  IRF transcription factors such as IRF3/7/9. The phosphorylated IRF/STAT complex
  enters the nucleus where it binds to response elements on DNA to upregulate gene
  transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and interferon-regulated
  genes. cGAS-STING: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes. IFN:
  Interferon. IRF: Interferon regulatory factor. ISRE: Interferon stimulated response
  element. JAK-STAT: Janus-associated kinase and signal transducer and activator of
  transcription'
