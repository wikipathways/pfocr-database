caption: The binding of TRAIL to TRAILR2 may induce the apoptosis of osteoclast. Increased
  c-FLIP levels may decrease the apoptosis of Osteoclast. The osteoclast apoptosis
  signal transduced by TRAIL/TRAILR2 was transformed to activate NF-κB. A key step
  in downstream signaling of RANKL/RANK is binding of TRAFs to RANK. Stimulation of
  RANK also results in strong NF-κB activation. NF-κB1(p50) is an important signal
  for osteoclast development and osteoclast function.
