caption: Working model of beneficial microorganism-mediated ISRIn the next stage,
  there are still some problems to be solved. More microbial germplasm resources with
  biocontrol potential remains to be discovered; the formulation and shelf life of
  bacteria need to be improved; mining and identification of new antibacterial substances
  and analysis of their biosynthesis pathway, research on the genetic regulatory network
  of biosynthesis and microbial metabolites, and its application, based on genetic
  modification, are also interesting topics. Efficient and stable RNAi technology
  requires mastering the proper design and synthesis of dsRNA. The screening carriers
  of dsRNA are also indispensable to develop and improve the application of RNAi technology
  in plant disease control.
