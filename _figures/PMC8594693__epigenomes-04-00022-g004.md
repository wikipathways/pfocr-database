caption: dsRNA sensing. dsRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm as a result of retrotransposon
  transcription. These dsRNAs can be edited by ADAR1 or recognized by MDA5 and RIG-1
  that activate and nucleate self-assembly of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein (MAVS). This will result in the activation of interferon regulatory transcription
  factors (IRFs) that activate the expression of interferons (IFNs) type I and III.
  These IFNs will bind to their receptors in an autocrine or paracrine fashion and
  induce the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) by activating the JAK/STAT
  pathway. ISGs are typically involved in apoptosis, antigen processing, and presentation
  and chemotaxis of immune cells.
