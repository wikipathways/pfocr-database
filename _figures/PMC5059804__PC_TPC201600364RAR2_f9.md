caption: Proposed Model for the Enhanced Degradation of PP2CA via the 26S Proteasome
  Mediated by  and RGLG1/5.Under nonstress conditions (top, low  levels), RGLG1 and
  RGLG5 show less interaction with PP2CA (dashed arrow) or there is less PP2CA available
  for interaction because PP2CA transcripts are upregulated by . PP2CA interacts with
  SnRK2s, which prevents their activation and leads to the inhibition of downstream  responses.
  PP2Cs themselves also inhibit downstream targets such as TFs and SLAC1. PP2CA levels
  under nonstress conditions are regulated by RGLG1/5 or additional unidentified E3s.
  When plants are challenged (bottom, high  levels),  promotes the interaction of
  PYR/PYLs with PP2CA, inhibiting its phosphatase activity.  facilitates RGLG1/5 interaction
  with PP2CA, which leads to enhanced ubiquitination and degradation via the 26S proteasome
  pathway, resulting in full activation of  signaling. As a negative feedback mechanism,  also
  increases PP2CA and clade A PP2C transcripts. See main text for additional details.
