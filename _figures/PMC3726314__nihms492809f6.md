caption: Two pathways are involved referring as TLR4-MyD88 pathway and TLR4-TRIF pathway.
  Upon binding to endogenous activators (e.g., oxidized phospholipids, high mobility
  group box1, fragmented hyaluronan, heat shock proteins), the adaptor molecule MyD88,
  which is associated with TIRAP, is recruited to the TLR4 complex. Binding of MyD88
  promotes association with IRAKs and TRAF6. The complex IRAKs/TRAF6 dissociates from
  the receptor and then interacts with another complex,TAK1. TAK1 results in phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκBα, consequent release of NF-κB, translocation of NF-κB into
  the nucleus, and transcription of pro-inflammatory genes inducing cytokine production.
  In the meantime, TAK1 also leads to activation of MAPK such as ERK that activates
  AP-1 transcription factor, which induces the transcription of inflammatory cytokines.
  In addition to MyD88, other adaptor proteins such as TRIF, which is associated with
  TRAM, mediate induction of IRF3, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα, leading to release
  of NF-κB to the nucleus. Unregulated proinflammatory cytokines may predispose VILI.
  TLR4 = Toll/interleukin-1 like receptor 4; MyD88 = myeloid differentiation factor
  88; TIRAP = Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein;
  TRIF = Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta;
  TRAM = TRIF-related adaptor molecule; RIP1 = receptor interacting protein-1; IRAKs
  = interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinases; IRF3 = interferon regulatory factor
  3; TRAF6 = tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6; TAK1 = transforming
  growth factor activated kinase 1; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK
  = extracellular signal-regulated kinases; AP1 = activator protein 1; IκBα = inhibitor
  of κB alpha; VILI = ventilator-induced lung injury.
