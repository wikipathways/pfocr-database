caption: 'Summary: cholesterol homeostasis pathways in astrocytes and glioma cells.
  (A) At high plating density, normal astrocytes lower cholesterol levels compared
  to sparsely plated cells by both increasing ABCA1 (Figure ) and by decreasing de
  novo synthesis through the mevalonate pathway. The factors that activate ABCA1 in
  dense normal astrocytes are not defined, but might involve inhibition of FAK. (B)
  Glioma tumor initiating cells at high density keep cholesterol levels equivalent
  to sparse through the net effects of multiple feedback loops. Unlike normal astrocytes,
  they generate new cholesterol by keeping the mevalonate pathway on. This cholesterol
  in turn is oxidized to oxysterols (Fig. ), which act as activating ligands for LXR.
  Activation of LXR then in turn keeps cholesterol levels in check (Fig. ) by increasing
  cholesterol efflux via upregulating ABCA1 RNA and protein (Figs  and ) and through
  inhibition of the mevalonate pathway (Fig. ). This enables the cells to survive
  and proliferate under conditions in which normal astrocytes cells are contact inhibited
  (Fig.  and ref.). (C) In the absence of LXR, intracellular cholesterol levels are
  high (Fig. ), likely due to low ABCA1 levels (Fig. ) and increased activity in the
  mevalonate pathway (Fig. ). This leads to decreased cell proliferation and viability,
  possibly due to toxic levels of cholesterol and/or oxysterols (Fig. ). (D) In the
  absence of ABCA1, net cholesterol levels are equivalent in sparse and dense cells
  and the glioma cells continue to proliferate and are viable at high density (Fig. ).
  While decreased ABCA1 should result in an accumulation of cholesterol due to decreased
  efflux, cholesterol is maintained at levels compatible with cell viability through
  feedback inhibition of the mevalonate pathway (Fig. ), possibly through increased
  LXR activation by accumulated oxysterols, or though feedback inhibition of transcription
  factors such as SREBP.'
