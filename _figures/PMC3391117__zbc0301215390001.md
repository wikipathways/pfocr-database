caption: α-Glucosidase-catalyzed reactions (A, B, E, and F), conversion of AF under
  aqueous condition (C), combined reaction of GL and DG (D), and structure of ethyl
  α-glucoside (G). A, 31AG-catalyzed hydrolytic reaction on p-nitrophenyl 2-deoxyglucoside
  to form α-2dGlc and p-nitrophenol (pNP) (). B, 31AG-catalyzed trans-addition to
  GlcAL (, ). In water (R=H), 31AG produces α-2dGlc with newly formed axial proton
  (shown by italic boldfaced H). Alkyl alcohol (R=alkyl) is also used to form alkyl
  α-2-deoxyglucoside (). C, tautomerization of AF (–). D, GL produces 1,2-enol AF
  from starch followed by conversion to α-glucose with DG. E, α-glucosidase-catalyzed
  trans-addition on 1,2-enol AF. F, ANG-catalyzed 1-alcohoxy-2-hydro addition to 1,2-enol
  AF; G, the TLC-isolated product from an ANG-mediated reaction on AF and 80% ethanol
  was determined to be an ethyl α-glucoside by MS and NMR analyses.
