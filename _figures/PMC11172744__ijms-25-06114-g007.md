caption: After TCR stimulation, two signaling pathways are induced via 3,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP3-dependent pathway leads to Ca2+ release
  into the cytosol, activating NF-AT. The DAG-dependent pathway activates PKCθ and
  induces an oxidative signal via Complex I and III of the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC). Additionally, the MAPK signaling pathway is induced via PKCθ.
  The oxidative signal originating from mitochondrial ETC amplifies the MAPK signaling
  pathway and activates the redox-sensitive transcription factors AP1, NF-κB, and
  Nrf2. AP1 and NF-κB, together with NF-AT, create the minimal requirement for T cell
  activation. Conversely, Nrf2, by inducing antioxidant proteins, contributes to the
  control and potential termination of the oxidative signal. The figure was created
  with BioRender.com Oxidative signals in T cells are essential for the initiation
  of a T cell immune response. Several publications and data have addressed the induction
  of oxidative signals by TCR stimulation and the mechanisms by which these signals
  are generated. However, the role of co-stimulation in oxidative signaling is not
  well understood. This represents a knowledge gap that urgently needs to be investigated
  in detail
