caption: The canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor kappaB pathways. In the canonical
  nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) pathway, activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) results
  in a shift of the transcription factors c-Rel, p65 and p50 to the nucleus if not
  sequestered by IKB. In the non-anonical pathway, activation of MAP3K14 results in
  proteolytic cleavage of p100 to p52, which as a heterodimer with Rel-B serves as
  a transcription regulator. BIRC3, which is part of the negative regulatory complex,
  induces proteosomal degradation of MAP3K14, the major driver of activation of the
  non-canonical NFκB pathway.
