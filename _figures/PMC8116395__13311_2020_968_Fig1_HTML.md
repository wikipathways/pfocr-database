caption: 'Canonical Wnt signaling pathway and activators. (a) Wnt proteins are cysteine-rich
  glycolipoproteins that act as ligands to receptors of the Wnt pathway. When Wnt
  is bound to the Frizzled receptor and its coreceptors, such as lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP), cytoplasmic disheveled (Dsh) protein is recruited and activated.
  Dsh regulates the inactivation of the destruction complex. This allows for β-catenin
  to be released from the destruction complex. Stabilized β-catenin can then enter
  the nucleus, displace Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) (not shown)
  and activate the transcription of Wnt target genes. (b) In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin
  is degraded by the destruction complex that includes molecules such as glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α), adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC), and axin. The destruction complex phosphorylates β-catenin and facilitates
  ubiquitination by β-TrCP, leading to β-catenin’s proteosomal degradation. Dsh =
  disheveled; GSK-3β = glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; APC = adenomatosis polyposis
  coli; LRP = lipoprotein receptor-related proteins; β-TrCP = beta-transducin repeats-containing
  proteins; SSRI’s = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; VA = valproic acid.
  Activators of the Wnt pathway: Lithium inhibits GSK-3β and therefore activates the
  Wnt pathway. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and valproic acid (VA)
  act by stimulating the expression of Wnt-targeted genes'
