caption: Integrating multiomics analysis. (A) The bubble plot of KEGG analysis. Each
  bubble in the figure represents a KEGG pathway. The horizontal axis indicates the
  relative importance of metabolites in the pathway, and the vertical axis indicates
  the statistical significance of metabolites in the pathway. (B) Metabolic pathway
  map of phenylalanine metabolism. The metabolites shown in red are the differential
  metabolites that are highly expressed in the DKD ESRD group. Other related metabolic
  pathways were expressed in solid wire frame. (C) Metabolic pathway map of tryptophan
  metabolism. The metabolites expressed in red and green were statistically different
  between the two groups. Red metabolites express upregulated in the DKD ESRD group;
  green metabolites express downregulated in the DKD ESRD group. Other related metabolic
  pathways were expressed in solid wire frame. (D) Correlation analysis between different
  metabolites in enrichment pathway and clinical indicators.
