caption: Overview on cell cycle regulators' modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and
  the endolysosomal pathway during the cell cycle. At the G1 phase, mitochondria are
  interconnected, and then evolve to a giant hyperfused network when reaching the
  G1‐to‐S phase transition. This profusion activity is accomplished by APC/C, causing
  DRP1’s proteasomal degradation. However, the canonical CDK4/6‐cyclin D axis allows
  the build‐up of cyclin E. Then, it binds CDK2 inhibiting APC/C and restoring the
  fusion/fission balance. In parallel, CDK4 also targets GCN5 to inhibit mitochondrial
  biogenesis via PGC‐1α during G1 phase. The mitotic Aurora A kinase activates CDK1/5‐cyclin
  B, which, in turn, cause massive mitochondrial fission thanks to DRP1 function.
  Additionally, CDK5 also regulates the recycling endosomal trafficking (see text).
  Cell cycle regulators, such as CDK4, also participate in the activities of master
  metabolic regulators, including mTORC1 through FLCN phosphorylation which contributes
  to lysosomal functionality. Moreover, CDK4 can regulate AMPK activation. Active
  AMPK can promote the endocytosis of the Na/K‐ATPase or promote glucose uptake by
  inhibiting the endocytosis of GLUTs mediated by clathrin and its adaptor protein
  TXNIP.
