caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) exerts beneficial effects on CVDs
  by regulating metabolism, maintaining redox homeostasis and modulating immune responses.
  The NAD+ coenzyme is reduced to NADH during glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation and
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. NAD+ can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through
  the SIRT1/PGC1α pathway and enhance autophagy through the SIRT1/AMPK/HIF pathway.
  These effects of NAD+ in metabolism contribute to its invention potential for CVDs
  treatment. The balance of NAD+ and NADH is a key component of the redox state of
  a cell. NAD+ can exert antioxidant effects by activating SIRTs to regulate FOXOs,
  NRF2, SOD and GSH, thus countering oxidative stress in CVDs. NAD+ can also suppress
  the central immune pathway and regulate T-cell homeostasis to exert immunomodulatory
  effects, which might be beneficial as a treatment of CVDs. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; CVDs, cardiovascular diseases; FOXOs, class O of forkhead box family;
  GSH, glutathione; HIF, hypoxia inducible factors; NRF2, nuclear factor E2-related
  factor 2; PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator
  1α; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
