caption: Raf activation signals through MEK/ERK pathway and Rb pathway. Activation
  of ERK leads to induction of CDK4/cyclin D activity and Rb phosphorylation. Raf-1
  also binds and phosphorylates Rb leading to dissociation of E2F, and expression
  of genes involved in cell cycle progression, angiogenesis and tumor growth. Treatment
  with RRD-251 disrupts RB-Raf-1 interaction and prevents Rb phosphorylation and inhibits
  E2F-mediated transcription of S-phase genes.
