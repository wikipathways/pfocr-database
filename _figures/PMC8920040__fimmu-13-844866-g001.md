caption: MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. MHC-I presents endogenously
  derived peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells. Cytosolic proteins are degraded by the
  proteasome into peptides. These peptides are then shuttled into the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) by TAP transporter proteins. Antigen peptides are then loaded into
  the assembled MHC-I α-heavy chain and beta-2-microglobulin (β2M) complex and shuttled
  via the Golgi to the cell surface. Acquired mutations in the antigen presentation
  pathway drive loss of MHC-I.
