caption: Modular composition of the SGOCP. (A) Scheme of the multimodular composition
  of the SGOCP, indicating its main inputs (orange) and outputs (blue) of the metabolic
  network. (B) Glycolysis and de novo serine synthesis modules coupled to the folate
  cycle. (C) Cytosolic and mitochondrial folate cycles, showing interconnected metabolites
  and main flux direction in cancer cells. The schematic also shows the transport
  of serine to the mitochondria through SFXN1. (D) One-carbon cycles showing the entry
  of one-carbon units from serine, the remethylation of homocysteine by methionine
  synthase and BHMT, and the generation of SAM.
