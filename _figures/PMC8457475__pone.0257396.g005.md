caption: Reduced risk of exacerbation might be due to the down regulation of LTA4H
  activity, stimulating a montelukast sensitive pathway triggering exacerbation. rs2660845
  AA genotype would result in a comparatively reduced LTA4H expression, leading to
  lowered LTB4 concentrations and so reducing exacerbation triggered by BLT receptors.
  Furthermore, LTA4 would be more readily converted into LTC4, unable to bind to CysLT1
  receptors already blocked by montelukast.
