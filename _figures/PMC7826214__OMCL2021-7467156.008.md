caption: Schematic illustration of the signaling pathway involved in the effect of
  CAT on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in vitro. CAT activated AMPK activity and
  improved mitochondrial function, decreased cellular ROS generation, and increased
  ATP production, leading to reduced inflammation and apoptosis as well as activation
  of mitophagy, which ultimately protected against cisplatin-induced injury.
