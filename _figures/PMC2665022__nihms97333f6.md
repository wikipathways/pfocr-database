caption: Amino acid oxidation is a central part of energy metabolism. The oxidation
  of proline, in particular, is increasingly being recognized as critical for cellular
  redox control, apoptosis and suppression of cancer (–). Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH)
  is the first of two enzymes of the proline catabolic pathway (). It catalyzes the
  FAD-dependent oxidation of proline () to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C, 2). The
  cyclic imine P5C is hydrolyzed nonenzymatically to glutamate semialdehyde (), which
  is subsequently oxidized to glutamate () by P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH). PRODH and
  P5CDH are separate monofunctional enzymes encoded by distinct genes in eukaryotes
  and some bacteria, whereas they are combined into a single bifunctional enzyme called
  proline utilization A (PutA) in other bacteria. Inborn errors in proline oxidation
  enzymes lead to hyperprolinemia disorders (), and deficiencies in PRODH have been
  linked to increased susceptibility to schizophrenia (–).
