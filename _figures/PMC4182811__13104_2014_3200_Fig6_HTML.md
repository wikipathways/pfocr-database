caption: Chronic metformin treatment results in increased plasma levels of purine
  metabolites. Male HFD DIO C57BL/6 mice (21 weeks old, 17 weeks on HFD) were fed
  using control HFD, HFD formulated with 200 mg/kg R118, or HFD formulated with 5 g/kg
  metformin (n = 12/group). After five weeks of treatment, liver, skeletal muscle,
  adipose tissue, and plasma were collected for half of the mice in each group (max
  cmp). For the remaining mice, compound-formulated HFD was replaced with control
  HFD for 24 hours (washout), followed by similar sample collection. Detected changes
  in plasma purine metabolites for both R118 and metformin-treated mice are shown
  relative to control HFD in heatmap format, along with a schematic illustrating the
  purine catabolism pathway. Intermediates highlighted using red boxes are significantly
  elevated in metformin washout samples.
