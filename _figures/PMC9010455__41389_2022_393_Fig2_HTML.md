caption: Orange and blue shapes represent predicted activation or inhibition, respectively.
  The predicted relationship between genes may lead to direct activation (orange solid
  lines) or direct inhibition (blue solid lines). Red and green color indicate genes,
  proteins, and metabolites increased and decreased in expression, respectively, while
  the numbers represent the measurements of their expression. A1 shows the proteins
  and metabolites of the loaded dataset involved in the activation of the upstream
  regulator Interferon alpha. A2 shows the mechanistic network, theoretically reconstructed
  that underlies the activation of the upstream Interferon alpha. B1 shows the proteins
  and metabolites of the loaded dataset involved in the activation of the upstream
  regulator Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7). B2 shows the mechanistic network, theoretically
  reconstructed that underlies the activation of the upstream FGF7. C1 shows the proteins
  and metabolites of the loaded dataset involved in the activation of the upstream
  regulator Insulin (INS). C2 shows the mechanistic network, theoretically reconstructed
  that underlies the activation of the upstream INS. D shows the proteins and metabolites
  of the loaded dataset involved in the down-regulation of the upstream regulator
  Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5).
