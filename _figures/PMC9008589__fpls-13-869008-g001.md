caption: Graphic representation of the events underlying synthesis and accumulation
  of storage proteins in developing seeds, and cross-talk with the UPR. During seed
  development, massive storage proteins synthesis drives significant developmental
  changes in cotyledonary or endorspermal cells, transforming them in professional
  secretory cells. Seed storage proteins (SSPs) are cotranslationally inserted into
  the ER—SSP SYNTHESIS, where they undergo oxidative folding assisted by ER chaperones
  and enzymes—FOLDING. BiP (green) plays a major role in the folding process, masking
  hydrophobic regions in the unfolded SSPs, avoiding their aggregation, and guiding
  folding toward the correct conformation—BiP BINDING. Structure and final localization
  of each SSP determine its affinity for BiP and binding extent in time. Other co-chaperones,
  such as ERdjs, PDIs, ER lectins (not shown in the cartoon), assist and support folding
  in a protein-specific manner. Correct folding frees SSP monomers from BiP. In multimeric
  SSPs, the assembly process—ASSEMBLY—is also needed to displace BiP—BiP RELEASE.
  Trimeric globulins (blue polypeptides), such as phaseolin, rapidly assemble and
  enter traffic to the protein storage vacuoles (PSV)—TRAFFIC TO PSVs. Zein prolamins
  (brown, orange, and yellow polypeptides) form very large heteropolymers—ER-DERIVED
  PBs—that may require long time to assembly correctly and do not enter traffic. Biogenesis
  of prolamin PBs is therefore a process that challenges the ER machinery to a greater
  extent. When folding fails—UNFOLDING/MISFOLDING—SSPs which have not passed the ER
  quality control are degraded by ER-associated degradation—ERAD—or by AUTOPHAGY.
  Degradation of misfolded proteins provides amino acids to be immediately recycled
  into newly synthesized SSPs. Binding of BiP to the ER stress sensors IRE1 and bZIP28
  links the folding process to the unfolded protein response—UPR INDUCTION. When the
  folding demand exceeds the ER capacity, the two sensors freed from BiP, activate
  the UPR pathway, that results in increasing the ER folding as well as ERAD and autophagic
  machineries. Selective regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) of SSP transcripts
  possibly also occurs to avoid ER overloading. Notice that anticipatory UPR (see
  main text) is not illustrated, since its signaling in seeds is not defined.
