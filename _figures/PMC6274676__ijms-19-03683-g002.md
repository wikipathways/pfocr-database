caption: Fold change (log2[−P/+P]) of secondary metabolites and metabolic genes in
  response to P starvation. Fengqing (left column) and Longjing-43 (right column)
  and from the top to the bottom rows are young shoots (first row), leaves (middle
  row) and root (button row). YS, L and R represents young shoots, leaves, and root,
  respectively. Metabolites and metabolic genes inside background color box represents
  different biosynthesis pathway. The solid arrow shows direct and dotted arrow represents
  speculated steps in the pathway. The data depicted from  and Table 5, positive as
  increase and negative as decrease in fold change. On the false color scale red indicates
  increase; blue and green indicates decrease in metabolites and gene. ANR, anthocyanin
  reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; UGT57L12, flavanol 7-O glycosyltransferase;
  UGT78D2, flavanol 3-O-glucosyltransferase 2; UGT78D1, flavanol 3-O-glycoside L-rhamnosyl
  transferase 1.
