caption: Il-2 pathway in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) (left box) and
  observed effects of IL-2/rapamycin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes (right
  box). Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is conferred by numerous genes including
  the IL-2 receptor α (CD25) gene. Tregs in subjects with type 1 diabetes–susceptible
  alleles express less CD25 (yellow triangles) than those from subjects with protective
  alleles (). Moreover, Tregs from patients with type 1 diabetes are less responsive
  to IL-2 (purple stars) with lower FOXP3 expression and less STAT5 signaling than
  Tregs from control subjects (). During IL-2/rapamycin treatment (), IL-2 increased
  the number of circulating Tregs and led to a rescue of their IL-2 responsiveness
  in patients. This is presumed to prevent loss of β-cells and increase β-cell survival
  and function (upper part of the right box). However, treatment also expanded other
  CD25 bearing cells of innate immunity such as eosinophils (Eos) and natural killer
  (NK) cells and this is presumed to be responsible for the marked impairment in β-cell
  function observed in the study (lower part of the right box).
