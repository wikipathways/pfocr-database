caption: Various intracellular signaling molecules and pathways involved in HSCR.
  Including receptors like RET, ENDRB; signaling proteins such as AKT, ERK; and transcription
  factors like SOX10, PHOX2B. Neurotrophic factors such as GDNF, ARTN, PSPN, and NTF3
  interact with corresponding receptors GFRα1-4 and NTRK. Additionally, pathways like
  the NOTCH signaling pathway, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, as well as other molecules
  (such as SEMA3C and SEMA3D), play significant roles in enteric neurons
