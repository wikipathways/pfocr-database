caption: PPI induces protective autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by inhibiting
  AKT (S473), mTOR (S2448), p70S6K (T389), and 4EBP1 (T37/46) and increasing the conversion
  of LC3I conversion into LC3II. EGF markedly increases the phosphorylation of Akt
  and p70S6K and reverses LC3II, suggesting the autophagy is due to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway. In the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, PPVII inhibits PI3K Akt and mTOR activated
  mTOR (ser2448), total mTOR Raptor, Rictor and GβL in a dose-dependent manner. PPVII
  also increases AMPK phosphorylation, which further inhibits mTOR and induces autophagy
  in HepG-2 cells by modulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. PPG or PPVII induces autophagy
  through the Akt, p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK pathways. PPG or PPVII activates JNK1/2
  and inhibits Akt, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2, which further increase the conversion of
  LC3I to LC3II, P62 degradation, and formation of LC3-positive structures or LC3
  puncta. Furthermore, PPVII treatment decreases the level of total Bcl-2 decreases
  but increases those of p-Bcl-2 and Beclin. The AKT inhibitor (LY294002) and JNK1/2
  inhibitor (SP600125) increase, suggesting that PPG induces autophagy via the Akt,
  p38 MAPK, and JNK1/2 pathways. Moreover, LY294002, U0126, and SP600125 significantly
  attenuate PG-induced LC3-II activation, suggesting that the activation of ERK1/2
  and JNK1/2 is involved in PG-induced autophagy.
