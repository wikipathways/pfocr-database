caption: A model for PacC subcellular trafficking in response to ambient pH. Newly
  synthesized PacC adopts a protease-inaccessible, closed conformation, which is unable
  to enter into the nucleus. When the growth environment is alkaline, a signal is
  transmitted by the pal gene pathway. Reception of this signal by PacC switches the
  protein to an open conformation, in which PacC is accessible to proteolytic processing.
  We favor a model in which processing takes place exclusively in the cytosolic compartment
  (see text). The processed protein would be transported into the nucleus, where it
  activates expression of alkaline genes and represses that of acidic genes. A fraction
  of full-length PacC, most likely representing protein in the open conformation which
  escapes processing, is able to enter the nucleus. Because definitive evidence for
  the cytosolic localization of PacC processing is lacking, the possibility of nuclear
  processing is indicated by a question mark. However, we note that quick transfer
  into the nucleus of unprocessed polypeptides in the open conformation would protect
  them from processing if this were exclusively cytosolic, which would explain why,
  even with the most extreme C-terminally truncating pacCc alleles under alkaline
  growth conditions, a fraction of the full-length product appears unprocessed.

  description: A model for PacC subcellular trafficking in response to ambient pH.
    Newly synthesized PacC adopts a protease-inaccessible, closed conformation, which
    is unable to enter into the nucleus. When the growth environment is alkaline,
    a signal is transmitted by the pal gene pathway. Reception of this signal by PacC
    switches the protein to an open conformation, in which PacC is accessible to proteolytic

    in the open conformation which escapes processing, is able to enter the nucleus.
    Because definitive evidence for the cytosolic localization of PacC processing
    is lacking, the possibility of nuclear processing is indicated by a question mark.
