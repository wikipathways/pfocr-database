caption: Tryptophan metabolism pathways in differentially abundant genera in gut microbiome
  of patients suffering from neurological diseases and healthy individuals. Each panel
  corresponds to a set of microbiome data obtained from patients of a neurological
  disease and matched healthy individuals. The genera differentially enriched in diseased
  cohorts have been shown with orange bars, while those differentially abundant in
  healthy cohorts have been shown with cyan bars. The pathways that have been predicted
  in differentially abundant genera in diseased or healthy individuals have been represented
  by Sankey diagrams. The width of the pathway-genus association represents the “SCORBPEO”
  value of the genus for the respective pathway.
