caption: The pathogenesis mechanism based on the activation of p38 MAPK signal pathway
  and the therapeutic effect of TAK715. Briefly, the extrinsic or intrinsic reasons
  produced fibrogenic stimuli and the stimuli triggered synovium fibroblast apoptosis
  and recruited macrophage infiltration. At the initial pathogenesis phase, the osteoclast
  was also activated. In this stage, the patients suffered from pain, stiffness and
  bone loss. Under the cessation of fibrogenic stimuli and consistent cell apoptosis,
  the ECM secreting is stopped and degraded. The FS comes into thawing phase. Holistically,
  the TAK715 could correct the fibrosis and local osteoporosis to accelerate the rehabilitation.
