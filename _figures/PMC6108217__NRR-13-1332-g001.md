caption: 'Proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of noradrenaline/β2-adrenoceptor
  (β2-AR) agonists on nigral microglia in the inflamed substantia nigra; a molecular
  signalling pathway towards neuroprotection.Stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  receptors on microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers a signalling cascade
  which leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of nuclear factor
  of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor α (IκBα), nuclear
  factor-κB (NfκB) nuclear translocation and ensuing increases in pro-inflammatory
  gene expression. In the current schematic, stimulation of the β2-AR with endogenous
  noradrenergic (NA) or with a β2-AR agonist (e.g., clenbuterol/formoterol) may suppress
  NfκB transcriptional activity via the following pathway: (1) Stimulation of glial
  β2-ARs activates adenylyl cyclase which raises intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) leading to (2) activation of protein kinase A (PKA) which in turn phosphorylates
  cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and (3) induces de novo synthesis of
  the NfκB inhibitory protein IκBα (and possibly preventing its phosphorylation),
  thus stabilizing cytosolic levels of IκBα which (4) inhibits transcriptional activity
  of NfκB by preventing its translocation into the nucleus, ultimately (5) decreasing
  pro-inflammatory gene expression. TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor-α; IL: interleukin;
  iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase.'
