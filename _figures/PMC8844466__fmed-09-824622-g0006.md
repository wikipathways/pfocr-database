caption: 'ORF8-binding proteins and their interactors in the “Human Papillomavirus
  Infection” pathway. Within the endosome of the host cells, dsRNA from the infected
  RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 triggers the “toll-like receptor signaling pathway”. PVR-interacting
  protein: TRIF (Class 1) and IL17RA-interacting protein TRAF3 (Class 2) are involved
  in this pathway. The host cells respond and produce IFN-β to activate the “inhibition
  of antiviral infection”. Integrin signaling acts as a negative regulator of the
  “toll-like receptor signaling pathway” to regulate the IFN-β-mediate innate immune
  response. PLOD2, COL6A1, LOX, and PVR-interacting proteins: ECM (Class1 and Class
  2), ITGB-1, and PVR-interacting proteins: ITGA (Class 2) and ITGB (Class 2) are
  involved in this integrin pathway. See  for a depiction of the entire pathway. The
  background color indicates the class of the phylogenetic cluster, as shown in .
  The proteins that interact with PLOD2, PVR, ITGB1, or IL17RA are indicated with
  gold, light purple, smoke blue, or brilliant blue text color, respectively. See  for
  detailed information on mapped colors.'
