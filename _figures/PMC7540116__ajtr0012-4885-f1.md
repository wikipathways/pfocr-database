caption: Metformin inhibits cancer invasion and migration via AMPK signaling pathway.
  After uptake by the organic cation transporter (OCT), metformin causes a reduction
  in ATP via inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1, leading
  to activation of AMPK. Similarly, metformin can inhibit mTORC1 by inhibiting IGF-1R.
  Activated AMPK may suppress mTORC1 and change the expression of proteins such as
  P70S6K, FAK and cyclin D1. Also, it can directly inhibit the expression of Hsp90α
  and H3K27me3 protein or inhibit the expression of TIP30 and p53 genes. At the same
  time, metformin-induced AMPK activation can inhibit VEGF and reduce angiogenesis.
  P70S6K, p70 S6 Kinase; FAK, Focal Adhesion Kinase; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor
  1 receptor; Hsp90α, heat shock protein 90α; H3K27me3, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
