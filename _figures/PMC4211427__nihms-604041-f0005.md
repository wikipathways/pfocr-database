caption: a. Primary cilium structure and signaling components. Multiple types of diffusion
  barrier separate the ciliary membrane and apical membrane to control the access
  to the primary cilium, creating a distinct polarized membrane domain Transition
  fibers that connect the basal body to the ciliary membrane blocks vesicle access
  to the cilium, and nuclear pore components are also found in this region and have
  been implicated to function as a diffusion barrier, perhaps functioning as a diffusion
  barrier to the entry and exit of soluble proteins. Patched (Ptc) is inactive in
  the primary cilium, but moves out of this organelle upon binding of Hedgehog (HH)
  (not shown). Other components of the HH signalling cascade, Smoothened (Smo), which
  is located on intracellular vesicles, and Gli, also move in and out of the cilium
  in a dynamic manner, and is recruited to the tip of the cilium by a kinesin. Activation
  of Ptc triggers the translocation of Smo to the ciliary membrane, where it activates
  Gli. After a series of post-translational modifications, GLi moves to the nucleus
  to activate transcription of target genes. b. Transcytosis of HH. HH is produced
  by endothelial or mesenchymal cells underlying epithelial cells. Upon binding of
  HH to its receptor Patched on the surface of the primary cilium, the transcription
  factor Gli is activated and transported to the nucleus to activate epithelial differentiation
  genes. The transcytotic pathway of HH has not yet been characterized.
