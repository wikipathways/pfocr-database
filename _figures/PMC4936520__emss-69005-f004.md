caption: Ligand binding induces recruitment of Imd and dFADD to PGRP-LC. This allows
  binding of DREDD to dFADD, which leads to dimerisation-induced activation of DREDD.
  Active DREDD subsequently cleaves IMD, which leads to the exposure of an IBM at
  the neo-amino terminus of cleaved IMD. This in turn allows recruitment of DIAP2
  into the signalling complex, followed by DIAP2-mediated ubiquitylation of various
  components of this complex, such as IMD and DREDD. Ubiquitylation of DREDD is key
  for DREDD-mediated cleavage of RELISH. The Ub chains of DREDD may serve as a scaffold
  for the recruitment of IKK. Since IKK binds to RELISH, as evidenced by its ability
  to phosphorylate RELISH, IKK might bring RELISH into close proximity of DREDD for
  proteolysis. Ubiquitylation of components of the IMD pathway also leads to activation
  of TAK1 and IKK, which in turn phosphorylates RELISH. (6.) Phosphorylated and cleaved
  RELISH subsequently translocates to the nucleus where it drives expression of RELISH
  target genes.
