caption: Rationale for HMA-based combination strategies in acute myeloid leukemia
  relapsing after allogeneic HSCT. HMAs sensitize blasts to the T cell-mediated immune
  response by upregulation of IFN-pathway genes, increased expression of MHC-1, and
  ERV. The expansion of FOXP3 + T regs mediated by HMAs facilitates GVL preserving
  from GVHD. HMAs also upregulate antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells
  (not pictured). Promoting the modulatory activity of Tregs, AZA greatly reduces
  the risk of severe GVHD and emphasizes GVL; BCL-2 inhibitors restore mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathways and sensitize AML cells to HMAs. AZA may, also, synergize to
  activate BAX pro-apoptotic gene and reduce levels of MCL-1. Sorafenib inhibits FLT3-ITD
  and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. It also increases cell-mediated
  immune response enhancing IL-15 production and INFγ-pathway synergizing with allogeneic
  effective T cells. Lenalidomide increases the activity of T-effectors and the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines; HMAs can reverse the hypermethylation of DNA induced
  by IDH-mutated clones and synergize with the inhibitory activity of IDHi. HMAs and
  IDHi, also, synergistically inhibit MAPK/ERK signaling; HDAC inhibitors, especially
  panobinostat, contribute to the epigenetic modulation and can reinduce the expression
  of TNF receptors on T-regs favoring control over GVHD and an increase in GVL activity.
  HMAs increase the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 representing a possible mechanism
  of resistance to HMAs. PD-1 inhibition can enhance response to DLI and allogeneic
  effective T cell and consequent T cell-mediated tumor lysis. HMAs increase CD33
  expression with consequently increased uptake of GO by AML cells. It also increases
  the expression of Syk and SHP1, which contribute to GO-mediated cytotoxicity by
  inhibiting cell growth. HMAs (mostly AZA) decrease P-glycoprotein expression, which
  contributes to GO resistance (not pictured). HMAs, hypomethylating agents; IDHi,
