caption: Cleavage of amyloid β protein precursor (APP) by β-secretase (β-site of APP
  cleaving enzyme, BACE 1) generates a large β-secreted derivative, sAPPβ, and an
  Aβ-bearing membrane-associated C-terminal derivative, CTFβ, which is subsequently
  cleaved by the second activity, γ-secretase, to release Aβ []. Alternatively, a
  third activity, α-secretase, cleaves APP within Aβ to the secreted derivative sAPPα
  and membrane-associated C-terminal fragment (CTF)α. The predominant secreted APP
  derivative is sAPPα in most cell-types. The receptor sortilin-1 (SORL-1) has direct
  effects on β-APP trafficking, and decreased abundance of SORL-1 is coupled to activation
  of the amyloidogenic pathway from βAPP and the increased generation and secretion
  of Aβ peptides. Most of the secreted Aβ is 40 residues long (Aβ1–40) although a
  small percentage is 42 residues in length (Aβ1–42) []. Aβ1–42 is more prominent
  in amyloid plaques as this isoform is resistant to protease degradation []. Aβ generation
  induces an inflammatory response, which involves the activation of microglia and
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as pointed out by the tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF-α) production []. TNF-α has been implicated as a mediator of the synaptic dysfunction
  that is hypothesized to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD [,]
