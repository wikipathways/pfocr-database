caption: Simplified carotenoid biosynthetic pathway derived from isoprenoid precursors.
  Enzymatic reactions are represented by arrows. Genes encoding all enzymes shown,
  except Z-ISO, were tested for correlation with total accumulated carotenoids. Transcripts
  for enzymes in black letters had no effect; white letters on blue circles and white
  letters on red circles showed positive correlation and negative correlation, respectively.
  G3P, d-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; ME-cPP, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  MEP, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate.
