caption: Insulin stimulates the IR‐Akt pathway activating Akt which phosphorylates
  Afadin at S1795. This allows the docking of HDAC6, which subsequently inhibits IR‐Akt
  signaling through regulation of total IR protein in a deacetylase‐dependent manner.Adipocytes
  lacking Afadin have increased IR availability due to the loss of HDAC6‐mediated
  inhibition, consequently enhancing insulin signaling and action.
