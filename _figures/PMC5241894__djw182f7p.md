caption: Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R)– and mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR)–induced alterations upon the canonical IGF-1R signaling cascade, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and receptor tyrosine kinase RTKs in Ewing sarcoma (ES). Average
  expression of teverse-phase protein lysate array (RPPA) data extracted from EW5
  xenograft tumors treated with IGF-1R/mTOR blockade (Figure 6B) have been mapped
  onto manually curated canonical signaling cascades. The IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway,
  which is constitutively active in ES, is highly active in xenograft-control states.
  Blockade of IGF-1R (second column) or mTOR (third column), respectively, induced
  cross-resistance by either upregulating pIR-α or maintaining the enhanced activation
  of downstream oncogenic proteins such as PI3K, AKT, or eIF4E. The IGF-1R/mTOR blockade
  (Combination, fourth column) statistically significantly inhibited the IGF-1R/mTOR
  pathway, with prominent effects on IRS1, pPI3K, pAkt, p4EBP1, pS6, and others. The
  blockade of either IGF-1R or mTOR maintained MAPK pathway signaling levels, which
  were similar to those of the control group; the blockade of both IGF-1R and mTOR
  led to greater MEK1/2 inhibition, with the exception of pSRC-Y416. The IGF-1Ri–mTORi
  combination inhibited several RTKs that are frequently activated in other cancer
  types, including c-Kit, HER3, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); however,
  this treatment upregulated estrogen receptor (ER)-α. Key proteins that were not
  present in the RPPA or immunoblot panels are given in bold text only. pIR proteins
  were present in the immunoblot analyses (Figure 6F; Supplementary Figure 7, available
  online) and are represented here accordantly. Abbreviated gene of the indicated
  protein is provided in the Supplementary Table (available online) of proteins analyzed
  in RPPA.
