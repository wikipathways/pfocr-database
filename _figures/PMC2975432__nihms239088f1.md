caption: The Oxidative Stress—Chronic Stress Cycle of Aging. Integration of the role
  of the ASK1-Signalosome in ROS-Mediated Regulation of the p38 MAPK Pathway and Physiological
  Characteristics of Aging. (1) ROS generated by mitochondrial dysfunction; (2) the
  ASK1-signalosome responds to changes in levels of oxidative stress (ROS); (3) (SH)2
  Trx complexes with ASK1 to form (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex, a component of the inASK1-signalosome;
  (4) the (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex (inASK1-signalosome) inhibits p38 MaPK activity; (5
  → 7) inhibition of p38 MAPK activity attenuates stress response gene expression
  and favors expression of longevity assurance genes and resistance to oxidtive stress.
  (8) Increased endogenous ROS stimulates dissociation of the (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex
  to form the actASK1-signalosome. (9) ASK1 activates the p38 MAPK pathway and (10)
  p38 targeted genes that promote aging. (8 → 12) This is the predominant pathway
  that promotes accelerated aging and sensitivity to oxidative stress. (13) The in
  vitro and in vivo attenuation of SIAC associated with extended lifespan or the activation
  of SIAC associated with aging and senescence.
