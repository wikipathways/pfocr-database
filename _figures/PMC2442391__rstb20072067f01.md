caption: A simplified overview of the metabolic network implemented by a hypothetical
  minimal genome of 208 protein-coding genes derived by an integrated approach (modified
  from ). Names of substrates freely available for the hypothetical minimal cell are
  represented inside a frame. Two sink metabolites are labelled in grey. Coenzyme
  metabolism (except the folate metabolism linked to TTP biosynthesis) is shown in
  the inset and was not considered in the stoichiometric analysis. Wider arrows in
  the glycolytic pathway indicate the two steps where ATP is synthesized by substrate-level
  phosphorylation.
