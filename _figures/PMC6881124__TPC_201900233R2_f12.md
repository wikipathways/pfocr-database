caption: Proposed Working Model of the SPL9-DEWAX Signaling Module.SPL9 and DEWAX
  gene and protein expression levels oscillated in a diurnal cycle, through multiple
  layers of transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and/or posttranslational regulations.
  During the day or in the light conditions, SPL9 expression was transcriptionally
  activated in a miR156-resistant manner, and miR156 and DEWAX expressions were inhibited.
  SPL9 also upregulated DEWAX expression in the day, forming a negative feedback loop
  that may be important in moderating the light response in wax synthesis. Furthermore,
  DEWAX protein was degraded through the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway in the light.
  During the night or in the dark conditions, miR56 and DEWAX expressions were induced
  and SPL9 expression was repressed. Furthermore, DEWAX directly interacts with SPL9
  to form a heterodimer and inhibit its DNA binding ability. The diurnal gene or protein
  expression of SPL9 and DEWAX, and SPL9 protein activity regulation by DEWAX may
  operate together to modulate CER1 rhythmic gene expression and wax synthesis through
  the light/dark cycle.
