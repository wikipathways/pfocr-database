caption: Complement lectin pathway activation. The diagram shows the zoom-in of the
  immune system enrichment results mapped as a network. Nodes and edges represent,
  respectively, the proteins and their interaction in the pathway of complement lectin
  activation. The color intensity of each protein (node) indicates the fold change
  increment in the urinary exosome fraction of MSK (red) versus ICN (blue) patients
  and the node size is representative of their p-value. The gray nodes represent unidentified
  proteins (circle) and protein complexes (diamonds) in the lectin pathway. The hexagons
  indicate the three proteins that maximize the discrimination between ICN and MSK
  samples as highlighted by the combined use of univariate/multivariate statistical
  analysis and machine learning algorithms.
