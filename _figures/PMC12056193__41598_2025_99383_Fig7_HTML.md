caption: Schematic illustration of Erianin inhibits metastasis. Erianin could inhibit
  the proliferation of A375, and the mechanism is partly related to the regulation
  of VEGF-α/VEGFR2 signaling pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. ↓ represent
  downregulated proteins in the negative control group compared with in the high dose
  Erianin treatment group (ERH) group. = represent no significantly different between
  the negative control group compared with in the high dose Erianin treatment group
  (ERH) group (n = 6/group)
