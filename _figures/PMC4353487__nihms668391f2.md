caption: Pre-critical weight larval growth is regulated by nutrient-dependent signals
  that emanate from the fat body. Ingested amino acids are sensed by fat body cells
  and activate TOR kinase, which promotes the release of an unknown factor that stimulates
  DILP2 secretion from the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). DILP2, in turn, promotes
  growth and development in peripheral tissues by binding to the insulin receptor
  (dInR) and activating the insulin signaling pathway. Additionally, the fat body
  releasesd ALS and Imp-L2, which form a stable complex with DILP2 and dampen insulin
  signaling.
