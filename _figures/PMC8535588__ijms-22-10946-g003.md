caption: Redox signaling pathways participating in the regulation of cell differentiation,
  induction of pluri- and totipotency. The onset of these programs is accompanied
  by the early short-term ROS level increase, which mediates/stimulates the rearrangements
  of cell phenotypes and large-scale metabolic shifts. These shifts determine the
  prevalent energy production pathway corresponding to each cell phenotype. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; NOX, NADPH oxidase; MP, mitochondrial pore, OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway; PI3K, phosphatydylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase
  B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinases;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; p38, p38 kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; NF-kB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor
  1α; FOXO1, forkhead box protein O1; PIAS4, protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4,
  2C-like cells, transient cell population within PSC cell cultures that expresses
  high levels of transcripts found in two-cell (2C) embryos.
