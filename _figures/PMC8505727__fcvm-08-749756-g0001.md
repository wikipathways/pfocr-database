caption: Overview of the major mitochondrial protein import pathways in yeast. First,
  the presequence pathway transports presequence-carrying cleavable preproteins to
  the mitochondrial matrix (1) or IM (2, 3) (in green). Presequence-carrying precursors
  to the mitochondrial matrix (1) are typically recognized by TOM at the OM, passage
  the IM through TIM23, and are driven into the matrix assisted by PAM. Δψ across
  the IM is essential for the entry of presequences into the matrix. The presequences
  are cleaved by MPP, and additional proteolytic processing occurs by intermediate
  cleaving peptidases. Presequence-carrying precursors that integrate into IM follow
  two distinct routes. IM proteins are either directly laterally released from the
  TIM23 complex (2) or transported into the matrix first followed by further insertion
  into the IM with the help of Oxa1 (3). Oxa1 also is responsible for insertion of
  IM proteins synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes. Second, in the carrier pathway
  for the import of precursor proteins without a cleavable presequence, yet with internal
  targeting signals into the IM (in yellow), carrier precursors are accompanied by
  cytosolic chaperones, delivered to the Tom70 receptor of the TOM complex, bound
  by small TIM chaperones in the IMS, and eventually integrated into the IM by the
  TIM22 complex in a Δψ-dependent manner. Third, in the MIA pathway for cysteine-rich
  proteins to the IMS (in blue), the precursors are kept in a reduced state in the
  cytosol, imported by the TOM complex, oxidized by the MIA machinery, and stay in
  an oxidized state in the IMS. Fourth, in the SAM complex for β-barrel proteins to
  the OM (in red), the precursors of β-barrel proteins are imported by the TOM complex
  at the OM, bound to small TIM chaperones in the IMS, and inserted into the OM by
  the SAM complex. Fifth, some proteins with α-helical transmembrane segments are
  inserted into the OM by the MIM complex (in purple). Typically, the Tom40 channel
  is not involved in this route, but Tom70 is indispensable. In addition, ERMES is
  a complex that connects ER and mitochondrial OM, facilitating the dynamic substrate
  exchange between ER and mitochondrion. Mdm10 is a protein with dual localization
