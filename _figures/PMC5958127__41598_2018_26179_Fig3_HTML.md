caption: 'Biosynthesis of PBDs. (a) Chorismate pathways: chorismate/anthranilate pathway
  for the biosynthesis of anthranilic acid precursors incorporated into tomaymycin
  (blue) and limazepine F (red) and here elucidated chorismate/DHHA pathway for the
  biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid precursors incorporated into limazepines
  E and C (red). Biosynthetic steps up to DHHA are shared with the biosynthesis of
  phenazines (black). Proteins elucidated in this study are underlined; the minor
  biosynthetic stream is indicated by dashed arrows; (b) kynurenine pathway for the
  biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid precursors incorporated into anthramycin,
  porothramycin and sibiromycin; (c) limazepine APD biosynthetic pathway; (d) proposed
