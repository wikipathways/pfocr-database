caption: A schematic illustration depicting the dysregulation of the NF2/Merlin-Hippo
  signaling cascade in mesothelioma cells. Extracellular signals are transmitted through
  cell–cell interactions (via cadherins), cell–matrix interactions (via integrins),
  and growth factor receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, influencing the
  tumor-suppressive function of Merlin. When Merlin is in an active, underphosphorylated
  state, it modulates the Hippo signaling cascade and inhibits the activity of YAP1/TAZ
  transcriptional coactivators. However, in mesothelioma cells, frequent alterations
  in Merlin (the NF2 gene product) and key Hippo signaling pathway components, including
  LATS1/2, lead to YAP1/TAZ activation (underphosphorylation). This, in turn, promotes
  the expression of multiple pro-oncogenic genes
