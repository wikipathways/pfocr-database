caption: Model for the role of HBP1 in p38 MAPK-mediated senescence. This figure represents
  a summary and a perspective of the data in this paper. Premature senescence induced
  by oncogene imbalance is represented by RAS expression in primary cells. From the
  data in Fig.  to  and in the literature, activated Ras in primary human cells initiates
  a premature senescence program that is orchestrated by p38 MAPK pathway activation
  (MKK6/MKK3 and p38 MAPK) and involves both p53 and RB. Our data indicate that HBP1
  is an effector of both p38 MAPK signaling and RB in this premature-senescence pathway.
  Furthermore, high Wip1 and low HBP1 expression levels were statistically correlated
  with decreased relapse-free survival in a large database of breast cancer patients
  (Fig. ). Thus, the relative expression levels of two components of the premature
  senescence pathway are correlated with a poor prognosis. In sum, we speculate that
  overriding a p38 MAPK-mediated premature-senescence pathway reprograms the cell
  toward a path that leads to malignant tumors, possibly of poor prognosis.
