caption: Schematic representation of intracellular signaling pathways of IL-4, SP-A,
  and IL-4+SP-A in alveolar macrophages. The binding of IL-4 to the ectodomains of
  IL-4Rα and γc chains results in phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues in
  IL-4Rα cytosolic domain, which serves as docking sites for SH domains of intracellular
  signaling molecules such as STAT6 and IRS2. Once STAT6 is activated by phosphorylation,
  they homodimerize via their Src homology 2 domains and translocate to the nucleus,
  where they bind to specific DNA sequences that induce expression of genes associated
  with alternative activation. In parallel, efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of
  IRS2 triggers the PI3K/Akt pathway, associated to the plasma and/or endosomal membranes.
  This signaling pathway activates cell proliferation and AM alternative activation.
  SP-A, via the Myo18A receptor, activates PI3K, Akt, mTORC1, and PKCζ, and inactivates
  GSK3α/β by phosphorylation, but cannot activate arginase-1 activity or AM proliferation.
  The combined effects of IL-4 and SP-A on the mTORC1 and GSK3 branches of PI3K-Akt
  signaling contribute to increased AM proliferation and alternative activation. Consistent
  with mTORC1 activation, SP-A+IL-4 synergistically increased mitochondrial respiration
  and glycolysis in AMs. In addition, SP-A+IL-4-mediated PKCζ signaling seems to intersect
  PI3K activation with STAT6 phosphorylation, increasing alternative activation of
  IL-4-stimulated macrophages.
