caption: Cell integrity pathway components involved in regulating receptor internalization.
  A schematic diagram of the proteins of the cell integrity pathway that are involved
  in the regulation of endocytosis. 1) Proteins required for the activation of Rho1
  (Tor2, Wsc1, and Rom2) are required for efficient internalization. 2) The endocytic
  function of Ypk1 is mediated in part by this pathway. Our results are consistent
  with a role for Ypk1 upstream of Rho1. Ypk1 is likely to be activated by Tor2-dependent
  phosphorylation (see DISCUSSION); however, the target of Ypk1 action is not known.
  3) The Rho1 effector Fks1 is required for endocytosis, perhaps by influencing the
  localization of components of the endocytic machinery or by affecting localization
  of Rho1 itself, which may be necessary for activation of an unidentified Rho1 effector
  and/or control of PI metabolism.
