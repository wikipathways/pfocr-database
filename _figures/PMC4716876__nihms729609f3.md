caption: The novel promising anti-inflammatory therapies. The conventional therapies
  target a limited number of pro-inflammatory factors and failed to block disease
  progression. The novel anti-inflammatory therapy targets upstream neuro-inflammatory
  signaling by inhibiting microglial NOX2, which in turn reduces superoxide production
  and over-activation of microglia and thereby reducing the release of most pro-inflammatory
  and detrimental factors.
