caption: Since CD44 is a Wnt target gene and a positive modulator of signal transduction
  of the Wnt pathway, it establishes a positive feedback loop to amplify Wnt signaling
  in the intestine acting at the level of the signalosome. Removal of Cd44 from the
  intestinal epithelium leads to decreased Wnt signaling still sufficient in homeostatic
  conditions but fails to increase Wnt activity as required in the regeneration of
  the intestinal epithelium after DSS damage.
