caption: Aim2 and p202 proteins in modulation of AD-related inflammation and neurodegeneration.
  TBI, pyroptosis, and brain infections activate innate immune responses in microglia
  through stimulation of TLRs and ISD pathway, resulting in the T1 IFN response and
  upregulation of the Aim2 and Ifi202 gene expression. A higher Aim2-to-p202 protein
  ratio in macrophages/microglia, which depends upon the genetic background of the
  mice, sex, and cell-type, is predicted to result in activation of the Aim2 inflammasome
  and pyroptosis, resulting in AD-related inflammation and neurodegeneration. However,
  a higher p202-to-Aim2 protein ratio in microglia is predicted to suppress AD-related
  inflammation and maintain homeostasis in the CNS
