caption: A proposed pathway model of Phd2 regulation on chondrocyte survival and differentiation.
  Phd2 is a major regulator for HIF degradation and therefore inhibits HIF signaling
  in chondrocytes. Depletion of Phd2 leads to the up-regulation of HIF-1α and further
  activates HIF downstream targets, Epo, VEGF, and glycolytic enzymes. Activation
  of HIF-1α signaling increases expression of chondrogenic genes such as Sox9 and
  Osx and promotes chondrocyte survival and differentiation. An increase in the HIF-1α
  level in Phd2 deficient chondrocytes also feedback up-regulates Phd3, the major
  regulator for HIF-2α. Phd2 also regulates chondrogenic genes via HIF-independent
  mechanisms.
