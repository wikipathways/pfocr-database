caption: 'Model of feedback and feedforward regulation induced by AtPDS overexpression
  in ripe fruit, leaves and flowers. Enzymes within the simplified MEP pathway are
  abbreviated in bold. DXS, deoxyxylulose 5‐phosphate (DXP) synthase; DXR, DXP reductase;
  HDR, 4‐hydroxy‐3‐methylbut‐2‐enyl diphosphate reductase. Enzyme products are abbreviated
  as follows: GAP, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate; DXP, deoxyxylulose 5‐phosphate; MEP,
  methyl‐d‐erythritol 4‐phosphate; HMBPP, 4‐hydroxy‐3‐methylbut‐2‐enyl diphosphate;
  IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; and GGPP, geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate. Carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes are abbreviated in bold: PSY1, 2 and
  3, phytoene synthase 1, 2 and 3; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZISO, ζ‐carotene isomerase;
  ZDS, ζ‐carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotene isomerase; CRTIL1, CRTISO‐like 1; CRTL‐E
  (LCY‐E), lycopene ε‐cyclase; CRTL‐B1 and 2 (LCY‐B and BCYC, respectively), lycopene
  β‐cyclase; CYP97A3, carotene ε‐hydroxylase; CRTR‐B1 and 2, carotene β‐hydroxylase
  1 and 2; and ABA is abscisic acid. Black dotted bar represents negative impacts
  on gene expression in response to AtPDS overexpression in ripe fruit. Dark grey
  arrows represent positive impacts by AtPDS overexpression in leaves. Light grey
  arrows/bars represent positive/negative impacts by AtPDS overexpression in anthesis
  flowers.'
