caption: The proposed mechanism of TRPA1 activation in renal tubular epithelial cells
  by hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) or I/R for the induction of renal inflammation and
  renal injury. As shown, H/R or I/R causes ROS increase, which in turn activates
  renal epithelial TRPA1, thereby, ultimately promoting of Ca2+ influx. The increase
  of intracellular Ca2+ in renal epithelial cells then contributes to the activation
  of NADPH oxidase, which can result in the elevation of the intracellular ROS. This
  effect activates the MAPKs/NF-κB signaling pathway, which allows the induction of
  inflammatory chemokines and aggravates renal injury.
