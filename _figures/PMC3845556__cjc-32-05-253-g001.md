caption: PI3K signaling impacts on cell growth, survival, differentiation, and proliferation.
  The pointed arrows represent activation of substrates, while blunt arrows represent
  inhibition. Activation of membrane kinases, such as insulin-like growth factor-1
  (IGF1), by external growth factors can initiate activation of intracellular signaling
  pathways. AKT is phosphorylated downstream of PI3K with various effects, including
  the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR phosphorylates p70S6
  and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP-1), which then leads to an increased translation
  of mRNA that encodes several cell cycle regulators. These effects are controlled
  by the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)-TSC2 complex. The Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway has
  its own distinct downstream effects, but also converges with the PI3K-AKT pathway.
  Future combination regimens involving targeted agents against this signaling network
  include the concomitant or sequential blockade of these pathways. PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.
