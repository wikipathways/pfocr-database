caption: 'The major function of RECK: (A) RECK is a metal protease negative regulatory
  factor: (a) RECK binds to MT1-MMP and binds it to the GEEC-CLIC endocytic pathway
  for degradation. (b and c) MT1-MMP1 can cleave matrix metalloproteinases such as
  MMP2 and MMP9 and release its mature form. RECK can negatively regulate the release
  of MMP2 and MMP9 by inhibiting MT1-MMP and can make MMP2 and MMP9 inactive by directly
  binding to them. (d) RECK negatively regulates its downstream effects by inhibiting
  the activity or expression of MMPs and ADAMs. (e) RECK can negatively regulate the
  release of MMP2 and MMP9 by inhibiting MT1-MMP and can make MMP2 and MMP9 inactive
  by directly binding to them. (B) RECK is a specific raise factor of WNT7 protein:
  (a) In the presence of Gpr124, RECK potentiates WNT7/β-catenin signaling. (b) In
  the absence of Gpr124, RECK scavenges WNT7 away from Fz5/Lrp5/6 complexes. (C) RECK
  is involved in both the lL-6 signaling pathway and the Trans signaling pathway:
  (a) RECK can competitively bind the IL-6 receptor and gp130, forming the IL-6 receptor
  complex, and can block the IL-6 signaling pathway. (b) RECK can inhibit ADAM10 cleavage
  and release soluble IL-6R so that harmful IL-6 trans signal path. Created in BioRender.
