caption: The proposed mechanism of IGFBP-3 in the regulation of HSC migration. IGFBP-3
  expression is up-regulated by GIPC through epigenetic changes characterized by a
  decrease of H3K27 trimethylation and a reciprocal increase in H3K27 acetylation
  after activation of the TGF receptor. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 promotes HSC migration
  by iron-enabled binding to integrin β1 and mediates AKT signaling, leading to autocrine
  and paracrine HSC migration. Akt, protein kinase B.
