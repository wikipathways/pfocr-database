caption: Regulated intramembrane proteolysis proteins of P. aeruginosa. The model
  is based on currently available data and in-part inferred from the E. coli system.
  The C-terminal WVF motif of MucE primes the AlgW protease by binding to the PDZ
  domain []. Activated AlgW cleaves the periplasmic domain of MucA, releasing MucB
  along with a C-terminal fragment of MucA []. MucP induces site-2 cleavage []. SspA
  binds to the N-terminus of MucA [] bringing the fragment to the ClpXP proteasome
  for degradation []. The free AlgT/U [] binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP, α2ßß’w) to
  initiate transcription of genes in the alg regulon [] leading to alginate production.
  The roles of LptD, AlgO, MucD and ClpP2 (has 40 % sequence identity with ClpP) in
  this pathway have not yet been established. MucD is hypothesized to inhibit the
  interaction of the MucE with AlgW. MucB is presumed to prevent the cleavage of MucA
  by AlgW. The proteins, AlgO, AlgW and MucD, contain PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO1)
  domains that are involved in protein–protein interactions.
