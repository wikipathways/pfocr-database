caption: 'The UPR pathway is mediated by three transmembrane proteins: IRE1, PERK,
  and ATF6. Upon ER stress, 1) PERK dimerizes to activate its kinase, and phosphorylates
  eIF2α to decrease global protein translation, but selectively activates the translation
  of ATF4. PERK also phosphorylates NRF2. ATF4 and NRF2 initiate the transcription
  of genes involved in the antioxidant response and amino acid transport, thereby
  alleviating ER stress; 2) ATF-6α traffics from the ER to the Golgi, where it is
  proteolytically activated to release the cytosolic B-ZIP transcription factor domain
  of ATF-6α that translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional factor
  to upregulate UPR target gene expression to protect the cell from ER stress; 3)
  IRE1 dimerization and autophosphorylation activate its endoribonuclease activity,
  which is responsible for removing 26 nucleotides from the X box-binding protein
  1 (XBP1) mRNA via an unconventional splicing event. Spliced Xbp-1 encodes a potent
  transcription factor of the basic-leucine zipper (B-ZIP) family, which induces ERAD
  proteins and chaperones. The ER protein quality control system includes protein
  re-folding apparatus (ER-resident folding chaperones), ERAD and autophagy. There
  are at least three mechanisms for how protein S-nitrosylation affects the UPR pathway
  and protein quality control systems in ER stress, eventually leading to IR. 1) S-nitrosylation
  of IRE1 prevents the generation of sXBP1 by inhibiting IRE1 endoribonuclease activity.
  2) S-nitrosylation of the chaperone PDI inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading
  to accumulation of misfolded proteins. 3) S-nitrosylation of the lysosomal proteins
  HexB and CTSB inhibit these autophagy-related lysosomal enzymes, blocking autophagy.
  Although PEAK, BiP and UBE2D1 also can be S-nitrosylated in certain conditions or
  cell types, the link to IR remains unclear.'
