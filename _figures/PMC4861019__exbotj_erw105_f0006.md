caption: Proposed β-diketone synthase (DKS) polyketide pathway for synthesis of β-diketones,
  their derivatives and esterified alkan-2-ols. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) plus auxiliary
  enzymes (AE) in plastids (green) synthesize acyl chains (x=9–17) that are exported
  therefrom and presumed to enter the endoplasmic reticulum’s membrane (gray) where
  FAE derived aliphatics are synthesized. Here they are activated by CoA to form an
  acyl-CoA pool. Acyl editing transfers the acyl chains to a glycerolipid in a reversible
  reaction. Acyl-CoAs can serve as substrates for fatty acid elongase (FAE) complexes
  giving, for example, a fatty acid (y=17–21; pink, center left side). Given that
  CER-Q on the basis of homology is classified as a lipase, its acyl substrate is
  potentially esterified to a glycerolipid (top center). The CER-Q cleaved acyl chain
  activated by coenzyme A is elongated (+C2) to give the β-ketoacyl compound that
  is the substrate for two pathways; (i) β-diketones and their derivatives (right
  side). The DKS (CER-C) introduces two oxygens into the acyl chain, which are followed
  by further elongations analogous to those carried out by FAE and loss of a carbon
  yields β-diketones (see ). In barley CER-U a P450 hydroxylase inserts a hydroxyl
  group on carbon 25. (ii) Esterified alkan-2-ols (left side). Cleavage of CoA plus
  the carboxyl carbon yields methyl ketones that can be hydrolyzed to short alkan-2-ols,
  primarily with 13 and 15 carbons, for esterification with fatty acids originating
  from FAE. Mutants of Cer-u and Cer-c accumulate β-diketones and esterified alk-2-ols,
  respectively. The final aliphatics are transported to and through the apoplast (orange)
  onto its surface. Single arrows, known reaction(s); sequential arrows, hypothetical
  reaction(s).
