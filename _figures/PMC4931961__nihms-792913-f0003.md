caption: To determine which TNF receptor was driving the migratory phenotype, expression
  of key pathway genes was measured in response to TNFα. Significantly upregulated
  genes are displayed in green and significantly down regulated genes are displayed
  in red. Key genes down regulated in the TNFR1 family are members of the caspase
  family. Key genes upregulated in the TNFR2 family are NF-kB and TNFR2 suggesting
  that the migratory phenotype is being signaled through the TNFR2 family via NF-kB
  (n = 6 per group).
