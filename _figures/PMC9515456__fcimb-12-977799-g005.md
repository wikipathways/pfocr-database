caption: Host cellular contribution in the later events of viroplasm dynamics. Many
  ER chaperone proteins such as Erp57, PDI, and Calreticulin translocate near RV viroplasms.
  PDI and Calreticulin foster RV morphogenesis. In RV infected cells, mTOR inhibition
  and the autophagic signalling are induced by host microRNA-dependent mechanism and
  also via NSP4-Ca2+-Calmodulin-CaMKKβ-AMPK pathway. Overall, mTOR restriction causes
  de-repression of the ULK1 complex which subsequently forms phagophore through Beclin1
  complex activation and LC3 II lipidation. However, autophagosomes are prevented
  from lysosomal targeting in RV infected cells; instead, they are utilized for carrying
  the RV proteins NSP4 and VP7 coming out with the ER-derived COP-II vesicles to maturing
  progeny virions within viroplasms, thereby aiding in outer capsid assembly. Inhibiting
  CaMKKβ by STO-609 abrogates the presence of NSP4 and VP7 to reside surrounding autophagosome-engulfed
  viroplasms, leading to curtailed RV progeny yield. Other host contributors which
  aid in the RV morphogenesis within viroplasms are subunits (ATP5B, ATP5A1, ATP5O)
  of the mitochondrial ATP synthase holoenzyme that re-locate to viroplasms and interact
  with the 3′ UTR consensus of RV RNAs (5′-UGUGACC-3′). Potential involvement of an
  intermediate protein has been speculated to facilitate the ATP synthase-RV RNA 3′
  UTR association. Chemical inhibitors targeting ATP synthase such as Isoapoptolidin,
  Venturicidin, and BDM antagonize RV progeny yield.
