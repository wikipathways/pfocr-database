caption: Possible underlying mechanism of PAR4 signaling. PAR4 activation may directly
  activate PI3K/AKT pathway, which then upregulates the activity of the downstream
  effector mTOR and downregulates the activities of Foxo1 and PTEN, and subsequently
  controls the expression of Foxp3, CD25, and CD62L. However, accumulation of excessive
  proteases at the sites of inflammation may overregulate PAR4 signaling on various
  cell types including Tregs, which then reduces function, stability, and mobility
  of Tregs. Moreover, PAR4 activation may also negatively control adenosine pathway.
  Once removing PAR4 signaling, the negative regulator, these Tregs possess “super”
  capacity with a Foxp3high CD25high CD62Lhigh phenotype and are able to induce immune
  tolerance.
