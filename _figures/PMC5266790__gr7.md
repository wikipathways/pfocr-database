caption: Working ModelPP2A-B55Pab1 represses the activity of the module TORC2-Gad8
  by directly reverting the phosphorylation of Gad8 at Ser546. In nitrogen-rich conditions,
  this mechanism prevents untimely expression of mating genes. Upon nitrogen starvation,
  TORC1 inactivation leads to the inhibition of PP2A-B55Pab1, through a mechanism
  that depends on the Greatwall-Endosulfin pathway (Ppk18-Igo1). Consequently, PP2A-B55Pab1
  can no longer exert its negative effect on the TORC2-Gad8 module, which results
  in the increased phosphorylation of Gad8 at Ser546 and its enhanced activity toward
  Fkh2Ser321. Phosphorylation of Fkh2 (and probably other unknown targets of Gad8)
  leads to the induction of the expression of mating genes. Other unknown targets
  of PP2A-B55Pab1 might also participate in the transcriptional regulation of mating
  genes and sexual differentiation. The relative importance of Gad8 compared to other
  targets cannot be evaluated with current data. This effect is aided by other events
  also regulated by TORC1, e.g., cell shortening and G1 arrest (see main text for
  details).
