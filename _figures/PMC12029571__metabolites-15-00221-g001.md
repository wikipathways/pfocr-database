caption: 'Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways involved in cancer.
  The Warburg effect describes the preference for aerobic glycolysis over oxidative
  phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. In tumors, the upregulation of
  glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, promotes glucose uptake, which fuels glycolysis:
  it converts glucose into pyruvate, which is subsequently transformed into acetyl-CoA,
  feeding the TCA cycle. This process generates ATP and key intermediates such as
  citrate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), essential for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose
  is also directed into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), generating ribose-5-phosphate
  and NADPH, necessary for redox balance. The generated pyruvate is reduced to lactate
  by LDH, and the excess lactate produced by cells is exported into the extracellular
  space via monocarboxylate transporters MCT4 (monocarboxylate transporter 4). Glutamine
  participates in glutaminolysis, a process that converts glutamine to glutamate (Glu),
  via glutaminase (GLS), and then to α-ketoglutarate, fueling the TCA cycle. Glutamate
  is a precursor in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), which is a potent antioxidant.
  In cancer, MYC and RAS promote glucose uptake and regulate glutamine metabolism.
  In the tumor microenvironment, alanine metabolism contributes to protein biosynthesis
  and acts as an anaplerotic substrate to replenish TCA cycle intermediates. Arginine
  is converted to nitric oxide (NO) via nitric oxide synthesis (NOS). ADC (arginine
  decarboxylase) catalyzes the decarboxylation of arginine, converting it to agmatine.
  Arginine enters the urea cycle and is converted to ornithine. Ornithine, via ornithine
  decarboxylase (ODC), forms polyamines, which, together with NO, are involved in
  tumor growth. Carnitine may help cancer cells adapt to low-oxygen conditions by
  providing an alternative energy source that is less reliant on glycolysis. Created
