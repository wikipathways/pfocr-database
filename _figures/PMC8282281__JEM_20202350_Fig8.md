caption: Schematic diagram showing the transdifferentiation of tumor cells during
  MB relapse. During MB recurrence after irradiation, the BMP pathway is activated
  in tumor cells. BMP signaling induces the phosphorylation of Sox9, which drives
  the transdifferentiation of tumor cells into astrocytes. Astrocytes promote the
  proliferation of MB cells, supporting tumor relapse. Inhibitors of BMP receptors
  (BMPRi) block tumor cell transdifferentiation, thereby suppressing the recurrence
  of MB.
