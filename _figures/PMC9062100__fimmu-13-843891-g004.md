caption: TLR signaling pathway related to CVB3 infection. TLR4/NF-κB is activated
  after CVB3 infection; TLR3 recognizes CVB3 dsRNA and activates TRIF and TRAF6 to
  transmit signals to NF-κB; TLR8 recognizes CVB3 ssRNA and activates NF-κB signaling
  pathway. TLR2 and TLR8 recognizes HCM and promotes the differentiation of Th cells.
  Although other TLRs may be related to the pathogenesis of myocarditis, whether other
  TLRs can be activated and its downstream pathway after CVB3 infection has not been
  reported.
