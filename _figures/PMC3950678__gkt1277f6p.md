caption: The causal gene network inferred from top discriminative modules at a significance
  level of 0.005. The major parts of the causal network that overlap with the KEGG
  maps are indicated. The network with green nodes involves metabolic pathways. The
  network with pink nodes provides a partial interface of the FAK signaling pathway,
  which communicates with the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and the MAPK signaling
  pathway. The network with yellow nodes mostly connected by dotted lines partially
  overlaps with the PPAR singling pathway, and the network is centered on RXRB. This
  is the first study to suggest that the RXRB-causal network is involved in lymph
  node metastasis.
