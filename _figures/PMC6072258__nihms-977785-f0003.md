caption: 'MIR1 mechanism. A) Top and bottom strands processing results in a chromosomal
  translocation. Formation of each translocated DNA strand can be independent from
  each other. The only kinetic constraint of MIR1 is the cleavage of I5 prior to being
  reached by the synthesis initiated at T5. MIR1 leaves as immediate products: 1)
  the original DSB, which has lost its 3′ extremity involved in MIR and that can be
  repaired by HR using the homolog as a template; 2) the translocation chromatid;
  and 3) and 4) two oriented single-ended DSBs (the left side of the T donor with
  a 3′ protruding extremity and the right side of the I invasion with a 5′ protruding
  extremity). Both can be repaired with or without additional rearrangements, depending
  on their sequence context. The question mark indicates uncertainties regarding the
  nature and position of the cleavage events at I5. B) Outline of MIR1 initiated by
  a ssDNA gap. Dashed lines indicate recombination-associated DNA synthesis.'
