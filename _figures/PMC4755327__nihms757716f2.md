caption: Pathways by which exercise may ameliorate cancer-related fatigue. Exercise
  training confers psychological benefits, such as increased self-efficacy, and leads
  to improved fitness which eases the effort required for daily life activities. Exercise
  training decreases chronic inflammation through reductions in inflammatory cytokines,
  increased production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), and increased glucocorticoid receptor
  (GCR) function. Reduced inflammation in the periphery prevents disruption of neurotransmitter
  production (including norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA)) and inflammation in
  the central nervous system (CNS). Exercise is further associated with increased
  neurotrophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and adiponectin.
  Exercise-induced increases in skeletal muscle PGC-1α expression, perhaps mediated
  by adiponectin, helps maintain levels of tryptophan (Trp) and serotonin (5HT) through
  activation of kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), which favor the formation of
  neuroprotective kynurenine metabolites (kynurenic acid). PGC-1α may also promote
  mitochondrial biogenesis. Dashed lines indicate a disrupted pathway.

  description: Pathways by which exercise may ameliorate cancer-related fatigue. Exercise
    training confers psychological benefits, such as increased self-efficacy, and
    leads to improved fitness which eases the effort required for daily life activities.
    Exercise training decreases chronic inflammation through reductions in inflammatory
    cytokines, increased production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), and increased glucocorticoid
    receptor (GCR) function. Reduced inflammation in the periphery prevents disruption
    of neurotransmitter production (including norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA))

    serotonin (5HT) through activation of kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), which
    favor the formation of neuroprotective kynurenine metabolites (kynurenic acid).
    PGC-1α may also promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Dashed lines indicate a disrupted
