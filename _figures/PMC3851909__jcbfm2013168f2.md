caption: Pentose–phosphate pathway (PPP) is an important contributor to glucose consumption
  in neurons. Schematic representation of the main conclusion of this work, highlighting
  the critical contribution of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)–which converts PPP-derived
  F6P into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)–to fueling PPP at the expense of G6P consumption
  through glycolysis. 6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), which converts fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P) into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP), is a ‘bottleneck' in neurons due to
  the low levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (a positive effector of PFK1); this
  facilitates F6P conversion into G6P. Stoichiometry has been omitted for clarity,
  and dotted lines represent multiple reactions. GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  PYR, pyruvate; R5P, ribulose-5-phosphate.
