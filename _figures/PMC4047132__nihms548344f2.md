caption: 'Cellular functions of proteins commonly mutated in uveal melanoma. Mutations
  in GNAQ and GNA11 disable GTPase activity (indicated by X), resulting in constitutive
  activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway. BAP1 encodes an enzyme that removes monoubiquitin moieties
  (“ub”) from specific substrates, including histone H2A, HCF1, and BRCA1. Interaction
  of BAP1 with ASXL family members is required for this enzymatic activity. These
  interactions affect chromatin structure and transcription. The SF3B1 protein is
  an integral component of both the major U2 and minor U12 spliceosomes. SF3B1 mutations
  in uveal melanoma alter the splicing of specific RNA transcripts. EIF1AX encodes
  an essential translation initiation factor required for the formation of proteins
  from mRNA. Mutations in EIF1AX have not been extensively studied but would be expected
  to alter the production of proteins that may promote tumor progression. Abbreviations:
