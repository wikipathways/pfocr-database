caption: Host anti-viral signals are initiated when cells sense the presence of pathogens
  via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as extracellular toll like receptors
  (TLRs), or intracellular RIG-I like helicases (RLHs) or DNA binding proteins. PRRs
  recognize molecular signatures of pathogens, the single or double stranded RNA or
  DNA. TLR3 activates Toll–interleukin (IL)-1-resistance (TIR) domain-containing adaptor
  inducing IFN-b (TRIF), whereas TLR7 and 9 activate myeloid differentiation factor
  88 (MyD88). Melanoma differentiation– associated gene (mda-5) and retinoic acid-inducible
  gene-1 (RIG-I) activate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 3
  (TRAF3) via Cardif/VISA/MAVS/IPS-1. Activated TRAF3 interacts with TRAF family member
  associated NFκB activator (TANK), TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and the related
  IκB Kinase ε (IKKε) to phosphorylate and translocate IRFs in the nucleus. In a parallel
  pathway, NFκb activation is initiated by polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and receptor
  interacting protein -1 (RIP1). These adaptors recruit transforming growth factor
  (TGF) β –activating enzyme 1 (TAK1), NFκB essential modifier (NEMO) and IκB Kinases
  (IKK) into a multi protein complex that phosphorylates inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) resulting
  in its ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. The degradation of IκB reveals
  the nuclear localization signal of NFκB which then translocates to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, activated IRFs and NFκB assemble at the IFNβ promoter together with
  ATF-2/c-jun and other co-factors to stimulate IFN transcription. IFNs are secreted
  and induce an antiviral state in neighboring cells by binding to the receptors IFNAR
  1 &2 and activating the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and Tyk2 which in turn activate signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STATs). Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2
  heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they associate with IRF-9 to
  form the hetrotrimeric transcription factor ISGF3. Binding of ISGF3 to the IFN stimulated
  response element (ISRE) induces transcription of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs).Viral
