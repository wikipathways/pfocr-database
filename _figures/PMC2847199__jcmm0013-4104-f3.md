caption: The Krebs cycle enzymes (SDH, FH and IDH) are tumour suppressors and linked
  to EglN activity. Inactivation of metabolic enzymes SDH, FH or IDH directly affects
  EglN activity. The EglN prolyl hydroxylases are dependent upon the Krebs cycle metabolite
  α-ketoglutarate as electron donor for hydroxylation activity. Loss of function mutation
  in IDH decreases α-ketoglutarate levels and subsequently impairs EglN function.
  On the other hand, mutation in SDH or FH leads to accumulation of succinate or fumarate
  respectively, which in turn product-inhibits EglN activity. Loss of function of
  SDH, FH or IDH would lead to impaired Krebs cycle activity and impaired oxidative
  phosphorylation with the consequence of enhanced glycolysis (Embden–Meyerhof pathway)
  to generate ATP. The generated pyruvate during glycolysis is redirected away from
  the Krebs cycle by conversion into lactate. Cancer cells tend to convert most glucose
  to lactate regardless of whether oxygen is present (aerobic glycolysis), an observation
  that was first made by Otto Warburg in 1924. Despite the striking difference in
  ATP production, cancer cells might favour aerobic glycolysis to escape from EglN
  hydroxylation, resulting in the accumulation of oncogenic HIFα. and/or resistant
  to EglN3-mediated apoptosis.
