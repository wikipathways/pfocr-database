caption: ROS-mediated inhibition of aconitase may truncate the TCA cycle in diabetic
  sural nerve, sciatic nerve and DRG (bold arrows). This would result in the observed
  maintenance of succinate, fumarate, and malate levels in the face of decreased citrate
  and isocitrate. Reduced glycolytic intermediates feeding into the TCA cycle in sural
  nerve and sciatic nerve may contribute to the observed decreases in citrate and
  isocitrate and be interpreted as a glucose-deficient state. Activation of the α-KG-utilizing
  truncated TCA cycle pathway in the sural and sciatic nerves, would further contribute
  to ROS production, and to the greater oxidative stress observed in diabetic sciatic
  nerve than DRG. α-KGDH, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; DRG, dorsal root ganglia;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
