caption: O-GlcNAcylation induces the DNA damage response and proliferation in stem
  cells. High glucose and reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause damage to DNA such as
  double strand breaks. O-GlcNAcylation is required to respond to DNA damage, through
  its accumulation at damage sites and activation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
  pathway. Response to DNA damage also requires the incorporation of variant histone
  H2AX, which is phosphorylated and can also be O-GlcNAc modified. Elevated O-GlcNAc
  induces stem and progenitor cell proliferation and the DNA damage response through
  γH2AX and a phosphorylation cascade of effector kinases. One of the downstream kinases,
  CHK1/2, phosphorylates OGT, which stabilizes the enzyme. This autoregulatory loop
  helps further promote the DNA damage response and proliferation.
