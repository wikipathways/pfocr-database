caption: Canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways of NOD1 and NOD2. A, B, NF‐κB
  and MAPK signaling pathways. NOD1 and NOD2 recognize bacterial PGN fragments, iE‐DAP
  and MDP, respectively. After ligand recognition, NODs undergo conformational changes
  and self‐oligomerization through homophilic CARD‐CARD interactions, allowing the
  recruitment and activation of the adaptor protein RIPK2. In an established protein
  complex, RIPK2 is polyubquitinated by TRAFs and cIAPs, allowing the recruitment
  of polyubiquitinated NEMO or TAK1 to the established protein complex. On one hand,
  NEMO triggers activation of the NF‐κB pathway by phosphorylation of IκB resulting
  in release NF‐κB transcription factor. The latter translocates to the nucleus where
  causes induction of pro‐inflammatory genes. On the other hand, TAK1 recruits TAB1/2/3
  activating both NF‐κB and MAPK pathway (JNK, ERK, and p38). Activated MAPKs translocate
  to the nucleus and activate AP‐1 transcription factor resulting transcription of
  genes involved in inflammatory response. C, Apoptosis pathway. NODs have been reported
  to interact with the apoptotic pathway indirectly through IAP family of proteins
  (cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP) and proapoptotic protein Bid. D, Inflammasome activation.
  NODs associate with several other NLRs (NLRP1 and NLRP3) to form inflammasome protein
  complexes. After detection of their cognate ligand, NLRs interact with ASC protein
  and procaspase‐1, resulting in formation of inflammasomes. Once formed, inflammasomes
  activate procaspase‐1, which in turn proteolytically processes pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines IL‐1β and IL‐18. E, Autophagy. Activated NODs recruit the autophagy protein
  ATG16L1 to the cell membrane and facilitate the formation of autophagosome around
  invading bacteria. F, Antiviral response. Viral ssRNA activates NOD2, which translocates
  to the mitochondria and supposedly binds to MAVS. This promotes formation of a complex
  with TBK1 and IKKα, which enables activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)
  3 resulting in production of IFN type I. ASC, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein
