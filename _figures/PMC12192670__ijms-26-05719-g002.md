caption: 'Mechanistic network of the pleiotropic regulatory effects of the vitamin
  D/VDR signaling pathway in the pathophysiological microenvironment of DFUs (by Figdraw).
  The complex microenvironment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), characterized by hyperglycemia,
  ischemia/hypoxia, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and bacterial infection,
  frequently results in the downregulated expression or dysfunction of the vitamin
  D receptor (VDR). This impairment undermines the physiological effects of vitamin
  D. Activation of the vitamin D/VDR signaling pathway may exert beneficial influences
  on DFUs through the following mechanisms: (1) Immunomodulation: It inhibits macrophage
  polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype while promoting the anti-inflammatory
  M2 phenotype. Consequently, this reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) and enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs,
  e.g., CAMP/LL-37) by keratinocytes and other cell types, thereby attenuating inflammation
  and strengthening antimicrobial defense. (2) Angiogenesis and Ischemic Repair: Activated
  vitamin D promotes neovascularization and improves tissue perfusion by stabilizing
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR2), and enhancing the proliferation, migration, and
  survival of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). (3) Neuroprotection: Activated
  vitamin D increases the expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGF and BDNF),
  promotes axonal regeneration, and potentially alleviates neuropathy progression
  and pain by modulating transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activity
  while suppressing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress'
