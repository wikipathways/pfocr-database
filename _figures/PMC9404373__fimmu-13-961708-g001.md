caption: Alternations of metabolic pathways participate in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
  arthritis. In the hypoxia microenvironment, HIF-1α promotes the expression of glucose
  transporter 1 and activation of hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase-1, and pyruvate
  kinase M2 in glycolysis. Glucose transported across the cell membranes by glucose
  transporter 1 then converted to pyruvate and generates two molecules of ATP. Glucose
  6-phosphate from glycolysis enters the PPP to produce ribose 5-phosphate and nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Pyruvate is transformed into acetyl-coenzyme A and
  oxaloacetate and enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. AA can be derived from
  membrane phospholipids in hypoxia and inflammatory environments. AA oxidized to
  thromboxanes and prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 by cyclooxygenase, or leukotrienes
  and HETEs by lipoxygenase promotes leukocyte infiltration. Arginine, proline, and
  glutamine can be converted into α-ketoglutaric acid and participate in the TCA cycle.
  Metabolite changes in RA can promote cytokine secretion, increasing the expression
  of vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor receptor-2, MMP9,
  MMP2, and activated signal transducer and activator of transcription phosphorylation
  along with leukocyte infiltration. Red (up) arrow indicates up-regulated metabolites
  and green (down) arrow indicates down-regulated metabolites. The figure was drawn
