caption: Transformation of the biochemical disturbance along the cell transformation
  pathway into the biophysical pathological states. Mitochondria transport protons
  into the intermembrane space, and their diffusion into cytosol leads to generation
  of a strong static electric field and water ordering. The strong static electric
  field shifts also vibrations in microtubules into a highly nonlinear region. The
  decrease of oxidative metabolism results in changes of the intensity of the static
  electric field and changes of water ordering. The water ordering depends on pH factor
  and also on the static electric field (). Energy is supplied to microtubules by
  hydrolysis of GTP upon β-tubulin polymerization, through motion of motor proteins,
  and by nonlinear transfer from the higher frequency oscillations.
