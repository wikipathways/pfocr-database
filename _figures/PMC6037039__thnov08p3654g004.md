caption: Functional mechanisms of lncRNAs in vascular disease. (A) Induced by LPS
  and OxLDL, TGFβ2-OT1 regulates atherosclerosis through microRNAs-mediated EC autophagy
  and inflammation. (B) RNCR3 is induced by OxDLD, and is athero-protective by serving
  as a miR-185-5p sponge, which in turn represses KLF2. (C) Induced by OxLDL, lincRNA-DYNLRB-2
  regulates atherosclerosis by boosting the GPR119/GLP-1R pathway. (D ) lncRNA HOXC-AS1
  represses cholesterol accumulation through the stimulation of HOXC6 expression.
  (E) lncRNA RP5-833A20.1 represses reverse cholesterol transport though the miR-382-5p/NFIA
  pathway. (F) lincRNA-p21 interacts with MDM2 and plays a protective role in atherosclerosis
  by enhancing p53 pathway activity in VSMC and macrophages. (G) SENCR promotes EC
  angiogenesis and represses VSMC migration through undefined mechanisms. (H) Stimulated
  by IL1α and PDGF, SMILR promotes atherosclerosis by enhancing VSMC proliferation
  through HAS2. (I) H19 promotes atherosclerosis by regulating p65 and p38 pathways
  in ECs and VSMCs. (J) lnc-Ang362 is stimulated by angiotensin II to regulate hypertension
  through the enhancement of miR-221 and miR-222 expression in VSMCs. (K) ANRIL enhances
  diabetic permeability, likely through the NF-κB/VEGF pathway. (L) MIAT promotes
  diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction by serving as a miR-150-5p sponge and
  upregulating VEGF. (M) H19 promotes tumor angiogenesis by functioning as a microRNA
  sponge in miR-630/EZH2 and miR-29a/vasohibin2 pathways. (N) HULC promotes tumor
  angiogenesis and invasion by functioning as a miR-107 sponge and subsequently boosting
  the E2F1/SPK1 pathway. (O) TUG1 promotes tumor angiogenesis by enhancing VEGF expression
  through the inhibition of miR-34a-5p and miR-299.
