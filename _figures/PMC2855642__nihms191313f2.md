caption: Glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. (A) Muscular-dystrophy-associated gene products
  that are involved in dystroglycan glycosylation. The O-mannose-linked glycans on
  α-dystroglycan are composed of a linear chain of four carbohydrates. Six genes implicated
  in muscular dystrophy encode products that alter the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan.
  Protein-O-mannosyltransferases 1 and 2 (POMT1/2) are both required for the synthesis
  of O-linked mannose to serines and threonines on the α-dystroglycan protein, whereas
  protein O-linked mannose β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT1) synthesizes
  the second linkage, β1,2GlcNAc, on the O-mannose chain. Three other proteins, fukutin
  (FCMD), fukutin-related protein (FKRP) and like-glycosyltransferase (LARGE), are
  also involved in this pathway, though their function is not yet clear. (B) Additional
  structures that might be attached to α-dystroglycan by O-linkages. FKRP, fukutin-related
  protein; Fuc, fucose; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; GlcA, glucuronic
  acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; LARGE, like-glycosyltransferase; Man, mannose;
  NeuAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid (or sialic acid); POMGnT1, protein O-linked mannose
  β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; POMT1/2, protein-O-mannosyltransferases 1/2;
  S, serine; SO4, sulfate; T, threonine.
