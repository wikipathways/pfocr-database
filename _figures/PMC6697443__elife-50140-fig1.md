caption: 'When male and hermaphrodite C. elegans roundworms mate, male sperm (blue)
  and seminal fluid (pale blue) mix with hermaphrodite self-sperm (grey). Nearly all
  oocytes are fertilized by male sperm rather than self-sperm following mating. The
  seminal fluid and self-sperm act on three signaling pathways that influence the
  health and longevity of C. elegans: an active sperm-sensing pathway is positive
  for the health of the roundworm, whereas active insulin and mTOR signaling pathways
  have negative effects on its health. Seminal fluid damages the health of roundworms
  because it activates both the insulin signaling pathway (through INS-7 and INS-8)
  and the mTOR signaling pathway (through a yet-to-be-discovered mechanism). Self-sperm,
  on the other hand, is good for the health of hermaphrodite roundworms because it
  activates the sperm-sensing pathway, and represses both the insulin signaling pathway
  (through the insulin peptide INS-37) and the mTOR signaling pathway (again through
  an unknown mechanism). Young hermaphrodites (top) have more self-sperm than old
  hermaphrodites (bottom), so they benefit from increased sperm-sensing signaling
  as well as reduced insulin and mTOR signaling. Old worms have less self-sperm to
  counter the adverse effects of seminal fluid, so they succumb to the negative consequences
  of insulin and mTOR signaling and die rapidly. The sperm-sensing pathway improves
  longevity by repressing the ephrin receptor VAB-1 and the transcription factor CEH-1.
  Activation of mTOR and insulin signaling removes two transcription factors that
  promote longevity (DAF-16 and HLH-30) from the cell nucleus, and translocates a
  transcription factor that reduces longevity (PQM-1) into the nucleus.'
