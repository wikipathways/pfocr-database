caption: 'Working model of the innate immune mechanisms that contribute to the immunogenicity
  and reactogenicity of mRNA-iLNP vaccines(A) Uptake of empty iLNPs by innate immune
  cells and other cell types is sufficient to induce local and systemic inflammation,
  characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6.(B)
  The incorporation of modified uridines and stringent IVT mRNA purification drastically
  lowers the recognition of IVT mRNA by TLR3/7/8 and other RNA sensors. These modifications
  are important to minimize the negative effects of type I IFN-stimulated RNA sensors
  on protein expression from the antigen-encoding mRNA and to avoid dose-limiting
  toxicities. The role of the MDA5-IFN-α signaling pathway in inducing CTLs to BNT162b2
  in mice suggests residual type I IFN activity of the current generation of mRNA
  vaccines.(C) After administration of a second vaccine dose, there is a strong boost
  in the T cell responses, which is associated with higher IFN-γ production. The enhanced
  activation of myeloid cells and T cells following boosting may reflect a crosstalk
  between lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Abbreviations: IVT, in vitro transcribed;
