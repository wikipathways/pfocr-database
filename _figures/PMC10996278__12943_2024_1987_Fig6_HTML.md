caption: Critical genes and signalling pathways engage in T cell anti-tumour responses.
  CRISPR screens results have revealed several intriguing genes and pathways that
  could potentially illuminate ways to enhance T cell functions in cancer immunotherapies.
  1) JAK/STAT signalling pathway is essential in various cytokine production and transcription
  factors generation. Different interleukins and interferons mediate different biological
  function in T cell effector functions and fate determination. 2) NF-κB signalling
  pathway is indispensable for TCR signal transduction, and is correlated with enhanced
  T cell effector function and resistance to exhaustion. 3) BATF is an important AP-1
  family transcription factor that functionally cooperates with IRF4 to regulate T
  cell proliferation, survival, and cytotoxicity. Critical T cell functional transcription
  factors including T-bet, Runx3, and Blimp-1 are also BATF-dependent. The role of
  BATF in T cell exhaustion remains unclear. Blimp-1 is highly expressed in exhausted
  T cells. Blimp-1 deficiency in CD8+ T cells indicates a higher possibility of memory
  cells and lower effector or exhausted phenotypes. TOX is a nuclear factor that maintains
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cell development, but leads to exhausted T cell phenotypes. Deletion
  of TOX in CD8+ T cells reverses the exhaustion markers expression, but fails to
  rescue the impaired effector function against tumours
