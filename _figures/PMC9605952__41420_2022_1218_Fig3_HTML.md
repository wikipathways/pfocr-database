caption: NCOA4 induces ferritin autophagic degradation leading to the release of iron,
  which in turn facilitates ferroptosis, while COPZ1 inhibits NCOA4/ferritin pathway.
  Ferritin could be embedded into multivesicular bodies and traffic out of cells as
  exosome leading to reduced intracellular iron levels and ferroptosis resistance.
  In response to inducers, p62-mediated FPN1 or ARNTL autophagic degradation, which
  in turn promote sensitivity of ferroptosis. Although ferritinophagy is triggered
  in response to inducers including RSL3, Fin56, DAT etc, the mechanism is unclear.
