caption: Schematic of the hypothesis that TNF-α increases BCSCs through up-regulation
  of TAZ expression via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. TNF-α induces expression
  of p100 and activates p100 processing into p52 by IKKα and the proteasome. p52 subsequently
  binds to a p52 binding site within the TAZ promoter, subsequently up-regulating
  the latter’s transcription. TAZ in turn promotes BCSCs in human breast cancer cell
  lines.
