  as indicated in Methods. IFNγ activates JAK-STAT1 pathway, increasing pSTAT1tyr,
  pERKs and to a lesser extent pP38 levels. Active MAPKs potentiates STAT1 activation
  by phosphorylation in a serine residue. Glial cells respond to IFNγ stimulation
  by increasing their production of radical species, i.e. by transcriptional up-regulation
  of iNOS. TGFβ1 is also able to activate MAPKs. Particularly, TGFβ1 can produce recruitment
  of TRAF6 () to activate P38 and regulate MKP-1 expression (reviewed by ). Our results
  show that, particularly in microglial cell, TGFβ1 inhibits IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation
  and iNOS expression via a MKP-1-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2. MKP-1 may also modulate
  the ERK1/2-promoted superoxide production.
