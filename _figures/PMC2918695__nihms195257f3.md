caption: The HER2 signaling pathway. Following ligand dependent activation of HER
  receptor, HER2 dimerizes with the activated HER receptor which results in tyrosine
  residues phosphorylation and signal transduction. PLCγ, PI3K and MAPK are the most
  common signaling cascades, whereas PI3K and MAPK are the major pathways involved
  in tumor growth and antiapoptosis.
