caption: 'Architecture of a signaling network that accounts for the relation between
  the effects of insulin, ATIC, and ATP level. Insulin inputs in a double incoherent
  mode: IR autophosphorylation plus PTPLAD1 recruitment at the cell surface (1) are
  converted into robust oscillations in output through the overlay of two positive
  feedback systems with delay driven by the metabolic enzyme ATIC (2). A local interacting
  loop counteracting the action of PTPLAD1 (3). Adenylates production. Variations
  in ATIC levels or in adenylates synthesis or a decline in ATP levels independent
  of de novo purine biosynthesis increase the AMPK activity and IR endocytosis.'
