caption: 'This network reveals the genes involved in TAG biosynthesis pathway in N.oceanica
  IMET1, as well as those TFs predicted to regulate these genes. Each colorized cylinder
  represents a TF. Red lines: “up-regulated”. Blue lines: “down-regulated”. Abbreviations:
  ACBP, Acyl-CoA-binding proteins; KAS, 3-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase; FAS-1,Type I 3-Ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase; ENR, Enoyl-ACP reductase; LCFACS, Long chain acyl-CoA synthetases; LPAT,
  Lysophospholipid acyltransferase; PAP, Phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DGAT, Diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase.'
