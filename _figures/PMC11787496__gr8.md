caption: A proposed working model of how the H. pylori infection-induced NF-kB signaling
  pathway upregulates SOD2, leading to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway
  involved in gastric tumorigenesis, as well as insensitivity to ferroptosis signaling
  contributing to resistance to 5-FU in GC cells
