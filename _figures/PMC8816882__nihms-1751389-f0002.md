caption: Schematic diagram of programmed cell death pathways. The key components of
  apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis signaling pathways are shown.
  The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is primarily regulated by proteins of the Bcl family
  bound to the mitochondrial membrane, including Bcl-2/BclxL and BH3-only proteins,
  which function as antiapoptotic or proapoptotic regulatory proteins, respectively.
  Once activated, Bax and Bak are oligomerized and then act on mitochondria to induce
  the release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c then binds APAF-1 to activate caspase-9.
  Caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 into mature caspase-3, which is the effector protein
  that executes apoptosis. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated by death factor
  receptors such as FasL, TNF-α, and TRAIL after binding with their corresponding
  ligands. Once activated, death factor receptors recruit FADD through death effector
  domains to form DISC complexes, and procaspase-8 can be cleaved into mature caspase-8.
  Caspase-8 activates caspase-3 to execute apoptosis. Necroptosis is primarily regulated
  via the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL axis. Upon caspase-8 inhibition, RIPK1 binds with RIPK3
  to form a functional heterodimer complex, which activates MLKL to promote necroptosis.
  Inflammatory caspases execute pyroptosis upon the initiation of canonical (i.e.,
  mediated by the inflammasome and caspase-1) or noncanonical (i.e., mediated by caspase-4/5/11)
  mechanisms. Both pathways activate GSDMD cleavage. Truncated GSDMD translocates
  to the membrane and forms pores to release cytoplasmic components of the cell. This
  unleashes a local inflammatory cascade. Ferroptosis is mediated by lipid peroxide.
  GPX4 functions as a reductase in the presence of cofactor GSH to reduce toxic lipid
  peroxide (PE-OOH) to nontoxic lipid alcohol (PE-OH). xCT is a cystine/glutamate
  antiporter that regulates the production of GSH.
