caption: '(A) The differentially expressed genes in GFT505 (30mpk) group, compared
  with vehicle group. Red dots represent up-regulated DEGs, the green dots represent
  down-regulated DEGs, and blue dots represent non-DEGs. A total of 7571 unigenes
  were identified as DEGs (p < 0.005 and log2 [fold change] > 1) between treatment
  and vehicle group. (B) KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs. Top 20 significantly enriched
  KEGG pathway. (C) DEGs enriched in “PPAR Signaling pathway”. (D), DEGs enriched
  in “ECM-Receptor interaction”. Vehicle and GFT505 group: CDAHFD diet. DEGs, Differentially
