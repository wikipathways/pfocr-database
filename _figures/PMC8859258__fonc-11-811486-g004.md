caption: Cellular signalling pathway crosstalk induced by IL-1 for sPLA2-IIA expression.
  IL-1 induce transcription and secretion of sPLA2-IIA through a mechanism involving
  the MAPK. A few hours after the enzyme secretion, the signalling pathway is followed
  by the generation of prostanoids. The induction process is time-dependent and generally
  occurs after an initial lag period of about 8 h. Both IL-1 and TNF-α stimulate gene
  transcription and stabilize its RNA. In certain cells, such as for example macrophages,
  the expression sPLA2-IIA is strongly induced by the two cytokines stimulation under
  lipopolysaccharides (LPS) action. The MAPK cascade is activated in response to several
  cytokines, in particular TNF-α and IL-1, and is associated with the activation of
  nuclear transcriptional factor kB (NF-kB) and several serine/treonin kinases. TNF-α
  and IL-1 initiates the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin from the plasma membrane. The
  formed ceramide activates a specific protein kinase (CAPK) on which the MAPK cascade
  initiation relies on. While the MAPK pathway occurs in the cytosol, the processes
  that initiate it take place inside the plasma membrane.
