caption: Oxidative stress from dysregulated NOX activation and mitochondrial dysfunction
  regulates the signaling pathways involved in initiating and maintaining AF. The
  hyperactivation of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 can regulate various signaling pathways
  in the heart that are involved in the initiation and maintenance of AF. When NOX1
  levels/activity are increased, it can lead to microvascular dysfunction in diastolic
  dysfunction and metabolic syndrome, risk factors for AF. Excess NOX2 activity triggers
  the onset of AF and is linked to myofibril damage and decreased connexin expression.
  Additionally, NOX2 can activate PKCε and increase the constitutively active form
  of acetylcholine-dependent K+ current (IKAch). Increased NOX2 expression is associated
  with reduced cardiac channel expression (INa) and atrial APD in pacing-induced AF
  in diet-induced obese mice. Potassium channel expression (Kv1.5) and current (IKur)
  were significantly increased. Baseline serum NOX4 levels in patients with AF have
  a significant independent association with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF.
  RyR2 oxidation, diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, and increased NOX2 and NOX4 expression are
  causatively associated with AF. NOX4 can also induce CaMKII activation, which increases
  susceptibility to AF. Tachypacing-induced Ca+-handling abnormalities in HL-1 myocytes
  are mediated by NOX2/NOX4-induced HAS/HA/CD44 signaling pathway. NOX4 and CD44 increase
  atrial fibrosis and susceptibility to AF. Cardiomyocytes from patients with AF exhibit
  increased levels of ROS in the mitochondria, structural abnormalities, impaired
  function, decreased ATP production, and reduced expression of enzymes involved in
  fatty acid utilization and glycolysis. These mitochondrial dysfunctions and myocardial
  oxidative stress contribute to shortened APDs, which lead to reentry.
