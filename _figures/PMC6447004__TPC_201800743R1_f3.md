caption: 'Reducing THI4 Turnover, Reconfiguring Lignin Synthesis, and Suppressing
  Futile Cycles.(A) Plants synthesize the thiazole phosphate precursor of thiamin
  from NAD and Gly via a suicidal THI4 enzyme that takes the sulfur atom needed for
  the thiazole ring from an active-site Cys residue. This converts the Cys to dehydroalanine
  (DHAla), which inactivates THI4 (). Plant THI4 proteins must consequently be completely
  degraded and resynthesized after mediating a single reaction. Certain prokaryotes
  such as Methanococcus jannaschii have THI4s with a His residue in place of the active-site
  Cys (shown in sequence alignment with Arabidopsis THI4) that use free sulfide as
  sulfur donor (). These prokaryotic THI4s are true catalysts, i.e., they perform
  multiple reaction cycles and so make thiazole synthesis far less energetically expensive
  than when a suicidal THI4 is used.(B) Alternative plant pathways for conversion
  of arogenate to 4-coumarate, a precursor to lignin. The reaction set involving Phe,
  which oxidizes one NADPH per 4-coumarate formed, is found in all plants, but the
  alternative pathway via Tyr, which reduces one NADP per 4-coumarate formed, is found
  predominantly in monocots. The overall efficiency of lignin biosynthesis via Tyr
  is expected to be significantly greater than that of the more common pathway via
  Phe because of a net reduction in NADPH use.(C) Futile cycling between Suc synthesis
  and degradation, highlighting ATP-consuming processes. Suc is synthesized via Suc
  phosphate synthase (SPS, blue) and sucrose 6-phosphate phosphatase (SPP) and degraded
  and metabolised either via sucrose synthase (SuSy, green), UDP Glc pyrophosphorylase
  (UGPase), and fructokinase (FK) or via invertase (INV, purple), hexokinase (HK),
  and FK. Suc synthesis from two hexose phosphates requires one UTP per Suc, with
  one PPi being salvaged (not shown). Suc degradation via SuSy requires one PPi per
  Suc (UTP is internally recycled; not shown). Suc degradation via INV requires two
  ATP per Suc, plus additional energy for active transport steps (not shown). In the
  futile cycles, net energy loss is one ATP per Suc in the cycle with SuSY, UGPase
  and INV, and two ATP per Suc in the cycle with INV, HK, and FK. It is assumed that
  FK utilizes UTP and/or that the uridine and adenine nucleotide systems are equilibrated
  via nucleoside diphosphate dikinase (). For simplicity, transport steps needed when
  INV is located in the vacuole or apoplast are omitted. The rate of cycling can be
  measured by analyzing labeling patterns after supplying isotopically labeled Suc,
  Fru, and Glc.(D) Futile cycling between fructose-6P and fructose-1,6BP. This cycle
  can occur due to simultaneous activity of two of these three enzymes: ATP-phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), fructosebisphosphatase (FBPase), and pyrophosphate fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase
  (PFP). PFP (blue) catalyzes a readily reversible reaction. Net energy loss per cycle
  per unit fructose-6P is one ATP for the cycle between PFK and FBPase, the difference
  in free energy between one ATP and one PPi for the cycle between PFK and PFP, and
  one PPi for the cycle between PPi and FBPase. Cycling between fructose-6P and fructose-1,6BP
  can be measured as randomization of 14C or 13C label between the carbon-1 and carbon-6
  positions.'
