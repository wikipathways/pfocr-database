caption: A proposed model of keloid disorder showing embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like
  cells within keloid-associated lymphoid tissues (KALTs), regulated by a microenvironmental
  niche with resultant proliferation and accumulation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
  in the keloid lesion (KL) via a mesenchymal stem cell intermediate through an endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (endoMT). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in
  the microenvironmental niche with complex interactions with the immune system/inflammation,
  vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency (VDD), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and hypertension.
  VDD which is caused by reduced sunlight/UVB radiation, and leads to increased RAS
  activity and the resultant hypertension. VDD also directly leads to hypertension.
  Increased RAS activity also activates the immune system. The complex interactions
  between these elements lead to activation of various pro-fibroproliferative signaling
  pathways leading to generation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Hypertension has
  a direct pro-fibroproliferative effect and contributes to the conducive microenvironment
  for the ESC-like cells within the KALTs. VDD increases RAS activity, with activation
  of the immune system/inflammation leading to an altered microenvironmental niche
  via the IL-6 and IL-17 axis. This increased RAS activity activates TGF-β/Smad signaling
  to promote EndoMT. Binding of vitamin D to VDR results in a genomic effect which
  counteracts the pro-fibroproliferative signaling pathways. VDR transcriptional activity
  inhibits keloid fibroblast proliferation. VDR transcriptional activity also inhibits
  the pro-fibroproliferative TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, down-regulates genes for
  EndoMT, and so may influence the formation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within
  KLs. ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MMP-1, matrix
  metalloproteinase-1; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1; IL, interleukin;
  UVB, ultraviolet B; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. “+” signifies a positive
  effect; “–” signifies a negative effect. For further information refer to “The Role
  of the Renin-Angiotensin System and Vitamin D in Keloid Disorder — A Review” ().
