caption: Overview of cold-induced thermogenesis through Thermo-TRPs—SNS—gut microbiota—thermogenesis
  axis and thyroid—gut microbiota—thermogenesis axis. Cold is sensed by the thermosensitive
  transient receptor potential channels (Thermo-TRPs) on the skin and in the brain
  and other organs. Cold signal is transmitted through the sensory afferent nerve
  to the preoptic area (POA) in the hypothalamus and other thermoeffector efferent
  circuits, and leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to
  release norepinephrine (NE) and stimulate mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)
  through β3 adrenergic receptors (β3-AR) and activation of PKA signaling pathway
  in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In parallel with the direct effect of NE on thermogenesis,
  the gut microbiota community is reconstructed through sensing cold signal or neuroactive
  signal of NE and, consequently, leads to increases in bacterial metabolites (short-chain
  fatty acids, SCFAs) and byproducts (secondary bile acids, SBAs). Both SCFAs and
  SBAs, via acting on their respective G protein-coupled receptors GPR43 and TGR5,
  can stimulate BAT nonshivering thermogenesis (NST). Moreover, the circulating bioactive
  tri-iodothyronine (T3) level increases after the brain receives cold signal, and
  promotes obligatory (basal metabolic rate, BMR) and regulatory thermogenesis. T3-induced
  thermogenesis is also mediated by bacterial metabolites (SCFAs) and byproducts (such
  as SBAs and lipopolysaccharides, LPS). The binding of SBAs-TGR5 or LPS-TLR4 (Toll-like
  receptor 4) can activate UCP1 expression in BAT, and stimulate local type 2 deiodinase
  (D2) to induce the conversion from the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to bioactive T3
  as well. The binding of NE with β1,2,3-AR in white adipose tissue (WAT) activates
  lipolysis (catabolism of triglycerides) into free fatty acids as one source of fuel
  for BAT thermogenesis, leading to the decrease in body fat content. Cold-induced
  glucose uptake via glucose transporter (GLUT4) in adipocytes and muscle can also
  provide glucose as fuel for BAT and muscle thermogenesis. Muscle NST is mainly based
  on activities of sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca2+-leak,
  sarcolipin (SLN)-activated sarcoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and mitochondrial
  UCP3 as well. SLN, via binding to SERCA, can uncouple ATP hydrolysis from Ca2+ transportation
  and as a result increase heat production.
