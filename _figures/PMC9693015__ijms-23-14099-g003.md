caption: Overview of wheat responses to spring cold stress, which induces several
  protective measures to regulate grain setting and quality. Firstly, cold stress
  triggers multiple channel activation leading to the increased ABA, Ca2+ and ROS
  concentrations in the cytosol. The main components in the core ABA signaling transduction
  pathway include ABA receptor TaPYL5, TaPP2C, TaSnRKs, and the Ca2+signaling transduction
  pathway include TaCDPKs, TaCML, TaCaM, which have a positive regulation of cold
  stress. Secondly, component changes in the MAPK cascade pathway were influenced
  by the activation of the ABA, ROS and Ca2+pathway. Thirdly, cold stress response-induced
  signal transduction leads to the activation of multiple transcription factors, thereby
  regulating the metabolic hormone, protein, sucrose and antioxidant pathway. These
  alterations mitigate cell membrane damage and regulate intracellular osmotic balance,
  preventing the loss of grain yield and quality.
