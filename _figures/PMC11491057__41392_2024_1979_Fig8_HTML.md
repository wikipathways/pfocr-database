caption: Nanoparticle-Mediated Tumor Microenvironment Intrinsic Immunomodulation Enhancing
  Cancer Immunotherapy. Engineered nanoparticles administered via subcutaneous or
  intravenous injection are internalized by either innate immune cells or tumor cells,
  releasing various payloads in lymph nodes, the tumor immune microenvironment, and
  vasculature. Nanoparticles possess the capacity to selectively target innate immune
  pathways, thereby augmenting innate immune responses against cancer. This is primarily
  due to the stimulation of innate immune cells by released agonists/antigens. This
  stimulation initiates the secretion of pro-immunogenic cytokines downstream, which
  subsequently enhances T-cell activation and infiltration in lymph node. Consequently,
  this process enhances the anti-tumoral immune responses of cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  (CTLs). Furthermore, nanoparticles effectively modulate the immunosuppressive tumor
  microenvironment (TME), improving tumors’ sensitivity to immunotherapy by engaging
  in specific interactions with innate immune cells. This includes elevating the presence
  of neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells at tumor sites, diminishing the functions
  of M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), transforming M2
  macrophages into the M1 phenotype, and inciting the activation of NK cells. In this
  context, red arrows represent promotion, while black bars symbolize inhibition.
