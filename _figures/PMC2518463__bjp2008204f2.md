caption: Binding of specific signalling proteins to phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  on KIT following receptor activation and the subsequent signalling events leading
  to mast cell responses. For clarity, only one receptor is shown in the figure. SCF-induced
  KIT dimerization enhances the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the split
  catalytic domain. This results in phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues
  within the cytosolic domain of KIT. The tyrosine kinase, Lyn, may also contribute
  to this response. The consequential recruitment of critical signalling molecules
  such as the tyrosine kinases, Lyn and Fyn, the adaptor molecules, SHC and Grb2 and
  the signalling enzymes, PI3K and phospholipase Cγ, results in the activation of
  the Ras–Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the enhancement of
  intracellular calcium levels, and the activation of transcription factors leading
  to mast cell growth, differentiation and survival; enhanced cell migration and chemotaxis;
  and cytokine production. Activation of the JAK2 and STAT1/3/5 likely contributes
  to these responses. Concurrent with these events, KIT induces activation of the
  Tec kinase Btk and the adaptor molecule NTAL (non-T-cell activation linker), resulting
  in an enhancement of antigen-mediated degranulation and cytokine production. (For
