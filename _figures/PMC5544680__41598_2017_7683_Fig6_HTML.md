caption: Schematic illustration of the role of EDN/EDNRB signaling in epilation-induced
  skin and hair pigmentation. After epilation, expression of EDNs is increased in
  epidermis, secondary hair germ and dermal papilla. McSCs respond to the increased
  EDNs secreted from surrounding cells, resulting in activation of the EDNRB signaling
  pathway. As a result, McSCs proliferate, likely migrate along the hair follicles
  into epidermis and differentiate into mature melanocytes for melanogenesis. Epi,
  epidermis; DP, dermal papilla; HS, hair shaft; sHG, secondary hair germ.
