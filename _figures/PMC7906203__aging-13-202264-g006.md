caption: Schematic representation of the mechanistic role of TAMs in PDAC progression.
  In the tumor microenvironment, TAMs secrete TGF-β, which binds to the TGF-β receptors
  on the surface of PDAC cells and activates the TGF-β signaling pathway. This includes
  translocation of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (transcription factor) into the nucleus
  from the cytoplasm. The phospho-Smad2/3/4 complex upregulates Snail, a key transcriptional
  factor required for the expression of EMT-related genes. Subsequently, EMT promotes
  metastasis of PDAC cells.
