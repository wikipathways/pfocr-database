caption: 'Sleep deprivation increases PDE4A5 protein levels that cause a reduction
  in cAMP levels and attenuation of the PKA-LIMK signaling pathway, which results
  in a reduction in the phosphorylation of cofilin. Dephosphorylated cofilin can lead
  to spine loss. Suppressing PDE4A5 function through viral expression of a catalytically
  inactive PDE4A5 prevents alterations in LIMK and cofilin signaling as well as the
  cognitive impairments caused by sleep deprivation. Likewise, attenuating cofilin
  activity through viral expression of a catalytically inactive form of cofilin prevents
  the loss of dendritic spines, impairments in synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits
  associated with sleep loss. Proteins whose function is reduced after sleep deprivation
  are shown in blue. Proteins whose function is promoted by sleep deprivation are
  shown in red.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13424.022'
