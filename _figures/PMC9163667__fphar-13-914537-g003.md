caption: The potential implications of Wnt/β-catenin among cells from ischemic brain.
  After an ischemia incident, the microenvironment in ischemic brain leads to decreased
  activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The regulatory mechanisms of which
  include increased level of Dkks and sFRPs, which leads to increased BBB disruption,
  neuronal apoptosis, demyelination, and overactivation of microglia.
