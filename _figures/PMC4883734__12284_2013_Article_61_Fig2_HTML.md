caption: Overall signaling pathway in rice during salt stress. Salt stress evokes
  both osmotic and ionic stress. Osmotic stress signaling is transduced via ABA-dependent
  or ABA-independent pathway. ABA dependent pathway includes mitogen activated protein
  kinase (MAP Kinase) cascades, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), receptor-like
  kinases (RLK), SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK), transcription factors (OsRAB1,
  MYC/MYB and OsNAC/SNAC) and micro RNAs. ABA-independent pathway includes transcription
  factors (OsDREB1 and OsDREB2) and stress related genes (OsPSY1, OsNCEDs). Ionic
  stress does signaling via Ca2+/PLC pathway and salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway
  and Calmodulin (CaM) pathway. Ca2+ is sensed by Ca2+ sensor (OsCBL4) and the sensor
  activates calcineurin B-like protein kinase (OsCIPK24), which in turns activates
  Na+/H+ antiporter (OsSOS1), H+/Ca+ antiporter (OsCAX1), vacuolar H+/ATPase, vacuolar
  Na+/H+ exchangers (OsNHX1) and suppress K+/Na+ symporter (OsHKT1) to maintain ionic
  homeostasis under salt stress. Ca2+ also activates calmodulin (OsMSR2) which also
  activates vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger (OsNHX1). Blue arrow indicates ABA dependent
  pathway, green arrow shows ABA-independent pathway, violet arrow shows ROS pathway,
  red arrow shows Ca2+/PLC pathway and orange arrow shows SOS pathway.
