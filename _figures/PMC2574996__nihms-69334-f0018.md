  (). Also, we hoped an alternate benzylic alcohol substrate would lead to improved
  mass recovery in the oxidative kinetic resolution. To this end, reduction of hydroxyester
  (±)-15 was followed by selective silylation of the primary alcohol to afford alcohol
  (±)-37. Oxidative kinetic resolution of this alcohol proved highly selective (selectivity
  factor s>47), providing highly enantioenriched alcohol (−)-37. Interestingly, resolutions
  that were allowed to proceed to high ee of (−)-37 did not afford any of the expected
  ketone (+)-39. Instead, diketone (−)-38 was formed in good yield and high ee. Monitoring
  of the reaction demonstrated that the ketone (+)-39 was being generated, but it
  slowly underwent further oxidation to the diketone (−)-38. In fact, isolated samples
  of ketone 39 were slowly oxidized to the diketone in C6D6. Handling of this ketone
  under argon delayed this oxidative decomposition. We hypothesized that ketone (+)-39
  was reacting with molecular oxygen via a radical pathway to afford the diketone
  (−)-38. This hypothesis is supported by our observations on non-enantioselective
  oxidations performed on alcohol (±)-37. Thus, oxidation of (±)-37 with Dess-Martin
  periodinane cleanly provided ketone (±)-39, while diketone (±)-38 was obtained when
  either MnO2 or Pd(OAc)2/O2 was employed as the oxidant. We therefore screened various
  radical inhibitors as additives in kinetic resolutions of alcohol (±)-37. Tetracyanoethylene
  led to little alcohol oxidation. Neither BHT nor 2-methyl-2-butene suppressed ketone
  overoxidation; however, incorporation of even catalytic quantities of 2-methyl-2-butene
  enhanced mass recovery and improved selectivity in the kinetic resolution. While
  the role of 2-methyl-2-butene is not yet clear, it was included in our preparative
  experiments because of its beneficial effect. Thus, under our optimized conditions,
  (±)-37 was resolved with Pd(sparteine)Cl2 as a catalyst in the presence of O2 to
  99% ee and was isolated in 47% yield (94% of the theoretical maximum).
