caption: 'Summary of metabolites altered in Hgd−/− mouse urine grouped by their associated
  pathways. Left: the tyrosine degradation pathway showing lack of the enzyme HGD
  in AKU and the consequential increase in HGA. Right (boxes): observed metabolite
  alterations grouped by pathway; red and blue indicate increased and decreased abundance
  respectively. Tyrosine metabolites, including HGA and HGA biotransformation products,
  were elevated. Metabolites associated with the TCA cycle were decreased. A combination
  of increased and decreased abundance was observed for purine pathway metabolites.'
