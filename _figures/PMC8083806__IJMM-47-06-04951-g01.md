caption: Pathways and processes of inflammatory responses induced by IL36RN, CARD14,
  AP1S3 and MPO genes. Loss-of-function mutations in both IL36RN and MPO genes cause
  upregulation of IL-36 signaling, the former result in the inability of IL-36Ra to
  antagonize and limit the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-36, the latter upregulate
  the activity of NE, CTSG and PR3, three serine proteases that cleave IL-36 precursors
  into pro-inflammatory forms. Upregulated IL-36 signaling further activates the downstream
  pro-inflammatory NF-κB and MAPK pathways by binding to IL-36 receptor, further leading
  to secretion of chemokines/cytokines, IL-36, IL-1, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL20,
  from the keratinocyte and resulting in the activation of neutrophils, T cells and
  dendritic cells. Secretion of cytokines also promotes neutrophil-rich, cytokines
  induction, thereby amplifying the pro-inflammatory responses in the skin by two
  inflammatory-related proteins STEAP1 and STEAP4, ultimately forming a vicious cycle
  of enhancing inflammation. In addition, CARD14 gain-of-function mutations and AP1S3
  loss-of-function mutations hyperactivate NF-κB pathway and are involved in the processes
  of inflammatory responses. Red or black arrows, secretion or activation; ┴, inhibition;
