caption: Specific T cell response in Chagas disease. The activation of T-cell immune
  responses is mediated by APCs, which deliver antigen-specific and costimulatory
  signals. Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigote invades the host cell or is passively
  internalized, leading to the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole which fuses
  with a lysosome resulting in a phagolysosome. The parasite can escape to the cytoplasm
  (A) where it differentiates into the amastigote form and its proteins are targeted
  for proteosomal degradation. Peptides generated are then imported into the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to be presented to CD8+ T cells in the context of MHC class I molecules.
  These molecules consists of a β2-microglobulin and a polymorphic alpha chain which
  contains the peptide binding groove and it is encoded by one of the mouse H2-K,
  H2-D and H2-L class I MHC genes and human HLA-A, -B or –C class I MHC genes. (B)
  Class II MHC is made up of polymorphic α and β chains that form the peptide binding
  groove, each encoding in mouse H2-A and H2-E class II MHC loci and in human HLA-DR,
  -DP and -DQ class II MHC loci. In the class II MHC pathway, proteins from parasite
  are degraded and antigenic peptides are loaded onto the binding cleft from the MHC.
  Peptide-MHC complexes are then presented in the host cell surface to the CD4+ T
  cell. In both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, activation generates the expansion and differentiation
  into effector specific T cells (TE), their survival and function being sustained
  by cytokines and soluble mediators. Following antigen clearance, contraction takes
  place with a numerical reduction of antigen-specific cells. A subset of the activated
  T cells survives beyond this phase and differentiates into long-lasting memory T
  cells. During chronic infections, which entail persistent antigen exposure and/or
  inflammation, different degrees of dysfunctionality can be observed, including terminal
  differentiation and T cell exhaustion with progressive loss of effector functions
  and co-expression of inhibitor receptors. IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; TNF,
  tumor necrosis factor; TH, T helper; Treg, regulatory T cell; TSCM, stem cell memory
  T cell.
