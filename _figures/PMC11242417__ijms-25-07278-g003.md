caption: 'Signaling pathways of macrophage polarization. IL-12 activates M1 phenotype
  macrophages through the JAK/TYK2-STAT4 signaling pathway [144,145]. Monocyte-derived
  macrophages activate Notch1 and NF-κB under the stimulation of LPS and toll-like
  receptors, thus polarized M1 macrophages [146,147]. IFN works through the JAK-STAT1
  signaling pathway to induce polarization of M1 macrophages [150]. IL-6 stimulates
  the M1 macrophages via the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway [151]. SOCS1 can inhibit
  the signaling pathways of M1 polarization induced by NF-κB and STAT1 [149]. IL-4/IL-13
  can lead to M2a phenotype via JAK-STAT6 and PI3K [152,153]. LPS and immune complexes
  can activate M2b macrophages through NF-κB signaling pathways [154]. IL-10 can drive
  the M2c activation by the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway [11,155]. TGF-β activates
  the M2c phenotype through the SMAD3 signaling pathway [156]. Active glucocorticoids
  direct M2c polarization by binding to GCR-α, to interact with transcription factors
  including NF-κB and AP1 [32]. TLR signaling is an important trigger for NF-κB activation
  in the M2d activation [157]. IL-6 promotes M2d via the signaling of NF-kB and JAK/STAT3
  pathways [158]. A2AR regulates the expression of M2d-associated chemokines and polarizing
  factors through PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathways [159]. M2f macrophages are stimulated by
  macrophage apoptotic clearance related to phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which
  is mediated by the FcR signaling pathway [160,161]. SOCS3 inhibits STAT3, PI3K,
  and SMAD3 [149]. In this figure, the solid arrow indicates the stimulation of the
  signaling pathways, and the dashed arrow indicates the inhibition of signaling pathways.

    through the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway to induce polarization of M1 macrophages
