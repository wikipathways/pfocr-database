caption: 'The proposed biosynthetic pathway exhibits a multi-modular architecture
  and requires acyl-CoA as the starter unit and malonyl-ACP as the extender unit.
  The KS domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen (CO2) condensation between the
  growing chain and an extender unit attached to the ACP domain (gray circles), whereas
  the AT domain selects and loads an extender unit to the ACP. The oxide-reductase
  that includes the KR and DH domains sequentially reduces the β-keto group to a β-hydroxy
  group and α-double bond. Additional ER domains reduce the α-double bond to a saturated
  product, and TE cleaves the synthesized acyl chain. Enzymatic domains: ACP: acyl
  carrier protein, AT: acyl transferase, KS: ketoacyl synthase, KR: keto reductase,
  DH: dehydratase, ER: enoyl reductase, TE: thioesterase.'
