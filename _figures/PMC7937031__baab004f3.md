caption: Example of automatic reasoning with Protégé. Asserted axioms are shown in
  uncolored lines and inferred axioms are highlighted in yellow. Following automatic
  reasoning, SFRP-WNT heterodimer association is classified as subclass of the ‘protein
  complex formation’ (a*) and ‘reaction involved in WNT signaling pathway’ classes
  (b*), thus it inherits the component_process_of ‘WNT_signaling pathway’ property
  (b**).
