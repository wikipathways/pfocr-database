caption: Proposed protective pathway by E-LP against glutamate-induced apoptosis in
  RGCs. E-LPs protect RGCs from glutamate-induced apoptosis via an LRP1-mediated signaling
  pathway. Glutamate (Glu) induces the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and activates
  calpain and calcineurin (CaN). Calcineurin dephosphorylates phospho (P)-Bax and
  leads to mitochondrion (cytochrome c; Cyt c)-mediated and caspase (Casp)-dependent
  apoptosis. When E-LPs bind to LRP1, the formation of an LRP1-NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
  complex is promoted and attenuates the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused by
  glutamate. Thus, RGCs are protected from neurodegeneration. In addition, binding
  of E-LPs to LRP1 activates phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), and PKCδ then increases the
  phosphorylation (P) of the proapoptotic kinase GSK3β, thereby inactivating GSK3β.
  α2-Macroglobulin (a2M), directly or indirectly, interrupts the protective effect
  of E-LPs. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol.
