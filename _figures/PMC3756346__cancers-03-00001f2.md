caption: A map of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis []. Apoptosis pathways can
  be initiated by different stimuli. The left side shows death receptor ligation at
  the plasma membrane (A), and the right side shows activation at the mitochondria
  (B). Stimulation of the death receptor results in receptor aggregation and recruitment
  of the adaptor molecule FADD and caspase 8. Upon recruitment, caspase 8 becomes
  activated and initiates apoptosis by the direct cleavage of downstream effector
  caspases. The intrinsic pathway can be initiated in mitochondria by stress stimuli
  and is regulated by the balance of the action of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 protein family members. (C) Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and other
  signal transduction molecules are able to diminish the effect of caspase 8 activation.
