caption: 'Model for a negative feedback mechanism of Wnt signal transduction by Gβγ
  signaling. Left panel: In the presence of Wnt, Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin (for canonical
  Wnt signaling) are translocated to membrane-bound Frizzled and LRP, respectively,
  and initiate downstream signaling. Released Gα subunits from Gβγ may then synergistically
  enhance canonical Wnt signaling. During this time if LRP-bound Axin binds the Gβγ
  subunit and blocks the downstream signaling of Gβγ then Dishevelled will not be
  degraded and signaling will continue. Middle panel: Upon further Wnt signaling LRP-bound
  Axin is degraded which leads to release of Gβγ subunits from Axin. Right panel:
  The released Gβγ subunits interact with Dishevelled, which lead to its destruction
  via a signaling pathway including PLC, Ca+2 and PKC. The activation of the Gβγ signaling
  cascade leads to degradation of Dishevelled in lysosomes and thereby turns off Wnt
  signaling.'
