caption: Schematic illustration of the HH signaling pathway. HH is a secreted morphogen
  which acts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. In the absence of HH morphogen,
  Patched1 (Ptc1), a transmembrane protein, inhibits Smoothened (Smo) activity. Inhibition
  of Smo activity by Ptc1 has been hypothesized to involve a second messenger mediated
  mechanism. In the absence of Smo activity, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates
  Gli proteins (a downstream target of HH signaling) leading to the generation of
  repressor Gli (Gli-rep), thereby resulting in inactive HH signaling. The binding
  of the HH morphogen results in loss of Ptc1 activity and subsequent activation of
  Smo activity. Activated Smo then transduces the signal, resulting in the activation
  of Gli2A (Gli-Act) and transcription of downstream targets.
