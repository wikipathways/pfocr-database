caption: The PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway during early T cell development. During the
  highly proliferative stages of thymocyte development, PI3K and mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling
  are required to promote anabolic metabolism to ensure the presence of sufficient
  metabolites. PI3K mediates signals from Notch1, IL7‐R, CXCR4, and the pre‐TCR/TCR.
  How mTORC1 could itself be modulated by these signals remains unclear. mTORC2 and
  its substrate, Akt, also mediate signals from Notch1, IL7‐R, CXCR4, and the pre‐TCR/TCR
  and are required for proliferation and cell survival
