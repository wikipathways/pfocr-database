caption: PIFs integrate light and hormone signaling pathways to modulate growth in
  Arabidopsis.(A, left) PIF1 has an exclusive role in regulating seed germination
  by directly activating RGA and GAI expression that inhibit GA signaling. PIF1 also
  inhibits GA biosynthesis indirectly by activating SOM expression, resulting in inhibition
  of seed germination in the dark. Light-induced degradation of PIF1 promotes seed
  germination. (Right) PIFs physically interact with DELLA proteins and this interaction
  results in inhibition of DNA binding activities of PIFs. DELLA proteins also induce
  degradation of PIFs in darkness and inhibit subsequent growth. (B, left) PIF4 interacts
  with BZR1 and regulates growth in response to BR and light signal. BIN2 phosphorylates
  PIF3 and PIF4 independent of light and promotes their degradation in darkness. However,
  COP1/SPA1 interact with PIF3 and prevent BIN2-mediated phosphorylation and degradation
  in the dark. (Right) PIF4 and PIF5 directly activate BR biosynthetic pathway genes
  to promote growth. (C, left) PIF4 forms a complex with ARF6 and promotes growth
  in response to light and auxin signaling. (Middle) In response to high ambient temperature
  and shade conditions, PIF4/PIF5/PIF7 promote auxin biosynthesis to promote cell
  elongation. (Right) PIF4/PIF5 and possibly other PIFs also activate the expression
  of auxin receptor AFB5 in response to low PAR shade conditions to promote auxin
  signaling and subsequent growth. (D, left) PIF1 directly activates the expression
  of the ABA signaling components (ABI3 and ABI5). PIF1 also interacts with ABI3 and
  the PIF1-ABI3 complex directly inhibits the expression of SOM, which in turn inhibits
  GA biosynthesis to suppress seed germination. (Right) PIF1 and possibly other PIFs
  directly interact with group A bZIP proteins (e.g., ABI5). This interaction regulates
  the DNA binding specificity and target gene selection of PIF1 and possibly other
  PIFs. (E, left) Ethylene signaling factor, EIN3 directly activates the expression
  of PIF3, which in turn binds to DNA along with EIN3 to regulate ethylene signaling
  as well as chlorophyll biosynthesis and growth. (Right) Overexpression of PIF5 activates
  the expression of ACC Synthase (ACS) genes, which results in increased ethylene
  biosynthesis and signaling to modulate growth.
