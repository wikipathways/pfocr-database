caption: Main transporters of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. Once bile
  acids are synthesized in the liver, they are excreted to the bile canaliculus through
  the canalicular bile salt export pump, BSEP, and stored in the gall bladder. Phospholipids
  and cholesterol are transported into the bile by multidrug resistance protein 3
  (MDR3) and ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8 (ABCG5/G8), respectively.
  Bile acids are released into the intestinal lumen upon consumption of a meal to
  facilitate the digestion and absorption of lipids. In the terminal ileum, approximately
  95% of bile acids are reabsorbed, mainly by the apical sodium-dependent bile salt
  transporter, ASBT. Bile acids are subsequently secreted into the portal circulation
  by organic solute transporter-α/β, OST-α/β and recycled to the liver, where they
  are mainly taken up by sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, NTCP. Bile
  acids cycle between the liver and intestine ~10 times/day. Each cycle, ~5% of bile
  acids escapes from reabsorption and is lost in the faeces. Bile acid pool size is
  maintained by signaling via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which induces transcription
  of its target gene small heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP, in turn, inhibits liver
  receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) to reduce
  the expression of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1), encoding
  the first and rate-controlling enzyme in the major bile acid synthesis pathway.
  In addition, activation of FXR in the intestine induces expression of fibroblast
  growth factor 19 (FGF19), which is secreted into the bloodstream and activates the
  fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and its co-receptor β-klotho on hepatocytes,
  leading to inhibition of CYP7A1 expression via incompletely elucidated mechanisms.
