caption: 'The extrinsic or death receptor-mediated pathway is mediated by sequential
  engagement of specific ligands such as FasL, TNF-α, TRAIL, and TWEAK with cognate
  receptors, formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and activation of
  initiator caspases 8 and/or 10. In type I cells, caspase 8 activates effector caspases
  3, 6 or 7, while in type II cells, caspase 8 truncates pro-apoptotic Bid and engages
  the mitochondria. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway is initiated by Bax/Bak-induced
  mitochondrial membrane permabilization and mitochondria-tocytosol release of apoptogenic
  factors in response to apoptotic stimuli such as xenobiotics, reactive oxygen/nitrogen
  species, or UV radiation. The apoptogenic factors mediate caspase-dependent and
  independent apoptotic signaling within the cytosol. Cytochrome c-Apaf-1 apoptosome
  complex activates pro-caspase 9, the initiator caspase for downstream activation
  of caspases 3, 6, or 7 that execute the final steps of apoptosis. The apoptotic
  signal is further enhanced by apoptogenic Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 that neutralize
  caspase inhibitors. In caspase-independent signaling, pro-apoptotic AIF and endonuclease
  G are translocated to the nucleus and induce DNA fragmentation. AIF: apoptosis inducing
  factor; Apaf-1: apoptotic protease-activating factor-1; Bax/Bak, pro-apoptotic proteins;
  Bid, BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein; cyt c: cytochrome c; DISC: death-inducing signaling
  complex; endoG, endonuclease G; FADD: Fas-associated death domain; FasL: Fas ligand;
  IAPs: inhibitors of apoptosis proteins; Omi/HtrA2: high temperature requirement
  A2 serine protease; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases; tBid,
  truncated form of Bid; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand; TRADD: TNF receptor-associated death domain; TRAF-2: TNF receptor-associated
  factor-2.'
