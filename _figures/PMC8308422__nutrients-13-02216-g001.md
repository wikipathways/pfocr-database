caption: 'Impact of vitamin D/VDR signaling at various junctures of lung-centric inflammation
  and immunothrombosis. Experimentally verified inhibitory pathways are indicated
  with red dashed arrows while an ambiguous pathway is indicated with a blue dashed
  arrow. As addressed in the text, VDR signaling inhibits the response of alveolar
  macrophages to viral infection at the level of (1) NFκB signaling and (2) inflammasome
  activation, thereby preventing neutrophil recruitment and activation (3). The impact
  of VDR signaling on NET generation (4) may be context-dependent; VDR can promote
  or inhibit NETs. VDR signaling inhibits thrombosis (5) by interfering with platelet
  function and fibrin generation. VDR: Vitamin D Receptor; NETs: Neutrophil Extracellular
  Traps.'
