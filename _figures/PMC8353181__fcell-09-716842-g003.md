caption: Regulation of liver disease by CXCR4 and its ligand. (A) In toxin-induced
  hepatitis, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promotes the migration of CD4+ and CD8+ cells to
  the liver and induces aggregation of inflammation. (B) CXCL12 is dependent on CXCR4
  to promote the recruitment of CD4+ T cells in NASH, and the NFκB-CXCR4/7 pathway
  further promotes inflammation in NASH by forming Mallory-Denk Bodies (MDB). (C)
  The CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway is involved in the recruitment and homing of immune cells
  in the liver during viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV, and HEV) infection. In HBV, hepatitis
  B virus X protein (HBx) facilitates recruitment via CXCL12 signaling, and CXCR4
  is highly expressed in CD8+ T cells after PEGylated interferon-α (INF-α) treatment
  and inversely correlates with HBV DNA loads. (D) The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promotes
  migration and homing of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stromal
  stem cells (BMSCs), umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), adipose-derived
  stem cells (ADSCs), urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and hematopoietic stem cells
  to the injured liver to ameliorate liver injury and promote liver repair, proliferation
  and regeneration. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by CXCR4 in BMSCs
  could promote cell migration, resulting in better therapeutic effects for liver
  injury. Hypoxia preconditioning promotes the proliferation and migration of USCs
  by inducing CXCR4 signaling, leading to recovery from liver injury. (E) CXCL12 activation
  of CXCR4 promotes hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) differentiation, proliferation,
  activation and contraction via the MAPK, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt and calcium-independent
  pathways, inducing collagen I production with fibrotic effects. CXCR4 HIV promotes
  liver fibrosis by promoting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 on activated HSCs and
  inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HSCs. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis
  induces migration of MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into fibrotic
  liver, aggravating and inhibiting liver fibrosis, respectively. (F) The CXCL12/CXCR4
  axis promotes HCC cells growth, proliferation, metastasis and invasion, and vascular
  mimicry formation via activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathways; and recruits Treg cells to the tumor sites to promote HCC. The
  CXCL12/CXCR4 axis enhances the recruitment of endothelial cells and EPCs to HCC
  and promotes tumor neovascularization. CXCR4 is highly expressed on endothelial
  cells and can be used as a novel vascular marker for vessel sprouting in HCC tissues.
