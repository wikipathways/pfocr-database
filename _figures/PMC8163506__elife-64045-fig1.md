caption: Different pathways are shown in different colors. The demethylation of DMSP
  by DmdA produces MMPA (in purple). The oxidation of DMSP produces DMSOP (in yellow).
  In the lysis pathway (in blue), DMSP lyase DddP, DddL, DddQ, DddW, DddK, DddY, or
  Alma1 converts DMSP to acrylate and DMS, DddD converts DMSP to 3-HP-CoA and DMS,
  using acetyl-CoA as a CoA donor, and the newly identified DddX in this study converts
  DMSP to acryloyl-CoA and DMS, with ATP and CoA as co-substrates. Dotted lines represent
  unconfirmed steps of the DddX DMSP lysis pathway that we propose in this study.
  The protein families of enzymes involved in the first step of each pathway are indicated.
  The protein family of DddX and the products of its catalysis are highlighted in
  red color. THF, tetrahydrofolate; MMPA, methylmercaptopropionate; 3-HP, 3-hydroxypropionate;
  DMSOP, dimethylsulfoxonium propionate; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide.
