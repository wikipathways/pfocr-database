caption: Effects and mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 on migration and invasion of HCC. SQSTM1/p62
  binds to Keap1 and leads to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Keap1, and then
  weakens the specific inhibitory effect of Keap1 on Nrf2. So, Nrf2 is activated and
  enters into the nucleus and then promotes the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, thereby
  promoting the migration and invasion of HCC. That is, SQSTM1/p62 promotes the migration
  and invasion of HCC through the Keap1/Nrf2/MMP2 signaling pathway. Knockout of SQSTM1/p62
  in HCC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system shows an attenuated migration and invasion in
  this manuscript. In addition, the pharmacological (DDP) or pathological (LPS) regulation
  in SQSTM1/p62 levels can affect the migration and invasion of HCC cells. So, SQSTM1/p62
  plays a key role in the migration and invasion of HCC and may be developed into
  an effective intervention target for cancer cell migration and invasion.

  description: Effects and mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 on migration and invasion of HCC.
    SQSTM1/p62 binds to Keap1 and leads to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Keap1,

    promotes the migration and invasion of HCC through the Keap1/Nrf2/MMP2 signaling

    migration and invasion in this manuscript. In addition, the pharmacological (DDP)
    or pathological (LPS) regulation in SQSTM1/p62 levels can affect the migration
    and invasion of HCC cells. So, SQSTM1/p62 plays a key role in the migration and
