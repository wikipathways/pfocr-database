caption: A proposed mechanism by which hyperaldosteronism decreases pulmonary endothelial
  eNOS activation and NO• generation in PAH. Hyperaldosteronism (ALDO) in pulmonary
  arterial hypertension (PAH) may occur via i) endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated activation
  of PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)/steroidogenesis factor-1 (SF) to increase CYP11B2
  (aldosterone synthase) gene transcription in HPAECs, and/or ii) upregulation of
  adrenal ALDO synthesis via ET-1 and/or overactivation of the renin-angiotensin pathway.
  Stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in HPAECs by ALDO activates NADPH
  oxidase type 4 (NOX4) to increase levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which, in
  turn, oxidatively modifies redox sensitive, functional cysteinyl thiol(s) in the
  ETB receptor (Cys405) to impair ETB-dependent activation of eNOS and decrease synthesis
  of nitric oxide (NO•). eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; R-SOXH, higher oxidative
  intermediaries of cysteine.
