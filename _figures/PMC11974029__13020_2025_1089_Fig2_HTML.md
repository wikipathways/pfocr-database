caption: Mechanisms by which capsaicin treat NSCLC involve modulation of the ERCC1
  enzyme in the NER pathway. Capsaicin effectively regulates ERCC1 expression through
  its binding to the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 receptor,
  thereby initiating downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt, ultimately
  leading to an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration. Additionally,
  capsaicin inhibits ERCC1 expression by activating transcription factors including
  NF-κB and p53. Furthermore, capsaicin induces oxidative stress resulting in the
  generation of substantial amounts of free radicals and ROS, consequently causing
  DNA damage within cancer carcinoma
