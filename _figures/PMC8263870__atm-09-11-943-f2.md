caption: Metabolic pathway and mechanism of Temozolomide (TMZ). (A) TMZ can easily
  penetrates the BBB with 100% bioavailability. Then under the physiological conditions
  of pH >7, TMZ is hydrolyzed into 5-(3-methyl triazene-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide
  (MTIC). MTIC is an active metabolite that is unstable and can be further degraded
  to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and methylated diazo cation. AIC can be
  excreted by the kidneys, while methylated diazo cations methylate adenine at N3
  and guanine at O6 and N7. (B) O6-methylguanine plays an important role in the antitumor
  effect of TMZ by leading to the continuous collapse of the replication fork. O6-methylguanine
  prevents replication and transcription of DNA by pairing with thymidine during base
  pairing, thus activating the mismatch repair (MMR) of DNA. MMR recognizes mismatched
  thymine on the newly synthesized DNA strand and excises it while O6-methylguanine
  remains on the template strand, leading to a continuous break in the DNA strands.
