caption: Hypothetical model for the proposed anti-inflammatory role of MUC1 in response
  to P. aeruginosa lung infection. (1) Flagellin engagement of TLR5 triggers a canonical
  MyD88 → IRAK1/4 → TRAF6 → TAK1 → NF-κB-signaling pathway to generate an early proinflammatory
  response with increased IL-8 production; (2) Inhaled P. aeruginosa activates alveolar
  macrophages (Mφ) to release TNF, which increases MUC1 expression by airway epithelial
  cells (AEC) through a TNFR → MEK1/2 → ERK1 → Sp1 pathway; (3) P. aeruginosa stimulation
  of AEC drives TGF-α release; (4) TGF-α binding to EGFR stimulates phosphorylation
  of the MUC1-CT at its tyrosine46 residue; (5) Phosphorylated MUC1-CT binds to the
  intracellular domain of TLR5, thereby blocking recruitment of MyD88 to TLR5, inhibiting
  inflammatory signaling, and contributing to the later resolution of inflammation.
