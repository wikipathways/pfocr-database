caption: PD1-dependent inhibitory mechanisms. (A) The figure represents PD1-dependent
  proximal inhibitory mechanisms, which depend on the recruitment of SHP1 and SHP2
  phosphatases. These phosphatases inhibit ZAP70 and PI3K activities (blue arrows).
  Consequently, downstream intracellular pathways are also terminated, as exemplified
  in the figure with, AKT, ERK and PKCƟ. (B) Indirect inhibitory mechanisms over TCR
  signaling and T cell proliferation are shown trigged by the regulation of CK2 expression.
  The PI3K-dependent signaling pathway activates CDK2 and inhibits SMAD3-depending
  gene expression as shown. Briefly, PIP3 activates AKT which enhances ubiquitin ligase
  SCFskp2 that degrades the CDK2 inhibitor p27Kip1. Activated CDK2 triggers cell cycle
  progression and inactivates SMAD3 by phosphorylation. These pathways are negatively
  regulated by the PTEN phosphatase that degrades PIP3. During TCR activation CK2
  phosphorylates PTEN with resulting decrease in its activities. When PD1 is engaged
  PTEN phosphatase activity is active dephosphorylating PIP3, and therefore CK2 expression
  and activities decrease. (C) Regulation of TCR surface expression by PD1 engagement.
  PD1 engagement promotes expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases of the CBL family, as
  shown. These ubiquitin ligases ubiquitylate TCR chains and associated kinases, such
  as ZAP-70 and PI3K, leading to TRC signaling termination and the removal of TCRs
  from the T cell surface.
