caption: Genetic Model of Interactions between Sugar and Hormone Signaling in Arabidopsis.The
  gin phenotype (shown in ) is mimicked by ethylene precursor treatment of wild-type
  plants and is displayed in constitutive ethylene biosynthesis (eto1) and constitutive
  ethylene signaling (ctr1) mutants, whereas the ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-1
  and ein2 exhibit the glo phenotype (shown in ). Epistasis analysis with the gin1
  etr1 and gin1 ein2 double mutants puts GIN1 downstream of the ETR1 receptor and
  EIN2 (; W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data). Thus, Glc and ethylene signaling
  pathways antagonize each other (; W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data). However,
  the triple response is not affected by Glc. The gin1, sis4, and isi4 mutants are
  allelic to aba2 (; ; W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data). ABA2 encodes a
  short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR1) that is involved in the second to last
  step of ABA biosynthesis (; W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data; P.L. Rodríguez,
  personal communication; ) and is controlled directly by Glc (W.-H. Cheng and J.
  Sheen, unpublished data). Other ABA-deficient mutants (aba1-1, aba2-1, and aba3-2)
  also are Glc insensitive (; ; ). ABA1 and ABA3 are important for ABA biosynthesis
  and are regulated directly by Glc (W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data).
  Characterization of the gin5 mutant shows the requirement of Glc-specific ABA accumulation
  for HXK-mediated Glc signaling (). In addition, gin6, sun6, sis5, and isi3 are allelic
  to abi4, an ABA-insensitive mutant (; ; ; ). Glc activation of ABI4, which encodes
  an AP2 domain transcription factor (), requires ABA, although ABI4 is not induced
  by ABA directly (; ; W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen, unpublished data). The abi5 mutant
  also is Glc insensitive. Glc activates ABI5 directly (W.-H. Cheng and J. Sheen,
  unpublished data), encoding a basic Leu zipper transcription factor (). However,
  other ABA-insensitive signaling mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1, and abi3-1) do not exhibit
  the gin phenotype, as do abi4 and abi5 mutants (; ; ), suggesting that a distinct
  ABA signaling pathway is involved in Glc signaling. In summary, Glc activates ABA
  biosynthesis and ABA signaling, and both antagonize ethylene signaling (W.-H. Cheng
  and J. Sheen, unpublished data). It remains possible that Glc also inhibits ethylene
  signaling directly. The AtHXK1 mutant (gin2) affects ABA and ethylene signaling
  but also displays reduced sensitivity to auxin and increased sensitivity to cytokinin
  (L. Zhou and J. Sheen, unpublished data).
