caption: The plasminogen (Plg)-dependent pathway of foam cell formation. Plg binding
  to Plg receptors (Plg-Rs) activates 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in a plasmin (Plm)-dependent
  manner and leads to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production and secretion by the macrophage
  (i). Secreted LTB4 binds to BLT1 (ii) and activates transcription of the CD36 gene
  (iii), CD36 protein synthesis, and translocation to the cell membrane (iv). The
  increased expression of CD36 facilitates uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein
  (OxLDL) and accumulation of cholesterol within the cells (v). The accumulated sterols
  induce a positive feedback loop for further cholesterol accumulation by enhancing
  the expression many relevant genes, including those for scavenger and phagocytic
  receptors and for the transcription factors that regulate these genes (vi). The
  Plg dependence of this pathway for CD36 expression and foam cell formation can be
  bypassed by exogenous LTB4 (vii). This pathway shows the actions of Plg on a single
  cell, but released LTB4 may affect adjacent cells. ABCA1 indicates ATP-binding cassette
  transporter; CEBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; FcγRI, Fcγ receptor type 1; FcγRII,
  Fcγ receptor type II; and PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.
