caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms of activation of HH signaling in hematological
  cancers. Both paracrine and autocrine activation of HH signaling has been observed
  in hematological cancers (paracrine mainly in CLL and plasma cell myeloma, and both
  paracrine and autocrine in DLBCL). An autocrine mechanism of activation has also
  been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell
  lymphoma (ALKL+ALCL). Activation of PI3K-AKT (activation of other oncogenic pathways
  not shown) contributes to the activation of HH signaling. NPM-ALK in ALK-positive
  ALCL enhances the stability and consequently the transcriptional activity of GLI1
  through activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. Examples of HH inhibitors, either natural
  products or synthetic compounds are shown (red boxes). 5E1 and robotnikinin bind
  and inactivate HH ligands, cyclopamine and GDC-0499 bind and inactivate SMO, and
  GANT-61 and HPI-1 interfere with GLI transcriptional activity.
