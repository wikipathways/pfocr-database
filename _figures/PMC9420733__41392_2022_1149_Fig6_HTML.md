caption: Melanocortin pathway in obesity pathogenesis. The melanocortin pathway consists
  of POMC; melanocortin receptors MC1R-MC5R; and agouti and AgRP. POMC/CART neurons
  in ARC are stimulated by anorexigenic hormones in the third ventricle like GLP-1,
  leptin, CCK, PYY, and 5-HT, while suppressed by orexigenic hormones like Ghrelin,
  ILP-5, and asprosin. Upon stimulation, POMC/CART neurons secrete POMC including
  α-MSH and ACTH. α-MSH is released into the PVN. By interacting with MC4R, α-MSH
  activates PVN neurons and displays anti-obesity effects by inhibiting adipogenesis,
  promoting lipolysis, inducing WAT browning, reducing food intake, and improving
  insulin sensitivity. ACTH released by POMC/CART neurons actions on adipocytes directly
  by binding to MC2R, further promoting lipolysis. However, these effects can be abolished
  by AgRP, which is the endogenous antagonist of POMC and is secreted by AgRP/NPY
  neurons in ARC. Conversely, AgRP/NPY neurons can be stimulated by orexigenic hormones
  in the third ventricle but inhibited by anorexigenic hormones. Notably, POMC/CART
  and AgRP/NPY neurons interact mutually. NPY receptor Y1R is expressed in POMC/CART
  neurons and its activation inhibits POMC neurons in the ARC. In contrast, MC3R expressed
  in AgRP/NPY neurons seems to increase food intake in an “AgRP circuitry”-dependent
  manner
