caption: 'Pathways, including anthocyanin, carotenoid, ascorbic acid and folic acid
  biosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation, are shown. Genes encoding enzymes with
  blue names were significantly differentially expressed among samples, and those
  encoding enzymes with purple names were identified as non-significantly differentially
