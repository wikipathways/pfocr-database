caption: Protein prenylation in growing oocytes affects offspring outcomes. The Mevalonate
  pathway is a core metabolic pathway for cellular processes including producing cholesterol
  and isoprenoid metabolites. Oocytes MVA pathway supports bypass isoprenoid synthesis
  rather than cholesterol biosynthesis during oocyte maturation. Ggps1, the branch
  point enzyme of the mevalonate pathway to synthesize isoprenoid metabolite GGPP
  from FPP, regulates oocytes maturation by enhancing the geranylgeranylation of protein
  that is critical for mitochondrial homeostasis and then affects developmental competence.
  FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; MVA, mevalonate.
