caption: 'In previous studies, the following phenotypes were observed after treatments
  of the transgenic H 6-GFP-DB-CVIL cell line with inhibitors of both isoprenoid biosynthetic
  pathways: Inhibition of the cytosolic MVA pathway by mevinolin (MEV) a specific
  inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) did not exhibit any detectable effect on the
  intracellular localization of the prenylable GFP fusion protein which predominantly
  associated with the plasma membrane (PM), as observed under control conditions.
  Specific inhibition of DXS and DXR, key enzymes in the plastidial MEP pathway by
  oxoclomazone (OC) and fosmidomycin (Fos), respectively, however lead to a dramatic
  mislocalization of the GFP fluorescence (compare main text for more detailed information)
  to the nuclear compartment (N/Nu). A similar effect was observed with compounds
  that interfere with protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (PGGT-1). This differential
  localization of the GFP fusion protein in response to inhibitors of the two coexisting
  routes leading to the synthesis of the universal C5 precursors IPP (and its isomer
  DMAPP) in plants indicates the suitability of this system for screening of compounds
  with potential antimicrobial and herbicidal activities. In the present study this
  potential for drug screening will be addressed by testing novel compounds, specifically
  designed to inhibit DXS and DXR enzyme activity, thereby validating the test system
  (yellow box A). In addition, the impact of various inhibitors targeting enzymes
  involved in the early steps of phytosterol biosynthesis, one of the main routes
  of cytosolic FPP within the plant cell, will be investigated (yellow box B). Finally,
  the effect of post-prenylation inhibitors on the localization/transport of H6-GFP-DB-CVIL
  is addressed, especially in the light of prior experiments aimed at clarifying the
  details of its yet unknown transport to the PM (yellow box C). These experiments
  have to be seen in the context of the fate and intracellular transport of typical
  mammalian isoprenylated proteins, such as members of the RAS family, that play an
  important role in the development of certain varieties of cancer (compare with discussion
  in the main text).'
