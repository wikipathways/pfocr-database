caption: Metabolic pathway of lactate in cells. Glucose is taken up by cells and converted
  to pyruvate through glycolysis. Pyruvate can enter the mitochondria for aerobic
  respiration, producing ATP through the TCA cycle and electron transfer chain. Alternatively,
  under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted into lactate through fermentation,
  which accumulates and can signal inflammatory pathways like NF-κB. Lactate production
  and release are regulated by glycolytic gene expression and affect cellular energy
  homeostasis, supporting various cellular functions. HK2, hexokinase2; PGM, Phosphoglucomutase;
  HAT, histone acetyltransferases; TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle
