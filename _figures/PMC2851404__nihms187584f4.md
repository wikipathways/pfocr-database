caption: 'The decentralized model of endothelial mechanotransduction by shear stress.
  The cytoskeleton has a central role in the transmission of tension changes throughout
  the cell. (A) Direct signaling can occur through deformation of the luminal surface,
  possibly via the glycocalyx. Examples include localized activation of potassium,
  sodium and calcium ion channels, phospholipase activity leading to calcium signaling,
  G-protein activation and caveolar signaling. (B) Mechanotransduction is also mediated
  via junctional signaling: that is, the transmission of forces to intercellular junction
  protein complexes via the cortical and/or filamentous cytoskeleton. VEGFR2 located
  at the luminal surface (see A) or near the junction (see B) can associate with VE-cadherin,
  β-catenin, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase to phosphorylate Akt and the primary
  transmembrane protein at this location, PECAM-1. (C) Cytoskeletal forces are also
  transmitted to adhesion sites. Transmembrane integrins bound to the extracellular
  matrix serve as a focus for deformation. This deformation results in autophosphorylation
  of FAK, which binds the SH2 domain of c-Src, a kinase family that phosphorylates
  paxillin and p130cas and leads to integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinases via
  Ras GTPase. A second parallel integrin-mediated pathway involves the activation
  of Shc, which binds Src family kinases through SH2 domains. Shc phosphorylation
  leads to Ras-MAP kinase activity. Ras releases the trans-acting NFκB from its cytosolic
  inhibitor, and thus enables its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to the
  promoters of multiple target genes. A third integrin-mediated pathway involves rhoA
  activation, which profoundly influences actin assembly and, therefore, transmission
  of mechanical stimuli. The multiple roles of small GTPases in mechanotransduction
  are reviewed in depth by Tzima. (D) Nuclear deformation is also likely to result
  in mechanically induced signaling, possibly via lamins in the nuclear membrane.
  Other possible direct effects include macromolecular conformation changes that are
  relevant to gene regulation. Of note, the locations are based on direct or indirect
  experimental evidence, are not mutually exclusive, and are probably interconnected.
