caption: Figure 1. Model for Ral function in R3/R4 specification. At left are light
  microscope images of a single ommatidium. At right are diagrams of the signaling
  events that distinguish R3 and R4. The top box is wild type (Ral+). Photoreceptors
  in the wild-type adult Drosophila eye (top) are arranged in a trapezoid with R3
  at the apex. The asymmetric arrangement of the originally equivalent R3/R4 pair
  is due to pre-R3 experiencing more Frizzled (Fz) activation than does pre-R4. This
  difference in Fz activity is amplified by subsequent Notch activation in pre-R4.-
  Fz activation results in increased transcription of Delta and neuralized (neur)-
  and also relocalization of a Fz/Dsh (Disheveled) complex that represses Notch receptor
  at the pre-R3 plasma membrane that faces pre-R4. Thus pre-R3 becomes the Delta signaling
  cell and Notch is activated in pre-R4. Ral defines a unique pathway for insuring
  that pre-R3 becomes the Delta signaling cell.Ral transcription also depends on Fz,
  and Ral activity prevents activation of Notch receptor that is not bound to ligand.
  Loss of Ral activity (bottom) results in symmetric R3/R4 pairs and ligand-independent
  Notch activation.
