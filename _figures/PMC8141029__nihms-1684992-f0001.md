caption: '(A) Immunoblots of HeLa cells grown in the absence of serum and treated
  for 24 hours with insulin (500 nM) in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or rapamycin
  (20 nM).(B, C) Steady-state metabolite profiles of wild-type HeLa cells grown in
  the absence of serum and treated with vehicle, insulin (500 nM, 24 hours) or rapamycin
  (20 nM, 24 hours). Intracellular metabolites from three independent samples per
  condition were profiled by LC-MS/MS, and those significantly increased in insulin-treated
  cells compared to vehicle cells (B) or decreased with rapamycin-treated cells (C)
  are shown as row-normalized heat maps ranked according to p-value.(D) Pathway Impact
  analysis of steady-state metabolite profiling presented in (B, C).(E) Corresponding
  immunoblots and normalized peak area of methionine cycle intermediates measured
  by LC-MS/MS in serum-starved wild-type or ΔTSC2 HeLa cells treated with vehicle
  (DMSO) or rapamycin (20 nM, 15 hours).(F) Indicated metabolites measured as in (E),
  but ΔTSC2 HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting RAPTOR or nontargeting
  controls (siCtl) for 48 hours prior to metabolite extraction.(G) Schematic of carbon
  flow from the methionine backbone into the methionine cycle.(H-J) Normalized peak
  areas of 13C-labeled metabolites measured by targeted LC-MS/MS from wild-type or
  ΔTSC2 HeLa cells (H) or cancer cell lines (I, J) grown in the absence of serum and
  treated with vehicle (DMSO) or rapamycin (20 nM) for 24 hours and labeled with 13C5-methionine
  (200 μM) for 90 min in methionine-free media. M+n: Mass of the metabolite+n, where
  n represents the number of heavy carbons (13C)). Each isotopologue (M+n) reflects
  the newly synthesized metabolite generated from the metabolization of the tracer
  or metabolite derived from the tracer.(E, F, H-J) The data are presented as the
  mean ± SD of biological triplicates and are representative of two independent experiments.
  *P < 0.05 for multiple comparisons calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD
  test (E, H) and two-tailed Student’s t-test for pairwise comparisons (F, I, J).'
