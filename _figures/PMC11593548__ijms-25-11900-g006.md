caption: The anticipated regulatory network for the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids
  in C. speciosa. (a) A condensed illustration of the biosynthetic pathway of isoflavonoids.
  PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS, CHI, IFS, HID, I’3H, IFR, and VR represent genes encoding phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase,
  chalcone isomerase, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase,
  isoflavone 3′-hydroxylases, isoflavone reductase, and vestitone reductase, respectively.
  The gene expression levels in different plant parts are denoted by cubes arranged
  in the order of root, stem, leaf, flower, and seed, with the magnitude shown as
  log10 (FPKM). Change in color from blue to red represents low to high expression
  level. (b) The predicted regulatory network of the nine CsbHLH genes and six metabolites.
  (c) Analysis of promoters associated with genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis.
  2000 bp upstream of the initiation codon promoter sequences were analyzed for each
  gene. DNA binding sites were identified using PlantPAN 3.0. (d) The predicted regulatory
  network among CsMYB36, the nine CsbHLH genes, and eight structural genes involved
  in the (iso)flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
