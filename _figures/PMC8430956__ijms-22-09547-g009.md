caption: Model of the interplay between the SPL7/Cu-miRNA pathway and the miR156-SPL
  module. SPL7 mediated the transcriptional regulation of Cu-miRNA, such as miR408
  and miR398, and possibly the miR156. miR156 expression by targeting MRE-SPL, such
  as SPL3, controls their transcriptional function. MRE-SPL might compete with non-MRE-SPL,
  such as SPL7, to bind cis-elements (GTACs) in the SPL target promoters precluding
  transcriptional productive binding. Thus, miR156 could ultimately control the MRE-SPL/non-MRE-SPL
  ratio and, subsequently, their functionality. This control is exemplified by the
  balance between SPL3 and SPL7, as demonstrated by a Cu deficiency attenuated transcriptional
  response in the SPL3OE plants. The effects on Cu-miRNA include both common (miR408)
  and specific (miR398) responses depending on other environmental conditions and
  the degree to which the plant life cycle has progressed.
