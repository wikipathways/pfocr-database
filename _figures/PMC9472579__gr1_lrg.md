caption: Induction and antagonism of type-I/-III IFN responses by SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.
  Type-I/-III IFN induction by SARS-CoV-2 relies primarily on MDA5, which senses long
  dsRNA species. MDA5 then undergoes a series of PTMs, including ISGylation in its
  caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), oligomerizes, and translocates
  to the mitochondrion where it interacts with and activates MAVS. MAVS recruits downstream
  signaling molecules such as TBK1/IKKε and the IKKα/β/γ complex that subsequently
  activate transcription factors, including IRF3 and NF-κB. Upon translocation from
  the cytoplasm to the nucleus, these transcription factors drive the expression of
  type-I/-III IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, which, once secreted, prompt autocrine
  and paracrine signaling in infected and bystander cells, respectively. Specifically,
  type-I/-III IFNs engage cognate IFN receptors that signal through the JAK–STAT axis
  to upregulate ISGs. Besides MDA5, the cGAS–STING pathway (via released mtDNA), as
  well as TLR3 and TLR7, are also implicated in SARS-CoV-2 sensing possibly in a cell-type-specific
  manner, though the mechanistic details require further investigation. These sensing
  pathways activate similar downstream kinases and transcription factors, leading
  to type-I/-III IFN gene expression. A prenylated OAS1 isoform, which anchors to
  the endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) where SARS-CoV-2
  replication takes place, restricts virus replication by activating RNase L. RIG-I
  exerts an IFN-independent restriction mechanism by competing with the SARS-CoV-2
  polymerase for binding to the 3′-UTR of the viral genome (not depicted). Likewise,
  during IAV infection, RIG-I binds to the genomic RNA panhandle region associated
  with the IAV polymerase, which can impede viral replication in an IFN-independent
  manner (not illustrated). In many cell types (except plasmacytoid dendritic cells
  for example), IFN induction by IAV is primarily or exclusively dependent on RIG-I.
  Upon recognition of the IAV (sub)genomic panhandle structure, RIG-I undergoes conformational
  changes and PTMs such as activating K63-linked polyubiquitination in its CARDs and
  C-terminal domain (CTD) by TRIM25 and Riplet, respectively. RIG-I then activates
  an analogous signaling pathway as MDA5 to induce antiviral immunity. To evade immune
  surveillance, IAV uses the NS1 protein as the primary IFN antagonist. NS1 binds
  to TRIM25 and Riplet, thereby inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I
  in the cytoplasm. NS1 also localizes to the nucleus where it blocks polyadenylation
  and nuclear export of cellular mRNAs via binding to the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation
  factor 30 (CPSF30). This host-shutoff strategy is believed to act in concert with
  another host-shutoff mechanism carried out by IAV PA-X protein, which selectively
  degrades host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts via its endonucleolytic activity.
  The IAV PB1–F2 protein binds to MAVS at the mitochondrion and suppresses MAVS activation
  by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Like IAV, SARS-CoV-2 targets
  critical PTMs of innate sensors and downstream signaling molecules to antagonize
  IFN responses. The PLpro activity of Nsp3 actively removes conjugated ISG15 from
  MDA5 and IRF3 to suppress their activation. Furthermore, extracellular secretion
  of free ISG15 prompted by PLpro’s de-ISGylating activity can exacerbate proinflammatory
  cytokine responses. Nsp5 cleaves and disables RIG-I and also induces MAVS degradation.
  Nsp1 plugs the mRNA entry tunnel of the 40S ribosomal subunit to shut off host-protein
  translation. Nsp14 and Nsp16 also reportedly disturb host translation and transcription
  processes, though the precise mechanisms are still unknown. Nsp14 and Nsp16 catalyze
  Cap-1 modification of viral RNA to mimic host mRNA and escape recognition by MDA5.
  Nsp15 of murine hepatitis virus and likely also SARS-CoV-2 cleaves and limits the
  accumulation of viral dsRNA to evade MDA5 sensing. Orf9b competes with the chaperone
  protein Hsp90 for binding to TOM70 and thereby impairs the recruitment of TBK1 and
  IRF3 (both associated with Hsp90) to the TOM70–MAVS complex. Orf6 interacts with
  the nuclear pore complex Nup98–Rae1 and impedes the nuclear import of IRF3 and STAT1/2.
  Orf3a, Orf7a/b, M, and N also reportedly dampen STAT1/2 and/or MAVS activation; the
  underlying mechanisms, however, require further investigation. SARS-CoV-2 proteins
  inhibiting IFN/ISG responses are depicted in pink. IAV proteins blocking innate
  immune signaling are illustrated in orange. ‘Ub’ indicates ubiquitin.
