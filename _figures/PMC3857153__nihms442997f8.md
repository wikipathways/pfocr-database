caption: '(A) Regarding the Fas/TNFα-mediate apoptosis pathway, fenretinide up-regulated
  the expression of three pro-apoptotic genes including DEDD, CASP8, and CASP4, which
  subsequently triggered the pathway; Additionally, fenretinide also induced apoptosis
  by up-regulating pro-apoptotic genes HSPA1A/B, which is activated by ER stress and
  promotes TNF-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, ATRA induced the expression of two
  anti-apoptotic genes BIRC3 and TNFAIP3, which negatively regulated the Fas/TNFα-mediate
  signaling pathway, and eventually inhibited Fas/TNFα-mediated apoptosis. The repressed
  expression of PCSK9, which play an important role in caspase-3 activation, also
  decreased ATRA-mediated apoptosis. (B) Regarding the RAS/RAF/ERK-medicated survival
  pathway, fenretinide repressed the expression of BRAF, and therefore decreased the
  expression levels of MEK1 and ERK2, which finally inhibited cell survival. Conversely,
  ATRA up-regulated the expression of SOSC2, successively increased the expression
  of three key genes: BRAF, MEK1 and ERK2, and therefore induced the RAS/RAF/ERK-mediated
  survival pathway. Additionally, ATRA promoted the NFkB-dependent survival pathway
  by repressing CITE2 gene expression. “→” indicates induction and “⊥” indicates repression.
  The genes marked in green circle indicate pro-apoptosis genes. The genes marked
  in red circle indicate anti-apoptosis genes. The numbers in bracket represent the
  fold-change of gene expression changed by fenretinide or ATRA at corresponding time-point.'
