caption: (a) Ergosterol biosynthetic pathway regulatory mechanism contributes to antifungal
  drug resistance. Overabundance of ergosterols may cause HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR)
  to be degraded via the proteasome, reducing mevalonate synthesis and down-regulating
  ergosterol biosynthesis. The ER-related degradation (ERAD) pathway mediates the
  proteasome recognition process of HMGR. The ERAD process primarily initiates HMGR
  breakdown by HRD1 and the chaperone proteins NSG1 and NSG2 recognizing sterols (Omelchuk
  et al., 2018). (1) In excessive sterol conditions, the ergosterol pathway, specifically
  transcription factor UPC2, binds with ergosterol and Hsp90 and stays in the cytosol
  as a repressed state. (2) Under low ergosterol, dissociation of ergosterol leads
  to the relocalization of Upc2 from cytosol to the nucleus by nuclear transport proteins
  such as importins α. transcription factors UPC2 can bind to the SRE of the sterol
  biosynthesis genes to promote their expression or Activated Upc2 also triggers the
  expression of the Adr1 transcription factor, which further serves to direct the
  expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes. Activation of Upc2 or Adr1-enhanced
  azole, AmB, and terbinafine resistance in Candida (Shrivastava et al., 2023). (3)
  Three members of the heme-binding damage resistance proteins (Dap) family—DapA,
  DapB, and DapC in A. fumigatus modulate cytochrome P450 enzymes Erg5 and Erg11 in
  a coordinated manner and influence azole susceptibility (Song et al., 2016). (b)

  (1) Osh1 and Osh4p acts as a sterol-PI4P exchanger where it acquires the sterol
  from the donor membrane (ER) and exchange it for a PI4P at the acceptor membrane
  (trans-Golgi) and then carries the PI4P back to the donor membrane, completing the
  exchange cycle (Mochizuki et al., 2022). Sec14 protein is involved in the transport
  of PI from ER to Golgi. PI4P is converted into PI at the ER by Sac1p, and PI is
  phosphorylated into PI4P at the trans-Golgi by Pik1p (De Saint-Jean et al., 2011).
  (2) OSH2 and OSH3 contain the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in the N-terminal
  region, the OSBP-related ligand binding domain (ORD) in the C-terminal region, and
  the (FFAT) motif. These play a part in the counter-transport of ergosterol and PI4P
  from the ER to the PM and from the PM to the ER, respectively. PI is phosphorylated
  into PI4P at the PM by Stt1. (3) Lam1p, Lam2p, Lam3p, and Lam4p is involved in retrograde
  transport of sterol. (4) LAM5 and LAM6 are involved in retrograde transport from
  ER to mitochondria (Elbaz-Alon et al., 2015; Gatta et al., 2015)
