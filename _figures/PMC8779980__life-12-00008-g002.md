caption: Possible interplay between mitochondria and regulation of NGF/TRKA and miR-145.
  Epithelial ovarian cancer cells are intrinsically resistant to cell death. Through
  its interaction with the TRKA receptor, NGF decreases transcription of miR-145 levels,
  causing an increase in oncogenic proteins involved in processes such as proliferation,
  migration, and angiogenesis. Additionally, NGF induces a decrease of transcriptional
  activity and cellular levels of miR-145, with an increase of the Bcl-2, expression
  of which leads to the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the survival
  of the EOC cell.
