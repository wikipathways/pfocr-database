caption: Putative role of the mTOR pathway in pathogenesis and epileptogenesis of
  focal cortical malformations. A. During normal brain development, the mTOR pathway,
  particularly mTORC1, regulates a number of important physiological functions, such
  as cell growth, proliferation, ion channel expression, and synaptic and circuit
  plasticity, primarily via activation of protein synthesis mechanisms, such as through
  S6K/ribosomal S6 protein and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1)/eukaryotic
  initiation factor eIF4E pathways. In turn, in response to different physiological
  conditions and stimuli, mTORC1 may be activated or inhibited by various upstream
  signaling pathways, such as the insulin/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
  or the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. B. In focal
  malformations of cortical development, the mTOR pathway may become hyperactivated,
  caused in some cases by known mutations in upstream regulators of mTOR (e.g. TSC1
  or TSC2 genes in the disease TSC directly affecting hamartin or tuberin expression;
  STRADA gene in PMSE syndrome, leading to decreased AMPK pathway activation; PTEN
  inactivation in an animal model of FCD, leading to increased PI3K/Akt pathway activity)
  or in other cases by unknown mechanisms (e.g. most cases of isolated FCD in people).
  Regardless of the initial upstream trigger, disinhibition or hyperactivation of
  the mTOR pathway can lead to abnormally increased cell growth and proliferation,
  which may account for the focal lesion formation of FCD and tubers. The gross structural
  lesions themselves, as well as non-structural molecular and cellular changes in
  ion channel expression and synaptic organization triggered by altered mTOR-mediated
  protein synthesis, may promote epileptogenesis in these disorders. Finally, mTOR
  inhibitors may represent a rational therapy for FCD and TSC by reversing mTORC1
  hyperactivation and the downstream mechanisms of epileptogenesis.
