caption: Absorption, and excretion pathway of gut-derived uremic toxins. (A) Indoxyl
  sulfate is produced when dietary tryptophan is converted into indole by bacterial
  tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) and subsequent absorption into the portal circulation
  for further metabolism by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and sulfotransferase 1A1
  (SULT1A1). (B) P-cresyl sulfate begins as dietary tyrosine which is metabolized
  by tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) into p-cresol. These intermediates are converted
  into p-cresyl sulfate through SULT1A1. (C) Various dietary polyphenols are converted
  through multiple phenolic reactions by colon bacteria into benzoic acid which is
  then conjugated with glycine by glycine-N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) to produce hippuric
  acid. (D) TMAO is the product of TMA oxidation by flavin-containing monooxygenase
  3 (FMO3), where TMA is the intermediate metabolite of carnitine trimethylamine lyase
  (CTMAL) breakdown of various dietary molecules such as choline, L-carnitine, betaine,
  and phosphatidylcholine. (A–D) Uremic toxins are secreted by renal tubular cell
  via drug transporters (organic anion transporter 1/3, OAT1/3; and multidrug resistance-associated
  proteins 2/3, MRP2/3 and subsequently excreted in the urine. Image created with
