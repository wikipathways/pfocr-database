caption: Schematic diagram of KAP1 phosphorylation during cerebral I/R involved in
  endogenous NSCs proliferation and apoptosis is summarized. Simulated p-KAP1 promoted
  the proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) and the expression of PCNA
  in cerebral I/R. Simulated p-KAP1 bound to PCNA, inhibiting CUL4A-mediated ubiquitination
  degradation to PCNA. This finding suggests that targeting the KAP-1/PCNA signaling
  pathway could enhance the neurogenesis of endogenous NSCs in the management of brain
  diseases
