caption: a | The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is initiated by renin, which is secreted
  by the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent renal arterioles in response to decreased
  perfusion, in response to low sodium levels, upon β1-adrenergic receptor stimulation
  or upon stimulation by nitric oxide (NO) or prostaglandin,. The renin precursor
  prorenin and renin both bind to prorenin receptor (PRR). In the circulation, renin
  cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Prorenin can also cleave angiotensinogen
  into Ang I, to a certain extent, when bound to PRR. Ang I can also be generated
  through the cleavage of Ang 1–12 by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or by chymase
  in cardiac tissue. The ensuing proteolytic cascade can be divided into the canonical
  and non-canonical pathways. The canonical pathway is initiated when ACE, or chymase
  in the heart, cleaves Ang I into Ang II. Binding of Ang II or its cleavage products
  Ang III or Ang A to the G-protein-coupled receptor Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R)
  leads to vasoconstriction, an increase in blood pressure and other effects,. The
  non-canonical pathway is initiated by Ang I cleavage by ACE2 to Ang 1–9, which is
  further cleaved into Ang 1–7 (mainly by ACE). In the non-canonical pathway, binding
  of Ang II, Ang III, Ang 1–9, Ang 1–7 and Ang A to AT2R counteracts effects mediated
  by AT1R. Ang IV (generated from Ang III when cleaved by aminopeptidase N (APN))
  is involved in both the canonical pathway and the non-canonical pathway and binds
  to angiotensin 4 receptor (AT4R), also known as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase
  (IRAP). Binding of Ang IV to AT4R has antiapoptotic and both pro-inflammatory and
  anti-inflammatory effects, as it regulates responses by competitive inhibition of
  the enzyme/receptor,,. Ang 1–7 binds to the receptors MAS and MAS-related G-protein-coupled
  receptor (MRGD), and alamandine, which is generated from Ang A or Ang 1–7, also
  binds to MRGD. Both Ang 1–7 and alamandine have antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory
  and antifibrotic effects. The non-canonical and canonical RAS pathways can counterbalance
  each other,–. For example, Ang II binds to both AT2R (non-canonical pathway) and
  AT1R (canonical pathway) but exerts a more robust effect on AT1R,. AT2R can, however,
  be upregulated during pathological conditions. Effectors are depicted in circles
  and the enzymes catalysing their cleavage are listed next to blue arrows. Effectors
  that predominantly participate in the canonical pathway are coloured pink and those
  that predominantly participate in the non-canonical pathway are coloured blue. Effectors
  that participate in both pathways are coloured in both pink and blue, with the predominant
  colour indicating the more prominent pathway. Black arrows indicate which molecule
  binds to which receptor, with dashed lines depicting weak receptor binding. b |
