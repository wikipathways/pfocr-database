caption: The anthocyanins biosynthetic pathway and variations in different fruits.
  This figure is redrawn and modified from Gayomba et al. []. The flavonol biosynthetic
  pathway is illustrated, showing enzymatic steps, and the responsible enzyme is indicated
  in red. CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; OMT1, flavone 3′-O-methyltransferase 1.
