caption: In PD, ERS forms a complex vicious cycle with mitochondrial dysfunction,
  oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, collectively driving disease progression.
  ERS activates the mPTP via calcium overload, leading to mitochondrial membrane potential
  collapse, reduced ATP synthesis, and a ROS burst, while simultaneously activating
  proapoptotic pathways (CHOP/Bax/Bak) to exacerbate mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction-induced energy metabolism collapse and ROS feedback further disrupt
  ER homeostasis, creating a bidirectional detrimental loop. Structural disorganization
  of ERMCS and mitophagy defects caused by PINK1/Parkin mutations amplify this cross-damage.
  Additionally, ERS activates NADPH oxidase through the IRE1-JNK pathway, while mitochondrial
  ROS leakage directly triggers oxidative stress. ROS oxidizes ER proteins and calcium
  channels, impairing their function and forming a mutually reinforcing cycle, compounded
  by weakened antioxidant systems (SOD/GSH). ERS also activates the TLR/NF-κB pathway
  via misfolded protein release (e.g., α-syn), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α, IL-1β), which, in turn, suppress ER folding capacity and activate JNK/p38
  pathways to aggravate ERS. Microglial activation synergizes with oxidative stress,
  forming an “ERS–inflammation–oxidative stress” triangular vicious cycle. Ultimately,
  apoptotic cascades, metabolic imbalance, and synaptic dysfunction lead to irreversible
  dopaminergic neuron loss. Targeting key nodes in these interconnected networks (e.g.,
  inhibiting ERS, enhancing mitophagy, or blocking inflammatory signaling) may offer
  novel therapeutic strategies for PD. (“p” represents phosphorylation; ↑ represents
