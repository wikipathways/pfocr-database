caption: Dietary sulforaphane is known to stabilize cytoplasmic Nrf2 through Keap1
  binding to inhibit Nrf2 ubiquitination for its proteasomal degradation. Stabilized
  Nrf2 may exert transcriptional activation of antioxidant response element (ARE)-responsive
  genes involved in redox regulation but also in fatty acid, glucose, and amino acid
  catabolism including enzymes and cellular transporters. Transcription activation
  then results in provision of metabolic substrates for mitochondrial machinery, tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  complex as well as mitochondrial symporters and transporters. Nrf2 may also directly
  upregulate ARE-bearing genes that encode these mitochondrial apparatus and mitochondrial
  quality control processes (i.e., mitophagy, biogenesis). Enhanced cyctochrome C
  (Cyc1) from OXPHOS is known to cause apoptosis, and ARE-responsive vasodilation
  and cardioprotective genes may protect pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling.
  Overall, sulforaphane-Nrf2 responses enrich mitochondrial bioenergetics to produce
  ATP on cellular demand but also facilitate other mitochondrial functions for cellular
  homeostasis against oxidative stress. Pathway analyses indicated that these Nrf2-dependently
  regulated lung genes are associated with pathways including peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor/retinoid X receptor (PPAR/RXR) activation, phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which may modulate NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascade. Proteins
  and cellular processes predicted to be modulated by SFN-Nrf2 axis are highlighted
  in black.
