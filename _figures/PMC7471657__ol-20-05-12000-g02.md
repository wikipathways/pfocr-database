caption: Gene ontology terms and KEGG pathways. Predicted target genes (CD68, IL6,
  FOXP3, PTPRC, CD274, CD4, CD8A, PDCD1, CD3G, CD3D, CD247, CD3E, KRT20, MS4A1, CD3EAP,
  SPATA2 and SNCA) and PPI networks of target genes. (A) STRING PPI network of co-expressed
  and interacting genes. The clusters of 17 genes represent proteins. The colored
  nodes represent proteins, white nodes represent second-shell interactions, filled
  nodes for 3D known or predicted structures and edges represent protein-protein associations
  that did not necessarily need to bind physically to each other. (B) KEGG pathways
  associated with the proteins identified and reported in the STRING analysis. Red
  represents the T-cell receptor pathway, blue represents the hematopoietic cell lineage,
  green represents Th17 cell differentiation, purple represents primary immunodeficiency,
  yellow represents Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes; PPI, protein-protein interactions network.
