caption: The mechanism of trained immunity and related research. (a) Priming stimulus
  and secondary stimulus for trained immunity. Following the initial stimulation,
  innate immune cells undergo epigenetic modifications and metabolic reprogramming,
  releasing a small amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequent heterologous
  stimulation leads to an enhanced immune response and an increased release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. (b) Specific innate immune cells contribute to trained immunity. (c)
  Common metabolic and epigenetic pathways in trained immunity involve the activation
  of the mTOR signaling pathway and subsequent glycolysis, initiated by BCG vaccine,
  β-Glucan, and OxLDL. (d) Trained immunity in animals
