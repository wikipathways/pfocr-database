caption: 4a treatment resulted in production of ROS, thereby damaging the DNA, which
  in turn helped in upregulation and phosphorylation of p53, where it activated extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis by activating FAS, cleavage of FAS-L. These activated death
  receptors resulted in the recruitment of adaptor proteins, FAS-associated death
  domain proteins (FADD), which recruits and aggregates CASPASE-8, thereby promoting
  its auto processing and activation. Activated CASPASE-8 cleaves BID into t-BID,
  which further facilitates in the release of CYTOCHROME C from mitochondria, further
  cleaving PROCASPASE-3 into the effector CASPASE-3 which leads to cell death.
