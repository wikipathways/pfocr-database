caption: A comparison of ICIs alone and NPs loading ICIs. The application of ICIs
  leads to the activation of tumor-specific T cells by blocking PD-1 and CTLA-4 on
  T cells and also PD-L1/2 on tumor cells or APCs as well. The administration of ICIs
  alone over-stimulates the immune system and increases the possibility of off-target
  effects which is the cause of systemic AEs. By contrast, NPs loading ICIs leads
  to a high local concentration of ICIs in the tumor site while reducing the off-target
  side effects.
