caption: Immune system profile in melanocytes from vitiligo patients. (A) Vitiligo
  patients have genetic polymorphisms that downregulate CTLA-4 from CD8+ T cell and
  a mutation of the NALP1 gene (which results in a higher IFN-γ gene expression).
  These alterations might result in a greater IFN- γ gene expression upregulating
  the costimulatory molecule B7 from APC. Upon antigen presentation, the APC activates
  CD8+ T cell via B7-CD28 interaction (in contrast, if B7 binds to CTLA-4 receptor,
  the CD8+ T cell remains inactivated albeit antigen presentation). Upon activation,
  CD8+ T cell secrets large amounts of IFN-γ, stimulating keratinocytes (via JAK/STAT
  pathway) to secret chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) that recruit recirculation effector
  CD8+ T cell in injured melanocytes inducing its apoptosis. In addition, activated
  CD8+ T cells secrets large amounts of TNF-α, resulting in further downregulation
  in CTLA-4 receptors. (B) A theoretical model describing the potential role of chronic
  physical exercise on cytotoxic T cells suppressing. Chronic physical exercise (PE)
  decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α and increases
  anti-inflammatory IL-10. Inhibiting IL-1-β and TNF-α, there are no negative feedback
  for CTL-4 expression in cytotoxic T cell or regulatory T cell. When the CTL-4 receptor
  interacts with costimulatory molecule B7 from APC (because costimulatory molecule
  B7 has a greater affinity for CTLA-4 than the CD28 receptor), the regulatory T cell
  suppresses CD8+ T cell activation. Also, due to chronic PE, the increase in IL-10,
  FOXP3, and TGF-β can stimulate regulatory T cells’ transcription, differentiation,
  and proliferation. An increase in regulatory T cells suppresses autoreactive cytotoxic
  T cells responses. The increase in regulatory T cells can consume IL-2, which is
  important for maintaining memory T cells, thus potentiating the decrease in the
  excessive memory T cell as discussed in the paper. APC, antigen-presenting cell;
