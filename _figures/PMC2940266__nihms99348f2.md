caption: The PTEN regulated PI3K/AKT signaling cross talks with several other signaling
  pathways. These pathways include the Wnt signaling pathway, the energy signaling
  pathway, as well as p53 signaling. Through inhibiting GSK3β, activation of AKT leads
  to the stabilization of β-catenin, a critical factor in Wnt signaling. PI3K/AKT
  signal also cross talks with energy signaling pathway at TSC. Whereas AKT phophorylates
  and inhibit TSC, AMPK, a kinase activated in response to an increase in AMP:ATP
  ratio phosporylates and activates TSC. In addition to its function primarily through
  AKT in the cytoplasm, nuclear PTEN may have its unique functions. These include
  direct association with p53, CENP and regulation of rad 51 to control the later
  stages of the cell cycle and DNA repair mechanisms.
