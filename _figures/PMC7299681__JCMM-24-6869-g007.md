caption: The proposed model of WDR41‐mediated cellular processes in TNBC cells. In
  the tumour microenvironment, high methylation across the WDR41 promoter region mediates
  the down‐regulation of WDR41, resulting in an excessive activation of the AKT/GSK‐3β
  signalling pathway and subsequent activation of the nuclear β‐catenin, leading to
  promotion of tumour progression in TNBC. TNBC, triple‐negative breast cancer; WDR41,
  WD‐repeat protein 41
papertitle: Aberrant methylation of WD‐repeat protein 41 contributes to tumour progression
  in triple‐negative breast cancer.
