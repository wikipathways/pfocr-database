caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of top differentially affected pathways from the
  microarray data. Pathway analysis was performed with a statistical cutoff of p <0.02.
  The top two differentially affected pathways were a involved in NF-κB regulation,
  and b production of inflammatory cytokines associated with notch signaling
