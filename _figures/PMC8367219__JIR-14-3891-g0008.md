caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrated the mechanism that HMGB1 is involved in the
  inhibition of PGRN on autophagic activity in HDM-induced airway remodeling. HDM
  exposure triggered the activation of HMGB1 and subsequent RAGE/MAPKs signaling pathway
  in airway epithelial cells, thus potentiating autophagy process and upregulating
  the expression of α-SMA and collagen proteins, then the formation of airway remodeling.
  PGRN could overturn HDM-induced HMGB1 overexpression, and further restrained autophagy
  and alleviated ECM production. Black lines: facilitation; Red lines: inhibition.'
