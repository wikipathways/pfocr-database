caption: 'Model of TRAF4 function on TJs. Left: the interaction between PIPs and the
  TRAF domain of TRAF4 allows the recruitment of the protein onto the plasma membrane
  in TJs. Through a mechanism possibly involving the E3-ligase activity of the protein,
  TRAF4 destabilizes TJs and promotes migration. Middle: TRAF4 an adaptor from the
  TGF-β pathway. Upon TGF-β binding on its receptor, the activation of the pathway
  leads to the recruitment of TRAF4 on the receptor complex. TRAF4 inhibits SMURF2
  and activates USP15, which leads to the stabilization of the receptor complex on
  the membrane and potentiates its signaling. TRAF4 also allows the activation of
  TAK1 through a K63-linked ubiquitination. Right: in cells devoid of tight junctions,
  TRAF4 is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. TRAF4 interacts with
  the deubiquitinase HAUSP, presumably in the nucleus, and inactivates its action
  on P53. This favors the ubiquitination of P53 and its subsequent degradation, thereby
  limiting the ability of the cell to respond to a genotoxic stress.'
