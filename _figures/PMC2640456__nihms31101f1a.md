caption: 'Transcripts with an abundance of two-fold or greater in PACAP-treated (6
  h) compared to vehicle-treated bovine chromaffin cells by two-color microarray analysis
  (187 transcripts; see ) were used as the input for analysis of potential networks
  using the signal transduction knowledge environment of Ingenuity (http://www.ingenuity.com).
  a. Network solely involving 35 PACAP-regulated transcripts. b. Network involving
  16 PACAP-regulated transcripts and 12 additional components with Ingenuity-confirmed
  direct or indirect links to them. c. Network involving 12 PACAP-regulated transcripts
  and 8 additional components with Ingenuity-confirmed direct or indirect links to
  them. PACAP-regulated transcripts are depicted in gray and linked components in
  white. Circular lines above symbols indicate auto-regulation; connecting lines without
  arrows indicate direct protein interaction deduced from either yeast two-hybrid,
  enzymatic, or immunoprecipitation assays; dashed and solid arrows indicate indirect
  (e.g. regulation of mRNA levels) and direct (e.g. enzymatic) activation, and lines
  ending in orthogonal dash indicate inhibition. Symbols and notations used by the
  Ingenuity Pathway Assistant in assembling of the networks shown in this and subsequent
  figures are as follows. The node shapes denote enzymes ( ) , phosphatases ( ) ,
  kinases ( ) , peptidases ( ) , G-protein coupled receptor ( ) , transmembrane receptor
  ( ) , cytokines ( ) , growth factor ( ) , ion channel ( ) , transporter ( ) , translation
  factor ( ) , nuclear receptor ( ) , transcription factor ( ) , and other ( ).The
  edge labels (when included) are represented as follows: A, activation, deactivation;
  B, binding; E, expression; I, inhibition; L, proteolysis; M, biochemical modification;
  O, other; P, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation; T, transcription. Edge types include
  solid lines, direct interactions; dotted lines, indirect interactions; lines without
  arrows, binding only; arrows, factor acting upon factor nearest to arrowhead; lines
  terminating in short orthogonal line, inhibition of factor closest to orthogonal
  line; lines terminating in a combination of the last two edge types, both action
  upon and inhibition of factor closest to arrowhead. All gene products are defined
  in the glossary in , which includes active links to Entrez Gene for each component.'
