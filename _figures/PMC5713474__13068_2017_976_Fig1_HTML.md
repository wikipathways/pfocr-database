caption: The hybrid pathway for nicotine degradation in A. tumefaciens S33 (a) and
  its nicotine-degrading gene cluster (b). NdhAB, nicotine dehydrogenase; Paz, pseudoazurin;
  Hno, 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase; Pno, 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine oxidase; Ald, putative
  aldehyde dehydrogenase; Hsh, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase; Hpo, 2,5-dihydroxypyridine
  dioxygenase; Nfo, N-formylmaleamate deformylase; Ami, maleamate amidohydrolase (amidase);
  Iso, maleate cis/trans-isomerase. The red cross in panel a indicates that the pathway
  has been blocked by disabling the enzyme Hno; the black cross in panel b shows our
  strategy of disrupting the hno gene
