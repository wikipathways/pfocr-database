caption: Scheme Demonstrating the Possible Sites of Action of FHY3, TIC, and ELF3
  in the Gating of Signals from the Phytochrome (PHY) and Cryptochrome (CRY) Photoreceptors.FHY3
  acts to gate signals on a branch of the red light pathway mediating light input
  to the clock. TIC and ELF3 affect all light-signaling pathways tested. TIC and ELF3
  together may act to gate both the red and blue light input pathways upstream of
  a divergence of a branch mediating photomorphogenic responses (light inhibition
  of hypocotyl elongation and direct induction of CAB2 gene expression) and a branch
  mediating light input to the clock.
