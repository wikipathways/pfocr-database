caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical inflammasome-induced pathways in pyroptosis.
  The NLRP3 inflammasome is mostly highlighted in the canonical inflammasome-induced
  pathway. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated depending on two steps. Step 1 is that
  the PAMPs or DAMPs stimulate the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to
  the upregulated transcription of NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18.
  In step 2, the formation of the P2X7R-paxillin-NLRP3 complex activates the NLRP3
  inflammasome, which depends on the ATP/P2X7R axis-induced potassium efflux. Simultaneously,
  NEK7 interacts with NLRP3 in response to the declined intercellular potassium, which
  contributes to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, increased
  TXNIP can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by directly binding to NLRP3. The
  activated NLRP3 inflammasome excites caspase-1. Sequentially, GSDMD is cleaved by
  caspase-1 and releases GSDMD-NTD to form the membrane pore. Then pyroptosis occurs.
  Meanwhile, IL-1β and IL-18 are activated by caspase-1 and secreted from the GSDMD-induced
  pore, which results in the inflammatory cascade downstream. LPS is transferred into
  the cytosol by the formation of an endosome, which is induced by TLR4/MD2/CD14 complex,
  HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway, or OMVs. Intracellular LPS directly activates caspase-4/5/11.
  Activated caspase-4/5/11 cleaves GSDMD to induce pore formation and pyroptosis.
  During this procedure, caspase-4/5/11 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing
  potassium efflux. Note: MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa-B; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activation
  and recruitment domain; P2X7R, P2X7 receptor; NEK7, NIMA-related kinase 7; TXNIP,
  thioredoxin interacting protein; GSDMD, gasdermin D; NTD, N-terminal domain; HMGB1,
  high mobility group box 1; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end-products; OMVs,
  outer membrane vesicles'
