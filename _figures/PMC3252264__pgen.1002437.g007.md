caption: Cells co-stimulated with mating pheromone and hyperosmotic stress adapt to
  stress before committing to mating differentiation. Hog1 coordinates mating and
  stress signals by limiting Fus3 activation through two mechanisms, (1) feedback
  phosphorylation of Ste50 and (2) feedforward phosphorylation of Rck2. Red lines
  indicate Hog1 mediated inhibition. Green line indicates the Fus3 positive feedback
  loop, which is disrupted by Rck2.
