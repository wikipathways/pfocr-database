caption: EE promotes the conversion of proNGF to mature NGF (mNGF) through increased
  plasmin levels. mNGF then binds to tyrosine kinase A (TrkA), which subsequently
  activates the PI3k-Akt and MAPK/ERK pathway and promotes neurogenesis, cell survival,
  cell proliferation and increased synaptic plasticity in the basal forebrain. As
  a result of this conversion, EE also indirectly decreases the activation of the
  JNK pathway signaling pathway by indirectly reducing proNGF levels (↓) and directly
  reducing p75NTR levels (↓) in the brain. This results in lower JNK phosphorylation,
  consequently leading to decreased tau hyperphosphorylation, decreased APP phosphorylation
  and decreased cell death in the basal forebrain
