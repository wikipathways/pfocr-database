caption: (A) The cytoplasmic destruction complex constitutively targets β-catenin
  for degradation. Mechanical or chemical stimulation of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway
  receptor pair LRP5-Frizzled (Fz), in cells of the osteoblast linage, causes LRP5
  to sequester the destruction complex, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and translocate
  to the nucleus where it interacts with TCF/LEF family transcription factors and
  promotes osteogenic gene expression. (B) Osteocytes (Ot) sense mechanical stress
  and respond by increasing Wnt-β-catenin signaling and coordinating the anabolic
  activities of osteoblasts (Ob) and the catabolic activities of osteoclasts (Oc).
  Wnt-β-catenin signaling, in addition to (i) sensitizing osteocytes to mechanical
  stress, (ii) promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into osteoblasts,
  (iii) prevents osteoblast apoptosis, and (iv) increases osteoprotegerin expression
  by osteoblasts, thus inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The net effect
  is a shift in favor of bone formation over bone resorption.
