caption: Deregulated cell signaling pathways targeted by Bergenin. This figure hypothesizes
  the mechanism of action associated with the anticancer potential of bergenin against
  several types of human cancers via targeting several deregulated components of cell
  signaling pathways including (A) ERK1/2 (Park et al., 2021), (B) JAK/STAT (Shi et
  al., 2019), (C) STAT3/Akt (Shi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021), (D) NF-kB (Xiang
  et al., 2020) and associated with the progression of human cancers. Bergenin has
  been reported to modulate the oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression to inhibit
  the carcinogenesis. Modulation of these dysregulated components leads to several
  mechanisms that inhibit the growth of cancer cells such as apoptosis induction,
  growth arrest at G0/S/M phases, angiogenesis and glycolysis inhibition. PTEN, Phosphatase
  and TENsin homolog; AKT, AKT serine-threonine protein kinase family; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; STAT-3, Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3
