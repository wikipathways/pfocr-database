caption: 'Mitochondrial Fe–S cluster biogenesis and Isu degradation. Model of regulation
  of Isu degradation in the mitochondrial matrix. Isu protein, a key component for
  Fe–S cluster biogenesis (black arrows), is susceptible to degradation by the Lon-type
  protease Pim1 (red arrows). However, Isu becomes protected from Pim1 driven degradation
  (red dotted lines) during both the assembly and transfer steps of the process through
  a combination of partner binding and Fe–S cluster coordination. Isu becomes susceptible
  to degradation upon completion of the transfer step. Assembly step. Fe–S cluster
  assembly is initiated by interaction of the scaffold Isu with Nfs1 (). In the yeast
  S. cerevisiae the scaffold is encoded by two paralogous genes, ISU1 and ISU2; Isu1
  and Isu2 are functionally redundant, with Isu1 being predominant and Isu2 less abundant
  (; ). As a cysteine desulfurase, Nfs1 provides sulfur for synthesis of the cluster.
  It functions as a Nfs1(Isd11) complex composed of two monomers of Nfs1 and two monomers
  of Isd11. Isd11 is an accessory protein required for Nfs1 stability and/or function
  (). Other factors needed for cluster assembly include: Yeast frataxin Yfh1, proposed
  to serve as an iron donor and/or regulator (), and yeast ferredoxin Yah1, which
  is functionally coupled with ferredoxin reductase Arh1, to provide electrons required
  for sulfur reduction (). Transfer step. Following its assembly, the Fe–S cluster
  is transferred from Isu to a recipient protein (). Transfer requires Hsp70 chaperone
  machinery composed of Hsp70, and its partnering co-chaperones Jac1 and Mge1 ().
  Initially Jac1 binds and targets the Isu coordinated Fe–S cluster to Hsp70. Interaction
  with Isu, coupled with Hsp70 ATPase activity stimulation by the J-domain of Jac1,
  results in Hsp70:Isu complex formation. As a result, the Fe–S cluster can be transferred
  via potential carrier proteins such as Grx5 () to the mitochondrial subset of recipient
  proteins or, through a yet elusive pathway, can be utilized for maturation of cytosolic
  and nuclear proteins (). Isu is released from Hsp70, due to the nucleotide exchange
  activity of Mge1 protein (). Upon release, Isu becomes once more susceptible to
  degradation by Pim1, but can also be recycled and serve as a scaffold for cluster
  assembly again (gray arrow). Disruption at either the assembly or transfer step
  leads to increase in Isu levels as shown by analysis of yeast strains having reduced
  or perturbed function of Yah1, Yfh1, Jac1, Hsp70 or Grx5 protein (; )'
