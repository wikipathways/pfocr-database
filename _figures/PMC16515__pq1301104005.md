caption: Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for A2E in mice and humans lacking the
  RmP transporter. This model is based on the proposed scheme for A2E biogenesis by
  Parish et al. (). In outer segments after a photobleach, phosphatidylethanolamine
  and all-trans-RAL are transiently in equilibrium with APE (reaction 1). After a
  (, ) sigmatropic rearrangement, the resulting secondary amine may condense with
  another molecule of all-trans-RAL. Subsequent (, ) sigmatropic rearrangement of
  the bis-retinoid product results in the formation of A2PE-H2 (reaction 2), an irreversible
  step at neutral pH. Oxidation of A2PE-H2 to A2PE (reaction 3) occurs within RPE
  phagolysosomes and is accompanied by a shift in the visible λmax from 500 to 430
  nm. This blue shift is expected, because the two tetraene side chains are oriented
  meta on the pyridinium ring, hence resonance delocalization occurs at a higher energy
  in the oxidized form because of loss of aromaticity. Finally, A2E is formed within
  RPE phagolysosomes on acid hydrolysis of the phosphate ester and release of phosphatidic
  acid (reaction 4).
