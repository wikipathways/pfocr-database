caption: 'Oxidative pathways leading to neuronal cell death and glial cell inflammation:
  protective effects of resveratrol []. Various endogenous and exogenous factors may
  stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production directly or indirectly through
  NADPH oxidase and mitochondria []; ROS can cause damage to mitochondrial membrane
  and activate protein kinases, e.g., PKC, p38, MAPK, ERK1/2, and PI3 kinase []; protein
  kinases target multiple proteins, including regulation of the NF-κB transcription
  pathway, phosphorylation of NADPH oxidase subunits, and increase in the expression
  of protective enzymes and anti-apoptotic genes []; mitochondrial dysfunction leads
  to increase in pro-apoptotic proteins and neuron cell death []; neuron cell death
  leads to activation of microglial cells and production of ROS and proinflammatory
  cytokines []; cytokines induce NF-κB pathway leading to glial cell inflammatory
  responses, including induction of iNOS, sPLA2, and COX-2, and thus forming a vicious
  cycle of chronic inflammation and cell death. In the above scheme, resveratrol (R)
  may exert protective effects through (a) scavenge ROS produced by NADPH oxidase,
  (a) activate SIRT1 which leads to restoration of mitochondrial function and biogenesis,
  and stimulation of biosynthesis of vitagenes, and (c) inhibit microglial activation'
