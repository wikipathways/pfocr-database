  pathways in Rhodobacter capsulatus relevant to the carbon substrates (enclosed in
  dashed boxes) used for growth of cultures in this work. Fructose is taken up by
  a phosphotransferase system, enters the cell as fructose-1-phosphate, and is catabolized
  to pyruvate through an Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas series of reactions (FBA, fructose
  bisphosphate aldolase). Glucose appears to be phosphorylated by glucokinase after
  entry into the cell, and glucose-6-phosphate is catabolized to pyruvate through
  an Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Fructose bisphosphate and glucose-6-phosphate can be
  interconverted through the sequential action of fructose 1–6 diphosphatase and phosphoglucose
  isomerase. Relationships between organic and amino acids are as shown. HemN2, the
