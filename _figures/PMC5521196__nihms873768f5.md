caption: In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt ligands stimulate the activation
  of β-catenin to induce transcription of Wnt target genes via interaction with the
  Lef1 transcription factor promoter. The absence of adenogenesis in the Pgr-Sox17
  cKO mouse and presence of it in the Sprr2f-Sox17 cKO mouse suggests that Sox17 in
  isolated cells within the stromal compartment of the endometrium is necessary for
  adenogenesis while Sox17 within the epithelial compartment is dispensable. Depending
  on the cell type expressing Sox17 within the stroma, the mechanism by which Sox17
  effects adenogenesis could be non-cell autonomous via target gene signaling (A)
  or cell autonomous via differentiation of a stem cell population into epithelial
  cells (B).
