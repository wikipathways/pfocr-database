caption: Abiotic stresses signal integration and adaptive responses in plants. Plants
  perceive different stress signals through primary receptors, which may be embedded
  in their plasma membrane. Primary signals also arise from the cell wall (1). Activation
  of these sensors often culminates in a flux of ions across the membrane that normally
  culminates in an influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol. As a localized effect of abiotic
  stresses, the disturbance of the energy balance of photosystems in chloroplasts
  (2) and of the electron transport chain in mitochondria (3) culminate in the production
  of ROS, which is also a response shared by other compartments, such as saturation
  of protein folding pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (4) and activation of peroxidases
  and oxidases in peroxisomes (5). The cytosolic content of Ca2+ is balanced after
  the influx triggered by the signaling of abiotic stresses, through vacuolar antiport
  transporters (6). Collectively, these signals are integrated and potentiated by
  other secondary messengers, such as cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate) produced
  by the activation of adenylate cyclase in response to ROS and Ca2+ and converge
  to the activation of protein kinases, including calcium-dependent protein kinases

  by hormonal signaling, are responsible for the transcriptional modulation of several
  genes in the nucleus (7), resulting in the remodeling of plant physiology and adaptive
  responses that lead to characteristic phenotypes of plants under stress.

  description: Abiotic stresses signal integration and adaptive responses in plants.
    Plants perceive different stress signals through primary receptors, which may
    be embedded in their plasma membrane. Primary signals also arise from the cell
    wall (1). Activation of these sensors often culminates in a flux of ions across
    the membrane that normally culminates in an influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol. As
    a localized effect of abiotic stresses, the disturbance of the energy balance
    of photosystems in chloroplasts (2) and of the electron transport chain in mitochondria
    (3) culminate in the production of ROS, which is also a response shared by other
    compartments, such as saturation of protein folding pathway in the endoplasmic
    reticulum (4) and activation of peroxidases and oxidases in peroxisomes (5). The
    cytosolic content of Ca2+ is balanced after the influx triggered by the signaling
    of abiotic stresses, through vacuolar antiport transporters (6). Collectively,
    these signals are integrated and potentiated by other secondary messengers, such
    as cyclic AMP (adenosine monophosphate) produced by the activation of adenylate
    cyclase in response to ROS and Ca2+ and converge to the activation of protein
    kinases, including calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and cascades of MAP-kinases,
    which will activate hormone biosynthesis pathways, such as abscisic acid (ABA).
    Finally, stress-responsive transcription factors, reinforced by hormonal signaling,
    are responsible for the transcriptional modulation of several genes in the nucleus
    (7), resulting in the remodeling of plant physiology and adaptive responses that
    lead to characteristic phenotypes of plants under stress.
