caption: NF-κB signaling pathway in DN. NF-κB is a transcriptional regulator expressed
  in the cytoplasm of almost all cell types, and its activity is controlled by the
  IκB regulatory protein family. Activation of NF-κB involves the inhibitory protein
  IκB kinase being phosphorylated by specific IκB and subsequently degraded by proteolysis.
  Free NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, binds to promoter and enhancer sites, and
  activates transcription. NF-κB signaling pathway leads to increased transcription
  of target genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and other target genes associated
  with this complication, resulting in renal inflammation.
