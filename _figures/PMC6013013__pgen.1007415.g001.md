caption: miRNAs are processed from hairpin precursors and sorted between Argonautes,
  primarily ALG-1 and ALG-2. Loss of alg-1 activity leads to a shortened lifespan,
  indicating that ALG-1 normally promotes longevity. Conversely, loss of alg-2 activity
  extends lifespan, indicating that ALG-2 acts counter to ALG-1 to limit lifespan.
  Both Argonautes function at least in part through the insulin signaling pathway
  involving the insulin/IGF receptor DAF-2, which limits lifespan, and the forkhead
  transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, which promotes extended lifespan. It is possible
  that ALG-1 and ALG-2 also affect longevity via regulation of parallel pathways involved
  in aging, as indicated by the dashed lines.
