caption: Effects of statin on mevalonate pathway. The beneficial effects of statins
  may extend beyond their effects on serum cholesterol levels. The inhibition of HMG-CoA
  reductase blocks the production of mevalonic acid, a precursor for both cholesterol
  and several isoprenoid intermediates. Some of these intermediates are substrates
  for the posttranslational isoprenylation of various proteins involved in cell signaling.
  HMG-CoA indicates 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A.
