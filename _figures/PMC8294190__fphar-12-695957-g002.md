caption: IL-17A promotes airway remodeling in COPD. The mechanism that IL-17A promotes
  airway remodeling by increasing collagen deposition and inhibiting inflammation-associated
  mediators or cells autophagy are summarized. In COPD airway remodeling, the activated
  EGFR facilitates the production of mucin5AC via hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)
  pathway, promotes goblet cell hyperplasia and airway smooth muscle proliferation.
  While IL-17A produced by Th17 cells activates fibroblasts to secrete ECM and inhibit
  the collagen degradation in TGF-β1-dependent manner, and IL-17A also could hampers
  the autophagy of inflammation-associated mediators, which promotes development and
  progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Actually, the deposition of ECM also has positive
  effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts, which strengthens ECM deposition. However,
  HDAC2 reverses the above result by inhibiting the differentiation of Th17 cells.
