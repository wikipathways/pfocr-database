caption: 'Metabolic reconstruction of the isolated strains Halonotius terrestris sp.
  nov. F15BT, Halonotius roseus sp. nov. F9-27T and Halonotius aquaticus F13-13T.
  The turquoise panel depicts the simplified metabolic pathway of vitamin B12 biosynthesis;
  the gene names highlighted in boldface were present in the genomes, while the ones
  in gray are inferred to be absent in archaea. Horizontal arrows indicate homology
  between aerobic and anaerobic pathway enzymes. The discontinuous lines correspond
  to complete pathways not represented in the figure. The dark green box highlights
  glycolysis (Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas), while the light green one shows the Entner–Doudoroff
  pathway modified for haloarchaea. The orange depicts the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA); pink color corresponds to isoprenoid biosynthesis: C5 isoprenoid (dark) and
  C10–C20 isoprenoid (light). The light violet box corresponds to dTDP-L-rhamnose
  biosynthesis; the yellow color shows the assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway;
  dark purple is used for the L-glutamate degradation by glutamate dehydrogenase (GdhA).
  Alpha-amylase enzyme for glucose degradation is also represented by its KO identifier.
  Transparency was used to show the inferred components of the complex III of electron
  transport chain. Red boxes are used for genes not present in the studied genomes.
  BCAA, branched-chain amino acid; HMP, hydroxymethylpyrimidine; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.'
